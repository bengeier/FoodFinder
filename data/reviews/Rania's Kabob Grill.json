{"text":"This was absolutely yummy! Service was great. Asked the server for suggestions because we wanted to try something traditional afghan and she suggested several items. I had the lamb shank and it was fall off the bone with tons of flavor! My husband had the beef and chicken keemah and it was just as good. Went with the hot egg plant dip as well as was not disappointed. Highly recommend. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Stumbled in here by accident and want to bring my husband back to try it! I had amazing iced tea, garlic naan with the cilantro jalepeno sauce, and shrimp salad - all delicious! Customer service was really good too. I am excited to go back to try a meat entree."}
{"text":"I have no complaints about the food. I had been craving afghani food since I moved to AZ from NY almost four years ago. The rice which is what I LOVE was amazing. We had the spinach and brown rice both delicious!  What we were not pleased with was the service. Our waitress did not provide silverware or napkins, we had to grab that from another table. When our appetizer was brought out we did not receive plates to eat on.   Next time I may order as take out."}
{"text":"I never give 5 stars but these guys deserve it. Laid back ambiance and great people. The spinach and cheese Samosas are mouth wateringly awesome. The chicken samosa is pretty tasty too. As far as the meats go you can't go wrong. Tasty spice but not too much for the timid. They bring spice to the table if you want for more. The spinach rice is the best. All around great experience."}
{"text":"Very good food. I got take out and it had very nice seasoning and cooked well. Owner was very friendly."}
{"text":"I absolutely love it here.  The staff was great, the food was fantastic we will definitely be back. I couldn't believe there was hardly anyone in there.  I will surely spread the word about this place."}
{"text":"Went here with a friend; it was all right. It's nice to find a place that you can order something and avoid all the baddies (wheat, excessive oils, et cetera). Still, they could be a little less stingy with the meat; got like four small pieces for my sirloin kabob.  The owner came over and asked how we were doing, but not in a schmoozing way. That was nice.  They're a sitdown place, but it's more \"fast casual\" than \"fine dining.\"   I might go there again."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a midday snack. The beef mantu was terrific - the beef was flavorful and spicy. We also had some delicious pistachio ice cream. Great service and friendly staff."}
{"text":"I ordered a delivery feast and while there was a mix up initially the Assistant Manager made it right within 5 minutes of my calling. Simply put, whoever put together the food in the bags stapled the wrong order onto the bag. He came back to my house and swapped out the right meals with a smile and a good natured attitude. The food was still hot and it was delicious.  I ordered the Cornish Game Hen with Kabuli rice, which I need to find the recipe for, it was that good. We also tried the Bolani which was excellent and the spinach and cheese samosa's which were also tasty, needed more cheese in the filling. The Naan was not all that good because it had been sitting a little while longer and in my opinion does not travel well after being warmed. I  will keep going back to this place and ordering delivery. Well done Rania's!"}
{"text":"Had the Rania gyro...it was amazing! Love the condiments/sauces, too! This will soon be one of my favorite go to places, I can see it already!"}
{"text":"Had the sampler platter here today with the hot curry wings, jalape√±o hummus and the chicken samosa. All amazing! Also had the Ash would, highly recommend. Will be back very soon!"}
{"text":"To begin, service is outstanding and restaurant is impeccably clean. Now for the food-it is unique, fresh, and flavorable! Definitely one of my favorites. The salad is delicious and the garlic naan is amazing. The choice of dishes is outstanding. All recommendations by the server exceeded our expectations. We will definitely be back very soon!"}
{"text":"The very best Afghan food I have ever eaten in a restaurant!  The service was great, the food was perfect.  What more can I say.  I forsee using their takeout or delivery frequently."}
{"text":"Delicious!!! I tried this placed yesterday during lunch with a few of my friends. We decided to family style everything in order to taste a little bit of everything on the menu. We ordered 12 different dishes, and they were ALL great!! My personal faves are the beef keemah kabob, and lamb chops. Their house sauce is something outta a dream! Please leave room for dessert and tea though, or you will be disappointed!! My favorite dessert was the cream puff!"}
{"text":"I gotta say, this place was awesome! The customer service was just as good as the food.  I had the Rania Special naan sandwich and the cilantro jalapeno hummus. SOOOOOO Good.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We chose to go to Rania's for dinner based on the Yelp reviews. I had expected great things and was slightly disappointed. To be fair, this was my first time having Afghani food. But, I eat a lot of Middle Eastern, Mediterranean and Indian food. I expected this to fall somewhere in the middle. The food wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either, which knocks it from a 5-star to a 3-star. All of our dishes seemed to be the slightly-less-flavorful-brother of food we like.  On top of that, I am knocking off another star because of the service. When we asked questions about the menu, the server said she didn't know because she had never eaten any of the dishes we asked about. She said that 'people don't send it back to the kitchen, so it should be okay.' I don't want to bad-mouth someone who was possibly having a rough day, but when it's all said and done, she was not very attentive (there were two servers and less than 4 tables occupied in the whole restaurant!)."}
{"text":"Service was amazing, there was a manager named Flynn there who took care of all our needs. A very nice and handsome man. Food was different never had that kind of food before and turns out we've loved it my wife had the shrimp and I had a chicken that I cannot remember the name of but was very delicious. Would definitely go back and suggest to friends."}
{"text":"Couldn't tell ya how the food is because I never got that far.....  After calling 4 times and waiting on hold a total of 15 min, I hung up yet again for call number 5! I told the person on the phone this is the 5th time calling and I'd like to place an order for delivery, I was told were not delivering tonight... mind you it says they deliver and it was 730 pm on a Friday night (tonight actually) so disgusted with having wasted all that time I hung up. I will NEVER be going to this place...ever!"}
{"text":"Three stars for service. If you know about med- or middle-eastern food then you don't want to eat here. Presentation is poor, fast food quality (dry, over cooked), quantity does not match price ($8 hummus can buy a whole tub, here you get 4 table spoons, may be). True Mediterraneans or middle-easteners know that there is no choice between salad or Naan, it's both with dinner. Not here. Side salad was served in a saucer,  lettuce and cucumbers, lots of cucumbers. The Naan was crusty and burned. Ice tea? Super light version, water would have been a better choice. Place was empty another sign of caution. I was lured to this place after watching the video on their website. I did not realize it was done long time ago, when it opened, it looked good then."}
{"text":"So my sister and I were baby-sitting her 17-month old grandson. It was suppertime and we were so very hungry! BUT, as some of you will understand, dining out with a little one can be exhausting!  Consulted yelp for ideas on dinner from restaurants that deliver. Rania's Kabob Grill sounded perfect! Around 7:00 PM, we ordered a Beef/Chicken Combo plate with seasoned brown rice, a Chicken plate, a side of grilled veggies, salad and garlic naan--all through their website! We got a message telling us our order would be delivered between 8:10 and 8:20.  Well. Our order arrived at 7:28!!!!   The food was perfect, hot and delicious! We will do this again for sure!!"}
{"text":"Horrible service. Took forever to serve the complete order. Don't want to waste more time by writing a more elaborate review."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food. Flavors explode on your palate, completely eye opening experience. What'd I get? Wings, very large ones, which could've been a meal in and of themselves, dripping with flavor. Lamb kabob with brown rice, which was very good, but the chicken thigh kabob, with the spinach rice was crazy delicious. Salad was very fresh and the dressing was again, really incredibly tasty. I'd probably eat here at least a few times a week and never get tired of it. Go eat here."}
{"text":"I really like the food here. I had never tried Afgahni food and couldn't say it was authentic but what they are serving is really good.  Some times the service can be slow but I've mostly done call in for pick up or delivery.  I keep wanting to try new things but often find myself getting the chicken breast kabob or naanwhich. The fish is excellent.  Love the green rice. I recently noticed they changed the menu so more new things to try.  I was less impressed by the spinach naanpizza but still might try the others. The restaurant is clean. All staff I dealt with were friendly."}
{"text":"thought we'd give this place a try with me multiple great Yelp reviews.  Highly disappointed!  Tried the beef Mantua.  It easy not only waaaay overpriced, but disgusting!  Our kabob was way overcooked.  When we brought this to the attention of the staff, we were told that's just the way it comes. save your money, don't eat here."}
{"text":"Great food, love their chicken, so tender and flavorful. The spinach rice is great too, and their \"pico\" is delicious."}
{"text":"We had the Bolani as a starter, the afghani meatballs and beef griller for dinner and all were simply fantastic. The meats were all nicely seasoned and moist and home made sauces were flavorful. We finished our meal with afghani ice cream and afghani rice pudding and both were excellent. Our waiter was attentive personable and funny. A very enjoyable evening. The prices were very reasonable and portions are excellent. We left feeling filled and have leftovers."}
{"text":"The food was incredible. I highly recommend checking it out for that reason. They do seem a bit understaffed, but the staff was very friendly. They also have excellent, though not well advertised, beers on tap."}
{"text":"I just watched this place on channel 3.. senora lives... sounded good and delicious.. would love to try it... I adore middle eastern food.. reading the negative comments none made sense.. so I'm going to go and try it this weekend..I'm sure its going to be great.."}
{"text":"So typically a restaurant review should be about the food but before I get to that, I have to talk about the customer service.  Phenominal, amazing, fantastic, customer service!!  Really the best customer service we have had in a long time! Very helpful and very thoughtful for what we needed, not just taking an order but really going the extra mile.  Now about the food... Very typical selection for Mediterranean but what sets this place apart is the flavor!  We actually had plans to stop by DQ for desert afterwards but decided we would skip desert and keep eating our dinner. If you know my wife, this was a huge compliment!  Everything tasted fantastic but they also had a really good green sauce that had a little kick to it and their diced vegetables were very similar to a pico but were stored cold which when mixed with the cooked food was really good!  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We saw Mediterranean listed in the description for Rania so we figured we would give it a try.   Unfortunately for us they primarily an Afgani focused grill so we had to adjust out menu plans.  On the plus side the staff was friendly and checked on us several times to see how everything was.  The naan was fresh and enjoyable.  The Rania Naanwich was tasty and the meat juicy.  My daughter's naanwich was also juicy and enjoyable.  On the negative side our chicken thigh kabob had ok flavor and was dry.  The side order if fries was overcooked to the point of being brittle and the white rice side lacked any flavor of its own.  Overall it was an ok experience but probably not one we will repeat again.  It certainly was not what we expected given the high overall rating they have.  Perhaps we were the exception to the rule."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Never tried Afghanistan food before but meat is flavorful and tender and we come here often now. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"A genuine Afgani restaurant here in the Valley? Who knew? The ambiance is early strip-mall restaurant, but that was the only negative. The food is a cross between Indian and Middle Eastern and excellent. We went there with three couples, and all had different dishes. They were delicious. Because everything is made fresh and from scratch, they were able to accommodate any special food issues we had, with a smile. The owner was friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Rania's for the first time tonight and we both really liked it.  We went at 5pm and were seated immediately. We had the cilantro and jalape√±o hummus with naan bread for an appetizer, it had a little bit of a twang, not too hot, and very tasty.  For our entree we both ordered the beef and chicken kabob combo plate with basmati rice.  The meat had great seasoning, was cooked perfectly and the basmati rice was also very good. We go to Pita Jungle often and both agreed we liked the hummus and kabobs better at Rania's.  The portions were large so we took leftovers home and of course it didn't last long when the kids found it in the fridge. They have a good size menu and we are looking forward to going back and trying something different on the menu."}
{"text":"I've now learned to never trust yelp reviews. We we're the only ones there and that should have been the sign to not enter! The lamb nannwich people reviewed had three cubes of meat in it and when I say cube think the size of a sugar cube! We will not go back."}
{"text":"Went tonight with my whole family including teenagers and my parents in their late 60's. Very good food!! We tried a variety of dishes and shared because we wanted to sample a little bit of everything. I particularly liked the chicken breast kabob, the beef tikka kabob, and both the chicken and the beef keemah kabob. The seasoned brown rice and the spinach rice were delicious. I thought the prices were very reasonable. This is the perfect place for a family dinner. There is something on the menu for everyone....even picky eaters."}
{"text":"Their naan is the best! We also love their eggplant dish and the kabobs. They have recently started offering brunch which is an interesting mix of Afghan and American style breakfast foods."}
{"text":"Ranias can provide a pleasant dining experience through attentive service and very good food. Their lightly spiced tea is pleasant and neutral. Their fresh naan smells and tastess wonderful. Spinach rice with braised lamb shank was highly pleasing."}
{"text":"Came a crossed this place by searching for nearby restaurants on Yelp!  I knew I love Turkish food and was hoping the did would b somewhat similar.   LOVED the food!   I ordered the chicken Naan hummus pizza!  So flavorful n yummy!"}
{"text":"In Phoenix for business and this restaurant is next to my hotel.  Called them up for a delivery.  Took the host suggestion of the chicken kabob platter and ordered it for dinner.  Was not disappointed.  Wonderfully yummy, fresh and lots of terrific spices from the Mediterranean.  Will not disappoint you."}
{"text":"We saw a Groupon for this restaurant and decided to give it a try. We were not disappointed. Great food and great service. We asked the owner to recommend something and he suggested a traditional Afghan dish of chicken or beef keemah kabob. We tried both. The chicken was good but the beef was incredible. The sauces were delicious and so was the naan. Everything tasted so fresh and we will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I had the Vege stuffed Nann... Vegetables freshly prepared.. NAnn not too dry... I had spinach rice as a side... Very good... Good cozy place to dine"}
{"text":"Ate here tonight.  Great food. Great portions at a reasonable price.  Nice atmosphere (light background music playing, heard the Lumineers, White Stripes and Imagine Dragons during dinner).  This is a new place, but don't let that put you off, the food is great.  Had the combo chicken and beef kheemah kabobs with rice and naan bread.  Yogurt dressing and other garnishes all good.  Hours later I'm bummed that I don't  have any leftovers that I could eat now.  Others in my party had the beef tikka kabob and the pan fried fish plate.  I tried it all and loved it all.  Got baklava for dessert, flaky and rich with a good texture underneath.  Waitress was great and accommodating to a party with several kids.  They split up the beef tikka kabob into two plates for my kids.  Owner/chef came over to inquire about the dinner and was very nice also.    Very solid!  I will return.  I'd suggest they get kids cups or smaller to-go cups with lids for small kids."}
{"text":"Got the Lamb and Beef Kabobs and seasoned rice. So fresh cooked just right...little pink in center. The green sauce and red sauce was delicious. Seasoned rice was perfection. Well worth trying. I will be back."}
{"text":"My first time at Rania's.  Went because it is a local place, close to home & had good reviews.  I have to agree with previous reviews, food was excellent.  There was 7 in our group & we made reservations, no problem, the staff was helpful & courteous.  Service was efficient & the place spotless.  We ordered the combo platter, chicken samosas, naan & kabuli & spinach rice.  There was plenty of food & all of was delicious.  Would definitely return & recommend to others."}
{"text":"Had food delivered with Eat24. Was very pleased with the taste and portions that came in my order. Would definitely order from here again and would recommend this place to friends. The hummus was authentic."}
{"text":"Ordered for delivery. Food was excellent! Food came faster than quoted and exceeded expectations! We love having gyros and while ttheir gyro meat is not the best I've ever had it makes up for it with the delicious sauces! Will defiantly be back!"}
{"text":"Varied and interesting menu and decently priced.  We were there for lunch and ordered the lentil soup and one of their \"naanwiches\" (Rania's Special).  Service was prompt and friendly, and our server answered our questions and made some suggestions for us.  Food was very good, nicely presented, and in generous portions.  Will definitely return for dinner one day soon!"}
{"text":"Stopped by looking for something in the area that wasn't Mexican,  (I love Mexican, but have it all the time), and am so glad we did!  We started with the roasted red pepper hummus - delicious.  It comes with two sauces, the cilantro jalepe√±o is outstanding!  I wanted to buy a pint!  The nan bread was fresh and warm.  I had the sirloin kabab; the meat was well cooked and the bed of basmati rice plentiful and flavorful.  My partner had the lamb and he was equally happy.  The atmosphere is simple, but pleasing.  Service was the same.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Pure deliciousness. My family just ate here, and everything we ate was wonderful.  Such unique flavors.  I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Amazing food! I got the beef sirloin and chicken breast with spinach basmati rice and garlic naan. Will definitely be back. The owner was super nice as well!"}
{"text":"This place is very delicious!! Got the combo platter with steak and chicken kabob and the spinach rice.  So good I'll be bank- SOON!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. Ordered chicken/beef kabob combo with spinach rice based on other reviews and not disappointed! The spinach samosa are also fantastic. My new favorite restaurant."}
{"text":"My husband and I always go to Thrive and always notice Rania's. I was craving something new so I called in a take out order. I got the Cornish Hen with spinach rice and jalopeno naan bread.   Everything was absolutely delicious!! We definitely will be back to dine in and take out orders are definitely in our future."}
{"text":"Amazing service, amazing food. Every time that I am in the area I stop by. Can't get enough of the kabuli style rice!!!"}
{"text":"Okay... this place is amazazing!!  I love this kind of food to begin with, But Rania's is just awesome. I went there for the first time on Tuesday of this week and I have been back every day for lunch!   The Naan bread is out of this world and cooked fresh in their clay pot oven when you order it. We tried the appetizer sampler platter and everything was really good, especially the Spinach Samosa. I've tried both the beef Keemah Kabob and the Chicken Breast Kabob and they'e great. the Spinach Seasoned Rice is great too.  The owner and his staff were really nice to us and I just can't say enough good about this place! Prices are very reasonable too. You gotta try them out!"}
{"text":"My review rating is strongly based on my dinner entree.  I ordered the lamb kabobs with the spinach rice.  The rice was very good, as was the yogurt sauce.  My entree though was beef, not lamb.  I brought this to the attention of our waiter who proceeded to tell me that that was very mild lamb.  What?!  I love lamb, I cook lamb...I know lamb....and this was definitely not lamb.  And he wouldn't concede.. No excuse.  I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Great place.  Food was amazing.  Had the naan special.  4 people Monday night for 40$. New fav"}
{"text":"The best thing I have had I'm a long time. I ordered the lamb gyros with fries. Fast friendly service"}
{"text":"good food, good service, open on sunday when most of the other restaurants were not great value for price"}
{"text":"I've visited a number of times the last several months. I'm not sure why I don't see more people in here. The food is amazing!  Our waiter last night was Dennis and he was fabulous. Extremely friendly and made some excellent food suggestions.  I ordered Eggplant Borani which came with naan bread and Kabuli style rice ( a brown rice with shredded carrots and raisins).The flavors were exceptionally delicious and a good portion for lunch the next day. Also ordered some chicken samosas. They're fried, but not heavily greasy and so tasty!  If you're seeking something different than the same old eateries, give Rania's Kabob Grill a try."}
{"text":"Great food that is tasty and full of flavor. Having said that they were short handed and it took a while to get the food, there is a lack of coordination in the service, missing or forgotten items. The food portions are small, I ordered the lamb kabob plate, it came with rice and 4 pieces of lamb kabob, the appetizer combo had one to two table spoon of hummus, eggplant for $12.  In short great food, questionable service and small portions."}
{"text":"I love this place!  The owners are awesome and cater to your every need.  The food has so much flavor and it is truly one of the best restaurants in the valley. I eat here at least 3 times per week and I find myself craving for the green chutney sauce. I think everyone needs to try this new restaurant you will definitely love the food.  See you there!"}
{"text":"Worst place to visit yes the food may be good, but the unprofessional attitude of the manager is insane, doesn't treat employees with respect whatsoever. I've witnessed on a couple different occasions the manager acting completely irrational and confrontational IN FRONT OF CUSTOMERS. Although the two older owners are very nice the English barrier makes it hard for them to run their business leaving this certain person in charge. I would never willingly give business to a company like that."}
{"text":"Really great food  We had the chicken Samos they were wonderful ax well a chicken kabob server with very yummy rice We will be returning"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been looking for a Middle Eastern restaurant in the Mesa area, and this place was a great find. The location is kind of hidden, but the service and food was great.   We put a order in for the hot curry wings, leg of lamb kabob, and the beef sirloin kabob platter. The Wings are probably the best wings I have ever had! They are marinated for 72 hours in a spicy blend. They are then skewered and flame grilled. The portion size for the wings was huge. AMAZING! The leg of lamb kabob could use a little less salt and the sirloin kabob was perfect.  Overall, a great find and we will be coming back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I visit this place frequently and have always loved it.  We were very disappointed recently to see that they have removed their salad bar. The first time we came they had a full salad bar and encouraged patrons to visit it as often as they liked.  The next time they gave only tiny baby sized salad plates and only 1 per person.  Every time thereafter, the toppings and offerings on the salad bar seemed to be decreasing.  Now, it is completely gone.  This is a HUGE mistake.  Every decent middle eastern place out there offers a free salad bar.  And honestly, if I am going to pay 10 to 15 bucks per plate, I want to get more than rice and a few cubes of meat. They give you a ton of rice, but not much meat for your money.  This was one of my favorite restaurants of all time, but without the salad bar, the sauces, the choices of chutneys and pico, the toppings--well, it is just mediocre.  Middle eastern cuisine should always be accompanied by vegetables and one should not have to choose between naan or a small side salad. I have travelled to Greece, Egypt and much of Europe and every true mediterranean restaurant serves a heft portion of salad.  The competing restaurants in the area like Phoenicia Cafe have a nice all you can eat salad bar.  I am so disappointed. This place was a great, tasty, unique, fresh value for the money, but now it just seems overpriced. Rice is cheap. Naan is cheap.  6 cubes of chicken also cheap.  Give us some vegetables for our $12.  There are too many other restaurants in the area to choose from!  They should bring back the salad bar. Until then, we will sadly, go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Update: No more daily special priced plates.   I reluctantly went again after a couple of months and was pleasantly surprised. My boyfriend went with chicken breast and said it was still a little on the tough side, but the flavors well made up for it. I went with the butternut squash borani, which was DELICIOUS! Especially with the contrasting yogurt sauce. It is definitely one of best vegetarian dishes I've had here in the valley.  Their naan seems to have changed? I'm not 100% but it seemed a lot crispier... Really tasty nonetheless! Service, speed, cleanliness, etc. are all still superb.  1 star off because the chicken could have been better and the prices are a bit on the higher side."}
{"text":"Great food...really enjoyed the brown rice with kabob. Came back a few days later and had the eggplant dish with the home made bread. Would recommend for a date night or any night with family and friends."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, generous portions, a can't miss for a Mediterranean/middle eastern food."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner out of curiosity. I don't think it is authentic Afghani food. More like Americanized afghani food. The food tasted good nevertheless. They have two accompaniment sauces and that is kickass ! And their naan is just yummy. Good serving portions. I was too full to try their dessert. I would go back to try their homemade pistachio ice cream!"}
{"text":"Great service, great food and reasonable. What else can you ask for.   Amazing:  Chicken dark meat Kabab Leg of lamb Kabab Samosa Eggplant dip Kabuli rice Nan Garlic Nan  Good: Sirloin Kabab  Beef Keemah Bolani Humus Fries Desserts  Next time: Lamb Shank"}
{"text":"Wow, truly great food.  So tasty.  I have no knowledge of Middle Eastern cuisine, but I do know good food when I experience and taste it.  And this is not just good, but great!  The naan pita bread with garlic was to die for, and the chicken breast kabob was transcendently delicious."}
{"text":"Good quality of food. Reasonable prices. Quick service. Friendly server and a kind owner. Who is up and running, making food and checking in at the customers all the time. Authentic food. The right ingredients for a successful restaurant."}
{"text":"Amazing Authentic food! If you are not sure what to get call and speak to the owner, he won't steer you wrong!"}
{"text":"Tucked in the corner of the shopping center it's hard to see from the street.  But it's worth it!  Loved the meatballs with savory rice - delicious.  And the owners were so attentive and hospitable.  Will surely be back! :-)"}
{"text":"Try the potato cakes an samosas! ! Prices are reasonable. Atmosphere is clean and pleasant."}
{"text":"Flavors are unmatched! I had the chicken qorma and it was perfectly seasoned. The naan? I had the jalape√±o naan and could have eaten a pound of it. Without exaggeration, everything was delicious."}
{"text":"I did not expect to find the best wings in the Valley at Rania's.  However, enticed by the happy hour special, I was lucky enough to find them here.  They are marinated for 72 hours and treated to what they call a \"hot curry\" sauce, but these wings  are surprisingly close to their Buffalo cousins.  The unique white dipping sauce is a nice departure from ranch and bleu cheese.  Order the chicken samosas for a appetizing concentration of the savory Afghani-Mediterranean flavors Rania's showcases with their menu items.  However, be warned that they can spoil light appetites, because they are filling and you won't be able to stop eating them until your plate is clean.  We both ordered kebab platters, shrimp and seasoned, ground and formed beef (as opposed to meat chunks, which is also an option).  We were recommended the spinach rice and the naan to round out the platter by Rich, our excellent server (more on him below). They were perfect accompaniments to a stellar recommendation.  Get the beef for all-out flavor and the shrimp for lighter meal.  The best part of the experience was our server, Rich.  My other reviews are always ragging on poorly paced meals.  However, not only did Rich pull off the timing flawlessly, he confirmed that he would do as much right after he took our orders.  That's how it's done, folks.  By doing so he showed courtesy and respect for what we wanted and effectively communicated that gesture.  Rich is only there on weekends, so make sure you get here on Saturday or Sunday to experience $200 per person service on a $40.00 meal.  What a class act!"}
{"text":"What awesome food! Plus they have happy hour for drinks and appetizers. The service was excellent and a fair price. The servings are very generous. I will be back!"}
{"text":"I found this place from Yelp and it did not let me down. We got the beef and chicken combo with garlic naan. SO GOOD. We also got the chicken hummus pizza (not on the menu). It was also so so good. We loved the jalape√±o cilantro hummus! Definitely will be coming back."}
{"text":"Definitely a good spot for Mediterranean/Afghan in the East Valley. Great portions, super friendly service and really tasty grub!"}
{"text":"We decided to try this place on a suggestion from some friends of ours who live nearby. Needless to say, we were not disappointed!    My fiance spent 9 months deployed in Kabul last year and has searched high and low all over the valley for traditional Afghanistan food, but hasn't found anything that really wowed him...until we ate at Rania's.   We ordered the Beef Keemah and the Lamb Naanwhich along with a plate of hummus. The naan bread is the best I've ever had, along with everything else we tasted. The rice, the meat, the flavors - it was all so perfect. The owner even came over and chatted with us for awhile, he was such a nice man!   This is definitely our go-to spot from now on. Rania's has earned lifelong patrons with us!"}
{"text":"Simply amazing food! Fresh, and unpredictable flavors that were perfect in every way! I had the mouthwatering lamb shank! It was orgasmic! Rich gravy covered the meaty shank. Salad bar was fresh and had some great additions.  We had the spinach and feta with naan bread. Yummy! Try this place asap! They are delicious! Also coming soon- a full bar and breakfast!"}
{"text":"Very delicious food. The hubby got the leg of lamb kabob and I got a veggie naan-wich. The spinach rice was very good, and was our favorite part of the meal, although everything was so tasty. We were surprised this restaurant isn't busy when we were there, because the food is excellent. It's a little far out from where we live, but we would like to come back."}
{"text":"Amazing ONCE AGAIN. The lamb is off the hook. I don't know what it is about that rice and their pico, but I could eat it with every meal.  Def gonna keep coming back."}
{"text":"pretty good food. Try the eggplant appetizer and kabobs. Salad bar was good too!"}
{"text":"My wife and I spent 4 years living in Kuwait, acquiring a taste for good Mediterranean food. Rania's fits the bill! The owner, Abdul who is from Afghanistan, oversees the high Quality fresh food menu and preparation. The Naan bread is amazing!!!"}
{"text":"SO flavorful! Everything was spot on. All meat is from Midwestern Meats in Mesa. Ordered the following off the suggestion of our server (Dennis, thank you!)... - Small plates: Mantu, eggplant dip - Chicken qorma w/ white rice and garlic naan - Beef/Chicken keemah w/ spinach rice and garlic naan - Seasonal nut brown ale (Oak Creek Reserve) Incredibly satisfying and fresh food. Totally coming back again."}
{"text":"We drove 30 miles to try out this place. Mediterranean food never disappoints us and so neither did this place.  Food: Authentic Afghani food. I tried their Cornish Hen with Kabuli Rice, loved it. My wife is a big fan of Lamb kabobs and she loved it too. Both their \"chutneys\"  were good.  Ambience : well I was expecting it to be more appealing but the place is too simple, nothing much.   Price: IMHO a little pricey. Although the food taste very good but a 14$ dish is a little too much..   All in all a must visit place."}
{"text":"Being extra generous but its a 3 for food quality at best but the owner was very quick to respond when they left items off my order. Will give it one more  shot  soon, hope they serve beer or wine by then!"}
{"text":"I have visited this place 3 times now. I want to give it a better rating but it has been so inconsistent regarding service. The food itself is 4 star rating. I love everything I've tried. Chicken Kabob and Eggplant Borani are great. This time I was on the phone for 10 min while the waitress figured out how to put in the order. I waited 30 min for a call ahead order on a Sat.  I hope the restaurant gets it together because I really like the food!"}
{"text":"Affordable and great food. Highly recommend this place. Try their cartimom tea and lamb burgers"}
{"text":"A friend introduced me to this quaint family restaurant a year or so ago. It's a bit off the beaten path. We've been stopping in to eat when we are out in this area. It's also good enough to make a special drive out there.  We've tried the lamb, chicken, and most recently the sirloin. Wow. All of the meat kabbob's were tender and delicious. I ALWAYS get the spinach rice, as it is beyond amazing. Of course, I do love spinach too. My daughter has gotten several different items off the kiddo menu. Honestly, typically these offerings I find a bit gross, but I've tried everything she has gotten and it is far above and beyond most. =)   On our last trip, they has Pistachio ice cream...oh...wow...was that ever good. Hubby and daughter polished it off before I could get more than 2-3 small bites.   We will certainly be back. =)"}
{"text":"Rich the server is fantastic, anything he suggests is delicious and the value for the money is great."}
{"text":"I got the hummus chicken pizza, it was delicious. Substituted the jalape√±o hummus and it was really good. Very friendly owner and great food."}
{"text":"Went for dinner using a Groupon. I think I'd be a little more disappointed if I paid full price. There were only 2 waitresses for the entire restaurant and they were full. The servers were nice though and apologized for the long waits. Afghanistan is in between India and the Middle East and the food has influenced, and has been influenced, by both.   We started with the Ashak and Beef Mantu. In both dishes the mantus were just carriers for the sauces. The sauce for the Ashak was beef, lentil & tomato. The sauce for the Beef Mantu was carrots and peas. I liked the carrots & peas sauce better. I could see eating it over a bowl of rice.  We had the Lamb Naanwich and the Chicken Thigh Kabob Platter. The meats in both meals were perfectly cooked and seasoned. However, I found the brown rice very salty and the spinach rice only a little less so. The Afghan salsa was fresh and delicious. The salad bar was small but filled with fresh veggies. Unfortunately, the yogurt sauce that came with our meals was over seasoned and salty too. The naan is more puffy than Indian naan.   The gyro are not made in house. I've had those strips before and didn't want to chance having them again.   The waitress said that they would soon start serving breakfast.   My husband loved the food, as salty as it was. So I guess we'll go back at least once more. Otherwise, I'd prefer to keep my Middle Eastern and Indian flavors separate."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Amazing staff! 1st time here tonight and we will definitely be back. Had the lamb shank and the Cornish hen and YUMMY!!!!!!  The staff was helpful and funny the food was better than I expected! We will totally be back and tell everyone to come here."}
{"text":"This weekend I was searching for some Afghani cuisine and then I found out this place. The attendant was nice. we started  with chicken samosa and that was really good. Actually whatever we ordered we liked it. If you don't like egg plant then also you should try Bawaghanous (It taste different, in better way).Finish your dinner with Afghani ice cream or baklava (we tried both). Chicken wing was little bit turn down for me, anyway I don't like it personally so leave it. Service was fast, I will recommend this place to others."}
{"text":"On a whim, we were looking for something a little different from the average delivery. Rania's popped up as close by and we do like Mediterranean food, so we decided to order. We got the Chicken Hummus Pizza, Rania's Special Pizza, a Beef Naanwich, cilantro and regular hummus.   Oh boy was it good. The hummus is hands down, the best we've had. Plus, the naan is spectacular and so fresh! I was not expecting so many toppings and flavors on the pizzas. They were out of this world good. The naanwich was big and filled with flavor, and the rice was excellent. We can't wait to order again and again!"}
{"text":"Visited Ranias after a purchasing a Groupon for the restaurant. The food was delicious, hot, amd fresh. I had the beed sirloin kabob platter with about 6 good sized pieces of sirloin and amazingly seasoned brown rice. The naan was served hot, fresh from the oven and was absolutely delicious! Several beers on tap and bottle choices as well. I would definitely visit again!!!!"}
{"text":"Very nice food, defied entry suggest the lamb kabob at a rare, yummy! And don't get me started on the pudding, amazingly tasty, really want these guys to stick around. Give it a try."}
{"text":"Two words ! Absolutely Amazing !!!!!!!!! Food was such a change from the dull norm.   It was fresh and healthy options available    Everything that I tried exceeded my expectations.  It was flavorful and well presented    But the single best thing was the SERVICE!   The server made us feel at home.   Very attentive when we needed him to be   Nothing I can recommend to change.   Must try !"}
{"text":"Omg  best wings ever. Love this food will have to come back again. Always looking for somewhere new this was a great surprise"}
{"text":"Delicious!!  I haven't had good Afghani food since I left NY.  My husband, who is an old school \"meat and potatoes\" guy, had the beef keemah kabob and loved it.  I had the chicken breast kabob and also loved it.  The servers were friendly and attentive, and the owner stopped by to see how our meal was going.    I will definitely be going back soon."}
{"text":"This place is Amazing been going since the opened at least a couple times a month.. Everything I have tasted has been delish from the wraps to the Kabobs. The Spinach Rice is terrific.. Cannot say enough about this place . We enjoy authentic food and that is exactly what they serve."}
{"text":"So good. Came for lunch and got the gyro with spinach rice. Also got the iced tea to drink....which has cardamom flavoring. Excellent service, waiter was very nice, food was delicious. I will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Groupon success again!   Prior to heading to Rania's, I had an image of an older shopping center with a small hole in the wall restaurant. Very traditional in appearance and strong spice smells.This was not the case. The Higely Shopping Center is newly developed next to the new Banner Hospital. The restaurant is pretty spacious; 8 booths (I think) and about 6 tables. The Expo window let's you view the kitchen while serving yourself with a delightful salad or Pepsi product. The decor was colorful and lively, but still showed tradition with a modern flair. The young female servers were friendly and helpful, so much so that they ordered almost all my order. Which I was wanting because I didn't know what to expect being a novice to Middle Eastern\Afghani food. I placed me  to go order for my boyfriend and I,  which took about 10 minutes,  I think to complete. The spread include:    - Vegetable Samosas: fried potato turnover with onion and peas. Delicious!  - Beef Mantu: beef steamed dumplings covered in a red and cream sauce. They were like raviolis with spicy marinara. Good, not sure I order again.   - Roasted Red Pepper Hummus: fresh and yummy. A little atypical as it was chunky; not smooth like most hummus.  - Chicken Kabob with spinach rice and Naan: Rice was scrumptious, chicken was tender and juicy, but I felt it needed more in flavor. Naan, well I will get to this later.   - Beef Sirlion Kabob with spinach rice and salad bar: Like the chicken it was missing the mark in flavor for me, but the green spicy sauce, taziki and Mediterranean Pico added to it. The salad bar had mixed greens that you could add Kalamata olives, grilled mixed veggies, garbanzo beans, etc. Quite an array of fixings and dressings. All fresh and cold.   Now most of important the Naan! I don't know if they have one of those fancy flat tops or steamer things, but the bread was crisp and fluffy. The burnt edges were lil' smoky bites of goodness. The slight drizzle of olive oil added a sweetness that made me want gobble it. Did I add they served up a plentiful amount and thank goodness they did as it was amazing with hummus or just alone.   Will I go back?  Heck yes, Groupon or not.   Tip on the Groupon:  Make sure you read fine print; any smart person does! You cannot use it with other coupons or specials and there are two offers are available. One for a set amount to use in whole and the other to spilt into 3 separate small amounts."}
{"text":"Visiting family from the East Coast craving some Afghani food and Yelpers led me to Rania's when my go-to place was closed on Sunday.  Sometimes things happen for a reason.  The place is quite large and simply decorated with an oriental rug and a number of decorative items on the walls.   We were attended to promptly for our drink order which for the most part was a nice tall glass of water with lemon.  One of us rebelled and ordered a chocolate-stout \"guinness\" type beer which came in a really tall glass.  Looked amazing and it was.  Ordered Chicken Samosas that came out crispy with an ample, delicious filling of ground chicken with peas. Nice middle eastern seasonings, but not overwhelming.  Nice start.  Our orders were quite diverse:  Chicken kabob sandwich with seasoned rice; lamb kabob sandwich; Leg of Lamb kabob combo; Braised Lamb shank; Chicken Quorma.  I had the chicken kabob \"nanwich\" that was tasty, but the nan wrapping was too thick for my liking.  I moistened the sandwich with the coriander chutney which added a fresh, spicy taste. The seasoned rice that came with it was flavorful and nicely cooked.  Nothing worse than soggy rice but this one was cooked perfectly. The lamb Kabob sandwich was quite good and the spinach rice accompaniment got rave reviews from everyone who ordered it.  I tasted it and found that it had a hint of mint. Nice touch!  The lamb shank was a large portion, but we must remember that this lamb dish comes on a bone.  The person who ordered it was happy with his dish. The Chicken Quorma presented in a red sauce was enjoyed as well.   We ordered two desserts, Pistachio ice cream and Baklava.  Who doesn't love Baklava?  The pistachio ice cream dish came topped generously with whipped cream.  And then, the moment happened,  I delved my spoon into that pistachio ice cream which was nothing short of nirvana.  OMG.  Pistachio ice cream drizzled with rose water laden with chopped pistachios.  YES, YES. Pistachios in pistachio ice cream!  When was the last time that happened?  I mean LOTS of pistachios, not a sprinkling here and there.  Yes, Rania's ---you got me! You got me good.  I LOVED this dessert.  Then there was the Baklava--large, full of nuts and made with honey.  Yes.  I could taste the honey (not the corn syrup that most places make it with).  Another taste thrill.  Nicely done, Rania's you gave a us delightful conclusion to an overall wonderful meal experience.   Met the owner, Wally, at the tail end of our visit when we had the opportunity to chat. Such a friendly and charming individual.  It makes a difference when the owner is hands-on and is able to chat up his customers.  The tasty food and the cordiality of the owner will make me come back over and over again.  Thanks Wally."}
{"text":"I came to eat here yesterday with a friend, and what an awful experience it was. The owner got into an argument with an employee and what followed was unlike anything I had ever seen while dining out. Not only were they yelling at each other, but the owner was yelling obscenities at the employee in front of all of the customers. It eventually escalated to where the owner told the employee to get out (in words I will not repeat in this review). While I understand things like that can happen, it was very unprofessional for the owner to go about it in such a manner for all to see. Very disrespectful all around. I will not be coming back and I will be telling others to choose somewhere else to eat."}
{"text":"I LOVE Afghani kabobs so am pretty fussy because of a place we've gone to back East for years. I was pleasantly surprised that I found this place to be so good!  Chicken kabob and brown rice were excellent. Salad was very fresh but only greens with a little cucumber (though I asked for no onions). Garlic naan was very good but I would prefer a whole wheat-based naan rather than white. Service was OK.  I recommend and will be back."}
{"text":"The server was very friendly and attentive. Surprised to see the place empty around 3 in the afternoon. Had the bolani on happy hour special and the lamb Naanwich with spinach rice. The bolani was great, especially with the yogurt dip. The basmati style spinach rice was very good and there was a lot more than I expected. The veggies in the Naanwich were very flavorful. The lamb was amazing sooo tender and tasty even in the next day."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing!  Our party of four decided to try it out based on the great reviews. We went during happy hour and sampled all of the appetizers offered for just $5 each. All of them delicious - potato tart, dumplings, wings, and especially the eggplant dip with the naan bread. Then at the suggestion of our server, we ordered the sampler platter which feeds 4-6. What an excellent value and great way to try a wide variety of kabobs and sides.  Everything was delicious!  For dessert, we shared the homemade baklava which was to die for. I'm so happy we found Rania's and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went there because of a groupon and we loved it. Great tasting food and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Ask for Dennis (waiter) he's funny. Thank you for serving tonight.  They ran out of whatever we ordered so free of charge and replaced it with another meat choice  I'm going into food coma, I'm forgetting what I'm going to say. Anyway, the food is delish!! Come visit Rania's!!"}
{"text":"I miss ya baby.  You were exotic and exciting and mysterious.  You opened me to a whole new world.  And of course, I didn't appreciate you enough and didn't pay enough attention and one day you were gone and I was heartbroken, wondering what I was going to do next, which turned out to be pick another one up on the other side of the highway, and continue my passionate affair.  With Afghani food of course!  Had a nice lunch today at this Afghani restaurant that opened two weeks ago. At the northeastern corner of Higley and Baseline, this space has been a revolving door of mediocre Indian buffets, but this restaurant I'm hoping is here to stay. First impression, I'm not going to miss Ariana's, which was a short-lived Afghani restaurant on the other side of the 60.  Tastefully decorated with mainstream music playing not too loudly, was a spacious place for lunch.  There was a 20 top that was seated shortly before us, so can't judge service too much, as it was probably around 30 minutes before we got our food. They proclaim proudly about a 72 hour marinade process and a custom made kebob grill thats supposed to be the bees knees.  With whatever you order you get a choice of different sides, amongst a salad bar, which although tiny had a nice assortment of add-ons, like chick peas, afghani pico, roasted red peppers, chutneys, and conventional stuff you'd expect as well.  Yummy times on the Lamb Kebobs! The skewer was removed from the meat, so although it looks small it still packs quite a punch (twhs) and was quite a filling meal. Tasty, lean lamby goodness, with a firm and satisfying mouthfeel!  The chutney was pretty tart, I liked it a lot, although I disagree with a previous comment about the spiciness. The little cup of pico de gallo Afghani style (haha I'm sure theres an actual name but too lazy to look it up) was tasty. Also I'm sure misnamed but the Tahini sauce was thinner then a greek one and more herbacious, quite delicious. The spinach accented basmati rice was fine but not noteworthy.  My wife had their GRILLER- Tikka kabob, grilled onions, grilled vegetables and creamy house sauce, had a few bites and was quite tasty. Their naan bread they used for the wrap is thicker and almost wheatier then anything I've had before, kinda neutral on it but worked as an acceptable conveyance of the deliciousness inside.  Has only been opened two weeks so will continue to explore what they offer, pretty wide assortment of items on their menu, with some vegetarian entrees for those so inclined."}
{"text":"All I can say is WOW Just moved to the area and was looking for a decent place close to home. Stopped in for dinner with my girlfriend and we were greeted right away. Place had decent dinner crowd for 6pm. We both had side salads to start and it was good. Dressing was lite and greens were crisp. I ordered the Chicken Quoba with spinach rice and naan. It was spectacular! My girl had the Afghani Meatballs with white rice and garlic Naan. She loved it!!! This place gets 4 thumbs up from us and we will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered take-out once with my mother. Ordered delivery twice to my home. I think I need to dine in the restaurant to see if the portions are larger and if it tastes better hot. Not that it didn't taste good, but I thought it could have been better if it was fresher.  When I ordered the take-out, it was hot-ish when we ate it, and I really did love it. The chicken chapli my mother ordered had a great flavor and the spinach rice was an excellent compliment to it. I ordered the butternut squash. It was good and spicy, but I forgot how little time it takes for butternut to cool off. It wasn't as hot (temperature-wise) as I would have liked, and it was a little over-cooked which didn't help either. Good blend of spices though.  I was a little disappointed with the garlic naan. Maybe I'm spoiled by Copper Kettle and their fantastically fresh garlic naan from the tandoor. This naan is thicker, which is fine, but they don't seem to use fresh garlic. It looks like it was brushed with butter and sprinkled with garlic powder salt. Oy. Might save the owners some money, but it isn't a good choice. Skip the salt and the powder. Use real garlic. The flavor would be sooooo much better.  Let's talk delivery.  Yikes. What a difference. The portions are smaller, the food is colder and it is more expensive since they charge you a delivery fee. My son ordered a kabob that came with merely 3 pieces. My chapli had 2 pieces. The samosas sit in their own grease. Ew. My friend (who is from out-of-town) loved their spinach pizza-naan though. Since I am a fair person, I tried them again, hoping the bad stuff was a fluke. Same thing. However, their hummus \"pizza\" was amazing. Loved it!!  Just to be fair, I need to point out that the temperature of the food could be partially my fault. I do live at mile 4.8 of their 5-mile maximum radius. Travel time could affect the food temp, and I'm probably the last stop if they have multiple orders."}
{"text":"I had a craving for something different tonight.  I'm glad I came here!  Not the best appetizers I've ever had (especially the samosas) though.  They also bring you two sauces at the beginning; one green one red, and the waitress warned us how spicy they were, but they weren't at all.  Maybe that's just us, though.  We are from New Mexico after all.  I didn't care for the red sauce at all.  I would recommend the green.  The naan is almost too buttery and really thick.  I thought naan was supposed to be a little lighter?  Hmm.  Basically for me it was very mediocre up to that point, but the entrees were above average.    My fianc√© said it was the best gyro she has ever had.  I tasted it, and it was amazing.  SUPER tender.  I had the lamb and beef kabob combo.  The meat was nicely cooked and very juicy and tender.  I chose the brown rice \"kabuli\" style.  Even after I was stuffed, I couldn't stop eating that rice, it was excellent.  My fianc√©'s spinach rice was good too, but I liked mine better.    If you go at night, the place is VERY dark, but I liked it.  Overall I recommend this place."}
{"text":"Upon ordering, I presented the coupon for free appetizer and ordered several different plates.  At end of meal, waitress forgot all about the coupon and didn't ring up the discount even though it was placed there with the credit card. Reminded her after she ran the card.  Instead of doing refund, she said she was not going to refund anything.  She said it was impossible and proceeded to give me extra coupons in place of a refund.  So I'm out the money and didn't make a fuss about it in the restaurant because it would ruin my night.  Well I won't be back to order more food again."}
{"text":"VERY good food, large portions and very friendly family owners... Can't say a negative thing. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Ended up here by accident, but glad we did. Tried the Afghani fries, which were awesome! And the eggplant Borhani was very good as well. Not cheap, but not too expensive, portion sizes were very nice. Let me clarify the Borani was a great deal, but the fries were slightly more expensive than expected.  Better than expected craft beer selection, and I had no idea that Dari was so similar to Spanish. Out of Afghan tea today unfortunately. I will be back to try the gyro!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the vegetarian options. We had the Eggplant Borani & Chicken Kababs. One of my new favorite places for Indian food! The Nan was awesome too!!"}
{"text":"I came here a few times during their first month, but I haven't been back in awhile since I no longer work next door to the restaurant. I would hesitate on returning after reading some of these reviews indicating that they switched from counter service to table service. The workers there had a hard enough time deciphering the menu and ringing up orders anyways. I'm frightened how they would handle a full service gig.  There are some good items here, however. I like the first two dishes that I had tried, the eggplant and butternut squash. Both were very unique for this area, and the flavors were great. I really like the kabuli rice too. I liked the small salad bar. I couldn't get enough of their Afghani pico de gallo.  I wasn't as impressed with the appetizers. The samosas and ashak were both too greasy. I didn't like the baklava either, but I'm ruined on that dessert after going to Turkey."}
{"text":"First time eating at a middle eastern restaurant. Gyro and samosa aren't limited to Greek and Indian cuisine, respectively. Great place for lunch if you are looking for smaller portions. Definitely bringing my friends one day."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. My wife had the fish which was very good, and I had the ground steak. The service was awesome. I can wait to go back and try more dishes."}
{"text":"My family has been coming here since they were opened and loved it ever since. We order the same thing every time, the chicken and steak beef kabobs with the spinach rice is an excellent choice. It is very tasting and with the chutney sauce makes it taste even better. I would recommend this restaurant to everyone who like kabobs. Very clean and very friendly restaurant to dine in. Everything was well cooked and perfect. Can't wait to try the other foods. Look Good!!!"}
{"text":"Good service and atmosphere. We went here on a Saturday evening and the entire restaurant was empty. The food was ok but lacked a lot of flavor. No one in our family was impressed or took the leftovers home."}
{"text":"This was the best naan and Gyro I've ever had. The staff was friendly and so hard working. I will go back to try the lamb kebabs."}
{"text":"I've been looking for a good Mediterranean place with no luck until a co-worker referred me to Rania's. This place is amazing! I highly recommend the spinach rice and the Keemah. The Afghani Pico is also delicious!"}
{"text":"All I can say is WOW! I grew up In Los Angeles eating superb Middle Eastern food and this place is incredible. Friendly staff, owner is very kind. We ordered the chicken and rice combo plate. It comes with a yogurt sauce and a tomato cucumber chutney. It came with a side salad with their house mint dressing. So good! My husband ordered the shrimp and rice combo plate. The shrimp are plump and large. Super fresh. A MUST have are the Afghani Fries. I have never in my life had anything like them. Nice and spicy loaded with flavor. This place blew me away. Large portions at great prices."}
{"text":"Not bad not great but would come back.   Chicken thighs were quite tasty and tender, the rice was under cooked and bland, the yogurt sauce was a little too tangy. The latter two knocked the rating down.   Also had hummus that was overpriced and bland and the naan bread was crusty and had no chewiness."}
{"text":"Afghan food. This place is 100% legitimate. The food was fantastic.  I gave the chef a choice of two entrees for him to choose from ... He ended up bringing me his favorite (one of the choices) plus a little extra to try.  The bread - homemade - delicious.  Try the \"red\" spicy dipping sauce-that's good too.  The owner was super friendly.  They source the lamb - I will get again.   Go here!"}
{"text":"Wife and I tried this place last night for the 1st time. I had the Lamb Kabob, with a side of Badenjan  Borani (eggplant). My Wife had the Lamb Chops with a side of Borani Kadu (butternut squash) and both of us had some Naan. We are huge fans of Mediterranean food and India food, this place was similar along those lines, basmati rice, tzatziki sauce.. you know.. all of that...soooooo  When you first walk up to the place it doesn't look like much from the outside. From the inside the seating is spacious, decor is average, they have one flat screen T.V. on the wall and they like to blast top 40 music. It is very clean. There weren't many people just my wife and I and about 3 other people for a 6pm Thursday night. As you walk in you're corralled into a walk way area where there is a menu on the wall to chose your dishes. You will place your order 1st and pay at that time then they will hand you a number and they will bring your food to you at your table. Pepsi products here only.   The booth we sat in was super comfy and I kind of like that it wasn't super busy. We had attentive service, but like I said just about a total of 5 people eating. The two girls working seems like they needed something to do. :)  The food.. was good. My lamb was soft and the brown rice was nice, my Wife thought they may have put something in it as she thought it was very good compared to her white rice. Her lamb chops were cooked just right and very good. My eggplant was very slightly sweet and tasty, the butter squash my Wife had was slightly sweet and very good as well. They have us plenty of naan so much we took it home.   I enjoyed the dinner and environment as well as the servers were nice. There wasn't anything that WOW'd me so I'm not so inclined to give full stars. Al together for 2 dinners I think we payed over $30 dollars, so not the cheapest place to eat. I'm thinking the dollar amount could be slightly less for the amount of food, but no complaints.   I be back to try another item and maybe I'll give this place one more star, we'll see.. but I do recommend the place at least one time."}
{"text":"Yum! Tried this place tonight while staying at the hotel nearby. Try the spinach rice and Cornish hen...yum! Love the green sauce it all comes with."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious! The service was friendly and efficient! I'm new to Afghan cuisine and brother let me tell ya - give me more!!! The place was clean and the atmosphere was OK. I shall return!  A solid 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Went here for my father-in-law's birthday celebration (his choice) less than 2 weeks ago Saturday 2/27/16. We were a party of 13 that had a reservation at 6pm. My husband and I were the first of our party to show up. No greeting upon walking in (no big deal) and we figured that the only larger table that was set up was most likely for us, so we headed that way. The larger table was set up for 10 max so my husband and his brother after looking around a while like idiots pulled a couple tables to add to what was already there. The restaurant was empty maybe 2-3 tables of guests, and it appeared as if there was no staff working. Long story short, drink orders took a painful 25 minutes and I should probably add that we weren't ordering handmade old fashion's, mai tai's, or martinis.... We're talking iced tea.... coke.... diet coke... You could feel the collective disappointment at the entire table as the ONE waitress working took our orders with disregard. 7 o'clock came and we noticed none of the tables around us that had been there longer than us had received their meals yet. My brother in law told the waitress that we did not have time to wait another 30 minutes for the food to come out. The waitress told him that she understood and that because of the inconvenience the drinks were on them and we could go ahead and go. Then the owner came out.... This guy had to be the most disrespectful guy I have ever seen. He was yelling at my brother in law in front of our entire family telling him \"What did we expect with a party of 13??? That the food would come out in 15 minutes?\" The answer to that would be yes when you take a reservation and you can expect a large party on a Saturday night. My husband has been in the industry for 12 years and when he approached the owner in defense of his brother, was asked where he worked Chili's or Applebee's? Do yourself a favor and steer clear of this establishment."}
{"text":"It was ok. We ordered it to go . Chicken kabobs were over cooked and hard. Beef kabob was alright. The plate was too expensive for that kind of food. I could have gotten better food for the same price at Persian room"}
{"text":"First time here.  Won't be the last by a long shot.  It was delicious... The hot tea was delish, the chutney was amazing, the salad was fresh and dressing just right, the garlic naan was fresh out of the oven, and the meat was perfectly spiced! We ordered the chicken and beef keemah.  I can't say enough. We shared the kabob platter ordered an extra salad and the naan. We had plenty of food and it was very reasonably priced.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"The chicken kabob and spinach rice was wonderful. Naan and red pepper hummus was also fantastic! Wonderful family owned restaurant with excellent service. Our waiter had a great personality with great beer suggestions. Will absolutely go back a again!"}
{"text":"Wife got the beef keemah, basmati rice and naan. I got the beef keemah and chicken keemah combo with rice and a salad. Also we ordered a side of grilled vegetables. I have to say these folks have something special here. Good spices in the meat. Rice was cooked to perfection. Naan was a bit on the charred side, I like that but wife does not. The sauce they gave is was delicious as well not what it was but it was green. Maybe parsley or spinach with a kick! We have not been to the actual location. So I am basing my 5 stars on the food being really good and being delivered in a timely manner. Considering it was 7-8pm on a Saturday night it took only 45 minutes. This was my first time ordering through an iPhone app and was sure I paid with a card. When the delivery person came they said it was cash. We didn't have the cash but assured him I would call it in right away. He said \"cool I trust you\" gave me the food and I gave him a fiver tip. Very nice young man. So I called in the card and all was saved!"}
{"text":"Love the take out from this place. I'm here once a week at least. The Leg of Lamb Kabob is truly amazing. The service is excellent and friendly. Came here the first time wanting something more flavorful than the normal restaurants in the area. Easily the best dinning choice in the area."}
{"text":"We just ate here and everything was delicious! We got samoas and put the amazing green and red chutney and white sauce all over them. So good. I got the gyro and hubby got the butternut squash dish. Everything was really tasty and perfect. We never had afghan food before. We will be back!"}
{"text":"It isn't often I feel like I could eat somewhere every day but truth be told the food here is some of the best I've ever eaten. The multiple times I have been there now I have not been disappointed.  Most recently I had the pleasure of tasting their chicken hummus pizza and it is of of the absolute best things I have eaten in my life. Everything tastes so fresh and the food has always come out hot.  But no business would be able to stand without its staff and that is one of the shining moments of my experience with this place. All but once I have gone in and been waited on by the server Alyssa and each of those times have been excellent. The one time I was not the service was still fabulous but I have unfortunately forgotten the male server's name.  Alyssa is a wonderful example of good customer service, she reads her customers very well and is quick to offer different options to those who seem unsure. Every time I have come in and asked her opinion I have not been disappointed. She is an amazing server and that service and the great food will definitely keep me coming back!  Oh and the last time I was in I found out you can have their food delivered through Grub Hub! Thanks again to the wonderful Miss Alyssa I can now have baklava delivered to my front door!"}
{"text":"I have been there a few times. But have seen the food quality dropped. This is a casual cafe type place. Not a restaurant to take a family to for a night out. However, the owner is really greedy. He charges 20% tip for party of 6+. AZ has a law now that the restaurant needs to EARN the tip, not impose it regardless of quality of food or service. We will NOT go back to place. Adios."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service.  They have live music which is a nice addition.   Make sure you ask for the red and green spices.  The owner brought them by and it added nice flavor to our food."}
{"text":"This is my second time eating here. I really like the food. It's fresh and so tasty.  I love the homemade hummus and especially the eggplant dish.  The prices are good also. I will go back."}
{"text":"WOW - This is a diamond in the rough!!  Its tucked away in a corner of the strip mall but the food is absolutely incredible.  The plates and wraps are HUGE and easily can be shared between two people.  Owner is friendly and really wants you to come back.  Naan is great, their specials are good.  I recommend this place highly!!!"}
{"text":"Me and my parents went to Rania today and the food was great!! My favorite food was the gyro and ashak. But today there wasn't really any people in there except for three other people. So it would be very helpful if you guys would recommend this place to a friend, so more people will come and try it.  :-)"}
{"text":"We had another amazing meal at Rania's last night.  Mr. M ordered the Cornish hen platter with spinach rice and I had the Beef Keemah and Chicken Keemah combo platter with the Kabuli-style rice.  I wanted to try a different small plate from the last time and we got the chicken samosas.  The outer crust is golden brown and flaky and the interior is stuffed with very flavorful chicken.  I'm not sure about the seasonings, but I swear I tasted a little curry and some cumin.  The owner came by to check on us and I tried to quiz him but he was very coy and rightfully so.  I wouldn't want to give it away either.  Lovely way to start the meal.  Mr. M's Cornish hen platter was just ridiculous.  We both attacked that like a couple of starving cavemen, no talking, just eating.  Grilled and seasoned perfectly and nice and juicy.  You know it's good when you order it and the server moans just thinking about it.  Our server, Jordyn, was really friendly and took great care of us.  I feel like a broken record, but my keemah platter was also deliciously seasoned and we ended up with lots of great leftovers to have for lunch today.    We did discover they have a handful of good beers on tap.  I believe last night our choices were Four Peaks 8th Street Ale & Kiltlifter, Mudshark Morning Buzz,  and Shock Top.  I also heard them say they have wine.  Next time I'm going to do that.  A glass of wine would be fantastic with these dishes.    We had a groupon which was taken care of no problem.  Total before the $20 groupon with a small plate, 2 platters, and 2 beers was $46.78.  Money well spent.  Already planning our next visit."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service, the owner sat down with me and we chatted about his restaurant, the rich Afghanistani culture and its origins. The beef kebab with spinach rice, diced Afghani style pico and garlic yogurt with a side of chicken samosas were just absolutely delicious!!! Happy with the choice. The menu had lamb shanks maybe I will be back to try them another day."}
{"text":"We have been wanting to try Rania's for some time- finally made it. Sooo glad we did! Food was excellent! Rich was our server and was great! We will most definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Yummy food at reasonable prices! There's much more than kabobs on the menu, too! I've been here several times and I keep trying something new. Today was all-you-can-eat fish. Yayy"}
{"text":"First time and everything was impressive! Hummus was smooth and the chicken and steak platter was juicy and flavorful! So glad we tried this place! A great healthier takeout option and close! Will definitely be going again soon!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the food is amazing and the service spectacular!! I ordered dinner to go, the second time in the same day I was eating their food, got the food home and short story was an incorrect order. I called the owner and within 30 minutes he had our entire order delivered to her home at no charge. Talk about customer service in a world where it is dying. So glad to have found this gem. You have loyal customers!"}
{"text":"It's was ok. I guess I am used to Indian food and while there were similarities, it is very different. The naan I did not care for. It was burnt. I'm not sure if that's normal for afghan food or not but I didn't care for it. The brown rice was not that great either--just heavy with oil I felt. The meat was divine and so tender.  My husband had one of their pizzas and that was really good. In fact I would come back to order that again.   Service was 5 stars! Right when we walked in we were greeted and given drinks. Food took a little time to get out to us but I was fine with that and our waitress even gave us baklava for free. I would go back--maybe the oven was having a bad day with the naan."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of dining at Rania's with my group last night. I had the sampler with hummus, chicken samosas, and the Afghan fries. The good was delicious and very well seasoned. The service was a little slow but nothing aggravating. If you're up for trying something new I highly recommend this place.   Sidenote: The leftovers including the Afghan fries reheat surprisingly well."}
{"text":"Your not exactly getting a great deal.  The combos are nothing special yet they are expensive.  the combos don't provide a lot when you consider the portion size either.    Overall I liked the food, the lamb is pretty good.  This is a nice place with good food and friendly servers but i wasn't impressed.  go elsewhere if your looking to get your moneys worth."}
{"text":"I love this place! I wasn't sure because I had never had Afghanistan food, but it is amazing. Spinach rice, garlic Naan bread, and jalapeno hummus are SOOOOO good.  Nice selection of craft beer too :-)"}
{"text":"Really great mediterranean food. This place does it right. Prepared with so much flavor, meat, tender and juicy, rice freshly made and not bland. So simplistically made and worth the money you pay. No bullshit, straight up quality middle eastern food, doubt you'll find any better in the area!"}
{"text":"I tried this restaurant out for the first time this evening and was very pleased with what I had. I ordered a soup, an appetizer and an entree and everything was very flavorful and cooked very well- without too many spices to overdo the flavor of the main course,  or to confuse the name of the dish by killing it with too many seasonings. The two ways that Middle Eastern, Thai, Indian, etc. food can be spoiled in my humble opinion are by over cooking the food until the vegetables are a ghost of their former selves or by adding too much oil to where you can't feel your lips anymore and need plenty of napkins. I experienced none of that here and the flavors were exceptional. Even the vegetable samosas came out very tasty without being overly oily and everything I had just hit the spot. I went in on a Sunday evening and it was slow, and the server even brought out a vegetarian dish for me to try on the house! Lots of flavor and went well with the bread that comes with the entree, served nice and warm.  There also have a few stuffed naan bread options that look really interesting for when you're in that comfort food type of mood. I'll definitely be going back again for sure :)"}
{"text":"Rania's is a hidden gem! I got take-out from here last night. The woman who took my order was having some technical difficulties, but she called me back three times to make sure that my order was complete.  I got the Sirloin Kabob Platter with Garlic Naan and a side of the Afghan Fries. It was too much food for one sitting, but would make a great meal for two.  This isn't that far removed from a Mediterranean grill-type food. Really delicious; I'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Boo!  They are not serving breakfast anymore on the weekends.  They had the best breakfasts around!  More comments -- look at all the great reviews this place gets, but their business is slow.  The owner thinks it might be their location or the client who prefer crap places like Ihop and Denny's.  He said he was thinking of moving the restaurant to a location where he would get more traffic.  I hope he does that instead of shutting down.  I would be extremely disappointed if he shut down cause I think this food is great!!"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good. Very fresh and flavorful. We both preferred the chicken breast over the sirloin.  The sirloin would get a 3.5, chicken breast 4.5, the rice basmati rice a 3.5, the condiments a 4.   The rating drops dramatically because of the service. They get a 1. It was flat out awful - to the point that my husband insisted on no tip (which we never do). We get far better service at Chick Fil A than we got here.   And FYI to all the lazy/cheap waiters, waitresses and business owners - if someone tells you they hate onions, they can taste when you've simply lifted the red onions off the lettuce on a salad. That wasn't their only misstep but amplified what already sucked. I wasn't happy that I had nasty onion taste in my mouth the rest of the night.   They'd do better to make this place an upscale fast food so we could refill our own drinks, get utensils, go to a counter for plates or return good prepared wrong (twice)  etc."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery. Came an hour and a half later. Fries were burned, soggy, and tasted like old oil. Barely any chicken in the wrap, and it wasn't very flavorful. My 12 year old didn't eat it and made mac n cheese instead. Super bummed!! I was excited to try it since there were such great reviews."}
{"text":"Tried the beef mantu, chicken samosa, beef keemah kabob, chicken kabob! So good. The restaurant was clean & the staff was super friendly!!"}
{"text":"Pros: DELICIOUS and actually spicy food! (make sure to let them know if you don't want things spicy! it can vary with what jalapenos they get too) Fast food prep Lovely wait staff Groupon if you're not sure if you want to commit, or if you know you want to commit! AYCE fish on Fridays is excellent top notch afghani salad great for groups kabuli rice is excellent, or get the spinach if you don't want to pay the extra $1 w/meat entrees they'll serve you late in the night if you tell them you're a student, 10% discounts!  Cons: the naan for delivery doesn't seem as fluffy and soft as the naan they serve in house  Fave entrees: meatballs, cauliflower (not on their online menu but just ask!), chicken hummus naan pizza"}
{"text":"Very good service, prices and food! The place is clean and the food is delicious. I got the chicken naanwich both times I was there. The last time I was there I got the Afghani ice cream. It was a very different dessert but very flavorful! Definitely one of my favorite local spots."}
{"text":"I had the lamb kabob with rice and my wife had the beef kabob.  Both were delicious and perfectly cooked.  The staff was very nice.  I am a transplant from the east coast and have yet to find decent meat on a stick here, especially lamb, but this took me back home.  It was really good and tasted authentic.  I would definitely recommend this place"}
{"text":"Holy YUM!!!! I got the beef and shrimp kabob platter with spinach rice. Meat was tender and shrimp perfectly cooked. Spinach rice was full of flavor. Too full to eat the cilantro jalape√±o hummus and naan bread but I will be taking it to work tomorrow because it is so delicious too. Delivery was faster than they said and my platter and naan was nice and hot. My new favorite place when ordering delivery. Can't wait to try other items on their menu."}
{"text":"Not bad, but a little pricier than other kabob places. Loved the spinach and squash side dishes. Overall, good if you don't have time to drive to another kabob place and have to have it now, but not my first choice. Naan is terrific!"}
{"text":"Great food. Rude manager. We've been coming here since they opened. The owner has always been wonderful which is why I didn't rate less stars.  We've always had positive experiences and we've referred so many friends.    Tonight we ordered from GrubHub. I specifically asked that the pico be substituted for extra white sauce since the sandwiches usually each come with white sauce and pico on the side. Soon after my order, someone called me and said that the pico usually comes on the sandwich and asked if I still wanted extra white sauce. I told him that I would just have the regular three that come with the sandwiches since we order three sandwiches. They said they'd be happy to throw in one for free. I thought that was great. We were quoted our food being delivered between 6:53-7:03. Our food wasn't delivered until around 7:30. I was fine with that. Whatever. Things happen and it's a Saturday night. Well, when the food was finally delivered the delivery man left very quickly. I came inside and checked the bags. We had no white sauce at all. I quickly called the store and was put on hold for a good five or six minutes. I explain the situation to the girl and she put me on hold again. Then I spoke to who I assume was the manager. He's very rude and condescending. He kept telling me the sandwiches never come with white sauce. We've been ordering from GrubHub from Rania's  for a long time and it has always come with them. I feel like he was just making up stuff and trying to make me feel stupid. At that moment I thought, I will never order from this place again. He asked what I wanted to have done and I said that I'd like some white sauce. He then told me it would be about an hour and a half before they could deliver it. I told him that was fine. About 10 minutes later he calls me up and he asks how many of the white sauces I wanted, I told him 3 since he told me they were no longer included in the meal and that I have to pay for each of them. He wanted to make sure he knew how many white sauces to charge me for so he could update my order on GrubHub. About 10 minutes later the same delivery driver showed up, apparently he had forgotten the white sauces in his car when he delivered our food to me. He was very apologetic and nice. I understand that he had been busy before, and things happen. I feel like the delivery driver handled things the right way. Please let me know once the manager has been fired so we can start coming back. Thank you."}
{"text":"My first visit I had the cheese and spinach samosa an order of wings and naan food was excellent service was squirley  the waitress seamed pissy at first when i walked in and then became a little more cordial as my dining experience went on . so the other nite i decided to get food to go i phoned my order in ordering a repeat of my lunch the young ladies working were very nice but  when i got home no samosas but a spinich and cheese dish which was delicious but not what i ordered when i called the restaurant to tell them she was appoligetic and ask me if i would like to come back for the samosas i declined she said she would have the manager call me but he never did ......BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE PEOPLE ........ok that aside the food is delicious but need to work on people skills"}
{"text":"Had to be in this area today so we checked Yelp for interesting, well-rated restaurants and found this gem. Our server was great and really helped out with making menu choices. We'd never had Afghan food before--one of the reasons we chose to eat at Rania's. So we ended up with the sampler plate, choosing Bolzano, Beef Mantu and Chicken Samosa. Also had the chicken breast kabobs with spinach rice. The food was uniformly outstanding. The spices used imbued the food with amazing flavor. Wish this restaurant was in the north valley. Great food--try it! If we get over this way again we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. Took a chance and got a groupon to try it again out. So glad I did! How did I not know what naan bread and chutney was? The garlic jalape√±o Naan bread was the bomb. Spinach rice and kabobs...so tasty. Then I discovered lemon Huss beer on tap there and that sealed the deal. Friendly staff and is a perfect casual dining experience"}
{"text":"I would definitely give 5 stars if the wait staff was better. Delicious food, especially eggplant and butternut squash borani. The wait staff is just bad. So far my last 3 visits were the same. Very slow service; doesn't matter if it's busy or not! My guest and I ordered at the same time but he received his food way before I got mine. He was just sitting there and starring at his food because he didn't want to be rude and start eating without me. it happened couple times."}
{"text":"First time I heard about this place it has just opened up. I got a groupon and took my son in a Sunday lunch. We ordered two dishes. My son got chicken and beef platter. I got leg of lamb. I absolutely love afghani kabuli pilau. They made it perfectly. Only place I had this better was in Fremont California where they have 5-6 afghani restaurants within couple of blocks (mini afghan area).  Service was really great and attentive.  I came back few times and was impressed every time. They seem to be doing deliveries too. I have used take out option too. Very kids friendly. Portion sizes are really generous and prices really decent. Best part is quality of food. Beef kafta is always moist and naan are tender and fluffy. You can't stop eating them when they serve them fresh. Must go if you like gyro and afghani food."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. Waiter was well informed of the food and was able to make recommendation to us. I've never had afghani food before but I thought the quality of the food was very good and it tasted delicious. They bake their own fresh naan bread which tastes absolutely great. The restaurant is clean and the food comes out within the right amount of time. The prices are also very reasonable. For two meals (which come with one side of either naan or salad each) and hot tea at the end, the bill was less than $30! That's excellent! Definitely coming here again. My husband and I enjoyed the food very much!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and great service! We had the a giant beef meatball on a bed of spinach rice and also Raina's gyro that came with the spinach rice as well. We also had a side of garlic naan bread. All was very good! Play around with the two sauces that they set down on the table."}
{"text":"The samosas are super delicious at Rania's! Food tastes fresh and made from scratch! Win!!!"}
{"text":"Simple, yet so good! I have been several times now and it never disappoints! Everything I have tried here have been solid and everyone I bring here always enjoys it! You can't go wrong with anything here, it just depends on personal preference on what type of meat you like.   I normally opt for the sirloin kabob. Or if I'm really hungry, I'll get the double kabob combo with sirloin & chicken. My BF always gets the cornish hen, which comes in a huge platter! My brother loves their lamb kabobs. Whatever you decide will be great, just make sure to order spinach rice with it! This rice is soooo bomb and I'm asian and love my rice so - yes, take my word for it! There are two chutneys, red or green, I prefer the green cilantro one rather than the red pepper one. Their pita bread is very good, too. It always comes out hot and it's nice and fluffy- not your plain 'ol average pita bread.  Sadly the location can be hidden. It's located in a non-descriptive shopping plaza and it doesn't seem to get a lot of foot traffic. Please come try it and spread the word! I would hate for this place to close!"}
{"text":"Was in town for work and decided to stop by here. Got the chicken breast kabob and it was excellent. The chicken was flavored well and cooked perfectly with very little fat on it. I also got the Kabuli Rice and it was pretty good. What really made it memorable was the excellent service that we received. Seriously, the lady was so attentive and friendly. It was incredibly refreshing to see. Will definitely come back here when I'm in Phoenix again."}
{"text":"My bf and I decided to come here based on the reviews, we walked in and weren't sure if we were supposed to seat ourselves or order at the bar. The employees just stared at us so we decided to walk up to the bar and ask if we should just sit down. The lady said yes and so we did. Waited about 5 minutes for her to come greet us and about another 5 to ask for drinks. We then waited about 10 mins to order (granted there are only about three tables with people at the time). It took 45 mins from the time we walked in to the point when we got our appetizer (hummus) while the hummus was very good, we only got two pieces of bread, and when we asked for more she replied \"would you like another order\" $8 for a cup of hummus and two pieces of bread. No.   Anyway, we waited about another 15 mins for our entr√©es, fries were burned and the wraps/sandwiches were not terrible. I'm writing this as I am sitting down STILL waiting for my water to get refilled for the first time. No napkins, no utensils were given to us, my bf waited at the front waiting for someone to help him out and ended up reaching for napkins behind the kitchen. When my water was finally filled, she asked if everything was okay because she saw him standing up front. Yeah, thanks.  Will not be returning here, really tried to like this place but customer satisfaction is clearly not their priority."}
{"text":"First off, this place deserves 5 stars for just being a mom & pop restaurant in the East Valley. That Rania's serves authentic tasting Afghan cuisine out in no mans land ... well that's a minor miracle.  I laugh at the some of the low star reviews, whats your comparison. The McRib! I mean really, you had better ... Where ...................? Tools!  If you consider yourself a foodie get your butt over here and check this fantastic cuisine out.  They even have Four Peaks & Santan Beers on Tap.   Awesome!"}
{"text":"Delicious!    Very tasty, authentic food. Gyro platter was delicious!  Family run, homey and comfortable.  Great service, very friendly owner.  Would definitely eat here again and would recommend to others."}
{"text":"Got the sampler plate (beef mantu, hummus, and eggplant) and the butternut squash borani with naan and kabuli rice. My favorite was the eggplant and naan! Service was very friendly."}
{"text":"Friendly and the food was delicious!  My mother is gluten/dairy free and I'm allergic to citrus. They were very accommodating!"}
{"text":"We happened to find this Afghani restaurant on Yelp and decided to give it a try. Walked in and noticed right away it was nice, big and clean. Immediately greeted by someone and asked to be seated anywhere we decided.  We always ask what they recommend and was told the lamb is to die for. So, I ordered the lamb naanwhich, which came with a salad or rice of your choice. Went w a salad and their house dressing. The naanwhich is like a gyro pita but they toast the naan and wrap it like a sandwich wrap. So it's nice and crispy and the lamb was so flavorful, Non- gamey tasting. Comes with a white sauce and I mixed it with the green sauce they bring to the table. It was to die for!  Hubby opted for a salad with gyro meat and said was really delicious!  It was so good, we decided to go back the very next night with our roommate! I know I should've tried something else but got the same thing since I was craving it all day! Our friend went with the keemah kabob w rice, pico and naan. Keemah is ground beef w jalape√±o , also came with white sauce. Hubby went with the keemah special naanwhich, so GOOD!  For dessert we had the pistachio/ mint ice cream topped with whipped cream, sprinkled w cardamom- SO delicious!!!   Flynn, the manager, waited on us and had a great sense of humor! Had fun chatting with him during dinner! Thanks, Flynn, for taking good care of us!!!  We HIGHLY recommend this place! We'll be back for sure!!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. That had a homemade touch it used fresh real ingredients made from scratch nothing processed or artificial. Probably one of the best Meddeteranian/afghan restaurant that I have visited I'm so happy with everything from the quality of the food, to the service, and the loyal owners that took the time  to come out and ask for feed back. If there was a rating above 5 I would happily choose that. Definitely will come back AND HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS EXOTIC PLACE"}
{"text":"Love this place. Been here for lunch and dinner. Great chicken breast, tender....excellent rice options...Love both kinds of rice...wonderful portions. Good authentic family cooking...No chain restaurant! Service a bit slow, but worth the wait!"}
{"text":"It's been a cold and rainy day, and we didn't want to go out for real food. This is the first time trying this place, and it was really good. This place is American Greek, but still worth a try for Gilbert! I ordered online via the Eat24 app and there was a little snafu, but they took care of it and the refund was processed immediately! We will definitely try this place again and you should too!!!!!  :)"}
{"text":"Another trip to Rania's....another wonderful culinary experience. The n'aan bread is sooooo good and the chicken entrees are delicious. Dennis is a pro server who delivers the wonderfully prepared dishes. I had chicken keema with spinach rice. Oy vey!!!! Goooood! I can't say enough good things about Rania's Kabob Grill!!!!!"}
{"text":"This girl I met kept raving about this place so I finally came to check it out for dinner. Worse experience ever!!! As soon as we walked in the door everything just started to go downhill. I tried to be reasonable and understandable that things like this can happen but I don't know....it was just bad. First I asked for water with lemons. I got my water then 30 minutes later the waiter brought us new water cups with lemons in them? I asked the waiter what's the difference between Cornish hen kebob and the other chicken kebob dishes they had he said corn hen isn't chicken and he's not really sure that usually people get chicken breast kebob. Obviously he does not know the menu and apparently hen is not a chicken! Lol! We ordered the combo plate (chicken BREAST & beef) and waited for awhile. While waiting we noticed that a lot of customers were just disappointed in the lack of service. One family even left saying this is redic! So we even watched our order go to a different table & and this little girl put her hands all over it and the waiter brought it back to our table saying it's ours! We told him we don't want that...can u please take it back and make a new one....! He gave us this look like why? So it took 15 minutes and we got our new chicken & rice and the beef kebob came out separately 10 minutes later. It looked like there were only 2 cooks in the kitchen so the food was not great. I definitely felt like they were in a hurry to make our dish. I even over heard the girl waitress getting the orders messed up with another table and she asked them their order again saying sorry I'm new, it's my 4th day here. Now...I was just reading some previous Yelp reviews and someone mentioned the same waitress using this same excuse like 21 days ago!!!!!!!! Overall this place was so disappointing I would not go back!"}
{"text":"There food is pretty great. It's like some Mediterranean and some middle eastern food I've had, but different. Especially the bread. It's hard to describe it but regardless of it's familiarity or lack there of, the lamb shank was tender and savory and the kebob plate was perfectly cook. A very enjoyable experience for sure."}
{"text":"I tried this out because I got a $20 groupon for $11 and am a sucker for fresh naan!  We tried a sampler of small plates of which the spinach somosas was the hands down best.  The beef kabob was flavorful  but over cooked and dry.   It's a new establishment and they have some kinks to work out but some of the favors are amazing. ...but a tad heavy on cilantro for me."}
{"text":"Nice clean roomy place.  We had a glass of red and white wine, lamb shank, and lamb kabobs and beef skewer.  The food was good, especially the lamb shank.  The beef skewer was a bit tough.  The white wine was old and stale but they replaced the glass so that worked out.  Will go back.  Server did a nice job too,"}
{"text":"Had the chicken breast kabob and garlic naan. So good! Everything was well cooked, seasoned and delicious. Loved the red pepper-haba√±ero and cilantro-jalape√±o chutneys too. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Very good food and friendly staff. We had the chicken shwarma wrap. Be sure to check GROUPON for deals before going."}
{"text":"This restaurant has gone backwards in just a matter of months. They mist have changed cooks...their food lacks flavor and the portion sizes have decreased immensely. I won't be returning here."}
{"text":"The place is clean, and plates are plentiful, the service is excellent and the Ashak plate is delicious!"}
{"text":"Great food, good service. My chicken dish was amazing, and their Spanish rice is absolutely delicious. I would absolutely recommend this place for some amazing middle-eastern cuisine."}
{"text":"Terrible Manager But Awesome Waitress  On my first time eating here. I found the place through Groupon and likely wouldn't have ever found it otherwise as I seldom if ever would be in that particular location to see it.   Most notably was my waitress who seemed to float around the room with a permanent honest smile on her face. It is a pleasure to do business at a place with such a glowing person radiating happiness towards others.  For food info see my last review.  I had bought a 3 pack of groupons here and they are about to expire, so I rounded up a friend to use them up up before they expired.   The manager came out and with absolute rudeness called me names and told me thanks for trying to scam and use 2 on a single visit.   I told him they were expiring and he was super rude.... Not a single care was given by the owner, not even courtesy.   I will not go back here ever again unless this guy is gone. I'm guessing he is part of the family that runs it as his yelp profile that contacted me says owner, so that's not likely.  I would recommend the other Lebanese places around the valley where the service is great!"}
{"text":"From truly awesome to just OK in only a few months.  I've been going to Rania's since they opened, and the changes have both come fast and been disappointing.  Yes, the kabobs are still tasty, the spinach rice is excellent, and the bread is first-rate.  So, now it's basically the same as every other kabob house around town. What USED to set Rania's apart was their salad bar.  It had fresh greens, grilled vegetables, mushrooms, olives, red and green peppers, garlic, and excellent dressings.. and now it's GONE! Now, if you order salad with your meal, you get a saucer-sized plate with a handful of lettuce, a bit of red cabbage, some shaved carrot and a couple of tomato wedges.  There isn't even any dressing on it.  That excellent salad bar was, for me, what set Rania's apart from every other kabob house in the area. They haven't changed their menu to reflect the disappearance of the salad bar, so it must be a recent change.   Additionally, the waiter got my order wrong, and brought me the chicken kabob, rather than the combo chicken and beef platter.  When I pointed it out, he \"added\" the beef kabob to my tab, making the total three dollars more than the combo platter price.  When I looked at the bill and asked to see the menu again, he magically remembered that he had over-charged me.  As it turns out, he was just too lazy to fix the original check, so he tried to get away with the add-on.   All in all, this last visit was an epic fail.  I have two more groupons, and sadly, it'll be adios to Rania's.  Too bad, they had a really good thing going for a while there."}
{"text":"The Afghan Iced Tea w/Cardamom and the Chicken Qorma was good! You can easily tell ingredient/meat quality is superb and that recipes are an accurate portrayal of the culture and not heavily Westernized like too many ethnic restaurants in the Valley. The service really stands out and our server did a fantastic job of refilling drinks/naan, and suggesting dishes to try."}
{"text":"1. Dennis, Waitperson, is awesome, GREAT product knowledge and service delivery; 2. The food is GOOD.  Fresh and tasty, with interesting spice palets (Afghan, Indian and Mediterranean).  Standouts: chicken samosas, Afghan \"pico\", the various naan breads, the white dipping sauce.  Special mention: the habanero and the jalapeno chutneys.  Would I eat there again?  YES."}
{"text":"So we went in for dinner last night instead of delivery, and as much as I like having it come to me going in was the superior choice.  Afghani tea is amazing (especially since I drank an entire pitcher alone, and would again if given the chance), bollani was delicious, and my pizza even though they didn't have any feta cheese was great (I think I might order without anyway from now on).  I love naan already but having it brought out fresh and my own pizza made with it, fantastic!  This review is jumbled and doesn't make much sense as I'm still overwhelmed with how much I enjoyed this but this update was necessary after the evening we had.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"Great food, but they are consistently out of the food my wife will eat (vegetarian).  Very disappointing when you are excited for delivery time.  Guess we will say goodbye."}
{"text":"Service is lacking tremendously. Came in with 4 adults and 3 kids, moved tables together ourselves in the empty restaurant, though any server would have herself ... Had a manager of some sort come by to ask if a server had been by and we answered no - she came out and was terrible. She looked more confused than my 9 yr old son was about the menu. I did thank the chef personally and do think they need more signage for business. Food was good, chef was good, service was awful. The end."}
{"text":"I crave this all the time. I've never had anything I didn't love. The pizzas are awesome and the chicken kebabs.... yessss."}
{"text":"I love this place. I've been here a few times and have only tried three menu options. So far my favorite is the fried fish with spinach basmati rice but the chicken kabobs were tasty too. Everything tastes so fresh! I wish I could use the spicy cilantro jalape√±o chutney as toothpaste. The portions are huge as well. Very clean and updated decor. The servers are great and know the menu. Jordyn was very helpful.  I hope the word gets out on this delicious jem. It is officially a spot I plan to enjoy weekly. Plus, they offer delivery!"}
{"text":"Everything was delicious!!  We had the sampler so we could try everything and pick our favorites!  Well we loved it all!  The sirloin and spinach rice with the green sauce were definitely my favorites!  Also love the mint sauce!  The service was great as well and fast!  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place out for a while finally did tonight. Bummed we didn't try it sooner. Sooooooo good. I'm currently eating a Paleo diet with can make eating out tough since it calls for just proteins, vegetables, and fruit that is prepared with out frying with all natural ingredients  (this is a simplified explanation) . This place had me covered (though those who like rice and pita your good to go here too). Great flavors, made fresh to order, and great costumer service. Super fresh salad bar with lots of healthy options. Try this place, you'll be happy you did."}
{"text":"A place that delivers in Gilbert? Yes, yes, yes!!! I wasn't certain while using the app for delivery whether it was accurate or not. I've spent the past 9 months in Gilbert with very limited delivery options. When I say limited, I mean, there's been but a couple pizza joints to order from.  I'm not really a pizza enthusiast so, I've starved many late nights for this reason.   I always check just to see if there have been changes. Well, two places apparently deliver. In my disbelief, first thing I did was call to check since they appeared to be a little ways away. The gentleman was very kind on the phone in confirming they'd come out to us. I used the app to place my order because I feel it's much easier that way. Therefore I was basing it off of the menu on here. I ordered samosas for the kid, a combo beef shrimp kabob platter for the man, a side of kabuli style rice and the vegetable qorma. I was so excited! Within minutes I received a call from the restaurant to inform me they no longer served the vegetable qorma, and so went with the spinach qorma instead.  Honestly, the call alone was a very noble move on their end. Not to mention, I just checked to see what it was that I ordered and it appears that the menu has already been updated on the Yelp app so, kudos for that as well!  Although the wait time was closer to the 75 minute mark, the order arrived still hot and correct.   That rice? So so so so so good! I didn't try much of anyone else's dishes and can't speak to much more other than they looked appealing and no one complained. The 7 year old didn't even make a stink about this foreign item that she devoured. I may have skipped the extra side had I realized my dish came with some but I had it today, four days later, for lunch and it was still off the chain.   We will definitely order from here again and I will definitely tell all of the neighbors about the place!"}
{"text":"Rania's is amazing! Everything that I have tried I have loved. Chicken hummus naan pizza, gyros naan sandwich, samosas, lamb kabobs. All of those are excellent and I'm sure everything else on their menu is just as good.  They are very friendly and have great service. I HIGHLY recommend this restaurant to anyone. I will definitely be returning soon."}
{"text":"This was our first and probably last visit. We placed a takeout order with a teenage, blonde cashier who was \"interesting\"..to say the least. My boyfriend asked for a lid to his to go cup and she asked him if he could be patient (in a sarcastic tone)-yikes! Anyone who reads my reviews knows I'm big on service so that gets a 1 star in my book. The food took forever and when we got home they forgot his bread and gave me a dry chicken salad with nothing more then lettuce, tomatoes, onions and cucumbers..deconstructed sandwich? The portions were on the small side for the price. Not impressed."}
{"text":"We went here only because the restaurant we specifically travelled to was closed but wow were we glad that it was!   Food: I honestly don't remember what I ate (probably not helpful lol) but our party was adventurous and ordered a bunch of stuff we never heard of and all I remember was everything was exquisite, delicious, and tasted authentic.   Prices: Appropriate.   Atmosphere: Inviting. And I appreciate the fact that they played music that reflected Afghani culture as opposed to Lil Jon or something thats not even Middle Eastern.  Service: Attentive, friendly, refreshing."}
{"text":"I went to Rania's kind of by accident yesterday although a friend had previously reccomended it. The bottom line is I can't wait to go back!  I decided to try the Lamb Kabob with the Spinach rice. Great portion, full of flavor, tender pretty much describes it. Also, spend the extra 50 cents for the garlic Naan bread, it's well worth it.  The service service was excellent. The young man waiting on me knew the menu and kept the water glasses full. (Those are my pet peeves).  As always it's nice when the owner comes out of the kitchen to greet his customers.   Looking over the lunch menu it's tuly a great value.  Next visit I will definitley get the Lamb Shanks.  Well done folks!"}
{"text":"Great place for dinning. The food was great and I recommend the humus and short rib plate. The atmosphere was very family like and the service was great. I had a big appeitte and it was sastified at Rainas. I totally recommend."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic!  5 well earned stars. Used Grub Hub online to place the order for the first time and for only $4 + tip, I had the feast brought to me. Well worth the cost for the convenience.  I ordered lamb chops and requested they be cooked medium and they were PERFECT!  They were mild and perfectly spicy. My Girlfriend ordered the fried fish, which was their daily special. Might have been the best fish I've ever eaten. It was cooked perfect. The Nan bread was great. Tasted homemade. So soft and flavourful.  They have a few rice options and we went with seasoned brown basmati. Again, perfectly cooked. I've never had rice so good and I've had shrimp fried rice,  so that's a bold statement lol. This restaurant is definitely in our list of favorites!  Highly recommend! One final note; I've read other Yelp reviews stating the food was a little too salty. I called them shortly after placing my order on Grub Hub and requested little to no salt and clarified my request that my chops be cooked medium (lamb chops are my fav). The young lady I spoke with was very friendly and everything turned out perfect. Just enough salt and chops were a perfect medium (open flame too). Maybe the best delivery order we've ever made."}
{"text":"The food had  amazing favor.  I ordered the chicken thigh kabob platter and the chicken was tender and juicy.  Everything we ordered that day was very good!!"}
{"text":"Great food. In the area on business and saw the good reviews. It lived up, food was excellent and the nan bread was delicious as well. Service was fast. I would go back!"}
{"text":"Good food, good vibe and great service! I'll definitely come back. I'm not a huge fan of middle eastern food but this was awesome!"}
{"text":"This place is a must try. I'm a repeat customer and I've never had a bad experience. The service is great and the food is phenomenal. One of my favs!"}
{"text":"Fantastic, friendly service and tasty food.  I finally made it here after wanting to for a while. Rania's is in a strip mall next to a newly-built hospital. There doesn't seem to have been much around it previously. It's a bit of a rough gem out in the middle of not-so-much. The interior of the restaurant is big, open, and spacious. There are a number of tables and booths, as well as several TVs on the wall. I came here with my mom on a Sunday evening. There weren't many people sitting in the restaurant, although a few came in as we dined, but there were a number of people coming in to make and pick up to go orders. The place seems to be somewhat popular, and we found out why with the food.  The service was fantastic. This may have had to do with the fact that the owner himself was doing the service as it turned out, and he was very courteous and friendly. He gave us plenty of attention and was more than happy to describe some of the items on the menu to us. The food we ordered came up pretty quickly and was nice and hot when it got to us.  I had the chicken thighs kabob plate, and my mom had a combo plate with chicken and steak. The chicken was spiced nicely and was decently tender and juicy. The steak was a bit overcooked, but it was still good. The plates come with a little cucumber salad, some yogurt sauce, your choice of rice, and naan or salad. The rice options are pretty good: you can get white, brown, or Kabuli-style rice. The Kabuli-style rice includes carrots and raisins, so of course I got that one (it's an extra charge of $1.50, I believe). I was a little disappointed in how dry the rice was, but I still enjoyed it. The naan was piping hot when it came out. I had not previously had naan like this--it was very light and flaky on the inside and a little crunchy on the outside. It made for a good delivery system for the chicken on my plate. Everything on our plates was good, and there was plenty of it!  In addition to the plates, there are a number of \"naanwiches\" that are very reasonably priced. They likely make really good lunch options. I also saw signs for breakfast. I'm intrigued by what might be on the menu for that.  I heard the owner talking about how good the lamb shanks are. Next time, that will likely be what I order. And there will indeed be a next time!"}
{"text":"Great food. Love the eggplant and the fish. The chutney is delish as is the naan bread. Recommend as a great hole in the wall spot."}
{"text":"Ate their for the first time with a Groupon. Had the special meatballs that we're good. What amazed me was how delicious the rice an naan bread was.... Like I couldn't stop eating it. I will absolutely go back again"}
{"text":"Great place. I really enjoyed the menu. Service was great. They really promote delivery etc. I am a few miles a way, but they said that I was too far away. Just a heads up."}
{"text":"Great food. Friendly. Flexible. I had the lamb and the special meatballs. Oh, and the spinach qorma. My brother made me try the chicken kebab. I'm not usually a fan of chicken. It was amazing. All very tasty!"}
{"text":"We tried Ranias tonight for dinner. The food was really good love the brown rice also the jalepeno chutney Yummy. I had the steak kabob and my husband has the pan fried fish both were very good, We shared a vegetarian mushroom dish liked the salad bar and the naan bread. It's kind of a quiet place and didn't seem that busy. Which is a shame because the food and service are good."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night with my girlfriend and had quite a lot. We ordered the cornish hen, lamb with rice and the spinach bolani. This was my first time near afghani food and let me say this was the most delicious experience I have ever had. The lamb was the most tender I have ever had and the spice of the chutney was something new to me. This place is fantastic on the wallet and even better on the stomach and soul!"}
{"text":"Great service, mediocre food.  I went here based off many of the yelp reviews and was not impressed.  The chicken kabob lunch was nothing to write home about.  The waiter just focused on up selling.  Would not go back anytime soon."}
{"text":"The food is very tasty. The wings, kabobs and chutney are my favorite. We also tried the naan bread, Afghani iced tea, and samosas. Everything tasted good. We'll definitely be eating here often."}
{"text":"Second time here and not disappointed! The server was friendly and made some recommendations. We order the family meal (I don't remember exactly the name on the menu) but it was for 4 to 6 peoples, we were just 3 and it was just perfect for us. We finished everything, everything had a different flavor and the meats were really tender and really tasty! Good place for lunch !"}
{"text":"If I had friends visiting Phoenix, and they wanted some good food, regardless of locale, regardless of price, I'd take them to Rania's! The food here is so tasty you'll keep shaking your head back and forth, muttering \"Wow, I can't believe how good this is!\"  Be sure to start out with the samosas, either veggie or chicken, they're both incredible."}
{"text":"We LOVE!! the food here, hence the 3 stars.  But the service is getting worse. I wish they would hire a legit waiter.. we called to order our food which was a terrible experience, then we got restaurant and the waiter got got our order wrong. Blaming us for the confusion.   Also, I wish they updated their prices online."}
{"text":"Really delicious! We had the lamb gyro with Kabuli rice and the lamb was very well seasoned and juicy. Yogurt dip and habanero chutneys were also delicious and had a nice kick to it. Just be careful to not ask for any changes on the menu because they will charge you an arm and a leg for it without telling you. ($2 extra to change to grilled veggies/salad/Kabuli rice) and $1.50 extra for cheese."}
{"text":"I stumbled on this place by chance and I LOVE getting takeout on my way home from work. The eggplant bourani is my favorite along with kabuli rice. Excellent vegetarian options that are flavorful and very satisfying. My husband loves the chicken kabobs. Rich was our server tonight (we happened to dine in) and he is so attentive and good. The times we have dined in have always been met with service that by far exceeds expectations. Check this place out, you'll be happy you tried it."}
{"text":"I had the lamb Naanwich with feta. It was excellent. Other plates we had were Veggie Naanwich, and eggplant pizza. All we very good and the cilantro based pico sauce was very good. We'll be back."}
{"text":"It pains me to write this because I've loved this place for years, but it's been on a steady decline for a while now. I'm not sure sure if the ownership changed hands, but whoever is making the executive decisions is doing this place a great disservice.   Firstly. No naan bread. The last 3 times I went in there was no naan bread. \"the oven is broken.\"  \"we just turned the oven on\" etc are the excuses I was presented with. Why is this unacceptable? Because the naan makes the meal. It's why many people go there and frankly not having it ruined my meal. I'd have rather went elsewhere. It's what sets ranias apart.  Naan bread is the main attraction and should be treated as such.   Stop calling your \"wraps\" naanwiches if you don't plan on serving them with naan bread anymore. It's misleading. At least put that in the description. When someone goes to an establishment they've been eating at for years and orders something they've ordered a hundred times before to find out there's no naan on the naan which and now it's wrapped in an inferior carbohydrate vessel, it's disappointing.   On top of that there was 6-7 un bussed tables in the middle of the day. No customers, it wasn't busy, yet tables sitting around with plates of food on them.   The manager that's been there for months, is also horrible. Seems angry, or bothered. Is terrible as a waiter, screwed up orders multiple times.   I hope the owners read this and take it to heart. The place was much better when father and son ran it. I hope they can get it back to the way it was. The only good element that remains is the cook. That guy is a hard worker and what food we did receive was good as ever."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised at this place, wasn't sure what to expect. Had the lamb and chicken kabobs with spinach rice.. Really good! I stopped in to get this to go, service was quick and I didn't want long. Spinach and cheese samosa are great too. I'll definitely go back for more!"}
{"text":"The food was good, very flavorful. Bread was okay nothing too different. Kabobs were tasty but was expecting more spice."}
{"text":"My wife and I LOVE this place! She is Afghan and definitely approves of the cuisine. Service is very friendly, the atmosphere is warm and welcoming. The food is fresh and as we were informed by Margaret our server, completely house-made. We will definitely be returning as often as possible!"}
{"text":"i have never eaten anything worse than this, it dose even taste like food and the service is so bad. the owner there just kept  ignoring me."}
{"text":"I really, reeeally wanted to love this place. I drove 15 minutes each way for take out, which is kind of far in my opinion. I called my order in and got vegetable samosas and kabob with garlic naan. When I got there they were semi-busy, but I had to remind the girl handing me my food to put in my samosas. Strike one.   I drove all the way home and bit into a samosa only to find they were chicken and not the veggie that I had ordered. Strike two.  The food was good, don't get me wrong. But it wasn't something I think I would ever crave, especially not for takeout with the drive. There are so many other (better) options closer that are cheaper as well. I will say the garlic naan was delicious. Sorry, Rania's..."}
{"text":"Better waitress than the first time. Ordered Rania's gyro instead of the gyro platter... MUCH better option for me. Fabulous visit and I will come again and again. Such amazingly flavorful food! !!"}
{"text":"I have been craving afghan food since getting back from Afghanistan in 2013 and this seriously hit the spot.  Had the Beef Keemah with Kabuli rice.  The beef was well seasoned, the perfect level of spicy and the yogurt sauce was a great complement.  The naan was warm/fresh and the Kabuli rice was just as sweet as I remember.  Will definitely return if I'm in the area again"}
{"text":"After reading the Yelp reviews and looking at the mouth watering pictures, my Hubby and I decided to support local business and try Rania's for lunch today.  Yelpers are right and Rania's lives up to all the hype. The service was exceptional and so was the food! We have never tried Afghan cousine so, with the exception of Kabobs/Naan/Hummus, we weren't familiar with the menu items and it doesn't help that the descriptions of the menu items ALL sound delicious! With the help of our super friendly & patient  server and I believe the owner/manager, Wally, we had an excellent meal- he provided us with some awesome recommendations!   With Wally's recommendation, we started off with the Beef Mantu and Spinach/Cheese Samosa... All I can say is Oh.My.Goodness!! The Beef Mantu is incredibly delicious, I could seriously eat an entire bowl of it and will definitely be back for seconds! The Samosa was also delicious and my Hubby & I both appreciated that the spinach was the star of the dish. I ordered the Chicken Breast Kabob platter with spinach rice and garlic naan... again, Oh.My.Goodness! The  chicken was tender, juicy, and had a great flavor to it- in addition to the rice & naan the dish is also accompanied by an \"afghan pico\" (a pico de gallo using cucumber in place of jalapeno) and a delicious yogurt sauce. The flavors alone are yummy but my mind was blown when I put the rice, chicken, pico, and sauce on the naan, seriously sooooo good! My Hubby had the lamb shank, also recommended by Wally. Again, completely delicious. In addition to the lamb shank, he had the kabuli rice and jalapeno naan. The lamb shank is braised in this amazing tomato sauce/gravy and is fall off the bone delicious! The gravy was so delicious that my Hubby asked for a container of it to go! lol! The naan is homemade, fluffy, and yummy!   Rania's has been only open for a year and Wally told us about some pretty exciting things they are going to be doing. Support local business, try something new and give Rania's a try! If you are like us and not sure what to order from the menu, just ask Wally :)"}
{"text":"Oh my word! Just tried this place for the first time tonight and am in love! The food is so so so so so so good! It's very filling and I couldn't finish even half my meal. I got the Veggie Griller Naanwich (minus the eggplant and mushrooms) and it was soooo good! The sauce they use with it made me want to keep eating it. So flavorful and so yummy! 5 stars!!! :)!! I'd give more if I could! I loved it! Authentic and tasty. Great place all around!"}
{"text":"Sitting here in the restaurant realizing that I couldn't have been more satisfied with any other meal on the planet right now. We started off with a sampler platter with samosas, beef mantu, and chicken with jalape√±o hummus. My husband and I were shocked that we both felt this was the best hummus either of us had ever tasted. Scouts honor it was just damn good!  My husband had the afghani meatballs which he said were delicious. My kabob platter of chicken thighs and shrimp was absolutely amazing! The shrimp was plump and perfectly cooked. It was just a beautiful plate of food--that I inhaled.  Customer service was so warm and welcoming tonight. Flynn must be a manager, as he made his way around the dining room and greeted customers. He was very interested in our feedback and gave us information on other dishes. Aaliyah was our server and such a sweetheart! They both took care of us and made sure we loved everything. We frequently order delivery from here, but dining in is the way to go. The presentation paired with the music makes this a lovely experience after a long day."}
{"text":"One of the best places I've eaten at in AZ!!!  Allow the server to order for you !!! Leave room for dessert."}
{"text":"Great food, great service and the portions are definitely substantial for a great price.    We loved the naan and the red pepper hummus.  For our entree we both ordered gyros and were only able to finish half, since the size was about double of what you would get anywhere else.    Everything was clean and inviting and our waitress was attentive. We didn't have to wait long for our order.    Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Not very experienced in Middle Eastern food but loved my chicken 'naanwich'.   Its a safe bet and the kabuki rice was awesome.  It appears most items are made from scratch so if you want to add a piece of naan to your meal expect about 10 minutes while they bake it fresh.  Everything was fresh and had a good flavor --- I'm craving it as I write this!  I went for an early dinner and 2 waitresses were very helpful."}
{"text":"Nice people. Lamb was delicious. Nice atmosphere. Brown rice had too much cumin for my liking. Salad was good. Music is fun. I would come back."}
{"text":"Delicious!  Great lamb shank and everything else. The chutneys are amazing to enhance your food."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with my wife and in laws. The food was amazing, as was the service (our server was Dennis, very funny and helpful).  Combo appetizer platter with eggplant, chicken, hummus, and chicken samosas. Everything was delicious. The samosas are flatter than traditional Indian ones, and did not have the full heavy filling, these were mostly chicken with some shredded carrot. Still very good.  We all shared the Pleaser dinner. It was HUGE. Two kinds of rice, 5 types of meat, 2 types of Naan, and salad. We were stuffed and still have plenty of rice, salad, and naan to take home. Everything is well seasoned, with a nice variety of spice.   The iced tea was also a wonderful surprise, back tea with cardamom. I will have to figure out how to make that at home."}
{"text":"I ordered the cilantro/jalape√±o hummus and gyro with spinach rice. The gyro was very good with tender meat, crispy vegetables and fluffy bread. The naan that came with my hummus was light and fluffy and tasty. The hummus was really good. I ordered the spinach rice because everyone raves about it but mine had too much cumin in it for my liking. The jalapeno and red pepper sauces were spicy and a great accompaniment.  Glad I found Rania's. I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Oh yum!!!!  The lamb shank  and the rice with raisins rocks with so much flavor. And the naan bread is so good too. The samboosa is delicious. They sure know tasty food. And Rubin is very kind person. Thank you Rubin"}
{"text":"I've worked here since November 2014 and after the first time eating the food I've eaten almost everyday since than. I work as a server here and can barely leave Rania's everyday after work without grabbing a meal to eat. I can barely keep all my tips in my pocket the food is so gooood.S if you want to enjoy a great authentic afgani meal and wonderful service from myself come and get some."}
{"text":"For 13 years that I lived in KSA, my palate had been accustomed to middle eastern dishes. So, when I saw this place on Yelp I didn't waste any time & went to check it out. I wasn't disappointed. Their food is excellent, authentic & flavorful. All the ingredients were mixed into perfection. I tried their Grilled Cornish hen with kabuli style rice & my husband tried their Grilled Beef sirloin & chicken thigh kabobs with spinach basmati rice & naan bread. We enjoyed every bite. Their portions are generous too so make sure to bring your appetite. We highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Roasted Cornish Game Hen was out of this World! Chicken kabob was juicy and spinach rice delisous! Service was terrific and owner/chef took the time to ask how our meal was. Wonderful meal and experience."}
{"text":"I ventured in here again, enticed by the lure of Groupon. Right when I entered I was warmly greeted by the owner. I went to the counter and browsed through the menu, pondering what food I should get for take out. I got the chicken and beef keemah and a side of butternut squash borani. The order didn't take too long to make, and I was soon off to drive back home to enjoy my newly acquired lunch.  The chicken and beef platter came with 2 long pieces of mixed white and dark meat chicken, and 1 long piece of ground beef. Both were expertly seasoned, and very tender. The meat rested on a large portion of rice (You get your choice of various rice sides; I chose the spinach rice). The spinach rice was also quite good, and nicely cooked. I enjoyed the butternut squash borani was well. The mild flavor of the squash contrasted well with the yogurt sauce on top of it.   The meal also came with some cucumber/tomato salad, yogurt sauce, and some green chutney (Mint? Cilantro?). All were excellent, packed with flavor, and accentuated the meal well.  The naan was also very good. It tasted different from naan I've had at Indian restaurants. The texture was more pillowy on the inside, with a nice crisp outer layer.  Due to the improvement in service, upgrade 1 star!"}
{"text":"Tired of the same thing all of the time, we escaped our box and found Rania's.  The food was great, and the service was excellent.  Denis explained the menu, and asked enough questions to make great suggestions."}
{"text":"Today I was sitting at home, didnt feel like cooking or pizza. So I checked trusty yelp, seen the reviews and ordered the combo kabobs ans naan bread. Hands down the best Afghan cuisine I have ever tried. I am blown away. You HAVE to try this place.  I will be eating here tomorrow as well, have to try their gyros now."}
{"text":"First visit here and I would highly recommend it.  I got the chicken thigh kebab and my husband got the Afghan meatballs and they were both excellent along with the spinach rice. Dessert - pistachio ice cream ."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery from here,  The delivery was fast and great. The food, however, was just okay. I thought by spending $25 I'd have lunch and a snack for later. That was not the case. The portions are suuuper small. I was hugely disappointed by the humus. I paid $8 for 4 giant slices of cucumber with a little humus drizzled on top. The Naan was a little stale, I'm not sure if that was a side effect of delivery though. I was hungry and in a bit of a pinch. This worked fine. But it really only deserves 2 stars. Which is unfortunate because I was expecting great things based on other reviews."}
{"text":"This place is nothing short of amazing. Full disclosure- I've only gotten delivery service from them, but WHAT an amazing service it has been! I very much look forward to visiting their actual restaurant, but as far as delivery, it's definitely some of the best.  I've tried pretty much the entire menu, and everything that I've had has knocked my socks off. Their chicken wings are *UNIQUE*. They cook the entire wing, so be ready for a bigger piece than you're used to. Their blend of spices and sauces is amazing, and you'll find yourself smacking your lips, saying:  \"What WAS that?!?!?\". Their wings are a little on the 'wetter' side than I usually like, but that didn't detract from their flavor or meatiness at all.   I've gotten pretty much every form of meat delivered, and everything has been exceptional. Their chicken TRULY stands out though- I have NO idea what they're marinating these meats in, but it now holds a special place in my heart. Their Kabuli rice is also something special- slivers of carrot and fat raisins with a subtle sweetness that will just draw you right in.  When you're ready from a break for meats (that won't happen) you can order one of their salads- slightly vinegary with a nice cilantro flavor and a crispness that just perfectly accents all of the meat and grains in the dishes. And their dumplings... their dumplings are the PERFECT late-night food after a few drinks.  Tonight I ordered their naan pizza for the first time. Please don't make me repeat the word 'amazing' again. I could use more synonyms but that would be an exercise in redundancy.  Bottom line- they're doing something special here and you really owe it to yourself to check it out. Try some new things- you really won't be disappointed. And if you *ARE* disappointed, then WTF are you doing reading any of *MY* reviews?? We could never be friends."}
{"text":"Love this place... The naan (bread) is to die for! Everything is really fresh and tasty.  I would recommend this place to anyone looking to try something different!!! Try the spinach rice with the chicken breast kabob... You won't be dissapointed :)"}
{"text":"Had lunch here today & it was REALLY delicious! The Chicken Qorma was so good! Finished with a piece of baklava :) Definitely will be coming back!"}
{"text":"The food and service both were brilliant! The spices which were sprinkled on the food were so enticing that I could not stop eating even when I was full. We had the chicken samosas, chicken kheema kabobs, shrimp kabob and baklava. The kabobs had an option of either the spinach, kabuli or white rice. Both the spinach and kabuli rice were great. In the naans, I liked the garlic better than jalape√±o. Baklava was huge, but a little too sweet and heavy for my taste. The two dishes which stood out for me were the chicken samosas and chicken kheema kabobs. Definitely a place to come back and I can't wait to do so!"}
{"text":"Man that was delicious, fresh & flavorful...absolutely wonderful! I liked everything! If you like Greek food...you'll love the food here! It's very similar to Greek but I like the spices & flavors a bit more than Greek! Try this place...you won't be disappointed! The red pepper sauce & the white sauce were soooooo good! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I have had lunch here at least 2 times.  The service is great, even when ordering to go.  The naan sandwiches are packed with delicious food, and the rice is fantastic.  I've also had a platter, which made me want more.  The only cons myself and my co-workers have is the shrimp salad.  There was a dead ladybug in the greens."}
{"text":"I really don't wanna rate Rania's lower than this, bcoz it's one of my favorites but they really should do something about the food to be consistent. Every time we go there we get a separate taste for the same thing. Especially the Cornish hen & chappli kabobs. This time it was burnt and too much salty."}
{"text":"Great food, great service - unique and authentic.  The naan bread is awesome.  Will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"Can't believe it took two years before we finally ate here. Afghan food is like a cross between Middle Eastern and Indian. The prices were reasonable ($10-12 a plate) for this type of cuisine. We went during happy hour which is every day...had a tasty bolani appetizer for $5. While we ate at the restaurant, a lot of people came in who did phone orders...I assume it's pretty convenient. The dishes come with a few different sauces which is a plus IMHO. The restaurant was noticeably clean which is a double plus in my book. Truly a unique culinary experience in the east valley you won't de disappointed."}
{"text":"We got the spinach dip with regular and jalapeno naan. We both got chicken kabobs. Everything was delicious even though it was delivery. We ordered through Grubhub. I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"A little hesitant. Never had Mediterranean food before but was motivated by the other reviews and boy were they right! Order the cheese naan bread as a starter and had Ranias special naanwhich and was not disappointed. It might not seem like a lot but it is definitely filling."}
{"text":"We had chicken samosas and red pepper hummus for lunch.  Delicious!  The samosasa were flaky and not at all oily."}
{"text":"Great happy hour. Apps are delish. Service is amazing. Skip the teas and baklava though."}
{"text":"So I will be the first person to admit that I am the least adventurous eater on the planet. I know what I like and I stick to it. That being said, on the suggestion of a friend I came here very very apprehensively.   First, we walked in and we were literally the only people there and alarms started flashing in my head to run for the hills. Boy am I glad I didn't.  We ordered some hummus plates with regular naan bread and some garlic naan bread. The red bell pepper hummus was incredible and the naan was fresh made and delicious. I had a kabob platter with some nicely seasoned rice and some more naan bread. It was incredible.  The food is delicious, the place is nice and away from the busy street and the inside of the restaurant is very clean with super friendly staff. My first impressions could not have been more incorrect and I am sorry I ever judged this place before trying it. If you want some great food, that isn't in your comfort zone, this is the place."}
{"text":"I recently moved to the city and have been looking for a good Afghani place in Mesa. There have been a lots of misses... but Rania's is def a hit! I came in during our study break for a lunch and order the party platter (forgot the name). It came with salad, 2 sides of rice, 2 orders of naan and a kabob platter. It was more than enough food of the 5 of us. The salad was very refreshing, the rice was delicious and refillable!! The meat was very tender and flavorful as well! The only weird thing was the naan, it may have been the style of naan but it was def more dense than I've had before. But overall it was still good.   While this isn't the best Afghani place I've been too, this is my new local favorite!   Yes, I will be back and have been! The nice delivery man knows my apartment now!"}
{"text":"This place has been amazing, I have yet to be disappointed with the food, the Chicken Keemah was cooked perfectly  (moist and seasoned just right) the spinach rice is super yummy. They have to chutneys sauces and both are so delicious and The Afghani pico de gallo is to die for. An absolute must!!!"}
{"text":"All I all, the meal was filling, yet the restaurant's ambience didn't come together; the TVs were set up like a bar, the music playing was radio music, and the employees didn't seem too enthused to be there. It was also confusing as to whether or not we, as customers, had to get refills, or if the servers did, due to the placement of the beverage machine and I felt as though the server was upset because we asked for a refill. My date and I soon felt awful after that scenario.   The food was great, but it's not something I would have again. We got the Cornish hen with spinach rice, which was delicious! The butternut squash was also amazing. A small plate we ordered was eggplant dip, which was unique and tasty. The best part was the fresh naan!"}
{"text":"I ordered chicken and basmati. Chicken was raw in middle. I ordered naan and received pita bread, not the same thing. Food was cold, desert colder ( baklava was frozen) I feel gipped on price that I paid. Never eating here again."}
{"text":"Not typically the person who is excited to go to a kabob place but this place not only has great kabobs but a world of even better food. The sauces on the table (red and green) are full of amazing spice and flavor that's hard to encounter most places. The Granache red wine pairs unexpectedly well with the food also. Quality and diversity of food and flavors definitely deserves the five star rating. Haven't tried breakfast here yet but I'm looking forward to it! Also had the pleasure of meeting the owner who seemed very genuine and concerned with quality of guests experience. Do yourself a favor and try this place ASAP it will not disappoint !"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! The bread is to die for, especially with the green sauce. The service is exceptional. The owner is very pleasant, always making sure everything is okay. The food is always fresh whether it's for dine in or take out."}
{"text":"This is a great hole-in-the-wall family run restaurant. The food is phenomenal. You literally can't go wrong. The naan was VERY good and complimented the fresh hummus well.   I recommend the beef and chicken kabob combo plate. The green chutney it is served with was zesty and delicious. I had the seasoned brown rice and it was actually seasoned - not just bland rice.   My 15 and 9 year olds both found something to eat and both enjoyed their plates as well.   All around, a great restaurant with very reasonable prices.   Average plate is between $10-$15."}
{"text":"Food was good.... lamb was way over done but I think that is because of how they cook it. The new server was very nice and it was sweet how he struggled to learn his new job, however the female in charge seemed more interested in her phone than in giving good customer service which was disappointing. We tried a second time and ate there again several weeks later because the spinach rice was incredible, but this time we got our food to go and it was a much better experience. Will go again, but only to get take out."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite restaurant! The food is absolutely delicious. I recommend the sirloin kabob with seasoned brown rice. Make sure to try the rice pudding with rosewater (perfect dessert).   The atmosphere is great, especially at night. The employees are all friendly and so very welcoming. I'm happy to have found this place."}
{"text":"Simply amazing food!   Was visiting Gilbert with the family and my oldest kiddo searched on our trusty YELP app and discovered this gleaming gem of middle eastern yumminess tucked into a non-descript shopping center.   Wow!!! Wow!!! Wow!!!   The food here off the hook amazing! This is Mediterranean food described as having an \"Afghan\" influence.   Honestly NONE of us were expecting THIS ultra high level of food quality and such interesting and beautiful flavors! This is Mediterranean food on steroids - kind of a fusion of exotic East Indian meets Turkish Middle East. This is a special place folks!  We eat Mediterranean food all the time and locating good Mediterranean cuisine in greater Phoenix is always a challenge.     Our extremely friendly and gregarious waiter Ruben recommended that we start with the $5.00 happy hour Bolani potato turnover and beef Mantu meat dumplings - two simply excellent choices.   The turnover is really something delicate to behold - kind of large plate sized potato latke or fritter (but better) with a crispy crust dusted with fresh herbs. Taking a bite the inside was tender and just magic in your mouth. It was served with slightly spicy citrus inspired dipping sauce that was amazing. Next time I will order two of these!  The meat dumplings were a totally unexpected and delightful detour - NOTHING like what you would find in a Mediterranean restaurant anywhere! These exquisite dumplings are more like what you would find at your favorite Chinese Dim Sum establishment in San Francisco, with more of those fun Afghan flavor twists. Here we have thin steamed wrappers filled with seasoned ground beef, vegetables and drizzled with a unique tomato sauce and fresh mint! They are served with a kind of garlic Tzaziki style sauce for dipping. These were gobbled up in seconds by my hungry family!   We also ordered some of the fabulous \"Naan\" bread - both the garlic and the traditional were a \"10\" - served piping hot and crisp on the outside and soft inside. This is feels like close relative of an Indian Naan, but the textures here are similar to an extra thin pizza style dough with an added flakiness. Everyone loved that bread!  The main courses were heavenly - the deliciously and perfectly marinated lamb, chicken thighs, and chicken breast kabobs all hit their mark - expertly grilled and supremely amazing meats, tender and moist!    The main courses were served with what seemed like tangy chutney's - one red and the other (Jalapeno) green. Both here comfortably hot but tasty, and again this is closer to what you would expect at an Indian restaurant rather than Mediterranean.   The Spinach rice was also a treat - cooked to perfection and a nice counter-balance to the spices in the meats.   We also tried the Afghan milk tea - flavors of rose water and Cardamom in a slightly (but not too) sweet tea with whipped cream on top. Very yummy.   The desserts were good but perhaps the weakest of the menu items - we tried the Baklava (very good) with a honey and nut filling which wasn't pistachio but quite good. The Pistachio ice cream was just OK - a little icy with flavors of cardamom and also a touch of rose water.   Pricing here is a little on the high side, but considering the unique dining experience and outstanding quality of the food here - I can wholeheartedly recommend Ranias Kabob Grill and we intend to be back soon. Superb!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Always looking for a good kabob place and this hit the spot! Ruben took good care of us and we will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"I am visiting Arizona from Oregon.  My niece suggested Rania's.  The food was absolutely scrumptious.  The naan was warm, soft, and buttery.  The spinach and cheese samosas were so damn good I wanted to dance when I ate them.   Then I tried the shrimp.  I don't know what they seasoned it with but it was some of the best shrimp I have ever eaten.  The spinach rice was perfect!   Our server was Alyssa and she was so nice!  She is very familiar with the menu and made suggestions that were perfect.   We brought dinner home for my sister and her husband and my niece and of course they all loved it. Oh and the Baklava melts in your mouth. I will make a point to return every time I am in the area. Dinner for five, naan included, samosas, and two large pieces of Baklava was only $66.xx so it is also a very good deal!"}
{"text":"If I could I would give no stars. Server had no Idea about what is on the menu or what beer they have or don't have... She appollogized for being so busy but there was literally 8 ppl in the entire place.... Then she apologized for being new..... If you don't know the menu you can't work on the floor ...Wtf!!!! No manager around what a joke...."}
{"text":"This place was delicious!! We pigged out and ordered a whole bunch of different items and ordered TWO desserts. I really enjoyed the different relishes they brought to the table - they paired perfectly with the many dishes we tried. I will recommend this place to many others! Delish!"}
{"text":"Hands-down the absolute best delivery we have ever eaten.  We got the Group Pleaser Combo plate,  which had chicken, lamb, and beef.  Fantastically seasoned, and accompanied  by their amazing rices (Spinach and Brown) and a garden salad.  Who knew delivery could be so good!"}
{"text":"Pretty good. The food looks beautiful but to be very honest it was all kinda lacking in flavor.  They have a salad bar but it's full of some very odd flavored sauces and things that are all tart or super salty.  The Chicken Kabob and the SPinach rice was very good. The Samosas were meh....the Spinach Samosas were pretty much pure spiniach in them and a bit of cheese. No spices!! More cheese and less spinach IMO.  We will try again as they seem to be new and working out the bugs."}
{"text":"Amazing food and great service. The naan chicken sandwich with Afghani pico was to die for. The brown seasoned rice? Perfection. Can't believe this was my first time. I'll be back! Tucked away in a strip mall like most good restaurants in the phx area."}
{"text":"The Samosa appetizers are delicious and almost a meal themselves.  The butternut squash and garlic naan bread are a must order.  I have checked in many times and I have ordered the Raina's special naanwich for lunch a number of times with spinach rice it is my favorite lunch there."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch on a Sunday. Place was empty and that's unfortunate. Really interesting and flavorful food, very affordable. Place should be packed. Mediterranean/Afghani food. Delightful. Don't be fooled by the store front."}
{"text":"Ooooh! This is a great place :). I have been there twice. We even took our neighbours there. I have tried the Chapli Kabab and one of their other kababs. Delicious. One of the sauces they serve is really sour (but delicious nevertheless). Their Naans are so good, you can eat those without any accompaniment. Give them a try! Healthy, Fresh, Delicious food.  And their Ice Cream is awesome too :)."}
{"text":"All of the food was amazing!!  The owner is super friendly!!  The Baklava was freshly made and the Samosa is incredible.... everything we have had has been wonderful!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time. I got the beef kabob with brown rice and naan and my boyfriend got the lamb with spinach rice and the salad bar. Both dishes were delicious! The beef kabob was tender and juicy with a full flavor. Loved the green sauce that came with it. It was spicy but fresh. The lamb definitely tasted like lamb unlike some other places that over season the meat and mask its original flavor. The salad bar had many different toppings with even pickled vegetables like brusslesprouts, garlic and carrots.  I didn't see the $20 for $25 deal until after we already paid but the owner was so awesome he gave us a large slice of baklava  on the house. The baklava tasted homemade and fresh. Just the perfect sweetness to hit the spot. The owner also brought out a savory dumpling dish for us to try which was like ravioli. Such a great guy!  I wish this place well. They are off to a great start!   Had to update my review. I called in a order for pick up and this girl on the phone was so rude and dumb. I met her in person and she was even worse! She has to go!!!"}
{"text":"Avoid this place at all cost. The man working there Flynt has the worst customer service and attitude ever. I had been to this establishment many time before but never experienced this man nor this harassment before. Watch your bills because this man is out to nickel and dime you. The food was sub-par at best, not like it used to be. I won't be back, ever. Over price chicken rice, spend your money else where...."}
{"text":"Ordered pick-up on my lunch break, they were very friendly and had my food ready on time. I ordered the Afghani fries and OMG they were amazing!!!!! I am sure the kebabs and everything else was great but I will probably continue to order the afghani fries until I am sick of them. It was a little pricey at $10 but the fresh jalape√±os, afghani pico and chili, and three different kinds of cheeses made these fries a culinary masterpiece!"}
{"text":"Nothing special at this place. The food is just Ok, and its not middle eastern food, its some indian mixed place."}
{"text":"Finally dined in. The aesthetic of the place isn't much, but it doesn't deter from the quality of food. I also indulged in an afghani chai which was so good.   A guy, whom I imagine is the manager of the place was friendly and talked to me multiple times.   Our servers (I believe one was in training) were friendly.   My only complaint (I won't take stars off because I'm sure it was an inevitable misfortune) is that their naan maker was broken, so there was no naan (my favorite!). They did provide pita instead. While not as good, it was quite adequate.   Love this place!"}
{"text":"If your tired of the regular tex mex Chinese night. Try this place out! Different flavors lots of variety and all around good!"}
{"text":"I can't even believe this place.  Found it on Yelp while visiting a friend.  I'll preface this with the fact that I have no experience with Mediterranean/middle eastern types of food.  THAT being said, this place was DELISH!!   Cost wise, it wasn't bad.  But i came out alone, while hungry and greedy, so I ordered beer, appetizer and a meal for just myself.  I could've easily shared it with another person.  The total was $32.   Appetizer sampler.  OMG. Picked three and got a potato thing (forgot the name) came out like a quesadilla (potato fried in a tortilla)... it was good but a bit bland, definitely load it with one of the delicious chutneys!!  And the beef dumplings... so much like a ravioli, but NOT like ravioli... and the chicken soomosa.  HOLY COW!  It's like an empanada crossed with a Chinese dumpling, but it's its own amazing thing!  Definitely worth it!   For my main dish I chose the Afghani meatballs.  Amazing!!!! Peppery spicy without being over bearing in an amazing gravy.  I put it over the plain white rice. Sooooooo good!   The Naan was DELISH!   The service was amazing.  The waitress was kind and patient and helped me order.  She was attentive without being overwhelming and pleasure to have help me.   I can't wait for my next trip out here (will be about 3 months) so I can come back.  I will definitely be thinking of his place while I'm home in SoCal."}
{"text":"Garlic naan is very good and that's about it. Service was extremely unfriendly and made me feel very unwelcome by Debbie S. Granted she was covering a few tables but she was extremely rude. Any time I asked the smallest question or requested a cup for water she acted so put off. After one extremely rude reply the look on my face must have let her know I did not appreciate the frostiness and she got a little nicer but not much. I won't be back:("}
{"text":"The special was a superb price. The chicken kabob tasted good but was dry and seemed pre-cooked. The rice wasn't hot, the bread pre-made. This wouldn't fly in Los Angeles where things are made to order and steaming hot."}
{"text":"We tried this place on a rainy day. We had the butternut squash vegetarian meal and the shrimp/sirloin kabob combo. They were delicious with just the right amount of flavor! The owner came over to make sure we were satisfied. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Here now for the first time.....weird but, on this HOT Sunday afternoon the place is empty...one other party of 2 just left. Starting with an Afghan Iced Tea. I had the Gyro salad. The meat was super tender and flavorful. Oh wait, theres another customer :-) Fresh veggies and a nice light dressing. Bookmark ed!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Rania's Kabob Grill yesterday.  The food was surprisingly good.  I had the stewed lamb shank & my wife had the eggplant borani.  Both were served with the traditional Kabuli brown basmati rice.  The food was good.  The only thing that I would note is that it was a little excessive on the butter, but otherwise good.    I never expected an Afghani restaurant in suburbia, but even I am now convinced (perceptions are not everything).  My wife and I were originally skeptical at the view from the street (hidden inside a strip mall just South of the hospital).  It looks very casual, like a sports bar.  This was not the case.  I am guessing that prior to this restaurant, this location was some kind of bar or some kind of fast food restaurant.  Interestingly, my wife and I had a Groupon for this restaurant, but in the end we decided to just pay the check and not use Groupon.  Usually we only use Groupon when the restaurant does not show promise (as the restaurant is effectively selling at a loss when they use Groupon).  In this case, we believe the restaurant to be of good value, and using Groupon would not be fair.    Since the food is slightly unique, as it is Afghani (a combination of Middle East / Persian + Indian subcontinent) I would like to see some decorations hinting at the Afghani culture.  Perhaps a poster or enlarged photo of Bamiyan (or a Kabul or Kandahar street scene), or of former King Zaher Shah, would be a nice touch, if done tastefully. I have no doubt that Afghanistan is a wonderful country with a deep and rich culture (despite the turmoil and war it has seen).  This restaurant would be a perfect place to show some unique cultural things on walls.    I say this because Afghani culture and food is unique, and you do not want to get lost in the \"sea\" of other Middle Eastern and Mediterranean restaurants in The Valley.  This will help with market distinction in regard to competing, and showing what is different.  And attracting new customers.  I definitely hope that this restaurant is a success and continues to succeed moving forward."}
{"text":"has really good food, and friendly service.  I dont know what the seasoning is but it is really yummy and I just want more.  Why the three stars???? Well it would have been five but they charged to split the check between two people :/  Thats ok took it out of the tip :P.    Hi Wally I am a good tipper and he still got 15% and yes it was the server because he was the one that rang the additional charge and didn't address it. We did not split the food we split the check. It's ok and like I said that's why 3 stars and not 5."}
{"text":"What a fantastic, delicious delight!  After seeing it post-workout at Fitness Works I decided to give it a try.  So glad that I did.  Will look forward to returning weekly."}
{"text":"We loved this place! We went early on a Tuesday evening and were spoiled with attention (judging by our waiter's enthusiasm, I would guess he was an owner or manager).   We started with two $5 happy hour appetizers (can't remember what they call the beef dumplings? And then the other app was the eggplant dip). Both were great, but I really enjoyed the eggplant dip. Beers (very large ones) also had great happy hour prices.  Our waiter recommended two kabob platters for first timers to share - one with spinach rice and the ground chicken and ground beef kabobs (again, can't remember the official name), the other with kabuli rice and regular chicken and beef kabobs.   Everything we tried was very flavorful and delicious, we will be back!."}
{"text":"If you want something different, you really do not have to go too far.  We were pleasantly surprised with this place.  It was a bit hot in this place when we came, but other than that, it was sooo delicious!  The staff really does a great job accommodating requests.  From menu questions to setting up and moving tables it was a really pleasant experience.  The RICE, spinach rice was really good.  I could have ate a whole bowl of this stuff.  I ordered the Leg of Lamb Kabob. The sauces that they offered, all that were really good, the green one was my favorite.  We had a great time and would come again."}
{"text":"Great first time! Will be back! :) come you will be freshly satisfied, as everything is made fresh daily!"}
{"text":"All of the food was delicious and the service was fantastic!  Ordered the chicken keemeh kabob with the Kabuli style rice.  The meant had a wonderful flavor which matched well with the sweetness of the rice (with added carrots and raisins).  The staff are super friendly and patient - I am a novice to Afghan food, and our server explained the entire menu to me.  He also went out of his way to turn off the fan to make sure we were comfortable.  I will definitely be back.  Everything was delicious."}
{"text":"Grabbed dinner here while visiting my dad.  This a great little place in a nondescript strip mall.  I didn't expect much since we have a plethora of kabob places in LA.  Granted, the majority are Persian or Armenian, but there are a few Afghani places also.  I must say that the food is solid.  We had lamb kabobs, keemah kabobs and braised lamb shank.  The spinach rice was very tasty.  Throw in a decent salad bar and you have a very satisfying meal."}
{"text":"I went there last Saturday and I was really impressed with chicken kabob with special style rice.  Galric naan was good too!   I plan to come here more often again.  :)"}
{"text":"Food was amazing they had 3 different kinds of rice.. The chicken and steak kabobs melt in your mouth and a small craft beer selection. A local gem you have to try this place"}
{"text":"I have given Rania's my business for over a year now. They used to be amazing.   After my last experience I will never return. We ordered food for delivery at 6:30 pm and we were told delivery will be between 7:30 - 7:40, which was fine. 7:55 came around and still no delivery. My husband called the restaurant and was told the delivery man was running behind but will be there soon. Finally at 8:15  and our food was finally delivered.... cold. This has never happened in all the times I have ordered, nor have they been this late.   I called and asked the girl answering phones to connect me with the manager. The \"Manager\" did not introduce himself... I began to voice my concern that if they are running late it would be nice to notify your paying customer of the delay.... I expressed my disappointment as this has never been an issue before....   The \"manager\" responded \"if we are running late delivery time is 1.5 hours.\" I said I understand that but I was not told you were running behind. He said \"Thank you\" and disconnected the call....  The \"manager's\" response is why I will never give them my business again. If you are late, fine.... but when you cannot even apologize to a customer than I can no longer support the establishment....  Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Rania's Kabob Grill, my first visit and definitely not my last! And here's why...  Service was great! Walked in and was greeted by Margaret who promptly seated us. It was the first time either my buddy or I had been here, so she kindly walked us through the menu. She took our drink order. Shortly after she came back and took each of our food orders and for the Yelp coupon I had (1free small plate with an entr√©e order) we left that up for her to choose. While we briefly waited for our food Margaret brought out some sauces and chutneys and explained the flavor profiles of each one.  Then the food started showing up! Margaret's surprise for the small plate was the Beef Mantu, very flavorful and delicious. Main entr√©e arrives and the portions were very generous. I ordered the Rania's Gyro Naanwich. The gyro was filled with all sorts of Greek goodness, accompanied by a huge serving of tasty spinach basmati rice.  To top off the great service and amazing food, the bill arrived... $15 for my Gyro and my buddies equally sized and full of flavor dish. I would expected to pay $15 just for my plate. There was that much amazing food there.  In the end I came in craving good authentic Greek/Mediterranean food and left a very happy and satisfied customer, who will be returning to Rania's Kabob Grill on my next visit to Mesa."}
{"text":"The squash dish, egg plant dish and the beef & lamb kabob are delicious! We dined in the restaurant tonight.  The red and green sauces, along with the yogurt and house dressings, add exquisite flavor."}
{"text":"They seem to have raised their prices and cut their potion sizes since the last time I was in.  I don't so much mind the smaller portions but the prices seem a little out of line for what you get.  $8 for hummus is a bit of stretch.  Its good, but not $8 worth of good."}
{"text":"Awesome! When we moved here from Southern California we had a hard time finding great middle eastern food until Rania's...  Love this place."}
{"text":"I bought a gift card for Groupon for this restaurant $15 what's the cost for $30 worth of food thought that was a great deal until after I finished the purchase and it said I could only use 10 dollars at a time it did not tell you this until after you confirm your purchase very dishonest when I asked the owner if I could use them. anyway that I was from out of town and would not be able to come back he said no so I got up and left I felt the server was very rude I tried to place an order several times she looked at me and walked away then when I asked to speak to the owner about the mishap with a certificate he didn't come until they put the food on the table. The food did look good and it was a good price but I was very unhappy with how they treated me."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful service! Great food and a lot of it. If you order one of the combo platters it's enough and more to take home for a great price. Tastes like real home-made afghan food and the naan bread was to die for. Definitely our new local kabob go to!"}
{"text":"We have been looking for a new place to eat.  This place is awesome.  Food and service was amazing. We both had naanwiches that were surprisingly filling.   They make the naan fresh daily! We will definitely be back to try other dishes."}
