{"text":"Sharpsburg is not an area of Pittsburgh that I frequent on a regular basis.  My friend John and I get together every few months for dinner and he recommended this joint.  I immediately said yes (I love a new adventure) and did not do any research.  I actually had no clue I was headed for an Italian feast that was both filling and flavorful.  I thought we were headed out to a dive-bar for wings and beer.  When we came off the Highland Park Bridge and wrapped around the exit, CC's was right along the main drag, literally a stone's throw from the bridge.  

Entering the restaurant, the parking was limited, but lot was well kept (after a snow storm recently occurred in the city).  It seemed as though we were entering a house party in one of Pittsburgh's thriving \"Mill-Town's\" of yesteryear.  The bar was tiny, as well as the dining room.  If I could have a complaint, it would be the close quarters of the joint.  The bartender spotted us entering and immediately sat us in the dining room.  We were immediately welcomed with water and Italian bread with dipping oil.  I had Onaga (mild Hawaiian fish) drenched in butter and pomegranate reduction sauce served with broccoli (my choice).  I started with a caesar salad.  John had the iceberg wedge salad (HUGE) to start and Veal for his entree.  We split a $20 bottle of Malbec.  I literally wanted to lift and lick my entree plate upon completion (held back from doing so).  I mentioned that the close quarters environment as a negative, but well into the dining experience this was quickly forgotten.  The waitress knew all of the specials and opened the bottle of wine with ease and confidence.  5 STARS with a purpose!!!"}
{"text":"Don't let the exterior fool you, there are tasty treats inside! 

This place is great, I have been here twice now, and can't wait to go back. The Bar has ample selection, and a great knowledgeable bartender. The staff is super friendly, and know what they're doing. The Chef knows her shit in the kitchen! I recommend the pecan crusted salmon (so good!), and the butternut squash ravioli. But everything I have had here was awesome.

Totally worth finding, and checking out. You won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went to cc's. We were there one hour and they asked us to leave our table and go to the bar. While they did ask us nicely , they said they had people waiting for the table ,I don't think that was very polite asking us to leave our table. Maybe it's because we didn't order any dessert or coffee. But that's not even the incredible rude part about it. After I left I called and asked to speak to the manager and told her that I didn't think that that was very polite to ask us to leave our table and go to the bar and she said goodbye and hung up on me. We spent $100 there and  that's how rudely  we were treated. Won't go back."}
{"text":"Food is innovative, service top-notch, ambiance authentic.  Favorites are squash ravioli, Sicilian pasta, beet salad, black pepper linguini.  Never disappointing."}
{"text":"We used to love to come to this restaurant and came often, but recently had a terrible experience with the owner, Anita. After a long back and forth with a number of customer service gaffes, Anita told us that her motto is \"the customer is always wrong.\" I'm not sure she knows which industry she's in, and we will not be returning."}
{"text":"Everyone I've told about this place has become a regular... its that good.  Homemade pasta every day, great specials, and a family restaurant feel.  Family favorites include hot pepper soup, ahi tuna, $20 bottles of wine, and anything with the garlic cream sauce.   Not open for lunch right now."}
{"text":"Great little place!!  Owners are outstanding people - like family cooking your meal!  Each visit is a wonderful experience - seem to always see someone there we know! NICE :)"}
{"text":"When a place has horrible service but wonderful food, what's the user review tipping etiquitte? I don't want to rave about the food because I was so embittered by the laisse fare attitude of our waiter, who - nonetheless-was serving the whole dining room.So what if it was bad for me...I would highly recommend the food and the atmosphere, just not the waiter we had at the moment we had him. Greens n beans were delicious. My friends got prosciutto and pea openne - excellent! Chicken parm was incredible. Sauces are fabulous. Seafood bisque was so buttery. Sharpsburg scares me, but this place is great!"}
{"text":"I have been to CC's three times now and it has become one of my favorite restaurants in the burgh.  It is cozy, welcoming, and has dynamite food.  I could eat the crab bruschetta all day everyday.  Great house salad.  Many options on the menu, but the specials are why I come back.  Just go eat here and support a local business doing things right."}
{"text":"CC's combines a Cheers type atmosphere with intimate dining.  It is a little culinary gem sitting in Sharpsburg.  When you open the menu you are amazed by the variety and number of choices...then they come and tell you the specials!  Their homemade salad dressing is delicious but you have to try the beet and goat cheese salad too!  We have been going to CC's for over 9 years and still haven't tried everything on the menu!  The staff is friendly and professional and truly care about their customers' dining experience.  I can't more highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Wow really enjoyed the atmosphere. Great place, friendly staff, excellent service. Serving size big enough to keep you plenty full. 

My husband Bone in Ribeye was cooked perfectly and the sauce was a great touch.

I had the spicy sausage and the red sauce tasted fresh and light."}
{"text":"Good pasta dishes that balance well with wines.  Butternut squash ravioli was excellent. Also  The veal chop was excellent and done perfectly."}
{"text":"As many types I've been here, I have never had a bad meal. The menu is eclectic, the food is spectacular, the drinks are plentiful. A great best kept secret of Sharpsburg. One of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh"}
{"text":"It's been too long since were here last-it won't take that long to come back! We just had a variety of appetizers, but they were all so good it was unbelievable.  Anita took our order personally, even though they were crazy busy. Although everything was good, the scallops appetizer with the crunchy noodles and balsamic was the best!!!"}
{"text":"Sort of a neighborhood \"Cheers\" vibe as others have noted. Soups, veal (meat in general), Crab cakes (seafood in general) are great!! Their red sauce  pasta dishes are my least favorite - although non-red sauce pasta dishes are very tasty!! Appetizer and salad specials are excellent. Drinks are strong. Nice wines. Desserts are limited. Reservations are for 6 or more only I believe."}
{"text":"I will say the food was decent, but the wait in between courses was unbearable. My husband and I went to dinner and we were fairly hungry ( a plus if you going out to eat!). The wait for a table was average, but it took over 2 hours after we were seated to get salads. Another 90 minutes bf the main course! We were so famished by the time we got our meals that we ate quickly. By that time, we just asked for our check, which took another 45 minutes. The server was nice, but don't go there unless you are not that hungry and you plan to spend all night there."}
{"text":"Excellent on all accounts. Great Italian comfort food. Very well done, excellent service, nice atmosphere. I highly recommend getting all of the appetizers and just using that as your main dinner! Wine selection reasonable with reasonable prices.  Absolutely can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"I've heard nothing but good things about CC's - I live two blocks away and will be walking here regularly from now on!  The food was just delicious!  I had the crab cakes - huge and nothing but crab!!!  They were amazing!  My daughter had ravioli that was just fantastic. The place was a zoo though, so we sat in the bar rather than wait an hour for a table. I'll definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Pleasant , Fun Atmosphere!
Excellent service ( woohoo Paula!)
Every menu item ordered , we'd definitely order again . CC's Veal , oh my ! Mr got a prime rib special w/mushroom risotto, humma-humma ! I brought the bone home to lunch on tomorrow.
Both daughters ordered pasta dishes , asking us , while eating, why we've never brought them here before  . Deeeeelicious !!  #talentedkitchenstaff !!!!!!!"}
{"text":"One of the best Pittsburgh restaurants that no one talks about.
Beet & goat cheese salad is a must.
Butternut Squash Ravs... Yum"}
{"text":"Unbelievable is the best word to describe the food at CC's Cafe. You just don't expect that food quality in a small neighborhood bar. Their chef loves to create and it shows.  Anita and her sister run the restaurant/bar, they are both friendly and welcoming. CC's is a small, easy to miss, hole in the wall. I drove right past it the first time we went. There are only a dozen or so tables, plus a comfortable bar. The first thing you will appreciate is the local ambiance. We were new to the area and felt right at home. Our server, Bridget was exceptional. She sat us quickly and was attentive to our every need. We ordered their spicy pepper soup and baked brie as starters. OMG! The spicy pepper soup was like a drinkable spaghetti sauce I once enjoyed while visiting Tuscany. The flavors were both complex and well balanced. The baked brie with raspberry sauce was exceptional.  I next enjoyed their version of the Wedge salad. Yum... For my main course I ordered the Past Diablo it was fantastic, the pasta was cooked perfectly and the shrimps were large, plump and perfect in texture.   My wife Rose had fillet medallions, she ordered them medium rare and they were cooked perfectly. After eating everything we were stuffed but loved the food so much we tried their deserts. We were not disappointed there either. The Cannoli I tried was on par with some of the better cannoli's I have had while living in Chicago. My wife loved Key Lime Pie. We have been back several times. One of the best nights to go is Tuesday for fish tacos. Incredible fish, great value; for us it is well worth the 30 minute drive to get there. If you are looking for a fast paced chain restaurant then this is not the place for you. This place is more like eating at your favorite Aunty's house."}
{"text":"CC's is a great place for a low-key, but super delicious meal.  There's a great bar in the front of the space and about 10 tables in the back.  I grew up eating lots of homemade Italian food, so I'm pretty picky about how I like it prepared when we go out to eat.  This place makes my tummy happy and reminds me of my childhood Sunday dinners. I ordered the chicken picatta, which is really scrumptious and was told that there's a nice choice of sides from which to choose. (I went with the steamed broccoli sprinkled with parm and was way happy about it.) Also, the beet salad (check out my pictures) is like heaven on a plate.  It's worth the up-charge for sure.

On a more adult note, I really appreciate that this place offers about 10 or so $20 wine bottles on their drink menu.  It's rare to find a restaurant that offers legit wine for less than $50 or so per bottle.  I love to share wine at dinner and one bottle is usually the perfect amount when there's an appetizer and a main meal involved.  Finally, the bar is a really cozy place to have a drink and wait for a table, but you could end up sitting there for the better part of an hour if you don't call ahead or make reservations."}
{"text":"AMAZING!!! Looks like a local bar from the outside, and it is. But the restaurant in the back could easily be found downtown in any major city. Small, nicely laid out and boasting a menu that can compete anywhere. The bar food is surprising: tasty, plentiful and more than reasonably priced. But the restaurant takes it to another level. I was in the restaurant business for about 10 years in Vermont, Maine, the Caribbean and NY.  I live in NY and I eat out a lot. The Veal Chop may have been the single best piece of meat I have ever been served. The staff is great and the meal is reasonably priced and certainly worth every penny. Do yourself a favor and don't miss this one."}
{"text":"The food is the highlight.

Squash ravioli was outstanding, very rich, appetizer portion is all you need.  Veal piccata was spot on, off menu Sea Bass was darn tootin' perfectly cooked.

Stella Artois on tap!

We will be back."}
{"text":"I ate here last night for dinner with my girlfriend after reading some of the reviews on Yelp.  The outside of the restaurant is ho-hum and not much to look at but the inside is quaint and quite nice.

We were seated almost immediately in a booth and told of the many different specials that they had that evening.  Since we were trying to make it to a movie, we decided to forgo an appetizer and have entrees only.  For my entree I decided upon the Russian shrimp which had shrimp, mushrooms and artichokes in a vodka sauce while my girlfriend decided on the pasta al pesto with chicken.  They were both served with homemade pasta and we were delighted when given the choice between linguine, angel hair, penne or pepper linguine.  Both my girlfriend and I ended up choosing the pepper linguine.  Shortly after ordering our server came out with some nice slices of Italian bread paired with an olive oil and spice dipping sauce (oregano and other items) which tasted wonderfully.  Both of our entrees also came with salads that were mixed and plated table side much to our surprise.  The salad had a nice house dressing on it and tasted nicely, especially with the Gorgonzola cheese on the side which the server recommended.  With both the salad and bread being delicious I was really looking forward to our entrees.  After they came out I first tried the pasta al pesto and it was delicious with the sauce matching the pepper pasta perfectly.  Then I tried my dish and I have to admit that I was somewhat disappointed.  The vodka sauce seemed watered down and by that I mean that it had a watery consistency and was very bland, almost like water had been added at the very end.  That made my meal somewhat disappointing as everything else in it was good and cooked perfectly.  It also dropped what would have been a five star review down to four.

The bottom line for me is that I would definitely head back here in the future.  Everything except for my sauce was fantastic and I would go so far as to call this place a hidden gem.  With that comment though, I really want to think that the sauce that I had was a mistake and not what it is normally like."}
{"text":"I had an awful experience here. The owner, Anita, told me the customer is always wrong and shoved me. She also told me that clearly spoiled wine was drinkable and I needed to pay for a new drink if I wanted. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Rating given based on food. Had veal marsala. The pasta was overcooked and the marsala sauce was below average. Funny how an Italian place can't make their pasta right, didn't even expect for al dente but overcooked? My pasta were soggy! It's a shame.  Relatively good ambience-4 stars for ambience.

Bye"}
{"text":"From the outside this place looks like a neighborhood dive bar.  Step through the feng shui red door, and things take on a different feel.

I've lunched at CC's at least 10 times, but only once for dinner.  Go with a friend for lunch, and split these two items:  the ahi tuna sandwich, and the butternut squash ravioli.  The soup is also quite tasty.

Cost:  Cheap, amazing food for lunch...not cheap (3X more) for dinner."}
{"text":"Tucked in restaurant in Sharpsburg that we love to go to when we want great Italian food close by. The prices are more expensive but well worth it for the entrees. I got the vegetable fettuccine with garlic and oil. But I really should have gotten the butternut squash ravioli with pine nuts. It is absolutely the best butternut squash ravioli I have ever tasted- highly recommend! It's in a quiet location in Sharpsburg that isn't very fancy but they really focus on the quality of food. It's a great little nook in Pittsburgh that  is part of what makes the city so great."}
{"text":"I loved this place! By the outside I would've never even thought it was an option for good food, but thanks to Yelp we went.
CC's ambiance is a small mom and pop restaurant, giving you the amazing service you would expect. It is just that though, small. So be prepared to wait unless you have a party of +5 to make a reservation. 
We headed to the bar for a few cocktails while we waited and before we knew it, it was time to eat! 
First you start off with their bread and dipping sauce. Delish. Then you get your salad which they mix up right in front of you with their house dressing. Delish. Then came my parmesan scallops with pasta. Holy moley. Amazing. I do wish I would've gotten 4 scallops for their size but this homemade pasta made up for it. You had your choice on which type of noodle you preferred. We both went for angel hair. 
My fiancé got his ahi tuna pasta and this came with the entire tuna fish pretty much! It even came to his spice liking. The homemade pasta in our entrees made the meal.
Though our stomachs were more than satisfied, we knew dessert was in order to round out this tasty Italian meal. We ordered the butterfinger Oreo crusted pie, which was also homemade. I think that lasted all of one minute?
The owner or manager, Anita came over to talk to us and was so nice. You can tell this place cares about their customers. She laughed when I said I heard of them from Yelp bc she can't turn on a computer!! Haha!
Coming from an Italian girl who grew up eating Italian homemade meals this is the best in the area!  Mangia mangia!"}
{"text":"Came to CC's with my family because of the good reviews. I sampled 3 entrees:  Chicken Parmesan - disappointing. They served us two thick, chewy chicken breasts. Shrimp and scallop Alfredo - another disappointment. The sauce was very bland. I added both salt and Parmesan cheese in hopes of giving it more flavor but to no avail. Ravioli with tomato cream sauce - good. Both the ravioli and sauce were solid. Perhaps the best part of the meal was the cannoli for dessert. Delicious. Considering that I dropped over $100 on a dinner for 3, I don't think I'll be coming back. And I'm sorry, but I detect some \"friends and family\" bias in some of the reviews here."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful! Home grown ingredients, excellent service, great ambiance, just superb! You must go!"}
{"text":"The place is great I have been here four time, and can't wait to go back. The bar was just great, the people were great. and my friends love it a lot. The food was very good. I had the steak and I love it.."}
{"text":"Ok so CC's is a great secluded resturant that will make you forget that you are in Sharpsburgh. Good food, great service, extensive wine and beer selection. Great daily specials. Really good friendly service. I recently moved around the corner and this place is a saving grace."}
{"text":"We come here often and always enjoy the food, service and atmosphere! Locally owned and friendly. The steak medallions are my fav!"}
