{"text":"The draw and appeal of this restaurant is probably the name :) . While that is enough to put people through the doors, you are hoping to have decent food.  At times, the service was spotty and disorganized, where one server would show up right after another dealt with your table.  The manager who checked up on us was quite cordial though.  The restaurant is mainly opened for breakfast and lunch, which is clear when you take a look at the menu.  The thing that's clear is that there's more focus on the brunch aspect of the menu.  The burger ordered means well, but there was one technical flaw that hampered enjoyment.  While some enjoy having their burgers cut in half, it ultimately led to ingredients falling out.  While the structural issues of the burger got in the way, I'd still recommend people to try Smile as the taste was still pretty good."}
{"text":"The good people at Cafe smile do one very simple thing: they take all the love that goes into portuguese family cuisine and share it with their clients. When a restaurant greets you, chit chats and engages with you and your experience, you quickly go from a client to a friend ... and in the end, on top of mouth watering bitoque and bifana, feeling welcomed is what counts."}
{"text":"The photo should do the talking. Look at it! Just great! Ande great price too! The cod fish bolinhos (empanados) and the shrimp risolis are awesome! Also the portuguese style chicken is great! I recommend."}
{"text":"J'ai décidé d'aller déjeuner au Café Smile un dimanche matin bien neigeux et venteux! Il faisait bon et chaud à l'intérieur. Le service était super, le serveur était très gentil et souriant. J'ai pris l'omelette épinards et fromage cheddar, le fromage m'a fait sourire! C'était bon, une grosse portion! Toasts et café ou thé inclus. Le tout pour moins de $8!!! WOW j'étais très satisfaite et je compte retourner pour essayer d'autres choses sur le menu! À bientôt"}
{"text":"I really like this quaint Portuguese cafe. It is very warm and inviting, it feels very homey with the Portuguese music and Portuguese touches throughout the restaurant. The staff is extremely friendly. I actually found out about this place because my dad attended a high school reunion at this restaurant! So if it's good enough for a dozen Portuguese people it's good enough for everyone haha.   Okay so the most important part, the food! The chicken combo is SO worth it, 24$ and you get enough chicken for a family of 4, rice or fries or both, and a salad. Everything was very tasty and fresh! I can't wait to go back and try their sandwiches and poutine!"}
{"text":"It's a good place for Portuguese chicken. Not the best in town but still really good. The chicken was juicy and tasteful. And the quantity was perfect. Went there around 11h45 during a weekday and the service ws really fast. My plate to go was ready before I was finished paying. And If you go to a Portuguese chicken place just have the Portuguese chicken. Prices are also decent, which I'd more than I can say of a lot of places around the area. Will definetively go back there."}
{"text":"Très bon resto portugais dans le mile end, avec de l'excellent poulet, differents types de sandwiches, plats et poutine. Il y a aussi de la pieuvre grillee pour ceux qui aiment. A essayer!"}
{"text":"I'm Portuguese, and I love Portuguese food, and I know what good Portuguese food tastes like. Most of the poor reviews of Cafe Smile don't make sense, because most of these yelpers don't understand the Portuguese palate nor the practicality of Portuguese cuisine like I do.   First off, Café Smile is a very clean restaurant. The ambiance is bright, looks fresh, and pleasing to the eye.  Secondly, if you are to go in, I recommend you CALL FIRST and ask for Victor (the manager), mention you found them on YELP, and Victor will make sure you are well treated, well served, and in good hands, because he certainly did for us!!!!   Thirdly, as with any restaurant, IF you go in with a good appetite, and go in without high RITZ HOTEL expectations, Café Smile will NOT disappoint!!!! This isn't your typical high dollar expensive Portuguese restaurant near or around Old Montreal!!!!  Prices here are very reasonable and the food tastes great!!!  I recommend you try the traditional Portuguese Tapas. Granted although the tapas are small sized, the four Café smile portions I had (which is what tapas are) were very savory and did fill me up. I ordered a cold Sagres beer, squid tapas, pasteis de bacalhau, Portuguese sausage, and sardines, and I loved it. I also recommend their flan for dessert, which is also very delicious.   In conclusion, I recommend you try Café Smile, and to ask for Victor!!!!!, I will definitely plan on going back again when I'm back in Montreal. Both Victor and Café smile did deliver on bringing a smile to my stomach."}
{"text":"Yeah, I'm gonna go with Meh. It's an option if you're working across the street at Ubisoft, but it's not the only or best option in the 'hood. The burger was fine except that if the menu had warned me that the cheese would be plastic packet Americana I would have said Noooo Thank You, Please. Also the salad was of the boxed wilty variety. The orange booths are nice and the decor overall is quite harmless and clean, the signage is emoticon cute for the lol set I guess. But fact is, this resto is right smackdab next to the radiant art chaotica of Cagibi with all its vegetarian goodness and palpable soul. In this Mile End context Smile needs to try a little harder, IMHO ;)"}
{"text":"I haven't eaten any Portuguese chicken besides poule mouillé and Romados so I don't really have proper knowledge of the tastes of Portuguese food. Keeping that in mind, my review reflects the food itself without pitting it against the chicken giants of Montreal. I ordered the half chicken with fries and salad with flan as dessert. The chicken was garlicy, not too spicy and not too salty which was pretty perfect for me. The fries were a bit mushy but the seasoning was tasty (I ordered pretty late in the evening so I wonder if I had it earlier, would the fries be in a better state?) and the salad was that typical side salad restaurants give without any effort. Finally, the flan was a perfect dessert! All in all, I really enjoyed the chicken and would definitely order it from here again and maybe give their rice a try instead."}
{"text":"Excellent food, friendly service. Recommended: the \"green\" wine, which is really white, and the grilled dishes. The highlight of our dinner? The potato leek soup. Fantastic!"}
{"text":"Pas pire, pas pire. Je suis allée pour manger un burger et bien que mes amis avaient l'air de trouver le leur juste correct, le mien était pas mal bon. J'avais pris celui au brie et champignons, une de mes combinaisons favorites au monde! Le burger comme tel était bien, la salade, juste correcte et j'ai adoré le fait que les frites étaient faites avec des patates sucrées. La portion est assez généreuse, que pour l'heure du lunch, c'était trop pour moi. Les banquettes sont pas mal confortable et idéal pour un petit groupe ou bien même une rencontre de travail car ça ne laissse assez de place pour s'étendre et manger en même temps. Je suis curieuse de l'essayer à un autre moment, surtout pour tester leurs déjeuners."}
