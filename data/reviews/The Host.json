{"text":"I went to the host this evening with my family and had the worst experience. Our server brought our drinks and spilt a bottle of coke all over me! She apologized but did not seem genuine. She then went on to take our order. When she brought the food the portion size was much smaller than its been in the past! The food was also quite salty. Halfway through we get another server and the other girl disappears. We get our bill and there is no discount given the initial server ruined my sweater and jeans!! She didn't even ask if she could cover my dry cleaning!! I then had to go talk to our new server told him the story and he made it like he didn't. Then the old server comes back and tries to give a 9.00 discount?? I told her my dry cleaning would probably be over 30 bucks. My top was pretty expensive! She then comes back saying they could only give a certain discount! Anyway point is this place had no intention of paying the consequences for what they did, server was not very nice about the whole situation so I probably will not go back again!!"}
{"text":"Amazing authentic Indian food. Must try... Food portions are not that large but the food taste delicious. I have been there few times but never got seats until made reservations few weeks in advance. The staff is nice and professional."}
{"text":"I have visited the lunch buffet here at The Host a few times, it's great... for the price. Can you really complain about a $12 All-You-Can-Eat?

You are not going to get the top of the line fine dining you may expect going our for a fancy dinner, but for a quick lunch buffet you really can't complain. 

I especially liked the chance to try ALL the items, then go back for more of what I enjoyed the most. I would definitely recommend The Host for the Indian Food Newbie (like me) who wants to try new things, but doesn't want to leave a plate full of something leftover that you didn't like.

I also noticed some lack of interest from the wait staff, but in the end the overall experience was good enough to come back to."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. The people there are a charm. A wonderful experience every time. Bonus if Parbinder is in the house. His specials are amazing ! As an Indian, pehaps I can say \"mind blowing\". :)"}
{"text":"Came out here for a summerlicious lunch! The place was filled with groups of guests when we went. Decor of the restaurant itself is a bit dated, the place could definitely use a touch-up.

For $15 for lunch, we quickly got down to ordering our meal. There appears to be only one waiter on the floor, so the service initially was a bit slow. I got the chicken tikka naan, which was freshly made and delicious. Next was the matar paneer. A mild tomato based dish, with plenty of paneer pieces. I tasted the lamb roganjosh, which had slow-cooked pieces of lamb in a tomato curry sauce...mouth-watering...

To end off, I tried their Kheer, which was just right in terms of sweetness. I got a taste of pista gulfi, which was amazing, making me wish I had ordered that instead.

All in all, a great deal for quality indian food."}
{"text":"The best Indian restaurant. The food is excellent in terms of taste and presentation. The staff is polite and professional."}
{"text":"I went to the Host with my co-workers for a lunch buffet. I liked the decor and ambience. They have a wide variety of northern (Punjabi) and southern Indian dishes with several types of rice. One good thing is their fresh oven-baked bread which actually distinguishes the Host from other Indian Buffet establishments. There is good collection of condiments, salads and pickles also. All in all, I enjoyed the food as well as the service at the Host.

One useful tip, it is always better to get a reservation because this restaurant is situated in the middle of a huge office park and many people from nearby offices come to have their lunch buffet during their lunch break"}
{"text":"Food is way overpriced. But, I suppose I am paying for the nice atmosphere. You should definitely try the pistachio kulfi, that was delicious!"}
{"text":"It's been 5 years since I've had butter chicken so I used Yelp and searched \"Best butter chicken\". Chilli Chicken House and The Host were the two closest locations. I decided to go with The Host since I've never been there before. Growing up in this area I was surprised to see how close it was! This wasn't the typical Pakistani/Indian restaurant I was used too. This place was fancy, dimly lit with well dressed waiters. I was greeted right away, with sentences always ending in sir. 

I ordered 2 Murgh Makhni aka butter chicken and 
pilau rice for take out. Each order came with naan bread. And this was the best naan bread I've ever tasted! Fluffy & buttery but not too buttery. The rice was a little hard at the top but this was outshined by the savoury BUTTER CHICKEN sauce!!

While waiting for my takeout I witnessed multiple dishes leave the kitchen with such finesse, smelling good and looking great! Like a tree you pass blending in the background I've ignored this place my whole life!! I plan on coming back"}
{"text":"We have not eaten superb Indian food since we left London in 2004. Having recently moved to Toronto we were eager to see if we could replicate our previous experiences. This was our first try. Based on the recommendations on Yelp we thought we would try The Host living a few blocks away. Mmmmm.....not what it is said to be. If you are going to spend the time and energy  to eat out the meal should be dazzling. If you can replicate the meal at home why bother.  Our response to The Host....why bother. Average!!!  Maybe better than most? (sad to think) but we would not come back again. For a large Canadian city we find the food scene here lacking. Why? Let's get with it Toronto! Your prices are out of line with your quality. There is definitely a market for good quality food at decent prices! And secondly the facilities were filthy!!! The kitchen? Think about it before you come. Maybe in 2001 The Host came highly recommend not this 2012."}
{"text":"I would give this zero stars if possible. We went there for my mom's birthday, and before we even ordered, a cockroach ran across our table. Naturally we ran out, and the manager came to us and said he saw no cockroach. Never coming back."}
{"text":"Bad service, it took an hour to get the food, made reservation over the phone but was cancelled in error by the time our party arrived at the restaurant, they made multiple errors with our bills. 

It was my first visit there and my last."}
{"text":"just went here two weeks ago...the newly renovated Mississauga HOST is amazing! Decor and ambiance are unlike any other Indian restaurant out there.  No more tacky tables, chairs, tablecloths, and abundance of tacky Indian decor.  The new Mississauga host is in line with the trendy western bar and grill type restaurants (Joey's/Earls).  Great decor, booth style seating with a true fine dinning vibe.  Finally an Indian restaurant that I can bring my friends to.

They've changed the menu as well, a lot of new dishes that set this place apart from all the typical Indian restaurants out there."}
{"text":"When it comes to Indian food - I find the majority of the indian restaurants to be in the okay - to average range,

The Host - is perhaps average when it comes to their dishes, taste and flavours.  They basically charge a little bit more money for average indian food.  So what are you paying for?  Well the restaurant is nicely decorated, nice plates and all that jazz and I think if you are NOT indian you love the food because you don't know any better lol.

Overall ive had better indian food at other restaurants but for the setting and the service you can't go wrong if you want to eat indian.  I have been to this location 4 times, once for a lunch buffet, and 2 for parties and once for dinner."}
{"text":"We got a Host gift card from a friend, so that enticed us to go.  We always wanted to try.

Came here for dinner on a Saturday night and it was busy.  Very friendly service.   We stuck to the award winning dish, Buttered chicken (you can ask for the spicy version, made my nose run - in a good way) and it was tasty.

We also had the tandoori sampler that had 3 types of tandoori.   all good , but felt could just order the green chilli tandoori - which to us tasted the best (turns out that was award winning too)."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch on a Monday around noon. The place was not as busy as I thought it'd be. The server didn't acknowledge us when we walked in. He just continued doing his thing, even though I asked for a table of 2. He seemed busy, but we were eventually led to sit by the windows.

The channa masala was fantastic, though the naan wasn't as great as I expected. Some of the pieces were burnt a bit on one side. My partner in crime had the butter chicken and commented that it was very delicious.

Service was slow, even though the restaurant was not very busy."}
{"text":"Tried some Non-veg food with my friends...Horrible food ... 

People were so rude in treating us.. 

Very bad expérience.

They need to improve a lot in food and treating customers"}
{"text":"Horrible service. Ordered take out and came to pick it up 25 min later. I sat in the restaurant for over half an hour waiting for them to get my order ready. Turns out it was on the hot plate the whole time. I could even see it!

Thanks for the cold food and horrible service. I wish I had better things to say. Considering they catered my wedding. Oh btw that service was also horrible but that's for another day....."}
{"text":"This is my first visit, the ambience is very good. Best customer service, taste of the food is different from other restaurants, usually every restaurant has similar menu and same old taste, but this restaurant is unique , they got perfect south Indian flavours in it . i loved it"}
{"text":"Came here with friends from out of town. There were five of us and we ordered five dishes to share. They had a wide range of options that I do not see at other Indian restaurants but I'm not sure how many are actually authentic.

Taste is top notch. One order of naan was more than enough for each person. My friend was also satisfied with the taste of his vegetarian dish.

The decor seems pretty standard for a restaurant like this. It's more lit than other Indian restaurants I've been to."}
{"text":"On the last night of our trip, we wanted to try some good Indian food in Toronto. I searched yelp and ask the concierge where to go. He suggested Host. It was terrific. The chicken dishes, naan, service, etc. I highly recommend this place. Couldn't have been happier."}
{"text":"If location would be the only criteria to rank a restaurant, The Host would be A+, given its proximity to square one and accessibility from downtown and public transit."}
{"text":"Been here for dinner and the buffet. Dinner is great, love to see a menu with items not in every indian resto around Sauga.

The buffet is great, fresh good food and a good price."}
{"text":"I've been to many an Indian restaurant. Many. They've often left me unhappy, and wishing I'd just cooked at home. An exception to this fairly general rule has been Gerrard... and now, Host. The food was prepared quickly, but was steeped in flavour. There were many South Asians there, always a good sign in an Indian restaurant, and the food though a bit pricey, was very savoury. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Waiters are asking for money ... i mean literally(they will come to you and ask you ... one of the \"half bold\" waiter ask me).... that's disgusting ... they really need to maintain there standers of service  .... :X"}
{"text":"I did not enjoy my time here at The Host at all. Service was slow. The waitress took over 15 mins to come over to our table to greet us. After the order was taken, the food took forever to reach our table. We had to constantly remind the waitress for our food. The food was not great at all either. It was such poor quality food, and small portions as well. Attending this restaurant during Winterlicious, I had very high expectations for it being in the Winterlicious list. This restaurant did not meet my expectations and provided such disappointment."}
{"text":"Tried this place for dinner last night. The parking lot was full, leading me to believe the restaurant was, too. Not so - just about 5 tables were occupied. I guess the crowd must have been for the Asian hot pot place in the same strip mall!

The service was prompt, the food tasty if a little mild for Indian palates. We ordered several dishes, and every one of them was tasty. 

Shahi murgh (chicken in a nutty, creamy sauce) is mild and yet flavourful - the cardamom overtones reminded my friends of dessert. The goat curry was tasty without being overwhelmingly spicy, the saag paneer was bland but went across well with the non-Indians. The fish tikkas came out on a sizzling hot plate - the fish itself had a tad too much marinade on it, but was done to perfection, not dry like at many Indian restaurants.

The naan was perfect: hot, soft, not dry at all: they must have made a fresh batch when we ordered. The beef biryani was nicely flavoured, but the beef itself was on the tough side.

Mango lassis on the side helped everything go down smoothly. 

The bill, for three adults and a not-hungry five-year-old (with about a third of the food packed up in doggy bags): about 90 bucks plus tax and tip. Definitely on the pricey side for Indian restaurants.

On the whole? If I am in the neighbourhood, I'll go back - the food is definitely tasty. However, I am not sure I'd trek there from downtown T.O. just for the food - especially as there is a branch in Yorkville that I haven't yet tried!"}
{"text":"Good food, good serivce.  We ordered butter chicken(3 orders), chicken tikkah masala, jasmine rice(1 order easily serves 2), basmati rice(again 1 order easily serves 2 people) , a veggie dish (cannot remember the name), we had a bottle of white wine, a glass of red, an order of naan, and an order of pakoras....there was 5 of us and it cost us $200 (including tip).
The pakoras were good but a little heavy and greasy.  Shere Punjab on the Danforth has the best pakoras, in my opinion....light and fluffy, never greasy.
Overall, a nice dining experience, did not feel rushed...would go back."}
{"text":"Everything was great:  the atmosphere, the service, the food, the location!  We ordered eggplant curry that other reviewers were raving about, and it was really-really tasty indeed.  We will definitely come back to this place.  Food was excellent.  The patio is very nice."}
{"text":"Nice place! I don't know what Indian food \"supposed\" to taste like, but for my limited experience it tasted great, nice decorations and friendly stuff."}
{"text":"Tonight was my first time at The Host - came with a party of 10 and we had reservations.  The place itself is quite nice, I enjoyed the decor and the seating.  The restaurant was fairly empty when we arrived and didn't get much busier throughout the evening, but despite this, the service was a bit disappointing.  While our waitress was friendly, she was disorganized.  She took a long time to get our table's orders, was mixing up peoples meals, spilled water, and at the end our bill was slightly overcharged.  The food seemed to take ages to arrive which sucked, but the thing that saves this review is that the food was pretty good.  Everyone enjoyed their meals but the only downside is that we found the portions to be on  the small side.

All in all I'll give it 3/5 stars, but I feel like for a place as expensive as it is, it should have had better service."}
{"text":"Toronto has a lot of great Indian restaurants. This is my favorite Indian restaurant in Toronto. 

I'd recommend their butter chicken, matar paneer and garlic naan. Although I've been the Yorkville location, I prefer their location in Richmond Hill."}
{"text":"Went recently and food this was much better than bombay chutney.  We had pickup."}
{"text":"I first found out about this restaurant because they catered an Indian wedding I attended in Buffalo.  That food was fantastic.  The restaurant happened to be around the corner from my hotel this trip, so I couldn't resist going.  

The problem was I was by myself.  What do I order?  I wasn't going to be able to take leftovers, so getting multiple dishes would be a waste.  I told the host my problem while he was seating me.  I even told him that having sampled a large portion of their menu, I wasn't particular.  The host talked to the chef and he prepared me four small plates.  It was great!  It was tandoori chicken, butter chicken, chickpeas, and a vegetarian paneer curry.  The spices weren't hot spicy (probably, generic white guy level), but very rich.  

It was great of them to do that for me.  I just wish that places had a \"chef's choice medley\" on the menu."}
{"text":"I was here twice, once with my family and the other with my buddies because we had a conference at the hotel next door. Been here for lunch and dinner so I can tell you the first thing I can tell you are that this place is expensive for Indian food. I don't know what it is when you go to some places; the prices seemed to be so high for no reason. I mean where do you get the food, from the garden of the Taj in India? The food was ok I would not rave about, mostly because it cost so much. The lunch buffet cost $16 a person. And I think they added tip without even asking and we had left a tip on top. So very disappointed with the service and restaurant. I would not go back and I would not recommend this place especially if you are visiting this great city!!"}
{"text":"Ordered prawn curry (8 pieces = $20), butter chicken (6 pieces = $15), fish tandoori (6 pieces= $17)). Dishes were good, but they were definitely, absolutely, overpriced!! When the order came in little bowls, we were shocked. Naan was fresh, delicious. Rice, $4 a little plate. Service was so so, only extremely slow. It took 30 min for our order to come despite the place was only 1/4 capacity. Took another 20 min just to get the bill, so when they force 15% service charge that was almost non-existent, we flipped!
We only tried because we had voucher from groupon. Otherwise, it's not worth the $70 something of your hard earned money!"}
{"text":"Probably not the best Indian restaurant I've been to. It definitely is a classy restaurant, with wonderful decor. The staff were all friendly and helpful in choosing dishes. The food was expensive, so I was expecting amazing dishes. Unfortunately, the curry here did not meet my expectations, and rather fell short of it. I've had better Indian cuisine for a cheaper price. Nonetheless, it was an enjoyable dining experience."}
{"text":"This is the second time I have been to this location. The food and service was fantastic. The highlights included: veggie biryani, butter chicken, saag paneer and tandoori chicken. It was some of the best Indian food I have had. The flavors were a tantalizing fusion of northern and southern Indian cuisine. Some people may complain about pricing. However, we ordered two mixed appetizers, the biryani, butter chicken, tandoori chicken and the saag and one beer for me. This fed 5 and it was $23 per person before tip. Great stuff overall."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came to this location because it was advertised as wheelchair accessible which it most certainly is not. There were several steps down to the entrance itself which couldn't even be cleared if the wheelchair was manual and there was someone to assist. Do not go here if you have accessibility needs or if you, like myself, are disgusted that a restaurant would blatantly lie on their yelp page to the detriment of potential customers."}
{"text":"THE GOOD:
Food was superb.  Had the 6 item tasting menu and they threw in a few more.  We tried everything and have no complaints.  Lighting is kinda dark which I don't usually like, but I thought it was appropriate as it kept the dining experience quiet/intimate.  Pricing was reasonable.  We were stuffed to the gills and had a bottle of wine and coffee/tea.  It came out to approx. $55 each.

THE SO-SO: None

THE BAD:  Price is suppose.  Was seriously worth it.  The food was really well prepared."}
{"text":"It's definitely one of the better Indian restaurant in the GTA.  I had a great experience there with my office staff.  I'll bring my family next time."}
{"text":"Very good food. All the traditional favorites.
Came away completely stuffed."}
{"text":"Just went for the lunch buffet yesterday. The food has really gone down hill. I remember going to for dinner a maybe 2 years ago was sooo good. It was a little pricey. The lunch buffet is not what it used to be. The food was almost cold. I remember the place used to be busy during lunch. This time it was only half full. Servers were attentive, but also rude. Well one of them was rude. Did they change chefs? Even my boyfriend who isn't indian said it was pretty bad. I think indian takeout tastes better than this. I recommend just buying take out from silver spoon on sheppard or babu. Its cheaper and has more flavour in my opinion."}
{"text":"OMG... Can't believe this. Thought this restaurant is fine dining with some quality standards but to my shock, I spotted an employee in the washroom stepping out from toilet without washing his hands. I followed the guy and he went straight into kitchen. Disgusting!! This was disturbing experience. Not coming again, period. Reported to owner, hope there is some learning."}
{"text":"Food is great and so is the price for lunch - $12 buffet can't be beat.  Only thing is, you MUST get there early for lunch (early being 11:30am) if you plan on getting a couple servings.  We arrived there around that time, got our first plate, buffet was clear.  At 12pm, the line up was at least 20 people long.  At 12:30 it was 40.  If you only have an hour for lunch (like most), you ain't getting a second serving if you get there late.  You have been warned.

Also, usually I look for lamb curry...there was only chicken and beef for meats, no lamb.  Anyone get lamb?"}
{"text":"I went for Lunch Buffet Today, and let me tell you it was absolutely brilliant. It was simple, 4 veg curries, 4 meat curries + naan and samosas and it was 12 bucks. The quality of the curry was amazing, really some of the most flavourful curries I have had and was genuinely surprised (being a buffet). I noticed the kictchen behing the food stations, and it seems like they constant cook fresh food as needed, and it looked like a pretty clean high end kitchen. The food was fresh, and delicious, and I most definitely will be going back as I am already craving it again. :) Also, the restaurant is high end and classy, lots of windows, a good view, and very clean. Ignore anyone giving this place a bad rating they are clearly not being fair."}
{"text":"We love their Butter Chicken. The service is little bit slow but its worth to wait .  We choose to go to this restaurant because they also have Halal options."}
{"text":"Order the butter chicken and garlic naan. You will not regret it. The service is good, the location is amazing, I'm just not terribly fond of the decor (a little musky and out of date), but food-wise, it's a major win!"}
{"text":"Outstanding Indian cuisine! Enjoyed a wide variety of dishes ordered by a knowledgeable colleague for a group of 10. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"my first time here was years ago and it was not very good however, my best friend had said they had changed chef and it is a must try.  Sure enough, she was right! All th dishes were delicious and it came out piping hot.  The murg mitch tikka (green chicken) was moist and tender.  The butter chicken was also tasty and very rich and creamy.  Love it with all the sauce on the rice or on the naan.  Also tried the kofta ...veggie balls. A bit on the spicy side but loved it too!!!  Service was great and kept filling the water for us.  Highly recommend this place if you want Indian food in Richmond Hill!"}
{"text":"By far one of the best Indian restaurants that I have ever been to. Yes, it's pricier than your average Indian fare, but the amazing customer service and unparalelled quality of the food make it worth it. In my undergrad, my roommates and I would save up specifically just to go here on our birthdays and for special occassions! There's a specific waiter in general (I never got his name, but he's tall and young-looking *UPDATE: his name is Sumit, so if you're planning on going to the host and have him as your server, you'll leave a happy diner!) who is the absolute sweetest, always going above and beyond to make sure our dining experience was a good one, and even remembering us and our orders the next time we came.  I'd go so far as to say he is one of the best servers I've ever had, at any establishment. The atmosphere is also great for a girls' night out, date, or family dinner. LOVE, love, love the Host.

Must-trys:
-Their chicken tikka masala (I never used to be a fan of Indian food. This dish from the Host totally changed my opinion and converted me to a fan!)
-Their garlic naan (better bring some gum for after this, folks: The Host is very generous for their garlic, and it pays off! So scrumptious.)"}
{"text":"One of the best Indian restaurants in Toronto. The food gets better with every visit. Fish kebab, butter chicken, lamb rogan Josh, naan is fabulous. The place to go for delicately prepared dishes and the best service in town."}
{"text":"Went here for Winterlicious lunch. I had the spinach and cheese stuffed naan and the butter chicken with rice. My partner had the samosas, chicken tikka masala and rice. Both mains were great, but the naan tasted like it was made from a package of Pillsbury crescent rolls. I opted for the cheese balls for dessert, since they were out of the saffron ice cream, and they were quite good. My partner got the rice pudding and it was thin, milky and kind of bland.

We waited a long time to order our food. We waited a long time between courses. And we waited a long time again for the bill. There was one waiter and someone else who seemed to be the owner helped out - both were unfriendly. The restaurant was busy, so it's understandable to have to wait a bit. But it was disorganized chaos at its finest. For example, the table beside us had to ask to order after waiting for ten minutes and was told to \"just wait a minute.\" When their order was finally taken, we waited an additional ten minutes even though we were there first. I've been a server and it makes the most sense to take orders from two tables that are next to each other, write them down, and then input them at the same time. 

Do not go here if you're looking for a quick bite to eat. It took almost an hour and a half to order, eat and pay for three courses, which is double the amount of time we spent at a different restaurant the week before. I would consider coming back, but not before trying other Indian restaurants. I doubt this is as good as it gets in Toronto."}
{"text":"Un très bon restaurant indien dans un quartier huppé de la ville. Qualité, service et gros prix sont au rendez-vous. Nous recommandons tout particulièrement le fameux 'Saag paneer', cette purée d'épinard et de fromage indien."}
{"text":"I've eaten here once before. The food is pretty good. However, I took my girlfriend and some friends there for my girlfriend's birthday. We called in advance because we were expecting a big party. No reservations no problem. We were told they'd fit us in. 

 We arrive there's a wait. No problem again. Our group ended up being only four people I put our name in and our told it'll be 25 minutes and the next table is ours. Fast forward an hour and a half and having watched them sit 4 tables of three, all of which who arrived after us, they finally sit us. Not a word to us in the hour and a half we stood there waiting. Once sat they tell us we need to order quickly as their kitchen is closing in ten minutes. We explain what had happened since, I guess, the 4 people standing infront of the cash for an hour were invisible. The server is smiles and laughs as we explain this. We ended up calling  another Indian restaurant (Banjara) told them what happened and they stayed open an extra half hour for us. 

I would suggest to actively avoid this place unless you are friends with the owners."}
{"text":"Butter chicken and cheese stuffed naan were soooooo goooooood! Ordered through ubereat and the food was really good. Only downside was that they didnt give us any spoons nor forks..."}
{"text":"The reviews are true!  This place has great (though sometimes slow, but nonetheless great) service and DELICIOUS food.  Beautiful atmosphere too."}
{"text":"This was my first time at The Host. I made reservations for 8:00pm on a Friday night and I'm glad I did as it was quite busy. 

The decor was OK. The food on the other hand was surprisingly good. We ordered Chicken Jhangiri, Dal Makhni, Garlic Naan, Onion Kulcha and Raita. Everything was delicious and full of flavour. I was expecting to have realtively average indian food based on the reviews on Yelp, but I wanted to go because I had a 2-1 dinner coupon. I am very happy I came here, because I really enjoyed my meal. However, it was overpriced, but that's what you get at \"fine dining\" indian restaurants."}
{"text":"The Host is one of Toronto's finest Indian dining establishments.  I have been making quarterly pilgrimages to this cornerstone of Canadian curry consciousness since the mid 90s and disappointment is never on the menu.

Classic Northern Indian cuisine is prepared here with an attention to detail lacking in many similar establishments.   All of the constituent ingredients in the dishes manage to retain a presence that simultaneously affords them their deserved attention yet manages to maintain a harmonious melding of the flavours orchestrated by the chef. 

The Host is not your every day sub-continental dining experience.  Both the overall demeanor of the room, menu , and wait staff conspire to make it an ideal destination for a date for any two people who enjoy Indian food, or an excellent introduction to one of those vestigial relics (older family members, visiting rural folk, reformed recluse, or those otherwise just now joining/re-joining society) who have yet to sample a proper curry. It should be noted that those same elements make this spot far less appealing for more raucous parties or those who enjoy their feedbags based purely on a price to quantity metric. 

Quite simply, The Host manages to regularly display all of the culinary elements of classical Northern Indian cuisine with calm certitude and just enough playful elements to constantly earn themselves a return visit."}
{"text":"The quality of this place seems to have gone down over time.  Now they have average food which is overpriced.  The Lamb Rogangosh dish was flavourless, with meat which tasted like it was a week old.  I do not intend to come here again."}
{"text":"Best Indian touch Buffet in Mississauga. The buffet is worth it."}
{"text":"A visit to The Host on a Sunday was a definite letdown for what I had hoped to have been a higher quality fare of Indian cuisine in the downtown core. In a nutshell, everything tasted muted and significantly flavourless to its other Indian counterparts.

As noted on their website as being the winner of the best butter chicken contest by the Toronto Star, one would expect nothing less than taste bud delight. However, disappointingly, the dish did not maintain a rich mouth feel nor did it have a distinctive flavour - none of it lingered. My assumption is that they use a ratio of less cream to more tomato paste. 

To further underwhelm, the Chef's Sampler of three different kinds of Tandoori chicken, had the result of them all having the same flavour profile. It then made me question the type and duration of marinades each one had. Furthermore, they were all dry. 

Lastly, please avoid the Tadka Dal (yellow lentils) at all cost since what is expected is a watery and uninspired mess of bland blah - something one would find eating whilst in hospital. Disappointed and frustrated, I loathe the ugly bill on my card."}
{"text":"The butter chicken is fantastic. The best I've ever had. Paired with the naan, you just can't go wrong. The prices are a bit on the high side, therefore four stars."}
{"text":"For Indian food in the trendy area of Toronto this place is simple awesome. Food is great with freshness that is rare in Indian restaurant scene."}
{"text":"Went with a large group. Food was abundant and very good. I'm not sure of the names of what we had but I enjoyed it all. Loved the spicy lamb chops and naan bread. Server was efficient but not friendly. He kept reaching across me to serve the food, putting his arm in my face over and over again, not once apologizing.  It was annoying and rude."}
{"text":"We went to the Host on a Sunday lunch. The restaurant was busy but we didn't have to wait to be seated and started our buffet lunch right away. The food was cooked fresh and served hot. There was not so many choices of food but it was enough for us. All of the food were tasty more than we thought. we will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Disappointed - The Host has deteriorated in a number of aspects. Whilst the food is tasty, not very spicy and not at all greasy, two things work against it. Firstly the service is pathetic. It takes forever for the servers to arrive and then very long to obtain your order. Example - I ordered mango lassi - it took 25 minutes and 3 reminders to arrive! The prices have gone through the roof too - $5.25 for two gulab Jammu's - seriously? I found the worst part is that they do not care about the customer - I had told the waiter at the very beginning of the meal that we were celebrating my 60th birthday party (we were a group of 18) and could he please bring a candle with dessert - the candle never arrived! Shows you really how much the emphasis is on making money rather than pleasing the customer."}
{"text":"3 of us arrived around 7 on a Friday night with no reservations and no wait.  There were lots of seats.  No complaints about the service either.  It was attentive and responsive.

We ordered all veggie dishes, and I find that at many Indian restaurants, they kind of blend together.  Nothing really distinguishes the taste of one from the other.  In this case, the flavours were distinct and delicious.  I especially liked the dal.  Great naan too.

I'm not sure it's worth the schlep to Richmond Hill if you live downtown, but if you're in the area..."}
{"text":"Waited 1 hour for our appetizer and curry. I thought the chef quit on the spot as it was a busy night and everyone was waiting extremely long for their food. It does not take 1 hour to warm up pre cooked dal makhani and chicken.

The chicken sizzler was burnt when it arrived at our table. $20 for a burnt appetizer.

The chicken tikka masala was below average and their dal was alright.
I think the 1 hour wait just really ruined our meal."}
{"text":"Came here for a company dinner and ordered a ton of appetizers and mains to share family style. To be completely honest, I wasn't really blown away nor impressed by this place. Moreover, the service was super slow... Or maybe that was only because I was hungry (or should I say hangry?).

We started off with a variety of appetizers, many of them fried. To be completely honest, I only remember the lamb kebabs (which were oily but very delicious) and the pakora platter. I also ordered a mango lassi, and though good, it ended up being too sickeningly sweet and I ultimately couldn't bring myself to finish the entire thing.

We then ordered a bunch of mains to share. Since we were a group of 9 seated at a long table, we chose to split into two separate groups and do our own individual ordering. My side of the table ordered the Murgh Mirch Tikka, a green chicken where the colour comes from the chili paste. It was decent, but as I made my way to the second piece, I found it quite overbearing. We also got the tandoori lamp chops, and these were heavenly! They came hot on a sizzling plate, and were fairly lean and well seasoned. In terms of the vegetarian options, we ordered the paneer tawa masala (which I didn't get a chance to try) and the chana masala, a fragrant mix of chickpeas. We then also ordered a butter chicken, which fell flat for me in terms of taste, and a lamb roganjosh. Though the lamb was flavourful, it wasn't as good as the lamb chops by any means. We also got a TON of garlic naan and two plates of kesari pillaw to share. The garlic naan strongly resembled garlic bread; the pillowy buttery naan was smothered in a rich garlic butter. So sinful but so good!

The other side of the table likewise ordered the chana masala, but also got the navrattan korma I believe. I thoroughly enjoyed the Malabar shrimp curry that they ordered; it was delightfully creamy and rich.

Overall, a decent meal, though I wouldn't consider it amazing."}
{"text":"Food was alright - I've had better for cheaper.

Service was HORRIBLE. 

I am never going back here again."}
{"text":"Ive had lots of indian food in my life, and although not an expert, I must say that I did not enjoy The Host.
We tried the chicken tikka masala, lamb roganjosh, tandoori chicken, and saag paneer. The chicken dishes were both EXTREMELY dry, and the tandoori chicken was left partially untouched for this reason. The lamb roganjosh seemed to have the spice ratio all confused, as all we tasted was something similar to coriander. The paneer was the best dish of the night. 
The rice and naan was pretty average. 
Overall, we did not really enjoy the meal and the prices were very high for mediocre dishes with very few pieces of meat."}
{"text":"Great service. Quality food. Nice ambience. Keep up the Good work"}
{"text":"First of all let me say you do get good food here but this review is mainly about the service which spoiled our overall experience. I have been here before and have received good service and delicious food. Today I was terribly disappointed with our server - Jay who spoiled the entire experience for us.

I went there today with a group of 15. For a certain sized groups they charge a 15% tip directly added to the bill. 

I think because the server \"Jay\" knew of this, he gave us the worst service ever. For one of our orders he went to check on something in the kitchen, and when he returned with information we asked him to modify something. He simply said no I put in your order and now it cannot be changed. It had hardly made it to the kitchen. He had plenty of time to change it. Hell he should have waited for our confirmation after he returned with information to place the order.

Asked for a specific paratha, but got something else. 

Once we were served he never came back to check on us once or even refill water. 

He was only interested in us leaving with a tip that we didn't intend to leave but had to with their policy.

If you want to go here and get some good service, go in smaller groups where they actually have to provide good service to earn a tip.

I am normally a person that would at minimum leave a 10% tip even with a not so good service but here today almost everyone at the table felt the server didn't deserve to get anything more than 0%"}
{"text":"Ordered the samosas, chicken tikka masala, lamb roganjosh, and garlic naan. The chicken was basic but very good regardless. I preferred the lamb."}
{"text":"After spending the day at the ROM, I needed to find a place nearby before I headed off to a baseball game. I wanted something decently priced, as well as sit down. I looked around on yelp and found this restaurant! I decided to give it a try and I'm very happy I did. Since I was getting an early dinner (530 pm), I was one of the first people in the restaurant and was sat right away. I ordered the matar paneer, butter naan, rice, and mango lassi. Everything was very delicious and the naan were huge pieces, so you could share it easily with two to three people. I think if you got what I ordered, minus the drink, it can be split between two people! The service was great, too, as my water glass was always filled and the servers were attentive and nice! I highly recommend eating at The Host!! Lastly, the price of the meal was perfect. For everything I got, it was CA$26 and I know I will get another meal or two from my leftovers."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 3 stars but it was really 3.5 stars. The patio outside was nice but the ambience inside was pretty dark. The food was good. I ordered the Chana Masala with Chilli Coriander Naan and my friend ordered the Lamb Roganjosh with Garlic Naan. Both items were pretty good. They didn't come out with rice, which is what I'm used to so that was different. The location was great though because it's near the Royal Ontario Museum. It's also reasonably priced for this area of Toronto."}
{"text":"Today is the first day of winterlicious. What better restaurant to start off the winterlicious season with Host.  Let me start off with they kept  the restaurant open late for us(I called to make a reservations before hand(30 min)). We were the only customers in the restaurant. The food is amazing. The butter chicken really is número uno. They also gave us extra fruit that wasn't part of the menu. All in all they went above and beyond the call of duty both in food and service. Definite repeat"}
{"text":"You can't beat the Host buffet for price and taste.  I really don't think you could hope to sample the wide variety of Indian dishes for the price anywhere in North America.  As Yasoon indicated, this is a great place to get an introduction to Indian cuisine.  Even with all of the awesome Chinese and Japanese restaurants in the vicinity, this one is worth a try."}
{"text":"I have been frequenting the Host's Indian restaurants for many many years now. Since being established in 1997, owners and brothers Sanjeev and Jay Sethi have made quite a name with the Host dynasty. Owning three locations respectively in Mississauga, Richmond Hill, and Yorkville, the Host has prided itself on quality Indian food and good service. 

Over the past few years however the prices of dishes have increased, with the quality of food being hit or miss on several occasions. At times the food is too salty and sometimes too greasy. So... I will tell you how to absolutely get the biggest bang for your buck in two words: LUNCH BUFFET. 

The Host lunch buffet at $9.99 is arguably the greatest deal that exists in my arsenal of lunch venues. I really don't understand how they rationalize the insane concept, but I will attempt to recall to the best of my ability the Richmond Hill Buffet experience. 

The buffet consists of a salad bar with many items like raita (yogurt, cucumber, spice concoction - must have), plate of sliced red onions (must have), and many other pasta dishes and Indian condiments. 

Rice is always available in either basmati or yellow rice (dyed with turmeric) form, followed by fried appetizers such as pakoras and onion bhajis accompanied by mint and tamarind chutney.  Next in line are the fresh naans which you can see the chef retrieving from the walls of the tandoor from the clear glass window. The clear window is equipped with a little sliding door so that the chefs can replace the naans and tandoori chicken with ease. 

The mains begin with veggie dishes which alternate from day to day. You can expect to find at any given time: Saag Paneer - puréed spinach and cheese, Malai Matar Paneer - peas and cheese in a tomato cream sauce,  Dal Makhni - slow cooked black lentils with cream or butter, Channa Masala - chick peas roasted into a curry with Indian spices, or Aloo Gobhi - fried cauliflower and potato medley just to name a few. 

The meat dishes as well are alternating daily except for the Murgh Makhni (Butter Chicken), you can expect to find that dish there every day Mon-Fri. Other meat dishes they may offer are: Lamb Roganjosh - lamb curry with yogurt and spices such as saffron, Beef Curry, or Beef Vindaloo - A goan curry with a rich sauce. As for the butter chicken, it is typically the best tasting meat curry they offer.  It is rich and sweet in flavour, good consistency, and they are generous with the chicken. Best butter chicken around? Negative, but well stellar on a good day.  

After the meat curries is a South Indian inspired station complete with Idli's (soft rice patties), Sambar - a vegetable and pigeon pea stew, Dosa - crepe like item made out of rice and lentils, and various chutneys made from coconut, tomato and tamarind. 

All in all a great spread for an Indian buffet. One may find some dishes to be hit or miss, but overall

Overall many of the dishes at Host can be hit or miss depending on the day you go. However, the lunch buffet is truly a steal. Take for example the Butter Chicken dish priced out at roughly $13.99 on the dinner menu (like most restaurants), at the Buffet this dish is all you can eat in a massive bowl for $9.99! Not to mention all the other dozens of items available all you can eat. Bang for your buck I would rank host as the #1 indian buffet joint. If you were to come for dinner I will warn the menu is pretty big. You will find many traditional dishes with modern and gourmet twists, but you'll have to really pay for them.   

Buffet all the way, but if you can't make lunch try them out for dinner. It will be expensive but the Host has the potential to bang out some great food."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, good service, solid ambiance."}
{"text":"There is a much better place on Deneson called Taste of India. The Host is far to oily and the selection if very limited."}
{"text":"I came here with a group of around 20 people for Winterlicious, and though I wouldn't crave the food here enough to come back (the way I do with Banjara) - it was a decent dining experience for a one time thing.

For Winterlicious, I believe it was around $20 or under for a price-fix lunch, where we could choose an appetizer, entree, and dessert. For my appetizer, I got the vegetarian papadi chaat, which was basically just papadi covered with sweet yogurt and tamarind chutney. There was no red chili powder, channa, or cilantro to spice this chaat up. It was so hard to finish that thing! Then, I got the vindaloo chicken as my entree. The chicken vindaloo was spiced well (very different from tomato-based butter chicken, as it is more spicy and contains palm vinegar, chillies, ginger and spices). The curry came with a side of lentils, which were actually pretty good. The best part of the whole experience, though, was that our whole table got unlimited rice and naans to eat with our curries. Finally, for dessert the server brought out varieties of rasmalai, kulfi, and gulab jamun for the table to share. None of them really piqued my interest or would be worth ordering if I wasn't eating on a price-fixed menu.

Overall, the private dining room made the experience feel a bit more upscale than other Indian restaurants. But ultimately, I care more about food than ambience when it comes to Indian restaurants, and can't say that I fell in love with this place enough to want to come back."}
{"text":"The Host Used to blow me away back in 06/07 now... not \"meh\"... not so much. I went in September 2014.

Decent sized Naan- won't knock them down there... love the garlic.
Murgh Makhani/Butter Chicken - used to be the real deal, it was not as good recently
Vegetarian curries - mediocre
Ambience - 7/10, its pretty inside... but i swear those bangle decorations were missing when i went, I hope it was temporary
Service - decent enough. Polite.

Would I come here again, given the price and the quality of food I experienced, eehhh.. maybe. If the prices were a little lower, it'd be yes. It is expensive.

Is it good to crave your  Indian food craving if you want a nice dining experience... yes?

If you want a group dinner, they have a nice side room where they will serve you food."}
{"text":"I came here for the lunch buffet. - VERY worth the price. I absolutely loved the butter chicken and the naan. The dessert, is not really something I enjoyed, and variety isn't as abundant as other restaurants in other cities. However, for the price and quality - this place is great. The only reason I only give it 3 was because, I wished there were more variety of dishes."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been to this restaurant twice, most recently on Valentine's day where there was a set menu.

We had butter chicken and curry lamb, as well as a number of various appetizers. Previously we had had the beef vindaloo. All the food was well prepared, and the vindaloo was relatively spicy. I liked the butter chicken because it wasn't as rich as it can be at many Indian restaurants. If you want good Indian food in this area, which is dominated by Chinese restaurants, it's a pretty safe bet.

The atmosphere is nice and the service is friendly.

The area has brutal traffic since it's near the 404, but the underground parking is free and convenient."}
{"text":"All 3 times I have been there the food has been excellent. The chicken dishes were quite flavourful and fresh. Naans were soft and freshly made. Service for the most part was awful. One time we lucked out and had a great waiter but the other 2 times it was typical uncaring service which is ubiquitous among most of the Indian restaurants in North America. Prices are very high. Maybe discount the prices by 20 pct for the horrible service. To justify eating at this place, I only tipped the one time. The other 2 times they should have tipped me for putting up with their disgusting service."}
{"text":"The restraunt location is good. The food is average. Not great and not bad. The quantity is less, One dish is sufficient for one person and not two.  The service E is good and the staff is good too. They will ask you about your experience which is a good thing."}
{"text":"Overhyped! It was our bad luck that we chosen this restaurant for celebrating our special day. We didn't liked a single item of this restaurant! According to the taste the prices are too much. And can you imagine they don't have Dessert section?!? Oh god... Indian cuisine is incomplete without dessert. How come they don't have dessert section in their menu?"}
{"text":"I went to this place for my birthday dinner (okay... ONE of my birthday dinners.... I'm a massive foodie, okay??), and I thought everything about it was good. Decent decor, okay service, pretty good food.... but at the end of the day, nothing was really memorable about it. Nothing screamed \"wow\" for me (which is why it took me a long time to get around to writing a review of it). I'm a big fan of indian food, especially spicy dishes and anything with paneer, and I thought their panner dish was solid and the butter chicken was alright. But I haven't thought about those dishes since... typically when I have a great dish, I crave it again soon enough. Not this time. *Shrug*. So I don't have anything negative to say, but nothing really popped for me."}
{"text":"Same quality and cheaper elsewhere now. This place has gone downhill over the years. The service and quality could be a lot better."}
{"text":"Amazing service, food, and delightful cozy place! Complementary appetizer, great butter chicken (server suggested we split the nan/rice) and we were constantly tended on and impressed. Will definitely come again!"}
{"text":"First time having Indian food was at The Host. I loved it. Wait staff is very friendly. Food was prepared quickly and tasted great. Whenever I am in Mississauga I'll be returning here!"}
{"text":"Great ambience, customer service and good tasty food! 

Quantity is smaller compared to the pricey menu! Otherwise authentic taste for Indian food!!! 

Good job!"}
{"text":"The food is soooo good and the service is too. My dads the pickiest eater ever. This is the only place that makes him happy everytime"}
{"text":"Came in from California for a family visit, and my father treated us to Sunday lunch there. The food was out of this world. It was buffet, and I was so sorry I couldn't eat endlessly! Very much look forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"When I went there the first time I thought their buffet was nice. Had some goat curry, butter chicken I think and some desert. But when I went there a second time it wasn't that great. It seems people pick out the meat pieces from the curries and then you are left with sauce and bones only. Wasn't too great because of that.

Doubt I will go back."}
{"text":"if you want to spend the next 24 hours on the toilet, this is the place for you.  As for me i will never go back.  If i could give it 0 stars i would"}
{"text":"I have been to the Host in all other locations and I have to say this is the worst of them all. We walked in at opening time at 4 and were stuck in the restaurant until 7pm not because we were having a great time but because service was so poor and slow. A cup of tea took exactly 30 minutes to arrive at bugging the waiter. The food was okay - appetizers were stale, the main course was good and delivery of food in fancy containers was fun. Overall, the waiter completely ignored our table and even the bill took forever to arrive. We felt stranded and trapped."}
{"text":"We had a fabulous dinner. Naan as always the BEST. We also had the murg mirch masala. Only thing was the lamb vindaloo, the meat was over done and very chewy. Otherwise, well worth the price."}
{"text":"We love this place - have been coming here for over five years. I strongly recommend ordering a la carte -- the food is amazing. The buffet is good but honestly as with any buffet you will just get the people pleasers.  The waiters are so kind and have been here forever. Best place for Indian by far in the entire area. We also just love their Yorkville location...."}
{"text":"Hobos Eat Better !!

Me and my friends went to the Host in Richmond hill for lunch buffet, it was the worst dining experience I ever had. I must say even eating at fast food restaurants like McDonald's is better than this. We walked in and there was no one to take care of us. We had to go ask a waiter walking around about the price of the buffet. Then he told us to sit at a table and we didn't get served water until we finished one round of food. The waiter doesn't talk to you or look at your face also. He just takes the dishes and walks away. The buffet food is not refilled on time.
 
Even while leaving we had to goto the entrance and ask someone so that we could pay. It took us 15mins to wait for someone so that we could pay and leave.
A lot of people come here to eat if they want to try out indian food for the first time. Many of these people are employees of companies located nearby. It just gives a very bad impression of India and Indian food. 

Please don't waste your time and money on this sucky indian food and as an add on you also get treated like you don't exist."}
{"text":"I've eaten and ordered from the Host at the Prince Arthur location many dozens of times, however tonight's food was a unpalatable mess. 
We ordered through Orderit Canada, and what arrived was the food you would expect from a strip mall buffet: Kesri Pillaw (boring yellow coloured rice), Tandoori Murg Chicken (red brushed chicken with no flavor what-so-ever), Khandani Nan (doughy tasteless flatbread), and Lamb Roganjosh (a thin, unsavoury curry sauce lacking in the right balance of sweet and salty spices). 

We called Order It to complain, and The Host as well. Incredibly, the manager - Indrani said that she hears about these horrible complaints \"everyday\"! She also said that we should complain about it on dining sites so that the owner wakes up to the cheap Indian labour that he is hiring. 

An expensive waste of money on what use to be one of Toronto's best quality Indian restaurants."}
{"text":"Beautiful atmosphere, great food though I preferred a bit more of an authentic taste, not very good service and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"The food was amazing. But the customer service was not good at all. The waiter we got was so rude. When we try to ask a question it was like he never wanted to answer, and he was being so rude about it. The customer service is just not good at all."}
{"text":"I wish it wasn't so because I was really craving some yummy Indian food while house-sitting in Mississauga but... this was the worst Indian food I have ever eaten. It was completely lacking in flavour. It tasted like water with peas floating inside of it. I was starving when I picked up my take out order and then I couldn't even finish it I found it so bad. I made myself a sandwich for dinner instead. I wouldn't return to this place if they paid me. Sorry, but I will definitely be sticking to my tested and loved Indian restaurants from now on."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch one day.  Was half empty when arrived and was seated right away. The staff were welcoming and nice. There was a variety of stuff but it seems some of the areas were closed off for the lunch period so it was slightly disappointing to know I was missing out not coming for dinner. The food was decent and for someone who wants to try a variety of food, I'd recommend here."}
{"text":"On the food and ambiance side of this restaurant, my rating gets pulled a little lower. Some of the things we ordered (such as the Chicken 65) were loved by all at our table. Delicious spice and as it came recommended by our server, we were definitely not disappointed. Other things, for example the Chana Masala that I ordered for myself, was a little on the disappointing side. It wasn't the flavour I expected from the dish, and I left about 80% of it in the bowl when I was finished.
The atmosphere of the restaurant was debatable. They have a nice welcoming feel to the decor, and the table that our party of 8 sat at was the perfect size, giving everyone their own personal space without the gaps between each seat being too distant. We were unfortunately seated right beside the large glass window, so even though the food was warm, we were all freezing from all the cold air that seemed to be coming in. We even had to put our jackets back on! We did ask them to adjust the heat and they did (a couple times) but it didn't entirely help.
The waiting service at this restaurant was excellent. The waiter who took care of us was welcoming and made it a point to try and relate to us, joke around, make some recommendations, and make sure we were happy with our meal. Will likely go back for any of the non-veg dishes."}
{"text":"We ate here on a Saturday night during Summerlicious 2010. My experience was far from seamless but, unlike many other restaurants, especially in this neighbourhood, is that they did try to correct many of the problems, and this is what I appreciated most.

We arrived early for our 7:30 reservation to get a seat on the Patio and they said one would be ready in 5-10 minutes. We returned then but no table was available, so they put an extra table and made room for us.

Drink orders were taken 15 minutes after we sat down and they were out of Mill Street. I ordered a Cobra instead (an Indian lager) and it was quite  good. Drinks came 5 minutes later. The appetizers came about 20 minutes later and dinner came about 45 minutes after that. The waiter did apologize and bring me a free beer to make up for the delay, which was appreciated. 

The whole dinner took from 7:30 until 9:15 at which point I had to ask for the cheque so we wouldn't be late for the movie. We had to skip dessert. They braught some pistachio ice cream with the cheque and we had a few bites while I waited for them to swipe the card but I wasn't thriled with the taste.


The food was excellent (Muligitawney and Samoasa to start and Tandoori and Vindaloo for the main). The dinner portions were a good size, but while the appetizers also tasted excellent they were very very small.

I was surprised that everything was so slow because most reviews I read said the service was excellent. I could chock it up to a Saturday during Summerlicious but they should be prepared during this busy month.

Regardless, I do recommend that people try this place. It would be a 4 star review had things come on time."}
{"text":"Really surprised. Came here with an entertainment coupon and didn't know if it'd be good, but their own special butter chicken is the best I've had in GTA, like the ones I've had in Hong Kong and better than ones I tried in India. The goat was spot on too. We got the bread basket, and two curries plus that bread basket was just right for the three of us (when the curries first came they looked small, but worked out). 

Highly recommended if you know your Indian food and like flavourful.

The Papadaums (rolled) in the beginning were a great welcome, followed by hot towels at the end. Fine dining indeed."}
{"text":"Astonishingly disappointing...!
My wife and I used to have such high regard and fond memories of this restaurant, since we had enjoyed our experience many years ago (Valentines Dinner in the gazebo!), Over the past few years we have highly recommended so many people and friends to this restaurant, but no more. We had a party of 8 for dinner on Jan. 3rd, and all of us were shocked at the dismal, sloppy service from the waiters, simply put. The Tier 1 service that we remembered The Host for had shockingly fallen to Tier 3, at best. Plopping down tableware, clanging flatware into empty plates, neglecting to write down orders that were soon forgotten, neglecting to serve water, serving mains before appetizers...I'm reaching the max. character/word limit here! Otherwise, the food itself is fine, albeit nothing to write home about, quite possibly devastated by the abysmal service.

To Do: Delete The Host from Contacts list
Done."}
{"text":"I went here for the lunch buffet & I was very satisfied with the food. The selection wasn't amazing, but of the food that was there, everything was delicious & you can get as much as you want! The butter chicken & tandoori chicken was the best. The decor of the place was also very interesting, giving it a nice ambiance. During lunch, it's not too busy, so the waiters were attentive & very nice. 

I recommend this place if you're craving endless amounts of butter chicken :) which is how I feel sometimes, a lot of the time."}
{"text":"The food and ambience was great but the servers need to be trained on proper serving etiquette. Cannot discount their politeness though. Price was on the reasonable side considering that it was a fine dining restaurant.

The food was very authentic. Not being an Indian or a Pakistani person, I was able tell the difference compared to the famous Canadian buffet Indian restaurant. Had the Chicken Tikka Masala which was really good. My wife liked the Chicken Biriyani. My cousin had the Chicken Kebab and he liked that too.

The restaurant and the ambience makes it feel homely.

The server Sheveta was very polite, always with a smile and engaging.

However, those who brought the food to the table on many occasions served my wife across me. They never bothered to go upto her except for once out of the four time (aprox) they came to the table. It was the same even for water. My uncle was a veteran Banquets Manager of the Oberoi Hotel chain and I remember him pulling up his staff when this etiquette was violated. Defeats the term \"fine dining.\""}
{"text":"Came here for the summerlicious menu, I got the Samosa appetizer, saag paneer and gulub Juman. My boyfriend got the butter chicken as his main, both were great, the presentation was fantastic and cane with lots of naan (as it is offered on the menu as either naan or rice) however the main dish is served with basmati rice a side of daal makhni and a side salad, there is a bit of a wait but the food was fantastic, we both left more than satisfied! They don't skim on the main with summerlicious as many restaurants do, they care about detail and the food is perfect and authentic, the menu has so many options as well! I highly recommend for summerlicious for people who love Indian food and tons of options!"}
{"text":"The Host was the first Indian restaurant I ever tried. I didn't know what I was ordering but it didn't seem to matter because everything was delicious. 

Favs are butter chicken,  samosa, eggplant, naan, vindaloo shrimp, lamb kabobs,  wafer thin warm cracker with cumin, curry beef

Chai tea is awesome. I didn't think it would like it but I was pleasantly surprised.  Amazing stuff."}
{"text":"Butter chicken is very good. Highly recommend the eggplant. Naan is delicious. Portions are very generous. Come hungry. The food is very filling and heavy. Good quality.  Nice Yorkvile location.  Very reasonably priced. Two people can eat for less than 50 dollars."}
{"text":"Went for a kids birthday in the party room for lunch today. The room is quite cozy and good enough for 25-30 adults and a few kids. The food in the buffet was quite good. A little less greasier than the rest. They had idlis, medu vadas samosas spring rolls and chat - bhel paani poori etc. and masala dosas as well. The lady making it seemed very slow and not geared for service. All the rest of the food servers and wait staff were amazing. Personally I don't like naan and prefer tandoor roti. They made it right away and also sent a couple more later. The saag in buffet was a welcome change. The dessert choices were quite good as well. Go for service and then food."}
{"text":"Having dined in many countries fine restaurant, I would consider Host to be in \" good\" category."}
{"text":"Came here for summerlicious but decided on ordering off the regular menu.

Sevices was good but we were also the first in the restaurant. I typically rate service based on how often they refill my free water without asking...and they were excellent.

The Nan bread was great...I ordered two..one would have been enough since it was so large...especially if you ordered rice as well.

The beef vindaloo was good but the beef was kind of tough.

The tandoori chicken was okay...a bit dry for me.

All in all I liked the restaurant and would go back.

Not sure why I didn't rate it a 4...3.5 for sure..."}
{"text":"First of all I'm Indian. This place is lame, the food has really little amount of flavor, the service is shitty, the waiter didn't want to do anything like fill waters or get us some naan. Don't go here go somewhere way better like literally any other Indian place ex earth or motimahal"}
{"text":"The Host has been around for a while now and is practically an institution for slightly higher scale indian dining in Toronto. I've been to this restaurant many times over the years and very much enjoy it. I feel that it is both a good place to take my family and a good place to take non-indians looking to be \"cultured\". On my last visit I had the Sunday buffet, which is actually a pretty good deal. I enjoyed the food, the dining experience was clean, and the people who were working were pretty courteous and nice. 


Agreeable there are possibly better places in like Mississauga, and also so other places which are better in terms of price but not with the atmosphere. Host is probably the best combination of atmosphere, food, service and location for people not living in Mississauga or downtown.  I would probably go back here in the future as I really enjoy eating here,"}
{"text":"Disappointed with the food and service. We ordered briyani, fish sizzlers and chicken. There is no value for money. Worst briyani in the city. In Sizzlers no much taste or any flavour.  I have requested for cutlers and plates but was not delivered. Total waste of money for the food and service offered by them."}
{"text":"Decided to come for lunch with family.. Best decision ever.
Coming here for the only the second time since they renovated this place about 18 months back. Very good décor and ambiance. Comfortable feeling. 
Food was ravishingly good: every course from appetizers (aloo tikki, pani puri) to south indian to main dishes (butter chicken, tandoori chicken, paneer, etc)
Naan was fresh, hot and soft. Bonus: chicken biryani..one of the best I have ever had. Chicken was falling off the bone. 
Expanded desert section: kheer, gulab jamun, custard, gajar ka halwa plus ice cream..Didn't try each as I was too full by then. 
If there were 7 stars available, I would rate this place as 7/7.
The best indian buffet in Mississauga, a must-go."}
{"text":"Recently hosted an engagement dinner at The Host and had the most wonderful experience. Veenu was our main contact and he was extremely reliable, personable, and attentive. On the day of, staff were so on top of everything and made sure guests needs were being met. Food tasted delicious and servings were plentiful. I truly could not have asked for a more fantastic experience. Special thanks to the staff and Veenu for all your hard work."}
{"text":"The Host.

     Lunch Buffet perfect setup for Business Lunches and Foreign Visitors.
     Allows them to avoid the expectations of Fine Dining services.
     Also lets customer come and go without the wait of scratch cooking.

     Dinner is more Full-services Fine Dining which tends to be less busy.
     The Managers are more outgoing than the Water-pouring at Lunch.
     Flavours are pleasant but not too intense which fits the community.

{"text":"We were seated right away during the lunch hour. 

Good selection of meat and veggie options in the lunch only buffet.  Very good food quality. 

Service wasn't spectacular as we had to track down our bill."}
{"text":"Excellent Indian food. The owner is a wonderful person and the restaurant is very well run. I also enjoy their Mississauga location which is closer to my home.  They also do catering which is convenient when we host a larger gathering at our home."}
{"text":"In comparison, you can get the same quality food in Scarborough for much much cheaper!"}
{"text":"My family decided we should go out to eat and decided we wanted to try out this new restaurant and was sadly disappointed. While the food was acceptable at best, the food did not match up to the pricing. For $10.95 to get a couple pieces of chicken 65 is not worth it and with almost spending up to $100 worth of food to receive burnt naan and a rock found in the lamb briyani is not acceptable whatsoever. While the atmosphere was nice and the staff were helpful the food is not worth the pricing. I don`t plan on coming back here again."}
{"text":"Came for lunch buffet yesterday. Not quite sure how much it costed, but less than $20 after tax per person. It was my first time at The Host after almost a decade, so I wasn't quite sure how it worked. We weren't given any menus, so we assumed that the only option was the lunch buffet (no obvious signs as to how much that costed, or whether that was the only choice). We just kinda followed everyone else into the food room.

They had most of my favorite Indian foods (curry goat, butter chicken, palak paneer, tandoori chicken, etc), as well as some I hadn't tried before (kale pakoras, and a whole ton that I can't name for the life of me) that were also tasty. The quality of the food was good and the food was hot and fresh. 

I'd consider coming again. I was so stuffed after eating lunch here that I didn't really need to have dinner!"}
{"text":"Acceptable Indian food and the service was ok but the look and feel inside was a bit dark and dated..."}
{"text":"Having had a bad experience at my last lunchtme buffet visit i thought to try again

My wife was anxious to have indian for dinner and we decided to try them at dinner time due to the warm ambiance of their place and it being less noisy than some other places we go to

Well I must say its quite a different experience in the evening. Warm and attentive service and the place was busy with Indian families and several birthday parties.

With focus on seafood based dishes and the mandatory Burtha I can say the food was very very good and the dinner service excellent.

They rock out the naan and pickles like everyone else but being a fussy seafood eater I enjoyed the dishes. It takes extra effort to rock out a fish dish and with extra effort in quality makes for a tasty meal.

I mentioned to the server that i was disappointed with the lunch buffet and the owner came by and assured me that they had some changes in the kitchen staff and with menu selection changes for the lunch buffet that i can be assured of a good meal at lunch.

Pricing is the norm with generous portions"}
{"text":"Delicious! I've ordered delivery from the Host through OrderIt.ca, and I've dined in, and each time the food has been great. The quality of ingredients can't be beat. From the creamy-delicious Butter Chicken to the pea-tastic Mattar Paneer, everything is fresh and cooked with care. The prices are rather steep, but typical of the neighborhood. This isn't your typical weeknight Indian dinner nosh; the Host takes the fancy up a notch with nice linens, dim lighting and a romantic atmosphere in which you can make goo-goo eyes at your date from across the table. 

It's nan-tastic!"}
{"text":"Best. Fish. Pakora. ever.

The waiters were very quick, efficient and prompt.  Even the manager/owner (?) came over a couple times to ask how the food was, etc.

Had the yellow daal the first time with garlic naan.  Oh the garlic naan.  FRESH pieces of roasted garlic drenched in butter and some sprinkles of parsley for color.  THIS IS WHAT I'M TALKIN ABOUT, PEOPLE.

2nd time in 5 days and we had the butter chicken, fish pakora and aloo gobhi (that's potato and cauliflower).

Everything was amazing.  Only complaint is the chicken was in bigger than normal pieces.  Maybe that's how they do out in Ontario, who knows.  

The fish pakora had a light batter to it.  The fish was flaky, tender and not at all oily.  Would totally order again. and again. and maybe once more just to be sure.

I've eaten at many places in Toronto and Richmond Hill, and nothing is absolutely memorable.  This place, however, was impressive."}
{"text":"One dish had hair in it, which our server initially tried to convince us was a piece of ginger, so we held up the long piece of hair for his closer inspection. He agreed it was hair and brought us a replacement dish. The butter chicken contained pieces of chicken that were so over cooked and dry, it inedible, so we left that dish. They did nothing in the way of offering us complimentary dessert or not charging us for the dish with the hair. Will not be back."}
{"text":"RUDE SERVICE

We were visiting Toronto from Texas and were recommended this place for  a good Indian buffet. Its located in a business center I think. We got there around noon and were haphazardly seated. No one came to take our drink orders, and when the waiter arrived he didn't make eye contact with any of us. I asked him if he had a drink menu and he rudely/quickly stated all the drinks they had. Didn't even mention any beers or wines...it was like pulling teeth with this guy.

Food was pretty good! I really liked the tandoori chicken. The naan was pretty fresh too. Overall liked the food.

When we asked for our check the waiter threw the thing on our table. What the hell is that? Then their credit card machine wasn't working properly so my dad was trying to ask him a question...and again this guy wasn't looking at him and just staring off at something else. It took trying to get his attention a few times before he realized we were trying to speak to him. Absolutely ridiculous.

Never coming back again. If I am going to pay good money to eat at your restaurant, you better atleast pretend like you like your job and provide decent service."}
{"text":"The Host is a good option for those looking for an Indian buffet in a more relaxed setting; with larger seating and good service, similar to what you expect in a larger buffet hall.

I came here with a very large group and we were taken care of quite well, with good service. The food was standard Indian fare but quite passable for a buffet. 

My favourites included the naan with their butter chicken and the goat masala curry. The goat was served bone-on but that made it all the better, as it was super tender and succulent. Another favourite of mine was the chaat, it was a great combination of flavors of textures. The crispy wafers with some potatoes and chickpeas all smothered in a creamy yoghurt and sweet tamarind sauce is just delectable.

Otherwise, all the other items were quite average and I just stuck with my favourites. I wouldn't say there was too much selection for a lunch buffet. I also had the mango Lassi here and enjoyed that as well. I found it quite amusing they served these in a country style mason jars!"}
{"text":"THE best Indian restaurant. I've been going there for over 13 years and have since moved away but always stop in for dinner when in Toronto. The paneer tikka, murgh lababdar (like butter chicken but less creamy and superior!!!) are amazing. Order it with garlic nan and Bon appétit! So good I don't share!"}
{"text":"I have to say this has to be one of the best Indian Restaurants I have been too in a long time. The food is authentic and full of flavour and the dishes are great for sharing, so going in a group is recommended. We went on a Saturday (four of us) and the place was packed, lucky to get a table actually, so I would suggest making reservations before you head out."}
{"text":"Four of us trekked to the Host drawn by its reputation. It has been around for a long time and has a following. We went there for a leisurely dinner, and it turned out to be so-so. It may have been a bad night.

We all love a large variety of Indian food (the wife does not like goat), and the 2 other dinners were extremely familiar with Indian offerings. They had been vegetarians in years past for many years.

The setting is dated, but aspires to be elegant. I guess it could be a 'date' restaurant and features nicely set tables, and a dated early 90's decor. 

The service was at best laconic. There was no sense that the wait staff were at all interested in us as customers. They were just going through the motions. When we asked a few questions about preparation, they were just a bit too snooty.

The nan which is continuously prepared was very good and hot. I found the mango pickles to taste 'metallic', probably the canned not bottled version. I am always looking for Jeera Paani, a refreshing spice water, but they only have the ubiquitous Lassis.

I will endorse the Butter Chicken here, but its not the absolute best I have tasted. The Vindaloo was extremely so-so, not all that spicy, although we had requested that. The other dishes we consumed more properly belong on a lunch Buffet than on a nice dinner menu. On the meat side the Mhurg almost seemed to have been made from frozen meat.

This restaurant, by all accounts, is reputed to produce superior Indian food. It has grown to 3 locations based on its quality. Could we have come on a weekend evening, when something was out of the ordinary? This is the only review so far, where I have made that argument, and given them 3 Stars on the basis of such speculation.

We all concluded that, in view of the brisk prices, that this would be the ideal place to come back for the lunch buffet. I will try this place again, just maybe they were having an 'off' night."}
{"text":"Host is a good indian restaurant.  The lunch buffet has more variety than most Indian buffets in the US.  The food was fresh and well seasoned and the wait staff was very accommoding and friendly.   The 13.99 price was a little pricey compared to what I am used to paying but there was  more to sample.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant.

Went to the Host again and it was simply superb."}
{"text":"Decent Indian buffet. Not too many choices but what they had was good. The cauliflower pakora is a must have and the goat curry was delicious, the goat was so tender and the curry was very flavourful. They had my favourite dessert, it was like a rice pudding, and they made perfectly! The only down side was that it was pretty hard to find the restaurant as it's in the corner of the mall and the naan was pretty tough to chew, probably because they leave a stack of them in the warmer. In other indian buffets they make the naan to order. Probably wouldn't return, unless I was around the area, as I've been to other indian buffets with more of a selection at the same price"}
{"text":"Amazing service and delicious food! Quite happy with out host, Sushant who served fine litchi Martinis this sunny afternoon. We will surely be back again"}
{"text":"This would have to qualify as a \"fine dining\" establishment in my books.  I have had Indian food all over town, but this is definitely a more plush, upscale environment with great ambiance.  

Aside from many varied dishes on the menu, there is also a \"make it yourself\" option.  I chose a Shrimp Korma, served with a fresh out-of-the-oven Naan.  The shrimp were large, plump and perfectly cooked, as well as a good portion.  The sauce was a perfect consistency.

I also had a taste of my dinner guest's lamb--incredibly tender and great flavour.

I can tell this place is likely very busy most of the time.  We were lucky at that time on a Saturday evening that the major rush was over.  Parking can be a hassle, unless you are lucky enough to scoop a spot on the street.  You will likely be working up an appetite walking from the closest public lot on the next block.  But working up an appetite is a good thing!"}
{"text":"We had a wonderful meal here last night. I was looking for a place close to Hart House that we hadn't tried before and as this was highly rated on Yelp, we decided to give it a try.  The service as others have mentioned was truly outstanding. Extremely prompt and polite wait staff make you feel you can immediately relax knowing these guys are not going to screw up your order.  I had a nice glass if German riesling with my shrimp biryani which was the perfect, slightly sweet and cool accompaniment to balance the hot, spicy rice dish. My partner had tandoori chicken and he loved it. We enjoyed some garlic naan beforehand and had a side dish of raita with our main course.  The menu was quite large and the next time I'm there I plan to try the \"build your own curry dish\" and try the vindaloo curry with fish and vegetables."}
{"text":"Came here Satruday night with the lovely friend, as we had a craving for India food in the Markham-Richmond Hill area.  I have had THE HOST catered numerous times, so it was necessary to experience their fine dining.  Though finding the restaurant can be a nuisance, it sits in a small boutique mall that seems abandoned once the weekend hits.
The ambiance is warm, clean, and dim  4/5
Their service was excellent about a 5!
The food, we had their Chicken 65! infamous chicken lollipops in a sweet, but lightly spiced herbs which was a 4/5
Butter chicken: was creamy, rich, and lean chunks of lean marinated chicken 5/5
Mutton/Goat curry: rich in flavors, and good portion, however was a bit too spicy for me 4/5
Overall the experience was great!! ill be back, or ill just cater...lol...."}
{"text":"I've had a LOT of Indian all across the GTA and went to The Host on a very high recommendation from a co-worker. I have to say that while it was good, very good actually, it didn't quite meet my expectations. It was really not that far apart from anywhere else I've had and given the modest hype, I kind of expected it would have somehow stood apart."}
{"text":"I've been avoiding this review for a very long time. The owners of The Host are friends of the family*, and for that it's assumed that I must be slightly biased, but if I weren't a fan I would not review the place with flying colours**. If you enjoy Indian food, or consider yourself a connoisseur, this should be on your go to list for the best meal.

I've been frequenting this restaurant back when they where located at Bay and Charles St almost 15 years ago. Since then, the owners moved to Prince Arthur and expanded to include two other locations. The chefs (one of which is the owner), change rarely, and are professionally trained with experience in renowned restaurants from India. The best part about this comes with the consistency of all dishes. It's become very easy to figure out when a dish is catered by The Host, and presentation is almost always the same. 

The dishes are always on the rich, creamy and mildly spicy side. I would avoid this place if you're on a diet, as you'll go home depressed. 

My favourite dishes are: 
Tava Tandoori Murg: Sizzling, tandoori grilled chicken marinated in yogurt and spices. 
Tava Paneer: Sizzling, tandoori grilled spiced paneer (cheese curd).
Tak Tak Jhinga: Tandoor baked prawns, lightly spiced, but hella tender and juicy. 
Dum Murg: I prefer this better than butter chicken, as it comes in an almond based cream instead of a tomato based cream. The chicken is always tender and juicy. 
Patiala Baigan: Charbroiled Eggplant cooked with chopped onions, fennel and spices. This one is never cream based.
Kofta Dilkush: I see this one as their richest dish yet, with dumplings made of nuts and cheese in a thick, heart attack inducingly delicious cashew sauce. 

Order your meal with tandoori naan or roti and a side of raita***, and you'll be in postprandial hyperglycemic bliss.
A meal for two will run you about $60 before tip. 

------------------------------------
*No. There's no Corleone complex here.
** If you've ever been here you'd know they really don't need the buzz. 
***Raita is pretty much like a spiced, greek yogurt. The naan, raita accompaniments in authentic Indian meals are as ubiquitous as rice is to sushi."}
{"text":"Pricy but good. I returned to Host in Yorkville after almost 8 years and I was pleasantly surprised. The place is quite fancy, the service is good, the food is to die for. I have tried Indian restaurants all over the world and The Host is definitely a recommended one. I would like to go there on a Friday for their lunch buffet so I can try more dishes. I have only tried a couple, but I was not disappointed. 
The place is in Yorkville so it is not cheap, you have to order the rice and naan separately, but it is a nice spot for a quiet dinner and a glass of wine."}
{"text":"I made the mistake of walking in on a Tuesday for the buffet... 
It's ONLY FRIDAYS.
I was impressed with the interior, did not realize it was this big a space (looks small from outside), plus it's much nicer than most Indian places I've visited (cleaner, fancier).
The food was very good, I would suggest another 'hot' item for variety, the price is $17 (I felt a few dollars too many), but also I'm sure for many who visit a very good deal (higher income folk!).  Main concern, it was a nice sunny day and the back room next to the buffet was TOO DARK, hard to see, stick a few bulbs in the ceiling.?  Would recommend for the food; most important!"}
{"text":"So, I decided to try The Host for the first time in years because I had an entertainment book 2-4-1 coupon.  When I showed them the coupon, the waiter came back and said, this is how it works, buy 2 get 1 free, how did I know they would bait and switch me? Because I've dealt with Indians before, I'm Indian.  And have always had problems with coupons with Indians.  Pathetic.  We were buying three entrees anyways, but to switch the deal like that is pathetic.  Food was good, but even with the buy \"2\" get one free, it was still $80 for three people.  Shrimpy curry $22 bucks?
Come on.  No tip for you!  Better off going to any buffet, literally ANY Indian buffet, at least you'll be full.  Only Indian people put out coupons and DON'T want you to use them or ignorantly change rules to leave a bad taste in your mouth.  Simply pathetic.  Nice place and food still if it wasn't for the brownies."}
{"text":"Great location just around the corner from our hotel. Food and service both very good, though including rice with our entree would've been nice."}
{"text":"Hm, alright, I'm not quite sure how I should rate this place because I'm definitely not an expert on Indian cuisine but I'll rate it based on how I enjoyed my experience. 

This is my second time coming here. Both times were for weekend lunch buffet. I'm not a huge fan of Indian cuisine but some of the typical food items I'd get are the soup, butter rice, naan bread, butter chicken, goat curry, potatoes, salad, tandoori chicken, and some other dishes at the station where someone helps make it in front of you (not really sure what it's called). I also quite enjoyed the desserts here! 

The service is great. The servers are always attentive to your needs and there's a guy at the station where they make your food (mentioned above) who's always willing to help you and recommending ways of eating or how to eat it best and I thought that was quite nice of him. 

Price point is about $18 for weekend lunch...it's not too bad but I don't think I got my money's worth out of it considering I didn't try all the food that they had."}
{"text":"Came here for some late night Indian food.

We got the chicken trio, the Malai Kofta, rice, naan, and gulab jaamin. The food is 3 stars. The service is slow though and given the price I would average the place at 2 stars.

The experience was overall disappointing."}
{"text":"The good:

1) tons of selection at the buffet
2) there is naan at the actual buffet so you don't have to wait for your waiter to bring some to your table
3) the place is decorated quite nicely; nothing too fancy but nothing too ugly either
4) central location; very close to square one and the central core of Mississauga
5) the food was really yummy (esp. the butter chicken!)

The bad:

1) it's a little bit more pricier than others because it is such a central location"}
{"text":"My first visit, an easy saunter over from the Sheraton Hotel.
Greeted by a very friendly Indian gentleman and seated right away.

I see several groups of dark Indians all ready enjoying a meal- usually a very good sign.

Seems like a very quiet and peacefully elegant decor with some sutle indian music playing in the background.

Wonderful Indian aromas wafting about to wet your appetite makes the anticipation very good.

So I see in the menu that they won the best Butter Chicken award from the Toronto Star. Ok sold!

If you know me, you know that I am a sucker for butter chicken.

It only comes with the chicken. So you have to add the Rice and the Naan separately. Ok so no biggy,  but it's nice when it's a package deal.

So the chef comes out and brings me a nice hot clean plate before the meal arrives. Gee, that's a nice touch!

So here comes the butter chicken, I love the goofy bowl the rice is in, makes it very easy to hold while spooning out the rice. I might have to buy one of those myself! 

So... the meal... well... I can honestly say that my reviews for the top 3 Butter chickens in Canada has not been shaken.

My appologies to the Toronto Star, but if this won the best in Toronto I feel sorry for you all.

The chicken itself was stale and dry tasting, the sauce, although well spiced  was watery but edible.

The Naan was decent but a bit too loaded with butter and garlic to the point most of it was soggy. The rice although served in a cute little bowl was about as plain a basmati as you can get.

All in all its not the worst butter chicken I have ever had, it's certainly not in the top 10.

You won't find this bad, and I'd say you would probably find it decent, but I think if you have never had really good butter chicken you'd probably find it will satisfy you craving.

My problem is that I am spoiled and have tasted some amazing meals.

So I hope your meal wows you.

Another nice touch is the hot wet nap they bring you after your meal.

So all in all not a bad place by any stretch of the imagination."}
{"text":"We're giving it a 5 stars, mostly for it service, and 4 stars for the food. 

For the appetizer, we shared the Bhel Puri, which was a very solid choice considering how yummy it is (Let's just say we cleaned the bowl alright)! For the mains, we had the Chicken Lababdar (not Labrador, according to their menu!), Saffron Rice and Garlic Naan - all of which were very tasty! We also had the Butter chicken, which we thought was just okay. 

We thought that the service at this restaurant was very amazing. When we arrived, the patio was very full so we decided to stay inside. However, it was very cold and as soon as there was an opening, I asked to change our seat to the patio. Our sever was very accommodating and helpful. I love that there was 1 server dedicated to the patio, even when its almost empty! When it came to packing up our leftovers, the server told us he added more rice, because we only had a bit left. How amazing was that gesture? We think because of that, they certainly deserve 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Love this place! No wonder it's been here so long. Good portions, great service, location and ambiance. The food is great. The tandoori chicken murgh was great and served on a bed of vegetables with which it was cooked on a sizzling hot iron. The garlic naan is delicious. They have salty lassi which I love, don't like the sweet mango version which is often the only choice some places. The shrimp biryani was also great."}
{"text":"Been there several times and the food has always been great. I loved the experience every single time. I like all of the buffet choices. I went for dinner a la carte once and remembered the butter chicken being much better (the buffet butter chicken was still great)! Nice decor and seating area as well. Always look forward to my trips here."}
{"text":"I was at the ROM & craving something different that I can sit to enjoy instead of the typical fast food.
It was a short walk over & I was the first one sat for dinner which proved positive because people were already either calling in reservations or snagging tables within the first 15 minutes I was there.
I ordered this deliciously flavorful chicken appetizer, the saffron rice, & the lamb entree. Everything was absolutely loved. If I had more time to stay on my travels, I would added dessert too!
The servers were amazingly attentive. Even as it started getting busy, my water glass was always full & they checked on me appropriately but not pushy. 

The only reason this place doesn't get 5 stars is I'm still thrown off when places outside of America have you pay for the rice separately. Used to having it included with the dish without question so this extra charge will always bug me.

Next time I'm in Toronto craving Indian food then you know I'll be going to this place."}
{"text":"by far the best Indian food in Markham/Richmond hill"}
{"text":"Quiet and intimate setting.  I ordered the chicken tandoori sampler with naan and it was enough to satisfy me.  Lovely rice pudding with chai tea to finish.  A great dining experience."}
{"text":"Food was very good. Tasty without being too spicy.  Their menu was even able to accommodate our toddler. 
Naan is very large, able to be shared between the two of us."}
{"text":"Its in the street level of a building across from Square One. We came around 7 PM on a Friday night and parked for free at the building lot which was open.

Very nice vibe, dimly lit with a calming ambience. They have a buffet area that's used for lunch and big parties. The food is fresh and made to order.

My wife and I had the Aloo Parantha roti breads and the Kashmiri Dum Aloo which was out of this world.

My rating would have been higher if not for the fact that the server was also the hostess and we waited very long for everything."}
{"text":"Very disappointed by this place. Despite the food being quite good, the service was absolutely terrible. Our appetizer plates were empty for literally 20 minutes before someone came to clear them, and she didn't even ask if we were ready to order our mains, which we were. She just left, and no one came back until we had to flag someone down, a few times... we were not once asked how the food was, or if we needed anything else... They were clearly understaffed, and we did not feel like we were taken care of at all. Unfortunately, it was so bad that I wouldn't go back or recommend anyone to go there. We were there for over 2 hours by the time everything was said and done... awful for such a seemingly high class restaurant."}
{"text":"***3.5 stars ***

We had buffet lunch here at The Host.  I had lived in the area for years but this is the first time I tried it.  I thought the selection was nice, though not as big as Chinese buffets (it is also less expensive in comparison).  I really enjoyed the tandoori chicken drum sticks and fish curry, but did not eat the naan as it was burnt on one side.  The temperature of the food was good and was well presented.

Overall a wonderful Indian buffet.  Service was friendly, nice seating area, clean washrooms.  Will visit again!"}
{"text":"Food is standard India cuisine, their butter chicken and vindaloo chicken was delicious, but I wouldn't say it's my top choice for India food. 

I didn't like their lunch buffet that much, other than chicken, both beef and lamb were extremely dry. It's perfect for people who aren't familiar with Indian food and would like to try different dishes tho."}
{"text":"We did take away order. Tandoori chicken, chicken tikka masala, Veg biryani and butter - naan. 
Butter naan is not at all good, might be its because of take away order. Overall the taste is OK."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner recently while in the area for business.  I was a bit skeptical given the wide range of reviews.  I was very impressed, I didn't try the buffet (I would never try the buffet) but went with the dinner menu, the server was very helpful with sorting out the choices.  The appetizer platter for two was great - spice level was higher than usually seen in Canada (equivalent to a medium in a US Tex-Mex restaurant) and the flavors were great.  Over the service was excellent and the meal was very good.  I will definitely go back.  

The only negative is that the wine list is very limited and overpriced.  The one unusual wine on the list (a Portuguese Green wine) had been 86ed.  

Don't let the negative reviews scare you off from trying this place for dinner, it will be unusual and the food will amaze you."}
{"text":"Hit and miss with this place. 

We got a chicken tikka masala, aloo gobi, and garlic naans. The ticken tikka and aloo gobi were quite good and the portion sizes were impressive. On the other hand the garlic naan and the papadum was hugely dissapointing....

The complimentary papadum was SOGGY, like the texture of chips left out with the bag open during humid summee rain. The garlic naan had barely any garlic taste to it and it was very thin. 

The service was very nice and the ambiance is great. The interior is pretty fancy and is comfortable to sit and have a nice dinner. They also serve a buffett lunch."}
{"text":"Not a date worthy place. The onion kulcha I ordered did remind me of better memories but the rest of the two course meal, the presentation, the service, the flavor were all lacking. I am sure to not take any guests with me to this place."}
{"text":"The decor and service is amazing in this place! Dishes I would recommend trying your first time there would be the butter chicken, garlic naan, and tandoori chicken. The food is always fresh and delicious! It is a little over priced but hey you get what you pay for right. A great first date place too because of its lovely ambiance!"}
{"text":"I was at Host last month for lunch on the recommendation of a cab driver.  I cannot believe I am rating the buffet four stars, but it deserves it.

Everything was good.  The vegetarian dishes were very good.

Just make sure you ask for naan because it is not in the buffet line or advertised."}
{"text":"I've had lunch here a few times with coworkers since it's so close to my work. The lunch buffet is $14.99 which is a pretty good deal since a regular plate off the menu is about the same price. The servers are polite and seat us right away. 

Food:
The buffet has a LOT of selection. There's plenty of options for vegetarians and meat lovers alike. We usually go around 12 and the food is pretty fresh since they open at 11:30 so nothing's been sitting out for too long. I like the tandoori chicken and goat curry the most. They also have yummy apps selections that are vegetarian like veggie pakoras, samosas, etc. The food options also change frequently because the dishes weren't exactly the same every time we went. I always leave full and satisfied. Not bad at all for buffet!"}
{"text":"When we lived in Yorkville, The Host was our go-to place for comfort good. All we ever ordered was Butter Chicken (Murgh Makhni) and nan but we just couldn't bring ourselves to be adventurous because it was tough to imagine that anything else on the menu could taste better than their Butter Chicken. It had just the perfect portion that leaves you satisfied but not stuffed. The combination of creamy tomato sauce and nan always managed to make my day. The only minus is the long wait time. It probably doesn't help that we always come when we're already starving. 

The environment is very modern yet exotic. I love the little touches of nature that are added to freshen up the place, it really brings upon a feeling of tranquility. The wait staff are professional and courteous. I only have good memories from The Host."}
{"text":"We (group of 4) visited the Host on  a saturday evening. We showed up without any reservations, so we understood having to wait for 10 minutes.
For beer, i would recomment cheetah on tap. For entree we ordered the lamb biriyani, lamb shank in gravy (Nali ghosth), dum murgh (chicken in a rich sweet gravy) and Dal makhni (lentil preparation) and of course Nans for the table.
What I liked:
The food was really good. The lamb dishes were really tender and well seasoned, which is rare to find in most restaurants. What impressed me about the menu was the unique choices they had compared to most other indian restaurants. The biriyani was excellent, probably in the  top 5 for indian style biriyanis from among the restaurants i have been to. 
What I didnt like:
The service was just horrible after they brought the entress. No refills on water, until we flagged down a waitress. I wanted more beer but was done with dinner by the time they came around again. And to top it all the waitress started clearing the table before we were done, until stopped by us. I have eaten at their yorkville location, which has much better service."}
{"text":"The lunch buffet is awesome! Very reasonable price"}
{"text":"Very classy and quiet ambience. Very nice for dates! The service was very good and food portions are also healthy. It looks little but it's filling! Prices are on the higher bit for Indian food but totally worth it. 
Ordered:
Butter chicken
Spinach and mushroom masala 
Naan bread 
The food was seasoned very well and accurately. The texture was perfect for eating along with the naan. The chicken was tender and juicy even though it was white meat. One of the best butter chicken I've had in toronto so far. Due to the texture of the food, appearance isn't the best or most appealing but Definitely eating there again if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Great value for the money and I like this location because it is nice and bright.  Kulbir (not sure if he is the owner) asked us to wait to be seated and kept letting us know how long it would be. I love the snacks that are part of the buffet - puchkas, papri chaat, etc.  Good selection at the buffet and I honestly enjoyed the chow mein and chili chicken (LoL).
The sweets are OK.  Looking forward to our next visit (this Friday)."}
{"text":"I've never been to the Host before in Toronto.  I went to their Markham location once many years ago.  I was working in the neighbourhood and looking for a new restaurant (new to me) to try out.

I was very impressed with the layout of the restaurant, the tables, and the dishes.  It was a very welcoming presentation.

The music was at a nice level, and the mood in the restaurant was calm.

I mentioned to the waiter that I must keep a gluten free diet, and he was very helpful in getting me food that I could eat.

I ordered the Chicken Lababdar, and the Okra.

The Chicken Lababdar was good, and the okra was slightly firm and cooked with onions and mango powder.  I also got to try the eggplant, and it was also cooked perfectly and was a very nice dish.

The place was clean and the waiter was very good as well too.

I was very impressed with the menu.  There were several options that were old favourites that I hadn't seen in many years, as well as the usual old reliable such as the butter chicken, and biryianis.

I highly recommend this location.  I will go again."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to \"The Host\" Mississauga location.

This is the third location that I have visited over many years.

The Host is a good sized restaurant.  Lots of seating, looks to be a mature restaurant that has been in business for a good many years.

It was nice to be served by waiters that know the food well, and are confident in making suggestions.

They had a large buffet, but as I need to eat gluten free, I skipped the buffet and ordered directly off of the menu.  I had the Lamb Roganjosh and the Navrattan Korma.

The lamb was quite good, but I found some pieces were tough and some pieces were quite tender.  Overall it was okay but an odd dichotomy.  I had to pull a few hard pieces out of my mouth as I could not chew them.

The Navrattan Korma was excellent.  I was amazed about how well they treated the cauliflower in this dish.  I do not often enjoy cauliflower in restaurants because it is frequently overcooked or too hard.  The cauliflower in this dish was very good, and I will go back at some point specifically to try this dish and other dishes with cauliflower in them.

The service was okay, but I had to ask twice for my bill, and it was not that busy, and past the lunchtime rush.

The place was very clean, and the decor was quite nice."}
{"text":"well, first rule of thumb on getting to an authentic restaurant, such as Indian or any other ethnic food. make sure inside plenty of the local ethnic people
this one wasn't one of them.
so you've got the feeling that this might not be the right restaurant to go to.

unfortunate for the indian restaurant, most of them are Buffet style.
for them to cut cost, they need to cut on the amount of spices they use in the food. so the taste can or could be very bland.

enough summary on that.
went there for lunch, and the food was .. not what I'm expecting (rule of thumb, only 1% of the customer were indian, so that tells you something already)
but, because I also go there with my other indian friend. we are giving this place a shot.
wouldn't go back.."}
{"text":"A good Indian restaurant with fine dining ambience and well presented food. Time taken to serve food is very high. It's better to order all the course at once to avoid long pauses between appetizers and main course. Hospitality can be improved."}
{"text":"Great food with good service, I've attending many family dinners in the private party room, and the food has always been amazing.  Especially the Lamb chops! the are absolutely phenomenal."}
{"text":"I've visited this restaurant multiple times for dinner but never lunch. Once I came with a coupon deal so I tried many items I would've normally not get. All in all this is a good Indian restaurant. I wouldn't say it's my favorite but for decent food and good service, I would definitely come here.

My favorite thing here is their butter chicken and naan. I've tried their different flavor naan but my favorite is still the original plain one. Their samosas were good but a tad spicy. My friend who can't take any heat at all didn't dare take a second nibble out of her samosa and we had to wave the waiter down for more water.

If you've never had Indian food before and you're looking for a good Indian restaurant, I highly recommend this restaurant. I would opt for their lunch buffet so you can try all sorts of different Indian dishes as oppose to the 2-3 entrees you would probably order for dinner."}
{"text":"This restaurant is excellent value for money the food is not very oily nor very greasy and we were very pleasantly surprised the tandoori chicken is excellent and I must try the waitstaff is prompt we were definitely come back again or visit the downtown location"}
{"text":"Stopped by here for the lunch buffet and was very disappointed. I had above average expectation for this place considering that it is located in a hotel. (I forgot the name of the hotel, but hotel restaurants are usually decent.)

We were quickly seated by the host. Service was respectable, our water was constantly filled. 

However I was very disappointed by the variety and presentation of the food. Yes, I know it is a buffet, but come on. Given your prime location and the number of customers in suits, I expected more. 

I wish I remembered specifically what was on the menu, but all I remember is that the meat was dry, the spicy was not spicy. Vegetarian selection was decent, but limited."}
{"text":"The Food was excellent.It was authentic .The Staff was nice and Friendly. Loved everything about the place . The only fault I was they did go around to serve the person in the other end .They just gave the plate from the end they were .Even the when they pored water since I was at the other side they asked me for my glass and handed it back , Rather than coming around and pouring it . It was the only fault I so."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, the Host has bumped up the price for the lunch buffet and are charging $12 for food that's dropped in quality.  The servers here don't seem to be concerned with addressing your needs.  The only time someone showed interest in us was when we started to leave and a waiter asked if he had paid the bill yet.

I was pretty disappointed when I came back here in August to find that a lot of the food was lukewarm and some of the dishes that were set out weren't perfectly clean. The saag paneer, channa masala and aloo gobi were decent, but it's just not what it used to be.

Looking around the crowd, it seems that most of the people here are just regulars."}
{"text":"This has been one of my favourite Indian restaurants for long long time. I have been coming years almost 10 years ago, then somehow forgot about it and now I'm back. The food here is really good. All the dishes I have tried are absolutely flavourful and good. I highly recommend this restaurant if you like Indian food. The dishes are not too spicy, not oily, and the staff is very friendly and nice. My favourite dishes here have always been Butter Chicken, Saag Paneer and Navratan Korma."}
{"text":"Authentic Indian food ... just love it ... chicken kadai and dal fry are my favorite...we even tried Bombay bhel and Punjabi samosa in starters they are good too ... also papad are provided complimentary... ambience is very nice .. staff is polite and co operative."}
{"text":"I liked the service more than the food.
We were there for lunch and they had a buffet available. Everyone knows that buffets are not synonymous with quality food, which is fine, but it was more a case of limited options.
There was a limited salad bar, a lentil soup, one rice pot, one type of bread and several desserts. On the dessert side they had a friendly lady make some kind of Indian street food. That was a treat. She was friendly, volunteered information and what she made was good too.
Back to the main dishes there was chicken tikka, two kinds of meat dishes (Butter Chicken and Goat Meat) and then there was a vegetarian station. I think for a buffet they should have more than the two meat stew options. Perhaps another chicken dish? How about a fish dish or lamb dish? Perhaps a shrimp dish? With that said, we were completely full of course.
The other issue with having limited options is that a queue develops and it becomes crowded since everyone aims for and huddles around the same items.
Price-wise it is slightly high, but not by much.

I do appreciate The Host's decoration and attempt at an Indian ambiance.
I also appreciate the staff who were polite and seemed genuine. They cared it seemed, delivered on our requests (water, lassi, ice, refill, napkins, etc.) and were verbally polite."}
{"text":"Their food is fine. I was expecting more considering the high review. The only difference between this restaurant and the other Indian restaurants is that their kitchen is clean."}
{"text":"I went for the lunch buffet and was quite disappointed at the lack of vegetarian options. It's 100% worth it if you can feast on their meat options but if you can't I would skip the lunch buffet and go in for a dinner instead.

The restaurant is huge and kinda looks like a fancy house which I loved! The service was quick and pleasant. 

From the vegetarian options the food was all standard fare Indian food. They keep the fresh naans coming and the food isn't oily which are all great. 

It's a good spot if you're downtown and craving Indian food!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars

Goat curry was great. Eggplant curry less so, being as it was a little sweet for my liking. Chicken 65 was good. Service was slightly inattentive. It took a while for us to pay. But I'd come back, especially to get that goat curry. Yum.

Slightly upscale inside. Washrooms are down stairs. They fit us in on a Saturday night, even though we had no reservations. The place was pretty busy inside."}
{"text":"Purely based on service.. We were rushed into ordering, in others finishing our dinner quickly and get out.. Waiters were arrogant.. They question you for not tipping on horrible service.. If you serve right is when you tip.. Isn't that normal? Is it not a customers right to tip.. Food was average.. Quality seems to be dropping over time.. Looks like the kitchen has changed hands too.. Not the one I've been going to anymore.. Check the new place Bombay BBQ around the corner.. They're better on food, price and service.. Wish I could rate you no stars.. Don't deserve one either.."}
{"text":"Amazing customer service! The internet was down and the waiter let me link to the data on his phone because the international data on my plan was not functioning. 

I asked if they had a Pinot open, I would love a glass, even though it was not on the menu by the glass. They. Brought it to me by the glass & opened the bottle just for me.  

The food was delightful, fresh and full of delicate spices. 

A definite gem!"}
{"text":"Not cheap by any means (I racked up $38 by myself with no alcohol), but definitely delicious.  Much better than Indian food I've had at similar places (in terms of service and dining experience).  Everything is a la carte which is different from most places that offer rice or nan with the entrees...and I got both.  And the mango lassi was also excellent with the lamb curry.  I plan to go back, probably hit their lunch buffet too.  Great place but a little overpriced even for its quality, the service was friendly but leaved something to be desired, and the layout is a bit weird.  Overall I strongly recommend it for Indian food in the area."}
{"text":"Best Indian I've had so far and I've tried a lot. This place is a bit more upscale than most Indian restaurants in the city and I might even venture to say its the most upscale one in Toronto.

I went with 3 friends and we shared a few dishes. The okra dish was amazing and the butter chicken (I didn't have it) was apparently the best ever, according to my friends. However everything we tried was great.

The staff were friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Had dinner here on Saturday night with the family. We had made reservations so we were seated right away. About 10 minutes after we were seated our waiter came for our appetizer orders. We ordered the paneer tikka, a pakora platter, the bhalla chaat papri, and chicken 65. I tried everything except for the pakora platter. Everyone at the table loved the paneer tikka platter so much that we ordered another platter of this stuff! The chaat papri was nice and flavorful as well. I loved the fact that the wafers were nice and crispy and not soggy like I have had at some places in the past. I found the chicken 65 to be a bit too spicy for me. But with that being said, my husband really liked it. 

On to the main course. I couldn't decide between the shrimp biryani and the butter chicken. So, we decided to order both since we are a large group of people and were sure that someone will finish it. The shrimp biryani isn't anything to write home about. It was okay. The butter chicken was a clear winner. The chicken pieces were well done and the gravy had all the right flavors. It was rich and creamy and prefect for dipping nan. We ordered a bunch of other curries with nan like okra, lentil etc. I was so satisfied with the butter chicken that I didn't want to try anything else! 

We had mango kulfi for desert. It was rich creamy and velvety smooth. This was probably the highlight of the meal hands down. 

Overall, the restaurant had a nice ambiance and friendly service. everyone was satisfied with the meal. We would definitely return."}
{"text":"I am gonna give it a 3.5, and the fan boys/girls are gonna hate on me!

It's in a nice part of town and has a nice, refined ambiance (veering a bit into fuddy-duddy territory). 

The menu is extensive, and the food is good and not crazy greasy Indian style. However, the flavors were as expected, nothing surprisingly good. The calamari appetizer stands out though.

The service was good. Overall no complaints. One of the main reasons I gave it a 3.5 is to convey that it's a bit lower on the deliciousness totem pole compared to India Rice Factory. That's all."}
{"text":"We ordered the butter chicken and goat meat dishes along with 2 orders of Naan. 

Our meal started off with a savory crispy chip (papadums) which I wish had come with a chutney or sauce as they leave a very strong aftertaste, nevertheless they were tasty.

The main dishes arrived and overall were really tasty and we even managed to have some leftovers - my boyfriend and I are big eaters so this was impressive! The dishes came with 1 order of steamed rice and the Naan were generous in size, fresh and delicious.

My three star rating comes down to a few things:
- I wish they would allow you to customize the heat of your meal. Indian food is known for its spicy and we weren't asked how spicy we enjoy our food, nor was either dish spicy.

- The Host is very pricy - indian food is generally not very pricy and thete is really nothing special about this restaurant that warrants this pricing.

- I'm not a coriander eater and found the goat meat to be more decorated with coriander than I care for.

- The goat meat was VERY boney...if you are charging as much as you are, can I at least have some meat?

Im someone who appreciates details and would suggest The Host offer something that adds that extra touch...cardomom tea...chai...a piece of barfi to complete your meal..some kind of complimentary starter or dessert, something inviting and warm that others are not doing."}
{"text":"Excellent overall experience. Quality of food is good. Variety is great. Assorted appetizer platter should be tried for first comers. 
Service can be a little on the down side if you are eating outside at the patio as I was today. But this was lunch time and there only seemed to be one person serving the guests. Likely to be a different case around dinner time. 
But certainly an excellent place, and great to talk since it does have a nice ambiance with a quiet atmosphere."}
{"text":"My son and I had a quick lunch at The Host 7/2, before the Blue Jays game. We're vegetarians, we were looking for a quick bite before the game, and, for a place designed for leisurely sit-down meals, The Host's staff was accommodating and gracious. The food was good, and I will be returning to The Host when I next visit Toronto."}
{"text":"As I sat there waiting for my food, I looked around the room and noticed that every table but mine had papadum. Papadum is a thin crispy bread often served as an appetizer or snack, very much like how Mexican restaurants serve nachos as a snack. As I waited for the waiter to bring me papadum to snack on, my appetizer arrived. After taking the first bite, my first thought was, \"ahh it's cold!\" I do not know why I expected the Chaat Papri to be hot, but that it was cold surprised me and made it less appealing to me. Considering all the ingredients that go into this dish, I found the tamarind chutney to overpower every other ingredient. I also felt that the wafer to sauce ratio was off and more than ever I wanted that papadum to break off and dip into the sauce. I could not wait any longer so I called the waiter over, and by that I mean I waved my arms in the air because not once did the staff make eye contact with me. Once the papadum arrived with a side of coriander chutney, the waiter promptly removed the chaat papri sauce that I had planned to eat with the papadum. I took a deep breath and tried not to get annoyed. I could have asked for it back, but I was becoming too frustrated with having to seek out their attention.

......Overall the meal was great.  I could have skipped the appetizer and dessert and still been more than happy with my meal. In fact, that is what I am going to do next time I visit, skip the appetizer and dessert. Yes, I will return to The Host because simply put, the naan and butter chicken were that good.  I will however come with friends. As annoying as it sounds, many restaurants give you much better treatment when you come with a party than on your own. It is ridiculous really and if the food had not been good, I would be telling everyone I know to stay away. But lucky for The Host, they got some things right."}
{"text":"This the the Host restaurant that your friends have been talking about. It is one of the better Indian restaurants in the GTA. It's in the category of one of the few indian restaurants that I will actually eat at and the only one in the Markham/Richmond Hill area at that. Their food is standard pretty good. I know I can expect decent food every time I visit. I typically do the buffet as with my most recent visit and it lived up to my expectations. As far as I know it is the best in the area, but saying that what a caveat that it is only *good* indian food. Don't expect awesome. Also, don't forget to have the Gulaab jaman!"}
{"text":"DELIVERY REVIEW: via UberEATS

Some wins and some misses here. Service aside (since I ordered delivery), I think there are tastier Indian places for better prices in downtown Toronto if you're going to be ordering in. The garlic naan here was amazing but I'll probably opt for some other places for my curry next time.

WINS:

Garlic Naan
- this was amazing; so soft and buttery with chopped garlic on top 

Samosas
- not too oily, great flavours

MISSES:

Bindaas Biryani Lamb 
- the rice was dry as was the lamb

Bengali Fish Curry
- the curry was good but the fish wasn't too flavourful

Safed Chawal (Rice)
- also pretty dry

Overall, my order including the 4.99 delivery fee came out to $65. I think this place is more expensive relative to other Indian places in Downtown Toronto due to its location in Yorkville. However, the food in my experience this time around didn't quite justify the higher price tag. Despite the amazing garlic naan, the rest just wasn't enough."}
{"text":"From the moment we walked in the door and were surrounded by the wonderful smell of curry spices, we knew we were in for a great dinner and we were right.

Even though a Winterlicious menu was offered, we decided to order from the regular menu so we could order dishes to share.

The pappadum that arrived right away were the perfect tease to wet our appetites.

For appetizers we got Pakora platter, Samosas and I picked Chicken 65.  All of them tasty but the Chicken 65 was the hands down winner, all 4 of us agreed next time we will just order a few of that for the appetizer, such depth of flavour and just darn tasty!

The dipping sauces for the appetizers were the best we had ever tasted.

For mains we ordered fish curry, butter chicken, goat curry and my personal favourite Lamb Roganjosh.  Each of us liked our personal pick the best but it was great being able to share the different dishes because it was all delicious.

The saffron rice and both plain and garlic naan were the perfect accompaniment to the flavourful main dishes.

Some of the heat and spice of the food built up over time so the Mango Lassi was the perfect cooling treat at the end of the meal.

From the moment we stepped in the door, to placing our orders and paying the bill, the service was above and beyond our expectations.  

Definitely our go to for Indian food from now on."}
{"text":"Came for the lunch buffet today but didn't like it at all. Food was ok but not much selection. I wouldn't come back for the lunch buffet."}
{"text":"This place had a good selection of Indian food: butter chicken, goat meat, chickpea with nacho stuff, tandoori chicken, spring rolls, samosas, naan and so on. It was my first time trying goat meat; it tasted like lamb but with a stronger smell. 

They also had a good selection of desserts: rice pudding, a donut-like thing that was too sweet to finish, white and cheese-like things and ice cream.
This place was decorated with bracelets on the ceiling. I would recommend their lunch buffet."}
{"text":"This was our 2nd visit but the last time was many years ago and it was the lunch buffet.  My sister-in-law recommended for us to try the dinner here so we finally made it back this evening for dinner.  We got there really early at around 6pm and we were the 1st table so it's was really quiet but people started coming and by 7pm, half the restaurant was full.  All our dishes came together and pretty quickly.  We asked for everything mild since my husband and daughter can not handle spicy food.  We ordered the butter chicken, tandoori chicken and eggplant with naan.  Everything was very tasty and for me the spiciness was perfect.  The service was really good ensuring the bottle of water was filled.  We also got the mango lassi drink which was perfectly done."}
{"text":"The current rating says it all. I've always maintained that Indian fine dining doesn't mean insipid food. Still, 3 stars for service and ambiance.

While their vegetarian food tastes quite fine, the chicken & lamb dishes leave a lot to be desired.

We particularly enjoy their creamy veg Kofta Dilbahar and veg platter. The non veg platter is pretty forgettable. Fish fry is a better option for appetizers.

Mostly I end up here when everywhere else is shut down or going to. The ambiance is spot on and drinks are made to perfection. And they are very accommodating. Guess you got the idea!"}
{"text":"The Host seemed to have lived past it's glory days. When we moved to Toronto, I heard from multiple folks on how great the food is here. Sadly, despite our multiple attempts we're yet to be awestruck.

We have sampled almost every item on a rather limited menu and none of it left an alluring aftertaste. 

As of the $16 buffet, I find their chaat section decent. All other options, again limited, are pretty simple.

3 stars for ambiance, service and non-impressionable food. Not very keen on returning to be honest."}
{"text":"I always have a lot of expectations with indian restaurants. Every restaurant has its own version/flavour of food and this makes them different from others. I ordered tandoori momos which was different and nice and chutney served with it was great. But panner tawa masala was not that worthy and tasted ordinary. Decor is rustic indian and has party hall too. They seem to have decent buffet spread so may have to try that in future to see if my views change!"}
{"text":"There are a few places that I like for Indian food and all of them are in the GTA West.  This isn't one of them!!  Thanks to my co-workers, they've immersed me in the ins and outs of Indian food.  I love the richness of the curries and the spices they use in authentic cooking.  The Host is somewhat authentic but it really does cater towards the North American palette.  If you're looking for flavourful dishes, this is not your place.  The dishes are milder here, a lot of the tomato based dishes taste the same, and they primarily taste of onion and cumin only.  

The restaurant is pretty old but they've kept in pretty good condition... it's possibly because it doesn't have a lot of traffic.  It's one of the more expensive options in Mississauga for Indian food.  I think it believes it is the 'upscale' dining experience.  The decor is rasteful and it does have several private room for you to use.  It is clean... that I will give it full credit for!  My co-workers have dragged me to a few Indian places where I was afraid to sit down.

The service was pretty abyssmal.  We had a group of 10 people here and the room was only 20% full.  It took nearly 10 minutes to get our waters and this is when we reminded them twice as well.  Perhaps we looked young but the staff wouldn't even look in our direction half the time.  We had to flag them down (airport landing style) to order.  Between all of us, we must have ordered 12 things to share.  Butter chicken, tikka masala, murgh labradar, shahi murgh, fish curry, shrimp coconut curry, chicken tandoori, chana masala, and saag paneer.  (I know that isn't 12 things but I can't remember what else we ordered :P).  We also ordered lots of naan.  For a while, we just sat talking happily but after 30 minutes of no staff or dishes showing up at our table, we wondered what was going on.  We asked them if the dishes will come out soon and they said 'yes yes' soon.  Another 15 minutes passed by and we asked them again!  We got the 
'yes yes' response.  After 50 minutes, a friend got up and went to the manager to ask them what was going on... unapologetically, he just told us that we would get our food soon.

After an hour, the dishes started to arrive.  We were starved at this point.  We all dug into the jasmine rice and started to pile on the curries.  A few people wanted to wait for the naan so they didn't start eating yet.  I was too hungry to wait so I tried the seafood first since I love it... normally.  The shrimp was over done... rubbery and tough.  It was not good at all.  I'm not sure how much coconut milk they put into this curry because it was watery instead of rich.  I then tried the saag paneer.  It was decent but relatively unflavourful to other places I've been to.  It was a touch too oily perhaps.  The fish curry was ok.  As I made my way through the chicken curries, I noticed that a few of the chicken pieces were a bit tough as if they had the connective tissue in them.  I wasn't the only one who noticed it at my table.  Though the waiter claim to use chicken breast, it was more like chicken leg with connective tissue in it.  The tikka masala and butter chicken sauce was really really similar... the only difference was the amount of ghee they put in the butter chicken.  You can feel the oily coating on your tongue as you ate the butter chicken.  It was too much.  I like butter chicken for the flavour and richness but this was like they just dumped fat in.

About those naan ... they showed up 15 minutes.  Waaaay too late but oddly enough, they were the only saving grace of the entire meal.  They were large, well charred in some spots, and with the right amount of butter on it to give it flavour without being oily.  I wish whoever prepared the naan also cooked the rest of the meal.  The naan raises this review up from 1 star to 2.

If you want a good Indian meal in an environment where you're not afraid to sit down and have good service, head to Avani instead.  It's just 10 minutes north.  Tandoori Flame in Brampton isn't a bad buffet either.  Just head anywhere else but here for 'upscale' Indian food."}
{"text":"The Host offers a good selection of food, including my favourite palak paneer with garlic naan. They have a nice patio, which is perfect for those hot summer days. Service is superb and the quality of food is pretty good. It's not my favourite Indian restaurant in the city, but it's definitely in my top 5. If you happen to be tired and hungry after a shopping spree in Yorkville, stop by The Host and have a nice meal. I don't think you'll regret it."}
{"text":"Whenever I've wanted AUTHENTIC Indian I have had to venture to downtown Toronto; no longer is that the case! 

The Host was impeccable when it came to service. From being greeted at the door to leaving after the bill, multiple wait staff were helping at our every request. 

The food was very good, with a wide variety being offered. We tried some of everything and were not disappointed. 

I especially recommend the chat papri (appetizer), the lamb chops on the sizzler, butter chicken (of course had to try it!), and the roti. 

The central location of the restaurant also makes it an ideal spot for large parties to meet and feast together. 

Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"The food was so so. It was surely not the best Indian food I had. It was expensive for the amount of food they gave. Ambience was good. Pricey, may be its because of the restaurants location. I had malaikofta which was good, baigan something which was so so, chicken 65 was too spicy I heard."}
{"text":"One of the best places I've ever been to from beginning to and experience was fantastic chicken tikka masala was amazing and the Kingfisher beer was on point"}
{"text":"My friends and I were looking for vegetarian, lactose free and gluten free food downtown. The host had excellent options for our dietary restrictions and provided excellent friendly service. The ambiance was warm, romantic, inviting and very clean. The food was beyond delicious and the spices were to die for. Bravo The Host! We will be back."}
{"text":"Excellent service . Had my sons first birthday party in the private room . Service and food were excellent ."}
{"text":"First, keep in mind that I am not Indian, and I never eat Indian food.  First time really that I tried it.

But this place is great!  The servie is efficient, they are quick to refill your water and bring over bread.  

I've been here for the buffet, and for dinner.  Both times good.  I especially like the buffett since it offers different food than I am used to, different than other buffetts like Mandarin, King's buffet, Imperial, etc.  

I would say the food quality is good, but they offer only a limited variety of food.  Mandarin offers 3 times as much food imo.  And The Host does not have much of a dessert option.  

This place is worth a try.  Message me if you want more info on their type of food.

{"text":"Ok the poor service has been replaced with exemplary service / services. Everything is always served hot and fresh, and tastes A+.

This is definitely my fave spot to eat at!


*Recommending the Kulfi (mango), for dessert and Chai tea"}
{"text":"We had gone to host on April 11 for brunch   The food was not fresh  whatever food was mixed with cold left overs  was really bad when asked for alacart daal  I was discouraged that would be too long   While others were still coming in for buffet   I had severe stomach issues ....
Diarrhea  .  (the bread maker was quite rude)

{"text":"Good find near the Park Hyatt hotel. The $25 winter prix fixe menu is a great idea and the portion size is perfect for one. I had a lamb kebab appetizer, chicken tikka main with chole, plain naan and rice, and carrot halva for desert. They were very tasty. I also had a mango lassi, which wasn't as sweet as I am accustomed to.

All in all good food and good value."}
{"text":"Been trying to come here for a while now, but never got the chance..
I got the chance to come here for a quick bite with a friend, my first impression was 'meh' and it pretty much stayed like that for the rest of the visit.
the place is 'ok' nothing outstanding at all, in terms of interiors, food or service. There are better places in my opinion not too far from here, but it plays around the mediocre league"}
{"text":"WOW. I am blown away.

After reading their mediocre review - I was hesitant about coming here, but I decided to come with an open mind anyway.

The first time I visited The Host was just less than a month ago. I rememebered I was skeptical when we walked in a Friday night and we pretty much had the whole place to ourselves... from what I remembered, I was quite impressed with the quality of the food -especially their \"famous\" tandoori chicken. Unlike most dry tandoori chicken I've had in most places, The Host was succulent, juicy and definitely lives up to their well-deserved name for the \"best tandoori chicken\" around. It is quite pricey tho.. as it is advertised as \"fine-Indian-cuisine\". So expect to spend about 80$ for a couple.

After our satisfied visit for the first time, we decided to give their lunch buffet a try. I mean for 15$/pp, and after our mind-blowing meal the first time, we thought 15$ is a steal if they upkept their food quality. I'm not an Indian food connoisseur , so I don't know how many different kinds of Indian food there are but you'll find you basics: salad bar, curries, samosas, pani puris (definitely a must try!!), and even street food! The quality definitely dropped, which is expected for any buffet, or any place that mass produces their meals, but it is still by far one of the best Indian buffet around.

I would highly recommend The Host to anyone who's craving some good Indian food around the area...This is probably my go-to spot now!"}
{"text":"2.5 star

I am never a fan of Buffet... but if my friends are interested, I am always game..since at least I know even the food sucks, I have fun sharing the experience with them!

The Host lunch buffet ($11.99) was a really disappointing experience. Since it was not too busy on a Wednesday afternoon, I found most of the food were lukewarm... and most of the the dishes were toned way down for the level of spiciness. 

At first my friend was worried about the spiciness of the food after his Mother India's and Hopper Hut spicy experience... but here, he can just chowed down plates and plates of food without even asking for water refills or breaking a sweat!

The services were indifferent and cold...without a smile... the waiters did do their job of filling up our water glasses and taking away our dirty plates. 

I don't think I will come to The Host again for their lunch buffet."}
{"text":"Small dishes of good food. I had the chicken Tikka Masala and found that the  sauce was tiny given the large amount of rice served (pay extra for rice!)."}
{"text":"I wanted to give a 5 star review but it's hard to when your eating and see a cockroach crawling beside your leg!!!

For valentines I thought this would be a cool place to go because I love the location in Yorkville so we booked reservations and here's what happened.. 
The restaurant is hidden inside a big \"shopping mall\" for Asians. It was cool though because it had FREE underground parking and in the -25 degree weather that's a bonus!

We went up the elevator and followed a group of strangers through the mall to the restaurant (which had no sign pointing which direction to go).. 

Walking into the restaurant you can smell the amazing food! 
It was dim lighting with candles on every table (so romantic).
They seated us in the back at the \"couples tables\" with only 2 feet between each table. Everyone was listening in on everyone's conversation... It was kind of funny. 

The servers were average and the food amazing as always!! 
I was just annoyed at how small the tables were.. We only ordered 2 chicken dish, 1 small rice and 2 nan and we had no space for anything more.... :( 

AFTER EATTING THE TABLE NEXT TO ME - THE GIRL STARTED FREAKING OUT SO WE LOOKED OVER AND THERE WAS A COCKROACH CRAWLING ON THR COUCH IN BETWEEN US!!!!!!

After seeing that I was ready to leave ASAP.. Not going back. ."}
{"text":"Came here on a whim and absolutely loved it! 
It was a Saturday night and we didn't have reservations and got seated right away.
The second you open the door you can smell the delicious food!!!

Ive got to say this is the best Indian food I've ever had!
This restaurant place is a hidden gem.
The service was helpful and very friendly!
Delicious flavourful food!
The restaurant is huge and I don't recommend reservations.

Make sure you order the green chicken"}
{"text":"As Indian food enthusiasts, I was quite disappointed in the food here. I would say the food was very bland, lacking spice. The garlic naan was pretty good. The service was also good. We went during lunch time and it was empty. We chose the location due to its proximity to our hotel. Average Indian food."}
{"text":"Plopped into The Host Friday night in serious need of Indian Food. My date and I got right down to business (food-wise). We started with the spinach chaat, with potatoes, chick peas and spices.  It was a bit sweet for a chaat, but still pretty decent. For dinner we shared Lamb Roganjosh, Mutar Paneer, Jasmine rice and a single garlic naan. As to be expected with The Host, the ingredients were all top quality.  You could taste the crunch of fresh peas in the mutar paneer, and the lamb was soft and tender.  The portions were pretty solid and our single naan easily fed both of us. But ultimately, there were no real standout flavours.  Everything was pretty mild and it all kind of blended together. I'll be back of course, but there are better Indian food options in the city for less money.  (Like at my mom's, for example.)

Obligatory Title Pun: HOST-a la vista, baby. (WTF?)

Menu Readability: Elegant.

Need to mention: Even though the washrooms are in the basement, they are super classy.

What this place teaches me about myself: It's sometimes hard to pay for Indian knowing my mom's cooking is only half-an-hour away."}
{"text":"We got out of a business meeting around noon. We were hungry, and didn't want to spend too much time looking for a place to eat. I got my phone out, looked on Yelp what was closest with a good rating, and there we went.

Lunch formula is a fixed price buffet. The choice was fairly limited, comprising some of the usual suspects. The food was ok, not great, and not terribly warm.

Based on the reviews, it seems this might be a good spot for dinner, but the lunch buffet is quite ordinary. But buffets usually are anyway.

If you're a big eater and looking for a good bang for you buck, you'll probably be happy. If you're a light eater, you'll feel that its expensive for what it is.

I would be tempted to try it again for dinner, but maybe not as there are so many good options in the area."}
{"text":"One of the most excellent Indian restaurants I have dined at. 
The buffet has a wide selection of  items and you can eat to your hearts content. 
They recently  renovated  and look more  sophisticated.  Went with a group recently and we ordered off the menu. The food was excellent. We  loved what we ordered. I know you will as well. I will return for  the buffet and new menu items off the menu ."}
{"text":"When to Host on Saturday for lunch with my son. They sitting us pretty quick due to not to many customers yet.
The food is not the best...chicken briyani the rice bit mushy/ to soft, chicken butter is dry bit runny and the taste butter is to weak. The chicken tandoori was ...meeeh ...and for the goat I bit enjoying it.
The waiter was questioned about how old my son is so he can charge correct amount. After I ask the bill is seem they just charge to regular price for adults so seem no child price. I'm not really sure how much the regular price ... I'm not sure if they display the pricing .
They charge for both lunch is $45.18. With that price and the quality food I received, seem I pay but much ...to pricey. I'm not sure if we will coming back."}
{"text":"It is a very average Indian buffet. The selection was quite limited for lunch. Naan was quite dry today (not sure if it's just a one time thing). Goat curry was so so; the goat was not very tender.  Butter chicken was decent. 
Food was mediocre, passable for buffet standard I guess. I wish the selection was better though. 

The highlight was the freshly made Jalebi (deep fried pretzels soaked in syrup). They make it right in front of you."}
{"text":"This restaurant has excellent chicken tikka masala and I gather great chana masala as well. Its naan bread was okay - well baked but plain, and the waiter didn't ask for clarification on type of naan when it was ordered. 

From entry to the restaurant to getting menus took ten minutes. It was another five before we got water - when my guest asked questions about allergies, which the waiter took as an order. When she asked for a few minutes to think things over he started asking me for my order. She clarified and he left... for another ten minutes. 

We finally got our food over an hour after we were seated, and... the lamb my guest had ordered wasn't lamb, it was, instead, goat. When we asked, we were told it was because the lamb had \"a little bit of dairy\" in it. After having been told that it was no problem to make lamb with a simpler curry, this was disappointing... but having been brought an entire dish we didn't order was just ridiculous.

After we returned the dish, our meal was good - until I wanted a second naan or any extra water. Over the course of ninety minutes my glass was refilled twice, both times because I asked. 

There were further issues with getting takeaway containers and receiving an incorrect amount of change on our bill, but seriously. Judged purely on the food, I'd give this restaurant four stars. The service was worth less than one."}
{"text":"Decent selection of  Indian food for $15.99 per person. I find it too dark in the room where they have the buffet table.  I love the tandoori, curry goat and butter chicken. I tasted all the vegetarian section. So much fried stuffs as fillers. Not much selection on dessert area. They have an ice cream area where it has been scooped to the bottom and must be sitting there for awhile. Guess until they are emptied. The sitting area is nice and bright but going inside this dark room to get your food is just depressing and not appetizing. This place needs a makeover. Just too depressing."}
{"text":"When I last reviewed this place, I criticized them for their lack of dessert selection. Well, I just went back for the same lunch buffet and this time they had little bite-sized pieces of chocolate brownies amongst the desserts. They're really good!

One of the staff was topping up one of the dessert items so I made a comment \"Oh, I see you folks now have brownies...\" He said they've always had brownies for the lunch buffet so maybe they had run out last time I was there.

Anyway, I went and grabbed a handful on my way out the door! LOL"}
{"text":"Feel free to take this review with a grain of salt.  All the other Yelp reviews tend 4-5 stars.  I've been here 4x.  The first time, I loved going w/ some colleagues and easily blew some $$ here...  

Yay's:
-yummy mango lassi, about $5.50;
-and seriously the BEST Baigan Patiala (Eggplant curry) that I've ever enjoyed;
-the garlic naan was also quite tasty - hopefully yours won't arrive w/ too many burnt patches;
-finally my date's Mulligatawny soup was quite satisfying, he's said;
-location is good/convenient enough.  If coming by TTC, I'd get off at St. George and then walk east.  Closer than if you got off at the Bay location.

Hey's:
-ugh.  I can not recommend this place for their Friday lunch buffet.  Meal items were not labelled (with the sole exception of their butter chicken), selection was limited, we were disappointed.  After all, The Host is an upscale place - we expected more.  Limited options also for vegetarians - I didn't even like the veg choices that were offered there, too much;
-gad, it's too easy to feel very full after eating here.  Not sure why.  I guess b/c there's a lot of cream based foods??;
-also, there's a most annoying whirring near the front door - so while sitting there affords a lot of natural lighting, it will *regularly* and annoyingly sound as though fireworks are going off.

Would I go there again or order online from them?  Heck yeah.  Their Baigan Patiala is second to none."}
{"text":"Love their Indian buffet! They have a great variety of vegetarian and meat dishes.  I've only gone during their lunch buffet as it's very affordable to try a little bit of everything! Their butter chicken is the best I've tried compared to other restaurants I've been to.  They do switch the dishes from time to time so sometimes it's a little nice surprise to see more variety."}
{"text":"Great food but they really don't know how to serve! I waited so long for a sauce I asked. I asked for a glass of sparkling water and he gave a 750ml bottle without telling me. So disorganized when actually serving the food. 

The quality of the food was good!"}
{"text":"Tried The Host through Uber Eats and the experience was good but nothing fantastic. The food arrived nice and hot and it was very tasty. There were enough sauces for the different plates. We don't often order or have Indian food but this still seemed comparable to home-made authentic Indian food I've had in the past. Would like to visit the restaurant in person as I'm sure it would add to the experience."}
{"text":"Came on a Sun aft for a baby shower. Place was very busy and the set up seemed a bit confusing as the buffet area was shared amongst everyone. Overall buffet area was very small but food was good. Wish there was more variety."}
{"text":"One of the few places in GTA where you get amazing Indian food (not too spicy, not too bland) , good service and decent selection of drinks. Tandoori food is a must. Try the tandoori chicken. They introduced tandoori momo- which is by far the best take on the momo family.

If you like mangoes, try their mmmm mango martini..don't expect a martini but a mango flavored alcoholic drink - which you can't get just one.

Only drawback - the place has started to look a bit dated. A little more color and elegance can do wonders to this place."}
{"text":"Our party of four showed up on a Friday night for our 8:00pm reservation. Our mission to tackle the winterlicious menu. Upon arrival a hostess greeted us as well as another male who I assume is the floor manager. He took over saying he had the perfect table for us.

We were seated in the front of the restaurant in what seems like a glass extension was built onto the original building. It was kind of cool because you could see the brick of the old building with windows intact. It felt like we were seated in a green house as the glass front was surround with lots of fresh plants. I can see this as being a really nice spot to sit the summer time. However since it was winter it was a bit cool but the manager turned on some heat lamps so we never felt the chill.

The winterlicious menu here is phenomenal, there are sooo many choices and options to choose from. Several waiters took care of us that evening and they were extremely gracious and attentive the whole evening.

To start we were served a complimentary amuse bouche of a crispy Papadum with a refreshing cilantro chutney. 

Next up were appetizers.

I went with the Samosas which were served in a pair. To my surprise I received beef filled samosas although the menu said they were vegetarian. I actually didn't realize they were beef until my second bite when I went to smother them in the chutneys decorated on my plate. Needless to say I never bothered to complain to the waiter because I thoroughly enjoyed them.

For mains I went with one of my all time favourite Indian dishes

Aloo Gobhi - Classic simple preparation of Potatoes and Cauliflower florets perfectly done in thick masala
I absolutely loved every last bit of this dish. The vegetables were perfectly cooked still retaining a bit of the crunch and the balance of spice and flavour was mild and comforting.

My entree also came with a choice of side which included my second favourite Indian dish

Awadhi Khatti Dal - full-flavoured yellow lentil with a tinge of raw mango, yogurt and garlic
The dal had a very bright and zesty flavour from the addition of mango but balanced with the tangy yogurt and subtle garlic flavour

In addition to all that we also got a choice of rice and nan. Since there were 4 of us at the table we basically ordered all the rice and nan options so they brought us platters of each. The real winner was the nan. Fresh from the tandoor still warm and lightly charred it was perfect for mopping up all the last bits of curry. But the garlic nan was out this world! We demolished it all with in seconds of landing on the table. Eaten as is or with curry it was highly addictive. Our waiter was soo good in offering to bring us more in which thankfully accepted. 

Finally for dessert as if we weren't stuffed from all that delicious Indian food.

Kesar Kulfi - Saffron flavoured homemade ice cream 
Although the menu said it was safforn kulfi - I'd have to say it was predominately pistachio flavoured - dead give away as being green and garnished with pistachios. Perhaps it contained saffron but nevertheless I didn't bother to complain because pistachio is my favourite flavour! The kulfi was a bit too hard for my liking though the pistachio flavour was great and the salty bits of pistachio was good for taking the edge off the sweetness it was my least favourite dish of the night.

Overall I have to say the Host really shines in giving you that Authentic comforting Indian food. Although the restaurant may look a bit dated and they had a few menu mistakes the service here is really impressive. Every single waiter was well mannered and courteous checking on us and keeping our water glasses full. Next time you have a craving for Indian food definitely check out The Host to get your fix."}
