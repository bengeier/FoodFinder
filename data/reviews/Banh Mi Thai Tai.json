{"text":"Beef saute sweet onion with all the toppings! mmmm my favorite sub.  I love the salad rolls too.  I have tried subs at other vietnamese places but end up with mystery meat.  Just can`t beat Thai Thai.  I really wish they would put a location in the NW!"}
{"text":"Thai Tai Timely - Not the best Vietnamese subs (little light on the protein portions) or the best bubble tea (powdered fruit flavoring on occasion) in Cowtropolis, but the availability of the two along with the rest of its menu, good open/close scope, and a great location, makes this a convenient place to satiate your Red Mile munchies."}
{"text":"I love this place. We order from them all the time at work. They're friendly, helpful, and the food is DELICIOUS!  Pineapple beef subs are the best - sweet, spicy, delicious and filling!  Bubble tea? All of it is delicious. Pearls? Tasty. Jelly? Also tasty. Exploding pearls? SO DELICOUS!"}
{"text":"Thai Tai is consistent quality, they're open late, prices are good, and the bubble tea is amazing!  I'm very dairy intolerant, and unlike some other places that just use powder only (and say yes yes it has no dairy when most all powders do--most places routinely add sweetened condensed milk too, you have to really be careful), Thai Tai use good natural ingredients (i.e. real fruit) & will make you dairy-free bubble tea if you ask them.  The only reason I didn't put 5 stars is because they ALWAYS put cheese on everything without asking the customer.  Very odd as with traditional Thai food that would never happen.   FIne, put the cheese on -- but then PUT IT on your menu for all to see.  Then those of us really allergic don't keep having to ask for \"no cheese please\" after you've already made our food!  All in all, Thai Tai is an awesome institution.  Especially for late night hunger attacks ;-)"}
{"text":"The name is fun to say, and the food is pretty good. The subs are super filling, but stick to the regular sate meats as the curry chicken was kind of boring."}
{"text":"This is how it goes. You go to the Ship, Bungalow, Yardhouse, Melrose or any other 17th Avenue on a weekend night. 2 AM arrives. You get ushered out by 2:30 and you're starving. Sure there's Wicked Wedge but I don't want pizza dammit. I want something ELSE.  Thai Tai is a brilliant option in which to soak up your tummy full of alcohol. I pretty much stick to my favourite: the curry chicken sub and the taro bubble tea with pearls. This will cost about $11.50 and it will taste like a lil slice of end-of-night-heaven. And there's always comraderie with fellow night owls on the prowl to calm the tummy growl. That's the kind of rhyme you'd make at the end of such a night. *giggle*"}
{"text":"I used to go here daily because it was just a quick run from my high school.   I've got to say, everything was decently priced. I was very satisfied with paying less than $10 daily for a fresh meal. I was typically there around the lunch hour, so I'm not going to complain about long lines and wait times. That was inevitable due to the time and location (lunch hour + high school students = no good).   The food is SUPERB, but this place had one flaw: The plum sauce.   I'd receive my order, the Veggie Spring Roll Bowl. This came with, tofu, my choice of rice or vermicelli, and two veggie spring rolls. All great....until you'd pop open the box to frustratingly find that your only option for dip is a cup of fish sauce. Really? I don't know about you but I eat my spring rolls with plum sauce.   After months of providing them with my loyal business, I one day finally worked up the courage to ask for plum sauce. Please note that I asked this politely, I was not aggressive with my request, and after asking, received two packets of sauce. That's barely enough for half a spring roll! But, because I was in dire need of plum sauce, I accepted the packets and went on my way.   Every day, both my confidence and craving towards my request for plum sauce grew stronger. I'd ask the same polite way for some packets, but eventually I'd say, \"can I please have more?\" This is when the feud truly began. After I said those words, my relationship with the employees faced a steep decline. You should have seen the look on the lady's face when I asked for extra. Utter disgust. Following that, I only received one extra packet.   I nearly reached a point of acceptance with the received quantity of packets until I watched my friend order their 4 piece spring roll meal. Four spring rolls and a CUP of plum sauce! I knew it to be true, there WAS more sauce. And so, with that newly obtained knowledge, I confidently asked for more sauce. As routine followed, the lady handed me: Two packets of sauce. I'd ask for more. She'd hand me another.   But that day, I didn't just leave after receiving the 3rd package. At first, I did turn around and take a step towards the door, but I knew what had to be done. So, I turned back around, squinted and said, \"wait...don't you have cups of plum sauce?\" You will not believe what happened next.   The lady looked me straight in the eyes and nonchalantly squatted her way to the floor. While she was doing this I really thought she was going for the cup of plum sauce, but five minutes passed and I grew suspicious. I peered over and down the counter and there she was, still squatting, with a chapstick clenched in her left hand. My question drew her under the table!   After that day, my experiences at Thai Tai were awkward and uncomfortable. I began ordering fries so I didn't have to ask for plum sauce. I'd still recommend this place to anyone, I'd just warn them to be careful with what they ask for."}
{"text":"Predictably tasty bahn mi, in all the right ways. I would definitely come back here if I lived in Calgary. Whether it's a quick lunch or an after bar snack, you won't be disappointed. ~$6 will get you a filling sandwich. The only downside of this place is the small uncomfortably seating. It's not gonna impress your date. ;)"}
{"text":"Context is always an interesting aspect to consider when reading a review. Admittedly, this was the first time eating at Thai Tai sober. After a night of blissful inebriation, there isn't much left for an objective opinion on food and service. This time around, sober and clearheaded (more like translucent in my case), the food didn't live up to the expectation. The pineapple and beef sub had a muskier taste to it than last time and turned my stomach for a few minutes. It also felt less sweeter and took more time to make even though the line was shorter this time. The service here also was not that friendly, could a customer get a word let alone a smile? Unfortunately, this trip was one of disappointment. No more documenting of experiences when in the context of intoxication, lesson learned. Wouldn't want my yelp license suspended!"}
{"text":"Does this place need another review? probaly not, but I have to say I really, REALLY enjoyed my buddha veggie sub on whole wheat with the works, including thai sauce and peppers, hold the onions. Will definitely go back for more."}
{"text":"Thai Tai is a good fast food standby on 17th Ave.  The Vietnamese-style subs are awesome - my favorite is the satay chicken.  They use bread which is soft yet crusty on the exterior, and pass it through a broiler to get everything warm and toasty.  The portion of chicken they put on is perfect - about equal to the amount of veggies when you get it loaded with all the toppings.  I've tried the sate noodle soups and they are pretty good too, with a good balance of heat.  There are no tables, so it's a great place to do take-away.  The lineups can get long on late weekend evenings when everyone's indulgence in alcohol has led to a craving for subs.  Other times, it's not as busy but it may take a few minutes to get your order.  This is fast food, not FAST  food.  In terms of taste and value, I'll take a sub from Thai Thi's over one from subway any day.  Review #10 of Yelp's 30 Day Review Challenge 2012"}
{"text":"Best Vietnamese sub in 17th Ave SW. I'm glad they open late. Although, I wish they can have some tables to allow customer to eat inside. I will order the ultimate sub: Sate Beef and Chicken mild spicy but have a good kick on it."}
{"text":"This is a great place to get some fast food take-out that is tasty and much more nutritious then many other fast food options. Their soups, sandwiches and pearl drinks are all yummy. They have great vegetarian options too. The service has always been good for me. My experience at other locations has been good as well. Parking can be a challenge at this location and there is not a sit-in option."}
{"text":"Craving a bubble tea and on 17th Ave, I decided to duck into Thai Tai. Service was fast and there was a lot more selection then I thought there was going to be. (including popping bobas - yum) I ordered a Mango Papaya with Lychee popping pearls and waited to savour my thirst.   When my drink was handed to me though I was a bit disappointed... the consistency was already runny and very \"syrupy\" like what happens when you leave one standing for 10 mins (maybe it was over-blended?) first taste was good but very very sweet. I usually have no problem finishing bubble tea's but half way through this one I felt like I was on a sugar high like no other - dizzy spells, tongue swelling and throat itchiness...  I'm not sure if this was a personal reaction - but since I never experienced this before from other bubble teas... who knows... I'm going to stay clear from this location in the future, which is too bad because it is quite convenient."}
{"text":"The food here is very good value for your money - it was a very cheap meals for four very hungry people, it came to only $50 and that included enough leftovers for lunch for everybody. Wonton Soup is mostly tasteless, unless you added spicy homemade sauce which they provided for free. My sons loved the chicken and the shrimp that came on top of the vermicelli noodles but the noodles themselves were again mostly tasteless.  My kids also like to be spring rolls but I thought they were mostly batter and not very much filling. Anyway we will return again and try some other things from the menu that we didn't get to sample."}
{"text":"Are you kidding me? So so good. The ultimate sub and shrimp wonton soup are epic. The ladies run a pretty tight ship and you get in and out fast with fresh food. if I had to pick a weak spot it's the bubble tea because its to addictive."}
{"text":"Thai Thai on 17th serves the second best bubble tea in the city. The first best is from Bubblicous in the N.E., but if you're not planning on making a trip down there anytime soon, the bubble tea at Thai Tai is sure to satisfy.  I always get the same kind: Strawberry & Mango with pearls.  SO friggin good.  You know I love them because I'll go to Thai Tai JUST for the bubble tea. You'll never see me leave with any food because the bubble tea is what satisfies me to the core.  If you've been going there regularly but have yet to try their bubble teas, I highly recommend you do. Oh, and be sure to try the Strawberry-mango, it's a killer combo!"}
{"text":"Yummy in my tummy... The subs are really good. Whether you have the beef or chicken sub, you'll definitely be satisfied. This sub shop isn't like a subway, they are more of a fast food sub and noodle joint with the typical bubble tea.   Location is next to a high school so you can imagine how many go there over lunch. Parking also sucks but it's not easy to park anywhere on 17th really.   It's not as nice inside as I would have thought... Employees have no dress code, just street cloths... T-shirt and jeans. No room to eat, just order and leave basically.   So where they lack in atmosphere they make up for taste. It's worth trying out if you're in the mood for Vietnamese style subs or noodle bowls."}
{"text":"I was just an innocent Yank passing through from Banff to Glacier National Park down in Montana, not suspecting the food in Calgary would be as amazing as it was.  Thai Tai is excellent, and representative of the other offerings.  I have to look for an excuse to get back to this town on an expense account."}
{"text":"I found the name of Thai Tai a little confusing...it is more Tai and not so much Thai.  They had excellent spring rolls but I found the late night staff to be a little unfriendly and not so polite.  I was also not happy that when I asked for Teriyaki sauce on the side they gave me sauce that was filled with chunks of meat, a fact I did not notice until after I poured it all over my rice. As a vegetarian this was gross and a huge waste of food.  I bought a Chicken Teriyaki sandwich for my friend which did not at all look like chicken, blegh."}
{"text":"After a delayed flight and getting to the Air BnB after 10pm, it didn't take much research to figure out virtually everything is closed in this city. Thankfully, this place wasn't too far away and also had good reviews.   It's a small place ideal for a take out. I got a couple spring rolls, the ultimate bahn mi and also a vermicelli bowl. Wow, did we nail it! Everything was super. To confirm it wasn't because we were hungry, we ended up taking the leftovers with us for lunch the next day. Equally as good, all things considered.   When we came back to Calgary I was tempted to go back but we just ran out of time. This will certainly be on our list for our next visit to town!"}
{"text":"Quick, cheap, and good.  I've had better banh mi in the city but this place has good hours and  a good location."}
{"text":"Dear Thai Tai,  I understand that your staff probably don't want to deal with having to clean up a customer bathroom - especially since you're situated on 17 Ave. I worked a few blocks down for a year and I only let pregnant women and children use our store's bathroom.   But don't put an \"Out of Order\" sign on your bathroom door if your staff is going to use the \"out of order\" bathroom TWICE while I wait for my sub to be prepared. That's just bad form.  Minus 4 stars for lying, extra star because I USED IT ANYWAY, HAHAHA!  Protip: Lock the bathroom door and have customers request the key."}
{"text":"I stopped here late one evening after being out with friends. Too many drinks and not enough food! My tummy was in need of a Thai sub and right down the street was Thai Tai. I'd been to one of their other locations so I knew what to expect: a tasty sub at a decent price. And that's what I got. I ordered the lemon grass chicken sub. The onions were a little stronger than usual so I had to pick most of them off. Didn't want to have anyone I breathed on faint. I always like the Thai sauce they put on their subs. To me, that's what makes it so good. If you haven't checked out Thai Tai, you should. They have 4 locations in Calgary so there's probably one near you."}
{"text":"Here for work and they gave us a really crappy per diem...Calgary is expensive!  Found this place  near the hotel.  I ordered the #25, which was chicken with beef sate over vermicelli noodles.  The meat was a little tough and dry, but still edible.  It was served with a good sweet and spicy sauce.  Good portion size for under $10."}
{"text":"I was not that pleased paying $7 for a Viet sub coming from Toronto where I am used to paying $2.50-$3 for a sub but the subs here are 1.5 times bigger than Toronto's typical sub. I got the charbroiled pork sub - different from what I expected. It wasn't like the \"banh mi thit nuong\" I expected like what I get in Toronto. It was saucier and more westernized. Not a bad place for bubble tea. Large size for $5 and everyone in my group of friends enjoyed their BBT. Not really a dine-in place- good for take out. Overall, not bad but not authentic."}
{"text":"I am DEPRIVED without my Thai Tai!  Their Wor Shrimp Wonton Soup is to dieeeeee for! Although I have not lived in Calgary for the last 8 years, I visit frequently and the last 2 years Thai Tai is always on top of my to-go & late night eating food expenditures. Especially since I reside in Erlton when I am in the city.   The wait is never horribly long. Patience = fresher food, anyways, so why wouldn't you want to wait?"}
{"text":"Favourite place for a sub after a night-out. Great service and love the taste. Its very clean and great ambience if you want to stay n eat. Dont like my subs any other way. Best part not just one location but there are many throughout the city."}
{"text":"Cruisin' down 17th Ave and hunger strikes. \"You want to grab a Vietnamese sub?\" I ask. She looks at me. \"What's a Vietnamese sub?\" SCREEEEEE! I pile on the breaks (in a safe and controlled manner) and hang a quick right into the parking lot of you guessed it - No, not Tim Hortons. THAI TAI!  Followed very closely behind eating these delectable baguettes stuffed to the brim with spicy beef sate, pickled carrots, fresh cucumber, cilantro, jalepenos, and those tiny red peppers that explode spicy all over the inside of your mouth when you chomp 'em, is taking other peoples' Vietnamese sub virginity. As a rule, Calgary is pretty 'down to sub', so this hasn't happened in a long time. Needless to say, I pounced on this rare opportunity like a puma would pounce on whatever pumas might pounce on.  This is a clean little take-out restaurant and a great place to satisfy all of your Vietnamese sub desires. There are no tables to sit at, but there is a dentist office style waiting area with some seats to wait at, or quickly push a sandwich into your face."}
{"text":"second best vietnamese submarine in the city.  next to thi thi.  I'll be back for more for sure.  The chicken was great, the beef was great.  Just the right amount of spice."}
{"text":"There isn't many places in the city where you can get an inexpensive vegetarian meal on the fly or late at night. Thai Tai is a go to for all types of dietary needs and it hits the spot every time."}
{"text":"It's not often enough I come here, even though I work right across the street. But when I have a craving for Vietnamese Subs, especially the chicken, I am there fast, the service is always good, the Subs are great, their portions are great, the prices are great as well, the only thing is the wait sometimes, it is a busy little place, but with great places comes big lineups,....worth the wait, and make sure you try the bubble teas, delicious!"}
{"text":"Came across this place while I was wandering down 17th ave.   I saw the words bubble tea and had to check it out!   I ordered a lychee bubble tea with half pearls and half popping jelly. They seem to have a number of flavors in each to choose from as well as from their regular jelly.  It wasn't the most flavorful bubble tea I have ever had. And I really should've just gone for the regular jelly instead of the popping kind ( which seems better suited for frozen yogurt )   The sub  was a different story - it was  generous portions of both chicken and beef cooked to perfection and let's you chose  what you wanted on top !   I decided on cucumber, cilantro, grated carrots and the thai sauce on a whole wheat bun. It was quite a large size and I was able to split it with my girlfriend.   I would certainly go back and explore different options of the bubble tea next time and order the sub the the exact same way!"}
{"text":"My fave is the Sate Beef Sub, fully loaded.  It's so good.  I find they do not stinge on the beef.  The veges are fresh and I love the red chillies they put in the sub.   The size of the sub at least 10\" and the diameter is about 3\".    Also, I had a taste of the Sate Beef Noodle Soup.  The broth is tasty with a hint of spice.   For my beverage, I had the Jackfruit Bubble Tea with Mango Jelly.  Yummy and so cooling!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for something cheap and fast, Thai Tai is the spot. Open late every day of the week, this is the place to go when you want easy on a late Saturday night.  There were a few people eating inside but majority of customers were grabbing food to go. We were in the same boat. It's more of a take out joint than a restaurant.  - Sate beef salad roll (#4) ($5.00) - we grabbed a beef salad roll to try. There were only two of them. Pretty mediocre but they were pretty stuffed. - French fries (#8) ($3.95) - crunchy and better than your average fast food joints. My one friend orders them all the time and loves it but I thought they were a bit stingy on the amount that we got. We were starved so these were gone pronto. - Spicy sate chicken (#27) ($6.70), veggie (#20) ($4.25) & cold cut special (#21) ($5.95) - three of us ordered banh mi's to go. These weren't the best I've ever had but were decent. Portion size is gigantic, you'll be full after eating one. They toast up the bun for you (yes!) and you can choose what you want for your toppings (everything obviously). - Sate tofu and veggie spring roll bowl (#35) ($8.50) - our other friend wanted a more substantial meal so she opted for the sate tofu and veggie spring roll bowl. Lots of tofu, shredded lettuce/carrots and green onions over your choice of steamed rice or rice vermicelli noodles. Again, big portions but it hit the spot. She had leftovers for the next day.  With so many other options on 17th Ave to choose from, I can't see myself coming back anytime soon unless I'm craving some late night banh mi's eats. I haven't been able to try banh mi's elsewhere but I know there are better places in Calgary for them."}
{"text":"I came across this place when I was wandering on 17th Ave SW and my stomach reminded I hadn't had supper. This place is mostly for take-out but they have a couple of benches and tables where you can sit if you want to eat there (nothing fancy, though). I ordered a chicken and spring roll bowl, which was very filling. It seems this place is mostly known for their bubble tea, but the food was very tasty as well. For a small place like this, they have plenty of food and drink options! I will have this place in mind next time I am wandering on 17th Ave."}
{"text":"Best bubble tea in town in my opinion, but the food isn't that great. I recommend the kiwi bubble tea with lychee popping pearls."}
{"text":"I give this place 4 stars for their food b/c it was a GREAT chicken satay sandwich.  But they get a -4 for their restroom!!  OMG...  we had just left the National across the street and wanted to grab a sandwich real quick.  We had to go to the bathroom and the toilet was FULL of toilet paper and paper towells and it wouldn't even flush.  There was trash EVERYWHERE!  We told the girl at the counter about it and she told us there was nothing they WOULD do about it.  Seriously??   So, all in all, the food was great and the bathroom sucked!"}
{"text":"I thought I should try another local business near my home for supper so I decided I felt like bubble tea today and the closest establishment to me is Thai Tai.  I wanted something that had parking, was a quick takeout service and delicious.  Of course I found all three at this location.  Thai has its own allotted parking area but they share this with a Cleaners and a Travel Agency so although parking is available it can be very messy if three or four cars are moving at the same time in this small area.  Upon entering and from the outside I expected the place would have tables but it is solely a takeout place which was fine with me, I wanted something to nurture me while watching videos tonight.  And what I saw was a huge mouth watering menu and about 40 bubble tea options many using fresh fruit. Thairiffic!  Just to mention a few: watermelon, lychee, mango, banana, honeydew, coconut, jackfruit, kiwi and taro.   Expect spring rolls and oriental salads, oriental soups, rice or vermicelli bowls and what Thai Tai is known for of course; subs! Your usual choices of lemon beef or chicken, tiger prawns, and vegetables.  Tonight I ordered a lemon chicken with tons of cilantro and a cantaloupe bubble tea with pearls.  When I got home and unwrapped my sub I was reminded at how large these are, approx 10 inches and for the same price I have paid for a half sub at Subway which is approx only about 5 inches.    The bubble teas here are around 4.95 and there are places in Calgary that you can buy these for lesser prices but at Thai Tai it is served in quite a tall container.  All in all twelve dollars for my whole take out meal, so satisfying and so refreshing."}
{"text":"I've gotta say, I enjoy my Thai Tai subs. My favourite sub is the Teriyaki Chicken with some cucumber, carrots and cilantro. The bun has a nice crunch to the crust. It's just the right thickness to go with the sub filling as well.  I quite enjoy the lychee smoothie as well. It's the same thing as the bubble tea, just without the bubbles. You heard it here, you can definitely ask for your bubble tea without the bubbles. Little jelly things in my drink just freaks me out a little.  Note: I'm not sure about the other locations, but the 17th Ave spot is more of a walk-in/take-out kind of a place. There's one bench to sit down and wait on, but no tables. It works if you got the sub, but if you ordered any of the other meals, expect to be finding somewhere else to eat it."}
{"text":"Oh summer is here!!!!!....? (Calgary weather -_-).  Thai Tai bubbletea is definitely a summer time drink that you will greatly appreciate while the hot sun shines down on us.  Fresh fruit is preferred!  As previously reviewed, try the FRESH watermelon bubble tea or the FRESH honeydew pineapple!  They are both nice and light, quenches the summer day thirsts perfectly!   Give them a try! :)"}
{"text":"Some people say Thai Tai is only good for drunk food and those people would be wrong. Why do I need to be drunk to enjoy their huge, delicious, and cheap subs! I love how customizable their subs are; you can get whole wheat bread and you choose your own toppings and sauces, like you would at Subway. They also have interesting flavours like pineapple beef (my friend's favourite) and a great vegetarian options (I always get the saté tofu). The yam fries are also amazing!! I haven't tried their drinks yet because I'm always way too full from one sub but it looks like they use real fruit, although I have yet to confirm. Overall, it's one of the best banh mi's I've had in the city and a favourite quick bite to grab on 17th - drunk or not."}
{"text":"There are 3 Vietnamese sub places around Western Canada High School and this place is the most expensive. The quality and size of subs are the same compared to the other places but I don't know why they have to charge $6+ per sub when it's $5 everywhere else. The place has nice interior decor though! Recommend: the $4 fries - they're huge."}
{"text":"Man, do these guys know how to make a mean sub!  I'm no expert on these particular subs, but I am an expert at what I like to eat, and Thai Tai certainly hits the good spot!  I was super surprised by the variety of their menu and could barely decide what I wanted.  I finally settled on the sub and couldn't believe how much I enjoyed it.  The stuff they put on the subs may seem a bit weird, but it all tastes so good together!  I especially enjoyed getting it to go so that I could enjoy a nice stroll down 17th.  They wrap it so conveniently that it's simple to walk and eat at the same time.  I also got a bubble tea which was a nice contrast to the slight spiciness of the food.  But, you can never go wrong with a bubble tea!  Next time I crave a sub, I'm not going to think about getting Subway, instead I'll probably hit up Thai Tai for another delicious sub and refreshing bubble tea."}
{"text":"This place is great for late-night drunk walks home, but the subs are just so-so. good bubble tea flavour selection. prices are good."}
