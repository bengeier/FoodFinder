{"text":"Really wonderful staff, everyone is so kind and friendly! Super affordable, and the quality of food makes you feel like you should be paying more. My meal was so fresh and tasty, seriously one of the best shawarmas I've ever had! Also, the potatoes and garlic sauce are just heavenlyyyy"}
{"text":"I wish I can rate this nice little restaurant a five! I love the chicken ( I believe it's called shish tauk) but  not the same with the beef, a little bit too dry for my taste. Overall a good cp restaurant and nice service!"}
{"text":"Crazy good food.  Hubby and I had the combination beef and chicken plate plus the shwarma pita sandwich.  Delicious!  Can't wait to go back and try the other items."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised with this place! The staff was really nice, everything was clean, and the food tasted amazing. They also do catering for business parties or large groups.

I came here for lunch really craving a shawarma and some garlic sauce. I usually just go to Boustan for that but decided to give this place a go. The meat was great, the sauce was creamy, and the overall wrap exceeded my expectations. It tasted fresh and savory. 

This place is located in the Galeries du Parc but they made an effort to have their own seating area so it looks much nicer than the rest. 

They also serve fresh juice and desserts.

The potatoes were cut a bit too big for my taste, but they were still very good. Not my favourites though.

Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I love their beef shawarma trio and potatoes! Super tasty and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Set apart from other Shwarma stops by virtue of the care and precision in which the food is prepared/served. A simple authentic taste of Lebanese-fare, it takes care not to slather grease or deposit salt over its food. As good as the classic shish taouk is, my favorites here are the tabbouleh, as well as the grilled items. The merguez and kafta are absolutely delicious. I feel that for the price, I can get a larger quantity at other locations, but all in all 4/5!"}
{"text":"I was looking for Halal restaurant since I was visiting Montreal. When we walked in the restaurant the owner greeted us with salaam. He took our orders it was well prepared with big portions. He kept asking us if we need it anything else. If your looking for great middle eastern Mediterranean restaurant this is the place. Friendly owner and staff."}
{"text":"Very delicious food served by very nice and professional people. I never expect to find such a tasty shawarma and kebab in Montreal . The prices are reasonable and you can find most of Lebanese dishes . Wish them all the best with more success"}
{"text":"Their beef shawarma is one of the best I have ever had in my life. It's not a take out place where you stop by one day and forget about. I came here with no expectations but was pleasantly surprised. The meat was well-seasoned and the toppings tasted fresh. The price ($6.49) was also reasonable. 

One star off because I got a little cringy when I noticed that their staff use their bare hands to make shawarma sandwiches. I hope the cooks don't share the cash register duty."}
{"text":"I'm not a vegetarian but I think the vegetable rolls there is very good! As a student nearby, every time I got a little hungry but not that much, I'll grab bite and I really enjoy it. I was told the chicken here is good too, will try next time. 5stars for sure!"}
