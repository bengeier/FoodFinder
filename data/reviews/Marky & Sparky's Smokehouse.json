{"text":"Tuesday evening my bff and I arrive just after 6 pm. We were cautious upon trying this place after some of the negative reviews, but being me, we had to give it chance. The restaurant has 2 tables & bar-like seating along one side, very small space. I approach the cashier & he hands me a menu in which to order from,  FIRSTLY informing me that they're sold out of bread... so much for my pulled pork sandwich I was craving for!!! and NO chicken wings either... The excuse \"oh it was busy for a Tuesday, so we sold out\", This line doesn't work for me.  For me, it simply translates to \"you haven't got your kitchen or staff in order\".  So then we ordered the pulled pork & beef brisket 1/2 pound each, four corn bread muffins & fresh hand cut fries... $30 dollars later!!!  Firstly the meat, these people should NOT be doing bbq, I'm sorry but if you want good brisket ... Aft. Pulled pork not tender enough, long stringy strands and served in a CUP??. Appearance reminds me of an old mop head, cannot account for the taste either... what the heck kinda sauces are they using?? Corn bread ... too dry...no taste Fries. Oily & undercooked  We didn't finish our food, had lids to pack it up & we head over to plan B... The Stockyards for some great customer service, juicy fried chicken & pulled pork sandwich ....ON A BUN!!!"}
{"text":"Reviewer that said \"the prices are great\" must eat at North 44 and  Auberge du Pommier regularly vs BBQ joints! Opening was packed with no ribs, chicken or pork left at 6pm so ordered for picked the next day.  1 rack of ribs, 1 brisket sandwich, no sides or sauce came with it... $43!!!! (and I ordered sides) BBQ is to be plentiful and reasonable. We all know it is trendy now but give me a break.  I know the meat is supplied by the co-owner so that should be very good but I am not sure of the other partner that is doing the smoking."}
{"text":"Delicious.  It's been a long time since I've had ribs as I no longer will eat factory 'farmed' animals.  Great to know that the food here is ethical as well as very tasty."}
{"text":"I wouldn't ever imagine calling myself a rib person by any means because I really dislike when strands get stuck in my teeth yet I've visited here twice and both times I leave loving the ribs! They are so tender they melt in my mouth.   I'm a dry rub kinda guy so I like my wings flavorful and clean. At Marky & Sparky's their smoked meat is seasoned to perfection. So much so it brings me back to when my late grandfather used to smoke turkey and ham in his backyard smoke house for us; it was always a treat!   Coming back to the ribs, we had both wet and dry and both too were seasoned to perfection. The brisket was also delicious. And for not being a fry guy either, loved them because they were crispy on the outside, tender on the inside and seasoned, again, to perfection with a little bit of salt and spice.   For those who love saucy wings and ribs, there is enough types of sauces to feed an arm and they are all really good too.   Try them out, get full and repeat. Oh and don't forget to wash it all down with a Stewart's Classic Root Beer!   Cheers!"}
{"text":"Been going here regularly for the past year. The menu is simple which is good. Customer service is A1. The ribs are the best I ever had. Unbelievably good. The price is on the high side, but fair in my opinion for the quality you are getting. Parking and seating isn't the greatest but that's no problem. I'd give M&S a 4.5 star!"}
{"text":"These guys make great pulled pork sandwiches and ribs. The sauces are delicious and  the sides - coleslaw and beans - are very very good. Get a large  size of the beans. You're going to love them.   The ribs can be a little dry on occasion, but they are always smoky and delicious. Just add more sauce and everything is fixed."}
{"text":"The main features (brisket, pulled pork) are fantastic & all the sauce options I've tried so far have been unique and each add a little something different, but other items have seemed a little hit-or-miss.  The onion rings were perfect, and the caponata is okay, but didn't care for the wings or slaw at all.  The staff is really nice though, and the sandwiches will definitely keep me coming back."}
{"text":"I like the brisket sandwich here. I have it a lot with the chipotle sauce and the side of beans. They also have a pretty great southern style biscuit. Service is consistently good and prices are really good for the portions I think. I was surprised to see other reviews suggesting it's expensive. I've often remarked with my GF that it would be hard for us to make this stuff on our own for less money."}
{"text":"Smoked wings are fantastic, as are the ribs. The pulled pork is quite good. The brisket might be a bit too salty but it's good as well accompanied with some sauce. Beans are excellent, they come mixed in with some pulled pork. Coleslaw could have some more tang. Sauces are very good; try the chipotle and the onion jam. Biscuits are delicious, fries are nice and fresh.   Lunch sandwich special is a good deal."}
{"text":"Ordered take out and it was pretty bad. Ribs were dried out and tough like jerky. The price was shockingly high - 2 full racks of ribs and 1 lb of brisket, plus two family sides came to over $100. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"I'll cut them a bit of a break for seriously under estimating their opening day business- although running out of cornbread by 5:00 pm seemed a little odd given that you can make more quickly if you are making it yourself. SHould have been more in the oven, given the limited number of options on offer. No dinner plates here- more like ordering chinese food as everything comes in a separate cool little cardboard tub. Brisket($8.) plus Pulled Pork($7.00)plus 2 sides at $4.00 each for a bill of over $30. When emptied onto your plate, there wasn't much there.Southern food is cheap poor people food slow cooked, and should be either inexpensive or plentiful. This wasn't really either. Brisket and pork were excellent. Beans okay- though $4.00 for a cup of baked beans is a little much. Cole slaws were only okay. Lots of cool little touches- the cardboard tubs, the paper shopping bags for carry out. The staff weren't even close to being ready for the business. This feels like somebody's investment in a trendy market more than a labour of love like all of the great southern barbecues are. I wish them luck, though I will leave it to someone else to review the $22 club sandwich."}
{"text":"Just ordered delivery from here for the first time, and it was amazing! We'd been to other BBQ spots in T.O and had been disappointed, but everything here was super tasty. Even the roasted sweet potato side was memorable and full of flavour.   Fantastic meal, and super friendly service. Definitely will order again."}
{"text":"Poutines are salty, but still better than most in the city.  Brisket was good.  BBQ chicken for lunch was good.  Like Swiss Chalet, but tastes like real food, and they have good dips for the chicken too.  Looking forward to trying their ribs!"}
{"text":"It took me two visits to get enough food to write a full review. If you check my other reviews, I'm a barbecue fan and with all of my travel I track down the best spots in whatever U.S. city I happen to be in. I'm picky. I also have a personal taste for barbecue with more smoke to it.  I was on my way to another spot to try when I saw M&S on Annette. I quickly looked them up and they seemed solid. One try is as good as the other, better still if it's 15 minutes closer.  Order 1 was a triple-hitter of meat. Pulled Pork, Smoked Wings, and ribs. Sides were baked beans and onion rings. It also comes with two biscuits and a pickle. While a bit pricey on the surface ($35), this is a seriously big feed that is enough for 2. Even my huge appetite for barbecue couldn't get through (much) more than half.   I'll get sides out of the way: All good. Thick rings, tasty and meaty beans, very solid biscuits. I love biscuits; nice touch. The smoked wings were well prepared, still juicy and smoky. They don't fry them at all. I think I would have found a way to crisp up the skin, though; a quick trip to the grill, perhaps. The pulled pork was a surprise. It can be so boring sometimes. Not this time. I could tell seeing it in the tray in the kitchen. Rich colour and nice pieces of bark. The flavour was smokey and it wasn't dry. The ribs also had a great smokiness to them. Nice pinkness of smoke. They were relatively meaty, definitely not fatty. The sauces I picked (spicy BBQ & Chipotle) were both good but I think that they need to add a house-made Carolina-style sauce to the list (i.e. mustardy for the PP). The Chipotle sauce is more of a creamy sauce; good for fries / rings. They were out of brisket, so I saved my review until I'd had it.  Order 2 was a brisket sandwich with fries. Fries are good, pre-salted, thick cut with peels. The bun is also good (a ciabatta, maybe?). Most brisket I have had in TO is lean, dry, and not smoky. Bad, bad, bad. This was juicy / slightly fatty and had good smoke to it. If I had to pick on something it would be that it was ever-so-slightly too salty. The thick slices fell apart, as they should. A really good brisket. It's a big sandwich and the serving of fries was generous.  This is now my favorite BBQ place in TO and I live 300m from another one that is generally considered the best (their brisket is weak).  Can't wait to go back, but I still do need to try the BBQ joint I was headed to in the first place."}
{"text":"Amazing bbq, friendly staff, great place.  About 8 seats so plan ahead if you are dining in."}
{"text":"I go to M&S to meet a friend for lunch on a regular basis, probably twice a month.   Seating is limited, so we either go just as it opens or a little after 1.   We always have the lunch special - brisket with the chipotle and onion jam. So flavourful. This is not a light meal, so if you are concerned about calories, go someplace else.   Sides are all delicious - fries, beans, cole slaw, choose what you like or try multiple.   I've also been for dinner - equally as delicious. We go as a family of 4, not the lowest priced option for dinner in the 'hood, but even my mostly vegetarian daughter enjoys it.  My son devours the wings.   Word of warning - bring your appetite."}
{"text":"Stopped in here one day during lunch and asked for a menu. The person at the counter was quick and attentive and informed me he didn't have any available but did offer to give me one of the printed menus he had downstairs. I confirmed they would deliver to Roncesvalles and I was on my way.  Ordered a few days later. Had the sampler with brisket, wings and ribs coleslaw. ordered fries on top to meet delivery minimum.  the good: Delicious, delicious bbq. the brikset is by far the best I've had in the city. the wings were very smokey ad the ribs seasoned quite nicely. the pickles and biscuits included were all fantastic. Loved the spicy BBQ sauce. They actually gave me some free root beer! I had asked about it on the phone but opted not to order it. When the delivery guy showed up he said they were on him. Nice!  the bad: I didn't receive my coleslaw. it was too late to call them back so I didn't actually get a chance to try it. the ribs, while tasty, seemed a little over cooked. or something. I'm not quite sure. I ordered a side of the \"chipotle\" sauce and I'm not really sure what it was. It was creamy and tasted more like chili powder mixed with sour cream. If you've ever had a 7-layer dip, it tasted like the layer where you mix taco seasoning with sour cream. It didn't taste like chipotle, nor did it seem appetizing to put it on the meat.  All in all, i really, really liked the food. above average. unfortunately, there were a couple things that I didnt like. I'll probably order from them at least once more to try it out."}
{"text":"We've had takeout twice, and I ate-in once (today)  The first time we got takeout we got the pulled pork. For me, pulled pork is either great, or more often its not. In this case it might be some of the better/best pulled pork I've had. Wanting a change, the 2nd visit saw us get some pulled pork and some brisket. I loved the brisket!  Each time we also got the creamy cole slaw, which we all really liked! Today I had lunch there and order brisket on a bun with spicy BBQ sauce, baked beans and an extra side of cole slaw. Total was about $16 Sandwich was very good. Brisket was tender, juicy & nicely done, as before. I'll definitely go again!"}
{"text":"1st off my problem here is not with the food. That is very good (ribs could ease up on the rub), but the brisket is amongst the best I've ever had.    We have pretty much had it with this place, due to lack of consistency. While the food is good it is way over priced. $24 for a rack of ribs with no sides? $10 for a 4oz sandwich with no sides? $2.50 for a small Dixie cup of coleslaw?  How much does coleslaw cost to make?  Most frustrating of all is that every time we go there are changes to the menu, prices or food itself. That ruins the experience. Part of eating out is the expectation of the experience. Thinking about it and getting excited about eating it. When that's always changing on you without notice you get extremely annoyed & frustrated. Especially when laying out good $$$.   We live close by and love BBQ, but they need to get their act together before we return.  I've seen restaurants open for less time that are more settled than these people."}
{"text":"Three and a half stars.  This a good place that could get better over time. Here are some key points...  1. They are using organic meats and are co-owned (somehow) by Butcher By Nature across the street. 2. Prices for ribs are a bit high. However, the BBQ sandwich and side of beans (10$) is quite generous. 3. Being from the southern U.S., I felt that the sandwich was good, but not great. The meat is cut finely and blended with the sauce in a way that makes it a bit mushy and loses the rich flavour of the meat. While they will do it how they like, I think pulling the meat (or slicing or cutting larger pieces) then applying the sauce only when it is served would make it taste better.  4. There are not many seats, so unless you go at an off time, plan to carry out. 5. The place is a work in progress. If they continue to make the BBQ sandwich a quality every day staple (as in the South) and not a trendy, overpriced delicacy (as is happening now in town), it could just become famous.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Yummy food. Very smoked and very meaty!  Left with the meat sweats. Had the brisket sandwich and the pulled pork add well as fries and beans ( the beans were delicious!)  Also got the fried mars bar but was so full we had to eat that later."}
{"text":"First impression as you walk in is the deep smell of wood smoke... The brisket was amazing; best I've had in years of cooking and eating barbecue. The ribs were, hmm, adequate - not bad, but not great - good bark and nicely smokey, but a little too dry. However their barbecue sauces are a real mixed bunch - definitely some weird/unpleasant ones in there. If the one I got called \"chipotle\" really was, I'd avoid it. The wings are OK, the spicy sausage was good, the beans were excellent. A steady stream of people came in and ordered the poutines - I'll try that next time... The prices seem about par with equivalent quality joints around town. My advice - get the brisket!"}
{"text":"After hearing my co-worker RAVE about how delicious this place was, I was a little disappointed with my experience. I went with my boyfriend, and we ordered the sampler platter. The ribs were burnt and the pulled pork was extremely dry. I found their \"spicy\" bbq sauce to be watery and tasteless.   I'm not completely writing this place off, and I'm willing to try it again. I'm hoping that it was just an off night."}
{"text":"This place is in our neighborhood, and I've gotten take out a few times from here. The pulled pork sandwich is awesome, lots of meat and the bun is good quality. The sandwich also is fairly large compared with other BBQ sandwiches I've tried.  We also tried the beef brisket, and the wings and all were consistently delicious, flavorful and cooked properly.   They offer a choice of sauces with the meat so you can mix things up a bit.   The baked beans side is also really really good.   Worth a visit!   Too bad they're not licensed or we'd eat in the restaurant more often!"}
{"text":"On a sweltering night in July, we came to Marky & Sparky's for some BBQ eats.  Decided to dine in and sat at one of only two tables.  There was also a long counter with a few stools.  I think M&S is more of a take out joint.  We ordered at the cash - beef brisket sandwich ($11) with a side of beans and fries ($4) and the half chicken ($13) with a side of caponata ($5).  Definitely could have used a cold beer to wash it all down but with no liquor license we settled on a Dad's root beer ($2.50) and water ($1).  Our food came to the table pretty quickly after ordering.  The brisket sandwich was pretty big - soft, yummy beef on a nice fresh bun.  The side of beans was a very generous portion, not the shooter size that usually comes with sandwiches.  Fries were hand cut and fresh.  Half chicken was nicely seasoned and still moist.    We watched a lot of people with take out orders come and go.  M&S is definitely speedy getting those orders out the door.  They do tend to run out of menu items with the dinner rush so go early if you have heart set on something.  No AC in the place which contributed to my case of the meat sweats but M&S is a neighbourhood eatery I'd check out again for take out."}
{"text":"I've had pretty much everything on their menu and it is all very good. I regularly get the pulled pork and the beef brisket. Try the beef brisket with the house bbq sauce and the pulled pork with the onion jam. The fries are perhaps what they do best, they remind me the old school chip truck fries which are hard to find nowadays. Service is always polite and very quick."}
{"text":"We are huge fans of Butcher by Nature and were excited to hear that the same folks were opening up a Smokehouse as well!    We did not go on opening day, anticipating that it would be too crazy - but overall, the pulled pork and brisket were fantastic and portions were sizable enough for me to have to waddle home (ours came with sides of cole slaw - cream sauce or vinaigrette, and baked beans).  Prices were high for BBQ but not too ridiculous - if you are already shopping at Butcher by Nature, surely they wouldn't suddenly be selling cheap meat?!  The restaurant is still getting through opening hiccups - getting stock right (they were out of specific sauces), taking orders - but I anticipate that they'll figure it all out.  The seating area is also fairly crowded - but someone told me they are opening up the adjacent spaces up for dining area, so that should help as well."}
