{"text":"Foods great! Service poor. Not managed well m, can't turn tables. 
Carpet in front smells horrific. 
Furniture and floors need deep clean. 
Wait staff looks unsanitary, dirty nails and hair. 
A shame for Rocky River."}
{"text":"My cousin and I stopped in for brunch a couple Saturdays ago. We were seated right away and our waitress was nice. I notice a bunch of the reviews complain about the service here. Can't say I experienced the same poor service, but we weren't very needy that day.

Our food was awesome, and that's always most important to me. We shared a salad with fried goat cheese on it and an eggs benedict-ish thing with crab cakes and fried green tomatoes. YumEEEE!

The coffee was pretty decent and made us want dessert, but they were out of just about everything on the desert menu. So that sucked, but I'm looking forward to going back for dinner soon."}
{"text":"Alright, after visiting Sweet Melissa 4 times (2 breakfast and 2 dinner), I have to comment. As the previous reviewers noted - the food is good, I'd say even \"pretty good,\" but the service is just downright poor. For the most part, servers don't really seem to know what they're doing - forgetting waters/drinks, not knowledgeable about the menu, when you ask about a dish they respond with a deer in the headlights -  \"its good!\" Asked about beers on draft and she just muttered something and walked away to check. This place straddles the fence between casual and family friendly and chic and hip. Personally,  I think it suffers from an identity crisis.

Any positive of the food is completely wiped out by the poor service. With plenty of other restaurants to choose from, you can do much better. Please improve!"}
{"text":"First time here and came highly recommended.  Arrived at our reservation at 6:30 for a table of 9.  It took 15 minutes for our initial drink order to be taken and then 30 minutes to receive our drinks.  When we did receive our drinks they were warm and we had to take them up to the bar to have them re-chilled. Then it was 45 minutes after arriving to have our food order taken.  The service overall was very slow and took over 2 1/5 hours just to have dinner.  We did find out it was our waitress' second day on the job. So taking on a table of 9 and other tables of at least 5 or more was probably not the best idea for management to have a beginner to do on Mother's Day.  Even though how highly it was recommended, due to how slow the service was we will not return and won't be recommending it to others."}
{"text":"My dad and I went for lunch on a Saturday afternoon. It wasn't busy at all, yet no one would seat us. When a food runner finally sat us, she rolled her eyes as we sat down. The server was friendly enough, but not very attentive. I ordered the turkey club with fries and my dad ordered the chicken salad sandwich with fries. Everything came out in good time, but no one brought us napkins or silverware. We tried asking twice before anyone brought some over. The fries were soggy and cold, and both sandwiches were soggy and had absolutely no flavor. Even the bacon in the turkey club lacked flavor. How is that even possible with bacon? Overall the staff was unpleasant and the food was bland and unappetizing. I don't think we will be returning."}
{"text":"Wow amazing! I've been going here for years... Always amazing! Not only is the food the best in town... The customer service was one of a kind.... Dawn was thee most polite yet humorous... Love love loved it... Upon my arrival I was contemplating killing myself... It involved a shotgun and a gas can and a bottle of the works toilet cleaner... But we won't get into all that... The kindness of that server gave me a new lease on life and now I work a full 12 hour a week job and support my 7 children... Thank you sweet Melissa 2000000 stars"}
{"text":"Great place, great food. I was a little hesitant after reading the reviews, but My husband and I still gave it a shot. The service was great! Loved the menu. I also thought the childrens menu was great, tons of options. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Sweet Melissa's in Rocky River has a reputation as a healthy, organic, upscale food place. The decor is full of clean modern lines, the water carafes are laser etched with the restaurant logo, and the cakes are really good.


   I was there with a bachelorette party. Xander is an awesome server- he was friendly, quick and got the orders correct of a whole table full of excited ladies.


   The blueberry margaritas were very good.... and VERY strong. They have LOTS of vegetarian options and even vegan options.   I got the baked eggplant which was delicious: pictures on my blog at (http://whatsincleveland.blogspot.com/2011/05/sweet-melissas-rocky-river.html)"}
{"text":"I used to love this place. Love the matzo ball soup, veggie burger, buff chicken wrap, nut encrusted fish, meatloaf, goat cheese salad, tofu stir fry, tacos, mango iced tea, bloody marys, etc. The last time I went there (before this past Sunday afternoon) was brunch LAST summer. The service was awful. They were so in not attentive, didn't bring half of our meal, just awful- and zero apologies. I missed it there though, so we went back. The place was not busy and the service was so slow again!! I also noticed the food quality has declined. Change, please, I want to keep coming there, I miss the old sweet Melissa's"}
{"text":"Brunch. Biscuits and gravy. Biscuits were nice but the gravy had the taste and consistency of chicken paprikash. It tasted fine, but not how it was intended or advertised. Potatoes are the real star of the show and eggs were vast and well done. The scone and fruit are excellent."}
{"text":"Third time here, very disappointing. Bacon extremely dry, \"bacon bit\" consistency. Breakfast potatoes were not completely cooked through and very bland, the ranch sauce was the only thing that saved them. And the two dollar charge for two ounces of extra syrup is ridiculous - Ohio Maple or not. Will definitely be making the trip to the west side location from now on."}
{"text":"Sweet Melissa's is our favorite place to eat! We take our out-of-town guests there too. Good atmosphere for kids. Excellent quality of food. Variety of choices for both vegetarians and meat lovers. 

Love the new steak and kale salad. The pulled chicken risotto is the perfect comfort food. Other favorites; fried brussel sprouts, pumpkin gnocchi, lemony green beans, and warm goat cheese salad. Cupcakes! Kids (and adults) love gazing into the glass desert case."}
{"text":"The three stars are a compromise of the four stars I would give for the brunch and dessert selections, which are the reason to check out this cute spot in River and the 2 stars I would give dinner and service -- while there are a few dishes on the dinner menu that may also qualify, in general I have found the sandwiches and entrees to not be as delish as they sound. The latest upgrade to having full bar service is def an upgrade. The service tends to be pretty lackluster and I'm being kind...."}
{"text":"The food was amazing, the service could have been better. 

My wife got the delicious ABC omelet which had Apples, Bacon and white Cheddar. The apples had a sweet crunch and really compliments the smokiness of the bacon. 

I got the crab and eggs that were listed under the favorites section. Over easy eggs on top of crab cakes and fried green tomatoes, covered in a chipotle aioli! 
Each meal came with a chocolate chip scone and some fruit in a little dish, which made for a nice little appetizer. Also with our eggs were crispy red skin potatoes with I think some sort of sour cream sauce, which was an awesome compliment to the eggs! 
The coffee was really good too. 

I would highly recommend it and we will come back again."}
{"text":"This place is conveniently located within walking distance to my inlaw's home, so we eat here regularly while visiting. We have had mixed experiences at this restaurant, none were exceptionally good. Once we even got up and walked out after horrible service from a waitress. The food is better than edible, the fried rice is delicious and flavorful and the fried green tomatoes are a favorite. This time i ordered the wild mushroom frittata.. Wasnt bad but decided I'd rather have it in the morning for breakfast. My wife ordered the veggie burger... she didn't love it but she is really picky about her veggie . Overall the food was edible. Unfortunately, yet again, we did not love our waitress.... She seemed distracted, sped away from our table while we were still trying to order, forgot to bring water until almost 20 minutes later and other tables received food well before ours even though we were seated much earlier and ordered the same thing. We are always polite though. Mostly because our in-laws are the ones paying... That's what brings us back."}
{"text":"I had a salad and chicken tacos. Go here instead of those dreadful chain restaurants. The food was really good, healthy, and original. I really liked the open concept of the restaurant. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The menu is great.  The food is good and reasonably priced.  The problem is they are completely discombobulated.  It's as if even the manager hasn't had training in how to run the operations of a restaurant-- and so some of the staff have no idea what to do.  I ordered a side salad and an appetizer and specifically requested that they come together as my dinner.  Well, the appetizer arrived right away.  I reminded them that I'd asked for it later and they just sort of shrugged.  It turns out that it was someone else's order -- and so they didn't get theirs until right when their food was out.  In the meantime, our food took forever, and by that time, the appetizer that was supposed to be with my meal, was cold -- and mostly gone (but it was delicious.)  Eventually, they brought another appetizer out with the meal, which was the nice thing to do -- but they then it was a little late for it.  We were seated in the very back of the restaurant, which is no problem at all, if they remember that you're there -- which they didn't seem to.
This place has potential, but boy do they have a lot to work on in the service department."}
{"text":"Arrived around noon to a half empty restaurant. My wife and I have been there before and enjoyed the food for the nost part. Today, like most visits the service was slow and unfriendly. We were finally seated after the hostess acknowledged us, went to the area where the waitiresses hang out to avoid dealing with customers to discuss something, came back, answered the phone and then walked away with menues... Not my first time at a restaurant we followed and figured she just wasn't the talkative type. We were seated on the patio to wait... Apparently that was all they thought we needed was a good place to sit outside as no one returned with waters, to take our order, or let us know if anyone would come to do the things that are expected at a restaurant. The people behind my wife whom were there before we arrived finally flagged down a bus boy who said he would get someone. 10 minutes later my wife and I left. The food can be good but the service tends to be rude, inattentive, and slow."}
{"text":"Had dinner at Sweet Melissa's tonight.  I've experienced the slow service referred to in some of the other reviews, however tonight that was not the case.  Our waiter, Sal was prompt and professional.  The food as always was outstanding...and their red velvet cake is the best there is other than Mom's."}
{"text":"I visited this place a couple times in its previous incarnation as the very popular Max's Deli, and was curious to see what it had now become.  We went for weekend brunch on a very busy day.  

The food was great and our server was both colorful (brightly dyed hair and full tattoo sleeves) and very nice.  Although the brunch menu concentrates on things like bacon, eggs, bagels, pancakes and French toast (called \"dipped toast\") and doesn't feature anything outwardly unusual, they give ordinary-sounding dishes a little unusual twist and/or just cook them better.  For example, the potatoes served on the side are fresh wedges cooked to just the edge of crispy and topped with a dollop of tasty white sauce, and the \"bacon and eggs\" plate features Canadian bacon sliced thick, fried green tomatoes sliced thin, and eggs topped with a small amount of fresh Hollandaise, as opposed to drowning in suspicious sauce that brings to mind kitchen horror stories of eggs benedict fabricated from pureed leftovers.  I also liked that the portion sizes, especially the French toast, were neither tiny nor humongous, but rather a size that could reasonably be consumed by a normal sized hungry person in one meal. 

They have a decent selection of desserts available, although nothing too special or unusual was on the menu when we went - lots of cheesecake, chocolate torte, carrot cake and fruit tart.  They also do a chocolate chip scone that I like very much because it is light and fresh, as opposed to most scones I meet that are the weight and consistency of river rocks both in my hand and when sitting in my digestive tract. 

They have a full, very pretty bar but I too was surprised that there didn't seem to be any sort of cocktail promotion or drink special on a busy brunch day. I saw people ordering bloodies and OJ cocktails and was expecting the server to either present a drink menu or tell us about special drinks, but neither thing happened, and all I could see from my seat was a beer list on the wall - not the thing to have with brunch - so I decided to just drink coffee. 

Like Max's Deli, this place is very popular on weekends, and unfortunately that means a line clear out to the parking lot and a 45 minute wait time if you don't have a reservation.  I understand that except on a few special holidays, you can't even get a reservation unless you have a large party.  People showing up with reservations were also having to wait although the wait time was more like 10-15 minutes for them.  When we finally got seated, we noticed there were large gaps in the floor space for no apparent reason where a table for 2 or 4 could have fit without disrupting the traffic flow, so it was weird that the restaurant didn't have another table at the ready to pop in there and get a few more people out of the loooong line.  Maybe it has to do with server workload, as they did seem a little understaffed.  Also, be warned that at busy times, this place gets very loud (as it did when it was Max's) to the point where you need to shout across the table to your companion.  The design of the space is partly to blame - it's one big cavernous room without anything to absorb the sound of 50 conversations and a couple babies wailing."}
{"text":"The menu offers creative flavor combinations, fresh ingredients, vegan and gluten-free items--there's always been something that appealed to everyone in our groups. The cafe is one large urban-vibe dining area; its 2 street-side window bays have raised seating platforms that offer a little more private feel and are fun for people watching. If you enter from the street, walk through the tables to the bench area at the back to find someone to seat you. If you enter from the parking lot, seating area will be at the end of the open corridor. 

Down-sides: just a smidgen toward the pricey side, inconsistent service (sometimes great, sometimes abrupt and indifferent, etc)."}
{"text":"They definitely get some interesting dishes that taste at least good to great. But they're pricey... Really pricey. A taco is like $10 with no side, a pasta dish maybe $15. It gets expensive fast but they are \"local\" which I like. However.... I'm sick and tired of the crappy service I get there!!!!!!!! I usually opt for less busy times and I'll see the waiter or waitress checking frequently with their two other tables they have while I'm left with an empty beverage the entire meal. It's gotten so bad I haven't been there for months and have actually said no to going there because I don't like that they don't come back until they can see that I'm done eating, they bring the check and take the plates (but only take them sometime ) I feel they cater too much to others."}
{"text":"I am disappointed with my visit today. I asked for their risotto and what I got was a bowl of rice. Apparently chef does not know what risotto is and what type of rice is used for it. Dish was ok but very misrepresented."}
{"text":"I have been to this location multiple times and I am constantly baffled by the service provided.  On each occasion I have had to ask for someone to take my order (drink or food). The staff acts as if the customers are a bother and they aren't interested in helping or providing a meal.  They don't say hello or how can I help you or what do you need until you flag them down and ask to place an order and then they look confused and put out. 

The food is actually really, really good.  The fish tacos, burgers and soups and salad are great.  But when I go to this restaurant- all I can think about is how shitty the service is. We got take out to avoid the service, but then the food was literally thrown together in a take out box like leftovers.  Yuck

If this restaurant wants to survive- they need to seriously reconsider their approach to customer service....   they suck"}
{"text":"This review is a form of mourning for me because Sweet Melissa's has so much potential. The decor is fun; the menu is chock full of items that sound exactly like what I want to eat. For some reason, though, I'm never wowed with the food. It's always just good, not great, like they know how to make a delicious meal but are cutting corners or something and hedging their bets that you won't notice. The service is also slow in general but the last time I was there this sweet little blonde woman was our waitress and she was an exception. Their desserts, however - cakes by the slice, cookies, scones - are awesome and some of them are even vegan or gluten free. It's also really noisy inside since it's one giant room filled with all hard surfaces."}
{"text":"Probably some of the worst service around combined with over-priced, less than sub-par quality food. Will not be back."}
{"text":"What a sweet little gem. It just oozes personality. Unique decor, and if you don't mind being a little warm, ask to sit in the window. 

The menu's far more interesting than I expected. It's not the largest in the world, but there are a lot of great meals hidden in there, with some really exceptional flavors. Their take on a Caesar salad was awesome, and I really enjoyed the Bricked Chicken.

What really sold me on this place though, was Happy Hour. Sweet Mel's does it M-F from 4 to close. Love. It. I've been there at least once a week for the past three weeks just for that. $2 domestics, $2.50 imports, and a drink special. I think wine is $5 a glass, but it's not my thing so I don't remember. 

They also have a Happy Hour food menu where every meal is only $3. That's not a typo. $3. And they're substantial meals. More than worth the money (though you do have to sit at the bar or in the bar area--get there before the old winos steal all the tables). 

If you want to pay full price for a drink, they've got a fuller drink menu. Eric, the bartender, has a menu of interesting drinks that were worth the money to me (though some folks will never pay $5 for a mojito. Speaking of that, the mojito there is infused with honey and basil. It's a must-try for the mixed drink lovers.

Finally, there's the desert menu. According to them, everything's organic and made fresh in-house. According to me, everything's obscenely delicious. The cupcakes are huge, and their actual cakes are pretty awesome too. For $1 you can get three mini cupcakes, each a different flavor. I highly recommend it. 

All-in-all, a great experience. Interesting food, a refreshing drink menu, and in my mind, the best happy hour in town. I hope you love it!"}
{"text":"I love the decor. The restaurant is really clean . However the wait staff is pretty slow. I had biscuits and gravy it was OK the gravy had broke and it was not warm that kinda stunk. I did like the way they did there potatoes. And the complementary fruit cup looked not so fresh the white chocolate and cranberry scone tasted like a chunk of raw dough. I would defiantly give them another shot."}
{"text":"What a great find!  The boyfriend and I just drove by it one day, and we both said to each other, \"Hey.  We should try this place.\"  Sure enough, we ended up dining there that same night with our Sunday-dinner group.  

Some things to note about Sweet Melissa:

*Happy hour runs daily from 4pm-close
*They have a decent selection of vegan/vegetarian and gluten-free menu items
*A lot of the menu items, if not all of them, are fresh, organic and local
*They do not have beers on draft
*Their pastries are made in-house
*I literally wanted to order everything on the menu (I settled on the crab cake salad.)  

From the floor design to the style of the menu, I was at first concerned that a place like this would only serve tapas-sized entrees (which is cool by me, but maybe not by all of my friends)...but I was gladly mistaken!  The salad I ordered was a generous helping of lettuce and veggies, and there was just enough dressing for it.  The crab cakes were two in number, and were of pretty good size for going along with a salad.  They were nice and tender on the inside and had the right amount of crisp on the outside.  I especially liked the seasoning on them.  The salad also came with a chocolate chip scone-y thing -- a great finisher, although they're possibly keeping people from ordering dessert by automatically serving it with the entree.  I thought it was a nice touch.  The friends I was with really enjoyed their meals, too, which were: baked eggplant; lobster risotto; and Jenna's Grilled Cheese.

I'm going to hold off on giving it five stars because the other, more recent reviews are making me wary.  Although I wasn't bone-shakingly blown away by the experience there, it was pretty fantastic overall.  The food we had was delicious, our server was hilarious, the check didn't give me a heart attack, and it was just a nice way to end an already fun day.  You can't ask for much more, but I'd like to try a few more dishes, maybe at different times of the day, to get a better, more grounded feel for Sweet Melissa.  But judging from my first visit, I'm gonna go ahead and say that the missing fifth star won't be missing for long."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast and was pleasantly surprised by this joint in Rocky River.

Portions are a good size. You won't be stuffed to the brim when you walk out. I had the Greek omelette. It was good, but could have used more of the olives and artichokes and what not. Also, most breakfast dishes are served with a ramekin of fresh fruit with a tiny little chocolate scone on top, yum."}
{"text":"Very poor service. It usually takes a while to get food, which is pretty good, but on my last and final visit the hostess, manager and waitress were rude. 

We waited 50-60 min for food and then had to ask repeatedly for drinks. The waitress also forgot to put in the kids order. 

The management at Sweet Mel's is a little stuck on themselves. I just do not get it. They really have reason to think they are better than the patron. 
There are plenty of good restaurants in River. Try Wine Bar or Salmon Daves."}
{"text":"Love love love. Been a resident of lakewood for 6 years & this is always a favorite. Fabulous menu, organic & a ton of options. Looking forward to trying the new bakery out"}
{"text":"Decided to give Sweet Melissa another try - This time we dined there rather than take out.  The food was good although the menu was very limited.  Yet again, service was atrocious.  Long wait for the order to be taken.  Long wait between salad and entree.  Not only did the waitress not come and check on whether everything was OK or whether we needed anything during the meal, we were completely unable to catch her eye in order a second glass of wine.  So frustrated by end of dinner that we didn't order coffee or dessert.  She had way too many tables to attend to.  Management's fault! OK we've given this place plenty of tries - this experienced diner is done."}
{"text":"Went to sweet melissa today 10/17/2012 for a nice lunch with my wife on a much needed day off. Walking into the restaurant showed a beautiful well thought out restaurant design and ambiance. We were the 4th table in the place, pretty light crowd. The waitress immediately came to the table to start with drinks.  When asked about apps we asked for the waitresses suggestion between the fried green tomatoes and the warm goat cheese.  Instead of giving us a nice description of each she stated \" Um the goat cheese is a salad sooo\" so we just ordered the tomatoes which were very good with a nice seasonal fruit of cinnamon apple type relish.  First annoyance was the lack of drink filling, which we did not get until the middle of dinner.  My wife ordered the fish tacos and I ordered the crab cake sandwich with a side of fries, which looked amazing on another table.  My wife received her tacos and one taco was filled to the brim, while the other had a piece of fish the size of a crouton. A standard flour tortilla you would use at your home taco nights.  All in all the fish taco was good but nothing special. My crab cake sandwich came out with chips but no fries.  The waitress advised she had forgotten them so she ran to the back to put the order in. First few bites into the sandwich were delicious but exactly what I didn't want to happen did.  My 3rd bite revealed that this was previously frozen.  The disgusting taste of basically raw fish almost made me want to vomit.  When you freeze seafood you can try to cover it with as much spice as you want but that taste will finds it way to your taste buds. My fries came out as I was about ready to get the check. End of the day I could not bring my self to give this place another dollar and  get a coffee and some desert as we originally planned. Additional issues : Chips were greasy and stale and the plates are certainly not big enough to handle the portion size.  I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Service is super slow.  The hostess sat my party of 4.  We waited 10 minutes before having to go back to the hostess and ask if a server would tend to us. After placing our food order it took over 30 minutes to get food. Taste of food was mediocre."}
{"text":"Always had great food for brunch, lunch and dinner. Cute place as well. The happy hour is amazing and the options are great."}
{"text":"Vegan and gluten free options are available. Desserts that will turn heads and impress taste buds. Highly recommend Sweet Melissas as a lunch place or for a happy hour destination."}
{"text":"This place is just bad. I have never experienced such poor treatment as I have at Sweet Melissa. When we entered the restaurant it wasn't even at 50% capacity. We assumed we'd be seated right away! Apparently not. It took several minutes from entering for someone to even approach us. Once they did, they made us wait, and then proceeded to tell us we were waiting in the wrong spot. Once we were seated, my friend with an allergy immediately asked the server about the menu with her peanut allergy, which he responded, \"i don't know, I'm not the cook.\" After waiting about 15 minutes for our waiter to even return with silverware (which was dropped on the floor then placed on our table) we asked a few more menu questions which our server responded with the same attitude the hostesses did. We decided to leave, seeing there were other restaurants closeby who offered us better service at a cheaper price. I'm not someone who is hard to please, but I have gotten better service at Taco Bell."}
{"text":"Wonderful people as well as an interesting and varied menu.  I was brought here with several vegetarians and had my reservations but the food was great.   Parking was the only downside but that is usual for JCU area."}
{"text":"I wanted to like Sweet Melissa like the others but the service was SO terrible and slow.  I took a friend there lunch and it took 10 minutes for someone to come to our table.  I ordered a sandwich minus the cheese and my friend ordered a small salad.  My sandwich comes with cheese but not even worth telling her at this point.

I get the bill and see I was charged an entree salad price for a small salad but she never got a scone.  So I didn't even question the price, just asked for a scone for my friend.  Another 10 minutes goes by and she never returns with the scone so we just leave.  She says goodbye and never once offers to do anything.

It's a shame because the food is very good and the atmosphere is very nice.  However, the service is so slow and the wait staff seems so unmotivated, I doubt that I will ever go back.  It's too bad because there was so much potential.  Save your time and your money and eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"I went because I was still mourning the loss of Max's Deli and their epic desserts, and felt slightly consoled to see that sweet melissa seemed to be racking up some of their own dessert accolades.  I ordered the red velvet cake while my mom ordered a chocolate cake, and we ended up leaving disappointed.  I tasted my mom's cake, which was good, though not outstanding, and wished I had ordered the same -- though I know their cakes are homemade, mine tasted as good as a run-of-the-mill cake from the grocery store freezer aisle.  When the waitress checked in, I told her it just wasn't very good, and she apologized profusely, explaining that the regular baker had been out, and told me that a new cake had just been baked and that she'd send me home with a fresh slice of the new red velvet.  Unfortunately, it tasted about the same, and pretty flavorless.  Everything also seemed a little overpriced considering the quality.  I haven't been back since, but would be willing to try it again, on the good faith that hopefully, with the right people in the kitchen, sweet melissa's might be a little closer to filling the big shoes Max's left behind."}
{"text":"Very long wait time from when you are seated to when a waitress arrives at your table. When she finally arrived, she barely spoke above a whisper, did not engage us in any way, and took a good ten minutes to make our drinks because she'd rather spend time having conversations with her fellow employees than serving her table who could potentially give her a pretty good tip. We finally ordered our appetizer and waited almost 20 minutes for four fried artichoke hearts. After not finishing a tasteless appetizer that took entirely too long to get to our table, we decided to leave rather than waste our evening further. We had to wait about ten minutes to get the check then almost ten minutes for to retrieve said check. The final bill came and there was no pen. Between bad service, tasteless wine and margarita, dirty dishes, and lack of atmosphere, we will not be returning."}
{"text":"Ahhh, I really wanted to dole out more stars, but I just can't. I've been to the University Heights locations for brunch countless times, so I was curious about their dinner options.

I ordered the bacon wrapped meatloaf with mashed potatoes and garlicky spinach and marsala gravy. It pains me to say this, but it honestly reminded me of a TV dinner. 

The meatloaf was moist, but the \"marsala\" gravy did little for it. The marsala tasted nothing like traditional marsala, rather it had flavors reminiscent of Hispanic cooking. I can't really pin down what this was. The mashed potatoes were not smooth, and the spinach was not sauteed like I imagined it would be (it was fresh spinach) and I didn't taste any garlic. 

The servers were extra friendly, but I don't think I will be back for dinner again."}
{"text":"Their brunch is the bomb! I've had several of their omelettes and bagel sandwiches and I've never been disappointed. My favorites are the ABC omlette and the Heather bagel.

Each brunch option comes with fruit and a mini scone. I've been here countless times, and it seems I always have to remind the servers to bring this. Annoying, but I really love the scone, so I always ask for it."}
{"text":"I really wanted to give this place a good review.  I like the location and I LOVED Max's which was there before them.

But I will likely never go there again, unless Max's returns or something else replaces SM.  The reason why - well I'll try to explain in less time than it took to get our food (which was at least 45 minutes- I wasn't timing it, but it was a loooooong time).  And this was LUNCH on a Sunday and they weren't that crowded.

First off -the appearance of this place is great.  VEry high ceilings that appear to be copper embossed as you will see in many nice restaurants. Open and airy which is welcoming.  The bathrooms are small but seem to be maintained and clean- this is usually a sign of a place that pays attention to details.

But if they are looking for advice, here it is: Pay attention to your customers.  If there is a 2-year-old and a 5-year-old in a family, offer to bring their food out first instead of having everyone wait and start to think they have been forgotten about.  Don't ignore them. Give them some crayons like other restaurants do.  Don't make them ask for it after 35 minutes.   Here's another idea ... Be friendly!!!!  SMILE!!  

The general vibe I have had here was that they are not about service.  They are about appearing to have great food.  The food is not great, in my experience. I'm not saying it is impossible to have a good meal here - but generally speaking, there are much better places and I recommend going elsewhere if you care about service.

There's one thing that happened that sort of sums up my experience at Sweet Melissa ... a guy with a tie (I assume the manager?) came up and asked how everything was.  I told him that both times we've been here, the food took too long and I could swear they had forgotten about us ...
What did he do? NOTHING!!! He never came back!, never apologized, never comp'd us anything.

I've never had that happen anywhere. 

I wasn't looking for a free meal, I was looking for them to show that they wanted me to come back.  Apparently they didn't."}
{"text":"All pastries are made in-house, they have vegan selections and offer many other full-flavor foods! I like the modern and open atmosphere. The staff is friendly and the food fresh with lots of taste! I recommend the fish tacos and sweet potato fries."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. Waiter walked past us several times without even acknowledging us. Placed our order and waited over 15-20 min and still no coffee or place settings. He even refilled coffee at the table next to us without even noticing. Delivered checks to the other table next to us without saying anything to us. Told him that we were leaving since we had no service from him and no apology. Never coming back."}
{"text":"On a fairly slow evening had poor service and cold food... Not impressed and don't plan on trying it again."}
{"text":"Sweet Melissa's is my go to lunch spot in Rocky River.  The goat cheese salad is to die for!  I've yet to have something here I didn't love.  The fried green tomatoes are delicious, I had a crab cake salad on special once that should permanently be on the menu.
If you get any kind of sandwich that has bacon on it, be prepared that it will be a mountain of bacon.
My mom raves about the Buffalo Chicken wrap.
They have a dessert case full of chocolate covered everything, cakes and tarts which I avoid at all costs but looks fantastic."}
{"text":"Great food but every time I go there the service is consistently awful! Every time I see a friend or family member they say the same thing. Waters & refills always take forever if you even get one. My most recent visit was having to ask that my meal be taken off my bill after the bottom of my pint glass completely fell off and my Diet Coke went all over my flat bread. Of course my server didn't notice or come over so I had to go get someone to give us more napkins to clean it up. I don't understand why the service has never improved over the years here."}
{"text":"Yesterday, I had the lobster bisque and the goat cheese salad. Both were excellent. I've also had the grilled cheese with fried green tomatoes, which is incredible. I drank the Arnold Palmer, sweet and tart with real lemonade, and had a sublime blueberry mini pie. I also love the bottle of chilled water on the tables. This has now become my favorite restaurant on the westside, with their innovative and fun food. I was never a fan of Max's except for the desserts, so I don't have a bias against this taking over the space. This is not a deli, and I'm glad for that."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch and stood at the hostess desk for a good 6 minutes without one single employee acknowledging us before we walked out. Ridiculous. Won't be going back."}

{"text":"The food was good. However, I ordered a coffee and the glass they gave me had lipstick around the rim...very unappetizing. I noticed the lipstick after I drank half the cup. The service was not very good... we felt very rushed. I felt as if they should of done more than just not charge me for the coffee. Annie"}
{"text":"I decided to take a chance on a less-than-five-star rated spot, and I am glad I did! This place is fantastic. Their menu absolutely rocks, brunch in particular had me wanting to sing about it. The decor is unique; somehow, they manage to make modern and industrial feel warm and cozy. Staff is super-friendly, too! And this was on a Saturday morning, people. I got my food VERY fast. Impressive!"}
{"text":"Food was decent. Was not aloud to get dressing on the side for salads. Excuse was because management says not aloud. Was told the dressing will be light on the salad but it wasn't at all.  Didn't get our waters refilled till the very end of our dinner when the plates were cleared. Was told to go to the dessert display to see what they have in stock. Servers should just tell us what they currently have as desserts. I was a server for many years and know this is not how you treat your customers."}
{"text":"We too were excited about a new restaurant opening that wasn't your typical chain. Our experience was pretty disappointing.  Our waitress was less than attentive and appeared to be spread pretty thin in the dining room. The best part of the meal had to be the chopped salad.  The wait for the entrees was pretty long.  One of us ordered the fish tacos and the execution of that dish was poor.  The fish was dripping and the tacos were soggy.  A fork and knife should not be needed to eat tacos. We also ordered the shrimp and lobster rolls and once again , execution was poor. The bread was soggy and overdressed with cabbage. This too was not manageable and required fork and knife.  The waitress failed to check back with us as we received our meals. The atmosphere seemed chaotic as the Manager expedited food, bussed tables and served food. The experience just felt like amateur hour. This is odd because it is not the restaurant's first rodeo in the business.  This restaurant will either prosper of fail depending on the quality of its staffing.  I will look for other experience reviews in the upcoming months to see if we return to this establishment."}
{"text":"Such hype! I don't get it! We tried it one day for brunch due to the fact it always seemed packed when we drove by but:
Rude hostess
Super slow service, blah attitude
45 min wait
Crappy table by a service station
Didn't have the food I asked for and what I did get wasn't worth the $
Overall sad, had higher expectations"}
{"text":"I am a fan of Sweet Melissa's don't get me wrong. I think that they do most of their things very well. However there have been the odd things here and there that I would not order again; not because the presentation was bad or that the service was poor (for the record the place is always clean, the servers are always polite, knowledgeable and have gone out of their way to accommodate). Some of the dishes have been missing that \"something\" that would have kept from ordering it again and again; for instance, their veggie burger wasn't bad, it was just \"meh\". I am a HUGE fan of their roasted Brussel sprouts and they have a wine and drink menu that is awesome. As far as entrees go, I stick with the pasta or salad because I have ordered those multiple times now and they've always been very good. In addition their desserts are all drool inducing so that makes up for the sometimes bland and infrequent misses on their entrees."}
{"text":"Food isn't consistent.  Service is TERRIBLE.  Hostesses are snotty for no reason. The dessert case looks like crap....

Way overpriced.  

Never again."}
{"text":"Had dinner here with a few friends recently, and the food was great and so was the atmosphere! I will definitely go back to visit!"}
{"text":"Best eggplant Parmesan we ever had. Good quick service. Good value fresh food. We had the meatloaf shrimp risotto, and crabcakes. The dessert case looks great. Extensive wine and ale list."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place.  I really, truly do.  I live across the street, so I've been here countless times and every time I hope for a fun, great time.  Not so much.  The food, in my opinion, is just alright.  I've never eaten anything here that I think about later, craving a return trip.  A lot of people I've spoken with think of this place as a dessert place.  Again, not so much.  The desert case is similar to your little corner bakery.  Cheesecakes, tortes, and cannolis, but usually nothing I get super excited about.  Maybe I'm missing something.

My least favorite element about this place is the service.  It's slow and inattentive--even sitting at the bar.  I've been here in the double digits and have yet to have good service.  That's a bummer.

That said, it's not a complete bust.  In my opinion, the best way to eat here is to sit at the bar during happy hour, munching on $3 plates.  You can get a decent burger, fish tacos, and a few other dishes for an excellent price.  It's the best value in terms of their food.  They do have a pretty tasty martini list as well."}
{"text":"I've been to this location a few times, and it's other location in Rocky River. This one is not nearly as nice. The wait staff is OK. Polite, but not always attentive. The food is more of the issue for me. The west side location always had great meals. This location has yet to serve anything half as good."}
{"text":"Delicious....Delicious....Delicious!! Met a friend from grad school for dinner. Started with the Four Dip appetizer then I ordered the Pulled Chicken Risotto with butternut squash, bacon and cheese. Quite possibly one of the best dinners I've eaten in a very long time!! We will be back to try brunch!! YUM!!"}
{"text":"Food is decent, service is so-so. I mostly go for brunch and it always is slow and often miss something. But the scone and fruit appitizer is adorable!"}
{"text":"One of my all time favorites.

Their happy hour is unmatched - for drinks and appetizers.  Their salads are incredible - particularly the blackened crab cake salad.

Olivia, the server, is wonderful."}
{"text":"Lost my appetite after seeing a 2 inch cockroach in the women's restroom."}
{"text":"Everything is great and fresh here! I usually go for brunch on the weekends but I had a lunch date here with my mom and it was fantastic! Ahi tuna bowl is a must get especially if you like a spicy kick!"}
{"text":"The entrance to this restaurant is more difficult to discern as there is no clear sign on the front of the door. The wait staff seemed disinterested and we had to flag our waitress down. I ordered the chicken carbonara, which was a disappointment. For being in a sauce, the chicken was dry, bacon undercooked, and the noodles were swimming in the sauce. I would not recommend this meal to anyone."}
{"text":"The food is DELICIOUS but go on a night when you have nothing else to do. We went on a Tuesday evening when there were very few other people and our service took forever. Very nice waitress, but she seemed to be distracted by whatever was behind the bar. It took forever to get our check. That being said, the options are unique and very tasty--worth checking out as long as you have some time to spare!"}
{"text":"THEY DIDN'T EVEN TRY TO MAKE IT RIGHT.
The quality and creativity have greatly declined. Went there for breakfast, and I sent the fruit cup back asking the server if she would please tell the kitchen or manager that if they wouldn't eat it then they shouldn't serve it. It contained, not much, but among three fruit varieties a couple strawberry pieces that were old or expired (and one grape and a couple pieces of hard cantaloupe). I was not offered a fresh serving, and then had to follow through twice with the server to get any feedback at all (me: what did the kitchen say? Her:  The fruit was cut this morning and got \"oxiginated.\" Oxidized? Really? Like iron does?) Next I was told that the manager went to GFS but that a photo of the offending fruit was sent to her.) I have a problem with the \"Southwest omelette\" presentation, too, but that's a whole other complaint"}
{"text":"Went in on a Monday, three of us ordered a medley of appetizers. (Their portions are known to be enormous, so we figured order a little light, and try more things). The server made a comment, that all we got was appetizers. Then he brought the food and had forgotten the calimari---no big whoop, but he walked away without giving us any utensils. By the time he did come back, and one of us politely asked for utensils, he also copped an attitude. My husband ordered mushroom quesadillas, which for an app was very generous, portion-wise. However, when he took a bite the ingredients inside the pita were cold--not like lukewarm, but cold. My fried green tomatoes were hard as rocks, buried under a breading so thick you might caulk your bathroom tiles with it. The calimari was gigantic, and very good. My husbands lobster bisque....he filled his spoon with some of the soup and told me to look....he said, \"you see those chunks? You might think it was chunks of lobster, but its actually flour.\" My sister in law barely touched her salad, and gave me no specific reason for this, just said it was unappetizing. A woman came by often to refill our drinks and water glasses and was very polite, and told us the calimari would not be on the bill, so she really satisfied the customer-service end and made up for her co-worker, but a cook should take more pride. The quesadillas should have been delicious and to not thoroughly heat such a simple item is truly a pity. I guess I would not plan on a return visit."}
{"text":"I expected a more enjoyable experience at this restaurant. The atmosphere was good. The service was extremely slow even at 6:30 on a Saturday night. The meatloaf was horrible with a bland taste. The chicken carbonara dish was just ok. I was hoping for a better dessert but the brownie cheesecake was sort of bla"}
{"text":"Took myself and my three sons here yesterday for dinner around 6:30. There was not a typical host, basically the servers seated people which worked out ok. They were a tad busy but not overwhelming. I order the \"Brick Chicken\" : The chicken was cooked well and not dry, had a bit too much of the butter herb season but still tasty. The mac n cheese was the biggest disappointment which it tasted like frozen Stouffer's exactly and the green beans we too buttery. I am glad I tried is as I was interested in it;however, I have had better and even more so at $14. One of my sons had the bacon wrapped meatloaf which was by the best meal of all four purchased. The garlic spinach was delicious and the flavors all worked well together. The kids menu is nice and large with plenty of variety and priced just right which included the meal, one side, drink, and dessert. My other son had the burger which was good but nothing special, simple burger priced at $11 bucks. Overall not so bad not so good! The mac N cheese was by far not homemade and nothing special. May try lunch there again, otherwise, there are so many other places I would rather attend for dinner in the area."}
{"text":"I've been to this location a couple times before tonight and the service was always mediocre at best and the food was just okay. However, I didn't protest going there for dinner tonight with my boyfriend and that was a huge mistake! Our waitress was never around and when she was she seemed annoyed and disinterested. It was Taco Tuesday so we ordered two tacos as an appetizer and both of our tacos were missing 3 of the 5 ingredients! The waitress just brought the missing ingredients out on the side and we made our own tacos instead of getting them prepared again. We were willing to let everything go and just continue on with our dinner until I found not one, but two, hairs in my burger. The manager apologized for the hair in my food and comped our meal but didn't really have anything to say about our taco situation or about the service. This was definitely my last time at sweet melissa."}
{"text":"I ordered the baked eggplant which was fabulous. A friend of mine ordered the brussel sprouts as an appetizer which I loved! Even my boyfriend, who doesn't like brussel sprouts was very very impressed with it and loved the Thai sauce it came with. 

Great atmosphere, great good, and good service. I would definitely recommend it. If you're a Creme brûlée fan, you definitely have to try it here. It's honestly some of the best Creme brûlée I've ever had!"}
{"text":"My Roasted Mushroom salad was fabulous.  I mistakenly added grilled chicken which was extremely dry and unseasoned.  The rest of the meal was not worth the cost.  Our server was great with our kids.  He was prompt and kind.  We only waited 5 minutes to sit on a Saturday night and honestly, there were tables open that just needed to be bused.  I've been here many times and we always find something that we like and items that are just average.  Avoid the lobster bisque... tasted like the ocean and had no pieces of lobster in it."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good. Acoustics are terrible. Usually just too crowded with loud people and kids to be enjoyable."}
{"text":"Oh - where to begin! I so badly wanted to like it here, I am a huge fan of the Rocky River location. The whole experience was not good from the start. We came with a table of 5. Everyone ordered either a mimosa, Bloody Mary or an Irish coffee. The waitress took our drink order and came back to tell us that the owner decided they will not sell alcohol there on Sundays. Not only was this  something she should have known before she took our order, but mostly, it was just a bummer. When she allowed an Irish Coffee to be switched out for a mimosa, we were under the impression that only liquor was not being served. She never brought any mimosas to the table or followed up that these wouldn't be served either. When the food was served, one of my friends received the wrong dish altogether. While they comped the meal and re-made it, she had to sit the entire time with no food and ended up taking it to go. Overall, the food was mediocre. Most of all - just bad service. Interesting, as we walked out we witnessed a fight between a customer and an irate waitress. Maybe this place just needs to iron out the kinks because it is new. I will continue to frequent the Rocky Ricer location."}
{"text":"The food was outstanding!  I've been hearing so much about the Rocky River location and was very excited to find out about the University Heights opening.  Today a group from the office tried it out for lunch.  Our server was being trained, so the service was a tad slow.   But who hasn't been new at a job.  If you are impatient or in a rush, wait a few weeks.  But do not pass it up, I assure you the wait is worth it!"}
{"text":"Please, spend your money elsewhere. The staff reeks of thinking they are upscale when the menu is beyond atrocious. Consider this your warning, horrible food and a horrible staff."}
{"text":"Sweet Melissas is one of my favorite places to eat, and is my first choice for Sunday brunch. However today the service was so bad we got up and left. First off, the hostess said we should anticipate a 10 minute wait, ok no big deal. After being seated in about 15 minutes we noticed several other tables already had their food prior to my party even being asked for our drink orders. We continued to wait another 20 minutes for our server to arrive, but alas, they never did. Perhaps somewhere out there they are still searching for us...

While the food is incredible don't waste your time; the service is terrible."}
{"text":"I've had both breakfast and lunch here and both were fantastic! The service can be hit or miss but the food is always consistently good. I love the buttermilk pancakes... ask for the cinnamon butter because it's the best!"}
{"text":"We waited 20 minutes to be seated (which, being a Saturday night, was expected). Another 5 minutes for drinks, at which the server/bartender rushed off to make. No problems there! Drinks were fantastic  (I got the bellini-delish, although small). Waited another 15 minutes to get our order taken.. ok, again, it's Saturday night! Waited for food... appetizer of calamari came out lukewarm and disappointing. Salad was EXCELLENT, but then, it's damn near impossible to mess up a salad. Dinner arrived 5 minutes after to long awaited appetizers, and again, lukewarm. I sent back the calamari and my chicken carbonara and enjoyed my salad and my drink... I didn't want to risk waiting for a disappointing replacement. Ended up at Fridays! My food was hot there."}
{"text":"Sorry but the cupcakes in the display case must have truly been for display only....they were clearly several days old, even the frosting was hard."}
{"text":"Probably one of the worst dining experiences we have had in quite a long time.
Our party of four visited Melissa (formerly Sweet Melissa's) on a Tuesday evening. While it was prime dining time the place was virtually empty. Granted it was a Tuesday, but the Burntwood across the street looked to be pretty busy.
The waiter was great and really the only positive thing we could say. All of our food was badly presented and had a certain \"who gives a darn\" look to it. Fish tacos on a sandwich plate with a small handful of potato chips. Chicken risotto in a big lonely bowl. Hamburger and fries on a simple plate with nothing to go along. It felt very much like cafeteria food. The \"brick chicken\" sounded wonderful but all it amounted to was a shabby grilled chicken breast, green beans, and a small portion of (cold) mac and cheese. The bill was $88 (including some drinks). No way even close to worth it.
We used to enjoy dining here but having had this sort of thing happen twice now we are through."}
{"text":"Had a great brunch (the bagel with a fried green tomato), but the service is so slow."}
{"text":"Tried Sweet Melissa last weekend for a late lunch.  Had the mac and cheese which was beyond delicious as well as the butternut squash side, also delicious.  My daughter had Mediterranean pasta which she really enjoyed.  We sat outside on the patio and had excellent service.  Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times since moving to the west side and it never disappoints. Brunch is really great, some of the selections don't seem like they would be filling, but they are! Just went for lunch yesterday and the chicken bowl was amazing. Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Menu is a nice selection of comfort food - vegetarian and traditional selections and all sound delish. Prices are pretty reasonable. I had the acorn squash filled w black eyes peas, quinoa & dried cranberries dinner and it was very good and satisfying but could've handled a bit more seasoning. Hubby had a burger that came w some chips and said it was better than most. We will be back."}
{"text":"8/18/17, 9am. Great waitress, very responsive. However the chef could not figure out how to cook my eggs. I asked for them medium, they were over done on the outside and under done on the inside. Obviously the flame was too high. The waitress was helpful in getting the eggs redone. Unfortunately the second time around they were burned on the outside and slightly overcooked on the inside. Again the flame was too high. I shared my comments with the waitress, she was receptive and open to them. I hope that corrective action will be taken with the chef."}
{"text":"Max's was my one of my favorite restaurants and when it closed, I was upset!  But it being replaced with Sweet Melissa's has made it all better.  The food is awesome!  We love the brussel sprouts.  I love the salad selection.  My boyfriend is obsessed with the pad thai.  We have been for brunch also and its awesome!!!  You get fruit and scones along with your meal.  The desserts are to die for!!!!  Sitting near the dessert case is like torture..."}
{"text":"We ordered Sweet Melissa via a delivery service, and my pescatarian grandson ordered the crabcake burger. Imagine his surprise when he received a bacon Angus burger!  Not only could he not eat the burger, he also chose not to eat the soggy undercooked fries that came with it.  My daughter-in-law ordered the \"baked\" eggplant which was so greasy it could only have been deep-fried.  It was also chewy and difficult to cut.  When we called to ask for a refund for the burger, the restaurant offered a replacement... an hour after the rest of the family had eaten and blamed the delivery service.  The service had delivered our order perfectly and promptly, they had simply delivered the wrong thing, given to them by the restaurant! We will not be eating at Sweet Melissa again."}
{"text":"Good food, service, value. Crab cakes were excellent. Saw some yummy desserts but didn't try any. Will definitely do so next time."}
{"text":"The place itself: 4.5
Personnel and service: 5
Coffee: 2.5, bitter and watery
Bloody Mary: 3, nothing special at all
Food: 3 to 4, good looking but not very tasty

Inconsistent on food and coffee across the table of six."}
{"text":"I love coming to Sweet Melissa's for dinner. Their food is always fresh and tasty at that. Good size portions although my boyfriend could disagree since he's a bottomless pit. However, I've always had good service, the decor is great love the industrial loft vibe. I highly recommend the brick chicken and their desserts are fabulous!"}
{"text":"I made a huge mistake today. I ordered the tofu scramble from Sweet Melissa off of their weekend brunch menu. What a disappointment! Obviously the chef has no idea at all how to make tofu flavorful. All he/she did for this dish  was cut it into chunks, deep fry it, put it in a sauté  pan LOADED with olive oil and a few veggies, salt and pepper and sauté them together for a minute. ( I am vegan so I asked for the cheese to be left off this dish)  I make Tofu scramble at home all the time.. I use at least 8 spices and herbs to give the main component of the dish (tofu) flavor..  (my stomach was upset all afternoon from the copious amount of oil too..) Now that I think of it they never flavor the tofu in the tofu Thai Fry either.. maybe Education is what the chef needs... Thank Goodness there are so many great places to eat GOOD vegan food  around now."}
{"text":"So.... It was good- giant portion of Ahi on my sandwich as well as my girlfriends salad- thick cut!!!! Not sure how they are making money on it but I don't care. Filthy table which was gross but everything else was really good- I will be back"}
{"text":"Let me first say that my 3 star review is not because of their food. I actually very much enjoy their diverse menu. The butternut squash salad is literally my favorite and their sweet potato fries are delish! My issue is with their service, or lack there of. We've been here numerous times and every single time our service is TERRIBLE. We stopped in for lunch on a Sunday and there were maybe a handful of people in there. The hostess sat us and we wait for a good 15 minutes before we had to get up and ask one of the many waiters who were standing around chatting to grab us waters. Finally someone stopped over and we were pretty certain we werent even sat in her section (thanks for picking up the extra table btw). I wish I could say this was out of the norm but every time we stop in here its always  similar. The manager here needs to revisit training, or hire people who care about their jobs."}
{"text":"I love love love Sweet Melissa. I cannot say enough good things about this restaurant. I have been there for brunch, and it is delicious. I have been there for dinner, and it is delicious. They have the best dessert (try the lemon cake). My favorite thing about Sweet Melissa it's happy. 3 to 9, in the bar only. $4 wine, and $3 and $2 beer with an array of appetizers for $2, $3, $4 and $5. My boyfriend and I will go, sit at the bar, and just order a bunch of different appetizers and split them all. There is a limit of 3 appetizers per drink you order, but that is not a big deal. You can get full on 6 appetizers, or you can just order more drinks! Try the brussel sprouts though (my boyfriend was not a fan of brussel sprouts, and he loves the ones at Sweet Melissa), and the spinach/artichoke dip is delicious."}
{"text":"Still have the best breakfast potato around!  I will also add that this place is more child friendly than most I've tried.  The kids meals are well priced and with large portions, and automatically come with fruit too, which is nice because then your kid can't opt out and might end up eating a few bites."}
{"text":"Service was great and the risotto is amazing! Will definitely visit again. Very family friendly as well with awesome kids menu."}
{"text":"Jamie was very pleasant for being understaffed at noon on a Sunday. You could tell she was overwhelmed but didnt take it out on her customers. If we go back we will request her section. We sat in bar area after a 15 minute wait. Not Bad :)

{"text":"Terrible service. Won't go back and I'm a local. Sat at the bar for a late lunch. Was not greeted had to request a menu and specials. The woman who took my drink request was sullen and unfriendly. She seemed to take the world on her shoulders doing everything from kitchen work to bar work. She never smiled and turned me over to a young man who was helpful but you could tell he was uncomfortable in his role. This woman is BAD for business. She rules the roost and sets an uncomfortable atmosphere to either eat or work in. Passive aggressiveness is intolerable in a restaurant. I requested my order to go because of it. Again, won't be back."}
{"text":"Sweet Melissa is one of my favorite restaurants ever. I go there all the time and have never once had a poor experience. As a vegetarian, I am thrilled with the plethora of creative options at this place. I bring friends and family here whenever I want to really \"wow\" them with something delicious and unique.

My absolute favorite dishes are the baked eggplant (my boyfriend, who \"hates\" eggplant, can't leave my plate alone when I order it,) the pumpkin sage gnocchi, and the sweet potato fries (which are served with an addictive creamy horseradish sauce.) Their desserts are as delicious as they are attractive and there is plenty to choose from. I have never had a companion rate their plate as anything lower than \"amazing\" when we've gone.

They also have a bar, at which I've never sat, but I appreciate their craft beer menu (and wines, if that's more to your taste.) The place has lovely ambiance and the decor is simple and attractive. The staff have always been friendly and knowledgable.

Tip: don't go here for a first date. The food is so awesome, you'll be too busy enjoying it to talk to each other!"}
{"text":"We went to Sweet Melissa's this morning for brunch. We have been to this location many times (20+) since they opened as the food is delicious, and the kid's menu is awesome! Unfortunately the service is inconsistent-very hit or miss. If you are the type of person that demands good customer service you may be disappointed."}
{"text":"This was a great experience! First time at (Sweet) Melissa's. I'd heard mixed reviews. Everything was great. I loved the layout and the space. Kid-friendly, with lights and a shiny ceiling = perfect for Lorelei. 

It was hard to choose what to eat because everything sounded great. I opted for the Sedona Cobb salad, which had beef tenderloin strips, romaine, avocado, corn, black beans, shredded cheddar and tortilla strips in a chipotle vinaigrette. HOLY cow, could have been the best salad of my life. Definitely in top 5. It came with a scone (cranberry white chocolate) that was soooo good. It was even better than the scones at Civilization, and I never say that because I am obsessed with the Civ's scones.

Derek enjoyed his fish tacos, but was REALLY disappointed in his cannoli. He said they \"got it all wrong, from the filling to the shell.\" The man knows his cannolis, so I'm not gonna argue with him. I hate cannolis myself, so it didn't matter too much to me.

Service was beautiful -- no problems! Everything was perfect there.

This is such a place to take your mom when she comes to town. In fact, I'm going to take my mom here next time she comes."}
{"text":"Good food, healthy choices for both adults and kids.  Sometimes service is slow.  They will get the 4th star back once they get the Tuna Niçoise salad back on the menu!"}
{"text":"This place never fails. Their menu has so many options for both lunch and dinner and their happy hour is from 3-9pm at the bar. I have never had the same thing twice and I have never had an item I didn't like. This is a great place for big groups during lunch because it is not too crowded. They also have a great kids menu.

Make sure to check out their homemade pastries which are absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"I originally planned on giving this place 5 stars, but a couple of disappointments that festered in my brain caused a loss of a star.

But, before I get to the disappointments, I'll address the service/waitstaff, which seems to be a problem for most. I don't think this place is aiming to give you a rushed, quick or what most would call efficient feeling when it comes to their service. It was in no way disappointing to me because I wasn't collapsing in the booth, waiting for more water or just dying to tell my server (with a full mouth, of course, because that's the only time they ask) that everything is just fine and she walked over here for nothing.  

I had the grilled cheese and spinach salad, which were both pretty tasty, though I'm still worrying about my oncoming heart attack caused by the pound of bacon stacked on my sandwich.  The salad was super oily; it tasted good and the dressing was delicious, but mostly oil and there was a lot of it, so as the artichoke hearts slipped down my throat, lubed by this greasy dressing, my tongue was happy, but my digestive system was screaming, \"NOOOO, please NOOOO!\". That was one reason for the star downgrade. Which brings me to the other two:

Pricing. For what this is, the prices aren't great, except for the salads. Maybe it's because my sandwich was totally replicable and nothing about the experience made it worth it (Melt, for example, is in theory replicable, but I will pay the price for their sandwiches because it is an experience). The final straw for my downgrade was reheatability, which I should have seen coming with all of that bacon. After some more time in the oven for some heat and crisp, my sandwich oozed grease and the bacon slithered off in a goopy mess. Perhaps this is nitpicky, but I rarely leave a restaurant without leftovers, so I get a little critical when it comes to my lunch the next day.

Overall, I enjoyed this place and I learned what to avoid, so next time will be 5 stars!"}
{"text":"We stopped for a drink and lunch before a show. . Chips and 4 dips for appetizer. .tasty! We had to order a second cup of chips so as to not leave any of the delicious dips. 

My husband had fish tacos...  A little strong on the onions.  I had the wild mushroom fritatta.  Would have enjoyed more wild mushroom to ricotta ratio.  A bit bland.

Great beer choices! 

Gary, our waiter, was awesome!!"}
{"text":"I go there for the desserts. Best triple chocolate cake ever!! However you should get it on Thursday or Friday when the cake is still fresh. What I don't like about this place... too noisy!"}
{"text":"Sweet Melissa is good (good enough?). I've been here several times in the last few months and it's consistent and decent. I'm not blown away by the food that arrives at the table, but I do like the variety of the menu. 

I came here more often when this place was Max's Deli and I was always impressed by the food at that time. I returned several times after it become Sweet Melissa but was never so delighted with my meal (or the desserts) that I wanted to or needed to return. Now I have a meal here if someone else wants to go here, and that's how I've ended up here recently. 

Service is so so. Parking is easy. Shops nearby."}
{"text":"Usually I get take-out from her but I've gone to lunch a few times.  This time we had a couple small children (4 years old) and I've was very unimpressed with the service.  Our food was absolutely delicious but the service was terrible.  So personally, I recommend just getting take-out. Overall, I rate this place a 3.5 out of 5 stars."}
{"text":"This place should be called SWEET JESUS, not Sweet Melissa because I proclaimed SWEET JESUS when I bit into the mini apple tart.  Wow, it was seriously the yummiest apple-tasting delight I've had in a long time.  We also got a S'Mores tart but the apple was far superior.  I haven't eaten lunch or dinner here yet but I will.  The interior is modern chic and the food looks really good."}
{"text":"They have super yummy hand cut fries. I am a huge fan of their roasted veggie chili too. It is a bit pricier than an average deli, but the ingredients seem fresh and the atmosphere is fun and light hearted. This place is a perfect spot for friends of any age to meet for a casual lunch or brunch. I think I might take my parents there the next time they are in town. Although, I think the sandwiches would be too big for my grandpa to handle!"}
{"text":"This is my wife's favorite restaurant and for simpler fare I enjoy it too.  We have been here 25 plus times and I can say I really like it.  

All of the soups and side salads are fresh and delicious.  The chopped and the apple are my favorites. The lobster bisque is incredibly flavorful for not having chunks of lobster in it.  It comes with a little crostini. Good stuff.  

Have had the pulled chicken risotto and the pot pie. Good homey dishes. Nothing unbelievable about them but very tasty. The bacon wrapped meatloaf is perfect for a cold winters eve.  

My two favorites here are the Sedona Cobb, which is a tenderloin Cobb salad with fried avocado.  The dressing on it is perfect.  It is a great combination of light and rich.  Love it. The other is the pistachio crusted white fish with mango slaw.  Crunchy and flaky. It comes over roasted butternut squash, which is a little too sweet with the mango too IMO but the buyer they use to cook the squash is nice for the fish. I would rather have a regular mash with some butter myself. 

I don't love the desserts here. I mean, they are good, but you have Mitchell's three blocks away and Great Scott's a mile te other way.  

Also, I love the bar staff and the mango ice tea is delicious."}
{"text":"The restaurant really needs to upgrade its storefront; I have driven by Sweet Melissa dozens of times not knowing what it was. It was not until a friend took me there for dinner that I even discovered they sold more then sweets, but once inside you will be pleasantly surprised.  Sweet Melissa offered a extensive menu; everyone will be able to find something they want to try.  I enjoyed the crab cake salad served with fried avocado and a apple cinnamon biscuit.  And while I did not have a slice, my mouth started to watered every time one of the waitstaff walked by with a mammoth, gorgeous looking slice of cakey goodness.

There is ample parking and the dining room is wheelchair-friendly."}
{"text":"Had brunch there and it was really good a little salty but tasty and fresh I had the crab and eggs and my bf had the corned beef hash"}
{"text":"horrible service by server \"mallory\" be aware....food is good but feature omelette very questionable..."}
{"text":"I must admit I am smitten with this place.  Just a heads up, the address and Google will take you to the middle of campus.  They are located in the circle area.

They have great outdoor seating.  The inside is large with great seating, a bar and kitchen in full view.  

The menu did very diverse.  From egg dishes to breakfast wraps, grits, shrimp, corned beef hash and amazing butter milk pancakes.  

The service was top notch.  Very friendly and attentive.

The corned beef hash is a little different with hollandaise sauce.  It was very good.  The kids chocolate chip pancakes were too good.  Top of the line chocolate chips, butter milk pancakes.

I think this could be a great 'usual' spot."}
{"text":"First time st Univ Hts location, been at Rocky River, where white coffee mugs were dirty. First look at menu, cheddar cheese does not belong in anything 'south of border', please get some queso fresca, and flour does not belong in any taco tortilla. Coffee is a Sysco brand that happens to be locally roasted, still tastes like robusto bean folgers. Mini scones should be freshly baked around the hour, not given out of refrigerator. Please allow bacon to sit on or dab off with paper towels, or have paper napkins on table, perhaps seek local butcher vs Sysco. Fried green tomatoes, liked bc I like fried green, BUT need to salt tomato before breading and add 1/8 tsp cayenne to 1 batch of breading for a slight zingy flavor, and apple-cranberry pie tasting fruit compote on top doesn't work. The waffles, they were alright but dry: perhaps some more butter milk or yoghurt in recipe?
Please, I would really love for nothing more than have local businesses succeed. Some speak of Cleveland being the new Portland, but that means one needs to make all food fabulous, not mediocre. Lived in Portland 11years, came home.
Clientele of RR and Univ Hts will pay more for higher quality."}
{"text":"Cute restaurant- nice vegetarian & vegan selections. Good friendly service. The fried brussel sprouts were great- come with sweet chili dipping sauce. The vegetarian lulu sandwich was good but bland came with homemade chips. 

Got the chocolate mousse bomb for dessert which was excellent."}
{"text":"Food was okay.  Matzoh ball was mushy, gnocchi weirdly sweet, even though I left off the cranberries.  Steak tacos were outstanding.  Service was extremely slow at 5 PM, when it wasn't busy."}
{"text":"So sad we went to the unknown closed University Circle restaurant a few minutes ago. Very disappointing. Hope to visit Rocky River soon!!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Menu great!! Did not enjoy the grouper today though. Should be broiled...."}
{"text":"I'm combining my reviews, hence the 3 stars. 2 for a prior visit and 4 for this visit. This review is based on lunch take out. The lady who took my phone order was very patient describing their offerings today so I could figure out what treats to get for my friends. The order was ready on time and payment was handled quickly (not the case for many restaurants that do takeout). The baked eggplant was delicious and made two meals, which I always appreciate. Desserts can be a bit pricey here, but I think you probably get what you pay for. They were large portions and looked fabulous. I will definitely be trying them on my next visit."}
{"text":"The food is decent if you are willing to put up with the wait time and slow service.  Last time we were in we waited a ridiculous amount of time to be seated.  Never got our order taken.  When I asked a waitress if someone could take our order then commented that they seemed busy tonight, she rudely responded by saying, \"Look around!\".  Restaurant was not full at all and there were very few staff on view.  We walked out.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"We have been here for breakfast and it is good , but the service is usually bad. I bought some desserts once, because we loved them when it was Max's Deli. Nope. The cheesecake tasted like flavored  shortening and the chocolate cake was ok. I guess we are spoiled by Joe's."}
{"text":"After a busy day on the east side fighting snow, my wife suggested that we stop here on our way home.  I've had the desserts here many times in the past, so this was my first experience with their meals.  We arrived a bit later in the evening, around 8:30 or so.  Past experiences with eating later in the evening usually aren't kind to me -- normally, the closer you get to closing time, the service degrades exponentially until you're better off getting the food yourself.  I was pleasantly surprised to find my server not only very friendly, but extremely attentive during the service.  We had hot tea to drink, the teas were very aromatic and flavourful, and the waiter kept the hot water coming.  For an Appetiser, we shared an order of the Fried Green Tomatoes -- they were amazing, and the sause and salsa that they served with it really added a layer of sharpness to the dish that I love.

Our salads were exceptional, and dinner itself (I had the pork chop) was pretty amazing.  The deserts were spot-on divine -- and large enough that I needed a box to take the leftover slice of cake home with me.  Great food.  Good Desserts.  Great ambiance for a quiet little shop."}
{"text":"Pretty good food. Not disappointed. Not overly excited either.  Service was slow. Not sure if it was because they were short staffed or if they were trying to figure out who would serve us.  The restaurant wasn't crowded at all.  I got the impression that not many people with darker skin frequent this place. They were rather cold, short, and apprehensive with us.  That's okay I guess.  We ordered matzah ball soup which was yummy and very well seasoned, a dip appetizer and salads and tacos for dinner. Everything was tasty.  The server assumed that the $20 that I left on the $70 tab was our way of breaking up the tab. I'm glad she asked to clarify if that was her tip. It was. She was cool."}
{"text":"First visit and food was delicious.  I had the shrimp and grits and fried green tomatoes.  I would have both again."}
{"text":"Well, it's been a while. And Sweet Melissa's is now Melissa's. It is no improvement. Many staff changes, many menu changes. Many of our favorites gone. New staff was semi-attentive. Meals were not as good. Salads were stingy on the dressings. Fried Chicken topping was cooler-cold and tasteless. 
Reason we won't be back...my wife found a cockroach in the restroom."}
{"text":"I went there as a party of five last night (6/29) and it was an overall decent experience, FYI-they do not serve alcohol.  
  They deposited scones and lemon/strawberry muffins in lieu of the typical bread.  The scones were very sweet, described by one as similar to fruit loops, and the muffins were decent.  
  I shared the Portobello Quesadilla and it was the best thing I ordered there.    Cooked well, great ingredients and terrific taste.  
I also had \"The Chuck\" hamburger.  I had been craving a decent cheeseburger all week and unfortunately, this one fell short.  It was made from Angus beef but the burger was rather bland and one other person felt it had a bizarre texture.  
  The presentation of all the meals, mostly sandwiches, was impressive with the artisan bread from Breadsmith, mixed greens and enormous half-pickles sliced lengthwise skewered on top of the sandwiches.  The fresh-cut french fries were also good but a non-cloth basket would have been nice so that we could have added some vinegar to the fries.  
  Finally, we took a slice of tiramisu home.  It was above average but not spectacular.  
  Ultimately, the portions are large, the food is good, the decor is great, and the price is perhaps above average, (~$37 for 1 quesadilla, 2 chuck burgers, 1 fries and slice of tiramisu).  If you desire a place that uses organic ingredients and non-hormonal meat and prefer food prepared on premises, Sweet Melissa's prides itself on those aspects of its business.  
  I'd likely go again and try some of the other options."}
{"text":"This place is the best. The food is unconventional yet tasty, and the desserts are scrumptious!"}
{"text":"Sweet Melissa's rating average rating deserves at least 4.5. We just had a wonderful meal with spicy fried Brussels sprouts matzah ball soup and pecan crusted grouper. The service was friendly and prompt. The food was superb. I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"The food is always terrific but the service is slow. I don't know if they are under staffed or under trained but either way, you can expect great food with slow service."}
{"text":"I just feel so meh about Sweet Melissa's.  It's kind of a place that makes me angry it exists because it doesn't know what it wants to be.  I've dined in many times and I always leaves thinking \"why did I come here?\"  I think I just want to like it so bad because they have a lot of vegetarian options and a pretty dessert case.

My last experience was definitely my last though.  They fucked up tacos.  Which is just rude rude rude. 

First don't have tacos on your menu.  Just don't.  We have too many mediocre taco places in this town.  (I'm looking at you, Barrio). And if you must have them on your menu they better be impressive and delicious and reasonably priced.  

Get out of my life, Sweet Melissa!
Actually, the entire city of Rocky Rive can fall off the face of the planet as well.

Thank you and good day."}
{"text":"I don't just give out fives. I'm not a democrat! Vote Bernie!! Anywho this place is sweet!!!! Pun intended. The biggest \"fleh\" oops, sorry, \"flaw\",  lil mispronounced there, anyway, is there is not much to comment on. Great. What am I gonna talk    About? The weather?

Anyway I came here w a dime piece which I highly recommend! Pretty good food here too :)))))
YELP."}
{"text":"I was here Friday night and was very disappointed. The mashed potatoes were just okay (need cream), though the meatloaf was good. What really got me, though, was how awful the cupcake was. The cake itself was stale. It was like they put fresh icing on a week old cupcake. And I took it to go, so short of driving all the way back, there was not much I could do about it. Not at all what I was expecting from a place called Sweet Melissa."}
{"text":"Every time I come here, the food is fresh and it's just quality! Came here because my co-workers raved about the restaurant, and it's all with good reason. I wish every restaurant could be such great quality for the food. Reading from the reviews, customer service has been an issue for me once but the other times it's been great! I would give a lower rating but the food really makes me forget about having to track down a waitress for something. 

I've tried the chicken tacos, and the chicken pot pie. I highly suggest the chicken pot pie, the crust is fresh and the ingredients inside are hearty and wholesome. Will come back again!"}
{"text":"\"Just give me all the bacon and eggs you have... Wait!  I worry what you just heard was 'Give me a lot of bacon and eggs'.  What I said was \"Give me all the bacon and eggs you have\".  Do you understand?\"  - Ron Swanson

sweet melissa has bacon n eggs.  It's not the bacon n eggs you'd expect:  eggs benedict, Canadian bacon, and fried green tomatoes.  So Ron Swanson may hate it, seeing it as the antithesis to good ol' American food.  But I found it to be quite enjoyable.  The Fried Green Tomatoes were exccellent, and the eggs and bacon were also quite good.  

sweet melissa also had giant coffee cups, a major plus in any situation.  This, coupled with the nice free fruit cup/mini scone, made for a wonderful breakfast.

The atmosphere is also quite nice, making the entire experience just perfect."}
{"text":"Overall, an excellent restaurant with a really unique menu and great vibe! 

About the only downside is that it's a bit pricey. I have also had one or two things there that did not blow me away - but they weren't bad, by any means. Just nothing stellar. 

Most of the food, however, is awesome! I've gone for brunch and dinner - loved both! There's a good beer selection and some awesome desserts (if you can save room). The whole menu is just really great, in my opinion. It's so different from what you normally see and everything is usually really flavorful. They are also GREAT at presentation. The plates and the restaurant itself are beautiful. 

Basically the only reason it's not 5 stars for me is that I wish it was a bit cheaper and I have had a few things that weren't very interesting. However, it's one of my favorite places in Rocky River and almost everyone I have taken here loved it."}
{"text":"Sweet Melissa's opened recently in the Max's Deli space in Rocky River. We ordered the BLT, the turkey club, bowl of matzo ball soup, fries, and tiramisu. Bill was around $35 for two.

The downside: Just a few kinks that need to be ironed out, most likely due to the fact that the place is newly opened. Tables are quite small for two people -- we were pressed for room. Sandwiches very very delicious, but come uncut -- hard to manage. Soups should arrive prior to the sandwich. Everything came at once, and there was no room on the table! 

The upside: Enjoyed mostly everything we ordered, Cute decor much improved from Max's Deli, big bottle of complimentary water for the table (we went through two!), large portion sizes and menu with just about anything that you could want, close to where I live, complimentary bread/muffin basket, environmentally friendly policies. 

Overall this is a cool place. A little more expensive than Maxi's Deli, but definitely has a more updated feel."}
{"text":"So greasy & rich. Refuse to substitute anything, because they are basically mass producing the same sides in the back for everyone.  I guess you're paying more for the atmosphere?  Blah."}
{"text":"I have been going to Sweet Melissa in Rocky River for probably about the past six years and I am finally getting around to do it justice with a solid review. 

Sweet Melissa is always enjoyable. The food is fresh. The atmosphere is comfortable and the menu is occassionally rotated. Brunch on Sunday's is also fantastic. There is also a dessert counter with cheesecake, tarts, torts, cupcakes, chocolates, etc. which is very cute. Although the last time my wife and I ordered the cheesecake it tasted kind of \"old and funky\" - it was the Oreo cheesecake and it was more than slightly disappointing, so we didn't eat even half of it. 

I would love to see some more custom cocktails on the menu promoted or some more specials. That's really what is missing. No really Happy Hour or drink specials from what I see 90% of the time. If there are, I'm not aware of it. 

Everything on the menu is honestly great. Try it."}
{"text":"Excellent food and presentation. Room was a bit loud and our mature server was very rude.  My 88 year old dad was visiting and I was a little embarrassed."}
{"text":"I couldn't NOT go to a place that has my name in it! Unfortunately, it didn't really live up to my expectations. 

On a Sunday morning, my boyfriend and I headed to Sweet Melissa's for some breakfast. We had already stopped at another breakfast joint where the wait was 45 minutes. When we walked into Sweet Melissa's there were only around 3 or 4 tables. No wait, which was great! But what breakfast place isn't packed on a Sunday morning? 

We sat immediately, but our server was VERY slow. For it not being busy, that is one of my biggest pet peeves. We waited about 5 minutes before she even stopped by to introduce herself and give us water. We ordered our drinks and food at the same time.

You do get a little scone and fruit cup to start your meal, which is very cute. Fruit was ripe and scone was really good. My corned beef hash wasn't all that great. Maybe it just wasn't what I'm used to, but there was hollandaise sauce, huge chunks of potatoes, and corn kernels in the mix. I'd be fine with all of that if the flavor was amazing, but it was seriously lacking. My boyfriend got the biscuits and gravy which he said was really good. We also got a side of blueberry pancakes which were just okay. Not that fluffy or flavorful. The syrup was the best part!!

We were never checked on by our server unless we specifically called her over for refills. We sat for awhile when we were finalized waiting for our check, but when she finally came around she didn't have it. I just have her my credit card to have her close out. I was able to go to the restroom and come back before she brought back out receipt. 

Overall, there are some good dishes on the menu, but the slow service makes it not worth it to me. You'd have to have a full killer menu in order to negate the slow service. 

It's a bummer given their name!"}
{"text":"A fairy tale for you: 

Once, there was a restaurant called Max's Deli.  Max's Deli was, like Tommy's, a decent restaurant that had a following that bordered on the cultish.  Max's won tons of annual \"Best of\" awards from the local magazines, mainly on the basis of the fact that it had a) frickin' awesome sweet potato fries, and b) the best dessert case in all of Cleveland.  If you wanted sugar, Max's was your sugar daddy.

Then Max's closed its doors unexpectedly, saying they'd move to a new location.  They didn't.  Lord knows what happened, it's a mystery.  Instead, Sweet Melissa's opened in the same location, with pretty much the same food, and a slightly revamped (though thankfully not too much) dessert case.

I've spoken to the people who work here.  They seem to think it's an entirely different dining experience, and... well, it isn't.  It's overpriced deli food that'd probably be ranked four stars IF all the food was two bucks less, but it is good and filling stuff that you won't regret eating.  

The sad bit is that it stands in the shadow of Max's Deli, when really, it's just as good as Max's ever was - it just lost that weird cachet that frankly, Max's probably didn't deserve.  It's definitely a solid place to go for lunch, and I still get a hankerin'  for their sandwiches.  

BUT their dessert case is still filled with delightful wonderments - rich cakes, wonderful cookies, and a delectable S'mores style creation where I walked back after I was done and ordered another two to go.  They use a blowtorch to melt the marshmallows.  And how cool is that?"}
{"text":"After my most recent visit to Melissa's, I won't be back. The food is good, but not good enough to negate the atrocious service. The waiter was unbelievable slow, and seemed even slower once we told him we had somewhere to be. (It was the day before my wedding and we were having lunch after our manis and pedis, and before we were to be at the reception site to set up.) A lunch that was meant to be 45 minutes took 2 hours."}
{"text":"Can't get enough of this place
 Pumpkin sage gnocchi is easily the best item on the menu. Fantastic happy hour. 
Marylin and Lauren are the best. Request them. Even when they are busy they give the best service. 
I hope they don't hate me for making them Even more busy!"}
{"text":"First visit for brunch/lunch with a friend. We will definitely be back! I had the Shrimp and Grits - so yummy! The accompanying potatoes were very good, and I enjoyed the fruit, but agree with others about the mini scone being dense, dry and a little chalky. My friend devoured her wrap & fries, which is a good sign. Coffee was good, too and I appreciated the larger mug size. I was there to catch up with a friend, so I appreciated that the staff wasn't on us every 5 minutes. Service was courteous and we had no issues. With the unseasonably warm & sunny weather, everyone was out and about, so parking took some effort, but I enjoyed the walk.

UPDATED 11-11-2017
Returned with a friend visiting from out of town. Downgrading to 3 stars from 4. Our waitress was very forgetful and distracted, and the coffee wasn't so great. Food was still good, once we got all of it. Food was fine. I again got shrimp and grits. Maybe it was the vibe, but I wasn't as impressed as on my first visit."}
{"text":"I was torn between giving Sweet Melissa's 3-stars and 4-stars.  Based on meals alone, it would definitely be a three.  Dessert almost makes me want to give them that extra star.  But only almost.

To begin, we ordered the Fried Green Tomatoes, based on another reviewer.  I have never had this popular Southern dish before, so I can't compare it to another experience.  I found the appetizer to be good, but not as good as I hoped.  My boyfriend remarked that the only flavor he tastes was \"fried.\"  Perhaps the breading could have used a bit more seasoning.  The apple relish on top was delicious, however; I would have loved a big bowl of that as my appetizer!

For dinner, I ordered the Chicken Parmesan.  This is what really makes me want to give Sweet Melissa's three stars.  I found the dish to be quite bland, honestly.  I know that Chicken Parmesan is not a particularly crafty dish, but I have had it made in a crafty manner a few times.  In my opinion, the ability to add a special pop to everyday foods is what separates the good chefs from the great chefs.  Honestly, I felt like I could have replicated this dish exactly at home, and I am by no means an excellent chef.

My boyfriend ordered the Sal's Flat Iron Dip.  He said it was the best French-dip type sandwich he has ever had.  Still, he also said he'd only give it four stars because it was nothing new or unusual...just better.  Perhaps we just really look for that little extra in the foods we eat now.

As for desserts, I had the Chocolate Cheesecake and my boyfriend had a Lemon Meringue.  My cheesecake was absolutely decadent- the perfect food for a chocolate fix.  Creamy and chocolatey without being too intense.  My boyfriend had no words to describe his dessert other than \"mmmm.\"  We rate the desserts at a four and not a five, because as with the food, they weren't out of this world.  Given the right skills, another dessert/pastry chef could likely easily replicate them.  Still really good, though.

Bottom line is that you will likely enjoy a meal at Sweet Melissa's, but chances are it won't be the best you've ever had.  After discussing our experience on the way home, my boyfriend and I decided that we probably wouldn't do dinner at Sweet Melissa's again, but there is a possibility we would return for dessert and coffee."}
{"text":"been here a few time and really enjoy the food; the ingredients are fresh and full of flavor.   I only wish that customer service was a bit better. The staff tends to be indifferent which is why I only gave this review a three star, and they need to ensure dishes are properly cleaned. Otherwise, I do like the food, just on clean plates and clean cups would be ideal."}
{"text":"Sweet Melissa's- now Melissa's has improved greatly.  They repainted the restaurant making it brighter and more warm.  They also got rid of some of the copper decorations in the restaurant as well.   The layout is much smoother.  

Service was actually good.  The waitress was attentive and friendly- ASK FOR MOLLY! shes soo nice.  The manager comes around to check on the food and service too!  I don't even need to wait for refills- she just comes with a new one

They scaled down the availability of the food and the pastries :(  They only have one case of cakes/pastries/cookies.  The scaled down menu also leads to much faster service it seems.  They kept most of my favorites though! :D  AHHH..corned beef hash, omelette, veggie burger.. BRUNCH POTATO NIRVANA

IF YOU GO YOU HAVE TO GO EARLY BEFORE 1 AND GET THE BRUNCH POTATOES ON THE WEEKEND!  The corned beef hash, omelette, and veggie burgers are not to miss.  Actually their whole menu is really tasty.  I am not a huge fan of their steak salad- it seems like a waste of a perfectly good steak. The vegetable ratatouille is a little on the spicy side though.  All-in-all, don't skip potatoes- I Can't Stress that Enough"}
{"text":"If I am here it is usually for brunch or breakfast, but they have a great menu no matter what time of day you visit. They offer a little bit of something for everyone, even your vegetarian friends, and they've always been very accommodating of any food allergies in my group. 

If you want something sweet for breakfast, my favorite is the PB pancakes. They're just the right amount of sweet and are seriously a dream. The side of crispy potatoes that comes with them also helps to balance out the sweetness. 

More the savory type? Get the corned beef hash! It's magical and very filling. It's base is those deliciously crispy potatoes I spoke of, topped with corned beef, egg, and hollandaise. It's a favorite post run when I need something to help me refuel. 

They also offer other tasty options like omlettes, bagel sandwiches, traditional items, and a great tofu scramble. If you need a good meal, you'll find something here to love."}
{"text":"I miss Max's Deli.  I wish it would have come back like it was always rumored to. 

I'll keep this review short and sweet.  
Bad service.  
Mediocre food.  
Not worth the time or money.
Better restaurants in RR to try.
The End."}
{"text":"We came here for Sunday brunch on the way to go apple picking. The menu was cute--a single, clean page with short descriptions in all-lowercase (with appropriate use of the Oxford comma). As a vegetarian, I noted a good number of options, particularly in the Omelette section. I chose the tofu scramble (\"fried tofu, seasonal vegetables, feta, herbs, multigrain toast\"), which comes with sides of \"crispy red skin potatoes, fresh fruit, mini scone.\"

The little fruit cup and scone were super cute--the scone had good buttery, baking powder flavor. The potatoes were a little greasy, rather than crispy, but definitely edible.

I did enjoy the tofu scramble, but I would probably try something else next time. Like with the potatoes, the grease in this dish was a bit heavy and I'd prefer something a bit fresher for tofu/vegetables. That said--I enjoyed it and I would have eaten the leftovers, but they sat in a hot car while we picked apples, so I didn't think it was wise to eat them after that.

Overall, I liked the idea and atmosphere of Sweet Melissa, but I'd like to try more selections to get a better idea of the food options."}
{"text":"I like this place, and I want to love it, but it's frustrating to see how uneven the service, and sometimes the food, is. Their strongest, most reliable foods tend to be their appetizers--they tend to be simpler and not have the \"hey, wouldn't it be cool if we added _______?\" quality a lot of their dishes have.

I'll continue to go here because, again, I like it, but I wonder if it will continue to be likable."}
{"text":"After hearing tons of things, my husband and I finally went on a Saturday evening (6pm). Here's how it was:

Sevice- I want to be nice because the place became packed, but our server was mostly inattentive. Our small glasses were regularly empty and we didn't get our first check back until my husband's food was gone and mine was half gone. She also never smiled.

Atmosphere- This place has no clue what it wants to be. It is like an upscale restaurant/bar and a family bakery had a deranged child. There is little sound proofing so the place is LOUD. 

Food- First, our portion sizes were smaller than we were expecting based on the prices. My husband got the chicken carbanara and he thought it was ok. In his words \"nothing fantastic\". I had the pumpkin sage gnocchi and it was not what the menu described. The mushroom over powered everything except the goat cheese. This is how it should have been labeled:mushroom gnocchi with mushroom sauce and mushrroms. Also, some pumpkin seeds, scallions, craisens, and goat cheese.
The main reason we wanted to come was for dessert, but after the lack luster meal we were uneasy in trying something new.

The verdict: Sweet Melissa does not live up to the hype. Both of us were not impressed and found the food to be over priced. There's a slim chance we might come back, but it probably won't be in the near future."}
{"text":"Sweet Indeed! 

I avoided the sweet & went for the salty however, I cannot deny I was seriously tempted to try the bevy of beautiful delicacies in the dessert case. 

The Coffee was good and they kept the refills comin'. I sat at the bar and enjoyed good interactions with the staff; the were friendly and willing to answer questions concerning the menu. 

I went with the fantabuluos Grilled Cheese which included fried green tomatoes, goat cheese, mustard, cheddar, and bacon (May I mention that it was a whole pound of bacon packed on this sandwich? YUMMM!) all topped on grilled sourdough bread. The sandwiches are large enough to split and there is a huge pickle that comes pinned on top. While I opted not to eat the homemade potato chips, they did look mouthwatering. I ordered the fries and had half regular and half sweet potato. These are by far, the best sweet potato fries I have encountered in the Greater Cleveland area. The fries are also another hugeamongous portion, so be prepared to share. Yay for Sweet Melissa's! I also highly recommend, for those who enjoy condiments, that you give all of the in-house made varieties a try. 

Sighs & Sweet Dreams about Sweet Melissa's to be sure!"}
{"text":"A go-to restaurant for my wife and I when we want something casual, but more upscale. The food is always great, and a wonderful choice for takeout. Service in the restaurant can be a little slow at times if they're very busy, but the quality of the food certainly makes up for it."}
{"text":"Love their chicken salad. The herbed bread is to die for!"}
{"text":"Sweet Melisa's has lost a lot over the years. I remember when they used to serve every meal with a chocolate covered strawberry. Overall the food isnt as good as you would think. I recently went to the one in Avon Lake, and the blah-ness was reinforced. If I do go back, it will be strictly for some dessert to go!
**3 stars because the desserts are amazing, and beautiful!"}
{"text":"Excellent food! The fried green tomatoes are especially delicious!"}
{"text":"We were so excited for SM to open on our side of town as we have been frequent customers of the Rocky River location for about 2 years. Our visit today was pretty awful... and having worked in the food industry for many years i can usually turn a blind eye to mistakes and wait times but this was painful. 

First, it seemed as though there were no bussers or hostesses were too busy to clean empty tables so our initial reaction was that there wasn't much order in the restaurant. Once seated we waited nearly 8 minutes to be greeted. We gave our full drink and food order. Drinks arrived a short while after. We were expecting the little fruit and scone dish but did not get it, so we just figured this location didn't offer it. Food arrived within 15 minutes of ordering with the exception of my partner's side order. After we were finished eating the side item was brought out in addition to the fruit and scone dish. This was probably a total of 35 minutes after our initial order. The food was good but not great. We figured they'd keep the same consistancies as the other store but they did not at all. 

As we asked for the check and were about to leave, it was almost hard to watch tables around us who sat within 2 minutes of us sitting down, just getting drink orders brought to the table and complaints about the quality of the food. Henceforth, we will drive the extra 30 minutes to go the the Rocky River location for great service and food. It is definitely worth it."}
{"text":"First visit: came for dinner. We were not impressed with the atmosphere, but we came back for the food. 

Second visit: came for breakfast on a Sunday. Blueberry pancakes were good and service was much improved. 

Third/fourth visits: Happy Hour. This is one of longest and most inclusive happy hours in the area. $2-3 beers, $4 wines, and a good selection of small plates for under $5. 

If you like good food and you're not in a hurry, Melissa's is a good spot."}
{"text":"Fried green tomatoes were delicious! A little too much breading but that's easily forgiven. I had the pulled chicken risotto, which is always a great choice. You can't go wrong with chicken, bacon, pasta, veg, and sauce. I love it so much it was part of our wedding menu. Husband had crab cakes, which were good. The location in rocky river had better crab cakes, but these are still good. Service was adequate, parking ample, and food delicious!!"}
{"text":"Just went here for the first time, and had the Tofu Thai Stir Fry with Mango Iced Tea. Both were great, although the service was a little slow at times. Well worth the drive up from Hudson though."}
{"text":"Great food and service, but the heat was broken on a night when it was 10 degrees out. It was only after we were seated, with our food ordered, and asking our waitress to turn the heat up, that we were told the heat was broken. This should have been disclosed to us up front from the hostess when we first walked in."}
{"text":"Went for a Saturday brunch and loved the menu! Also had the regular Bloody Mary and it was great! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"After having a fabulous birthday dinner at one of our favorite date sports, the bf and I decided to check out Sweet Melissa's for some great desserts. I have heard numerous people rave about how delicious and delectable the desserts are here, so being the dessert connoisseur  am, it was a must stop. 

We opted to take our treats to go since it was close to closing time and we didn't want to be \"those people\". I was not disappointed that we didn't dine-in because the dining room had a sort of cafeteria-esqe feel to it, not very cozy or inviting. I settled on the vegan chocolate cake and a chocolate covered strawberry since after all, it was my birthday!

I couldn't wait until we got home, so I had a taste of the cake in the car and all I can say is major disappointment. It lacked that fluffy, moist chocolate decadence that most all chocolate cakes seem to have. At this point, I'm banking on the chocolate covered strawberry being the saving grace but sadly that fell short as well.  Call me a dessert snob but  a strawberry dipped in white chocolate ranks up there along side drowning a dessert in whipped cream on my list of \"Top 10 Dessert Sins\". Had I known that the entire strawberry was dipped in white chocolate and then dipped in milk and dark chocolate, I wouldn't have ordered it. 

I can't tell you how close we came to stopping at Wendy's for a chocolate Frosty on the way home to satisfy my sweet tooth!"}
{"text":"3.5-4!

I came here with some good friends and I enjoyed my time there. The interior is really cool -- it looks like a giant, trendy cafe. We were seated in the front booth with a view to the street. 

Prices are pretty reasonable for a place that values local food and unique fare. We shared the warm goat cheese salad (upgraded to entree size), pumpkin sage gnocchi (LOTS of gnocchi) and the baked eggplant. All of it tasted delicious! I was surprised at how much gnocchi that was in the dish. It was pretty fresh and soft with a great harvesty-fall flavor. They split the baked eggplant into 3 portions. The entree size warm goat cheese salad had LOTS of greens and 2 goat cheese rounds. I don't complain about having too many greens (especially to share), but if you're looking to have something a little more complex, I'd try the entree salads. I'm interested in trying the roasted vegetable salad next time!"}
{"text":"Had the chicken tacos with fries. Very good tacos!  Nice spot to drop in especially if your visiting JCU."}
{"text":"Good place to eat for lunch or dinner. The staff is friendly and fast. It's normally not crowded so there really is never a wait to be seated. Very chill ambiance. They offer a variety of dishes from sandwiches to Thai noodles. I usually get the Thai noodles. It's their version of pad Thai. It's a great vegetarian option. Also their cupcakes are very tasty and huge. I do recommend getting dessert here. Now here's why I'm giving it 4 stars. It's average food for a pretty penny. I honestly don't think this place is amazing. The food tastes good. However, I don't think the quality of the food matches the price they sell it for."}
{"text":"Not happy you are in Avon Lake. Our takeout order was cold and soggy. The GM did not know how to process a refund!"}
{"text":"I had the egg strata and it was damn delicious. No joke. I also was a fan of the huge coffee cups. My friend got the classic and she says \"the brunch potatoes were something to write home about.\" Everything tasted fresh and service was great."}
{"text":"I'm going to be fantasizing about their Brussel sprouts for a month until I get to come back to the area. Y-U-M!!"}
{"text":"I have tried this place repeatedly and the only reason I have gone back is the unique and tasty menu.  The service is consistently non-existent and disappointing.  At one point I sent a kind email to the manager complimenting them on the food but pointing out the poor service and I never heard back.  It's too bad because it's a family friendly place but most of the time I find myself choosing somewhere else to go."}
{"text":"My husband and I used to come here about 4 years ago and really enjoyed the food. The service has never been 'top notch', but the food made up for it. We then had a pretty awful experience to the point that we decided not to waste our time. Today friends of ours wanted to go to brunch here. It had been so long that we figured we'd give it another shot.... We all wish we hadn't. It started with the server bringing us coffee cups with bright pink lipstick on them. She also was very unfriendly. Then it took her almost 15 minutes to come back to our table and take our order. When the food came out, our friends order was missing the toppings on his waffle. The server said she would bring it right out. He literally had 2 bites left by the time it came out. His waffle also tasted like fish as did our potatoes. My steak tasted like they had rubbed charcoal on it. It was inedible. The server never once came to check on us. I had to go up after 30 minutes to the hostess to ask for our server. After that, it took another 10 minutes for her to come back to our table so we could ask for our check. The service here was incredibly awful. The worst I think we've ever had anywhere. And the food has become extremely disappointing. What really surprised me was there didn't seem to be a manager anywhere in the restaurant. All in all, this place has become disappointing in food and service."}
{"text":"Used to love this place. It's gotten terrible. First nobody said hello for 5 minutes though multiple employees saw us. The hostess finally sat us, rolling her eyes and the whole time. Our waitress forgot our drinks and never brought them. We ordered right away and never saw her again until we flagged her down wondering what's going on. The silverware was dirty. Not like a little. It was disgusting. Again couldn't find our waitress until after 15 minutes she came through the kitchen doors EATING. 

I've been a customer for 4 years. I will never be back. The quality of food has declined with the quality of staff. Sweet Melissa is anything but sweet anymore and leaves a bitter impression."}
{"text":"Peanut. Butter. Pancakes.  = Winning!
I've come here probably 3 or 4 times over the last year, however only for brunch, and have to say I enjoyed each experience.  I used to go to Max's Deli in high school and still feel sort of sentimental when I enter this place.  The service can be a little rough around the edges at time, but the food in my mind makes up for it.  And, the option of Irish coffee always helps!  The brunch options include some sandwiches, quiches, folded eggs (a.k.a. omelets) and of course the pancakes!  The breakfast potatoes have that perfect crispiness to them, although I'm not a fan of, and usually ask for them without, the aioli.  Hoping someday to get out there for dinner, but I know that there will be another trip for brunch in my future!"}
{"text":"we had a group of 10.  Our orders were all accurate, speedy and everyone loved what they got!  I had the brick chicken; great. My husband had the lobster ravioli; also great.  The prices are extremely reasonable."}
{"text":"I've only come here twice, and I've absolutely loved it both times! One was for Sunday brunch - the second was lunch with a friend. 
Every dish I've gotten has been so delicious and beautifully displayed. The service is efficient and nice. **THE BRUSSELS WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE! I usually do not get excited about Brussels but they are a must-try!! 
The atmosphere is contemporary and the lighting is super cute- it gives off a small bistro yet pub-like feel. I live in the heights and I love referring people to this place already!"}
{"text":"I want to love this place because it's walking distance from my house but boy do they need to get it together.  We will go back because I'm determined to find something I love here since it's so convenient.  We walked over this afternoon for lunch and it was really disappointing.  The restaurant was beautiful and really clean but the service was so slow and the place was pretty much empty.  It's so irritating to watch the entire staff of a restaurant sit in a corner and chat while your waiting to get your order in.  My husband ordered the grilled caesar salad.  When he ordered the waitress asked if he wanted his dressing on the side and he said that would be fine.  The salad was served without dressing on it or on the side, there were eggshell bits in the salad and it was served on an odd shaped small plate that made it impossible to eat.  The waitress never came back so we couldn't ask for another plate or dressing.  The plate size was actually the most irritating part.  This salad was served with the romaine lettuce in a huge wedge that was not cut apart so space was needed to cut the lettuce and everything just fell off the plate onto the table while we attempted to cut into the lettuce.  The plate was pleasing to the eye but not practical.  My husband also ordered the buffalo wrap and that was pretty tasty with really fresh veggies and delicious homemade chips.  I had the tuna nicosie salad it was very bland.  I'd probably rate this 3 stars if the waitress had addressed the plate and missing dressing but that added with the eggshells just ruined the experience. Seriously that plate drove me batty.  You can not fill every inch of plate with food that is served with a steak knife and needs to be cut up.  Great ideas/concept but really poor execution.  We want to be regulars so hope this review helps you improve."}
{"text":"Everything I've eaten here is just heavenly... Omelettes and avocado slices"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the atmosphere and I found the service to be prompt and friendly. I actually prefer my experience at Cle Heights location to the RR location. The Brussel sprouts and austin pork salad were fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"First time here with my fiancee... Who knew the lunch menu would have amazing selections. We ordered the Thai pork meatballs on a bed of butter lettuce, warm goat cheese salad & the chicken risotto... All three were AMAZING!! I was happy to see the food presentation was on point and the flavor was apparent in my mouth! I will say they could work on their bloodymarys! The ambiance has cute copper ceiling and a great vibe. Will be coming back to try the creme brulee because it was sold out that day. Must be that good!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Menu is different and delicious, and not too expensive for what you get. They also have a really good kids menu that is good quality and a good value. Will definitely be back !"}
{"text":"The food was super tasty! If going to dinner here didn't mean a two and a half hour time commitment, I would come here more often. 

My friend and I had gotten the brussel sprouts and lettuce wraps as appetizers and the Cobb salad and veggie lasagne as entrees. We both really enjoyed our meals. Everything tastes fresh and was well prepared. My friend brought her 2 year old baby, and they had a really great kids menu for her. I will say that the place seems very family friendly. 

As I alluded to earlier, the service is painfully slow. Our server was nice, but we waited about 20 minutes to place our order and after that, more than 50 minutes to get our meals. It also took more than 15 minutes to get our check after we were done eating. 

The hostess was also rude; we asked her for a bag and she seemed to be really offended by the question. She disappeared for more than 10 minutes, so I ended up grabbing a bag from a lady behind the bar instead."}
{"text":"I love Sweet Melissa's, it's always my first choice for brunch, lunch, happy hour, dinner... I've never been disappointed with anything I ordered... My favorites are the corn beef hash or the ABC omlette, (try a great spicy bloody mary or blood orange mimosa)  the mussels, warm goat cheese (ask for it without lettuce) Mediterranean pasta, and the crab cakes. it's all good though. it can be very crowded, but I've never waited more than a few minutes for a table. The happy hour is great, once we were told we weren't in the right section for the happy hour menu, so make sure! Otherwise, it's definitely worth a visit! Or 10!"}
{"text":"After living in Lakewood for over a year I finally gave this place a try after hearing wonderful things.  First of all I loved the ambiance, its big, clean and open, with a delicious looking dessert case as you walk in.  No booths though which is sometimes a bummer, but I still really enjoyed the feel. 

Now onto what really matters, the food.  We ordered the calamari to split as an appetizer while we sipped on beer and wine waiting for our food.  Unfortunately, I will say, never order the calamari.  It honestly tasted like it came out of a freezer and then was just fried quickly.  It was chewy, no tentacles, which is a huge red flag its not fresh, or real possibly, and very greasy.  The dipping sauces were really good, but the product not so much.  

For dinner I ordered a shrimp and lobster roll, my friend ordered a veggie burger, and we ordered asparagus and sweet potato fries to split.  My roll was very good! The bread was fresh, the shrimp and lobster was plentiful and it wasn't over mayoed.  It definitely tasted fresh with seasonings, it was very spicy though due to jalapenos they put on the bread so they are easily taken off.  I love hot things and still couldn't handle the extra kick.  My friend really enjoyed her veggie burger which she added fresh avocado too.  

Both our meals came with home made chips and we did not know that or we probably wouldn't of ordered two sides, but the chips were really good but I ended up not eating them.  The asparagus was cooked very well, but was a little salty but to some people that is a good thing, and the fries were delicious!  Can't go wrong with a sweet potato fry?  

I definitely will be back to give it another shot, possibly try it for brunch but just be careful on what you order."}
{"text":"My husband and I recently came here for dinner and drinks after a long work week. It was so hard to find something to order since so many things looked good. We decided to just order about every appetizer on the menu ever. Here's a tip: everything was so. darn. good. The only thing was the dessert (despite looking delicious) was really lacking. I think we'll skip that next time and just stick with the hot food."}
{"text":"Awful service. Yummy brunch. My husband and I go expecting to be very disappointed by the service but find it worth it for the Corned Beef Hash and all of the stuff that comes with your dish (mini scone, fruit). When you're paying $15 for a breakfast dish the least you can expect is a smile from the wait staff along with the eats."}
{"text":"We went for breakfast which they just began serving. There was one waitress for a restaurant full of people. The food was nothing spectacular. My husband ordered peanut butter pancakes, which where buttermilk pancake with a dollop of peanut butter on top. We could have made that at home. The French toast had no flavor and the steak frittata was okay the presentation was awful."}
{"text":"This place has a serious split personality as evident by the reviews. I have experienced both good and bad sides and unfortunately, their lack of consistency makes me think twice about going back. 

I have been to Sweet Melissa's about half a dozen times and those experiences have been 50/50 good and bad.  I have gone and experienced everything from decent service and very tasty food to horrible service and sub-par food. 

What's frustrates me most is that I have ordered the same thing on three separate occasions and had a different result ranging from delicious to mediocre each time. How can this occur? 

Their menu is nice with with a good range of choices, but who wants to flip a coin when they go out to eat wondering if they are going to get Jekyll or Hyde? Pull it together Sweet Melissa's and then I'll go back. You could be great. Until then, I think I will try a place where I know what I will get."}
{"text":"We stopped in for our first visit tonight and it will not be our last! The place was packed, but we managed to get two seats at the bar -no tap, but a good selection of bottles, wine, and spirits. We started with the Lobster Bisque and Fried Green Tomatoes. Both were out in less than ten minutes and were incredibly delicious! Just as we were finishing the apps, our dinners came out: Lobster Rolls (that's right-two rolls!) and Bacon Wrapped Meatloaf. The lobster roll also had shrimp, a very light mayo, and crunchy onions, peppers, and cabbage. Extremely tasty! This would be a great summer dish! The one inch slice of bacon wrapped meatloaf was served on top of garlic mashed potatoes atop a bed of spinach. Wonderful combination! Absolutely NO room for dessert -next trip up we will try more! Great service from waitstaff and the kitchen. The manager also spent some time explaining how the restaurant is on the boarder of Shaker Heights and University Heights (with 3 tables and the doorway belonging to University Heights, the rest belonging to Shaker - thus resulting in NO LIQUOR on Sundays). Oh politics! 
Anyway -very nice time this evening coming in around $60 including tip!"}
{"text":"I have been to Sweet Meissa's probably over 50 times in the past several years.  It is one of my go to places.  I've always had a very good experience, great food, great service and a nice atmosphere.  Staff has always been friendly and attentive.  (even when I order take out)."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Sweet Melissa.  I went there for Sunday morning breakfast after church.  I arrived at 11ish, and the place was sufficiently full, but there was no wait.  Once seated, I perused the 1 page menu, lots of variety.  I was torn between a breakfast wrap and the french toast.  I ultimately chose the french toast ($8), with a side of bacon ($4).  My server was a bit stand-offish, but okay overall.   Then menu listed mini scone, fruit, breakfast potatoes.  I thought that there was an option to choose one, but all accompanied my entree,   The french toast arrived a short while later, and the serving was more than generous, the slices were fluffy, hot and full of flavor, with hints of vanilla, and a small bottle of real maple syrup.  I couldn't finish everything, due to the portion size, so I happily boxed up the leftovers, requested the check and left, full happy and satisified!  The food was absolutely a 4+, service was more like a 3.  I will return...soon!"}
{"text":"By far the worst service I have ever received in my life. The only place I've ever heard of that has posted hours and closes its kitchen over half an hour beforehand. Two days in a row, I tried to dine here and unfortunately couldn't make it until later in the evening. The 2nd night I had company from California whom I wanted to take here to show them how good their food is after I was raving about it. Upon entering, I was turned away immediately by the staff and told that the kitchen had closed for the evening even though there were many other patrons in the establishment. I've never felt so ostracized and treated poorly in my entire life. I will not give this place a 3rd try because I don't believe that it will be a charm. Instead i'll dine elsewhere and will never recommend this establishment to anyone. My family member from California will now have this memory of Cleveland forever."}
{"text":"So happy to have a place nearby with a roomy patio, and spacious, where conversation in comfy booths or chairs doesn't compete with a blaring TV or disappear in a cavernous echo chamber.  AND yummy, reasonably-priced food that's prepared with nuance and RESTRAINT!  For example, the hint of bourbon in the French Toast was an unexpected tastebuds tickler, along with breakfast potatoes drizzled, not drowned, with a slightly tangy hollandaise (?), and omelette with just enough cheese to enhance the flavor, and enable other ingredients to strut their stuff.  Service was very friendly & warm.  Looking for more excuses to go here with friends & family!"}
{"text":"I've been to Sweet Melissa's twice now and both times were a great experience. The food and the service is good and there are some healthy choices on the menu."}
{"text":"I keep coming back but usually leave slightly annoyed. The food is usually very good and I come for brunch when it's pretty affordable. The brunch offerings are very good and their potatoes are absolutely delicious. If this review was based solely on food, it might be a 5-star spot. Alas, the service...

It's always slow. Like painfully slow. Drinks sit empty for extended periods of time. The food comes even slower. This is tolerable considering they give you the mini-scone and fruit cup. Except unfortunately, more often than not, the server completely forgets to bring this. When the food does finally come, something is usually wrong. 

I would keep coming back because I enjoy the food. Unfortunately, I think it's getting harder and harder to talk my lady into going here. She only puts up with bad service so many times. Our good west side brunch options are limited, and this one is shooting itself in the foot...

To the good folks of Sweet Melissa--please do something about the service. PLEASE."}
{"text":"Basic.. so basic. The breakfast, anyway.  Our service was good and I enjoyed the little fruit dish we got before our meals but everything else was just eh. I really liked the biscuits and gravy, though. They had a little kick to them but I did not like how you don't have the option to order a full order of them. They come in a bowl and the main dish is mostly the dry scrambled eggs that come with them that I could have done without. I want a full plate of comforting biscuits and gravy!! We also ordered the Greek omelette. Not good. It was dry and came with hardly any feta or anything else, for that matter besides being stuffed full with artichokes. Doubt I will go back."}
{"text":"Food okay. Service needs improvement. Bartender does not how to make mixed drinks. Pleasant atmosphere. Most likely will return."}
{"text":"We Love trying new things... I would say we have been to Sweet Melissa's maybe 3-4 times... We love love the thai meatballs because they are a good sized meatball with an amazing glaze. We always order it for our starter. Their were two meatballs skewed together to look like one big meatball. They were not what they were when we dined in. Disappointed and I don't think I will be ordering that anymore. The lollipop wings were so incredibly dry thank goodness their was sauce in the bottom of the bowl to dip!! The chicken pot pie was pretty popular we were told so we gave it a try. We loved the flakey crust and everything was so delicious. We just had to sprinkle lots of salt & pepper to taste. I love giving GOOD reviews but this time it was not the best on this slow Memorial Day... Whomp whomp!!"}
{"text":"I have nothing even mediocre to say about this place. The food is spectacular as is the service. Even though I frequent this place often, it always feels intimate, warm, and special."}
{"text":"My lunch at Sweet Melissa's in Rocky River could quite possible be the worst service I've ever received at a restaurant...ever.

We called ahead and thought, great! We cut the line and were seated within 5 minutes (although there was no hostess at the hostess stand for about 3-4 minutes after we got there). 

There was a party of 8 of us and after we were seated, it was as if the restaurant forgot we existed. Four tables were sat after us, with menus and water, before I had to get up and ask for menus. Once they brought over menus, the brought 2....for a party of 8! We didn't get water for about 10-12 minutes and after the hostess brought us water, the waiter came over and just asked if we wanted anything additional to drink then said \"be right back.\" Well, he never came back. The hostess said she would go get him, but then ended up taking the order on her own because he was NO WHERE TO BE FOUND. If it weren't for her, we would still be sitting there. Actually, I almost made the group get up and go to Mellow Mushroom because the first 15 minutes we were ignored. 

When our food finally came, I got shrimp tacos and they were very sub par. The shrimp was cold and so were the sweet potato fries I ordered. I would give the food a 5/10, but am willing to try their brunch as I've heard great things. 

However, within 2 minutes of getting our food, the waiter brought over the check and said \"no rush.\" I WAS LIVID. Now that your \"duties\" are done since we have our food you can give us the check and leave? I didn't even get the guys name because he was at our table for LESS THAN 5 MINUTES. The whole experience was horrible, and I hope to GOD that this waiter, who was lazy and rude, split his tip with the hostess who did ALL of his work. 

So so so mad."}
{"text":"Waitstaff is actually on top of it. Every time I come here, they are always quick and efficient. I order something complicated on the menu, they don't miss a beat. Neighborhood favorite!"}
{"text":"Creative menu that leans towards the healthy side."}
{"text":"I visited the new location in University Heights with my family for brunch this morning.  The layout of the entrance is poor as the tables near the front have no protection from the cold when the door opens and people waiting for tables are standing over them.  The kitchen was very slow as was the service.  I suspect the menu is far too extensive for a brunch and they are trying to be all things for everyone.  Focus on a core menu and make people happy.  The tables around us were all grumbling about the wait for their food and claim they will not be going back.  The food, when it finally came out was alright, nothing worth the hour plus wait though.  The waitress was pleasant but did not know much about the items on the menu.  There are many better choices for brunch in the area and they will need to improve several aspects of their business if they hope to last.  It's too bad."}
{"text":"Seventeen minutes without being acknowledged.  Seated, then 17 minutes.  No water, no do-you-want-coffee, no hello, no taking of my breakfast order. Many tables not bussed.  Grossly understaffed."}
{"text":"Dont get the anhus burger. American traditional restaurant does not know how to make a simple burgers. Burger is not homemade, is frozen, and super bland. Fries are re-fried and BUNS are also reheated."}
{"text":"Ever felt like you found a restaurant that just offers everything you could possibly want? 

Well, Ta-Da!

I have ordered the Carolina and the Corned Beef Hash for Brunch. 
Which is better? Both are just \"delish\"!

Lunch or Dinner? 
Gird your loins for rich, savory and just plain, Good Food!
So, I had to return to try all that I wanted to try.

Start off with the Fried Green Tomatoes, Fried Brussel Sprouts or Battered Artichoke Hearts! Yummy in my tummy!
Tomatoes could definitely use a little more seasoning, but salt isn't good for you anyway, right?

Move over to the Chicken Pot Pie, Chicken Carbonara or Pulled Chicken Risotto. So what, I love Chicken... I'm gonna go back again and again, until I've had the Grouper, Short Ribs and Scampi...
Stay tuned...in the meantime, give them a try.

{"text":"I have heard many things about Sweet Melissa's. I hear the food is phenomenal. I tried looking up their hours and phone number and while I found the site easily, the hours and number were more of an enigma, but a little digging I was rewarded with the number (albeit not mobile friendly to dial). I was at happy hour across the street and knowing I was  bringing treats to my next location I stopped up at Sweet Melissa 's to grab a few treats. 

The interior is amazing; clean lines, minimalist and a little high class. I was drawn right to the treat cases and picked out a brownie, peanut butter cookie and vegan cookie cupcake.

All in all, none of the sweets were delectable or even just tasty, sadly. The peanut butter cookie's primary taste was flour, a peanut or its butter barely detectable. While it's large, the taste isn't worth the calories.

The same can be said for the brownie, again, a huge portion but the taste borders on bland. The usual succulent aspects of brownies are missing in this dessert. While it is moist, there is, again, minimal flavor at best.

I got excited about the vegan cupcakes advertised on the website. They had a cupcake that was chocolate with Oreo cookie frosting. This was the best of the three treats but still lacking in pizazz. The frosting was crusty, and while the cupcake itself was very moist, the frosting is a detractor and the flavor is non-existent. 

All in all, I am underwhelmed. For a place that touts its treats, not so great. I liked the vibe when I dropped up, but without a major re-haul of the sweets section, I can't imagine coming back...because a bland meal is even worse than an alright, at best, dessert."}
{"text":"I have had brunch at Sweet Melissa about   4 times prior to today, and after my experience today, I am not sure I will go back. My friend and I went there for brunch after a run and we arrived at 12:40. We were informed that they stopped serving brunch at 1, but if we sat at the bar we would be able to eat brunch, as the wait for a table was to long (this is not a big deal, and I enjoy sitting at the bar). When we got to the bar, we asked the bartender for a menu and she responded, \"they should have given you one when you walked in\" and she walked away. She came back several minutes later, gave us the menu and my friend asked about the specials and she pointed and said \"its on the board\". She then came back and said, \"if you want brunch you have 3 minutes to order\". We got up and left, she responded with a \"sorry\" as we walked out. 

I understand that you may stop serving brunch at a certain time, but there are so many ways to handle this issue and be professional about it. I also understand that the place is crowded, but don't roll you eyes and act as if your customers are a burden. This was my friend's first time there and she will never go back. We ended up going to the Tap House in Tremont, sat at the bar and had great food and service!"}
{"text":"Love Sweet Melissa's as the menu and food are great . Went last Sunday for breakfast as my omelette was excellent . The service was fast and courteous .. This is a neighborhood gem ."}
{"text":"Food is very good here although be prepared to spend some time!  The service is always a bit slow paced. The desserts are to die for!"}
{"text":"Was on the way to another local neighborhood joint for lunch when we passed Sweet Melissa and the wife had a craving for salad, changed her mind and decided to come here. For some reason I was really skeptical, but hesitantly agreed - as if I had a choice in the matter anyway. Looking at the menu, this was certainly a good place to get salad - they have a ton of options. I'm not a salad expert, but I was blown away by the prices. Their regular non-protein salads are all $7 - a side salad to me. While their entree salads start at $13. She had the butternut squash salad, which she really enjoyed... plus Reuben's lean corned beef, which I tried a little bit of. For someone who's a fan of Slyman's and Mr. Brisket, I probably shouldn't have expected much out of corned beef described in the menu as \"extra lean\". Extra lean it was, but they didn't list extra dry. Wasn't a fan.

For me, I had Chuck's Angus sirloin burger. I was already whiny for having to come here because I didn't get to go where I wanted to go :) so I wasn't expecting much. It's pretty hard to screw up a burger, so I figured \"why not?\" Dang! The burger was actually excellent!! Well seasoned and very juicy. I thought the balsamic vinaigrette helped to enhance the seasonings. My only criticism, while the chips were good, is that for a $10 burger \"lunch\"... fries should have been included. I had to order a side of fries for $4, which made my portion $14. Don't get me wrong... I actually enjoyed my burger and fries. Just not sure that the value was there.

Would I come back? I'm interested in their weekend brunch menu, but on a regular day? Hmmmm... probably, if someone I'm with really wanted to come here, but likely wouldn't put this on the top of my suggestion list."}
{"text":"I had great service here!  The girl was so nice and accommodating.  I had the seared tuna app and added avocado- presentation was beautiful, food was yummy, and it was the perfect light lunch.  The rest of the menu looked great.  Not giving 5 stars because I haven't had the chance to experience the other food.  And, I wish their drink glasses were bigger so refills wouldn't be such a need."}
{"text":"This place has gone down hill.  The food is mostly ok but not great or consistent.  The service can be absolutely horrible.  If you sit in the bar area expect long waits for everything (took 20 minutes to get a drink = lost revenue).  This is primarily a management issue as the person behind the bar is overextended and there is never more than one person there, waiting on bar patrons, the tables in the bar, drink orders for wait staff, getting deserts etc.  No time to make eye contact.  Doesn't appear to be a manager type in the dining room.  Melissa you should spend more time in your establishment."}
{"text":"Our visit to Sweet Melissa was actually not planned. We were driving around the west side, looking for somewhere to eat and not being able to agree on something (as usual) when, lo and behold, we came across this little gem. From it's name you'd probably think they are all about desserts. Well, my friends, don't be fooled. There's more to this neighborhood eatery than meets the eye.

First off, the front of the restaurant is actually in the back. I know, it's one of those places. Sure, you can park on Detroit out front, er, back and walk through the doors and make your way all the way to the back, I mean, front to the hostess station, but it's probably just easier to park in the back, dammit, I mean front and skip the hassle.

The place isn't all that big, but it does feel nice and open. Big windows, lots of light and a large central dining area all add up to a comfortable and uncrowded experience. There's a bar, tables and chairs and a few booths along the walls, and, yes, a dessert case full of goodies you'll wanna nosh. I really like the atmosphere and our seats, up by the windows were nice and secluded.

Our server was excellent. He didn't try to oversell anything, didn't harp on the gluten-free side of their business and was quick to take our orders and fill our waters. Sure, the place was practically empty during our visit - it was somewhere around 5:30pm on a Tuesday - but I have a feeling this guy was just good at his job.

We started with the deviled eggs. I know, who wouldn't? Three whole eggs, halved and filled with creamy, dijon-laced cream. Crispy applewood smoked bacon and scallons on top. Delicious. I especially liked the heat from the spice sprinkled on the plate.

For salads we each picked a different one:

Butternut Squash: Overall, not a bad salad. Mixed greens, cubes of cooked butternut squash, red onion, candied pecans, goat cheese, dried cranberries, and bacon. This salad combination isn't anything new and is still one of my favorites. I really liked the combo of the acidic dressing with the slightly sweet squash. The dressing, a brown butter vinaigrette, wasn't all that flavorful and could have been more plentiful 

Warm Goat Cheese: Field greens, cherry tomatoes, pine nuts, dried cranberries, slice of Gala apple, balsamic vinaigrette and served with a crostini. Fresh and tasty and a play on sweet and sour, this salad was quite delicious. I would have liked another goat cheese medallion and would have preferred that the apple had been diced, but overall a good offering.

My wife kept it soup and salad with the lobster bisque. A delicious and buttery smooth soup with small, tender pieces of lobster. A delicious rendition of this classic.

I had wanted the meatloaf sandwich but was told they were out of meatloaf. Calling an audible I opted for the much healthier Brooks's Blackened fish tacos. The tacos, served with house chips, were OK. The fish was cooked nicely, tender and juicy, but I found the combo of the horseradish sauce and mango jicama slaw to be a bit too wet. I would have also liked more heat.

Of course we got dessert. How could we not? And we went big. A triple-layered German chocolate cake. Three layers of densely chocolate cake topped with chocolate ganache and coconut, pecan caramel frosting. I love this classic and this version didn't let us down. In a word, yum."}
{"text":"This place serves reasonably-priced New-American fare. This not high end, so don't expect Edwin's-level cuisine for this price range. The menu offers unique items or unique twists to classical items, and nothing is ever predictable. This was a great place to stop in for dinner after work, on moments I didn't feel like cooking.

Summary: a hint of gourmet-style cooking and inventiveness on a budget."}
{"text":"The pulled chicken butternut Risotto is to die for. Even after the first serving I wanted a second. The menu here change seasonally. In the former location of Max's Deli, they have kept the open airy modern industrial cafe feel in the ambiance. The staff are always polite & helpful. Although not a exhaustive menu for every discriminating palette, there are several gems of items that can be found - fried green tomatoes, fried artichoke hearts, pulled chicken butternut Risotto, sweet n salty cake ( chocolate cake with caramel ganache).  I was told they don't have a dedicated bar tender during the day even though I was there after 4:30pm on a Saturday.  I found this somewhat odd. They have happy hour starting 4 pm daily - how do they pull that off without a bar tender?! Check out announcement on yelp listing.   They have a long list of martini & mixed drinks which are made by the wait staff themselves. I observed my wait staff going through a recipe book and hunting & pecking through the whole bar for the various ingredients of my drink order. In short, don't go here for the drinks here or expect every item hit it out of the ballpark. Do go for some of the gems & an ambiance suited for a casual cafe affair. Sweet Melissa is casual sweet but is no Posh Spice."}
{"text":"This has a very eclectic menu with high-quality items that are a little bit unusual. You can get a late lunch there or dinner and they have lots of choices for vegetarians vegans or meat eaters. Their pastries and desserts are also excellent. We had the four dips with a spinach dip a tofu spicy dip a guacamole dip and a butternut squash dip everyone enjoyed sharing that appetizer individuals ordered a regular hamburger which they said was outstanding a turkey club sandwich which was enjoyable and good quality ... Others ordered a adult grilled cheese sandwich and a eclectic salad..."}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favorite places to eat but  the quality seems to have gone down hill over the past couples years.  The main entrees are decent but nothing spectacular.  The fried green tomatoes are still delish and they have a great happy hour deal every day in the bar area but those aren't enough to keep me coming back on a regular basis.  I want a unique menu that changes seasonally and incorporates local ingredients.  The biggest disappointment for me was the Red Velvet Cake.  I loved that heavenly piece of cake but now it's on the dry side and lacks an awesome cream cheese frosting.  Hope they fix things soon...."}
{"text":"Really disappointed. Ordered grilled salmon, which turned out to be mostly salad w a small piece of salmon on the side. This was fine and salad was very good, just not what I expected. Salmon was much more than well done but actually burnt, with the burnt side face down. Ate a few bites but was inedible. By the time waitress came back I was done with salad and plate was pushed away with most of salmon remaining. She asked me if I wanted a box and I said no, salmon was burnt. She smiled and said \"sorry everything wasn't exactly as you wanted\" and left the check."}
{"text":"My mom suggested we go to Sweet Melissa's for brunch after church. Surprisingly, for such a petite restaurant on a Sunday afternoon, it was not crowded. We got seated right away so my expectations for greatness were high. However, like previous Yelp reviewers have mentioned, it is pretty dirty. Food on the floor, tables and chairs. I saw a teenage hostees \"clean off\" a table. Not sure why she bothered. My napkin wrapped in silverware had food crust in it. The icing on the cake was our \"thrilled\" waitress who took her time and practicality rolled her eyes at anything we requested or needed. For instance, requesting butter is equivalent to being asked to do your least favorite chore. When our food did come out, all of our problems went away. The french toast was amazing! Pure golden sweetness. I love how they prepared the breakfast potatoes for my side dish. Tiny whole potatoes that were boiled and slightly smashed. My mom had the shrimp and grits and she also gave high ratings.  Overall, Sweet Melissa's has great food and I will definitely be back for the french toast. I just won't expect being served with a smile."}
{"text":"Great Happy Hour...you can't beat 6-9pm. Their menu had a lot of choices in addition to different price points. The bartenders were really attentive and fun."}
{"text":"Great location, and the only place in area serving breakfast. But... twice I have stopped in looking for a cup of coffee and a breakfast pastry and not found the latter. Astonishing that they do not offer anything like Danish pastry, etc."}
{"text":"Went here yesterday for Brunch around 11am and was able to get seated right away even though we were a party of 6, we definitely missed the rush, because when we left there were about 10 people waiting to be seated and the restaurant was full!

Ordered the Carolina, which came with scrambled eggs, grits and sausage patties as well as brunch potatoes and fresh fruit with a tiny scone. Food was excellent, for something so simple they add gourmet touches that make it fantastic. The sausage had a great light flavor, while the eggs had a touch of rosemary in them and the potatoes where crispy and divine. Portions were a good size and left me pleasanlty full. 

Bought a dream bar (you know they kind with chocolate chips, pecans and coconut) it was just ok, it was a bit too sugary sweet, I should got a tart like I wanted to but oh well. Will definitely go back again next time we are in town, great place!"}
{"text":"After hearing such raves from Yelp and everyone I know, I was expecting to be blown away. I was not. I found the food to be a little underwhelming. I got a pulled chicken risotto with bacon and cranberries . The chicken was in odd chunks and bacon and cranberries were scant. It just didn't taste like anything, and the bacon strips were mostly fat. The fried brusell sprot appetizer was redeeming, as was the half price bottle of wine deal that you could then take home with you. I would go back I guess and try something new because the deserts looked AWESOME."}
{"text":"Probably the best brunch I have ever eaten! I am still so happy after eating there. I am visiting my friend in Rocky River who eats there multiple times a week and raved about it so were very excited to go. Sonja's bagel was the best combination of flavors on top of a yummy bagel. The greek omelette was out of this world as well! The potatoes, fruit and mini scone paired each and were a great touch. Lots of seating, open space. Good atmosphere! We may have to go again tomorrow!!"}
{"text":"Slowest service on the planet! We always count on over an hour for lunch. Servers not apologetic in any way and really couldn't care less. East side location is better regarding service. Food at both locations is always good but the wait in Rocky River isn't always worth it."}
{"text":"Very good dinner spot. 

The salmon with fried green tomatoes was excellent. The tomatoes was genuinely one of the best renditions I've ever had, which was a big surprise. Crab cakes were crabby and pretty good but came with one of those awful barely-sauteed 'vegetable medleys', and this medley was unfortunately composed of tritones. 

The big disappointment was the dessert, which we had read good things about. They were out of chocolate cake, which is OK, but the red velvet cake, which they cut from a whole cake to-order, tasted like refrigerator. It was awful. 

They lost a star over dessert; for these prices, which aren't bad, they should make sure everything is fresh. But we'd eat here again, especially fried green tomatoes."}
{"text":"I go to Sweet Melissa for two of my favorite dishes. Number one, hands down, are the brussel sprouts. They call them \"fried brussel sprouts,\" however, they aren't heavy with a thick batter. They're soft and full of flavor and served with a thai chili-type sauce that compliments them very well. I think that I could eat them every day, they're that good!! Secondly, I love the pumpkin sage gnocchi. It's served with goat cheese, dried cranberries and mushrooms. The portion size is definitely big enough for leftovers the next day and it's equally as good then as the first time you eat it. The dish is rich, but not overly heavy and each bite bursts with flavor. I've never been for brunch, but people rave about it so that's next on my list to try."}
{"text":"I had found this restaurant online since i was coming in from out of town.  My mother and I were at the Cleveland Zoo for Mother's Day and this restaurant looked fantastic.  I had nothing but amazing service.  The food was excellent!  We had battered artichoke hearts for an appetizer.  My mothers had a Christine's Steak Wrap and I had Chicken Milanese.  The ingredients tasted fresh and we were very pleased.  I got a piece of the chocolate cheesecake to-go along with some cannolis for my husband and father.  They were all enjoyed.  Please make it a point to stop at this wonderful place.  You won'e be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Sweet Melissa's feels like a regular restaurant, nothing too spectacular about it at first blush - but read the fine print at the bottom of their menus and you'll find that the meat they buy and serve is hormone and antibiotic-free, the greens are locally grown and some of the items are certified organic. It doesn't at all feel like a vegetarian hippie joint though and neither does the menu and therefore is interesting to me. 

The fried green tomato appetizer was delicious. The breading had just the right amount of seasoning, the horseradish ranch added to it nicely however the spiced apple chutney was totally incongruous and is best eaten after the tomatoes are gone. The burger tasted... how can I say it... burgery. I could actually taste the meat which sounds weird I know, but I am sure it has to do with the quality of the beef they buy. 

Blue Moon, Great Lakes, among other beers - pints for $3, all the parking you could want and a fully stacked dessert case. We were too stuffed for it, but two words for you: red. velvet."}
{"text":"Went with a party of 8 for one of the guests' birthday on a Sunday for brunch. After more than a 40 min wait, as they don't take reservations and only have 2 areas that will fit a larger party, we were seated. Service was decent at best as it took another 5-10 min for waitress to come take our drink order and another 10+ min to receive our drinks. Food was lacking in both flavor and the respective sauce. I had the corn beef hash, mostly potatoes with 2 eggs and chopped corn beef. Another member of our group had the biscuits and gravy, he had to ask for extra gravy as there was little on the dish. My wife had a bagel sandwich which consisted of a burnt crunchy bagel and dry eggs. Lastly, they were out of waffles, which is absurd for a breakfast establishment. Overall it was over priced, a long wait, and poor service for mediocre food."}
{"text":"Man I loved this place! It had a very cute and classy atmosphere! I ordered the meatloaf and it was amazing with the mashed potatoes! I also had sweet potato fries!!! So goooooood!!! I highly recommend this place!! It's great!"}
{"text":"I still enjoy this restaurant but I wouldn't go there for brunch again. The brunch options are not great. The pancakes are good but it's hard to scree that up. I had a breakfast burrito that was bland and dry. Wish they had more unique options. Still enjoy this place for lunch and dinner. It's not as amazing as a Tremont restaurant but better than hitting up a chain restaurant."}
{"text":"I love Sweet Melissa's but this location has yet to impress me. I've been there several times with friends.  The service is a little slower. They messed up my husband's crab cakes and when they brought it out again, he said it still wasn't good. I'm hoping that they will improve since this location just opened up within the last year."}
{"text":"Great outside seating. Food was bland and quite overpriced for its taste. I had the crab and eggs. Hollandaise was tasteless same with the crab and fried green tomatoes. It was cooked well, just no flavor at all"}
{"text":"Just what was needed in the heights!  Make sure to request the server Susie...She's the best!"}
{"text":"Showed up too late for brunch, but ended up really enjoying lunch.  The bacon-wrapped meatloaf was very good with some peppers giving the meatloaf just a little extra kick.  The red baby potatoes, served whole, were a fantastic side highlighted by their crispy exterior.  Even the other side of sauteed spinach and mushrooms tasted good and brought some welcome green coloring to the plate.  The Angus Sirloin Burger looked very appetizing and was well received, though the homemade potato chips included with that were only average at best.  We did save room for the red velvet cake that was featured in this month's Cleveland magazine.  The triple layer cake has an extremely generous amount of cream cheese frosting, though the frosting is definitely needed to carry some moisture into the dry cake parts.  Personally, I think they went a little overboard on the frosting, but that criticism wouldn't keep me from having another slice."}
{"text":"Food is just okay -  not what you would expect for the price. Also many \"messy\" dishes. They pile it on small plates making it difficult to eat.

Soup is amazing, especially the tomato bisque.

i like that they leave the water pitches on the table so you aren't waiting.

Seating is a little close, maybe 14 inches between some tables, making it impossible to NOT clearly hear your neighbors full conversation.

Great interior design.

Have been here several different times - lunch, 3 pm, late dinner and service is always S-L-O-W.

Overall I would go back but its not one of my top choices."}
{"text":"I've been there twice, and it's wonderful! I must recommend that you try the mango - iced tea.  It's truly unique and delish.  

I had the fried green tomatoes benedict - which were wonderful!  I would recommend trying them.  My friend is obsessed with their salads - and gives them a rave review. 

Whether it's brunch, lunch,  or a chocolate craving - try Sweet Melissa's!"}
{"text":"Great food!!! Their red potatoes are amazing. Service was slow, but worth the wait. Went for Sunday Brunch, but they do not serve alcohol on Sunday's b"}
{"text":"Wandered into Sweet Melissa one evening just looking for a sweet treat to take home... yeah what really happened was me buying enough food for the rest of the week! Nice atmosphere, not a lot of people inside since it was close to closing time, but the staff quickly greeted me with friendly smiles and they were very informative when I asked about their menu. The food really sounded great, and I did get a bunch of stuff to sample, however the main negatives would be that they seem a bit pricey on some items and the manager repeatedly told me about how they serve Gluten Free items even after I told him I don't care about that. I'm not part of the 2% diagnosed by a medical professional to have a problem with Gluten so stop trying to sell me the latest trend. Now on to the food:

-Pumpkin Tart: Meh, tasted like pumpkin, but nothing special and too dry for me. 
-Chocolate Mousse Cup: Awesome treat for your taste buds. Little pricey at $4 though for the small size. 
-Carrot Cake Cupcake: Eh, good but nothing special. 
-Butternut Squash Salad: Nice and tasty mix of goat cheese, warm bacon dressing, and veggies. 
-Lobster Shrimp Risotto Balls: Deliciousness. Loved soaking up the broth with the risotto balls. 
-Fried Green Tomatoes: Tasty and the apple relish was a nice touch, however it could have used some sauce. Perhaps they forgot?

Overall I would definitely check out Sweet Melissa again."}
{"text":"We brought my mother to Sweet Melissa specifically for happy hour. The two tables that were designated for the happy hour menu were occupied, so we were seated elsewhere. When we asked for the happy hour menu, we were told it was only available at the bar (which was not a possibility because of my mother's back pain) or the two \"happy hour tables\", which had no real distinction from the rest of the restaurant aside from being next to the bar. When we asked if an exception could be made given the circumstances, we were refused.

While the salads we ordered were adequate, this arbitrary business practice left a bad taste in my mouth. If you plan on offering a happy hour menu, creating a distinction of who can and can't order from it - especially if someone's disability makes them unable to sit in the appropriate section - is unprofessional, at best. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"Before arriving at Sweet Melissa's tonight, I really expected I would of given it an 4 or 5 star review, but I'll be upfront in why it's only getting 3 stars. I arrived there this evening and there really wasn't a hostess there to greet me. I came specifically for the appetizers on the happy hour, which is listed as 4-close and learned that the kitchen was closed after I sat down. I arrived a few minutes before 9 and the restaurant is open until 10. 

I did have a bite of the xtra large cupcake that my friend bought. It was gluten free and vegan and surprisingly VERY DELICIOUS! It was an oreo-type flavor and really flavorful and moist. 

I'll come back again in a year (when I'm in Cleveland again) and hopefully get some food and will be able to rate this place higher (I really wanted to!)"}
{"text":"I had dinner with some girlfriends here Friday night.  While my meal was perfectly adequate, I was short of impressed, and I'm not sure I can put my finger on why.  We started with the chicken quesadillas to split and I really enjoyed them.  I then got the pork chops, which were served with green beans and rice.  I will give credit where it is due-the pork was cooked very well.  The sides were unremarkable.  We skipped dessert though there were some cakes that looked fantastic.  Overall, I wasn't displeased, but I wasn't impressed either.  For the price, there are at least 2 dozen other restaurants in Cleveland I'd rather go to."}
{"text":"Excellent food. I have been wanting to try this place for sometime and was glad the opportunity arose last Thursday.    
 I shared the House chop salad with my dining companion for a starter. Very nice composition,all the ingredients melded together well.  My choice for an entree was the braised ribs with mashed potatoes and a small salad of arugula,purple cabbage,scallions,blue cheese,dressed with a creamy horseradish sauce.
What a delicious meal it was,the ribs were fall apart tender. The star of the show was the cabbage salad. It was unique and different and tied the meal together. This is what I like about dining out, I got surprised by a salad I never had before and the meal was better than I could cook at home"}
{"text":"Had a great meal! Meatloaf was excellent ans the crispy potatoes were outstanding. Terrific desserts and a reasonable bill. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Good beer selection for a small restaurant 

Friendly hostess, Service was prompt, everything looked clean and fresh, nice decor, open kitchen so a little noisy

Sprite was flat, but corrected after serviced used another machine

Food was very good

Vegetarian Tofu and carrot fried rice - good size serving for $13.00

Brick chicken - excellent chicken and great lemon zest on green beans, mac and cheese was way too bland

Over all would definitely recommend and visit again"}
{"text":"I have had more than one less than stellar  experiences here as well, & Max's it is not. I will occasionally get take out dessert but i have no desire to eat here anymore. The food is uneven, and I always leave wishing I had gone to Players instead for what i wound up spending. I may come in for some carrot cake or red velvet to go, but i likely won't be eating there"}
{"text":"Breakfast is impossible to mess up, right? Welp, this doesn't hold true when dining at Sweet Melissa.  I ordered the traditional breakfast, eggs, potatoes, bacon.  And everything was ice cold.  And the server was not very pleasant.  Will not be returning.  I really don't understand what people enjoy about this place."}
{"text":"So much potential! Once the kinks get worked out, I'm sure some extra stars will be added. 

The space was beautiful and food was delicious, but service was crappy and our server made excuses for being crappy (she seemed frazzled and mentioned that she was a little out of it because she was just getting back from a trip...we could tell, the coffee refills were sparse, she never checked on us to see how our food was).

My strata was delicious and the portion was huge. I was looking forward to the fruit and mini-scone that come complimentary with brunch. All of the other tables surrounding ours got the fruit scone combo, but I think our waitress forgot."}
{"text":"First time here, we were met by a rude hostes.  The waitress had an attitude.  My wife's food was good no complaints. My hash and eggs were way to salty and we're missing item described in the menu. For the price I would have expected more and correct preparation.  I've had way better at a mom and pop place for far less money. Not a good breakfast spot,we will not go out of our way again to go there."}
{"text":"I stopped here with an old friend on a Saturday morning shortly after 9am. I heard good things about their brunch. I've been to the location in University Heights which unfortunately closed. Meh. I've been there for lunch numerous times but this was the first time at Rocky River and for brunch. During brunch they have a brunch menu available only. Great options. Specialty breakfast items like biscuits and gravy, French toast/waffles/pancakes, breakfast wraps and bagel sandwiches, and omelettes. They feature a Chefs special omelette of the day. Today was crab cake asparagus and cheese. Sounded Devine. I chose Heathers bagel sandwich which came with eggs bacon cheese goat cheese mustard, and fried green tomatoes.First time ever trying those and they were so good! I don't even like tomatoes but you fry anything and viola it's delicious. Now the sandwich is HUGE. Humongous! I couldn't even get through half of it! I didn't even know how to bite into it. I had to start from the top to bottom! It comes with roasted potatoes in ranch topping. All brunch items come with a side of fruit and a mini scone.! 10$! Can't beat that. Coffee is good too which is a necessity for brunch. My friend ate the biscuits and gravy which came with scrambled eggs. It was devoured.
There is plenty of seating here. I was shocked at how big this place is! The other location was so tiny! There are lots of tables and a handful of booths. They accommodated a large party do a great place to bring friends and family. 
I've tried their fried goat cheese salad and their veggie burger with sweet potato fries. Both are delicious and what I would get all the time in the past. I'll try some new option I promise. 
Come early! This place gets packed! I heard Sunday's are very busy for brunch. I got here shortly after they opened and there were only 4 tables filled. Come early and grab a seat, order coffee and some delicious brunch for a great price. It was a nice place to meet up with my friend who I haven't seen in about 6 years. Great atmosphere. Rocky River and it's neighbor Lakewood are great cities to enjoy. Lots to see and do. Even though this is an hour away from me, I will be back"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and cannot think of a single (major) complaint.  They have a great happy hour menu, beautiful atmosphere, attentive service, and good food.

The interior is modern, dimly lit, and intimate.  I've never encountered a wait there.  If you do, they have a small bar, with reasonably price drinks.  
The servers have always been so friendly and on top of it, so no worries there.

The happy hour menu is so cheap!  I believe the portions may be halved, but that's OK.  You need to save room for dinner.  

The entrees are very affordable.  Everything seemed to be in the range of $8-$15, and in my opinion, that's a steal for what you are getting.

The Caesar salad is unique - served as a whole head of romaine lettuce with tons the fixings on top.  The spinach salad is colorful, flavorful, and satisfying.

I am a connoisseur of Carbonara, and theirs is savory and delicious.   There is a Chicken & Macaroni & Cheese entree.  I am also a master of Mac & Cheese.  It was decent.  Not very gooey or stringy, which is what i look for in a good mac.  On another visit, I ordered the Chicken Parm, made with Ohio City Pasta.  I wasn't even in the mood for pasta, but I devoured it.  It was so tasty and the fresh made pasta is a must!  I didn't think the portion sizes were ridiculous, but I've still always left with a to-go container.  

I never order dessert, but you'll see the display case when you walk in and you can't resist.  Everything looks so good!  We tried the Cannoli, and this is my only minor complaint.  I thought it was a bit dry and bland, but what do I know?  It was the second one I've ever eaten.  The chocolate covered strawberries were decadent though! 

Overall, this is a great place for a date night, or any night.  It's what I would consider upscale, yet inviting & affordable dining!"}
{"text":"The food is good, service not awesome, but okay.  They need to change their website to reflect the NEW happy hour prices.  The website says all domestic beers are $2, imports $2.50 and martinis $5.  The NEW pricing is now $3 for SELECT domestic beers, $3.50-$4 for SELECT imports and a \"featured martini\" for $5.  Diappointing if you read the website and the show up and spend more money than anticipated!"}
{"text":"I gave two stars because the description for yelp two stars says \"Meh. I've experienced better\" ...and that pretty much is exactly how I feel. Meh. Disappointed and bummed out. 

I really want to like Melissa's. Everything on the menu sounds wonderful, and I enjoy the atmosphere. The first time that I went there a few years ago, my food was great. 
...But finally, after yesterday's experience I had to ask myself \"Why do you keep going back?\" My two stars is not based on a single experience, but multiple occasions with issues or let-downs every time. I don't want to write a long post complaining about every detail.  I hope they're able to bounce back and get it together. I wish them the best. But yesterday I finally came to the conclusion that personally I've given up."}
{"text":"Extremely slow service, indifferent host, and overwhelmed servers made for a frustrating dinner.  But the food is delicious and well prepared.  Bummed we couldn't stay for dessert because our server forgot to check on us for 15 minutes after our plates were empty.  Nothing worse than being made to wait an inexcusable amount of time when you've completed your meal."}
{"text":"I called the week before and made a reservation for Mother's Day dinner. I showed up with my family and they did not have my reservation. I double checked my phone log to make sure I called the correct location and I did.  There were several full sized tables open but they only offered to seat us at a small one where we had to squeeze in on the ends. They did not have a functioning high chair for my nephew which I also asked for when I made the reservation.  They were saving the larger tables for their other reservations. The problem is, I was one of those reservations!!!! They lost it, not me. We chose to eat there anyway because of all the good things we've heard about it, but it was a terrible experience.  We ordered appetizers and dinner but there was a \"mix-up in the kitchen\" (their words) and our food took over an hour to come out. The server was friendly and the food was decent, but they certainly didn't try to make up for the inconveniences they caused us, on Mother's Day, nonetheless. They should have handled our situation differently as it was entirely their fault that they lost the reservation.  We will not be back."}
{"text":"BRUNCH BRUNCH BRUNCH 
Located in between Rocky River and Lakewood, this is a modern restaurant. The food is delicious, including their own Bakery counter inside!  During the breakfast/brunch hours, you receive complimentary fruit and a mini chocolate scone. If your wondering what to get, here are a few suggestions: grits and eggs, french toast, biscuit and gravy, bagel sandwiches, and if you like quiches...def the quiche of the day!"}
{"text":"Have only ordered take out from here, but it was amazing! The best eggplant parmesan that I've ever had, and the cannoli cake was some of the best bakery I've ever had as well. It wasn't too sweet at all. Perfect. The servings were very generous as well, plenty for two hungry people to share. Everyone there was super friendly too while I was ordering and waiting for the food."}
{"text":"There is potential here, but the service is spotty.  The food is good and the menu is eclectic.  The place is VERY noisy and it is difficult to carry on a conversation.  Maybe it's the management policy to \"feed 'em and street 'em.\" A loud place inspires a rapid turnover of tables- a necessity because of the restaurant's popularity and no reservations policy.
We'll go back in a few months to see if there has been any change."}
{"text":"Why so negative?  I remember when this place was Max's.  It was the place to go after school or when we wanted to pretend to be adults.  I really like this place and have not had any of the bad experiences it seems other people have.  Granted, I don't think their desserts are that good.  I tried their award winning chocolate cake and thought it was kinda dry.  
But I like their other options.  It's simple, good food.  I'm a fan of their sweet potato fries and they have a good salad menu.  My dad loves their crab salad. It has chunks of jumbo lump crab in it.  They have good homemade salad dressings.   Their tacos are a little weak though.  
It's an open space with several tables by the windows that are elevated.  I don't think I would want to sit at a table that overlooks all the other tables.  Kinda like a dictator overlooking his workers.  Granted the service isn't the best but sometimes they try."}
{"text":"Took my daughter to a Sunday Brunch and tried SM on Detroit.. Inside very casual open seating... Fairly crowded server very friendly.  Ordered a turkey avocado omelette and daughter the salmon salad... Took about 20 minutes for food to come out. My omelette was cold over done, I think they forgot the avocado, turkey dry. Omelette r came with fruit cup and  3 potato hash browns which were tasty but again cold. My daughters salmon salad was huge, greens were fresh asparagus peppers , salmon was a bit over done... We also ordered a key lime cheesecake which was also disappointing.. Cheesecake had an unnatural green dye, to make it look lime green. It was also dry and obviously not fresh. Overall the experience was satisfying because of spending time with my daughter but the food was below average and closer to 2 stars  than 3..when sweet is in the name of the restaurant you would think desserts would be fresh... Not the case... Won't be back"}
{"text":"The service is not up to par. I had to grab a hostess to get water. Our waitress was not friendly and never checked on us. She seemed not able to multi task well. Good food but the service needs help."}
{"text":"Every single time I've ever eaten here has been excellent -- they keep their standards high. Even something as simple as a green salad with breaded goat cheese is done perfectly: crisp crunchy coating on the cheese, fresh as fresh can be greens, tasty apples/veg/dressing...you can't beat it. And price-wise, you might think you're getting a better deal buying a takeout salad at Heinen's, but once you go through checkout, you'll find out you might as well have gone down the street to Melissa!"}
{"text":"Holy smokes, this brunch was phenomenal! I had the crab cakes with eggs over fried green tomatoes. Everything was perfect, including the side of crunchy breakfast potatoes and pre-meal fruit salad/mini-scone combo. Coffee's great, too. I can't wait to come back and try lunch and dinner!"}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant twice over the course of week while I was in the Cleveland area. Both visits were equally enjoyable. Our servers were great especially Maeve. Maeve was attentive to our table and always had a smile on her face. The food came out promptly and was awesome. We had the pistachio crusted grouper, the portion was very nice and reasonably priced. We also had the vegetable lasagna and it was cooked just right. We would highly recommend this establishment to any of our friends and family."}
{"text":"My favorite is the butternut squash salad, which has goat cheese and a unique dressing. It's only $7 and very filling. Great service and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Lobster bisque and tomato soup knocked me out!  AMAZING!  Love the chic extra touch of the water served in the etched glass bottle.  We have been there for brunch and lunch and were pleased each time.  I tried the pancakes with cinnamon butter...Mmm!"}
{"text":"Our party of 6 was seated pretty quickly. We started with a couple of appetizers. The Brussels sprouts have potential - they had great flavor but ours were a bit on the greasy & cold side. The dip sampler was very good - our server was quick to bring more bread & our drinks were never empty. The risotto was a hit as was the meatloaf. The brick chicken was only ok - too dry. Steak salad was good as was the short rib. Definitely a repeat."}
{"text":"We just stopped in this restaurant even though it only had 3 stars because we were hot and tired and hungry. So glad we did! The menu was varied and interesting...and proved to be delicious! All of it. The black bean soup was smooth and tasty. The Sedona Cobb salad with a crab cake was ample with a good dressing...our waitress was very helpful. My husband always has trouble deciding what he wants to eat and has loads of dietary restrictions. She was true to her other profession which is a special Ed teacher; patiently helping my husband make a good choice!"}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in the area. Always delicious, always makes me happy -- all I can say is yum! The dessert selection alone makes my mouth water just thinking about it so I truly can't explain why I've never ordered dessert...maybe I'll go get some right now!"}
{"text":"Now here's a place I can rely on to have good food, anytime. Recently, I had planned to try out a new restaurant in the Lakewood area, until that place ended up having a 30 minute wait. Luckily, I knew sweet Melissa's was a good and reliable backup. We were seated as soon as a table opened up. Of course, we had to pass the desserts selection on the way up (how do you pick just one!?). We started off with the calamari - not too shabby. I had the pulled chicken risotto and my mom ordered the kale salad, both delicious. To finish, We shared the most scrumptious red velvet cheesecake and didn't let one bite go to waste (it just went to our waists). The reason I am giving this 4 stars instead of 5 is simply the fact that they didn't have a drink menu readily available, nor did the waiter present us with one. It's ambiance for dinner would have been better suited for lunchtime."}
{"text":"I've been to this location three times as well as the west side location several other times. My meals have always been excellent and better than I anticipated. The dessert is outstanding. Love eating here."}
{"text":"Sweet Melissas is one of those restaurants that you'll either love or hate. 

Personally, I'm obsessed. 

The place is always clean, the staff is always friendly and they honestly have the best bottled water. I know it seems weird. But, they do.

Their veggie burgers are delightful and don't really taste like the normal boring veggie burgers you would get at the store.

Their cannolis are AMAZBALLS! I usually leave with at least 2 or 9. 

Bathrooms are always well stocked and clean."}
{"text":"We ate here about 3 months ago at the bar and it was a good experience. Today our party of 3 walked in and asked to sit at the bar to avoid to wait but the hostess told us that the bar didn't guarantee faster service, that the bar was served by whichever server had time. She was very rude. We decided to give it a try but after sitting for a few minutes at a filthy bar and saw an angry couple walk out, we decided to leave. I can easily put up with waits but why should I put up with a rude hostess! We want to support independents but not sure we will be back here soon."}
{"text":"Sweet Melissa's is a cute restaurant with a great environment.   It is close to some shopping and coffee shops. You can get all your errands done with this one stop. 

The food is okay. The sweet potato fries have a good flavor, but were not crunchy. Just kinda limp. The tacos are good. Those are the best thing I have gotten from here. The guacamole on them is super fresh and tasty. 

Oh. And the desserts are good. Cake was slightly dry... But the chocolate mouse in between is Worth the calories :)

Overall, it's okay. The place is not very clean. Tons of crumbs under the tables. 
I will go if someone else really wants to... But I won't go out of my way."}
{"text":"I think every time I and my friends step in this place we must somehow put on a cloak of invisibility - the staff never sees us (while the restaurant is completely empty) and seats us only we (like misbehave stalkers) start approaching them or following them around. We are that close to developing a complex - do we not look like a trustworthy paying customers or do we look like we already ate? I honestly don't know which one is worse, so please leave my question unanswered. 
Anyway food...good, tasty, but how much? Seriously why am I paying more that 15 dollars for  my tuna salad? At the lunch hour? Do I look like I am on a date with someone who throws up gold?  What is going on with a side of green beans for $4? I guess Obama doesn't pay me enough to afford your fiber. 
Anyway too expensive for God knows what. Plus our waiter was like an extra on a set of \"Pride and Prejudice\". His English accent was fluctuating from fake to very fake and his mannerism was simply disturbing. I guess that's what it takes to sell some overpriced tuna  in a blue collar city. 
Up-side : There is this table on display right by the window. You can sit there and pretend you are in New York. And dessert case - wow. 
Down-side: Expensive as hell, slow unmotivated service, average food."}
{"text":"Food is just okay at best.  Pastries dry, possibly even stale.  The bakery is not made on site. Lunch meals are too much food.  The club sandwich was very dry, lobster bisque was puréed, not a piece of lobster to be found.  Very disappointed!"}
{"text":"Very good dinner! Crab cakes/ Salmon apps all delicious. Very good service. Nice beer and wine selection."}
{"text":"After about a half dozen visits to this place over the last few years, here's my take on what they have going on - the service and kitchen execution are as hit-or-miss as Mark Reynolds circa 2009.

Imagine if they had a menu where the only thing they offered was lemons, sugar, water, and potatoes.  You go there and order the lemons, sugar, water, and potatoes, because you figure that's their specialty.  Sometimes you get ice water with a lemon and a side of mashed potatoes, sometimes you get Mike's Hard Lemonade, and sometimes you get a Lemon Drop made with Kamachatka.  Depending on your expectations and mood, you might enjoy any one of those things one time or another, but it is hard to tell which one you will get during any particular visit.

If you're in the neighborhood, it's worth a shot if you're in the mood for high-concept diner/deli cuisine, but based on my last few experiences, you're likely to end up with a home run, a groundout, and two strikeouts over the course of your visit."}
{"text":"This review is for the desserts only as I have really only bought desserts from this place.  They have fantastic cookies, outstanding triple chocolate cake, etc.   The chocolate chip cookie here is one of the best you will find in the area.  The cookie cost 3 dollars but it is quite large, soft and delicious.   I have to give this place 5 stars for their desserts.......They have a great selection and have not really had anything here that I did not like."}
{"text":"Well that was a disaster!!! Waited over 30min on fried brussel sprouts and butternut squash....I can cut up brussel sprouts and make them myself in maybe 15min min!..hoping for a quick lunch in between shooting a wedding today...not so much...this food better be good"}
{"text":"After seeing this place pop up on my Yelp feed over and over again, I had to go see what it was all about for myself and it was delicious!  The coffee was full in flavor and my cup was never less than half full.  I had the chef's special omelet of the day which chockfull of chicken sausage, roasted red peppers, and goat cheese.  They had me at goat cheese.  It was amazing! The sausage was perfectly seasoned and it balanced well with the red peppers, goat cheese and egg.  Even though I was full, I could have eaten another one just because it was so darn tasty.  The crispy red potatoes on the side, serve with all brunch items, were delicious, well seasoned, and served with a tasty, light cream sauce.  The side of fruit included cantaloupe, raspberries, and blackberries with a small lemon poppy scone served prior to the entrée was a delicious opening to the meal.

The service was wonderful with frequent check-ins by our waitress.  Our coffee cups never went empty and any special requests were filled with no question.  She was pleasant and always smiling.

The place is very cute inside and well decorated.  It really is a great place for a Sunday brunch."}
{"text":"I would give the Sweet Melissa 5 star for the food, because the food is amazing. Everything I have had there has so many flavors, even the soups and salads are to die for. The reason for the 2 star review is the service, it's terrible. Even if you sit at the bar. If you do carry out, double check everything before you leave there will be more then one mistake. My daughter wanted a kids meal it is supposed to include a drink, side and a small desert. The only item they packed was the hamburger. The server acted like it was a huge inconvenience to actually pack what I ordered. And include everything. Maybe this next part was her way or spitting in my food. 

This part I didn't notice till it was too late. She packed the deserts right on top of the hot food. The double dipped Oreo was taped to the top of hot soup. So by the time I got home, chocolate Oreo was melted all over everything. The cheese cakes where in the same melted condition because it was on top of a pasta dish. When I called to complain they hung up on me. 

If you are thinking the service was so terrible because they were slammed... nope, there was hardly anyone in the entire resturant."}
{"text":"Had a real bad experience in this restaurant the server served some wrong food, I filed a complaint to the manager she refused to take any discount off and kept saying its a misunderstanding   I felt totally being disrespected  and start  to think if it has to do with being an Asian because i asked for Canadian bacon but came regular bacon. 
The manager must think that Asian people can't tell the difference and just bring it to the table without an apology
Will never go to this restaurant again"}
{"text":"Close the damn blinds!!! Server was oblivious to the blinding sun. Hostess must have been as well to sit us there at 6:15 PM

Oh and our order was wrong so we had that going for us. 

As usual the food was good. Too bad for the poor service."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch. I got the shrimp salad which, was excellent. I really enjoyed it but it was small and I was still hungry!  For $12, I should have left with a full belly. The service was less than stellar so I can't give it more than three stars."}
{"text":"Where did it go? The brunch menu has been butchered, the customer service is non-existent!!! (although that was never really there before) Spent all morning looking forward to brunch @ Sweet Melissa's only to sit for five minutes with no attention from any wait staff , finding nothing left on the menu that we would have chosen to eat anyway and finally getting up and walking out...

Frankly since they've pretty much eliminated everything on the menu that we ate, we won't be coming back anytime soon..."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot right by John Carroll University. The menu is simple and fairly limited but with super reasonable prices. My eggs were cooked perfectly and the service was great. Would definitely stop by again. 

Parking can be tricky but skip the limited street spots and head for the lot in the back of the building."}
{"text":"One of the most diverse happy hours in NE Ohio. It runs 3pm to 9pm every day (bar area only). Mussels. Burgers. Spinach artichoke dip. Empanadas. Fish and chicken tacos.  wings. Calamari. And even bruschetta.  Ranging from $2 - $5. Plus the drinks....domestic and craft bottles, wines...all $2-$4. I will be back. 5 stars."}
{"text":"I can see why this is a popular destination in Rocky River. The menu is safe, dietary restriction friendly, portions are super-sized, kid friendly, all tied together in a room of shabby chic meets rustic design.

The menu consists of soups, salads, sandwiches, entrees of fish, pasta and fish. The choices are clearly defined as vegan, veg or gluten free approved. The descriptions below each course are well defined--almost too much so-- announcing each and every ingredient involved. For a picky eater, this would be helpful and scary at the same time. For the kitchen, it's got to be a nightmare as I'm sure they often get requests to subtract ingredients from the way too informative menu. Oftentimes menu descriptions drone on for several sentences to describe each meal. In any instance, this is probably one of the main reasons Sweet Melissa is kid friendly, mom approved.

As for the portions, they are certainly geared towards the corn-fed, Midwestern appetite. A plate of meatloaf was the size of a Stephen King novel. My steak was the size of a football. Plates of ravioli and gnocchi were served in bowls the size of troughs. Dessert? Each slice of cake would be enough for Tiny Tim to feast on for months. To make it clear, none of us finished our meals. We didn't come close. Dessert was ordered to-go. If your goal of dining out is to bring home leftovers, this is your place. 

Overall, I didn't see anything above average about this place. The food and service were forgettable and nothing spoke to me enough to want to come back. The best thing about the place was probably the faux copper ceiling. Everything else was mostly meh."}
{"text":"The salads are fun with fun seasonal items like butternut squash. Good food. Worth a try"}
{"text":"My friends were getting tired of me talking about how great Sweet Melissa was so I decided to write a review to share my excitement with you all.  If you are looking for a place to satisfy your happy hour fix, look no further!  Sweet Melissa has got you covered.  Everyday (even Saturday and Sunday) happy hour is from 3-9 PM at the bar.  My boyfriend and I ordered a bunch of appetizers for our dinner: Fried Green Tomatoes, Calamari, Brussels Sprouts, BBQ Chicken Wings and Buffalo Tofu Dip.  All of these except the Buffalo Tofu Dip were $3!! The Tofu Dip was only $2.  Along with the two beers we had (from Platform Brewery!!!) our total bill came to $20.  I believe that is what you call a steal =) Not only are the prices right, but they were all really delicious.  Just go and make sure you order the Brussels sprouts, they tasted just like candy!!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. The ambience is nice and the service was great. I had the Sonja's bagel, it was delicious. My Mother got the shrimp & grits it was good but need some salt and pepper even with the creole sauce. Overall I enjoyed my visit to Sweet Melissa's. I would return again. The mimosas and bloody Mary's."}
{"text":"We've been here several times and enjoyed it. Not sure what was up today, but left after  being seated for 20 minutes and no server. Even asked the young lady who seated us, about our server. She was kind enough to bring water and assured us a server would be with us shortly. 10 minutes later, still no server.  It's hard to patronize a place that pays so little attention to its customers."}
{"text":"I had the veggie burger. It was a huge burger lots of veggies. The seasoning was pretty good. The menu said that they had vegan options, but that really meant they just took all the non-vegan items out. It wasn't a substitution. I probably would come back."}
{"text":"Food: pretty decent. You can tell everything is fresh and made to order. I had the pulled chicken tacos and the guac on it was very good. Reasonably priced and it seems like everything comes with freshly made chips. Which rock.

Service: Meh. Our server was very polite and nice- but did not know how to handle her time. My wife and I weren't in a hurry to be anywhere or anything- but our waitress took so long to get our check and bring some of our food.

Environment: best part about Sweet Melissa's. AWESOME room and cool look to the place. Light fixtures and bar just looked cool. There were a lot of crumbs and good left over under the tables. Kinda nasty. 

Overall: I'd go back! But don't plan on being in a hurry!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure if we came on an off day or why but our food wasn't very good at all and me both my boyfriend and I very sick after we left. Besides that, the staff wasn't very friendly and the food we got was  over cooked. I don't think I'll be back again after we got the bill. We were s not satisfied with the food and service."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner and thoroughly enjoyed our experience. Beer selection was good, menu was unique, food was delicious, service was very good and atmosphere was friendly. Many of the earlier reviews were harsh, probably because the restaurant was brand new and they hadn't gotten their groove yet. Give the place a chance. 
I had the pulled chicken risotto which was quite flavorful! My boyfriend had the butternut squash salad which he says is the best salad he has ever tasted. We also shared the portabella quesadillas that were very tasty. We split a slice of a chocolate cake that melted in our mouths. Our server, Suzanne, was very friendly and had a fun personality. The rest of the staff was pleasant and all had smiling faces! We will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Just about the worst service in rocky river. Too bad. The food is good (usually - but not predictably) but the service is really, really, really bad."}
{"text":"Definitely a really fun place to go. I haven't been in quite some time, but its always a great time when I do go."}
{"text":"3.5 stars here!  My first visit and won't be my last. Had Jenny's grilled cheese, the bacon was super crispy and loved the addition of the fried green tomatoes. It was a tough decision on what to get, everything sounded great!"}
{"text":"food was very good, but the service was horrible. Walked in and a couple was leaving because they waited 15 minutes before a server even came. We sat down and had to wait for over 15 minutes for our check. Very funky staff. After waiting 15 minutes for the check, my server said that she dropped the food I asked to be boxed up to take home and had the food get remade. I believe that this staff is slow."}
{"text":"Went last night for dinner.  This is the same spot as the old Max's Deli in which I was a big fan of.  The place looks really stark and cold.  Server came right over and we ordered beers.  The first 3 beers we tried to order..THEY WERE OUT OF!  More to the fact she told me they were warm..nice.  Seems like they had plenty of wine though..thats Rocky River for ya..   Once we finally got a beer they did have cold we ordered food.  Oredered lobster rav and bacon wrapped meatloaf.  Lobster and the shrimp in the rav had been frozen at one time and tasted super fishy..yuck.  What a waste of good Ohio City pasta.  The meatloaf was OK..needed salt and the bacon wrap was almost non-existant.  Clientele is typical stuffy, conservative Rocky River types.  Mom and kids on Iphones, ignoring everyone and dads looking miserable and trying not to get wine on their tucked in polo shirts..  All in all It was a very forgetable expierince and would try someplace else in the area next time."}
{"text":"This place is very presumptuous, and they missed the mark in many levels not impressed at all"}
{"text":"How hard is it to cross items off the menu when they are no longer served?   XXXXX that easy.
My meatloaf was the perfect  comfort dinner.
Companions seemed to enjoy the  tuna sandwich. Stuffed acorn squash  was tasty but overcooked or over reheated.  Potato leek soup was good.
Waitress was good."}
{"text":"We have given Sweet Melissa's many many chances but I am finally at my last straw. 

We kept coming back because some of the food is very good, and the other food has potential. Good flavors and unique menu options. It is very convenient, and fairly well priced. The atmosphere is nice. Some of the options my family members love so they request it. 

However, the service is totally and completely unacceptable. Some of the people I have dealt with here (not all) are friendly, so I will give them that. But every single time (15x plus) the service is awful. 

Take out - they always get the order wrong (including meat I don't eat, forgetting things, totally wrong order), the food is cold and mushy, tiny portions, and takes longer than expected. One time my side of fries came with six fries. Tiny fries. I suggest that they do not even offer take out anymore since it is apparently so difficult.

In restaurant, there will be a long wait even with open tables (that is, if you can even get the hostess to come to the stand.) The servers barely come to the table and placing an order takes forever. I have sat there for over two hours for a simple meal. They often have not had things listed on the menu. The servers have been rude and seeming annoyed at everything. The check is very slow coming and even slower coming back. One time I believe my server left in the middle of the meal (we never saw her again and had to take the check up to the bar.) They again get orders incorrect or do not bring the proper sides and never come back to check and correct it. The food is cold and has obviously been sitting out for a while. Never refill water or take second drink orders. 

I really wish they would revamp and work on the service. It has been years and I can't believe it hasn't changed. Pizzazz, a few stores down, is a perfect example of good service. I love that place and was just looking for a local change up. Unfortunately I cannot give a place like this my business anymore until this drastically improves."}
{"text":"This place has all the ingredients of a great diner.  Unfortunately it falls short on execution.  I have been pushed to go here 3 times by my significant other - and sometimes you have to give in.  The decor is cool, but it is rather loud in there on a busy Sunday morning.  The coffee is excellent, and I might go back for just that.  At $2.00 it's probably one of the best cups of drip coffee around.  The menu is diverse - lots of options, same with the brunch menu. I ordered the Corned beef hash.  Service was slow, the food took forever, and trying to get someone to take my money so we could move on with our Sunday was tough.

The \"corned beef hash\" - was not corned beef hash, it was large (think golfball) fried potatoes, with shredded corned beef, corn (interesting, but fine), some scallions with a fried egg on top.  I think there was supposed to be hollandaise but I don't recall seeing any.  The problem with this dish is that it wasn't really hash.  It was shredded corned beef over roasted potatoes with an egg on top.  It was very disappointing, and cold.  Just another reminder of every disappointing experience I have had at this location and the rocky river location.

BUT - it's not like there are a ton of options over here, so I am sure this place will continue to do well, even if the customers aren't that satisfied.  They have the ingredients but lack execution and service."}
{"text":"Really enjoy this place. The food is good, unique, fresh and maybe \"pseudo-upscale\" and the prices are reasonable. 

I've been here twice so far. One of my favorites is the house chop salad(has bacon, pecans, grapes, tomatoes,green beans, chic peas, feta and a yummy house dressing.) I will likely be ordering it at least as a side salad every time I go.

Ate half of my girl's Chicken Milanese and thought it was really good. The tomato sauce tasted fresh and the chicken was good. She's more of a comfort food chic than a fancy food chic so she wished she had just gotten a burger. I'm sure I will want to go back so we'll see how their burgers are.

We also shared a piece of chocolate chip cheesecake and it was RIDICULOUSLY good! And I am NOT a cheesecake fan. Tasted like straight cookie dough! And we only got half way through it.

Will certainly be back!"}
{"text":"I waited to write my review for Sweet Melissa's because I came here for dinner with my friend and was very disappointed. We both didn't like our meals as they were flavorless. Then I was told they have a really great breakfast menu and to try that out before I ruled them out. I did come here for breakfast and have to say I was still unsatisfied with the food and service. The service was so slow and we had to wait forever just to get our waters. By time the waitress greeted us we were ready to order.

I had the veggie omelette which was nothing to rave about. The toast was also bad. For $10 it wasn't a very large portion either. On top of that, my boyfriend found a hair in his food. He picked it out and wasn't going to say anything but then he found a second one. So gross! This is the main reason for the low rating. I know those things happen but having 2 hairs in your food is just nasty. The only thing I enjoyed was sitting outside and the little fruit tray and scone they bring you before your meal. I definitely don't think I'll be returning."}
{"text":"I'm sad to say that I'm a little disillusioned with Sweet Melissa's after having breakfast there over the weekend. I stopped in for some post 5K breakfast and had one of the worst meals of my life. No joke. Besides the service being painfully slow - when the restaurant wasn't all that busy - the coffee was either full of grounds or not available. (\"we'll brew more coffee soon\") 

I ordered the vegan tofu scramble which promised to come with a fruit cup, a mini scone, and some breakfast potatoes. The fruit and scone arrived first. You really can't mess up fruit, and Sweet Melissa's has great baked goods, so my scone was tasty. But it all went downhill from there. 

Nearly a half hour later, my plate of oily vegetables and nearly deep fried tofu arrived. With a smattering of potatoes. (4 potato pieces to be exact) At this point I was starving, so I gobbled down my greasy breakfast. I was disgusted with myself afterwards once I saw the huge pool of oil at the bottom of my plate. And to think I'd skipped the pancakes because I thought a tofu scramble would be healthier. Siigh. 

I'm still a fan of Sweet Melissa's desserts and non-breakfast offerings, but I hope they work on speeding things up a little. (Maybe I should have asked to order off the lunch menu...it was nearly lunch time by the time my food arrived) I'd actually planned on making the trek from the east side to meet there for a holiday lunch in a few weeks, but I'm afraid of the kind of experience my group would have."}
{"text":"I've been to Sweet Melissa twice since my original review - once for brunch and once for dinner. I had a tofu scramble for brunch that was ok. Interestingly, they prep a lot of items and use them for different dishes. Meaning, the deep fried tofu in my scramble looked like it was better suited for the tofu tacos on the menu, but...

I dropped in last night for dinner with a group of 6. Service was a little slow, but it was close to the end of the night and there were only two people working the floor. I ordered a roasted vegetable salad without feta cheese. Bonus points for my waitress who was able to confirm that the salad would be vegan without the cheese and then later told me about vegan desserts.  

My salad was interesting but good. It wasn't what I expected. There were breakfast potatoes and roasted vegetables (like what I'd had in my tofu scramble...hrrrm) on top of a bed of arugula with a few long pieces of asparagus on top. It wasn't the best salad I've ever eaten and the roasted vegetables were pretty greasy, but...at least it was a substantial meal?

Everyone else I ate with loved their meals - and we ordered everything from salads to veggie burgers. I'd definitely go back to try out some other easily veganized options on the menu. 

Pro tip: Wednesday night is 1/2 off wine night - if you don't finish your bottle you can take it home with no corkage fee"}
{"text":"Moved up here 6 years ago, made it a habit of coming here atleast once a month. I keep coming back because the food is out of this world! I am addicted to everything On the menu. BUT. Over the last year I have received continual Terrible customer service. It's actually amazing how terrible their service has become. I have always celebrated birthdays and family coming in town here and now hesitate to bring anyone here. The servers are rude for the exception of 1 or 2 people and I almost am embarrassed and uncomfortable when I have guests here. Extremely disappointed. Waited for a long time to write this review but I'm fed up. Will continue coming to satisfy my cravings but the visits are much more far and few between- and most certainly don't include any out of town guests."}
{"text":"I've been here many times, but my rating is based on the average of my visits. Overall, the food is good and I love the location. I definitely understand the two and three star ratings because I've had those experiences here as well.

Most recently I came here for weekend brunch. We didn't have any problem getting a table at 10 which was a nice surprise. The menu had so many great options. Some items were combinations I haven't seen at other restaurants which is cool. It took me awhile to pick a breakfast spot since there was going to be a baby in our party and this ended up being a good spot for a baby. Many other people had babies and small children the morning we were there. The atmosphere is lively inside which helps cover excited baby coos. 

Breakfast starts with a small fruit dish and mini scone. It isn't huge, but I like that they bring something before the meal. Why don't more places serve breakfast appetizers? Great idea. 

I had the Shrimp & Grits which was delicious. There were plenty of grits and a nice portion of shrimp. The sauce on the dish had the nice kick I expected from the southern dish. On the side were fried eggs and breakfast potatoes which helped blend the dish into a breakfast dish. 

My husband had Biscuits N Gravy which was a twist on the usual since it was made with chorizo. The chorizo was really good and a twist that worked well. There was a plentiful portion of gravy with fresh baked bisuits. It was nice that the dish was served with eggs and potatoes as well. 

One of the perks of this spot is that they are good at accommodating food allergies. This is always at the top of my list when dining with a friend that has special dietary restrictions. The menu highlights items that are gluten free and the staff is good at answering questions about other concerns.

The service is definitely hit or miss. This is the only thing that I would change if I could. I'd like to see them have consistently good service."}
{"text":"Pretty sure everyone nails it with the \"great food, slow service\" comments so I would like to echo that. 

I usually come here on lazy week days with my mom. We've have not once been disappointed in the food and usually have quite a bit of time to kill. I  get the veggie burger more than I like to admit- if you've never had a homemade veggie burger they are SO SO SO good and taste nothing the store bought ones that resemble the flavor of the boxes my Amazon orders get delivered in. I've also had some of the tacos and salads too. My friend swears by the grouper entree. Like I said, I've always been very happy with with the food here. 

Also. They have fresh brewed iced tea that is super delicious! I highly recommend trying it if you are an iced tea fan. 

Not that this is the slowest restaurant you could ever stop in but it's definitely not the fastest. I would definitely recommend checking out Sweet Melissa's if you're in the area"}
{"text":"This place is a hit or miss. When it's good, it's very good! Barbeque pulled pork sandwiches, black bean tacos, delicious gnocchi. But then, it can also go too bad too fast. Many friends I've dined with have been less than pleased with their food, and the service can be spotty. 

Either way, the decor is to die for, and I'm happy to risk a bad plate in hopes that it's a hit night."}
{"text":"Nice space. Menu clearly tries to cover a bit too much. Brussels sprouts appetizer was almost overdone, but I prefer them that way. Crabcakes were fine, nothing special. Great selection of local beers. Certainly would come back and try again, especially the generous happy hour at the bar."}
{"text":"4 stars, almost 5, for the goat cheese salad and fried brussel sprouts appetizer.  Friends had the chicken salad, risotto, bacon wrapped meatloaf and butternut squash salad.  The winner was the squash salad out of that group.  Their salads are very creative and well planned.  The chicken salad is huge and again, creative.  Everything is beautifully plated.

Stay away from dessert!!! It's shocking but that big dessert case is holding beautiful but dried out cakes and pumpkin cheesecake was very very average.  Tested manufactured and maybe old?   On desserts alone, it's a one star stop."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my meal at Sweet Melissa. Their take on the farm to table was good. They had a some interesting combinations, and I  loved the fact that they had a separate Gluten Free menu.

The GF menu had a decent selection. There were six beginnings, 6 mains, and 5 salads without scones to chose from. I opted for the blackened shrimp salad and a side of butternut squash. The portions were huge. The salad had a great kick to it and my sinuses were cleared. The squash was excellent. It was mixed with cinnamon and cranberries. For dinner I opted for their Pumpkin Creme Brûlée. It was a nice twist on a classic with a mix of some fresh fall flavors."}
{"text":"We were prepared for bad service after reading the reviews but we love Sweet Melissa's food so after a hard day, decided to go. Much to our surprise, the service was prompt, thoughtful and cheerful. Perhaps older reviews were correct but after our own experience and observation of other customers - all happy - we believe the staff has changed and everything is running well. And the food is still great!!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of this place. The atmosphere is great, service is good and the food is exceptional. My favorite is the pulled chicken risotto. Give it a try if you haven't yet!"}
{"text":"The food is not the issue with Sweet Melissa... Everything I've had on the menu is amazing and their desserts are to die for. It is so noisy in the actual restaurant. My husband and I could not talk to each other without screaming across the table. The service was slow and servers were inattentive each time I've been there. But the food is so dang good I don't think I can stay away... Just is not the kind of atmosphere I prefer."}
{"text":"Poor service...waited 20 minutes to sit when there were plenty of open tables then sat for another 10 before a server case over."}
{"text":"There customer service is horrible. In august u called this so called bakery/ restaurant to pick up a cheesecake for my daughter birthday and I was told very roundly that at 10 am they had not 1 single while cheesecake to purchase and next time to call 24 hora ahead if u want one. So in July only because my daughter lives the plain cheese cake I called at 9 am to order a cake for the next day for a 4 pm pick up  and was  now told if I want a cake I need to order 47 hours prior . When I tell her what I was told a few months ago and I'm calling a day and a half prior to when u need it she stay silent and I think she hung up so I say hello to check if she's still there and she says with that bitchy tone is there anything else you need . Wait what is Business  so good that you don't care that I'm calling HEINES again and they jump over fire to put an order for you within the same day. That will be the last time I eat or ever pick up food there ever again . I give and spend my money where it's welcomed and appreciated."}
{"text":"The 4 of us headed here on Saturday after checking out Shaker Heights Famers Market for breakfast/brunch- yum! The wait staff was excellent! (Attentive, pleasant, perfect with our orders!!)
Our Eyes were bigger than our stomachs, so we ended up bringing some stuff home.... but we tried Michelle's wrap - scrambled eggs, black beans, roasted corn, charred tomato & white cheddar; Nutella French toast; waffles;  a seasonal bowl of grilled salmon, eggs, edamame, and crispy potatoes . Everything on Saturday is served with crispy Redskin potatoes, fresh fruit and a mini scones... All just delicious, but those potatoes were awesome! We'll be back! ( they have a nice patio out front!)"}
{"text":"One of my favorite brunch spots! The breakfast potatoes are always cooked perfectly (I get mine without the ranch) and I am never disappointed. Pancakes are huge! Mimosas are delicious as well. I love it here and always look forward to coming back to visit."}
{"text":"Sedona Cobb Salad = happiness any day of the week. 

It is a salad that i crave. And one that i will venture all the way from downtown cleveland to Rocky River - on a whim, or in a blizzard just to enjoy. 
(Flat iron steak, avocado, tomatoes, bacon, scallions, roasted corn, sharp white cheddar, tortillas, and chipotle vinaigrette tossed with romaine lettuce) - i think it is the chipotle vinaigrette that has me hooked. 

Everything else on the menu is wonderful as well. Mango Iced Tea = refreshingly wonderful. 

And the treats .... well just know that you will not go home unsatisfied! 

Great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"This is a cute place that's a lot bigger in the inside than it looks like it would be from the outside. My friend and I sat on the patio and enjoyed the beautiful weather and people watching. She got the shrimp and grits, which were AMAZING! The shrimp were cooked perfectly and the seasoning was prefect. Not too much, not too little. I had Heather's Bagel which had scrambled eggs, bacon, fried green tomatoes and cheese. It was good but nothing spectacular. Kind of bland really. 

But the servings were large and came with fresh fruit and mini scones. The scones were great and the fruit was nice and ripe. The only downer was the service. We never got a coffee refill and we only saw the server when he took our order, cleared our plates and gave us the check.

Bad service is always a major tick off of score for me, which is why this place scored 3 stars instead of 4."}
{"text":"I swear some of my out-of-town friends come visit just because they know I'll bring them here for brunch. Melissa's breakfast food is definitely wonderful, but you will wait forever for it. On a busy Sunday morning, you can tell that they need a few more servers. It is sloooow. Four stars for the food, two for service."}
{"text":"Went to Melissa's last night...DELICIOUS!  The boneless ribs were amazing!  I had the fish tacos...yum.  We topped it off with gluten free cake.. Jamie was our server.  She did a great job! We were so pleased I know we will be going back soon."}
{"text":"I heard about sweet melissa at the Cavs game while advertising the Cavs's \"local favorites\". Sweet melissa was their favorite organic kitchen. I decided that it sounded right up by alley and with no protest my boyfriend and I trekked up with high hopes. 

On first impressions alone, I loved the atmosphere and decor. The main reason for our visit was the promise of gluten free vegetarian food. This is the only part of the visit I would rate as 3 stars. Normally, I'm a magnet to \"organic\" type places because they have more gluten free and/or vegetarian options. However, there was a handful of vegetarian options, only 2 that were gluten free. 

Despite the lack of variety for my unique situation, the food was FABULOUS. I had the grilled portobello  and wild  rice and I loved every bit. The portion size was also the ideal size as well, for once I didn't feel overwhelmed by the amount of food in front of me. After dinner, I was pleasantly surprised to find that they had gluten free desserts, which again were to die for. 

Overall, a great experience and I can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"You can't go wrong here! Every dish I've ever had has been awesome... Not to mention their decadent and unique desserts. Awesome management and staff, too!"}
{"text":"Love this restaurant!  Great vegetarian & vegan options, always great service...It is where we take most out of town guests as an easy \"go-to\""}
{"text":"Four stars because the food is really good, even though service can be quite slow at times.

Atmosphere: This spot had a nice, large dining room, and large front windows. Honestly that's all I remember but it is very open and inviting.

Service: Hit or miss here. Sometimes the food can take a really long time to come out. I have always had good experiences with servers, but on my most recent visit the food did take a significantly long time from when we ordered.

Food: I really enjoy the food here. On this particular visit we came for the happy hour menu. I ordered the buffalo tofu dip and sweet potato hummus and opted for gluten free crostini. The tofu dip is on point. It had the tiniest kick to it, but keep in mind I don't do spicy, so it may not seem like a kick at all to most. The sweet potato hummus was also on point, with just the right blend of sweet potato. For dessert, I indulged in peanut butter chocolate cheesecake. It was good, not excellent, but it hit the spot. 

I really want to check out the brunch here on my next visit. Make sure to check out their dinner menu as well, and order the Brussels sprouts"}
{"text":"A nice place for lunch/dinner. The food is decent and prices reasonable. Although, some of the dishes had a store-bought feel to them and the 2 soups we had were way too salty."}
{"text":"No idea how good the food is because we've been here for 40 minutes and haven't seen it. I asked for the toast that comes with my omelette to come with the coffee because my companion and I were starving and the waitress only brought it half heartedly after I asked a second time, 30 mins in. Hopefully the food will make this worthwhile but I'm growing increasingly skeptical."}
{"text":"I've had this review sitting in my drafts for months and months. And guess what? I still recall my delicious breakfast at Sweet Melissa. My brother, sister-in-law, baby niece and I grabbed brunch on the patio and it.was.delightful. 

Even though some time has passed, here are the to be noted notes...

-Service: Was very friendly and sweet. And considering we were one of the first diners there on a Sunday morning, our food came out quickly and was piping hot.

-Folded eggs: YUM. Creative mix ins and generous portions. 

-Bacon: Crispy perfection. There are fewer things I loathe more than flaccid bacon. There was none of that here.

-Peanut butter chocolate chip pancakes: Yes, Virginia, they do exist. And hot damn they are tasty. 

-Roasted potatoes: There's an aioli drizzled on these taters that was super flavorful.

So, yeah. I ate my face off at Sweet Melissa. I bet you will too."}
{"text":"I had to give this 3 but 3.5 is fair. Their brunch is a strong 4 stars though! The service is good and prices are ok but the dinner menu is pretty bad. It all looks great on paper but in person... Well, breakfast is really good at least :)"}
{"text":"I agree with Alyssa...kinda hit or miss. I've been here twice, and had two rather separate experiences. 

One night we came for dinner. The prices kind of annoyed me for the quality and quantity of food (did I mention quantity?), and the service was just okay. I don't love the big open room effect, and our table was immensely close to the tables on either side. Also, based on where the host/hostess booth is, we sort of floated aimlessly until we saw the sign (it's near the back door). 

The next time we visited was for brunch. The prices seemed more reasonable to me and our server was fun and pleasant. It was a good experience, better than the time before, but something about this place just doesn't jive with me. Maybe it seems kind of impersonal. 

Anyway, I think I might come back again for brunch, but the dinner prices aren't justifiable."}
{"text":"I've been here three times, and the third time is a charm. Now, what you need to keep in mind it that I've only ever been here for brunch--never lunch or dinner.   I don't even remember what I ordered on my very first visit, but I remember not really liking it and telling my friend that it was kind of weird.  The second time, I ordered the abc omlet (gala apples, applewood bacon, white cheddar)--ehhhh I really didn't care for it.  I'm thinking it was the apples. Wasn't bad, just wasn't something I would be interested in ordering again.

When I went there this past Saturday, the waitress told me it was a new menu. I opted for the south of the border omlet (chorizo, poblano, charred tomato, cilantro, cheddar). Omg. yum. I was so craving it the next morning...and the next.....it also came with two potatoes and some toast. Lots of food. So good. Can't wait to go back and order it again. I also had a blood orange mimiosa--also good.

It seems like the place can get pretty busy, but luckily I've never had to wait--It seems like they turn the tables pretty quickly so you really don't want to wait long.

I have never had the opportunity to order any dessert from here, which I'm sure I'm making a huge mistake every time I leave without some.  They look AMAZING."}
{"text":"Delicious and appreciate the menu as a vegetarian in the Cleveland area. Enjoyed the veggie pad thai. Simple, clean environment, appears to be an old store front shop converted into a restaurant, but the stars are mostly attributed to the food."}
{"text":"Just discovered this great place from my CLEseats app. I saved 15% off my food with the app. We had the brick chicken which was very tasty and the pulled chicken risotto bowl. They were both amazing. The menu had so many choices and everything looked good. Will have to go back."}
{"text":"So happy you're now in Avon Lake! This new space, which was formerly Donatos pizza, is small, but adorable! Kinda slow on the service but they'll work that out."}
{"text":"1st time there and was really good. Had the pork belly bowl. It was very tasty and good size portions. Since I've moved, I've tried to keep up on joints opening up and etc... the next time l'm back or after I move back, I will definitely return to try other things."}
{"text":"Breakfast today was amazing!

Coffee in big cups, which were regularly topped off.  Complimentary white chocolate and cranberry scones and fresh fruit.  French toast with fresh berries and cinnamon pancakes (super fantastic wonderful).  With real maple syrup at nbo extra charge.  Oh! I almost forgot to mention the breakfast potatoes with a white sauce of some sort that were over-the-top!  All for under $20.

The server  could have been a little more cheerful, but it was Saturday morning."}
{"text":"Brunch is amazing and very reasonably priced with crazy large portions. I've tried the salmon bagel and the veggie wrap with chorizo (of course id unveggify a purposely vegetarian meal) and both were delicious. Came with fruit and potatoes..much needed apps as the food does take awhile to come out. One star off for service....they are all very pleasant however need to hire more people. Poor girl was running around waiting 10 different tables and couldn't tell us much about the available alcohol options.   Def want to try their dinner sometime!!"}
{"text":"Sweet Melissa is a great place. I've been multiple times for lunch and brunch only. The space is cool and the staff is always very friendly. I went today for lunch with my mom and sister. My mom and sister both got entree sized salads and they were huge! I got an appetizer size of the Warm Goat Cheese salad and the soup of the day, which was a creamy chicken tarragon dumpling soup. Both were fantastic! The goat cheese salad was amazing! I've been dreaming about the warm, creamy goat cheese ball for the rest of the day. They should sell them as an appetizer, SO GOOD!"}
{"text":"Sweet Melissa's is my favorite restaurant! I'm constantly craving food from here, and can't seem to get enough of it! The atmosphere, lunch menu foods and, best of all, dessert really tie together to make something sweet.

The atmosphere of the restaurant is very airy and light, and really reminds me of a restaurant that would be found in California. Every time I've eaten here I had the apple and goat cheese salad or the mac and cheese. I'd love to try the other food they have, but those two are so good that I can't bear to get anything else! The desserts are to die for! I'm a self-proclaimed cupcake connoisseur, and this restaurant makes some of my favorite cupcakes. I especially like the Oreo or strawberry cupcakes, they literally melt in my mouth. This was also the first place I tried creme brulee, and I haven't found a place since that makes a comparable one.

When I have something to celebrate, Sweet Melissa's is where I go. I can't say enough good things about this restaurant, and will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"We arrived about 9:30am this morning, and the restaurant was not busy at all. Our server came right over and took our drink order. After quickly delivering our drinks, our server NEVER STOPPED BY AGAIN. After an hour of trying to flag our server down (she kept walking by, but continually ignored our waves and \"excuse me's\" by looking right over the table, refusing to look at us), we finally walked out. We told the hostess that we were leaving and WHY we were leaving, and she seemed completely unphased. The food looked great, but we will never be back to try it. Very, very disappointed with this experience."}
{"text":"Gonna go ahead and label this place the bomb for breakfast.  Food is good, portions ginormous, and they say it's mostly organic/local.  I ordered a side of bacon here once and I swear it was about 1/2 a pound.  Quiche changes but my only gripe is the menu doesn't change at all with the season :( ahh well."}
{"text":"Awesome breakfasts. Potatoes with sauce is best. Really tasty choices make any selection a good one. Carolina grits not bad for the North."}
{"text":"This happy hour is the most severely overlooked happy hour I have ever been to! My best friend brought me to this gem of a spot!! I debated on whether or not to leave a review Bc I fear that if I leave one and people go there to try the food, the place won't be able to keep serving such amazing happy hour items. You guys, I got $3 crab empanadas!! The food is worth more than it's weight in gold, it's that good!! Please check it out."}
{"text":"Very cute place! Really great food and amazing bloody marys! I had the kendra bagel and it was great! Their potatoes are probably the best part of their breakfasts! Service was great and didnt even have to wait on a saturday morning! Definitely recommend for a great brunch!  I really want to try a mimosa next time!"}
{"text":"Given the option, this would probably be 3.5 stars to me.  Sweet Melissa is a large open room, full of tables that were steadily full when I was there.  A few elevated tables sit in front of the large windows at head of the restaurant, overlooking the street outside and the other diners inside.  There're also a few benches outside in small fenced area.  The restaurant's high ceilings have gleaming, old-fashioned decorated tin panels on them.  And the place is rounded out with worn wood furnishings and warm, friendly staff.

The food was pretty good overall.  The appetizers are excellent -- a friend and I had fried green tomatoes and (my favorite) fried brussels sprouts (nicely charred outside and full of flavor).  The entrees and desserts were good...but I could happily have dined on more appetizers.  The portions are pretty hefty also.  (Even of the appetizers -- beware!)  There's a good selection of bottled microbrews, and overall, the prices are okay [about $30 for app, entrée, beer, dessert]."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch on a Sunday morning. Large portions of good food, decent service (for a busy brunch), but no booze. WHAT?

Pros:
- The food was really tasty. I had a Greek omelet, and it was one of the few ever that actually had ingredients in it. Plenty of feta, olives, and spinach to keep me happy - in fact, it was more like a frittata than an omelet. Still, delicious. 
- The potatoes are an interesting take. I think they're fried - but whole, and with a slightly spicy ranch sauce. I loved them, while my wife did not.
- The space is quite nice - copper look ceilings, big open room with lots of light - I could certainly enjoy a dinner here too.
- For those that care, plenty of parking in the back.

Cons:
- Our server was, admittedly, slow. It was a busy morning, but he was probably slower than the average. That said, he was a nice guy who made sure our son had ample to drink and even brought him a little bit to snack on while we waited. That means a lot.
- No drinks on Sunday morning. Server said it was a state thing, but others told me it was a \"not the right license\" thing. A brunch without a bloody mary? Terrible idea!"}
{"text":"I keep trying to like this place because it is convenient when I don't want to go to the pizza place. It always seems to fall short though. Today had artichoke heart app...this was ok, although the batter reminded me of a funnel cake.  For entree had grilled veggie salad. Looked good, but was so oily that I could not eat. Read: oil slick on your tongue. I think they sautéed them, whatever there process they were neither grilled nor good. Hubby had risotto , he had no complaints. They did take my veggie salad back and removed it from the bill. Service was delightful. Very sweet server."}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting the Rocky River location. I'd previously been to the University Heights location and I'd always enjoyed myself. That location has recently closed, so I decided to give the Rocky River location a chance because I had a gift card. 

 We went around 1 o'clock. There was a good crowd and we were told there was a 15-minute wait. I was a bit annoyed because a group of the same size that had entered after us was seated first. 

Once we were seated, I ordered the pulled-chicken risotto. I'd had it before at the University Heights location and enjoyed it a lot. This time, I thought the food was a little bland. 

Our servers were great and the wait for our food wasn't long. The restaurant's facilities are nice and there are a lot of options on the menu. 

I'm giving three stars because I wasn't totally thrilled with my meal. It was decent, but I've definitely had better. I probably won't return to Sweet Melissa which is a shame because I really liked the University Heights location."}
{"text":"As usual the food was very good but as usual the service was terrible. We have been here @ 10 times over past 2 yrs, the food is always fabulous but wait staff is horrific. Service is slow, an attitude like it is the end of the world to be serving you and in correct bills. I once emailed manager and never rcvd even an acknowledgement, guess they don't care either. And for what's it worth, my wife and I are not complainers. Everyone has a bad we get it but now it has become a joke of what type of terrible service will we have this time. To bad because again the food as always been good."}
{"text":"I had a great experience at Sweet Melissa's today. I ordered the tofu tacos, and they were fantastic. The tofu was spiced well and fried to perfection. I could have lived without the house made chips though, I thought they didn't really go well with my entree. The service was fast and courteous. I took a piece of the mint chocolate chip cheesecake home with me. It was heavenly. My only complaint, everything on the menu was a bit pricey. With my soda and tip, my lunch was about $35."}
{"text":"This was my second time visiting and had a decent experience. Our service was rather slow, but the food was phenomenal! From the fruit and scone small plate dropped off before our meal, to the steak and eggs for brunch; I couldn't ask for a better prepared and delivered meal; bravo to the chefs. 

But when service is slow, the best thing that comes out of it is more time to converse, face to face, With the people you came with. So put the phones away, order the pineapple mimosa that you will not regret, and order anything off of this basic brunch menus, yet tasty on every bite.

Helpful tip: the restrooms are in the back left directly after the server station"}
{"text":"Tried Sweet Melissa's again hoping that things had changed in almost a year. Unfortunately, nothing has changed. The North Park location is a  great place for a restaurant to open. Maybe someday?"}
{"text":"Table next to me full of dishes and very dirty floor! Food was good, no bread and no crackers for soup!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times and keep coming back for the food but I wish service was better. 

The food is worth it but the service is SO SLOW. 

There is one or two waitresses for the entire restaurant. I love coming here but man, can't you find some speedier wait staff? Who actually remembers our drink orders. 

Food is on point though. Brunch was delicious!! Two stars for service. Four stars for food."}
{"text":"This place has really good food and the presentation is always very nice. No complaints there.

The service on the other hand is always suspect. The employees seem to be in a bad mood with each visit. No one is ever smiling or appear to be happy that you are visiting their establishment. 

I give the food 4 Stars and the Service 3 Stars. Maybe the morning staff is just not awake on sunday mornings just yet. I have not been here any other times."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch this morning. It was pretty good and really cute inside. Also our service was not nearly as bad as what I had read. It was slower but every table was full. The only reason I gave this place a 4 was because I wasn't that impressed with my corned beef hash. There were several things on the menu I wish I would have gone with instead so I would like to give it another shot. Great Bloody Mary though. The mix was definitely homemade! 

Tip: get your corned beef fix elsewhere."}
{"text":"Had not been into Sweet Melissa for a long time so decided to try it for breakfast.    Wow!  What a great decision.   The breakfast potatoes are amazing and the French Toast might be the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"My son, fiancé and I stopped up at Sweet Melissa's for a celebration breakfast (I proposed the night before!) a few weeks ago on a Saturday morning. We like the small business feel of Rocky River and my fiancé recommended this place for a nice breakfast. The interior was very pretty with a rustic, homey kind of feel. The display case of treats in the restaurant had our mouths watering before we sat down.
 
The brunch menu was clean and fresh and it was nice to see that they had multiple options but we settled for breakfast items. Our server was a younger female who was friendly but not over bearing, which was a relief. My fiancé ordered the corned beef hash, my son had the pancakes and bacon and I went with the biscuits and gravy with a side of bacon.
 
The mini appetizer or fresh fruit and a mini scone was a refreshing start the to the meal that we all enjoyed. My fiancé was very impressed with her meal as was I (and I'm not a huge corned beef). My meal of the biscuits and gravy kind of threw me off. I was expecting white gravy (not specified on the menu) but it came with more of a southwestern spicy gravy, which was awesome! The \"biscuits\" was actually one LARGE biscuit (which was a little dry) in a bowl covered  the tasty gravy. I happen to hate eggs which happened to come with my meal but I was pleasantly surprised that I ate more than a few bites (the best eggs I have ever had to be honest). The star of the plate weirdly enough was the redskin potatoes that had a warm white drizzle that was out of this world. The bacon was crispy and my son loved his pancakes as he always does (3 year olds are easy).
 
Sweet Melissa made a very good breakfast for us and although it's a little on the pricy side ($55 for 2 adults and 1 toddler) we will definitely be coming back. Next time I will probably give the French Toast a try since the pancakes were so good! Bravo!"}
{"text":"My friend recommended sweet melissa's, but after I read the reviews on yelp I was a little weary.  But this place was wonderful for brunch.  They were pretty busy on a Sunday morning, so service was a bit slow, and my bloody mary was more water than vodka or tomato juice, but being a vegan, it is difficult to find breakfast food you can eat.  They had several options on the menu that I could eat, including a tofu wrap!  Yumm!!!  
Substitutions are not accepted, as my waiter, kind of rudely pointed out to me when I tried to get sweet potato fries instead of the breakfast potatoes my dish came with.
The dessert case looked amazing!"}
{"text":"Not a fan of their brunch menu, but love their lunch dinner menu.  Wonderful salads, especially the goat cheese and apple or the crab cake.  Also love their brussel sprouts.  I'm a regular and will continue to be.  My only complaint is the noise level- if they added something to absorb some of the sound to the tin ceiling, it might help."}
{"text":"Had Mother's day breakfast here. I ordered the corned beef hash, hubby got the crab Benedict, and mom ordered the south of the border omelet. These disheds were phenomenal! Maybe you're wondering why I only gave 3 stars instead of a 5. The stars were for the food, not for the service. I know you can't hurry good food, but I felt that the servers were spread thin and not attentive enough to the needs of their guests. We have eaten here for dinner as well, and we had the same untimely service. I hope this is something that the management could look into soon. We would love to be regulars to this place, but we will wait and see what happens."}
{"text":"My sister and I were feeeeeeling crrraaabby.  We wanted sunday brunch !  and we drove to Sweet Melissa.  When we walked in, the hostess was attentive and funny and we all shared a laugh (i don't recall her name- it was 12/15 @ about 12-12:30).- And we got seated right away!  Within just another moment our server Sal came to greet us.  And we just wanted to say how much we enjoyed his service!  He was attentive, sweet, funny and never overbearing.  We both ordered the Crab and Eggs and it enjoyed it very much.  Very good experience."}
{"text":"Full Disclosure:
After my last update, I was contacted by SM and offered a comp to give them another try.  I really appreciate that kind of response from establishments because it at least demonstrates recognition of issues, and a willingness to try and make things better.  We were finally able to take them up on the offer- here is my updated-updated review:

First the good news - This trip to Sweet Melissa's was better than the last one.  The menu has been redone to incorporate some of the newer dishes, but it has brought back some of the old favorites.  This is a step in the right direction as it brings back some of the character that was missing on our last visit.  

Unfortunately, other than the updated menu, there was still a lot of room for improvement.  The first hiccup was asking for a high chair for our daughter when we were being seated.  We were brought to our table, the hostess said she would get the high chair for us, then she left.  We waited for a few minutes, and saw her back at her station, so my wife went to grab one herself.  

After we were seated, a server took drink orders and they came a few minutes later.  There was no silverware on our table, so when my wife's coffee and cream came, she had to go to the bar and get a straw to stir it with. 

Our server came back to take our orders, and my first choice (the brisket and egg sandwich) was unavailable, so I went with the Jenna's grilled cheese- an old favorite from the previous menu.  

The wait for the food was longer than expected, but not awful, but it wasn't until my wife's side of fruit was brought out that our server noticed our lack of silverware and got some for us.  

When our food did come out, my wife's order was incorrect - her breakfast burrito was made with tofu rather than eggs.  Once we told our server, she apologized and had a new one made relatively quickly.
My sandwich was pretty good, though different from how I remembered it (different bread, maybe?).  The breakfast burrito was sizable, but kind of bland, though the breakfast potatoes were just as good as they have always been.

I'm a little torn about this review because it seemed like there were some situational factors that may have impacted our visit.  There was some kind of gathering (a baby shower?) being prepared for, and the staff did seem preoccupied with that.  There also appeared to be only two servers handling the entire restaurant.  Maybe someone called in sick, maybe the others were tied up with the event prep- I don't know, but had there been some more staff available, maybe things would have been a little better this time. 

This is one of those situations where I wish there were half-star ratings because three stars is definitely too many for today's visit, but two seems a little stingy, especially since it's very possible that most of the issues we had on this visit may have been purely situational.  I've elected to go with two, mostly because there were enough things off about this visit that we were still kind of bummed when we left.  There seems to have been positive progress since the last visit, but at the same time, that visit set the bar pretty low.  

I don't want to write Sweet Melissa off completely, because when they have their act together they are a great place to eat.  Just keep in mind that based on our last two visits, there's still some work to be done to get back to what we loved them for."}
{"text":"DId not just get one breakfast, but ordered the side of bourbon french toast. Had to wash it down with their bloody mary. What a delightful experience! However, the waitress threw down the cups, bowls and plates down without grace. Luckily the food didn't fly around."}
{"text":"I used to be in the restaurant/bar business, and in many different capacities; from bartender to bouncer, from waiter to cook.  Because of these experiences I tend to be more patient with restaurant workers than most people, but the service I endured at Sweet Mellisa the other morning really pissed me off.

For starters my wife and I joined a group of five for brunch, and it took about ten minutes before the waitress came over to take our drink order, and then another 5 minutes for her to get it to us.  Now the dining room was busy, but I have always lived by the rule of getting the guest their drinks before anything else, it puts them at ease; and they had four or five people waiting tables, so the amount of customers to wait staff ratio wasn't awful.

At one point during the meal someone knocked over some coffee creamer right in front of the waitress, she completely ignored it, no biggie, I'm an adult I can clean it up, but... Then a little later I knocked over a cup of coffee (this really speaks to how cluttered the tables are) and a busboy and waitress were standing there and just staired, I got up and grabbed my own napkins from the bar.  Once again, I can clean it up, but a well trained wait staff grabs napkins and attempts to clean it up.

It was odd because it wasn't like our waitress really appeared to be busy, when she would go missing for 8-10 minutes it wasn't like we saw her running around the floor helping customers, she was no where to be found!

I had two eggs, potato's and bacon.  Lots of bacon, two eggs, and two little potato's?  Really, two potatoes?  

Now you may be wondering why I gave three start if my experience was awful, well the food tasted great!  It wasn't real hot, because I assume that the kitchen staff isn't real proficient (only assuming based on how poor the wait staff was trained),  but tasted good none the less.  I was shocked that it tasted as good as it did, granted I had the most basic breakfast of all.  I tried someones french toast and it was to die for, I wish I would have ordered it!

Good food, terrible service, and a lot over priced based on portions.  For a place owned by a former waitress of Max's I can't believe how bad the wait staff was.


Will I go back?  I'm sure I will be in Ohio again and will want to give it another shot.  I assume the rest of their menu tastes just as good.

Sorry for beating the wait staff dead horse."}
{"text":"The fish tacos are good EXCEPT for the tortilla....it was wimpy in texture, and totally tasteless. They could re-think the tortilla....make it a deep-fried one or ??"}
{"text":"I have had a few things here. I don't think it is that great, or that bad. The interior is very open and bright. A lot of families were here. A lot of little kids running around and yelling. Their rich parents too engulfed in eating desserts to control them. The service has been pretty good every time. The strength in this place is that everything is pretty average. You can't really do wrong coming here and ordering something."}
{"text":"The food is decent but the wait staff is consistently does the minimum necessary and the food consistently takes a long time to come, even when they aren't very busy. We've given it a few tries, and we won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to checking out Sweet Melissa's after trying to find some good brunch places in the Cleveland metro area, but I was a little disappointed with the brunch. I got the biscuits 'n gravy which is my go to brunch/breakfast meal and was looking forward to the chorizo instead of traditional breakfast sausage, but I personally didn't think there was much flavor to the dish.  The crispy red potatoes were extremely good and probably the best part of the meal. The mini scone that you get was also very good, not sure if they make them fresh daily. But it tasted fresh and delicious.  I also tried their grits which I know can be hit or miss at restaurants, but they were ok. Not the best that I've had. The prices here don't seem to be too bad for brunch. The mimosa was also very good, but when isn't a mimosa good with brunch. I'm bummed that it's not going to be my go to brunch spot, but I would definitely come back to try lunch or dinner and see if that's good. The atmosphere was nice and the staff seemed pleasant."}
{"text":"My family comes here whenever we go to visit my grandmother in Rocky River. Sweet Melissa has always been excellent, and very accommodating to dietary restrictions. I'm a vegetarian, and my sister-in-law is a celiac (gluten-free).

The food here is excellent, the wait staff is great, friendly, and welcoming. The menu offers a good variety of interesting vegetarian fare, as well as clear labeling of gluten-free options. They're quite careful, and my sister-in-law has never had an adverse reaction from eating here (and we'd know).

Atmosphere is pretty cool, trendy, but not obnoxiously so. It is comfortable and casual, but you know you're in a nice place.  Prices are absolutely fair for the fare."}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I love meeting here for breakfast. Food is always great and the breakfast potatoes are to die for! The service is consistently a bit slower when checking out (about 20 minutes). I would suggest you have a cashier checkout instead of the servers doing this. It would make for a more pleasant experience. See you in a few months."}
{"text":"The fat kid in me is always incredibly torn between having sweet or savory for breakfast. At Sweet Melissa, I did not have to choose and it was glorious. Each breakfast item seems to be accompanied by an adorable mini-scone and fresh fruit dish. I can have my cheesy, salty, bacon-y breakfast fix and have a cupcake on the side if I damn well please.

The bacon is crisp, the breakfast breads are fresh, and the dessert case is dreamy. I had a bacon, egg, and cheese bagel with fried green tomato and goat cheese mustard. It wasn't too greasy and the goat cheese was a surprisingly nice touch.

I did sneak a few bites of my friend's ABC (apple, bacon, and cheddar) omelette, which had a good combination of flavors, but tasted pretty basic otherwise. The potatoes in some kind of voodoo-gravy really blew me away though.

We'll be back. The service was great, the coffee was delicious, and I can't get those cute mini scones out of my head."}
{"text":"I have eaten here SEVERAL times over the course of two years and not once had a great meal.  The service is awful -- be prepared to be there two hours at least every time you go there.  The wait staff could care less if they have tables.  The food is OK at best, had moldy lettuce in my salad yesterday and VERY over cooked fish, which was 18$.  Went in to eat at 7 pm and left at 856 pm -- there were only 5-6 other tables in there.  Waited over 20 min just order a wine after waiting 10 min to just get seated.  I will not be going back , this was the last straw.  It needs lots of work -- and a more friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place after a recent discovery of it in my neighborhood, and the fact that it shares my name. 

The menu is worth exploring. I had the fried green tomatoes & grilled Caesar salad. My daughter chose pepperoni flatbread with a side of basmati rice (odd combination, I know). 

Everything we ordered was high-mediocre. Great ideas, though perhaps not the best execution. Service was very quick and friendly. 

I will try this restaurant again, but will go for a more well-rounded entree instead."}
{"text":"Yes, Amy, the fries are the bomb here. That is no lie. The space is very welcoming and chic. The ceiling is gorgeous!  It almost mirrors the vibe of Erie Island across the street, but a little more rustic. I had grouper  tacos with mango salsa and a Rouge xmas ale. Grouper was way too peppery, but otherwise a decent piece of fish. Was it worth twelve bones? Nah. Service was nice, soundtrack was traditional holiday stuff(i'd expect something a little hipper), and the water was served in a fancy bottle(a nice touch). I would go back if i was in the area around lunch time again."}
{"text":"Cleveland's brunch game is on point so to shine you have to be better than just good. Sweet Melissa's delivered a brunch that was disappointing at best. There are certainly brunch places in Cleveland that run a much smoother operation.  

There was no host at the door when we first walked in and it took him a couple of minutes to get over to us. When he did, without any welcome, he informed us there was a 30 minute wait (it was around 11am on Sunday). 

While we waited we decided to get a drink at the bar. The bar seats were completely full, but the bartender wasn't actively busy when we approached. Still his pace at making one Bellini and three Bloody Mary's was very slow. I did enjoy my Spicy House Bloody however, which is altered from the traditional non-spicy House Bloody with a few drops of Tabasco ($7). 

Once seated, the slow place continued to be evident. The waitress at the table was slow at all points of service and the kitchen was slow in sending out our entrees. The waitress did not demonstrate competency of the menu items and had to check with the someone to confirm the answer to nearly every ingredient question she was asked which further delayed the process. 

All brunch entrees came out with fruit and a mini scone. I was impressed by the fruit - it was all edible and ripened to the correct point. The mini scone however was about the size of a golf ball and the texture was wrong. It was appropriately dry, but tasted very...chalky. Honestly, the scone was so small Sweet Melissa would be better skipping it all together instead of presenting what they did. 

For my main I got the crab 'n eggs. The eggs were supposed to be over easy eggs. Mine were, but my friend who got the same entree had eggs that were over hard with no liquid yolk to speak of. A kitchen should be embarrassed to not have a quality or consistency check so as to allow two identical entrees that look completely different to go out. For how fast an over easy egg cooks, that entree should have been redone. Eggs aside, the crab cakes were decent and the chipotle aioli flavor was good. Of the two fried green tomatoes I was served however, one of mine was thick and hard and not as enjoyable as the other. 

If faced with a brunch decision again I don't think I would pick this place. I want to say I'd return for the crab 'n eggs again, but if I got the crab 'n eggs my friend was served I would be sorely disappointed. I certainly wouldn't wait 30 minutes for it."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good. Sweet potato fries were awesome! The mahi fish tacos were very runny which made them messy to eat but tasted good."}
{"text":"My family, a friend and I went to Sweet Melissa's this past Sunday for brunch. I was completely shocked at the horrible service. We waited so long after ordering that the manager came over and apologized, and we hadn't even complained. The server was a terrible mess, never apologized or even checked on us, though. And the \"complimentary\" scone they brought out to us with some fruit was the strangest looking and most terrible scone I've ever eaten. And when we looked around, no one else in the restaurant was receiving their food, either. We ended up noticing some cousins of ours at another table and they said they had been waiting even longer for their food and the manager had not come by their table. And, when our food finally arrived (1 hour later) it was cold! I'm sure this was just a really bad day for them, but man did it not make me a fan."}
{"text":"Lunch.  3/19/2013

I sat at the bar between lunch and dinner for a late lunch.  Service was prompt in the beginning.  Since the bartender was also the server for the whole restaurant it slowed to a crawl when a couple more tables showed up.

I ordered crispy calamari for an app.  It was tough and chewy.  Not a great way to start my meal.  Next I ordered the chop salad with no tomato.  Wow.  What a delightful salad.  Huge chunks of homemade bacon with grapes and so on.  And the salad dressing was to die for.  I'd go back here just for a salad.  I finished my meal with a Key Lime Tart.  The crust was soft and oxidation had set in on the entire exterior of the dessert.  Tasted pretty good otherwise.

Overall it didn't wow me.  But the salad was good enough for me to want to go back."}
{"text":"Sweet Melissa is such a great addition to this area! I grew up around here and I go to John Carroll and I love having it just a step away! They have such amazing salads, and outstanding entrees. The roasted vegetable salad and the warmed goat cheese salad are my 2 favs! I also recommend the baked eggplant parmesan, the only pulled chicken tacos, acorn squash, blacken crab cakes and the burger. 

They also have a great corned beef hash for brunch.  If you're in the mood for something sweet, they also have amazing Oreo cheesecake and chai tea lattes!"}
{"text":"The food is good, I should get that out of the way. Nice simple menu not overwhelming, and the prices are pretty good. I've been here 3 times now, and only once did I receive a great waitress that was attentive to the tables she had. The other two times not so great. The one lady I knew about and avoided as best I could, had to ask her for things multiple times and the restaurant was fairly empty that day. Today, the waitress I had I literally only saw twice when she took my order and when she brought my food, waited for upwards of 15 minutes for her to come back. Needless to say she never resurfaced, had to ask another waitress to bring my check (which happened to be the one I had to repeat everything too prior) she spoke to me as though she was trying to brush me off., Be careful of who your servers are, you could get shafted"}
{"text":"It saddens me. I fell in love with this place when I moved here 11 years ago.
Something happened - not sure when, but it happened in the kitchen. I have stubbornly tried three times in the past year and a half to give it one more try. Alas, to no avail.
Fancy and exotic recipes, but the taste is extremely bland! The tomato bisque tastes like an opened can of crushed tomatoes, the matzoh ball soup does not hold a candle to Joe's (on Wooster). I had a pulled chicken risotto that was so flat. I guess best way to summarize is that it seems the kitchen lost the key to the spice cabinet. Lots of pretty, locally sourced food stock but no spice, no soul."}
{"text":"This is my second trip, and I am SO happy to announce it was as great as the first!  Tonight was just a stop for dessert.  But lots of it... Samples on a friend's tab!

The key lime tart was the perfect balance of sweet and tart, with a hint of cinnamon in the crunchy base.  The chocolate mousse cup was creamy, rich, and delicate.  

Tried the creme brûlée as well.  Phenom.

Does NOT get any better.  Chuck was a super attendant waiter, with lots of personality, which added to the experience.  This place is going to start to be a regular rotation- just maybe after a good workout!"}
{"text":"I really need to start going here more often. The B&B Bloody Mary is handsdown my favorite bloody mary in the cleveland area. I cant seem to get past their corned beef hash. I literally get it every time, even when i tell my self im going to order something different, i still end up getting the hash. However, Everyone else i go with seems to enjoy their meals too. I have yet to hear something complain about their food. Always a great experience at the Melissa. Service is always on par. 

Ps. I put their homemade ranch on everything. (by everything i really mean their potatoes)"}
{"text":"I go here for lunch on Fridays when I'm in the neighborhood.  I go alone.  When I enter, the servers at the bar look at me but never speak.   Eventually, someone will decide to seat me.  Since I'm alone, I'm treated like a second class citizen.  Even though I go at a non-busy time, it takes forever to get waited on.  I order my salad, which I have to admit is pretty good, and while I'm eating it the check comes to the table.  I interpret this as code language for 'hurry up and get the hell out of here'.   I sent an email to management about the rude way I'm always treated (months ago) but still haven't heard back.  If things don't improve, I'll have to choose a new lunch spot."}
{"text":"Went with a group of friends. Was bummed out to find no alcohol on Sundays. Service was just ok....definitely needed to understand the menu better. The food did redeem the other things. I will give it another try.

Went back this Sunday. Got the pulled chicken risotto. It was awesome!  Such great flavors! Great comfort food entrée! 

Ordered the pumpkin sage gnocchi to-go for mom. Had a taste of it tonight....wanted to steal it from her! Yummy !"}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to give Sweet Melissa's a second try when my sister-in-law was in town. Husband and SIL both wanted breakfast and I was wanting lunch, so it was the perfect place to go. Our server was very friendly and helpful to me with vegan accommodations. My husband ordered steak and eggs, and my sister-in-law got crab and eggs. They were both very pleased with what they ordered. I got the sprout salad w/ no cheese or bacon, and the tofu lettuce wraps. Both were AMAZING! I loved the salad so much that I started making my own version. The tofu lettuce wraps were so delicious. The coconut added fantastic flavor to the ginger. I'm drooling just thinking about them. My lunch was very filling without being heavy at all. I loved it, and was so happy to go to a place with tasty vegan options on top of the normal menu. The atmosphere was still a bit loud for my taste, but the food was well worth it. 

The one thing I wouldn't recommend here is breakfast. All the lunch/dinner options I've had have been great! However, every time we've ordered breakfast, it has left much to be desired. I recently ordered the ABC omelette and it was really kind of gross. It was an interesting idea that was not executed well at all. The \"toast\" that came with it was basically just greasy bread. The best part was the potatoes. Again, everything else from here has been fantastic, but I cannot recommend this place for breakfast."}
{"text":"Longest wait ever! Took 15 minutes for a waitress to come....and that's only because we asked the hostess if they forgot about us. Another hour to get food! And there is a wait out the door. Maybe they should serve their customers and their wouldn't be a wait!!"}
{"text":"Still a fan of this place, however, the past few visits, service has not been stellar. Kind of slow even on a Sunday evening with the restaurant being half empty.  

Despite some of the other reviews, I think the food is great. Went this time hoping to get the seafood salad, however, this was taken off the menu for summer. Sadness. However, this did force me to try something different and I did enjoy the tuna nicoise salad instead. Pretty presentation, fresh tasting, nice dressing.  I still think its strange that the salads come with a scone, but I'm not complaining. I like finishing the meal with a little sweetness! 

$42 for two dinners with an appetizer. Kinda pricey, but the food selection is wide and almost everything tastes excellent. This is a great place for those times when you don't know what you want for dinner but know you don't want to cook. Everyone can find something to enjoy."}
{"text":"A friend and I ended up here Sunday morning for some brunch. The place is super cute inside! We were seated right away in a spacious booth, which was really nice since there was a small cramped table right next to it that they easily could have put us in. On the way to the booth, we both salivated as we passed a huge dessert case filled with HUGE cakes, tarts, and cannolis.... MMMMM (didn't have any, but plan on going back for some).

They had 5 dollar blood orange mimosas, so we each got one. I'm sure mine would have been delicious had I not been too hungover to drink it. I took a sip and handed mine to my friend - it was her birthday, of course she HAD to keep drinking HER hangover off. :) I liked their coffee and the milk shooter I got for it (legit came in a shooter glass, kinda adorbs).

I got the Michelle's wrap (eggs, black beans, corn, tomatoes, cheese). I thought it was ok. It was kind of bland. I added some salt and asked for hot sauce to add some flavor. It came with a side of potatoes with peppercorn ranch which was pretty good. The dish also came with a bowl of fresh fruit which i really enjoyed and a mini scone (legit... mini... I couldn't find it at first in the fruit bowl) - I'm not a fan of scones, but I'm sure it's great if you are. My friend got the Heather's bagel sandwich and the lobster bisque. She RAVED about the lobster bisque and enjoyed her sandwich as well.

The service was OK... she was really friendly, but whenever we asked for something there would always be a long delay. It took a while to get my hot sauce and my food started getting cold by the time it came. 

Overall, this place is OK. pretty average food. Nothing I'd write home about, but nothing I'd send back either (not that I ever really do that.....) I will probably return to try some of the lunch menu - it looked pretty amazing."}
{"text":"As most of the reviews have said, the downfall of this cute little restaurant is the service- which was awful. The waitress was not friendly at all. The food isn't bad and the menu selection is pretty large for brunch/lunch. Prices are decent too."}
{"text":"I come here often. If I'm in the mood for a salad the warm goat cheese is amazing! My go-to is the pumpkin sage gnocchi, also with goat cheese, highly recommend. My last visit I got the pecan crusted grouper. The portion was a good size, took half of my meal home and was just as good the next day. If you have a sweet tooth, check out their desserts, they have something for everyone,"}
