{"text":"A great little find while passing through the Strongsville area. You can't go wrong with a place full of locals and this was it.  Tons of food for the low prices, good coffee to wash it all down. Gets a little crowded at times and the tables are close together."}
{"text":"You know the old saying \"follow the old people to breakfast\". Well in this case DON'T! The old people taste buds are not what they use to be. We simply just did a take out. I had an cheese omelet with a side of bacon, home fries and toast. My wife had an egg, cheese, sausage croissant with side of cheesy home fries. 1) my toaster broke at home so I wanted toast real bad! Well lets say the one thing that is of course is missing is the toast. I did get the jelly though. 2) The home fries in both dishes were not seasoned and very little cheese on my wife's. 3) the sausage on the croissant was so small, it was like the ones you buy in the frozen section at the store. It only cover half of the sandwich. Normally they would put two on them. On the other hand the food was a good portion for the price. I don't know maybe because I ordered at 1pm (they close at 2pm) that the extra effort was not put into it. Others have had it good, so take my with a grain a salt. I just know I wont be back there again!"}
{"text":"don't know what the draw is,slow service,runny eggs and undercooked steak. how do you screw up breakfast? !"}
{"text":"Never again will I visit this place. Every time I have ordered and gone to pick up the order there's something missing. This last attempt I waited for 10 minutes while they attempted to just find the bill in order for me to pay and was assured that everything was there and they checked it twice. Nope! That was the last time I'm going hungry at lunch because they screw up."}
{"text":"no b.s. fast service, food was very quick and done right, great prices, everything a no-frills diner should be"}
{"text":"What difference should it make to you as to the age demographic of the clientele??   Is that going to make your dining experience less enjoyable??  Were you planning on hitting up a Millenial over your coffee and toast?  Review the place based on service, quality of food, atmosphere and price.  That is the best way to help Yelpers  BTW:  been here numerous times. Rarely have to wait long for a seat,  nice menu and specials, food is always warm and tasty, prices don't break the budget  ( note:  that is why seniors eat there ) and you never are rushed."}
{"text":"Best home style breakfast place for miles! Service is always friendly and food comes out super fast, favorite breakfast spot by far!"}
{"text":"Pretty standard diner-style breakfast fare.  Staff was friendly and attentive, meal served hot and quick.  I had a pretty standard breakfast platter consisting of two eggs (any style), choice of meat (bacon, of course), hash browns and toast.  I added a coffee as well.  Everything was cooked just to my liking and the coffee kept flowing.  Best part about this place?  The price!  Very reasonable for a full breakfast and drink, will definitely return when in need of a quick fill-up at breakfast time."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to this restaurant last Sunday. I had seen it on some enews page and it looked enticing.  We had to wait a short time, place was very buy.  The food was great and the server very good. Extremely polite and helpful.  We will go back often.  Larry Schroeder 3-9-18"}
{"text":"In Cleveland area with my wife.  We were visiting here from California.  Stopped in for some breakfast.  Service was great and the food was excellent.  Seems like our server (Aida) had just taken our menu when she came back with piping hot food.  We both were full and walked out of their for under $20.  Wow!"}
{"text":"Would love to rate zero stars if that were an option.   Never in my life have I received such poor service. Not rude, not annoying, just non-existent. Sat at a table patiently for 25 minutes waiting to be acknowledged, offered coffee, ANYTHING really...but the two waitresses who were not even close to being what I would describe as busy went about their morning quite leisurely and made sure to never make eye contact with anyone; always turning their backs to other people in their section who they didn't want to serve at that moment.    My wife's family lives in the area, and after my experience here this morning, I can assure you that none of us will ever come back. I am still shocked that such a place could even be in business."}
{"text":"The food is delicious and service is fast. My recommendation is the corn beef hash and the french toast"}
{"text":"I made a stop in at Jennifers one afternoon for a quick take out and wasn't sure what to expect. The parking lot was packed, so I thought it might just be a good place to catch a bite. I ordered the eggs benedict. It came with hashbrowns and they definitely didn't skimp on the hollendaise sauce. I have to say it was awesome. it was packed correctly and still looked like it was just made when I returned home. Quick and friendly service. I am glad I stopped by. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"This place is always very busy when we go for breakfast on a weekend.  We stopped going here for a while because every time, they would seat us in the back, where there are a bunch of little tables jammed together against a wall.  Nothing like being able to listen in on your neigbor's conversation without even trying, and vice versa.  Now, we just ask for a booth and are willing to wait for it, though it's usually not for very long.  Anyway, the food is good, the service is fast, and the staff are very friendly.  The biscuits and gravy are really good (lots of gravy). The corned beef hash is canned, which is not a problem, and a whole lot better than some of the homemade stuff that I have experienced recently.  I don't think I have ever had a runny egg here, either.  We will probably continue to come here from time to time, though it is disappointing to read some of the reviews about what a jerk the owner is.  You almost hate to put more money into the pocket of someone like that. But Karma will get him at some point........haha."}
{"text":"Food is great. Gyros are amazing. Never had anything I didn't like. Good portions and reasonably priced. Make a point to come here every time we're in town."}
{"text":"The food is always good here and the service is great but the guy who owns this place treats his staff like total crap. Today I witnessed him yelling at a waitress in front of half the restaurant. It wasn't the first time I've seen this kind of arrogant shit show at Jennifer's.  I'm not sure who he thinks he is but his ego has finally spoiled my appetite."}
{"text":"The food was good, sausage links were delicious, coffee was fresh. The waitress was very kind and attentive to our needs for refills. We arrived on a Friday morning, right after they opened, and a handful of folks came in and out - seemed to be regulars. If eat here again just to have the sausage links. Good place!"}
{"text":"What more can you want than your typical breakfast items & at a bargain price?   The man's dad always says \"Follow the Old People to find the best breakfast\".  Well dad, you're right!  There's always a ton of old people here & a good breakfast to boot!  Today I enjoyed for a whoppin' $6 a huge plate of french toast, two eggs, and three slices of bacon.  Really?  My friend had a plate full of pancakes, two eggs, and three bacon slices for $4!  A steal I tell ya!  The coffee is cheap coffee...but this is a diner style place, so I don't expect amazing joe.  It will do for you, I promise.  Add cream & sugar & you'll never know the difference. (Okay, you probably will, but its better this way.)  This is one of the few good breakfast places around.  They have lunch too.  The servers are always nice too.    Stop on by for a little inexpensive start to your morning."}
{"text":"This food was amazing, breakfast wonderland and cheap. The food came way faster than I thought. It's right next to the 80 so perfect if you want a stop off the highway"}
{"text":"I am a huge breakfast eater, and this is by far the best place around. If you go on a weekday, you will get your food within 10 minutes; however, the weekends are another story. It is crowded (especially on Sunday's) with a ton of old people but the wait is never extremely long. My usual go-to is a specialty breakfast (that is a dollar more on weekends compared to weekdays) that contains scrambled eggs, home fries, bacon and toast; yet the omelets, waffles and pancakes are just as delicious. I would highly recommend this to any breakfast lover."}
{"text":"Wow! This place did not disappoint. We stopped by for our first time on Fathers Day. We waited in the itty bitty waiting room with a ton of other people for maybe 15 minutes. The hostesses did a great job of keeping the flow of people in and out. Hats off to them for keeping smiles on their faces while the same people check on their wait time over and over again. We were seated at a 2 top and we were immediately greeted by our server. She was on top of providing stellar service throughout our visit. I ordered the veggie omelette with extra cheese with home fries. The omelette was soooo good! It had a ton of vegetables and the perfect amount of cheese. The home fries were just \"eh\". They didn't have a lot of flavor and the consistency was similar to chunky mashed tatos. My husband ordered a eggs with home fries and bacon. Everything came out perfect. He cleaned his plate! We were both impressed with the food and the service. It reminded me of family owned little diner. I'm looking forward to going back for lunch! Yum!"}
{"text":"We have been there a few times, I actually worked there when it was \"Manners\" Big Boy years ago. First...A better breakfast menu than Dennys!, yes, seniors know where to get a decent meal for a good price, (experience), yes the beverages ARE expensive like most places, that's how they keep the price down on the meals/specials, the skillets are super!, most servers fast and good. kinda wish they were open for dinner, but that's not their thing. will go there again"}
{"text":"The service was good, it's that quick smart-a#* vibe, but they took care of us.  The food.....the eggs and sausage were fine. The french toast - it had some odd flavor, like baking soda. They definitely prepare it with more than bread dipped in egg /milk. It was very orange yellow all the way thru, like they use a mix to dip the bread in. I couldn't eat it. My companion tried and said the same thing. Weird taste."}
{"text":"Stopped by here to get breakfast on our way to the airport and was pleasantly surprised! Contrary to the reviews, the service was fantastic. We were seated right away and had drinks within seconds of sitting down. I had a Belgian waffle and the home fries, which are both great. The home fries are not traditional, they are more like fried mashed potatoes. My mom ordered the Irish hash with eggs over easy. Both meals were out in under ten minutes-maybe even less. It was delicious! Highly recommended for a quick, home style meal."}
{"text":"Great food and such a friendly place.  Was searching for a breakfast spot and found this amazing gem!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to get breakfast potatoes.  The are just like the ones my mom used to make.  I always get breakfast, and have never been disappointed.  Every time I go, I get an extra order of the potatoes.  Saturday's is usually when I go, and one of my favorite people there is Christina, she is adorable, cute and has a beautiful smile.  I try to go 2x a month if not more.  I love this place."}
{"text":"Another diner-like place with solid food and reasonable prices The servers are fast and quick to refill your drink. Club sandwich and rueben are good choices for lunch. Nothing spectacular, but I would go there for an inexpensive meal without worrying about the quality of the food."}
{"text":"Took my dad here this morning for Father's Day and the line was out the door. I expected a long wait but we were seated in less than 5 minutes and our food was out shortly after we ordered. Our waitress was wonderful and the entire staff seemed as though they genuinely loved working there. Ive never left a review on yelp, but my experience this morning made me download the app and give a very well deserved review!"}
{"text":"The breakfast is the best in Strongsville hands down. The wait is never long but normal when I go they do have a crowd. The service is excellent which is a must for me anytime I'm spending my coins. I haven't been throughout the restaurant because I'm normally seated in the front because it's just me, but it's always clean. This is definitely a spot to visit anytime your near or rolling through Strongsville."}
{"text":"My favorite spot for breakfast near Strongsville. Food comes out in a few minutes and is always hot and fresh!"}
{"text":"Simple, fast and the price is right! 2 eggs, 2 slices French toast and bacon for $5 ... you can't best it! My husband ordered the egg Benedict florentine and it was delicious too!"}
{"text":"Outstanding!  You can tell they use fresh ingredients.  Pancakes were homemade.  Will go again."}
{"text":"This was a great breakfast! Perfectly poached eggs, crispy bacon, home hash brown thingys that were browned nicely... The server was awesome and so kind. She already knew what I needed before I asked for it. Will be back."}
{"text":"Overall this place was good.  We were here for a Sunday morning breakfast first time.  I ordered a Denver Omelet, didn't realize this was listed 2x same name different places (specials/regular menu)  It would have been nice if waitress offered a choice for clarification when taking order.  Oh well. 3 it is. Oh yea...Morning rush should not decrease performance of staff.  Isn't this your business?"}
{"text":"We actually stopped in after landing at the airport and it was a great place to have a quick,  simple,  yet  hearty bite  to eat and catch up with company.  There was a very short wait for how many people looked to be waiting,  and the food doesn't take long.  I was also pleased with the attention of the staff,  my  omlets,  and the coffee.  It's nothing fancy but  quality service and food,  so you can't ask for much more."}
{"text":"Good coffee, good food, nice staff!   We will be back!!!  I had a mushroom, spinach cheese omelet Hubby had Spanish omelet and a side croissant   Both good!"}
{"text":"This is a pretty popular place in Strongsville for the breakfast and lunch crowds. Everything I've had here is good and at a decent price.   The only bad thing I can say is the that the French fries and home fries are frozen. It's a little surprising when Everton everything else tastes fresh."}
{"text":"Food was awesome! We showed up at 11 am on a Sunday and they were slammed but the service was  quick and smiley. Prices were reasonable and the coffee was great. I was VERY hungover and this was my golden ticket for the 3 hour drive home."}
{"text":"Me and my family  find a time during the week to visit Jennifer's. The food is actually pretty good and you can't beat their prices. My daughter thoroughly enjoys their full French Toast platter which she eats completely. And although they seem to be busy most times, their service is spot on. I would definitely recommend this place to any of my friends."}
{"text":"Typical breakfast selections - egg om lets, french toast, skillets, etc. Food is good, service is fast, clientele is mostly over 65."}
{"text":"We're on a road trip from NYC to Detroit and found this restaurant on Roadtripper then cross referenced on Yelp. Arrived a little before 2pm and ordered some to-go food because we had our dog with us. I don't know what is going on with the guy who owns this place but he seems pretty abusive. We were out in the back of his vast parking lot with our dog who was drinking water out of a travel/collapsible dog bowl, and he came out about two times to yell at us about picking up the bowl. Meanwhile no one was in the parking lot, as the restaurant was closed and patrons were only leaving. He even walked halfway out to (I don't know!) throw it out. Blueberry pancakes were bomb. They were a little stingy with the grilled chicken on the salad though. Btw the owner is probably the guy with the red Porsche adjacent to the restaurant. I can't imagine working for him."}
{"text":"After reading the other reviews here, maybe I should have spoken up when the cashier asked, \"How was everything?\"  My response was, \"Fine\", what I really  wanted to say is, \"We'll never be back\".  Maybe our visit was a fluke?  Everyone else seems to think the place rates 4 stars or so.  We visited at 8:30am on on Tuesday.  Would that make a difference, rather than busy weekend when they're at the top of their game?  Though at this point I don't think I want to spend another penny to return on a weekend.  Why waste a good morning with a mediocre breakfast when there are good breakfasts around?  1.  The coffee is just ok, and it's served in noticeably tiny cups, but the waitress came around often to freshen it, so on the upside my cup was always warm.  On the downside, the little creamers are made from fake cream with a label that reads in bold letters, 'No hydrogenated oils', or something of the sort.   Mmmmmm.....  Yummy!   2. Our food was greasy, greasy, greasy, with a side of more grease.  My fellow guest and I ordered our hash browns crispy, but instead they came out soaked through with some yellowish oil product.  We love our spuds, so to have them ruined was extremely disappointing.  3.  When ordering I had a premonition to ask for my rye toast un-buttered.  Sadly, I bit my tongue without voicing my request.  Too bad  =(    Each plate of toast came out with a glob of un-melted faux butter product atop the already grease saturated toast slices.  All 3 of us scraped off the excess butter-goop and tried the best we could to de-grease the soggy toast we were left with.  Ugh.  4. Our food came out in stages.  The first guests plate came out, then 5 minutes later the other 2 plates appeared.  It was awkward, watching the waitress off clearing other tables between setting down guest #1's food, before returning from the kitchen with the other 2.    5.  Food was inconsistent.  Clearly that morning the kitchen staff didn't care what they were sending out.  The bacon slices on our plates ran from perfect to blackened.    Normally I'm a very easy eater, but this breakfast was disappointing to both me and my guests.  Due to the 4 star reviews here I may give it another go.  This time I'll be asking if they have real cream for the coffee, or at least milk, rather than the faux cream.  And I will be asking for plain toast with the butter-like-product on the side, or maybe none at all.  And I won't ask for any preparation requests, like crispy potatoes either.  I'll experience their traditional preparation and report back here.   But don't hold your breath."}
{"text":"Probably the best breakfast place in the Ville, so get there early on weekends. Fast, friendly service at good prices. You get FOUR pieces of bacon or sausage with the standard two-egg meal for $5. That's double the meat and $3 less than Bob Evans. I usually get the skillet, but substitute the green peppers for tomatoes or the sausage for ham. Yum!"}
{"text":"My family and I went to Jennifer's at 8:30 on a Saturday. We had a table of 11 and that seemed to immediately throw everyone for a loop. Let me first say, my Denver skillet was delicious. Based upon that alone, I would likely go back. However - the staff was so rude I felt incredibly uncomfortable. A number of waitresses stood by our table and held a conversation about us loud enough for us to hear. It wasn't a nice one either. When we asked if we could rearrange our seating to fix their complaint they said to do so. Once our meals came we had another issue about missing bacon. The waitress did not subscribe to the \"customer is always right\" theory and was rude to the girl in our party inquiring. When it came time to finally gather our things and leave, we had a number of children and the parents were getting coats and hats on them. I was still seated at the table and they started pulling apart our tables. I was still sitting there!!!  Food was 5 star. Service -0. I took the average and gave them 3. Sorry Jennifer's. With your reputation and packed parking lots, I expected much more."}
{"text":"Okay this place almost got a full five for extremely fast service and cheap and filling food but we did have a couple problems with trying to lasso our waitress. Also the times are kind of disappointing, if this place was open 24/7 hours I would definitely go for a 1 am French toast kick."}
{"text":"This place is one of my local favorites. It has officially become that spot that my family goes to when \"Something good/exciting/fun happens, and I absolutely love it.   The coffee is strong, they have a wide selection of breakfast foods, and for those of you that like mixing and matching your own way, they also have a great al a cart' menu. I usually always get the eggs and pancakes, and it always hits the spot. Plus, it's a comfy, cozy kind of place, so you know that you are going to start your day out right by going there."}
{"text":"Have been in the area for 7 years and never tried this place so I thought I'd give it a swing today.  The reviews here seemed to trend towards good food, bad service.  I prefer going into a situation expecting bad and seeing how it goes from there.  For me, the place has a very old diner feel to it where I could see the staff having \"regulars\" and not really caring too much about drop ins.  In any case, I had zero issue with the staff.  My waitress, Shannon, was very nice and attentive; granted I was there near their opening time and there were only a few people in the place.  Regarding the food/drink: Coffee was good, with a bunch of breakfast specials.  I ordered and my food came out pretty quick.  I ordered the 2 eggs, 2 sausage, 2 bacon, and 2 pancake special.  It was really, really good; I'm not sure where they get their eggs from but they were bombastic.  Again, I went in expecting not good service and had no issue.  I can see how, if the place gets packed, service might be an issue.  But...just chill out; the food is good!"}
{"text":"Order fried chicken today, it was dry, no flavor, and just absolutely disgusting. Vegetables, were cold, and the potatoes were absolutely dry. I spent 20 minutes trying to place an order for our office, and it was very frustrating. The operator didn't seems to know anything about how the ordering process works.   I never have this problem in Parma, I would suggest going to another restaurant that is much better than Jennifers. They refuse to use automated technology, to produce more, and aren't open for dinner. They will be out of business in five years.   Not a very happy customer!"}
{"text":"We walked in the front door and straight back to 1992.  The place was clean and busy with penny pinching senior citizens.  Our booth table combo seat came with two sided laminated menus and a young skinny blonde waitress with no name tag.  I asked her what was good and she recommended waffles or the fried chicken wrap.  We got a waffle combo with eggs and sausage and a Greek skillet served on a plate appearing in a manner that suggested the ingredients were never anywhere near an actual skillet. My waffle made a fashionably late entrance after the rest of our order for some odd reason, but it was way better than the woefully mediocre-at-best parsley garnished fare we had been enduring.  The good news was they only wanted $16.24 for everything and service was fast and unobtrusive.  What I REALLY wanted to say when they asked how everything was:  \"Appropriately priced\""}
{"text":"Good compared to most breakfast joints in these parts.  Smells like old people though.  The waiting area is very claustrophobic and it is usually full for breakfast.  Have always been very satisfied with food and service!  Has a full menu (not just breakfast) and daily specials."}
{"text":"Breakfast is done very well. I applaud them. However the hours the owner claims to be open does not mean a thing. He closes as he wishes. Several times this has happened. When mentioned to hom he does not care. \"It is his restaurant and he will do it his way\". Great attitude isn't it!"}
{"text":"Food is sub par, not a lot of flavor and nothing special. There are much better breakfast places in town to attend. Everything is over priced for the taste/quality. The wait and the service were not bad."}
