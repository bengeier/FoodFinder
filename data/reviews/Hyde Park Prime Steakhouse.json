{"text":"Very disappointed in the decline of service and food. My husband & I have enjoyed coming here and after our last visit, we won't be returning. The sides are about half the size they once were but still the same price. Our entrees came with mashed potatoes and we asked if we could have the sweet potato side offered with a different dish.  You would think we asked for an extreme alteration to the entire dish. A manager came to our table to tell us this is just not possible.  

We like to support Cleveland Independents and purchase gift certificates through the site whenever possible. This print out resulted in what seemed like an extreme annoyance, which makes me question why HP would collaborate Cleveland Independents?

We've only frequented the Crocker location so I can't speak to others. However the level of arrogance is almost a joke and there are far better places to enjoy a meal than HP."}
{"text":"My wife decided to surprise me with dinner and she knows how much I love a good steak, so we decided to give Hyde Park a shot.  The ambiance of the place was nice, but the steak was sub par.  I prefer the filet cut, and our server recommended their house special for the evening, Wyagu Kobe filet.  I had such high hopes...but....oh boy...it was terribly under seasoned.  We were very disappointed, since the place is supposed to known for its steak.  If your a fan of the filet cut, or any flavorful cut for that matter, I suggest the Cabin Club. 

Hyde Park...pretty good service, pretty bland steak."}
{"text":"Hyde Park does a nice job capturing the ambiance of prohibition era speak easy - a true relic of days past. The iceberg wedge was ambrosial but not byzantine. It was your typical wedge but infused with  a raspberry vinaigrette reduction. The taste flow of the burger starts with a fresh crispy sesame seed bun and finishes with the velvety savor of grass fed cow. The service showed flashes of eloquence but graded out average. 

The waiter forgot the asparagus but we didn't ding him for it."}
{"text":"Food is incredibly delicious.  This location does it right. The Prospect Avenue location has SEVERELY disappointed me an my colleagues. Waiters can't pour wine for guests and have to wait (while food gets cold) for a drink...takes tooooo long.  Food is way underrated on Prospect.  However, completely different story on Chagrin, Beachwood.  Although they promote great beef, the seafood is delicious.  Waitress was so nice, knowledgeable and accommodating.  AVOID the downtown location and head to Beachwood.  More options than this farce downtown."}
{"text":"I had dinner there this week. It is your basic high end steak place with the dark wood and high end prices. The service was attentive, but I found the food to be just \"ok\". I'd go back again, but it seems like it is a notch below places like Fleming's and Capital Grille."}
{"text":"Looking for an easy night out?  Head to the bar, they have a great menu, open at 4:30, nice way to have a relaxed small or large plate meal.  

Great service, REAL bartenders, great food."}
{"text":"As a celebration for attaining my MSW, my dear friend Christina took me to dinner on Pittsburgh's North Shore at Hyde Park.  An upscale steakhouse, she truly knows how to make a man feel like a $1,000,000.  We valeted the car, which was strategic in the midst of a Pirate game that was about to start.

Upon entry, the bar was buzzing with excitement for the start of the Pirate game (I believe they lost to the Reds by quite a depressing margin).  Anyway, it was a perfect late spring night that had Christina and I salivating for the meal we were about to enjoy.  A lovely hostess escorted us to our seats.  We were greeted promptly by servers who were eager to make our experience one to remember. So, we started with our favorite drink, Bombay Sapphire gin and tonics. We sipped on them while perusing the menus.  Each entree was named after a sports player here in Pittsburgh (the \"City of Champions\").  We both decided on the \"Hines Ward\" filet, sauteed in heavy garlic and shallots, with a cracked peppercorn coating (added quite the spice).  Christina got the goat cheese and vinaigrette salad to start.  I went with my favorite, the Ceasar salad.  I was amazed at the generous size of these salads for such a fancy restaurant.  So plentiful, crisp and fresh.  Christina and I LOVE our bread (pretzel sticks too) which were accompanied with butter.  This butter was dusted on each edge with salt and garlic/pepper to spread over our guilty pleasure (yes, we asked for more).  I learned that a great red wine can always be relied upon if it's from New Zealand. We enjoyed a wise choice made by Christina that complemented what was about to come.

Our steaks were perfectly timed and delivered by several servers, insisting that we combine the table next to ours in order to create more space (so accommodating). Our medium-cooked steaks were dressed with deep-fried onion crisps. We had the following delectable sides: macaroni and cheese, brussel sprouts, and garlic mashed potatoes.

If you are not hungry by know, then there is something wrong with you. We passed on dessert, as there was just no room. The server packaged our leftovers, suggesting that she split the sides evenly for us to enjoy later on.  This was a first class experience that I thoroughly appreciated."}
{"text":"The dinner from hell.  Yes it was that bad, and this is coming from a many years diner at Hyde Park, going back to their first location in Cleveland Heights.

Hyde Park was my wife's and my \"go to\" restaurant on the semi-rare occasion of wanting a red  meat dinner.  Never again.  It was the worst \"high end\" dining experience I have ever had.

To start: my wife's cocktail was made with the totally wrong ingredients, and was sent back.  The replacement arrived quickly with apologies.  We toasted each other and then ordered shortly thereafter.

Her salad appetizer was not what she ordered, and was removed and eventually replaced by the correct one.  The onion soup, which I has always loved at this restaurant, looked and tasted like dishwater with a few onions and cover with cheese.  Uneatable.  The waiter replaced it with a lobster bisque, which was quite good.  So far they missed badly on 3 out of 4.

I ordered the 40 day dry aged bone in NY sirloin with peppercorn sauce on the side, prepared medium rare ($59.00), and my wife ordered the lamb chops.  My  steak arrived looking similar to very well burnt shoe leather and one bite confirmed it, and my wife's lamb was kind of OK.  The baked potato was really good!  Their featured wine arrived with the meal, and it was kind of like Two Buck Chuck (if you can remember that rot gut).

I sent the steak back not to be replaced, and my wife did semi-enjoy her lamb chops. 

By that time management was aware that our meal was a disaster, and a young man came and burbled at our table about how sorry they were and if they could do anything, please let him know.  He continued to say this for at least 1 1/2 minutes; again and again.  I finally asked him to go away.

He did adjust the check, charging only for my cocktail, my wife's chops, and the wine.  He also gave us a $25.00 gift card, so I am pretty certain he thought all was well.

We had a meal that we had both been looking forward to totally ruined.  Wrong drinks, wrong and horrid appetizers, 1 inedible steak and 1 barely edible label lamb chops, and rot gut wine.

What the hell happened to one of our once favorite restaurants?  A new steak house is opening less than a mile away from Hyde Park.  We'll go there and hopefully have a fine meal, or to the close by Red's or Fleming's.

What a terrible meal exacerbated by a a fool of a manager. 

And really, I am a nice guy."}
{"text":"By far this was one of the best dinners we have eaten out. The staff was friendly and attentive, although the bar bartender wasn't as attentive as she should have been it took a while to get a drink although there was only 5 others at the bar. The food was wonderful! Steaks were cooked as ordered and the flavor was fabulous. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Love the food love the service. Bartenders are exceptional. You however cheaped out on the Moscow mule mugs.  They are no longer 100% copper and my handle fell off of mine.  What happened to the Tito's 100% copper mule mug!?? Bring it back.  Copper outside and steel inside doesn't cut it in a high class place like Hyde park"}
{"text":"First time there and LOVED IT!!  Will definitely be back...the food was AMAZING, drinks were excellent and our waitress Amanda was great!  We really enjoyed our visit and can't wait to go back soon!"}
{"text":"Just wonderful,as usual. Our waiter was kind enough to ask us if we wanted to move after we were first seated near a noisy party. We all had filets which is our usual because their other steaks are so large. Bought a moderately priced bottle of Pinot noir which was perfect with the filets. They gave my husband a birthday card and a free dessert. This place is always crowded but service is excellent and prompt. If I could give six stars I would."}
{"text":"Pretty chaotic pre-game. Team members did a great job, food was good and typical of a High end steak house. I didn't try their specialty steaks, I plan to come back and give their steak a shot."}
{"text":"Classic steak house, pretty good food, the seafood appetizers were excellent.  Good steakhouse. Service was good."}
{"text":"We went for my sister's bachelorette party dinner and had the best service! The food was amazing!! They definitely made the occasion feel very special for us and we greatly appreciated it."}
{"text":"so I ordered the ribeye and ordered it medium rare, came out med well. The bartender insisted I get another(I totally appreciate) out comes a New York Strip!!! Ugh!!
hey things happen and it could be worse, the important thing is the bartender offered to take it off the tab. do you understand that in restaurants things are going to happen? It is however, how they handle it,that makes the place different from the rest. hey Jack, two thumbs up!!!"}
{"text":"My favorite steak house in Cleveland. I have been going here since I was little kid, and they have always remained consistently amazing. Steaks usually come out perfectly medium rare, and even if they don't and you ask them to make a change, they will correct the mistake perfectly. The appetizers are also great, as I especially enjoy the tuna, lobster bisque, oysters, and escargot. I even had my high school graduation party here, and they made it an unforgettable evening."}
{"text":"Tasty but chewy aged NY steak and no I don't want to try another one. I expect a great steak when I pay that much. They later refunded my credit card without me asking"}
{"text":"Food was very good. Service was attentive. Atmosphere was very old-school and out-dated. Pricing was sky high for what we received. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"They said I couldn't sit at the bar without an ID when I was here with my parents. What a lie!!!!! Discriminating towards customers. I don't want to eat at a place that has potato chips instead of fries. Be nice to your customers. I would've been a repeat customer. I love steak."}
{"text":"I've been to Hyde Park twice; first, for a Christmas Eve dinner (in part because they were one of few top choices open on Christmas Eve) with the family, and second for a more causal dinner.

My first experience could not have been more mouthwateringly memorable.  Most of the members in my party of five ordered the Sea & Shore three-course dinner, which includes a salad, entree, and dessert for $39.90.  I chose the Beefsteak Tomato & Onion salad, Filet Mignon, and Vanilla Bean Creme Brulee.  I still dream about that salad -- I had never had fresh mozzarella prepared like that in a salad, and haven't since.  (Subsequently, I tried the Caprese tomato/basil/mozzarella salad at The Woods in Rocky River in the hopes of recreating the experience at HP, but it did not even compare -- not to knock The Woods.)  The filet was delightful and rich, as to be expected of well-prepared steak, and by the time I reached the creme brulee I could barely fit it in my stomach, but savored it nonetheless.

My mother is a huge fan of the Steamed Fresh Asparagus Bearnaise and ordered some for the table, in addition to a bottle of wine.  Both were very nice.

The waiter was extremely attentive, though it did seem that we waited longer than needed for our first course to arrive, considering the barely-crowded atmosphere that evening.  Overall, it was enjoyable, and by the time we arrived at the third course we were glad to have started a little hungry.  We ate and drank leisurely for hours and felt welcome.


My second experience, just a little less than two months ago, was a bit underwhelming compared to the first.  Unfortunately, I wasn't in the mood for steak, and ordered the Chicken Milanese Pomodoro.  The herb pasta that accompanied the chicken had an odd, spongey texture -- either it wasn't cooked properly or I'm simply not familiar with that kind of pasta.  The chicken was mediocre.  However, the whiskey cocktail (infused with something or another) I had was delicious.  Because I had had such a wonderful experience before, I let the entree experience slide, and probably will stick to steak (or maybe try some Blake's Seafood) next time.

I will say, in support of the previous entry, that when I dined the second time, my party was also seated in a crap booth.  It was early in the evening and the restaurant was neither busy when we arrived nor did it become busy during the course of our meal.  The booth had tears in the seat, which was a little shocking compared to the maintenance of most of the decor, and because it was something I'd expect of a diner, but not a restaurant in Crocker Park.  Really, it was a little bizarre -- I can't picture their clientele causing such extreme wear, and can't fathom why they wouldn't have the shame to seat patrons elsewhere while waiting to have it repaired."}
{"text":"Oyster as starter tasted ok to me, I ordered 4 but 2 of them comes as detached from shell already which made them suspiciously not fresh. The ribeye steak with bone is slightly overcooked and the steak was not tasty based on its price standard. The side vegetable sauteed was a little salty for me. In general, this place is over priced but the mood and decoration is good in Cleveland area."}
{"text":"Great fillet, well worth the price.  They have a great wine list and the jumbo shrimp are to die for"}
{"text":"I will keep it short and pithy....

The service and the food are wonderful. My mom and my step-father went here for years and whenever I was in town we go. I took my mom here the other night and it was perfect. Quite frankly, you will not get a better steak dinner on the west side. I don't know enough about the east side options to comment. But in the River, Avon, Westlake corridor I cannot imagine a better restaurant for carnivores. 

Service and ambiance were what you would expect given the quality and craft of the food. Also, they were very accommodating as I had arrived in CLE and went straight from the airport to pick up my mom to take her to her favorite restaurant- I was not sure If I would make the reservation precisely on-time and I called to explain the situation. They took care of us.

Could not have been more pleased."}
{"text":"Steaks are not prime.  Nice place but expensive and leave every time wishing the steaks were better like at Mortons or Flemmings."}
{"text":"It's fine. Smells a bit odd. Drinks were nice. Expensive meal and every thing you buy is separate, a large side of asparagus, etc.  Good for a group if you are hungry."}
{"text":"Was proposed to at dinner here, and it was a great place to do it! Atmosphere is very romantic. The dinner started with a bread basket assorted with different types, pretzel sticks, rolls, homemade crackers. We both like everyone of them. We both ordered salads and steaks, and oh my goodness they were outstanding! Only issue... Make sure to save up for this dinner! Left with a $200 bill for two"}
{"text":"My husband and I was there for happy hour, not the first time but just that we sat at the bar and the bartender Dominic was great he explained everything and give great suggestion on some of the bar food, great guy Hy park has one of the BEST happy hour I've been too! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Great steaks, good service.  Waiters are a bit odd but lots of fun.  The cocktails are yummy and they cater to your every whim.  Had a great wine list and management seems to care about how your dinner experience is.  Really"}
{"text":"Horrible experience, mainly because of the manager, Meagan Banks. We spoke with her about a misunderstanding, she treated us rudely, talked down to us and didn't assist at all. She made our experience quite awful. I would recommend not visiting this establishment. It was overpriced for being attached to a hotel right off the highway.

Add: The corporate offices called me about this and Walter was very kind and helpful and apologetic about my experience. I appreciate his kindness and feel better about this company."}
{"text":"I've seen this restaurant undergo a handful of changes over the years I've been attending.  The food for the most part is usually an amazing experience.  The Chef has even come out on occasion to drop off food and speak a few words which is a truly nice added touch!  I usually tend to get the steak Dawson (a Bone-In Filet, yes they exist and are incredible). The Previous Au Gratin potato recipe has been a fan favorite but has been replaced in my book by the new Lobster Mac n Cheese. 

The staff have always seemed VERY knowledgeable and well trained, we usually end up sitting in the company of long time employee Jason & his partner (Jay i think?) for several years now, and it seems our experience is usually more memorable with him than that of other servers, which is not a slight against the others however, they just aren't as \"experienced\" in fine dining atmospheres.  

The management are hard to grade on, it seems like an entire new batch near every-time we dine. Maybe they should take guest service tips from the before mentioned waiters so the turn over rate isn't as high, or better yet.. give them the keys to the manager position?  There are a few female managers (2 If i recall right) that had previously worked that were always pleasant, but the rest have felt short of sub-par for being in position for a FINE DINING atmosphere.  

All in all I recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a good time out and amazing food (although pricey).  Just work out the management kinks you've suffered over the last few years and you will be back to a 5 star rating from me!"}
{"text":"Excellent place for a great steak. We called for reservations since we had a table of eight. As appetizer, we had some seafood combination - and it was very fresh. We asked our server to add a couple extra side dishes with our spinach and augratin potatoes so he added some creamed corn and brussel sprouts. Everything was very good but if you like creamed corn - order it. Cheesecake was good but don't bother with chocolate ice cream. Taxi's are hard to come by so call Uber or Lyft for a ride back to hotel if you don't have a rental car. Very pricey, expect about $100/person average."}
{"text":"This is my favorite steakhouse in the area.  It is rather expensive, but if you aren't opposed to going early or on a Sunday, you can get the \"Early Nights\" special.  For $20 you can get either a soup (French onion is AMAZING) or a salad, an entrée, and a side dish.  Their sides are enough for two people, so when my husband and I go we always get the asparagus and either the garlic mashed potatoes or the potatoes gruyere, and then we share.  We like to sit in the bar area when we go, it is more casual and since we are not the \"fancy restaurant type\" it suits us much better.  The service is impeccable, and the food couldn't be better."}
{"text":"Let me first say that my other half and I have dined at Hyde Park several times with fabulous service. However, earlier last week, we were far from impressed. After a long work day, school play, and Christmas shopping, we discussed where to have dinner. After going back and forth, we decided on Hyde Park, willing to pay extra for prompt service. Arriving an hour before closing time, we were sat and waited 10 minutes before being greeted. With that said, we were not greeted by our server, but rather a different server that noticed us sitting, and waiting for a long period without being greeted. This server was done with his shift, attending to his side work when he brought us water, and said he would go find our server (without being asked). Ten minutes later, nothing. We were finally greeted after a while, with our drink order taken. We ordered a bottle of Chardonnay that 25 minutes later, never came. She walked past our table 4 times without acknowledging us. After much frustration and disappointment, we ended up walking out. As we left, our server came running after us with our bottle of Chardonnay, apologizing, stating she had to wait on the manager to get the bottle of wine we ordered. We politely declined, explaining we had waited too long. My other half was worried we were receiving poor service due to the fact he was wearing construction type clothing and had come in an hour before closing. We ended up dining at The Cheesecake Factory with wonderful service and a great meal. Who would have thought!"}
{"text":"Was always one of my favorites!  Went last night and noticed several changes. Some good, some bad. Jazz music was a nice added touch in the bar!  The drink pours were embarrassing. Charge more and pour more!  Nothing worse than a small drink in a nice restaurant. The salads are a much smaller portion. I think the prices have been increased as well. Still, a nice experience, but may not be rushing back."}
{"text":"Went there once. Ordered a filet mignon, medium rare.

Out came a filet mignon, more than well done; bone dry really.

Disclaimer: I hate it when steakhouses can't cook their steaks to as ordered. After all, they usually charge quite heavily for their steaks; and, that's what they are supposed to be doing, cook steaks to order, right?

A dining establishment that calls itself 'steakhouse' needs to be able to  cook steaks to perfection, each and every time. That's what they are in the business for - cook steaks to order. 

End of perseverations.

Haven't been back."}
{"text":"Bad experience this evening.  Ordered my steak medium and it came out extremely rare.  I politely asked if they could cook it a little longer and sent it back.  About 10 minutes later, the server came back out with the steak and, again, it was extremely rare - it didn't look like they had done anything with it (the lady at the table next to me laughed when she saw it and said, \"that's supposed to be medium?\").  The server was very apologetic and offered to take it back again.  At that point, I was going to be late for a movie, and didn't have time to wait another 10+ minutes, so I told her that I'd just eat it as is.  She admitted that the exact same thing happened to two other tables within the previous hour, and that \"something must be going on in the kitchen.\"  The couple sitting next to us had their entire meal comp'd bc of a similar issue.

In the end, I ate about 1/2 the steak - didn't want to risk food poisoning by eating the rest.  To the server's credit, she comp'd the steak, but the meal was still $120 (wife had lobster, we split an app, and had one drink each).  If I had known that I'd be paying that much without the satisfaction of eating a well-prepared steak, I would've chosen Cabin Club instead.  Waste of time, food, and money."}
{"text":"I have been to Hyde park likely more than 20 times.  It must be the only restaurant that is consistent in excellence.  Out of all the times I have been there, there was only one time that my food was not excellent.  Still very good.  

The pretzel bread is awesome. I had to stop eating it because I would eat so much, it would ruin my appetite.  Appetizer  favorite is the lump crab, accompanied with with beer, or sometimes a cocktail.  Main course I usually stick with steak, filet for that matter, which is one of the best in town. Always cooked perfect.  I've had some of the bone-in selections and they where excellent as well.   

Last time I had the cheeseburger with blue cheese and it was very yummy also. 

The side dishes are very large, and filling so usually my wife and I will share one.  All of the potato dishes are great, and the asparagus is fantastic. 

At this point I'm really full and then I remember; crème brûlée.   Hyde park simply put has the best I have had, and I have had a lot. 

The place is expensive.  A three course meal with a drink or two could run about $100 per person, give or take.  Cheeseburger night was an exception!   

The staff is excellent. Very professional, and classy, but at the same time not snobby.  Try to avoid going on holidays (valentine's, mothers, Father's Day etc). As the service suffers a bit due to the mass amounts of customers.  All other times you think you are the king. 

Overall, Hyde park is excellent. It is on my top five of favorite restaurants."}
{"text":"Good food, spotty service makes for a poor value. Maybe I caught them on a bad night."}
{"text":"It's a little on the pricey side for Cleveland. If your celebrating something special like a birthday or an anniversary, this is the perfect place. Hyde park also has a very romantic feel to it.

As far as the food goes, absolutely everything was amazing but especially the lobster mashed potatoes. 

Service was impeccable!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is a conditional four stars. I would really like to give it three, but the food is pretty darn good. There are some problems, though. One thing is that Hyde Park (we have been there numerous times, being captive because my parents like it) does a lot of business dinners and medical-rep business. Is this bad, you may ask? Not if you're a business traveler or a medical representative! They have separate meeting/dining rooms, and the decor is very steakhousy-corporate: dark wood, booths, old-timey pictures, etc. If you want to go out for an every-day dinner, however, I would not just drop into Hyde Park for a \"bite\". Because? They won't allow it. First off (this has happened every time) they escort you to the WORST table in the house (we always go very early). Example: right next to the bathrooms or the service station, even though the entire place is empty. Last night I just said \"you know, I hate to say this, but this is the worst table possible, and I am not a table whore, but come on!\" The hostess gave us a blank Valley-Girl look which meant \"HUH?\". She took us to another table immediately. Guess who got that awful table? The next table that was seated. They didn't know enough to ask for a different table. This is a technique that I have seen over and over again around the world, and it's ugly. Why seat a 5:30 table at a dismal spot when you know they're going to be gone by prime time? The next thing that happens is the \"specials\". Want a $70 lobster tail? A la carte? Then you're in the right place! Who eats a 20 oz. lobster tail? I'll tell you who: their core market, the business people who are in there raping their company's expense accounts and the doctors taking advantage of the drug rep's expense accounts. After we were seated, the two tables of eight next to us were seated. 16 men, seemed like nice guys, already had had a couple of huge martinis at the bar, all lubricated and having a ball. Which is fine. The noise level  in the room went up 400% immediately. Each table ordered the $150 raw bar double decker platter (featuring a whole lobster, crab claws, oysters, mussels, shrimp, and so on...it looked delicious!). I listened to their subsequent orders and they proceeded to order huge salads, crab cakes, 24 oz. steaks with extra toppings and $$ added sauces, more drinks, side dishes, and so on. I don't know where they put all this food. Yes, the food is very expertly prepared, and it's classic steakhouse fare. But the portions are insane. My mother had a \"side salad\" of field greens with goat cheese and caramelized nuts. Delightful, but about four cups portion size. Dinner size. She didn't realize it was going to be so huge, so she also ordered a Kobe beef burger. Also humongous, and with a mound of french fries. She was able to eat about two bites of the burger. I ordered the beef carpaccio appetizer as an entree. The waiter was NOT HAPPY that it was all I ordered. They have a very aggressive selling style there, and if you don't order up, they have no problem letting you know through their body language and other \"tells\" that you're just NOT GOOD ENOUGH. When my carpaccio came, I could only eat a third of it. It was delicious, but it's such a waste of food to put so much on an appetizer portion. A mound of salad, two huge crispy bread slices, and the beef. My huband ordered the tomato and onion salad and lamb chops. There were four double chops, HUGE, (and delicious, and perfectly cooked) and a mountain of onion rings. Once again, expertly and beautifully prepared. He ate one lamb chop. He was already full from the mound of tomato and onion with bleu cheese. Here is our problem: we don't want leftovers. We eat dinner (and usually lunch) out every single day. What are we going to do with all of this extra food? We don't mind paying for great food. Why can't there be smaller portions? The price is NOT a problem. It's the portion size. The portion size is why we will NEVER go to the Cheesecake Factory, for instance, ever again. We can't be the only people in the world who don't want a 5,000 calorie dinner. People, rise up! (If you can, after that 5,000 calorie dinner, that is). Rise up and ask for smaller portions, so that you CAN order a soup, a salad, an appetizer, an entree, and so on. These days, appetizers are even larger than entrees used to be. It must stop. That being said, the quality of the food at Hyde Park is excellent. But we can't go there. It's just too much food, and their sales techniques are much too aggressive. It's too bad we can't go there, but we can't."}

{"text":"Skip it if you are a vegetarian or health conscious.  I had a piece of fish which I ordered \"plain\".  I guess I should have specified 'not soaked in butter and oil sauce'. The chopped salad was OK.  The breads tick was a soft pretzel stick.  For a $50 meal this was mediocre at best. It was worth about $12.

The wait staff was great -  fast,  friendly and the ideal level of attention.  Too bad the food is overpriced and not so great."}

{"text":"We celebrated our anniversary there. They welcomed us with an anniversary wish, took us to table that had rose petals and a nice anniversary card. All waitstaff wished us an happy anniversary and the manager came over to wish us happy anniversary. All very nice.

We ordered our second drink as we were still absorbing the menu. 10 minutes later, we had not seen any of our waitstaff. The manager came over and we told her that our waitstaff disappeared.  Another waiter brought us our drinks. 

I ordered the lobster bisque. I found it to be somewhat boring, it was missing something.

We each had a filet. They were OK, not anything to write home about. Both of our steaks were cooked very well, but a bit fatty. 

After we finished, we had to wait 15 minutes to see any staff to remove our dinnerware. I was literally calling the manager who had stopped by earlier from the table to see about having out dinnerware removed when they showed up.

It is a great physical location, but for the money spent, I will take my high end steakhouse  future business to Mike Ditkas or Ruth's Chris

{"text":"Their martini selection is exellent. You have to try the lychee martini. Their steak and side dishes(especially the corn) were great. Definitely a great place for steak. I was also surprised to find that they served the best value burger when i saw my colleaque's entree. It was huge and cheap@@"}
{"text":"I love Hyde Park. Lunch is an amazing deal, dinner size portions for half the price. Steaks are always charred on the outside. Pretzel breadsticks, service shows well trained wait staff, clean wine glasses, excellent, always. I do not like fried onions with my food, but that's just me. The rest is amazing, fish of the day is always fresh flown in."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite steakhouse on the westside. Steaks always are cooked exactly as requested, the service is always top notch, (the same servers and bartenders have been there for years), and the location, Crocker Park, is ideal. Once per week dining here is almost a must."}
{"text":"Positives:  My wife, daughter and daughter's friend went to Hyde park before a play at the New Hazlett theater.  We were served by 2 friendly and very professional servers.  They were not hovering but timed their visits perfectly.  We had salmon, 'Hurdle' steak and 2 chicken dishes.  Sides were spinach and mushrooms, asparagus and the 'to-die-for' boursin mac and cheese.  All of the food was great.  My steak was done perfectly medium rare.  The chicken was crispy and moist.  The salmon was juicy.  Will definitely go back and try something different.

 Go and enjoy the food and wine."}
{"text":"You cannot go wrong here. The bone in filet is the best in northeast Ohio. Also called \"The Urban Myer\" . I order it every visit. The sides are large and delicious. Try the boardwalk fries. Served with ketchup and malt vinegar dressing. I'm a regular at this place. Really the service is second to none. Tonight we had the privilege to have Pete wait on us. A class act. Very pleasant and knowledgeable. Made my wife and I feel right at home."}
{"text":"I had an overall great experience; although having 2 servers was clumsy at times as they seemed not to coordinate between themselves as far as our service.  My Steak Rooney was delicious and cooked to my order. Also had the seared Ahi tuna appetizer which was delicious. My dinner mate had a shrimp cocktail appetizer and his steak was also very good.  Will definitely visit again for special occasions."}
{"text":"Full Discloser: I did not pay for this meal as it was a group outing for the holiday. 

Long story short.

What I ordered: bacon gruyere burger, medium rare, with no bun and no fries.

What I received: a burger. overcooked. on a bun. with a full mound of fries. and no bacon. and no gruyere.

At least there was A burger right?!?! I mean I guess the could have gone all out and brought me tofu.

And no, it wasn't anywhere near 9 oz. either."}
{"text":"I come to hyde park frequently bc its consistently great & the attention to detail is phenomenal. Thomas the GM goes out of his way to wow everyone. Food is always delish. 
Nice little bar menu for happy hour; the espresso martini's are amongst my fave's & great calamari too...."}
{"text":"I went for a work event and I have a LOT of dietary restrictions. Frankly going to most restaurants gives me anxiety if I don't research it beforehand. There are more ingredients that I cannot have than I can. Last time I was there a few months ago, I spent 15 minutes with the chef and he came up with alternatives or knew the exact item to take out of the options we were served to make sure I could eat with everyone else. 

  This time I arrived late. I felt horrible asking from the start the few alterations I remembered from the wedge salad. Started to try to go through the hole thing again with a manager but felt disheartened part of the way through. I said could you just do this plain and I won't pry about the rest, just leave it off. When he came back he said the chef REMEMBERED me. He had a special plate aside in mind for me and recalled our last conversation enough to make sure I could have it. As someone who pretty much has anxiety every time someone else prepares my food, it was an incredible gesture. Hats off to the chef!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice and would recommend it to anybody.  The first time I ate there i sat  at a table and had excellent service and the food was amazing.  Second time I was at the bar and had excellent service and conversation form the bartender, both times i had the fillet which was cooked to perfection.  Nothing bad to say about Prime."}
{"text":"We went here to celebrate our parents 65th anniversary and our mother's birthday (no numbers here). The meal was great as usual, the restaurant has been redone and looks great. The menu has several new items we had of special note.  The first was an heirloom tomato and mozzarella caprese salad with small heirloom tomatoes and balls of fresh mozzarella on top of a pesto and drizzled with balsamic vinegar which was a great adaptation of a classic salad.  The steaks were perfect and had a great flavor. There was a new potato dish called millionaire potatoes which were great. Lastly was a s'mores desert which was also unique and fun.  The service was great and very attentive.  The chef came out several times to check how we were enjoying the meal also adding to the attentive feeling we had. Overall a great meal.  You should go."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and it is definitely  my favorite steakhouse! The food and service is always top notch."}
{"text":"Had the Lump Crab Cocktail , 7oz Filet and the Brussels Sprouts .  OMgosh  absolutely delicious :))"}
{"text":"My wife's drink was very weak. Mentioned it to the bartender drink was
Repoured still weak. I had a Manhattan. Nine bucks for a JimBeam 
Manhattan ridiculous. Shrimp sticks were great. Nice sauce on calamari 
But chewy. Sliders & burger disappointing. Great rolls & pretzel bread.
For the price we're disappointed. Comfortable decor. Can't believe 
Regulars would put up with weak drinks."}
{"text":"Love it, the portions of food were small but Very good."}
{"text":"I'd only been here a couple of times. Someone recently gave me a gift card so we decided to go and have a special evening to celebrate my birthday. Making a reservation was quite easy and they were very accommodating when I phoned to explain we were running late.

We were seated promptly in a booth. The atmosphere reminded me of New York City. We had quite a few staff members walking by our table to get to the area where they process checks. It was a little annoying.

Service was good and professional. I had the surf and Turf and started with lobster bisque. There was no Lobster at all in it. My filet was delicious and cooked properly. Lobster tail was also quite well done. My date thoroughly enjoyed her lamb chops and her salad. She also loved the wine she chose based on the  recommendation from the server.

Overall a very good eating experience but I was not impressed by the atmosphere or the clientele. There were several people on cell phones how many people are in blue jeans look like they just walked in off the street. It obviously was not a special occasion for them. I guess when I spend a lot of money on a meal I want it to be special with great food and a wonderful atmosphere.  Oh my next special occasion this restaurant will not be on my list since it is so casual."}
{"text":"I was visiting from out of town and hoped to find a good steakhouse. This was recommended by my hotel and met my criteria for a good meal out.

I had attentive and high quality service , like you would expect from a good steakhouse. Nothing terribly revolutionary on the menu but since most people are there for the steaks I guess its best just to stick to the basics.

I had a filet and even though I requested it well done it was still prepared with flavor and not burnt to a crisp. 

Prices are on par of what you would find in a higher end steakhouse. My meal for one ( not as depressing as it sounds ) , ran right around $45 for a filet,  drink and a mushroom appetizer dish.

If I happen to be this way again I certainly would try to stop by here for dinner."}
{"text":"Met expectations but did not exceed them in any way. Carbon copy of the modern big-boy steak place."}
{"text":"First time for me here.  Based on the prices, menu, and atmosphere, I can't help but compare it to the half dozen or so Ruth's Chris locations I have enjoyed in recent years; unfortunately, most of them before I started Yelping. I was invited by some high rollers that come here fairly often so I was the rookie, and overall I wasn't that impressed when compared to Ruth's Chris. This review won't be quite as light hearted as most of my reviews, and I will base my review by comparing it to RC in each category.

Appetizer was shrimp cocktail on a very cool dried ice double boiler type dish that was very appealing but I couldn't figure out how to get any of the cocktail sauce out of the cup other than to double dip after each bite of shrimp! Not a good idea! I had no spoon, and there was no spoon with the shrimp, so it was awkward watching everyone try to figure out what to do.  The shrimp wasn't peeled very well either, but it was huge.  Bummer

Next was the Caesar salad.  It was a nice size serving, but it had no where near enough dressing on it. It was so lacking that when I was done, the plate was dry and clean, you couldn't even tell there was a salad on it!  Bummer!

The dinner rolls were good, but you really had to be patient and I finally had to ask for them, the exact opposite of RC.  

Wagyu filet, this was the hi-light of the evening!  It was $70+ and it was great! It was prepared exactly how I wanted it, and I really enjoyed the steak! I was afraid it would be too marbled, but it was just right! I would get this again!

Sides, I had the  grated potatoes and while the flavor was good, the potatoes were really under cooked and were too hard to eat without working to cut through them to spoon them out. Bummer again!

Service was a big disappointment also, you never have to ask for a drink refill at RC, but here you have to ask every time, then you have a fairly long painful wait.  Overall, the staff was professional and well trained, but this just wasn't anything like the experience at any RC I have been to.  

I had the 24 ct chocolate desert, and it was nice and rich but there wasn't enough icing to get it sweetened up and compliment it a bit, and the cake, while hot, had an odd texture and I was disappointed in it immensely.  Bummer again!

Over all, you would be better off crossing the river into down town and eating at Ruth's Chris Steakhouse.   Sorry guys, I was looking forward to this dinner but it just didn't measure up.   I'm really glad I didn't have to pick up the bill."}
{"text":"Had dinner with the in-laws, they love their steak! I however am not a steak eater so I ordered the special that night and it was Sea Bass...typically a great choice but I would not say it was a great choice. They left the skin on it, and there was some fatty something other I had to cut off and it was just whatever. I did enjoy the au gratin potatoes :)"}
{"text":"Hyde Park makes the best steak in Cleveland, in my opinion. Every single time I eat a steak in a different city, I immediately compare it to Hyde Park. So far, most steaks haven't even come close! The side dishes are also great as well, and only make the meal better."}
{"text":"Started with the French onion soup. Asked for no bread in the soup... Yes it came with no bread.. Awesome! They melted the cheese on the dish, nice and crisply, while chewy on the inside. Great attention to detail .

Them ordered the aged bone in ribeye. Pricy but worth it. Certain out exactly like I ordered it. Really difficult to find anything wrong here. 

Can't forget the staff. Veery polite."}
{"text":"Colleen: I called and talked to Colleen and she said that the only available reservations for Sat 11/14 were before five in after 9 PM. I asked her if she could help me out with a two seater somewhere in the bar.  She bent over backwards to accommodate me.
Ken: I think the manager that evening with Ken he also been over backwards to accommodate myself and my girlfriend
Bar Staff: extremely over-the-top awesome customer service! I didn't get the names but they were two men and a lady and they were each fantastic!
Food:   Caesar salad, lobster bisque, and ribeye sliders all excelled! Yeah he tower was so-so.
Drinks:   You can't screw up scotch and my girlfriends lemon teeny was just as we ordered it strong and not too sweet no sugar rim :-)

Thank you all

{"text":"I came here for a holiday work party.  There were about 30 people in the party so we had a private room.  The evening started hors d'oeuvres, crab cakes, egg rolls and fried lobster on a stick.  All of them were delicious.  The portions were huge.

The service was great, I always had a glass of wine, whenever it got low, the server was right there with another...very important at a work holiday function.

I ordered the  7 oz filet mignon topped with the peppercorn Cognac Bordelaise sauce.  I ordered my steak medium rare and was very disappointed when it came back medium.  However as soon as I cut my steak open, the manager was at the table asking how everyone's steak was; I told him mine was overcooked.  He immediately offered a new steak, when I told him not to bother he offered lobster.  Again, I was at the boyfriends company holiday party, I didn't want to make a big fuss.  All the other steaks were cooked perfectly (medium rare).  Other than my steak, the rest of the food was really good.

For side dishes, served family stye, I tried the asparagus and the lobster mashed potatoes.  OMG!!! The lobster mashed potatoes were amazing!  I could have eaten the entire bowl.


In the end, the service was great and the food was pretty darn good.  I will go back and give it another chance.  Especially since the manager offered me and my boyfriend each a $25 gift card as we left the restaurant and apologized for any inconveniences.  Oh I forgot to mention the boyfriend choked on his first bite of steak - scary moment but not to any fault of the restaurant or the food.  

I felt that the manager offering us each a gift card was awesome and it shows that they care about their customers and will go to great lengths to please them."}
{"text":"if you've got some extra dough you want to drop on a slab of beef, or a gigantic hunk o' lobster (80 bucks a pop for that sucker...on special)...hyde park is your place.

on a more civilized note, one of the speciality steaks, the filet mignon with cracked black pepper, garlic, and butter will simply make your mouth explode with a mouthful of fruit flavor.

...not really civilized, but a step better than where i started with this one.  and it isn't fruit flavor either.  but that sounded good.  

the most knowledgable staff i've ever experienced in a restaurant.  they know their food.  in detail.  in short story form.  at points you will wonder if the servers wrote a small epic with all the detail they go into.  and you'll wonder when they'll walk away.  but they keep talking.  but hey, you're the one who asked, right?  right.  good that they know their product.  i say kudos, dante.  homer is proud.

it was a tasty steak. 

sides are extra.  everything a la carte.

and enough flavor to pack a punch.

..into your wallet."}
{"text":"Had dinner there about a month ago.  Service was very good.  Waiter was very knowledgeable and helpful.  I was torn between the ribeye and the Hines Ward.  Waiter suggested the rib-eye with the Hines Ward sauce.  Great idea.  The meat was good but not great.  Lots of fat (even for a rib-eye) and the taste was a little on the bland side.  Good thing there was the sauce to go with it.  Sides were very good.  Would probably go back if invited.  If I'm paying I might make another choice.  PIttsburgh finally has more than two steakhouses to choose from."}
{"text":"I was torn about the number of stars. On one have my food was excellent but the gentleman next to me had two different bites of his lobster Mac that had shells in it. Ridiculous. 

My biggest reason for 2 stars was the staff. When I came in I went to the bar area and there was an empty glass at the seat I was going to sit in. Justin (maybe Dustin?), an apparent manager of sorts, came over and somewhat dramatically moved the glass and made it known to the bartender that he had to move it. This all caused a chain reaction. I then had to hear the two female bartenders discussing his dramatic-ness. I can't say either lady was overly attentive. They were more focused in cleaning and what I assume are other closing duties. My order was sent to the kitchen wrong but I made it work, I understand errors happen.  I will say that some of the conversation the two bartenders were having that I could hear wasnt overly professional. The one never wanted to work a Sunday again, apparently people don't tip well, another guest left $40 cash, woo hoo, etc. As a bartender I know the ups and downs but you don't talk about tips or customers in front of customers!!!"}
{"text":"Move over Morton's!!

We had the pleasure of dining at Hyde Park before the Steeler game last Thursday. In hind site we should have stayed at the restaurant as our meals were great and the Steelers....well....not so much. 

Our steaks were thicker and tastier than those we've been seeing at another favorite steakhouse (Morton's). My wife had filet and it was perfectly cooked Pittsburgh rare. My T-Bone was incredible, perfectly seared and delicious every bite. 

We are looking forward to making Hyde Park our new go to steak place when we are in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"To tee up this story, I travel around the country and have been in hundreds of steak houses.

I recently went here because it was close to my hotel and I was in the mood for a filet mignon.  I had never been to this small chain before and was eager to try it.  I walked in on an off Tuesday night at dinner time, around 640pm.  

The first problem was the parking.  They offer 'free' (pressure) valet.  Worse, they block off most of the spots close to the restaurant with cones and obstacles.  This gave me a true low class vibe.  I must admit I was surprised by this odd strategy.  Strike 1.

Next, I was able to get a quick seat at the bar with the help of the hostess (thank you).  I was then greeted by a bartender quickly.  Before too long I had a great glass of relatively expensive Chianti in my hand.  It was delicious worth the price ($16.25) - cannot remember the name but it was the only Chianti by the glass.  I ordered the 8oz filet mignon (medium) with a side of baked potato, butter on the side.  I was asked if I wanted bread (((please just bring it, don't ask))) and I said yes.

This is where things got weird.  I hadn't even cut into my filet when the bartender had asked how my meal was.  OK, no big deal, I told her I wasn't sure because I hadn't tried it .  She also was astute enough to notice I hadn't gotten any bread (Strike 2).  She asked if I wanted the bread after all - I declined.

The baked potato was perfect, as ordered, hot and fresh.  The Filet?  POOR.  It was a charcoal briquette for a few millimeters on the outside.  inedible.  The inside was medium to medium-rare.  They clearly whipped this filet out of a too-cold refrigerator, then cooked it in a too-hot oven.  NO WAY anyone properly cooked or temp'd this piece of meat.  (Strike 3)

The bartender again asked how my meal was.  I told her the filet was just 'ok' and 'could be better'.  I had no desire to stay any longer -usually, I'm ordering another glass of wine AND dessert 90% of the time (seriously).

As I was paying, the manager made a necessary (but feeble) attempt to comp some free dessert or add a few splashes of wine to my empty glass.  I declined.

Note to restaurant:  You can't charge $100/head and drop the ball ANYWHERE in the service and meal delivery process.

This visit is in the bottom 20% of my steakhouse visits (see above for experience) and I won't be back - even though I'm going to be visiting this area every week for the next 5 months.  I am sorry to say, you really blew it Hyde Park :(  C'est la guerre."}
{"text":"Having only lived in Pittsburgh for just short of two years, Hyde Park was one of the first nicer restaurants my wife and I had a chance to visit here.

Let me just say that we made a fantastic choice in coming here early on!

Both of our filets were cooked to perfection and if you visit and don't try the lobster macaroni, you may as well not have come. DO IT!"}
{"text":"I recently dined at Hyde Park Prime Steakhouse in Beachwood with a large group of friends and family members (20+). My in-laws reserved a private room which was so nice and spacious. It had a fireplace which made it feel cozy on a chilly fall November evening. There were a few kids in the group so it was nice to have our own room so as not to bother other patrons. I highly recommend keeping this in mind if you're planning a small gathering either personally or professionally. I would like to particularly thank Anthony, Clarence and Skylar (hopefully I got the spelling right) who waited on our party and did a fabulous job. They were extremely helpful, knowledgeable and patient with our group and happy to help make suggestions/recommendations on food and drink orders. There were several toasts made throughout the evening and they were always cognizant to close the double doors and to stop service while speeches were being made. My husband ordered a Filet Mignon and a side of Sautéed Asparagus, I ordered the Spicy Tuna Crunch Roll, both meals were delicious. Our entire group enjoyed the meals and merriment.  I have been to other steakhouses in the area including: Fleming's, Morton's, Red, Ruth's Chris Steak House, XO Seafood And Oysters but by far received the best service and hospitality at Hyde Park Prime Steakhouse in Beachwood. I look forward to returning again!"}
{"text":"The service was polite but pretty slow. The crispy calamari was good, a nice balance of veggies, scallions, and squid. Lamb chops were scrumptious, juicy, and had just enough taste. The petite filet mignon was nicely cooked, but I would order the sauce on the side - the peppercorn was a bit too spiced. The red velvet cake was absolutely delicious! It is GIANT, but definitely more worth it than the creme brulee."}
{"text":"Service is outstanding, food is delicious, prices are high but you'll find that with any high end steakhouse. We stopping on NYE for dinner and drinks, we sat at the bar and ordered a prosecco and a glass of cider. We were told they were out of prosecco and they only had one brand of cider. No biggie but on NYE you'd think they'd be well stocked and it was only 730. At 830 I was told I had gotten the last cider(I had three) needless to say when you go to a top end place you expect them to have the main staples and to run out is a bit of a turn off. Would we return? Sure I think a second chance is in order but only after we explore the other options available. Food and service get 5* the prices and lack of inventory bring the overall down."}
{"text":"Wow, I mean really a steakhouse that served lukewarm fries and a burger that the order temp was medium and it comes out well-done. Why even send it out? Why not correct it then tell me at the table we had to refire your burger it will be a few minutes and bring me out a great burger. Damn. Disappointing.

What's even more disappointing is the refire came out medium well to well done. 

Amateurs."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a lump crab cake to start out my meal, it was beyond the best crab cake I've ever had. The red sauce they plate it with took it to the next level. For my main I enjoyed the 8oz. Hines Filet. So, so amazing. Every single bite was melt in your mouth delectable. The side of macaroni was also delicious, a bit oniony, but good! Any attire is appropriate. Great place to go before a game!"}
{"text":"Went to a convention  with my shop. The owner lived here before and went for dinner. Beautiful inside. Excellent customer service."}
{"text":"Stopped in yesterday evening for happy hour before a show at Stage AE. I thought their cocktail deals were very good. Cocktails ranged from $5 a drink to I believe $7-8? The Tennessee Lemonade was a bit too sweet for my tastes, but I thoroughly enjoyed the blackberry bullet. I tried quiet a few of the cocktails on the cocktail list and each of them was delicious. I would recommend this place for a decent happy hour. Sadly I cannot speak to their entrees except for a few appetizers. The sliders were definitely good and the calamari was okay. I was not too impressed with the flat bread."}
{"text":"We visited Hyde Park last night for the first time (mom & dad's 2nd) and what a treat!  Sometimes you find a place with great food and crappy service or great service with OK food . . . but NOT at Hyde Park - we go both!!  GREAT service and ridiculously delicious food.  We are here from out of town so Hyde Park was a special family night out and as soon as we got out of the car at valet our wonderful experience began.  The restaurant itself was very posh and swanky looking & feeling inside, we got seated at a really cool spot and the waiter came over to introduce himself, Tim!!  Tim was remarkable in his service and was very personable with our whole family.  The manager came to our table at the beginning of the evening to introduce himself also.  We ordered steaks and the surf and turf . . . NICE sized portions of both the lobster tail and steak and everything was cooked to perfection.  Tim was attentive the entire evening and made sure our wine glasses were filled at all times.  :-)  Although we are visiting from CA and unfortunately have no Hyde Parks there (yet) we will be back during our next visit.  For the food and for Tim!!!!!"}
{"text":"This location is absolutely a perfect fit for the area, it offers an alternative dining experience with a ambiance that's much quieter than any of the other brand restaurants in Crocker Park. I met my daughter here at her request and it provided the perfect atmosphere for dinner and some privacy to have a great conversation. Our server Alex provided exceptional service the entire night, everything was timed perfectly and although attentive he wasn't disruptive and always professional, I'd definitely request his service again. I've been to several Hyde Park locations and this location is one of my favorites, the quality and preparation of all the dishes were spot on.

Wedge Salad - I usually choose a wedge salad when dining at a restaurant of this caliber, and the wedge salad here is exceptional, served chilled, perfectly portioned, fresh and topped with real bacon, candied pecans and an amazing blue dressing and no bitterness.

Asparagus - We choose this side to share and there was plenty for two people and I think there would have been enough for three. These medium sized stalks were roasted, extremely tender and full of flavor, the Parmesan cheese topping makes this one of my favorites and is irresistible.

Steaks - We chose the ribeye and bone-in filet, both were prepared exactly as ordered, high quality beef done right is always a winning combination in my opinion. The flavor of the steaks definitely stand on their own here, very lean, trimmed perfectly and it simply melted in our mouths. There's no doubt Hyde Park's Meat Purveyor provides a high quality product to this restaurant allowing the talented kitchen staff to perform their magic.

Lobster - We ordered a 16 oz. lobster to share and told Alex to have the Chef prepare it to his liking and surprise us he did, this was absolutely a great choice. The lobster was prepared in the oven with brown butter and served at the perfect temperature, it was full of flavor, very tender and presented in portions to be enjoyed without any work.

Desserts - This can be one of the more difficult decisions being they all are so tempting, I don't think you can make a bad choice here. The Crème Brûlée was perfect, the warm fired sugar topping paired well with the smooth chilled custard, if you love this type of treat you've be very pleased with the Chef's execution of this dish. The Molten Lava Cake and high quality vanilla ice cream is to die for, super rich and succulent you could over-dose on this one.

This dining experience was just what I expected from Hyde Park, they consistently provide the best of everything..."}
{"text":"Question:  when is it appropriate to serve the main dish while you aren't even halfway through with your salad???   

That was my experience at Hyde Park.  Then they just put my meal under the hot lamps so it came out dry and crusty.  

The only reason I give it two stars is because the bartender was very nice and pretty."}
{"text":"Dinner, with waiter Jason, was great. He knew the food & made excellent recommendations with my desires in mind.
Crab was marvelous for my son. The Pinot Noir was good & the 18yr old MaCallum was perfect."}
{"text":"Always a solid choice for a business dinner or quiet conversation.  It's a very traditional dining experience, but sometimes it's nice to have that when you need a break from trendy restaurants where you cannot hear the person across the table from you.  The Steak Brown (filet mignon with garlic, cracked black peppercorn, and Cabernet shallot butter) was ON POINT.  Perfectly cooked to medium.  The sides are generously sized, and the 3 of us shared 2 side dishes comfortably.  Service was solid.  I was shocked that we were there on a Friday night and there were quite a few tables open.  They have a great weekday special that includes an appetizer, main, and dessert (I think) for $19.  I think it's good until 4pm or something like that.  I have been to XO and I think you get a better steak at Hyde Park.  XO left a bad taste in my mouth when I ordered a steak medium and instead I got well done.  Not cool.  Hyde Park always delivers a solid piece of meat.  And a hell of a pretzel roll in the bread basket!"}
{"text":"Wasn't sure what to expect as heard mixed reviews.  When we first walked in the hostess did not greet us and proceeded to do some shuffling of papers before she would speak to us.  A line formed behind us which I thought was unnecessary.  Could use some improvement in this area.  Had to wait a bit from our reservation time but was offered a drink by a server. The restaurant seemed busy and was really loud.  Was surprised at the clientele's attire.  Everything from shorts, flip flops, ripped jeans, t-shirts to suits and ties, and evening dresses.  We were greeted at our table with an anniversary card, rose petals and a candle; nice touch.  Our waiter was very attentive and the manager also came around.  The food was very good and did not have to wait.  A complimentary dessert was offered that was also really good.  Restrooms really needed attended to as countertop was covered in water and overall the cleanliness was lacking.  Will return as the food and service were really good.   Would hope that they work on that first impression a bit and take better care of the restrooms."}
{"text":"I had a really bad experience at this place the other night.  My salad had rotten lettuce and the filet mignon that I ordered wasn't cooked properly.  I'll never eat at this place again!"}
{"text":"Your typical fancy steakhouse. I was surprised by how expensive the food was but it was all really good. We had 2 waiters and they started off on the wrong foot with me by taking over 15 minutes to get our drinks and about 30 minutes until we ordered our entrees. When I finally got my blue moon and my date got his wine, I demanded to put our appetizer order in much to our waitress' surprise.  By the way they have a great wine list but beer not so much. I started with a Greek salad and lobster bisque for my date. Both delicious and the portion of the Greek salad was unexpectedly very large. I had to ask for bread another thing they just should had brought out. They served delicious soft pretzel rolls! For my entree I got the petite filet which was tasty and cooked to perfection. The steaks come with onion straws but we optioned for the whipped potatoes and Mac and cheese as our sides. Both very good but highly recommend the Mac and cheese. To round off the night my date and I shared the molten chocolate cake with ice cream it was decadent! The servers got much better towards the end of the night and our food was brought out very quickly."}
{"text":"Hyde Park creates a great atmosphere for people who are looking for fine dining. The waiter are very attentive and ensure the food is above expectations. I would highly recommend the lobster mac n cheese and their flourless torte cake. This is a gem on Pittsburgh's North Shore."}
{"text":"Places like this have almost permanently done me in for going any place that is Fancy (capital F).

We had a party of 8 to celebrate a birthday, so we were ready to go all out.

We had 2 servers, which not sure if this was a common practice - but we certainly did not get twice the service.  

There was a great deal of pomp surrounding ordering and napkins, etc...but some basics fell apart.  We had to beg for an extra napkin, when they cleared plates for salads/apps - we had to ask several times for replacement forks/knives with our entrees. Getting refills on drinks was also a challenge.  

For the entrees, we all ordered some version of steak.  And they were wildly inconsistent in their done-ness.  Medium rare looked completely different on 3 different plates.  We did send one back (a rarity among my friends) that was way over done.

All that being said, my steak was good (ordered medium). The sides were pretty good - standard stuff for a steak house....asparagus, potatoes gratin, sauteed mushrooms, fries.

But, for the cost it was not worth it.  Fine for a work dinner or if you're in town for a game and don't want to leave the north shore (snooze).  Otherwise, unlikely that I'll be spending anymore of my money there."}
{"text":"Always pleased, Ceasar salad, tomatoe mozzarella salad, calamari , bone in filet, shared by the 2. Delicious. Great service, excellent drinks and nice wine selection. One of our favorite go to places."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to get a great steak, cocktail, and lobster Mac and cheese.  I came here after a brutal Buccos defeat and the place was packed...walked in and headed for the bar.  I did notice everyone at the bar had calamari which looked really good and was only $6 bucks...that's a steal a Hyde Park.  However tempting that calamari looked I passed and went for the petit filet, side of lobsta Mac, and spinach/mush side dish.  All delicious!  They do it right here serving the filet with crispy onions.  They don't have happy hour on Saturday but it looked like they have a bar menu with special pricing anyways.  Garrett Jones was up in here mellowed out but one obnoxious drunkard kept bugging him.  Ridic!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed!! We waited an hour and 1/2 for dinner that was not a good \"Hyde\" experience. 
My BF ordered a burger (medium well) - it was over cooked and dry. I ordered the Chicken Milanese and Brussels sprouts. The chicken was salty and the sauce was too thick and too cheesy. The Brussels were completely swimming in bacon grease and wayyyy over cooked.  Probably should of complained .... but it took so long for us to get our dinner. We will not be back."}
{"text":"The service was great but the Ribeye Steak was really tough and fatty they cooked me another Steak and it wasn't much better. The menu claims it is Prime meat but there's no way this meat is Prime ! If and when i go back I'll be sure not to order the Ribeye."}
{"text":"Post Pirates home opener dinner. Very upscale atmosphere Steak House right outside of PNC park. During game days they are accommodating with the dress. Typically dress code would be dress-casual or jacket required. But that is hold to uphold during game days. Which is ok because every patron at the restaurant at the time was in \"team attire\". 

With that being said, it doesn't take away from the high end quality of service you will receive. Wait staff is very attentive and well as the bartenders. The lobster bisque is the best I have ever had. For a steak house I actually had the Sea Bass, which was only ok. The rest of the group ordered steaks and said they were very tender and flavorful. In a group of 15, not one person had to send their steak back. 

Extremely expensive to eat so be sure to be prepared for at least $80-100pp to enjoy a good dinner and that's without alcohol beverages. Well worth the money on my opinion."}
{"text":"Hyde Park, What happened?! 

My wife and daughter took me here today for my birthday and it was a absolutely horrible experience! The service was so so slow. We ordered our meals 10 minutes after we sat down and it took 40 minutes for me to get my shrimp cocktail appetizer. We had to ask for bread because we were so hungry from waiting. 

It took another 30 minutes for me to get my lobster bisque that had no lobster in it what so ever, my wife to get her salad and my daughter to get her burger and fries. 

My wife and I both ordered The Filet Mignon and Crab Cakes. The supposed Filet Mignon tasted like liver and my crab cakes were burnt and full of filler with little if any crab meat at all. We complained to the floor manager and she got the \"Guest Service Manager\" Matthew S. He was very apologetic and took our meals, drinks and desserts off our bill. He only charged us for my shrimp cocktail and my daughter's cheeseburger. 

Before today we went to Hyde Park four to five times a year. It's a shame because that dinner totally ruined my birthday. 

I'm not sure if I'll ever go back!"}
{"text":"We love it here and always will come back. They are friendly and accommodating. The food is always on point and the steaks are phenomenal!"}
{"text":"I love the below reviews..... I will give it to you straight and honest. Hyde Park is like Flemming's, Capital Grille, Ruth's Chris, Morton's, Sullivan's, etc. It is a high end steak house. So, if you don't want that, go to the burbs and eat Outback. 

Hyde Park reminds me of a Flemming's or a Sullivan's, it has that wibe. Big large open space with vast kitchen. 


I went on a Wednesday, so there was no wait. The dress is all over the map. I saw jeans, suits and ties, and pants to small for the hostess. 

Overall the food was very good. It's better than Ruth's or Morton's, and yes Outback(refering to the dolt saying this below). 

You can get a steak anyway you want with any combo of bacon, butter, sauce, blue cheese, ect. It's pretty incredible. They also have high end Kobe beef. Not something you see everywhere. 

The sides are also better than Ruth's or Morton's. You name it, they offer it. 

My steak 10 OZ Fillet was perfectly cooked to temperature as was my colleagues. 

The service was over the top. It was too attentive for a business dinner. Our waitress interrupted us several times, but we always had bread, water,plates cleared, ect. 


I have had more bad meals in downtown Pittsburgh that I care to admit. I walked away happy and full like any of the other high end steak houses."}
{"text":"The food was amazing. I enjoyed the fact that we were able to share the sides. They were served a la carte and it was perfect to share with a group. My steak was cooked perfectly (medium) except for the crunchy exterior. This sometimes happens when I order a steak medium, so I'm used to it. 

I loved the pretzel bread too! 

The staff was super friendly and awesome as well! 

A+ !!!"}
{"text":"You would never know it by looking at this Hyde Park, but it is really a great restaurant.  It is located inside the Clarion Hotel which is a dump of a hotel.  The entrance of the restaurant looks out right into the heart of the Shell gas station- so curb appeal is one thing this joint is lacking.

When you get inside, however, it is a different world.  Rich in woods and stone, this place screams money.  The bar is healthily packed in the evenings with business people and the restaurant always seems to have most of the tables filled, which in this economy means they are doing something right.

The steak here isn't as good as Flemings but still better than Red's.  But the sides are really incredible.  Every side is just delicious, so order away even if it means you are going to have to take a bunch home.  Make sure you get the gratin potatoes- wow, they are great.

The service is pretty good.  I would say that the service in the restaurant area is better than the service at the bar tables, which is a shame for people sitting at the bar tables.  It's like they share the service duties between them, which loses a lot in translation.

This place has a really high-end wine list as well, so if you are trying to impress colleagues or looking to celebrate something special, you'll find it here.  

All around, this place is a great place to get a steak dinner."}
{"text":"MMMMMMMMMMM.....Yummy, Yummy, Yum, Yum.......

So we stayed at the Hotel across the street and decided to take a chance on this Steakhouse.  So glad we did!  We ended up eating here two nights in a row.

Let me start off by saying it wasn't cheap - but anything worthwhile is not cheap!

My husband had the Hines Ward filet and sauteed mushrooms, while I had a giant lobster tail and asparagus.  We took the key lime pie back to the hotel with us for later.  All I can say is this was delicious!  So good that we had the same thing the following night after the Steelers game but added the lobster macaroni.  Quite tastey!!

The place is clean and cozy.  The staff (Tim and blonde waitress - sorry I forgot name) was AWESOME!  Very attentive and everyone had a great attitude!

I recommend reservations as this place gets super busy at night and after games at Heinz Field.  GO STEELERS! 

If you don't eat here while in Pittsburgh you're truly missing out on a great meal!  I also understand that sometimes the players go to the restaurant.  We missed Hines Ward by 2 days.  All in all....spend the money, spend the time and have a truly remarkable meal experience."}
{"text":"If you don't like the food you will love the service. The steak was like ice cream the way it Melts in your mouth an so tasteful. I didn't want to finish my food because I knew i would miss it. They made my fiancé steak a bit to red they replaced it and apologized like they just broke an antique vase. Just a beautiful place great service great food great price. I had that steak Lebron last time which was delicious but on Valentine's Day 2016 I had the Urban Meyer filet mignon with the bone in which gave it an extreme beef flavor. I'm just so excited. I want to to go every week."}
{"text":"Delicious steak great wine onions straws were very tasty. Expect small portion sizes."}
{"text":"I would've given them 5 stars, but for the second time in a row they were out of our favorite red velvet cake. We come here every year when we make our trip out for a Steelers game because we know the service is excellent and the food is phenomenal. 

Lobster Bisque is a must have first course, it's a savory mix of cream and a generous amount of shellfish. 

I always order a rib-eye and get the crab meat hollandaise sauce, that makes the meal!! If you ask for rare- expect it to be cool and red. I ask for medium rare and its perfect for me, warm and deep pink. 

Fantastic sides here are the lobster mac and cheese! The lobster is plentiful and the cream in the cheese sauce tastes homemade, you know you are eating quality food when you take a bite of it. 

The grand finale is usually the red velvet cake, when in stock! This massive cake is enough to feed 4 people, we usually take it back to our hotel at this point and need to be rolled out of the place. 

Overall, worth every bite!!!"}
{"text":"I would have to say that the setting is below par for the type of restaurant they are running. I felt like our server was a little short with us because we were young, but who knows... The Crab Cakes were very nice and the sauce it was served with was also pleasant. Went with the Peppered and Grilled Onion Fillet which was awesome, but it is a steakhouse so I wouldn't expect anything less. We also had the Salmon that had a Crab Sauce on top of it. Pretty good, but you're better off going with one of their aged steaks. Potatos Gratin was very good also. Overall a nice place to go if you're willing to spend some cash and get good quality food."}
{"text":"I had not dined here in years but went in for restaurant week and had a wonderful time. The service was so so buy the crab cakes were divine. Loved the drinks and the atmosphere was lively.  Not sure why the reservation process is cumbersome but it didn't seem to be a deterrent since the place was packed. I will go again. Those crab cakes are addicting."}
{"text":"Wow great A+ steak. Had the bone in steak. Perfectly marbled. Lobster Bisque was good. Wanted to order the red velvet dessert but my stomach could not handle anymore food. Service was great and location is great."}
{"text":"The  appetizers, the side dishes, and the steak are very high quality and full of flavor. Creamed corn, brussels sprouts and shrimp cocktail are worth trying. Many great cuts of steak - difficult to go wrong with this selection. Excellent service, highly professional, and very hospitable. Top notch experiences all three times I've visited."}
{"text":"went here for the first time and the food was pretty good, but for the prices they charge, you'd expect that. Where they failed is in their service. When you go to a expensive restaurant, and this place is expensive, you expect to not only get a good meal but for the service to be outstanding as well. Well it not only wasn't, it was ok as well, but the thing that turned me off was that when I went to the men's restroom, there were no towels in the dispenser. I know that might sound a little picky on my behalf, but I expect more out of a restaurant that charges the prices this place does. If you want to make the top buck on your food, then I think you have to provide your customers with a top notch experience as well. I should not have to be flagging down an employee in a place like this and telling them I need a paper towel in the restroom. Maybe this is passable at Applebees, but not at this place for the prices they're charging. Left a bad taste in my mouth (no pun intended)"}
{"text":"Can't say enough wonderful things about this restaurant!! Amazing ambiance and romance!! We celebrated our anniversary there and found a few surprises in store forces when we were seated. Service was impeccable and efficient. Can't wait  go back!"}
{"text":"I had an exceptional time with our server Jen, and her assistant, Julia? (I forgot) 

We did not have a reservation as it was a Wednesday night. We came at 9pm when they closed at 930. They informed us that they will be closing the kitchen at 930, which was no problem at all. We totally understand since its our fault for coming so late. They took about 5 minutes to set up our table.

Let me tell you about this table. It was effing beautiful. I believe this table might have been for reserved guest? We had a small chandelier on top of our table, a curtain to pull around our table for privacy, U shaped booth inside with 3 chairs, bottles of wine on top of the booth, and positioned right in front of the bar and entrance. It was the best table in the whole establishment. 

Jen had already set us up with water, and bread before we sat. She did not rush us nor made us feel uncomfortable at all since last calls were in 30 mins. She explained the menu and the chefs recommendations perfectly. We ordered quickly because we didn't want to be a pain, but they were so accommodating. Perfect service for a perfect steak house.

Appetizers: 

1) WAGYU beef carpaccio! I. Cant. Tell. You. How amazing this was! After the first bite I wanted to order another plate. The beef was cut so thinly and almost melted in your mouth. Definitely not chewy at all. This is a raw dish so be careful!

2) Cesar salad. Basic salad, but it was a very generous size portion to share with the whole table.

3) Lobster bisque was alright. I thought it was too fishy. Someone else said it was salty. Another one said it was good. I guess it's just your preference. 

Main Entrees:

1) Chilean Sea Bass with the citrus preparation. AHHH!! just get in my belly! The sea bass felt like a steak in fish form. It was so meaty and just cooked to perfection with the citrus. 

2) Dry Aged 36 day Bone-in Ribeye 26oz
CALL THE COPS! This steak right here... Is worth it. Definitely share this with someone because you'd die eating it alone from the amount of meat, and flavor. The flavor was IMPECCABLE. Just throw it all in your mouth.

Side Dishes: always order to compliment your main

1) Sautéed Parmesan Asparagus. How can you go wrong with this? You can't! Order it.

2) The Roasted Brussel Sprouts were scrumptious, but too lightly toasted for me. The hazelnuts and the sweet taste made my cousin devour it though.

3) Lobster Mac & Cheese was fairly okay. I've tried better, but I liked that there were huge pieces of lobster .

4) CREAMED CORN!! Godddd! I can't stop thinking about it. You can't go wrong with creamed corn, and if you do, burn the place down. 

We also ended with a steamy Molten Cake A la mode which came out perfectly. 

The price was cheaper than I thought, but may be pricey for others. Try this place if you're not familiar with Hyde, because you can't find this place anywhere!"}
{"text":"If you're in the mood for Steak, please, by all means go here!  This steak is to die for.  I'm not even a big red-meat eater and this is the BEST steak I've ever had.

Das Mann wanted to have steak for his birthday.  I made reservations and they kindly had a birthday card waiting on the table for my sweetie.  Nice touch, in my opinion.

Food and wine was stellar.  I couldn't have asked for a better meal.  The man and his steak were happy campers.  The service was meh.  I wasn't a fan of one of our team servers, but the other half made up for the first half.  Over all we had a wonderful evening with good food, good wine, and decent service.

We've been back on a few occasions since.  Once on the patio with a clearly a new-ish server.  She was a train wreck.  Nice, but a red-hot mess on the service side of things.  The food and wine, once again, saved the day.  On another occasion we've sat at the bar for a glass or two of wine and haven't been disappointed.

Generally here's how I feel about Hyde Park:
1. The food is top-notch.  I wouldn't go anywhere else for steak.
2. The wine selection is nice.  Variable enough for the low-mid ends as well as a Captain's list which is nicely selected.
3. The ambiance is bizarre.  I'm not sure they fully executed what was envisioned.  The random display of art and kitche is just that, random.  I feel ambiance and interior is lacking and could use some love.
4. Service is hit or miss.  I hate the uniforms (not a big deal, I know) and sometimes I dislike the service.  

Should you go here?  For steak?  YES.  Be prepared to spend some cheese and enjoy every moment of it.  I'd recommend reservations but they are not necessary."}
{"text":"Well, I had really high hopes for this place based on reviews. It was good, but not amazing by any stretch. It was nice inside, service was excellent. We started with the Calamari that everyone on here is raving about. It was thin, chewy, and smothered in so much sweet chili sauce that you couldn't even taste the calamari it's self. Whats the point of that? I had the wedge salad which was very good. Then I ordered a Ribeye medium rare. I started into the steak from an end and it was outstanding, but as I worked into the steak it was very rare in the middle, almost blue, and got very tough. Ribeye is a fatty steak, you have to get it hot enough to break that down or you just end up with a big piece of meat chewing gum. So, I ate about half the steak and left the rest. They offered to recook it or give me a free dessert, but frankly I had eaten enough at that point. So, I would give them another shot, but I would definitely check doneness before digging in. I would definitely skip the Calamari. Oh, the garlic mashed potatoes are very good as well, highlight of the meal."}
{"text":"I am someone who likes to go out and eat and appreciate good food, service and ambiance. I have dined at Morton's, Gallagher's, Ruth Chris, as well as other independent Steak Houses. My husband and I dined on a Saturday night at 8:45. When we got there, they were already out of one of the two nightly specials offered. The one special that they had left we were told that  there was only one serving available. My husband ordered the porterhouse steak and he was told they were out of that. He agreed to have a bone in rib- eye, however they were out of that as well. He settled on a strip steak. Overall the food was very good, however the service was like a chain restaurant. For the amount of money spent, one would expect expert service, quality ambiance and the appropriate nose level setting. This restaurant failed on all three. 

I would not recommend this restaurant if you are looking for a romantic, quiet dinner,  where your expectations include white glove service and a complete full menu to choose from."}
{"text":"One of my favorite happy hour spots. I believe it's 4:30-6:30pm Monday through Friday. They have several mixed drinks to choose from, I recommend the pear martini which is amazing. Great flavor but they actually put alcohol in it. 
They bring you out bread which is fresh and hot. The bar area staff all work together which makes sure you always have water glasses filled up, and you have everything you need.  We went on a Wednesday evening and it was a great experience. Bar tables are first come first serve and it's a nice size bar area. 
They have a nice amount of options on bar plates that are discounted for the happy hour. They also have a bacon gruyere burger for only $13 that comes with fries and a pickle which is your best bet for a complete filling mill during happy hour without breaking the bank. I asked for my burger to be cooked medium and it was perfect. Best burger I've had in awhile. 
The manager who's name also happens to be Dana walks around to make sure the service is satisfactory as well."}
{"text":"I'm surprised by all of the not-so-great reviews about Hyde Park because every experience I've had here has been top notch. I've also had the opportunity to dine for both a work function and dinners with family and friends, so that is speaking from both avenues. First, Hyde Park offers their valet service which is great, especially on game days and concert nights when it is a lot more difficult to find a parking spot. The bar is very separated from the rest of the restaurant which I think is a plus because you don't have to be overdressed to dine here by any means. On game days, I've even come in jeans and a jersey and fit right in with the number of other people wearing jeans and jerseys as well. When you dine here, expect to see a diverse amount of people...a lot of businessmen and also those out celebrating a special occasion or just having a nice dinner out before a Steelers or Pirates game.

A great time to come to Hyde Park is before 6pm when they offer their early bird menu. It is around $20-25 (and the twin filets are included), and comes with your choice of salad or soup as well as a side. For as great of food as this place has, it's nice that an upscale place can offer a menu as such. The Lobster Bisque soup is very tasty as well as the bread basket selection they bring right away to the table. The Hyde Park wedge salad is a fairly huge offering of salad and not a bad option either. I'm not a fan of iceburg lettuce, so I prefer the Lobster Bisque soup.

I've tried a variety of things on the menu, including the salmon, filet, and hamburger, and I have never been disappointed.  The steak is always cooked to your liking and prepared very nicely. My personal favorite is the salmon, and this is even prepared to your liking as well. The sides are for sharing, and the potatoes gratin are always a good go-to for me.  Dessert is fantastic, but by the time dessert comes around, it seems like everyone is pretty full. They have a lot to pick from, including fruit type offerings, cheesecake, and chocolate cake.

The one thing I will say about this place is that you need at least 1 1/2 hours to eat here if you're planning on having more than one course. The service is wonderful, but they really walk you through every part of the meal, and this also means, like I said, by the time dessert comes around, you can tell everyone is slowing way down. 

The manager did hand out 25 dollar gift cards to use for a return visit which was really nice, too! Also, this is a great place to have a meeting, or a larger party."}
{"text":"I stopped here for dinner after dropping my son off at college. Since I was dining alone, I chose to sit at a high table in the bar area (no wait time). I ordered the Steak Kosar (filet mignon crowned with lobster) and sautéed spinach and mushrooms. It was SOOOO tender and juicy. (I did realize that I don't like bearnaise sauce.) Paired it with a glass of cabernet and it was perfect. No room for dessert unfortunately. 

Be prepared, everything is Ala carte and a little pricey for some but DEFINITELY worth the price."}
{"text":"Was looking for a quick get away from our family on easter and found something more.  On arrival you could still sense the brunch in the air.  We decided to grab a drink at the bar. Corey could not have been more inviting. He played the hand as a bartender perfectly. He Recommended exactly what we needed after that long day with our family. \"If you ever go there?  Stop and see the awesome staff at the bar.\" We got seated at the best table In the restaurant.  For one, it was a great booth overlooking the whole dinning area. Second, we had the best service ever. Our server Aaron could not have been more professional. Never intrusive or overwhelming. He recommended exactly what we wanted. \" we suggest steak.  Lol.\" We wanted to tell the manager stacy this, but stacy , corey and Aaron needed to hear it from our hearts.  Nice job stacy, Corey and Aaron. We are definitely coming back."}
{"text":"You may struggle to find anything better in the vicinity but that is not a good reason to give Hyde Park a positive review.  It too is sub-par.

For example:
 Steak is slathered with butter to mask the mediocre job done grilling it;
 Wedge salad is a kindergarten concoction of goop and condiments to mask the wilted lettuce;
 Beer is served in chilled glasses so that it has no taste;
 Even a simple dish, such as creamed spinach, is topped with cornflakes and factory cheese then embedded with unidentifiable brown items (see photo);
  ... and all the while a cloyingly sappy piano plays in the background while the locals revel in 'what a grand place' they have chosen to dine.

Ugh!  Ugh!  And, ugh!"}
{"text":"I visited Hyde Park on the North Shore in early October on a Saturday night.  There was a Pitt Football game at Heinz Field nearby so it was busy.  My partner made the reservation and the table we got was very nice.  It was a huge booth near the kitchen.  It offered some privacy and allowed a nice view of the dining area.  

The service was fine, not excellent, which was disappointing for such a high priced restaurant.  It was one of those \"feast or famine\" scenarios where we were either being barraged by not one but two waitresses, a water person, the manager, and the hostess or no one was around for 20 minute stretches when it was time to order or we needed something at the table.  My real issue with the wait staff was this: I didn't get that warm and fuzzy feeling from anyone that served us.  It was purely perfunctory service without any real concern for our experience.  It made it feel too \"chainlike\" instead of special which is what you want to feel when you are shelling out $250 for dinner for two.  I know it IS a chain but it should not FEEL like a chain for that kind of money.  

I think the staff thought it was my partner's birthday because she sat in the middle of the booth rather than the end which proved awkward later on when they brought a complimentary slice of chocolate cake with a candle (nice gesture but should have checked with the waitress to find out if we already ordered dessert - which we had).  The manager (I think) showed up with the cake when I was getting up to leave for the ladies room and proceeded to present it to my partner.  Don't assume if you don't know would be my advice for them in such situations. 

The food was good - especially the corn side and the cheesy potatoes.  The meats were very high quality and could have been seasoned better.  I had the Rooney style filet which was very delicious.  The apple pie dessert with vanilla ice cream was off the chart delicious - they make them to order so they arrive piping hot and crunchy with creamy ice cream melting over it.  

I know a lot of reviewers really liked their experience so maybe this was an anomaly or an issue on a busy football Saturday but I do not think I'll be back.  There are too many other excellent steak places in Pittsburgh with excellent personable service."}
{"text":"Went for my daughters 13th birthday. Was my first time there. Absolutely amazing! Great service, great food, great atmosphere. We both had the New York strip steaks and fries. Best steak I ever had. Table bread was great. Jumbo shrimp cocktail also the best I've ever had. Lobster tail was a little sub par for the price. I couldn't ask for a better night. Only down side was the dining room was crowded and it got loud, that might be normal for high end or restaurants for all I know."}
{"text":"Dined here on a Sunday night and was less than impressed. When I made reservations I told the staff I was in town celebrating a 70th birthday and a 15th birthday with my family.
The good: ample free parking, lobster bisque, and per my family, the steaks were good (not great) and cooked right. The waitstaff was very kind and attentive.
The not-so-good: They advertise early bird specials which seemed like a really great value but you have to ask for the menus. They were not offered voluntarily. There were 4 adults and a 15 year old.  2 of us ordered salmon which was very salty. I was able to scrape off the seasoning but the other salmon fillet was too thin to remove it. The restaurant was kind enough to offer free desserts for the two birthday guests but these were so disappointing for an \"upscale\" restaurant. They served s'mores. Yes, graham crackers on the side with a glass jar of chocolate sauce and melted marshmallow. Seriously....graham crackers. I would expect that from one of the lower priced chains, not when I am paying $300+ for dinner.
Won't be back. Next visit will be Ruth's Chris."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for our anniversary. He made reservations same day on a Friday and had no problem. There was a baseball game going on, so it was cheaper to do Valet for $5 than pay to park anywhere else. We both had a caesar salad and I have never had croutons as delicuous as theirs, fresh baked and so soft. I got the bone in Porterhouse steak medium rare and it was perfection the whole way through. Melt in your mouth and so flavorful. My husband got prime rib with bone in. Tiny bit overcooked but he still liked it. He said the mushrooms on the top were the best he has ever tasted. 
We both got dessert, he had \"Moms apple pie\" which he said was ok, but definitely not as good as his mothers. I had Red Velvet cake, the waitress warned me that it served 2-4 people but i still had to have it. She wasnt lying when she brought it out. It was huge. I had people at table beside me asking to help eat it. 
 Years past we went to Mortons Steakhouse which i loved, and Ruth Chris Steakhouse, which husband loved. Hyde Park is now our place to go. I cant wait to go back."}
{"text":"3 stars seems appropriate, in my book that's just plain old average. Upon entering we had to wait a couple minutes for a host/hostess to appear which was mentioned in a couple other reviews. We were taken to our table which was in a small room off of the bar, dimly lit and lots of deep wood. The bar looked quite large and had ample seating. The restaurant had a very strange odor to it, the only thing I can liken it to is the smell after you have a house party with lots of booze, it definitely was not good. They had a favorite wine of mine which was a plus. I ordered the surf and turf along with another diner in my party, the filet was tough but the lobster tail was quite exquisite. The sides were just eh for me. The service was decent, nothing extraordinary or over the top. 

I would highly recommend anyone considering a steakhouse in this area to try Red the Steakhouse instead. I find the updated decor and ambiance, excellent service and delicious food a definite step up from here."}
{"text":"We went there for a bachelor party with 7 people. we were seated in this fantastic VIP room with a vintage champagne cellar. It was very nostalgic and WOWed us right as we entered the restaurant. Our servers were fantastic, very knowledgeable and professional. The chef surprised us with special appetizers while we placed our drink order. Fantastic selection of steaks especially the aged options. The 1800 degree grill truly makes some amazingly juicy steaks. the bone in ribeye I had was perfectely cooked medium rare. the lobster mashed potatos are to die for. I had the STEAK LEBRON WITH RIBEYE and it came with some humongous shrimp topped with a fantastic bernaise sauce and asparagus. THIS IS THE BEST STEAKSHOUSE IN CLEVELAND HANDS DOWN. the chain RED from miami might be new but it doesnt beat the level of service and elegance achieved by Hyde Park. Highly recommend Hyde park for any occaision as they truly want to provide you an experience. and to top it all of chef sent out a GIANT red velvet cake complimentary for desert which was five star and first class."}
{"text":"It's hard for me ever to dislike a steakhouse;  what's there to dislike about sizzling beef, dark wood, old-school service and a wine list with pages upon pages of delight?

The prices are tad high given location and with decent regional competition, and the choice of having a \"Lebron\" steak speaks to strange marketing instincts, but all in all, with great service and stellar meat quality, it deserves every bit of a 3.5-4 star rating."}
{"text":"We had great service and fantastic food.  

When we arrived, we were seated promptly.  Our waiters, Aaron and Eric, were attentive without hovering.  

The wine that Eric recommended was outstanding without being overly expensive. 

The \"Colossal\" Lump Crab Cocktail, Blackened Scallops and Calamari were perfectly cooked. Our favorite had to be the Blackened Scallops.

Our steaks were perfect.  Just the right temperature and seasoned just right.  Two of us had the Filet Mignon and we both were very impressed.  The sides, Sautéed Mushrooms, and Asparagus with Béarnaise Sauce were great.

I highly recommend the Hyde Park Steakhouse for a special meal with friends or that special someone."}
{"text":"Definitely my favorite restaurant! Steaks are usually cooked perfectly! If you send it back, it'll come back just the way you want it. The ahi tuna tower is the best appetizer but the shrimp cocktail is also superb. Waiters are super nice! You will not regret coming here!"}
{"text":"Outstanding service, outstanding food, outstanding wines snd outstanding people. Can't speak highly enough of this place. Christina at the front was absolutely magical and she literally made every single off the wall request happen and in near real time. Seriously never a complaint here!"}
{"text":"Good food and always tastes better when you are not paying for it.  When we went, was not very crowded so the service was very good.  Ordered some really good wine and the filet was VERY good."}
{"text":"Terrible experience,  I specified I must have gluten free and was brought a steak with fried onions (battered in flour). The filet mignon was covered with butter!! We ordered a 50 day dry aged kansas cut and it was chewy as hell.  Uncooked broccoli, and a raw baked potato.  Kindly our bill was taken care of but what a terrible service for such pricy food.  I expected much better.    EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTING"}
{"text":"Eh is major feedback.  I've visited Hyde Park both for dinner and for happy hour drinks.  It wasn't a bad time but not sure that I'd go back.

FOR DINNER:
I had a Hearts of Romaine Caesar Salad.  It was fine as fancy-schmancy salads go.  The service was attentive, especially considering that they were packed.  I'd sum the dinner experience up as I don't really have any complaints...butttt I'm not sure that I'd go again.  Meh.

FOR DRINKS:
The happy hour cocktails range from $5-7.  There was a nice variety and $7 for a Cosmo with Kettle One is a fair price.  I also had two glasses of the Kentucky Lemonade, made with Bulliet.  Now, I've lived in the South so I have a STRONG opinion about bourbon lemonade (get it, strong).  The first round was perfect--just the right balance of sweet vs citrus and lots of whiskey.  The second round was made by a different bartender who was no mixologist--it bourbon with a splash of water and a lemon--and I wasn't impressed.  Hmmm.  Very inconsistent."}
{"text":"I went here as part of a dinner meeting last week.  This place can be easy to miss- it's right off of 271 attached to a hotel.  

When I got there, there was cheese, crackers and wine as starters.  Unfortunately, no wine for me since I was on call.  The menu was pre set for us as to what we could choose.  The lobster bisque was the first to come out.  It packed a lot of punch and had good flavor to it.  We also had a wedge salad with house blue cheese dressing and candied nuts.  Me personally, not a fan of a half a head of lettuce as my salad.  

For entrees, we had the option of a filet mignon, chicken or atlantic salmon.  I got the salmon with butter sauce and it was delicious.  Again, good flavors and good sauces.  Portion sizes were generous as well (I had enough to bring home).  We also had sides of sauteed mushrooms and garlic mashed potatoes.  Loved the potatoes!!

For dessert, chocolate tort.  Mine came home with me, but it was rich and some good stuff.  

Not sure of the prices, but I'd go back to try more food!"}
{"text":"I love Hyde Park. Here before a pirate game made sure to make a reservation and we got in right away! Tim out waiter was awesome. He was accommodating with our diets and weird requests!!!"}
{"text":"Consistently excellent food along with great service from all of the staff. Great seafood and dry aged steaks.  

The inside is nice and inviting. Its your typical chain steak house with a little more upscale feeling. Great appetizers and salad selections as well as their steak and seafood. Im a huge fan of good aged steaks. Their creamed spinach is like no other ive ever had and im picky about my veggies lol! The staff was very attentive and nice, they actually looked happy to be there working for the establishment which was a nice plus.

If youre looking for a good steak between $15-$20 then this is the place for you."}
{"text":"It must be me.  I just don't enjoy these high-end chain steak places anymore.  I got the strip steak and lobster mac and cheese. Nothing stood out.  Everything seems bland."}
{"text":"Alex (whom I assume was one of the managers) remembered me after ONE TIME. That doesn't happen in this day and age.

I ordered food to take back to my room this time. After discussing some menu options with Alex, who was working the front door, I waited at the bar for my food.

The place was pretty crowded but I was served immediately and got a glass of wine while waiting for my steak. Once my food arrived, the lady that brought it to me offered to send me back to my room with an actual steak knife stating that a plastic knife probably wouldn't 'cut it'. Hyuk Hyuk Hyuk!

The steak was tender and one of the best I've had in awhile. The Lobster Bisque is also worth a try. I want to stay here (the Clarion next door) every time I come to Cleveland."}
{"text":"We went to Hyde Park for a business dinner and were pleased with the experience.  Overall, a nice atmosphere with good service and reasonable good food, albeit overpriced.   I would go back for a business dinner but would likely not go out of my way for a personal meal.  Bottomline, your standard, high end steakhouse but there are plenty of others who do it just a little better - so why not go there instead."}
{"text":"Excellent food, drinks, and service. I had the baby heirloom salad with the crab cakes(which was amazing). This has not been my first time here, so I must mention that every time the food has been good. Lastly, my gin gimlet was quite tasty"}
{"text":"4 stars , stake awesome. will take my father there

Word limitWord limitWord limitWord limitWord limitWord limitWord limitWord limitWord limitWord limitWord limitWord limitWord limitWord limit"}
{"text":"I've been here before and everything was enjoyable for 4 stars, however my visit last night was disappointing at a 2. New avg = 3. The calamari was tough and chewy, many rings inedible. The chicken parm had an overly sweet, yet bitter sauce (yea, fault one on me for going fowl here) with large, yet mostly flavorless breastmeat. To close, the carrot cake, though gargantuan in proportion size with  six layers of cream cheese frosting and owning a perfect texture and density, was for the most part in need of more sweetness and I actually think a Tastycake would have won on a blind taste test. Sad to have experienced such poor food performance at an upscale locale."}
{"text":"I'm reviewing this from a happy hour standpoint. The drink deals are awesome. Had a fabulous Bulleit Blackberry drink and then the Pink Grapefruit cocktail (so refreshing, not too sweet or too tart). My boyfriend got the Bulleit cocktail too and then the Moscow mule, also great. The food was meh. And yes, I know it was happy hour so maybe they're not pulling out all the stops, but Ruth's Chris hh food is bomb. Just sayin. We got the tenderloin sliders and the calamari. Sliders could be good but the pieces you get are kinda small, even for sliders. Calamari was ok. Would come back for the drinks for hh for sure, and maybe to try their dinner menu since they looked good coming out."}
{"text":"We made a last minute decision one morning to head to Cleveland for the night. We also wanted something fancier than what we normally have back home so we decided on Hyde Park.
I called and made a reservation for 5:00pm on a Saturday evening minutes before they were open. Score! We arrived on time and were seated promptly and politely. The only thing that we had a problem with was we waited well over ten minutes for a server to where I finally got up and asked what I think was the manager who apologized and got us someone.
I ordered lamb chops, brussel sprouts and a wedge salad. The wedge salad was amazing! I recommend it. My chops were a little overcooked but still very tasty. The brussel sprouts had hazelnuts in them, which was such a simple add in but it made all the difference in a new taste.
The boy got your regular chicken fingers and fries.
The spouse got calamari, which I may or may not have ate half of. It was hot and spicy and still very crispy. She also got the wedge salad and then a random side of mashed potatoes.
The manager was kind enough to get our son a little chocolate sundae on the house.
We loved our experience!"}
{"text":"Very Nice ambiance with great service. We ordered a hot and cold appetizer that consisted of Oysters,Shrimp, Crab Cakes and Calamari. It was excellent. The reason for the 3 rating is that we all ordered dry rubbed aged sirloin steak as the special. All the steaks where $50 each and we all left most of the steak on the plate. The flavor was just not there. I think given time this may improve. A significantly expensive dinner that really wasn't worth the price of admission"}
{"text":"My wife made a reservation at Hyde Park for my birthday. We just moved to Pittsburgh from New Jersey, so I hadn't heard of them before. I've been to fine steakhouses before, but I'm always interested in trying new places.

This is a quality restaurant if you're looking for a top notch steak, or other options in a chill, inviting atmosphere.

The 36-day aged ribeye and the 22oz ribeye (served bleu with a creamy bleu cheese sauce on top) were both cooked to perfection. We had a lobster mac and cheese that pleased the palate, and completed the pairing with vibrant asparagus, sauteed with olive oil and parmesan.

My Hyde Park Manhattan was a real treat. Served Up, notes of vanilla, spice, and black cherry crept across the table as it was served.

For dessert, I had the collosal red velvet cake. Truly collosal, it's made in house daily and you can tell. The cake was moist and flavorful, and the perfect balance of sweet and richness. Be prepared to share or take home.

Our servers, Tim and Stephanie were a pleasure. Friendly and attentive, they also gave us plenty of room to enjoy our meals and our evening together.

As I am enjoying exploring food fare in Pittsburgh, Hyde Park was a definite hit. I'm looking forward to returning."}
{"text":"I went to Hyde Park Steak House at Crocker Park in Westlake, OH with a friend during the weekend of April 2, 2016.  We arrived around 7:30pm and were seated in a nice booth.  (There was a freak and brief snow storm so the place was not packed as it would normally have been at 7:30pm).  We each ordered soup, me french onion, my friend, lobster bisque.  Both were fantastic.  Both soups were served hot enough for us.  A manager came out after we had our soup to serve us each an amuse-bouche which consisted of a slice of lightly seared, excellent quality tuna w/a bit of micro greens and a dab of mustard and sriracha sauce.  Very nice.  We each ordered the rib eye with one accompaniment.  I ordered sauteed spinach and mushrooms, my friend ordered potatoes au gratin with gruyere cheese.  Both accompaniments were as good as we'd hoped they would be.  Our steaks were cooked perfectly, but our preference would have been to have the cook lighten up a little on the salt on our steaks.  This did not, in any way ruin our experience, but we both felt a bit less salt on the steaks would have let the steak shine a bit more.  The breads served with our meal were yummy--a ciabatta roll, a long, salted pretzel stick and two seeded flatbreads with a large slab of butter--one end dipped in ground pepper and the other end in what I think was salt.  I'm sure we could have had more breads but we were too full.  Neither of us could finish our steaks and so we took them home.  My friend's dog really loved the leftover steaks."}
{"text":"A solid 4.6 but I'll let 5 happen.. We dine out a lot, and as much as I wish I could keep up on  a review everytime, I can't or I forget. The bf and I get 1-2 nights out to dine a month. We've always been a favorite of capital grille but decided to switch it up for a change. Our whole meal couldn't have been more perfect. We went with a steak feature and dry aged ribeye. Becky and Sam were beyond over accommodating. They were very friendly and extremely on point. We really enjoyed this experience and will definitely be back soon.  (At least for desert) hyde park is truly solid and we can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Ate here with my special friend on a special date. The atmosphere was wonderful and the chef came out and greeted us since our waitress told him we were from out of state and this was our first time. This has to be one of the best steaks I've ever endulged in to be matched up with a gorgeous array of asparagus & loaded smashed potatoes."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying a steakhouse in Pittsburgh as I was here for work. I go the Lamp chops and it was delicious. The service was great and the bar tenders are always willing to go the extra step to make sure you're taken care of. I definitely recommend this restaurant for a nice dinner out with your significant other. Prices are not on the cheap side so be prepared"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing amazing meal worth trying if in the Cleveland Area. My father and I were in town for football game and kept asking locals where to go, but not one person suggested this place and wanted to visit a nice steakhouse. Walking by you really couldn't tell this was a fancy steakhouse and was across the street from Mortons but wanted to try a non-type chain. Walking in we knew we were in for a fancy meal with dim lights and very nice hostess. She sat us down and placed our napkins on our laps which was really nice. Our waiter Ramon was awesome attempted to sell us the wine list but told him the truth and gave us some menu suggestions and boy was he right. We decided to get the fried calamari with a Thai sauce and was out of this world and we left the plate empty. For my meal I went with the Kosar 12oz filet which came with a bernaise sauce and shrimp pictured. It was cooked perfectly and was extremely tasty. My father decided on the small 8 oz filet which also I tried and was cooked medium to perfection. Ramon our waiter made perfect suggestions for the sides which decided on the lobster mac and cheese which was perfectly cheesy and extremely tasty and we also got the cream corn which was not my favorite due to the bacon but I bet any bacon fan would enjoy. Also before our dinner came out this array of different bread including ciabatta and pretzel bread which were sooo tasty. Then we weren't planning on getting dessert but the table near us was getting read the dessert menu by Ramon and the homemade apple pie which Ramon made it sound amazing (great salesman) made us have to try. He was so right it was out of this world. This is a must get. Just be advised it does take some time to prepare. This place treats you like royalty and walking out you will feel like it after this meal. Great local Cleveland Prime Steakhouse. Must visit but will advise it is not the cheapest. But 100% worth every penny"}
{"text":"We had a wonderful time at Hyde Park steakhouse. 

The dinner bread was surprisingly very very good in the salted butter that they served with it was delicious.

The bisque that we had was delicious. It came out piping hot and very quickly.

The steak was beyond excellent! The sides were OK not to the level everything else was on.

We were very impressed with the wine selection and had some great Cabernet Sauvignon! 

The service was very great and the waiter stayed and talked to US a while about some things that were happening in the city that weekend that we would be interested in. 

We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"A solid 3.5 stars for good service and great atmosphere. The appetizers and sides here are excellent, including their lobster bisque (must try) and candied walnut salad. But their filet, despite being a filet was overcooked the night I was there. 

It's definitely pricey here, for the same price, I think more bang for same buck can be had elsewhere"}
{"text":"We walked in tonight, lots of empty tables all over the place and told 45 minute wait. We left. That's poor management!"}
{"text":"This is a great steakhouse. Here's what I like:
- Service is great, quick, professional;
- The table bread is excellent, especially the small pretzel loaves;
- The steaks are prepared accurately - medium comes out medium;
- The standard steakhouse sides are all here and all excellent (with a special mention of the Gruyère gratin potatoes).

I've been fortunate enough to have visited many of the top steakhouses throughout the country, and this one is right up there."}
{"text":"Come here when visiting good customers in Ohio. Pretty nice joint, great food. I had fish the last time. The Pretzel bread!!!!   WOW!
Would definately frequent it again."}
{"text":"Had the wine and gold Australian beef. Lobster mashed potatoes. Asparagus.  And a major pain in my stomach. Over 3 pounds of unbelievable food. My original plan was to take some back but it was so good that I ate it all. I would go back any time I am in Cleveland."}
{"text":"We had a large group in on Saturday and they were just as good with 13 of us as they were when I was there with just 2 of us.  Same great food and service.  I'm very pleased with everything here."}
{"text":"Came here for an even my during lunch. I think we had a prefixed menu but it was really great! We were in the back in this vault looking room. Really nice and quitter and private probably a great place to have a birthday or a small get together. The prefixed lunch was great started with a huge salad then a small well cooked filet chicken breast mashed potatoes and broccoli. Not to shabby! Love those pretzel rolls!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed in the service. We waited for 15 minutes for bread and 35 minutes for our  appetizer (soup and crab cocktail......neither of which needed cooked to order).  There were only ten tables filled on a Friday night.....bar was busy before a Pirates game. No excuse. Steak was luke warm, which took over an hour to arrive. I will not be back. Too many other good steak houses to frequent. Eddie Merlot and Ruth Chris  WAY better

Edit:  Ken, the general manager was kind enough to reach out to me. Very impressed the made the effort to rectify the situation. Class act."}
{"text":"Went there couple weeks ago, had a great experience. Excellent service, food, atmosphere. We had salad, steak, lobster mac + cheese, fries and some other stuff. Fries were a little bit weak compare to other stuff, Everything else was great, the price isn't cheap, but for the quality and taste it offers, not bad at all. I would definitely go back and recommend to my friends."}
{"text":"Its incredible how good steak can be!  Hyde Park prepares steaks so expertly, I may never attempt it at home again.  And, the service is incredible - very attentive & knowledgeable, without being intrusive.  A little pricey, but in my opinion, you indeed get what you pay for here.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Had dinner here the other night, I wasn't pleased. Our waiter was AWFUL! He actually told me he'd get yelled at if my water glass wasn't full of water at all times, this was after I told him I didn't want anymore water. Really? This guys job is on the line because I drank some water? I thought he was unprofessional and noticed the his coworkers felt the same way. Then I saw at another table the server actually talking up the food and offering suggestions!! The food, well, some of it was good after I seasoned it at the table. The steak was under cooked but the salmon was good. The potatoes were bland, the Bearniaises sauce that accompanied the asparagus had separated and the asparagus itself was huge and woody, could only eat the tops.  
The wine was good!   I expected more from a fancy $200 meal for two restaurant."}
{"text":"Went to Hyde Park with my boyfriend for my birthday and it was amazing. The setting is very nice, they had valet, and the service was excellent. We enjoyed the crab cakes so much we ordered another. Both our steaks were hands down the best steaks we both ever had. Our new date night spot!"}
{"text":"Food and service was well.......Excellent pricy but you get what u pay for service was excellent and the manager stopped at our table to enquire about our experience if you like Ruth crist's ......this is better"}
{"text":"Received a free amuse bouche coupon and it was delish. Goat cheese salad, also fantastic.  Great service, great bread, great wine.  But the filet mignon was the toughest, worst piece of meat ever.  I got a headache trying to chew it and left a portion on my plate because it was just too hard to eat.  Too bad.  I will not be going back because the price for what you ultimately received is not a good or tasty value."}
{"text":"I ate here last time I was in town and It was such a beautiful experience. The food was divine and our waiter Jeremy new the menu in such detail, and was quick and attentive. He has mastered the art of service. If you are headed to Hyde Park you MUST ask for Jeremy. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Best dinner experience ever. Went to Hydes for an anniversary and the table was covered in rose petals and received complimentary desert. The food was to die for and well worth every penny. The staff was friendly but still kept it professional. I will go to Hydes all the time now. 

BEST EXPERIENCE!!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely not. Completely ruined my birthday dinner! For some reason they thought to add water to the drink I sent back for being too strong, no. Then my dessert was frozen in the middle. These things I can look past as I am an understanding person. However, the fact that throughout the meal my server, Micheal blatantly ignored my table is inexcusable. He went out of his way to tip toe through the dining room in an effort to avoid my party. This caused our meal to be drawn out and unenjoyable. The food was up to my standard, save for the popsicle like apple pie dessert, but the service was atrocious. When I spoke to the \"manager\" Chris about my experience his only response was that he took off the Popsicle and the watered down Cosmo--not my focal point at all. When I tried to explain to him what was wrong he began arguing with me and saying I was wrong. The customer isn't always right, but the customer is always the customer and should be treated as such. Worst experience of my life. Never again"}
{"text":"Nine people and $900 later...

Business dinner for nine in the early evening on a weekday.  I'll say this about the place; the location was great!  Sits between the ball park and the football stadium and is right across from a decent Hyatt Place hotel.  I was impressed with the city but less so with the restaurant.

We had several appetizers including some big group seafood appetizer served on a tri-level platter.  I had a wedge salad which was excellent and also the salmon, which was very disappointing.  I thought the salmon was dry and almost tasteless.

Others commented their entrees were good so I'm cutting this place some slack but when the check came the servers kept coming by asking if the bill was ready. Come on, I just got a check for almost $900 can you please give me a moment to digest my dry salmon?

I didn't completely dislike it because it had some good qualities but I won't go out of my way to return."}
{"text":"Great happy hour and fantastic customer service from manager Ron Walker. He really goes out of his way to make ensure guest satisfaction.  Customer service goes a long way."}
{"text":"Location: Good downtown location, easy to find. We used the valet parking across the street at Tower City Center for $12

Ambience: Warm dark woods, and multiple small eating areas provide an intimate setting. The buidling once housed a bank, hense the huge safe that still sits downs the hall. 

Menu: Consists primarily of soups, salads, gourmet burgers, beef dishes, fish and chicken. 

Service: Eight of us went to Hyde Park on a Tuesday afternoon for an 11:30 reservation. We were seated promptly and menus/drink were brought immediately. We ordered our food in a timely manner but it seemed to take awhile to get our food. And it really took a long time get our desserts. However, the wait staff were courteous and attentive and we hardly noticed they were there. It is hard to say if the place was busy or not because there are so many separate rooms where the customers remain hidden from view.

Food: The bread they serve while guests are waiting for their food is out of this world good. Who doesn't love warm pretzel bread with melted butter? Yum. I orderd the Lobster Bisque soup, a 6 oz. Beef Filet, and squash. Unfortunately the soup was barely warm but the waiter promptly took it away and brought a new steaming bowl. Wow, it was creamy and perfect. There wasn't a drop left after I finished with it. My 6 ounce Petite Beef Filet was done as orderd - Medium Rare. It was just a tad on the dry side, though and it could have been juicier. Still, the flavor and spices were wonderful. My side veggie, squash, was buttery and seasoned just right and was a nice accompaniment. 

Dessert, let me tell ya, they have a Creme Brulee that was so decadently creamy it almost knocked by pantyhose off. The fired crust on top combined with the creaminess of the brulee was magnificent. 

Value: This was a work lunch so I didn't have to pay for it. The entree itself was about $22 and I imagine the desserts ran about $8 - $10 each. I'm fairly cheap so I couldnt' imagine paying these prices myself so I can't comment on how i personlly feel about the  value. But, if you want a high-class, gentlemanly place, this is it."}
{"text":"Over priced. Average food.   Excellent service . I ate at the bar. The next time I drop $60 on an ala carte strip steak it wont be here.  Seriously.   I wont be back.  The prices here are laughable."}
{"text":"What a great place. Went to celebrate our anniversary and didn't have a reservation. Got right in on a busy Friday night. 
Once we told our server it was our anniversary, the manager came over with candles and rose petals for our table, an anniversary card and we got a special dessert at the end of the meal. 

We had a crab cake for an appetizer. It was amazing and full of crab, very little filler. I had the Filet and my husband had the salmon Cesar salad. We shared a side of Brussel sprouts. Everything was awesome.

They really went out of their way to make it a special evening."}
{"text":"Overall, a class act.

At first glance, Hyde Park is old school elegance. Nothing pretentious. No fads or novelties. Just a basic menu and sinfully great food. My only complaint about the place itself was the dirty windows. Interior and exterior glass was hazy and spotted. It made the whole dining room look quite dingy. 

Service was great. It's been a while since someone laid a napkin in my lap. She was knowledgeable and accommodating. 

The food, although off to a bad start, ended nicely. We were disappointed with the sampler appetizer consisting of blackened scallops, calamari and crab cakes. The scallops were burnt, not blackened. There IS a difference. Horrible. I couldn't take another bite. The delicate calamari came smothered with Thai sweet chili sauce. I would have liked the sauce on the side. I literally couldn't taste the actual calamari. The crab cakes were just \"eh\". A little mushy and not enough crab. But they were the best thing on the plate. Thankfully, our server saw we were unhappy and had the appetizer taken off the bill. The right thing to do and we appreciated it.

The entrees more than made up for the disappointing app. We all had mouthwatering steaks, cooked to perfection, with various sauces. I had the horseradish cream, others had Bearnaise. I just love dipping steak in a great creamy sauce. My ribeye was wonderful. The gratin potatoes were excellent as well. The server was right on that one. Asparagus was perfectly steamed. I also had a wedge salad. It had a bit too much dressing, but it was really good. I loved the addition of the roasted candied pecans.

For desert, even though none of us were hungry, we shared a slice of key lime pie. It was super tart (the way it should be). Yum.

If you want a great steak downtown, Hyde Park is a sure bet."}
{"text":"We went recently for a friend's 50th Birthday party, and man it was a good time. The service and food we're outstanding, and the group had a very good time. They have fairly large rooms to accommodate large groups, and I'll definitely consider them the next time an occasion arises. Great experience at Hyde Park In Beachwood!"}
{"text":"I have always gone to Hyde Park in Beachwood.  Excellent mgmt and Excellent Servers. Excellent food and outstanding variety of specialty cocktails!

They just remodeled and brought in live music! Nice!!!

The weekday Happy Hour is pretty darn good, no it's great! You can order off of the revised food menu, bar menu or main menu. It's not broadly advertised but they also have an early bird menu until 6pm!

Chris, Keith and Anthony are just the sweetest of management and attend to every detail!

Servers Chris, George, Skylar, Amy, Gabrielle, Tabitha, Buffy are the very best!!!

Enjoy!!! Tip, no HH on weekends. .."}
{"text":"Well this has been one of my favs for years, years and years!
It's at the top of most for a plethora of reasons...starting with the management!
Keith, Anthony, Chris, Molly and Dana go above and beyond any expectation you could have from a classy place or any place!

They offer the very highest quality meals and if you are being thrifty, they have not only a week day Happy Hour 4:30-6:30pm that boasts creative cocktails and food....but...they also have an Early Nights menu that offers two price points that include a choice of your soup or salad AND the entrée!  You can never go wrong with the Chicken Milanese or the Chicken Parmesan!

The Bar Menu ain't too shabby with magnificent Burger options (my fav is the Bacon Gruyere) and the Shrimp Tempura Sushi Rolls being my go-to!!

...and lastly, but perhaps should have been FIRST to mention... the desserts are over the top! 
Save room for these calories because the wall of carrot cake, cherries jubilee, bananas foster and chocolate lava are not for the weak at heart!"}
{"text":"Where to begin? I was with a group of people on a business trip in Cleveland, and we wanted to celebrate the successful completion with a nice steak dinner.

Boy, did we pick the wrong restaurant.

Service: Inept. There was no one to great us when we came in, and no one felt responsible for about 5 min. This is while the restaurant was at 20% capacity. After we were seated, the server was trying to take our orders but was inept. We ordered some wine, and the server broke the cork and was trying for several minutes at our table to get the remainder of the cork out the bottle. Real high-end service. I am being sarcastic here in case that isn't clear.

Food: I ordered raw oysters as an appetizer, and they almost dry. It felt like the oysters were ordered and stored open, and not just opened to order. One of the worst oysters I had in my life, and I eat a lot of oysters.
I ordered a porterhouse medium rare. It came medium/well-done, and was not aged as advertised.

In a nutshell, the only thing high end about this place is the price. Avoid!"}
{"text":"Had one of the best meals/ dining experience I've had in a long time! From the minute we walked in we were graciously greeted by the hostess and promptly seated at our table (even with last minute reservations on a Friday night). Regan was our server and she was wonderful; knowledgeable and personable! From drinks and appetizers to dessert and coffee everything was prepared perfectly! I can't even decide what my favorites were but I'd definitely recommend the calamari that was lightly tossed in a Thai chili sauce, the lobster mashed potatoes are a must with huge chunks of fresh lobster, and of course the molten chocolate cake which is a slice a heaven! I'm glad I was able to set down the delicious Moscow mule I had long enough to enjoy the meal. Again, I can't say enough positive things about this Hyde park and it continues to add to the fine dining reputation the company holds. Highly recommend Hyde park restaurants or any of their affiliates for a guaranteed delightful meal!"}
{"text":"Last night I dined here and it was such a great experience. Our server was very knowledgeable about the various steaks and sides and did a fantastic job explaining the differences between the various cuts. I ended up going with the 9oz filet and it was to die for! Cooked to perfection and just the right amount of seasoning. The manager, Doug, was so pleasant and talking to him about the restaurant and downtown Cleveland was such a treat. I'd definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone in the Cleveland area."}
{"text":"Hyde Park is a nice looking fairly expensive restaurant. I called and asked for 6 PM reservation, told that there were 5:45 and 6:15 availability? Arrived to a sparsely populated place. 
My friend ordered a strip, and I ordered the Chef's special bone in strip $20 more. His looked amazing, mine not so much. I asked for a green peppercorn sauce (like au poivre) but was not close. Steak was on the thin side and much waste. My friends was twice as thick. 
Shared two sides; lobster mash potatoes- Amazing, and Asparagus- average. 
Ceaser salads were really good with new baked croutons!!!
Near perfect service! Overall pretty solid."}
{"text":"My son brought our family of 7 here for dinner. My 5 year old grand daughters included. We were treated with such warmth, from the hostess to the servers. Our steaks were simply delicious cooked exactly as ordered, as were the salads, potatoes, and asparagus.
The kids menu was really kid friendly and kept the girls busy with crayons and puzzles. My grand daughter said her chicken tenders were the best she's ever eaten:) This is a special place to celebrate any occasion and we will definitely come back. The decor is relaxing and the kids and grownups loved the large old-time Cleveland wall mural. 
Crocker Park is fortunate to have this fine restaurant that rivals any big city steakhouse."}
{"text":"Service and food are impeccable.  One if the few places you can still get a dry-aged steak.  Expensive, but worth it."}
{"text":"the hospitality of this place is awesome.  i made reservations a couple of weeks ago and mentioned that i was having an early birthday dinner.  upon arrival, i was presented with a birthday card signed by all the staff, which impressed me greatly!

i could tell that the restaurant is somewhat influenced by cleveland sports, as the menu has a few entrees with team/player names...such as the steak kosar (which is what i had).  my girlfriend had the bacon-wrapped filet, with a salad prior.  the portions were better than i expected.  i get my steak medium well cooked...this was flavorful, yet a teeny bit chewy, so next time i'll go medium cooked.

the feel of the restaurant was somewhat antique...best way to describe it is, if you've ever seen \"scarface,\" think of the inside of tony montana's mansion without the over-the-top furniture.  

overall, i enjoyed my experience here and definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Fabulous! Everything was perfect. The Urban Myer was tender and prepared perfectly. Thank You Kendra for fantastic service! I would not hesitate to go back to this location."}
{"text":"I'm a bit of a regular here, they do most everything very well and I keep coming back.

So why 3 stars? It's because they do everything well except the steak that is. Steak in this particular Hyde Park location is hit-or-miss. Temperature can be off, in my estimation 25% of the time. It is not predictably off either, can go a level up or down. This never happens with Red. The Hyde Park in the Westlake location is more consistent IMO and I'd give THAT location around 4 stars (I was a regular there before I moved from west to east).

Strengths (and why I come back): this is a great seafood restaurant. They do seafood here as well as Red does their steak (conversely I would not order seafood as a main entree at Red). The scallops appetizer is among my favorite scallop dishes in any place I've ever eaten; perfectly blackened and topped with bleu cheese and walnuts. The lobster here is grilled and not steamed, and grilled to perfection while retaining a flakey tenderness and smokey goodness to it, this has been the case more often than not. Other strengths: Crab cakes and fish, especially the Chilean Sea Bass.

Parking is extremely easy, but there is a complimentary valet which one would never have to use really, except in bad weather. It is also easy to get a reservation, even last minute. The servers are consistently knowledgeable, friendly and attentive. They have white table cloth and napkins that are kept immaculately clean, the mark of a high-end establishment.

If the temperature issues on steaks are fixed, then this would be 5-star."}
{"text":"Having never been to Hyde Park, I thought that restaurant week would be a great opportunity to finally stop in. Although we went on a Thursday, the restaurant was surprising full. When we were arrived, we quickly joined the rest of our party. Surprisingly, the RW menu in the restaurant was slightly different than what was listed on the website. The postive- more options for appetizers and entrees. The negative - no longer an option for a bacon wrapped filet. I went with the chopped salad, filet with mashed potatoes and onions straws and the chocolate torte for dessert. (All for $35. Not bad!) 

We were quickly delivered a bread basket with pretzel sticks, rolls and specialty crackers. Our salads arrived soon after. I was rather confused by my salad. Although it was chopped, it seemed to be topped with a creamy dressing when the menu stated it was a vinagerette. Even more confusing, there seemed to be some stray pieces of what ,the table agreed, was most likely chicken. Was my salad mixed in a bowl that previously housed a salad with chicken? Did a couple rogue pieces of chicken fall into the already chopped and prepped salad mix? We will never know. After the salads were cleared, our entrees quickly arrived. The entire table had ordered the 7 Oz filet with mashed pots and onions straws. The consensious was that the filets were cooked as requested and were tasty. The onion straws were crunchy and delicious but the potatoes were dry and lacked flavor. After finishing our entrees, we were quickly served our desserts. I ordered the chocolate torte. I was rather disappointed in the quality of the dessert. I also tasted hubs cheesecake and both desserts tasted like they were frozen, not homemade. I expected more from Hyde Park. Overall, my meal was rather average. If you are looking for a great steakhouse, I'd suggest Ruth's Chris instead. To be fair, hubs had been to Hyde Park a few years ago and felt that it was much better then."}
{"text":"Last night's dinner was pretty good in most respects except for the petit filet, which was over cooked and not nearly as tender as it should have been. The other dishes, including the tomato and mozzarella salad, shrimp cocktail, lobster bisque, au gratin potatoes, and bread service were excellent. Service was professional, drinks were great, and the dining room was attractive and not overly loud. Overall it was a pretty good experience, but a steakhouse ought to get the steak right! I'm giving them 3 1/2 stars, rounded up to 4, and one more chance."}
{"text":"Mother's Day is one of the busiest days of the year for restaurants. So busy, it makes going out a pain. Lucky for us, booking a reservation at Hyde Park was fairly easy!  They were not overbooked, there was no wait and the brunch price was reasonable. The brunch menu was a two course selection. I ordered the fresh fruit salad and the steak and eggs.  The salad was excellent and the steak was cooked to perfection.  This location is lovely, classy and clean. Our server was on top of everything. All in all, Hyde Park at Crocker Park is an excellent place to eat."}
{"text":"Outstanding restaurant, service, and ambiance!  Had dinner on NYE and they accommodated us without a reservation.  Definitely will be back when in the Pittsburgh area."}
{"text":"Blown away. The best dining experience I have ever had. The wait staff was pleasant and prompt. I had the \"Hines Ward\" the filet with cabernet sauce and my wife had the filet with bleu cheese crust. FAR AND AWAY the best cut of meat I've ever had. Can't say enough good things about our experience here."}
{"text":"I came here one weekend with a group of friends to have a nice dinner, and I was impressed.

We had two waitresses, which was kind of odd to me, but they were very attentive. They explained how all of the steaks could be prepared, the specials for the day, and answered any questions that we had.

I had the lobster bisque to start, and it was very smooth and creamy--very good. I thought the color was strange, though. It was bright orange, kind of like nacho cheese, but it tasted just fine.

For my entree, I had the 7oz filet that was cooked in garlic, peppercorns, and roasted shallot cabernet butter. I think it was called the \"Hines Ward,\" but I can't be positive, and Oo the side I chose green beans. Everything was REALLY good, and I was full without being stuffed.

For dessert, my friend and I decided to split the carrot cake. For anyone who decides to order the carrot cake or the chocolate cake--BE PREPARED. You will get a full quarter of a good-sized round cake. IT IS HUGE. One \"serving\" is enough for four people, I'm not kidding. Three of us had a good helping at the restaurant, and took the rest home, where it gave us three more helpings. The cake is only $10, also, so it's definitely the most bang for your buck."}
{"text":"Phenomenal experience/service/ambience. Food was amazing and our server Ryan and busser Phil were extremely attentive and friendly. I will definitely be coming back again. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great, friendly service, great tuna appetizer, steak ( American waygu) with Boursin sauce, asparagus and crab topped, and Brussels sprouts!  Simplified, just delicious!"}
{"text":"You definitely get your money's worth.  They had a three course special so my boyfriend an I both ordered the special.  The salads were huge.  The bread basket had three different varieties, I think ciabatta, pretzel, and a wafer looking one.  The bread and salads would have filled us up if we had eaten all of it. I had ordered lobster bisque in addition to my meal deal, it was just average.  
     My filet and crab cake was tasty, the sauce that was on top added flavor.  My boyfriend got the filet and shrimp scampi.  The shrimp scampi was the best I have had.  I'm not a dessert person but my boyfriend is, he got the creme brûlée, he said it was really good.  They packed up my key lime pie, we took it to the hotel, unfortunately we didn't eat it- so I can't say much about it other than it looked good!
     The bill was just under 100 dollars, which was less than we thought it would be.  The only bad thing about the place is the outside condition of the area, maybe that's just Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Whoa, did you hear that? It was a strange \"sucking\" sound...really...You didn't hear it? Oh wait, I know what it was, it was Hyde Park sucking all the money out of my wallet. Silly me, how could I not have known that I entered the big leagues when I walked in this place? You're almost bound to see a few Steelers here, CEO's, and other assorted big wigs. So when you want to play in that arena, you better be prepared to pay for it. And at Hyde Park, you do. Really.

Before I comment about the food, I must make a disclaimer that I am not a huge steak fan. I suppose I enjoy a good hunk of bloody meat from time to time but all in all, I typically steer clear. Ha, ~steer~ clear, get it?!

As of winter time 2006-2007, there are really 3 steakhouses in Pittsburgh, Morton's, Ruth Chris, and Hyde Park with the latter being a newcomer only opening in October 2006. So balancing between them, I would have to say Morton's has them beat in terms of steak, but Hyde Park is a close second. Whereas Morton's concentrates on just throwing a prime piece of meat in front of you, Hyde Park likes to dress theirs up in various sauces (mostly butter-based) and give them clever names like the Lemieux, the Stargell, the Rooney, etc.

Where Hyde Park lasso's you in (trying to stick with the whole cattle theme), is on decor and service. This place looks awesome, straight up. Dark woods, big deep red drapes, white table cloths, a fireplace. nice. The place begs you to come in have some great drinks and get your chow on. But the temptation doesn't stop there. The service here is so impeccable that you feel bad not taking any of their suggestions on wine, entrees, desserts, or where the restroom is located. My waiter here was friendly, smart, pleasant, and prompt. What more do you want when you're dropping $60 for dinner (that's for one person, ahem)?

A word of advice, when the waiter brings the check, simply throw your credit card in the binder, tell him or her to add 18%, and then sign without looking at the total. Follow that tip, All in all, and you'll leave here a happy, full person with a great, memorable experience. Until your credit card statement arrives but that's not for a few weeks, right?"}
{"text":"This was our first time to Hyde Park. We are frequent customers of the other steakhouses in the city (Capital Grill, Ruth's Chris, etc). We walked in and were told there was a 30 minute wait by a host. Then, the manager came over and said they had available tables. Odd, but we were happy.

The waitstaff was extremely attentive, kind, and knowledgeable of the menu and ingredients. This was great because we had multiple food allergies at our table.

The quality of the food was excellent. The meat melted in your mouth and the salads and sides were fresh. However, the timing of the kitchen was definitely off. Our steaks came out lukewarm and our sides seemed underdone. We had to send our sautéed spinach back because it was actually uncooked on a plate. My husband's bone in ribeye was cold as if it had been sitting for 15 minutes. However, the quality and flavor was still there. 

In terms of steakhouses in the Burgh, this is not the best. Still, it is worth a stop if you're at a game or on the North Shore for business."}
{"text":"The service was exceptional. I've never had such a pleasant experience. I met almost everyone working there because they were all so engaged with everyone there. The ambience was incredible with live piano, my favorite! Don't even get me started on the food. Cutting the steak was like cutting butter. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My basic formula for reviews of high-end restaurants is this: I have a base number no matter the price, and then I subtract the number of Yelp dollar signs. Thus, a restaurant that's about a 6 and rated $ would get five stars. The same restaurant, but rated $$$, would get 3. 

So Hyde Park is fantastic, and I don't have a single complaint. But the bottom line is that it's really hard for a restaurant to get that perfect 9, which is why I can't give it here.

-Steaks were delicious, well cooked, and everyone was more than satisfied.
-Seafood appetizer was also amazing- the calamari was presumably fried somehow, but it may not have even been battered, because it didn't feel like it at all.
-Service was great, prompt, and came and went at the appropriate time.

I just didn't have that last \"oomph,\" you know? Maybe I just wasn't looking for it in the right place."}
{"text":"Not bad.. The fried onions with the steak aren't to desirable in my opinion.. The steak was delicious... The wedge salad was ok.. Not life changing for the price"}
{"text":"Small scheduling snafu but they made it right. Great service here and they're  really concerned with your happiness."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town- Best Steak I've ever had in my life. Amazing, friendly, and attentive service. Beautiful, intimate atmosphere. Love it!!"}
{"text":"We have been to this Steakhouse several times. The steaks and food in general are pretty good. However, I like Ruth Chris and Mortons better.  It's still a strong recommendation because the service is excellent but you are paying for it but get ready to drop two bills if your going full courses, ordering wine, and tip. But again the decor is nice and its a great place to relax before and after dinner.

{"text":"First off I am rating this a 3 because the food was very good. Although I will start from the beginning. I went here with my family and significant others(7 total) on a Tuesday night with reservations at 6:45 during restaurant week. It started off great, 3 different people came to our table to introduce themselves, while the 3rd waiter explained the menu in very great detail. We then ordered drinks after being seated for about 20 minutes. A couple bottles of wine, and some mixed drinks. We then ordered about 1 hr into being there. There are 3 courses if you want to do the special which we all did. Some of us ordered salads as starters, and the other half ordered Lobster Bisque. About an hour after ordering the waiter came over and told us that they burnt the bisque and did we want salad. At those point we've been here for about 1 hr and 45 minutes with no food. Just bread. No apps, nothing. The 2 bottles of wine were already gone. After stating they length and that we want wine while we have dinner but hadn't even got our salads yet, they brought over 2 more bottles of wine and apologized and comp'd them. Once the food finally arrived everything was tasty. I got a 7oz fillet which was awesome. Other grabbed fillets or crab cakes and everyone seemed pleased. We got a few sides. Mashed potatoes and mushrooms which were also awesome. The food was great. I will probably go back at some point because I do not think what happened will happen again. Were weren't mad, as it is enjoyable to sit and talk to family. I live 10 minutes away and we were in our seats at 6:45 and I didn't get home until after 10. Food is 5* but I think the kitchen and staff was not expecting what was there. The ambiance was very classy, dark, and elegant. Very beautiful."}
{"text":"This place has some awesome items and some average ones. This is my cliff notes review...

Let's start with things that were above average...All steaks were awesome and perfectly cooked. The shrimp Oscar topping were delicious and I ordered extra. They do streaks well and would rate this 5 stars. 

The asparagus side was worth every penny and cannot wait to return to enjoy the best vegetable dish I've ever had. 

My smoked Old Fashion was the perfect way to start our dining experience and will be ordering again. 

Now the not so good....lobster bisque was average and had way too much butter. So much it was still floating after I stirred it up. Gross. Stay away. 

Brussel sprouts were also below average and lacked the flavor found in the asparagus. 

Overall, I will return and know which items to reorder and avoid the bland sprouts and \"heart attack in a bowl\" lobster bisque."}
{"text":"$200+ for a meal for two?  OK, let's get the financials out of the way.  Here's our bill as a sample of what to expect:

$2.60 per raw oyster (appetizer)
$7.50 slice of cheesecake (dessert, shared)
$8.00 steamed broccoli (side, shared)
$8.50 potatoes au gratin (side, shared) 
$9.00 tomatoes & mozzarella salad (appetizer)
$9.50 cocktail (each)
$9.50 grilled asparagus (side, shared)
$14.50 giant scallops, 2 pieces (entree add-on)
$46.00 porterhouse (non-aged)
$65.00 ribeye (aged)

Of course you can swing both ways on the total price of dinner.  There are less expensive options such as the non-aged and smaller portions of meat.  Or you could flip the other way with the Japanese Wagyu Beef ($150.00) and a 1oz sifter of Louis XIII Cognac ($150.00).  But you'll be hard-pressed to get out with a bill under $50/person unless you order the bare minimums or go vegetarian. 

If you're OK with the prices, let's move on...

We have been consistently spoiled by Crown Grill restaurants aboard Princess Cruise Lines ships which feature immaculate cuts of aged beef and lamb.  So we were looking to be impressed by an upscale steakhouse on land.  Here's our experience with Hyde Park:

QUALITY - Excellent!!  Anyone having read my reviews of higher-end establishments know that oysters-on-the-half-shell are my litmus test (a kitchen with less-than-excellent quality and cleanliness standards or equipment is easily detected) and Hyde Park passes with flying colors!  In fact, they were probably some of the best raw oysters I've ever had in Cleveland!  That's not to say the rest of dinner wasn't just as delicious - everything was great!  

SERVICE - It's obvious service is guaranteed at this establishment.  From the complimentary valet to the coat check greeting you at the door, you feel welcome from the get-go.  The front end manager circulated through every table and was prompt and thoughtfully accommodating.  And the service continued with a smile all the way through departure.  Takeout was packaged by the wait staff. 

SURROUNDS - Hyde Park is a lot larger and crowded than I had expected and features multiple dining areas and a separate bar.  Ambient lighting is adequate but not so drastically subdued that you can't see the next table over or the food in front of you.  The mood was far more hustle & bustle than calm or sublime with a seemingly large army of wait staff, hostesses (3), bussers, managers, etc. constantly moving back and forth.  Decor includes statues and artwork of dogs and horses.  For comparison sake, Hyde Park seems almost as large in seating and bustle as a Longhorn or Texas Roadhouse and opposite of a Ruth Chris in activity level and mood.

ISSUES - A couple of times we sat with dirty dishes in front of us for 10 to 15 minutes waiting for our waiter to return.  Our steaks came out at least a full temperature cooler than requested (requiring refire).  When the refire came out still not cooked enough, I simply decided to just take it home and microwave it to temperature later.  Seasoning was a bit lacking on the steaks right out of the kitchen - a little salt & pepper made ALL the difference in bringing out the great flavor in both steaks. 

In conclusion, I give 4/5 stars as I expected a little more perfection in food preparation and proactive service for the price we paid.  I give the excellent quality and freshness of ingredients a full 5 stars - you can't get better than this.  Overall, we'd consider coming back again - price being the only limiting factor.  And if I were were to be asked,  \"Ruth Chris or Hyde Park?\" my response would be Hyde Park (although my wife claims Ruth Chris is better)."}
{"text":"The steak was not very good. My girl ordered her steak medium well and it definitely came out medium rare. The server didn't bother us too much which is what I like. I had a better steak at longhorn. I got the porterhouse and it was nothing special. I probably will not return"}
{"text":"I was here on business and since the president of my company was in town instead of my usual happy meal on the road we hit a steak house.  

I started with a Greek salad, it was a nice portion, pretty standard.  I went with the 7 oz filet topped with the peppercorn Cognac Bordelaise sauce which I thought turned out very nice. They had three other sauces/toppings offered and two other cuts for my steak alone, so they have plenty of options.  The sides are family style and we enjoyed the gruyere potatoes and lobster mac n cheese. I had a few glasses of a decent zine I had never tired before, Gott.

The service was decent, although I did find it odd they kept serving the only woman at the table last instead of first.  A minor thing, but at a place that seems to try to up the service and stress fine dining, it did stick out a little.

To Recap

The Good: The service was good, the options in terms of quantity for the toppings and sides were plentiful.  Overall a nice night out.

The Bad: Steakhouses always feel the same to me.  This didn't do anything wrong, but it didn't do anything to make it stand out against other beef carvers in this category.

The Band This Restaurant Most Resembles:  Third Eye Blind.  It is OK while I am listening to it, but I forget it as soon as it is over."}
{"text":"Service and food here are exceptional. The bread basket they give you pre meal is two meals all in itself! 

This is a great little gem of a Restauraunt is tucked away by hotels which are less than impressive in comparison.

If you come in typical street gear- a sweatshirt and jeans, like we did- expect to be seated away from those who are dressed nicely. 

We weren't offended and enjoyed the privacy! Just wish we saved room for one of the desserts!"}
{"text":"I've been to Hyde Park about a half-dozen times, so this review is from a mix of experiences.  The main dining room is relatively small and intimate, but the bar area also offers a comfortable environment to just grab a drink or even get a steak for dinner.

Among the soups and appetizers, the Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail was pretty solid, but the shrimp were not as over-the-top large as the shrimp cocktail at Morton's downtown.  The Lobster Bisque is solid, and I am also a fan of the Hyde Park Wedge salad, with its blue cheese dressing and candied pecans.

As for steaks, I opt for the basic Ribeye with its USDA Prime marbling.  Hyde Park has nailed a medium-rare preparation every time I've ordered it.  I've also had the Bone-In Ribeye, but I remain unconvinced the cut with the bone attached is really that much (if at all) more flavorful.  On one occasion, I added a small lobster tail to my steak to make my own little surf n' turf--it was pretty underwhelming and definitely something I would pass on in the future.

For sides, the Potatoes Gruyère Gratin are the way to go (though be forewarned that this is a really rich and weighty side dish).  The other sides were about average for an upper-tier steakhouse.  I love the pretzel bread.

I think the level of service is commendable.  The servers retain a certain formality while still being \"clubhouse-casual friendly.\"  The staff does seem focused on both maintaining a high level of quality in its food and making sure its customers are comfortable.  Of course, all of this comes at a price.  A dinner with drinks or wine can easily hit $70 - $80 with tip.  On the flip side, this is cheaper than Morton's downtown, but I think Hyde Park is a step behind Morton's in terms of food and overall experience."}
{"text":"I don't order much steak, as I like it well done and a lot of places can't get it right.  My steak last night was perfect.  I ordered the petit filet (7 oz.) and had it butterflied.  Delicious.  We were a group of 10 there for a surprise birthday party.  They did a great job helping us surprise the guest of honor.  And, how about this?  The manager followed us out into the rain to tell my friend she tipped on top of the group gratuity, giving her a chance to correct it if she wanted.  Fabulous service.

That being said, Hyde Park has some work to do in other areas:

1 - they told us they were out of pretzel bread.  How do you run out of bread on a Saturday night?  We made some good-natured complaints, and lo and behold, hot, fresh pretzel bread appeared.  It is fantastic.

2 - the women's bathroom ran out of toilet paper, and one of the doors doesn't lock.  Leaevs a poor impression.

3 - my friends ordered mojitos from the manager as they were first to arrive.  Our server brought them - one taste and the look on their faces said it all.  Yuck.  The server (love his honesty) told us if they'd ordered from him he would have suggested they not get them.  He also steered me away from ordering a margarita because they serve it in a short glass.  Stick with the wine list or order simple drinks.

I will go back to Hyde Park."}
{"text":"Our first visit to Hyde park was three years ago when we were in Pitt to see the Steelers play.  It was October 26 (my birthday).  When the manager found out it was my birthday he had arranged beautiful rose pedals sprinkled on our table. It was a very nice gesture!  Needless to say that set the tone in a very positive way for our visit.   I told the waiter to surprise me with a cocktail and he did.  It was a delicious martini ! Our dinner and service was AMAZING!  We make it a point to have dinner at Hyde Park every time we are in Pittsburgh.  We also recommend to everyone we talk to while we are in the burgh!  See you next fall! .   Sorry it took this long to write my review."}
{"text":"The food was amazing, I had the biggest steak of my life there. cooked to perfection. The waitress was great, put up with all of our stupidy. The manager (Stacie) was amazing. Was there with my friend that I have not seen in a long time, both celebrating our Birthdays with a great meal then a Pirate game.  Everyone should give this place a try, a little expensive but well worth the price. And I do not say this lightly since I live pay check to pay check most of the time."}
{"text":"Had a business dinner here this week. The food was really good - I had a \"Steak Brown\" (Filet mignon, garlic, cracked black pepper, roasted shallot Cabernet butter) with a side of lobster mashed potatoes. Shared a couple bottles of satisfactory red wine with the group as well. The meal was a bit pricey, so probably not a place I would come to on my own. The service wasn't the greatest either. After desserts were ordered, took well over half hour to deliver them and one of the party members dessert was completely forgotten. I just ordered a latte. The waitress said they couldn't do this, they only had cappuccinos. But then I explained to her that a latte was same as a cappuccino, just without the froth. After she understand that, she accommodated my request. So, overall, an A-OK place for a business meal. Not sure about much else beyond that."}
{"text":"This was an \"out-of-the-ordinary\" visit for my family and me. We knew going in that Hyde Park Prime Steakhouse was expensive but rightfully so. The white tablecloth atmosphere was very personable and we felt like we were treated like VIPs. All of the food was tasty and appropriately priced for a high end steakhouse. I tried a wedge salad along with my steak and was also very pleased with it."}
{"text":"We attended a wedding rehearsal dinner at this restaurant. The fillet mignon was absolutely incredible and melted in your mouth. They are cooked to perfection as well. 

The crab cake we had was good but being from Southern Maryland on the Chesapeake Bay, we are probably a little spoiled. Excellent atmosphere and great steaks."}
{"text":"We had a reservation for 9 at 6:00 on a Sunday after a Steeler's home game.  There was no wait, even though the restaurant was busy.  The wine list was thorough and I saw several of my favorites on the list.  We ordered appetizers, which came in a reasonable amount of time.  I had half of one of the crab cakes - yum! I also tasted my sister-in-law's lobster bisque - it was very good.  The salad came next but not too quickly, allowing everyone to finish their appetizers.  After the salad course, then the main course.  I like my steak well-done and always have trouble because most of the time it is either too chewy or too dry to eat once it is completely cooked.  I had ordered the Steak Dijon (it's called something else on the menu) but it was a 7 oz tenderloin wrapped in bacon and served with a dijon hollandaise sauce.  I have never had a steak that good ever.  It was to die for.  The bacon was cooked to perfection and the steak practically fell apart.  I barely needed my steak knife to cut it.  And the taste?  OMG.  For sides, we had ordered the potatoes gruyere gratin and asparagus.  I only had the potatoes but , wow.  I personally don't care for asparagus, but the comments around the table that it was perfectly done.  After everyone finished the main course, it was time for the dessert.  I highly recommend the Creme' Brulee.  I split it with my sister-in-law and neither of us was disappointed.

All in all, the experience was wonderful.  The service was excellent, the food was excellent, the decor was very tasteful.  I wouldn't take my kids here unless they were older.  From start to finish it took about 2 1/2 hours.  The price?  Well, let's just say that if you have to ask how much something costs, then this is not a place that you can afford.  Definitely something for a special occasion, though.  I would definitely return here!"}
{"text":"Why not a 4? When I called to make a reservation I was placed on hold for 7 minutes! It was Thursday around 7PM. The very first impression started off slow! But the service and Food was **** Star although I would choose Eddie Merlot over Hyde, Ruth and The Capital Grille just on preference of taste! Some food appease certain people's taste buds more than others and their food is splendid also! The Lobster Mac was good but Eddie's is the Best along with how the Steak tastes without the enhancement of Lobster, asparagus added! The Meat was much more dense! Tender and tastier! The Service was great at both locations but Eddie was more Modern and bright compared to Hyde being dark and secretive! It was a nice experience just to say \" I ate there\" - they did impress me at the bar before we ate with a cherry based Manhattan! So smooth, it was a treat! The Apple Pie Ala mode was special also! Oven baked and actually enough for 3. I like Hyde but did not fall in love."}
{"text":"I have never been too disappointed here.  I go attest once a year with my family.  I frequent a lot of higher end steak restaurants.  I always get the bone in filets at all the restaurants.  My gripe is they can't do + (plus) on the temperature.  Lobster bisque is ok but you would be lucky to get a chuck of lobster.  Wedge salad is good.  Mushrooms and Brussel sprouts are good. For dessert- crem brûlée"}
{"text":"I'm not a red meat eater but still love to dine here for the beautiful dining room, great service, and excellent seafood and sides.  Most recently had the sea bass - yum !  I chose the citrus butter sauce.   Delic.  It is expensive but it's a special occasion place.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I've been to Hyde park twice. The service was excellent and the food was  well prepared (asked for a medium well steak and got a medium well). I actually did not like the lobster bisque as much as whole foods' but maybe because whole foods' soup is more cream based?
Excellent service, very well attended. Well visit again!"}
{"text":"We had dinner in the bar last night the bartenders were wonderful. The food was fantastic and Brandi took great care of us!"}
{"text":"Pretty nice little steak house. Had some reasonably nice wines from Napa and Paso Robles that complimented the filet quite well. 

Apps included shrimp cocktail and crab cake. A greek salad and garlic mashed potatoes and brussels sprouts as sides. 

Overall great client dinner!

Cheers,

{"text":"I wish I could give this restaurant 10 stars. This had to have been one of the best dining experiences I've ever had. I made a 7:00pm reservation for my wife's birthday. We arrive at 6:30pm figured we would have a few drinks before dinner. But when we arrived the manager said we could be seat for dinner. We still chose to sit at the bar. Drinks were priced well. So we finally went to be seated for dinner and to our surprise we had a private booth waiting for us with a happy birthday note for my wife. Service was amazing food was amazing. A bit pricey. But didn't mind paying for great food and service. If you can afford it definitely go here. Will be back again guarantee."}
{"text":"I know it's a chain restaurant (yes a good one) (my husband hates chain restaurants) but they always cook their lobster tails to perfection every time! I 3 stars b/c they used the table in front of us as an area to clean wine glasses, they also need a revamp in the servers attire!"}
{"text":"Another wonderful experience at Hyde Park Beachwood.
Food, Service, and ambience were perfect."}
{"text":"When in Pittsburgh steaks must be ordered Pittsburgh style.  Amazing service.  Elegant ambiance.  Fantastic"}
{"text":"Just found out this is one of Cameron Mitchell's restaurants.  I'm from Columbus and am a huge fan of Ocean Club and The Pearl.  The salmon and lobster bisque were the highlights of my meal.  The bisque was one of the best I've had.  The atmosphere on the fancy side and the price point is on the higher end.  They have complimentary Valet and are located next to the Doubletree in Beachwood, near the junction of Chagrin and 271.  I can't speak to the steak here since I don't eat beef but they do serve seafood, chicken and lamb."}
{"text":"I had a steak and they brought it Uruguay.  After 2 bites I wanted to call the farm in Uruguay and ask how do you make it that tender.  This was a special for that night but My God the best steak I ever had."}
{"text":"Love their Kobe burgers, and you always get top notch service. Very reasonably priced for lunch, but I can't speak to the dinner costs"}
{"text":"I was at HydePark for a business meeting. Good place to conduct a meeting especially when the food and drinks are excellent. I had the bone in filet (yes they have this), best of both worlds for steak in my opinion. The service was attentive but not over the top. The cost is what you would expect for a steak house. I suggest the lobster Mac n cheese, good stuff."}
{"text":"I've now been here two times, both on business dinners with an important client and for the amount spent, I'm not impressed.  Food is good but not great.  I ordered my steak rare (i told them \"as rare as possible\"... it had a warm red center.  The asparagus side that was ordered had such huge stalks that were very tough.  They serve seafood and have no idea of its origin (and much of it is on the \"AVOID\" list from Monterey Bay Aquarium's Seafood Watch).  And to top it all off, they had no non-dairy options for coffee at the end of the meal.  Our server was very kind and offered to run to the nearby gas station to get me some, I declined.  

Service was great... but overall, not a place I have any intention of returning to."}
{"text":"I have been to several of the so called \"high end\" steakhouses in the greater Pittsburgh area and time and time again I find myself retreating back to Hyde Park. I am yet to find a field in which Hyde Park is lacking. The service is impeccable, the appetizers are irresistibly indulgent, and the entrees are prepared with great care and regard for excellence. On my most recent visit, I was pleasantly greeted with a warm smile by a lovely hostess named Shannon. We had no issues booking our reservation and were promptly lead to our dining table upon arrival. Right of the bat, we were treated with a high level of professionalism from every staff member that crossed our paths. Everything was incredibly clean and well organized as we reached our table. After placing our orders, our drinks and food arrived with great urgency. It was a rather busy Saturday night, and I was impressed by how the staff was able to attend to our table as if we were the only ones in the dining room. The calamari was my app of choice, and it was the perfect combination of textures and flavors to prepare my palate. The breading was light and crispy and paired very well with a spicy Thai glaze. I ordered a filet as my main dish. All of our steaks arrived exactly as requested. My filet was a succulent medium rare with pristine presentation and dressed with just the right amount of fried onion straws. Halfway through our meal we were welcomed by a very accommodating general manager named Ken. By the end of the night my entire party was too full to order any desserts, but speaking from the past, I'm yet to come across one that disappoints. The whole experience could not have been more enjoyable, and I will, without any doubt, be returning as soon as possible."}
{"text":"Thank you Restaurant Week! 

Food:

Went on a Thursday at 5pm. It was ALL RESERVED! WTF. So my friend and I were lucky enough to score to corner seats at the bar. Worked out great. Nice attentive bartenders. 

Caesar salad - the bomb. Hugeeee. SO good

2 petit filet mignon (rare) - excellent. Just that it could have been a tad warmer, but not that big of a deal. 

Dessert - the Flourless Chocolate Torte - TO DIE FOR. I mean I died and and went to heaven. This dessert is crack. 

Atmosphere:

Total business vibe. Not really a date night, but I could see it. I felt super fancy but yet there were a TON of people dressed for the Cavs game, which was cool."}
{"text":"We made reservations online for our anniversary. They had our table ready with rose petals, candle and an anniversary card signed by all the staff. The service was excellent and the food was AMAZING! They really know what they are doing. The staff work together and make your experience memorable. They are a little more pricey than the usual steakhouse but are worth every penny! Love love love this place!"}
{"text":"I've been to this Morton's twice so I'm comfortable in providing my thoughts. 

From a food quality and atmosphere perspective I would give them a solid 4. Candidly, I don't see much difference between Morton's and any of the other high end chain steak houses, ie., Ruth Chris, Prime, etc. There is only so much you can do with a steak. 

The side items are all al la carte and pricy, however the portion sizes are reflective of the price. As would be expected there is an extensive wine list and it also reflects typical restaurant mark-ups.

What I was not overwhelmed with was the staff. Don't get me wrong, they were attentive and efficient and all did their jobs but on both of my visits there is an air of arrogance from everyone. Absent is any kind of sincere smile or \"welcome, great that you've selected us for dinner\".  I think this is where the independent steak houses excel; they really make you feel welcome.

The net/net, this Morton's is a very good place for a steak, but it lacks the total package from a service perspective that I would expect when paying the prices they charge."}
{"text":"On a whim, we decided to try Hyde Park, because people rave about it all the time (seriously, ALL the time).  We went mid-week, so reservations weren't necessary.  We were greeted promptly upon entrance and our coats were swiftly taken to the coat check.  The hostess kindly obliged when I asked her to sit by the fireplace, which made me very happy and quite warm.  And that, more or less, was the last point in the evening when I was impressed with Hyde Park.

When it came to food and service, the restaurant left quite a bit to be desired.  Our waitress was pleasant but busy (and consequently very, very inattentive).  And seriously, who wants to spend half of their dinner trying to flag down a waitress for water or wine?

We had the tuna tower for our appetizer, which was sashimi tuna on a bed of avocado.  It was fine, not great. No complaints there.  My real issue was with the main course.  My husband had a steak that he enjoyed. I ordered sea bass in a citrus sauce, which I expected to be pretty good.... Cuz it's kinda hard to screw up fish, right? No, not right.  The fish was overcooked and the citrus sauce barely had any flavor.  

So I get that this place is a steak house, but if it's going to charge $40 for a piece of fish, I would (at the very least) expect the piece of fish to be...somewhat tasty. The other two major steak houses both serve delicious fish dishes. Oh well, maybe the chef was having an off night.  Who knows.

We ordered the molton chocolate lava cake for dessert which was alright and then we bounced. (After paying the bill, which was substantial for a mediocre dinner).  Honestly, I don't think any part of my evening would make me feel compelled (or even desirous) to return."}
{"text":"I liked the restaurant nice ambiance 
Food is pricey but they offer some good deals in Sunday's so if $ is a factor Sunday is a good option 
The service was great when I was there and the steaks were really great too!"}
{"text":"Great steaks and lamb chops. Wine and side dishes were excellent also. Best part was our server Jordan!  Our group really had a nice time with her and it made the whole night great!!"}
{"text":"I had a great experience at Hyde Park while visiting Cleveland. The restaurant was pretty empty on a Thursday night which was fine as we had excellent service the entire night.  For apps we had a Ceaser salad and Tuna Tar Tar, both were great. The Tuna came with wontons for dipping, very fresh and delicious. For entrees I had the Steak Kosar-named after famed QB Bernie Kosar. It was a filet with lobster. The steak was cooked perfectly, the lobster was very tender and a large amount. It was good value to get both the steak and lobster versus just a steak etc. My girlfriend had the Steak Lebron, which was a huge 18oz steak covered with shrimp and Hollandaise. That was also very good but quite large. We could have done with about half the portion. But leftovers are great too. We were too full for desert, but we did have a nice bottle of wine. They had a good mix of cheaper and more expensive wines. Service was perfect and gave us some tips on the night life around town while we were visiting. It was a great start to our weekend."}
{"text":"This restaurant has been in Cleveland for as long as I can remember, yet, until this past week, I had never experienced it. My visit did not start off on the right foot - the hostess was MIA and the bartender was covering more tables and bartops than she should have been handling (there should have been at least 2 bartenders on staff during happy hour). It took longer than I cared to wait for the blackberry sapphire cocktail. Fortunately, my drink was very tasty and after we sat down to dinner, our waiter helped to redeem my unfortunate first impression.
My date and I started with the calamari, both enjoyed the petite filet for our entree, and shared asparagus and potatoes gruyere gratin as our sides. When it comes to the food, I was NOT disappointed. Between our appetizer and the bread before dinner, two sides was a bit much, but we liked the variety. My filet came with onion rings, which was a pleasant and yummy surprise. I couldn't get dessert because I was so stuffed from dinner!
Lastly, I wanted to call out the classic style of the place. Sitting at the bar, I felt at any minute, Don Draper would sit down and order a scotch and woo me with his charm (only in my dreams...)"}
{"text":"For starters they brought out samples of bread, soft pretzels and different kinds of multi-grain crackers.
I got the 7oz filet over bordelaise crowned with lobster and Béarnaise;asparagus and mushroom caps. It was amazing! The side we chose was the garlic whipped mashed potatoes which were to die for. The service was great couldn't ask for better! Will return!"}
{"text":"It wasn't terrible, It wasn't great. The group I was with had some steak mishaps with the wrong level of cookness. 

Raves were the lobster pasta and the salads (not the wedge salad, which I think are stupid anyway). The anchovies were dry. 

Crab cakes were good but I've had better. 

Service was on top of their game, gratuity was included for 8 people so they got double tipped, and didn't bring it to our attention. Our bad. 

I expected more from this place."}
{"text":"\"How do you like your Filet Mignon? Butterflied or original?\"
I, who previously considered my carnivorous way of being almost borderline criminal, sat there speechless and charmed.  \"Hyde Park\" is like this secret top-notch carnivorous club where you can truly indulge and dig your teeth into the bloody most delicate parts of the cow delightfully guilt-free.
The place has this \"white table cloth\" atmosphere, where I immediately felt like an adult or at least among adults, and completely regretted not getting a manicure the day before. Maître d  looked Cleopatra-like beautiful  under the light of a crystal chandelier, so only spotting few ladies in Halloween sweaters calmed me down and stopped me from panicking.  For once I felt appropriate wearing a dress.
Up-Side:  nice cozy atmosphere, convenient location, Special 1800 C furnaces for the steaks, really nice service (guides you through the Bible for the carnivores - THE MENU), few fish dishes, most importantly: BEST STEAKS in TOWN
Down-side:   EXPENSIVE. Surprisingly nothing comes as a side -dish with you $40 steak.  Baked potato is another $7, salads (yummy and generous) $7-10 dollars extra.  Cocktails are tasty, but could have been fancied up some more (my \"Sex on The Beach\" was missing peeled orange and pink straw - but hey, I hear I am a spoiled brat), and the choice of Gins and Vodkas is limited)
Summary: mixed feelings about the place.  Of course Americans overeat and waste food all because of the restaurants that overwhelm you with extras. However once you are used to it, restaurants that don't do that feel like a complete rip-off.  But if you want to treat yourself to the supreme aged steak - that's the place to go, also if you want to impress some meat and potato girl like me and have over $100 for dinner, go for it, she will special like I did.  Who knows, maybe she will even wear a dress for you, sailor."}
{"text":"Best steakhouse in Cleveland in my honest opinion. The prezel bread is like anything else in the world. The has stayed the same for decades and had never failed to impress. I have been to Hyde Parks for a multitude of occations. Everything from business gatherings to bachelor party dinners. Just simply a terrific place."}
{"text":"My husband and I celebrated my 40th birthday and 10 year anniversary here. The service is extremely friendly and attentive. Excellent Ribeye and they gave us free rich desserts to help celebrate. We will be back."}
{"text":"Had a good experience here. My colleague and I took customers out and wasn't disappointed. Started with the $4 martini happy hour drinks. Ordered a couple of bottles of wine and then got seated for dinner. The group settled for just salads and the \"Tower of Seafood\". Only negative thing is that they design the seafood tower for the number of patrons. We ordered the one for 8 and got charged for it, but only received enough for the four of us. It was still enough. Service was good and provided by Damien. Expect to find only the mucky mucks when you go here. My colleague hung out with the Rooneys the last time he was here. Many of the Steelers, Penguins and Pirates frequent this place. That should tell you it's not cheap."}
{"text":"We made a reservation to celebrate our first wedding anniversary during restaurant week. We arrived early during happy hour to check the out the bar specials. We totally recommend those. The drinks were reasonably priced ($5 to $7 for top shelf cocktails and appetizers). The pink grapefruit cocktail was delicious and my husband enjoyed the Hyde Park sidebar. The bar staff was also very attentive. 

We then made our way over to the table for dinner. The wait staff was nothing compared to the service we typically receive at the Capital Grille. My husband asked if he was able to substitute the French onion soup for the lobster bisque on the restaurant week menu (both are the same price). The waiter responded that he was \"supposed to choose something from the menu, but could add it on.\" We were charged the full price of $9 for the soup. Not impressed. 

My husband ordered the filet medium rare. It came out medium bordering on medium well. We sent it back. I ordered the filet medallions with the Cabernet sauce medium well. The steak itself was very tender, but the sauce was so peppery that it completely ruined the steak. I actually refused to eat my second medallion. I've never done that in my life. The waiters could care less that I sent back 3/4 of an entire meal untouched. 

The flourless chocolate torte was also nothing special. The best part of the meal was the King Estate Pinot Noir that my husband treated me to for our anniversary (I highly recommend it if you're looking for a good Pinot!). 

Nate, the assistant general manager, was the only person who genuinely seemed to care about our dining experience. Kudos to him for being everything a manager at a restaurant should be. He was working the dining room and checking in with all of the tables. 

Overall, we will take our business back to the Capital Grille. Way better than this joint. I actually feel like we've wasted our money. Two stars for the happy hour. We'd definitely do that again."}
{"text":"Food=3.5 
Service= 4 
So I guess I'm rounding up to a 4. 

Came for a birthday dinner on a Tuesday night. The interior is fancy. We had two servers waiting on our table. They were attentive and friendly. We started with oysters. They were just ok. Not bad, not the best, just ok. I also had the Greek salad. The salad was delicious. It was chopped up like a chopped salad which helped me avoid the awkward wide mouth salad eating situation. I ordered the petite filet medium. It was cooked perfectly and very flavorful. We shared the lobster Mac and cheese. It was horrible! I don't know how you can mess up anything with lobster in it. Oh wait yes I do. You skimp on the lobster! There was also an abundance of onions in the lobster Mac and cheese. I like onions but these were so large and over powering.

It was a good meal but Ruth Chris and Eddie Merlots are still my 1 & 2!"}
{"text":"if you like classic steak places, i suppose this place is perfect.  had a very good filet.  some very good potatoes au gratin.   some good onion things on the steak plate.  bread was bread (with hard butter, though.....what the h?)  wasn't thrilled with the beer choices,  but i made due.   

so if you are choosing between here and Mortons (next door), I would go here.  But if you are not some old suit, try Lola over on east 4th."}
{"text":"We decided to have a low key Anniversary celebration on a Monday night. The staff and our server were so friendly and made our visit very special - they even presented us with a special dessert at the end of our meal! We could not have asked for a better experience. We were seated in a sweet banquet booth in the bar area and treated like royalty. The calamari appetizer, freshly prepared Ceasar/Wedge salads and our entrees of Chicken Milanese and Parmesan were all top notch. We will definitely bring our family and friends back to this location for another fine dining experience."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time a couple months back to fulfill my meat cravings. My friend and I got the \"sea and shore\" prefixed meal which included three courses: salad, filet mignon entree, and dessert.  We also ordered a side of lobster Mac n cheese. With my filet mignon, I got the crab cakes with spicy mustard, and my friend got the scallops. For desert we got the cheesecake and creme brûlée. 

Overall the steak was very good, and tender. The scallops were also amazing. I disliked the crab cake unfortunately, and couldn't take more than 3 bites. The lobster Mac n cheese was good, but after a while it was just too rich for my stomach.  The desserts were good, but we were so stuffed by the end of the meal we couldn't finish it. 

I would highly recommend getting the 3 course fixed meal. It was pretty filling, so ordering other side dishes isn't necessary. It was a good meal, and I probably would come back again to eat here."}
{"text":"Nice place.  I'd like to give it 3.5 stars...

Steak and sides were very good (40 day dry aged ribeye and corn) - the food (other than the bread) was 5 stars - couldn't be better.  

The service, however, was mediocre.  The waiter was very friendly, yet completely unattentive."}
{"text":"there is something on the menu for everyone. i got the black and gold....30 something ounces of tomahawk rib chop what?.....my wife got the polamalu lobster...16 to 18 oz. .....if you know where it gets better than this please let me know"}
{"text":"The enormous ribeye for two is the BEST. STEAK. EVER.  The sides are pretty good, but not necessarily great.  The shellfish tower is impressive.  Plan on dropping at least $100 per person not including the tip.  If you are not going for a steak, then go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Came into Hyde Park a couple of weeks ago, while in town for the Steelers game. For the past few years, this has been my family's go to place for dinner thanks to the great food and relaxed atmosphere!

We started out with the seafood tower, which was delicious and more than enough for my mom and I to split. Everything was so fresh and worth every penny. Unfortunately, our main course came out right in the middle of us eating our appetizer. We sent the food back, since we didn't want to be rushed, thinking the kitchen wouldn't let the dishes they previously brought out sit and try to re-serve them. They did. 

The manager was accommodating and apologized for the mistake and assured us they were preparing new dishes and sides. My steaks and my dad's steak were wonderful, but my mom's steak had absolutely no seasoning and was not prepared well at all, which was a disappointment after waiting so long for the fresh dishes to be prepared. 

When the check came, we noticed our seafood tower was taken off our check for the inconvenience, which was more than we could have asked for. However, a manager by the name of Ken contacted me the next day to apologize again for the inconvenience and apologized for the fact that my mom's steak was still on the check. He had instructed the manager on duty the night we were in to take the seafood tower and my mom's steak off the check, all of which was way more than we expected or would ever ask for. In addition to his apology, he sent us a credit for the inconvenience for our next visit. 

Needless to say, the food (for the most part!) was delicious and the customer service was beyond excellent which is the reason for the 5 stars. Will definitely be making a trip back out to dine again here!"}
{"text":"Along with Gandy Dancer in Station Square, Hyde Park is one of my favorite food/drink happy hour spots in town.  Had a really fun time here--much thanks to server Sean, a great guy and great at what he does--last month during a 1-night \"staycation\" at nearby Parador Inn on the North Shore.

Solid happy hour food list and amazing happy hour cocktails.  These days I'm not big on drinking, but because my guy and I were staying in the area and walking/cabbing to our next destinations that Friday evening we enjoyed several of the featured happy hour cocktails.  At $5-7 each and featuring premium ingredients like Belvedere and Don Julio, they were a great deal.  I especially loved the PAMA Blush (Ketel One Orange + PAMA + blood orange).

I almost want to take off a star for inconsistency.  Honestly, there's room for improvement there.  Some of our drinks were on the strong side, others were normal, and none were weak on the booze.  Another inconsistency that stands out in my mind a month later was the cook and juiciness of the cheeseburger sliders; our order #1 was much better than order #2.  The brie and mushroom flatbread we had, though, was so delicious and absolutely some of the tastiest flatbread I've ever had--both orders of it.

Highly, highly recommended for those looking for a jovial, affordable happy hour in a classic setting.  We ate a dinner's worth of happy hour food and had a number of drinks, so the bill was in the neighborhood of $80 but well worth it.  Nothing like the feeling of money well spent.

Oh, and a big \"thank you\" to the table of nurses who shared some of their monster chunk of red velvet cake with us!"}
{"text":"I stopped by here this past evening for dinner with my wife and two other dining companions.  I have been wanting to come to Hyde Park for a long time but for some reason it never really comes up in discussion as a place to dine at.  Perhaps its because of its location on the North Shore or maybe its because it is not one of the better known steakhouses in the city.  In any case Pittsburgh restaurant week gave me the perfect reason to come here.  The inside of this place is what you would expect from a swanky steakhouse.  Immediately upon entering there is a bar to the left and then to the right is their main dining room.  What I thought was cool about the bar is that it had a fireplace with a few seats around it that a couple was enjoying the night that we were there.  The dining room itself was nice, open and was done tastefully.

Since it was restaurant week I pretty much knew that I was ordering off of that menu but still decided to take a look at the regular menu.  My wife and I were both amused by the naming of steaks and other menu items after local sports stars like Crosby and Tomlin.  In the end I ended up ordering the lobster bisque as my appetizer, a 7 oz petite filet that came with onion straws and garlic mashed potatoes for my entree while splitting a side of the roasted brussel sprouts and hazelnuts with my wife and finally the NY cheesecake for dessert.  Our appetizers ended up coming out with impressive speed and my lobster bisque was decently good.  It was creamy and had a good amount of lobster in it but I felt that it was a little bland and maybe something was missing.  So I ended up putting some pepper into it which really helped out in my opinion.  While we were still eating our appetizers the bread basket for the table came out alongside some butter which had pepper topping on a portion of one side and salt topping on a portion of the other.  The bread basket consisted of a number of pretzels sticks, some flat bread and some traditional bread.  My favorite of the bunch ended up being the pretzel stick even though I had to rub some of the salt off of it.  Our entrees came out to us next and I have to admit that I was pretty impressed with my steak.  It was cooked perfectly to a medium rare and was seasoned nicely.  I also enjoyed the onion straws quite a bit but was let down by the potatoes which were a bit bland.  Our side of brussel sprouts ended up being really good and I enjoyed the pairing of hazelnuts with them which I have never had before.  Finally after we were all done our desserts came out.  My cheesecake was rich and creamy but seemed to have a bit of an identity crisis having some cherries on it but also a raspberry sauce.  It seemed a bit weird especially whenever they clearly had raspberries since that was what topped the chocolate desserts at our table.  So maybe it was a mistake?

The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  While I thought that a few of the items could use some more seasoning, I did really enjoy my steak which at a steakhouse should be the star of my meal and was the star of my meal."}
{"text":"Excellent all the way around great staff great atmosphere incredible food nice place for a special occasion on the north shore so it very romantic in the day time and at night"}
{"text":"The food here was amazing along with the service. Our server Ryan was so helpful and made our experience fun and enjoyable! Thank you  Ryan and the rest of the staff  for making our Valentines Day experience so great!"}
{"text":"Favorite steakhouse- better than capital grille or Ruth Chris. I usually get filet but my friends have gotten various cuts and we have never had a problem with the cut or temperature. Family style sides are also very good. I love the atmosphere here. Dark reds, blacks. Very sexy. The bar is also great. Make very good drinks. Highly recommend for a date night."}
{"text":"Good service but the food is outrageously overpriced for what you get. If the steak would have been life changing, I wouldn't have minded paying that much, but I could cook a steak as good as what I ordered."}
{"text":"We have been 3x before Pirates games this season. The bar area is busy but most bartenders are welcoming. Drinks were expertly made, balanced and delicious. I recommend the Pink Grapefruit and the White Pear from the happy hour menu. We had one instance when our drinks were poorly made but the manager and waiter brought us new drinks and all was well.

For food we order small plates from the happy hour menu. I've tried the bruchetta flatbread (so good! I've ordered more than once), the fried calamari (in a sweet sauce that I didn't like. They put the sauce all over the calamari and makes the fried dish soggy), and oysters (dried out and lacking liquor). My husband has ordered the sliders every time and loves them.

We will continue to return to Hyde Park for happy hour before home baseball games."}
{"text":"This is the best steak house around.  
In all of the years I have been coming here I can't recall a bad meal. 
Tonight was exceptional.  
I started with the shrimp cocktail. They were nice and big.  Cocktail sauce was great. 
They brought out really hot pretzel rolls and nice soft butter a restaurant will automatically lose a star for bringing hard cold butter to the table. 
I had the Steak Brown 12 oz. I asked for medium rare and it was perfect.  
My gf had the med well petite filet, which was perfectly cooked as well. 
We ended with the ganache cake which was out of this world. This is why when I come to to Cleveland they make the short list of restaurants of \"must visits\""}
{"text":"Dry aged steaks (not sure if all are or just some). Was very happy with the preparation. Full bottle wine prices high compared to my experience at Morton's and elsewhere. Waiter was slightly wacky; over cautious about removing empty bottles and plates, brought bread at the same time as entree. Minor things. Waiter was busy, so hostess took our drink order. Nice touch, very pleased with that. Overall, great experience, would definitely return when in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Hyde Park came highly recommended and I enjoyed my steak there. I had the 7oz. Clemente, which had bleu cheese on top and was wrapped in bacon. I then proceeded to have a heart attack...

[Okay, joke in poor taste.]

Upon heart attack recovery, I realized I quite enjoyed the steak. Cooked medium rare is my preferred temp, and the steak was quality, IMO. I'm not a steakhouse vet, however.

We ordered Hyde Park's Signature Mac and Cheese as a side, but I didn't enjoy it quite as much as the signature mac at Aqueous, an upscale steakhouse at Nemacolin Woodlands Resort where we ate the night before. 

The lobster bisque at this restaurant is great, however. 

I'd likely return here for a special night on the town in Pittsburgh, but I might also choose one of the competitors like Ruth Chris or Morton's, too."}
{"text":"4.9 stars. I have to say I very high expectations for the food here bc of how much everyone talks it up. The steak lived up to everything I had in mind plus some. I have been to some great steakhouses and this was the best steak I have ever had. I will dream about the steak here for a very long time and based on the steak alone I would give this place 5 stars no question. 

We got quite a few sides and decided to share them in our party of 6. So for the appitizers, we had calamari which was really great and we all tried escargot for the first time. It was much better than I expected, very garlicky which was great. The chopped salad was probably the best I have ever had too. The hearts of palm on it really put it over the top. 

Now for the only part as to why it didn't get a complete 5 stars. The sides we got were asparagus, mushrooms, brussel sprouts, and lobster mashed potatoes. They were all mediocre. Nothing blew me away and for how much you pay to go here, it better. Nothing was bad by any means but the sides were nothing to write home about. 

The wine was great, we got a couple bottles. This is an extraordinary steakhouse but make sure you are ready to spend at least a couple hundred for 2 people. Perfect place for a special occasion and if I have another big event in my life, you can bet I will be back."}
{"text":"Dining at Hyde Park, overall, was a great experience! We came on Sunday when they have less expensive meal options. We had bacon wrapped scallops for and app which I would highly recommend.  For my dinner portion, I had the salmon which was delicious and a huge portion.  All the men in our party order steaks and they all raved over them.  Dessert we order keylime pie and carrot cake.  The keylime pie was delicious and meant for 1 person.  The carrot cake on the other hand was huge more like a half of carrot cake. The menu said good for 2-4 people but we shared it was 5 and still had left overs!"}
{"text":"I love Hyde Park and I love Pittsburgh Restaurant Week. After dining at HP twice during restaurant week and many other times, one thing is evident: the Hyde Park servers HATE restaurant week. For reference, I dined at Eddie V's on Tuesday night for restaurant week and the service there was impeccable, as usual. I dined at HP last winter during restaurant week and last night (Thursday). The service is drastically different. When greeted at HP, our server made no mention of the restaurant week menu/special. Throughout the meal, she only offered to refill our alcoholic drinks. We had to ask for more water multiple times and more bread. Our servers were nowhere to be found after they delivered our salads. The dessert course took forever to come out, which makes no sense since the dessert is one set item of flourless chocolate torte. When she finally brought the check she never asked if we wanted one check or split, then acted like it was a hassle for her to split it. As soon as we signed our checks she immediately collected them (a huge NO NO) and never thanked us, a goodbye, nothing. The attitude of HP servers is just so evident unless you're dining off the regular menu. Being a regular diner and a participant of restaurant week, I tip according to what a non promotional meal at a steakhouse should cost, but not when the service isn't warranted like it has been at HP. It's really unfortunate that the servers choose to drop the ball just because people are coming in for the promotional meal."}
{"text":"Came here with friends for a big dinner. The service was nice and helpful. For appetizers we ordered a seafood jumbo and it was pretty enough for ten people. It had shrimps, oysters, crab legs and lobster tails and tastes good. For sides we shared spinach and mushroom, asparagus, brussel sprouts, corns, regular mash potato, and lobster with mash potato. Loved the brussel sprouts but most of my friends didn't. I ordered a medium-cooked ribeye (18oz perhaps?) but found it might be a little bit over cooked. Though I did not ask to change because it was dark in the restaurant and I could hardly tell the difference by tasting. I also tried some lobster bisque and it was good. Had a chocolate lava cake as dessert and it was sweet. We brought our own wine and it was charged $25. For ten people it cost us more than $100/each with tips and tax. I did have a great time but not for the steak honestly."}
{"text":"Hip and classy. I ate the biggest filet while sitting on a couch.  I ordered the hines ward and it was phenomenal.  Along with brussel sprouts and asparagus everthing was cooked to perfection.  Its a little pricey but the service was top notch.   Very rarely do i order dessert but i made an exception when i seen a piece of carrot cake come out the back.  So i ordered the colossal red velvet cake and i must say colossal describes it perfectly. It was literally like they gave me a whole top of a wedding cake.  Its was so good im mean so so good.  I was with 3 people and all of us couldnt finish one piece.   I would definitely stop back there anytime i want a steak as big as my face lol. And especially if i was trying to impress a lady friend."}
{"text":"We had a very good dinner here recently. The atmosphere, service, and the majority of the food were excellent, but there were a couple of things keeping me from rating it five stars. 
We had our doubts about the restaurant when we drove up - it is directly connected to a lower-end hotel, and is hidden between a gas station and a handful of other hotels. Parking was free and convenient. As soon as you walk in the front doors, though, the atmosphere of the restaurant is similar to most good, classic steak houses. 
We were here for a relatively early dinner (during happy hour) - so the bar was packed, and we sat in the relatively empty dining room.
The service was great. The dining room got crowded quickly, but the server stayed on top of everything. They started out the meal by bringing a bread basket, which had a few different types of bread. The pretzel roll was amazing - probably one of the best complimentary breads that I have had at a restaurant.
We ordered a couple of steaks - the porterhouse and the filet. Both were cooked at perfect temperatures. They were both very good...not anything to rave about, but very good.
The only bad part of the meal was the side of lobster macaroni and cheese. The lobster itself of course was good. But the dish tasted (and looked) like it was dressed with only caramelized onions, not cheese. We ate most of it, but it wasn't very good.
Probably the highlight of the meal was the apple pie. They cook the small apple pies (we shared between the two of us) to order, so it took about 15 minutes to come out. But it was absolutely worth it. 
Overall, I highly recommend the restaurant. I'm sure I will be back for a special occasion soon."}
{"text":"Stopped here before a Pirates game with a 5:00 start.  We were under-dressed, but drawn in by the cool dark oasis in a sea of pregame sellout madness.  What a smart move.  We were welcomed warmly and seated at a window table.  We ordered from an early diners menu that was a GREAT value for such an upscale steakhouse.  I had the lobster bisque and crab salad.  My wife had the wedge salad and chicken milanese.  Very good food for just under $20.00 per person.  Nice service from waitstaff that seemed happy to have Bucco fans find their way in.  

We plan on going back with more time and savoring the experience.  Our waiter advised us to try the red velvet cake and bring other diners to help eat it all.  Can't wait."}
{"text":"This was one of the best meals I have ever eaten.  My wife and I both decided to take advantage of the Lenten Special (Friday nights only) of twin lobster tails for $29.95.  We split one of their one-pound baked potatoes and delicious hazel nut brussel sprouts.  Of course they have amazing home-baked bread, and we tried a white pear cocktail, which tasted great but was strong.  Service and ambiance were first class, as always.  We can't eat there often, because it is expensive ($103 plus tip) but it is well worth it every once ion a while."}
{"text":"Always an excellent meal here. My favorite is the bone in fillet. They have a really nice bar menu also. The burgers are very good! I tried the chicken sandwich with hot sauce and blue cheese slaw last week and it was excellent. Service is always very good also"}
{"text":"Steaks have always just been average.  It's a nice atmosphere.   Don't do a private dinner here with a speaker unless you get the room with doors.  The makeshift drape walls don't block out sound at all and they have no speaker system."}
{"text":"Here's the thing. In every city, there is a brass rail joint for old classicists like me. So whenever I get sick and bored of looking at women in T-Shirts and men with earrings I suit up and go upscale. But I rather defied my own code and went casual. I was just kind of pissed off about something and I needed a $75 meal to cheer me up. Like now. Hyde Park delivered.

I can't tell you much about wine, but I can tell you that HP has a broad selection. I can tell you a whole lot about steak, but Hyde Park's filet was, to the point, simply marvelous. I had what I think was called the Celebrity style filet which included Bearnaise and lobster with asparagus and fat button mushrooms. Wow. Brought it right to mind, and this was two weeks ago. The creamed spinach on the other hand,  was too leafy and watered down. Not my style. 

Service was impeccable although the joint was semi-deserted and it took a while for the MaitreD to notice I was at the door.  All in all, a first rate joint, elegant, quiet, classy and businesslike."}
{"text":"In my opinion Hyde Park is one of the top steakhouses in Pittsburgh. From the sides to the main course, it's hard to find something you will not like. Lately, I've found that some \"so called\" steakhouses / restaurants in Pittsburgh have a difficult time cooking to a perfect medium rare, this is certainly not the case at Hyde Park. If you are feeling adventurous, I would recommend you to get one of the two dry aged steaks. Easily one of the best steaks you will have the opportunity to eat."}
{"text":"Best burger I've ever had! First time here since I started working downtown. Kept hearing about these fantastic burgers but didn't go... until today. Went during lunch time. We were seated right away. When you walk in you begin to think you've underdressed. Nah, it's business casual. The place was fantastically clean, staff was great and friendly. Always checked on us. When i sat down at the table and saw two forks I immediately though \"Pretty Woman\"... ha! Thankfully I didn't need a fork. So I got a basic Cheeseburger. The bun was amazing! I love seeds on buns. The burger... oh my lawd... it was actual ground meat made. Not one of those frozen fake beef patties. I actually saw how imperfectly perfect it was. I got onion and tomato on it. It comes with fries and a pickle. The fries are fresh cut fries. Get them crispy. They are so much better crispy. The burger was moist and full of flavor. Every bite was an explosion in my mouth. I was very pleased and ended up only eating half of the burger because it was so big. Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Highly recommend bar seating.  Staff is fantastic and they offer an awesome bourbon selection.  Appears to be very romantic if looking to impress a date.  Dinner was amazing!!! Thank you for the amazing service."}
{"text":"We went to Hyde Park last night for dinner. Every bite was excellent, as was the service. The atmosphere is pretty standard steakhouse - dark, fancy, cozy.

The 40 day dry aged steak melts in your mouth and the cabernet butter was perfection. My entree was the Polamalu lobster tail and I demolished it! Lobster mac and cheese, lobster mashed potatoes, goat cheese salad with candied walnuts, delicious breads with 2 types of butter, crab cake, it was all delicious! 

Unfortunately we didn't save any room for dessert."}
{"text":"We visited the Crocker Park location twice: summertime in the bar for apps and drinks, last winter in the dining room for a special dinner. Great service, ambience, and food both times. Hope to return to Ohio for another visit soon."}
{"text":"Food was okay. Very simple steakhouse. Has remnants of a Chicago steakhouse!"}
{"text":"I give Hyde Park Prime Steakhouse all-around high marks.  From the moment you walk in you are greeted by a friendly hostess, great ambiance, exceptional waitstaff, and an incredible meal.  For an out-of-towner from Chicago, I seriously give this establishment seriously high honors.  I and all my co-workers were impressed with the total package.  I ordered the 18oz New York strip steak with Bordelaise sauce , done exactly per my request.  We all shared our sides, Potatoes Gruyere Gratin, asparagus, garlic mashed potatoes, and sautéed mushrooms.  Each side was just as good as the other.  It is pricey but well worth $$$$."}
{"text":"This is my favorite local steakhouse.  Every visit my steak is perfection!  The meat has so much flavor, is so tender and I always have enough to take home!  My favorite dessert is the creme brûlée, which is perfect for sharing!  I highly recommend a night at Hyde Park!"}
{"text":"Short review here - I know, I know... that's a bit unusual for me.

I've had one dinner here, which was excellent. The steak was well cooked and sides were tasty and also well prepared. The wait staff was friendly and helpful, and overall, this place was every bit as nice as other big names in the steakhouse business (Ruth's Chris, Capital Grille, Morton's) in my opinion.

I've also stopped here before a Steelers game for a bit of \"tailgating\" with some friends - we had a great time at the bar. The bartenders are courteous, efficient, and make some nice drinks.

I've read through some of the less flattering reviews, and can only think that these reviewers unfortunately came on an 'off' night for this place. So far, I am pleased, and will definitely return when I am craving a steakhouse experience!"}
{"text":"What a awesome night. We were in town for business and it was highly recommended by our hotel. the maiter d, Matt was extremely helpful finding a great table and with our seamless service all night. kudos to Tim ,Rebecca and Aaron. especially to Aaron for recommending that awesome frogs leap Cabernet."}
{"text":"Way! Too much money for this joint. On a positive note the wagu filet was superior and they serve their steaks with thin fried onion rings that replaces bread just perfectly. That steak was worth the trip.  BUT, Soggy bread, potato gratin had too much of a bite, the corn pudding was shoe peg  and they had quit cleaning the bathroom at 8 pm so you suffer the atrocities from the drunk patrons attending a group outing. 
I'm sorry but when dinner for two is over $350.00 ($100 for two steaks) then you pay for a clean bathroom, fresh bread, perfect potatoes and basically you better get it right."}
{"text":"Great steak house in Pittsburgh.   Had the bone in filet which was amazing along with the best calamari I've ever had.  Toss up between here and Captial Grille as my fav steak houses in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"we where there in a tense night before my son had cardiac surgery at Cleveland clinic.. this place calmed us all down  gave us free  titos martinis in copper  mugs     gave us a tour of the entire architecture of the building and  the food was  fantastic !!!  even tho Im a wolverine and they had a urban myer steak from THE ohio state university, this place is the place for you !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I love Hyde Park. Everytime I come to this location it's awesome. The hostess I usually encounter is awesome at making you feel welcome and special. A few other times I have had other host(ess) they didn't make me feel welcomed or special which is awful when the restaurant IS NOT busy! However nothing is perfect. The food is consistently mouth watering. I tried the Waygu filet and it was one of the best things I have ever ate. I have tried a few cuts of steak (all amazing) and carpaccio which was also amazing. I have tried most of the deserts and they always come out fairly quick. Once they accidentally threw away something and they replaced the item despite my objections. I appreciate that kind of service. People make mistakes but few actually fix them. I like to sit on or near the patio. The atmosphere inside has dark woods, dim lights and a cozy feel. Worth the price for sure!"}
{"text":"My friend had a $75 gift certificate for Hyde Park that she was given by them a year ago when she got food poisoning from there. So......already, can't give 4 stars. We went for happy hour. Good food specials and cocktail specials, but no wine specials which is what we both wanted. Tried the blood orange Cosmo, it was okay. Split ceasar salad, calamari, and bruschetta flat bread. After getting some wine, bill came to $130. More than you'd expect for happy hour and that little food. Enjoyed ambiance, but no outdoor seating which would be great in the summer. Probably will seek a different venue for next happy hour."}
{"text":"Great finger food steaks excellent service excellent Crown royal on the table when ordered! :-) server was fantastic and they had sectional manager to make sure the operation was running top shelf no problem with my bluejeans when  wife was dressed up:-) Best part about it is my significant other had a smile!"}
{"text":"First time here. We ordered the tuna for apps and boy, was that phenomenal. We also both got the garlic mashpotatoes and ribeye on the bone steak and it was the best steak we've ever had. Worth every bite! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Came here for the big v-day dinner. I was coming from out of town and found the restaurant through yelp. 

We started with the oysters, refreshing and light.
I had the 12 oz filet and my girlfriend had the steak Rooney.
We split the sautéed spinach.

Pros
-Great atmosphere
-Great service, the manager gave everyone a 25 dollar gift card to use upon returning.
-Great menu
-Steaks on par w/ other area steakhouses (Morton's, capital grille, etc).

Cons
-We both thought the fried onion straws that came with my steak a little on the salty side and the sautéed spinach was wayyyyyy salty. 

All in all, good place to curb a steak craving."}
{"text":"Fancy fancy!  La-la la-la!  Come here if you are looking for a special night out!  I was here for a rehearsal dinner and it was amazing.  

Our party was held in a private back room.  At first, I thought that the hostess was leading us into the kitchen but after a few twists and turns we entered this lavish red room.  It was perfect for the group of ~60 people.

The bread basket was a winner - there was a soft pretzel in there!  I LOVE pretzels!  Luckily my husband pulled it out of there before anyone else did.

The salad was bizarre.  I decided that I could recreate the recipe:
Step 1:  Obtain a head of lettuce
Step 2:  Quarter it.
Step 3:  Place a quarter on a plate.
Step 4:  Drizzle creamy dressing on top.
Step 5:  Sprinkle with bacon and pecans.
Step 6:  Serve.

Really, do I need to eat all of that lettuce?  Maybe a normal salad does have that amount of lettuce in it and we just don't realize it, but when it is sitting in this quarter-sphere on your plate, you realize that you just need to eat the top layer and that is it!

Dinner was great:  I had the shrimp and asparagus and it was delicious.  The guy next to me had the steak and he was loving it along with the mashed potatoes and crispy fried onions on the side.

Finally, dessert was perfect:  a nicely-sized slice of chocolate cake and three drops of raspberry sauce on the side.  Mmmmmm."}
{"text":"I have taken clients to Hyde Park three times and have eaten there with my wife once.  I have never had a bad experience.  Like all restaurants there is the occasional wait or the occasional menu item that isn't as good as you had hoped it would be, but generally speaking this place is quite good.  Full disclosure:  I am a HUGE fan of Capital Grille.  If I give the CG 5 stars, I give Hyde Park 4.5.

Great steaks, lots of menu options and a good wine list.  What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"The restaurant is attractive and comfortable, although there are a number of tables for two where the diners are in very close proximity to each other along a banquette.  I would not have enjoyed sitting at one of those tables. Fortunately, my wife and I were seated at a table for four.  If you can avoid using valet parking, do it and save $5 plus tip.  I parked on the street around the corner from the restaurant at a metered spot where there is no enforcement on Sundays.  The early nights menu, which is offered all day on Sunday and until 6:00 p. m. other days, offers good value.  It contains a selection of entrees for $19.95 and a selection of those that are $25.95, which I was pleased that the restaurant offered on the final day of Valentines' Day weekend.  All include choice of soup or salad plus side dishes.  The excellent breadbasket included warm pretzel rolls and a large part of butter, part of it seasoned with pepper: interesting and tasty.  There were also good sourdough rolls and a crisp seeded flatbread. My wedge salad was very good as was my wife's caesar salad with fresh anchovies and the salads were a good size.  The entrees were not served hot.  I had dry aged sirloin chopped steak with mushroom sauce, one of the $19.95 items, my wife ordered the two 6 ounce filet entree with bearnaise sauce from the $25.95 menu. My dish was good, hers was not; her filets were inexcusably tough. We sat in front of the fireplace while waiting to be seated as my wife enjoyed am $11 Bombay gin martini: pricey, but potent and well-made. I had a Samuel Adams lager draft beer and was pleased that unlike other steakhouses, there was at least a tiny selection of draft brews here:  Samuel Adams and Guinness. Service from a team of staff members was attentive and gracious.  I appreciated that unlike most other premiere steakhouses in the area, the noise level was moderate, and that unlike at Eddie Merlot's, we were not hounded by a pretentious server who inflicted a minutes-long recitation of every possible dish without regard to whether we wanted to hear it.  When asked if we wanted any additional side dishes, we said no, and unlike at Eddie Merlot's, we were not pushed to order any. The service here was unpretentious.  The cuisine here is not my favorite of the area steakhouses, and the memory of the tough filets will remain with us.  When I made the reservation, I was asked if my wife and I were going to be celebrating Valentines' Day, which we were.  I thought this meant that something special would be offered us, such as the provision of a complimentary dessert, but that was not the case.  I am surprised that the restaurant does not participate in OpenTable, the company which makes reserving a table easy and offers premiums to the diner."}
{"text":"Crab cakes were absolutely awsome.
The aged 22oz ribeye steak was spectacular  and cooked to perfection. And we shared a plentiful sized portion of lobster mac and cheese that made me wish I had a bigger tummy. The service was excellent and they were very meticulous setting the table they examined the glasses and silverware for spots and placement like perfectionist. I'm am very pleased with the way they go overboard to deliver exceptional evenings. If I'm ever back around Cleveland I will definitely revisit this place."}
{"text":"Fantastic happy hour period.  Stopped in for a quick couple drinks and small plates, was not let down whatsoever.  The $4 martini's / drinks were delicious as was the Scallops and Slider small plates a friend and I enjoyed.  The place was busy for happy hour as it should be.  Really thinking I need to start hitting this place more often.  Big bar, lots of seating, perfect.  My only complaint is the no left turn on Chagrin from the lot and the forced valet parking.  I just parked on the hotel side and walked thru.  Worked out great."}
{"text":"Here's your Hyde Park Happy Hour Rating and Review.....4 stars!  I'd give it 5 stars based purely on the food options but had to knock it down a little because I feel very humble sitting at the bar.  I know that sounds weird but I'm eating $5 appetizers and $4 Martini's at a fancy pants restaurant where couples are rolling in about to spend $100 plus on dinner and wine.  What's even worse, I once went in there before a baseball game with all my gear on.  I'm telling you this because the bar is in plain view of the dining room.

All that aside, you HAVE to go there for Happy Hour if you are in the area.  The apps are on a rotating basis so its quite possible that you could get something different week to week.  Go early because the bar is kind of small considering this really is a nice restaurant and they do prefer you to sit down and empty your wallet instead of pinching pennies while eating like a King.  Woo Hoo for Happy Hours!!"}
{"text":"Update: With a generous gift card from some kind of regional manager (in response to our comment card from the previous visit), we returned, for what will be my last time.

First, they brought me my steak with the wrong sauce--their pepper sauce instead of the shallot butter I ordered. I sent it back, and they brought me the right sauce--with the wrong steak. Funny enough, it was the same Heinz Ward steak I'd been unhappy with in my previous review.

This time, in fairness, my steak was at least cooked a perfect medium-rare. I'm still unimpressed with the flavor of the meat itself, though. It just tastes a little watery compared to the stuff at other restaurants I've been to.

I had three bites and stopped eating, and I am pleased to say that they didn't charge me for the steak. But again: At a place this pricey, I just expect my experience to be at least an B+, and I haven't had anything over a C-."}
{"text":"My favorite steakhouse. Much better than Ruth's Chris, Morton's and Capital Grill. I usually start off with the beefsteak salad (fresh cut onions, tomatoes, mozzarella and blue cheese crumbles topped off with balsamic vinaigrette dressing. I'm a NY Strip kind of guy and that's what I typically get with a side of mashed potatoes or French fries. The steak is mouthwatering and the service is always first class. Definitely good for groups or to go on a date. You won't be disappointed in Hyde Park!!"}
{"text":"Sublime! Food is great and people here are nice and welcoming! Will come back in the future! You have to Try porterhouse and lobster tail with mashed potatoes."}
{"text":"I've never been to a fancy chop house, so my lovely boyfriend treated me here for Valentine's Day. Everything was FANTASTIC. The service, the food, everything. Go here, now. 

I was pleasantly surprised that they had Sutterhome and Barefoot wines on the menu. Fancy wines don't do much for me- so I had no problem ordering a $6 glass of white zin.

The bread they brought out for an appetizer was thebomb.com. They had pretzel sticks in the bread basket. It was like Auntie Anne had made them herself. 

We both got steaks with a side of lobster Mac and cheese and asparagus. Everything was amazing. 

For dessert we got apple pie and a molten lava cake. The apple pie was made fresh in the back. It took about 20 minutes for the pie, which I assume is because they went to a local orchard to pick the apples before peeling them and putting them into the pie.

TIP: the apple pie and lava cake were both big enough for two people to share. 

Overall, if you want to splurge, go here. It was fantastic."}
{"text":"My fiancé took me here for dinner and OMG amazing. I would say this is the best place to eat in Pittsburgh for steak and baked potato. It's pricey but you pay for what you get. There are some insane people on Yelp to give anything less than a 5 star review for this restaurant."}
{"text":"Summary: mediocre food hiding beneath tasty sauces.  

We were rather disappointed.  The service was great, but the food was just okay.  For the price we expect a lot more.

I started with a glass of wine...with a bug in it.  It happens...not a big deal.  The server replaced it and removed it from my bill.

Next we had the blackened scallops app.  The plate came out with two tiny scallops, each about the diameter of a quarter.  I would argue that they were more burned than blackened, and they were way over cooked.  We complained and the manager brought us a new plate.  These scallops were larger and cooked properly; the vidalia onion sauce was excellent.

The caesar salad was nothing special.

I had the salmon.  It was tasty but slightly overcooked and on the dry side.  The chili soy glaze saved it.  My husband had the Rooney filet.  He enjoyed it although it wasn't as tender as a $48 steak should be.  The lobster on top was overcooked.  Again the sauces saved the dish.

For sides, we ordered the garlic whipped potatoes and roasted brussels sprouts with hazelnuts.  The potatoes were good.  The brussels were roasted whole and were rather unwieldy to eat and lacked flavor.  The dish would have been better if the sprouts had been halved or quartered and then roasted.

We ordered the molten lava cake for dessert.  We joked before it arrived that the cake would probably be overcooked and have no molten lava.  We were only half right -- the was no lava because the center was still cool and the \"lava\" was a solid ball of chocolate.  Otherwise, the cake was tasty, was accompanied by a nice raspberry sauce, and was a much more generous portion than we had expected."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I visited Hyde Park for my birthday a couple weeks ago. This was our first visit to Hyde Park and it came highly recommended from friends. We were seated promptly, as the restaurant was not overly crowded. It was a quiet atmosphere on a Wednesday night. Upon arriving at our table, we noticed a small birthday card sitting there, signed by the Hyde Park staff. We were recommended two glasses of wine from our very friendly waiter Albert H. He brought out samples of an appetizer for us to try prior to ordering, and also gave us recommendations on his favorite entrees. We both ordered the Filet Mignon (medium well), with sides of Cream Corn Pancetta and Potatoes Gruyere Gratin. Our food was served quickly, and was served exactly as it was ordered. The steak was delicious, perhaps one of the best I have ever had and both of the sides were delectable. Our waiter stopped by the table once or twice during the meal, just to ensure everything was as ordered and to refill our drinks. After finishing, our waiter took our plates, and brought out a complimentary Chocolate Raspberry Cake with a birthday candle on the plate. It was a nice gesture by the restaurant staff. Prices are a tad steep for a weekly night out, but for a high end restaurant with a welcoming ambiance, friendly staff and incredible food, it was well worth every penny spent for our special occasion. Would highly recommend, and we will definitely dine here again."}
{"text":"From NY, in Cleveland for a funeral. My 1 year wedding anniversary family took us to this restaurant for dinner. OMGosh!! The ribeye steak was delicious, my husband had the Lebron steak and shrimp dish no complaints at all there. one of my family members had the lamb chops. Everyone raved about their dish. The portions were great also. Our waiters Aaron, Chris, and Dennis were outstanding very attentive. I will definitely recommend this place, and I will return when in Cleveland again"}
{"text":"Excellent spot for a great meal.  I enjoyed the bisque, quality oysters and a filet made from cows in heaven.  The staff was amazing and the recommendations by Jason the bartender were on point.  If you're near the area and wanting to dine out, I'd highly recommend Hyde Patk"}
{"text":"We used to like Hyde Park but now we really like it. Great bar menu, draft beer, good service and a great decor update. Skip Red and go here.
June 2018 - without a doubt, the best burger in Cleveland. I go for the HP burger and fab onion straws.
The bun is the best I have had on a burger.
If you have room skip the bread basket, but the seseme
crackers are addictive."}
{"text":"Very nice digs. The decor is very nice with dark wood, burgundy drapes, white table cloths. Wait staff was very good and efficient. Waitress had good recommendations and knowledgeable about the menu and wines. 

Went for a family birthday celebration, our waitress over heard and made sure the birthday person received a desert with candle. Nice touch! 

Food was very good. For starters, the Carpaccio was Oh So GOOD! Others enjoyed the Lobster Bisque and Calamari. Some had salads and were very satisfied; I saved room for desert and skipped this option. Had the Lamb Chops, double cut, that were perfectly cooked, so tasty, and came with some really good thin onion strings and Bordelaise sauce. We shared some asparagus with Bearnaise. The asparagus was cooked perfectly; good with or without the Bearnaise.

One issue, the main course came out to fast...were not really done with salads and walla time for the main course. We were not in a hurry and the timing was just a little to fast. 

Have a nice desert menu and the Key Lime pie and chocolate muse were very good!"}
{"text":"Great food, but snooty and nose-up servers.  $20 glasses of wine while staff talked about where they were meeting after close and who was headed on vacation.  $165 check average while staff bantered about how soon they should close.  Really?"}
{"text":"Great steak place in CLE. Really attentive service and quality options"}
{"text":"The steak is out of this world.  It's amazingly good and always well prepared.  You can tailor it how you like, and the options are endless.  But, the reason for this review is two fold.  First, the creamed corn.  If you do nothing else, ever, get the creamed corn.  How can corn mixed with baacon ever be a bad thing?  It can't.  It's so good, my wife and I order the sides separately because we each want one.  Additionally, we've discussed stopping by, heading to the bar for a drink and an order of creamed corn.  It's that good.  It used to be seasonal and now it's on the menu all the time.  In my house, that's a great call since we found or way there more often during creamed corn season than when it wasn't in season.  

But second, my wife and I celebrated our annivesary there and they went out of their way to make us feel special.  For starters, when I made the reservation they asked if we were celebrating anything and I told them it was our sixth wedding anniversary.  We showed up about 45 minutes early and the place was jam packed.  The first words out of the maitre d's mouth were not \"we'll call you when your table's ready\", the first words out of his mouth were, \"Oh, Mr. & Mrs. Scotti, Happy Anniversary\" then seated us anyway, much to our surprise.  Then we got to a huge table with rose and candles spread all over our table.  Before I knew what was going on, our hostess had my iPhone and taking our picture in the booth.  Plus, they threw in dessert which was not at all expected.  

We really were just lookiing forward to eating creamed corn before a Steeler game for our anniversary and were compeletely blown away.  The food is tremendous, the services is way over and above what anyone can reasonably expect, and to say that we'll be back is an understatement."}
{"text":"Ate dinner here and it was amazing. We had Tim as our server and he was great!! Really loved him and he knew his stuff! Definitely will be coming back next time we are in Pittsburgh. GREAT JOB TIM!!"}
{"text":"There was something just a bit off for an upscale steakhouse. Got the feel they may cater to regulars, and outsiders get sized up before the assign wait staff.  Food was well seasoned, service was okay-server was nice, but I definitely didn't feel pampered. I don't think bread is offered unless you ask for it, which we finally did well after appetizer was eaten- really? When you are paying over $60 per meal I'd think a little bread would be in order. Out of the dessert we wanted.  I probably wouldn't be prompted to return anytime soon."}
{"text":"The best place for cocktails in or near Downtown; they do a happy hour from 4-6:30, and then another happy hour from 9 until close.  Drinks were perfectly mixed, delicious, and half off.  

Great for having a few drinks before a 7 pm baseball game, and every bit of food we've ordered from the bar has been delicious.  Would rate this five stars, but haven't actually ever sat in the dining room."}
{"text":"The wife and I stopped in to Hyde Park for Happy Hour and we were the only ones in the joint.  Sweet!  We had the entire restaurant to ourselves, but we sat at the bar and chatted with the bartender, who was friendly.  We started off with some cocktails followed by dinner.  The cocktails were delicious.  I had two martinis and my wife had two mixed drinks.

We ordered a veggie flatbread, some shrimp, and sliders.  The food was excellent!  The flatbread had thin crust and the tomatoes, cheese, and other toppings were fresh and absolutely delicious!  The sliders were perfectly cooked and just awesome. The shrimp was just okay.  It was served on a tortilla chip and didn't have much flavor, which I found odd.  

The atmosphere was very nice and I would like to return for a non-happy-hour dinner some day.  The food and service were excellent!  What a great happy hour!"}
{"text":"I'll keep this short and to the point... I ordered the 36 day dry aged bone-in ribeye medium rare and the potato gratin.  The steak was cooked to medium / medium well, the accompanying onion strings were overly salty, and the gratin seemed to be missing any seasoning at all.  What they did to that steak was borderline criminal. At that internal temperature it was tough and completely indiscernible as a dry aged piece of beef... the sole reason to order it is to experience a tender, juicy, concentrated beef flavor with a hint of funk. Partly my fault for not giving them a chance at redemption? Perhaps, but I wasn't about to send it back since the wait it took coming to the table the first time around had been long enough. As one of the prime steakhouses in the area, I expect a place of this caliber to be close, if not perfect, on their meat cook temperature. The best parts of the meal were the bread and butter, the bourbon, and the service.  Being my first time here, I was beyond disappointed in the food."}
{"text":"Went here on a suggestion from friends while in town for the Steelers game. They did not disappoint. Food was amazing and service from Rian (Re-on) was above and beyond. Everyone's steaks were cooked at the right temperature. The steaks were really great. Manager came over to make sure everything was to our liking which it was. Excellent experience and will be back next time we visit Pittsburgh!!!"}
{"text":"This is a phenomenal place for a nice dinner and some drinks.  I would definately go back just for a happy hour.  Lately I have been craving fruity drinks/cocktails.  We asked for a cocktail list and honestly everything sounded delicious.  I went with the Crushed Berries cocktail.  I can't stop thinking about this drink.  The drink was made with Cirroc Berry Vodka, fresh crushed blueberries, lime and syrup.  It's a good thing I had made a reservation or I may not have made it to dinner. This cocktail was just what I needed and we were celebrating my boyfriend's birthday.  For dinner we shared a Ribeye, garlic whipped potatoes, and the macaroni and cheese.  Our ribeye was cooked perfectly.  We both like our steaks rare and it isn't easy getting a steak the way we like it.  The macaroni and cheese melted in my mouth, it was THAT GOOD!"}
{"text":"It's restaurant week in Pittsburgh!  As always, Hyde Park impressed!  I went with a friend who had never been.  With the rain we did valet parking - which is SO much easier.  In all honesty - it wasn't clear whether it cost the $5 to valet or not.  So he either got a $10 or a $5 tip :)  The sign was not out, but was folded up under the awning but still visible.  

Anyways - the service was impeccable.  Our water was never even half full, our food came one course after another with out much wait or hesitation.  Some restaurants make their portions smaller to accommodate restaurant week prices.  However - Hyde park does not - a huge caesar salad (seriously - I didn't eat half of it!  But tried!), a big ol' filet, mashed potatoes and onion straws - and dessert.  

It was all phenomenal.  Some folks find it taxing going to the the North Shore to eat - but even in the pouring down rain - it was easy to get to, easy to park (valet!) and an enjoyable time.  I had been to a different steakhouse in Pgh the evening before for restaurant week and for me - hyde park - was SO much better than that stuffy restaurant :)"}
{"text":"Took a group of eight for a leisurely business dinner.... When we made reservations, It was suggested we reserve one of their private rooms. What a great move. We were seated in a way cool room with a cool wine vibe and were able to talk, toast and move around. 

The service was attentive and unobtrusive. Oh, and the food! Everyone raved about their food. The sides were a big hit -- Gruyere potatoes, spinach & mushrooms, even the pretzel bread were fabulous!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times and the ambiance is nice, but the steak is average at best. I think it's overpriced for the quality you're getting."}
{"text":"My last few experiences at Hyde Park were 2 or 3 star occasions, so I'm pleasantly surprised to let you know that they seem to be back on their game.  

My pops and I both started with the tomato salad.  I ordered it with smoked mozzarella, he got the blue cheese version (his was better).  For the main course, I had the bone-in rib-eye and my pops had the dry aged Kansas City strip steak.  Both were cooked perfectly (medium rare, none of that medium + bullshit) and served with delicious onion straws.

We really came to Hyde Park solely because he had to use some gift certificates, but at the end of the night we were glad he had received them and ready to give this place another chance."}
{"text":"Hyde Park continues to be our favorite stop before a baseball game.  So much nicer that trying to balance nachos in your lap or downing a hot dog while standing.

We had called ahead last night to reserve a plush booth in the bar area.  We were greeted and seated promptly.  Service, as always was fantastic.  We had our usual drinks, I enjoyed Cosmo and BJ downed bottles of nicely priced beers.

Since I was pretending to eat light, I ordered the crab cakes appetizer.  Their crab cakes are decent, but it's what they are served with the makes them extra special.  Mine were served with a yummy red pepper aioli and some grainy mustard sauce with a sprig of broccoli rabe, a roasted red tomato and some delicious grated carrots.   Great combination of flavors.  BJ got the a French Dip from the Early Nights menu.  Sliced prime rib with horseradish sauce served on a hefty French roll with fries.  And it came with side and a choice of soup or salad.  He got the half Hyde Park Wedge which is a half of head of iceberg lettuce, tons of blue cheese dressing, with crispy bacon & candied pecans.  This is hands down, one of the best salads in the city.  We both loved it, yes he shared!  For his side he decided to try the potatoes Gruyère gratin.  Wow, so incredibly good.  This is the best side dish anywhere.  And so much for eating light!

After the game, we decided to stop by again to hang out while traffic cleared out a bit.  Since this was an April game, it was a bit chilly outside, so we got coffees with Bailey's to warm us up.  We love everything about Hyde Park, especially the great service!  It's not only a great steakhouse, it's a great place for bar food, too."}
{"text":"I love love love steak. And if you want to good steak go to Hyde Park. The calamari is amazing, has a great Thai chili glaze on top. Not chewy or overcooked. My filet (mushrooms and garlic cloves on top) was actually a little bit undercooked this time but they fixed it for me right away and actually sent me home with a free dessert, a flourless chocolate tort. I also got the au gratin potatoes, my favorite. For the price I love Hyde park compared to other steakhouses because I always have tons of leftovers to take home! Can't beat it!"}
{"text":"We were in Pittsburgh for the Stadium series weekend. Had dinner here Friday night. We didn't have reservations and ended up sitting in the lounge at a table with two chairs and a love seat. It was comfy.Bar was next to us and crowded. 
I had a Porterhouse steak. It was good. Girls had burgers which they said were delicious. Prices were expensive. Steaks overpriced. 
Located right next to stadiums so location is prime. Next time we will try a different place."}
{"text":"This is a great place if you aren't a steak person and you enjoy seafood. The shrimp cocktail and lobster bisque are delicious. I also really like the shrimp and scallop sauté. The ambiance is beautiful. And I really like the manager over there. He is really friendly and remembers you. 

Cons: the crab that they use for the crab cake or on the crab wedge salad is not good. It's not lump and has a filler that is not very good."}
{"text":"It doesn't look like much from the outside, but if you're looking for a great steakhouse, be sure to check out Hyde Park Grille. The bar area is excellent - large and inviting - and the experienced staff pour a mean drink. I can vouch for the lump crab appetizer, served with cocktail sauce, spicy mustard, and lots of fresh lemons. The beef carpaccio is also quite tasty, and a nice plate to share.

In the mood for a tower of seafood? Hyde Park delivers a three-tiered extravaganza, complete with oysters, shrimp, crab, and lobster. It's pricey, at $65 for two, but the portions easily feed three to four. In fact, all the plates are over-sized, even the salads, so feel free to split various side items and entrees. You'll eat less and save some cash, as Hyde Park Grille is not an inexpensive place to drink and dine. But the service is good, and so is the food.

If, like me, you have allergies, the staff will work with you to ensure a safe dining experience. Bon appetit!"}

{"text":"My first time in the Cleveland area was right before the New Year. We were visiting family, and because said family has members that are VERY PARTICULAR about what or where they eat, they made dinner reservations at Hyde Park Grille for our group around 6pm. 

I personally hate steakhouses, but thankfully the menu offered several different seafood options - and not just salmon, shrimp, lobster and crab. We joined our family at their table and were given the run down on the menu by our waiter. Here's where my experience soured a bit. He was perfectly lovely to begin with, but when he asked if we wanted drinks and we all refused (most were sick, others chose not to drink) we could see a shift in his demeanor. Also, I do not appreciate how he was aggressively pushing so many items to add to our orders. 

Everyone else ended up over ordering because they succumbed to his pressure and got salads in addition to their entrees, with an unnecessary side dish (oh, did I mention that their sauces cost $$ too? Don't bother ordering them, you won't need it unless you really want lobster/crab on top of your steak). I, knowing that these dishes had to be gigantic portions, merely ordered the seared tuna appetizer with a side of asparagus - and that was PERFECT in portion. I had no leftovers and everyone else left at least half of their plates filled with food (except the two gentlemen, who only left their salad plates half full). I will say that the food was quite good - every meat was perfectly cooked to order (when I say rare, I mean RARE and that's what I got!). The side vegetables were also delicious and not overcooked, unusual at steakhouses. One person ordered dessert to share, the apple pie which is it's own mini pie with an equal amount of ice cream as there was pie. Also delicious despite the 10 minute wait. 

Overall the dinner was fine, but our server needs a lesson in customer service and they ought to heat that place when it's December - I was freezing, and there was an entire table eating dinner while wearing their puffy coats! And lord was it expensive! I'll probably end up eating here again in the future, but it won't be by choice."}
{"text":"Normally I wouldn't write something about a place like this on here, but for the waygu carpaccio alone it's worth shouting about. Seriously SO GOOD. Good drinks and food bartender too. Sadly it's right on my way home so I think there are probably many more 80 dollar happy hours in my future."}
{"text":"I would rate the food a 4 but the service a zero giving my overall score a 2 - 2.5.  We ate at the bar thinking it would be quicker but were dead wrong.   Dishes were piled up  on the bar right next to us that were never clean the entire 2 hours we were there.  All we heard was bartenders/servers making excuses that it was such a disaster because of 300 in for holiday party.  Frankly, I don't care when I am paying Hyde Park prices. Inexcusable.  If you know you are aware the bar area is filthy and the service slow, you should comp something...anything"}
{"text":"My husband and I are regular customers at this specific Hyde Park and typically dine there once a week. On Thursday, June 21, my friend and I went for Happy Hour and sat at a table in the bar. I ordered a martini which was not made properly and was obviously watered down. One of the managers, Molly, was defensive and outright rude by stating \"This is pure alcohol! We can't possibly fit more alcohol into this glass!\" She treated me as if I was a lush even though I hardly ever drink. I am highly offended and I will NEVER patronize a Hyde Park property again. For the record, the other managers (Anthony, Dana Matthei Kess, Keith Brown) have always been more than accommodating since I am, or was, a regular patron. Molly needs additional training so she does not offend future customers."}
{"text":"Service was excellent true in rating is 50 minimum for a good steak but the food was great and they had good wine selections"}
{"text":"Enjoyed our 5pm dinner hear on Sat. May 9th 2015.  Our son's birthday and college graduation day at his choice restaurant.  
  I believe all five of us enjoyed our food,  I had the aged prime rib-eye bone in steak.  I have been a long time fan of aged beef.  Most people don't even know what the heck I'm talking about when I ask about aged beef.  It was my pleasure to enjoy this again.  
  The staff is great, attentive, even gave my son a card  and free dessert for his day !!  
Our servers yes two servers, we're both really helpful and friendly.  It is pricey, but a nice place for a special day.
  The reasons for only 4 stars: I am older and have had aged prime rib that had a deeper, more unique flavor.  It was so strong and unique I have craved it for years !!
Sadly I have yet to find it again."}
{"text":"It's always hit or miss at Hyde Park for us.  Sometimes the oysters are amazing, sometimes, not so much.  This was a not-so much day.  i'm not sure what was off - maybe it was me!  The escargot was very good and the bread basket was delish as usual.  Warm bread and butter with garlicy escargot?  YUM. 

While we will continue to frequent Hyde Park due to its proximity, I might leave the oysters to happy hour so I wont be so disappointed when they aren't as great as I want them to be."}
{"text":"I try to make it to Hyde Park as often as I can, and below is the reason why. For my Birthday I invite 5-10 of my closest friends out to celebrate my birthday with drinks and a great meal. Saturday Night was that night! We were seated at a comfortable table with an excellent waiter named William. He promptly took our drink orders, and decanted the bottles of wine we brought. At this point our salads and appetizers arrived. I had a delicious Caesar Salad. For the main course, I had my annual treat... The 6oz Japanese Wagyu Strip Loin. This is arguably the great cut of meat ever. The marbling is perfect. When you order this they provide you with all the details about the piece of meat. It basically melts in your mouth. It was cooked rare to perfection. I then had a piece of flourless chocolate cake to complete the meal. Hyde Park proved yet again why it's one of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh!!!"}
{"text":"As far as steakhouse chains go, this one is pretty comparable to the others. I genuinely don't see much difference between them all, other than Capital Grill might offer a good amount of seafood selections, like this place does and I do love a good surf and turf! 

I had the lobster bisque, which was excellent and I definitely finished it to the last drop. I ordered the t-bone steak, and while it was good, I feel like I would have had a tastier meat choice with a filet or ribeye. Sometimes other cuts of steaks surprise me with how much flavor they have, but this t-bone was just a normal tasting steak to me. I loved the brussels sprout side dish, especially with the macadamia nuts. Great addition to the dish! 

Our service was excellent, as expected with these types of places. Very attentive and of course the manager stopped by to say hello and ask if everything was okay. This is fancy pants dining after all. 

I honestly think it just comes down to location for me. Where do I want to head for a steakhouse, in town or North Shore. That makes my decision. I can't imagine you'd get a bad meal here though!"}
{"text":"My husband and I wanted a little happy hour fun and headed to the North Shore.  Now, I've had experiences here in the past and was totally pleased, however, this time I wasn't impressed.  We sat at the bar and ordered off the happy hour menu.  For the reputation of the restaurant, the happy hour menu was a complete disappointment.  The calamari was rubbery, over fried, and we left a majority of it on the plate.  The flatbread pizza was foul also.  Clearly frozen and heated up.  Yuck!  Drinks were OK, but watered down.  Don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"The steaks (filet mignon and strip) were very good, but I'm not a fan of the butter on top.  Had I realized, I would have asked them to hold the butter.  The onion straws with the steaks are a nice touch.  The potatoes au gratin have tons of onion and would pass on that the next time. The salads were good and huge and can definitely be shared. Pretzel bread was a hit.  Drink and wine pricing a bit better than other steak houses in Pittsburgh.  Service was generally very good. Not a fan of paying for valet parking in their adjacent lot.  When paying these prices, parking should be included."}
{"text":"In my opinion, they have some of the best steaks in Pittsburgh. It's pricey so I typically only attend when entertaining clients. But the service is great and the atmosphere is relaxed. No complaints with the food. One of the better upscale restaurants in the city in my opinion."}
{"text":"First time at this restaurant and won't be the last!  
Incredible dinner at Hyde Park downtown Cleveland tonight!  From the moment we walked in we were greeted by the manager who did an outstanding and very thorough job explaining the wine list, server Kendra did a great job through all the courses, it was first class service! I would highly recommend this awesome restaurant from all the downtown dining choices. We will definitely be back.  Hyde Park is a true class act!"}
{"text":"Steak, especially petite filet was delish. Really good service - very attentive. Sides are served family style. Very similar to other high end steak places."}
{"text":"I've decided to write an update and add a star to this place after my experience last night.  I was there for a business dinner with a bunch of folks who encouraged me to add a star and mention each by name, so here I am.  This is a chain restaurant, but a relatively small chain with locations primarily in OH, PA and now FL.  They attempt to compete with the high end steakhouses (Ruths, Palm, Mortons, Capital Grille) and up until last night I felt they were mostly out of their league.  However, my opinion has changed.  We arrived last night at about 6:30 PM.  They have a great circular bar with a few hightops and a deep relaxing red tone to the whole place.  Their wine selection is displayed in the front near a few areas for lounging.  They have a couple of fireplaces and it's a white tablecloth type of dining scene with multiple private rooms.  It's a relatively large restaurant and they also offer valet parking.  In terms of atmosphere it may be my favorite.  The feel is a little different than capital grille which feels \"clubby\".  This place has a less formal or younger feel.  Keith organized us all together and we started with good cocktails at the bar I had a nice ketel dirty rocks martini with blue cheese olives that was served by a very nice and professional bar matron.  We ordered a bunch of things, so I hope to remember them all.  I ordered raw oysters which were served fresh, cold with a nice tasting cocktail sauce.  Tom had the seared ahi, which was good quality tuna coated slightly with sesame seeds and served with a wasabi and siracha sauce.  I think Keith and Lloyd ordered the calamari which was great!  If you can only order one appetizer here get the calamari.  It's lightly breaded served with a sweet and hot light sauce.  The only calamari slightly better in the city is my buddy Ron's at Pangea.  I can't quite recall if we ordered any other apps'.  I chose the lobster bisque instead of a salad and I was hoping it was better than the last time I ordered.  It wasn't.  This bisque was my only real disappointment of the night.  It was too think and the lobster was unnoticeable.  Jim, Matt and Pat all ordered the iceberg wedge which was huge and looked really good.  It's your standard half a head of lettuce served with blue cheese and bacon I believe.  I was really impressed with the entrees' and sides.  They tailor a portion of the menu to reflect a sports theme.  They also serve plenty of steaks bone in which is much more flavorful.  I had the 22 oz. Santonio Holmes bone in Ribeye medium rare.  It was delicious and as good as any steak I've ever had.  The beef was prime, cooked perfectly on an 1800' grille and served pipin hot.  I didn't care for the teeny onion rings on the side but they were easy enough to push away.  Most of us ordered these and were all impressed.  Keith had the bone in strip which also looked really good.  The sides were perfect.  The asparagus was huge and the hollaindaise was not coagulated.  The mushrooms were cooked well and the mashed potatoes were creamy and rich.  There were a few desserts ordered.  I sampled the carrot cake and it was great.  It was easily big enough for three.  I mostly drank the house shiraz all night which was fine and I'm guessing less than $10 a glass.  Overall this place has really picked up it's game and in my opinion can finally compete in the high end steakhouse arena."}
{"text":"Happy hour review: Good drinks, good food. 

Went with some co-workers for happy hour. They have drinks for $5, $6 & $7, plus some great small plates and appetizers, starting at $5. 

The drinks were well-made, the sliders and fries were awesome. Can't wait for our next happy hour."}
{"text":"This restaurant did not disappoint. The service was exceptional and the food was even better. The oysters were fresh and prepared juat the way I like them. The jumbo shrimp were cooked perfectly as well. The jumbo lump crab cake had tons of crab inside and it tasted great. The heirloom tomato mozzarella salad was probably one of the best caprese-type salads I have ever eaten.

The main course was great, I had the filet with a peppercorn and cabernet glaze and I devoured it quickly. The table had lobster Mac and cheese which was quite yummy and full of flavor. The asparagus were good, although they were huge and became cold pretty quickly after they sat on the table. For desert I had the key lime pie, which was creamy and not too sweet with a hint of bitterness. We had a bottle of cabernet, I think it was called mount veeder, it was great. If you are willing to spend a bunch of money on dinner, I recommend this place!"}
{"text":"It was our 25th anniversary and decided to go to Hyde park because it was recommended  by a good friend  The manager/host was great friendly The wine was tasty and the bisque and filet  and red velvet cake was good Our daughter wasn't a fan of crab cake . Liked the fact they had valet parking and they were very nice also but it  Just didn't feel all that special and for a 300 dollar bill we could of gotten the same for less Not sure why they ask us if we were celebrating anything."}
{"text":"Fantastic steak dinner.  Waygu Carpaccio to die for.  Great Caesar salad.  Early bird specials are really well priced, I had twin petite fillets.  However the New York strip steaks were off the regular menu were quite impressive.  Brussels sprouts served family style were delicious.
A great finish to a day at the museum."}
{"text":"After enjoying my experience at Hyde Park in Columbus, Ohio, a few years ago, I decided to take my brother to the Cleveland location for his birthday.  I called ahead and the host who took my call asked if the reservation was for a special occasion.  I told him it was my brother's birthday, and when we arrived there was a birthday card for him on the table!

There is a good selection of wines and spirits, and a decent menu.  As we noticed at the table next to us, there is even a kid's menu for the little 'uns.

I ordered the prix-fixe Fillet menu, but wanted a little something extra.  For a side, I was waffling between Potatoes Gruyère Gratin and the Roasted Garlic Whipped Potatoes, so I asked the waitress what her recommendation was.  Without hesitation, she steered me to the Potatoes Gruyère Gratin, which was the best suggestion I have ever received at a restaurant.  They were cheesy and huge and fantastically delicious.  I could have finished one on my own, but then would have had to be forklifted out of there.  Definitely bring a friend or relative to split it with.

Unfortunately, for a steakhouse, the meat was probably the least memorable part.  The sides, wine, service, and presentation were fantastic, but the meat was disappointing.  My medium-rare filet wasn't particularly flavorful, and the texture was a bit off too.

The celebration ended with them bringing out a complimentary slice of cake for my brother as I ate the dessert that came with my prix-fixe menu.  A lovely evening to a great night out.

High Points: Great service.  Order the Potatoes Gruyère Gratin.  Don't think, just do it.

Low Points: The meat itself was actually not cooked particularly well.  Ordered medium-rare, came out a bit tough and not very juicy."}
{"text":"I'd say the 3.5 stars on Yelp is about right.

Service - very great and helpful

Calamari - a bit overcooked and drowned in sweet chili sauce. I don't recommend it. 

Steak - Ribeye - very good. Nice set of options. Medium-rare but just slightly over-cooked."}
{"text":"I'm no stranger to steakhouses all across the country. On a recent lunch visit to Hyde Park, our waiter was overly cloying and hovering. He removed my salad plate before my friend finished her salad, and had a somewhat condescending attitude all through the meal. 

He described the \"twin filet\" lunch special, and when we ordered it, he asked which of their \"toppings\" we'd like, and described them. What he neglected to mention was that the tiny dollop of topping was priced at a full 50% of the entire lunch special! So a $21 \"businessman's lunch\" was now $32! Very misleading. 

Sorry, but next time I'll go across the street to Morton's."}
