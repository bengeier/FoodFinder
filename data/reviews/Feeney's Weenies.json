{"text":"Pretty good dogs. They grill Hebrew National all beef dogs and grill the bun. Wasn't a huge fan of the velveeta cheese but everything else was tops."}
{"text":"100% the best hot dogs and Mac n cheese I've had in Pittsburgh. Actually anywhere. Soooo good."}
{"text":"Really solid hot dog place.  Nice bakery style buns.  Coleslaw, baked beans and fries were all well done.  Shoe string fries which I love.  The dogs themselves were tasty and a cool variety of speciality dogs or make your own.  The only thing I didn't love was the potato salad.  Not bad just not awesome.  It's tiny inside, one two seater high top table and a few stools facing the street.  We will definitely be back and are glad to have a hot dog joint after dormont dogs being gone."}
{"text":"Delicious food, great service, reasonable prices, run by friendly, hard-working hometown guys... Their hot dogs are more than just your average dog with ketchup and relish. The recipes are classic with a creative spin. My personal favorite is the Pittsburgh Dog. Definitely stop by, you won't regret it!!!"}
{"text":"Hole in the wall dive with some elite hot dog action. Nice people and great food. 

We came all the way from Dallas for this."}
{"text":"This place isn't just for hot dogs.. Though the weenies are great! The wings are super crispy and there are lots of tasty flavor options to choose from. The french fries are hand cut, and dare I say, better than Potato Patch's fries! The owners are stand up guys; always friendly and welcoming. And the prices are very reasonable for the portions! What a great business to have in the community!"}
{"text":"Awesome food.  I got the pittsburgh dog and a side of Mac and cheese. The Mac and cheese was great. I would definitely get it again, very cheesy and delicious. My hot dog was also great. Comes with coleslaw,fries, and cheese. The coleslaw is amazing. I would get it again as a side alone it was so good. My boyfriend got the meatball hoagie and fries. The fries are really good and his meatball hoagie was also good (although I think my hotdog was better). We also tried the ores cheesecake. I wanted to try the red velvet waffles I saw pictures of on here but the guy working there informed me there waffle machine had broken so they had to take it off the menu. I was disappointed but the ores cheesecake definitely made up for it. Very creamy . The guys that work there are super friendly. I would definitely come back again, I'm curious to try their other hotdogs!"}
{"text":"I love a good hot dog and we were excited to try this place out after hearing great things. We drove by one night with family and it turned out to be just a small inside counter with only about 2 seats. They do have a picnic table outside for nice weather days. We decided to come back a few weeks later and planned for take out this time.  I ordered the regular hot dog and they have a wide variety of free toppings including ketchup, mustard, onions and pickles that I went for.  My fianc√© ordered 2 of the specialty dogs, one with mac and cheese with bacon the other with spicy peppers and sauce.  We loved them all and the dogs are served on large fresh buns and they split the dog lenghtwise to get the toppings inside-yum.   For $2.50 extra you can get an order of fries and drink.  I ordered 2 sides instead and got the mac and cheese which was amazing and I highly recommend. I also got the potato salad which was not so great-basically frozen hash browns in mayonnaise.  Regardless it is still worth stopping by when in the area."}
{"text":"Great little hot dog shop, pgh dog & smokehouse are amazing, love the shoestring fries too. Nice addition to broadway ave"}
{"text":"Chili dog done right! Great dive in a good yinzer location of The Burgh. Great staff. Micah is one sexy mofo. Most certainly a return visit when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"These Irish boys do it right! Every dog I've had is spectacular. I order something different each time. Even their sides are great! Plus they're very welcoming too. Right down from Slice on Broadway. Check them out!"}
{"text":"Great dogs and welcome addition to the area. I had The Porker and it was amazing. Strips of bacon! Not bits but strips!"}
{"text":"Hot diggity dog!  A good hot dog place to replace my fave DD.
If you like a plain dog or one of the specialties of the house, you won't be disappointed.  A great place to get a quick dog and take the kids.  I have had the Smokehouse with fries and was so pleased.  The menu includes a Mac & Cheese dog - oreo cheesecake squares - chicken and a veggie.  

Only one small hightop table so it is really take out.  
But if in the mood for a dog, this is the place!"}
