{"text":"Great pizza and fresh ingredients. The only downside is the wait, but this is because they are still new. I hope this place stays around for awhile."}
{"text":"Yeah, this is the best pizza I've had in Pittsburgh, and I've tried most of the options. Rockaway is worth my half hour drive in each direction to get it.  Most pizza shops around here seem to always have something holding back the quality of the product. The cheese and sauce might be good, but the crust sucks. The crust and sauce are good, but the cheese tastes like shit, it's undercooked, etc. etc. I'm used to compromising on pizza, because no one around here seems to know what the hell they're doing.   Rockaway, however, has obviously made it a point to get everything right. Ingredients, cooking method, value, and presentation... all beyond expectations.  The crust had the right consistency and taste, the sauce was flavorful but not overbearing, and the cheese is phenomenal. We got our pizza with mushrooms and pepperoni, both of which came in generous portions and tasted excellent. Keep in mind, this is AFTER spending over a half hour in my car on the ride home. Really impressive.  Not to mention the fact that the pizza, with an order of pepperoni knots only cost $22. It's a damn good deal, considering I've spent closer to $30 in Pittsburgh for pizza alone, and it was smaller and far shittier than Rockaway's.  Also, I should mention how refreshing it is that this place cuts your pizza into 8 massive slices instead of hacking it into a dozen and a half 2\" little bitch-sized portions. And the pepperoni knots... I was shocked to see how many were in the box.  If you haven't given this place a shot yet, do it."}
{"text":"This pizza is pure art, and the owner is a super pizza nerd who will talk your ear off about the history of pizza. Been here a few times, and learn something new (as well as eat something new) each time. Simply awesome pizza joint."}
{"text":"First time getting food here at Rockaway. It was By far the best pizza (made by mike) !! Lasagna and pepperoni pizza was amazing. Great food, clean kitchen, friendly / knowledgeable chefs !!! Only place I'll go when visiting the area."}
{"text":"Best NY style pizza in Pittsburgh area and one of a few pizza shops that only uses 100% whole milk mozzarella. Ingredients are high quality and not reflected in the price which is dirt cheap for what they are serving up. The menu is small so they can focus on what they are good at. This is a new small business and they aren't working with much equipment wise so expect a bit of a wait until the initial curiousity dies down. I'll happily wait for a pizza that doesn't have provolone mixed in the cheese."}
{"text":"I don't get the hype about this place. Tried it once after reading all the raving reviews on Facebook but I was pretty disappointed- pizza wasn't anything different or special from anywhere else. The crust tasted like water, very little toppings & it was way over priced for what it was.  Maybe I came on a bad day but I don't plan on trying again."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza!!!! Stopped here by chance and I'm so glad we discovered this place. New York style pizza done right. All the pizzas are 18 inches and amazing. Great price too. They are open on Sunday's now as well (we went 12/10/17). You may accidentally pass it up but it's worth it to find it. Marked just by a little sign, it is definitely worth the stop."}
{"text":"This is great pizza.  You have to try this place.  The owner is a pizza artist.  I'm very happy to find a place like this in White Oak.  It's different compare to the good pizza places around."}
{"text":"Classic thin crust pizza that taste great"}
{"text":"In the past few months have been to a few major metro cities and always sample their pizza.  From the interaction in the small shop to the smells in the car to the combination of smokey cheese with sweet/chunky tomato -y sauce and the not thick but not thin crust of large enough to cave in, slices, literally everything together is perfect.  And in White Oak?!  Note to Pizza Master, please do not change a thing.   Will be back for a sub.   The homemade Italian dressing is perfect too.   ( We had one margherita with pepperoni, and one with sausage and artichoke.)    33.00 total which for the quality of ingredients and amount seemed reasonably priced."}
{"text":"White Oak is full of take out pizza locations for you to choose from but over the last year Rockaway has become a favorite at my house.  I have yet to try anything I didn't like.  If you not sure where to start when ordering a pizza try the artichoke pie. WOW.  I wish I could east this everyday.  It had artichokes, an amazing cream sauce, with bacon and spinach on top.  Yummmmmyyy  BUT you certainly can't go wrong with anything else.  Make note the Sicilian is very heavy but still good and the knots are amazing.  I like to get the garlic and ask for the artichoke sauce from the bacon knots. Also all their pizzas are New York style and is an 8 cut.   That's it. So I hope your hungry!  There is no delivery but that will never stop me from ordering here.   Then you know it is fresh out of the oven when you pick it up."}
{"text":"Been going to Rockaway for several weeks now after the early football games on Sunday. I heard their pizza was so good I had to make the trip. Their Pizza IS so good, it is well worth the drive from Monroeville. Top notch pizza I have to say, up with the 'best of the best' around here and New York Style to boot. Excellent crust, cheese and toppings make this a best of pizza. Today we also added a meatball calzone to our order which was totally up to the pizza standards. Garlic Knots that we like a lot, are great for an appetizer. What would I improve? Add two containers of sauce with the calzone instead of just one, because it is sooooo goooood.  One Tip at this time is: they ARE for sure OPEN on Sunday, because that is my football pizza day."}
{"text":"Omg this pizza is amazing some of the best I have ever had...the sauce is the best, the the pepperoni is to die for, great New York pizza place, better then other pizza places in the white oak area hands down, u want the best this is it, and the owner is nice and seems to actually care, will keep coming back"}
{"text":"My pizza was very good. Crust was thin, curly pepperoni  and thinly sliced spicy sausage adorned my pie plentifully oozing with cheese....I will definitely be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"I ordered a cheese pizza with half pepperoni and half sausage. They said to give them 30 minutes, which I did and when I ride the pizza was hot and ready.   It was hard not to notice that--for a small, take out pizzeria--the people working behind the counter looked both busy and very serious about their craft. The young lady who took my phone order cashed me out when I arrived was both courteous and fast.  I've been wanting to try Rockaway for quite some time, and it was totally worth the wait. The pizza was huge, covered in cheese with just the right amount of sauce. (I hate when the sauce overpowers the pizza and makes the crust soggy) The little curly pieces of pepperoni were perfection, and the slices of sausage were spicy and tasty.    The crust was delicious-- cooked all the way through and not too thin, and strong enough to hold all that cheese, pepperoni and sausage.  I wholeheartedly recommend Rockaway for anyone who is looking for something a little different and incredibly tasty in a pizza!"}
{"text":"Just what i was looking for!  Great NY Style Pizza.  I haven't had such a good pizza in over 25 years. I will be back!"}
{"text":"I've been a repeat customer of this place for a year now since they opened and the quality has been consistent, or even better. I very much agree with the positive reviews here, especially the one which mentioned that this place gets everything right when others would miss out on one element that would make it the perfect pie. I understand taste is very relative (hence some negative reviews here) but Rockaway's for me has the perfect crust flavor and texture, the freshest cheese, high-quality ingredients, and it's all seasoned just right... and I'm even more pleased with the new flavors they have. I've tried many hyped-up pizza places in Pittsburgh before and (as my bf worded it), \"other pizzas make me appreciate Rockaway's more\". I personally wouldn't allow myself to have any other pizza for cheat day. So hard to resist getting it all the time since it's only 10 mins away from me. For recommendations: if you like white sauce, get The Artichoke. If you like sweet+salty combo get The Honey Pie. For an overall indulgent and rich, cheesy treat, get The Lasagna and add bacon to it (you're welcome)."}
{"text":"We ordered the  February pizza of the month special - super deal!!  It was yummy!!"}
{"text":"The best pizza around.  You can tell the quality of the ingredients once you take your first bite.  I hope they stick around for a long time, because they bring a great product to this area that is appreciated!"}
{"text":"My first time having their pizza and I don't want anyone else's! I purchased the Frankenstein not knowing what I was really in for. It was so good."}
{"text":"Crust was thin and crispy on edges. Sauce was good and perfect amount of cheese. Takeout only. Opened about 4 months ago. It was good pizza. Try it"}
{"text":"So this place has a great New York style pizza. I love thin crispy pizza, but I also like a good Grandma pizza \"square or Sicilian\". So far I have only been able to have their's once and it reminded me of Di Fara's in Brooklyn, just not as crispy. Here is the bitch. It's impossible to order. It takes 45 min to and hour to make which after thinking on it makes sense, I get it but you can't get it between 4-7pm on Friday and Saturday. Damm man it's a great pie but so hard to get........"}
{"text":"Rockaway is hands down my favorite pizza in Pittsburgh and ranks in the top 3 for New York style pizza that I've ever had. No matter what your toppings of choice are, you can't go wrong. Whether it be just a cheese pie, or if you like your pizza loaded with various meats and veggies, they have a plethora of options to choose from.  They also have various specials throughout the week, so make sure you follow them on Facebook to take advantage of the specials. I tend to stick to ordering pizza, but the specials also enticed me to order the hoagies or calzones on occasion.  Everything on the menu has definitely exceeded my expectations.  If you haven't had the chance to try Pizza Rockaway yet, please do yourself a favor and order some soon!"}
{"text":"Overall pretty good pizza defiantly not five star. But they forgot the half mushrooms for the pizza. Pepperoni rolls were tasty. Average eat."}
{"text":"Oh what a find!! Four of us went to dinner to escape the lent fish fries. While seating is very limited, Josh and team made a great salad and we ate that while waiting on pizza. Rockaway New York pizza is my new favorite. We were treated so nicely, too. Will be back soon. Wish these fine folks all the best!"}
{"text":"Favorite local pizza joint. Everything they make is flavorful and you don't feel like you're paying too much for not enough. Make sure to try the steak hoagies!"}
