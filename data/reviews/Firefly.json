{"text":"One of my favorite hang-out spots in Vegas!  My friends and I been loungin' at Firefly since 2005 and I have nothing but praises to say.  Sangria and Mojitos are smooth plus their calamari and paella are delicious.  As I said, I have nothing but praises!!"}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere. It is nice to have a kick back place located next to Summerlin that is open late. 
The food is okay.. The patio area is fun and inspiring. 
I go here to nibble on food and maybe enjoy a cocktail."}
{"text":"LOVED this place! We came here with friends that live in Las Vegas and they introduced us to this amazing place. I fell in love with the hoisin duck rolls, stuffed dates and the mac & cheese. It was also my first time having tres leches chocolate cake which was like an orgasm in my mouth! the sangria is delicous and they have soo many different types of mojitos there to try. The prices are excellent. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"What a great fun place to come with anyone. The food is excellent I definitely have tried almost all the things on the menu. The vegetarian selection is pretty good and don't forget about those drinks the white sangria is definitely my favorite. Fun place love the atmosphere great location."}
{"text":"Start with a sangria, just trust me.....WOW.  The tapas are fresh, interesting, and some are even a good deal. Tuna tartare.... big hit. Lamb chops... fantastic... hip place with a lively vibe... and not a ripoff like much of the strip..."}
{"text":"Wow...great place. Just came for \"linner\". Best tapas I've had.  Definitely try the stuffed dates!! Even if you hate dates. You'll never know"}
{"text":"The food is alright and the service is ok. However , I think this place is over rated. 

The lighting is dim, which can be romantic, and the decor is quaint. Firefly has good ambiance and it can be nice place to take a date.

Just make sure its not on a busy night, because the seating in the dining room is very close together. On a busy Friday night, our set of 3 felt like we were at an awkward dinner party where only small groups were allowed to face each other at a particular time. It was like if we turned our head at any moment we would be part of a different group and/or conversation. 
 

If you dare order a pitcher of Sangria or anything else please say \"no ice\". I swear I paid $28 for a 2lbs bag of ice in a mug with a splash of Sangria........very disappointing. 

I would not go as far as to say I won't ever eat there again,...... but I will not be the one paying for the meal or for the wild horses it will take to drag me there either!"}
{"text":"If I had to choose a favorite restaurant in Las Vegas, FireFly on Paradise tapas is it. The food is great, not really expensive, prompt service, and a good, all-around atmosphere. There is a good buzz without being noisy; the staff is cool without being stuck up; and the patrons seem pretty cool too while being cross generational. They've got a patio if the weather isn't too extreme either way and a lounge area if you just want to hang with friends and drink. 

I have never had a bad dish here but theses are among my favorites: 

-White sangria 
-Tuna tartare 
-Stuffed dates 
-Manchego mac 'n' cheese (some of the best mac 'n' cheese I've had) 
-Albondigas (meatballs) 
-Paella"}
{"text":"Rates were good until they zap you with mileage charges for anything over 5 miles per day. This is lunacy. Then the clerk stated mileage charges were $1 per mile  for anything over 5 miles per day. Unbelievable. Firefly is owned by Hertz where I am a long-time Goldmember. Customer service apologized but would do nothing to fix this rate problem at Las Vegas McCarran Airport"}
{"text":"Firefly recently started serving brunch, and I have been wanting to try it since they started. I finally decided to go to celebrate my 22nd birthday with some friends. The brunch was so good, and you can still order from the rest of the menu if you want. It is a tapas breakfast still, which at first I was a little skeptical about, but it ended up being great! I had their patatas bravas (Potatoes) and the carne asada breakfast taco. The tacos are like little street tacos, but they were SO good. I also tried one of the Pumpkin Beignets, they look a little bit like donut holes,  they didn't really taste like pumpkin, but they were still a tasty treat. 

Most importantly, for brunch they have all you can drink (with a 2 hour limit), mimosas, sangria, and bloody marys. I obviously had to try all of them. The mimosas were very good, I am not a big fan of bloody marys while I'm eating, but besides that it was a very basic bloody mary, still tasty. Their sangria is always good, so no surprise there. I like to get the sparkling white, because I'm not a big wine fan. We definitely stayed the whole two hours. 

Besides the food, the service was great! There were about 10 of us so we had a lot of people coming over to help. The manager even stopped by to wish me happy birthday which was very nice! I also got a birthday shot, great place to go to celebrate! I would definitely recommend!

*disclaimer: I had written this almost a year ago, and apparently forgot to submit it. I just noticed it was still in my drafts and decided I should still post it!"}
{"text":"I love this place and have been going here regularly for seven years since I moved to Las Vegas. I know the menu like the back of my hand, and I'm glad to see that they have been improving and expanding to areas like Henderson and Summerlin. Fun atmosphere, and delicious. I always bring my out of town friends here and they are impressed every time. Five Stars! 

*Yum!*"}
{"text":"If I lived in Las Vegas (which I never will), I could easily become a regular here. The food is imaginative, well prepared, delicious, and plentiful at this L.V. eatery. On top of that, the service is really quite exceptional in what by all outward appearances seems to be utter chaos. And the prices are VERY reasonable. Six of  us ate, and ate well, for $165. Oh, and throw a couple of glasses of wine, iced tea, etc. into the fold. This is obviously a very trendy restaurant at the moment, though rightfully so. It deserves it. My one and only complaint... the noise! I almost knocked the rating down a star for the noise level at Firefly. Too loud! But in reality, I complain about the noise mostly because I'm getting old. If I were younger I wouldn't have even noticed it. Hell, I'd be right there creating it with the rest of them!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for years!  Love the service and the food.  Order the bacon wrapped dates and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"These chain of restaurants have the best service that you can get in Vegas, it is genuine and warm. I've worked for the industry in Vegas for almost 3 years and it is so refreshing to find servers and service of these quality. Going to firefly, we are helping our local community by investing more in our local business. It is a versatile place to dine out, either for a date, friends, or even family reunion. I am latina and firefly is THE only place in vegas that offers a tasteful place to enjoy latin american culture. I hate to hear people bad-mouthing these great restaurants, but plz keep in my these are ignorant people. Before any out there start pointing fingers, check your own kitchen and how you prepare you on own food, there are more chances that you will get food poison in your own kitchen, than in Firefly. Media is just taking advantange that Firefly is a place loved by locals and they are just making money out bad publicity. I can speak for my friends n myself that i will go back to firefly as much as I always do ( which is twice a week, every week) no matter what. Thanks again and please support our local business"}
{"text":"Outstanding!   We have eaten here many times for dinner and love it so much we wanted to have our wedding party here!  Everything was perfect for our group of 25.  Ragina is an excellent coordinator and Manuel and Fernanda were outstanding in taking care of us.  From beginning to end...we couldn't be happier.   Thank you Thank you!"}
{"text":"Been here about 6 or 7 times in the last 12 months. Unfortunately it's been slowly getting worse every time I go. The last time was the worse. The food was cold/lukewarm the drinks watered down and we were basically told it that's the way the dish/drink is prepared. Even though its something I'd ordered many times. The rest of my party had been there independently of me and felt the same way some stating this would be the last time. The service was not at fault and she did remove an item from my bill I could not eat. But the food quality unfortunately as not as great as it once was."}
{"text":"Great place to sit down enjoy the food, drinks and good company. 
Restaurant has a great atmosphere, loud music and it is always busy. I would not recommend this place to someone who is looking for a quiet ,chill place.
Menu has lots of good options, I wanted to try everything. 
I recommend getting the sangria pitcher ( we had red),Delicious!
Also the dessert platter is a good option if u cant decide on a desert. Tres leches cake was my favorite.
It is a perfect place to go to before going out, it will get you in a good mood :-)"}
{"text":"This is the second time I've been to Firefly, and they were both events where they had an open bar and also a series of appetizers that I have to say leaving you very full and satisfied."}
{"text":"A M A Z I N G ! 
Food was great! Service was stellar! The view of freemont st left nothing more to ask for!"}
{"text":"Great spot just off the strip for dinner.  The place was packed on a Tuesday night and the energy was great.  Here's a quick breakdown of the food:

- Stuffed dates are a must.  By far the best dish we tried
- Mac and cheese is good but there was a layer of cheese on top that was too thick
- Albondigas were decent
- White sangria was outstanding.  Must order a pitcher of this!

Prices are great compared to most Tapas places and the atmosphere is fun.  I'm definitely going back soon."}
{"text":"Great restaurant good food good service the only problem is it was very loud in there
For those who never been to a Tapas Bar don't order more than three tapas Per person three tapas is a lot of food we ordered five tapas for two of us and chicken and mushroom paella but we couldn't eat the paella as we were already full oh one more thing there is not enough parking in the so you have to go to the back and it's a long walk."}
{"text":"We recently had our wedding rehearsal dinner at Firefly.  We were seated in the private room in the back.  Everything about the dinner was fantastic.  The food was exquisite, the drinks were phenomenal (love the sangria), the service was outstanding (thanks Michael), and the setup was great.  We can't say enough nice things about this place.  Everyone kept commenting on how unique it was to have our rehearsal dinner there.  All the food was so delicious, but I particularly liked the chicken salad and my wife loved the ham and cheese croquettes.  But really, you can't go wrong with any of the food there.  Also, the coordinator Tiffany was very helpful and answered all the questions I had.  I really recommend this place if you're looking for a unique and fun venue for your wedding rehearsal dinner."}
{"text":"This was by far the worst dining experience I've ever had. The 45 minute wait to be seated to eat didnt bother me until I understood why. We (a group or five people-average) saw our waiter maybe two times while we were seated. The waiter was so unorganized he skipped taking my wife's order and she had to wait until the food that was previously ordered was all gone to place her order (with the missing waiter). After my wife received her order and she finished eating, we then had to wait well over 20 minutes for the check. We all walked out assuming the check was paid, but to my surprise it wasn't, they chased me down in the parking lot and the first thing that was said out of the servers mouth was, \"I'm going to call the police if you dont give me your ID\", what happened to \"Sir, I'm sorry but the check was not paid\". I spoke to the manager about the lack there of attention of his server, and his response was, \"oh\".
For a restaurant with so many positive reviews, I find it hard to believe that we were the lucky or unlucky people to enjoy the wonderful food and experience (based on other reviews on yelp) the Las Vegas Firefly.

As far as the food, I was sick shortly after leaving this location; but next time if I want to wait in line and be sick after eating I'll venture to the the Mc Donald's at the local Walmart for fried food."}
{"text":"Filet sliders - good
Tomato soup & Brie sandwhich - meh
Surf & Turf (shrimp, chorizo & tomato) covered in a salsa verse - excellente"}
{"text":"horrible not tolerable waiting period.

The waiter selects and profiles who he will handle first.

We came in and sat down. The waiter never not once came to me but
Took care of TWO other older customers that were seated AFTER me. They
were next to me.

Waitresses have prissy attitude problems that owner
should be aware of.

We just got up and left."}

{"text":"I can't believe that before this weekend I have never been here. The food.... is AMAZING. Everything has so much flavor and just melts right in your mouth. We ordered so much food and there was not one thing we didn't like! 

We were a party of 12 with no reservations but were seated within 20 minutes. Staff was friendly. The vibe was amazing. Would definitely come back and recommend to everyone!"}
{"text":"We went a a month ago to celebrate my partner's birthday. Carlos was our server and he was extremely professional and polite and made our experience very pleasant and enjoyable! The manager came by to check on us and after we gushed about Carlos he gave the table a round of shots!"}

{"text":"We live in a BIG little town. To be able to go to a bar/restaurant that attracts so many tourists and still be able to call it your local, speaks volumes. The food is fantastic and the drinks are not easily matched- anywhere else in this town. 
Let's talk about the staff: Where to begin- Omar,Danny, Daniel and Mariano - they all bring a little  something different to the table.  I cannot pick a favorite because they're all so GREAT! Danny makes a mean cucumber Bloody Mary - Omar is famous for his fun personality and mixology skills. ( this guy will make you a GREAT drink ) Mariano - ( Dimples ) and Danny of course .. you're all fantastic! 

Don't miss a trip here!"}
{"text":"The tapas here are to die for.  We love the variety and the different flavors they have to offer.  The scallops and tuna tare tare were our favorites.  We had the paella which was great, but would have preferred to not order it as it was so filling we didn't have any room for more tapas.  We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I love coming here for their amazing martinis and their tasty chicken dishes but one thing I don't like is sometimes I have to wait for a table for a very long time"}
{"text":"I would drink of their blood orange mojitos every day if I could.  This is a favorite happy hour spot.  The tapas are good and the drinks are delicious.  Very good array of tapas and this location has a fun, hip atmosphere.

The drinks are moderately priced and the service is usually pretty fast."}
{"text":"Firefly never disappoints! Great food (stuffed dates, apple manchago salad and of course sangria are always a must-order) and even their olive and bread starter has that delicious sweet/tangy butter. Great for a first date or friends from work! Love the decor and the ambiance.  Service could be better, a couple times I've gone I felt like I waited forever for the server to come and ask if we wanted to order anything else.  And aside from all the negative comments and health history, I've always found Firefly to be delicious and I have full faith that they revamped their standards!"}
{"text":"Came here with my family on a Wednesday night. There is a couple parking spaces available in the front, and more in the back of the restaurant as well.

Atmosphere - The atmosphere is really nice. Modern decor and dim lighting. 

Service - We were greeted promptly and were seated within a couple of minutes. The servers were friendly and came by every so often to refill our waters and ask how the food was.

Food - Oh my god. Everything was so on point. We ordered a lot of food, but my favorites would have to be the Babyback ribs and the Apple and manchego salad. The salad was delicious; it had just the right amount of dressing to counter the sweetness of the apples. The ribs were also amazing! The meat was cooked perfectly and the sauce was drool-worthy. Everything was perfect. The portions are decently sized, allowing you to order a variety of tapas to try. And just to add on, the mixed paella was just as tasty. There was a perfect proportion of seafood, chicken, and rice. The flavors were incredible.
I would highly recommend this place. Yum yum yum!"}
{"text":"After reading such good reviews on Yelp, my husband and I came here on Saturday night. What impressed us was that we arrived at probably the busiest time with no reservation, and had a minimal wait for a table. The mango mojito was definitely something I would have again, and the food was, as the other reviewers stated, very good. Not in my top ten, but I could see myself coming back and bringing friends. 

We ordered the ham & cheese croquettes, ahi tuna tartare, filet mignon sliders, crispy duck rolls w/ cherry sauce, and the dessert plate...no complaints, but next time we will probably order something different off of their expansive menu. 

Some cons - It was very dark inside, to the point that I thought my ahi tuna was tomatoes because I couldn't see. It was very very loud, but I guess that's expected at prime time on a Saturday. There was almost too many servers for the relatively small restaurant. We had a few different people come to our table, and had a hard time remembering who was our actual waiter, and who was just a busser."}
{"text":"Came here for Sunday brunch solo at 10:00 a.m., and sat at the bar. This place never disappoints.  Had the bottomless drinks, including the white sangria, red sangria,  and mimosa.  Your best bet is the red.  Also enjoyed the chilaquiles, carne asada breakfast taco, French toast, bacon and banana beignets.  So delicious!  The bartender was so gracious and attentive.  I've been here for dinner too.  Love Firefly!!!! Felt like I was in España having tapas."}
{"text":"Saba Man and I stopped in here while on a recent visit to Las Vegas.  The. Best. 

Small plates that don't disappoint;  boasts international flavors along with more familiar fare. 

A short distance off the strip but well worth it.

{"text":"Happy birthday to me! Came out with my roommates for some drinks and tapas. This place is on point with drinks and tapas. I will continue this after meal."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews posted by others here I am a little surprised.
I am starting to loose faith in peoples tastes.
I was here on Saturday 7-21 and we had 4 plates.
Beet salad
Smoked Salmon toast
Squid 
Pallea
I will not try and dazzle you with crap I hear the panel on Iron chef use to describe what they are eating, just the truth from me.

What is the big fuss?  I didnt find anythingt to be out of this world.  
The Salmon toast was by far the best thing we had.
Beet salad next was good.  Dressing was light greens were fresh big pieces of beet so all in all was a good salad.
Squid was ok.  It was tender, not chewy and had good flavor.
The pallea.  Well I dont know what the others were eating but it wasnt what I had.   Way way way to salty.  The flavor of the shrimp, squid and mussles were all to weak to fight against the power of the salt.  The sausage was the culprit!!  Rice seamed to be a bit over cooked as well.

If this is secert spot for some your secret is safe with me.   If I went back there it would only be to have one of there excellent mojitos.  I had the blood orange and it was very well prepared.

I give it 3 stars for the drinks.  If it based off the food then it is a 1.5 stars.
I dont rate a place by parking ease, or wait time but considering we had no wait and parking right up front."}
{"text":"Loved this place. Visited Vegas and had some plans at red rocks that took me away from the trip. I thought for sure the dinning would be mediocre out of the drag. Wrong! This place is one of my favorite restaurants. The ambiance felt like a lounge, with just the right amount of comfort mixed with attitude. Service was stellar. Padron peppers, lamb rack were tasty. Octopus on the menu? Awesome."}
{"text":"The first time we ate here on vacation, we had the stuffed dates, warm spinach salad, chicken and chorizo stuffed mushrooms and Tierra y mar skewers. Everything was perfectly cooked. The filet mignon was cooked perfectly. The stuffed dates in the wine reduction are a must! The warm salad was amazing! We were not big on the chicken and chorizo stuffed mushrooms. It was hit and miss on whether or not there was enough stuffing in the mix. 

We loved it so much we came a second time and ordered all the same dishes except we had lamb instead of the stuffed mushrooms and we ordered TWO of the stuffed dates (so friggin good!). The lamb was the first dish we had that we were not impressed with. We love lamb and eat a lot of it. This was tough and lacking flavor. The lentils that come with it were great though. The cook on the Tierra y mar the second time was off too. One of the shrimp tasted raw. Meat was tougher. I think it is probably different chefs on different nights? We were not as thrilled the second night."}
{"text":"Loved the Sangria and lots of tapas untill our Paella arrived. Great service, no dissapointments there."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant and attentive staff. But watch out, this is a hot spot! You'll have to wait for a table. Don't worry, it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Favorites were goat cheese with sauce and melt in your mouth chicken tinga empanadas! My husband had the blood orange mojito which was a bit on the sour side for me but he enjoyed it. He ordered the filet mignon which he devoured!"}
{"text":"Wanted to try something different and avoid the overpriced touristy restaurants of the Strip.  This place fit the bill.  The food was excellent - so many different choices which was great because two in our party were vegetarian.  We did not have one thing that we did not enjoy.

My husband and I loved the Bacon Wrapped Dates and the Steak and Mushroom Skewers.  Our friends loved the Empanadas and Manchego Mac and Cheese.  We had a bunch of other stuff too - seemed like the plates just kept coming and coming!  

We shared two pitchers of Sangria - delicious and just enough to get the warm fuzzies without being over the top.  

The service was excellent and food came out promptly and at good intervals so we were never without tapas on the table...but never overwhelmed with too many plates at a time.  Just a great experience.  We will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Place is great, food is awesome! Great service ! Don't listen to the bad reviews from long ago! This place is awesome"}
{"text":"Customer service, food and drinks are always excellent. Every time we visit Las Vegas we make it a point to have dinner here. We recommend it to everyone that visits Las Vegas. My husband is very picky when it comes to everything and he always walks out raving about this place so I know they are doing things right here. This place is so good he signed up for a Yelp account so he personally can give it 5 stars (very unlike him)."}

It was very very loud, which I wasn't quite expecting because I was told it would be a nice intimate place to get wine and apps. But there were bachelorette parties and a lot of college kids (not too far from UNLV) making the place really...REALLY...loud. I guess I wasn't expecting this place in a nice little strip mall (next too a few other upscale places like Ruth Chris' Steak House) to be so much like a bar.

There was also almost too many servers for the relatively small restaurant. We had a few different people come to our table, and had a hard time remembering who was our actual waiter, and who was just a busser. 

It's not too too expensive either, so that's nice.

We may go back eventually, but maybe during a less busy time."}
{"text":"Probably one of the greatest secrets in Vegas! I took 16 people to this restaurant it's off the charts. The food is unbelievable, the service Exquisite, the prices so affordable, and the atmosphere sexy and exotic. We loved it every single one of us you have to go to Firefly on Paradise because you'll go back every time and we are from Colorado and California."}
{"text":"We visited Firefly on Paradise last week for lunch. We ordered paella [saffron rice, clams, shrimp, calamari, chicken, Spanish chorizo sausage], Pulpo asado [marinated and grilled octopus, potato, tomato], and Terra y Mare skewers [grilled shrimp, filet mignon, chorizo sausage, salsa verde]. They all tasted good, except that we are not fond of pulpo asado as much. In general we like the food and the service was great. Everyone there was courteous and polite, and make you feel very comfortable and make the meal more enjoyable that way. We like it here for a casual lunch. =)"}
{"text":"My first birthday in Vegas since I went to college and turned the legal age of 21 and I'm clueless on how to celebrate. Zero. Zip. Nada. My friend in L.A. randomly chose and hell, why not try something new?

It made my birthday even better.

Whether they're hot or cold, their tapas are graciously portioned and reasonably priced. The Firefly fries are such a tongue twister to say, but simply delicious and full of crispy, parmesan-covered potato goodness. I'm also a fan of the mushroom tart, mac and cheese, and the bread. Oh, the bread with its honey chipotle butter or whatever that is. Just keep it coming!

Their watermelon mojito was just balanced and refreshing. I didn't quite like the pomegranate drink with the lillet blanc, and it's precisely because of the aperitif wine that was mixed in. Just haven't acquired a taste for wine yet, so don't let my opinion sway you against ordering it.

For a Friday night, the place was packed, but the service was excellent and the dishes came out in a timely manner. They're definitely on top of their game. Parking can definitely be an issue, so try and carpool if possible. No reservations on Fridays and Saturdays, but hey, more reason to come early for their happy hour right?

Now that I've got a new go-to place, I absolutely would love to try out more of their menu and grab a drink with coworkers or spend a night out with the girls."}
{"text":"I love the variety of food choices here. Great atmosphere, location, pricing, and the staff is always professional. You can go dressed up after a show or dressed down from running errands. It's appealing to all walks of life."}
{"text":"In a town where people want to rip you off... Firefly consistently undercharges and overdelivers.  Just go.  Don't think twice.  It's a super super awesome good time."}
{"text":"If I want to have a get together with my friends this is usually the place I think of. Service is great, so is the food and drinks. My fav. things on the menu are spicy beef salad, firefly fries, camarones a la diabla, sangria, and there mojitos!!!"}
{"text":"Having heard great reviews, we decided to check it out for ourselves with another couple. I was not impressed. The food was...eh, ok. Nothing to rave about. The portion sizes were not that impressive for tapas and they did not have a lot of vegetarian/vegan options, which I always look for in a restaurant. Their sangria was pretty good and our waiter was helpful. Overall, an ok experience, but we haven't been back and don't think we will return. There are better options out there."}
{"text":"LOVED this place. We got amazing tapas in a lovely setting for a great price with great service. The tuna tartare was outstanding. Definitely get the bacon wrapped dates, and the pork empanadas were to die for. Great ambiance, easy parking, really nice servers. I would recommend making reservations, especially if you're going on a Saturday night as we did. They utilize Open Table for online reservations, so it's super easy. I really wish this place had a location in my city."}

{"text":"I made a Yelp account just so I could review this place. I think the food was AMAZING! This place is definitely one of my favorite parts of Las Vegas.

I had the Veggie Empanadas, Apple Manchengo Salad and the Tomato Basil Soup and they were all delicious. I also tried my friends' stuffed peppers, veggies and lentils and fish sticks and lentils, and they all tasted so, so good. My favorite dish was probably the Veggie Empanadas, but I loved them all.

The service was really good too. The servers came by our table very frequently to make sure everything was going okay. Ours even split our check for us and cracked a few jokes as we ate. The atmosphere was also nice. Good music, dim lighting with candles scattered about, friendly people, a bar, etc. It was all nice.

Upon leaving the restaurant, my friends and I made a pact. We will one day eat at Firefly again. Whether or not we visit the Vegas strip again is still uncertain...but we will go to Firefly.

If you're in town, you MUST check out Firefly. I loved it! :)"}
{"text":"My parents and I dined at Firefly over labor day weekend. We called to make a reservation, but learned they do not take reservations on weekends. We decided we better arrive early so we wouldn't have to wait. We showed up right at 5 and were seated immediately, but by 6 the restaurant was full! 
The three of us split the following menu items: Artichoke Toasts, Stuffed Dates, Roasted Eggplant Cannoli, Pork Empanadas, Shrimp Tempura, Filet Mignon Sliders, Passion Fruit Cheesecake, Gelato, and Caramel Flan. 
We loved everything! Our favorite item was the Stuffed Dates, definitely give those a try! My parents enjoyed the Sangria and I had a delicious cappuccino (it's ok if it's after 10am in the states, right?). The service was wonderful and fast, and our waiter was very informative. The prices are very reasonable. I would return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Service was very friendly. It was our first time at a tapas restaurant and decided to try it for my 20th birthday. Our busser, nick was so entertaining and personable. He made us smile every time he came to the table. he even got us a complimentary flan with a lit candle. For the occasion. He definitely made my night!"}
{"text":"It hadn't impressed me. Its good, thats all. Its more appetizers than main dishes, and the plates didnt come together, my boyfriend was done before I even started."}

4.  End result is a one happy ass Latino man and the best tapas he's had to date."}
{"text":"try the wrapped dates!! sooooooo good. a bit pricey, but worth it."}
{"text":"Loved the small plate concept. 
Stuffed Peppers, filet-sausage skewers, basically everything was great. All the desserts were great as well. We had fun sharing everything and trying a little of everything. Mario gave us great service."}
{"text":"Aaaammmmmazing as always.. not sure how many times I can update my review but I'm back.. lol.. I have been here at least 8 times now & their is only one thing that I tried that I didn't like... the ribs.. everything else is something special.. Just recently tried the apple & manchego salad.. yum.. also tried their infused vodka, yummy! lamb was good but a little overcooked & fatty. This last time we tried their desserts for the first time.. We got the sample platter & everything was good. nothing over the top like there food though. cna't wait to go back again :)"}
{"text":"Amazing!  A great experience. Food and service were exceptional.  Do yourself a favor and skip the overly priced Chef themed restaurants on the strip and get to Firefly.  Order anything that sounds good and you will love it!  Shrimp diablo, apple salad, petite filet, scallops, bacon wrapped dates all phenomenal!  The only thing that was just ok was the pork empanda.  Had sangria and flan for dessert.  Great.  Love this place.  Will be back."}
{"text":"Nahum , Gabriel nd Marco are amazing at the firefly restaurant ! We had a bachelorette party here for lunch nd the tapas were great . The sangria will get your party started and the great service will make your day ! Love it !"}
{"text":"My husband and I just went there for lunch today and it was extremely disappointing. We ordered a veggie paella because we missed the paella we tried there couple years ago. So after 40 mins passed, the paella came with so little rice, and it was really more like a stir fried veggie instead of paella. Paella is a rice dish, there should have been a reasonable amount of rice but there was really not much rice! I remember they gave more than that years ago. And I have eaten paella in various restaurants, so I know how a paella should be. The paella today at Firefly was absolutely ridiculous. It was like a stir fried veggie with little rice sprinkled on it and then stirred together. We felt totally cheated. We didn't send it back because we didn't want to wait another 40 mins. And we totally lost faith in this place so we didn't bother to ask them for making a new one or ordering some other tapas instead. I ended up not touching the paella after 2 bites, and my husband ate the whole thing; he was able to finish it by himself because there was hardly any rice to make him full. the menu said paella is meant for 2-4 people, so u can imagine how little rice there was when my husband could finish it by himself! Compared with the paella we got there years ago, we couldn't finish the whole thing together years ago, while my husband can finish the sorry pathetic \"paella\" today by himself. It was really jacked up and we got out of there as soon as my husband finished it, and now we are sitting in another restaurant to get fed. We will not go back to Firefly again, it was not like what we had years ago. I never see any paella with so little rice in it in my whole life! Totally not an honest business. $20 for a stir fried veggie looking paella was totally wrong!"}
{"text":"So I finally got to go to this Firefly on Sahara.  The setting was nice but not as spanishy outdoor-esque like the one on Paradise.  But nontheless, it was somewhere new to try.  So we first ordered what else...Red Sangria, not as tasty but a little stronger than Paradise some might like that I did not...So here comes the bread and sweet almond butter...Yum can't get enough I even like the olives.

First order...Thai beef salad...umm portion was wayyyy smaller here and I needed a little more sauce, I liked the fact that they sprinkled red pepper flakes here but I will just ask them to do it on Paradise. Tierra y mar...filet mignon skewer with shrimp and sausage with salsa verde sauce.  Sauce was better at Paradise.  BBQ ribs, I don't care for it at all but my hubby tored it up!! I can tell you that this place is good.  We always end up sitting at the bar and eat at the bar, we don't mind.  Bartenders are always nice and helpful. But I rather go to the Paradise location for better food and more of it."}
{"text":"Food is amazing, even the bread! Order the shrimp diablo, bacon wrapped dates, chicken & chorizo stuffed mushrooms, and I can't forget the patatas bravas!!! I eat this every time I visit. It's a must each time I'm in Vegas!!!!"}
{"text":"Its nice to have firefly on my side of town.  As I stated on my last review I wish they updated the menu making it exciting to see a few new options every once in a while."}
{"text":"Great night spot if you don't mind waiting for a table or standing at the bar.  The tap pas are great although they don't update the menu very often which is a bummer.  My go to dishes are the stuffed dates and Mac & Cheese.  You really cant go wrong with anything on the menu."}
{"text":"With their reasonable price, friendly waitress and tasty food. What can I say? It's a must-go!! If you are not a buffet fan and want to try out Spanish cuisine, it's a nice choice to try. We had stuffed pepper and seafood rice(sorry, forget the name on menu). They were way better than we expected. Absolutely want to go back and try something else. A place to get relaxed with friends enjoying nice food."}
{"text":"I wouldn't go back. I don't mind overspending when the service is really good but service for me was way below average. Don't even think about ordering a steak if you happen to love steak sauce because they don't have any. I'm not sure the scallops were in fact scallops. $11 dollars for 6 small white squishy flimsy somethings but I'm not sure what."}
{"text":"This place used to good not sure what happened. Lamb chops were flavorless, soup was bland, and the service was terrible. Gazpacho was the worst! Barely ate anything we ordered. Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"It would be 6 stars if it was available.  Ivan served us today, and was excellent, courteous and fast.  The food is always perfect and Firefily* has the best Sangria on the planet."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of 11 girls for my cousins Bachelorette; Food and service is amazing!! Loved it can't wait to come back to vegas to eat here again!"}
{"text":"i live in vegas and this restaurant is one of my favorite places.
for tourists, if you wanna jus chill and hang away from the strip, this is the perfect place. their sangrias (both red & white kinds) are Bomb! 
it's a tapas joint, so many varieties of different kinds of foods (not just spanish food either) but they have mini burgers, beef tenderloin skewers, ribs, veggie dishes, and of course desserts (my favorite is this banana one that you can dip into hazelnut chocolate) 
anyways, long story short, great drinks and food at an affordable price, so def check it out!"}
{"text":"I go here every time I come to Vegas. It's a great local spot without all the annoying drunk tourists. Unbelievable service and food. 

I highly recommend the stuffed dates. Sweet dates stuffed with Bleu cheese and wrapped in bacon.

The shrimp ceviche is amazing. Good portion, too. 

Get the clams with chorizo. So good!"}
{"text":"Firefly is my go-to place! I love the stuffed dates, apple cheese salad, and the chicken skewers. The food is consistent and the delicious bread and almond butter is always complimentary. 

I don't, however, recommend the paella because it is more like a risotto than paella. The flavor is good, but the texture is not what you would expect with paella. Maybe they are just rushed the day I had it. 

Prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"Best service! Drinks are never empty as their very aware of your experience. It is very clean, the servers are very hospitable and has a fun atmosphere. I recommend a pitcher of red sangria!!!! I always get the tres leches cake. No else can make it this good! The bacon wrapped dates are a must!!! I honestly love their new location as it's much roomier and more fun place to visit. Thanks Firefly!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. I've been there at least a dozen times and have never had a bad thing to say.

The food is delicious, the service is great, the atmosphere is fun and relaxed, and the kitchen is fast. What more could you want?

You can go in and order basically anything on the menu at random and it will all be good. Everything is fresh and well-seasoned and the food combinations are clever. Stuffed dates with bacon? Brilliant!

The servers are attentive, they get your order right, and they seem to always be there when you need them. As an added bonus, they are cheerful and pleasant and make you feel welcome.

The kitchen is also fast. Your food will start coming out soon after you order, so you are not sitting, miserably, waiting for food to come. 

The wait to be seated can get long on Friday and Saturday nights, but they are efficient and pretty good about getting you a seat as soon as they can."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic as a couple or in a bigger group.  Great tapas, great menu of either adventurous or more standard choices.  Reasonably priced.   Suggest you order a couple and then keep adding on because you get full pretty fast.   With so many new and different dining choices in Vegas I always tell myself to try someplace new, but every trip I find myself back here.  Never disappoints."}
{"text":"Firefly made my wedding meet and greet amazing!! Carlos, Lalo, Jesus, and Gabriel made sure we had everything we needed!! The food was awesome and the drinks were even better!! Make sure you check out the bigger and better Firefly on Paradise!!!!"}
{"text":"Total redemption from the management team at Firefly.  Thank you Tabitha for reaching out.  Last night was no less than perfect service from Irina and staff.  I also tried the beet salad and the lamb chops with lentils which by the way is now one of my favorite dishes.  Thank you again for providing a great atmosphere and delicious dishes!"}
{"text":"Felt like having tapas and had read good things about Firefly.  Thought we'd give it a try.  

We had used open table to make reservations and when I checked in with the hostess she said \"for Jen?\"  Yup, that's me.  Thought that was nice. They asked us to sit and wait for a bit because the people prior to us hadn't left our table yet.  After about 5 mins the decided to sit us elsewhere which I thought was nice.

The food was very very good. The average price I would say is about $6 per plate.  Some are $7, some $10, some $4. We had 7 different plates and the dates and the lobster escargot were the fav's at the table.  I had the Red Sangria which had a flavor that I wasn't expecting and I didn't care for it.  I ordered the White Sangria instead and sadly, still didn't like it. Of course I cannot let alcohol go to waste so I drank it anyway!  We also ordered the Padron Peppers.  I love these peppers and they say that 1 in every 100 actually contains some heat.  It must have been my lucky day; I should have hit the casinos.  The ones I was lucky enough to choose were friggin' hot!  Hot as in burning my mouth and getting the hiccups level of hot. Getting the hiccups while at a nice restaurant is something I would like to avoid going forward. One person at our table loves super hot anything and she loved them!  I did like them and which I could have had more but I just couldn't do that do my mouth anymore.  

I deducted one star because of the sangria.  The server was great, food was wonderful, decor very contemporary.  Would definitely go back.  Total bill for 3 people including tip was $112."}
{"text":"Grwat food. Love it. They have the best food in town. If you come to vegas stop in abd dine in"}
{"text":"Firefly is an AMAZING place to eat and drink.  Service is always amazing and our server today, Patrick, was crazy good.  Come by and see him at the bar for some delicious mojitos and good conversation.  Try the Chorizo stuffed mushrooms, steamed mussels and Passion Fruit mojitos. Freaking bomb!"}
{"text":"I recently went to Firefy due to a friends recommendation. The food was amazing, the atmosphere rocked and my waiter was really knowledgeable about the menu plus really attentive. Every time we needed a refill on a drink or a napkin he was right there. On my next visit to Vegas I will definitely go again."}
{"text":"It was very crowded and we had to wait about 30 minutes for a table. I take that as a good thing it means people love it there and are willing to wait for a table. Go grab a drink at the bar while you wait. Mojitos are very good. The food itself was very good! Do yourself a favor and get the baby back ribs!!!!  My only real complaint was that the table it not nearly big enough for the drinks and numerous plates they bring but again when you taste the food the wait, crowd, and over stuffed table are small potatoes. 

Lastly, as a DIE HARD Foo fan... They have taken the classic FF logo and made their own firefly shirts. Very clever!"}
{"text":"One of the best stops off the strip in Vegas! A must stop for amazing food, quick and awesome servers."}
{"text":"Love this place! Lots of flavor and tapas options. Every time I have gone it hasn't been super busy so there is no wait. A fun place to socialize with friends and try new things but each item you try definitely adds up so be aware when you are ordering that your bill may be larger than expected."}
{"text":"Food was very good, service was non-existant.  We waited for 20 minutes after dinner to get coffee and we waited for 30 minutes for the check.  If we had service, it would have been 5 stars."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat! Everything here is so delicious! The long wait and the loud noisy atmosphere is definitely worth it! The stuffed dates are absolutely amazing (and I can't stand bleu cheese!). The Serrano ham and cheeses, Thai beef salad, Ahi Tuna skewers and dessert sampler is a must! Friends, family, dates, this place is perfect for everyone!"}
{"text":"The ambience was appealing. Whether you'd dine as a couple, in a group or solo, it has appeal for all. The prices were fair across the menu.
The service was ideal. Our waiter took the time to answer our questions about the unfamiliar dishes on the menu and he gave adequate suggestions based on our tastes and food familiarity.
We ordered all Tapas for meal. 6 different types, a couple that were house specialties. The white anchovies and stuffed dates. They were superb. A pitcher of White Sangria was tasty and accompanied all of our Tapas selections which included lamb, beef, veggies, seafood and chicken. Everything prepared had excellent eye appeal and flavor and each portion was comparable to the price. We shared each Tapa dish evenly. The warm bread kept coming. Because it was our wedding anniversary a wonderful flan was comped by our superb waiter.
We came home to L.A bragging to our friends and family about our new food spot in Las Vegas. We will surely return there."}
{"text":"I have been going to Firefly for years.  It was recommended to me first by a close friend that worked in the restaurant industry in Vegas as a locals place. I went to the original location one block away and since the move, have been to the new location a few times now.  I make it a point to visit this place each time I visit Vegas on business or pleasure.  I recommend this place to all my friends, family, and co-workers.

On my recent visit on 12/28/13, my family (4 of us total..kids were 10 and 14) enjoyed:

1) Red Sangria - Get a pitcher(s) of this stuff.  It is the nectar of the wine gods.  It is a perfect blend of sweet and tart on a hot or warm day and compliments all the dishes they have well.

2) Tapas Style - Since moving to the new larger location, they changed their menu and added more flare.  
  - Tomato-basil soup and grilled cheese is light, flavorful, and refreshing.
  - Shrimp ceviche is cool refreshing, seasoned well and balanced in flavor.
  - Stuffed Dates had a smoky bacon wrapped around a semi-sweet date with an almond inside.  It was a great combination of flavors and the crunch added a nice texture.
  - Firefly Fries are a large portion of garlic and parmesan goodness.
  - Manchego Mac 'n' Cheese was the kid's favorite.  Fresh and homemade with real cheeses.
  - Chicken Skewers was another kid's favorite.  There was a roasted garlic cream that added some good flavor to the chicken.
  - Serrano Sliders were really tasty and tender.  We added some of the onion straws it came with as a garnish in the slider to kick it up a notch.
  - Merguez...my wife doesn't like sausage but this lamb sausage was great.  Not very gamey but a good rich tasting meat complimented with red peppers.
  - Lamb Chops - It was like eating candy...it was lamb as it should be with a base of seasoning that brought out a slight pleasant sweetness.
  - Camarones a la Diabla - Shrimp in a spicy sweet sauce.  Hands down one of the best dishes there.  The sauce is so good...ask for extra bread for dipping.
  - Desserts for us consisted of our favorites...flan and tres leches cake.  The flan is traditionally made and the flavor of the custard has an almond taste to it...the tres leches cake is moist and sweet to eat.

3) Service - The servers, runners, and bussers were fantastic.  Our drinks were always filled, table was clutter free, and our server checked in at the right moments.  

4) Ambiance - The new location is much easier to get in and out of.  The décor and layout of the restaurant was very open and relaxing.

Overall...great job on the new location and new menu!"}
{"text":"Here's your two question quiz.... I know I didn't tell you to study. I'm sorry. I am an easy grader though. Here we go!

1)Firefly is....
A.) a delicious mouth watering tapas and sangria experience that you can't miss out on....

2) I would rather...

A.) GO to Firefly the delicious mouth watering tapas and sangria experience that you can't miss out on..

For question one if you answered  \"A\"  you are correct!
For question two if you answered \"A\" you are correct.!

See I told you this would be easy. You had nothing to worry about my little foodie scholars. Now, lets get down to business.

Firefly Tapas Kitchen and Bar is one of the hottest spots to eat in town. From their wide selection of hot & cold tapas to their delicious I repeat DELICIOUS sangria. 

Firefly is very family style. Not so much as in large meals as it is having everyone order two different tapas to pass around and share. So, my family and I ventured here the other night. 

We ordered ALOT. My goal was to be in  food coma by the end of the night. (mission accomplished)

I loved and adored the following menu items.

Smoke Salmon: This was such a delightful tapas. You really can't go wrong with this choice and I don't even like salmon.  It had a very fresh 
summery taste. Very Barefoot Contessa esque.

Ahi Tuna Skewer: Oh my lanta. We ordered 2 plates of these little guys. Mariniated  with mango, basil, mustard-ginger glaze, it is so good you may want to eat the skewer is came on... not that I tried. They are cooked rare, but you can't taste the rarity of the ahi tuna. The red wine reduction really completes the dish.

Stuffed Dates: Ay yi yi! This is possibly one of my favorite things to eat on Earth. The bacon-wrapped, smoked almonds, with a nice red wine reduction and stuffed with a bit of blue cheese.  This dish I recommend to hide when it comes to the table...most likely on your lap under your napkin. This isn't something you want to share.

Manchego Mac& Cheese- also may want to hide under
 your napkin.

Paella - They bring this puppy out in the pan. 
Saffron rice, clams, mussels, shrimp, calamari, chicken, Spanish chorizo sausage don't tell me you don't want to take  bite of that!
If you really don't want to take a bite of that...lie to me please. You'll hurt my feelings.

FIREFLY FRIES: This is one of their signature dishes. My favorite fries on the planet. Fries mixed with herbs and topped with Parmesan cheese. Then with the magical aioli (garlic mayonnaise) on the side?!? This is one of those things you eat and you cant stop saying mmmmm and mid chew looking at the person with you and saying \"THIS IS SO GOOD\" 

These dishes you cannot pass up. We ordered more however, none of them can compare to these 4. I'll leave it up to you to take your taste buds on an adventure different from mine..

Now for the GRAND FINALLY!  It is what you have all been waiting for.

SANGRIAAAAA

It is a crime not order  pitcher of Firefly Sangria. You can order Red, White, or Sparkling Sangria. We ordered all 3. Don't judge me. Sparkling is my absolute favorite. It is so light and airy while it trickles down your throat. You will just die and go to heaven with one or two glasses.
Fun Fact: They marinate the sangria's for three days before serving it. So you know you are getting the absolute best sangria in the city hands down. 

  My  Tips
1.) Try and go early on the weekends. Firefly is always busy but weekends are the worst. 
2.) Order the paella as soon as you can. It takes 45 min. to make, but well worth the wait.

So my time is up. I've got nothing left to say. Actually I always do. You know me to well. I'll leave you with this.... If you don't eat at firefly, you ain't livin doll. 

All my love...from my heart & belly."}
{"text":"This place was great (food/drinks/prices), our waiter was not so great. The lady who bussed our tables was AWESOME and took the time to tell us all her favorite things on the menu.

We happened to be there on latin night which was really cool, it was so packed there was nowhere to sit on the patio, but it was no big deal because we got a great view of the amazing dancer. 

Best shrimp tempura I have ever had! Will be coming back to try more items"}
{"text":"Great place to have tapas food just great I love there bacon dates and sangria  and calamari and like there new location."}
{"text":"Excellent tapas.  Went with my wife, and were unexpectedly surprised with the quality of the food and service.  The wait was a little long, but worth it in the end.  Would definitely recommend, whether you're a local, or a tourist tired of the buffets and casinos.  We were only two, so it was hard to sample everything - but we will be back for more!"}
{"text":"The other reviews were right on with the red sangria ($7), yummy!  Although I thought it was on the strong side, which is fine by me.

Smoked Salmon Toasts ($7)- raw salmon layered on top on wheat toast topped with dill dressing and capers.  Oh yeah, these were yummy.  This tapa seemed to provide the most bang for your buck.

Bacon wrapped dates($4-5)- You want to order these!  They were the best tapa we ordered.

Ham and Cheese Croquets ($5-6)- 3 fried little things that were the most unhealthy thing we ordered and were my least favorite.  Not very cheesy and did not have much ham in them.

Spicy Shrimp ($?)- Cooked to perfection and were not terribly spicy.

The waitstaff was very attentive.  Our waiter was able to split our check three ways with credit card, which was helpful.

I wouldn't recommend this type of dining to parties less than two.  It's family-style dining, so you would want to go with at least three people.  I'm not sure this place is for manly men, lol, being that the portions are small and aren't meal-like.  It's a great place for us ladies, though.

It is on the pricey side, about $20-30 a person."}
{"text":"Long wait, and service is good, depending on the waiter's mood. They have really good appetizers, and the mixed paella was worth the 40 min wait."}
{"text":"It was a very nice change from dining on the strip.There were a few menu items that i didnt care too much for like the stuffed dates and lamb sausage, but everything else was great. After eating the rest of the week at casino restaurants we were shocked that our meal with one sangria and dessert was under $50. 


Ask for a sample of the red and white sangria and the waiter will give you almost a free glass worth!"}
{"text":"Amazing! I am gluten free and have not had stuffed peppers since I started on the diet. There gluten free menu was very extensive and delicious! I ordered three different plates because I couldn't decide. I ate every bite! Awesome pricing...no complaints"}
{"text":"Great place to eat. Trend setter, just behind the casino's on the east side, I like to take my friends here to eat and drink and to have a good time."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Firefly.  This place was really, really great. I has a very nice atmosphere, great food, and the service was impeccable.  We had a large party, and they added the automatic gratuity; this is usually very annoying to me.  However in the case of Firefly, they earned it and I was happy to sign the bill.  I am a fan, you should certainly check them out when in LV."}
{"text":"Wow!  My new obsession is trying new cuisine, and was not sure what to expect.   

We tried a few things off the menu to maximize our experience.  The food was incredible!  So flavorful, the ambiance was just perfect, and the staff was wonderful.

We started with their signature appetizer of bread and almond spread.  Then followed with the following:  Stuffed Dates, Crispy Duck Roll, Chicken and Chorizo Stuffed Mushrooms, and finished with the Banana Nutella Dessert.  

I am sad that I live 3000 miles away, as this would be a weekly visit!   When in Vegas, check it out!  Recommended!"}
{"text":"It's the bomb and Alberto is the best! He is amazing! The food was great, clean restaurant and excellent service"}
{"text":"My wife and I enjoyed the atmosphere and the food.  Were were a bit surprised we had to wait over an hour for a table but sat at the bar and drank sangria until the table was ready. This place gets a good crowd.  I would give it a 5 star, but it was a bit on the rich and saucy side.  They must use a ton of butter and cream here. Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed the food.  We were stuffed and only spent about $30 on the food for the two of us.  Drinks added up a bit at $6 a pop for a sangria.  But it was still affordable overall. I would definitely go here again."}
{"text":"As good as it gets in Las Vegas....

If there is one item on the menu that I would highly recommend to anyone eating at the restaurant for the first time, it would be stuffed dates. The plate consisted of dates wrapped in bacon in a pool of smoked almond, red wine reduction and topped with blue cheese. What an interesting combination, but, boy were they MARVELOUS. You know the climactic moment of sex when your body quivers and eyes roll back. After one bite, you will have the same sensation. Trust! That good. Haha.... A+

Other tapas we tried:

Tuna Tartare - cubes of marinated ahi tuna, topped with avocado; taro chips on the side for slight contrast. My second favorite dish. They were not stingy as they served a hefty portion of ahi tuna. Fresh fish and crunchy taro chips were a perfect combination. A

Firefly Flies - cut fries sprinkled with parmesan cheese & fresh herbs, served with aioli sauce. Nothing to rave about. The aioli sauce had some kick to it. B

Thai Beef Salad - seared beef with all the works drizzled with thai dressing. Did not choose this dish. Beef was seared to perfection. Dressing had some zing to it. B

We had a couple other dishes that were delish. Cannot remember the names, though.

Besides the awesome food, we ordered a couple pitchers of their house brewed white sangria. At first, I did not like it. Then, the more I ate, the bitterness went away. The bits of sweet mango on the bottom of the pitcher neutralized the sharp/tartness of the drink. B+

The ambiance was loud and intimate. The lighting was dim and dark red (hence, Firefly). Decor was simple. B+

Service was stellar. Forgot his name, but, he was attentive and recommended in detail the best tapas on the menu. A-

Bottom Line:
My experience certainly exceeded expectations. The stuffed dates wrapped in bacon alone gives this restaurant an A in my book. Firefly will definitely be a regular stopover any time I visit Vegas."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place. The first time I went in was on a Sunday morning and I was there to sit at the bar and watch the games. There were only three other people at the bar and I asked them to watch a different game and the bartender said that the other people were watching these. They definitely were not watching any of the games, so we decided to leave.

A couple weeks later, we came back for lunch and the service was horrible. It took forever for our drinks to just get ordered. When we finally ordered the food, they didn't even tell us what they were putting on the table. As for the food...eh. This is pretty heavy tapas, so be ready for that.

There are a ton of better tapas places than this."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!  Colorful, Fun atmosphere!  Bacon wrapped Dates, amazing!  
Great place to take out of town company!  Not the standard chain place!"}
{"text":"The new location behind its old location is perfect! Still same spot basically with more room and better service. I love the tapas and the atmosphere and i have been goin to firefly for 6 years now. The food is always great and i leave there full and satisfied. And you get alot for what u pay for. The desserts also are so delicious. Enjoy"}
{"text":"The service was attentive and the wait was minimal.
Food was mostly very tasty and also very affordable.
Ambience very nice, but a little louder than one wants for a romantic evening.

The (red) sangria was a little sweet for my taste, and the octopus was very tender but oddly mealy. Other dishes were good -- the dates were as tasty as promised, and the merguez (lamb sausages with red pepper) were fantastic."}
{"text":"A nice tapas joint! That just happens to serve a pretty kick ass Sangria! 

When you walk into \"Firefly\", it's kinda of dark and pretty unassuming! Till you get a nice table out on the patio! Now, this is just perfect to people watch and act a fool, or behave, which ever your looking for...all while drinking Sangria's!

The food is an unassuming mix of the new and old. One standout for me was the sliders they have available! The Calamari is something you can pass on, but everything else is up to par with the taste and pricing of a place like this. 

4*'s for the drinks and vibe, not quite 5, because the food is ok, no WOW factor! Maybe I'm too critical? 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"One night in Vegas  so we wanted our choice to be perfect. We really love tapas and Firefly was close but more importantly yelp reviews were compelling. Went in with high expectations and boy we were not disappointed! The padron peppers were delicately fried (no hint of greasiness!) and piping hot. Some peppers were spicier than the others so order them if you like spicy. Our server was so pleasant and welcoming! He recommended several dishes , one of them the Camerones Diabla which was beyond delicious with the most complex sauce that was finger licking good. The refreshing artichoke toasts with a tasty aioli and the white anchovies with avocado were second to none and great palette cleansers because both are topped generously with fresh, chopped basil. Lastly, we ordered the eggplant cannelloni - 3 delicately rolled eggplant stuffed with airy goat cheese mixture - wow! We ended with the cherry bread pudding with port reduction and ice cream...it was beautifully plated . It was a feast for all the senses.  Oh, don't forget the sangria- we had the red and it was so flavorful with a perfect balance of alcohol and sweetness. 
I wish we had another night because we would go back to try more tapas that we could not devour tonight. We have been fortunate to dine in some great places and when you come across friendly and attentive staff...neat setting...and food you would pay double for in other cities..Firefly is your kind of place! We look forward to an encore in the near future!!!!"}
{"text":"Dates wrapped with bacon. And lamb chops. 

Heavenly and I would go there everyday if I could. 

The bartender was super nice and polite."}
{"text":"Truly outstanding! I liked it so much I went back two days later. Just down the street from the convention center, so skip the blah convention food and go here. The portions are generous, and the food is wonderful. Not to be missed are the stuffed dates, spicy shrimp, apple salad, and filet mignon. The bread comes with spicy butter that is amazing. The sangria is tasty too. The service is great as is the ambiance. It's a little noisy but it feels festive there. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We asked for a quiet area for our business dinner and got it. What a fabulous meal! The food was exceptional and affordable. Scallops were perfect, dates were delicious, lamb was exceptional - I highly recommend."}
{"text":"LOve this Place forTapas, Drinks, & the First date... Sometimes a bit too loud for first date but very comfortable atmosphere . Not too Pricie  $$ is Fair"}
{"text":"Fantastic food, cool non-strip atmosphere (dark, red room), and cheapie-cheap!  I have been pretty blown away all three times I've eaten here.  For the price, tapas doesn't get much better than this.

You MUST try:

Stuffed dates
Lamb chops in red-wine reduction with sauteed lentils (yummy!!!)
Grilled octopus (pulpo asado)
Filet mignon sliders

But everything was really tasty.  Pitchers of Sangria or Mojitos are a bargain for a group.  They're both a little too sweet for my taste, but I hardly notice since I can't be torn away from my food.  

There's also a happening scene on the patio at night."}
{"text":"Deliciouso! Yummo! Tasty! 

Yep, this pretty much described my experience with the tapas here. It was so good, I actually came out here twice while in Vegas. First off, service was great (they greeted and seated you quick, food came out fast, and servers were pleasant). I loved that I never had to wait on service or the check. Now, onto what we ordered:

Food:
Tomato basil soup with mini grilled brie sandwich
Stuffed dates (sooooo tasty!)
Stuffed peppers
Baked tetila (sorta like cheese fondue)
Manchego mac&cheese
Terra Y Mare skewers
Crispy duck rolls
Steamed mussels

Drinks:
Red & Wine sangria (which they marinate for 3 days!)

For dessert, we had the cheese plate (first time) and second time the caramel flan. The cheese plate was $10 and I finished that with a nice cup of coffee which was surprisingly very good. I don't know why  surprisingly, but yes, even the coffee was very good! The cheese plate was a great dessert, best way to finish our palates and dinner. It came with apples, figs, 3 types of cheese, bread, and I think an apricot jam? And I can't believe I forgot to mention this, but before you order, service comes with complimentary bread and some sweet infused butter? I have no idea what kind of butter it was but man, it was good! 

Everything was quite delicious, only thing that I would pass on probably would be the crispy duck roll, those were too dry for my liking and also the caramel flan (it was just ok). Tip: get at least 2 orders of the stuffed dates (you won't regret it!). I can see how this would be an awesome place for groups.  Plus, on top of all that, the prices were very reasonable (esp. for Vegas). I wish they have a Firefly here in Seattle but a girl can only dream * le sigh*"}
{"text":"Fantastic and fun... tapas and atmosphere!  As a party of 5 we got to try a plethora of items, along with a pitcher of red wine sangria with bits of apple and pear (half price during happy hour)! 

The most authentic tapas  I've had since Barcelona... and that's saying mucho gusto. The Serrano ham was paper thin, soft and delicious, on toast with sun-dried tomato and manchego cheese. Don't miss a plate of the Padron peppers... roasted and doused in olive oil and sea salt. My favorite was the shrimp diablo... grilled and hot in a delectable sauce that was just the right burn. Stuffed chicken and chorizo mushrooms were awesome as well as the phyllo topped sauteed mushrooms in a lite cream sauce, The empenada actually seemed mundane after the myriad of flavors the other dishes had! Wait staff was efficient... serving the  plates taking and taking away the finished ones at an appropriate pace. Tried the dessert platter to top it all off and it was just enough... 2 bites of tres leches chocolate cake, mini cheesecakes, ice cream and a pirouette cookie.Perfect! Bill came in at about $30 per person for a feast."}
{"text":"Finally made it back for my two favorite items here at Firefly. 1 is the Mango Mojito and next is the order of the stuffed dates then shortly the Sangria. Mission accomplished and then off to my next adventure. If you have time try the tuna tar tar it is so refreshing"}
{"text":"Very convenient to the downtown/fremont st. hotels, with a view of the fremont st. light show (the restaurant is on the second floor of the building).  Waiters were very attentive to our large group and the food was very tasty.   However, if you're used to tapas in other places, where the operative word is 'small', watch out - Vegas does everything big and that includes tapas.  I ended up with about twice as much food as I expected."}
{"text":"I was looking for a place off the strip and I had a craving for tapas.  Lucky me.
I've been to a few tapas places in San Francisco that I'm in love with, but this one is right up there with those.
The service was very quick.  The servers were great about refilling water and removing dirty plates.
Food was very good.  I tried the tortilla espanola, meatballs, mussels, patatas bravas, and paella.  Servings were a little on the small side, but I guess that's what tapas are all about.  The tortilla and meatballs were good, but nothing super great.  The mussels were served in a coconut milk sauce.  Interesting flavor, but very good.  The patatas had a little kick to them.  It was a nice surprise.  The paella wasn't made to order based on the fact that it only took a few minutes to serve it and it usually takes about 30 minutes to prepare.  But there was a lot of seafood in it, so they didn't get cheap with the good stuff.
I will hopefully go back again, assuming I either have a car in Vegas or if I'm willing to jump in a taxt."}
{"text":"I have never heard of this place before and after coming here one night with a group of friends I left thinking, \"Why haven't I heard of this place before?!\" We came here for my friend's birthday before hitting up the club and you know what? I really liked the idea of having tapas. Because I mean, who would want to go out after a full meal?

Anyways, I only ordered the Firefly fries and Chicken and Chorizo Stuffed Mushrooms. Even with the small selection I chose, I was not disappointed. They even serve this bread with this sweet tasting butter which I could not stop eating! I even soaked them up with the sauce for the Camarones a la Diabla which someone else ordered. 

I really wanna go back and try more things on the menu. I wished I had tried the dates that everyone says is to die for! I'm definitely going back soon."}
{"text":"This was our first time with tapas.  Didn't know it was really small appetizers.  I'm not sure if you just go there to hang out and snack as you would have to order several dishes to make a meal if you were really hungry. However, the food was some of the BEST we've had.  Very upscale little bites of heaven.  Which makes me torn if it's too expensive for 4 bites because the quality was just sooooo good."}
{"text":"There was a 35 minute wait for a table on a Saturday night, and I see why. We were fortunate enough to snag a couple if seats at the bar rather than waiting for a table. 

Pros
Red Sangria!
Padron peppers - simply salted and flash-fried
Camarones al ajillo - the sauce was delicious!

Cons
Pulpo was inedible which was a shame since I love octopus.  However, upon mentioning it to the delightful South African bartender serving us, he kindly took it off our bill for us!

We also had the Duck rolls, Chicken stuffed mushrooms and Dessert platter - all of which were great.  Did not try the bacon wrapped dates this time but since everyone around us did and were raving about them, we'll have to try them the next time we're in town to visit Firefly."}
{"text":"Good food, nice staff, allergy friendly and a cool decor. I really enjoyed the octopus and the ceviche, really good portions for being tapas."}
{"text":"*3.5 *
I yelped this place upon a quick decision to stay in Las Vegas. We always stay at a Marriot, and who knew it'd be walking distance? Score. We walked in easily at 6:45pm--seated with water too. Out of a party of 7, each ordered two tapas, then a paella. Favorites: warm spinach salad, lentil and veggies, veg tempura, firefly fries and mac and cheese. The dessert tapas are good too, we had the pistachio, choc and vanilla gelato, nutella/banana sandwiches, and the lemon berry tartlets. Not a really a family friendly restaurant, favors the lounging/bar types, however come early and savor the happy hours specials, prob one of the best deals in this two star town."}
{"text":"Love this place! Every time I visit Vegas, I make sure to have dinner here. Huge selection of great food and spirits!! I have been here when it has been packed and when it has been slow and received great service both times."}
{"text":"Lovely atmosphere and great service. Everything is good and certain menu items are fantastic! I especially love the paiella and salmon toast."}
{"text":"One of the best meals in Vegas! We order multiple plates to share,  the bacon wrapped dates were first, savory and sweet. The we're the fries, I recommend the parmasean dipping sauce, we have to get a second (it was that good).  The Pork chops and chicken were flavorful, the mac and cheese was a must! Service was a little slow and the server could have been around more the food made it with it!"}
{"text":"Best dinner all weekend long!!! Great value!!! Next trip we skip the fancy shmancy dinners and head straight to Firefly!  Seven of us ordered three choices each, we all shared our food and with gratuity included it was less than a dinner for two at other Vegas dining destinations.  The only downside was that I only have one stomach!!!"}
{"text":"Great place and atmosphere.  Went here for dinner with 5 other friends.  Perfect for sharing tapas and pitches of sangria!  
There was not one bad thing we ordered!  Steak skewers, mushrooms, cerveche, artichokes, calamari, everything was soooo yummy!  Bathrooms arent the greatest.  The service was great and it was packed! LOVE IT!  I almost forgot the bacon covered dates! OMG to die for!"}
{"text":"awesome little tapas joint off strip. i'll let the food speak for itself on this one. 

red sangria- even the boys liked it and you know how picky they can get when it comes to \"fruity\" drinks.  

*tuna tartare - mango, doused in sauce...the tuna itself wasn't that fresh....but when there's that much sauce all you get its the chewy texture
*eggplant cannelloni w/ goat cheese - there's a lot of cheese in this one w/ the egg plant, so if you're not a fan of goat cheese...pass
*stuffed peppers- eaten w/ a crisp for a bit of a crunch. wasn't too memorable though
*machengo mac and cheese- favorite of the night. loved how they used shells instead of the typical noodles...and the cheese had an awesome consistency. *heart*
*chrispy duck roll- sauce was so overpowering i wouldn't have known there was duck in it
*tomato basil soup with brue grilled cheese- the soup had a strange aftertaste...i couldn't get past one spoon full. the brie grilled cheese was good though. 
*paella- its awesome here. try it!

dessert: 
*flan- more eggy than usual, but i love egg tarts so it was fine by me
*bread pudding- delicious esp with the melting ice cream 
*mini passion fruit cheesecakes- it was a little on the dense, but not overly sweet."}
{"text":"This place is kickass. Their RED sangria is to DIE for...always make sure to order a pitcher to go with your tapas. I don't think I've ever had a bad dish here. Among the things I've tried are: the baked brie, duck spring rolls, veggie empanadas, french fries (with a delicious dipping sauce), chicken skewers, and many others I can't remember! The prices are pretty affordable too...the only thing that is semi-pricey is the sangria, but that's a small price to pay for your meal. The desserts are also really good. I've had their banana nutella sandwiches and the chocolate cake thingie...both delicious. The only downside to this place is the CRAMPED parking area...most times if you're going at a peak hour (Fri or Sat nights), you'll have to park in the back...but it's not that big of a deal. Try to sit outside if you can during the spring/summer weather, it makes the meal even better. I've had a party of 10 inside for my bday, and that worked out well, too."}
{"text":"If you're willing to go just a short distance off-Strip to dine, this seems to be the place to go. We were there late on a weeknight, and it was packed! After dining there, I can see why. They have a great selection of traditional Spanish and other unique tapas, all reasonably priced. And the portions are more like appetizers meant to be shared than the two-bite tapas you find in Spain. Ordering about three tapas per person should be more than enough. The bacon wrapped dates, stuffed peppers, croquettas, tuna skewers, and eggplant are all excellent. The service is prompt and friendly and the atmosphere, while it can't compare to the hotel/casino places, is festive nonetheless."}
{"text":"I will keep this review short, simply and sweet.

I love this restaurant!! I wish we had one in California because it is down right delicious. Everything we tried was amazing and the tuna tartar was the best - I had TWO! This will be a MUST place to go to whenever I am in Vegas. I even dare say that it is a lot better than some high prices, high rise, five star restaurant's I've been to on both the strip and downtown.

But remember this is a TAPAS restaurant which means that plate sizes are finger food sized and not very large. It is a good place for groups but if you are all looking to stuff your face then this is not the place for you. If however you are looking for a sleek and posh restaurant with amazingly high quality food and flavor this is THE place!"}
{"text":"Fantastic. It was our anniversary & we went here with a big group of friends. The food was amazing, we ordered all sorts and every dish was delicious. Our waiter Eduardo was attentive and provided great service. We will definitely eat here again as it's the best Tapas experience I have had in the US"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place in Las Vegas. fun for 2 or fun for a group! Sangria is GREAT and the stuffed dates are the most delicious thing I have ever eaten. I go to Vegas 3 times a year and I NEVER miss out on eating here each time. MUST VISIT THIS PLACE!"}
{"text":"Had the petite filet and it was amazing!! The flavor was mouth drooling! Also had the white sangria which was delicious as well! Definitely going to be back! Decor was cool too"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to hit when in Vegas.  Superb food - high quality and very creative.  The mojitos are fantastic.  Only gripe is the long wait during peak times, but, hey, the secret is out, right?"}
{"text":"Wow, first time here in all my years in Vegas and I must say very impressed.  Great drinks all around and the bartender was definitely and expert in his profession.  I'm sad I didn't came on an empty stomach as the food that kept walking by looked fantastic. I will for sure be coming back for a full experience."}
{"text":"The best Mojitos I've had in a while! The food was very good and so was the ambience. Small shareable plates. Bacon Dates were my favorite!!"}
{"text":"The location is amazing, the stuffed dates are to die for and the service is tons of fun.  Hope that the remodel of The Plaza doesn't make this close before its time.  It is definitely worth the trip downtown!"}
{"text":"Our uber driver recommended and he was right!  This was a great restaurant which my husband and I thoroughly enjoyed!  

The camarones diablo was to die for, as was the pork empanadas!  My husband loved the dates wrapped in bacon!  We also enjoyed the sliders-superb, delish!"}
{"text":"Best Sangria I have ever had.  Nice change from ordinary Las Vegas chain restaurants."}
{"text":"One of the first restaurants I enjoyed in Vegas, sober. The happy hour is awesome--half price drinks including the pitchers of sangria. So by the end of the meal--not so sober, but still happily so.

All the food is small plates (thus \"tapas\"). The bacon-wrapped dates are incredible. My date and I ordered two plates full. It comes in six. The garlic/pimento spread that comes with the bread upon arrival is tasty. 

The pear martini is awesome--Grey Goose, pear puree. And half price during happy hour. The white sangria is delicious and full of green apple bits. It could use less ice, but who am I to argue with a restaurant in a desert city?

The lamp skewers were well done. The tuna tartare was incredible too.

Ambiance: the service is quick, the lighting is a bit on the dim side (think candlelight and red overheads), and the art works are eye-catching. 

Coming  back the next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Best tapas I've ever had. The infused vodka is delish as well. Service was great. Delivery of the food (staggered) was perfect."}
{"text":"Came here on a saturday night. Yes, it was pretty busy but that does not excuse the quality of the food. My hubby and I love their sangria. Ham & cheese croquetas are pretty good. The rest was so so. Plate of serrano ham & manchego cheese is served on a hot plate with dry cheese. Told the busser which brought us another plate but was not better.  I guess this will be our sangria place only."}
{"text":"I've bn coming to this bar/restaurant for many years.  The food is great & the bartender Daniel is the best .. Actually the whole staff is great .."}
{"text":"For our sixth date what an atmosphere :) Lilly and I needed girls night out!! Everything from the music to the food to the table candles was wonderful!! The server was friendly and the food came in great time and tasted great!! :) 


We would return to firefly before looking for a new hot spot! :) Xo"}
{"text":"Perhaps the best dining experience in the past ten years! Nothing less than top-notch food, and the service was prompt and polite. Kudos to the professional staff, from the manager Carlos to our table expert, Jorge. Value for money, my friends! Do yourself a favor: get over here, and know what being treated well tastes and feels like."}
{"text":"OMG!!!!!!!!!! Could this restaurant be in Portland please!!!!! I guess I would be in some serious trouble if it was!

My friend who is a regular took us here for lunch on my last day in Vegas, I could have seriously eaten there  every day! 

We had several plates...two different steak skewers-steak and mushroom and one with a green sauce, the figs (could have had these keep coming), croquettas-ham and cheese and meatballs. It was all amazing!!!!!!!!! Even the bread and almond butter you get when you sit down.

We all had a different mojioto- blood orange, raspberry, and mango! All yummy!

My only complaint is that it isn't in Portland, Oregon.

So do you deliver? ;)"}
{"text":"Great affordable tapas!

I love their sparkling sangria and their honey almond butter. I ate two platefuls of it this time around. 

My go-to's are the the tuna tartare and the mixed paella. Make sure you order the paella early on so you don't have to wait too long. 

This time we had Jaime serving our table along with our main server and he was amazing. Someone give him a promotion! He never let me see the bottom of my water glass and that is very rare. He even stopped another server from taking away my lemon wedges because he knew I wasn't done with them. 

Good food, good prices."}
{"text":"Our go-to destination whenever we visit Las Vegas. Great food, ambience and service! Get the Stuffed Dates, you won't be sorry. 

Our waiter Anthony was fantastic, very helpful and attentive to our large party and made Mom's birthday celebration a memorable one! Created a Yelp account just to shout him out because he was that great! :)"}
{"text":"Not much in the way of vegan items but if you are ready to cheat, well, this is the place to go!!!  Not cheap but not awful either.  Most of the veg tapas are 4 or 5 buxx.  Huge pitcher-sized pitcher of sangria, $24.   I don't know, this is the kind of place you see everywhere in Dallas.  Go there with your slutty-ass Wet Seal girlfriend.

More importantly it has generated the worst gas storm I've had in recent memory.  You should be happy you're not in the room with me.  It might just be all the $1.50 Miller Lites I had yesterday at Bill's but Firefly certainly didn't help, or hurt, or whatever."}
{"text":"We happened to be lucky enough to have a local with us and she brought us here. It's about a 5 min car ride behind the strip. 

It's tapas. We had two big guys and three gals in our gang. By the end our tab was $118 and we were STUFFED!

We went at about 6 on a Saturday night. There was a 20 min wait so we went to the bar and luckily found 5 seats together. 
We ordered a pitcher a sangria to share. Oh my goodness did that quench our thirst. It was red wine based with fresh fruit. Scrumptious!! We each were able to get 2 glasses-ish. 

The hostess came over and showed us to our seats. We were promptly served water and of course ordered another pitcher. After looking at the menu while at the bar we knew what we wanted for our first round. I must say the stuffed dates ARE A MUST!! I was unsure of them but once I ate one I immediately grabbed a second. (In fact we ended up ordering two more on our second round.) Everything we tried was amazing. They were a tad bit slow clearing the plates buys I think that's because we ate them so fast!! The shrimp ceviche and eggplant cannelloni is also worth a mention. Also the sliders were on point. 

Worth the cab fare."}
{"text":"this is my other off the strip find that i must frequent every time i'm in vegas.  i didn't realize this place is so well publicized.  i am a big sucker for deals, and they have the best happy hours!  i think they give you a complimentary plate of tapas during happy hours.  certain drinks, half off.  pitchers of sangrais and mojitos are not to be missed.  they have red and white sangria made fresh with tons of fruits as well as flavored mojitos.  the bartenders are really friendly and have sent free dessert my way every time!  bacon wrapped dates-so yummy!!  agreed that there is usually a couple of big groups of silicone filled girls drinking it up.  such a deal!!  i've had better tapas, but this is the best value for what you're getting.  oh, i love the tomato soup too!"}
{"text":"This place has been responsible for the starts and ends of many of the most memorable nights in Vegas. Excellent tapas, Spanish-quality sangria, and great service."}
{"text":"i give this restaurant 2 stars because of the service....or lack there of.  As a service industry worker myself i will give slack to the waitstaff/bartenders if they are busy. We had a party there just for 7 people there last week...we were told 25 minutes for a table. it ended up being over 1 hour.  The mngr did notice our wait time and did get us a pitcher of sangria (which is amazing) and sat us as quick as he could. Once sat our server made us feel rushed so he could turn and burn the table.  Again, as an industry person myself...i do understand turn and burn. But not after waiting over an hour for a table.

we decided again to go there after a couple of days to celebrate a family members 21st birthday. What were we thinking?  i get there to set up balloons...it was like pulling teeth to let them let me go to the table. (half of the party needs to be there to sit) all i wanted was to set up balloons. Next, once sat we sat there 5 minutes...10 minutes...15 minutes finally comes and I had to go back to the hostess stand to ask if we had a server. Hostess laughed like i was joking.  She tracked down our server...he looked at our table and he was shocked that he actually had us. HMMMM.....if you run a restaurant you need to hire people that understand where there SECTION is!!!!!  Finally....we were getting service. The mngr on duty who was different than a cpl days before came up to us and apologized for the delay of service because one of his waitstaff had to go to the hospital and they were short staffed.  OK, i understand being short staffed but dont tell your customers why.  Anyways, he offered the 21 year old a shot.  That was very kind....except he took 2 shots with her. I wasnt aware that managers can take shots during a shift. I know i cant when im on shift as a bartender!

The only things good at this Firefly is the sangria and food. Dont go there if you want good service thats for sure."}
{"text":"I have never written a review before but I had to rate this place. This place is great in terms of food and atmosphere. But the service is kind of bad. I worked in a restaurant before and I am willing to overlook it. The hostess tried to sit us at this table that was pretty much in the aisle of the restaurant. When I asked her for a different table, she told us that the tables next to the glass partition were for people with reservations. She said that if we could finish our meal before 8pm, then we could sit there. I guess we could have finished our meal before 8pm if this was an eating contest. I never asked her to sit at those tables, I just asked her if she could sit us somewhere else other than the aisle table. Just as I was about to concede to sitting at the aisle table, a table next to the window opened up. The waiter was prompt in taking out order but did not really come back to check on us or see if we needed refills. We had to flag down a busboy for refills. Well enough said about that. The wine we ordered was good. The food was pretty excellent. We had:
1. Roasted baby beet salad - pretty good
2. Stuffed dates - great, bacon really does go with everything
3. Camarones a la diabla - really liked this one, it had just the right amount of spice
4. Crispy duck roll - the sauce had too much vinegar
5. Petite filet - really loved this one. It was cooked well. The mushrooms and potatoes were very good.
And last but not least, the Chocolate \"tres leches\" cake - excellent. By far my most favorite part of the meal."}
{"text":"I went here with my bestfriend  who's local to Vegas about a year ago and she raved about this Spanish Tapas place.  I was like what's Tapas?!  Little did I know it is a gem of a place that plenty of people know about.  Keep in mind it is a bit off the strip. 

I recently went there to take my boyfriend for Vday so he can understand why I rave about it so much.  The consensus is right he absolutely loved the portions (hence \"Tapas\") and the infusions of flavor from every dish we tried.  I like the aioli sauce it's a kicker!  

Of course you can't try everything in one sitting, but I have continued to get the filet mignon sliders and the red sangria pitcher.  It's a good balance of fruit and alcohol and it's marinated 3 days prior.  Bravo!!!

My advice if it's around dinner time definitely make reservations via phone or opentable.com otherwise you'll be waiting for quite a loooooooonnnnnggggg time."}
{"text":"My friends threw me a small party here to start my 21st birthday!!! It's usually busy, I love the music, setting and mood. I like the mix diverse crowd, I also went on a date here and it was a quiet night so it was perfect. Great to bring friends visiting out of town because of the food too, and if you're a TOURIST check it out!!!!! very Latin Influenced FYI"}
{"text":"I'll keep this one short lol

AMAZING FOOD!!! I didn't know I could get full and happy off of tapas!!! Everything tasted great! I couldn't pick one thing over the rest to recommend because it was all good! Portion size was perfect for tapas! 

Staff was friendly and engaging, the atmosphere was fun though a little loud for lunch time (probably because my husband, 4 month old and I got seated next to a party of 20!), the food was amazing, the drinks were good and the price was to be expected. You definitely pay for the quality and portion size. 

Overall, I would definitely recommend this place!!!"}
{"text":"I ate here this past Friday night as a party of 6. The ambience was nice, service friendly, and food was very good. However, all 6 of us suffered from very violent food poisoning. I'm at the 48 hour point and am still recovering. The other location in Las Vegas was shut down due to not following health codes. (Thus why this restaurant opened) Looking at some other recent reviews I noticed others mentioning stomach aches. Under no circumstances will I ever eat here again as no food is worth this amount of discomfort. Eat here at your own risk!"}
{"text":"cheap food in small portions so you can try a little bit of everything. the mac 'n' cheese is delicious; the sun dried tomatoes is what did it for me! french fries were good as well as their red sangria! they're red sangria was worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Nothing bad food wise, but nothing to bring me back. Mediocre service and food. Asked for salt and pepper....get it?"}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in Las Vegas for food quality... you would not believe the price. The service is amazing, everything our waiter recommended was on point. The food and drinks were brought out faster than our go to breakfast establishment. Don't be deterred when walking by with the noise or appearance, the
Back has a quiet area. This place is sensational. Also the mojitos are banging!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! Great atmosphere with lovely food. such reasonable pricing for great food. 

Try the scallops and if you order the firefly fries, make sure you are sharing them! the portion is HUGE!"}
{"text":"The dates were amazing! I am excited to eat here again to try more things from the menu. I will have to try the sangria, thanks for the suggestion!"}
{"text":"This is a mixed review, the food was great, I ordered the mushroom tart and the chorizo clams. Both were great, especially the clams which were full of flavor. But the service was bad, they mess upmost of the other orders, and we're slow and inattentive. The water tasted off, as most likely they used the pitcher for something else, and did not wash it."}
{"text":"Love the firefly. They are so friendly and helpful choosing from their nice variety menu. Everything was yummy and we were served promptly too. The decor and Music is very tastfully done. The bartenders are friendly and the drinks were amazing. This was our 20th time in and will go back soon. If you have not gone you are missing out. Try the bacon wrapped dates. I promise you wont be dissappointed. You will be hooked."}
{"text":"Small plates not so much..  Order one or two plates less as the portion size is huge!  Food is ok."}
{"text":"LOVE this place.  everything we've ordered has been amazing.  we would go here every week if we lived close!  the new location is a lot bigger. there is also a large patio sitting area with some lounge couches too.  the last time we went we received EXCEPTIONAL service.  can't wait to go back, we want to try everything on the menu it is so good :) i honestly think it is my favorite restaurant!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice and both times I have been satisfied with the food. I personally think they have way too much on their menu making it hard for a first timer to make up her mind :). But the ambiance is very casual and relaxed.
Most of the locals come here to enjoy tapas. 
They have a second room in the back which in my opinion has a better ambiance. 
The drinks are good - not watered down - and that's important in vegas :)"}
{"text":"This place is always our first stop whenever we fly into Sin City. The menu is extensive. The servers are on the ball. You can't go wrong ordering the sangria, bacon wrapped stuffed dates, the mushroom tart and the Firefries!"}
{"text":"Salmonella!!!!! Beware! Outbreak on last week of April and restaurant is CLOSED as of 5/1 because of poor health inspection and hospitalizations of patients.

--------------------------------------

http://lasvegas.cbslocal.com/2013/04/30/salmonella-the-culprit-in-firefly-outbreak/

(Las Vegas, NV) -- Health district officials say salmonella's to blame for an outbreak at one of the most popular restaurants in Las Vegas, although the exact source is still unknown.

Southern Nevada Health District officials say more than three dozen patrons reported food poisoning symptoms after dining at Firefly on Paradise Road. The restaurant was shuttered Friday and remains closed while health officials investigate.

Salmonella can come from contaminated eggs, poultry, meat or produce, and can be transmitted through poor hygiene. Health district spokeswoman Stephanie Bethel said it's unclear where the bacteria came from.

Health district official Amy Irani said Monday that 39 patrons reported symptoms, and 10 said they sought medical attention. Symptoms included diarrhea and vomiting.

Results from the food samples may not be known until late in the week."}

{"text":"What can we say, we love this Vegas chain of fun and deliciousness. And how excited we we're when they opened up their Westside location. Whether it's the terra y mare, empanadas or the blood orange mojitos (best mojitos in town) this place never disappoints. Excellent customer service, great atmosphere and good eats and drinks is a recipe for always a good time."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! I heard about this place from a taxi driver my last trip to Vegas, but didn't get to go until this time. The waiter told me that apparently the wait is usually 1.5 hours, but we were lucky and got seated right away. The paella was so good!!! Actually all the dishes were amazing. I've only had tapas once before, but this beat out the other place by a lot. The environment is great, all the tapas we ordered were tasty and the customer service will definitely keep me coming back!"}
{"text":"best food ever and great staff had my first meal there on monday  loved it so much went back on wednesday with my friend"}
{"text":"Food and service not the same as the Paradise location. Overall it is still a good place to lounge and have great sangria."}
{"text":"Somebody please tell me what it is about Sangria that makes it go down the hatch like water??!  Firefly makes a great pitcher or three.  

For six chicas heading off the strip, Firefly was certainly worth it.  Fortunately, when with a large group, you can really delve into a tapas menu.  We ordered about 15 to share. 

The bacon wrapped, stuffed dates and the manchego macaroni and cheese were among my favorites.  Strangely enough, the \"firefly fries\" with Parmesan cheese were so good that we ordered a second batch.  Some other standouts were the tierra y mar skewers, a mushroom topped fillet mignon, and shrimp with garlic sauce.

I would stay away from the stuffed mushrooms, which were dry and boring, despite the menu description -  \"(yum)\" and the baked brie with chorizo, which just seemed like a collapsed salty mess.  

The delicious meal, decent atmosphere and a price of less than $35 per person would entice me to return."}
{"text":"Great food.. Service was alright. Everyone helped us BUT our server. It took 20 minutes for a shot of alcohol to get to our table. Other than that nice place and atmosphere. I took my boyfriend here for his birthday."}
{"text":"It is good! Food is delish tried mushrooms, Mac and cheese, scallops, and lamb chops. Service was super good and very professional. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had date night here on a Friday night.

The food was great, we were seated quickly and everyone was pleasant. They even had non-alcoholic beer, which is a plus because I was the designated driver.

The food was great, fresh, and you can't beat the price. I would definitely recommend this restaurant.

The only set back was that it gets a little loud, and the seating doesn't allow you to sit closely to your date. So, I had to cup my ears to listen to my wife tell me how her day was. Probably better for a social night out, than a date place.

I am looking forward to returning soon."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went for Valentine's Day and had a great experience. It's our 3rd or 4th time here and each time has been a solid 5 stars!!! THIS PLACE IS TOP NOTCH AND WON'T DISAPPOINT!! We have been when it's slow and busy and even when it's busy the wait for dishes isn't bad. Reservations *highly recommended* in the evenings! 

Tierra y Mar Skewer is PERFECT!! The steak is tender, the sauce is tangy. I hate shrimp and it's still delicious! The sausage completes the dish!!! 

We've had the apple and manchego salad as well as the chopped chicken salad and both were unexpectedly delicious. The apple and manchego has a delicious, tangy bite. 

My boyfriend got the Beef Wellington, which was one of their specials. I wasn't the biggest fan but it's not really my cup of tea. He loved it and it was only $15! Great way to try a dish and be able to do smaller portions. 

Ceviche of shrimp is the last dish I'd recommend. I'm such a snob when it comes to ceviche and Firefly's is always delicious!!! 

Lastly try the damn passion fruit mojito! I usually don't care for flavors in mojitos or margaritas but passion fruit is the way to go! We got a pitcher this time because of the deliciousness factor! 

If you are scared to try something, look at the yelp photos! It helps!!!"}
{"text":"A chef friend in San Diego had told me about this place. We had seven or eight taste treats (most recommended by the waiter, who was really great. Two standouts, bacon wrapped dates, and the white anchovies, oh and the spicy shrimp too. Everything was superb. Not only was it a great tasting with an attentive wait staff but very painless when the check came. I highly recommend Firefly."}
{"text":"the MF\"N best tapas...I live in SD and I always stop in for dinner here when I am in town."}
{"text":"What a great find on our recent trip to Vegas.  Everyone was in the mood to try new things and share and that is half the fun of this place.  Lots of great tapas and you must try their aged Sangria.  The staff were friendly and patient, the food was wonderful and the bill was easy to cover.  I had to try their paella and they did not disappoint me.  There is plenty of parking at the Paradise Road location and if the weather is not terribly hot, you can sit outside.
I plan on returning and trying more of their tapas."}
{"text":"Love the food n sangria =] it's a great hang out spot n those bacon wrapped dates are to die for =]"}
{"text":"The portions are huge! We ordered a few because we expected them to be small, but we were stuffed halfway through the first ones!"}
{"text":"WE are big fans of Firefly. The food is good and the staff is great. They have really delicious tapas and the passion fruit mojitos are really yummy! If you go to vegas you have to stop by. It's not far off the strip. There are some other restaurants in the plaza that look good but we've never tried any of them and I doubt we ever will since Firefly is here. Try the mushroom tarts and the stuffed mushrooms, also the bacon wrapped dates with almonds, and the Seafood Paella is really filling!"}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this place while we vacationed in beauty Summerlin - Las Vegas that is.  

Right away I loved the decor and the giant fireplace in the bar.  The Staff is amazing and efficient.  Firefly reminded me how much I do love tapas - 2 nights in a row.  The bar is great and comfortable with plenty of high tops, but they also boast a large heated patio.

Any tapas place worth it's weight should have outstanding Sangria in both varieties - and Firefly delivers.  My favorite was the sparkling White Sangria - it was refreshing, fruity and superb.

As for the small plates, we sampled the following:
Tierra Y Mar Skewers - the sausage is the most outstanding tidbit.
Empanada - 2x because just one a piece wasn't enough.
Meatballs - or Albondigas as they call them.
Veggie Empanada - delicious, and just as good as the pork.  Maybe better!

I sure do wish there was one of these nearby me!"}
{"text":"I went to the west side Firefly location for the first time last night. I was meeting a large group, but I got there first so I had a drink at the bar. The bar was busy, but the bartender looked cool and calm and I had excellent service, he even took the time to go through some of their new wines with me and I ended up trying a malbec that was amazing. I talked with the couple next to me and they come in at least twice a week. They said they even like it better than the one near the strip, which I was surprised to hear. My group finally showed up and we were seated right away. There was eight of us total. Our waiter was so nice and friendly from the moment he walked up to the table. He recommended some of his personal favorite tapas dishes and of course we had several pitchers of the famous sangria. The entire staff was great. from the hostess, the bartender, the waiter, the busser I honestly had no complaints... Except that I ate too much ;) The manager even came by our table twice throughout our dining experience to check on us. It seemed as if the staff worked well as a team and that's what makes a restaurant one I want to go to. I will and already have recommended the Sahara location to many of my friends and plan on being there for happy hour later this week. See you there!"}
{"text":"Yes their food is good but not worth being bitten time after time by spiders. Me and the girls I ate with were bit many times on our legs, when I told the manager he did nothing about it and just said they try to keep the bugs out but it's \"difficult\". Then just shrugged me off. Worse experience ever!"}
{"text":"I have been a Vegas regular for many years now. Growing a bit tired of my \"on the strip\" restaurant selections, I've been making it my goal to branch out.  I actually came across Firefly on Yelp and from the reviews was anxious to try it.  We ate here on 2/10/12 and...what can I say....the food was excellent, the prices were fair and the sangria was potent!!  I can't wait to go back and share this place with my family and friends.  One thing to remember - it's not like this place is a secret, you can tell it's a favorite of locals and tourists who ask around will hear about this restaurant.  It's incredibly busy and you will wait for a table - so, be sure to account for that when you are making you after-dinner plans.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Decent place to hang out with friends.  Their food is good overall and it's got a fun atmosphere.

As compared to the crazy Strip restaurants, their price is decent."}
{"text":"Wow.  Seriously great food, service, and overall experience. 

Husband & I ate at Firefly on St. Patrick's Day, Thursday 3/17.  We arrived around 11:30 p.m.; I thought it would be packed & kind of obnoxious, but it wasn't at all.  We sat on the patio, which had plenty of heat lamps, and were seated immediately. 

Everything was great.  The food was fabulous.  The only thing we had that I wouldn't recommend was the tomato/basil soup (tasted like something we could buy in bulk from Costco) but everything else was super tasty - baked tetilla, chorizo clams, empanada, terra y mar skewers, and the flan.  With 6 plates, we were stuffed...total bill was $42.  I like it!

Service was great, with our drinks being filled often, and although we had two servers, it didn't cause any confusion.  I would  highly recommend Firefly for anyone visiting Vegas.  And, they're open until 2 a.m.!"}
{"text":"I love, love, love Firefly! I've been here before and I am never disappointed. I've tried many items on the menu and everything is good. One of my favorites is the chorizo clams. So many flavors, all complimenting each other, in a bath of the most delicious broth. **Drool** The paella is wonderful, all the flavors perfectly balanced. Their ceviche is fresh and stuffed dates are amazing. It's a fun atmosphere with lots of wines and drinks to choose from. I consider myself a regular."}
{"text":"The three star rating is definitely qualified, and here's why. These sorts of places are relative. If you've ever eaten really good tapas where they're more likely to show up naturally, say, San Francisco, LA, NYC (and especially if you've ever roamed Spain), this place is definitely sub par. It's not that it's terrible, but more like the kind of tapas you'd get if you sent a recipe to a reasonably skilled cook in Milwaukee and said, let's see what you can do. The results are competently assembled, but utterly lacking in comparison to more authentic counterparts. So two stars, maybe. (Maybe.) On the other hand, if you've never been near a tapas restaurant and so far life has offered little more than Appleby's or Olive Garden, you might want to drop by here to get an idea of what tapas are. This might start you out on a journey to find the ones that are consistently nothing short of wonderful. Good luck."}
{"text":"My wife was one of the victims of the salmonella poisoning and has been in  and out of the hospitalized twice and now we are in the emergency room for the second time. In addition to the poisoning she also came down with C Diff!  The owners only care about their reputation and not about the 300 people they made sick and how this has affected our lives. So MAD they they opened up this restaurant again!!  DON'T EAT HERE EVER!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Loved every damn minute. Third time here, no disappointments- from the hostess to the valet, all dedicated and on point. We will be back tomorrow and every other visit to Vegas."}
{"text":"The food and pricing was ok, as to be expected from a tapas place. Good sangria

enjoyed the croquettes, tomato bread, steak dishes.

The main issue I had with the place and the reason I probably won't return is the front of house service.  I have worked front of house and my husband is a chef so we are familiar with the restaurant flow and professionalism.  The hostess was a ditz that seemed to flirt with every server there.  At one point, she was standing right next to my husband and a server guy started giving her a back massage...it was so awkward for us! And it was our anniversary dinner, to top it off.  The server we had was a bald/shaved head guy who had no personality.  The bussers/runners were great..kept refilling our drinks and checking on us! I wish I could have given the whole tip to them!  The server was preoccupied with flirting with the hostess to even bring our check.  We sat there with empty sangria and water glasses for 10-15 minutes until finally my husband had to walk up to him and ask for the check..in which he didn't even reply to my husband.  He then briskly walked by and threw the check on the table.  Soo disappointing..and it was a slow Monday night!  they seriously need management help there. i saw them on one of those restaurant nightmares shows..and it looks like the FOH has gotten worse.  Now, with the health issues at the Paradise location..I think i'll just stick away.  I really would love for my husband to open up a Tapas place and show them how it's done! :)"}
{"text":"We had a wedding reception in their private banquet room with 46 people. We planned the whole thing via email, and they were great! They responded right away and were so easy to work with. The food was awesome too, everyone loved it. 
There's a lot of options for banquets, we got unlimited 6 tapas of our choice, open bar for 2 hours, and dessert. The price could not be beat!! I want to go back before I leave!"}
{"text":"I dined with a friend visiting from London  on 04//22 from around 8-10pm

we ate

fried calamari
patatas bravas
TIERRA Y MAR skewers
lamb skewers
crispy duck roll
Serrano sliders (on website menu as Fillet Mignon Sliders)

I am still recovering, but the worst of it was 04/24-04/27

My friend, flew back to the UK 04/23  and has been in hospital since 04/26  and still has sever symptoms.

This is terrible.

All the best to everyone still recovering."}
{"text":"I'm torn on this one. I had heard soo many good things about Firefly, but I have to say I was a little disappointed. However, I'll start with the good: ambience. The setting is dark, intimate, and not so loud that you need to shout at the person sitting across the table from you. I imagine this would be a cool place to go later in the evening. I was there for HH and definitely didn't mind the 1/2 priced beers - I'll take a Stella from the tap for $3 any day!

For tapas I went with the the Manchego Mac 'n' Cheese, which was quite good but very rich. I also ordered the Tierra y Mar skewers that include steak, shrimp, and sausage. This is where things took a bad turn. My first bite of the filet mignon was so tough I had to stop and take a second go at it with a knife and fork. For such little pieces of meat I expected more tenderness. The shrimp was just ok, and I really did not care for the spicy flavor of the chorizo sausage. But perhaps my taste buds are just weird. Overall, Firefly gets an initial 3.5 stars. I'll be back to try other tapas on their extensive menu."}
{"text":"It was such a delight living right down the street from Fire Fly's... We could even walk home since it was so close to where we were living at the time.  My favorite thing about this amazing place is its Mojitos!!! Amazing!! I never liked mojitos til I ordered them here!! (and yes them about 4 or 5) lol 

My favorite tapa is the mushroom tart and mac'n cheese as well as the steak and mushroom skewers.  Oh and wait if you like tres leches cake you must try the chocolate tres leches!!! it is soooo decadent and such a treat!!! I have even tried to dupicate it and it just doesn't come out the same!! 

Love this place!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch, off the strip, not too many people. All the food was good, u can't go wrong, servers nice, drinks were good, mojitos and sangria good. Good solid 4."}
{"text":"Excellent tapas!  I am picky and I think I've tried more than half the menu and every dish has been outstanding.  The Sangria is also very tasty... I ended up drinking almost an entire pitcher last time I went!

The line is usually out the door and parking is limited.  The restaurant is next to the popular Ruth's Chris Steak House and a few other restaurants.  Makes parking a hassle as the lot in front of the businesses gets filled quickly.  There is parking behind Ruth's Chris and a walkway from the back parking lot to the front but it is a bit hidden.  

Firefly is one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas."}
{"text":"I was here on a Friday night July 13th with my hubby and another couple.  This place was BUSY, but our 30 minute wait wasn't bad.  When they seated us, we had to walk out of the restaurant and went next door, the 2 rooms didn't connect.  Parking here was easy, it has a decent parking lot since it's inside a retail strip.  

The service was good, our food and drinks were brought our accordingly, no long wait.  The food (small plates) was excellent, some of the plates were actually bigger than what I thought it would be. The salads are definitely a decent size for small plates.  Anything shrimp was awesome.  We had a lot, I don't remember exactly what we ordered. The stuff dates were good but a little on the sweet side.  The shrimp tempura was excellent, not like the ones you get from the sushi restaurants. It's lightly battered and had a wonderful taste, included fried green onions and potatoes I think.  The claims were good, season just right.  The thai beef salad had almost a bland taste to it but then you hit a hot chilli pepper and the spice kicked right in. I didn't try their tapas, what it's known for but the others said it's good.  We ordered so much more  and most of the items we ordered are good.  There is one octopus dish that was ok, wasn't the greatest.  Overall, price wise (about $200 including many many drinks) was decent for 4 people.  I would go back here again and again when I go to Vegas, this is my must hit place."}
{"text":"Great food clean environment, Antonio our waiter was amazing, very attentive. Delicious Sangria!! Filet mignon was exquisite.  My new favorite place!"}
{"text":"Sangria is the best in Las Vegas and you can't beat it at $3 a glass at happy hour.  Food is good not great.  Best happy hour in Vegas in my opinion.  They even bring you out a free appetizer."}
{"text":"Great bar with huge liquor selection. He tapas menu is also huge which I live and bow tapas should be. You can order alot of different dishes to try. Prices have gone up and the portions are bigger. Even their dessert menu had plenty options. Disappointing that they early happy hour is only on drinks and not food. Only their late night happy hour includes food. 
Lamb chops were good with a nice rub...didn't need the sauce and the sides it came with. The anchovy toast were really good. The lamb sausage sucked! Dry and very gamey, needed more herbs. Tuna tartare was very good. The octopus wasn't as good as the 1st time I had it."}
{"text":"Frustrating place to dine.  We were with a group on the patio. When we tried to order food, they told us we have to order inside. We went in and sat at one of the 2-tops in the bar, and were informed that we cant order from the bar unless we sit at the bar. Finally a waiter came over and took our order.  Then the waiter from outside informs us that if we need anything he will take care of us and not the waiter who took our order.  Wow!!!  Last visit here."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised. Carlos, was great, helping us choose our tapas. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Seriously...the BEST EVER! We are foodies and it's not often that I say I would eat here over and over! The flavors, service, relaxed atmosphere and options are phenomenal - can't even put into words! This is one of my most favorite places to eat! Must experience!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I dined at Firefly on Paradise tonight. We ate an early dinner at 5pm on a Monday. It was also a holiday, but it wasn't as busy as I expected. Happy hour was in full swing though and the outside seating area was packed. My wife and I weren't there for the happy hour so we were seated immediately inside the restaurant. We had the option of choosing a regular table or a table with a couch. We chose the table with the couch. It's nice especially if you're planning on staying to lounge for a while.

The service was excellent. The waiter checked up on us frequently and drinks were constantly refilled.

Our dinner: 
Empanada - $4.50, Chicken and chorizo stuffed mushrooms - $5, Filet mignon sliders - $7.50, Paella - $20, and the Dessert platter - $12. After tax $52.97, not including gratuity. Not bad. We were both stuffed and ordered more than enough food. We even had to take some home. 

The food was pretty tasty, but it wasn't the best I've ever had. The best I've had was in NYC, but the food there is always the best in my opinion. However, Firefly is still good. If I were to go again, I wouldn't order the Filet mignon sliders and the dessert platter since they weren't as good as I'd hoped for. The Filet mignon sliders were decent, but I would skip the dessert all together."}
{"text":"Went for my 30th birthday with a group of friends and family and this place far exceeded all expectations. The food and service was phenomenal. The staff was very attentive and went above and beyond for service. The bacon wrapped dates are amazing! All of the food was exceptional. No one in our group left hungry or unsatisfied. The atmosphere is great, the evening was so enjoyable. There is not one thing I could think of complaining about. This was just a great time and I would highly suggest this restaurant  to anyone."}
{"text":"This food is incredible! The servers are friendly and attentive! Pepe, Alejandra and Vanessa are the best!! :)) my favorite place to go after work!"}
{"text":"Hands down one of my favorite spots! I have damn near tried every tapa, entree, and flavored mojito they have to offer. I suggest Firefly to everyone! Dessert I can never get tired of is their tres leche. It is actually chocolate flavored. Weird because in the past I have always had a yellow cake soaked in \"leche\". I asked why theirs was chocolate... they said that's how it really is done in Mexico City, Mexico. Hey, guess they had it the extra authentic way. A few of my favorite dishes are: bacon wrapped dates, thai beef salad, filet mignon sliders, all of the skewers, and as an entree the rib eye which is served with their alloi is a must try! Their complimentary bread accompanied with an apple butter type spread and olives... mnn kepp them coming! Mango and Passion Fruit mojitos, oh how i LOVE you both :)"}
{"text":"We were driving by trying to find a restaurant n found this one... it was amazing from the appetizers to the main course. Customer service was over a 10 . Very friendly waiters. Will defiantly make it our place to eat everytime we come down from LA."}
{"text":"Delicious! Just stick to the drinks and tapas. If you are on a budget and want to feed a large group then order the big rice entrée, however the flavor is not great and is the reason for only 4 stars.

I came at dinner on December 18 2015. It was great to have come."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great food.  The Shrimp Diablo was delicious, great service.  Will definitely come again."}
{"text":"Love the new location, great customer service. TAPAS was great"}
{"text":"We went here during happy hour and sat at the bar.  Our bartender was Stan, he was awesome.  We used a coupon from the Las Vegas advisor.  The food was all very good.  We tried the dates and they were very good, but sweet.  If you don't like sweet stuff do not order these.  The sparkling Sangria was great and Stan even let us sample all three before ordering.  If you come, sit at the bar and come during happy hour for half price drinks."}
{"text":"A strong 3.5 stars.  I fell in love with tapas after I was introduced to it while living in Chicago.  Since then I've been on the search for tapas that lives up to the ones that I had while living in the windy city.  This place probably comes the closest.  Prices were somewhat reasonable.  The sparkling sangria was delicious, light and fruity.  The dishes themselves were all pretty good with pretty generous portions."}
{"text":"Really, really liked this place.  

Service was very quick.  Came in with 5 min to spare at end of happy hour.  Our server came right over and we managed to squeeze in an order of sangria before happy hour ended.  

Diablo shrimp was my favorite.  A little sweet but excellent.  Stuffed dates were also very good."}
{"text":"Came here based on a recommendation from a co-worker and yelp review.  Showed up as a solo on a early Friday night.  Food was excellent, service was just as good.  Both the waitress (Irina) and the supporting staff were friendly and very attentive.  Had such an excellent experience that I decided to go for lunch on Saturday afternoon.  I was seated promptly on one of their couches...and proceeded to sit there unnoticed for five plus minutes.  The hostess who sat me finally noticed that no one had come over to check on me so she promptly brought me a plate of their bread/olives.  Another ten minutes passed still no one to welcome me or take my drink order.  Fifteen plus minutes is more than I can bear.  As great as my experience was on Friday, I definitely experienced the complete opposite Saturday."}
{"text":"Had great sangria and tapas here in November!  I made a reservation but there were some big parties so we didn't get to sit in the overlook section.  That was perfectly okay with us as we had been tourists all day and could use some down time.  We still got a view of Fremont and had about 5 tapas and a pitcher of sangria over 2 hours.  The waitstaff was friendly and attentive.  I'd definitely recommend it to anyone going downtown!"}
{"text":"Place is very nice and clean. Food is good and they have varieties, small portions as it is tapas, great customer service... that pudding was awsome."}
{"text":"This tourist couple discovered Firefly watching the Travel channel about 10 years ago and have been coming here on every visit to Las Vegas every since.   The mojitos are excellent!  Love how the menu is structured around small plates that are around $5 each so you can try lots of different items and order more as you need to.  This particlarly good if you have a group of about 4 and are willing to share.  You might call it tapas inspired because it isn't Spanish food - just small plates of many different kinds of food.

Over the years it seems to have turned from a quiet, low key place to a much louder, trendy place but we still love it.  Lots of vegetarian options!  The roasted eggplant canneloni, and stuffed peppers are especially good."}
{"text":"Great vegetarian food! Had a good time sharing all the tapas with the family. The drinks were very good as well. 

The one fish dish we ordered from the entree (with mango) was pretty bad - recommend you send the dish back to the cook if you aren't happy. 

Overall a pleasant experience - had to leave the strip but it's not that far."}
{"text":"Since I tend to frequent Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba when I want tapas, I decided to give Firefly a shot. Took my friend out to dinner for her birthday here, and wasn't disappointed, but I also was not tempted to return again.

Started with the boquerones, the stuffed dates (one of my absolute favorite foods), roasted eggplant cannelloni (superb!) & the pulpo asado. We had the Paella as our entree.

There's not much you can screw up on boquerones, because the restaurant buys the white anchovies already marinated; the stuffed dates were delicious, I especially liked the crunch that the marcona almond added to the soft baked date and melted blue cheese; the eggplant cannelloni was wonderful, but I thought it was an odd item to find on a tapas menu, as it resembled the Italian Eggplant Rollatini, it was almost like they were looking for items to add to the menu; the pulpo asado (grilled octopus) was disappointing - there was no char from the grill on the octopus, which is key to making this dish. It was also rubbery. 

The paella was an abysmal failure. It was soupy, there was no seasoning, and they really skimped on the seafood and other items. It was like a sad seafood risotto, with some saffron added to give the affect of being a paella. 

The service and overall atmosphere were, by far, the worst part of the experience. I had to yell across my table to make conversation with my friend, because the place is so cramped with people. Our server seemed to act like we were an inconvenience by ordering so much food, and he decided to take 30 minutes to deliver our desserts to us. 

I think once was enough for me, and I have recently heard that the health department shut them down for a bit, due to the same constant health violations."}
{"text":"Maybe my expectations were a bit too high.. If this review was solely based on the paella, I would've added another star. But we got four items, and that was the only one we both liked. Tuna skewers were bland, the lobster \"escargot\" was just off, and the sliders according to the guy was \"ok.\"
Service was also mediocre. Sure money is important, and focusing more on larger parties means better tips, but we tip too!! And sometimes alot more than we really should! We shouldn't have to constantly flag someone down for a refill and we hardly saw our server. We politely asked for more bread, and he looked at us like we were bothering him. =\ 

Anyway, I'd probably come back for the paella..and only for lunch. This place gets real crowded for dinner and lunch time seems a bit more laxed."}
{"text":"My wife and I, hosted a small wedding reception in their semi private area.  They handled the event with exceptional service by their staff.  

I would recommend the venue for this type of event.

The only downside was that I happened to chop down on an olive.  I expected it to be pitted, and I found it to have a pit.  Unfortunately, my tooth was not receptive.  Firefly handled it in a very responsible and professional manner.  

Great time was had by all."}
{"text":"FIREFLY ROCKS!!!  They have awsome service! Awesome food and Awesome Mojitos and Sangrias!  We went there for a bachelorette party with a group of around 20 people and their service was excellent and their food kept coming out!  I loved all the dishes we ordered, the Ahi Tuna, the Calamari, the Surf and Turf, the spicy steak salad...all of it!  I guess if I had to pick, there were only two items that I thought were good but nothing special about them....The Filet Slider Burgers and the Mac & Cheese.  They are good, but no biggie and you're better off ordering something else on the menu to fill your stomach with.  They have a huge menu to order from too!  Best of all their prices are  very reasonable!  About $5 to $10 a dish.  Since we has such a large group, we ordered pretty much everything on the menu so I got to try so many different dishes and I loved them all!  Our bill came out to about $40 per person, which included drinks and tax!!!  If you're ever in Vegas and want to get away from the tourist trap hotel restaurants, go to Firefly!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Every time my wife and I are in Vegas, we have to come here. We usually start with the Red Sangria which is delicious. We then go to the tapas menu which is excellent and affordable. Our favorite starter is the Stuffed Dates with goat cheese. We then go with the calamari, lamb chops, chorizo and clams, shrimp tempura, etc. There hasn't been an item on the menu that I do not love or would not try. Good food. Loud, but that means the place is lively. We converse with other people about the food and get excellent recommendations. Not to mention the excellent staff. They are both courteous and professional. We love this place."}
{"text":"I live in California and needed to arrange a wedding rehearsal dinner for my nephew.  His fiance had suggested Firefly.  She said the food was great and she and her family enjoy it.  I looked them up online and and came across the event section, I sent a quick email for someone to call me.  That day, the event coordinator Regina Simmons contacted me.  We corresponed via email text and by phone.  We were a party of 35 and were able to have the private room in the back.  

On our way to the venue I sent Regina a text that we were on our way.  Once seated our waiter, Jesus was on it.  We had water bread and drink orders.  Oh did I mention that I left all my centerpieces there and Regina and her staff decorated for me.  She even ordered linens and napkins to match our rustic chic wedding decor.  Everything looked beautiful.  

Within 10 minutes of settling in, BAM!!!!  The food, oh the food.  We had artichoke toast, the bacon wrapped dates, salmon toast, beef and chicken skewers and the diablo shrimp.  Everything was delicious.  The service was awesome and the food amazing.  The value was definately there.

Parking, use the valet parking, it's FREE!!!!!

When we were leaving, the place was bumping, it was a great vibe and great mix of people.  I will definately be back on our next trip.  Can't wait to try new items. (Will definately order the bacon dates again)

Thank you Regina and the Firefly staff for making this event special and memorable for my nephew and and now new wife. 

Gracias por todo!"}
{"text":"The food was good.  We ordered the shishito peppers, fries, sangria, and bacon wrapped dates.  The service was not that great.  It took about 10 minutes before anyone came to talk to us, and there was only one other table in the whole restaurant at the time.

After we finished eating I went to the men's restroom.  I smelled pungent body odor coming from the stall next to me.  An employee came out of the stall and left the bathroom without washing his hands.  We will not be coming back here.

Summary: Filet o' poop."}
{"text":"Firefly is a must when I go to Las Vegas. Speedy service, AMAZING manchego mac n' cheese and red house-made sangria.  Everything is super yummy!  Honestly better food and better prices than most other spanish/latin/mexican places on the strip."}
{"text":"I come here often because the Margaritas and drinks are amazing.  A great atmosphere and relaxing place for a hangout with friends after work.  I don't like the menu too much because they don't have alot of healthy choices.  Overall, I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who doesn't know about it."}
{"text":"Came late night with a party of 13 people called ahead and they had a table ready for us. Since it was late we were able take advantage of happy hour prices on a few items which was great, we ordered a few pitchers of Sangria and variety of tapas everything was excellent, the tapas that stood out to me were the may y tierra skewer, patatas bravas and my wife enjoyed the croquetas. Service was good and attentive would definitely go back"}
{"text":"My family loves lunch and dinner at Firefly. We just found out about Saturday brunch and it is awesome. I don't think you can come here and not like a majority of the things on the menu.  It is tapas so you can order another small dish and try everything!"}
{"text":"Finally made it out to Firefly on our last Vegas trip. The food was good - loved the mussels in curry sauce and the sangria the most. However, the service was very confusing! After a few minutes of being seated, a waiter came up to ask us if we've been helped. The tables aren't assigned? After that, it was hard to find the guy, and he forgot one of our orders. When we told him that he forgot, he said oh I'm sorry and stared at us as if to ask what we'd like him to do. Anyway, at least the food was good!"}
{"text":"Came here for a dinner in one of their private rooms. Since I was fasting I needed to eat vegan to which they were very accommodating. The potatoes brava were really good along with the winter veggies. People at the table enjoyed their food. I would recommend"}
{"text":"Really good, of course we just got in town and avis didn't have the compact car we requested so we got a 2013 mustang at the same rate, so this might be exagerated. Bacon almond dates are amazing. Pulpa is cooked well but needs a sauce. Lamb was tasty. If anything, do yourself a favor and order a pitcher of sangria. Gonna have to go to the one in LA to compare. Looked like their happy hour is where it's at and any time you can get of the strip its well worth it."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I love coming to firefly on our nights off together. We always sit at the bar and make sure to come when Athena is working. She always makes sure we have the best time and have everything we need! Her food suggestions are always on point, not to mention the delicious drinks! She works so efficiently and never makes us feel like she's rushed. We will definitely keep coming back here."}
{"text":"Firefly...there is no substitute for this place.  Bacon wrapped dates, Sangria, Tuna tartare, filet skewers...this place never disappoints.  Be sure you say hi to Athena at the bar - she rocks."}
{"text":"We had great service with drinks and water always staying full! All the tapas were delicious and their vegan menu was great for all our vegan friends."}
{"text":"Off the strip, but close enough for any visitor to get to.  Great selection of tapas.  Loved how the service didn't rush us.  Save room for the Tres Leche Cake for dessert."}
{"text":"Had dinner recently at the newly re-opened Firefly on Paradise. The restaurant was spotless. The new bathrooms were bigger and clean, Food was excellent. They added 2 new items, would have loved a few more new bites but the spicy chicken empanadas were yummy. The mussels are still my absolute fav and the mushroom tart was delicious!!! Honestly, right now and for the next year at least... it's probably the safest and cleanest resturaunt in Vegas. Highly recommend to all!!!"}
{"text":"A friend of mine was in town and I took her here based on the yelp reviews.  It was my first time as well and I had high expectations based on the reviews.  This place did not disappoint!  The food and the drinks were fantastic!  We ordered a pitcher of sangria to split.  So yummy!  I just kept drinking more and more....They have this amazing garlic bread to start, with some sort of sweet butter.  AMAZING!  It was addicting and I had to stop myself from eating the whole thing.  In addition, my friend and I ordered the firefly fries, steak and mushroom skewers, and ham and cheese croquets.  All of the dishes were phenomenal.  They have a lot of different options for tapas and they all sounded so good but we had to stop after 3 since we were getting real full. 

The service was also great.  Our server always came by to check on us and our glasses were always filled.  This place looks to be a great place for groups to eat and drink together.  We came around 7:45-8pm and were seated right away.  It wasn't too busy.  However, as the night went on, it seemed to start getting really busy and louder around maybe 9pm with a lot more groups.  Something to keep in mind.

I can't wait to come back here and take my husband so we can try some more tapas (looking forward to trying their paella)...and so I can drink more of that delicious sangria of course ;)"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Vegas!! The food is always delicious, the atmosphere is always warm, and the Sangria is delicious."}
{"text":"Best place for tapas the stars wrapped in bacon are my absolute fav along with the mussels in a creamy tomato sauce is also amazing but the thing I go for is the sangria it is to die for every time I go on vacation to Vegas I make sure I stop here it's a must"}
{"text":"Awesome food. Great service. Cool music."}
{"text":"Great cocktails but bad service.  Sat at the bar and pretty much had the menu thrown at me. It took about ten minutes for the bar tender to notice me after I had a chance to review the menu. It was my first time there and probably my last. Sucks because I was really excited about going there."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!

Do yourself a favor and reserve a table ahead of time.
I went on a Wednesday night and there was a 30 minute wait. I can only assume this place is packed every night. Luckily, since I had reserved a table I was seated right away.

Pretty loud and super casual, lots of great menu options.
I'll definitely be back the next time i'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"My family and I had a leisurely lunch here.  I can't say enough good things about this restaurant.  All of the tapas were excellent, especially the bacon wrapped dates, tuna tartar, empandas and smoked salmon.  The service was excellent as well.  I wholehearedly recommend this restaurant.  We can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This place have stale food which is microwaved when you complain it is cold. I could not believe they reheated our skewers in microwave instead of making new ones. these came out chewy and cold inside. It is pathetic, how can they charge $15 for a plate and not have Courtesy to at least make there edible. I saw lot of people here either they are tourist who do not know any better or people who have never been to true tapas place."}
{"text":"Such a lovely little restaurant with a patio, the food is great and fair price. If I go to Vegas I will defiantly go have lunch here if you like tapas."}
{"text":"The best calamari I have ever tasted in my life. The sangria is also amazing. It is a very nice environment but if you don't get there early then be prepared to wait up to an hour and a half for a seat."}
{"text":"Three words: Bacon Wrapped Dates!  These things were phenomenal.  We must have ordered 3 of them.  This is a great place facing the Fremont Street Experience.  They have an awesome selection of small plates to sample while you watch the show down on the street. My only problem was deciding what I wanted.  I really wanted to order everything on the menu, and almost did!  It is truly a feast for all senses!"}
{"text":"It's Friday night, you and your girls want to go grab a bite - you're looking for something trendy but not stuffy, satisfying but not heavy, with cocktails and a killer view. 

Well, let me suggest....Firefly at the Plaza.

This is the restaurant's second location in Vegas. I had been to the location on Paradise several times. It's got a great location down the street from the Hard Rock. I always preferred sitting on the patio at that location because the inside feels a little small, dark and cramped. The Plaza location, on the other hand, is something I show off to my friends.

It is located under a huge dome that looks out onto the lights and neon of Fremont Street. 

Oh and have I mentioned the food? DELICIOUS. This is a tapas style restaurant so sharing is caring here. The Ham and Cheese Croquettes are some of my favorite things on the planet. And, as I like to think of myself as a mac-n-cheese connoisseur....their Monchego Mac-n-Cheese is in my Top 3. 

But the real attention grabber here? SANGRIA. They offer red, white and sparkling and you really can't go wrong - although I prefer the red. And if you're not in the mood for fruity wine, order yourself a Mojito and let your hair down!

My only complaint would be the service. It is very. slow. But, then again, that just leaves more time for you to finish off that pitcher!"}
{"text":"I was very surprised to find a lively modern restaurant at the Plaza since I barely go downtown and wouldn't expect this kind of place to be there.  I went in a large group for a co-worker's birthday and really enjoyed it.   The seating is in a huge dome overlooking Fremont Street which is really cool, they shot scenes from casino in there(according to one of the people I ate with-I haven't verified this)  Almost everything we ate was really delicious and the sangria was good too.  Plus the bartender was cool and made us yummy girly shots like chocolate cake and pineapple upside down cake.  I can't wait to take out of town guest there or go back with a group of friends again.  My favorite tapas was the artichoke toast.  least favorite-ribs  Order a bunch of things and share!"}
{"text":"Went with a group of friends and had a wide selection of dishes. Very good with the octopus and lamb chops my favorites. Service was first rate."}
{"text":"I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!

Every time my friends and I go to Vegas we always make it a point to go here. They have the best Sangria's i've ever tasted and their tapas foods are really good. I especially liked the filet mignon sliders, camarones, garlic fries and paella. 

The atmosphere in this restaurant is very chill, they have dim lights for those special first dates and comfortable couches where you can chit chat with your friends all night. 

One time I took my aunt's here for my stepmom's birthday and all of them got druunnk from the Sangria. You know it's a great place when your nearing-50-year-old-aunts are having the time of their lives! I'm not sure if they do reservations but in any case, come early! it's a very popular spot for the locals."}
{"text":"Pretty good casual place off the strip, a huge locals hangout.  Impossible to spend a ton of money here, tapas menu is extensive and fills you up without draining the wallet. 

Very good sangria

Service is okay but don't expect much from such a casual place. 

Can get packed and you might have to wait for a table, open till the wee hours of the morning but in vegas what isnt?"}
{"text":"My husband and I spend our summer's in Vegas. We have been coming to firefly for years. The new location is bigger and very nice. Our favorites include the tomato basil soup and tuna tar tar, and for dessert we love the tres leches chocolate cake! We have tried probably 3/4 of the menu and those are must haves!"}
{"text":"Our awesome server Manny G was great with the service and was even better exposing us to new drinks. New drinks that were not in the menu were a treat. My friends and I return to restaurants constantly due to their cocktails and food. But mind you the cocktails keep us coming. Thank you Manny for the great drinks we (6 of us) hope we see these in the menu soon. Thanks so much Firefly!!!"}
{"text":"I cannot find one bad thing to say about this place!  We had our 20th Anniversary party here, after doing our vow renewal at Little Chapel of Flowers this past Saturday.  The Chapel went faster then we thought it would and our reservations weren't until 7:00pm and we were done by 6pm!  With 30 people standing around I called Firefly and they were SO accommodating to see if we could get in early!  We got there at 615pm and the room wasn't quite ready but no worries, we all went into the bar area and ordered a drink.  About 15 minutes later we were ushered into a really cute room with a long table and then drink orders were taken and then appetizers started to flow!  We did the multi-course sit down for 30 people ($35 a head) and a two hour open bar.  The food was SO good and I'd never been here before, was totally off of the Yelp reviews that I picked this place!  The manager and our coordinator were amazing, always ensuring we were happy and that everyone always had a full drink and food in front of them.  I guess the only thing I could say is that I wish the glass door to the room stayed closed, it got a little loud, and my dad was having a hard time hearing, but that would be THE only thing I could say!  This place has amazing service, awesome food and wonderful people working here!  Next time we are in Vegas we will be back.............with less people but we'll be there!!!!  THANK YOU SO MUCH FIREFLY!"}
{"text":"The most amazing place I have eaten at. It was based on small portions ( tapas), but they didn't skimp you in flavor,amount, or the price. The service was excellent! Except for the hostess's they were a little snotty, but we didn't care our servers were wonderful and the bussers were so efficient and fast! We were visiting Vegas and ate there twice within our stay! Thank you we will be back!"}
{"text":"We haven't been to Firefly in awhile, but thought we would give the new location a try.  It is awesome!  They have made a few changes to the menu that are great.  Specifically, they have mini Italian Beef sandwiches Chicago style.  As a Chicago native, I thought they were spectacular.  The new restaurant is roomy and has great ambiance.  Our interest in Firefly definitely has been renewed and it will be back on the list of regular places we frequent.

Room for improvement: The service was a bit slow, especially since we went on a Friday night and the place was not packed.  We prefer to order a couple plates at a time. Though we told our waiter this, he was not very good at checking back regularly to see if we were ready to order more.  Also, something has to be done about the noise level.  I suspect that due to the low ceilings and type of flooring there is nothing to absorb the noise all the patrons make.  It was very difficult to carry on a conversation due to the loud crowd noise.  If the place was packed, it would have been unbearable.  I hope management will do something to help minimize.  If the noise issue is resolved I would give it a 5 star rating.

Overall: This is a must on any trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"This is easily one of the best meals I have ever had in Vegas. Huevos estrellados, Chicago beef bocadillos, baby back ribs, baked tetilla, and baked goat cheese. The huevos alone made the meal worth it. Their sangria is nice, not too dry or sweet and my cocktail was also very good."}
{"text":"Good for half off drinks for happy hour! The sangrias are good. only got to try the white sparkling 

 this is all tapas style food which i love cause it is perfect for sharing.. the price was not bad at all.  $10 or less most are below 7.  Any place where they give complimentary seasoned garlic bread with yummy butter is a yes for me"}
{"text":"I love this place....there is nothing better than getting to try lots of different items for a great price"}
{"text":"Why has no one forced us to try this place before? Truly amazing food. We had 6 different plates and dessert. The service was great too. We don't live close, but worth the drive."}
{"text":"SOLID. 

From LA, and we have choices. This place rocks.
Great atmosphere, amazing food.

We only had a party of two, but Best for groups of four or more so you can try more of the amazing tapas plates.

Hello Nutella banana sandwiches. Lamb chops, steak and mushroom skewers. I will miss you when I leave :)"}
{"text":"Ate three meals during our 2 nights' stay, and two of those were at this place!! Had we stayed longer, we could have eaten there everyday for another 2 months at least.. lol..

Everything we tasted were great, but by far my favorite is the lentils."}
{"text":"I would rather not write this review seeing as how i have been a fan of the firefly on paradise road. I have been going there for four years.

So i have only ever worked in this industry. I am 24 years old and work in the back of the house now but i started at 16 as a hosts. I have done every position in the front and back of the house so i know the problems that each can face and i tend to give leeway whenever i go out to eat. but this firefly was another story. 

The food: 
I have nothing bad to say about the food, as always my guests ( in this case my 7 relatives from out of town)  were impressed with the quality of the food. We ordered so many different items and everyone was so happy.

The service:
So our servers name was Mandaline. she was very Rude when i asked her about splitting a check. Then when i asked her to keep track of who had what so it would be easier for us to divide up ourselves at the end of the meal she refused to do that as well. She neglected to take some of our food order, did not hold the desert to be delivered at the end of the meal like 2 of my guests requested,  after taking the food order she never visited the table to check on us even though i specifically told her that we would b ordering another round of tapas. At the end of the meal after my family had had there fill of food the check was presented and we proceeded to attempt to break the check up ourselves (which was extremely difficult seeing as how it is so loud in the restaurant and that despite everything being ordered in groups by the people who wanted to share individual checks the items where all jumbled on the check. When we figured out the check and everyone had paid their portion i handed the check to our server and in a condescending tone she said \"there that wasn't hard was it?\" Had our server been nicer and paid better attention to our table our bill would have been much higher and her automatic gratuity would have been much higher. but there is a price to pay when you want to give bad service. I just hope she reads this review or her manager reads this review so she can take a moment and realize that good service is the cornerstone of a good dining experience. 

I am known by my friends and family to over tip.our automatic gratuity which was applied to the check was 25 dollars. had we received better service the check would have been higher and the gratuity would have been higher. and i would have added on an extra 10 bucks of my own money at least. but thanks to the bad service we received  if the gratuity had not been there i would have left no tip. a tip is a way to thank your server for taking care of you. our server took no steps to take care of us in any way imaginable. 

Conclusion:
Service sucks, food was good as always, but i will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere...great meal...there is something for everybody!  Prices are very reasonable, you get a lot of food for the price you pay.  The drinks have a heavy pour...well worth the visit to any of the locations in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Garbage place... trying to give it another chance, after the salmonella infestation... and they fail miserably 
How can you serve cold fries, frozen stuffed piquillo peppers bland steak skewers and zero service....
Is time to close the curtain Firefly"}
{"text":"A group of about 15 of us had dinner here before a bachelorette night out. The food was fantastic. We had a selection of five tapas that just kept appearing on our table like something out of a dream. The filet medallions and stuffed dates were my favorites. The service was a bit slow at first but once the first round of food came out it got better. The drinks were a little pricey, but the sangria was good and they had a good Spanish beer as well. I go out to Vegas once a year for business and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"FOOD POISONING

I hate to be the bearer of bad news, especially after being a huge fan of this place. But 3 out of 4 people in our dinner party Tuesday night ate the hamburger sliders. My fiance..who has an iron stomach had a little stomach ache Wednesday night, but my friend and I at about 2 am both were doubled over in severe pain and I finally went to urgent care. All symptoms I have been experiencing point to E Coli...if I am wrong on that its still definitely food poisoning bad enough I was put on antibiotics and told not to return to work until Monday (I work in a kitchen and its health code) besides I barely still have enough energy to walk my dog let alone work. I have lost 600.00 in wages due to this and been completely miserable. I called the restaurant and they were very apologetic and tried to be accomodating saying they would take care of us the next time we came in...but I am still out basically a whole months rent because one of their cooks didn't abide by proper cooking procedures and health codes. I am worried how many other people are sick from them this week and IF Firefly did in fact take the sliders off the menu until they could investigate the situation as they told me. Please contact me if you see this and were also hit with a case of food poisoning or better yet contact the health department. If FIREFLY is resolving their situation and fixing this then they wont have a problem with the health department. But if they disregard this issue then more people could be at danger which is why they must be contacted. More than 2 cases of food poisoning from the same item on the same day is considered an outbreak...I have 3 cases already. Lets protect our tourists so they want to come back. I promise that if I find out they have fixed and followed proper procedure I will update my yelp and encourage people to go back but for now I just cant."}
{"text":"Food 4 plus stars, mojito's, if I could give more than 5 I would.
The service on this particular occasion, was some of the worst I have experienced. Our waitress(BRITT) finally came by after about 25 minutes to see if we were ready to order. Keep in mind(Arnold) the busboy brought bread, water and then even finally our first pitcher when he realized the waitress was nowhere to be found. I can understand if you are busy, just swing by my table and let me know you will be with me shortly. Se cmes by to take our order makes up some half fast excus about putting through some orders. Later during the meal the busboy came by and used the new girl excuse. I don't think we will give it a second try, maybe we will give the other location a chance.
They did in their defence comp one of our pitchers.

Made us all very sad."}
{"text":"3rd time in 3 years when I visit vegas.  Always great food and decent service.  Dj and dancing Friday nights on the patio"}
{"text":"Great Spanish tapas style restaurant. Food was great price atmosphere  and cocktails great also .  Must visit place in Vegas.  I'll definitely  be back. Even on a Monday night.  It had a good vibe."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful dining experience. I would definitely come back and recommend to my friends while visiting Vegas. I did take the time to read previous reviews for ordering recommendations. Let me just say that everything I ordered was quite savory. We did start with the stuffed dates and paradise mojitos. Let me just say they were amazing. I also ordered.. Steak & mushroom skewers, baked goat cheese, spicy beef salad (I wasn't absolute fan ..but the rest the table was), mushroom tart (perfect) , chicken tinga empanada (yum) , baby back ribs (also not my favorite but very tender) , camarones a la diabla (loved) , and last but not least ceviche of shrimp (also very delicious.) I can't wait to come back. I wish there was the location in San Diego,  California. The wedding party I was with was very satisfied, we had a great memorable time."}
{"text":"I am devastated to learn that this Firefly location has closed! The food here is absolutely amazing! Definitely my favorite restaurant in town!"}
{"text":"So ever since my friend took me to this local joint, I've been HOOKED. I have made sure to have dinner and drinks there each and every time I'm in Vegas since that inaugural visit. Everyone else who I take there loves it as well.

The ambiance is great -- totally chill and unpretentious but there are lots of cute locals at the bar for eye candy. ;)  Things that I ALWAYS order when I'm there, a pitcher or two of sangria - both red and white are good, the bacon-wrapped dates, patatas bravas, cerviche of shrimp, camarones a la diablo - I'm kinda big on seafood stuff! But everything is pretty good. The paella helps for those who need MORE food for their bellies."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere!!!! Great service!!!! Amazing food!!!! With every bite I get from that place I am inspired. Big kudos to the manager Chad! That always makes our dinning experience memorable. Keep up the great work!!!!"}
{"text":"Food was outstanding.

Wine glass was dirty, but service was superb. I will return ASAP"}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place. Fabulous tapas, great atmosphere, and the sangria is delish. They make all sorts of fresh fruit sangrias. Try the dates - you won't regret it!  I try to get here whenever I am in Vegas. Great atmosphere - very fun, upbeat place...

It's located in a strip mall and parking can be tight."}
{"text":"Yep - pretty awesome food and priced like it's in a strip mall.   Oh yeah, it's IN a strip mall.

Seriously, the almond butter that comes with the bread is probably my favorite thing.  The bacon wrapped dates seem to be the most popular, but I think that is just because they are not typical.  I also tried the sliders, mac and cheese, empanadas, ribs, and meatballs.  All of them were above average, but not necessarily spectacular.  They have 3 kinds of sangria which is a nice change, although I wonder how much non red sangria they sell.

This place is pretty casual and works best in multiples of 2.  All the dishes come in 2 or 4 pieces which is something to be aware of...so if you have 3 people, you gotta order double of everything.  

Finally....   Yes it is worth the trip off of the main drag."}
{"text":"This place has delicious tapas.  It is a great place to go when you want a taste of a little bit of everything."}
{"text":"Very tasty food and excellent people management! We had a booking for 20 people, and as soon as the staff noticed it was a wedding party tequila shots were suggested :) The waitstaff were very patient when dealing with a large number of people and their separate orders for food and drinks. The food itself was delicious and very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Loved it. Great food and nice staff. Very noicy."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! Great service and they are open late! I would recommend this place to anyone that enjoys tapas. My GF and I had 3 different dishes, they all came out quick even though it was a Saturday night and busy. There are so many options here...I would come here again for sure. Its great for large groups or a small date."}
{"text":"A must try. The best food in town. I could eat it everyday. I wish there was more locations so I didn't have to drive far."}
{"text":"LOVE this place. I always go here when I visit Vegas. Its a very cute place and definitely very happening at all hours. They have plenty of tables and can easily accompany a large party. its dimly lit in the evening which makes it both fun and romantic. They also serve delicious pitchers of sangria. portions are slightly larger than I'm used to for tapas (which is a plus for us anyway). I think every item on the menu is equally delicious. Ok now for the food breakdown, please forgive me if I'm off in titling the food items...

-Steamed mussels- one of my favorites here! Its a generous serving of mussels in what seems like a thai like curry sauce. 
-Lobster escargot- lobster pieces served in a garlic butter sauce, a must try for sure
-Charizo clams- serviced in a great and very light sauce, i think its white wine and something else
-ham and cheese croquets- i know it sounds boring and lame, but they make it really well!!
-lamb skewers- not overly cooked, served on a bed of lentils
-Apple and manchego salad- strips of apple and manchego cheese. sounds odd but they go very nicely together
-Tuna tartare- diced cubes of raw tuna with avocado served with taro chips. The taro chips are very nice and light
Baked filets of tilapia- good, but doesn't stand out against the other dishes. The sauce is very simple
Camarones a la diabla- grilled shrimp in a nice spicy chile sauce. LOVE this dish"}
{"text":"flies sure in your stomach. hit or miss dishes. packed restaurant during dinner. worth a try for tapas lovers. service is super duper accommodating."}
{"text":"Tried out Firefly because of the reviews (thanks fellow yelpers!) and I am totally a fan.  I'm sure the place gets crowded but we went on a late sunday afternoon.  They have a huge selection and their portion sizes are pretty good compared to some other small plates restaurats out there.  We had a group of 12 so I got to try out a lot of dishes, below is how I rank them.

YUM! I'd order again
filet mignon sliders
ceviche
firefly fries (garlic fries)
fried tilapia
calamari
passion fruit cheescake
posatas (?) its the potato dish
lobster tails

GOOD
stuffed mushroom
thai beef salad
duck roll
pork chops

sorry, no alcohol review.  had too much the night before, although my friends said the mimosas and sangria were yummy

Also, the service was EXCELLENT and the food came out relatively quickly considering how many dishes were ordered.  

for big groups, they don't split checks or are able to arrange your orders by who ordered.

Definitely a REPEAT customer. :)"}
{"text":"Having sent two weekends in a row on business in Las Vegas I had the opportunity to explore a number of the finest and also most expensive restaurants in the city.  What a total surprise and pleasure it was to dine at the Firefly.  A reasonably price restaurant with nothing but the freshest and finest food.
If not for a personal friend, who also happens to be a manager of one of the better hotels in Vegas, I would never have had to pleasure to experience their excellent food.  No wonder my friend said that the Firefire was one of his favorite places to dine.
Firefly is absolutely great and the tapas are amazing. Nahum, our server was so charming, informative and very friendly.  I felt like everyone there was dedicated to making our dining experience perfect.
If you are ever in Las Vegas this is a must stop.  It is just bit off the Strip but well worth the time."}
{"text":"This place was good, had a date here.. very crowded but still the atmosphere was nice, pretty noisy nonetheless food was really good, took a while to get to us, but very good!"}
{"text":"Went here last Saturday night. We sat outside on the patio. The patio was so dark, it made reading the menu difficult to say the least, and I have 20/20 vision. Next visit, I'll make sure to sit inside.

THE SERVICE - awful, confused, unattentive. Our tapas arrived long before our silverware and plates, or water. I tried flagging someone down 3 TIMES to no avail. Finally, I had to pop into the bar area to request plates, silverware, etc. Not very good. Then, it seemed like we had several waiters, none of which communicated with each other. After we were almost finished with round one, another waiter brought bread to to the table and seemed quite confused that we were almost finished with the plates already on our table. So, word to management.....  TRAINING AND COMMUNICATION.

THE FOOD - wonderful! We ordered the stuffed dates.... OMG!! We ordered an additional plate! We also ordered the pulpo, the lamb sausage, manchego Mac n cheese (holy lord that was good!), patatas bravas and a couple of  other plates that escape my mind and a pitcher of sangria. The sangria was pretty tasty.

The quality of the food saved the experience. I will return to Firefly, I only hope that the service is better, otherwise, that will be the end of it, good food can only take it so far if the overall experience is not that good."}
{"text":"Nice place inside and good food selection but they have the slowest service ever. There were around 20 people in the whole restaurant and our to go lunch order took 40-45 minutes. The excuse was that it got busy all of a sudden, lame. It's Father's Day on a Sunday and I can't imagine how much slower it'll be later on. Another party walked out to the front to pay their bill because they had to go and their service was slow too!"}
{"text":"Probably the best place to eat not on the Strip and the best tapas my family and I have ever had. 

Ambience: (4/5)* My family and I came in at an awkward time (around 3:30PM) so the place was practically empty and I can't say how it gets later in the evening. The lighting is also very dark and it was hard to read the menu. 

Service: (5/5) Our waitress/hostess was super nice and very helpful in offering recommendations since the menu was so huge and there was so much to choose from. In addition, they brought out the food in just the right intervals so just as you finished a plate another one would come out. 

Food: (5/5) Try as much as you can because we ordered around $200 of food and everything was delicious."}
{"text":"This location has a nice dim lit kind of ambiance perfect for a date or small group of friends. Staff was friendly and their service was great! Must try the combination paella! Pairs well with Victoria and a lime (which they have bottled)."}
{"text":"Firefly is one of the best restaurants I have eaten at in Las Vegas! I have been to Spain and had Tapas there. Firefly is the most authentic I have had in the States! Their menu is very extensive. Their lobster stuffed mushroom is simply delightful!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat. Just off the strip, trendy but not too over done. Good prices and a very distinct and wide selection of tapas and dishes to choose from.
It was a pretty busy night, but we only waited 10 minutes for a table. They do offer reservations.
I ordered the Lamb Skewer, the Firefly Fries and a couple cocktails while a friend ordered the Chirizo skewer and the Mini-Burgers. My dishes were great and the Margaritas I had were good, just a bit light on the alcohol but no real complaints there. My friend said his dishes tasted good and he was happy too.
Our server was quick and attentive, most things came out quickly or as wanted. The table was cleared quickly of finished dishes.
Really couldn't be happier. You should like this place, try it out!"}
{"text":"Mojitos + Tapas + Vegas + some more Mojitos = A Darn Good Time!!!They make the best mojitos--in bulk! That was the first thing we ordered when we sat down--a pitcher of \"paradise\" mojito please! And 4 infused vodka shots!!! That's how we started out the evening!

What else did we order? More mojitos! And of course, tapas!
Sausage Plate--ummm..not spectacular
Tuna Tartare--this was tasty too!
Ceviche of shrimp--more flavorful than Wynn's!
Stuffed dates--interesting! 1st time trying this one.
Mushroom tart--yum!!
Baked Brie
Terra y Mare skewers
Chicken + Chorizo stuffed mushroom
Paella--very good--no uncooked rice here!

We are definitely coming back the next times we're here. We left with 4 happy tummies and 4 happy smiles on our face...happily ever after!"}
{"text":"I recently used Firefly for my wedding cocktail reception.  We did a destination wedding with only 18 of us, so I wanted somewhere small, with drinks, and food for after the ceremony before we all took off to party on the strip.  This place fit the bill perfect.

The Food - It was amazing.  We only had the passed appetizers, but if this is any indication of their menu, then omg we are definitely going back for dinner the next time we're in Vegas. We had the bacon wrapped dates, the ham and cheese croquetas, and the steak and mushroom skewers.  Everything was delicious!  Our guests had nothing but good things to say about the food.

The atmosphere - The decor was nice and fit the theme of the restaurant.  Everything was clean and well presented.  The area where our reception took place was private and well decorated.

The staff -  The staff were awesome.  Everyone was polite, attentive, and very professional.  When we arrived at the reception there wasn't any seating or low tables.  I asked one of the staff if we could please get some chairs.  We got a full seating, I was so thankful as we had people who needed to sit and ladies in heels looking for a rest.

Booking our space was easy.  We worked with Regina who was friendly and responded to my emails quickly.  We were able to make last minute adjustments to the reception due to last minute changes with our guests.

Why 4 stars.  I held back a star due to how our reception ended.  As we were winding down staff started coming in and moving tables, clearing our cake, and bar service ended.  The clean up went on for about 10 minutes before the staff came over and very politely asked us to please wrap it up.  Our reception was from 5:30 - 7:30, and I checked my phone thinking we must have gone over our time.  It was 7:20 when I checked and I estimate they began cleaning up around 7:10.  While not the end of the world, I was a bit miffed that time that I had paid for was basically shorter than I expected as staff closed our reception down about 20 minutes early.  Again, not major, but if I were to ever do it again I would make it clear I want my space for the full time.

I still highly recommend this place for dining or an event.  I know that I will be back when in town again."}
{"text":"Firefly is always a must for me when visiting Vegas. Great food and good prices.
The atmosphere is very cool and lounge-like, with low lighting and great music playing. It's right off the strip, but it's more popular for locals, so the vibe is laid back.

Now for the food!

The salmon toasts, veggie empanadas, and calamari were excellent! I went with my sister and a friend, and we ordered 6 savory apps and 3 desserts to split, and we had plenty of dessert left over. I absolutely recommend the mini cheesecakes and lemon berry tarts for dessert, and the goat cheese and eggplant cannelloni as a starter. 

The house shandy is an excellent choice of drink; they mix up the traditional beer-and-lemonade cocktail by taking a light Belgian beer, mixing with fresh strawberry bitters, and adding a bit of Amaretto to top it off. So refreshing and so delicious!

We always hit up Firefly before a night on the strip; it's a tradition now to make it our first stop to kick off our annual Vegas weekend."}
{"text":"We had a party of 15 and service was great, very attentive waiters water and drinks are always filled. Food was delicious definitely coming back for more!"}
{"text":"YUMMMMM. One of the first restaurants I ate at when I moved to Vegas and I keep going back!  Best part.. they went from 1 to 3 locations and one just opened up a mile from our house!  Great tapas, good service, amazing drinks and decent prices for LV. 

The dates are my absolute favorite.. can you mess up something that has bacon, blue cheese and almonds in it? Not in my book! Other great choices include, but are definitely not limited to Camarones a la Diabla, Albondigas, Manchengo Mac n Cheese, Stuffed Peppers, Padron Peppers.  It's so hard to make a decision!"}
{"text":"I was visiting Las Vegas from LA, and was trying to find a good restaurant that wasn't a severely overpriced hotel \"experience\" where I would end up paying $50 for a mediocre appetizer.  

I found this place from the Yelp reviews and after glancing at their menu thought it looked perfect.  We went on a busy night but we were seated quickly and given plenty of attention from our waiter.  

The food was incredible.  Creative combinations and it was fairly enough priced that we could order 6 or 7 different things without feeling the sweat of the final bill.  I didn't have a single dish I didn't think was worthy of coming back for, and as we were on our way out the manager greeted us and asked about our experience.  After telling him exactly how much we enjoyed the food, he invited us to come back tomorrow and try some flights of their new dishes on the house.  Our schedule was already pretty booked, so we thanked him and declined, but the gesture was really nice.

This will be a permanent stop for future Vegas trips, and if they opened one in Los Angeles I would be there in seconds.  Skip the money-trap places surrounding the big hotels, this is way better."}
{"text":"Hands down on 5 stars for food and drink! However, I've noticed a decline in the customer service department. For the first time, I've left a 7% tip instead of my usual 20% tip. Step it up guys!"}
{"text":"Good is delivered fast. Order as you go. You cant go wrong with any item on this menu. Firefly rocks!"}
{"text":"The ambiance was exquisite carrying me to a land among the beaches of Peru dining on the delicacies of the local Quechua people with Coyotes Milk (Lemon Huice to cook the raw pesca (fish)) marinating the ceviche which upon entering my womb of a mouth felt like a thousand lovers making sweet French kiss genuine love to me."}
{"text":"Awe man, I used to eat here consistently for a solid 3 years. The health code fiasco wasn't something they ever recovered from. Plus they messed it up twice now. Great job guys! Not my go to anymore, sadly enough. They opened up a Taco joint where they used to be. Not bad! Worth checking out."}
{"text":"Honestly, not as good as their other location on Paradise. I think they cut corners on the food quite a bit to afford the amazing location. Worth it for the view though."}
{"text":"Amazing dinner! Food tasted fantastic, great portions, great atmosphere, good beer selection, very prompt service even on a very busy night! The GM even came by several times to make sure everything was ok - what a great guy. Will definitely eat here again!"}
{"text":"Headed to this location after driving by the Paradise spot and seeing a ton of people outside the front door. It was also busy here but at least we could wait indoors near a fire place. There were some less than optimal seating options near the constantly opening doors that we were crossing our fingers not to get called for. Luckily we got a table not near the doors(patio and front entry way). The service was fantastic, especially compared to my last two visits to the Paradise location. The staff was attentive and friendly. The dishes were mostly good but some were a little different that we expected based on previous experiences at Paradise. Most were as good or better but the Chorizo and Clams was the only one that was WAY OFF. The menu description even stated the sauce was made of white wine yet the sauce here was made of a heavy tomato base and came across more as a pasta sauce. The chorizo was the saving grace as I think it ranks right up there with bacon. Overall, I would return to this location based on service even though it is far from my home."}
{"text":"My husband and I were looking for a great place to have either a light dinner or tapas and a few drinks. The drinks and food are not only fantastic, our server Nahum was amazing! His recommendations were right on and his service was excellent considering we'd order each appetizer one at a time before deciding what we wanted next. The only note is if you are looking for a quiet place to have a romantic dinner this is probably not for you as it's a little loud inside the restaurant...it didn't bother us at all, but a warning if wanting a more intimate setting. The prices were great as we had 2 drinks from the bar each (so 4 total) and 4 small plates and our bill was only $65, a completely great deal in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I opened a Yelp account just so I could make this post. I have eaten at a number of the top rated Zagat restaurants in NY, Chicago and SF on expense account and have had nothing compelling to post. I travel to Vegas a couple times each year and have historically been reluctant to venture off the Strip for a meal. My perspective has been that with all the clones of NY and other nationally rated restaurants located in nearby casinos, why would I even bother taking a chance on a local venue? Well, my bias toward over-priced Strip restaurant clones turned out to be a poor one. We recently visited Firefly Tapas Kitchen & Bar on Paradise, less than 5 minutes drive or cab ride from the Strip. The previous nights we had eaten at Delmonico in the Venetian and Il Mulino in the Forum Shops, 2 nationally recognized restaurants. Firefly blew these restaurants away! 

1) The service is outstanding - every time we wanted to order refills of Sangria or a new round of tapas our server was there to help. The food arrived at our table surprisingly fast. 

2) The prices are very reasonable. We spent less than  1/2 of what our Delmonico and Il Mulino meals cost and received just as high quality of food! 

3) The atmosphere is very enjoyable - Firefly has a bustling, exciting, hip vibe with both young and old patrons - a great mix! If you're looking for a fancy, snooty restaurant feel, this isn't for you.

4) The food is terrific. Firefly offers a menu filled with unique offerings and tastes that you may not have enjoyed before - it will be worth your while to order items such as the stuffed dates with bacon, shrimp diablo, thai beef salad and filet mignon sliders. I won't bother detailing all the items we loved - many other posts take care of that here.

Don't question the high Yelp reviews for this restaurant - the reviews are absolutely accurate. Next time you're thinking of eating on the Strip at an overpriced casino restaurant, take 5 minutes and head over to Firefly for a better, much more reasonably priced meal. And if you're hesitant to leave the Strip, order yourself a stretch limousine for the trip back and forth - you'll still save tons of money compared to the alternative restaurants on the Strip and likely enjoy your meal even more!"}
{"text":"I am definitely a fan and will be back to try more of the menu. You have to try the stuffed dates and the shrimp ceviche.  Both are excellent. As far as cocktails go you can't go wrong with the blood Orange mohito.  This is a great place to take a date after sundown because of the huge window facing fremont st."}
{"text":"we were in Vegas with a few friends and we were looking for somewhere nice and relaxing to have a great and tasting dinner. we found firefly on yelp,read the reviews and saw the pics and I was convinced.. We made a reservation which was super convenient, we were seated within 15 minutes..place has a very trendy vibe,bar area was very appealing,and it is more on the louder side but it's only cause everyone is genuinely enjoying themselves... We ordered a few beers and a pitcher of sangria,very very tasty and refreshing.. We ordered tapas, our faves were the ceviche ,and lamb chops= super yummy.. The reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 was the service, our waiter seemed to have forgotten about us by mid dinner. Overall a pretty good experience, and I will definitely come back when in town."}
{"text":"Excellent place for lunch or dinner. It has become my go to place when in Vegas. Great sangrias and great food. You'll love the tuna tartar; highly recommend the pulpo asado and chorizo clama. Looking for something bigger than their tapas, they also make an excellent paella. There so much positives I can say, but just go try it and see for yourself."}
{"text":"I was so excited to take my mother-in-law to Firefly for her 70th birthday, but the restaurant does not take reservations for parties smaller than 10 people on the weekends. 

I generally don't ask for, or expect, special treatment, but I was so disappointed when they wouldn't make this small concession after saying the wait could be as long as an hour."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place!!! It is \"a must\" if you like tapas! I am obsessed with the blood orange mojitos! Some tasty plates we order: sliders, abondigas, tortilla espanola, skewers, and tres leches... just to name a few. 

This is the culinary highlight of my Vegas trips!"}
{"text":"Absolutely and unbelievable experience. Our first night in Vegas a local couple said we had to try Firefly's Happy Hour. So we went expecting good food, good drinks and good prices. We got Great Food, Great Drinks at Great Prices. I read a few negative reviews and the things they are complaining about are hilarious. Yeah, if you are in a hurry and are looking to get served fast and eat fast then go to mcdonalds  this place is slow paced and very relaxing just like little eateries in spain. If you are complaining about salty food and how your restaurant is so much better, this is their third location with an array of tapas, they are doing fine without your praise. Lastly I have had some Tasty Sangria in my day and Firefly's is right up there with the best. Half off Pitchers during Happy Hour need I say more"}
{"text":"Firefly is by far the best place I have ever eaten at in Vegas. PERIOD. It's a hidden gem visited by many locals and a place where you can practically order anything on the menu and not be disappointed. Living in Los Angeles, whenever I happen to come to visit Vegas this is always the first place on my to do list. The food and service are exceptional and always consistent. The prices are very reasonable for the quality of food!! This place is perfect to come with family and friends.. Considering that it's a tapas style restaurant everything could be easily shared and leave you completely full and satisfied. Make sure to call in advance to make a reservation as the place gets very busy late in the evenings.. Especially weekends. The crowd favorites seem to be the stuffed dates, ceviche, baked goat cheese, tuna tartare, firefly fries, and the Camarones A La Diabla! I can't even get started with the Garlic Bread that they serve complimentary once you arrive.. HEAVEN! If your happening to question coming to this restaurant don't even think about it for one more second! Just go.. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"DIVINE!!!
Best Tapas EVER, ties with the classy stuff in Barcelona!!! 
And I've seen a few, trust me!!!
DEEEVINEEEE!!!"}
{"text":"A-MAZING!!! Great atmosphere, great service(thanks Michelle!), food is familiar yet different and absolutely yummy!"}
{"text":"We liked this place so much that we ate here three times in two days.  Lots of traditional Spanish foods & creative small plates to choose from.  Do not miss the bacon wrapped dates, the sangria, the mojitos, or the banana nutella sandwiches.  Easy cab ride & totally worth leaving the strip."}
{"text":"This is a great place to go if you want to get away from the Strip but you still want an upbeat atmosphere. The sangria was delicious and I loved the ceviche. The empanadas were a bit on the greasy side but they weren't terribly disappointing. This is a great place for a date. It has a local feel but it's just artificial enough to feel like the Vegas you know and love. The happy hour is fantastic but I wasn't able to make it in time. Next time I'm in town I'll definitely make another stop."}
{"text":"Firefly is a great place to meet someone for a bite to eat that is staying on the strip.  It's close to the strip. The food is good.  I dined on the outside patio and was surprised that the street noise was minimal.  My sister and I could converse in normal voice.  The service was just right and not over-attentive.  When you want something different from the status quo, try this place.

{"text":"Awesome Awesome Awesome!!! Firefly's is delicous!!! Great food, great enviroment, great drinks, friendly and great service! What more can a girl ask for? The food here can only be described as orgasmic!!! Im a vegetarian, so it's great to go to a place that has delicous food for EVERYONE! Trust me... the food IS ORGASMIC!"}
{"text":"My hubby and I love spanish tapas!! Its hard to find a reasonably priced in Los Angeles or Orange County California. So I was excited and we enjoyed all the food immensely. They were even very considerate of my hubby's shrimp allergy and made the paella with a chicken/beef broth ( I think). Next time we are in LV we will absolutely eat there. I also enjoyed because my daughter was able to eat a variety of things too."}
{"text":"Excellent place for tapas !   Came here on a Sunday and ordered off the Brunch menu !   Definitely enjoyed the food as well as the atmosphere!  Will be back again ! Thank you :)"}
{"text":"Wow! We were there last night and the food, service and ambience was fabulous! Only here for a week and I hope to hit Firefly again"}
{"text":"I love the food and mojitos. The price is very affordable and the service is friendly."}
{"text":"Great experience. 

We had a group of 25. So, automatically that would be a change for most restaurants. In addition our dinner was the same time as day one of the CES Tradeshow. Consindering this Tradeshow is the largest in Vegas and the close proximaty of the convention center we could have been in for a chalenge. 
Even with the situation at hand. The restaurant did an amazing job. 
Service was fast and friendly. Food was great taisting and timely. 
If you are new to this restaurant then:
TAPAS style
Hip dark atmosphere 
$20 to $50 a person pending appetite. 

Very close to the strip. 
Most locals and tourists have it in their dining rotation. 

They are Especially known for their sangria."}
{"text":"I am a lover of the original Firefly (so much so that I was there 3  times in a week and a half recently)- so when I heard the new, much closer location in Summerlin was open- I brought my out of town guests here for some nibbles.

I used to visit this building years ago when it was Z Tejas, and the new decor is right in line with the Firefly brand. Love the painted walls and the layout is not too crowded and not as loud. I would suggest a long communal table- truly Spanish style!

Hostess I called was much friendlier and more helpful than original location, and we had no wait to be seated (a first!) The dinner rush was subsiding, as it was after 9pm, but a fair amount of tables were still there- only a few were empty.

We ordered all of our regular items and most were really good. There is always a learning curve at any new place, and I took that in to account in this review.

Garden Variety Salad- smaller than the original location and not as many \"goodies\" but still very edible!

Boquerones (Anchovy toast)- Good but bread not toasted- had to send back.  Beautiful presentation and this cook likes to use his sauce bottles;)

Artichoke toast- Bread not toasted (really? it's on the menu as toast) and there was a little push back from the waiter when I sent them back to be toasted. Oil and dressing were fanstastic on these- much more flavorful than the original!

Mac n Cheese- excellent!

Stuffed Chilis- Amazing and on par with the original location.

Staff
Waiter had too many tables and wasn't all that attentive. He wasn't as familiar with the menu as I would have hoped- but again, they just opened. Luckily for him, he had good support.

Busboy- AMAZING! If he wasn't trained at the original location, I would be surprised. He was very attentive and bent over backwards to make sure our meal was perfect after we sent back the toast(s).

Manager?- there was someone in a suit flittering around, not sure who he was, but he didn't stop and address the table- only the staff when we sent something back. Would have been nice for him to have received our feedback personally, not just from the staff. No harm done though, and I was glad to see someone was there.

Overall- I can't wait for this place to gain some more experience and really shine! I will go back, I did enjoy the meal and wine and wouldn't hesitate to send friends there, with the caveat that they are still working out the kinks."}
{"text":"Loved the pulpo asado, bacon wrapped dates and tuna tartar. We are going back for lunch tomorrow to try more. There were mostly locals there, so we think we found a gem near the strip. After dropping $40 for two in the food court at Caesar's on nasty-tasting crap, this was a very pleasant surprise!"}
{"text":"Thank you fellow Yelpers for another super recommendation!!  The bf and I took a client and his wife to dinner on Monday evening.  We had reservations and were seated right away.  They have quite an extensive tapas list and the prices are ridiculous!  Ridiculously LOW that is!!

We ordered 9 tapas plates - each plate had 3 items on it with the exception of the taters and the mac and cheese plate.  We also ordered 3 desserts and had 4 glasses of sangria (total, not each...geez, we aren't lushes...anymore).  Everything was delish!!!   The best part was that  the bill was just a tad over $100.  If we would have had this meal at home it would have been almost double that.

There is a meat market-ish sort of vibe inside at the bar so if you are looking to pick up a piece of ass and a manchego cheese and serrano ham dish while you are at it, check Firefly out!"}
{"text":"This was my second time there.  It was pretty good.  I went with a big group of people.  It was pretty busy, so they escorted us to their other lounge location.  Most of the party ordered tapas.  Their fries and stuffed jalepenos were pretty good.  My friend got a pitcher of White Sangria which was really good.  I liked it a lot better than the one from Marbellas.  The White Sangria has pears, wine and brandy.  They marinate the sangria for a minimum of 3 days.  I'm not a fan of alcohol, but this one tasted pretty good.  It was a little bit bitter from the alcohol.  I'm still fairly new to drinking, so I can taste alcohol really easily.  My other friends said it was good. I tried sips of the paradise mojito and the blood orange mojito.  The paradise one was really really good.  I could taste coconut in it while the blood orange was tartier and too strong for my taste.  

I want to go again and try more appetizers and different drinks.  :D"}
{"text":"the WORST MEAL EVER! btw, i wrote a much more detailed review, which mysteriously disappeared.

my boyfriend got food poisoning here. it ruined out trip. the food was overpriced and a JOKE. like a chain restaurant, straight out of a can. the mushroom tart was literally canned mushrooms in that sauce that comes in a can dumped over a reheated frozen triangle of pillsbury puff pastry.

perhaps the owners should get out of vegas and travel to spain or at least a few spanish restaurants before claiming to serve tapas food.

STAY AWAY!!!"}
{"text":"So I came back to Firefly with my two daughters to give this place a second try - and I've got to say, we were blown away!

To start, the service was wonderful, just as it was before. Every time we went through a glass of our drink, it was replaced almost before we even noticed! The waiters were so attentive, and always came in with friendly expressions. We were even able to meet the chef (James), who explained some of the concepts behind the dishes and entertained us. Everything was just perfect as far as service was concerned.
 
And now for the greatness of it all - the food! We really enjoyed some of their signature tapas, such as the skewers with the grilled beef and shrimp (called Terra y Mare skewers on their menu), and the tomato soup with the grilled cheese sandwich (called Tomato basil soup on the menu). And let me tell you- that was no ordinary grilled cheese sandwich! It was simply amazing on its own, and definitely going on my list of favorites! The outside was crispy, the bread was so tasty, and the brie cheese on the inside just completed the deal. We will be craving it again, that's for sure. And for some other tapas that get noteworthy mention: the tuna-stuffed red pepper on a thin taro chip (called Tuna peppers), and the bacon-rolled dates in red wine sauce (called Stuffed dates). The Tuna peppers made any of our apprehensions about cold tapas disappear in an instant- It was tasty, it was fun, and it was wonderful to snack on! And perhaps best of all, it was unique. As for the bacon-rolled dates, you've just got to taste it to believe it- We weren't very fond of dates, until we tried this dish! And that's not to say that it tasted primarily like dates, but actually quite the opposite: it made us realize that it was possible to make dates appeal to people who weren't keen on them to begin with.

As a side note for fans of more traditional food: they make an awesome macaroni and cheese dish. You can't go wrong with it, and it's one of the best mac&cheese dishes we've ever tasted!

And anyways, I think by now, you already get what I'm saying: the tapas here are excellent if you're willing to give them a fair try!

And what I mean by that is: maybe not all of them will match your tastebuds, but you've gotta find those that cater to your taste. And with a selection as varied as that of Firefly, you definitely have a chance at finding \"the one,\" or \"ones\" in our case!

As you may already know: we didn't hit a home run the first time we went to this place, and even had a couple dishes fall through the second time: we didn't dig the spiciness of the spicy shrimp tapas (Camarones a la diabla), nor were we huge fans of the Padron peppers. However, with the fulfillment we received from the other tapas mentioned above, one or two tapas like these were mere bumps in our road to satisfaction.

Finally, we got to taste their specialty Paella. And it was absolutely wonderful. The flavor of the tomatoes and peppers blended with the wholesomeness of the rice, and mixed with our favorite seafood, just made it an absolutely worthwhile dish, that we only wish we could fit into our stomachs. Quick tip: believe the menu when it says it could serve six.

Bottom line: Come with an empty stomach. Try as many items as you can. Leave as a changed person with a satiated appetite and a somewhat wider horizon, wishing you'd done it sooner. And that's all I have to say. Thanks for reading."}
{"text":"I dig this place.  Tons of selection and each one seems outstanding.  Great atmosphere.  Not much into Sangria, but the menu is diverse enough to warrant the reputation.  Will be back."}
{"text":"I loved this restaurant! The environment was very conducive for a Bachelorette party. We were able to laugh, joke, talk, and not worry about disturbing others. I loved the pitchers of Mojitos and Sangria. VERY affordable. The waiting staff was very friendly and very quick in their service. I loved the way they delivered the food....food for every taste bud. Also, if you like trying new things..this was FREAKIN awesome!  Definitely a place I would go back to."}
{"text":"Firefly is my favorite place in Vegas for dinner... If you love tapas, or have never tried it, this is the place to go. You can make reservations online or call the restaurant ahead of time to reserve seating. I love their Shrimp Ceviche and Empanadas! 

Draw backs to this place- it's a small venue, so expect to be packed into a small table and the service is hit or miss. Otherwise, the food is awesome and worth the trip off the strip!"}
{"text":"Firefly on Paradise, has the perfect combination when it comes to  food, ambiance and music.  Sitting outside on the patio was great to enjoy the fabulous Spring weather that we have been having.. As we are 'Vegan', Firefly always has a good choice for us. We ordered our favorite dishes.
- Warm spinach salad (without feta cheese)
- Patatas bravas (aioli sauce replaced with marinara sauce)

Firefly is a great place to socialize.. 2 thumbs up!!"}
{"text":"Walking into the new location, it just didn't feel like Firefly. There was no squeezing up to the bar, waiting outside, or squeezing you way through the place on the way to your table.  It certainly lost its coziness.  My friend and I had a lengthy discussion noting all of the differences and how we didn't know how to feel as 'it's just not what it used to be'

Then the bacon stuffed dates came out, and all of a sudden, it felt like Firefly again, and we started to appreciate all the improvements including the significantly larger space and improved decor.  Food and Booze were still as good as ever."}
{"text":"omg this is the best place I have ever eaten. every dish was better than the last. great drinks. great service. I go back everytime I am in town."}
{"text":"A good tad bit noisy, but awesome food at great pricing.  The drinks were awesome as well; not watered down and incredibly great pricing.  (Example:  we paid $11 for a glass of cranberry& vodka and a Midori sour.  2 hours later, we paid double for the exact same drinks at a Latin Club although the drinks weren't bigger or better tasting). The Ceviche was amazing.  The Spicy Shrimp tasted perfectly sweet yet had a nice follow up \"bite\" lol.  The stuffed dates lived up to their reputation.  We are definitely coming back to this place!!!"}
{"text":"Love Love Love this place! One of our favorite spots in Vegas!  We always brought friends and family here when they came to visit! 

The atmosphere is great, food is great, service isn't the greatest but it won't ruin your experience! 

Must try the Stuffed Dates, the firefries, and the tapas Yum Yum Yum!! The Sangria's are awesome, and most (but not all) of the Mojitos are amazing! Stay away from the tomato soup and grilled cheese sandwhich!

Make reservations! It's ALWAYS crouded and there is ALWAYS a wait no matter what day or time!"}
{"text":"We were told that there would be a 30min wait for a party of 2. We were told that we could wait in the bar area, but not at the tables. The bar itself was full, so we were forced to stand by the window next to the bus staff trays full of dirty dishes. We were eventually seated in the main dining area where the acoustics were so bad that we couldn't hear our server.

We ordered the Surf and Turf Skewers, and none of the shrimp were de-veined. The prep cook apparently sliced all of the shrimp down the wrong side, leaving the waste vein intact. 

We also ordered the almond stuffed dates, and one of the five dates contained a date pit rather than an almond. It seemed as though the kitchen staff had no knowledge of how to properly clean these two items.

To top it off, a bachelorette party equipped with a male blowup doll were seated near us and across from a woman and a 10 year old or so boy. I know this is Vegas, but there's a time and place to allow that sort of thing. An all ages dining establishment during peak hours doesn't seem like the best time or place."}
{"text":"Amazing food, amazing sangria. Lobster corn dogs blew my mind. Definitely try the place"}
{"text":"Everything I ate was delicious. I had shrimp tempura, lamb chops, and dates."}
{"text":"We went to Firefly while I was visiting my parents who had just moved to Vegas about a year and a half ago.  They charged me with trying to find some good local spots away from the strip.  Firefly passed with flying colors.

We were there during the early portion of happy hour and sat in the bar area where there were couches and low tables.  It was a super loungy feel that I really like.  Towards the end of happy hour the place did get really busy, but the service never suffered.  The pitchers of yummy sangria were half off...so we enjoyed 3 :)  The variety of tapas was superior to many places I have been with a large range of veggie items.  I also liked that there was a range from super inexpensive to fancy...something for every budget.  My favorite was the Manchego Mac and Cheese and the stuffed Pasilla Peppers.  I also really liked the lobster escargot, and I tried the Anchovy toasts that my Dad ordered and actually liked them (I hate Anchovy)...the Anchovy was fresh, and didn't taste or like the Anchovy you get in many dishes or on pizza.  My parents loved the Bacon wrapped Dates (I don't eat bacon so I couldn't partake but they looked and smelled amazing)  They had also brought out complimentary bread with almod butter and green olives that were of super good quality. 

The staff was awesome!  We never had to pour our own Sangria from the pitchers.  As soon as our glasses were getting a little low, our waiter would rush over and fill them up again.  He was really friendly and very attentive, as we ordered just a few plates and finished them before ordering a 2nd and 3rd round.  Our table was also serviced by several other young men who would clear plates or fill water glasses.  There was never that moment during the meal when you are like \"where is the waiter, I need water...or sangria...or food...etc\".  

I don't much like Vegas, but I feel like I will visit my parents more often, just so that we can go to Firefly :)"}
{"text":"The secret is out, Firefly is a must go to place if you're living in Vegas or just visiting. If you're looking for a tapas place that is fun, hip and great for get togethers, you can't go wrong with Firefly. 

I've been here so many times, despite what my check in says, I'm a regular. At one point, I think I was obsess with this place. Anyway, I've been here for lunch-ish (2pm), dinner and late nights. I love, love, love that I can come here after work and have a great meal and some drinks. 

Everything on their menu is pretty much amazing. But here's my go to list. You can try them yourself or be adventurous and try something new. The top of the list is what I order every time I'm there and the bottom ones are ones I've tried and thought it was fantastic as well.

Apple/manchego salad: Apple and cheese, a winer's delight. Crispy granny smith apples cut up like matchsticks paired with a nutty and salty flavorful manchego cheese. If you don't know what manchego cheese is, it's the spanish version of a parmesan cheese. It's nutty, definitely a little salty and often firm but not hard like a parm. Delicious is all you need to know. This is a salad that I have to have every time.

Boquerones: Ahhhhhhhhhh, white anchovies, basil, bread, lemon, what else is there? Unlike regular anchovies, the white ones are milder in flavor, not salty and wonderfully yummy. Served on sliced baguette with basil and I think chili oil. Whatever, it's a reminder of tapas can be so fun and mouth watering. Great to dish to share, but I don't recommend it.

Steamed mussel: Talk about calories. You're going to need to save the room for these. The broth that it comes in, make sure you save some bread because you're going to want to soak it up with it. It's creamy, buttery and a little bit curried. 

Veggie empanadas: Deep fired and packed with flavors. The meat ones are good, but I think the veggie ones are better.

Big bowl of spinach salad: There's spinach, so it's healthy, right? Yes! you literally get a big bowl of this fresh salad that has obviously spinach and these roasted peppers, artichokes and fried onions and the dressing that just ties is all together.

Bacon wrapped dates: Sweet and salty and topped with a little bleu cheese is all I need to say. But you need to eat them as soon as they arrive because they're not as good when they're cold and the bacon gets hard.

Patron peppers: Great little peppers to have on the side. Most of the are mild but if you get lucky or unlucky to some, you'll get one that really packs some heat. 

There's too much to say here. Just get out and try it because it's a must try spot for everyone. And don't forget to get a drink with that, especially the sangria. 

Ciao and until next time, happy eating everyone :)"}
{"text":"Great place to be loud and socialize. Portions are small and cost between 3 to 10 for tapas, and 12 to 20 for entrees. There is dessert but we never try it cuz we get filled up fast on tapas."}
{"text":"I literally go here every time I'm in Vegas for the bacon-wrapped dates. They are perfection. If you want some quality and sharable food, you have to go here. It's just a mile down from the Convention Center, so it does get busy when tradeshows are in town, but it's still possible to get reservations same day. It's a nice change to the steakhouses everywhere. :)"}
{"text":"based on single dinner at the bar. 

i was on a business trip and ended up here based on yelp recomendations from my yelp peeps back home. it was a tuesday night, but the place was still pretty busy. i ordered the chorizo clams, grlled octopus, fries, and a sangria. PLENTY of food for one.  

the fries came out quick and the sangria was poured instantly. the octopus was excellent. the clams, well, had too much chorizo. or should i say, the chorizo didnt have enough clams. it was more of a chorizo dish than a clam dish. kind of overwhelming when expecting clams, but don't get me wrong, i'll order it again. 

overall bill was 30$ and i was stuffed. I ddnt finish the fries. id definitely go back, but would rather share the food with some company and get a chance to try more menu items..."}
{"text":"I celebrated my b-day there and the place was just fantastic.  They have great food and the staff is just super.  The bartender, Aaron, went out of his way to accommodate us when we told him we were short on time and just needed to sit anywhere.  He brought us an extra stool and we were able to enjoy a great meal right at the bar.  Aaron made sure that every dish we ordered arrived quickly and everything tasted great.   I am definitely coming back to this place and would highly recommend it to everyone, especially if you're tired of overpriced and often mediocre places on the strip.  And say hi to Aaron as well, I forgot to mention, he makes terrific drinks."}
{"text":"This was a good place - to get off the strip and do something different in Vegas. I can't rave about any of the tapas. They were all fine, but nothing really great. The filet mignon sliders came highly reccomended - I am not sure why. Overcooked hamburger was what I tasted, not a great deal of seasoning. I wanted more - of something else. And I never really got it.  The sangria was good as well - but nothing exceptional. 
So the bill was reasonable - that was nice. But this place could be so much better - better food, nicer staff. Give it a try, maybe it was a bad night to be there. Oh and PS - there were tons of cougars there. Tons."}
{"text":"Ummmm... racism is wrong. I don't like writing bad reviews. Before I start, this review is not about the food -- which was excellent. The one star review is about several members of the staff. 

I was there on my birthday, dressed up in a pretty dress and my guy friend was wearing a nicely pressed button down shirt. I'm pointing this out because the staff treated us like we were filthy street people. The staff was literally fawning over every table around where my friend and I were sitting -- yet they were beyond rude to us. At least four times they tried to take plates away long before we were finished, brought the check before we asked for it and while we were still eating, then trying to take the plates away again while there was still food on them! Two nearby tables had the opposite experience. The waitstaff was attentive, smiling, and even engaged in polite little chats. I thought maybe they were the owners or friends of owners... until I realized the waitstaff was being that way with almost every single other table! They were being NICE to them!

Here is the sad fact: My friend and I are not Latino, sorry but there is no other way to say it. We are white people and there were only a handful in the entire restaurant. VERY DISAPPOINTING to be treated that way because of our skin color. As delicious as the food was, I will never go back to Firefly. 

It was when we were leaving that I realized what was going on. Here is why: someone had accidentally left a car key near the front door. So I walked it over to the bartender who wasn't even taking an order or making a drink -- he looked at me with a quick little nasty expression, then ignored me. All I was trying to do was return someone's lost key. I had NO other interactions in the bar area while at Firefly, so there was zero reason why the bartender would give me a dirty look."}
{"text":"This was so good! I was feeling a little chilly, so I had the tomato basil soup. I was not disappointed!"}
{"text":"Murda'd nearly the whole menu from the Empandas to the Chocolate \"tres leches\" cake.  Simply scrumptious!"}
{"text":"I don't know if you could even call this place a local secret anymore! If you haven't heard about it, GO TRY IT. You won't be disappointed. I used to live in Vegas years ago and the quality and consistency of the food hasn't changed at all. Yelp makes it easy for you too, order what everyone is raving about. There's a reason for that.

It's Spanish tapas style food so bring your friends and order a bunch! I personally like the Manchego Mac n' Cheese, Filet Mignon Sliders, Duck rolls, Mussels, and the Tuna Tartare. 

BUT...

If there is one thing that you MUST ORDER, get a pitcher (regardless of how thirsty you are) of the RED SANGRIA. You're welcome.

They have their own parking lot but cab it if you're going to drink, use yelp to make reservations through Open Table, be hungry, blah blah blah whatever, just do the red sangria."}
{"text":"My go-to-place when friends visit from out of town.  Bacon wrapped dates, ham & cheese croquetas, shrimp diablo and blood orange mojitos are personal favs."}
{"text":"Came through after reading all the amazing reviews with a group of 12 people in town for a conference. The service was outstanding and the food was even better. The ribs fell off the bone and the Mac and cheese was killer. One of the tapas we ordered came out very late, but the staff took care of us and even brought out dessert for one of our party who had a birthday. If you only have one night in town and have a group of people I HIGHLY recommend Firefly.  Also we let them know we needed separate checks ahead of time and it was no problem."}
{"text":"This place is overly rated from a locals standpoint, for those of you out of towners that like a party scene this might be the place for you folks. This might be a place to get a quick bite before or after clubbing. The food is just so so, not great. The portion are not satisfying for the price you have to pay per dish. As for the Sangria, it's alcohol and what is there not to like about anything that's mixed with alcohol....it's so overly advertised by some of the yelpers. Been here a couple of times with friends from out of town....and can't really say....\"ummm I remember that was good you gotta try it!\" Don't really have a dish that you have to go back for more of. The steak skewer was dry, the mushroom with puff patry was tasteless, the Firefly Fries was soggy, if you have a big party your gonna have to order a couple of orders per dish if you want enough to go around. The music of this place is loud that you'll have to shout across the table to talk to your friends and the place is so dim that you have to be careful of what your putting into your mouth. Overall, the service was poor. The hostesses working there seems to have some kind of attitude problem...they first ask you if you have a reservation to make it seems like you should know better to make one next time ...cause we're sooooo busy!"}
{"text":"My favorite place for Happy Hour!!! The bartenders are entertaining, and curvaceous.  If you don't believe me just ask for Haley.  Food and cocktails are not the only thing that is appealing for happy hour. Stop by and see for yourself!"}
{"text":"I ate here twice while visiting Las Vegas in Spring 2013 at the recommendation of my friends who live locally. I enjoyed the food and drinks. But when I went to post my review, I read about the food poisoning incident which closed the place. So i downgraded my rating from a 4 star to 3 star. I hope they find the source of the salmonella and correct the problem. Not good."}
{"text":"We chose this restaurant based in the Yelp reviews. The first plates we ordered were the stuffed dates and ham&cheese croquetas. The dates as mentioned numerous times on Yelp were great and I don't like blue cheese. The croquetas were okay. They were more like a cheese stick and I wouldn't order them again. Next we ordered chorizo plate and chicken skewers. Chorizo plate was good with thinly sliced cold cuts, mini pickles, and capers. The roasted garlic cream sauce on the chicken skewers was very tasty. The assortment of vegetables with the skewers was also very good. Lastly, we ordered the flan and flourless chocolate cake. Both deserts were very tasty and we would order them again."}
{"text":"The best in las Vegas.... I love it their customer service is awsome... I order \"camarones a la diabla\"... I been a customer since 2 years ago. I always go 2 times a month..."}
{"text":"My only complaint about this restaurant is that it's not located right next to my house!   We normally visit Cafe Ba-ba-Reeba on the Strip when we go to Vegas because the food was great and we had our wedding reception there.  Unfortunately, no one else appreciated it as much as us because they closed Ba-ba-reeba down and put some boring Mexican food place there.  My husband suggested we go to Firefly instead, and WOW - this is the best tapas EVER!  We tried 8 items total, including a salad, and every single thing was incredible.  I only wish I hadn't been so full because I would have ordered even more.  Our waiter was very friendly, and there are multiple people running food and helping out so we were never wanting.  The atmosphere was cool and lively without being too much.  Prices are great too - our entire bill with food, a pitcher of sangria (yum!), and tip was right around 100 bucks.  We will definitely go here again - and you should too!"}
{"text":"Always delighted to come here with great company. The attention, the sparkling sangria and tapas are great. Highly recommend. Let this Latin night get started. Woot woot!"}
{"text":"Excellent small plates, especially for a late night meal. My search for a Mexican place on my GPS unit came up with this place,  and although it is obviously not a Mexican place, I was pleasantly surprised.
 
Located inside a strip mall ( like everything else in Las Vegas), they have a small patio, which we dined on. We arrived around 1 AM and received prompt, very friendly service. I figured when we arrived so late, with the kitchen closing at 1:30, we would be rushed to order. In fact, it was exactly the opposite. After we ordered, the server told us to hold on to a menu, should we decide that we wanted to try something else, which indeed we did.

The three of us shared several small plates, including the mushroom/steak skewers, empanadas (my favorite), shrimp in chile sauce (a close second),  meatballs, cream cheese stuffed peppers and a warm spinach salad, all delicious.  Not too expensive (all the above plus a martini and a margarita for around $70 plus tip), and for a late night meal, it is a new favorite for me!"}
{"text":"I eaten at this firefly 3 times and still don't really understand the buzz over it.  All the food items i've tried are very decent tasting.  But i'd say the portions are too small in relation to the prices.  I would need to spend about 50 or 60 bucks to satisfy my appetite here.  I do love the outside deck and eating/drinking in the fresh springtime weather.  I'd recommend this place for drinks and snacks or if you want a small meal."}
{"text":"Yummy food, great ambiance, terrific service. I will be back!

Loved all dishes, but the apple manchego salad is DA BOMB!"}
{"text":"I just cannot say enough about this place. Do yourself a favor and leave the strip and go find this place. It is not far from the strip, but far enough away that you don't pay ridiculous prices and don't deal with 20 year old obnoxious drunks.
Came here with my wife for Valentines Day and were seated promptly. It was happy hour, so we had the most amazing sangria and cosmo, and a few rounds of them. We also tried their house-made infused vodka, which was really quite something.
The tapas is what makes this place 5 stars, but the wait staff is also extraordinary. Extremely attentive, we never went without drinks, water or anything. Top notch. For tapas we ordered stuffed dates, tomato soup which came with a brie grilled cheese sandwich, veggie empanada, mac and cheese made with manchego cheese, mini filet mignon, herb cheese, roast potato, mushrooms and red wine sauce and shrimp tempura. Keep in mind it is tapas, so although it seems like a ton of food, it was just right. I can't say enough about the food. This meal was the highlight of my trip to Vegas. Intimate, not noisy, some of the best food that I have ever had and great waitstaff. Don't skip this place!"}
{"text":"This place is definitely one of the must go places in Vegas. All their dishes are small so you can try tons of dishes. You have to get the bacon wrapped stuffed dates and the sangria. The steak is huge a good portion and cooked to the proper doneness (medium rare)!! And they start you off on the best note with their delicious compound butter. Atmosphere is loud, fun and exciting! Staff was really good, friendly and helpful, even to my party of 15."}
{"text":"I love that place! It is my Fav! Their sparkling sangria is the best!!!"}
{"text":"Went to brunch today with friends' We had all different tapas. Especially Wed the hwevos rancheros and vergie benedict
ps Love You Eduardo"}
{"text":"Couple of my friends who lives in Vegas highly this tapa restaurant.

So we just flew in late night, I'm thinking this will be a perfect place for late night snack.  So my husband and I went to this very cool restaurant around 11ish pm.  They got some sofa area, very casual plus some latino music.  It's a very nice place for hanging out with friends for dinner or party.

My top 2 choices are tuna tartare and stuffed dates.  I usually don't like to eat dates, but they made very decilous.  They use almond to replace the seend which is very neat and the bacon wraped around the sweet dates.  Very nice!

I also tried Filet Mignon, Terra y Mare Skewer, Manchego Mac and Cheese.  They are not bad.  I will definitely come back again with my friend.  She said I gotta try the mussels the next time :)"}
{"text":"Loved the stuffed dates! The atmosphere was a refreshing change from all the hotel restaurants."}
{"text":"Great place to hang out with friends and have some drinks. Love the menu. Lots of varieties to choose from. Had the smoke salmon toast and it was delicious. The mango tuna skewers is not bad  if you like something different and unique. Must have fireflies fries too. I definitely will come back with my friends when I'm in town."}
{"text":"Great fun, & great food. Usually crowded so get there early. Our group tried 4 different entries, and they were all good."}
{"text":"Firefly has delicious and varied tapas (small plates), which is a great way to do dinner. Their sangria is refreshing and cold on a hot day, with the ice that some reviewers complain about adding a bit of welcome hydration.

But one of the best reasons to come here is for the lovely shaded patio just off the Strip. For a city known for its great weather during much of the year, it's surprisingly difficult to find outdoor seating in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Disappointed. First time went there on Friday night.. A lot of people, but we made reservation, we got our table right away once we walked in, which is very good. The flavor of the food was decent, but either they have made some shortcut of that night or that's normal for them, certain food wasn't fresh, 

warm spinach salad - there are some mushy and old spinach leaves.
steam mussels - not bad, but the red curry was missing some hearty flavor to it.  
stuffed mushroom - taste decent
meatball - texture was good.
babyback ribs - the sauce/glaze was pretty good, but the texture was not, it seems like the ribs have been refrigerated for a long time and get forgotten.
lamb chop - this is fine
filet mignon sliders - overbooked, dry and the fries/onion strings was so soggy, it looks like microwave from overnight onion strings. 
Baked tetilla - a bit bland, need a bit more seasoning."}
{"text":"Love the food and drinks, but could someone please turn the music down!  You have to yell to the person sitting right next to you to be heard.  Would have stayed longer and ordered more, but it was just too noisy."}
{"text":"I brought a visiting girlfriend here not too long after this location moved and I had to come clean with her about the place's summer debacle with the health department. I saw her eyes pop out of her head, but she calmed down once I reassured her that this venue came back with a clean bill of health. And let's be completely honest - after a complete PR meltdown with a grip of guests falling sick, the place can't afford another screw up, so it's probably more paranoid about sanitation than a mom in a daycare center. 

We came just in the nick of time for happy hour and grabbed a couple of glasses of sangria before ordering usual staples like stuffed dates, shrimp ceviche, and steamed mussels. All a big win in our book, plus the service was fast but not at all rushed. Firefly is a great place to grab a drink and a few small bites, or to order a lot of dishes and sample everything. You know, European dim sum! 

Parking is a bigger fiasco than it was at their original location in that it is now a small lot in the back, so consider yourself warned!"}
{"text":"Came here 2 years in a row during CES. Great tapas, everything we ordered was excellent. Stuffed dates were to die for."}
{"text":"I love the other firefly but after eating there tonight I was left disappointed.  The food isnt the same as there other location its just not as good and greasy.

The employees are awesome and very attentive.  The happy hour is great prices on mohitos and other drinks.  If the food starts tasting as good as there other location I will definitely be visiting more."}
{"text":"Used to be better. 

Great service. But locale had a Bucca Di Beppo feel. 

Patatas bravas leave much to the imagination. 

Octopus rather bland. 

Over-cooked bacon wrapped dates. 

Good calamari. 
Nice artichoke toasts."}
{"text":"Grab some friends... order sangria, the shrimp, the garlic fries. Get some more sangria. Laugh with authentic Vegas people... god totally fun! Go.. now!"}
{"text":"Firefly is a cool place, but much more for the trendy crowd than for the foodies, like me. It was really loud and crowded. The menu did not have anything very adventurous, in fact quite the opposite. The \"french fries\" tapas were ok. So was the manchego mac and cheese. The grouper was very dry and plain. The salad was acceptable, but the empanadas seemed small for tapas. The albondigas were boring meatballs with no real flavor. The best thing was the paella, and I've had much better.

If you are looking for great tapas, this just isn't the place."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped by in between lunch and dinner and grabbed food at the bar.  Wide variety and selection on the menu, and a decent amount of vegetarian options as well. Servers were friendly and attentive, and food was really good! If you are looking for food options off the strip, highly recommend. They have a fairly large seating area with nice ambiance, so it would be a nice place for a large group dinner."}
{"text":"i loved the atmosphere. The food was amazing, I couldn't get enough of it. Great place for my wife and I to have a date night."}
{"text":"Food - 4 stars
Ambiance - 4 stars
Service - 2 stars

The good news - Firefly offers very tasty food at extremely reasonable prices and pretty big portions (way too big to be classified as actual tapas, but this is a good thing if you feel like tapas are too small, or if you have more than 2-3 people, which we did).  They have an excellent sparkling sangria (they have red & white too) which is also reasonably priced. The patio has a nice, relaxing vibe and the inside looked pretty cute too. 

Standouts:
Bacon wrapped stuffed dates- 
Machengo mac & cheese
Firefly fries
That almond butter that comes with the bread 

Good:
Paella
Tuna Tartare (I like that they use taro chips)
Meatballs
Sausage plate

OK:
Sardine toasts
Bread with tomatoes
Clams and chorizo
octopus salad


If the service wasn't so lackluster I would have given them 4 stars. Our waiter must have taken too many bong hits before his shift, because he was spacey as hell. He wasn't forthcoming with suggestions even though I asked him for some. And he must have been too high to realize, when we ordered all of our food, and I mean all of it, (do you see the list above?!) , that we didn't want all of it at one time.  He went away, I lit a cigarette, and one puff later, all of the dishes came out. My eyes made my stomach full pretty much instantly. The table groaned under the weight of our food. It didn't help when the rest of our party showed up and they had no room for plates- and then they told us that waiters ALWAYS tell them in the beginning to order a little at a time because it comes out very, very fast.

Then, as we worked furiously to eat so we could clear  some plates away....he never came to check on us and clear our plates. We had to flag the busboys down to make room, which I hate doing. He never brought out our stuffed mushrooms, but after trying to eat all of the food up above, I could care less. He came to check on us once, asked if we wanted a sangria pitcher, and then when we said we would wait until he had more room, he finally looked at the table and realized we had been there for 15 minutes and had dishes almost hanging off. \"Oh...I'll see if anything is left and if it is I'll tell them to wait a bit\". Um, thanks asshole. A little too late.

The chocolate tres leches cake was ok, but it was more like chocolate cake with some condensed milk thrown on top. There was no distinct layers of milk. My friend asked for cream for her coffee and he thought she wanted another cup and it took her 4 tries of saying cream before he got it. 

Seriously Firefly - you can feed me anyday. But start making sure your servers aren't stoned first."}
{"text":"I've been here countless times and I've never had a bad experience!

Positive - Great atmosphere. Great menu choices. Seriously, try them all! Good sangria, too, both white and red. 

Negative - A bit pricey. Service can sometimes be a bit slow."}

{"text":"Mouth-watering experience for sure! We went for happy hour which made the experience even better! For starters... the house mojitos with pineapple were spectacular. Gotta a pitcher and enjoyed every sip :} Must try the bacon wrapped dates... Ok.. we both were in heaven with each bite, left us wanting more :] Then we tried the diablo shrimp which was super fantastic!  Get extra sliced warm bread for dipping... it is sooo worth it. Let's just say we ate to our palates delight! Our waiter was great, met the manager and he too was super nice. Really like this place and it is worth going! Don't forget dessert... bread pudding... was unbelievable!  A must try!"}
{"text":"Excellent small plate meal with unusual choices allowing sharing and tasting of a big variety of offerings. Despite being a very busy place(noice level is only caveat) the dishes arrived quickly and wait staff very efficient and friendly.  All dishes were carefully prepared and original in flavor and spices. Really nice dessert selection.. go for it!"}
{"text":"Sadly, I will not be going back to Firefly because of the recent Samonella outbreak. I work in a kitchen and if you are running your kitchen in a way that you cannot properly store your meat, I don't want anything to do with your restaurant. It isn't hard to properly store food, clean, and keep food safe for consumption. I've worked with complete morons who could still manage to not give people food poisoning. 

Really sucks because I liked this place a lot."}
{"text":"Food is great, but the wait was horrible. And it is LOUD in there. You can't hear across the table. They served food to us in sperts over an hour period. So a couple of us didn't have any food while others got theirs and finished and had to wait for us. The plates are so small that you can only share a tiny bit. Food tasted wonderful though. It was 2 hours before I got my food. Not a fun experience."}

First off - No air conditioning in the afternoon in July in Vegas? You got to be kidding me.  At one point we thought we felt some air coming on, but it was so light we weren't sure if we were simply imagining it.  Sorry, but I got to dock you a star just for that.

Second - They had like one waiter for the entire room. There were a couple of bus boys and a bartender, but they were useless when it came to things like getting our check. We pretty much had to rely on flagging down the hostess because the ONE waiter kept disappearing in the back.  Took forever to get out of there once we ate.
HOWEVER, I can't dock them any points because they made up for it by being honest on the check - I did my math wrong and wrote an extra $10 for the total.  If they had taken that extra $10, that would be another story.

Now, FINALLY, on to the FOOD.
Starter plate of BREAD. (Don't know why they give you this as half their dishes come with the exact same bread anyway.) This starter plate of bread was stale. Eww. The bread that came with other dishes was less stale, but still not very delicious. However, the SWEET BUTTER was delicious.  Better than the apple butter at Lucille's.

The Good:
GARDEN VARIETY SALAD - I liked this salad.  It had a good blend of sweet and sour, but I loved the addition of the feta cheese. Mmm. Somehow the feta just made it work.

FRIED CALAMARI - Fried pretty well, and I loved their sauce. It was something creamy and no doubt filled with fat, but who cares when you're in Vegas?

CAMARONES AL DIABLO/AL AJILLO - Diablo is chile and ajillo is garlic butter. Camarones is shrimp. I thought the chile sauce was outstanding. That sauce was so good, we were dipping everything in it, and thankfully they give you plenty of sauce to work with!  The garlic butter I thought was okay - nothing special but not bad either. If you love garlic like I do, it might be a bit light for you.

FRIES - Good, but nothing compares to the Boiling Crab's cajun fries. NOTHING. (http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-boiling-crab-garden-grove-2)
Definitely try the dipping sauce that comes with it (looked like the sauce that came with the calamari, but I can't be sure if they're the same or not.)

The meh:
The DUCK ROLL was only okay. I didn't particularly enjoy the sauce - I thought it was a little too sour. 

THAI BEEF SALAD - dressing was a little too salty for my tastes, but the beef was pretty tender and even better when we dipped it in the AL DIABLO sauce.

BAKED ATILLA - Cheese fondue with sausage? How can you go wrong?  Well, by using a really bitter cheese. If you like that sort of thing, go for it - otherwise, stay away.

PAELLA - I love the idea of paella, but I seem to have a hard time finding paella that I actually like.  The flavor always seems to be a bit off.  Don't know if it's just me being incompatible with the authentic flavors or what, but yeah.  I honestly didn't like the flavors here too much, but the rice was the perfect texture (I hate when it's too soggy) and the seafood was fresh.

Dessert:
PASSIONFRUIT CHEESECAKE - it's less sweet than the others, so if you get other desserts, eat this first. 

TRES LECHES CHOCOLATE - MMMM. Not too sweet or too rich, and it's got lots of cocoa flavor.

FLAN - Good, but not quite rich enough. Caramel was pretty awesome though.

LEMON-BERRY TART - rock hard but good with the condensed milk.

Note: They play their music kind of loud - It was just on this side of unbearable for me (but note that I have a low tolerance for decibel levels).  Late night when the place is packed would probably be worse with people trying to talk over it.  I did like the music though - they mostly played world music with a Spanish feel."}
{"text":"After a long road trip we stopped to grab a bite. Delicious! We had the tomato bread with Serrano ham, chicken croquets, shrimp ceviche, chicken tinga dish, and a flan. Amazing food, flavorful, fresh, was brought to our table at an amazing speed. The waiters and waitresses were extremely attentive, our drink never went empty. I'm sad I found this gem of a place so far from where I live. But any time I'm back in Vegas this will be my first and last stop."}
{"text":"Such a gem off the strip; this place is awesome! 

We started off with some ceviche and then we each ordered the lobster escargots which was the best part of the meal! The mussels in coconut sauce was a pleasant surprise. We also shared the huge serving of paella. Although I've definitely had better, it was great for the price. 

Overall great experience-- we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Best Tapas Restaurant in Vegas (and elsewhere).   Food is delicious, service is quick and prices are extremely reasonable for vegas. 

 Worth ordering were the dates, diablo shrimp and the apple and manchego salad."}
{"text":"This place is incredible!  bacon wrapped dates, filet sliders, mac cheese, thai beef salad, empanadas, tuna tar tar!  be sure to always order a pitcher of sangria (i like to get one red and one every time!)  Can get crowded during rush hours!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Being from the east coast we have tons of Spanish Tapas places but firefly gives their food a different touch. We were a large group and ordered about a dozen different tapas. Everything we ordered was delicious. The camarones al ajillo had a more spicy touch than spanish people are used to and i loved it. Great atmosphere with great drink selections and spanish beer. The manager Eduardo was extremely gracious.  I will definitely be going back and recomending to friends. By far the best place we ate during our recent Vegas trip."}
{"text":"I have been to firefly a few times and every time I am satisfied. The Manchego Mac and Cheese is AMAZING....as is the eggplant mannicotti and the Serrano ham chilled tapa.

Service was good with a bit of a wait but more than enough room to stand at the bar.

One word of warning, don't mix a pitcher of Sangria, with a gin and tonic, and a jack and coke. Bad idea."}
{"text":"This place make one of the best sangrias. 
We happened to sit in the lounge area 10 minutes before 6pm and our waiter told us about their HAPPY HOUR which means many of the drinks are a half price until 6pm. Therefore, we ordered a bottle of red wine to take an advantage. Among what we had, we liked CEVICHE OF SHRIMP ($8.50) and STUFFED DATES ($4)."}
{"text":"We absolutely love this place!  The food is absolutely fabulous!  We had several meat and seafood dishes and they were all amazingly delicious.  The ambiance has a very Spanish air to it which is very charming.  The service is also excellent and accommodating. The drinks and food menu is very extensive and authentic to Spanish cuisine.  Only a hop and a skip from the strip and plenty of parking.  We'll definitely be back on our next trip!!"}
{"text":"I was very hesitant on going to their restaurant after what they have gone through in the past but I did go after all. The food was good but the service was not and I was kind of disappointed but at least they offer nice variety of drinks"}
{"text":"Despite their horrible reputation.  I've never been sick here and I love the Sangria and petite filet mignon! Salsa night on Friday is so much fun."}
{"text":"Excellent food. The dates were amazing and the iberico ham was above average. Still far from great iberico but good enough. The gazpacho surprised me. Almost like my grandmothers. Their specialty fries ok, nothing special. Service is a bit lax but pleasant. Great price for the food."}
{"text":"My friend and I hit this place up on a Friday evening before I went over to the Hard Rock Pool for a concert.  I've driven past this place a hundred times and it always seems packed.  This was true on a Friday night, yet when we went inside, we were seated immediately.  In fact, we were able to sit out on the patio in the cooling summer weather.  

We just wanted to eat a couple of appetizers and enjoy a couple of drinks.  I ordered the patatas braza (red potatoes in a hot sauce) with the duck rolls (egg rolls but duck instead of egg).  Both were small portions, but considering we weren't that hungry, they were perfect.  The flavor of the sauce accompanying the duck was excellent.  The patatas were good but a little too spicy.

My friend was craving a mojito all day and since we couldn't do some at home, she got one here.  No plain pre-made mojito here, it was full of mint leaves and left a nice aftertaste in my mouth when I was allowed a sample.

We shall return here to sample a more complex menu in the future, as well as sit inside and enjoy the atmosphere and seating within (cool couches for seating instead of your regular high-back chair faire.  The cost was relatively inexpensive (as long as you don't come in too hungry), so we can come again before a Friday Night Live concert at the Hard Rock pool without feeling like a broke pig."}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere and delicious food!! We went there on a Friday night and the place was packed with about 25 people waiting to get in. Even so, we were seated in about 20 minutes. The place is dimly lit and resembles a club more than a restaurant but the atmosphere and vibe is great. We ordered a pitcher of mojitos, the veggie empanadas, patatas bravas, empanadas and camarones a la diabla. Each and every dish was fantastic and I would especially recommend the camarones diabla. I'm so glad we decided to go here and I cant wait to go back to Vegas to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"whenever i have guests coming to vegas wanting to eat well, drink well, and be merry...i take them to firefly.  they serve spanish tapas, they have pitchers of delicious sangria, they have live music on certain evenings, it's off the strip, and they are open late.  start off with a pitcher of sangria.  i recommend the white if you have a bunch of newbies that don't like wine too much.  i usually have the ceviche w red snapper, the boquerones which are spanish white anchovies on toasts w/roasted red pepper, my absolute favorite almond and blue-cheese stuffed sweet dates that are wrapped in salty fatty bacon. garlicky and cheezy firefly fries, my other favorite merguez ([spicy lamb sausage), tender sweet lamb chops, camarones a la diabla, and to finish it off with the extrodinary banana-nutella sandwiches.
i wouldnt recommend this place as nice great date place because it does get loud when it's very busy and with live music playing in the background.  they also have outdoor seating.  this place can get really busy.  i would call in advance to see if reservations are needed.  this is a really fun place to go to."}
{"text":"Service, food, ambiance and location is good.  This is the first time I have been to this new location and I was surprised how big this location is compared to the restaurant they used to have.  This restaurant was one of my favorite spots to go to when I used to live here.  I will definitely be back next time I home. Great spot for any occasion."}
{"text":"Great View, Okay Food, Disinterested service. 

When asked about the sangria, the waiter literally said, \"it's just wine, brandy and fruit.\" Way to sell it! He also refused a request for a sample taste.

Most dishes were good, not great. The very common praise for the stuffed dates is a bit telling. Not much else stands out. Dishes were served on what could easily pass for heavy duty high school cafeteria china.

Tapas should be enjoyed in a relaxed and welcoming setting. The wait staff was having none of that concept. \"Done yet?\" was their mantra.

The \"bubble\" room affords a great view of Fremont Street and was the most memorable part of the experience.

Miserable parking, but that's downtown."}
{"text":"I've read some of the recent reviews, and honestly, I don't know what these people are talking about when they give a less than stellar view. 

Firefly* is awesome.

Yup. Firefly* is awesome.

I'm a chef. I've run several kitchens. I understand what goes into making a dish that is successful and complete, and this location has nailed it.  I understand the difficulties involved in coordinating the FoH & the BoH, but on 11/1/10 Sean & the BoH were getting along just fine. His service was impeccable, and the other 2 gentleman who also swung by the table for various wossname's were extremely thorough in their service.  

We dined around 7:40pm, and thankfully they weren't crowded the day after Halloween. The view was amazing, though the constant flash of lights did bring to mind thoughts of flicker vertigo. This problem was quite simply resolved by not facing the Fremont Strip, though the Wife and such didn't seem to mind the dazzling display of lights.

Over the next hour we enjoyed numerous dishes, my favorite being the 'Albondigas.'  Whenever I hear the word 'meatball' for the rest of my life, Firefly* is going to be at the forefront. I've had amazing meatballs here in Atlanta. I've MADE amazing meatballs of my own. As near as I can recollect, these are the best meatballs I've ever had. Maybe the marinara deceived me. Maybe the thickened tendrils of melted cheese ensnared me. Either way, my Sister and I demolished the 'Albondigas' and the remaining sauce with a Gusto I have not experienced in nearly 10 months.

Oh sure, there was delicious 'Tomato Bread,' the Sherry Vinegar biting the back of the tongue and surprising the palate. I suppose I should've read the menu a bit better, but the fact that it was Chilled was a surprise, though not unwelcome. The bread was a little hard, but the tomato & garlic mixture was more pleasant than I had expected. 

When the Serrano Ham & Manchego arrived, I did wish that the Ham had been cut much finer, but everyone else was thrilled for the experience. Tasty.

Baked Tetilla = Delicious btw. I'm a cheesemonger from once-upon-a-time, and I was served with a number of  great Spanish cheeses this night. This was an engaging number with a pile of roasted tomatoes in the center of a bunch of BCB joy. BCB's = the 'Burnt Crunchy Bits' where the cheese just gives up and bubbles into the mouth with happiness. My Sister and her Husband killed this before I was able to stop taking pictures of Fremont. Drowning the slices of Baguette/Ficelle in cheese was quite enjoyable. 

However, the 'Firefly*Fries' were just about the best fries I think I've ever had as well. The Aioli has Mayo in it, which while not a sin on the palate, is not what I've come to expect from 'Aioli' in the general sense. Given that it was Fries, I was pretty much prepared for the Mayo, and the table was definitely happy. They were even more enthralled when the 'Empanada' plate arrived with even more Aioli. The roast pork/pepper mixture was amazing, and I really wish I had more space to eat this bliss.

While I don't do Sausage, the Terra y Mare skewers were tasty. I'm told be the Wife & BiLaw that the Chorizo was \"F'n Great.\"   The Lamb skewers were equally tasty, but definitely not half the YUM that was the 'Albondigas.'  

My sweet Lady insisted on 'Camarones Ajillo,' or rather, \"some sort of shrimp.\"  These coincided happily with the 'Tierra y Mare.'  Shrimp abounded, and it was good. 

I would be remiss if I didn't mention the 'Spinach Salad.'  I should've ordered this in the first round, and this too was an oversight on the \"Is this hot or cold?\" dishes.  Warm, tasty, and though the Artichoke was a little strong in the context of the salad, the Feta and Pine Nuts more than made up for it's bold character. It all balanced well with the roasted Red Peppers.

The drinks prices were reasonable as well, at least by comparison to $9 on the strip. We got away at $6 per Jack & Coke, which isn't cheap by comparison to burning cash in the penny slots, but was still better than the 'Rat Pack is Back' show, also at The Plaza. 

All in all, we left at less than $80 for 4, and any 2 of the dishes would've made me summarize this as a better evening than the one at Zeffirino's the night before.  The atmosphere was amazing, the food was perfect, and I couldn't have been more pleased. Add in the fact that they give you a free postcard with dinner whether you pay the $10 or not for a larger picture and you've got yourself a great evening. If you want your trip to Vegas to be memorable, eat here. If you want a good night on the town with quality that rates a Michelin star (IMHO) at a reasonable price, eat here.  

Did I mention Eat here? 

Eat here."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed coming to this restaurant. The ambiance was really nice. Food was reasonably priced and they have a wide selection of dishes. It was my first time trying Spanish tapas but I loved the experience. I will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"I had my bachelorette party dinner here - and it was amazing!  The food was amazing, the drinks yummy (and strong!), the vibe inside was classy, and the prices were good.  We made a reservation in advance through the Firefly banquet contact (the information is easily available on their website) and did a pre-fixed menu of family style tapas for a great price!  We did the Tapas Banquet for $33 and with (copious) drinks on top of that, it came to $60 pp including tip.  If we had had the same dinner on the Strip, we would have paid more than twice as much!  
Firefly was super easy to work with in making the arrangements.  

What also was great is there were great options available for my vegan and gluten-free friends, in addition to the yummy food for us meat-eaters.  We also had a ton of leftover food that we had boxed up and ate the next day as hangover breakfast food.  

This worked out super for us based on our bachelorette party schedule, which was as follows:  
6 - 7:  Pre-dinner light drinks at The Platinum Hotel (we booked the Marquis Suite, which easily slept 6 ladies with space to spare!), 
7 - 8:30 Dinner at Firefly (we ubered there from the hotel, about $6 - 8, the uber ride was about 4 minutes), 
8:30 - 10:30:  Back to the hotel to freshen up, pregame, and do some bachelorette games, 10:30 - late:  We went out clubbing to Tao in the Venetian

The overall night went great, and Firefly was one of the best parts!"}
{"text":"SANGRIA, SANGRIA, SANGRIA thats all I really have to say. If you don't go for the drinks then go for the bacon wrapped dates. They're the best in Vegas."}
{"text":"Excellent service and the food is amazing I come here a few times a month with my girlfriends and it never changes. The atmosphere is great. I always order most if the same food. Stuffed red peppers to the steak and mushroom skewers are all fantastic"}
{"text":"Delicious!  We loved every dish that we ordered from the beet salad, warm spinach salad, spicy lamb sausage, to the chicken and mushroom paella!  The timing of the dishes was perfect, which is so important with tapas.  We would definitely go again and will be recommending it to all of our friends!!"}
{"text":"Every tapa we ordered was amazing! So flavorful and unique. A little heavy on the sauces, but delicious! Stuffed bacon dates, goat cheese pesto, ahi tuna, seared shrimp and flan!!!!! Yum!!!"}
{"text":"Nice cozy place, great service. Food comes out fast and is consistently delicious. Would definitely recommend. My favorite is the bacon wrapped dates and the sangria by far."}
{"text":"Man, I don't know how I could top my previous review, but seriously, I went back again, and my experience was 10x better!  How is that possible?  Here is this list of things we ordered:

1- pitcher of red sangria - absolutely delicious, got both of us pretty buzzed at the end of our meal 
2- chorizo clams - probably the most delicious and memorable dish out of the whole night
3- diablo shrimp - huge prawns, cooked perfectly, a little too sweet for my liking but still delicious
4- apple and machego salad - sooooo yummy and perfect! i wish we ordered this in between our tapas because it acidity would really have helped cut the fat between the courses
5- some cheesy fondue thing - i dont remember what this was called, but it was sooo good!  plus they keep refilling with crusty bread if you need any

I love this visit even more than our previous visit because the food was different and tasted SOO good!  And we were sat on a sofa near the loungy area.  Very romantic and cuddly!  

If i could, I would give this place 10 stars!!"}
{"text":"firefly westside has good food, drinks, atmosphere, ambiance and staff! i would recommended it to anyone! there are so many different options of food there, and yummy drinks! also, latin nights on tuesdays is fun and energetic."}
{"text":"Lots of variety and great food. A group of 4 visited and tried the servers suggestions as well as some of our own choices. The bacon dates and Diablo shrimp were our favorites. Lots of flavor and a great meal."}
{"text":"We went there last night .....
We call first to se if we need a reservation the girl over the phone was super nice *****+ Jessica I think was her name .
We got there sat at the patio  nice ambient. 
We mentioned that we gave a Groupon  ..
Well I use those before always is a funny reaction with the server but not there we got super service! 
The mojitos strong  and nice flavor 
We try 9 diferentes tapas all delicious but we did not like one of them they replaced with out a question .
THANK YOU JESUS ... that happen to be the server name 
Even the mgr was nice and friendly .
Great great experience .."}
{"text":"Haley gave us incredible service tonight. Friendly and attentive. Easy on the eyes too."}
{"text":"Great place off the strip. The food was amazing and debated about giving it 5 stars or not. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Oh man....this place is delicious. We visited as part of a package deal, and had VIP seating with all you can eat and drink. We were able to try a lot of their different dishes. EVERYTHING, was amazing. Our waiter was so nice and on top of things. Loved the food and the overall experience was one of my favorite parts of our trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"I wouldve given them 5 stars if the service was better.  I got there with friends early enough to miss the crowds that usually end up there right before dinner time (5-7pm) The hostess seated us facing the sun..so I really couldnt read my menu, or even see who exactly sat infront of me. I politely asked her if we could move to another booth or table and she said \"umm NO\"..SO I moved us to another table anyway and flagged down a waiter. UGH rude ass woman..ANYWHO..food was AWESOME! I loved the stuff dates and their fries. The sangria was amazing and fresh! We all had a good time catching up before leaving Vegas..I would DEF recommend this place if your looking for a nice chill spot early in the day..best times to go are btw 1-4pm...crowds WILL show up for the dinner rush  :)"}
{"text":"I'm borderline obsessed with this place. I love everything here! The vibe is fun the service is impeccable and the food is delicious. The banana Nutella sandwiches are basically gods gift. I love that the plates are small so you can sample lots of things too. Despite the small plates you will leave full. I really enjoy this place was and every time I dine here."}
{"text":"The sauces are the stand-out. This place has beautiful , flavorful, different sauces for the dishes. Nothing is hashed out here; every dish was fresh and plump, except when it was shatteringly crisp. We ate here twice; sangrias are fruity, mojitos are refreshing."}
{"text":"Where do I begin with this place...after about a year of suggesting this place to me my fiance and I finally went to Firefly on Paradise.

This place is awesome...there are so many delicious things on the menu.

Bacon wrapped dates are AMAZING we have to get at least two orders 
Nutella sandwiches with banana and warm nutella drizzled on top
The mango BBQ pork ribs are also a must if you eat pork

Since I live in Vegas Firefly on Paradise has become the go to spot for my fiance and myself. Whenever we feel like going out this is the place whether a business meeting or just a night out.

Contrary to some of the other reviews I have read, the wait staff is AWESOME. Unlike any other restaurant I have been to members of the wait staff that walk by your table are happy to ask if you need a refill or to remove any empty plates or glasses that you might have on your table.

If you have an iPhone or Blackberry there's an app called open table where you can go in and reserve a table. Great ambiance a bit loud, ask to sit on the patio...you won't regret it!!"}
{"text":"WOW!! So good! Everything I tried was great! Service was great and they had a gluten free menu!! BONUS!"}
{"text":"Ten years ago, I lived in Madrid for a year or so. I got real used to the tapas bars in the city. Though it isn't authentic, it is Delicious! I tried the pulpo, bravas, tortilla espanola and paella. All if it was perfectly seasoned and we'll presented. A must for every las vegas excursion."}
{"text":"OMG this place is amazing!   

Overall though - this place is absolutely phenomenal.  Amidst all the Michelin and 5-Star Zagat rated places this is a great local jewel that is excellent.  

We shared Tomato-basil soup (served with mini grilled brie sandwich), Camarones a la diabla (its shrimp, served w/ spicy chile sauce, grilled bread), Tuna tartare (marinated ahi tuna, avocado, taro chips), and Steamed mussels (red curry, white wine and coconut cream).  

The tomato soup was ok - not really anything to write home about - the combination with the grilled brie sand was what made the dish.  If you like grilled cheese its nice to try - and the sandwich was a small portion so perfect true tapas style.  The shrimp was really good - the sweet/spicy tangy sauce made it just amazingly tasty!  Tuna tartare (marinated ahi tuna, avocado, taro chips), was good, tuna was really fresh and the chip made a nice contrasting taste.   The mussels were actually really good - and I dont normally eat nor like mussels often, they were made really well with a lot of flavor was different.  

Drinks wise, tasted both the (red-wine) Sangria and Raspberry Mojito.  Both were really well-made and I can think of the taste as I am writing this.  If you like red-wine - I agree with other opinions - Sangria is a must try! 

Couple of things to note - you should definitely try and make reservations - and also this is a $10-15 cab ride from the stip.  Additionally - the food tends to come out very fast so please be aware - they real do a good job at getting tables moving.  

This is an excellent place, phenomenal value for money and probably a secret hide-out amidst the glitz and glamor of Vegas!  Looking forward to going back.  

Only piece of advice - please please FireFly management have an area of the restaurant where the music is not soo loud and its a bit more mellow."}
{"text":"Funky atmosphere,  great food at tapa portion size. Would dine again for dinner and plan to dance the night away afterwards."}
{"text":"Food was amazing as always. Stuffed dates and chopped chicken salad. Yum!!! Mango mojitos are to die for. We needed a pitcher. This place never disappoints me. Great service. Fast and friendly service. I highly recommend this place and I bring all my out of town guests to eat here. I have introduced many locals to here as well. Many memories and great times. Thank you to Nahum our server he was great!!!"}
{"text":"We shared a total of 6 distes and Everything tasted the same. Looks like they use the same seasoning on all of their dishes. Not sure how ppl like this place, not authentic or even good tapas."}
{"text":"I love this place! Some of the best food for the money in Las Vegas and without the craziness of the strip. Apple and manchego salad as well as the dates are super delicious. Nothing I've had though is bad! I always make sure to eat here at least once when I'm in town."}
{"text":"not sure why this place has so many decent reviews.
the 1 star just goes to the sangria and that is it.
food was not memorable, food was not appetizing to eat or to look at.
service was horrible...
do not come here........ i came here because i was told its a good local spot..... but stick to the strip with all the amazing chefs at the hotels...."}
{"text":"A secret place the locals dont want the tourists to know about.  I came here with some of my friends who live in Vegas. Yes its a small place inside a little strip mall but  the sangria is the BEST you can find in the desert. They also have an outside patio which is great for summer nights. They serve tapas which for those of you who don't know they are more like appetizers and not actual dinner plates. I recommend the steamed mussels. They are soo delicioso!! hmmm... But their Sangria is the best. Their staff is awesome and very friendly. If you are in the Vegas area check out Firefly. There are two locations. This one is on Paradise which is close to the strip. The other location is in old town Vegas down off of Fremont street."}
{"text":"Went 2x while in Vegas. Had almost everything on the extensive menu. They were fast with the food but it didn't taste like it had been pre made or sitting in a warmer. Very reasonably priced!
My favorite dishes were the bacon wrapped dates, ceviche and potatoes. 
Great choice for an off the strip late night dining experience."}
{"text":"Excellent tapas restaurant with a spectacular view and reasonable prices!

All three dishes we tried-petite filet, artichoke toast, and bacon wrapped dates were delicious!! The red sangria was also very good..... you could taste the fruit infused with the wine. 

The great view of Fremont street and all of the classic hotels from a modernly decorated restaurant made the atmosphere enjoyable and fun!"}
{"text":"Delicious tapas and drinks at a reasonable price? I'm there! 

Called Firefly in the afternoon on Sunday and was able to get a reservation for 7pm for 4 people that night. Parking was easy to find there's a medium lot in the back of the restaurant. The interior has a clean and modern night club type feel. We arrived at 6:45pm and was seated right away in a booth. 

We ordered the stuffed dates, padron peppers, boquerones, petite filet, merguez (lamb sausage), and chicken paella. The only underwhelming dish was the peppers I would skip those the next time. But please do yourself a favor and get the petite filet! It was super flavorful and perfectly medium rare. I've had a lot of stuffed dates but this one was one of the best I've had. The paella is AMAZING. Perfectly cooked and not too salty. Chicken can be tough if cooked for too long but this chicken in the paella was tender and juicy. For dessert we ordered the cheesecake and flan. They're both good but the star of the dessert was the little cookie that came with the flan! They should have a dish with a bunch of those little cookies. On a side note we ordered a pitcher of red wine sangria to share. Delicious and smooth! You can't go wrong with the drinks here either. 

Definitely try this place out when you're in Vegas! It's a little off strip but it's so worth it. Didn't feel overly crowded and the food was amazing. Looking forward to trying this place again."}
{"text":"Very good loved the dates and other tapas. The Ginger Martini was yummy!  Our server Nahum was very friendly and helpful when answering our questions."}
{"text":"Rachel is awesome. The tapas aren't amazing, but they're perfectly good and the setting and the wonderful Rachel make up for it. Gambas al Ajillo are as good as in Spain. And the view....the best."}
{"text":"A little disappointed based on previous reviews.  Here was our rundown:

The very good:  diablo shrimp
The good:  paella, dates, red sangria
The decent:  mushrooms, mac n cheese
The not so:  Firefly fries, apple salad

Service was friendly, albeit a little slow at times.  Would still recommend for the value and the vibe."}
{"text":"Great place- food was excellent, for the most part. Favorites were the Ahi Tuna skewer, lamb skewer, and chorizo stuffed mushrooms and stuffed dates. Also loved the bread pudding and chocolate tres leches for dessert. Service was also great. Only complaint is the nose level was quite high. Otherwise a great place."}
{"text":"Wow it was none of the best meals ever. By far the best was the ceviche, Diablo shrimp and the mango ribs outstanding."}
{"text":"Wife and I love this restaurant. We are heading to Vegas July 27th and will once again make it a for sure stop. Love the tortilla de espanola."}
{"text":"We look forward to eating at Firefly on almost every Vegas trip. Love the tortilla a la espanola."}
{"text":"I have loved this place since I moved to Las Vegas in 2006. Everything I've ever ordered has always been delicious. My favorites are Firefly fries, Firefly fish sticks, Spicy Beef salad, and steak and mushroom skewers. It took me 4 years before I tried the bacon wrapped dates. They are amazing and a must have!! Sangria is the best I've had anywhere. I love all 3 versions: the original, white, and sparkling. For dessert, try the banana Nutella sandwich! 
The only downside is that I live in the NW and this location is just too far to visit often. I wish the Sahara location didn't close down. So basically, my only complaint is the location."}
{"text":"Had to go check it out the Firefly when we went to Vegas last week for my birthday.  After reading the Yelp reviews and recommendation from the VIP hostess at the casino where we were staying..I made reservations for May 7th!  Good thing I did..the place was packed.   My goal was to find a place where we could have some great food and have fun eating!  

Upon our arrival we were told it would be about 30 minutes so we went to the bar and got pitchers of their Sangria.  Excellent!  It was a dry red wine with fresh fruit as it should be not the sugary mix at all!  We were seated on the outdoor patio on a smallish round table and there were 5 of us!  We ordered and ordered and ordered...I think in all we had 20 different tapas!  Then the games began, the servers were bringing us plate after plate of tapas and as we devoured them they were there clearing the dirty plates.  It was so much fun!  I think we had a small army waiting on us because there were servers coming and going the entire time!  

The tapas were all outstanding!  I would list them but, just get the menu and pick out 20 of them and that should cover it.   We all enjoyed each and every one!  I got so full that I couldn't eat another bite.   All that food and the check was a mere $125!!!

The one negative about the Firefly is the noise level!!!! ouch...it is sooo loud!  I know there are lots of people and it is a lively type environment but perhaps some sort of sound proofing to absorb the sound would be helpful?  

The Firefly is our new \"have-to-go-to restaurant when we go to Vegas\" now!  Must warn folks...MAKE a reservation!  We were there on a Monday and it was packed...I'm sure weekends are flat insane.  One thing, that staff can certainly handle all that and then some.  They were rockin' it!"}
{"text":"Found out about this place on Yelp - the wifey and I gave it a spin!!! Wow the food was amazing the Sliders!! The camarones a la diabla, were the bomb!! The house specialty was great - ask the staff to make the recommendation!! Outstanding service!"}
{"text":"Very busy and good ambiance, but made our reso's weeks in advance and got a not so great table right under a fan (brrrr)! We loved the bacon wrapped dates and the ahi tuna, but the spicy beef salad was a letdown. Sauce wasn't very appetizing and the meat was overcooked. The pitchers of sangria sounded great, but the only fresh fruit we got in ours were some diced apples. Stick with wine and beer."}
{"text":"For my 50th birthday, I wanted something my large group would remember (besides me being a tipsy goofball). We got it.
I went to Firefly on Paradise for my 25th wedding anniversary three years ago, and my friends have talked about how great it was. So could Firefly in the Plaza be as good, especially with the menu omissions (there are a few dishes you can only get at the Paradise location)? Yes, yes, yes.
We started out with pitchers upon pitchers of the best Sangria outside of Spain....at Happy Hour they were around 13$ each! 
Our group were allowed to relax and unwind before being seated in the most central tables to observe the Freemont Street Hoopla. Our waitress and waiter combo brought a bottle that absent friends sent which started me crying, that started the waitress crying, and well, the whole table got misty....but then there was food!
The table trusted me to order for us all...and it was a feast that Babette would have given her approval to....The empanadas, the almond-stuffed bacon wrapped dates, the artichoke and pepper crustini, the serrano ham with manchego cheese, the coquettas, the chicken and chorizo stuffed mushrooms, it just went on and on...
and the wine flowed....
The evening was everything a birthday dinner should be....
My only wish is that I could go to Las Vegas for every special occasion and have at least one dinner at Firefly.....I wonder what I am doing for my cat's birthday next month?......."}
{"text":"The stuffed dates are really good! The desserts are good too and so is the service"}
{"text":"Had dinner this evening at the newly re-opened Firefly on Paradise. This resturaunt re-opened today at 4pm. Place was spotless. Service was 2nd to none. Food was excelent. Had the stuffed dates, steak and mushroom skewers and tuna tartar. Everything was great. probably the safest and cleanest resturaunt in Vegas. Highly recommend to all."}
{"text":"Good food, strange service.  We have been to the Paradise location with virtually the same experience.  The food is always very good and interesting.  The hubs and I have never had anything we didn't find loaded with flavor and pretty to look at.  

The servers, though also pretty to look at, are an odd bunch.  They sometimes seem downright confused.  I don't think there was a language barrier but definitely some sort of difficulty.  We asked for water and the waiter had no idea what we were aking for.  We tried sign language and pointing to another table's water and he finally understood.  We asked for our check and were delivered three menus.  When we finally got the check and had finished paying, the server brought us someone esle's mac'n cheese.  We explained that it was not ours and guess what...he looked at us like we were unicorns.  Very handsome, but maybe not so good at serving food."}
{"text":"We were really looking forward to coming here, we had good memories from when we came at Christmas for our 5th wedding anniversary. 
The service during happy hour was allover the place. 
The waitress attempted to prove my wife wrong when my wife pointed out that the sangria was sparkling and she ordered the still. 
The food was really so-so. When we came at Christmas it was much better. We noticed there was not much flavor and most things for some reason now have chilli or some kind of hot sauce in them.

Totally bummed, this was going to be one of the highlights of our trip."}
{"text":"Get here, any way possible. Worth the walk if you have to! Delicious food, attentive staff, great ambiance. Potions were big, much more than we were expecting with tapas. Best food and lower prices. Will come back every time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Great food, the best blue berry mojito ever, we got ceviche, tuna tartare, and tierra y mar ,,,, to die for, I love the lemon berry tart, but my bartender suggested the new pumpkin bread with vanilla ice cream,,,, it was excellent ,,,,, all the Staff was so friendly ,,,, from the hostess to the busser , servers and thanks to the bartenders ,,, Omar, Tina, Danny for the great  service,,,!!!!, you guys made our night !!!!"}
{"text":"We had our company holiday dinner here on Saturday night. The place was hoppin by 6 when we arrived. We were not totally satisfied with where they sat us, but the manager apologized and sent our party of 12 a couple of pitchers of Sangria. That was VERY nice of him and we enjoyed both the red and white Sangria. Yummy. 

Service was wonderful, our waiter was very patient and diligent. We were somewhat slow and indecisive as a group so that was appreciated. 

Food was awesome! I didn't have a single bad or unsatisfactory dish:

calamari - OMG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
veggies and lentils 
bacon wrapped dates
duck roll
beet salad
Thai beef salad
apple and manchego salad
crab corn-dogs
steak and mushroom skewers
banana nutella sandwiches
chocolate bread pudding

...that's all I can remember right now. 

I haven't been to this location of Firefly, and it's been years since I've visited the other location so now I'm wondering...what took me so long to come back? LOL I won't let that happen again.

Prices were very reasonable and we all ate our fill but didn't break the bank!

I will certainly return to try some other items and get another excellent pitcher of Sangria. Mmmmmmmmmmm."}
{"text":"LOVED this warm, friendly, yummy place!  During our short trip to Vegas, had lunch here twice and dinner once...all of our meals were amazing!  Creative, delicious food, excellent service and a very comfortable, inviting environment.  Love the small plate approach...made it feel as though we could try such a variety of fun dishes! The cheesecake...with the passion fruit sauce...was soooo delicious!! (all FOUR times I had it!!)"}
{"text":"Oh my GOD that was the best Tapas experience I have had ever!!

On the recommendation of the bar tender I started with Stuffed Dates and added the Tierra y Mar Skewers.  Awesome combo!

Highly recommend if in a meat (with a little seafood) and red wine reduction mood!!

Ordered a Sangria that was not as flavorful as hoped (but still potent).  Next time I'll find a good Cabernet.

See you again in two weeks!"}
{"text":"Wow! 

This place was all around fantastic. 

We ordered the red sangria, which was lovely. It had flower petal tastes incorporated...that's a first for me. Never had that flavor in a sangria. It was great. We ordered a couple mojitos as well - they were good, but the sangria just blew em out of the water.

We were vegetarians and I went here after reading someone else's review that said they had vegetarian options. He was right on the money! It had a good number of vegetarian options - and they were willing to customize the almond stuffed dates to make em veggie-friendly as well. And all the dishes were excellent.

Honestly, I'd have given these guys 4.5 stars, but I rounded up cuz the food & drink were so good. The -0.5 stars would have been for 2 things :

1) for loudness. Try asking for outdoor sitting to help with that (it seemed quieter outside). There was a longer wait for outside seating when we went
2) When we did ask to move from inside to outside the waitress insisted that we'd have to close out our bill and then move and re-open a new tab. I get that we'd have a new waiter/waitress (i.e. I don't want someone else getting my tip?) , but as a customer, that should be transparent to me. They should have been able to figure it out between themselves, and leave me out of the picture.

Having said that, this place is a must visit for me now.. I'm going here (and asking for outdoor seating) next time I visit the area!"}
{"text":"really nice place, great food and prices was ok. Went there for lunch and it was pretty quiet. Definately recommend the tomato bread and mushrooms stuffed with chicken. Not too keen on the meatballs though, we left them as they tasted like they were out of a tin! Lobster was also good. Definately recommend the sparkling sangria. Amazing."}
{"text":"Call me crazy but I'm not that crazy about Firefly. 
The food is mediocre to me and there's only a few things that I enjoy eating there which is the bread and the ceviche. You can't really screw those two up. I know the first time I went there I had the petite filet and I was not impressed at all. And I'm a sucker for filet mignon! It was so bland and just....blah. 
The only thing I absolutely LOVE is their red sangrias! Good Lord have mercy! Only thing I would go there for! As for their food, I'd rather pass."}
{"text":"Fire Fly has an awesome food menu and and even better sangria. The stage is great and helpful Joaquin and Athena are great bartenders. This is must go restaurant and the night time atmosphere is great."}
{"text":"Great place to eat tapas (without having to deal w/traffic, parking, reservations, tourists on the Strip).  We liked the following...

Sangria (red wine) Pitcher
Bacon Wrapped Stuffed Dates... wonderful Pecan surprise inside
Shrimp Diablo... sauce is the real winner in this one
Ham and Cheese Croquetas... comfort food"}
{"text":"Firefly catered a rehearsal dinner at my house. The guests could not say enough about how delicious the food was! Carlos, the manager, was wonderful to work with, and gave great recommendations and advice as to what to serve and how much. Even the delivery was perfect!  Jonathan was so nice and helpful!  I totally recommend Firefly for any event, and I will use them again!  Can't wait to go eat at the restaurant!"}
{"text":"How could you find something to complain about this place.  I'm from San Diego and every time I travel to Vegas and I have to make sure I visit this place at least once.   Try this place you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is very good. I am a big fan of tapas because you can try pretty much everything especially if you have a big group. The fries here are awesome. Do not forget the lamb chops, shrimp in garlic butter sauce, stuffed mushrooms, empanadas and bacon wrapped dates. Also, the sangria is quite tasty. I have not had the chance to try everything on the menu but I have a feeling that i will not be disappointed. The service is very good, I never had a bad experience. Tapas and sangria...what else can I say? Oh yeah don't forget the mojitos!"}
{"text":"Stuffed dates and artichoke toasts. It doesn't get any better. 

Tried a number of other dishes, haven't had luck with any seafood dish. Poorly cooked everytime. Others are decent. Chicken can be bland and queso was pretty greasy."}
{"text":"Delicious! And, despite other reviews complaining about the service, our server seemed stressed, but was still friendly and attentive.
We had the delicious bacon wrapped dates, lamb skewers, surf and turf skewers, veggie empanadas (amazing!), salmon toasts, steak salad (surprisingly, one of my favorites. The steak was tender and cooked to perfection, and complemented the salad very well). My mom had a sangria, which was very nice. I admit I stole a few (or more) sips! All in all, we ended up getting just enough food for 4 people, and left totally satisfied by all the flavors and textures, without being \"vegas buffet stuffed\"."}
{"text":"I love this place, there are very few places like this in Vegas. It's a great place to go on a date and is so much fun. They have pitchers of sangria (red, white, or sparkling that has a little bit of peach liquer added to it with some champagne), pitchers of different kinds of mojitos, as well as your standard mixed drinks. They are reasonably priced (pitchers are $24) and the bartenders know their stuff and are personable. Their happy hour is amazing with half priced drinks and they give you a plate of complimentary tapas. I wouldn't necessarily say it's a great dinner place per-se (hello, tapas bar), but a great meet-up place and with a sexy vibe to get to know someone. The tables are a little awkward towards the back because they are so large that you're sitting a reasonable distance away from your date. It makes it hard to get cozy unless you sit next to them in the booth. The outdoor patio is awesome, and usually crowded. Service is hit or miss, i've had good experiences and a couple that were just okay. The quality of the food, drinks, and ambiance make it not so big of a deal though. Their bacon wrapped dates are to die for, and i'd definitely say it would be on the top of my list for favorite places to go in Vegas. A +++ for the bartenders, food, and energy of the place."}
{"text":"I went here just short of a week ago, and was kind of disappointed to be honest. I'm a little spoiled by Firefly on Paradise and this place just wasn't the same. The view is incredible, it overlooks Fremont Street but it was so open that it felt cold. It wasn't as intimate or eclectic as the location on Paradise. The music selection was kind of an odd mix of Tropical, Salsa, and God knows what else. Who ever made that CD should not ever make CD's for restaurants because it just threw off the ambiance of the restaurant. So first off, this place is in the Plaza. Downtown Las Vegas is filled with pimps, ho's, white trash, and your  Emo guyliner kids who dig Beauty Bar and The Griffin. So being as i'm a loungy, eclectic kind of gal, Downtown is not my scene to begin with. 

I tell the hostess that it's our first time here and we usually go to the one on Paradise, so she gives us the best table in the house with the table being right by the window overlooking the middle of Fremont street with floor to ceiling windows. We had a very attentive server and she was awesome, a lot better than the service on Paradise to be honest..  We ordered the dates and the eggplant cannelloni to start followed by the paella. Dates were fab as always, but the cannelloni not so much. The goat cheese overpowered the dish incredibly. The tomato sauce made the flavors come together a little more, but something felt missing. Possibly the introduction of better spices or more spices in the cannelloni to give it more flavor. Oregano, basil or some garlic maybe? Something just so you taste more than just goat cheese. The Paella portion was large enough for 3 people, and was good. Not the best, but not the worst either. I think all in all i'm just a little spoiled by the other location. This place is good for someone who likes something a little more modern and with a great view, but I like ambiance. Take me to a different place, yet make me feel at home. Firefly Downtown didn't give me that feeling. Sorry other Yelpers who love this location much more. :( I just don't see it."}
{"text":"I found this place through yelp and I have to agree with all the recent yelpers. Overall good food...I sampled:

My two favorites dishes were:
Camarones a la diabla (shrimp in a spicy savory sauce)
Pulpo asado (grilled octopus)

Were just ok:
Crispy duck rolls (pretty good- sauce was a little sweet)
Manchego mac n' cheese (needed just a little more salt)

The food came out a little slow. We were there for almost 2 hours and we only had 4 tapas sized dishes.  Normally that's fine with us but we had a show to catch. Actually, our waiter forgot to put one of our dishes in- but as a bonus, he got it for us asap and it was on the house.  So he won us back with that!   

I just went there this past friday- I was worried about not getting a table so I arrived at 6PM and there was some room, but by the time we left, it was packed. 

I am definitely going back again though.  Vegas needs more of these types of restaurants!"}
{"text":"My brother told me about this place. He said \"You must have the stuffed dates\". They are a must! Ever since I was stationed in Panama with my husband, I have searched for good empanadas. OMG!! I finally found them! This place is one of the best food places in Vegas. The food is cooked to order and served very hot. I ordered the red Sangria and it is incredibly delicious. I recommend ordering a pitcher. The fresh bits of apple are so good.  My favorites on the menu are the dates, empanadas and lamb chops. They season the chops perfectly with a wonderful sear on them. They melt in your mouth. Their garlic fries are addicting.They are open late and service is amazing. Every time I am in Vegas, this place is always on my list. It's busy but a romantic place. It's a tapas bar, so you can try lots of food and not spend lots of money. Every mouthful of food is an experience and it makes you want to come back again and again. Thanks brother! You got this one really right!"}
{"text":"We found Firefly on Yelp, and really thought it deserved its great rating!  Sadly, they don't have reservations for small groups anymore, so there's a risk of a wait, but we lucked out on that front.

The food was delicious!  I highly recommend the cheese, almond and apple salad!  I found that, as a vegetarian, there was PLENTY to choose from, a pleasant surprise in Vegas.  I only wish that instead of ordering everything (5 plates) at the beginning we had ordered and eaten more slowly... more chance to enjoy that way. :)  The service was remarkably fast, but didn't make us feel rushed.  All in all, a great restaurant."}
{"text":"This is our first dinner stop whenever we arrive in Vegas, especially now that Firefly is at their new location.  We like the variety & quality of their tapas along with their white Sangria to wash it all down."}
{"text":"Vegas is Vegas.  There are many ways to do Vegas.  Getting off the strip, even if for a moment, is a must for me.  This place, is worth leaving the strip for.  No lines, quiet, you know... a normal dining experience. Lets get down to the food.  It was good... Very good.  I have only been here once, so that is why the 4 out of 5.  We had the apple and manchego salad.  How can such a simple salad be such a great food experience?  It is... trust me.  Get it, enjoy it.  We had the mac & cheese, albondigas, and baby back ribs.  Yes, we got our food on.  The drinks were good too.  Go here.  Eat well.  Drink well.  Live well.

{"text":"This is a great place with awesome food. A taxi driver recommended this place and we are so glad he did. Everything was very nice. Service was on point and the menu provides everything for everyone. I will definitely cone back again when in town.  You must check this out!"}
{"text":"Great place for tapas! With a bottle of Estrella or glass of Cava I'm reminiscing Barcelona. Sure there are some tapas far from your typical Spanish flare but they did a great job with the selection. My 2 faves from my 1st encounter: boquerones and the beef & mushroom skewers."}
{"text":"Wow! Came here twice so far. Both times my group left happy and satisfied.
Can't remember everything I've had here but I'll list the standouts from my last visit.

Filet mignon sliders: Although small, they were perfectly cooked and savory.
Calamari: Very crispy and comes with a delicious dipping sauce.
Manchego mac n cheese: Eat it when it's hot! The upper layer can get kind of hard and unappetizing but it's delicious when fresh.

Now that i think about it, there are a lot more I would like to mention, but studying for the GMAT awaits. You should experience Firefly at least once when you're taking a break from gambling in Vegas."}
{"text":"I could easily divulge in a liquid meal of sangria but then I'd be missing out on all their delectable goodies!  They have a VEGAN/VEGETARIAN menu!!!  All ya gotta do is ask for it.  =]"}
{"text":"Finally tried this place for the first time, missed happy hour by about 10 minutes and really wanted to kick myself in the butt for that, but the tapas selection and variety were delicious. Tried some of the seafood, beef skewers, lamb, and bacon wrapped dates. Everything came out delicious and very quick. The sangria is very tasty as well, although the only fruit pieces in it were diced apples. 

Next time I will have to make sure to get here for happy hour."}
{"text":"Sangria, savory meatballs, chicken on a stick smothered in creamy garlic sauce, cute little fish sticks, empanadas, and some of the most interesting dishes I have ever seen. I have never had tapas before and I actually love it! Instead of one big meal, you can try different little meals and still reach the point of sitting back, smiling, sometimes groaning with joy at how much delicious food was consumed. When I say groaning with joy, I am saying that you cannot possibly complain that you ate too much in a negative way because your taste buds were jumping with joy when you ordered that second round of meatballs, but know you probably should not have. It is so worth it! 

Some might say that this place is a bit small, but I think that is what makes the atmosphere in this place fit in with the bite sized treats. I love the lighting in this place so much! I hate places that are so bright you feel like 8pm is really 2pm. The dimness and the outside string lights are just perfect for me. I think I love sitting outside more than inside. I sat outside and was just in love with the weather, the scenery, I was really just in love with evening here. 

We did go around 6 or 7, but as we were finishing up, the place started getting packed! It was a Monday night. So, I would advise when reading some of the other reviews when they say make reservations or get their early, because it does get busy. That is a good thing though, because I definitely plan to go back MANY times!

Now I know where to go if a date asks me what I want rather than surprising me. :)"}
{"text":"Delicious!! Fair price with good portion for 4 of us :D
We ordered one pitcher of sangria, stuffed dates, lamb chops, tierra y mar skewers, babyback ribs, tuna tartare, fried calamari, and seafood paella for about $150 including tax and tips!!
Good customer service!!
Enjoy the atmosphere and environment!!!"}
{"text":"Even though they had a bad health grade at the Paradise location and the Eastern location closed, I still dined there today because I haven't eaten here in a while, I was craving some dates and I bought a groupon. We walked in and it wasn't busy at all. We got choice seats in the bar so we could watch soccer. A bit disappointing was the bar menu wasn't updated as every single beer that my husband wanted was no longer available and the server said sorry the menu is wrong.  

Stuffed dates are a must! I love their dates compared to Toros Tapas.  The dates in the red wine reduction is so good! 

Pulpo asado- still delicious according to my husband!

Boquerones- Spanish white anchovies with roasted peppers avocado- my husband said its not as good as it used to be.

Veggie empanada- if you like mushrooms, spinach and cream cheese then you will enjoy this. I would order it again

Smoked salmon toasts- If you like smoked salmon then you will enjoy this dish. It was good and tasty! 

And we can't forget dessert!

Banana nutella sandwiches and chocolate tres leches are winners! Still my favorite at Firefly! 

This is a nice restaurant, good food and I hope it starts to be a happening place again!"}
{"text":"Came in from out of town for a work convention, food was good enough to justify going two days in a row. Food was great, portions were very well proportion volume / price. Place is busy and be sure to arrive plenty in advance to get seated since they do not take reservations."}
{"text":"Another Brunch at Fire Flys. Food as always FANTASTIC!!!!! This time , however the Bartender, (Stephanie), was  Outstanding. Our drink orders were perfect and served in a very timely manner. Something that was lacking on other visits. Our server Karen was knowledgeable an was spot on with recommendations and bringing our food on time and hot. She ensured that all our needs  were met and made our dinning experience the best we have had at this restaurant. We have always enjoyed our Brunch at Fire Fly.  Today, the experience was enhanced exponentially. New management makes this restaurant a must go dinning experience."}

{"text":"Had a group dinner here during a convention week for my staff, 14 people. They were super easy to work with figuring out a plan, and the food was amazing. Everyone was happy from carnivores to the vegetarian of the group. The ribs are to die for, very tender with lots of umami flavor. The tres leches cake is also not to be missed. Good sangria and mixed drinks too. Overall a great dinner and experience."}
{"text":"By far one of my favorite places to dine in Vegas! It may not have a celebrity name attached to the restaurant but the food is always delicious and the staff super friendly! It's a great place to take friends and don't forget to get a pitcher of sangria!

Favorites include:
Eggplant & goat cheese cannolis
Bacon wrapped dates
Beef Thai salad
Ceviche
and Kobe beef sliders!

Can't wait until I can say I've tried them all!"}

{"text":"Great food, great drinks, great vibe, pretty girls everywhere, and I looked everywhere except the ladies room. I'm guessing there were pretty girls in there too, but I don't like to make assumptions. You won't be disappointed at Firefly"}
{"text":"The garlic bread and almond butter is always delicious but I was disappointed with my tapas this time. I ordered a mushroom tart and it was super greasy and the tart was hard. I looked frozen and re-heated. It was hard to cut pieces to eat it and I've had this dish before, it's always been light and flaky. I also ordered flan and that was so-so. The flan caramel was runny but it was ok. The presentation was nice. 

I will say, though, the new location is very nice and stylish."}
{"text":"Great food. We ordered a variety of selections and it was all good including the deserts"}
{"text":"The place is nice, the food is okay, a bit pricy but tolerable. I would come back only if it is for something flashy and fancy but not quite satisfying, like catching up with this ancient friend from high school, whom you've not seen for 20 years since.......high school."}
{"text":"Wow! If you are in Vegas, definitely come here.   Hubs and I had an early dinner here on a Saturday and it was amazing! The apple manchego was fresh and light.  Artichoke toasts were good as were the stuffed dates. The weakest thing we had were the scallop 'escargots', they were basically a vehicle for the garlic sauce, but they were still tasty.  Great atmosphere! Friendly service! Come!"}
{"text":"The food was fun, the view was good, the service was solid, and it came at a curiously competitive price. I would comfortably reccomend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Firefly is my go to place for a late night munch.

FRIDAYS: Friyays are Latin Nights! They move the table and chairs out on the patio deck and make it a dance floor. There is sometimes live music from a band or just a loud DJ playing the best of Latin music. It gets really cramped and full on Latin Nights. Parking is hard to find because people love to dance and drink!

FOOD: Their tapas menu is amazing! Bread and sweet butter is served complimentary with a sweet butter(bread can be hard if you come late at night). My favorite dish here is the Mac n cheese. It is prepared with small shell pasta, yummy cheese, and baked to perfection. I LOVE the Mushroom Tart here because it is a dish you can't find anywhere else in Vegas. It is a flakey dough with a mushroom sauce on top. If you want more mushroom dishes, the stuffed mushroom is also really great. I would recommend more dishes but honestly their menu is pretty big so your best bet is to be adventurous and order a dish from each section of the menu since it is tapas:)

DRINK: They have a full bar offering whatever you're craving for the day. So you can even go here for drinks if you're not feeling hungry.

ATMOSPHERE: This place has a really great Latin setting with Latin music and Latin food. Great place for a date or just to hang out with friends.

TIP: Be careful of your own sensitivity to foods. Latin foods can be raw because that is how the food is supposed to be prepare (many customers complain when they get sick from raw foods but it's not the restaurant's fault)."}
{"text":"Like the mistress you brag about to your buddies... But have to keep secret to some you know, because you know if the secret gets out to everyone, your whole life will change... I have eaten there four times lately, and even with the rabble-rousing reports of another store in their chain~ They are a treasure I could enjoy daily!  Figuring out the menu, enjoying the service, compiling a mounting list of \"Must-have\" stand-by's that I wouldn't want to live without~ To the list that many great minds have sited:
Dates stuffed with an almond, wrapped in bacon, wrapped in bacon and resting in red-wine reduction, sprinkled with Bleu crumbles~ Do the math! (Or the Chemistry!)
Fillet with mushroom on a skewer, covered in a veg-mix that I don't want to describe~ You tell me~
Ham and cheese croquettes~ crunchy, smokey, Cheesy! A fantastic compliment to everything aforementioned~
Best staff in Vegas at the bar, but a big busy floor~ I get that a bit, but I'm always happy leaving, regardless of what I spend~
Value is always excellent!
Updates will have to happen~"}

It's dark, a little loud, and cozy.

I love tapas, and these guys do it well."}

{"text":"We are BIG Tapas fans but have trouble finding the real thing.  We found it at Firefly. 

Great service from Eder and wonderful food.

The Summer salad features thinly sliced french green beans,  marinated in a balsamic dressing surrounded by halved red and black cherry tomatoes and a few dollops of smooth, lucious burrata cheese.  Delicious! 

The Albondiga -meat balls in tomato sauce- doesn't sound exciting but it is irresistible.  Serrano ham and Manchester croqettas- sublime.  Crispy outside soft and delicious inside.  The red Sangria was perfect.
We had other dishes and all were top notch.  

The Flan was a spectacularl end to a perfect meal. Smooth and creamy and not too sweet. The tiny bit of lightly sweetened tart berries was just the right foil for the creamy flan.

I recommend Firefly wholeheartedly!"}
{"text":"If I could give -50 stars I would. Don't get me wrong the food is delish, but the service? I'm better off at the swap meet. The server Karina is extremely rude. She has 0 customer service skills. She made the biggest deal because we asked her to split a check, exclaiming \"it would take too long\" since she had 10 tables to serve. I had never had such a bad experience at this location. If I do come back, I will make sure our server is NOT Karina."}
{"text":"Not sure how this restaurant is still open... Service is terrible, food takes forever and then everything comes at once"}
{"text":"So good and fun!  We had 3 kids with us and decided to go on an early dinner and everything we got was good.  We ordered the meatballs twice.  The filet was not pictured.  Here's a list of items we got, mushroom tart, octopus, scallops, tomato soup, meatballs, empanadas, tuna tartare, and chicken skewers.  Definitely will go back and recommend to anyone who enjoys tapas."}
{"text":"yum! my friends and i came here for dinner on friday and lunch on sunday :) it's perfect for a girls who want a variety of yummy tapas in small but not tiny portions. we had the stuffed dates, artichoke toast, tuna tartare, veggie empanadas, mac n cheese, and more... try it, you'll like it! oh, my friends had red sangria and like it a lot, too."}
{"text":"Jesus was great. The manager was very engaging. All the food was delicious. Party of 11. The girls really liked the pomegranate mojito's. Will go back."}
{"text":"Firefly is my favorite place to eat right now.  We have gone for tapas and last time, we went for paella.  The paella is superb but more rich and buttery than I am accustomed to.  

Order the clams and chorizo and get some extra bread because the broth is the elixir of life.  Pork empanada is another favorite from a large menu of small plates.

There is something for everyone in your group and sharing is the order of the day.  I always go when I travel to Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Loved it!went there for late dinner with my husband on Monday night,it wasnt too busy,so we didn't have to wait for a table.service was great,our waitress was nice and very attentive.
We tried 5 different dishes:
-dates wrapped in bacon!A must!im not a big fan of bacon,but it was so gooooood!i still can taste on my tongue
-ceviche was okay,I felt it needs a bit more flavor
-ahi poke with taro chips,it was good!big pieces of tuna,just loved it
-lamb skewers was yummy too,my husband is a big fan of lamb,he knows when its good,he loved these one!
-beef sliders was great as well,it was melting in my mouth!
We also got a pitcher of red wine sangria by recommendation our server,it was good,with apple pieces,has a nice flavor.but we couldn't even finish it!their pitchers are big!you have to share it with 3-4 ppl!
Looking forward to come back and I will bring more people!"}
{"text":"We came here with about eight other people to have some tapas and escape the crowds and the smoke of the Strip. I usually don't like tapas very much because I'm like a growling Husky and very protective of my dish when I find what I like. However, this place has enough for everyone! We only had to wait 15 minutes, for a large party on a Friday night that's a pretty good clip.

The best dish is the cheese/pecan/fire roasted figs wrapped in bacon. Everyone really loved that. The Sangria flowed and the staff were on the ball. We go here every time we're in Vegas. Regular cab service."}
{"text":"The food is simply great. Every time we go to Vegas, we make a point of visiting this great restaurant. I can say I had tried almost all the items on their menu and there was not one item that I didn't like. 
Go for the tapas plates and remember that sharing is caring !"}
{"text":"First of all, take a taxi. Being Vegas novices we tried the monorail and besides being expensive we still had to walk nearly a mile in Vegas heat. Our next move was a good one though. We started out with a pitcher of the red sangria which was wonderful. I think we could have downed another pitcher easily, but it was lunch even if we were tourists in LV. The server helped guide us through the extensive menu. Our dishes were overall pretty good though the sangria was better. Standouts included the blue cheese sliders and the bacon wrapped dates.  Skip the paella. It was pricey and mediocre."}
{"text":"This has been one of my faves since I first moved to Vegas way back when! I live in Cali now, but as soon as I cross the state line, Fire Fly, is one of my first stops. Where to begin . . . The service, Naum, is the man with a plan!!!! He is the best and always on point with the most excellent service and attitude. The sparkling white peach sangria (pitcher) is a must have and we drink every drop of it, even eating the blue berries too! 

Now let's start with the food, I have had 90% of the menu and everything is delish! My faves hands down is: camarones Diablo,  fire fly fries, filet mignon slider, lamb skewers, empanadas, calamari, ahi tuna, paella, Mac n cheese, and the stuffed dates! You cannot go wrong here. Nice atmosphere, music, food and people! Cheers!"}
{"text":"Perfect place to get a good meal and get away from the casinos.  Good fast service, lots of great appetizers.  Ceviche, skewers, spicy salad and patatas bravas were plenty for two people"}
{"text":"What can I say? In 12 years of going to Vegas, this is my favorite place to eat! And the funny thing once I bring a friend with my, next thing I know, they are bringing their friends and clients there to eat! if I am in Vegas for a week, I'll probably eat there twice. 
So many amazing dishes on the menu. And the sangria is the best! 
In fact, if I did not live 2700 miles away, I would eat there once a month at the very least. I live in a little town called Waxhaw and what my town needs.. is a Firefly!!! Hey Firefly, how about opening up a Southeastern location in the coolest little town in the Carolinas? Please?"}
{"text":"A party of four goes to Firefly on a Saturday evening to enjoy Tapas and Mojito's without reservations. Typically, this story would end in anger or disappointment; this story ends in pure joy.

Firefly is by far the best Tapas I have had outside of Spain and one place in Seattle.

The wait staff was perfect. Dishes were brought to the table and cleared away with expertise. Drinks and mojito pitchers were refilled quickly. 

The food, oh the food, was fabulous. There was only one dish out of about twenty (I wish that was an exaggeration) that we didn't love. 

We ate and drank until we were completely uncomfortable which is hard to do at a tapas restaurant. For us, this was the best food we had in Vegas."}
{"text":"From SF- 2nd time here and this time for my birthday-hubby's present for me!!!! Love love love this place. pitcher of Sangria....of course!!! but try infused vodka martini! Soooo awesome. Food-gotta try stuffed dates- of the hook! We had 4 other dishes- -also of the hook! Thanks to our friend Andrew for recommending this place! Also our server, Lalo, thank u for taking care of us and for my birthday flan!!! U r awesome!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of customer service, and this place was top notch. If anything the waiter was doing above and beyond his job. He was consistently refilling and double checking that we were doing good. It's sad, but I've truly come to appreciate the people in this town that ACTUALLY do their jobs and don't mope around and spread their negativity on the floor. The only thing I could say I disliked about this place would be the annoying, theater table of 20+ drunk people. You would think maybe a manager would have approached them after they consistently sang songs and yelled random sayings, but I understand where they were coming from, and hey, I mean the people looked like they were having a good time, even though everyone surrounding them were highly annoyed. 

All in all I absolutely love this place, and I'm going to have to say you absolutely have to try the bacon wrapped date with goat cheese and the sangria!"}
{"text":"FireFly is a great place to eat with 3+ hungry people. Their small plates are perfect for sharing and with 6-8 dishes on the table there's plenty of food and variety. The octopus is great, so is the tuna tartar. Steak and chicken skewers were very good as we're the ribs and goat cheese. Service was friendly and fast."}
{"text":"I would like to say \"out of the four day stay in vegas , I had my best meal there.\" I took the advice on the stuffed dates and it was a right choice.  I recommend ordering your tapas 2 at a time because some of the tapas are quite large."}
{"text":"Great service from Daniel! Came in during happy hour and he was on top of everything. Served our food, poured our drinks, and had a great personality. Food and drinks are always great here and inexpensive during happy hour. Thank you for having such great menu options and great service!"}
{"text":"This review is for the wine and the bread. We ordered 4 dishes. The spicy shrimp was ok. The lamb sausage smelled rotten and I wouldn't even take a bite. The clams were fishy and the octopus was mushy. I'm very surprised considering all the good reviews I read before we came here. I'm so disappointed."}
{"text":"This is the best tapas restaurant I've been to in the U.S. The food here is really outstanding and the sangria was perfect. I also concur with other Yelpers that the bacon wrapped dates was the best dish on the menu. The combination of sweet, nuttiness, and savory was just so unusual and unexpected. It's like a really sexy party in your mouth, where you're outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party. 

The atmosphere was intimate and fun. Even on a Sunday night, there were hardly any table to spare, including the outside balcony area. Sort of a youngish, hip crowd. 

We ordered practically everything on the menu, since we wouldn't have a chance to go there very often being out-of-towners. It's really refreshing to eat off of the Vegas Strip. 

A few key points:

-Very good food
-Yummy Sangria
-The price is unbeatable (6 people and the bill came to $136)
-Good vibe/ambiance
-Friendly service

Two thumbs up and a wink!"}
{"text":"We wanted the outdoor seating because we were escaping the cold-weather and wanted to enjoy the 75 degree weather.  The street noise was loud and you have a wonderful view of - a parking lot.  If you are thinking 'fine dining' and want the atmosphere to match the qualify of some of the food, the patio may not be for you, and may not be worth the wait.

The stuffed dates were quite good and 'Tierra y mar' was also a highlight among the 10 items we ordered. Our second round/course (the final three items) was forgotten under the heatlamps, so they were terrible really, absolutely ruined the cheese in one of the dishes.

Careful: the servings are small so if you are hungry you will be ordering many of them... and they add up."}
{"text":"i liked the new location.  sangria was excellent as usual.  we had an assortment of tapas, too many to recount.  the food was excellent as usual.  we sat outside on the patio which is bigger than the old location.  i enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Tapas but really better than I ever had in Spain. We were a group of four and each dish was the perfect size to split between us for individual portion tasters. We ordered two dishes each. We were all starving when we came in and left with full stomaches. This is my second time being here and it's been excellent both times. Get off the strip and come here. Totally worth it!!!"}
{"text":"Seriously GREAT food. Awesome service. Waitress and bus man were on it. Prices reasonable. If/when I come to Vegas again I'll come here for sure. To die for dishes include: Stuffed Peppers and Garlic Lemon shrimp."}
{"text":"Came to Vegas for a Trade show and had the opportunity to check out the Firefly. WOW! If you don't even know what Tapas is, you must begin your food education here, for this is by far is the best Tapas restaurant in the States that I have have encountered. Lots of vegetarian dishes as well, but do try the filet mignon sliders.....to die for. Great service as well, being close to the Las Vegas Convention Center the staff is well seasoned, however, it does get packed when a show is in town . They do take reservations."}
{"text":"I hate when I get a recommendation from Yelp for a good restaurant and it's actually bad. No flavor, nothing I ordered was good. Ugh!"}
{"text":"I love this place - one of my top 5 restaurants ever. Reasonably priced, small portions allow you to try several different items. From the stuffed dates to the notorious mojitos - everything I have had here makes me feel like that cartoon dog who floats in the air and grabs his stomach saying MMMMM MMMMM when he gets a treat."}
{"text":"I was thrilled when this location opened up since I don't always want to drive all the way to Paradise. My friends and I had frequented both other locations many times and Firefly is a staple for me when I'm trying to find a nice inexpensive meal with good ambiance. My friend had never had tapas before and was on a bit of a budget so I figured this would be a great way for her to get a nice variety and still save a bit of cash.

We had about six plates between us and left pretty full. I always have my tomato basil soup, eggplant cannelloni, and one new item. Everything tasted just as great as usual and my friend would not stop raving about her Thai Beef Salad. Service was a bit slow but it was understandable since we hit the lunch crowd and there were a couple of large groups doing holiday parties in the restaurant. Our server still came by frequently to check on us and update us on our food. I'll definitely be coming back to this location more since it saves me the extra 20 minute drive to Paradise!"}
{"text":"I always have the best time when I go to Firefly!

They have amazing food and perfect Sangria's!

I would definitely recommend their bacon wrapped dates - cannot even explain to you how amazing they are!

I would also recommend their steak and mushroom kabob - I do not even like mushrooms and I order this every time I go there - because it is that good!

The only complaint is that it is always crowded and I hate waiting for a table. At least you can sit outside if you would like, or order a drink while you wait."}
{"text":"Every time we come to Las Vegas, my family and I try a different local restaurant. We finally got around to trying this place, and boy was I impressed.

First, I noticed a chic atmosphere with lots of fun lighting and good music, including some fantastic hits from the 80s to Mexican polka gone pop. The hostess and servers were very friendly and accomodating.

I had a pitcher of sangria to myself (wife just hit her third trimester, so I'm drinking for two) and it was incredibly delicious. Less ice, more wine is my only complaint. But still plenty to drink, and considering it was happy hour, it was only $14 and the pitcher was ginormous.

We had the ham and cheese croquettes, veggie empanadas, ceviche, spanish tortilla and firefly fries. Every dish was wonderfully rich and tasted amazing. These fries? Just as good as the truffle fries at Bacchi Burger, and everything that Red Robin WISHES it could serve.

The total was $48 and that included five different tapas and a pitcher of incredible sangria (which soaks for a minimum of three days). Not bad at all considering the amazing experience I had here. Hell, even the free bread was wonderful. And if you sit at the bar during happy hour? Free appetizers!

Bottom line: Don't miss your chance. Eat here. I promise you will not regret it."}
{"text":"The curse of small plates is; you always want to eat more. Combine that with a (my) large appetite and and my size 48, 20 pants are starting to look wider than tall. Samantha and Jesse, our wait crew, worked in perfect sync to fill my gaping maw. I must have looked like a baleen whale feasting on its catch, as I unmercilessly shoved boquerone after boquerone into my face hole. Plate after glorious plate was delivered to my table, the kitchen became a revolving door of delicacies, one could almost hear \"Yakety Sax,\" (the Benny Hill Show song) playing in the background. I simply had to refuse desert, lest I explode like some character from a Monty Python skit..."}
{"text":"We discovered Firefly because it was the closest restaurant to our hotel. We were pleasantly surprised at the wonderful selection of tapas. My favorites are the bacon wrapped dates, tuna tartar, and the infused vodka martinis."}
{"text":"If you only eat one thing in your silly, stupid, little life, eat the bacon wrapped dates at this restaurant. Ridiculous."}
{"text":"You definately have to make reservations for this place. It gets packed during dinner time and it's a rather small joint. I went with a big party so i pretty much tried everything. I really didn't think it was that great, but everyone else LOVED it. The mojito pitchers were good, I didn't know the sangria was that good or else I would have tried that! My fav was the filet mignon sliders.... yum. They have dessert too, but nothing too memorable.   The service was ok, the place gets pretty loud and crowded, but for a big party, it wasn't so bad."}
{"text":"This is my go to place for visiting family and friends.  Fire Fly is perfect for a meal or just a nibble.  Tapas places are plenty in Vegas but none can hold a torch to this best kept secret of our city.  The menu is affordable and delicious, the drinks are made with love and respect, and the Staff can hold its head high!  P.S. Date Night Must!!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing experience! Will definitely come back. Enjoyed all tapas plate. Wife came back for lunch after our great dinner we had."}
{"text":"What a bad experience!

Fireflys has been one of my favorite places for about 4 years now, even after all that occurred with the closure and allegations. 

This time 13 of us went out to celebrate my friends bday. 1st they brought out all the food except my boyfriends, which arrived 10 min later. 2nd my boyfriend almost chocked on a piece of metal. It was clearly a piece of the metal lid of the wine bottle. (Not my bfs day!) 

We told the waiter who called the manager! Wow! What a joke!!! He treated us like if we wanted the meal for free (we didn't even ask for anything). He never apologized however proceeded to tell us that the sangria is filtered 3 times. I don't care!! Hello! He was rude and defensive. We all work in hospitality and honestly wanted to laugh in his face. He asked us what type of sangri we wanted, he would replace the pitcher. (I hope!) we sAid white and he sent out red!!!!!! We told the waitress who called him over and he gave us the nastiest attitude. Wow!! Will not go back! Service went bad in that place. The manager seriously needs as Forbes training."}
{"text":"this is the only enjoyable thing about the plaza hotel.

firefly has great ambiance, and the view is spectacular. the bar staff seemed totally unprepared for us (convention), but handled it well. they remembered the names of my party and reminded us several times not to leave our drinks near the edge of the bar... because for some reason, the bar is SLANTED. not because it has shifted, but because it was built that way. that is brilliant.

the drinks were ok, priced pretty reasonably for vegas. we ordered a bunch of plates and they were all good- the lentils were delicious, the duck rolls were very nice, the octopus was good. 

if you're at the plaza, make sure to check this place out because it's very seriously, the best thing about the hotel... although if you're going to be there anyways, you should probably check out the jerky store too."}
{"text":"luv this place it gets rather busy some nights so its best to sometimes call ahead. Its a laid back joint the meals are cheap but can add up if you get quite a bit of them. I always get the bacon wrapped dates, camarones diabla its shrimp in a spicy sauce really good, tomato soup is good, everythings pretty good. also has pitchers of sangria"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night during prime dining hours. We were seated immediately, which should have been a telling sign in the first place. The service was good. Our server and the support staff were prompt and attentive, and never were left waiting for anything. Well except some taste, or flavor. We ordered 5 plates for the two of us: the mushroom pastry, steak and mushroom skewers, tuna tartare, smoked salmon toasts and some fries. We had plenty of food, but overall, the food was very bland, underseasoned and generally uninspired. The ingredient combinations sounded appealing, but the execution was very poor. The tuna, for example, had zero seasoning of any kind. None. Cubed raw fish with a couple chunks of avocado does not a tartare make. The food wasn't bad, per se, but it could have been substantially better. Even the sangria was underwhelming. Unlikely that we'd return."}
{"text":"I really loved eating here. It as a last minute decision and definitely worth it. The meatballs were unbelievably good and just melted in the mouth. The ribeye was phenomenal and the sauce on it was excellent. I would recommend going here. I will be going back next time I am in Vegas."}
{"text":"I learned about this restaurant from my sister who said we just had to try this place  when we vacation in Vegas. I'm so glad we did! My husband who was hesitant to try tapas, thinking portions would be super small, was pleasantly surprised!

We got seated instantly at around 7PM when they had a crowded dinner hour. Quick service. Had to try the sangria! Loved it! We had chorizo stuffed mushrooms, thai beef salad, mussels, and calamari. Our plates were totally cleaned off. The flan is also excellent here. Great atmosphere and hang out spot. We even had our 2 year old daughter with us and she loved the place. It's loud enough in here for kids and not totally formal. We'll be back next time we're in Vegas."}
{"text":"This place was delicious. They just didn't have any of the beers I wanted. They said they ran out of my selections. That's why I only gave 4 stars."}
{"text":"tapas and sangria are always a good time! love the ambiance and bringing friends here for the first time. they have all loved it and returned. the new location is quite larger but still has a great vibe! 

a few of my favs:

apple and manchego salad (green apple, manchego cheese, smoked almonds, lightly dressed)

stuffed  dates (bacon-wrapped, smoked almond, red wine reduction, blue cheese)

pulpo asado (grilled octopus, potato, tomato, paprika-lemon vinaigrette)

albondigas (meatballs in sherry tomato sauce, parmesan)

chocolate \"tres leches\" cake

this is the perfect spot for a date, birthday dinner or just catching up with a friend.  highly recommended you can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"We were visiting Vegas and decided to go off the strip for some local flavor. Thanks to Yelp, I decided on Firefly and made reservations the same day. We arrived a little early, but even though it was very busy, they had our table ready. We ordered the camarones a la diabla, stuffed dates (they aren't mentioned 28 times on Yelp for nothing), empanadas, and chicken and chorizo stuffed mushrooms. Everything was yummy. I listened to Katelynn L's review and avoided the dishes she mentioned. I would suggest the first 3 dishes for sure. The mushrooms were good, but nothing special that I would reorder. 

By the time we sat down and we finished our dinner, it was 30 minutes. Talk about the fastest service ever!! I don't think it was even 5 minutes before our dishes started coming out after we ordered. The food is wonderful, ambiance is dimly lit but fun. Seems like a great place to go to with a group. The server suggested 2 tapas per person and you can move on from there. We had a large lunch, so 4 plates were perfect. Its a 5 min cab ride to/from the strip, about $8. Its located in a strip mall behind the Palazoo. Cabs are abundant in the evenings when leaving and it seems to get really busy here even on a weekday. Our total bill was $35 and that was also with 2 glasses of sangria.

Its a definite revisit next time I'm back in Vegas. I wish I was hungrier so I could have tried more of the tapas. I'm usually not a HUGE fan of tapas, but I love Firefly! We have a Baba-Reeba in Chicago and I would suggest this place over that, though I haven't tried the Baba-Reeba in Vegas."}
{"text":"What a lucky find. I was planning a birthday dinner for a friend and was referred to firefly by a local homeslice. First off the place is a non casino off the strip type joint, so that was a major plus in my book. The place was small, and intimate and allowed you to socialize with friends. The wait staff was excellent, the food was awsome - but a little slow coming even though the place was not to busy. All in all, this is now one of my favorite places for eats and drinks!"}
{"text":"Very good tapas.  We went with the Tuna Tartare, Stuffed Dates, Patatas Brevas, Mushroom Tart, Fried Calamari, Grilled Scallops, Albondigas, Ham and Cheese Croquetas, and Serrano Sliders.  It was a great meal that my wife and I shared.  My favorite was the tuna tartare, my wifes favorite was the mushroom tart.  All the food was great, aside from the calamari which was overcooked.  The service was great and the staff was all very attentive to our needs.  We really wanted to try some dessert but as you can see we went all out for our main meal/s.  I definitely will come back to this place next time I am in Vegas."}
{"text":"Not as good as I had hoped it would be. Paella tasted like there was far too much tomato paste, and we didn't get one crispy piece of rice.  We would have made our server aware of this, if he had ever come back to our table, besides to ask if we got our bill after we had already paid. It was also a let down that the old scallops were off the menu; new version was not as good. Other apps (dates, stuffed mushrooms, beet/pear salad) were just OK. I've had my fill of Firefly."}
{"text":"great addition to Downtown ! 

I am a firefly on Paradise fan , to expand the ops to Downtown where i prefer to get my gamble on - this is great !! 

can't vouch for the menu being exactly the same as the mothership but it looks about right . 

1/2 price sangria and other libations - all good too ( even though the gf doesn't drink - i went with the pitcher of sangria for $12 - the bartender said it was equal to 4 drinks - i call bullshit on that one - it was more like 8 glasses - great deal !! ) 

we had some of the usual items - dates, meatballs, shrimp, sausage platter, etc etc ( pics attached ) 

besides my monthly trek to the Flame at el C ( don't knock it - i still think it's the best value in downtown - try the stone crabs - or for the meat eaters - the prime rib ) i plan to hit firefly, at least 1/ month. 

hit it a 2nd time on friday with my sis - the place was hoppin' ! just missed the happy hour - it's ok - tried the sparkling sangria this time - nice starter drink - my sis had an infused vodka drink and later the raspberry mojito - she liked it ! 

for this visit - tried the sliders - the meat tasted great - bun a little too big, loved the mushroom stuffed with chorizo; calamari - ok. loved the shrimp/filet/sausage skewer. 

Downtown is gettin better !"}
{"text":"We had a large group at this amazing restaurant and our experience was EXCELLLENT! We had two top notch servers taking care of our large group. They went above and beyond the entire night. Many thanks and KUDOS to Neo & Marcus. I've been doing large group dinners for over 20 years and can't say I've ever had anyone as spot on as these two guys. I'll also add, all the food we had was great, but the Paella was over the top DELISH!!!
Will definitely repeat, again and again. I highly recommend for any type of group event!"}
{"text":"Great Tapas.... Not \"authentic\", they have a blend of traditional and American \"Tapas\" dishes, but everything was very good.  Would recommend in a heartbeat!  Order the Sangria."}
{"text":"Every. Single. Thing. I tried was delicious.

Sorry, its annoying when people write like that but I was trying to convey my point. I picked this spot for a dinner during a business trip with coworkers. I wanted something off the strip with a lot of variety and this place had promising ratings. 

I can't remember everything we had because we started ordering a bunch of different tapas off the menu. I do remember delicious empanadas and patatas bravas though! Their sangria is a must try! I had a reservation, so we were promptly seated even though we were missing a couple of people. Service was fairly quick even though this place was packed for a Wednesday night. 

Thank you to all the Yelpers who led me to this place. I impressed the big bosses and they left with a new favorite restaurant to visit during future visits! Please get off the strip for a bit and visit this place - you will not regret it!!"}
{"text":"Loud!  Very loud.  parking in the rear.

Great bar staff!  I was very happy sitting at the bar and ordering from there.

As for the price, I mean, it's Tapas...  It's not going to be cheap.  It's also meant to be social and shared.  I had some pretty typical dishes (apple manchego salad, stuffed dates, croquettes, and the shrimp ceviche)  They were all very good but I fully admit that I didn't stray too far from my likes."}
{"text":"This is one of the best tapas places I've been to. We walked about 30 minutes to get to this place, but it was worth every step. It is not directly on the strip and appears to be more of a local spot. 

Service was perfect. The food was perfect. Portions and timing was perfect. The sangria (we had the red) was a complete pitcher and not filled with ice....that was good. ;) 

I didn't feel so guilty with my over consumption of food and wine after we walked back to the strip after dinner.  

This is a fabulous find if you are not afraid to venture off the beaten path. We will definitely return on our next trip."}
{"text":"oh, like dimsum, like izakaya. mini plates.

overall, very good. waiter offered great suggestions and they were spot on.  (dates, lamb chops, mac n cheese).  looks like a great chill spot for drinks, too.  and even the sangrias at the other table looked gooooooood.

will come back again!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch with friends and let me just say: get that Croque Senora! Much good. Very wow. Even came with two tapas sides (apple salad and patatas bravas were the ones we opted for).

My friends insisted that their standard tapas must be tried, so we did a combination of brunch dishes and tapas, which was a fantastic choice. There was not a single item that did not taste good. Even the complimentary bread with butter was bomb diggity. I especially enjoyed their scallop escargot, which came out piping hot, silky soft, and swimming in little pots of garlic herb butter. The ribs and goat cheese plate was also delicious. By far the best tapas I've ever had.

And did I mention the absolute BESTEST sangria ever?! Because if you've been looking, this is where it lives. So come for the Sangria and definitely stay for the food."}
{"text":"Fantastic cocktails. 

Good selection of tapas and a handful of full meal size plates. Offers paella but me he advises it takes 40 minutes to prepare.

Stuffed Dates - excellent, would get again
Baked Goat Cheese - good, Italian tasting
Empanada (pork) - pass
Baby back Ribs - good, mango salsa had an unexpected kick."}
{"text":"FOOD

Artichoke points- very good, light flavor (order)

Mushroom toast- puff pasty with a nice sauce, big portion (order)

Calamari- standard (skip)
Shrimp, a la diabla- good sauce, shrimp cooked well (up to you)
Tierra y mar- very good cuts of meat, chorizo is quite tasty (order)

ATMOSPHERE

We ate on the patio, which was nice. Good music as well.

SERVICE

We did not wait at all on a Sunday at 9:30pm. There were three waiters buzzing around. Good service. Ribs took 10-15 minutes to prepare.

PRICE

We were a party of 4. Without drinks, including tax, the bill was $73. With tip, we paid $87. That's about $22 per person.

OVERALL

I'll be checking out other places first, but I'll find my way back one day."}
{"text":"Everytime I came to Vegas, my cousin would tell me to come here. Never had the chance until this past weekend and it was well worth the visit. 

The food is really good here. Tapas style so you can just order a whole array of things. Got both the white and red sangria. I liked the red better but I think it's just a matter of preference between a red wine or white wine. 

Ordered so many things and they were all delicious. 
Artichoke Toast - the artichoke is cold on warm bread, I prefered the salmon toast
Salmon Toast - this was delicious. Smoked salmon, capers, onions on toast
Tuna Tartare - came with taro chips, I love tuna tartare so it was one of my favorites
Baked Filet of Tilapia - this had some crispy onions on top, simple/clean flavors
Fried Calamari - this was just an average dish, you can find it anywhere
Steamed Mussels - the sauce that came with this was really good. creamy and delicious. 
Chorizo Clams - these were recommended, and I really liked them. The chorizo gave a nice kick. 
Camarones a la Diabla - I loved the sauce that came with this. A little heat and the shrimp were cooked perfectly. 
Chicken & Chorizo stuffed Mushrooms - One of my favorites. I'm not normally a fan of chicken in anything, but these were delious! 
Crispy Duck Rolls - this was the only semi asian dish on the menu, it comes with a cherry hoison sauce. It was really good and meaty
Stuffed Dates - this wasn't a favorite but it's the most popular dish there. Sweet and bacon don't go together in my mind
Thai Beef Salad - didn't get to try this... but from what I saw it disappeared quick for a reason
Parmesean Fries - Love this! The aioli dip that came with it was a perfect match

Definitely will make a trip back here when I get the chance again!"}
{"text":"We come here twice a year with about 25-30 people. The service is always great, the food is amazing and we all have a really great time!! The place is always packed on the weekend so make reservations!"}
{"text":"Really liked this place.  Service was good.  Really worth it to get off the strip and have a nice meal without the whole strip experience.  Tapas selection was good.  Good for kids, assuming they will eat the tapas."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness , do I ever love this place.  Tapas is my absolute favorite, and this place is heavenly.  It's a few blocks off the strip (cab it people, don't walk), and it's happily not as Vegas-y and glitter-y as other Vegas establishments.  We had a variety of tapas plates, but the mac and cheese was my favorite.  The white sangria was also delicious with lots of fresh fruit.  You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"oh
my 
damn
this place is amazing. my aunt lives in las vegas and everytime we go there we eat here. great place. very good vibe. the environment is adult and just is a good hang out dinner nightlife spot. the food is amazing. get the fries. the cheese fries or howver you call it. its good. no joke."}
{"text":"Needed a late evening light meal after getting to Vegas. Found that Firefly was near my hotel, which is near the Convention Center. The food was very good as well as the service."}
{"text":"Came here twice this trip! Ordered tons of tapas and let me tell you! They were all just perfect..the meats succulent, tender and full of flavor! And for the non-meat eaters, they have quite a few vegetarian options. This will be my go to whenever I'm in Vegas! And the service was awesome!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Amazing food, great drinks and over all fun place to be. Found out about from some locals and feel like We had the inside track to great food at a good price! We will be back."}
{"text":"when it came time to pick a group dinner for my bday, i knew i wanted to go off strip since i dont really get the chance to

ordered a feast for 10:
-tomato bread
-shrimp ceviche
-tuna tartare
-patatas bravas
-stuffed dates
-shrimp, filet, chorizo skewers
-calamari
-shrimp in lemon garlic butter 
-albondigas
-empanadas
-chicken and mushroom paella
-mixed paella
-sangria

everything was amazing and glad everyone in my group loved it too"}
{"text":"Cool place with a fun vibe. Perfect tapas place that embodies the small plate concept really well. Dishes are flavorful and authentic. Great music too. We went late at night and it was still bustling with a lot of people. There was also a separate area for dancing for which I believe there is an entry fee. We had 6 plates between 3 of us and were pretty full. Octopus, clams, lamb sausage, lamb chops etc were all delicious. Plenty of more diahes to try for which I am going to go back next time I am in Vegas."}
{"text":"Firefly catered my Husband's birthday party at an off site location. Great quality for the price. Everyone was pleased. Regina was very helpful and Sandy was great too."}
{"text":"Yummy food and variety! Caters to both vegetarians and nonvegetarians. For nonveggies, I recommend the grilled scallops, bacon wrapped dates, chicken empanadas and the chicken and chorizo stuffed mushrooms. For veggies, the patatas bravas, mac n cheese, and the parmesan fries were my favorite. Those fries were just amazing - very well seasoned! And the red sangria was better than the white but definitely not the best I've had. The ambience was great - djm with red and black decor, which matched perfectly with our bachelorette party attire theme of red and black :) only downside was that it's off the strip and it was a pain getting a taxi from there. May want to get a taxi number and call them in advance."}
{"text":"This place has probably one of the best mojitos in town. I am not a big fan of cocktail drinks but I constantly crave their mojitos here. Especially during the summer time. The strawberry one is really good. Food here is pretty good too. The portion sizes are not really that big considering their prices. I do like their complimentary bread and butter. Sometimes they do \"forget\" to serve it so make sure you ask for it. I love their fries. The menu has a pretty good selection of tapas. Not a lot of entrees though. I honestly haven't tried anything from here that I did not like. I just wish that their portions were bigger or the prices were a little lower. Try this place. And do not forget to try any of their mojitos. Outside seating during the summer time isn't bad either because they have mists to keep you cool."}
{"text":"Love love love this place! It's a great starter place to get your night going!

The last time I came here was with a group of girls for a friends birthday. We were all dressed up but didn't feel out of place. You can come dolled up or causal as well. 

We have come here several times now and ever time we've had good service. The food is very tasty as well. We always get the garlic fries and the Steak Skewers. We also try to order something new each time we visit.

The only downfall is that we had to what an hour before being seated the past 2 visit but it was well worth it. 

We'll continue to bring our visitors here and friends that haven't been here yet. I look forward to the next Firefly visit."}
{"text":"Great menu, fast service, nice atmosphere, reasonable prices. This place is always packed, but our wait time was minimal, and once we were seated, service was really good, and really fast without making us feel rushed at all. The food was very good. The only caveat I'd make is that the traditional tapas, especially the empanadas and croquetas are not as good as we had in Spain, but that is being awfully picky. They were some of the best we have had outside of Spain, by far. There are more vegetarian options than average, too. If I go back to Vegas, this is one of only two restaurants I'd bother to revisit, after spending two weeks there in the last 2 years."}
{"text":"Maria & Chino were awesome and took care of me! The strawberry mojito was perfection and fresh! They had an extensive gluten free and vegetarian menu. I ordered the baked tetilla, stuffed dates and stuffed peppers. It was mild in spice, but still delicious!"}
{"text":"I had about enough Vegas strip food as I could handle for a bit and wanted to try some local places.  I called up my friend from Vegas and she took me to Firefly!  I would never have thought to come here and I would never have found.

I had her order all of her favourite items and we had a feast!

Meats on a stick?  YES PLEASE!
Garlicy goodness?  Don't stop!
Raw seafood?  More!
BACON ANYTHING!

Yes I really enjoyed my meal here.  I'd recommend trying something from each section of the menu as there are a lot of delicious items.  I wish I had the stomach and time to try everything!"}
{"text":"As I write this I believe this is the last Firefly left in the area. It's a shame because the ladies absolutely love this place and it's always a winner for date night or nights out with friends. Tapas is a lot of fun, and this location is in a newer building with tons of seating and not far from the strip. The Firefly name has unfortunately been marred by multiple restaurant closings from the health department, so they've gone from three or four locations down to only one. It's a little pricey, but you plan to spend a little and you won't have any surprises, and there are plenty of great menu options to choose from."}
{"text":"Have always been passing by this place whenever I'm in town. But I'm so glad we finally gave it a try. The place is packed even on a Monday night! My cousins who live in Vegas said that they always had to wait to be seated most of the time. So I was surprised that they had room for 5 of us in no time. Considering that they are busy, service was still very fast and efficient. The lighting was dimmed but the place was very well decorated. Here are some of the things we ordered:

-watermelon mojito: be warned. The yummieness hides the true power of the rum.. After 2 pitchers we had to stop before we all become too drunk to go home 

-sausage plate:came with 3 kinda of meats with Dijon mustard spread. It was good because the meats were sliced thinly enough so you can enjoy the flavors

-tuna tartare: came with taro chips. Sooooo gooooooddddd!!! Perfectly seasoned an balanced out with some avocado chunks

-calamari: it was good. It came in a bigger plate too.. Best for sharing!

-chorizo and cheese fondue: I forgot the name of the dish but it was very rich!! If you like cheese and spicy sausage then this one's for you!

-tuna stuffed peppers- has a medium spicy kick which reminds me of spicy sardines

-lamb skewers: tasted like a smokey savory lamb BBQ so good!!


-chorizo stuffed mushrooms: again, cheesy gooey and meaty all in one bite 

-smoked salmon crostini: tasted good, but it's the usual cream cheese,dill and salmon in toasted bread. 

-stuffed peppers: not a big fan of cream cheese but this was surprisingly not creamy. The peppers were baked to perfection and came out tender and sweet

-lamb chops: 2 lamb chops $10. I think that's a pretty good deal. And the flavor? Omg perfectly grilled and seasoned in a bed of peppers and lentils. This for me was the best out of all of them.

The prices range from $4.50-12.00 so if you're pretty adventurous with food and want a little bit of everything, grab a few friends and head on over the fire fly. Trust me, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Great food. Especially the Paella. Everything was just a tad pricey, but the atmosphere was good (lounge-type) and the Sangria was excellent. According to one member of our party, the mojito was amazing. Late night eateries are obviously common in Sin City, but not many are upscale like this."}
{"text":"Ate here a month or so ago, got violently ill.  Not sure if it is a result of the issues they are having with the salmonella outbreak that affected 200 people in 20 states and 4 countries.  Food wasn't too bad on the way down...  Wish it would have stayed down, can't say I would recommend ever going back."}
{"text":"The new place is very nice. Great bar, great staff, great food. A good variety on the menu. TVs in the bar and a good Happy Hour."}
{"text":"Thank you fellow Yelpers! Without you, I would have never known about this hidden gem off the strip! 

We took advantage of the unusually early happy hour (4-5p) but since we were still operating on East Coast time, our bodies thought it was 7pm! All of the drinks, wines are half price so we got in under the wire at 4:45pm. The place was jam packed! Now I know why! They served the best tapas I have ever tasted in my life! (And I have been all over Spain!) Here's the rundown on what we sampled:

Artichoke toasts (hearts, aioli, basil, pepper...mmmmm!)

Roasted eggplant cannelloni (goat cheese, tomato sauce....Absolutely mouthwatering, the tomatoe sauce is to die for!)

Lamb skewers (marinated leg of lamb, tomato, sautéed lentils, red wine sauce...Succulent!)

Steak and mushroom skewers([grilled filet, roast garlic cream, red wine reduction..The steak melts in your mouth and the red wine sauce is delightful!

The portions were ample enough so that we were confortably satisfied after sampling the above mentioned tapas selections. 

An incredible value, our dinner check with tip and tax was under $50! 

And the service was excellent as well!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I stopped by here, due to such high praise from everyone else out there, and to our liking it truly was a great place!  The view is great overlooking fremont st at night and the ambience of the place is very chill.  Our waitress was very friendly and knowledgeable. The food was sensational!  My girl got the cosmo martini and I got the mojito both good.  The food was great, i luv eating tapas, not to much but not to little.  We ordered the surf and turf kabob which had shrimp, sausage, and fliet mignon on a kabob stick, that was very yummy.  But the best was the camarones diabla and the mac and cheese!  Seriously maybe the best mac and cheese i've ever had.  The camarones diabla was amazing to, the shrimp and the sauce they use is so tasty!  I definitely need to come back!"}
{"text":"The food here is the best. Every tapa is we had was delicious. The dates was the great. The lamb chops and lentil were the best. Along with the steak and mushrooms. Steak was tender and the mushrooms were great. Dessert was great. Have to try to chocolate cherry bread pudding. This will become a place I visit every time. The service was top notch. Our server Mario was outstanding and very knowledgable with his recommendations. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Fan.Tas.Tic. My friend who is a Yelp Elitist created a yelp restaurant list for us during our trip to Vegas the past weekend.  Although it is not on the strip, Firefly was still located in restaurant mecca where Lawry's is etc.  Our favorite dish of the evening was the LOBSTER ESCARGOT.  Had a very amazingly familiar taste (mmm, all that butter!).  Better yet, it was lobsters rather than snails!  It was excelo!

Granted I had a four month old baby with me, I still had a great time.  There were times my baby cried, but the place was smashed with lots of people and a lot of noise, I or anyone around me couldn't even notice the sound of a crying baby.  

Ambiance rocks with a dim pink lighting, reminding me of the atmosphere a firefly brings to a night sky. Fun setting for a group of friends! Maybe not so much for a romantic one on one date."}
{"text":"Kind of mixed review here. We had a large group, they were extremely easy to deal with. We did want something not too expensive, they did an amazing job with this. The food was quite good, but not amazing. Spanish food is not my favorite either, but it's decent. Overall they were great to a large party. Kudos."}
{"text":"Food: 3.5 stars
Service: 2 stars
Atmosphere: 1 star

You will leave this place with ringing in your ears. It is as loud as a night club, which makes for a totally unromantic, get-me-outta-here dinner experience. Service was rushed and felt IHOPish. Food is nothing special, and when you can't hear yourself think, you don't really care what it tastes like. Sangria was too sweet. Definitely not worth going when there are so so many dining options."}
{"text":"This place was amazing!! I've been trying to find a place like this in San Diego,  Unfortunately, I will have to miss this until I go back to Vegas.  

This place is always crowded on the peak times people usually want to eat.  But my friends and I got very lucky having the munchies so late at night and on the weekday.  

The most unforgettable tapas for me was the Stuffed Dates!  Bacon wrapped, creamy filling and just a perfect blend of taste all the way around.  Who doesn't like bacon?  Maybe Vegetarians will be transformed to be meat eaters after eating this dish.  

They have a pretty good sangria and I love their restaurant set up.  I felt very comfortable especially in their large booths for large groups!  

I suggest you come early and make reservations!"}
{"text":"This is my first time visiting Firefly and I was thoroughly content with my experience.  The menu was huge, but my waiter at Firefly really knew the menu and advised me well! The food was amazing! I'll definitely return."}
{"text":"Read the reviews on Yelp, and decided to give it a try.  Glad we made reservations.  Place was packed mainly with many groups and some couples.

All the food was delicious.  Our waitperson, Irina, and her main helper, Jesus, were attentive and personable.  5 Stars to them.

Only negative was the noise.  It was hard to listen and talk.  Would have rated it a \"5\" if the noise level wasn't so high.

We had the chicken & mushroom paella (if you like paella, make sure you order it as soon as you sit down - takes awhile to prepare), beet salad, warm spinach salad, merguez (lamb sausage) and chocolate tres leche cake.  It makes my mouth water, just writing this down!"}
{"text":"This place was highly recommended to be by a few people, and I had really high expectations. The bad part about high expectations is that most of the time they are not met. However, Firefly went above and beyond, and I absolutely loved it.

This restaurant serves Tapas, which is basically small plates and/or appetizers. Our table decided to just order a bunch of these small dishes and share them all, which was nice because it would have been so difficult to just select one! Everything we ordered tasted fresh and amazing, and have AMAZING flavor - from the stuffed dates to the mac n cheese to the tuna tartare. For us, they brought out the dishes one by one, so we were able to focus on one dish at a time, passing it around the table for everyone to serve themselves. It is quite a different experience than most restaurants, but I definitely enjoyed this method. We also ordered a pitcher of Mango Mojitos, which we SO yummy. The mango did not taste artificial at all. 

The atmosphere of this restaurant is pretty modern and artistic. We had a unique dinner because we were able to experience both the inside and outside seating. At first, we chose to sit outside because there were beautiful round fairy lights, and the inside seating seemed a bit to dark for my liking.  We really loved sitting outside, until the thunderstorm started! We were quickly moved inside, just before the large amounts of water soaked through the thin cotton overhang. The inside has a great ambiance - dark and candlelit - but I did like the outside more, before the storm obviously. 

The staff was very accommodating and helpful, especially when we had to quickly move inside. They said \"grab your drinks, and we will take care of the rest\". It was very nice of them to brave the storm outside which got crazy pretty quickly.  Our server was also very friendly, and was helpful with our questions about the menu. This is amazing quality food for not that expensive, ESPECIALLY for Vegas.  I don't know if/when I will be back to Vegas, but if I do, I will definitely be coming here again!"}
{"text":"This was a fantastic place to grab some delicious Tapas with a friend.  We ordered more than needed but everything was delicious!  The service was amazing and the food just kept arriving at short intervals.  The atmosphere was fun and festive although a little too loud for easy conversation.  Firefly will definitely be one of my top go-to places in Vegas."}
{"text":"Went here mid day and ate at the bar. Great friendly& fast service. Tapas were top notch.
Truly a gem off the Strip. Will be back next time we are in Vegas."}
{"text":"As a vegetarian dragging a Spanish boy into a restaurant off the strip I was nervously skeptical. There were 9 of us dining and not one of us had a complaint about food, service, drinks or price. The tapas were larger than you would find in Spain, or so I was told, but aesthetically and pallately pleasing. The wines were delicious featuring popular Spanish, Argentinean, and Californian wines. We had pitchers of strong tasty sangria and mojitos and spent a solid three hours laughing and eating. I highly recommend this place to any one looking for a delish tapas bar in Las Vegas. 

The patatas bravas were under cooked inside, crispy on the outside and way too oily, but the artichoke appetizer is to DIE for. 

The service was prompt and friendly but some of our orders went to other tables and some other tables' food came to ours! Is that really a reason to dock them a whole star? No; but that and the lack of tiny tapas (showcasing the American need to have everything \"bigger and better\") are good reasons. Overall, I loved the experience and would gladly dine there again."}
{"text":"Maybe we went on an off night? Everything we ordered was just bleh. The service wasn't terrible but I did feel like we had to flag down our waitress a lot. There are so many better restaurants in Vegas."}
{"text":"Not only was the food great, but the service was magnificent. Food came out quickly, and soft drinks were refilled constantly. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"I have tried Camarones a la diabla (spicy shrimp), Smoked Salmon Bagel, Chicken Skewers and all of them were tasty."}
{"text":"Love this place when coming to Vegas. Great food, prices and atmosphere. Know they recently had some issues and closed a location but I'm sure they're even better now."}
{"text":"Our friends recommended it atter a good dinner experience. We really liked Firefly...spicy shrimp, potatas bravas, merguez lamb sausages, stuffed peppers, and pimientos were sweet and spicy. AND for dessert the flan was SOO good. Service was fast. They were really good with clearing our table. the hubs liked the lychee/blackberry infused vodka.
The only issue was getting a cab back to the Strip took us about 30 minutes. not the restaurant's fault though. they called for us. It was just a bad time as people were probably headed to the airport or lunch."}
{"text":"Firefly is amazing. Unlike many Spanish Tapas restaurants that have only a handful of outstanding 'signature' dishes, Firelfy is excellent at almost everything. There is no need to ask what is good here because there are simply no wrong choices on the menu. You will be happy no matter what you order.

I can't believe how efficient the service was. Food came out so fast I almost suspect they were just reheating it. My suspicion quickly went away once I bited into the sinfully crispy bacon wrapped stuffed date. Everything on my plates was perfectly prepared. Tender meat cooked just right. Tasty sauce that compliments but not overwhelms. Let's not forget about the drinks. It was difficult to turn down their sangaria. The only thing I wasn't too impressed was the desserts. Had their dessert platter. Nothing really stood out and I was definitely expecting a better tres leches. 

It is impossible to find another restaurant in Vegas that would measure up to Firefly's quality and value. Food is very reasonably priced. Service was great. Not formal and fancy but down to earth and friendly. The restaurant is really big too so getting a table is not as hard as other popular places. I would eat here any day and skip all the overpriced mediocre restaurants on the strip. I wish SF bay area has a tapas place this great."}
{"text":"We celebrated our adult daughter's birthday here (her choice) on a Saturday night.  I was happy they took reservations and was informed by the hostess that it was a $25 dollar minimum for larger parties during the weekend.  There were thirteen of us and I figured a drink a person and food no problem and encouraged everyone to eat-up.

The atmosphere was festive, the service was spectacular.  The food was tasty, but after sampling quite a few of the dishes I was a bit overwhelmed with too many sauces and mixtures of taste.  Others in our party had no problem.  

My husband was asking for the entree menu and everyone in our party laughed.  My daughter had to explain a couple of times that they serve tapas and only a few entrees, none that he cared for.  We never received the bread that everyone raves about, unfortunately I read the reviews after eating here or I would of asked for it.

The sangria was delicious.

$700 plus later, seemed a bit much for appetizers and drinks.  We did enjoy ourselves, but not really our cup of tea."}
{"text":"The tapas size is generally larger than those tapas restaurant that I have been too. Food was delicious. The mussel dish and padron peppers were two of my favorites. Definitely would like to come back when I am in town again."}
{"text":"Sooooooo good!  Excellent Tapas for a chain restaurant. Plate of Serrano ham and Manchego cheese, Stuffed dates, Patatas bravas, Mushroom tart, Tierra y Mar skewers°, Ham and cheese croquetas, Filet mignon sliders°, and Cabernet Sauvignon by JAM from Napa, CA were all very excellent.  The Cab was some of the best I've ever had.  The stuffed dates made me copy the dish at home - made it numerous times throughout the holidays.  Atmosphere was super loud, but then again I believe it was a December holiday weekend evening.  However, we did sit \"outside\" in the screened-in porch with a patio heater and all was good - not as loud as inside."}
{"text":"Hey, don't tell anyone but this is one of the best spots to visit in Las Vegas, The food is excellent and price to fit your wallet. Good service and good food. Try everything. There is no miss. With a group, make a party of it. You and a friend. Share. To make your stay even better. Get a waiter like Gabriel. He's the best!"}
{"text":"This is our go to place every time we visit Vegas. The new location is awesome! Waaaay better than the old location. Seems like there's more room. Tables are spread out and spacious, not how it was cramped and cluttered before. Food is always good! I recommend checking this place out. Best tapas spot!"}
{"text":"It was a warm evening in Vegas so we decided to take a walk down to the Bellagio and watch the fountain show. At first we thought maybe we'd eat in the Bellagio, but after looking around on Yelp we found this tapas bar with pretty good reviews. 

We hailed a cab and took the short ride to Firefly on Paradise. It was packed at 8:30pm, people outside waiting with drinks in hand, the bar jammed, all the tables filled with cheerful people. Looks like a happy place to eat and celebrate another great weekend with my girlfriend. 

So we check out the menu and literally decide to order 3/4's of the dishes offered. The waiter , who was a friendly soul tried to persuade us to only order half, we overruled him and said (\"bring it on\") we're hungry. 

I'm not sure if it was just to busy, but the food was just average, it almost tasted as if it had been prepared ahead of time. The breads weren't toasted, the lamb chops so so, serrano ham covered in peppers (big mistake), mussels and clams OK just not memorable. I can go on and on talking about the calamari, stuffed peppers, white anchovies (great) duck egg rolls, tuna tar tare, octopus and potatoes, but in the end Firefly on Paradise is just OK. Not terrible but far from a Lola Gaspar. After eating close to 15 dishes we thought it best to walk back to the hotel."}
{"text":"What a view, looking through the window you see all of Fremont. Its like a carnival, especially around the holidays. I had dinner here with a group of six and that gave us the opportunity to order quite a few dishes on the menu. 

What makes this a 4 star restaurant is the fact your in Vegas, its lively and the location and view are incredible. After a few drinks and making some cash at the tables everything seemed perfect ( I'm sure it was the alcohol). 

Our order consisted of the following: 
Stuffed dates,padron peppers, chicken and chorizo stuffed mushrooms, patatas brava,lamb chops, firefly fries, roasted eggplant,tuna tartare, baby beet salad,boqueones(anchovies), spicy chorizo, baby greens, and lots of delicious sangria. 

It was a great evening of fun and good food."}
{"text":"Tasty tapas restaurant off the strip. Their food is very good, especially the complimentary bread with the addicting honey almond butter! I could eat the bread and butter all day! Like more tapas restaurants, you'll need to order multiple items to get full, if that's your intention. The Sangria is recommended, also. There were 3 of us and we each ordered 2 dishes plus a pitcher of sangria. The sangria might have caused us to feel full but it was worth it. I ordered the skewer and the potato dish. I don't recall what my friends ordered. There is a dance floor adjacent to the entrance and it's a pretty lively place. I would recommend this restaurant if you want to get away from the strip."}
{"text":"This place was delicious and the prices are not bad either. For a party of 6, our tab was only about $150. Some of the stand out dishes included the stuffed dates & the mac n cheese. They have both red & white sangria which is great and overall the service was great. I'd come back again, but there are so many other Vegas restaurants I want to try when I'm visiting. I'll eventually come back I'm sure..."}
{"text":"The bacon wrapped dates are awesome! Just order them!"}
{"text":"When I first arrived at Firefly I didn't see the signs for parking in the rear so I thought it was really empty.  I parked in the rear and had to walk past the dumpster with a man rummaging through it.  

I sat at the bar.  The redheaded server was very sweet and know her menu items.  I was especially impressed when she told me what looked good out of the kitchen that night.
I started with the Salmon Toasts.  They had very good flavors but tasted very similar to bagel and loxs(should have listened to the waitress).
The second dish I ordered was the shrimp Diablo.  The sauce was a perfect mix of spicy and sweet.  The shrimp were cooked perfectly.  
The third dish I ordered was the lamb chops.  They too were delicious.  I would not recommend them if you're in a large party.  
Overall the food was good.  The service was great.  One critique would be the presentation of the dishes.  They could have made them look a little better with the small plates."}
{"text":"Omg what a fantastic treasure! I'm vegan & my girlfriend is GF & a carnivore. ;) We love to share food but can't always do so. This wonderful restaurant accommodated is both. We had the vegan paella, fries, so many delicious items, clearly labeled. Wonderful servers. Just an amazing experience. I literally went here three nights in a row! They even brought us olives when they knew we couldn't have bread. A++ service!"}
{"text":"My wife and I visited Firefly during a recent trip to CES.  Locals and our LA friends recommended this place to us.  The food is pretty tasty.  In fact I was impressed.  I recall our waiter being super friendly."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, very reasonably priced. Good service. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best restaurants in Vegas! Try the camaronnes al ajillo, you will not be disappointed. Prices are very fair for the quality of the food being served. This is not a place to leave stuffed without spending some money. It is rather a place to eat quality food."}
{"text":"service was great. Cozy restaurant.  Mojito was delish!  We came with 11 definitely was good to have a reservation.  Favorite was the tuna tartare and chorizo clams.  We had at least 20 items and all were great. Lemon berry tarts are a must! Will come back to vegas just to go here"}
{"text":"The menu intrigued us, but the food is only so-so.  The kitchen has a very heavy hand on sauces, drowning the food and most the flavor.

For example, the Thai beef salad.  The beef tasted good.  But the lettuce was drowning in sauce.  On top of the beef salad, a heap of fried crunchy strips that you find on Chinese Chicken Salad.  Below, there's even more fried crunchy strips SOAKED is sauce.  We ordered this because they don't have many green vegetables on their tapas list.

\"vegetables and lentils\" =' carrots and celery.

The boquerones that come with roasted red pepper and yellow pepper \"vin\" is also overpowering.  There's also dotted aioli on the plate.   You can't taste the fish which makes you wonder if the chef and staff hate boquerones as it's total disrespect for the ingredient.

The chorizo clams is more like a chili with so much cumin and chili oil, it's diarrhea in a bowl.  I could totally see Anthony Bourdain doing a schtick about this dish on No Reservations.

The roasted tomato basil soup was plain and comforting.  Especially in light of the heavy sauces overpowering the palate.

Albondigas pretty tasty.

But the service.  It ain't Picasso even though there's faux Picassos hanging.  And service doesn't even come close to the strip.  Unprofessional and uneven.  Bus boys work pretty hard, and ours was no exception.  Our waiter, however, was more interested in flirting with single women patrons and other staff.    We had to ask two people to get our waiter as he left us hanging with appetizers (3!) and no wine.  He still didn't come.  Uh hello, people want wine WITH their meal.  We even made that clear when we sat down.  We just needed a moment to go through the wine list. 

It's also obvious when there's all this SAUCE left over and separation of food from the sauce that something is wrong with the dishes.  The waiter chose to remain oblivious.  

Happy Hour from 3-6."}
{"text":"We got the mushroom tart & the petite filet. Both were great. The Petite Filet was surprisingly big (and amazing). Can't recommend highly enough for Tapas!"}
{"text":"At first I was quite hesitant about this place since I am from California and not familiar with places to eat in Las Vegas.  However, after eating at this place, I am definitely coming back to eat there the next time I visit.  The food was superb!  I ate here in a group of 15 people.  The bill was quite expensive for our group, so that may be something you want to consider if you plan on having more than just a few friends out with you.  Even though it was very pricy, the food was phenomenal.  They serve small portions, but you savor every bite.  The sangria was good as well.  Service was very fast and the environment was so enjoyable we ended up staying there for well over two hours.  The wait to get in since we didn't have reservations was easily thirty minutes, and the waiting area was so packed we had to wait outside (it was around 10 PM).  This place is worth at least one visit if not more than that."}
{"text":"I had never had tapas before. Did not even know what it was. My son suggested this for lunch. 
It was amazing. the food was so good. by far one of the best meals I have ever had in Las Vegas. 
The Artichoke Toast was my favorite. Everything I tried was delicious. 
The service was excellent. 
I can't wait to go back and try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Mac & cheese is the best I've ever had!

I always have a good time when I'm here with friends, good atmosphere and I love small bites :) i'd say Im 70/30 with the menu. I either really like what was ordered or I don't care for it at all. But overall a good spot to eat with friends"}
{"text":"I've never ventured off the south end of the Strip to eat before (how sad is that?), but after finding this place, I'm so glad I did! I'm dying to go back to Vegas, just so I can go here again. It's reasonably priced, the tapas are all delicious (I can't think of a single thing we didn't like) and the mojitos are very tasty.

Make a reservation, though! It's pretty busy."}
{"text":"First, the place is HUGE. I loved the layout, as there are different spaces: Dining, plenty of bar area, and a large patio. It's all very spacious and when the weather is nice, the whole place feels very open and airy when the patio doors are open.

The food was great as I remember it from the previous location, with their signature items such as the bacon wrapped dates. We tried a handful of plates and with each tapas order, we were impressed. I can't even really repeat back to you everything we had but there were plenty of delicious and savory options. We tried so many and didn't feel like we broke the bank in the end. We opted for two desserts, one that was the flourless cake and both desserts sent us straight into a food coma as desired/expected.

We visited on a Saturday night and the one thing that was a little annoying was how loud the music was. There was a nice mix of songs - some Spanish, some radio hits, some rock - but it was all very, very loud. At one point in the beginning of the meal, we considered asking to move to the patio because it was just so so loud inside (seated at the bar). Since it's a very open layout, maybe that wouldn't have even helped.

Luckily, sound did not disrupt our dining experience!"}
{"text":"Love this place, it was a lucky find when on a work trip and I now go everytime I am in town (at least once). This Tapas joint is in a strip-mall off the strip. Likely about a $12 cab ride from where ever you are on the strip and maybe $6 from the Hard Rock.

The service has been good to great every time I have been there. This includes mostly lunch but also a few dinner services.

The food is inventive and delicious. Some of my favorites are the Artichoke Toast, filet mignon sliders, bacon wrapped dates. Everything is pretty dang good - strangely enough two Tapas classics (Tortilla espanola and the patatas bravas) leave a little to be desired (note if the managers read this I would suggest cutting the patatas a little smaller for the bravas and cooking a little longer so not so \"potatoe-y\").

The sangria is good, they have a nice happy hour, the deserts are solid, prices are fair, and the menu is very diverse and vegetarian friendly. This would be great for a business lunch, romantic/fun dinner, and a big group out."}
{"text":"We went at 5:30 and took advantage of the remaining 30 minutes in the happy hour which was totally worth it. Pitcher of sangria (red) regularly $33 for $18 - very tasty and strong. Solid and large selection of tapas. We ordered the Gazpacho, Pulpo asado, Camarones Ajillo, Huevos estrellados, Veggies and lentils. From the happy hour menu we had bacon wrapped dates, veggie, cx and pork empanadas. Personal favorites are the pulpo and empanadas. It's off strip, which was nice break from the hustle and bustle."}
{"text":"Firefly has become my favorite Spanish tapas restaurant in Vegas! I love love the tapas on their menu. My absolute favorite would have to be the baked goat cheese, unbelievably melts in your mouth. The ambience is dope on the weekends with Spanish music/dancing and all the beautiful Spanish women. Great place to come for some Spanish food and drinks! Glad I found this gem."}
{"text":"I usually don't post anything about restaurants I've been to, but in this case I had to. The food was delicious and Mario was a wonderful server. We've never been here before and weren't sure of what to order. He suggested some of his favorites, we tried them and we're glad we did. Next time we're in town, we'll come back here for sure!"}
{"text":"Right on! Knowing that Firefly Tapas reopened was fantastic news to me. I used to frequent their location on Eastern at the base of Anthem over the past years and when they closed, the dark clouds covered my blue Firefly sky. I have not had the opportunity to check out the Paradise location but when I was given the opportunity to on Friday night with other Yelp Elite friends, I jumped on it. 

The vibe is pretty busy, sexy and swanky. The amount of people who were there was like visiting a popular New York restaurant on a Friday night. It was wall to wall humans but due to the size of the location it was better than said NY location. Although we had reservations, we waited at the bar for our table. It wasn't bad because I got to catch up with friends and drink a Ginger Smash. Excellent pre-cocktail by the way.

We ordered tapas. Lots of Tapas. Shared those lots of ordered Tapas. One thing I have always liked about the Tapas experience is that you can just try a bit of everything. Can one get full from trying a bit of everything, of course one can! I have always enjoyed their bacon wrapped dates. When they first closed I was sad, so sad because I have not found Bacon Wrapped Dates that even nail Fireflys. The added smoked almond does it for me. Most places don't add the almond so it just mushes. The ham and cheese Croquetas, stuffed peppers and beet salad are also a fabulous choice. I recommend those for tapas  ordered. You really can't go wrong with anything on their menu, so fun to explore Spanish style tapas here. 

I hope to come back down soon, there are a lot of tapas that I want to try or revisit!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to go for drinks and appetizers. On Fridays the paradise location has salsa nights. It's a plus to get to see people dancing and having a good time. Love the stuffed dates, apple salad, empanadas and beef sliders. You have to try their sangria, they offer a white and red sangria. They have different flavored mojitos which taste amazing."}
{"text":"An outstanding view overlooking the Fremont Street Experience.  I never would have expected the Chicken Salad Tapas to be the very best Chicken Salad I've ever had. For Dessert the Banana-Nutella sandwiches.  

Highly recommended. 

But be warned, the \"Keep ordering\" nature of Tapas will drain your wallet dry and fast."}
{"text":"Love this place,I go every time I visit Vegas. Did brunch yesterday for the first time and everything was great!! The best sangria I've had."}
{"text":"5 stars! Yes! Why? Everything was on point! Food beer, service and price. I had four dishes.... Dates, chorizo clams, pulpo (octopus) asado, and albondigas (meatballs)! All were exceptional! And I am from LA so I know good food. A serious must try . Or I should say don't come at all so I can have the place all to myself! I have never been to an establishment when I didn't have any negative criticism. Karen and Omar at the bar were amazing! I'm coming back tomorrow. Shhhh but don't tell anyone!"}
{"text":"This was a great place for a group dining experience.  We had a party of 10 people and we were promptly seated and the food came out very quickly.  We had the sangria and mojitos, which were delicious.  The food was good but I should have gotten more veggies.  It was very reasonably priced, too."}
{"text":"This place was seriously amazing. One of my new favorite restaurants in Vegas. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"4 1/2 Stars

Came here on a Friday night with 2 other people and wait was about a good 20-30 minutes.  We hung out at the bar.  They have refreshing mojitos.

The dishes themselves are fairly inexpensive, but they quickly add up.  It was a bit crowded but overall good service and even better food.

I was weary about the food/restaurant since I hadn't had tapas before but was quickly impressed.  

Must Try:
-Mussels
-Meatballs
-Mac and Cheese
-Croquettes
-Ribs"}
{"text":"WOA!! Super close to strip. AMAZING food. Good prices. Locals like."}
{"text":"I went there the other day.  The food was good, the Sangria was average.

If there would be a negative, it would be a misleading menu.  I ordered the Filet Mignon Sliders, that (according to the menu) come with cheese (I forgot what kind,) and caramelized onions.  What I got was ground Filet (at least I hope it was,) a crumbly white cheese, some kind of orange sauce on it, and the onions were some fried thinly sliced onions on top of the sliders all over the plate... sort of like having onion rings on a burger... not really caramelized onions.

Other than that, we had the Tuna Tartare, which was excellent.  Also, the Lamb sausage, which was good as well.

I was going to give it 3 stars, as it didn't really blow me away.  But, the quality of the food, and the cheap prices made me raise it to 4.  I would go back."}
{"text":"We were looking for a decent place to dine at midnight. It's Vegas, so I figured there had to be something open. They served tapas until 2am and had excellent reviews, so I initially thought it was perfect! However, I came across multiple articles on how this restaurant just couldn't get it together with health inspections and multiple cases of food poisoning. I was skeptical, but I still decided to take the risk! 
We ordered the firefly fries - good for a big group to share, but not worth getting for 2 with all the other options. The Tierra y mar skewers with salsa verde was \"ok\" - I wouldn't order it again. It just wasn't special and I've had better. The manchego mac n cheese gave me a mini heart attack with every bite, but those basked pasta shells were delish! The chicken tinga empanada was excellent, but it left me wanting more of it! The camarones a la Diabla had a real sweet and spicy kick to it. It tasted like it had quite a bit of siracha. It was tasty, but not my favorite. 
The last item was the bacon wrapped dates. I do not like dates, but these bites were little pieces of heaven. Sweet and salty, with an almond crunch in the middle. I still couldn't believe how good it was. I don't like dates, but I liked these! It comes with 5 per order, so perfect for 2-3 people. 
The evening was topped with the trio of gelato - vanilla and chocolate were good, but not as good as the pistachio flavor! Love love love! We also ordered the chocolate tres leches cake to go. Our server said it was a must have, so I wasn't leaving without it. Hopefully, it's still good tomorrow! 
I gave this review 4 stars because of a couple things, the hostess wasn't very friendly (our server was good though) and there were so many options on the menu. They should really cut it down and focus on the items that are really good. Not everything we ordered was that good, I will only rate a restaurant give 5 stars when ALL the food is excellent. 

I might go back next time I'm in town, in depends how good this chocolate tres leches cake is."}
{"text":"Got the Mac and cheese which was delicious and filling. This place has small appetizers and off the strip in Vegas. Don't get the chorizo mushrooms too tiny. Overall good outdoor patio and vibe"}
{"text":"This is my \"go to spot\" off the strip each time I visit Vegas. It's rare to find a gem on the strip so why not look outside the strip. This place is marvelous. Their old location was about 500 ft away and that's where it was love at first bites. Tapas style makes it easy to have a variety of flavors and share amongst family and/or friends. There are many choices to choose from that consist of seafood, beef, veggies, and much more. Some of my favorites are the ceviche, stuffed mushrooms, tuna tartare, tomato basil soup, tierra y mar skewers, baby back ribs with mango sauce, the pork chops are a must, and the empanadas with roasted pork are yummy. Whatever fulfills your pleasure, I'm sure you'll find it here with the endless choices. The table set up is the perfect setting that gives you plenty of room to work on multiple plates at once. The atmosphere has a romantic setting for date night during the week. But the beat picks up Thursday through Sunday and the place gets a little loud, but that's what makes this place a great experience. The staff is great, the vibe is trendy, and music sets the tone for a wonderful evening. If you want to avoid the larger crowds, I suggest to visit during day and the food will be just as delicious as it is at night. Also, if you're staying anywhere on the strip, you're a short $8 taxi away from most hotels on the strip. Oh yeah, the drinks are amazing too and you must try the red sangria. I better stop here and leave a few things for you to discover yourself here at Firefly."}
{"text":"Came here as a group of 4 on a saturday afternoon after finding this place on yelp and looking at the menu.  I must admit that it is one of the cheaper tapas restaurant that I've heard of.

Pros: Service was good with waitresses and waters constantly checking on us. 

Many different tapas to choose from including some unique ones that I had never heard of
 
Cons: Flavor of tapas is nothing special.  I feel like other tapas places may have smaller portions but at least they are more flavorful and authentic...

We ordered the paella which was absolutely TERRIBLE!  no hint of saffron, really mushy rice...I felt bad because my friends have never had paella before.  I suppose its good to set the bar low

Sangria isnt worth it...there was too much ICE despite the fact that I asked for light ice and the waiter responded \"of course\" Its $7 a glass and $28 a  pitcher...if a pitcher comes out to ~4 glasses full of ice...why not just order 4 glasses. If you're contemplating ordering the pitcher because its a better deal...don't bother.  its not.

The waiter also forgot to put in our beef skewer order which resulted in another 10 minute wait after all the food was cleared off the table...."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best Tapas restaurants I've been to, and the prices are really reasonable!!  I have loved everything I've had there (and I've had just about everything since I'm in Vegas 5 or 6 times a year at least).  My faves include the stuffed dates (sounds gross, but super tastey- hey, everything is better with bacon!), the duck (love duck!), empanadas (warning, they recently started skimping on them- you only get one cut in half now instead of two per order), and the patatas bravas.  There is a salad I always get too, but I don't remember which one without seeing the menu.  Everything I've had there was excellent, including the brioches and serrano ham!
You can't go wrong here!  And if you like sweet drinks, they do serve a white sangria here, which is unique but very sugary.  

The service varies from night to nite, but it's never been terrible, but on some nites it hasn't been so great.  I think they get overwhelmed at times at the number of people there.   The atmosphere is great, and I think they get a fair amount of locals there so it's not too Vegas-y.

I think this is a necessity of any Vegas trip."}
{"text":"These are not spanish tapas, but tapas style cuisine. It is meant to be shared with the table. It is a good way to be able to sample and try a lot of different foods and flavors. They got dishes influenced from a lot of different cuisines. Some dishes we had were: sliders, calamari, bacon wrapped dates, steamed mussels, lamb skewers, and chorizo stuffed mushrooms. 

They have a nice variety and you can probably find a few that would interest you. Everything we had was good, but a bit heavy though. It could be just what we ordered. Sangria was good. Good meal and I would definately come back...if I have a car in Vegas."}
{"text":"So far I've found three places in the country all named firefly. All unique and amazing. This lives up to the name. Craft cocktails. Awesome apps and small plates. Well crafted menu that changes seasonally. Worth a stop. For sure."}
{"text":"Dates and bacon, pretty good. Cute venue, dark ambience. Pretty busy when we went. All the tapas were decent."}
{"text":"This is seriously the BEST TAPAS EVER!!! Definite must! Everything they brought out was better than the last. The fries, tomato basil soup with grilled Brie cheese sandwich, the Mac and cheese, the scallops, the ribs. AMAZING!!!"}
{"text":"I love firefly. I'm always surprised when I hear people say that they do not like it. The sangria is so good, you have to order a pitcher of it! I love the stuffed dates, lamb skewers, and firefly fries! The prices are extremely reasonable and the atmosphere is fun. The one in the plaza was my favorite, I loved the view, but this location does the trick."}
{"text":"This place has been my favorite place since they were in the smaller building just right next door. I am glad that they have moved to a bigger restaurant.
Being that this is me and my now husband favorite place to eat, we love the atmosphere, but of course the food and the RED SANGRIA. 
Being said, we just had our wedding reception there in the patio area. The outside is very nice, the hanging light bulbs, the red and black walls, everything about it made my reception amazing. Ana, Alejandra and their staff was amazing. 
Instead of ordering per person, we ordered from the tray menus. We ordered about 5 trays for each 15 different tapas. My guests loved the food and they got really full and the food were still coming. LOL. But they were able to take to-go, which is good, so food doesn't go to waste. Plu, our 4 year old son has severe food allergies to all 8 allergens, they were able to accommodate that and my son loved his baked chicken. 
I also was able to do my own kind of decorations, i was also able to hire a DJ, a photographer and a photobooth without going through there vendors. I had a Sweethearts table, a guest sign in and Cake and Sweet Bar. By sketching out how the tables are going to be set up, i was afraid it was going to be tight, but it wasn't...i was able to have a decent size dance floor and still had space to walk around. 
I didn't want a big normal wedding reception, I wanted something different, and I am glad I chose this place. For anyone who is trying to do an event, nothing big or extravagant, I recommend inquiring with Fireflys."}
{"text":"Love this place! This is the 2nd time coming here on my trips to Vegas. Delicious tapas. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I was there tonight and i really enjoy the food and the service was amazing ....and really fast .....I really recommend this place....,. it's my favor place !!! And the manager was very nice and polite !!!!"}
{"text":"Went to the Firefly restaurant based upon their menu. The food was really good, good service from Jesus and the people sitting next to us offered us tastes of their food since this was our first Tim at the restaurant. The only issue was the sound level in the restaurant, it was packed (with good reason) and as a result noisy. The Padilla was very good, the sausage plate and the Serrano Jason plates reminded me of Spain. Mainly locals in the restaurant, great food, reasonable prices and good sangria (we had red). If you are in Las Vegas and like tapas' go to Firefly. I would give 5 for food and 3 for ambiance, so a 4."}
{"text":"Friend and I ate here while visiting from out of state. Just looking for different places that had offered lunch services. After reading the reviews on here we took the chance and glad that we did. The service was great. It was fast. Our waiter Mario had taken our order not long after we sat down and it was great that he kept checking to see if we were okay or needed anything else even after service was picking up. He was great enough to let my friend and I know that if we were to come back for dinner same night to come in early, make reservations to avoid wait time as to they do get busy. I would highly recommend this place if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Thanks to Rachael Ray, we decided to check out Firefly on our week long trip to Vegas, and well... She didn't lie about the amazingness of this place.

We have been trying and trying to find a place in our area that lives up to the food we had at Firefly, but I honestly don't think we're going to be able to do it.

The place was packed when we got there (I think it was a Friday night), but once we started eating, we understood why.  Drinks were excellent, and the food was unbelievable.  We ended up ordering twice, because some of the things we got were so delicious. Service was great.  Our waiter was great at explaining the way the menu and ordering worked, since it was our first real tapas experience.

I honestly want to fly to Vegas for a day, just so we can eat here again. :)"}
{"text":"This was my first time back to Firefly since the relocation. I know it was a hot spot at the other building, but I really hated going there because it was so cramped. And parking was a pain in the butt.

I'm very impressed with the new building, it's spacious and very nicely decorated. 

  I heard some things about the previous location being closed because it was unclean, but I felt really confident eating here, everything was 'sparkling clean'. The waitstaff was pleasant, and very quick on service. And for me (as it always was) the food was just amazing.
  We got a pitcher of the blood orange mojito as suggested from friends, but It was to strong for my taste and over priced. We will stick to the good stuff in the future (Big firefly sangria fans here) 
  Our favorite  things to order from here are the Bacon wrapped dates (YUM), The mac n' cheese, the sliders, and the stuffed mushrooms. My bf is obsessed with the stuffed peppers also. Im not a cream cheese fan, but I take his word they're good. Also tried for the first time last night Tres Leche
  The reason for the loss of a star is although its delicious I feel its a tad over-priced. Still, doesn't keep me from coming back though ;) (just not as often)"}
{"text":"Sangria is so-so. Food is bland and not unique. Bay Area has way better places for tapas."}
{"text":"This is the 2nd time I've been here.  The 1st time was two years ago when I was on leave from Iraq.  I came during lunch and sat at the bar.  Had a great time and the bartender treated me really well.  Food was fantastic-I mean I had better tapas here than I did in Madrid, Spain.

Wanted to come back and swung on by on a Saturday night.  Real mistake on my part.  I didn't realize this was a hang-out place for the \"hip\" crowd.  OK, so I really detest the hip crowd but I didn't let this sway my opinion.

I sat down at the bar and waited a bit and the bartender gave me a menu.  At the same time I ordered a glass of their red sangria which was recommended to me the 1st time and I really liked.  The red sangria is still really good.  So I perused the menu and it looked pretty much identical.  made a couple choices and waited.  Waited a bit more.  Finally the bartender comes to me and I mention that I haven't been here in 2 years.  Just as I was going to tell him my order he turns to help one of the waiters that comes up.  OK, np the bartender supports the waiters-I got this.  So I wait some more.  The bartender either completely forgets about me or ignores me.  I wait a while now, deciding to be a nice guy and try to give him another chance.  He takes someones else's order that walked up to the bar while I'm sitting at the bar.  I wait a good while and I'm finally feed-up.  Seriously?  I flip the menu over to see the price on my glass, put out exactly $6.50 for the drink on the bar and exit.  I was flabbergasted.  It's been a while since I've gotten this kind of treatment.  And the bar is really small.  There was me, and maybe 5 other people at this bar.  I'm thinking he just decided to blow me off.  Amazing.  I would have given this place 5 stars two years ago but now...

Maybe in the future I'll revisit at lunchtime again and write an update for this place but until then, I guess I just wasn't hip enough for this place."}
{"text":"Dear Firefly: I love you. 

This is my boyfriend and I's go to place for date night. Their sangria is so good, especially the white sangria. Embarrassingly enough, my favorite part of coming to Firefly is their bread and almond butter. Delicious!!

Some of my favorite tapas here are: 

SMOKED SALMON TOASTS $7
Brioche toast, dill sour cream, pickled red onion, capers. I always ask for a side of lemon with this too.

FIREFLY FISH STICKS $6.50
Tilapia, Japanese breadcrumbs, spicy tartar sauce

BABYBACK RIBS $9.50
Mango BBQ sauce

LAMB CHOPS $8.50
Red wine reduction, sautéed lentils, julienne vegetables

PETIT FILET $10
Mini filet mignon, herb cheese, roast potato, mushrooms, red wine sauce

And my boyfriend's ultimate favorites:

STUFFED PEPPERS $7
Spanish piquillo peppers, fresh mozzarella, garlic cream cheese, tomato sauce

TIERRA Y MAR SKEWERS $10
Grilled shrimp, filet mignon, chorizo sausage, salsa verde

We have also tried the firefly fries, manchego mac 'n' cheese, ham and cheese croquetas, and crispy duck roll. All good, but not our favorites.

4 stars because the service is hit or miss. We are either completely forgotten and have to flag down our waiter, or are very well taken care of."}
{"text":"this place gets really busy, definitely make a reservation before you make the trip to vegas, cant just pop in when you find it on yelp. The quality of the dishes was pretty hit or miss, and since its vegas, everything is overpriced. great place for a big group birthday dinner or something, but it is a bit off the strip and it probably wont live up to your expectations."}
{"text":"Firefly never hesitates to impress with their menu and service! Last night I brought a group of about 40 colleagues from all over the US for a private event. Ana did an excellent job making sure that we had everything we needed prior to the event, and was very conscientious about the guests who had food allergies or dietary restrictions. Every dish was phenomenal - they have won the hearts and tummies of my colleagues! Neo was our bartender, and was so pleasant to everyone, and made some great drinks. Marcos made sure that we had what we needed, and did his best to keep up with clearing away what we finished, and that nothing was wasted. This has become one of the Vegas team's favorite places!"}
{"text":"Best Tapas bar in Las Vegas and probably the best tapas bar I've ever been to in my life.

All I can say is \"Just Do It\". Everything on this menu is good. Every dining experience I've had  at Firefly is been consistently and outstandingly great. I've been going to this place for the last 9 years. Make sure you make reservations. This place is constantly bombarded with crowds of parties coming in. 

Thank god the owner is my friend otherwise I'd be waiting for a looong time to be seated. Besides the fact the owner is my friend. 

This place is just f*cking great! Great food, great service, great music, great crowd, great sangria, But!! finding a parking spot in the plaza where the restaurant  is located sucks big thumbs down. haha 
Cheers to firefly for their food!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went here on a Sunday Afternoon. It was actually less crowded then I had expected but we made a reservation in case. The goat cheese was delicious as was the Filet mignon and the Chicken Empanadas. The stuffed mushrooms were not the greatest becuase they were a little dry, but overall the food was great!

The blood Orange mojito was a little sour to my taste so I added some club soda which made it better! Overall decent lunch place"}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place for a while now. 

Deducted 1 star because it took a while for the hostess to realize their was people waiting by the stand and it was confusing. Most of the night people would just walk in think ing they could just sit anywhere or were actually looking for the hostess. 

4 stars for the food and ambience. Very trendy, but somewhat casual atmosphere. This is definitely a \"Date Night\" Restaurant. Gets loud with large groups, so you may need to speak up with whoever you're with. The service was awesome! Our waiter was kind, he broke down ingredients and flavors in a lot of the dishes and helped determine some of the tapas we may enjoy. I ordered the Sparkling Red Sangria, very good. They have a lot of space for large and small groups. I noted one booth had a curtain with it, so even if you wanted to have a more intimate dinner you definitely could.

Favorite Tapas include Camarones Al Ajillo, Firefly Fish Sticks, and the Baby Back Ribs

You can easily do quite some damage at this restaurant and you're bill will reflect that. Walking away, I paid close to $75 on the bill for 2 people. So you can only imagine what you can do with more food and drinks.

All in all a good experience, and would like to return."}
{"text":"This is a 4-4.5 star eatery that gets extra credit for extremely good service. GREAT meals, solid service and surprisingly fast turn-around make this a location that I and my news crew always visit whenever we have a Las Vegas event. We've been there through both locations and the resultant visits have only gotten better with time. An outstanding restaurant. We will be back -- again and again."}
{"text":"Alright, since it doesn't seem to be passè yet, I'm going to qualify my review by saying I spent two weeks in Spain, and the tapas here would be gobbled up just as quickly there.

Also, be prepared for a wait if you eat here.  They do take reservations, but even then, due to the nature of tapas, you might end up waiting a bit for your table.

For starters, the red sangria is delicious.  Hands down the best sangria I can remember, and deceptively strong.  The first time I had it, I underestimated it, and got close to embarrassingly tipsy in front of co-workers.

Almost all of the food is done perfectly, too.  The favorite of myself and my co-workers is definitely the boquerones - little bites of heaven.  I'm not exaggerating when I say we almost order a plate for each person at the table.  The tastiest slivers of sardine with roasted peppers and avocado - amazing.

The pulpo asada is hit or miss, but when it hits, it is probably some of the best octopus I've had state side.  The salmon tartare is really, really good, too.

Stuffed dates are rich, but very, very good.  Patatas bravas are spicy and crisp, and wouldn't be out of place in Barcelona.  This place cooks a mean steak, too.

Everything else on the menu (yeah, I've tried just about everything) is good.  The only disappointment I've had is with the shrimp - not that it was bad, per se, just not up to the standard set by the other seafood dishes."}
{"text":"Favorite restaurant in a week of great restaurants while visiting Las Vegas for a conference earlier this month! Plan to wait... but the staff is really accommodating and will call you on the phone/ hold your table for a few minutes if you aren't front and center when your name is called. I recommend visiting Kelly's down the way and getting a drink while you wait. So on to other stuff...

This place is super crowded. The menu is not huge but literally everything is great so it's tough to make decisions. Our party of 6 ordered one or two things each and shared in true tapas style. Prawns were a particular hit, as were the skewers. My favorite was the ceviche, which had avocado in it (I don't even like avocado and I still loved it!). I hear the sangria is amazing and I really regret not getting it. I did however order a few desserts to share, and all were  well received. We tried the bread pudding and the dessert platter (cheesecake, tarts, tres leches). The bread pudding was the favorite, as well as the cheesecake.

Enough talk- go eat here!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I live right near it and always mean to hit it again. Finally went the other night again, and realized why it rocks! Excellent food the Tapas are amazing, none were bad. Also the bar is very cool and the service and drinks are good to go"}
{"text":"Fun place is all I have to say. This the perfect spot to meet up with friends close to the strip. 

I love the little dishes--fairly priced, and nothing tastes out of whack. 
The sangria quality has gone down a bit (actually a bit watered down) , but what the heck when you're among good friends in a lively atmosphere you can let it pass. 

Favorite dish: the bacon wrapped dates with feta cheese! 
Favorite drink: bloody orange sangria 

Great group spot! 


Latest update: Firefly's must do something about its cleanliness. I came here couple of days ago to introduce new friends to the establishment. It's old and smells putrid. Don't get me started on the ladies room and lounge chairs. I'm sure the restaurant has been getting by from its sheer popularity, but PLEASE clean up and sterilize. I think it's starting to turn off my appetite."}
{"text":"Ate here on Saturday for my sister's bachelorette. The place looks pretty swanky with these crazy red chandeliers, perfect for a bachelorette party! There was even a wedding reception going on in one of the rooms. When we arrived, we decided to split up the orders for our table of 8 into 4 and 4 so it would be easier to eat and share the plates. After ordering, the manager? came up and asked us if we wanted to order off the menu or the package menu (all you can eat/drink for $55/pp). We stuck with our order, but she still offered us a round of shots, strawberry vodka with cranberry for the girls and a blow job shot for the bride. Awesome!! Then another guy came up to the table and asked the bride if he could fill the champagne flute that she brought with her from the hotel, of course she accepted... free alcohol. He brought over a mini bottle of champagne (which unfortunately might have gone bad already) still Awesome. Overall food was great. I totally recommend the mushroom tarts and the chicken and mushroom paella was pretty good too. Overall if you are celebrating something, esp a bachelorette, this is a great place to go."}
{"text":"So I wrote a really scathing review of this place before it moved and when I walked in, I told the concierge. I basically got treated like garbage by the bartender because (I'm pretty sure) I didn't fit their hipster classy crowd. They reassured me that the place has vastly improved.

I came with Angela and Kent. We ordered about a dozen dishes here. I'm only going to mention the two that we would order again. The stuffed dates and the spicy beef salad. Everything else we had wasn't even ok. We also got seated outside and there were only two servers outside and we actually waited 5-10 minutes until we got our drinks! Seriously, have you ever waited that long for alcoholic drinks in Vegas? Yeah, it's like we walked into some pocket dimension not in Vegas. Our food also took a long time gettin' to. Even the bread and butter they give you, I had to ask for twice before we got them and they took their time also. What really made no sense was that we got our dessert before we even were served all our main courses! WTH? That's a first, never happened to me. 

I will say that the sangria is pretty awesome here and the pear-ginger martini was pretty outstanding. Only reason why I'd ever come back, the drinks. But then again Angela made a good point that you can find better in Vegas if you looked hard enough. Yeah, probably so it's a question of whether I would go out of my way to come here just for the drinks. Nope.

So I'm really, finally done with this place. I was done before they moved and now I'm done again with this place."}
{"text":"Ahh! One of my favorite places EVER.

Every time we come here I get Sangria.  They have red, white, and sparkling.  They are all delicious, but I think sparkling is my favorite.  **Half off pitchers of sangria during happy hour!

They bring you complimentary bread with almond butter.  AMAZING!! Seriously. I would order this stuff if it wasn't given.  We always ask for another order.

My top 3 tapas are the firefly fishsticks, the ham & cheese croquetas, and the salmon toast.  I was really excited for the parmesan fries, but they aren't very good.  I have tried them twice and both times they were soggy and bland.  I also really like the babyback ribs (with mango BBQ sauce), the lamb chops, the petit filet mignon, and the fruit & cheese platter.

My boyfriend loves that they have Pacifico here.  He loves the stuffed peppers, bacon wrapped dates, and the tierra y mar skewers.

I like that this place is tapas style that way we can get a wide assortment of food.  I'd suggest getting at least 3 dishes per person as they are pretty small.

We have tried a couple desserts here but weren't very fond of them.  Last time we tried the flan.  We have had the banana nutella sandwiches twice and both times they were made differently.  The first time they were delicious.  They were fritters stuffed with bananas and strawberrys in them and nutella on top.  Last time we went they were literally nutella sandwiches, which we can make at home.  I don't know why they were different.. Maybe because the fritter styled ones were at the Sahara location?  But no more desserts for us, we'll just stick to the tapas.

Service is usually pretty good.  The food comes out as it is prepared.  We will continue being repeat customers."}
{"text":"Bacon wrapped around your dates!?......end of review.
Came here with a group of friends to celebrate a birthday, the choice was perfect, elegant, clean, affordable and with a menu so intensive anyone would surely find something to their liking. I had the fried calamari, pardon peppers, the dates wrapped in bacon and the paella which was very delicious and loaded with seafood. The peppers were medium to mild but you may end up with a very spicy one, but as Forrest Gumpzalez once said \"life is a plate of peppers, you never know which one is going to burn you\". I asked the waiter if they could fry the calamari in tempura mix instead of their regular mix and they did which means that everything is made to order and not frozen ready like other places do.
 I also ordered the sangria and a mojito and they both were perfectly done, a harmonious mixture of fruits and wine made this sangria one of the best I tasted. 
  Service was great..at the beginning and then it slowly became nonexistent, but to be fair I think we might have overstayed our welcome. I blame it on the sangria. 
Tip was included on the bill as any establishment would do for parties of 8 or more but we added some more to cover lingering fees.
Great times and great food will surely keep me coming for more and if you keep on making good drinks as good as your dates wrapped in bacon, you'll definitely have me wrapped around your sangria for sure."}
{"text":"We were walking around Fremont Street for the first time and ran across this place. The food was amazing and the view of Fremont Street has to be the best there is. Our group of four ordered about 6 different tapas dishes and the sangria. Absolutely all of it was great. 

Fun atmosphere, amazing views, great food, helpful/friendly staff and good prices. What more could you want from a night out?"}
{"text":"This restaurant was amazing. First of all we completely forgot what tapas was for a second and ordered too much food. However, it did not matter. Everything was cooked to perfection. My favorite was the garlic shrimp, steak and mushroom skewers, and lamb chops. We also had vegetables, a salad with green beans, tuna tar tar, fried calamari and a couple of other things. I have in to the sangria with white wine and it was delicious. I have a tapas place in Chicago that I love and this superseded my standards. The staff was really nice and friendly. Our waitress seemed a little timid but she took care of everything for us. Amazing. I will visit here every time I come to Vegas."}
{"text":"Best Sangria! And best dessert try the tres leches cake I have cravings for this plate all the time! I've been a couple times but make it an event to come here every time I'm in Vegas! It's off the strip but worth trip! ooo and that rhymes!"}
{"text":"great eats. such a great afternoon of food with friends. service was great. super fast."}
{"text":"Came here the other night for Angela H's UYE goobye party.

I wasn't all that hungry so I ordered the Tuna Tartare and the Ceviche. Both were yummy!! I shared em with Lisa L. and tried some of the dishes she ordered. I don't remember which ones they were, but they were good too.

I had some sangria and some mojitos to drink. Both were great!

The staff was all friendly and came by often to check if we needed more drinks or food.

I had an awesome time here with the Yelp-izzles and also met D from LA."}
{"text":"This was an excellent experience all around. Food was delicious and plenty of variety and plates to share. Eduardo the manager was excellent, professional, and attentive to our table the entire time. I would definitely recommend this restaurant for anyone passing through Vegas -may it be couple or family- looking for a great reasonably priced place with good food service and vibe!"}
{"text":"Just walked out of this place been sitting for 10mins and still not been greeted by a server. Then a table right next to us just got sat and instantly got greeted with a beverage order. Management really need to get on top of this."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice, both times my meals and service have been excellent. There's a ginger pear martini that you need to try! I was dining with a vegan and pleasantly surprised that there were plenty of things we could order that everyone in my party of 3 could enjoy. But the item worth raving about is the carrots. Carrots? Yes! The carrots! We ended up re-ordering more carrots during our meal because they were the star of the show, they ate more like ribs than anything else, deliciously roasted in a BBQish sauce. If you do anything here, get the carrots. I promise they'll blow your mind. Patio seating during the evening (in the spring) is lovely."}
{"text":"It's hard for me to want to go anywhere else when in Vegas because this place is so good! We love Omar at the bar too. Such great service! We had the filet and warm spinach salad and they were both so delicious. I could eat the artichoke toasts everyday too. So good! The only thing that I didn't love was the chicken skewers, but it wouldn't stop me from going back."}
{"text":"Every single plate is a hit! I cannot complain about this place. I'm originally from Los Angeles, CA and every time I come to Vegas I make sure to come to FireFly."}
{"text":"Yes, this place has had its health issues (or rather one giant Godzilla-sized ISSUE). You are either going to get over that, or not. Having worked in the industry, I can confidently say that a place that has undergone such public humiliation is not going to drop the ball again. I am sure this place is now cleaner than one of those crazy decontamination suits in Outbreak. But, unlike that movie, Firefly does not suck. This place is the bee's knees. Try getting quality tapas at such a very reasonable price elsewhere - I dares ya! This new location (about time!) is much larger and nicer than the last joint. The once overly packed patio area is now open and spacious, and the same goes for the interior. The cramped bar has been traded for a full encompassing rectangle of drinking goodness. And the food lived up to the atmosphere. The bacon wrapped dates are a stalwart, and not to be missed. My only knock is the bread. I have never cared for it - hard and flavorless (closer to a cracker than bread). Although, it could be a blessing in disguise, as skipping he bread leaves plenty of room for countless small plates. Hopefully people start coming back and filling up the patio again, as it would be tragic for Vegas to lose this local dining icon."}
{"text":"WooHoo! This place is a must when in LV!!  Food is awesome and affordable for LV. Great place to have a few drinks and enjoy some Great food with friends, Everytime we've gone to Vegas.... Firefly is definitely on the list of places to go. 

Love this place"}
{"text":"I love tapas because you can get so much variety in one meal. Our party of four ordered a bunch of different dishes...what stood out to me were the filet mignon sliders (meat was cooked to the perfect shade of pink), parmesan french fries, tuna tartare, and the mojitos! They have a bunch of different flavors, all light and refreshing. One dish to avoid is the Thai beef salad...the flavors were just off and there was too much of that pink ginger stuff that usually served on the side of sushi. Yuck!

The decor of the restaurant really sets the mood and makes you feel like you're in Espana but with a Vegas vibe to it. The walls are dark red with paintings of flamenco dancers and there's an amazing fish tank full of orange tropical-looking fish above the entry way separating the lounge area from the dining area.

Service is quick- food came out super fast, which is always a plus! There was a slight mix up with a duplicated order, but that was fixed quickly and taken off our bill."}
{"text":"They served a paella for us at 1 AM. Where else would you find that? It was exquisite. Great service, and close to the strip. We're coming back on our next visit to Vegas. Thank you guys!"}
{"text":"This is a great place for authentic spanish tapas!

I am a big fan of their Ham and cheese croquetas (which is cerrano ham with Manchego cheese), seafood paella, ceviche with shrimp, and Lamb skewers. Also, as I have said in my yelps before... I put a big emphasis  on how a restaurant closes the experience with their desserts. I am absolutely in love with their chocolate tres leches cake. It is so soft and moist. It tastes almost as if the cake had been soaked in the milk for an hour. Also, their sangrias are very refreshing, and not too strong if you need to drive home. 

I like the upbeat atmosphere, but their latin night can get a little too loud.  Skip on the Latin night if you plan on having a date night here. Gets a bit smokey as well, since they allow smoking inside. Seating can be tight, since it is a fairly small venue. And parking can be a bit crazy on the weekends, especially since they share the parking lots with Marrakesh, Ruth Chris, and Satay Grill."}
{"text":"This is a great spot. Friends of mine took me here while I was in town visiting, and I was impressed with the ambiance and large menu.

I ordered the sparkling white wine sangria, and it was so delicious! My favorites that we ordered were the apple & manchego salad, bacon wrapped dates and ahi tuna tar tar. 

Can't wait to come back to this spot every time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place out after checking out the menu. The decor is quirky and artsy, and I saw rave reviews about some of the dishes and the sangria. I was with a large group for work, so we literally ordered the whole menu. Here's my takeaway. 

Hot: Tuna tartare, artichoke toasts
Mild: Shrimp tempura, camarones al ajillo
Cold: Ahi tuna skewers (not great flavor)

My favorite parts of the meal were the sangria and the dessert. Not that alcohol and dessert being the favorite part of a meal would be surprising, but that was definitely the high point of the day. The cheesecake and the flan was great from the dessert platter, and the banana nutella sandwiches were delightful.

Based on the prices, small quantities of food, and bland flavor, I probably wouldn't put this high on my Vegas to-do list. There were definitely a few plusses for me, but overall it was a bigger miss."}
{"text":"TAPAS! I used to go to Vegas every year for New Year's, and we would inevitably end up here. Why? Because it's gooooooooood!!

I'll be honest, it's been a few years and my memory is hazy on all the details and what is good and not good, but I do recall with perfect clarity how much I loved the croquettes here.  Every where I eat now and see croquettes on the menu, I order them in hopes that they will match the sublime satisfaction I always encounter with Firefly's, but alas, I have yet to find ones that match.  

The staff is also always accommodating  to our ridiculous needs to have a large 20+ party (ha, I guess they know we'll spend lots of monies on the booze). Firefly's is great for food and for large groups to convene.  You can never go wrong with a group of friends and several pitchers of delicious sangria... or can you??"}
{"text":"Tried this place on a friends suggestion, and I was hooked. Love the ambiance, and the food is amazing. The wait staff at this location are usually fairly attentive, genuine,  quick, and also they make good eye candy. Some of my personal favorites:

Shrimp ceviche- the ONLY place I will eat ceviche. Very acidic and refreshing

Stuffed Dates- I didn't think I was going to enjoy it, but it was a semi foodgasm. Warning, there are smoked almonds in this dish

Firefly fries- I know, its fries but they are amazing fries, complete with a killer aioli, and covered in parmesan

Ham and cheese croquetas- creamy, slightly smoky, salty. Only complaint is the size, but it is a tapas joint

Filet mignon sliders- talk about heaven. Order it medium rare for max juiciness. Comes topped with serrano ham, cabrales cheese (a cheese from the north of Spain, similar to gorgonzola I think), and caramalized onions.

Albondigas- Spanish style meatballs in a sherry tomato sauce. Meatballs are nice, unctuous, succulent, a perfect mouthful when paired with that sauce

 Caramel flan- Now I'm puerto rican, lived with puerto ricans and mexicans that made authentic flan, and this flan was sinful. perfect amount of sweet, the custard was really eggy with that beautiful caramelized taste.

Desserts in general- Order the desert platter and get the trio of gelato on the side. The desert platter comes with the flan, a lemon and berry tart, choclate tres leche, passion fruit cheesecake. Surprisingly so, the tres leche was the consensual least favorite.

Items that were not so great:

Crispy Duck roll- Disappointing, because I love duck. But the duck was lost in the cherry hoisin sauce. It was cloyingly sweet.

Empanada- Hopefully my table just got a bad batch, because the pork inside the pastry was overcooked and dry.

That's pretty much it. Oh, the red wine Sangria, delicious. Order a whole pitcher, probably the best sangria I've ever had"}
{"text":"I went here before a night out on the strip to celebrate my birthday and was absolutely impressed.

the food was delicious, and we were able to get so much food, and their wonderful sangria, for an incredible price.

this was my first tapas experience and I am hooked.  I still get cravings for their delicious truffle fries!!"}
{"text":"Horrible wait for a big party, was told 45 mins ended up being over an hour. But it was most defiantly worth the wait, food was absolutely delicious. Fiance and i had shrimp a la diabla, veggie empanadas, chicken skewers and a shrimp cocktail for less than $40. Can not wait to visit again for sure a must stop in Vegas"}
{"text":"A must stop for us every time we are in Las Vegas!!

5/5 Customer Service
Always welcoming, always ensuring our cups are filled with water. 

5/5 Food
I can't say enough about the delicious food! Prices and quality are always great. Our go to's are always;

Ceviche ; super limey just how I like it. Big chunks of avocado and shrimp. Just delicious.

Shrimp A La Diabla; sweet and spicy and just the best. The sauce is thick but not overwhelming. We usually get two of these dishes as my husband and I don't want to share! 

Tierra y Mar: Yum yum! Chorizo, shrimp and filet mignon skewer with a salsa verde drizzled on top. Another must have a must order 2! 

Bacon wrapped dates: I don't need to say anymore. Get them. 

We had our toddler with us this time so we explored beyond our usual 4. 

Mac & Cheese: This was a large portion and just so so good. I know you can't really get too crazy with Mac & Cheese but it just tasted different, ans super cheesy. Our toddler loved it.

Albondigas: He really enjoyed these too! The spices where perfect and not too overwhelming for a toddler. 

See you next time Firefly!"}
{"text":"A lot of fun... Good vibe.  Always a little crowded ... Staff has a lot of energy.  Get off the strip and enjoy firefly."}
{"text":"Delicious vegetarian experience! So glad we finally tried Firefly! I had scoped out their menu quite a few years ago and don't recall as many vegetarian options as there are now!

Every bite and sip was flavorful! We started with sparkling sangria and infused vodka martini. Perfect drinks! We had the veggie empanada, grilled cheese w tomato soup, lentils w veggies, manchego mac n cheese, and baked goat cheese! All flavorful! What I love about tapas is there's always room for dessert. Don't miss the chocolate tres leches cake, yum yum and more yum!

Our server was patient and caring. The runners and bussers all efficient and friendly. We've already added it to the list of places to return to next time in Vegas."}
{"text":"A great \"off strip\" choice for dinner.  There are plenty of choices on the menu and I couldn't believe how inexpensive the food was.  The tapas were hit or miss.  Ones to avoid:  crispy duck rolls (they weren't crispy);  spicy beef salad (I swear it was cube steak--ick); Ones to order:  machego mac n cheese; stuffed peppers; tortilla with chile vinaigrette;   We ordered a pitcher of mojitos and we were both still standing after dinner.  Translation:  I don't think there was a lick of booze in them.  I loved the fact they piped in songs by the Thievery Corporation on the patio.  Nice touch."}
{"text":"Great location, close to the Encore. Great outside seating area, super friendly and accommodating staff. Tapas were good with a great array of choices. Wine selection was limited although vast. I wasn't familiar with a lot of the options and the staff could not describe the wines. Still a keeper!"}
{"text":"Best tapas restaurant in las vegas.  I can't get enough of Firefly and you can't go wrong with anything on their menu.  If you want to impress your gf, wife, date, etc., take her here next time you're in Vegas.  It's just a few blocks from the strip but worth the drive.  It can get pretty crowded during dinner time, so you might need a reservation if you're not prepared to wait.  I highly recommend their bacon wrapped dates, even though the portion size on this particular dish is pretty small."}
{"text":"This restaurant was suggested by one of our masseuses at the Bellagio.
It is a very popular restaurant as evidenced by the folks who were waiting when we arrived.  The weather was a little cool and rainy this particular evening.  They have an adjunct semi-open patio that was open, but a little cold for some.  My wife and i opted for the patio and  were seated immediately.  It was comfortable enough under a patio heater.  Nothing like a Ketel One on the rocks to help ward off the cold. Tip:  Instead of ordering a martini, just order on the rocks.  They charge .50 extra , but they bring the drink in a large cocktail glass.  

The tapas menu was extensive and we sampled many dishes: shrimp, filet and chorizo skewers, stuffed dates with bacon,  warm spinach salad, baked tetilla ( tomato and cheese fondue) were some of them.  I did sample their sangria and it was fruity, but not overbearingly sweet.

If you're looking for a casual restaurant off the Strip with great tapas, then Firefly should fill the bill.  The prices are very reasonable and a nice  respite from all the glitz on the boulevard."}
{"text":"No words to explain this restaurant. food, environment, and staff are great. we had the Pulpo Asado, ham and cheese croquettes, shrimp a la diabla and tomato and basil soup and a many many cups of water due to a wild night in Las Vegas.."}
{"text":"Right off the strip, this place is a great place to get a meal away from the over priced, commercialized eateries on the blvd. They have a great selection of tapas, a full bar, and plenty of seating for large parties.

I tried: bacon wrapped dates.  AMAZING
calamari-pretty good, but the dipping sauce could of been better.
Ahi tuna tartar- with bits of avocado. 
Sliders- tasty!
Machego Mac n cheese- probably the best thing I had there.
Spicy beef salad-I wish they used other greens beside the iceberg lettuce, and the beef could of been more tender.
Sangria- good, get the pitcher!"}
{"text":"We stopped at Firefly on our way out of town.  We always recommend getting off the strip and this is definitely a place to do it!  They must be doing something right b/c the place was packed by the time we left, and on a Tues afternoon, too.  

It has a very charming decor.  It's very welcoming as soon as you walk in.  

The dishes we had were the bacon wrapped dates (of course), shrimp ceviche, tuna tartare and the lamp chops.  Everything was very good but the lamb chops probably beat everything else out (followed by the dates).  My wife had a sangria she enjoyed.

Service was attentive and helpful.  I thought the prices were very reasonable!

Just a really nice special place if you want to get off the strip!"}
{"text":"Came here while on a recent trip after hearing some rave reviews from friends. It was everything I hoped it would be!! My wife and I tried a few of their fresh fruit mojitos at the recommendation of the server and they were very tasty! All of the food we had was absolutely delicious!!!! My only problem was it that we had neither the time or the appetite to try everything. I will definitely be returning here!"}
{"text":"Awesome  Service and amazing food, in in town for a conference and wish they could bring it to the Bay Area."}
{"text":"Great food ,good service but the noice level was so bad we could not have a proper conversation. Will I go back don't think so ."}
{"text":"Please expand to the Phoenix area. Our tapas and sangria options are laughable. If I had my way, I would go on a red sangria and stuffed date diet."}
{"text":"Time and Time again!! This place is always outstanding ! I've been coming here since they opened their original location and I have never been disappointed. Tonight was no different . Brought 4 friends ( one with a corn allergy ) who have never been here . They loved it all as much as me . Special thank you to Neo our waiter and Jaime our chef who were amazing. Paid such great attention to us and her allergy . Can't wait til next week , cause I'll be back for more as usual .: 
Gracias !!!!"}
{"text":"Whoaaaaa this place surprised me forsure! Came here for lunch with a couple friends for the first time and ordered some of the popular items. 

Bacon-wrapped dates: I was terrified to try this.. Because dates... But they were delicious ! Perfect balance of sweet and salty. 

Chorizo and clams: much bigger portion that I expected. Essentially an entire meal on its own! The sauce is amazing and they give you a healthy serving of clams! 

Mac n cheese: what can go wrong? one of my favorites! 

Lamb skewers: totally shocked me and definitely my favorite dish. Again, portions were great and this can also stand as a meal on its own. The lamb was not gamey at all and cooked perfectly! Also lentils were flavorful and filling. 

Tuna tartare: comes with taro chips that compliment the raw tuna very well! I wish there was a little citrus but it was still really good.

This is one of the few restaurants I've been to where everything I tried was amazing. I can't wait to come back here !"}
{"text":"Great place for dates!  Smooth atmosphere, reasonably priced, and the food is great.  Firefly is the only place I go for Tapas in Vegas."}
{"text":"All the positive...

Unless you're in Espana, great tapas are hard to come by--BUT not at Firefly! 

This is a go-to spot in Las Vegas, especially since it is located a little away from the chaotic strip (and there is parking). I visited Firefly both times I was in Vegas since my cousin who is a local introduced it to me. My go-to's are the tuna tartare w/ taro chips, bacon wrapped dates, and ham and cheese croquetas. The gelato was nothing great but I would recommend the flourless chocolate cake for dessert! The portions are small and don't leave you feeling gross after eating--which you don't want to feel like when you're in Vegas heat and going to be walking around all day/night. You just get a good taste of everything. 

Not so positive but still ok...

The chicken-skewers here are nothing spectacular, and my friend ordered the sliders which I thought were average--but I'm not a sliders fan to begin with. I'm not a fan of the sangria here but it's also partially because I've been making my own sangria. It seems like the fruit hasn't been properly soaked in liquor, more wine needs to be added, and they could def use more variety of fruit besides apples/oranges (cheapest fruit you can find -_-).  

Overall, I'm such a fan of the tapas I listed that I would come back anyways esp for a midday lunch or light dinner. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Love Firefly, great tappas and mojitos.  Cant go wrong,"}
{"text":"*WARNING*  DO NOT EAT HERE!

First: I ended up bed ridden for three days with horrible, horrible food poisoning (I'll spare you the disgusting details). Totally ruined my Vegas vacation! 

Second: This is not \"Spanish Tapas\" , this is a bunch of gross canned food  pilled on top of more gross food and served in small quantities. With so many great places to eat in Vegas you need to skip this place.

My girlfriend and I decided to check this place out and were horrified at our experience. We started out with a couple little things (this was a few months ago so I don't remember exactly everything we ate) that weren't good at all but after deciding where to eat for so long that day we figured we would stay and mabey we just weren't ordering \"the right things\" . So, we ordered more... BIG mistake.  One of the dishes I remember was the mushroom puff pastry thing,which was canned mushrooms dumped on top of a previously frozen pillsbury style flaky croissant and seemingly heated via microwave...GROSS!  Everything else was just as disappointing. As for the fillet mignon mini sliders, well... thats the only thing that I ate, that she didn't and lets just say that Hell followed with them!

In closing the server was great and friendly. And after all, it's not his fault the kitchen is disgusting. But if you like food and being alive do not eat here!"}
{"text":"Great tapas for Vegas.  Loved the grilled octopus.  The menu is super hard to read and they need to work on that.  Shrimp al fuego - bomb, TONS of calamari in one order, awesome bacon wrapped stuffed dates.  Not the best sangria, thats for sure."}
{"text":"This was an late night choice after an event at the Hard Rock Hotel~ a little timid after the issues over the summer....but the worries were for not~
     GREAT HOSTESS~ friendly & personal it was a bit noisy and she did try to seat in a more quieter area.
     SUPER SERVER~ Jessica, I think. Very helpful and personable and even tho it was late she was friendly.
 We ordered the garbanzo beans, FRICKIN INCREDIABLE!!!!!! More addicting that BBQ Potato Chips for me~ just DEEELISH! Ordered the dates, husband ate those said they were quite good. These are highly recommended on Yelp! The chicken Tinga Empanadas also FAB! And the sliders all . The Machego Mac & cheese disappointing, try something else as they have numerous options.
    DEFINATLY will return, however the location on Eastern is more convenient from home for us."}
{"text":"Such a refreshing change from the over-hyped, over-glytzed and over-priced iron chef restaurants at the casinos. This is the closest to my memory of having Tapas in Spain almost a decade ago. Firefly offers about 50 diverse selections and seating are comfy sofa arrangements. Simply, Firefly is awesome. 

Came here w/ 3 colleagues and tried about a dozen dishes. 4 is the perfect size because this allowed us to try the maximum number of dishes. Let's see: 

Bacon wrapped dates - best dish of all. so much better than ones we recently tried from BOTG Truck 

Artichoke toasts - hhhmmmm, great great great 

Stuffed peppers - sweet red peppers with mozzarella and a creamy sauce - fab combo 

Empanada - crust was not as flaky but pork stuffing was great 

Steak & mushroom skewer - meat a little tough but nice flavor 

Fried calamari - not overly battered and delish dipping sauce 

Shrimp tempura - hardly any batter - not like the ones you get at J-restaurants 

Beet salad - beets could be more plentiful. Just ordinary. 

Ceviche shrimp - too liquidity and not enough shrimp"}
{"text":"Good food, drinks, and dancing? Firefly is your spot. This place is the spot to go to if you wanna dance, get your drink on and have a good meal off the strip. i would make reservations because they get packed. Service could be a little better, but overall i was happy. 

I loved my eggplant tapa--i highly suggest this. the eggplant is cooked so well, and the filling is creamy.

the patatas are a must get too, a good snack to share with a spicy kick.

the mussels are okay, tasty for sure but i feel ive had better. 

everything is reasonably priced, and theres options here for everyone--veggie and meat eaters alike!"}
{"text":"Mediocre food, super fast service, good sangria.

Unimpressed with the four dishes we had. Lamb chops were good. Polpo overcooked. Again; very fast service. Fed and full in under an hour on a Friday night."}
{"text":"I had my wedding dinner at Firefly on Saturday. 
I must say they are not the best at returning phone calls and emails and I was ready to take off a star for that but... 
They made me look so good on Saturday! Service was absolutely impeccable, thank you Ana and Neo! 
All of my guests raved about the food and even drinks. 
Lol seeing their faces when they found octopus in paella was priceless. Btw we ordered 4 course menu which started with bread and butter with olives, followed by stuffed dates ( the bomb!!!) and some kind of delicious meatball tapas. Garden salad was generously sprinkled with pine nuts, yum. 
For entrees we had were ribeye( tender and delicious), roasted chicken and paella. Tres leches cake for dessert. All served family style 
All of the above for $40 pp plus drinks, way below the banquet prices everyone else charges( by Vegas standards). 
Highly recommend for events and will come back next time I am in Vegas"}
{"text":"service good but a little slow.  Food was soso, nothing special."}
{"text":"Well we saw the good reviews on yelp so we decided to try it out. I have to say, I really enjoyed the place. We made reservations for 5:30pm on a Wednesday. I know it was early, but I like to eat an early dinner. This was a birthday also for my friend so this is where we went.
When you pull in the parking lot, there is some street work going on and the parking lot seems plain. Most of the parking is in the back. Not really impressive looking. But when you walk in the front door, it is like an oasis. Beautiful inside. VERY nice.
I had checked the menu ahead of time and about the last 50 Yelp reviews so I had written down the accumulation of the six most recommended food items. You will need about 3 items each for a man my size (6'1 225 lbs). My friend got a red wine sangria, which I tasted, it was VERY good. I'm not a wine drinker either. I'd probably get the sparkling sangria next time. I got the strawberry mojito. Good but too sweet to have with dinner. 
We got and shared the:
Bacon wrapped stuffed dates. Everybody says to get these. These and the sangria were probably the most listed items on the prior 50 Yelp reviews. I didn't see it. They were ok, but not to die for. Would I eat them again? Oh yeah. Would I order them again? No. 
The petit filet. This was the most expensive item at $12.50 and a very small piece, but very good piece of filet. It sat on a bed of tomatoes and spinach and diced potatoes that was very good. Wouldn't get it again as money can be better spent.
Chorizo and chicken stuffed mushrooms topped with melted cheese. Yummo! I would get this again. I am half Mexican though so I may like chorizo more than most.
The scallops escargot. There are NO snails in this, just made with garlic and butter. You get 6 decent size scallops cooked to perfection. I would totally get these again. Gotta try these.
Camarones a la diabla. Fantastic! The best thing we had. Decent size shrimp, cooked perfectly, in a sauce that is hot, but not too hot, and sweet also. The sauce is so good that you want to dip the bread they give you into any remaining sauce. Five shrimp came in a serving. 
Tierra y mar skewers. These are skewers that are maybe $8.50. So $4 cheaper than the petit filet. On each skewer is a chunk of filet, a shrimp, a chunk of tomato and a piece of chorizo. You get three skewers and if you combine the amount of filet on each skewer you get more on the skewers than in the petit filet. So get this instead of the petit filet and save. 
We both had the chocolate and cherry bread pudding for dessert. We could have shared one dessert but weren't sure how big it was. It was a big serving of bread pudding and a rather large scoop of vanilla ice cream on top. No bourbon sauce. But like I said, even if there are three of you, just share one as you will already be full. If it is not someone's birthday, I'd just skip the dessert.
My TIPS:
Ask for Alejandro, as he was a superb server. He was always around if you needed him, but never a bother. 
TIP 2: order all items at once as they bring them out as they get cooked. Ours were staggered and since they are small plates, the most we had at once at the table were two items out of 6. 
TIP 3: get the tierra y mar skewers instead of petit filet.
TIP 4: get the sangria. It really is that good. 
TIP 5: Make a reservation. We got there at 5:20pm on a Wednesday. Maybe 1/4 full at most. By 5:45pm it was 3/4 full and by 6pm it was completely full. On a Wednesday. It's a nice place and worth it. We were dressed fine and we were in shorts and Hawaaian shirts.
Our bill with two drinks each and 6 Tapas and two desserts was $86.75 and with tip $102. If you cut out the desserts, that would be $17 less after tax and tip. Which would bring the bill down to $85 for two. Of course if you drink water instead of the 4 alcoholic drinks, that would save a lot more, maybe $30 more when you think about the tax and tip.... but I want the two drinks. hehe."}
{"text":"I came here this past week with my coworkers while we were visiting for a trade show.
I have several friends that live in Vegas and love this place. Also checked out the yelp reviews and saw the raving reviews. After 11 hours of walking and working, I was SO EXCITED to get my tapas and sangria on. 

I WAS SO DISAPPOINTED. There were 4 of us and the waitress suggested we each order 2 dishes. 8 dishes came out and all 8 dishes were sub par. All the proteins we ordered were either over cooked or over salted. All the veggie dishes we ordered were uninspired or under seasoned. 

The saving grace was the sangria. The red sangria here was amazing. You can definitely taste the fruit coming through the wine. so yummy! Maybe if I had a couple more glasses before the food came out I would've enjoyed the tapas more. The ambiance here is also really cool and casual. 

I'd probably only come back here for drinks and bar food."}
{"text":"In town for a conference. This was a short distance from the hotel. The best tapas ever!!stuffed dates. Croquettes, empanadas. It just got better and better.

Out waiter Mario was attentive and helpful. We may have eat there again tomorrow!"}
{"text":"Man, it seems quite out if place for me to drag this restaurant like I am about to do (because they have so many positive reviews and were able to do something right to get the place re-opened)...oh, well..here is my experience..

Friends and I went this past Saturday night to celebrate a bday. The mango mojito was amazing...the drinks were all delicious and the bar staff were friendly despite being busy. We got our booth and started to order plates to share..some were better than others but I especially liked the fish sticks...very meaty. So, we are just chatting at this point and I go to put my arm up on the back of the booth when I see a full grown COCKROACH (NOT A WATER BUG, A ROACH) crawling FROM the direction of the kitchen and along the wall. We all shriek (involuntarily) and call the waiter over. He sees it and tried to kill it but it crawled down somewhere and he moved us to a center table. Of course, we are disgusted and shaken. He brings over the rest of our drinks from the table and tries to bring the food over..I was like...\"no we don't want that now.\" 

The manager was called over and began to spin a story and try to do damage control. We told her we appreciated it, but our experience was ruined and we would not be paying full price (in my mind I was thinking we'd pay half and that'd be fair). They said their place is pristine and gave us a tour of the kitchen after 20 minutes of telling us we could  (if it was as clean as she swore, why did we have to wait so long?). The floor was sticky, there was clearly a second kitchen, but she insisted it was a hallway (lie, we saw servers coming from that area with trays and trays of food all night). 

The meal ended up being on the house but we still tipped our waiter because, after all, he just brings the food. As we are exiting (not making any sort of fuss), the hostess rolls her eyes at us when we say good night! Really?? This is a FILTHY freaking restaurant and you have some ill feelings towards some dissatisfied customers? Some nerve! I have gone to firefly when there was a location in Henderson and enjoyed myself immensely. I WILL NEVER EVER EVER DARKEN THIS RESTAURANTS DOORWAY AGAIN. It was filthy, and their staff are (obviously) poorly trained! 

Hostess tip: just smile and say good night! We tipped you anyway, and clearly you did not deserve it."}
{"text":"YUMMM!  My friends and I ordered so many tapa dishes and each and every one was awesome.  Each dish was so flavorful and perfect.  You must also try their sparkling sangria...very good.  Not much more to say, but you must try!! 

It's off the strip, but a cab ride from the Palazzo was about $10."}
{"text":"Since writing the below review, the manager of the restaurant contacted me to discuss. This is huge to me as it shows that the restaurant \"gives a $%#@.\" I'm going to amend my review to 3-stars until I've had time to maybe give it one last shot - and discuss my experience with the management.

Previous Review:
It is not often that a restaurant goes from extremely good to extremely bad, but here is the exception. This restaurant used to be really good, but the quality and service has slipped over time. I have been beyond dissapointed the last three times I've gone there and embarassed in the cases where I brought others. Further, our last server badmouthed another local restaurant - low class. Oh, and here's the killer... the owner of the restaurant they badmouthed was the person that recommended  Firefly to us in the first place! The bacon wrapped dates which are a tapas staple used to be a standout, but the last few visits the bacon was barely cooked and was more like a withered grape wrapped in a cold rubber band. it also seems that they perhaps downgraded the quality of the meats they use overall. Hopefully they don't continue their downward decent quality wise - and hopefully they gain a simbilance of class back by not badmouthing their competitors to customers. I can only speculate that whatever made this restaurant what it once was either left or moved to the other new location across town."}

{"text":"I had a ho hum experience at Firefly.

Our party wanted to have a lighter fare for dinner before hitting the clubs later that night (and the pool the next day) so we though tapas would be a great idea.

I tried the sliders, bacon wrapped dates, and macaroni cheese. The sliders I think were the best thing I tried, followed closely by the dates. The mac and cheese was nothing special. I looked around and everything were a decent size and price. Everyone seemed happy with what they got. I also tried the sangria which again, was lackluster in my opinion. It did nothing really to continue my buzz started earlier on in the day.

We also had two or three of our tapas \"forgotten\" so when we checked with the waiter, the explanation was that the order was never written down. Oh well, not a huge loss.

Not bad, but again, not compelling enough for me to come back when I am in Vegas again. It is a little out of the way from the strip so plan accordingly, our taxi driver got lost on the way there..."}
{"text":"This place was hands down the best restaurant I ate at in Vegas - and I ate everywhere.  The neighborhood is shady and it is a strip mall (which normally means I won't even bother reviewing) but the food - omg the food was out of this world.  The prices were perfect, the portions were ample, and the service was phenomenal.  I can not recommend this place enough, just make sure you make reservations!"}
{"text":"One of the tastiest places in Vegas! Every dish explodes with flavor! 

Service is great!"}
{"text":"I honestly don't know what the hype on this place is. I think their dishes are OK. 

The last time I went there, everything tasted extremely salty. I was recommended by a friend to try the bacon wrapped dates and I'm not really a huge \"sweet food\" kinda person (if that makes sense).  But it tasted really sweet with maple bacon wrapped around it = greasy and sweet. 

I ordered the baked tilapia, it was alright, it was drenched in lemon juice and salt. 
Filet Mignon sliders were okay, the bread was kind of hard.

The sangrias were really good though, tried the sparkling sangria and the red sangria. 

I love the tomato soup and brie sandwich, but I probably won't be back unless I'm craving that. 

The atmosphere is dim lit and enticing with the bar lighting in the background which gives it most of it's appeal."}
{"text":"Firefly is perfect for groups, but definitely make reservations!  Firefly's ambiance is high-energy and a bit romantic, as evidenced by the dim lights and curtains dividing areas.

We made reservations for 8 people at 6:45 and were seated right away in a booth that comfortably fit all 8 of us.  It was especially nice because we were seated in a little nook that gave us privacy, and more importantly, a quieter area so that we could actually hear each other.

Disclaimer: I am not a sangria connoisseur, so my taste is not very discriminating.  I ABSOLUTELY LOVED the sparkling wine sangria; I regret not getting a pitcher.  It went down just like juice.  It is on the sweeter side, so beware if you like a more mild sangria.

As for the tapas, I had the tuna tartare and the petite filet.  The tuna tartare was pretty bland and rather oily, however, I was impressed with how fresh the fish was!  This was the first time I had tuna tartare, so maybe that was how it was supposed to taste, but I would not get it again.  However, I loved the pairing with taro chips (disclaimer: I may be a little partial because I am from Hawaii) because it was a little different and made up for the oiliness of the marinade.  The petite filet was DELICIOUS!  It was cooked perfectly, moist, and soft.  I absolutely loved the red wine sauce, as well as the fact that it came with mushrooms!  It is a must have!

My friend had the firefly fries, which I heard good things about.  However, I thought it was also rather bland and oily, and did not eat too many of them.  

All in all, I would definitely return for the sangria and because of all of the enticing tapa options!  There are so many other tapas I would love to return to try.  Additionally, I didn't save any room for dessert and the banana-nutella sandwiches are calling my name!  Firefly is perfect for groups of friends to catch up!"}
{"text":"I was visited Firefly last weekend on Friday night and I have to say bacon wrapped dates!  That was the best part of dinner.  The ambience was trendy and the service was quick and polite.  Besides the bacon wrapped dates, which were amazing we had the filet mignon sliders, which were good but I don't think filet mignon should be served in a burger.  It takes away from what it is.  We also had the patats bravas and skewers which were good as well.  I tried the sangria, which was good but a little too sweet and light on the alcohol for my taste.  The reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is because while we were waiting to be seated outside because it was so crowded all the smokers were lightiing up right outside the door and it was super gross coming from a nonsmoker.  They should designate a smoking area.  Also, we were seated outside where there are no smoking signs posted everywhere yet we saw some girls smoking on one side and none of the staff people said anything."}
{"text":"Always a favorite. Just tried the Eastern Ave location and loved it.  View is amazing day or night and staff was super friendly and accommodating.  Food was consistently what we would expect - fabulous.  White Sangria was delicious.  My favorite dishes are the garlic/parmesan fries, beet salad, meatballs, steak skewers.  There are so many great dishes however...never disappointed."}
{"text":"Amazing food!  Worth the wait (expect a wait).  Great atmosphere, great menu selection especially for family style dining and don't forget to enjoy a pitcher of sangria with your meal!"}
{"text":"I stop by this restaurant every time I go to Vegas. Never a disappointment. I love the tapas (all of them) and the service is always excellent."}
{"text":"I had my wedding dinner at firefly on November 2015. I had a total of 35 guest, and let me tell you people it was the best choice I had  on taking them to Firefly. 
Not only the food was delicious but the staff was greattt... they handled all my 35 guest very well..lol..
I wanted to thank the staff that took care of us on that night... thumbs up for you all..

Love it love it"}
{"text":"A great tapas restaurant! Had trouble deciding what to order because there're so many things on the menu I want to try. Of course I ordered the mushroom tart because I LOVE mushroom (see my russian family bistro review). The fried calamari is a bit oily though. Everything else was good, but not so spectacular that I remember the individual dish to put on this review.

We also ordered a pitcher of sangria, but later on I found out that I actually do not like sangria. So my boy had to finish the whole pitcher by himself. Not that he's complaining.

I'd definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately this location has to lose a star because some things were just not up to par. 

I have to start by saying I love, love, love Firefly to the bottom of my soul but today was not the best I have had from them, but not the worst, either. Took my mom here for her first time and just a couple of the things were a bit \"off\". 

We started by ordering a pitcher of sangria which was not filled to its usual height (almost halfway down the pitcher!) and it only had apples and one slice of orange. That's it. No grapes, no other lovely fruits, just apples and one single slice of orange. Meh. It still tasted alright, but was not of the usual fruity goodness I have come to know and love. Usually I love digging through my glass for fruit as it keeps me from getting sloppy-drunk quicker. 

The service was alright, but we had to ask for a lot of things including our waiter who seemed to disappear a lot even though the place was almost empty. We had to ask for water, to order more food, etc. At one point we got the manager over when we ordered some stuffed peppers and were perusing the menu for dessert and he was very nice and even sent over a plate of flan since it was what my mom and I talked about possibly getting with him, and apparently we are quite charming whilst intoxicated. This alone kept the 4th star because overall I still wasn't completely impressed as usual. 

I ordered the tortilla a la espanola, the warm spinach salad, veggies and lentils, stuffed peppers, and the fruit and cheese plate for dessert. My mom ordered some skewers with chorizo, steak, and shrimp which she absolutely fell in love with and she liked the tortilla a la espanola and the stuffed peppers of mine that she tried. The warm spinach salad was a little lacking, they hardly filled the plate. Usually this thing is ridiculously huge to the point where I cannot order any more. The veggies and lentils I was most disappointed in though as it completely lacked any mushrooms at all. This is the one dish I always get because their mushrooms are prepared in it so well and so deliciously that the taste and texture is like biting into a rare steak. But this dish did not have one single mushroom at all. Bummer. Oh and I will now forever only order my flan for dessert as the fruit and cheese plate was alright but nothing to write home about, but I am glad I got it out of the way. One crumbly cheese in particular had me gagging and reaching for all the beverages on the table. Do not want. 

If I had not been here before I probably would have given it the same rating, maybe a 3.5 since we did spend a ton of money between us and the service was a bit lacking. When you have to look around in an empty restaurant for service and your waiter only shows up once after being served to ask if you're doing okay, that's not that great. Overall I love Firefly but this experience wasn't that great."}
{"text":"A nice inexpensive, Spanish tapas restaurant located off the strip. I went there with my friend Tabitha her boyfriend, and a three other mutual friends. They make a pretty good mojito. All of my friends and I really enjoyed ourselves. And yes there open late."}
{"text":"This restaurant was Amazing and not on the Strip. The food was fabulous and our server Alejandro was amazing..... I love how all the servers worked as a team to bring out the food..... Baked Goat Cheese, Tuna Tatars, White Sparking Sangria, we had so many wonderful dishes I cannot even name them all..... it was definitely worth the drive"}
{"text":"I love this spot!!! My girl loves the Sangria, and you can't go wrong with the Paella. They kill it. Service isn't 100% though, had to ask a few times for some things. Otherwise good spot."}
{"text":"Came here for a friend's bday celebration this weekend. Pretty good tapas place a street parallel of the strip. Everything was pretty reasonably priced and the food was pretty yummy. 
After a couple Heine's, sangrias and Millers we got a bit rowdy but it was all in fun and other people seemed to be tolerable of the racket we caused. 
Minus a star for not being able to sing Happy Birthday to their diners. We had to do that ourselves and had a great time. =)"}
{"text":"every thing was awesome!  all the dishes were very flavorful! the mango mojito was very good, i think i could drink a whole  pitcher by myself!"}
{"text":"When I retired from the Air Force, we had my retirement dinner here.  This is where I bring my out of town friends when I want to impress them.  Casual atmosphere, great food, 3-day marinated sangria, great prices. Just take your time and enjoy. Make reservations through Urbanspoon for dining points."}
{"text":"It is a good place for drinks and late night snacks but if you are looking for authenticity and food quality you will be let down.  It is fine if you don't really know food."}
{"text":"It almost saddens me to see all these other reviews for it leaves me with no new accolades to shout.  My daughter had her wedding reception at Firefly on Saturday night.  We'd pre-selected our choices of appetizers and the dinner to be served.  The service was beyond exemplary.  Regina coordinated the tables, the serving, the bar.. Neal kept a smile on the face of all our guests with his maintaining the desires of the thirsty.  I'm sorry I did not get the names of the other servers but I do thank them all so very much.  Now the food.  Wonderful.  We ate and ate and our guests all were thrilled with everything.  It was such a great evening.  The room was perfect and I had a great time.  Thank you so very much for your part in making this day so special for all of us."}
{"text":"Friday's is Latino night at FireFly and it's loads of fun.  Easy access to parking and the patio is very lively. The ambiance throughout is perfect. It's a great place for couples or larger groups. The tapas are delicious. Try the Salmon Beagles and the Ahi Tuna Skewers with a nice glass of Liberty School Cabernet Sauvignon and it's a sure combination that will get your happy mood started. Daniel and Omar our bartenders where great, very helpful and super quick. I really enjoyed the music, it made me want to get up and dance the night away. Thank you for a lovely experience."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! I make a special trip out here every time I come to Vegas. Now as a personal favor to your old pal Lauren B. Please please get some sangria. Now you may ask yourself who is Lauren B. to that I say less talk more sangria ordering. Any flavor is good really, I like the sparkling sangria personally but I like champagne so order based off what you like. 

I highly recommend coming for happy hour because it's 50% off drinks and pitchers of sangria. To me this doesn't translated into savings it translates to woohoo 50% more drinks. While you're at it try the bacon wrapped dates and firefly fries. I would avoid the fish sticks they were good but I felt like two small strips of fish was overpriced for $9."}
{"text":"Food was good, atmosphere was more of a bar type than a resto. Great Flavors."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and order their sangria. It's great. That alone was worth the \"off-the strip\" uber fee. A friend, who lived in Vegas at the time, invited us here many years ago. We had a great experience then and it's still great now. The tapas style menu is not too small and if you choose right - you can have a very yummy experience. I'd honestly come here for the sangria alone."}
{"text":"I love Firefly, don't get me wrong, but this visit was a disaster. This was my second visit to this location and as much as I enjoy the food, the service was horrendous. I went with my boyfriend to celebrate his friend's birthday, and apparently Firefly only lets you reserve a table for 15 people. This became a problem quickly when there were around 20 guests for this event, and the hostess had to scurry around like a chicken with its head cut off to get us situated. She also seemed to get a stern talking-to by her boss which was not pleasant to watch. This hostess also seemed to be the only one who realized that the restaurant was busy as everyone else went at a much slower pace. I am all for ambiance, but I also want my food.

After telling our waiter that we wanted to order around 8:30, we actually got to after 9 PM. Starving, I ordered my usual delights to share with my boy: veggies & lentils, mac & cheese, tortilla a la espanola, and stuffed peppers. The food was wonderful but as I mentioned, the service was not. Water refills only came around once, and when the food did come out the waiter had no idea who ordered what, so the servers just kept going around the table yelling out what they had in their hands and we all had to fight for our food, especially with duplicate orders. I myself had to practically stab a party guest with my fork who took my veggies & lentils, poking at it saying, \"I don't think this is what I ordered...\" while I was on the other side of the table glaring at her for stealing my food. Not the most organized bunch, those Firefly servers. 

Overall this location is wonderful, but try and go with 8 people or less so you can actually enjoy the atmosphere looking out onto the Fremont Street Experience and get service in a timely and efficient manner."}
{"text":"Tapas have never tasted so good in Las Vegas. My reasoning is, why should I spend $$$$ for the smallest tapas I will ever get on the strip? Granted there are delicious and amazing tapas restaurants on the strip, but FireFly is kick ass! 

The food! The food is delicious every single time! Incredible portions! You get your money's worth. The service is great and they make sure you're doing alright. I like the decor a lot. There's a reason there is over 1,000 review for this place.

This is what you must order: the bacon wrapped figs, the tuna tartare, the shrimp ceviche, the empanada, camarones al ajillo and go for a dessert! 

This is my second 5 Star Las Vegas Restaurant review. I am very fortunate to have the means to travel and enjoy incredible restaurants."}
{"text":"I'm one of the lucky ones...

I ate here twice back in the day, and never had an issue or any negative repercussions.  In fact, we really enjoyed it.

Now, I'm simply afraid to return..."}
{"text":"What a great place!!  Let me just say the service was exceptional.  The food delicious we tried so many different ones it was great would definitely recommend it to everyone and try everything we just about did!!"}
{"text":"I'm giving 2 stars because the drinks were good. The food was smothered in cream sauces. The surf and turf I ordered came with raw shrimp and beef. Don't understand why this place has a high star rating."}
{"text":"Hands down, my favorite place to go to in Vegas for a nice dinner. Swanky atmosphere, good service, and great food. Their pitcher of strawberry mojitos is my fave!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed this place!  Group of 10 people had wonderful time.  Varieties of tapas dishes and drinks were excellent.  Must try the bacon wrap dates!!"}
{"text":"I've always wanted to try Tapas and Firefly was my first experience. Its a really cute little place, and we made the mistake of thinking we could find the kids something to eat while we were there. Bad idea with two picky little ones. Good idea for adults who aren't scared of food. 

We had tons of delicious plates. We ordered the lamb kabobs, the ham and cheese croquettas, the roasted beet salad, the calamari, surf and turf kabobs, the stuffed dates, mac and cheese, ribs, and something with octopus. I despise octopus, and this was deliciously prepared. Wow. Everything was amazing. We even ended up getting two free glasses of wine when they poured too many glasses for another table. It is very pricey, but well worth it!"}
{"text":"This has always been one of my favorite places in town, despite all the bad press.  The food has always been great, the service wonderful, and the 3-day marinated sangria (as well as the pitchers of mojitos) goes down WAY too smoothly."}
{"text":"I'm not one to review anything, but I have to for this. This place is amazing! Bartenders are nice and cool ass people. They got latin nights on Friday? Come on man; hot a** females? It's good stuff. I'd recommend this place to all of my friends."}
{"text":"I gave this Firefly only three stars because every time I have been there,and I continue to go back because I love their tapas,I have never once been disappointed with my orders and the sangria is yummy too. It's the service that is lacking. Every time I have been there I have had to get out of my seat to ask for salt and pepper,more water,to order again and get napkins. The girls  and guys working we're more then helpful in getting what I asked for, they just weren't  on the ball so to say. Great place to eat some new flavours,I love the decorating and the music.  I will continue to go,always in hopes I get wowed by service."}
{"text":"Apparently this is a very popular spot in town.  It was jam packed when we got there on  Friday night ~ 7:30 pm - prime time for dinner so we had to wait for ~ 40 min on a Friday nite for a table for 2.  Drinks & food were good and they've got pretty fast service.  The staff were always circling around taking empty plates, glasses of our table. Prices are also very reasonable as well.  Definitely will come back next time we're in town"}
{"text":"Central location, great vibe, large patio and vast menu, this place does have something for everyone - however, you have to know to ask when it comes to special diets.

Only after we ordered their Firefly fries with cheese on the side and my friend stated that I was vegan was I offered the vegan menu..and our server was vegan. How did she not think to offer it from the start? Yes, there is a menu that features vegetarian, vegan and GF options. I've suggested they offer it to guests when giving the standard menu. Hope they run with that.  Think they'd have a lot more people talking about their attention to dietary preferences.

So from my humble vegan opinion you should have the artichoke crab cakes and heirloom carrots and go from there if you are still hungry. Both are amazing and my non-vegan friend even agreed. 

From my humble beer lover opinion they have a nice selection of drafts and of course their sangria is kinda famous in this town."}
{"text":"Food was ok and service was really bad.

We went there for the Christmas Eve dinner. We made the reservation at 11pm via OpenTable which shows that they have reservation available at 11 or 11:30. However after we arrived the waitress said they will close at 12. We decided to just eat very fast which turned out to be a really bad idea because during the dinner the wait staff were really impatient and rude.

Most of the food were also not as good as the other yelp reviewers said...although I am not sure if it was because it was the Christmas Eve."}
{"text":"I had never been to Firefly until last night; I used to go to Sedona for the type of experience Firefly offers, since they used to have a fantastic happy hour with awesome, cheap appetizers and drinks. Now they've gone through several menu changes and what's left is barely worth the price, so it was finally time to scope out a new spot.

The service at Firefly was top-notch, very fast, and as a bonus our server was nice to look at. The decor was pretty cool and I loved the table we were sat at, which had little couches instead of chairs; it really lent itself well to the relaxed atmosphere, plus they were SO comfortable!

When we ordered, our food came really fast--much faster than we expected, not that that's a bad thing. Unfortunately it was definitely hit-or-miss. Here's what we ordered with my impressions:

-Artichoke toasts: These were pretty good, I liked them but they weren't very noteworthy.

-Smoked salmon toasts: The only thing I really did not like. At least to my palate, the dairy and salmon flavors they used were not complimentary at all, and the added dill and capers just made a bad combination somehow worse. Yuck.

-Stuffed dates: These were fantastic and I could eat them all day if no one stopped me and the dates didn't run out. If you don't at least try them you're depriving yourself.

-Tomato basil soup: The soup was too salty and nothing much to speak of, the brie sandwich was good (if you LOVE brie like I do) but it would have been done better justice if it were paired with some fresh strawberry slices or strawberry preserves. It's just not a good tomato soup companion.

 -Firefly*fries: These were delicious, but the aioli was nothing special and I would have loved a different dipping sauce with these fries.

-Crispy duck rolls: These were just OK. The duck was overcooked and tough, but the flavors were okay. It would have been better if the duck had been shredded more finely, and the hoisin sauce a little sweeter.

-Lamb skewers: These were the biggest disappointment unfortunately. They tasted OK but they were very tough and unremarkable. You can get much better lamb skewers at Flame Kabob.

Dessert platter: I had the lemon-berry tart (delicious but it's just a bite), flan (very good, not too dense), and the tres leches cake--which was much too dense, a little mealy, more like a brownie. I was not a fan, nor would you be if you like REAL tres leches cake.

Plus a martini, forgot what it was called but it was a gin martini with cucumber and lime. That was pretty fantastic.

Overall, I would go there again for the $15 pitchers of mojitos during happy hour, but I will have to learn what's good and what isn't from their food menu. The place is pretty OK, but not great."}
{"text":"Authentic food, sangria excellent, got the pitcher and it's so good, just like the sangria we have in Spain. Spanish decor, very nice ambiance. I come here everytime we are in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Hadn't been here in awhile, used to come quite frequently though. It is conveniently located down the street from LVAC so we stopped here for dinner after a workout. I would probably pay money for the  complimentary bread and butter! We ordered wine and 7? Plates. We got chicken skewers , stuffed peppers , spicy beef salad , summer veggies , apple machango salad and I might be missing one? Either way we devoured everything in an hour between two girls :) the service was great! We sat outside and although it was quite busy our server was attentive. Ended spending about 100$ with tip."}
{"text":"Sunday, July 15,2012. Firefly Tapas. Dear Mr. Vernon, We accept the fact that we assumed that Firefly was only a Lunch/Dinner spot. What we did *was* wrong. But we think you're crazy to make us write an essay telling you why we came for Sunday Brunch at 10:00am. What do you care? You see Firefly as you want to see it - in the simplest terms, in the most convenient definitions. You see it as a brain (making delicious cocktails), an athlete (bringing top notch service), a basket case (what's with the pictures of cocks, and was the wall paper painted after a fifth of gin?), a princess (paintings of beautiful flamenco dancers, but why are they all facing away?) and a criminal (black leather seats and rivets? Are they into S&M). Correct? That's the way we saw Firefly until at 10:00 this morning. We were brainwashed

Yup, you heard right, Firefly is now open for Sunday Brunch. If that doesn't make you squirm in your seat, moth watering for tasty tiny plates of flavor, you need to get out more.

Here is a detailed breakdown of what we had, and what we thought:

Firefly*Benedict - one Benny with chorizo - lots of flavor, but you'll need something else to rest your palate. 
Patatas Bravas - Mmmm, tasty potatoes with a seasoned aioli, very yumm
Carne Asada Breakfast Taco - good complement to the benny, this could be a bit bland on its own
Huevos Rancheros - perfect balance of egg, bean and sauce
Lemon-Ricotta Pancakes - the Molly Ringwald of the day, light and fluffy, and tasty with blueberry gravy - we had two
Kinky Kelly - this is one of their signature cocktails, like a sweeter belini with a fruit rollup candied flower floating in it
Blackberry Gin and Tonic - another delightful cocktail, perfect balance if you like gin

One last note about the service, please remember that this is tapas, which means that you are likely going to make your server run in several orders as you taste and sample the many delights. If they are able to manage this with multiple tables, with some sunday brunchers bringing groups of six to eight, they are kickin' butt. For good service, you might want to kick in an extra percent or two for the extra effort that this requires.

So in closing:

Dear Mr. Vernon, we accept the fact that we thought Firefly was a night time place. What we did *was* wrong. But we think you're crazy to no get your butt up on Sunday to try their Brunch. You see them as you want to see them... In the simplest terms, in the most convenient definitions. But what we found out is that each one of us is a brain drinking cocktails
The server: ...and an athlete, remember 15 visits to your table...
The decorator: ...and a basket case, those are chickens, not \"cocks\"...
Flamenco Paintings: ...a princess, isn't my neck lovely...
The decorator again: ...and a criminal, leather and rivets remind me of Spain...
Skacey: Does that answer your question?... Sincerely yours, the Firefly Brunch Club."}
{"text":"love this place. ate there 4 times on recent trip to Vegas. the tuna tartare with the sesame topping is my favorite  but all the food is good and a good value. went to jaleo as well on the trip which is also tapas at the cosmo and spent 4 times as much and thought the food at firefly was better. 

my wife really liked the tomato soup and grilled cheese with bruyere cheese
the free bread is amazing with the almond butter. 


criticisms: 
some days the tuna was fresher then others and some days it was cut a little sloppily. ask people if they want more chips to start because its never enough.

the stuffed mushroom didnt seem to have alot of flavor for having chorizo in it. needed more salt both times imo. 

the stuffed almond dates which have always been one of my favorites seemed greasier then past years when ive come

all the meats and kabobs were awesome. cooked well. good portions. staff was friendly"}
{"text":"Since moving to Las Vegas 6 months ago, I have gone here more times that I care to admit. I have tried almost everything on the menu and am NEVER let down! This is a great place to go with friends because everybody will find something they like on their massive menu. It's affordable, easy to get in even on a weekend night, and just an all around great atmosphere. Plus you can sit outside at night under strings of lights and heat lamps - it really doesn't get better than that!

Menu Highlights:
Stuffed Dates
Mac n' Cheese
Stuffed Peppers
Serrano Sliders
Padron Peppers
Baked Tequila
Tuna Tar Tar"}
{"text":"Boquerones and manchego mac and cheese were pretty good! Tres leches cake was also nice. Should have gone with the full pitcher of Sangria. Can't wait to try the paella next time."}
{"text":"First time dining here on 05/20/10.  The experience here was wonderful.  We tried ...
-Stuffed dates
-Chorizo clams (the best)
-Filet mignon sliders
-Albondigas (meatballs)
-Red Sangria
-Tres Leche cake
All the items were great, I highly recommend the Chorizo clams if you enjoy clams... 
I will definately be back for more!"}
{"text":"Love love love firefly....bacon wrapped dates...has been amazing food everytime i have been there.... The service was ok...will definately go back...always great for a party!!!"}
{"text":"Great food! We stayed on the strip and went looking for good food that wasn't an arm and leg. This place did not disappoint,  we got three drinks and four tapas for less than $90 not including a tip."}
{"text":"THIS IS THE BEST SPANISH RESTAURANT PERIOD!!! i have nothing but positive things to say about this place the dish's each time we go cooked to perfection and the atmosphere is great! the Paella(has shellfish shrimp and miscellaneous sea dwelling additives on Spanish rice) is by far my favorite and the mojitos are amazing as well.....if your ever near this place and wanna have a good meal ......look no further because you found it =)"}
{"text":"I love Firefly. This is one of the few restaurants where I have a hard time ordering because I love so many things on the menu. 

The sangria is great. It's an absolute must. I love both the white and the red.

When it comes to food, you pretty much can't go wrong, no matter what you order. And despite being tapas, the portions are actually pretty generous. Because there are so many options, I try to change up my order every time, but I always bully my friends into sharing an order of the fries (which are amazing). 

And if you somehow manage to save room for dessert, the banana nutella sandwiches are highly recommended. 

My only complaint is that it can be a little bit loud at times."}
{"text":"I love this place. I discovered it one day walking down paradise blvd cause I was staying off the strip @ the Marriott. It's a Tapas place I have taken almost everyone of my friends to when I go to Vegas with. The prices are so much cheaper then the casino. When you there order the ribs, Mac n cheese, shrimp diablo, Thai beef salad, and the fries. Everything is super tasty and delicious. Its open late but it's perfect food for when you plan to go out to the clubs and party. Stop by and try it."}
{"text":"If I had actually sat down at a table to have a decent meal, maybe I would have given more stars. But they were so crowded that we had to eat at the bar, 7 people with 3 seats. While you need a coat outside, inside was so hot and humid that we were sweating bullets. Just tried to eat as fast as possible and get the hell outta there!  You just can't enjoy food when being rushed, especially when the food is just OK at best. I don't need to come off the strip for this. 

The plates all sound intriguing, but the taste is kind of one note, like they had a list of spices and HAD to use all of them in EVERY dish. I honestly cannot remember what I had because everything tasted about the same and sorta blended together, not to mention way salty."}
{"text":"Loved this spot in Vegas.  Our friends who are locals always come here, and we wanted to order the whole menu.  We had the bacon wrapped dates, some shrimp tapas dish amongst other things. Definitely recommend. Ambience is nice and service is great."}
{"text":"My favorite bar in Vegas is firefly! The food and drinks are DELICIOUS! My only problem is they don't offer any industry discounts! My friends and I always debate Firefly or Blue Martini and we usually end up at Blue for the 40% off drinks with a work badge. Come on Firefly step it up a bit! A small discount goes a long way ;)"}
{"text":"I am so glad I found this place on yelp. Stopped here for dinner before heading back to Orange County, and the place blew our mind. Went with a group of 5 people and we ordered a bunch of tapas to share family style. Everything we ordered was on point delicious. What makes this place even more amazing is the service they have. The entire
Staff is so happy to serve. They greet you with a smile, they serve your food with a smile...everyone here is so happy. Definitely will be stopping by every time we're in Vegas. We had the fried calamari, Mac and cheese, tuna tartare, firefly fries, Tierra y mar skewers, mushroom tart, muscles, and beet salad. Along with the free bread they serve with almond butter. Awesome! Best place we ate at during our Vegas trip. Love love love this place! Must try!"}
{"text":"Less touristy, more local. Great prices, siick menu. 

Olive tapenade, ahi tuna, crispy foie graus (cherry hoisin sauce) and blood orange mojitos are ethereal"}
{"text":"You must try this place!! 
The sparkling sangria is you die for.   I couldn't stop drinking this.   
The tapas;
1) artichoke toast 
2) bacon wrapped dates. You have to try these.  
3) tuna tartare melts in your mouth and the chips are so crispy. 
4). Order the Paella it is worth the wait.    We had the mixed Paella.   
This place is a must come and eat while in Vegas."}
{"text":"This tapas restaurant is really very good. They have big selection of dishes, and of the ten or do we tried, everything was perfectly cooked and seasoned--ranging from the warm spinach salad to the boquerones to the pulpa. One great thing is that they are fine working with even the most limited diet restrictions--our server checked on dishes and made sure everything was up to par for me. And she did it all graciously, which isn't always the case at restaurants. 

The wine list was a nice treat, with a range of inexpensive Tempranillos and Malbecs, a change from the spendy wines everywhere else (if I wanted overpriced wine, I'd never leave Anchorage). They had a delicious sparkling sangria, too, which is never heard of before. 

I liked the atmosphere: dark, comfy, and great Spanish art all around. The music was fun. The space was big and accommodating. 

I'd love to go back when I can eat everything again. My one and only criticism is that the flavors of what we had and what we're on other menu items was a little one-note, without much expansion beyond red peppers and garlic, both of which are good, but a little variety for the palette always helps."}
{"text":"I went to Firefly with some family visiting from out of town. I have experienced tapas restaurants before but never this one. There were four of us and we chose two dishes each and then shared them around the table. Everything was well prepared and tasty. If I had to pick a personal favorite from our choices, I would be between naming the goat cheese or shrimp. That said, everything was good and with multiple choices everyone at the table found things they liked and things they really liked. We finished with a dessert sampler that was also very good. The service was prompt, courteous, and helpful. The price was in line with expectations, about $120 for four satisfied people with tip. Overall, this was a good lunch experience. The only negative is that it is right behind the LV strip so traffic can be a little daunting. That's not the restaurant's fault though. It just is the way of life in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"We came here with a large group of girls and had the Tapas Banquet for $30/pp plus some pitchers of Sangria at $24/pitcher.  Included in the Tapas Banquet is a starter of  some house bread, almond butter, smoked almonds, and marinated olives.  For our tapas, we ordered:

Chicken Salad 
Smoked Salmon on Brioche Toast
Bacon-Wrapped Dates
Steak Skewers with Mushrooms and Red Wine Sauce
Camarones a la Diabla  (Spicy Shrimp)
Camarones al ajillo (Garlic Butter Sauce)

For the most part the food was good. I thought the Chicken Salad was a little out of place at a tapas restaurant. But it was okay. The Smoked Salmon was meh. Tasted more like salmon salad spread on bread. So with these two as our introduction to Firefly, I was really hoping it was going to improve. Thankfully it did.  The  Bacon-Wrapped Dates
were a good combination of rich, sweet, and salty.  The Steak Skewers were filling.  The Camarones a la Diabla had a spicy little kick to it but I preferred the Camarones al ajillo instead. It just depends on your preference.
   
The dessert platter had a combination of caramel flan, a tres leches cake and some shortbread and fruit pastries. The suuuuperstar was the Chocolate Tres Leches.  Since it was family style, we kept asking for more. Unfortunately, we were on a time constraint so we couldn't stay and fully enjoy the tres leches at our leisure. But I would definitely come back to Firefly just for that!!! Mmmm!

The service was good with the waiters on top of making sure we had everything. Overall, a good experience with a-ok food."}
{"text":"Always amazing food, super fun atmosphere, and all exponentially magnified by impeccable service with Neo. I love this place."}
{"text":"One of the best night spots in Vegas.

If you find yourself in Las Vegas and looking for good grub on a budget, the Firefly is for you. The uber hip atmosphere is the perfect compliment to the awesome drinks which are an amazing match for the excellent food.

Served tapas style all of the food is awesome. I can highly recommend the ribs and the Garden Variety salad. Far better than \"Garden Variety.\"

All of the cocktails are great but be sure to order a pitcher of Sangria. This fruity wine punch is sure to be the hit of the party.

Our group of 5 were adequately stuff and lubricated for just over $100!"}
{"text":"The firefly in vegas is awesome!  Cool place to eat tons of appetizers and I recommend anything with Shrimp!!!  Great drinks too!  Very cool place"}
{"text":"Well well well firefly has done it again! 
We came here for my sister in laws bachelorette pre-party dinner and Eduardo was Amazing!! We had such an amazing dinner great service and great food ! 
Thank you FIREFLY"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time for a friends bday. I had heard soooooooo much about this place from pretty much every one I know so I was pretty excited. The place overall is very busy, noisy, and dark. All the servers and waiters were very courteous and never forgot one of our orders. Excellent. All the tapas that we ordered were pretty much delicious so I won't bore you with the details of what to order however I did notice that most of the tapas were on the salty side especially the firefly fries and the sliders. Granted they tasted delicious, just wished they cut down on the salt a teeny tiny bit. Ordered 2 mojitos which were also good. Just the right about of alcohol for me. I would definitely come back here for more girls night outs."}
{"text":"I enjoyed two trips to Firefly while visiting Las Vegas recently for a conference. Our group of three had an especially pleasant experience on a Friday for lunch. Our group of 8 found the restaurant to be surprisingly loud on a Monday night, but maybe that's just Vegas at night. Both times, though, the tapas were yummy and the service good."}
{"text":"Best tapas place I've been to. Was recommended by a friend who lives in Vegas. Sangria smooth and tapas so good. Can't wait to go again"}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't reviewed this place yet! We come to Firefly at least once a month for tapas and drinks. 

Firefly is a great spot for HH or a quick glass of sangria as a pre-game before heading out for the night. The food is consistently delicious and the white sangria is my favorite. And if you're craving something sweet the banana and nutella sandwiches hit the spot. Some of my favorite tapas are:

-thai beef salad
-shrimp diablo
-stuffed dates with bacon
-lamb skewers
-mussels

The paradise location can get super packed and I think I actually prefer the lay out of the bar area of the Sahara location. It's much less cramped."}
{"text":"Yeah we will be coming back... 

The stuffed dates wrapped in bacon with a wine reduction sauce is the way to start it off. Other notables are the Camarones a la Diablo and the paella. 

We had several plates between the four of us and ended with the great paella. I must come back for happy hour when prices are less."}
{"text":"Awesome!  Affordable, wonderful food - definitely try the sausage and the meatballs!  Sangria was fantastic.  Ambiance was wonderful - sat outside.  Tremendous value for Las Vegas!  Well worth the trip off the strip.  Would most definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"Firefly was a great way to kick start a fun and crazy Saturday night for my friends birthday. Six of us girls could not stop raving how awesome the food was and how nice the atmosphere was. The interior is a bit kind of cheap...but in a good way meaning that the dim cozy lighting, the red walls, the cliche artwork, and the general atmosphere felt not so Vegas and more like New York. Patrons were there to just relax, enjoy each other's company and order an endless round of great spanish fusion tapas.....what was good what wasn't as good as something else.....

Here's the run-down on what we ordered...

The tortilla espanola: I ordered this because it's a classic Spanish tapas. I thought this was the least successful of all the tapas we ordered. A bit dry, not as tasty as I've found it to be in Spain and this classic tapas restaurant in Dallas, Texas called Cafe Madrid. Skip it. 

The ceviche: GET ON IT! Lovely citrus marinade was fresh and vibrant made the shrimps and avocados well worth the money. My personal favorite. 

Olive and bread plate: take a bite of the olive, then the nutty sweet butter and then the bread. You'll see how it all works so well on the palate. 

Manchego Mac N Cheese: OMG. OMG. To die for. 

Stuffed Peppers: Thumbs up. Thought this was excellent. 

Crispy Duck Rolls: ORDER IT. It was fantastic. Flavor was salty, duck was cooked just right. 

Petite Filet: the filet was awesome...I felt the sauce a bit heavy and overdone...but most of the people at my table really enjoyed this. 

Shrimp Tempura: Everyone gave this a thumbs up....I passed on this and I was somewhat afraid of eating something fried after all the rich food I was tasting. 

Ahi Tuna Skewer: it was ok, but I think that I have tasted better. The ceviche outshined this dish. 

Calamari: Ok, I broke down and tasted on little ring of it and I would have eaten more if I wasn't so full. IT was delicious. 

Empanadas: Very good, very enjoyable meat filling. 

Next time I go, I would like to try the bacon wrapped dates, the sangria and the Steamed Mussels. 

The Coffee: VERY GOOD way to end the dinner (instead of dessert)

I think I've remembered everything....This was my favorite experience in Vegas. Please make the time to come here!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I have been here twice during business trips, and I wish the Reno area would have this restaurant or one very similar to it. They have amazing sangria. I have only had the red sangria, but it is very delicious. I only wish the fruit was a tad larger, so I could enjoy it more when my glass is finished.

I love the artichoke hearts. They are the perfect starter. The ceviche of shrimp is fresh and very flavorful. The terra y mare skewers were one of my favorites there. Packed with flavor and the salsa verde on them adds the perfect touch. The sliders are amazing. The mac 'n' cheese is divine. The babyback ribs fall off the bone. The only thing I have had so far that I really didn't care for was the empanada.

For dessert I had the gelato. I love gelato and since they had pistachio, they already won me over before tasting it. The gelato comes with a very tasty biscotti treat."}
{"text":"This place is always on point. Been coming here for the past several years and service never cease to disappoint. Food always good and bar tender Omar always takes care of us. Would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Soooooo delish!  It's off the strip (we stayed at the Flamingo, and it was a short walk - maybe a mile), but worth it.  It's all tapas, decently priced, and a friendly, young staff.  You can also check in early so you have a table waiting."}
{"text":"I had originally booked the downtown location for my wedding reception.  They had promised the entire dome room all to ourselves.  10 days before the wedding, and only after I called them THEY CANCELED!!  They had me relocate to the paradise location and sharing the room with all of the other patrons including a party of cross dressers that looked like they would have been more comfortable in football uniforms.  At this point you are probably wondering how and why I gave them 5 stars.  The food!  Oh my Lord the food was amazing!  Most of our guests had never had a tapas meal and were concerned when the first tapas of bacon wrapped dates came out.  This was the best thing I have tasted in quite some time!  We had 5 additional tapas following.  We had the ham & cheese croquettes, the spicy shrimp, chicken skewers, steak & mushroom skewers and mango ribs.  I did not even have any ribs and I was stuffed to the gills.  Everything was so delicious it was easy to ignore the fact it wasn't our ideal setting.  The drinks flowed like water.  It was an amazing night we will never forget."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to their new Firefly location since the whole health department incident, but I got a Groupon and thought I'd role the dice. Wow, am I glad I did!

The new location is very nice!! It's not as dark as the old location but dim enough for mood lightning. The waiter, runners, and busser were on point! Dirty plates taken quickly, we were regularly checked up on, and the food... Whhooooweee, the food!!!

We got bacon-wrapped dates (a must), chicken & chorizo stuffed mushrooms, tierra y mar skewers, and calamari. All were soooo good!! We also got a sangria pitcher that was delicious! 

We were stuffed but opted for the passion fruit (lilikoi) cheesecake bites and the lemon-berry tarts. Both were amazing. The passion fruit cheesecake may have been my favorite all night. I'll def be back!!"}
{"text":"I was brought here by my friends who are locals. This is hands down some of the best food I've ever had! Everyone must try this place. It's about one mile off the strip, so everyone should be able to reach it.

I have traveled around Spain and also regularly eat at Spanish restaurants across Southern California, and I have to say, I expected to find the typically understated and demure, simple and clean tapas I'm used to. Not So! This is bold and flavorful. It's Innovative, it's creative, it's Spanish fusion.

The Food Style:
This is gourmet at at an affordable price. IMHO the chef is a genius. Each small tapas plate is unique and individual, no two dishes are the same. Again, they are flavorful and bold, never bland. They display complex and contrasting flavors that are complimentary and blend seamlessly together to form a cohesive unit. Because each tapas plate is a small bite, the three of us were able to try 9 plates + 3 free bread and olive plates (The honey-almond-butter is amazing). This meal was like an amusement park for the taste buds.

I don't eat much meat, so we stuck to seafood and vegetable dishes. It's great for vegetarians.

My Favs (all 5 stars): The stuffed peppers, the roasted eggplant cannelloni, the manchego mac 'n' cheese, grilled scallops with saffron potato puree, and steamed mussels (incredible sauce). They give you as much free bread with honey-almond-butter and olives as you want. My friends raved about the bacon-wrapped stuffed dates, which are arguably the most popular item on the menu (I don't eat bacon).

Others (4 stars): Tortilla espaniola, patatas bravas (great brava sauce).


To Drink: A pitcher of Red Sangria. This is the real deal and very very tasty. It tastes like a fruity Merlot, not like some frou-frou fake sangria cocktail you get at chain restaurant.

NOTE: some tapas are better than others, but you have to be adventurous and start trying. Use the tips above. The only one I wouldn't order again was the seared ahi tuna skewers. They didn't have much flavor and the texture a little too tough to chew.

Ambience: somewhat dark and intimate, warm decor, comfy booths. 

Service: Excellent. very friendly and attentive. They easily accommodate special requests.

Prices: $35 per person after tip per person for 9 plates and a big pitcher of sangria, and we were all STUFFED. 

PROS: The Amazing Gourmet Food; great for vegetarians; affordable prices; delicious sangria; comfy booths;  great service too; close to the Strip (about 1 mile)

CONS: NONE

BOTTOM LINE: Come here, or you're missing out! I would consider driving back to Vegas from LA to eat here."}

Shrimp tempura. Clams with chorizo. Fish sticks. Mixed meat skewers. One other I forgot. Stella on tap and attentive service. Reasonable check. You can't ask for better."}
{"text":"A bit off the strip, but that is where a lot of the good places are too. This one of the good deals, and especially check out their happy hour. It is an easy drive off the strip,  about 5 minutes away from the madness :)

The restaurant itself is spacious and the servers are very attentive. They even helped out finding a glutenfree alternative for my friend.

So, happy hour here includes a lot of the good stuff on their regular menu, Did I mention the bacon wrapped dates? The squid was not that good but the fries, the meat balls (watch out they are very hot), the huge baby back ribs, salads, bread and what not.  

The portions were huge and the servers were always around making sure we were ok. 

Absolutely reccommended but remember, do not compare to expensive high end restaurants. Still, they are not that different from Serrano at Aria when all comes to all."}
{"text":"What a great off-the-strip destination!  They gave a very tasty menu with good wines and sangria by the glass.  I recommend the shrimp ceviche and the pulpo asado.  The staff was attentive and personable. When we arrived at 6:30, we found it packed with those who came for happy hour.  It was still full at 9 pm when we left.  I was there for a business dinner, but many were vacationers enjoying the fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"Not only the food but the service and recommendations that we got from Alex was excellent! It was our first time on this place and Alejandro explain really well our options and we like all the tapas and paella that he recommended.  Thank you Alex! 

We will return on our next trip to Vegas for sure!"}
{"text":"Great place for Tapas.  

Try the regular Mojito, it's the Bomb.  No need to get the pitcher as it works out to the same as buying individual mojitos & they have a tendency to knock you on your butt.  

The food has never disappointed, the sauce that comes with the Firefly fries is so good I could DRINK it!  

The service is good, but not \"stellar\" which is my criteria for 5 stars.

It gets packed on weekends, so beware!

Don't pass this one up!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for around 7-8 years and for me is a Vegas must (my favorite off the strip). Honestly, I prefer the old location, but I'm happy they have a bigger space now. The tapas here are incredible!!! Mushroom tart, Serrano Ham Sliders, Scallops and ended with the Banana Nutella Sandwiches. All amazing! Typically, I get these with cheese in them because they mainly use Manchego which is my favorite. So, I highly recommend the Mac and Cheese and the Manchego + Apple Salad. We didn't drink this time because we had to immediately drive, but both the white and red sangrias are to die for.  Pitchers on pitchers! Go here, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Nice spot with \"local\" flavor in Las Vegas. go for drinks, for outdoor sitting, for good talks and good food."}
{"text":"Tapas 

Great bread that keeps flowing.
Diablo Shrimp awesome. Sauce
Chorizo plate. Good selection
Steak salad. Had to get something green"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat off the strip! I've been here several times and every time I have loved it! Everything I've had there has been great. The sangria is great. My favorite is the stuffed dates and Nutella & banana dessert! But it is all delicious! I can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"I am going to steal the opening words from Raymond B's review. Not because he is my friend, but because he is intelligent, and one awesome dude.

\"Life is all about\"....great food, fantastic drinks, spent with people you care about. 

Ladies and gentlemen of Yelp....Firefly is that spot. I've used this spot as a go-to date spot, but most recently, I had two good friends in town from LA.

We checked in for our reservation (make one, just in case), and we were promptly seated. Immediately, we ordered the bacon wrapped dates (famous here), and a pitcher of Sangria (red). The Sangria marinates for three days, so you know it's legit.

Then came out the rest of our food. The Manchego Mac n Cheese, the Chorizo plate, the stuffed mushrooms, the apple manchego salad...the list goes on. We went to down.

Tapas at it's best.

This is THE best place to eat and drink with those you care about, and with those you want to impress. 

If you are from out of town, make sure you stop in. 700+ reviews. Vegas knows how to do food. This place lives up to the hype."}
{"text":"Sitting in a fairly unassuming and cookie-cutter shopping center east of the Strip is this gem of a tapas restaurant. I hate the fact that every place uses the term \"tapas\" to mean small dishes when they aren't serving spanish food. Okay, so I'm being somewhat picky about the terminology, but it bugs me when I see a japanese izakaya that advertises itself as japanese tapas; an izakaya implies small dishes and pub food! Will dimsum be thrown to the curb to ape a more trendy term as well?! 

Okay, okay, that was probably out of line. Let's move on, shall we?

Showed up with a group of six for a late sunday night dinner. No problem, we get seated right away a few feet from romancing couples and a table of near naked people celebrating halloween.  Off to a good start as far as I'm concerned.

Here's the low down on what we got:

Ceviche - tasty, there were larger and smaller pieces of shrimp and the bright citrus flavor was better than the salty watered down salsa versions I've had elsewhere.

Stuffed Dates - wow, so good. The dates aren't that sweet and you mostly get the smokey bacon flavor with a hint of sweetness and a crunch almond surprise on the inside. The blue cheese goes really nice with it.

Patatas Bravas - probably my least favorite out of everything we got that night. Tastes like big chunks of red potato. Meh.

Thai Beef Salad - I'm not really sure what that thai beef was, but it seemed like a pancake made of protein with things mixed in. Tasted okay, but I wasn't in a salad mood which might explain why I didn't love this one either.

Fried Calamari - Pretty straight up dish with nothing either outstanding about it nor bad. If you like fried calamari elsewhere, you'll probably like it here.  I'd probably save my stomach for something you can't find at every Italian restaurant on earth.

Beef Empanada - These were really good if you like a flaky pastry with meat filling. The only bad thing was that there's two pieces to an order.

Paella - Wow, by far my favorite! Order 2 per person so you'll never have to share. The chorizo was really good and I kept ignoring the seafood to snag some. I want a plate of this in front of me right now and I wouldn't hesitate to shoot a deer in the face to have it.

What I'd want to try next time:
Chicken and Chorizo Stuff Mushrooms
Crabclaw Corn Dogs
Tuna Tartare
Sausage Plate

Great place. Really dark inside (a table near us used their phones to read the menu) with an overabundance of those crappy paintings of spanish dancers shown from behind wearing a red dress that you see being sold on every cruise art auction.  Stop buying those paintings, people! They're pumped out of a kinko's printer in Cincinnati onto canvas!

TL;DR: Don't buy crappy art; eat at Firefly now."}
{"text":"Tried to go there yesterday afternoon and upon arrival the chick that was opening was super rude, so we bounced. No acknowledgement, no \"hey\" or \"hi\" nor \"thanks for opening the door (as she was carrying out a sign).\" 

We've gone to firefly several times over the years and their customer service has remained iffy. The food is good, but the service is shyte. 

Firefly, we like your food, but your hostess' have remained problematic over the years."}
{"text":"We had 4 tapas: Mac n Cheese $9, Calamari $10, Veggie Empanadas $6.5, Tierra y Mar Skewers $11.  A plate of bread which came free was super delicious.   Tierra y Mar Skewers was the best among 4 menus we ordered. The server was very friendly, atmosphere was nice but a bit noisy."}
{"text":"So glad that I gave this joint a go. The food was off the sheezy, awesome and filling paella that would give the ones in Spain a run for its money. Noteworthy dishes included: mac n' cheese, empanadas,  dates wrapped in bacon, and lamb chops. Everything came out fast and the sangria was also delicious, a pitcher to share is a must if dining as a group. This place was a huge hit for our party of 15."}
{"text":"Headed to Firefly for a late lunch. Per yelpers rave reviews, tried the dates wrapped with crispy bacon and had a surprise almond inside. This was a really good combination. 

Stuffed red peppers: Very good, stuffed with creamy goat cheese and covered in red sauce.

Calamari sautteed - can't remember what this was called but the calamari had chopped tomatoes. I didn't really like this as the calamari was very soft and mouchy. A little weird to me.

duck rolls - big rolls deep fried with lots of shredded duck meat and hoisin sauce. Good stuff. I think if it had a little less meat and some other element like green onions. Kinda like how chinese eat peking duck that would be better.

Also tried to be healthy by getting a Big Bowl of Salad. Refreshing, light and healthy.

The staff was attentive, they also brought some yummy garlic bread, and the food came out super fast. The red sangria was also fabulous!"}
{"text":"Firefly has been on my list for a couple years now.  Last night, I finally made it.  I love the intimate decor of this place after dark.  The service was friendly and the food was good.  By the time we left, the place was mobbed!  We ordered several plates.

Pulpo Asado:  mm-mm-mm, good!  the octopus was grilled to perfection.
Warm Spinach Salad:  Excellent!  I loved the vinaigrette that was tossed with this salad and the pine nuts were crunchy and fresh.  I cannot stand stale nuts.
Potatas Bravas:  a bit burnt with a crisp which I loved.
Firefly Fries:  I could have eaten several plates of this and could have sipped the aioli with a straw.  My goodness.
Baked Tilapia:  a delight.  Tilapia is not my favorite fish, but at FF it is.
Meatballs in Tomato Sherry Sauce:  Okay, not a highlight.
Gelato Trio:  Chocolate - check, vanilla - check, pistachio - ehhhh.  But that is a personal thing.  I don't like pistachio.

Overall, a great first experience at FF.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! We had the gazpacho, the mango bbq glazed ribs, the croquettes de jamon y queso, the Chicago bocadillos, and the seared Ahi tuna skewers. This was shared between 5 hungry people and we are stuffed. If you are in Las Vegas drive to Paradise just south of Sands Dr. and try Firefly. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The view alone at this place is worth the 5 stars. The dining room looks right down the Old Vegas strip (see my picture), and it's the perfect way to start out an adventure. Someone also told me that a scene from Casino was filmed in here, and I can see why.

They've got an extensive menu of tapas, most of which were excellent. A few (vegetarian) stand-outs include the mac & cheese, the stuffed peppers and the artichoke toast. We got a whole ton of stuff, and nobody complained about any of it. I've had better sangria, but it did what it needed to do. 

For dessert, we got the nutilla sandwich... which was exactly what we had hoped for. Just delicious, and the desert sampler offered a few more tasty offerings. 

The only complaint I have is that the tables are pretty small, especially in the booths. This can make an abundance of tapas tricky business, but besides that I think this place is a must-see for any new tourists to the area. It was certainly a memorable experience for me."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of tapas & this is one of my favorite restaurants ever. My only complaints are it's a little loud & crowded."}
{"text":"This is a very good Tapas place on Paradise. A wide variety of choices to choose from. Some traditional Tapas, some relatively unique.

All of the food is good. My favorite were the filet mignon sliders. They also have a full bar, including a wide selection of flavored Mojitos.

The service was fast & prompt and there food was delivered pretty efficiently. On a nice night, ask to be seated outside.

This place is in a strip mall and seems to have a good local crowd."}
{"text":"I loved this place! The only reason I can't give it 5 stars is because the wait time to sit and the wait time for your food are a little out of hand. 

*Tip* Before you read the rest: If you're looking to try the Paella, order as soon as your butt hits the chair. It is to die for, BUT you have to wait 45 mins while they wait! 

We went to Firefly for Valentine's Day, and it looks like we weren't the only ones that had that idea. We had to wait for about 45 min - 1 hour to be seated. Not bad for a popular restaurant, I guess, but definitely longer than I'm used to. Especially since there was just the two of us, not a large group. 

We tried a chorizo plate ( i forgot the name of it :( sorry)  It had an over-easy egg on top of chorizo and potatoes. It was warm, and spicy and the runny yolk was just icing on the cake. 

I did order the Paella and it came sizzling in a plate. It was the best Paella I've ever tasted, almost worth the wait. It was seasoned just right. I was so full from the other tapas, though,  that I ended up just tasting it and taking the rest of it home. 

Order the sangria! i got the white sangria. It was white sparkling wine, peaches, grapes, oranges. It was sweet and refreshing and with just the right amount of alcohol to make waiting for my paella bearable..."}
{"text":"My husband and I just got married in Vegas on Aug. 21, 2010 and we decided to have our wedding dinner at the Fire Fly at the Plaza downtown. Right from the get go Valeria was AWESOME, she was sooo helpful in planning the dinner because we are from NY so you never know what you are going to get until you get there. But I could just tell by the awesome customer service through email and then from talking to her that we would have no problem with the place. We were on a super tight budget and they were MORE than willing to work with us in any way that they could and they also reccommended the bakery where we got our cake from(Freed's Bakery-TOP NOTCH). Anyway, the staff was GREAT, funny and very helpful and fun!! The food, well only AMAZING can say how good it was, all of our guests raved about how great it was and how full they were, we had the bread and almond butter with olives, the salad, the mango ribs (so flavorful and tendor melt in your mouth), the spicy shrimp (huge and delicious) and for dinner family style we had the spicy potatoes, the paella the roasted chicken and the beef tips...it was all sooo good I actually was mad at myself for not eating more than I did, I could have eaten for days there!! If there is one place you have to eat in Vegas it MUST be the FireFly, and they have two locations, the food is great the people are freaking awesome and the price was great as well, I wouldn't have had it any other way and I will most certainly go back anytime I go back to Vegas..thank you sincerely from the Torres family!!!"}
{"text":"Thanks to a local friend of mine, we went to the Firefly for dinner one night. I can't say enough wonderful things about this place! We got a pitcher of Mojitos, and they were WONDERFUL! 

It is an awesome place to lounge, very nice lighting and date-friendly environment. We enjoyed the Filet mignon sliders, Crispy duck rolls, and the steak and mushroom skewers! By far, the Filet mignon sliders were the best, absolutely amazing!"}
{"text":"I do love Firefly and although this past event was for a big group I was slightly disappointed thus the four star rating.  

Although I received lots of attention and great service, it turns out the far end of my table was and felt a little neglected.  While I was getting ample bread, plenty of refills and attentive answers to my requests for more dishes the rest of the table was struggling for attention.  

As for the food I do have a favorite new dish in Pulpo Asado which was a grilled version of octopus that came with lentils and an excellent choice for my diet.  The splurge I had was the Epanadas that were slightly dry but still flavorful and well accompanied by the aioli sauce on top.  

Overall my glass was full and my stomach was satisfied but for a big group things could've been managed far better.  I won't stop coming here but I certainly will limit the size of my party in the future."}
{"text":"Great tasting food, cozy atmosphere. Attended a work dinner here for 50 people so everything was served family style and I didn't catch the individual item names. I ate veggie rice, roasted chicken, and artichoke appetizers -- all of which tasted really amazing. Service was very courteous. Have no idea about prices because I didn't pay for anything, but the food would be worth a good amount."}
{"text":"the place itself is nice. date night ambiance. food is very flavorful and great for sharing amongst friends. they had a dance floor outside that looked fun. only bad part is the parking situation and getting in/out of the parking. not enough room for all the people that were there. come early to get a spot."}
{"text":"FINALLY! Man, after a nightmare dinner last night, I was relieved to find this place for lunch! UH MAZINGGG! Wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside. We shared the mushroom with puffed pastry, warm spinach salad lightly coated with balsamic and goat cheese, empenadas, and calamari with aioli. Soo soo good! Everything was moderatley priced round 4-5 per tapa, the service was on the money, and an overall great casual dining experience. If you're in Vegas I recommend this place big time!"}
{"text":"If you're in Vegas with a party of 4 or more, you've got to check this place out.

I've made it a point to try and eat at least once off of the strip on each Vegas trip.  Located about 1 mile East of the strip by Sands Blvd (By Palazzo).  The prices are a bit more reasonable, and you'll find some real gems like this Firefly joint.  

Tell your cabbie \"Firefly on Paradise\" and they'll know where to go.

I don't think they take reservations for weekends, so we arrived early for dinner and had no wait being seated for 6 + a baby.  Also great for lunch I'm sure.

Here's the menu: http://www.fireflylv.com/menu.html

Besides one dish that was a bit sweet for my palate (I think it was the duck in cherry hoisin), I pretty much loved every dish.  I recommend trying the foreign things because they'r likely really good and that's the fun of foodie adventures.

The must trys are:
-Paella... good volume, generous seafood portions, and the goodness absorbed into the rice (plus, paella is the epitome of tapas)
-Chorizo Clams... the white wine chorizo sauce for dipping bread is magic!
-Sparking sangria (fruit-infused for 3-days)
-Pulpo Asado (marinated and grilled ocotpus)

The forego your first trip are:
-Tortilla Espanola (potatoes seemed a bit underdone)

The GF thought the flavors had a recurring theme of tomatoes and garlic, but I thought each dish was pretty dynamic.

The ambiance isn't very intimate, but there was no rush and the service was attentive and knowledgeable.  This is a great place to catch up with friends or family and share small plates of good Spanish tapas with a cold sangria or red wine."}
{"text":"STAY AWAY! This WAS the best restaurant. Service sucks now, we never even got waited on, we had to keep asking the bar back for things. My chocolate martini tasted off, and I've probably had 1000 from there. Possilby sour milk, but who knows since bartender didn't talk to us once even though we sat there for over an hour. Food was so-so, it's gone downhill. It's so sad, this was my favorite restaurant. I was willing to support them through their transistion of closing additional locations and focusing on their main location but they ruined that. I heard they are closing but have to complete their lease so the employees have already checked out."}
{"text":"I guess I can understand where the people are coming from with their bad reviews due to food poisoning, BUT I WILL FOREVER LOVE FIREFLY.

Every time we go to Vegas, we make it a point to come to Firefly for the delicious tapas.  Every little plate we got was full of flavor and amazing taste.  I love the bread they give you with that butter stuff and olives--SSOOOOO GOOOOOD!!!  Love the pork empanadas, patatas bravas, firefly fries, calamari, stuffed peppers, and definitely that red sangria.  Everything had really good flavor and all the ingredients in each dish really complimented each other.  BEST. TAPAS. EVER.  

Service was friendly and nice.  This last time we were at the new location on Paradise.  I feel like it's an improvement from the old location.  It's much bigger and spread out as opposed to being all cramped and stuff.  And more parking!  All in all, good times were had!

I wish it was in LA!!!!"}
{"text":"My friend and I went here for happy hour and had some really great tapas and pretty good sangria. Our server was friendly and attentive, and he helped us pick some really good food. Four regular tapas plates plus dessert was more than enough and the price was pretty dang good. The sangria pitcher was both tasty and generous. We especially recommend the carrots!"}
{"text":"You should definitely come here with a group of people so you can order a variety of stuff.  It was just the two of us so we weren't able to try a whole lot.  I think we were expecting it to be a lot better based on all the good reviews but it was just mediocre for us.  I was disappointed that they were out of the Nutella sandwiches that I was looking forward to.  Anyway, we'll have to come here again with more people."}
{"text":"You will not be disappointed when you hit this tapas place off the strip.  Food and service is outstanding.  I highly recommend to people who are not too hungry and are looking for some snacks and spirits."}
{"text":"Cool ambiance, and always cute ladies here.
Tapas are pretty damn good.
I haven't tried one thing that I didn't like yet however haven't came and been really hungry.
Ribs bomb, Mushroom puff pastry thing delicious and I don't even like mushrooms.
Steak with potatoes and mushrooms good
Drinks are solid."}
{"text":"Food was excellent!  We had a group of four and all of us equally loved our food.  We were, however, extremely disappointed in the service.  We asked to be away from the noise as this was a reunion and the hostess was extremely rude about our request.  The server was not friendly, did not engage in conversation, did not come and check on us nor refill our drinks and we had to request another server to find him to bring us our check.  We will return for the excellent food and prices but hope our next experience with the hostess and wait staff is much better.    Five stars for the food, one for the hostess and waiter we had."}
{"text":"I was here about 2 years ago with a large group of friends and I wasn't impressed by the food at all nor the service. The service was slow and of course with large groups they either forget your order or missed something."}
{"text":"Another wonderful night at firefly. We come to Las Vegas every year for a convention. We came here last year and it was wonderful so we decided to try it again. Our waiter Mario was such a sweetheart. He was super efficient and polite.  The food was wonderful as always. This time one of our plates was a garden vegetable salad with dried cherries and heart of palm. It was fabulous! The roasted dates are always one of those things you just have to get. The manager Eduardo came to our table several times just to make sure everything was alright. It didn't hurt that they we both adorable. Very efficiently run and all the staff are just so nice!Thank you again for a wonderful evening."}
{"text":"I was relatively unimpressed. The food was just mediocre, though the portions were great for sharing amongst the 4 of us. Some of the better dishes we had were the shrimp tempura and the beef and mushroom skewers. The calamari would have been better if they had used the same batter as the tempura. We went at an odd hour, so the place was pretty dead, but it's definitely spacious and would be great if they hosted weekly salsa nights or something, I'm not sure if they already do. The staff are very friendly and you can tell they really want you to have a positive experience. Unfortunately, I don't think I will be returning because there are plenty of other great choices in the vicinity."}
{"text":"Visiting for the weekend and found I Yelp. This place is off the chart good AND a great value. Sat at the adjacent bar to avoid wait. Greg the bartender saw to our every need, his recommendations were all the best and he makes a mean drink. Not fond of Sangria but theirs is the best. Bacon wrapped dates, skewers of fillet and mushroom, mussels, shrimp, lamb..,.,,,  Will always eat her every time I come to Vegas in the future"}
{"text":"Great off the strip tapas restaurant.  Waited over an hour on an early Saturday night but the food was worth it!  Everything we ordered was good (and we practically ordered everything on the menu for a group of 7). Note:  the portions are bigger than traditional tapas servings...we ordered 2 of everything all at once PLUS paella, and we had WAY WAY too much food.  I suggest you order a few at a time.  Unanimous group favorite was the Ahi Tuna Skewers. 

Ordered a pitcher of Blood Orange Mojito (meh) and a pitcher of Red Sangria (yum).  

This is a great place for a fun group outing (as long as you're willing to wait) but don't go here on a first date unless you want to shout at each other the whole night!

We'll be back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"The paradise location was my favorite, now I have one a block away!!! Don't miss happy hour. My fav's here are chorizo clams, manchego fondue, sliders( don't remember if they're filet mignon or Kobe beef,but delicious). For drinks,to die for! passion fruit mojito and for dessert, passion fruit mini cheesecakes. I love everything about this place. It's romantic with your love, and my 8 yr old loves the food and the novelty of everything being in small portions ( bcuz it's a tapas grill.) love love love"}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere and service.  

I had the empanada, warm spinach salad and tomato soup w/ brie sandwich.  Everything was yummy.  My favorite was the empanada which reminded me of Miami.  I also tasted the octopus dish (unsure of what it was called) but it was awesome."}
{"text":"There is a big convention in town and the were busy. Still, we were on time for our reservations but they weren't ready.  Although we waited nearby, they forgot about us until we reminded them. Our table was in the middle of the room and we had trouble holding a conversation because the room was so loud.  We had a long time to wait as the drinks took forever to arrive.

The servers were pleasant and the food arrived quickly.  The dates, albondigas and carrots were pretty good.  The beef salad and fries were okay. The patatas bravas were not crisp and were a bummer."}
{"text":"Reserved a table for 4pm on Friday for a 5 Star Happy.hiccup.Happy.hiccup.Happy.hiccup hour %)... 

This place gets lively and crowded full of working class citizens after a long day of work... teachers gossiping like hens couped up in a hen house... business teams having their little powwows.  There's all types. 

All the tapas we ordered were delicious.  The stuffed dates are a solid choice, and the Camarones a la Diabla is a good pair with a chilled pitcher of sangria. 

It was a hot 110 degrees, so being seated next to the door frequently opening wasn't ideal, but the pitcher of sangria made it all better.  We saw a leathery skinned Clint Eastwood-type guy braving the outdoor seating area with the misters on... quite the brave one."}
{"text":"The tapas were amazing. Good customer service. Food was a lil slow but overall fairly nice"}
{"text":"Food was amazing; superb flavors and presentation. Service was friendly and attentive. Atmosphere was inviting and cosy and modern."}
{"text":"My favorite eating place in Vegas. I usually order the baked scallops with basil or pesto, bacon wrapped red dates, beet salad, petite fillet mignon. Fried calamari, lamb chop, and shrimp diablo are also good, mussels is a little salty for me, white sangria taste better than the red, ask for extra bread to dip the sauce. 

This place never dissapoints me. It's a must have when I'm in Vegas (coming from Los Angeles). Great food, reasonable price, nice ambience although a little bit noisy. Which restaurant is not noisy? People eat, talk, drink, laugh."}
{"text":"What a great restaurant! Decided to try it out and so glad we did! Such s great menu! I love the idea of small plates this way you get to try many different things! Their stuffed dates are too die for! The prices are pretty good too! Looking forward to taking a bunch of people and trying more of their yummy dishes!"}
{"text":"I've tried this place twice now, and both times I've loved it.  The menu is just great with so many tapas to choose from and all of the them priced between 5-8 dollars. Each one is a nice portion for two people, even for three!  Make sure you go here at night so you can get a nice view of the Fremont Experience light show.  This place will become a must, every time you're in Vegas."}
{"text":"The best!  They've worked out all the kinks that were present in the first weeks they opened....back to great food, great service.  The sparkling sangria is a MUST."}
{"text":"OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG!

Yes, I'm living in the past. I hadn't been to Firefly until a couples weeks ago, mostly because I had an bad first experience with tapas and after hearing about all the health violations at the other store I remember giving myself a pat on the back for never touching the place to begin with. 

Everything there was delicious, except the tuna tartare that I tried from Marie T.'s plate which was fishy tasting enough to be sent back. I had the shrimp diablo which was fantastic, and the fries which were possibly the best fries I've ever had. I was thinking I needed to order 3-5 dishes to really fill up, but to my surprise I only ordered 2 and I was stuffed. We also ordered pitchers of sangria which were as phenominal as everyone on Yelp has already mentioned. 

My guy and I live in NLV and there are very few places that we make special trips for, but this is a place I'll be dragging him sometime soon."}
{"text":"The best! A must in Vegas. Great service. Prices.  Food. Options. Love love love 

You wont be disappointed"}
{"text":"Firefly met expectations! I saw it recommended by Food Network. Anyway the two dishes that get my stamp of approval are the Hearts of Palm Crabcakes and Veggie Empanada. Good job Firefly"}
{"text":"Great spot to try out if you're in the strip. They serve small Spanish appetizers (tapas). A little overpriced but they have an amazing ambiance."}
{"text":"THINGS I LOVED

Artichoke Toasts: (hearts, aioli, basil, pepper) I couldn't get enough of these. Definitely do yourself a favor and order yourself a handful...for yourself alone lol Very generous chunk of an artichoke heart on a little soft toast. Really thought the use of a non-toasted piece of bread was genius. 

Stuffed Dates: (bacon-wrapped, smoked almond, red wine reduction, blue cheese) Like candy for adults that kids would probably enjoy too.

Scallop \"Escargots\": (scallops baked in garlic-herb butter) Don't be fooled or worried, depending on how you feel about snails, but there are no escargots in this dish. I believe the name comes from the traditional escargot plate it's served in. Either way, it was delicious. That garlic-herb butter, I must have the recipe. Very balanced, not overly buttery and a beautiful blend of herbs. 

THINGS I LIKED

Baby-back Ribs: (mango BBQ sauce) These ribs are better the next day. Either I coincidently picked the one rib that wasn't off-the-bone tender that night or something else but I thought the flavor was subdued. Not the next day, full of flavor. (Maybe I had so much to eat that my tongue got flavor profile overload?)

Paellea Mixed/Seafood: (shrimp, mussels, clams, calamari, chicken or tilapia, chorizo, and vegetables) We ordered both the mixed and seafood. Only difference is the chicken or tilapia. Honestly, I don't think you'll even notice because it's not like they give you large portions of either meat choice but the paella also was not that great when I ate it at the restaurant but the next day it was a recovering hangover's best friend. I will say, it says it feeds 2-4 but that's if you order this and only this. We ordered thirteen different varieties and multiples of each plate so by the time the paella came out, 40 minutes later, we didn't even finish one paella plate and we had a group of 12. 

Camarones a la diabla: (shrimp, sweet and spicy sauce, grilled bread) Flavor was good but very strong. I would pair it with rice if I could.

Serrano Sliders: (mini burgers with Serrano ham, cabrales blue cheese, crispy onions) Another good drinking/hangover meal.

Sangria: Flavor and wine-full lol

THINGS I WOULD PASS

Tuna Tartare: (marinated ahi tuna, avocado, sesame dresing, taro chips) The tuna was fresh, I'll give them that, but you'll definitely need to add a little citrus juice to kick up the taste. To me, served as-is, it was on the mellow side with the star of the show being the taro chips. I didn't know you could fry taro root.

Steamed Mussels: (steamed in white wine heirloom tomato, garlic, herb butter with Parmesan crostini) I would definitely pass on this dish. A bit lackluster and the mussels are so small. For almost 10 bucks, it was disappointing.

Ham and Cheese Croquetas: (Serrano ham, manchego cheese, aioli) Filler food. You should order something else with more flavor than waste space in your stomach for I say. They weren't bad, just tasted like potatoes. 

Chicken and Chorizo Stuffed Mushrooms: my least favorite order. No flavor, all I could taste was mushroom. Boring zzz

Firefly Fries (parmesan, herbs, aioli) So SALTY. Could not eat more than two but other people liked them."}
{"text":"I still love the food.... But the service is getting progressively worse! Last night we went out with friends and we had a gift card and wanted to pay our half of the bill with it. So we asked the waiter to just split the check between the gift card and the debit card. Well he comes skipping back \"hey guess what you didn't need to split it, the gift card had enough on it for the entire meal!\" Really?!? Idiot! So we explain to him that not what we said and to fix it... He comes back ten minutes later basically telling us the same thing... Umm no I want my money back! It took a total of 35 mins from dropping off the check at the table to leaving! I was so frustrated with this guy! If your servers can't understand basic math like divide by two... Then get out of there! Anyways love the food but the hostess and servers are lacking. Maybe I should just go back to the paradise location!"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed eating here. We were a group of 7 for a bachelorette party and they did a phenomenal job of keeping our table well stocked with food and alcohol. It seems like they were well equipped to deal with a large group and keep everyone happy. There is something for everyone (including people with allergies and vegetarians)."}
{"text":"Firefly was delicious! Usually tapas are a no-go for guys, but my boyfriend seemed to like this place. The portions are fairly generous if each person orders about 2 plates each to share. Here's what was memorable:

Bacon Wrapped Dates: Salty, sweet, juicy and the crunch of the almond inside the date. This was delicious. I could've eaten more of these.

Tuna Tartare: A nice cold dish to contrast with the other things we got. The tuna was in generous chunks and the taro chips were light and crunchy.

Pulpo Asado: Tender octopus. Not overcooked. Full of flavor from the ingredients cooked with it. 

Scallop Escargot: Think of how escargot (snails) are usually served, but with scallops instead. So they're soft without the chew usually expected with escargot. Generously sauced with butter and herbs, it was easy to want to use the complimentary bread to sop up the sauce that remained with these scallops.

Mushroom Tart: This was unexpected, but it's mouth-watering. I thought this might be dry because of the puff pastry, but surprisingly, they were generous with the sauce/mushrooms so it's not savory. 

Making reservations on a Saturday night is a smart move and highly recommended."}
{"text":"Okay the food is good! Not the best I've ever had but it was good. Waiters seemed a little freaked out because I was with my potential sugar daddy. They were still attentive and nice. It seemed pretty average tho. I sat outside in the patio and they had those fans that have mists or whatever. And you know it gets hot in Vegas lmao. But yeah nothing too special to be honest with you guys. 

The salads were good, I'm not a salad girl but I'll f*ck up a salad there for sure. The empanadas have a freaky texture but they're packed with flavor and I know you're asking hey why is this place average tho ..

Listen up it just didn't wow me like I thought it would."}
{"text":"Excellent place for tapas.  Bacon wrapped figs are delicious.  Cool vibe, after hours place to wind down and complain about the shit you had to deal with today..."}
{"text":"Truly impressed. Every single dish was amazingly good and we ordered about 18 different dishes.  Ceviche lamb chops sangria skewers clams mussels sliders and much more.  All desserts were delish as well.  This will be my Vegas stable in the future.  I enjoyed their sangria which is on the sweeter side - comes in red, white, or bubbly and you can get a pitcher if you want.

Price was very reasonable - $5 - $10 per dish.  We spent over $500 at Del Frisco's the previous night and only around $210 at Firefly for more food, more drinks, and more fun.

We got there around 6:00pm and was fortunate to grab the last 6-seater.  By the time we left around 8:00pm, there was a crazy wait list outside the door.  

If Yelp allows me to give 6 stars, this would be one of the few restaurants that I would give a 6 star!"}
{"text":"Nicely nestled in a small plaza off the Vegas strip is a place that, if not for sites like Yelp, might be regretfully overlooked by Las Vegas visitors. However, it is no secret to residents like me!

Although you will find this gem tightly packed even on any given weekday, it is more than worth it to squeeze your way in to the warmly decorated ambiance that is this little Vegas treasure. Try to get there with time to spare so you can sit outside and admire the lights and energy that make this city great. Not only are you welcomed immediately by the intoxicating smells of the kitchen, but as soon as you get the menu you are reassured that you have come to the right place! Extensive options include the must-try-at-least-once or twice the bacon-wrapped dates, the avocado gazpacho, roasted beet salad w/sherry vinaigrette, mushroom tart (gotta love mushies for this one), and last but not least, the veggie empanada! Do not leave this place without trying the empanada, meat or veggie, either will delight your taste-buds. 

Fast service, pleasant smiles on the servers faces even with a full house of hungry patrons, delicious veggie, meat and seafood options, and an affordable staple (at around $4-$9 a dish) to put on your list for any day of the week. There is no doubt that this is the place to take friends when they come and visit! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Service was great as was the food.  It could have been a little hotter at times but overall a nice change of pace to the normal LV fare."}
{"text":"I. Am. In. Love. With Firefly.

A friend suggested we go to this location after a \"First Friday\" in the arts district. Luckily, my dinner companion is in the know, and somehow finagled us an amazing table with a spectacular view of Fremont Street.

 I can describe my meal here with two words: Sensory Overload. And that's a good thing.

Every item that we ordered was delicious. Bacon Wrapped Dates! Bingo. Stuffed Mushrooms! Bingo. Parmesan Fries! Bingo. Wow, I just won at Bingo three times. I'd say it was one hell of a night. 

One suggestion though. The crispy duck rolls. While they were good, they weren't great. It needed some kick. My friend and I think that Sriracha was the missing ingredient. 

If you see a guy bringing his own rooster sauce, then it's probably me. Come say hi. I'm certain I will be dining here again. And again. And again."}
{"text":"Overall a very terrific place. We went for dinner yesterday (a Tuesday) and it was pretty crowded. Every table had people at it, which is always a good sign. When we arrived, my group of 3 was seated immediately. We each ordered 2 plates per person of tapas. Each tapas plate was unique and served rather promptly. The filet in my opinion was the best. We each got dessert as well, and my only issue with the restaurant was that we each ordered an individual scoop of ice cream. I think the waitress tried to play matchmaker and put 2 of the scoops together in one bowl and another scoop in an individual bowl. This made everyone feel very awkward. Overall though, the atmosphere and experience was pleasant. It was pretty affordable too, it only cost $72 for all 3 of us to eat."}
{"text":"Creatively crafted cuisine @ reasonable prices with great service in a lively yet relaxed atmosphere.  The shopping center location is pretty blase."}
{"text":"I wasn't a big fan of Tapas before, but after having our Bachelorette Dinner at Firefly...I'm hooked like Flies.  Wow...the food was fantastic.  Almost everything we had on the menu was sooo good.  The decor of the place is rather quaint as well.  Such a great hand out place off the strip.  Located right next to Ruth Chris.  Definitely a must visit place when in Vegas.

Pricing, cheap especially compared to Strip prices."}
{"text":"Great service, great food, try the sangria. 
If anyone is considering going it might be best to make a reservation, they're that good. 

Also they have valet."}
{"text":"Hey in life everyone deserves a second chance. 

I remember before moving to Vegas I read an article about a restaurant that received the worst nightmare it could have as an establishment. Like everyone else who searches a business on Yelp, of course we look for the negative or 1 star reviews. Aren't we all entertained by bad press? 

Fast forward my friend randomly took me out the first week I moved here.to a salsa night. The meals that night were pretty fantastic I must say. Loved the Sangria and all was well until my friend mentioned about the history of the restaurant.. then BAMMMM! In my mind I was thinking \"No F*in way this is the restaurant I read about in the paper?!... You bring me HERE!?\" 

Good times. 

Any who, I've been here maybe a handful of times since then and I haven't been disappointed thus far. Most of the time I don't order myself so I can't give any recommendations except for the awesome sangria and comped bread with orange butter. 

There is a latin night on Fridays and it's pretty neat. I prefer the old school salsa dancing and they play a few here and there but it's mostly merengue, cumbia, and latin electronic music (it exists folks). 

I'd definitely go back.. sometimes through failure companies can figure out what went wrong and ensure it doesn't happen again. Business is going well.. so either they got it together or we just love Firefly to not care!"}
{"text":"This place has really gone down hill, I hope they reopen with a better quality and brand."}
{"text":"Our dinner at Firefly happened so quickly.  It seemed like moments after we would order another dish it was at our table.  The restaurant is loud and small and very high energy.  The tapas were of a good size to split four ways and we ordered about 7 or so total.  The sangria was ok, not the best ever.  

I have to say that I have had much better tapas in other cities.  While they were good and I love Spanish food, there was not a single one that stood out to me as outstanding.  I may return on another trip since its nice to get off the strip sometimes and my friends that live in Vegas don't always like going to dinner on the strip. (Not that I blame them at all)   It's a very un \"Vegas\" like experience and more of a \"find this in any city\" kind of experience.  (Just depends on what you're looking for)"}
{"text":"Yes! - that is really all that needs to be said about this place but let me add some color.

First off, I hate Las Vegas and I hate going there.  Secondly, I hate the restaurants on the strip for their pretentiousness, their mediocre food, and for being way overpriced.

This place - just a 10 minute walk off the strip or an even shorter cab drive - is absolutely awesome.  We went there as a group, were seated promptly, and pretty much ate our way through the entire menu.  Every single dish was delicious and not only was this a better dinner than the $45 piece of meat that I got on the strip but it was one of the best dinners I ever had.  Period.  We also had a couple of pitchers of mojitos and deserts afterwards.  The total bill came to $215 for the seven of us.

Awesome food, great atmosphere, friendly & fast service, and no chain smoking gamblers - I will be back!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite local spots here in Vegas great service!
sangria and mojitos are a must please go check this spot out."}
{"text":"Tapas party of 1.  Everything was spectacular: Apple/manchego salad is a really great little salad.  The shrimp ceviche was plentiful and fresh.  The tilapia fried fish with spicy tarter sauch fulfills your fix for fish n' chips.  I can't wait to go back there with a group for HH."}
{"text":"I have been to firefly probably about 10 times in the past few years.  Usually its for the pitchers of sangria and the company of some good friends.  I rarely go there to serve my palate with a delectable array of dishes.  HOWEVER!  This happened, and below is my experience.

First of all, dumb me, did not realize that there was a huge other section of this restaurant.  I only ever sat in the tiny -ass room with the bar.  Yeah, dumb me.  Anyway the main room is nice!

Things you should ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS order at firefly: bacon-wrapped dates, and the sangria.  White or red doesnt matter, you NEED to get the sangria.  It's the best sangria I've ever had.  A pitcher of it will run you $28 or similar.  get it.  Anyway, also get the mushroom and steak skewers, super juicy and well-flavored.

Things to not get:  They have this dish called patatas flavas.  It's diced potatoes covered with some sort of sauce.  I wasn't a fan, it was greasy and the sauce was weird.

I don't think I would go here for an actual meal again, just because those potatoes left a horrible taste in my mouth. I'll probably go to just munch on some delicious dates and drink the...what was it?  Sangria.  OH! I almost forgot that our waiter forgot us.  At least that's what it felt like.  But this place gets poppin' (I can't believe I just typed that) on the weekends so he did get super busy."}
{"text":"I used to give this place 5 stars but it has gone up in price, down in quality.... I would say it is a good deal for LV but only that....given the exorbitant costs of LV this isn't saying much."}
{"text":"Been here a few times with friends .. Loved it in the beginning  until I got sick from the food the last time I was there. I recommend but just be careful."}
{"text":"Great friendly tapas place. Local and tourist alikenenjoy thisbcool place. Friendlynservice from staff, fast service. Great food."}
{"text":"I was on a trip from philly to Vegas and we just saw Motley Crue at the Joint. We wanted something to eat, and wanted to hang out for some drinks as well. Firefly did an outstanding job of serving up both items. Had Lamb Skewers, Calamari, Octopus, and some short ribs....everything was killer....i think we had some other dishes which i can't recall, probably due to the awesome pitcher of sangria that we had.  The Sangria is some of the best that i have had, and it's only 25 bucks...thats 2 beers at a club. 

Back at home I'm wishing that there was a Firefly in Philly."}
{"text":"Nice outside seating area which is covered with mist machines. The service is quick and attentive. The food is excellent with many great options to choose from. And yes, the bar is on point!"}
{"text":"I prefer this location. I guess they have to work harder to earn the love and keep the trust of their Summerlin clientel. Due to the niche location they have more to lose so they cannot be inconsistent with their food or service (like I feel the Paradise location is a hit or miss!). The bacon wrapped dates (stuffed with candied almonds) with blue cheese are TO DIE FOR. That's why I order two because I don't like to share. Tip: Instead getting an order of garlic fries and an order of the filet mignon small plate, a bright idea is to go for the ribeye entree (which comes with a big serving of garlic fries). It comes out to the same price, but the portions are bigger. More to share. (see my ribeye pic). Other than that we got the octopus (I prefer the Paradise locations way of preparing it, it was dry bland and not as fresh as I would have liked or had in the past at the Paradise location). Lastly we ordered the mushroom stuffed chicken chirzo (forgettable). When I go back, I will order three bacon wrapped dates and my ribeye entree ONLY."}
{"text":"Love this place. Good food, fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"Firefly on Paradise

Location/Parking: If I said it's \"on Paradise\" you would probably smack me, so whatever. Google it.

Atmosphere: We saw a bit about Firefly on Paradise on the show Restaurant Stakeout a few months ago and wanted to give it a try. What a find! This is the kind of place you want to spend 3-4 hours at a time, nibbling on small plates of awesome deliciousness and drinking countless glasses (and by glasses I mean bottles) of wine. It's beautifully decorated with dark, bold reds, striking paintings on the walls, eye-catching chandeliers, and a big open dining room with several smaller sectioned off tables for privacy. Great place to meet up with friends or to have a first date. 

Cleanliness: No issues. This place is spotless. The bar is clean, stocked, organized, and well lit. Glasses and silverware are always sparkly and shiny.

Service: Attentive without hovering. You can take your time ordering and no one is rushing you to take your plate away as you nibble. You can linger as long as you want before and after your meal. It's nice.

Food/Drinks: We always get the house Cabernet and it's always delicious. Only $5 a glass and it goes great with pretty much everything on the menu. 

6/6/13 - We had the house Cabernet, Warm Spinach Salad, Chicken & Chorizo Stuffed Mushrooms, and Baked Tilapia cooked with lemon, butter, and garlic. The bread is delicious. Fantastic meal!

11/1/13 - Tried a more expensive Cabernet and it was really nice. Had more bread than I care to mention, Artichoke Hearts, Lamb Chops, Chicken Tinga Empanada, and the Manchego Mac 'n' Cheese. Yummy!

5/29/14 - We had several glasses of the house Cabernet, bread, Chicken Tinga Empanadas, Ham and Cheese Croquetas, Stuffed Dates, and Lamb Chops. Delicious!

5/30/14 - Had the house Cabernet, bread, Roasted Eggplant Cannelloni, Boquerones, Petite Filet, and Serrano Sliders. Outstanding!

5/31/14 - Third night in a row. This is craziness. We had the house Cabernet, bread, Tortilla a la Espanola, Pisto, Camarones al Ajillo, and the Garden Variety Salad. Another winner!

8/4/14 - Came back for our wedding anniversary. Had countless glasses of the house Cabernet, Steak and Mushroom Skewers, Chicken Skewers, Bacon Wrapped Dates, and the Firefly Fries. Tasty! I could come here every night for a week.

Happy Hour: I don't think there is one, but who cares? It's all tapas and it's all cheap, so stop your bitchin'.

Price: Surprisingly reasonable for a place this nice. Anywhere from $5-$10 a plate. Really good quality dishes.

I've been here six times so far and it never gets old. It's forever staying on my short list of places I have to visit in Vegas."}
{"text":"This was as good as the best reviews here. No disappointment ,everything was perfect. We had the bacon wrapped dates, superb, the baked goat cheese, couldn't get enough. The fish sticks, wow. Sangria cool refreshing and tasty."}
{"text":"Amazing. Just, amazing.

We arrived at the end of the lunchtime hours for a late lunch, and I sampled my friends' fries and for myself got an order of shrimp ceviche, and the brie grilled cheese with tomato soup. My friend imbibed on some sangria, but since I was driving home after our meal I skipped the concoction in favor of some coffee.

The food was great. Our server was attentive, right up until the point he disappeared and we later saw him halfway out of uniform, hanging out with some other people at the bar. We had to finally ask another waitress to send over our server, who was indeed a new one. No one had said anything to us about a shift change, and my friends wanted to order more food and I really wanted some more coffee. I am shorting one star for having to flag someone down to get more food and drink refills, but otherwise it was a wonderful experience. The artwork on the walls made for some great atmosphere as well!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to take people in Vegas. They have something everyone can like, and its a lot of fun ordering a bunch of stuff that everyone can try. Great fun and great food."}
{"text":"As I finally get around to writing my review about my favorite place in Vegas. This place was introduced to me about 6 years ago and I make sure I go every time I'm in Vegas.. Not even the food poising outbreak at the old location could stop me lol! We tried going the Friday night when we were in town and it was slammed packed. We went back the next day at about 2 and there were only 4 other parties in there at the time.. I stuck with the same dishes that I normally ordered, but my girlfriend was trying new things. I like the tapas style, bc it allows you to be able to share and try more things at once.

Bacon wrapped dates- these things are worse than a crack addiction, I'm assuming lol.. The bacon and the blue cheese go great with the dates. And it doesn't hurt that the bacon is crispy!

Shrimp ceviche- nice fresh taste, lots of shrimp and flavor. The avocado is always a nice touch.

Menchago mac n cheese- cheese cheese and more cheese. You know it's good when the cheese is still bubbling when it gets to the table.

Stuffed chicken and chorizo mushroom- the mushroom add a great texture, the the flavor of the chicken and the chorizo are on point.

I suggest you try the place out.. It not on the stipe but it's not far at all. Give it a try, I'm sure you will like it

{"text":"Reading all those good reviews, we were hoping not to be disappointed by their food or service... and they proved us how great they were!  This place is now one of my favorite places to eat in Vegas.

It's located off the Strip but don't let that stop you from checking this place out.  It only takes about 5 minutes (or less) from the Strip.

Well, before I go on, let me tell you one disappointment.  They have a website and I've email them directly via their email box on their \"contact us\" page and asked a quick question if they're open on Christmas Day or not which seemed to be completely ignored.  If they cannot reply, they shouldn't even bother to put \"email us\" section...

That's been said, the rest of our Firefly experience was awesome.  Because they do not take reservations for smaller groups on weekends, we had to wait for about 15 minutes or so.  Once we're seated, we were greeted by a friendly waiter and other servers were attentive and helpful too.  

We didn't wait too much for drinks and food.  Red sangria was delicious.  Just between my sister and I, we ordered about 10 items and pretty much everything was yummy.  The best dish was one of their cheapest tapas, bacon wrapped stuffed dates ($4).  It was so good, we ordered another one.  Later we went to a fancy award winning restaurant and ordered their $10 bacon wrapped dates but Firefly's stuffed dates were far better than the fancy pricy restaurant's!  

The only so-so dish was their curry based mussels.  The coconut curry sauce and mussel combination didn't work for us.  However, it came with a couple of garlic toast and dipping it into the sauce was very delicious, so I can't say I didn't like it.  

There are many more dishes and drinks I want to try so I'll definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best tapas joint in Vegas. It is so nice to sit on the patio on a warm (very warm) summer night & drink the delicious sangria or maybe a thirst quenching mojito. Every dish I've ever had here was absolutely perfectly prepared, and I'm sure I've had well over a hundred of them. The service is just as great as well. My only complaint is that over the years they got too popular & were usually on the very crowded side. Although you can avoid this problem by hitting them up for lunch. Cheers to Firefly.
***Lots of ladies like to hang out here. Trust me, my Dad noticed this & he doesn't notice much these days.***"}
{"text":"This is by far one of the best Tapas place we have ever been to!  This place stomps all of the fancy and expensive tapas restaurant.  Firefly  is bustling!  Located about 10 min away from the Strip of Las Vegas, is a gem.  When we arrived, this place was PACKED!  We were very impressed with the service, considering the amount of people they were serving, they were cranking out small dishes very very efficiently.  We noticed a small kitchen with only a few workers, but their efficiency was equivalent to about 10 cooks.  The atmosphere of the restaurant was noisy, dark, yet very inviting.  We were very happy with the prices, everything we ordered was $10 or less, but you are definitely getting loads of flavor and ingredients that is worth more than $10.

We started out with what we thought was the best dish of the night...Anchovy Toast!  The anchovies were delicious...very good quality.  Slightly salty and perfectly paired with creamy avocado, fresh parsley, chewy baguette, and drizzled with a mildly spicy olive oil.

Skewers of spicy chorizo, shrimp, and tender steak.  These skewers were delicious!  All the components were cooked well and nothing was overdone.  This is actually pretty difficult when you have things on a skewer that cooks at different rate.  Kudos to Firefly for doing it right!

Grilled octopus with potatoes were quite tasty.  The octopus was so tender and seasoned well but it didn't cover the sweetness that came from the octopus. 

This was actually surprisingly good!  A chorizo fondue ..wow YUMMY!  This came out pipping hot...the flavor was spicy yet creamy and gooey at the same time.  This was pretty addictive. 

The lamb chops were excellent!  Probably one of the best dish of the night and so affordable.  For $10, we got 2 thick cuts of lamb chops, it cost that much usually just to buy the ingredient if not more.  The lamb had a very good lamb flavor, cooked to medium rare, tender, and very juicy!  We wish we had room to eat another plate =)

This last dish was the lobster escargot.  So this dish is basically a new creation of garlic butter escargot, but instead of the meats being escargot, they made this with lobster nuggets.  This was just as you would imagine...buttery, tantalizing garlic flavor, and savory goodness of the lobster meat.  How can you possibly go wrong?

Overall this was a great FIND!  This is one of the places we would hands down come back for a 2nd, 3rd, or 4th meal.  Firefly has a big menu so you could probably order different dishes every time   This place had speedy and efficient service.  I would say it's not as comfortable to sit in just because this place is always packed and there is not very much elbow room.  The food is amazing and much better than any of the highly priced Tapas places we have eaten before.  We would rate this place a 9 for service, flavor, creative dishes, and affordability."}
{"text":"Mac and cheese is very good. Paella was a bit lacking. Firefly Fries were pretty delicious too. Roasted potatoes were a bit raw for my liking. Sweet n spicy shrimp tasted Chinese. 

I am aware that Rachael Ray has visited here, but despite that fact, the food was actually good. Ill return for mac and cheese from here ANYDAY."}
{"text":"how come this place still open. I will think because the people that come here have never try REAL TAPAS so they don't know the real flavor.This place is really bad. The restaurant sell tapas well let me tell you this  place  is not tapas plus the chef here need to go to Spain to learn how to cook some real tapas.   The paella was really bad no flavor, the sangria no good. No stars from me"}
{"text":"***Firefly is a decent and not too expensive alternative to the many overpriced Las Vegas restaurants on The Strip; unfortunately, there are some mediocre tapas here to go along with their good tapas and service was poor on my visit***

The Strip is filled with overpriced restaurants that churn out mediocre food.  Whether you are going to a fine dining restaurant or a cafe charging fine dining entree prices, chances are you are going to leave the restaurant feeling like you did not get much for your money.  Off The Strip though you will find more local spots and more bang for your buck in good quality and not outrageously pricey restaurants like Lotus of Siam (some may find Lotus of Siam pricey, but it is nothing like the Vegas fine dining spots charging sometimes twice as much as what that restaurant would cost in Los Angeles or other cities).

Firefly is off The Strip and it is a local spot.  It is a longstanding tapas restaurant with a huge following and maybe even a bigger menu.  With the big menu, it is not surprising that some dishes shine while others underwhelm.  Here is the rundown:

(Anchovy toasts with avocado) I liked these toasts.  It was nice having the flavorful anchovy as well as the creaminess from the fresh avocado.

(Bacon wrapped dates stuffed with blue cheese and smoked almond, red wine reduction) The bacon was crispy and the date was sweet and I liked the blue cheese.  The crunchy almond was kind of odd and I did not like the red wine reduction--unnecessary and it kind of made the bacon wrapped dates overly sugary and soggy if you did not pluck the bacon wrapped dates out of the dish as soon as they came out.

(Camarones a la diabla, shrimp, sweet and spicy sauce, grilled bread) The shrimp was nicely cooked and plump and the sauce had a good amount of heat (a little too BBQ sauce-like though)

(Artichoke toasts, aioli, basil, pepper) The artichoke hearts were good--not as good as the anchovy toasts but still satisfying.

(Heirloom tomatoes, burrata, butter lettuce, basil, balsamic vinaigrette) The heirloom tomatoes were surprisingly juicy for not being in season and the burrata was very creamy (almost as good as the more expensive burrata at Mario Batali's B&B Ristorante in The Venetian / Palazzo).  Unfortunately, the butter lettuce was drenched in balsamic, which made this good green into nothing more than decorative garnish for the plate.

(Empanada with pork, red pepper cream cheese and aioli) I am not familiar with empanadas, but I thought these were good.  They have several other types of empanadas available.

(Padron Peppers) These flash-fried peppers had a nice light outside skin and some good heat.  They would be a nice addition to many dishes.

(Chicken and chorizo stuffed mushrooms) A surprising amount of heat.

(Albondigas, meatballs in a sherry and tomato sauce with parmesan) These meatballs were average stuff in a simple tomato sauce.  I would have preferred freshly grated parmesan to the melted parmesan cheese here (which felt like it had been melted a long time ago and had been sitting around for a while).

(Camarones al ajillo, shrimp, lemon and garlic butter sauce) The shrimp were fine, but I thought the lemon, butter and scampi-like sauce was just okay.  Still, it was not too heavy or oily (I think many would like it).

(Steak and mushroom skewers, filet, roasted garlic cream sauce) I thought these were average; the meat was a tad dry.

(Fried calamari) Standard calamari.

Desserts were satisfying.  The caramel flan had a good flavor and the right texture and while the ice cream did not have an incredibly creamy consistency, the portion was generous and the flavors were pretty good (chocolate, vanilla, pistachio).  The chocolate tres leches cake definitely had the expected moistness of a tres leches cake as well as a light chocolate flavor.

Prices were reasonable.  The food was decent and you do not have to pay the outrageous prices that you have to pay on The Strip.

Service was poor.  The staff was pleasant and the food came out at a quick pace, but the staff was not attentive.  After putting in our order, the staff was pretty non-existent so getting drinks and water glasses refilled and receiving the bill took way too long.

Firefly has a dark and loud atmosphere.

Firefly is a good spot if you want a decent meal in Las Vegas but do not want to pay the typical outrageous Vegas prices.  It reminds me a lot of Long Beach's Cafe Sevilla in terms of menu choices and the quality of the food (though that Long Beach restaurant has much better service).

Firefly has its own parking lot (I believe it might be valet parking though)."}
{"text":"Food-wise, this place isn't half bad. I love their mac and cheese and haven't really had a dish I didn't like. However, the service leaves a bit to be desired. It's partly due to the layout, I feel quite crammed in this establishment and the servers are hard to flag down once you get your order in. Nevertheless the atmosphere is nice (dim, good music) and I'd recommend this my friends, if anything for their fries. Yum!"}
{"text":"Great tapas place, they have a large menu including cold tapas, hot tapas, seafood tapas and meat section they also have large plates like the rib eye with large side of Parmesan fries my favorite tapa was the Tierra y mar skewer (surf and turf or combine skewers) with Spanish sausage shrimp and filet mignon with tomatillo sauce on top, pork empanadas are so good and bacon dates are delicious! Serrano ham with cheese and the plate of chorizos is also really good to pair with wine this time I seat at the bar Joaquin Maria and chino took care of me they're really nice their service was quick and they make very good drinks thank you Maria for the recommendations on food thanks Daniel (or chino ) for my old fashioned was on point (bomb bro) and Joaquin I have no words to describe the amazing drink the one you just made for me thank you buddy!   Oh btw it was a drink with mescal, cilantro, bourbon liquor and other secret ingredient"}
{"text":"OMG!  So, my girls and I went last weekend and couldn't stop eating!  Seriously, I think between the 4 of us we ate almost everything on the menu.  I love the local vibe because sometimes, the strip can feel a bit contrived.  Best item on the menu is the bacon wrapped fig.  AWESOME!"}
{"text":"So I'm biased, despite the recent bad press here this will always be my favorite spot. The servers are always pleasant and knowledgable and the blueberry mojitos are on point! We came for happy hour and had a pitcher of blue berry mojitos, stuffed dates, baked tetilla, Serrano sliders, fireflys fries, diablo shrimp, and chicken rings empanadas. The empanada was one sliced in half so it was a small portion but the taste was delicious the pitcher lasted us the whole meal (and it was happy hour 50% off drinks) and our server was Gabriel and he was absolutely amazing I recommend you as for him"}
{"text":"great and more spacious new location on Paradise just feet from the old one.  Great tapas style dining.  Every one of some 10 dishes we tried was very flavorful and well done.  Just order a few at a time so you dont go overboard.  Outdoor area available.  Friendly hostess, waiter and staff.  Will go back."}
{"text":"Great service and even better food. Two kids and three adults and we loved everything with not a single complaint. It's off the strip but not too far and that's kind of a plus anyway! Delicious."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, food, and drinks--the sangria is awesome. A little off the strip and reasonable pricing. Small plates make it fun to try a little of everything. The Thai beef salad and beef and mushroom skewers are always a must.

Definitely a great place to bring friends when they come into town. Always a good time :) Cheers!"}
{"text":"Friendly, fast service and pretty good food. Spare offerings for the price but you pay for ambience."}
{"text":"Very cool spot off the strip for a great brunch, lunch or dinner. The cold tapas plates were my favorite, especially the chorizo meats and the shrimp ceviche. Great selection of beers on tap and a full bar. Added bonus was the band, complete with kettle drum, playing on the patio on Sunday afternoon. Definitely a must-visit!"}
{"text":"LOVE.
Pure deliciousness. What a treat!
We were with a huge group so I think we ordered everything on the menu and everything was incredible. There was nothing I didn't like. What stands out a week later is... the artichoke on crustini, burrata-tomato-lettuce thing, meatballs, and the steak skewers. But really everything was great. Also the SANGRIA is amazing. We were very happy. They also didn't seem to mind that one of our friends was beyond drunk as we all laughed hysterically. Very fun night. 

So sad there's not one in California. 
Boo."}
{"text":"I came here without reservations on a Saturday. It was close to midnight and there was still a 30 minute wait. What recession, right? We checked in at the hostess stand and they were pleasant and said we could wait outside. I'm sure management would cringe that they did not suggest the bar. It didn't matter because we just made our way to the bar anyways to get our pitcher of sangria. We order our pitcher and my friend grabs her drink and took her drink to another open spot. I'm closing out the tab etc. and the guy sitting at the bar pulls the empty chair he's saving and pulls it closer to him and says this seat is taken. I looked at him and said, \"I'm just closing out my tab, is that okay with you?\" That was the end of that...not a peep from Mr. Douchebag. 

So as we got settled at the bar, our table was ready. Awesome. My friend wasn't too hungry, but I was was. The food here is excellent!! 

FOOD 
We ordered: 
Stuffed dates: lived up to the hype. 
Fries: Yummy and perfect to soak up alcohol. 
Filet Mignon Sliders: So good and tasty. It was juicy and seasoned well. 

I am so excited to come back and try the other menu items. 

SERVICE 
The only thing with Firefly is that their service blows. I mean it really blows. They are not rude, but not attentive at all. Waiter comes by to take our order and we never saw him again. I practically had to shoot flares into the air to ask for our check. He's just lucky that I still tipped 20%. 

I would return to Firefly but would warn anyone that I am dining with that we are coming for the food, not for ambiance or the service."}
{"text":"I still don't understand why Cafe Ba Ba Reeba is out of business, makes me sad, so I had to feel a hole in my soul... thank you Firefly for covering my hole... wait, what? 

OK let me start again, I loved Firefly.

The food is really good and also the Sangria.Skip the Salmon and go with the dates, skewers and mushrooms.
The view is obvuioulsy amazing but I kinda miss the TV Screens and Sportcenter, lol."}
{"text":"Nahum,Gabriel and Marco Thank you for Everthing!!! The food was the delicious and the services excellent!!!"}
{"text":"I've been a regular for many years & I enjoy the food & the fun vibe of the place every time I go. Yes parking there isn't the best but I've had worse. It can also get very busy which is annoying but that means it's popular! 
The food is amazing & sharing small plates is always fun. The service this time was excellent! Two hot Latinos, always fun! The pitcher of sangria always gets me tipsy & I try as many things as I can! 
I also want to comment on the usage of the color red here, it's super sexy! 
I wouldn't do a business dinner here because it's always loud but it's great for everything else!"}
{"text":"Go hungry! Everything we tried was amazing. Especially the sangria, stuffed peppers and bacon wrapped dates!"}
{"text":"Gluten free friendly yippee they have a huge menu for us!!! The food is so delicious and it comes out hot!!! The red sangria is the bomb!!!"}
{"text":"From reading most of my restaurant reviews you will notice a trend with me.  I think it's a woman thing to look for an experience and good food and maybe the gentlemen focus more on the food itself.  I have always loved the great music at Firefly and they used to have some pretty cool artwork of flamenco dancers about the restaurant.  So that starts me off on a great mood.

I met up with some Yelp friends after work for happy hour.  By the time I got there, there were two sangria pitchers on the table.  (Thanks Vanessa N.)  I tried the white one since the red is generally traditional and it was very refreshing.  I am not sure the type of wine that was used but I was very happy with it.

Next I ordered tuna tartar and the shrimp diablo.  While I was waiting for my food to arrive, River let me share her fries.  That could have been a mistake because I think I ate probably half of that!  Thanks River!  Those fries are amazing with cheese, parsley and garlic I think on it.  Very addicting.

It's no big secret I have a poke addiction so I guess I have a palate for tuna.  I am sorry to say that the tuna tartar was not good.  It was fishy and old tasting and the color was not right either.  Marie T. ordered the same thing and hers was bad also.  So we sent those back.  I do have to complement management because they did the right thing by sending the manager over and spoke with us about it and offered to remake it for us, but I didn't want to press my luck.  They did take our tunas off the bill so they did the right thing by us on that.  However, I think it would be a good idea to have the chef taste it and check for freshness when you're sending out raw fish like that.

The shrimp diablo though was excellent and it came in a sweet, spicy hot sauce served with some grilled bread.  The extra bread at the table made it easy for others to try the sauce by dipping the bread.  They all seemed to enjoy it as well.

Loren F. let me try a piece of her artichoke bread.  That was very nice too.

All in all I had a really fun time with my friends, I had a nice sangria, the shrimp diablo was very good, the fries were addicting and the artichoke bread were all things I would recommend.    But because of the bad tuna I am giving Firefly a 3 star rating."}
{"text":"Food was great!  Stuffed dates have changed my life!  Service was a little sad.  I had pre arranged a set menu, the wait staff did not seem to be aware of the arrangement.  They rarely came to the table to check on us, we had to track them down for refills and we had to ask for things multiple times."}
{"text":"Firfly is awesome! Always fun atmosphere and always good food!  We came most recently last Thursday and got the same stuff as always... Stuffed Peppers, Diablo Shrimp, Steak and Mushroom Skewers, Apple Manchengo Salad, and the Chicken Empanadas.  Love every single dish!! We also were going to order the Strawberry mojito pitcher but then our server asked us if we wanted to try a mojito that he had recently made up with some coconut rum and strawberry.  It was REALLY good we were glad we took him up on his recommendation!All in all great place and will always come back!"}
{"text":"This place has an amazing Happy Hour! The white sangria is wonderful and the bacon wrapped dates are delicious! Oh and definitely get the tuna tartare! The service is stellar and the prices are pretty great too!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Nice vibe inside, great place to hang out with friends and sample different finger foods. I took my GF here and it was good dining experience. The place can get packed especially thurs-Sat, so the waiter can get a little tied up when having to deal with multiple tables. I prefer to dine in the adjoining area that used to be Dragonfly. Since they have their own kitchen, the food comes out faster and there are less tables, so its more intimate. The firefly fries and calamari are awesome! I've also had the brie, fillet sliders, tiera de mar skewers, and baby back ribs. I'll try the dates next. The sangria is delicious, but I prefer their passion fruit mojito which is very refreshing."}
{"text":"A good friend of mine suggested that my friends and I go here for dinner because of the view and the food. I gotta say, they were BOTH 5 stars!

I had never had tapas before going to Firefly. Please know that I am VEGAN and was able to eat like... 4-5 plates. I could have eaten a ton more, but there's a lot of dishes that are all veggies or can be made vegan very easily if you just ask. My friends had seafood dishes that they said were great as well. Prices are extremely reasonable -- especially for drinks! $5 for a drink in Vegas is about as refreshing as it gets.

The view from where we were sitting was just... wow. Be sure to try to get a table in up in the atrium-type area inside the glass dome! You get the Fremont Street Experience from your seat! If you don't know what that is, Google it. All in all, Firefly is just FULL OF AWESOME. P.S. Try to make reservations!"}
{"text":"The best tapas in vegas, hands down...

Patatas bravas.
camarones al ajillo.
Dates.
Pulpo asado.
Stuffed peppers.
banana nutella, and a pitcher of the best sangria ever!"}
{"text":"Shout out to L.C. for another great suggestion for some savory tapas!

We met up on a Friday night for my first go at Firefly.  Luckily we were seated in a nice comfy booth because the place filled up really fast.  After eating here I knew why.  When dining with my Yelp friend I knew I would be trying a lot of food and stuffed to the gills.  

Upon putting our food order in, the food just seemed to roll out of the kitchen quickly and efficiently.   We started with the Chopped Chicken Salad.  It certainly wasn't the type of salad I was expecting but it was enjoyable.  The salad scoop was surrounded by endive leaves which made for a lovely presentation.  Plus it made a nice chicken salad 'boat' for consumption.  

Next I tried the Stuffed Dates.  Holy Buckets. It was my first time having dates with dreams of having this hot tapas again.  The bacon wrapped date with smoked almost and blue cheese was divine.  Since we were all sharing I couldn't eat the whole dish as much as I would've liked to.

To appease the men at the table, Chicago Beef Bocadillos were before us.  The shaved beef sandwiches were topped with house made giardiniera.  The beef was tender and full of flavor.  The giardiniera just made the sandwich better and earned a thumbs up.

The pork stuff Empanada was also a good choice.  I wish there were more on the plate for sharing like some of the other tapas but we all still had a little taste of hot pastry.  

Of course we can't skip dessert when they offer a Dessert Platter.  Flan, chocolate tres leches, cheesecake and a berry tart make up this delicious sampling of treats.  The chocolate tres leches stood out as the star on this platter.  The cake was soaked in goodness that you just shouldn't pass up.  

Service was ok as our waiter seemed to disappear for lengths of time.  I was guessing because it was a busy Friday evening so I might try another day of the week for my return visit. I left full with a smile.  See you next time!"}
{"text":"After reading the positive reviews, my friend and I were looking forward to tasting everything on their menu.

I was a little surprised they brought out the food so quickly because we ordered a lot of plates.  I don't know if it was an off night for them, but everything on our table was very sub par, including the bread which was dry, cold, and bland.

Very disappointing to say the least and makes me take more into consideration of other reviewers with a grain of salt."}
{"text":"I knew the vibe was bad ass when I walked in the door...Music and people laughing and handsome waiters just taking care of business...It's relaxed loud and if you want GREAT FOOD  and superb service this is that place...The chefs definitely know what to do on seasoning and marinating the meats. Just one small thing and that was the empanadas were really small however they did not disappoint..I will be coming back as a regular..I want to try the entire menu..Thank you for the great attitude and making me and my daughter and son in law feel we were valued!!!"}
{"text":"Food was very average here. The ambience is good. The Tapas were good, the rice wasn't that great. I enjoyed coming here one time."}
{"text":"The food is 5 star, but the service is sub-par. Am I invisible? You're at half capacity!"}
{"text":"Let's see, prices high for what it was. I thought it felt a bit uncomfortable. Might be a ood place for a date because you're not bothered much, but when you need something good luck on getting service when you want it and stuff like that. Their wait staff timing isn't great.

I had the dates, they were good. He Nutella banana sandwiches were also, but that's easy to not make bad or wrong. Good presentation on that too, warm Nutella drizzle. Powdered sugar.

But not much else was good. The duck egg rolld tasted weird. So were the pork dumpling empanadas. Had a weird sauce to them.

The shrimp ceviche was really watery and tasteless. Needed salt and a lot of it.

The firefly fries were okay. Better than the rest but there was a ton of them and they never told me about this and when I took them home, they were soggy and not as great reheated. They had shredded cheese on them and it looked like oregano on top.

It's way over hyped and I was disappointed and at $40 for just me and no alcohol, that's pretty disappointing.

Oh and they didn't charge less for any virgin mojitos, so that's a big bummer there. Being such a small restaurant that looks family owned, (they have like 3 in Vegas now) one would think they would be more accomodating. This isn't Beverly Hills you know, this is Vegas, a city based on hospitality. Not a city of elites and money where you can choose who's worth it or not."}
{"text":"All the food and drinks we ordered were very good.  No need to list them out, 'cuz my list is a just a summary of all the suggested dishes from other reviews.  Thanks to the fellow yelpers for the great recommendations.

The happy hour was kinda weird.  You HAVE to sit in a designated area in order to get the half priced mojito, even if the restaurant is EMPTY.  We didn't know and were seated in the dining area.  When our server told us that we couldn't get happy hour, we suggested to change table and guess what, he then said he could give us the half price.  =)  (But really the whole restaurant was literally empty!!)

Price-wise, simply can't beat it.  Scene-wise, kinda a mixed crowd.  Decor-wise, nothing very special, but quite comfortable.  Service-wise, hmmm.. not bad.  Overall, I enjoyed it and would recommend to others or go back myself the next time I visit Vegas again."}
{"text":"The food is excellent, place is very nice and staff was very good.  It gets busy so make a reservation if possible.  The tapas were great, ceviche was amazing.  Must try, I will come back when I am back in Vegas."}
{"text":"Outstanding!!! Service excellent. Food excellent. 
Had a Mojito pitcher, paella, filet mignon sliders, stuffed mushrooms, bacon wrapped dates, and a bunch of others. All the food was great, and reasonably priced! Must visit when in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I love firefly and it's a great place for girls night or a lively happy hour joint. 

We called to make reservations and we were seated within 2 mins of arriving. The ambience is calm (unless you come on Latin Night) with dark lighting giving it a nice intimate feeling. 

We ordered several different items but like everyone else, the all time favorite is the bacon wrap dates. If I could choose one tapas to have for the rest of my life, it would be these, but I would probably become overweight extremely fast! 

It's a great restaurant considering majority of the items are small allowing you to try more food items at once. They also have larger entrees which are just as good. 

The only downside to this place is parking. Parking is so limited it forces you to valet and sometimes valet is full! Please note a few years ago they were shut down due to health concerns, but I have yet to experience that. Fingers crossed that I never do!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have an arrangement where we alternate who plans Valentine's Day each year. I have even years and it was my turn this year. So, upon doing lots of research, I came across this gem. I have been missing paella like crazy ever since I had the opportunity to study abroad in Spain and wanted to introduce it to my husband since I knew he would love it as well. I am happy to say that I finally found a place that can handle my craving for paella. It was delicious! The atmosphere was amazing as well. We are now seriously considering making this restaurant a Valentine's Day tradition xD"}
{"text":"Great food! We tried the steak and mushroom skewers, the patatas bravos, the shrimp ceviche, the sliders, and the stuffed dates. All were good and surprisingly the dates were our favorite. Also, the best service we have had over the 6 days we were in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Fun place, excellent Tapas place in Las Vegas, Oscar Martinez and Carlos Villanueva are wonderful servers.  What a wonderful evening and service after driving for 8 hours from Bryce Canyon thru Zion National Parks. 
Reasonable prices and excellent food"}
{"text":"Mixed paella was very good. Would've been better if a little crisper. Octopus was tender, eggplant with goat cheese excellent but needed more sauce. Overall one of the best tapas places in Vegas."}
{"text":"Yummy sangria and the bacon wrapped dates are amazing! They have a great happy hour from 3-6pm."}
{"text":"Why is this place so hard to find?!?!?! We drove back and forth and must've passed it like 10 times! Don't know why...it's right there at the edge of the plaza. They need a bigger sign or something because we almost gave up! 

The food was tasty, but if I were to go back, I wouldn't order the same things. 

STUFFED DATES - these were my favorite. Very intensely sweet and salty. I wish there were more! 

MAC N CHEESE - I liked how the mac and cheese was extremely cheesy, however it was too salty. 

FILET MIGNON SLIDERS - the sliders were very yummy! I loved the cream sauce and the onion straws. There were leftover straws on the plate that I just wanted to eat up! I didn't think the \"filet mignon\" was all that special though...tasted like normal burger meat to me!

FRIED CALAMARI - you can't go wrong with these, ever! 

RED WINE SANGRIA - This I did not enjoy. I wanted to see more fruit, I wanted it to be more refreshing. 

I definitely think this is a nice alternative to the typical Vegas buffets, all while getting the same great variety!"}
{"text":"Second time here and it will not be the last. Happy hour is the time to go. Enjoyed all the food. Service was a little distant and I'm still not sure if I enjoyed that or not. The food I did enjoy and the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere, loved the food. The firefly fries are so good, I ended up eating them ALL and it's a huge portion. The chicken empanadas were excellent as well. We got banana Nutella sandwiches and lemon tarts, both great! Although I wish the tarts were bigger. Great, fast service. Fun place to go with a group!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to go when I'm in vegas. Its perfect for a girls night out or a nice date. 

I was weary about coming here at first because someone told me it was mainly shell fish in their food, and I'm allergic, but they were wrong.

I've been here quite a few times, and my favorites are the mac n' cheese, bacon wrapped dates, the duck with plum sauce, the kobe sliders, and the fried bacon cheese balls. 

The sangria is to die for, especially the champagne sangria... Yum.

It can get a bit crowded, but other than that the ambiance is pretty near perfect."}
{"text":"Food was good, but service was aweful!!! The server was impatient, and did not bring what was ordered. She literally sighed when we asked questions about the menu, and said \" we should let her know when we are ready\", without answering any question we asked. 

I won't go back.... Not worth the trouble of crappy parking, bad location, and horrible service! Too bad, potential, but horrible execution."}
{"text":"Wow I'm glad I found this on Yelp.  Not 5 stars because of the one tapas the party of 6 didn't care for.  But a return visit in the future says a lot about this restaurant in a city with infinite restaurant choices.....

I love tapas and this was some of the better tapas I've had in the country.  It's in downtown Vegas and the atmosphere is very Vegas in wow factor but I wouldn't call it elegant.  And I liked that.....

Because the focus was

Food:  Yes, try the stuffed dates and then try not to order a couple of more orders.  They were very good and the first hint that the food is about quality.  Others, stuffed poquillo (sp?) peppers were outstanding and was the top pick for some.  The spicy shrimp was excellent and we ordered a few of those.  The lamb skewer was simply outstanding to a person that doesn't \"love\" lamb.  But I'd get this again in a heartbeat.  Artichoke toasts - my favorite.  Beef sliders were very good.  And more I cannot remember right now.  We got some melted cheese concoction that I forget the name of because........ these are the best sangria's and I had a few by the time we ordered the melted cheese tapas.  Then we ordered the dessert sampler and it was excellent and well done.  We did have one non-tasty tapas and it was the tuna.... egh..... it tasted like cat food.  But the rest of the dishes were awesome and I will return.

Service/atmosphere:  Service was good to very good but not great.  I really don't have a complaint.  The atmosphere was why we chose the downtown location.  A view of the downtown \"arcade\" from this huge glass-ceiling room that was an incredible view of Vegas.  Worth the cab ride for sure.  Think of it as a huge moon-roof on your restaurant.  The rest of the restaurant was shockingly non-Spanish. 

Value:  After being stuffed by the many tapas, plenty of drink and a dessert - I was shocked at the bill and how low it was.  Tapas can add up and be more expensive than many traditional meals in Vegas but this was great quality food at a great price.  Not like some over-priced chef-themed restaurants."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant to go to when in Vegas!!  

I've been to Vegas more times than I can count, and this is my favorite spot around the strip. I know Vegas has some amazing restaurants, and I've been to quite a few nice dinners within all the giant hotels. I am not going to sit here and say that Firefly has better food than every other restaurant. However, when you combine the chic atmosphere, great taste, friendly service, flavorful drinks (sangria, mojitos, martinis) and amazing price this place is by far the best.

I've recommended this place and taken many friends here and everyone has loved it. And most return and take their friends when they visit Vegas again.  
  
Unfortunately, and the only negative is the wait. On Friday and Saturdays they don't take reservations for groups less than 10.  So if you don't mind waiting 30 minutes or more (which I don't if I know it is worth it) then definitely hit up this spot.  You won't regret it.

It's nice being able to step a few miles away from the craziness of the strip and find this gem."}
{"text":"I can't believe I lived out here for almost 6 years and never came here before! Talk about an amazing place to go with a group of friends! We must have ordered 10 things off the menu and every single item was beyond amazing! The sangria, the best I have ever had! It gets very crowded, so come early. The inside gets VERY loud, we sat outside and it was beautiful!"}
{"text":"Everything about this restaurant keeps me coming back. Their dishes are phenomenal! My favorites are the bacon wrapped dates, the lamb chops with lentils dish and a jar of red sangria for endless refills . Also, they turn the outside patio into a salsa dance floor every Friday between 11pm-2am. Go check it out!"}
{"text":"Service is great, drinks are good, food is only ok. Stuffed peppers and dates are the best thing there. However, the entire restaurant smells like an old dish rag. It makes me wonder how clean things are..."}
{"text":"Yum, yum, yum. I want more. Everything we ate was AMAZING. We ordered so many items, I cannot remember them all, but everything was delicious. I do remember the bacon wrapped dates, they were mouth watering!  I highly recommend this place.  Great food, great vibe.  I don't live in Vegas, but when I visit, I MUST go here!"}
{"text":"Edgar Sanchez (manager) knows how to take care of the Las Vegas locals which is rare these days. The suggestions for a combo of flavors was spot on. And our server was fast and efficient.  Definitely return visits are coming, especially for the Sangria.

{"text":"We had tickets to see a show at Westgate and wanted to grab a bite before the show. We had eaten at firefly years ago when they had an anthem location, but had not been back since. Based on yelp reviews, we thought we would give the paradise location a try. When I was about 15 minutes away, I called for reservations but was told that we couldn't get a reservation until 730. Clearly this wouldn't work. I asked about walk-ins. The young woman I spoke with told me I could have a 15 to 20 minute wait. I thought this was worth the chance and so we went. When we got there we found the restaurant nearly empty and had no problem getting a table immediately. Not sure why the hostess was so discouraging on the phone. We decided to order the chicken and mushroom paella ($24) with chorizo (extra$4) despite being warned that would take about 40 minutes to prepare. No problem, I nursed my beer and 40 minutes flew by. The paella was it worth the wait. Could've used a little more chorizo, but that's a minor complaint. Huge portion. More than enough for dinner for two. We've already made plans to return for dinner with friends in about two weeks."}
{"text":"I came in for lunch and sat at the bar since I was on my own. The bartender greeted me immediately and got me a drink. Since it was my first time I asked her for recommendations. Everything she suggested was delicious. I was by myself, so I couldn't get much, because this is a tapas place so it would be better to go with a group, if possible. The three tapas I got were the apple manchego salad, the tuna tartare, and the manchego mac n cheese. Omg! The salad was so refreshing, the tuna tartare was delicious, a little spice and I love that. A little more avocado would have been right up my alley. And the Mac n cheese, total guilty pleasure. You can never go wrong with Mac n cheese. I will be back, soon, to try the other dishes."}
{"text":"I wouldn't say come here to get into a food coma, but the food is certainly good the taste buds. It's good for like lounging with some friends and having a light dinner. The mood is pretty chill. It's pretty much dim inside, talk about blind date. Don't get me wrong cus in simple words, this place is good. And I'm definitely ready to go back. Especially since now they have one in Summerlin :)"}
{"text":"Eh. 

I used to adore this place. If I was able to Yelp Firefly years ago, I would've given it four stars. 

I've been eating at Firefly for over ten years. I brought my boyfriend there last night because I used to love the cozy, intimate atmosphere and great food, and I wanted us to have a cute date night before he flew back East. 

It turns out the restaurant moved (to the old Z Tejas Grill building down the street?), which is a much bigger space. The atmosphere is gone. It's now a busy, loud restaurant like any other place in Las Vegas. I realize that the old Firefly was popular and always packed, so I see the need to expand. They just lost the charm in the process. 

I suggested we order the Serrano sliders, mushroom tart, and Manchego mac and cheese, because I've had them before and they were always great choices on the menu.  I felt like even the quality of food has changed, because I wasn't really impressed by any of the dishes.  

I gave Firefly two stars due to the fact that they changed so drastically, and not in a good way.  The food was not terrible, but it wasn't as flavorful and visually appealing as it was in the past. The mac and cheese was excellent, but the sliders and mushroom tarts were bland.  The chicken empanadas were boring and the lemon tart dessert tasted like mass produced tarts defrosted and topped with a few berries and whipped cream. 

I doubt I'll ever come back here and that makes me sad."}
{"text":"A very good low key Tapas place in Vegas. The good thing is that its not on the strip, which makes parking easy and its not that crowded if you go early. 

They have a very good variety of tapas. We had the ceviche - which was almost perfect, the only complaint was it was an only shrimp ceviche. I usually prefer the whole sea in the ceviche!! The Gazpacho was average. The octopus was very well done, but the star of the meal were the different skewers we ordered. The surf and turn one - with filet, shrimp and chorizo which was excellent. and the Ahi tuna one was even better. The tuna was perfectly grilled and the mix of mango and pineapple with it just hit the spot. 

There are two seating areas and there is also some seating outside which was full. The main area was a little loud especially because of the loud music playing inside. The side section which had the bar was quieter, we just sat at the bar which was probably the ideal thing to do.

Oh almost forgot to mention the Sangria's, we tried the red and sparkling and both were well made. Maybe a little on the fruity side which is why we balanced it with some Vodka shots :)"}
{"text":"What a find (thanks, Yelpers!) This place earns top honors on a multi- week, multi-state trip. Ambitious but reasonably priced selection of a remarkable array of tapas items. Portions generous by tapas standards, and the quality of each dish was outstanding, from ingredients, to preparation, to presentation. This place knows it's stuff and the wait staff is well versed. 2 ridiculously good lamb chops for $12, bacon wrapped dates with blue cheese in a wine reduction sauce for $6.50,  a generous serving of Ahi crusted Tuna for $10, spicy filet mignon salad for $11. We went twice, 4 the first time, 6 the second everything each of us choose off a menu sporting a huge number of mind boggling good things was delicious."}
{"text":"This is one of my new favorite spots in LV.
We went here with a rather large bachelorette party.  I wasn't involved in the planning aspect of the party, but I was involved in the eating!

It took us a little longer than expected to get seated, but with such a large party I could easily overlook it.  The food itself was FABULOUS!  Bacon covered figs?  YUM!  I think I could have had the whole platter if we didn't have more plates coming out.  The beef and mushroom skewers were flavorful and tender.  The 2 shrimp dishes were cooked perfectly.  I preferred the one in the sweet chili sauce.

For dessert, I LOVED the chocolate tres leches.  I'm normally not a big fan, but this was a little piece of heaven.  What a treat!

I'd love to come back and sample their regular menu.  The prices were so reasonable compared to what you get on the strip, and service is definitely delivered with a smile."}
{"text":"We ordered a whole bunch of appetizers to share. There wasn't a single one that I didn't like. Really like their Sangria too. Great place to go with a bunch of friends to drink and try a bit of everything."}
{"text":"My nickname \"the Spaniard\" immediately  gives me the authority to judge this establishment, and with the help of Yelp! I will do my best to do it justice!

First of all... this place is spitting distance from Ruth's Chris Steakhouse. I say that just to involve some perspective on its proximal competition. Despite what the bell boys may say, it is also walking distance from the Renaissance (or the convention center for that matter) if that is a question in any traveler's mind. I will say, however, if you choose to walk for dinner expect a surly backstreet Vegas-style walk down \"Paradise.\"

Firefly, although far from the Spain that I know, is a great dinner spot. It is off the strip, and surprisingly unassuming and unpretentious. We were seated on the patio on a uniquely  warm winter night and remained comfy, but if you actually make reservations I would recommend the inside even though it seemed mucho crowded in the cold weather. 

We ordered 4 Tapas: The stuffed bell peppers, the Serrano ham and Manchego plate, the diablo shrimp, and the pork empanadas. To drink we had a pitcher of Red Sangria. Without any hesitation I will say the tapas were delectable, and I would order them all again... especially the shrimp. The Red Sangria on the other hand was full of ice aka watery and contained no other fruit that I saw other then small apple chunks. We finished off the meal with the flan and the bread pudding, and both desserts were very good. I would highly recommend this place if you are looking for variety of the Spanish persuasion. Great Tapas.

The only downside to this place was the music. It was far too loud on the patio, and it went from a Spanishy Gypsy Kings mix to some bizarre techno mix half way through the night. Not a big fan of that, but it wasn't enough to put a damper on a wonderful evening at the Firefly."}
{"text":"Amazing service from Alejandro!
Bacon wrapped dates, blood orange mojito, green apple salad, tuna tar tar, empanadas all AMAZING!"}
{"text":"This is a really solid value just a few blocks off-strip. I've been here a couple times over the years. The first visit was on the suggestion of a local. Their cocktails are spot-on and available by the pitcher. Their sangria is good without being overly sweet, and their passion fruit mojitos gave us a nice afternoon brunch buzz.

There is a huge selection of tapas and plenty of vegetarian choices which makes it easy for me to dine with a group. The only one I haven't liked is the tortilla espanola. All the others have been quite tasty, especially the empanadas. I would definitely make a repeat visit."}
{"text":"One of my top ten restaurants of all, hands-down.  I will always come back here when visiting Vegas.  Order their mojitos, they're so good.  I also loved the bacon-wrapped dates.
I'm so sad that I haven't been able to find any Tapas places near home that will even compare."}
{"text":"How lucky am I to have a dear friend who is a long time resident of LV?  I'm in town for a few days and she suggested we meet for lunch at Firefly.  Over 50 visits here and I had never before heard of it.

This place is Great!  Indoor and outside seating with a very large variety of food selection which include made to order paella.  Service was very good and the prices are quite reasonable."}
{"text":"Fun place! Joined friends who live here to enjoy tapas....the boys having paellas so it takes awhile. I had 3 tapas: smoked salmon,  albondigas & green salad. Nice variety, but the deal of the night is the Ribeye dinner!!! Wow...14oz!! And the best part, it's $20. Delicious. Nice wait staff and good drinks."}
{"text":"We love this place.  Its a go to every time we visit Vegas.  Love all the food, the service, the sangria.  ZERO complaints.  Wish I was fatter, so I could eat more.  Its very sad when you go here and realize you can't eat anymore and have to surrender.  We have had numerous dishes here and all are great!"}
{"text":"Came to what it used to be my favorite place in Vegas. 
Had go get up and physically go ask for a server to give me water, my food got cold because they brought it all the same time. As I am writing this it's been 20 minutes since I been done eating and no one will get my check. 
Service went down hill here, even from the hostess up front having an attitude about sitting me and my wife down. (They used to be friendly). 

- Update; a manager (seemed like a manager, skinny lady with short hair) came to grab the check and I told her about shitty service and she just ignored it. 


Don't come here ever."}
{"text":"I love Firlefly.. however I must say that I love the one in Summerlin much more.  This location is to small.  I feel almost claustrophobic ."}
{"text":"I have been to many restaurant in Las Vegas, but Firefly I would have to say is one of the few that has made me feel as comfortable and extremely happy with the service. Not only did I love the food, it is the perfect place to come and hang out, relax and be with friends and family at any time. Extremely great service, great food and the prices are not expensive at all. I love this place and will definitely be coming back very soon. Highly recommend it, not only is the food good they also have great drinks and the happy hour is the best!!! You can tell management work hard and love their work place."}
{"text":"I was in town for a convention this week and I had seen a review on TV about Firefly so decided to give it a try. I was in town with 2 chefs (my friends) who I am always a little nervous to go out to dinner with. Chefs can be hard to please because they really know whats up with food. So the pressure was on a bit.....and surprisingly Firefly stood up to the test! There was not one thing we could complain about (OK our server forgot to tell the chef to not put garlic cream on one of the dishes)....well nothing that important anyway. 
The food was delicious, every bite! The Sangria brought me right back to Barcelona where I got drunk for the first time. I love a good Sangria. 
I recommend everything, but the Gazpacho, stuffed Piquillo Peppers and Ahi Skewers were my favorites! 
The atmosphere is great for a date or a party (its gets a tad loud). They play great music and there is a nice romantic red ambiance. 
I loved it and will definitely be back next time I am in Vegas!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in town. I'm a fan of  tapas. I've been here more times than I can count and have never been disappointed. Some of my favorites tapas are the stuffed dates, manchego and apples salad, and the Del Mar skewers. They also have amazing mojitos."}
{"text":"YUMMY YUMMY YUMMY TAPAS!

Chicken Tinga Empanadas must be the food of the gods! Such delicious crispy exterior, flavorful and tender chicken filling. NOTE: a single order is only one empanada.

Manchego Mac n' Cheese is another winner. Ooey gooey cheesy Mac with a crispy top layer. 

SIZING NOTE: this is a tapas joint, so dishes are small. Go for 2-3 dishes per person for a comfortable meal size :)"}
{"text":"So far among all the food joints and eateries I have been to since Sunday in Vegas I would say this definitely would top the list according to the price and taste of the food so far. I would really recommend this place and yes it really gets busy super fast so reservation would be nice but they have a big space so no worries. Food comes fast and great taste too. Trust me I am a vegetarian and we were a big group of 16 with vegan too and abundant options too. The staff are amazing,  friendly, kind, and attentive 
Our server, Alejandro was friendly and patient with our group which wasn't easy it was like herding cats, lol  thumbs up...

Sorry no photos as we were so busy enjoying the food."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since 2012 and I've never been disappointed! I'm so glad this place is open and successful in their business the food is great! So many flavors put into each plate. And oh my gosh the almond butter is to die for ((if any foodies can figure out the recipe please let me know )) anyways this place is great whether you're dressy or casual! Each plate is priced differently so it depends on what you order my friend and I spent 50$ all together for 5 plates :) the camarones a la diabla is so gooooooood and it's not really spicy it actually has a Sezchuan taste to it. Well that's my opinion anyways if you like a sweet chili sauce then you'll love the shrimp  can't wait to be back here soon!"}
{"text":"I ended my birthday food-feast at Firefly.  It was a perfect night filled with good friends, good sangria, and good food! (Well, the little that I tried after stuffing myself all day long.)

The atmosphere of firefly is awesome, inviting, and perfect for a night out with friends! I will have to come back here more. The only food I have to rant about is, of course, the stuffed dates. I've had stuffed dates before, but BOY nothing beats these! Mmm."}
{"text":"Their Sangria was amazing! I tasted both the red and the white Sangria and it is the best that I have had by far. Get a pitcher, it is only $28 and worth every dollar.

Now with the food: I had the tuna tartare, bacon-wrapped stuffed dates, ceviche, sliders, and manchego mac n' cheese. EVERYTHING WAS DELICIOUS. 

The highlights: The tuna tasted a bit like hawaiian poke with avocado and it paired perfectly with the taro chips, I ordered 2 of these plates (they were that good). Everyone talks about the stuffed dates, and they are amazing; perfect blend between savory and sweet with a nice blue cheese kick. The mac n' cheese was so creamy and was not overwhelmingly rich.

Firefly has such a high rating for a reason!"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas. My wife and I have been coming for years.

We arrived in Las Vegas and went straight here for dinner. We had the stuffed mushrooms with chorizo, stuffed dates, manchego cheese / apple cheese salad, ceviche and camarones diablo. All delicious and reasonably priced.

The drinks are refreshing and delicious. I started off with the Passion Fruit Mojito and ended with a Watermelon flavored mojito. Both delicious but entirely different flavors. The passion fruit sour and watermelon sweet.

The waiters and waitresses are very knowledgeable and service was impeccable. Can not wait to come back once visiting Vegas again."}
{"text":"Excellent food. So many different types of  Tapas to choose from.  Your palate will enjoy every bite. I will be back the next  time we visit Vegas."}
{"text":"I love this place!  The tapas were delicious! Each was so tasty. We ordered four tapas and shared (there were three of us) it was enough to feed us all! We will definitely visit again and again!"}
{"text":"Does Firefly need another shining review about how fabulous it is?? No, but I'm going to write one anyways :)  

I've been a fan of this place for years, and love their new Summerlin location because it's so close to my house.  It's always very busy and attracts a young, hip crowd.  Luckily we had a large group when we went last weekend, so we didn't have to wait for a table since they'd let us make a reservation in advance.

They have 3 sangrias on the menu (the white is my favorite!) and at $24 for a pitcher, it's a good deal since you'll easily get 6 glasses out of the pitcher (versus paying by the glass).

The impressive menu is loaded with hot and cold tapas, most of which are perfect for sharing.  The complimentary baguette toasts with almond butter are really good and addictive.  Menu favorites include the firefly fries (loaded with parmesan cheese), the bacon-wrapped dates (a delicious combo of salty and sweet), the baked tetilla (a cheesy baked fondue to dip bread in), the manchego mac n' cheese, albondigas (meatballs in tomato sauce) and the fried calamari.  I wasn't as fond of the tomato bread (it's served cold and I think it'd be way better warm) or veggie empanada (kind of bland).

Service here is usually pretty good and our servers were very attentive and constantly refilling our glasses with our sangria pitches and whatnot.  The food also came out very quickly despite the fact that we had a large group, which was great.

Anyways, if you haven't been to Firefly yet, you have to check it out -- you will be very glad you did! :)"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness gracious!  Aside from Brazilian bbq, never dined at an establishment where you get to have your cake and eat it too.

My wife annoys periodically when she asks what I'm having to share.  Secret alert...  not into sharing.  This place Im good with it.  You order a bunch or appetizer portions and get the best of both worlds.  After that satisfying need was met, the quality of the food was ridiculous.

Amongst 6 people eating, we had the to die for chicken skewers covered in a light, but incredibly tasty garlic sauce.  Mouth still humming!  Eder and team made me feel right at home.

Then we filet, tiara y mar, filet and steak and mushrooms.  We left beyond satisfied and full.  

This place is off the strip in Vegas and proportionally priced reasonable.  Happening place as well!  Good music good vibes.

Coming back next time!!!!!"}
{"text":"this place was grrr-eat! i would definitely recommend it to foodies! they had a nice selection of different tapas...enough to suit picky eaters and food lovers sitting at the same table! the service was great and our waiter made great recommendations. we were visiting from many places, but all agreed that this place was great value and very tasty. sangria pitchers were awesome too! staff did not rush us at all and we really enjoyed our meal. a large percentage of people eating dinner seemed to be locals which is always a great sign. i will return on my next trip to vegas!"}
{"text":"Excellent Tapas Menu. Pretty chill atmosphere. Everything was moderately priced. Thoroughly satisfied. 
Ordered the smoked salmon on toast. Which made me realize my diet is akin to that of a grizzly bear. Anytime I see smoked salmon I order and devour.   Whatever!  Salmon is the shit and is packed with omega 3s. 

Blood Red Mojito hit the spot. Not sure if they used blood red oranges or not, I am inclined to say they did..."}
{"text":"I was in Vegas working a show for about a week and hit up Firefly while there. It was a really cool, chill vibe, hard to find in Vegas. I'm vegetarian and it's sometimes a challenge to find good veg friendly food, but I succeeded admirably at Firefly! 

Things to note:

1) It's in a strip mall, which seems weird, but don't let it sway you.

2) The patatas bravas were #$*#@#-ing amazing.  Probably the best I've had a a tapas joint.

3) The wines are a good pour.

The staff was friendly and nice, I was never in want of water.  Of course we were outside and even being 11pm it was balls hot out.  I had a garden salad too which was good.  I tried the veggie empanada which was okay, nothing to write home about.

All in all Firefly was swell, I will definitely go there again.  Not too far from the strip, we were at the Riviera and I think our cab ride was about 10 bones.  Check it out if you're in Vegas and sick of the nasty buffet food."}
{"text":"I normally don't go off the strip for restaurants so this was the exception. I normally have pretty high expectations for tapas and this place didn't disappoint. We had a ton of different tapas and most were dead on. The tuna tartare was good.The stuffed peppers, albondigas and skewers were all really good. My favorite might have been the artichoke toasts. The sangria was okay and the infused vodka was actually really good. The best part is that I felt like we ate and drank a lot and the final tab was probably 1/2 of what I thought it would be! Great food for great value!"}
{"text":"camarones a la diabla is a must! i literally did not let the server take my plate away...that how much i loved their sauce."}
{"text":"This place is awesome, all finger foods, great for an outing with the friends or family. The chicken skewers, and stuffed dates are to die for and the mango bbq babyback ribs are some of the best ribs I've ever had. Prices are ok, but all in all this is a super enjoyable spot, and I highly recommend."}
{"text":"It's true - this tapas place is glorious.  World class is an understatement.  Price very reasonable.  A must.  We even took a taxi to get her.  Every dish was a delight.  Place was packed for dinner.  Service was phenomenal too - this is a must go to place!"}
{"text":"My sister and I went here to experience something in Vegas with a bit of local flare and we were not disappointed! I too agree that the dates are a must have as well as the sangria! Go here if you want some great food, a good atmosphere and affordable prices!"}
{"text":"Wow.... From the hot thin slices garlic bread to the fiery shrimp Diablo, your taste buds will scream with delight.  The ceviche had large pieces of fish and had the perfect acid balance.  The stuffed bacon wrapped dates are a must order.  Don't forget to order a traditional mojito and a flan for dessert!  Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorites! And being I was introduced by a friend, makes it even more special. Firefly specializes in tapas. Best way I can explain tapas are little plates personal size, of appetizers. It's so fun because you all order different things and you pass around and try. They also have an extensive drink menu...but since my drink of choice is diet coke with lime... I'll leave it at that . Some of my favorite things to try... first and foremost- bacon wrapped dates- seriously , they will change your life! I always order these! Loved the apple slaw salad thing.. The best review I can say is. Don't be afraid to try... get some items that you wouldn't normally eat! There is not a bad thing on this menu!! Also.. get dessert, I'm thinking it was the chocolate tres leches.... amazing!!!"}
{"text":"WOWZA. Every time we come to Vegas, Firefly is our go-to dinner. I'd highly recommend coming here with a group of people, as it makes things more fun with getting to try a little of everything if everyone orders 2-3 tapas a piece. The pitchers of mojitos are a must. Some memorable items not to pass on include the bacon-wrapped dates, the calamari, and the shrimp ceviche. This time we went with the mixed paella, and it was enough to feed 4 people although there were only two of us. The service here is outstanding every time we come. From what I heard this last year was hard for Firefly because of a salmonella issue and scared off a lot of customers. As a veteran industry worker, this was sad to hear, but it happens to everyone, and I can't give enough kudos to the Firefly owner for stepping it up and resolving the issues immediately and moving forward. If I could offer any advice to the restaurant from a customer who just dined at the new location for the first time it would be that my experience was less intimate than at the older location. There is too much bright light in the building, and that needs to be addressed. A big part of why we come is for the intimate low-lit vibe with some gypsy kings on the loudspeaker. This time I was sitting next to the kitchen with a spot-light on me listening to top-40. Still giving you 5 stars because I'm a die-hard fan of the food and service. Get the ambience back and I'll be a lifer."}
{"text":"Everytime I visit Las Vegas I make sure I'll stop by at this restaurant. AMAZING food especially the PAELLA, stuffed dates is one my faves and the skewers. Love their sangria too."}
{"text":"It's hard to find good affordable food in Vegas or a smoke free enviroment. 
- Great Tapas and cocktails at great prices. 
- Smoke free enviroment.
- I've been 3 times, short wait each time, but not bad
- A little noisy, but you can still have a nice conversation
- Look up while waiting in the foyer for some interesting artwork"}
{"text":"MUST GO!

This place makes me regret giving some other places 5 stars.  It's THAT good.
Located off the strip, it's away from the lights and glitz of the Vegas nightlife, however, I guarantee you will have anything but a dull experience here.  Absolutely fantastic.

I am sure that everything on the menu is delicious, but here are a few of my tapas recommendations.

Stuffed dates 
Manchego mac 'n' cheese 
Stuffed peppers 
Steamed mussels
Camarones a la diabla
Steak and mushroom skewers
Filet mignon sliders

For drinks, the blueberry mojito is refreshingly delicious.  We got a whole pitcher and killed it.

I can't emphasize enough how amazing the food is here.  Our waiter was fantastic as well and service is great."}
{"text":"Firefly, this hurts me more than it hurts you.  Trust me on this.

I live in Southern California, so Vegas is like our back yard playground.  For the past few years, I have raved about Firefly; this semi, off-the-strip restaurant that didn't have a celebrity chef's named attached to it that still offered innovative and delicious food.  I would recommend this place to all of my friends and I initially gave them a 5 star review.

But a lot has happened since the first time I fell in love with Firefly.  

(1) The were shut down for Salmonella poisoning
(2) They closed down their first location
(3) Moved to a larger, new location
(4) Food quality went down the toilet

I took my husband to Firefly and all day, I had hyped up this amazing restaurant ... the \"best tapas\" I told him.
Oh man, the disappointment was equivalent to that of a kid finding coal under the tree on Christmas morning.

The food was salty and mediocre. There were some dishes that we didn't want to finish -- and these are tapas, small plates.  

Also, service was sub par.  They appeared to be slammed with guests or under-staffed.  It was difficult to catch the attention of any server and had different people serving us each time. Who was our waiter again?

Honestly, like I said before, I mean it when I say that it hurts me to write this review.  I would love to have Firefly back to the way that it used to be.  Somewhere, after the Salmonella poisoning and the move to their new location, they seemed to have lost their good taste and service.  

There are so many other places to eat in Vegas-- don't waste your time here."}
{"text":"This place was absolutely delicious! I loved everything I ordered especially the mushroom thing! it was soooo good!! Also, the sparkling sangria is really delicious as well.  

My only thing against the place was that every time I go there's a loooooong wait, even when I call ahead. Nonetheless, i'll still continue to go :)"}
{"text":"We went to Firefly on Sahara tonight. It was so amazing!  The service was great. George was our server. All the food was fresh and delicious, and the plates were large enough for 4 people to share each one. We sat outside in  seats in front of the fireplace...it was perfect. We go out to dinner and every Friday night to a different place and we will be going back there next Friday."}
{"text":"I would just like to say that I LOVE THIS RESTAURANT! I discovered it a few years ago and every single time I come to Vegas I make it a priority to come and eat here. I live in Southern California, don't get me wrong, I frequent a few tapas places, but firefly really has it going on! I am obsessed with the bacon wrapped dates, the fantastic chorizo clams, stuffed peppers, MAC n cheese, petite filet is bomb!!!! Even the butter for the bread is amazing!!! I just got back from my bachelorette party out there and I am telling you that even my burbs were delicious after dinner. Haha!!! I can't wait til my next visit to Vegas so I can indulge in all the deliciousness firefly has to offer! To add one more thing... The berry infused vodka drinks they have are tasty and get you smashed! Until next time xoxo"}
{"text":"Beware!!! 

Please note that this is -by far- the one & only one star review among the others (all of them are 5 stars & I don't like to make negative reviews. But this one, deserves it)

We found this place on Yelp and checked their menu. Then we walked there like half an hour. We found out that their actual prices are more than 30% higher! (Some are even more than 40%). We asked why & they blamed it on Yelp that they had no control over changing the prices on the system and offered 10% discount. We just left the place as we didn't like their approach to their customers. Then we found out that we were not the only ones who are misled.

There are lots of quality options in the area with great taste & worth the price."}
{"text":"Let me first begin with 5 stars on service! The most friendly staff ever! Very professional, doting, and incredibly familiar with the menu. But the food was seriously lacking compared to what I was prepared for. We had the ceviche, tune tartare, stuffed dates, octopus, spicy shrimp, and beet salad. Everything was good, but nothing was great or memorable. The words that come to mind are flat and boring. Mind you the ambiance is not included in this discription. The ambiance is very lively and drinking in moderation is not recommended. In a world filled with tapas restaurants this is not the top of my list."}
{"text":"Firefly is ALWAYS a must when in Vegas. I just wish they had HH on the weekends. 
You can never go wrong with the calamari,  steak & mushrooms, ceviche,empanadas....I could go on.
Next time...Im gonna stick it out and wait 40min for the paella!!"}
{"text":"I think I've found a place unique to Vegas -- don't know how true this statement is but it didn't have that chain feel to it.

Located in a strip mall five minutes away from Las Vegas Blvd. (aka The Strip) is this spot that serves some really tasty tapas and refreshing drinks.  The one thing I will mention about the tapas: seafood dishes are good.
Firefly is loud, crowded, and totally fun.  You got folks getting off of work and looking to unwind and chill, groups celebrating b-days, couples enjoying the setting, and a crowded bar with people waiting for the next open table.

The staff is fairly friendly and very accommodating.  They were especially cool about my request for pitchers of caparinias instead of glasses.

The only thing is parking can be sparse since Firefly shares its parking lot with Ruth Chris's -- so be prepared to search.

Overall, local or not, you should give Firefly a try."}
{"text":"Very impressed by their service. We had a big group of 90 and sat in the patio. The staff was amazing ."}
{"text":"Mojito pitchers and yummy tapas!!!!  One of the best bday dinners EVER!!!!  I recommend the bacon-wrapped dates- I was VERY skeptical, but damn... So good!  Don't forget the grilled potatoes!"}
{"text":"Good eats great service and sangria was refreshing...decor a bit outdated but so what?"}
{"text":"Great restaurant with a variety of hot, cold tapas, beverages and a friendly staff.  We had the chicken empanadas,a little spicy kick, but flakey crust and great sauce.  Shrimp ceviche was fresh and tender, lime marinade and fresh herbs was great.  Grilled spicy octopus was tender and smokey with a little kick of spice - yum..sangrias were ok..."}
{"text":"Good tapas, but overpriced for what you get, I think. Friendly bartenders and great mojitos, but too cramped and too loud for my taste (yes, I'm over 40).    And just the fact that this place is so damn popular and trendy annoys the hell out of me.   Glad I tried it, but I probably won't be back unless my friends drag me."}
{"text":"Super awesome atmosphere. Came for lunch on a Saturday and it was pretty empty but the food was great. I had the red sangria which was perfect! I started with amazing gazpacho. So delicious as well as the baked goat cheese. This was much larger than we were anticipating and could feed more than 2 people easily as a starter. We also had the artichoke bread which was delicious and the chicken tika empanadas which were pretty good. The menu is pretty large and I would love to try other options. There was so much so it was difficult to decide what to get! I will be back and can't wait to see what it's like for dinner."}
{"text":"Story Time - My bro and I were in Vegas for 3 days of golf. We asked the concierge at the hotel to recommend a restaurant in Vegas, not necessarily on the strip. He gave us two to pick from. Battistas www.battistaslasvegas.com/ - \"Italian Food\" and Firefly \"Tapas\".   

We navigated to the Strip and ended up closer to Battistas.   The smell of the food was great, but there was no ambiance and having Chablis as the included wine was not working for me.  So, I pulled my brother out of there pronto and we drove to Firefly.

When we arrived at Firely, we walked in to ambiance and vibe.  Yes, this place had a buzz and I knew I had made the right decision.  No wait on a Monday night, yeah.   

Our server was excellent and somehow we merged our picks from the great tapas on the menu for one of the best meals I have ever had.

From memory, the following were our choices.

Heirloom Tomato Salad  -  One of the best salad dressings (the cheese they use in combination with the balsamic dressing was out of this world good).

Risotto Stuffed Peppers - Amazingly simple, but just the kind of Tapas I love.   

Ahi Tuna with Mango on skewers -  If there was a flaw in anything, the mangos were a bit unripe, but it was still really good.

Lamb Chops -  Small lamb chops.  I do not each red meat, so this was for my bro.  But, I am not religious and had a nibble, they were amazing and the sauce was great.

The garlic butter with the bread was so good, I have to mention that too.

The food was so amazing, we came back the next night after playing 36 holes of golf.   We were a solid 40 minute drive away, but the food was so good, we had to come back.  Unfortunately, we tried to broaden the orders and made a few choices that were not as good.  Gary ordered the fried calamari, but in hindsight, it is always good and it was not something that stood out with so many other amazing choices on the menu.   

In any case, if you are in Vegas, you gotta visit this great spot!"}
{"text":"i can't come to vegas and not stop here.  their drinks are amazing and whenever i am not in town, i am dreaming of their excellent mojitos. my favorite is the paradise.  i also enjoy their vast menu selection, their top notch service and the atmosphere.  they have recently expanded and there is even more seating- which has cut down on the wait time."}
{"text":"Firefly has set my standards for a great tapas bar really high! I have yet to find a tapas place in LA with food, atmosphere, and pricing as great as this place! If your going to be on the strip this has got to be one of your stops for a girls night or dinner date trust me everyone will be thanking you later!

Atmosphere is fun and flirty here! Love the accents of red and the lighting, service was also really good- our waitress was very accommodating and despite how busy they were her service stayed considerably great throughout the night. 

Sangria!!!! About every table had a bottle so we knew it was good, we got both the red and white fruit sangria- I preferred the red but both were bomb! I really can't wait to try their Mojitos next time :).

The tapas here are 5 stars worthy and the price just can't be beat!!!! Love that each person can order a few things to try something different. It was perfect for a large group because it ensured that everyone would find something they liked & the tapas style makes people more open to sharing lol. 

Recommend: 
- the mussels in their broth are outstanding, everyone was jealous they missed ordering this one, it's definitely a meal within itself bc you won't be able to resist dunking your bread into it.
- calamari was good, great dipping sauce.
-ahi tuna tartar was fresh & light
_clearly there are so many things on the menu id say almost everything looked worth trying once!"}
{"text":"Sooooo delicious. Try the watermelon mojitos, goat cheese, peppers, paella, tempura, mixed grill, and filet"}
{"text":"What a beautiful place!
Delicious food! Thank you for having vegan options! The staff, especially GM Carlos, was so friendly and accommodating! One of my best experiences in Las Vegas so far!!"}
{"text":"Friends in town? Hitting up the club? Need to get something light in your tummy before going out... come here! Awesome atmosphere... it's sexy is the best way to describe it. The bacon wrapped dates.. get two orders.. trust me! ; ) I love this spot because its just enough food before I go out to the strip or bar somewhere! Plus a chill spot if you just want to kick back with friends and share a bunch of appetizers along with drinks. THE ONE DOWNTOWN HAS THE BEST VIEW OF FREMONT ST."}
{"text":"GOOD SANGRIAS! GOOD TAPAS!

my friends from Vegas took me to a locals spot away from the strip. It was interesting because i never went anywhere outside of the strip before it was like a totally different city..less chaotic it was like a normal city.

 We went on a Wednesday and we had to wait an hour to a hour and a half for a table!  I wanted to go somewhere else but they said it was worth the wait. While we waited we ordered a pitcher of Red Sangria. One pitcher for the four of us and we each got about two cups each. It was a pretty good deal!  i thought the red sangria was just \"okay\" maybe because i am a noob when it comes to drinking wine and i believe the wine they used for the sangria was a dry red wine. 

when we finally got a table i ordered a glass of white sangria, it was sweeter and less dry, it was very delicious! and  it has little apple pieces in  floating on top.  There was also apples in the red sangria but i didn't really pay attention to it because it kind of blended in.i was impressed at the fact the make the sangrias everyday at the restaurant. 

we ordered the ceviche and some kind of carne on a stick? it was well seasoned and it complemented the sangria we were drinking. everything was very delicious 

next time i go to Vegas i am mos def coming back here!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat in Las Vegas!

if i could have my way, i would always be able to order 50 small dishes and nibble on everything while sipping yummy white wine sangria.... i nibble and mix food all the time.  When it comes to food i like options and choices, so while buffets aren't my thing... tapas is always a good idea to me!

This place is always packed and I truly believe it's worth the wait.  The food is good and the service is speedy.  The environment is dark, perfect for hanging out with friends, a date... enjoying good spirits and great food.  There are two parts of this joint.  i think there was a bar or something that went out of business and Firefly bought the place out but never knocked down the wall.  Either side is great and both offer full service bars.

There's a lot of items to choose from on the menu and everything is delicious!
Some of my favorite  items: 
smoked salmon toast
tuna tartare
stuffed dates
ahi tuna skewers
firefy fries
the mac and cheese.... etc.,

there's so much more but.... i'll list the entire menu out if i keep going.

the best thing to do would be to go and try everythng!  bring friends, family, a date... and enjoy the red and white sangia too.... expect a wait!  its a very popular and hip place."}
{"text":"Its a 4 because we really needed a place like this on Freemont. Its in the Plaza hotel so just close your eyes and run through to the restaurant. 

If you like Firefly on Paradise you will love this new one in the Plaza. Same food plus an AMAZING view! The view makes Firefly on Paradise look like a hole in the wall. 

Wish Firefly could have had their own bathroom or at least remodeled the one near the restaurant to fit the firefly motif."}
{"text":"Firefly is quite amazing if I had only one complaint my complaint would be that they serve too much food with each Tapas dish and I couldn't taste as many dishes as I wanted to. While it's true you can't order anything that's bad on the menu there are a few more items that pop out with perfect pitch.  It would be a crime to come to this restaurant and not order the stuff dates. They easily nail the perfect sangria but don't let that stop you from experiencing the infused vodkas. I highly recommend this place bring your friends and have a wonderful time. If I ever make the mistake of getting married again I'm definitely going to have this place cater my wedding"}
{"text":"My cousin that lives in Vegas took my partner and here one day. I was very excited to try a tapas restaurant. I get to try many different dishes because the portions are so small. Every dish we ordered was tasty. The staff here are very friendly."}
{"text":"G
Service was great but the food was mediocre. Had the bacon wrapped dates, beef and mushroom and some beef and sausages. Probably wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"This was the best meal we had when we were in Vegas, hands down. First of all, even if it's 40 degrees out, they let you eat outside (with the big heating units of course). And you can smoke out there, which makes it even better (but not if you don't smoke).

The portions here were huge, definitely bigger than most other tapas places. We went to four different tapas joints in Vegas and this one had the biggest by far.

The \"petite\" filet is a must-try. It's not very petite at all, it's actually similar to the size you'd pay about $30 bucks for at Ruth's Chris. The short ribs were also finger-licking good.

The dates wrapped in bacon were very good, though not my favorite. Ours were a little overcooked. Also, the mac & cheese was delish. We had the fries and the potatoes too, but I've got to tell you.. when you're eating tapas, you need to stick to one starch or you're gonna get full real fast!

The place was totally packed and I was happy to be eating outside where it was much quieter than the hustle and bustle of the chaos inside.

So yup, next to the all-you-can-eat tapas at the Hard Rock, this was my favorite place to eat in Vegas."}
{"text":"Tried this place last night. It was packed and although my friends and I enjoyed all the food overall, there were some serious service snafus. Our server was hurried and not at all on top of it. He should have had some help, as he made a couple of serious mistakes. I ordered a glass of cabernet and my partner asked for chardonnay. Almost every restaurant automatically serve the 'house' or lowest price wine when someone orders a glass of cab etc. Our server did not. He took it upon himself to substitute a glass that was 3 times the price of the house wine (the portion of wine was also very small, like 4 ounces). When the check arrived I tried to find the manager, and a hostess finally foind him outside. He was nice enough  and said he would fix the check. He reduced the  wine portion from $48 to $24, still $4 more than it should have been. Our server managed a poor apology and told me he was too busy and simply made a mistake. Hmmmm. Not buying it. Another note, get rid of the crappy, loud piped in Spanish music and add  some air conditioning,thr restaurant atmosphete made us all want to leave asap. So food 4 stars, service 2 stars."}
{"text":"Great food, cool environment, stays open late, good House Music (Miguel Miggs, Samantha James, Kaskade, Julius Papp, I recognized most of the songs they played). I've been to Firefly twice and have enjoyed their food thoroughly both times.

My friend and I started off with baby back ribs and filet mignon sliders with an additional side order. The portions are small, so if you wanted order a little bit of everything, you could definitely get a stab at a good portion of the menu. A pitcher of Red Sangria was perfect to wash the food down with. We ended the evening with a dessert platter which was excellent! Very easy on the taste buds.. 

The service for the evening was great. Our server was great with his timing and very attentive to our needs... So you're probably wondering why I docked one star? Well.. I know this place is loud.. but certain people were noticebly loud even in such an environment.. There was a guy with a group of his friends, obviously coked out of his mind, screaming obscenities over his cell phone and smacking himself in the face, acting like a primate on speed... I ignored this the whole time, but my friend was obviously extremely bothered by it... We stayed cool about it, cuz we understand there's obviously people who can't handle even being in Vegas without obliterating every part of themselves that make them human... I just wish the staff may have noticed this and at least took the time to tell him to calm down..

So other than poor version of Kid Rock on crack, the rest of the experience was fine. I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants to get a nice, fun, dining experience without having to sacrifice their entire wallet."}
{"text":"Seriously unbelievable.  Not only was the service spectacular, but the food was outrageously delicious.  The chorus of ooos and ahhhs from our party every time a new dish was tasted was almost ridiculous, but it really was THAT good.  There was a sizable wait when we arrived, but we easily found a few seats at the bar.  Definitely a good choice!  Our service was spot on: the bartenders had amazing recommendations for drinks and tapas, and they took great care of us.  

The highlights of our meal were the shrimp diablo, clams with chorizo, chicken tinge empanadas, white sangria, and the apple/manchago salad.  I've never been so impressed by a salad before!  We had a slight hiccup when a bug flew into my glass of sangria, but our bartender wasted no time and replaced our entire pitcher.  Above and beyond!  

A wonderful restaurant, spectacular food, and top-notch service.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Our normal tapas stop in Vegas is Cafe Ba-ba-reeba but we decided to try Firefly based on Yelp reviews and our desire to go \"off-strip\".    The menu is much more extensive at Firefly than Cafe Ba-ba-reeba and very good.   The filet mignon sliders are wonderful!      

That being said, Cafe Ba-ba-reeba is still our favorite for overall tapas experience but we definitely enjoyed our visit to Firefly and would not hesitate to go back again."}
{"text":"Locals know this place and there seems to be a minimum of yahoos in cowboy hats.  Thank goodness that people who stay at Imperial Palace aren't likely to make the trip \"off Strip\" to eat here.  
I've been here several times, at different times of the evening and it always seems to have a wait for a table.  No reservations for small parties - first come first served.  Kitchen put out very good quality small plates.  The menu is extensive and full of very tasty offerings.  I only wish I could order a plate with one of everything because it would take a dozen visits to eat through the menu.  Firefly is a \"must go\" for every trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"Great fun with darn good food.  Night crowd is full of eye candy too!  Good drinks."}
{"text":"it's fun to sit here and chill with the homies.. 
the white wine sangria...  primo!
it's dark... casual.. 

the wait staff is super friendly and the food...

yum.  we had just about EVERYTHING.
share!!!  try a little of everything! 

did i mention the primo white wine sangria.. 
dope."}
{"text":"Firefly on Paradise has been on my to do list for awhile. Even many of my non-Yelper friends had heard of it. There's just so many places to eat in Las Vegas that we never got around to it. Well, this trip we found ourselves staying at the Golden Gate across the street from the Plaza. Our local friend wanted to take us to Firefly on Paradise, but we convinced her to come over and try the new location at the Plaza. A side note: the Plaza and Vegas Club have both recently been cleaned up a bit and are actually pretty neat places to play now. They have both opened party pits and gotten some newer games. Vegas Club has Atari themed slot machines!

Anyways, we show up and are quickly seated in the dome. There are a few other patrons, but it is far from busy. Most of the patrons looked like people who came specifically to eat at Firefly. The restaurant is on the second floor of the Plaza, so they probably don't get too many people who just stumble upon the place. 

We started with eight items to be shared between the four of us. Actually it was more like 5 items since we had 4 orders of the bacon wrapped dates because we each wanted an order to ourselves. They were pretty good, but sweeter than I was expecting. We also had a soup, baked cheese, spicy potatoes, and skewers, They were decent. I found the serving size at Firefly to be a little bigger than other tapas places I have been to. We ended up ordering sliders and clams as well. Overall, I have mixed feelings about the food. I think part of it was due to the hype. Nothing really blew me away. I was also hoping for more Spanish dishes on the menu instead of duck egg rolls, sliders, and mac and cheese.

On the other hand, the sangria was very good. I had the red and the sparkling. I liked the sparkling a little better, but both were great. You could tell that they had been marinating for awhile. Lots of places claim they marinate for days, but you can tell they probably did it that morning. They definitely marinate it for a proper amount of time at Firefly. Service was also very good. 

The Plaza and Vegas Club have been running great hotel promotions lately with rooms as cheap as $19 a night. The casino was busier than I have seen the past few years. Every time I walked by the buffet, it was packed. It is a shame that Firefly does not seem to benefit from the added business. They need to draw in more of the folks passing through the Plaza or staying at one of the other downtown hotels.

We ended up paying $35 each and being only kind of full. We like tapas and knew what we were getting ourselves into, but even then I still feel it is slightly overpriced for what you get which keeps me from giving them a better rating. If not for the sangria and awesome view I might have rated them 3 stars."}
{"text":"I went to a tapas place once before but nothing can compare to the Firefly restaurant. Some friends brought us here because they've been going to this place literally forever. I can see why they love this place so much. 

We went Friday night and it was really busy. Even with reservations we had to wait a good half hour to forty minutes. But the wait was completely worth it once they serve you the food. 

We ordered Bacon-wrapped dates (delish), lobster escargot (OMG), Macaroni and Cheese (better than what mom can make), and sooooo much more. The food was unbelievable and so good. Some friends had sangrias and we all had a really good time.

Service was fantastic as well, as our waiter kept check up on us and offering refills on my soda.
 
The only (and I mean only) disadvantage with this place is if you come by taxi in a large group. It's easy to get there but it is much more difficult with 5 or more people trying to get back by taxi. My friends and I spent a half hour afterwards trying to hail taxis of Paradise Boulevard to no avail. Eventually, a private driver picked us up for double the price because we had no other options.

But if that's not a big deal, then definitely this place is soooo much better than anything you can find on the strip."}
{"text":"Great food in small and very affordable. Atmosphere is relaxing and entertaining.  If you like Sangia,this place the best. I recommend to try everything in the menu. You won 't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The unfortunate truth is that no other location will ever be the same as the Paradise location. The food and atmosphere are just always going to be better there.

Going in, I was kinda prepared for disappointment. My dining experience at the downtown location was quite dismal. However, the food at this location did pretty much hold up. I can't really complain about any of it. 

This location, though, seems to always be packed. It can be hard to find parking. And it gets super loud, making it hard to hold a conversation."}
{"text":"great food.  great service.

Red sangria pitcher and tuna skewers!"}
{"text":"We love tapas and have tried a number of tapas restaurants in Vegas.  This was our favourite - atmosphere is inviting and the food was outstanding!  

We had the eggplant canneloni, chicken and chorizo stuffed mushrooms, pork empanadas, duck roll, mussels,  lamb skewers and the sliders.  All of it was excellent and very fresh.

Go at happy hour (3-6 pm), and all the drinks are half price.

The only downer - The busboys and servers were friendly, but our waitress seemed like she had better things to do.  She did her job, took our order and no further."}
{"text":"Place is totally incredible. Local joint with great cocktails and tapas. Just off strip in comfortable and lively atmosphere. Ceviche, tuna, grilled octopus, papas bravas, petite filet are all excellent every single time."}
{"text":"I decided to try Firefly because there has been so much buzz about the place. So because everything is appetizer size I automatically thought I'd still be hungry so I ordered everything that I thought sounded good which ended up being about 8 plates. I had so much food I thought about \"accidentally\" knocking my plates into the floor so I could stop eating. The raspberry mojito I got was also to die for. The waiter did only come by once every 15 minutes, but none the less this experience was wonderful and I'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Again, one of my favorite meals in vegas.  We had to wait about 40 minutes for a table for two on friday night to get a seat, which is to be expected.  We got about 7 tapas for the two of us.  As many others have stated, get the bacon wrapped stuffed dates, they are very good.  I've been here before and I think I liked the food this time around better.  The other thing with tapas places, I've felt that I'm not getting value for my money typically, but this was $62 including tip for two, and 7 plates and 1 dessert, no drinks (just water).  I thought this was pretty good.  As far as service, it was ok.  I am picky about making sure my drinks are refilled consistently.  I waited a while the first time, and then just asked the server to leave a pitcher of water, so I really didn't have to wait the rest of the meal. Overall, I would recommend checking this place out."}
{"text":"This a great place to meet up with some friends. I went here along with my other friends to celebrate the February Bdays. 
I read the reviews for this place and figured \"why not\" and give this place a shot. What did I have to lose? Some money and not coming back (that being the worst case scenario).
The wait, I wasnt too thrilled with (had a party of 7). We waited for 45 mins. they were within their projected \"wait for a table\" time frame. We got thrown (not really) into the lounge area. Which was likely the most comfortable setting in the place (a lil loud, but the couches were comfy).
I liked the variety of tapas..decent prices, great ambiance..I do have to say that a few people whom were waiting for a table were a \"hot mess\". Lets just say that those were messes, got the party started earlier and hoping to sober up? or perhaps not ? (im thinking not..lol) Technically, they were the entertainment for the night. 
Which is not guaranteed when you visit firefly.haha

I think what made the night was ordering 2 pitchers of Mojitos."}
{"text":"Firefly, BEHOLD: a little dance party in your mouth--refreshing, fun, and just the precise amount to enjoy it all.  From the service to the sangria to the tapas, Firefly does it right. 4.5 stars.

This place is an absolute delight. My friends and I enjoyed ourselves over white sparkling sangria and a ton of small plates. Good food, good drink, good company = good time. In its entirety, Firefly is the perfect Saturday lunch spot for a group of friends looking to enjoy some downtime.

Recommended dishes: Firefly fries, camarones al ajillo, ahi tuna tartare, mushroom and lentils, Serrano ham and manchego cheese, sangria... I could go on but really, I loved everything."}
{"text":"Make your reservation now! This place has spoiled me for food. Everything we ordered was delicious and memorable. This is a foodies paradise."}
{"text":"Super busy when the party arrived but we found out why real soon. Amazing tapas!!!! Definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"my goodness, what an amazing 'off-the-strip' eat. 
I echo my fellow colleagues in saying the bacon wrapped dates are heavenly and the red sangira is absolutely delicious. It gets pretty busy so I would go before 7pm if you don't want to wait to get seated. 

What to order
Bacon Wrapped Dates: If you have a party of 4 or more, I would get 2 orders of these. One will only have you itching for more.  They are fantastic; the perfect combination of sweet and salty
Tierra y Mar skewers: Each skewer has a distinct flavor and is perfectly seasoned. One order is probably enough because you want to be trying all the other wonderful things on this menu!
Lamb Chops: I have died and gone to food heaven. The spices in this dish was incredible and the lamb was so tender.  Even for non-lamb lovers, there is no gamey taste so don't worry!

Highlights
Food, food, food, sangira, food, food
It's SO decently priced!! 4 of us, 7 plates with a pitcher of sangira $100!

Lowlights
I don't really have any. Well, there can be a wait if you go too late ie. after 7:30pm. Also if you are looking for something romantic and intimate, Firefly may be a little noisy for you. You can still have a conversation but if I whispered sweet nothings to my hunny... he wouldn't be able to hear it :)"}
{"text":"This place was above and beyond our expectations! The food was incredible but the service was even more fabulous. They were incredibly accommodating with our special request, and the manager even came out to check on us. We had the fried calamari, delicious and a healthy portion, the croquettes like Amsterdam! The bacon wrapped dates are to die for, the scallops in garlic butter amazing and my Moscow mule was just what the doctor ordered! We even got to try a dessert sampler which was over the top. Highly recommend checking out this place it's delightfully non Vegasy."}
{"text":"First time at Firefly and will definitely be back!  Made reservations for 3 at 6:00pm.  Many people are like \"WTF are tapas?\"  I would define it as: small plates which allows you to order and try many things on the menu.  It's usually good for a group of girls sharing dishes. :)

We ordered:

*Roasted baby beet salad 
[mixed greens, goat cheese, toasted pecans, sherry vinaigrette ]
-YUM!  The vinaigrette went great with the greens and the toasted pecans were almost like candy!

*Chicken salad 
[chopped breast, grapes, smoked almonds, creamy cider dressing, endive]
- delicious!  Just like a classic chicken salad.

*Firefly* fries 
[parmesan, herbs, aioli]
- this was probably the biggest dish we ordered.  The 3 of us couldn't finish it.  It was delicious and the aioli was so good, I wanted it more of it!

*Camarones a la diabla 
[shrimp, spicy chile sauce, grilled bread]
- wasn't too spicy at all, just a tiny bit of heat, which was nice, since it was the only \"spicy\" thing we ordered.  6 shrimp came on the plate.

*Empanada
[pastry stuffed w/roast pork, red pepper, w/salad, aioli]
- really liked the salad.  Only one empanada came on the plate (cut in half), a little dry, but still good.

*(i don't see this on the online menu)
Lobster w/ parm and basil
-it was OK.  That was the only dish that the 3 of us didn't like.

For Dessert:

*Banana-Nutella sandwiches 
[w/Nutella cream dipping sauce]
-can you go wrong with nutella?  no.  'nuff said.

*Chocolate cherry bread pudding 
[warm w/port wine reduction, vanilla ice cream]
-good except for the fact that they use cheap vanilla ice cream and that ruined it for me.

I had a glass of the red sangria, which has a very strong brandy taste, but still good.

We all had a great time!  We left around 8:30pm and the place was PACKED!!!  Which was surprising, because the waitress did not rush us at all, which was really nice.  It was kinda loud in the restaurant, so be forewarned, but not horrible.

I would definitely go back here!"}
{"text":"Very very good! Pitcher of mojito and an array of tapas under the heater on the patio = Perfect date night. We had about 6 different tapas to share and they were all wonderful. My favorites were the stuffed mushrooms, shrimp ceviche, stuffed dates, and thai beef salad. Everything was delicious! I haven't tried the downtown location yet, but it's definitely on my list."}
{"text":"Firefly is the one Vegas restaurant we always make sure to take family and friends that visit.  The food is absolutely incredible, the drinks are great, atmosphere is nice, it's pretty cheap (especially for the quality you get), and it's open late.

My go-to favorites are the tortilla a la española, stuffed peppers, manchego mac 'n' cheese, and petite filet.  The tortilla a la española has just the right amount of spiciness, the stuffed peppers are bursting with flavor, and the mac 'n' cheese is the best I've ever had (and I try the mac 'n' cheese everywhere I go).

For drinks, the blood orange mojito and white sangria are absolute must-haves.

The service has always been great.  

It tends to be pretty empty during the day, but can get quite crowded in the evenings.

And they're great about accommodating large groups."}
{"text":"GUSH GUSH GUSH I LOVE THIS PLACE.

The atmosphere: Art Deco paintings hang in a red and black theme with a flamenco/latin flair.  Also has an outdoor patio out front.  

The people: Locals, \"alternative\" scene, and performers/show people late night.

The food: Tapas, obviously.  Many different things to choose from.  My last visit was with an old friend with a... limited palate, (let's say meat and potatoes kind of person), and it even worked with him.  Even if you're the type who's like, \"Uh, sauce reductions?  Tartar?? Gimme a steak!\" this place WILL work.  

My particular favorites are the tuna tartar (just ask for additional crackers as they give you too few usually), crispy duck wonton, the ceviche, and the roasted eggplant cannelloni stuffed with goat cheese.  

A note about their calamari: There's a mountain of it, so be prepared.

The service is pretty prompt, the lighting is atmospheric, and the DRINKS:  Heck yeah.  Best Sangria in Vegas.  The Sangria served there is prepared a day or two in advance and the taste is fruity and well-rounded without tasting overly sweetened or artificial.   They come in red, white, and sparkling.  A pitcher is more than two drinks for two people, btw, so be prepared.  

Also spazz-worthy are the infused mojitos, which includes my favorite, dragonfruit.  

Open late and has something for everyone.  For a snack or for a fun, romantic evening, it's an excellent choice."}
{"text":"Quality food. The electrician at our hotel recommended Firefly and we ate here twice in 3 days. We ate at Julian Serrano the day before and felt the food at Firefly is just as good and half the price. Avoid the date night crowd by going between lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"If your in need of lunch and your at the convention center and you can't  eat convention food. Walk here, takes 15 minutes as a casual walk. Small plate tapas menu. Sangria is served. Same side of the street as the convention show"}
{"text":"this tapas spot came highly recommended by a co-worker.  i try to support smaller establishments, so we opted to come here instead of the bigger restaurants on the strip.  big mistake.  we had the tuna tartare, thai beef salad, potatas bravas, lamb skewer, and petit filet -- all were a huge let down.  the tuna tartare looked like cat food.  i've never eaten cat food before, but i'm sure this is what cat food tastes like too.  the whole thing was one ill-seasoned heavy, lumpy mess.  i'm on a low sodium diet, and even the tiniest bit of salt is like a little bit of heaven in my mouth.  i tasted no salt at all.  the thai beef salad was okay.  i enjoyed the acidity and flavor that the tuna tartare was so lacking, but it was so oily.  the potatas bravas weren't crispy at all.  the lamb skewer was a tiny little thing, sitting on a bed of mung beans.  i must say that the mung beans were very tasty, although i'm sure they weren't meant to be more enjoyable than the skewer itself.  my husband had the petit fillet, so i can't say anything about that, other than the fact that he said it was \"fine.\"  i had the sparkling sangria.  very good, but not enough to get me to come back here...ever.

the inside of the restaurant was festive.  the waiter did his job.  there was a spanish tv station, interviewing patrons as they ate.  i found this very irritating."}
{"text":"I've never thought to go off the strip for food, but I'm so glad I took the recommendation of a friend and came here. The tuna tartare was AMAZING and the bacon date bites were such a surprising flavor. Definitely definitely coming back here and dragging all my friends off the strip to make a stop."}
{"text":"Traditional tapas dishes with flamenco music and patio dining? Why didn't I come to Firefly sooner?!* Sampled several dishes, was mostly pleased with the flavors and quality. Servers are professional but are assigned far too many tables, and I imagine it only got worse- they were considerably busier by the time we left.

BOQUERONES ($7): 4  tasty toasts with a mix of compatible toppings including anchovies, avocado, roasted red peppers, and a lemony drizzle. Bright and fresh! 
BEET SALAD ($7.50): roasted red and gold beets with vin-dressed greens and pecan crusted goat cheese. Definitely my kind of dish.
STUFFED DATES ($6.5): wayyy too rich for me, but I can see why they're a favorite for others
STUFFED PEPPERS ($8.5): piquillos with mozz and garlic cream cheese, in a tomato sauce with crispy fried and fresh green onions. Think of a classy version of jalapeno poppers, but with a different kind of pepper. Almost too cheesy for me, but good.
PULPO ASADO ($10):  I didn't like this at all.  Potatoes and tomatoes were not enough to save the unappealing octopus. Menu claims it is grilled but seemed boiled or overcooked, unfavorable texture.
ALBONDIGAS ($7): dish of mini meatballs in sherry sauce, basic but successful.
MERGUEZ ($10): two links of spicy lamb sausage with a heap of roasted red peppers and two tiny slices of bread. Sausage and peppers had a good kick to them, but the lack of accompanying bread made it hard to enjoy this dish without chopping it up and rearranging like a stir fry.

Difficult to give a rating: I usually round down but this 3.5 is going up because I definitely want to come back for paella and sangria. 


* Rhetorical question: their negative reputation precedes them, unfortunately. Lots of locals still associate the restaurant with their old (but serious) salmonella outbreak from 2013, but if you look up the stats on SNHD, they've received As on all inspections for nearly two years. It might be time to give them a try again."}
{"text":"Disclaimer:  Please keep in mind that my experience at this spot came after about 6 beers.  

This spot came as a recommendation from a coworker who the Melon and I was with on a business trip.  We walked in and the wait staff was immediately warm and had us seated instantly.  It probably didn't hurt that my man Javier spoke Spanish to them and is an all around funny guy, he had them cracking up the entire dinner.  The manager came over and instantly had us a jug of Sangria on the table.  He didn't even ask us what we wanted, he just asked if we were ok with his suggestions.   I can't tell you what exactly was on the menu, or what exactly was ordered.  It just came.     I do know that I ate lamb, (I hate lamb) and it was tender and delicious.  I also remember having some ceviche that knocked my socks off.  

Singles:  This is absolutely the place to be.  Hotties left and right.  We were stumbling out of here around midnight-thirty and they were still rolling in!  

This place is just a mile or 2 off the strip, and in my opinion totally worth the cab fare."}
{"text":"I couldn't decide how many stars to give. It's a tough call because the food is great and, when split among friends, the prices aren't bad. However, we arrived when the place was packed, I got a shitty chair, our server screwed up our order, and we barely saw his face. I suppose three stars is fair because under better circumstances I'd be swooning for this place. 

To break these elements down... 

Wait- The interior, bar, and patio were completely packed, which caused parking to be extremely limited and the wait for a table to be a bit long. 20 minutes in the cold makes the wait questionable. It was so packed that a woman, presumably a regular, walked up to the door and screamed, \"OH HELLLLLL NOOOOO, this place better not be packed!\" (A minute later she sat on a bench outside, annoyed.)

The seating- My girlfriends are I were seated outside on the patio. The good news was that we were next to a heater, which was much appreciated. The bad news was that our table was pushed up against the glass wall in such a way that I had to do the bendies to squish myself into my chair which, by the way, was lopsided so that I kept smacking into the wall as I ate. We were also right by the door so every time someone walked into the patio my sister got smacked in the back of her seat. In the future, I suggest waiting a little longer for a seat inside the restaurant. 

Our server- Granted, I'm sure he was getting worked, but he gave off a cocky vibe and didn't even write down our order. Amazingly enough most of our items came out... except for one. We got to the end of our meal, ready to order our dessert, and requested that since the last item was clearly not coming that he cancel the order. Instead of cancelling it, he said he'd check on it and if it weren't cooked already, he'd cancel it. We didn't hear about that item until the bill arrived about 20 minutes later and he said, \"Oh. Yeah, so I cancelled that item.\" 

The redeeming quality: The food- Delicious. So much flavor packed into small bites. Our little girlfriends party of 4 scarfed down:

- Smoked Salmon Toasts

- Ceviche
Wonderfully tangy and fresh 

- Tuna Tartare

- Bacon-Wrapped Dates
Ridiculously addictive with a happy almond crunch on the inside 

- Mac and Cheese
Creamy and cheesy and evil and tasty

- Albondigas

- Lamb Skewers w/Lentils

- Chicken and Chorizo Stuffed Mushrooms 

- Thai Beef Salad 
The surprise item and star of the evening. Ridiculously good and large enough for a small meal for one!

- Banana Nutella Sandwich

I didn't get to try the sangria, but I intend to on my next visit to Vegas. I also plan on trying to Happy Hour on for size, with fingers crossed for a better table!"}
{"text":"Great drink selection including wines, great prices and good service!  The filet sliders are beyond awesome!

{"text":"Awesome servers, great padron peppers, sliders, fries, steaks and infused martinis!"}
{"text":"So flippen good I bought a Groupon (if you read my reviews yes i LoVE groupon) for $17,worth $30 yes its a bit pricey for the tapas but that's normal for pretty much any tapas bar but so frkn worth it DELICIOUS!!!!!!! I live in California and I go to a place in Claremont village nope I can't even compare the food. I'm sad I can t be closer but I will for sure visit every time I go to vegas I recommend it .the steak and mushroom skewer's the sh.....everything is good. Great atmosphere very comfortable.
I love the bacon wrapped dates awesome....must try.
oh before I forget amazing service....."}
{"text":"Was not impressed with this place at all. Only reason I'm giving it two stars is because the stuffed dates were okay. I got the empanadas and it came with a single empanada that was cut in half. Not to mention it wasn't even good. The salad was soggy and resembled something you could buy from Walmart or McDonald's. Would not recommend and I'm not sure why it's rated so highly."}
{"text":"We absolutely love this place!  Planning a trip back to Vegas just to eat here.  The bacon wrapped dates are incredible.  The filet mignon is to die for, melts in your mouth. Prices are great, this place is a gem."}
{"text":"This is one of our regular go to spots when we are in Vegas. It is stylish, and even though they say they're Spanish, it is more Latin American Fusion food. The service is on point and the prices are not bad for what you are getting. The Sangria is amazing, and the Tuna Tartar is one the best I have tasted. The Paella is good also, but you really need to make up your mind on that one as soon as you hit the door, since they make it fresh it takes about 20 minutes from order to your table. Will we go back yes!"}
{"text":"The tapas here are amazing, my spouse and I are from out of town and we try to visit Las Vegas in a yearly basis to see family and friends. This is a must go spot for us every time we are in town. The sangria here is to die for. The goat cheese fish was rich and the sauce added the right amount of acidity to cut through the richness. Most plates come with enough to share between 4 people. I recommend this place all the time to friends and family. See you again soon Firefly!"}
{"text":"Just behind the strip is the street Paradise. Along this street sits this restaurant called Firefly. Tapas, Paella, y Sangria plus a lot more. Firefly has become a must visit anytime I'm here in Vegas. The small plates are always my go to. With so many options they have something for everyone. 
I do have a few favorites, \"huevos estrellados\" and \"scallop escargots\" are at the top of my list. I do try new plates when I'm there, the goal to at least try them all once. I'm sure anyone who goes will also have favorites. So take some time off from the strip and enjoy some great food."}
{"text":"A group of us decided to try out Firefly per a recommendation from a friend and we decided to have everyone order one item from the menu to give some variety to the dishes. We made reservations for 7:30 and though the place was crowded we were properly seated when we arrived. Our seat was great in that we had a round table, so that we could all easily converse with each other.  The service wasn't as great as I had expected. It constantly took us a while to get the attention of our waitress and when we got her attention, we had to repeat ourselves several times. Below is a review of the dishes we ordered:

Smoked salmon platter
Ceviche of shrimp - way too watery. probably the worst thing we ordered. there was barely any shrimp and it had almost no taste

Spicy beef salad - Superb! Not very spicy, but never-the-less the flavor was delicious

Steak and mushroom skewers - thought this was too dry and plain for my taste

Crispy duck rolls - definitely a must try. it was perfectly crispy/crunchy and the flavors were amazing. we actually had to order another one because it was so good!

Babyback ribs - i'm not that big of a fan for babyback ribs. The meat was soft, and the sauce was good, but I didn't feel the sauce was infused into the meat. 

Paella - apparently this was pretty good because by the time it was my turn to get some all the seafood was gone haha. For the little that I had, it was slightly oily, but still good

Mango Mojito - their alcohol is pretty strong. I tasted more of the mint than the actual mango"}
{"text":"I do lots of research about restaurants before i hit Vegas. I'll gamble on anything there for the EXCEPTION of where i eat.  Bad meals sour vacations. Having been fortunate to have visited Vegas many times, Firefly is a restaurant that always popped up on list of Vegas favorites, especially by locals.  Never had chance to go, or didn't want to pony up the cab fare and would settle for something on strip.

My wife and i treated a friend who is local  to a show and drinks, and told him we have to go to Firefly after the show for eats.. It was a great move, and a great meal to cap off a great day.

Firefly is happening. Dark, nut not too dark.  Music at just the right volume.  A Younger crowd, but not too young and obnoxious.  Lot of service professionals frequent this place.  It was 11pm on a monday and they were busy.  Thats a testament to what they deliver on here: solid flavor,solid portions, @ great prices.

We started with the bacon wrapped, almond n bleu cheese stuffed grilled dates(5pc).  This is the signature starter of every tapas place on Earth.  Its pretty dam good here.  Not as good as the ones at La Cave (Wynn) but real good.  The Salads we ordered (Garden Variety & Apple Manchego) were great. Fresh. Not small.  But a little overdressed.  Get them dry or ez dressing.

The Firefly Fries are pricey($6) but 3-4 people can share them.  They were a wonderful accompaniment to the Filet Mignon Sliders that came with breaded onion straws.  While i doubt they are ground filet (perhaps could be utility grade), they were hearty, not tiny, and the breaded onions were great.

The chorizo stuffed mushrooms were great, but the star of the show was the Lamb Chops.  Loin cut, cooked medium in a red wine reduction with lentils and julienne cut veggies.  They were tender and had great flavor.  Must have been 3/4' of an inch thick. 2 of them for $8.50. If you know cost of lamb like i do, then you know thats very reasonable.

We passed on dessert. I had a glass of red wine sangria and it was great. Not too sweet.  Sangria @ Todd English's OLIVES= $14  The one i enjoyed at Firefly=$7.

Firefly is worth the trip off the strip and is one of the city's best values with an upbeat atmoshere.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"Awesome sliders, heirloom tomatoes with burata cheese, padron peppers, cod and Spanish red wine!  Server is beyond super friendly and service awesomely fast!  Ask for Alejandro he is the best!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place.  I am probably the only person in the world who does not eat bacon, so I have never tried their bacon wrapped dates...but apparently, they are to die for.  I always get the stuffed piquillo peppers and artichoke toast.  I love the steak and mushroom skewers and veggie empanada,   I had to deny them one star because they changed the way they make their blood orange mojito.  I was told by the manager this was due to to people complaining that it was too sweet.  Well...if you don't like sweet, get a regular mojito.  They made me a new one the \"old way\" but it wasn't the same.  This was a year ago.  And although I have returned several times since, I have not ordered the mojito so not sure if it is still the new and unimproved version.  It would also be nice if happy hour included food too...but their tapas are reasonably priced, regardless."}
{"text":"This was our first experience with a tapas restaurant and we loved it. Food was delicious, staff very friendly and informative, prices reasonable. Can't wait for our next trip to Vegas so we can visit Firefly again."}
{"text":"Ok true story...

I drove all the way to LV (from the OC) w/ my girlfriendsto eat here.  

This place is AMAZING!!!!  Every time I'm in town I have to stop by here & grab something to eat.  Whether it's the manchego mac & cheese, filet mignon sliders, stuffed mushrooms, steak & mushroom skewers, seared ahi skewers, etc....I just gotta have something!  Their sangria's awesome too & their mojitos are muy excellente!

The prices are fair, the music is great, & the food...well it's just so damn good you'd be a fool not to try it."}
{"text":"First, I must start by saying that I love love LOVE the Firefly on Paradise. Being such a Firefly fan, I decided to eat at the Downtown location one night while out on Fremont. 

The place itself is really nice - great room, good ambiance. And the most awesome part is that it is a prime viewing location for the Fremont Street Experience (the canopy light show).

Despite it being a weekend night, we were one of the only tables in the place. And despite being one of the only tables, service was quite slow and inattentive.

The worst part was that my standard Firefly favorites fell short. They weren't the same amazing dishes I experience time and time again at the Firefly on Paradise.

While I love Firefly and really enjoy the view at this location, the difference in food quality is just way too drastic. Despite me ordering my favorite dishes (which I normally devour), I couldn't even finish most of them - they were barely edible.

Hopefully, it was just an off-night."}
{"text":"I still like the original Firefly best. But alas, they moved on to another Paradise location, pretty much next door to where the original was. Sure, it's bigger and newer. But it's just not the same. The prices have dramatically increase over the years. Most tapas have gone up $2-$3.50 each. So it's no longer as cheap as it once was. But nonetheless, it's still a decent cost-quality trade off. So, in other words, the food is tasty and the prices ain't bad (even if they are steeper than they used to be).

And while I miss the old place, I do have to admit this newer version is quite nice. It's just intimate enough, just dark enough, just decorated enough, etc. And the bar area is huge and really nice space. Fair warning: Happy hour can make the bar area quite crowded. I also really like the patio area too.

The service we experienced here was fabulous. Very attentive and friendly.

The menu has just so many good items. The flavored mojitos and sangrias are all amazing. And I've never had a bad or even so-so tapa here. The stuffed peppers and mac 'n' cheese will forever be personal favorites. And then there's the steak and mushrooms skewers, the petite filet, the shrimp, the mussels, the gazpacho, the dates, the meatballs... It's all good eats.

So yeah, it's still a top Vegas restaurant for me."}
{"text":"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this place and the BACON WRAPPED DATES!! They are the best creation ever. It sounded disgusting but my friend made me have one and I'm so glad I did! 

The West Sahara location can get very busy. I first went on a Friday night around 7pm and had to wait for over an hour, but I didn't care, it was my birthday and I wanted to eat here. The bar was also crowded around this time so we sat outside. The hostess asked for our phone number and called us when the table was ready. 

Our server was ok, he was slow and didnt come over and ask if we wanted more drinks. We ended up going again last month and got the same server and the same bad service. They bring out the food at all different times. My husband and I ended up getting all of our food before my friends got any of theirs. So they had to sit there and watch us eat.

I still love this place and we will keep going back for sure!"}
{"text":"We did not wait 40 minutes for paella. We waited only 35. Anyway, I enjoyed it and left with a big round belly. Definitely not for four, maybe three, considering the paella were actually finished by two of us. :) The only complaint I have is the noise level. We could barely hear each other across the small table. What can you say? Happy crowd."}
{"text":"Perfect place for tapas!   This appears to be a locals favorite, and I can see why after our visit.  Fun place to sample several moderately priced tapas that are all VERY VERY good + some mighty tasty Sangria.  Superb service.  Added bonus -  B tribe blasting from the speakers!"}
{"text":"This place was great and an incredible value. The tapas were excellent and the menu was extensive. The tapas weren't traditional Spanish tapas (at least as I know them) but everything we had was delicious. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I've been here many times and the food is always excellent! The selection covers a wide range of dishes and the seafood selections in particular are always tasty. The last trip we had the baked goat cheese and three out of four in our party felt it was the best dish of the meal. Both the calamari and octopus were tender and delicate. The chocolate tres leches cake is a can't miss favorite."}
{"text":"Epic fail firefly, epic fail. I have eaten there before and it was much better then this time. I understand that some things are just not anyone's fault or at least out of the restaurants control for example getting your tap lines cleaned in the middle of service so I can't have a second beer during dinner but I could have the first. Out of your control and no big deal. Keep in mind I manage a high seafood restaurant on the strip. I never complain or make a fuss about anything at a restaurant but the next part is inexcusable. The steamed mussels were bad and I don't mean the taste I mean the freshness of the mussels. So we told the server to take them away cause they are not fresh maybe ate four or five mussels from the dish. He takes the mussels away apologized and business as usual which is fine. Until the check comes and you still charge me for the old mussels which if I ate could have made me sick. I mean really I have worked in restaurants for over 10 years and have never seen anything like that anywhere. Wow. But I am still to proud to make a fuss paid my check and left."}
{"text":"Was a solid place to get some great food and drinks. Went in expecting to grab a snack before dinner, walked out with a $80 bill for 2 after devouring 14 plates of food, 3 drinks and desert. Left with full stomach, and couldn't have been happier! 

Food was good, tasty, but not over the top or extremely exciting. There is so many things to choose from it makes it hard to hold back. A local spot that deserves to be visited in Vegas. You'll be missing out if you don't go!"}
{"text":"My BFF is a local in Las Vegas and she brought my BF and I here to eat on one of our recent Vegas trips.... OMG! Why have I not ever been to a Tapas restaurant?? The prices are affordable and the food is delicious. 

You can order anything from calamari to shrimp ceviche to ahi tuna. You NEED to try the Bacon Wrapped Dates!!! TO DIE FOR!!! And if you know me... anything with bacon is good in my book! It's the best mixture of salty and sweet, trust me, I wasn't too sure about it at first, but it's well worth it! They even have a stuffed chorizo mushroom that was yuummie!! 

This is a place you MUST eat and does not compare to anything they have on the strip! And plus it takes a load of the wallet. :)"}
{"text":"Love their food, Sangria is my favorite!! Great service, beautiful people and fun atmosphere!!"}
{"text":"The always busy Firefly has been the site of many dinners over the years. Firefly is always packed and I have never had a bad meal here. Is there better tapas in the world? Yes, of course there is, however for atmosphere, service, location, and consistency this place gets five stars. The crazy thing is that it is reasonably priced as well!! Make a reservation for dinner here and you will simply not be disappointed no matter what the day or time. 
Go late at night and a DJ is usually playing, and the scene gets just a little prettier"}
{"text":"I have had tapas only twice in my life, and both of those times have been in this restaurant. It's SO GOOD! Come in with a group and order lots of little plates to share, along with a pitcher of sangria or two :) I don't remember all the dishes I've had here, but I would recommend ANYTHING on their menu. I seriously think the second time I went here, I just randomly pointed at things on the menu that sounded good, and they all exceeded my high expectations (from the first visit). So yeah, I can't recommend specific dishes because I like them ALL."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and it's a great place with a large group. It's a tapas restaurant so order a variety from the menu and share. I haven't been here with a small group but assuming there's still a bit of a wait since the place is always packed. The times I've been here was with a group of 17-23 girls and both times our group was split up to 2-3  different tables so just expect that...which is fine if that means it'll be a shorter wait, about an hour w/out reservations. Make reservations!!

Favorites: CEVICHE OF SHRIMP, TUNA TARTARE, FIREFLY FRIES, MUSHROOM TART, MANCHAEGO MAC 'N' CHEESE, FIRED CALAMARI, STEAMED CREAMY SAUCE MUSSELS, EMPANADA. 

I heard the FILET MIGNON SLIDERS and BABYBACK RIBS are good...trying that next time! 

It's a reasonable price here so worth the wait. While you're waiting for the food to come out...try their Sangria too!"}
{"text":"I wish I didn't have to drive to this place from the Mandalay Bay so I could have had more sangria!

Arrived in Vegas around 8pm.  Drove over to Firefly where there was only a 10 minute wait for the two of us.  It was a Friday night and it was busy so I was surprised the wait was so short.  Our hostess, server, and bussers were all very nice.  The sangria was so good and pretty strong.  We ordered a handful of tapas as well. 

Mushroom tart - AMAZING.  

Veggie Empanada - Not as good as I hoped it would be.  I wish I had skipped that and ordered another mushroom tart.

Mac 'n' cheese  - Definitely some of the best mac 'n' cheese I've ever had!

Fries - Good but the aioli tasted like nothing :(

I will definitely come back here the next time I'm in Vegas, but I'll be sure to either take a taxi or not be the DD!"}
{"text":"My last visit was unpleasant.  Service was slow and the food did not taste as great as before.  My friend & I both got food poisoning after eating here so I'm very reluctant to come back even though previous meals here were good."}
{"text":"For a spot that boasts good food n hip atmosphere their closing hours are a downer. Who closes at midnight in Vegas. Come on man"}
{"text":"I am so confused about the reviews of this place.  It was quite disappointing.  The bathroom was dirty with mouldings rotting off the wall, the interior was out of the 80's and the food was off, odd and oily.

Finally, service was slow and curt.  Big disappointment on our mostly great recent trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"Went here on a recommendation of a friend and we're so glad we went! Great priced platters and my favorite was the sparkling wine mimosas. We bought a pitcher it w as so good! Great value for what you pay, we received great service and will definitely come back again. My favorite was the shrimp diablas and the bacon wrapped dates!"}
{"text":"Super great food, and service. Free bachelorette shots! Sangria was amazing. Authentic espresso. You can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Very contemporary and good looking restaurant.  Attentive service, and good food,. Not great..But good.  We had the seafood paella, and while it was good it was just ok. I will be back because I really liked the ambience maybe it was an off day?"}
{"text":"Firefly is my one must visit when I am in Vegas.
Last night was no exception - food was 'stop-the-conversation' ridiculously good.
Bacon wrapped dates - just perfect.
Chorizo and Chicken stuffed mushrooms - amazing
Filet and mushroom skewers - grilled perfectly, just wonderful

And as far as value goes, I have taken 6 people to dinner with plenty of Sangria and Mojitos and walked out for around $50 a person and had clients high-fiving each other.

Go to Firefly, you will not regret it."}
{"text":"Stupid good.
This is my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas.
Its not stuffy formal, its not crazy casual and the food is always just amazing.
Bacon wrapped dates in a port wine reduction with blue cheese . . . seriously????
I ate 3 and then felt bad about it so, I asked my friend if he wanted another and at the slightest hesitation I grabbed it . . . sorry, you hesitated.
Great food.
Reasonable prices.
Do yourself a favor and GO!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere not far from Stratosphere hotel. Quintessential tapas menu with thoughtful dishes and nice flavors. Fair prices and good service. Still doesnt top my favorite tapas place in Massachussetts but still a nice experience."}
{"text":"The food is hit or miss.  From all the good reviews I was expecting spectacular, but I got average at best.  I ordered some calamari to go and when I ate it the food was way under-cooked and rubbery.  I called up and left a message, explaining what happened and they offered me a refund, but I declined and told them I would like the calamari again, but this time cooked right.  I cooked up some Fettuccine Alfredo and picked up the calamari and it may have been a little less rubbery, but it was still undercooked and I could not eat it neither time."}
{"text":"Service was fantastic. Food is good, although some details hold it back from being great (some dishes were too salty, others were a little bland or watery)."}
{"text":"All time favorite restaurant in the world! They moved but just a few doors down. Great new spot. Happy hour is to die for! Still have the amazing filet mignon mini burgers but are called Serrano ham sliders. Rico our bar server was very nice funny and helpful with a few tough choices. Haven been here in 5 years because we live in Seattle but cannot wait to come back! Cheers!"}
{"text":"Tapas....appetizers....pupus.....that's the definition.  everything on their menus are like this...tasty small plates and most are between $5-8.  Found out via other Yelpers! recommendations while going to the CES convention.  

About a mile or so off the strip; the parking lot is small so car pool, taxi, or good luck trying out the lot....but it's well worth it.  I had the pork ribs, chicken stuffed mushrooms, bacon wrapped almonds?, beef/mushroom skewers.....

If you are a fan of Sangrias....order a pitcher!

Make reservations or come early! I got there at 6 PM and a line was starting to form."}
{"text":"Best tapas bar I've been to! The food is great, service is on point, and drinks are strong. The tapas menu is extensive and everything we had was so Yummi. Definitely try the shrimp ceviche and manchego mac and cheese!"}
{"text":"Authentic, delicious, and above all affordable tapas off-strip in Las Vegas. We got a table for 10 same day, without any complications, and tried just about every dish. Without fail, they were incredible, and the service was attentive without being intrusive. I'd like to plug their sangria--red is the best, but if you're looking for something a bit sweeter, the white works as well. The only reason this isn't a five-star review is the overpowering peach flavor of their sparkling sangria."}
{"text":"I was surprised to see this new, bigger location. I really like the intimate setting of the previous spot but they did a good job with this one. Obviously, the demand led them to a bigger space, which makes business sense. 

We sat near the bar... they have TV's with sports on, which takes away from the experience in my opinion. Whenever I have had tapas, it's usually an intimate spot with your wine or sangria, your tapas, and your friends. This was almost like tapas in a sports bar!

As for the food, I can't find any reason to complain. I thought the bacon wrapped dates were pretty much dead on. I didn't expect the chicken salad to be as good as it was. The steak skewers were really good and also the empanadas hit the spot. 

Although the setting may not be what it was it is nice to see the quality of the food to be where it always has been and that it didn't disappoint!"}
{"text":"Firefly is a great place, totally deserving of its Yelp rating in my opinion.  We were in Vegas, needed a good place on short notice for drinks and a late/lunch early dinner.  We got there around 4:30 or five, and later it seemed to get much busier, so short notice for a 7 pm reservation probably wouldn't be on.  But it worked out for us.  It was also happy hour, and we could have drank way more at better savings if we were trying to.  As it was, we had a pitcher of mojitos and another of margaritas, and it was all very good.

The food was also really good.  Mac and Cheese was great, as were the ribs, and the lamb skewers (I think thats what it was).  Everything seemed fresh, menu is quite varied, and the food came out really quickly.  It all tasted great.  Ambiance at Firefly was lively, noise was about what you'd expect, but certainly not too noisy.

Bottom line, this is not the typical Vegas experience of pricey food catered to ignorant tourists.  We are foodies, and had a great meal.  Great local spot, and I will for sure recommend this to friends on their way to sin city."}
{"text":"This restaurant has a very hit and trendy environment.  The tapas are very good and the sangria was really yummy.  It was my first time having sparkling wine sangria.  We had the duck egg rolls, the eggplant, the filet mignon sliders, the stuff mushroom, and the tuna tartare.  All were very good.  The only thing I would pass on next time are the sliders.  This place is loud and is great for a late night bite.  The place is crowded but we didn't have to wait at all for a table.  This place seems like the place to be and I swear I saw some famous entertainers at the next table."}
{"text":"Went here with some coworkers two nights ago to unwind and dance, they turn the patio into a dance floor on Friday nights. The music was good, but I didn't like the $10 cover charge, which went to the live singers rupturing my ear drums because they didn't equalize or something.

There were a lot of people and everyone was good at dancing. I just dont think it was worth the cover charge."}
{"text":"Yay, I would recommend that place without any hesitation. We had an amazing evening, sharing tapas and the drinks were good."}
{"text":"Went their last night for the white party and had a great time. A lot of people I haven't seen in a long time. I always order their red sangria and again it's was great. Fast and friendly service at the bar even though it was a very busy night!"}
{"text":"our servers name was carlos he was really nice, it was my first time! really like the calamari and the shrimp tempura :) NEED TO TRY MORE! prob going next week"}
{"text":"I have to admit, but I use to watch rachel ray show and she had this restaurant on her show so I wanted to try it. The place is way off the strip so it mostly all local who goes there. I try and go here every single time I go to visit vegas or at least if i was sober up enought to remember. The place is very cozy with couches to sit on or you can go sit at one of the tables. The food is good and it alway fun to order alot of different plates so you can try alittle of everything. The sangeria is pretty decent and the environment is alot of young adults. If you love tapas then you must try this place out. I have recommended to all of my family and friends who go to vegas."}
{"text":"What can I say bad about my favorite Las Vegas restaurant?  
Oh- it is so busy no one goes there anymore. 
Seriously, make your reservations in advance.  And it is noisy place, mostly due to the fresh Sangria that hoes down like water on a hot day."}
{"text":"I like Firefly regardless of their 2013 Salmonella outbreak. Yes that was horrible, but it's been 2 years. Plus, this is a brand new restaurant and it's time to get over that.

Some friends and I came for dinner one night before seeing a show. We ordered a pitcher of red sangria, which was delicious. It has fresh cut up fruit and brandy, yum yum. It's safe to say I had a nice buzz going on after a couple drinks. Firefly is all tapas, or small plates. These are good for sharing which is why I like going with a group. My favorite thing on the menu is the stuffed dates. They are wrapped in bacon, and stuffed with blue cheese. Fun fact, I don't even like blue cheese, but the combination of these things is AMAZING. Do get these, and thank me later. 

To be honest, I can't remember too much else because that brandy got ya girl feeling randy, or something like that. LoL. If you haven't done so, give this place a shot, I think you will be pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"I LOVE TAPAS. Firefly makes creative and super delicious tapas and one of my friends had been hesistant to make the trip out to Firefly and repented for the rest of the night because the food was sooooo good.  Here's what we ate (groaning and rolling our eyes loudly in delight):

*ceviche of shrimp - I'm not gonna lie, 8.50 for 1/3 cup of ceviche makes me sad, but the flavors were great so I slurped it up.

*tortilla espanola - classic and delicious. if you go to a tapas bar with no tortilla espanola, leave immediately. 

*roasted eggplant cannelloni - ultra-thin slices of eggplant that were lightly charred and stuffed with goat's cheese. what else can I tell you?!

*stuffed peppers - WOW! so simple and yet sooooo decadent. mama loves cheese, garlic and peppers so this was basically my fave.

*manchego mac & cheese - in my mouth please. 

*albondigas - my friends and I all lived in Seville together and have many not-so-fond memories of greasy albondigas, these were a nice surprise but I wouldn't get them again I guess. PTSD or what have you. 

Frankly I wanted to keep eating until the kitchen ran out of food. I would have continued on with the roasted squash soup, the veggie empanada, patatas bravas, artichoke toasts, smoked salmon platter, okay and basically the entire rest of the menu. 

This place isn't as ornate as Boston's Dali, but these tapas are scrumptious and worth a cab ride even if you're just in town to party. Trust me."}
{"text":"Had dinner at Firefly last night. Good energy in the whole place. Waited about 10 min for a table. Waiter came right away and got us started with drinks. I had the Hendricks cucumber martini which was very good. We had about 10 items, all of which were good. Standouts were the chicken skewers, tortilla espanola, shrimp diablo, mac and cheese and firefly fries. Unfortunately they were out of lobster somewhat weren't able to try those dishes. For dessert we chose the fruit tarts and the chocolate tres leches. The tres leches was definitely the better of the two but nothing to write home about. All in it was about $45 per person with a cocktail. It isn't haute cuisine but the ingredients are good, dishes well executed and the hot food hot, cold food cold. Service was friendly and a little rough around the edges but not annoyingly so. We enjoyed the meal and the atmosphere. I would certainly go back. Next time I will be sure to try the sangria."}
{"text":"By far one of my favorite restaurants in town.  If I have not eaten at firefly in a few weeks I start to get cravings! If you want to try something different then the red sangria, which everyone gets, but I prefer the sparkling sangria made with apples and blueberries! Yum! Their mojitos are to die for! If you're a mojito fan, you HAVE to get the mango mojito! In fact you might as well order the pitcher while you're at it bc its that good! Wow! 
What to order:
-Shrimp ceviche OMG- I cant come here and not order this! 
-Stuffed dates-Sounds weird, but a serious party in the mouth! Same as above I will not come to Firefly and not order this! Might as well order 2 while you're at it
-Baked tetilla- Bomb cheese like fondue 
-Tierra y mar skewers- make sure you order it cooked medium
-Empanadas- good and cheap
-Chicken and chorizo stuffed mushrooms- yummy cheesy chicken with a perfect chorizo flavor, not too oily
-Stuffed peppers-sounds cliche but very good.  The peppers are served soft with a delicious mozzarela mixture inside
-Filet- cooked medium with the white wine reduction, perfect and yummy! 
-The beet salad is surprisingly very tasty! (My mom loves beets and wanted to order this which i was a little if-fy about but turned out excellent!)
-The albondigas are ok. There are much tastier things, but if you like meatballs
-The sliders are good, but have a strong flavor
-Firefly fries- Big group=good thing to order. Massive plate of garlic-y fries
-Veggie empanadas-if you love mushrooms
-Did i mention the stuffed dates? 
-Ham and cheese croquetas-I thought they were just ok, but my friend loved them, comparable to a mozzarella stick, sort of
-Calamari-always a classic
-Camarones a la diabla-if you like asian flavors
-Desserts are all bomb
-Caramel flan- excellent!
-Chocolate tres leches! Chocolate twist on the classic! 

So yes if you're wondering I eat here all the time! Especially since I get off at midnight, me and my coworkers LOVE to come here for drinks and apps after work and chill! Awesome!"}
{"text":"It has been quite awhile since I've been to Firefly.. Usually there is a long wait for dinner seating, especially on a weekend, but today I went with a girlfriend for lunch.  Ah, this is the way to do it! No wait, seated right away near the window.  Instead of getting tapas, today I finally tried the paella.  I'm really glad that I did!!! It was absolutely delicious- filled with all kinds of meats, saffron rice, and a huge (dinner sized) portion.  It was $20, which is a little high for lunch, but would have easily cost double that at a restaurant on the Strip.

I had a decent mango mojito (very heavy on the mint), and service was pleasant and brisk.

The AC seemed to be struggling a bit, especially with the bright sunlight streaming through the windows, but the staff lowered the blinds, which helped quite a bit.

I do prefer the W. Sahara location aesthetically, but the original Firefly still is a good choice!"}
{"text":"The tapas are the perfect size. And the variety of options is excellent. We ordered the garden salad, lamb chops, and stuffed dates. Even the kids liked the food (no burgers were ordered!)."}
{"text":"Great value, excellent and interesting food. See Wesley at the bar for a Hendricks and tonic and a shot of Jamo!"}
{"text":"Finally tried this place! So I have had really really good tapas before, per my bf, comparable to south Spain tapas. And I have had bad tapas before. Very very bad tapas. Firefly fits in between the two more so good than bad. We ordered the cheese and Serrano ham plate and for the amount and variety they give you, I think it's priced too high. The paella was good but before we could enjoy the nice crust that had set at the bottom (again, per my bf, this was the best part) the server mixed up everything and the crust was no longer. The other plate we had was the fondue like cheese, it was sweet but subtle and it was ok, with bits of chorizo. Last but not least, there was a white sangria. It reminded me of a Zima and white Zinfandel with small bits of apples. I was not impressed. $90 later plus tip for mediocre service I'm at 3 stars. Off to Jaleo we go next time...."}
{"text":"best food ever in Vegas. You can waste 150USD in a average steakhouse or come 3 times here for delicious food."}
{"text":"Firefly never disappoints. As a matter of fact I think it keeps getting better. It's like a fine wine. The stuffed dates are probably the single greatest thing I've ever eaten. I've since gone vegetarian, so I can no longer partake in those sweet bacon wrapped dreams, but there are still many great vegetarian option for me to enjoy. I haven't often looked back after going vegetarian, but the stuffed dates are definitely one thing I miss."}
{"text":"This was an alright place.  Review is as always only based on the food.  The parking was complimentary.  

Bacon wrapped dates: soaked in sauce and hence made the dish soggy.  Bacon was somehow over cooked and yet the dish came out lukewarm.

Empanadas: pretty heavy and salty.  The sauce on the outside is probably unnecessary as the dish is already flavorful.  The empanadas breaking was cooked well.

Serrano ham sliders:  a little salty as the ham itself is already flavorful.  There is a spicy kick that is offset well by the bleu cheese.  

Chorizo clams: broth is great.  Still  n the salty side but you get some more bread to dip into the broth.  Worth it to just be able to dip the bread.

This was enough food for two people so not bad

3.5 stars: I probably wouldn't come back often but the price and food was fair and service was pretty good from the waiter"}
{"text":"Went here the other night on a date and even though the date was only mediocre the food and drinks were good!  

I started off with the sparkling sangria which was tasty.  We ordered the stuffed dates (can't wait to have again...YUM!), terra y mare skewers (my date really liked those...me not as much), empanadas (delish!), sliders (I didn't try, but he didn't really care for them....yet still ate 2/3 of them), and the shrimp tempura (Yuck!  It definitely didn't seem like tempura...the batter was too thick and the shrimp is usually halved isn't it?!).  

The service was good...she kept checking back with us.  I should have had 3 or 4 drinks instead the 2 I had.  Maybe I would've liked my date more?!  HAHA

Oh, and on a prior visit I had the tomato soup with the brie grilled cheese sandwich...very tasty!"}
{"text":"Firefly is one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas. I love love love this place.

I usually enjoy coming during dinner hours. The lights are dimmed, the ambience is chic, dressing up here is welcomed but you can also be casual. 

The tapas here are so damn good. The scallops \"escargot\" are buttery and cooked just right. The camarones aljillo, tuna tartare (with taro chips), shrimp ceviche, steak and mushroom skewers MUST TRY THESE), and any of their empanadas are always what I order right away. Did I also mention they have bacon wrapped dates? Try them. They sound weird, but so worth it.

If the party being seated to eat is more than 6 people, gratuity is already included in bill. 

I come to Firefly at least once a month and I can honestly say, despite it's salmonella outbreak a few years back, I'm still a loyal food-goer and will always be willing to throw some dollars on their pitchers of sangria!"}
{"text":"Nice place to take a girl to at night.. Very dim and loud with music.  Service is wonderful, food portions are a bit small so don't come here starving.  Had some ahi cubes with chips.  Place is pretty packed at night and open during lunch.  

Parking is very tight, small lot shared."}
{"text":"We love Firefly! Came for the ceviche and sangria. Service is always good but today it was over the top because of Jesus E (Lalo). He made our experience extra special tonight. Thanks Jesus!"}
{"text":"came into town one day after one of those \"lets go to vegas tomorrow!!!\" nights...

luckily we had some friends that were locals, and they brought us to this quaint, yet sexy lil tapas spot right off the strip.

FIREFLY.

it was a saturday night, and it was busy.  we kicked it at the bar while waiting for a table.  finally got seated and was treated to a wide selection of tapas.  came here with a pretty good sized group so i got to sample a little bit of everything.  lets just say... lets just SAY... LETS JUST SAY EVERYTHING WAS DELISH!!!

a month later i was back in vegas, and guess where i took my friends...YOU GUESSED IT!

to the massage parlor!!! jk... (ok half serious)

but before that we went to FIREFLY!!

pretty much just what i expected, excellent."}
{"text":"TLDR: decent prices, solid shrimp, limited selection, and horrible charcuterie selection

This place was worth a shot, but I think it needs some help with ambience. When you first walk in it feels sexy and intriguing, but the further into the restaurant you go the more it feels like just a dimly lit casual restaurant (NOT a compliment). 

Nonetheless, the servers were pretty nice, and the dishes came out at a good pace. It was definitely a very solid dinner, if you count only the \"easy\" dishes. In other words, their kitchen is fine in terms of using skill, but for things like charcuterie where sourcing really matters, they weren't great."}
{"text":"This is one of few Yelp reviews I have ever done... FIREFLY IS AMAZING! We were seated outside and our server Alejandro was fantastic. He provided great recommendations and was very attentive.

We were there for an early happy hour dinner on a Friday night. We had Mojitos, Red Sangria, Fire*Fries, Stuffed Dates, Albondigas, Veggie Empanada, Serrano Ham Sliders, and Stuffed Peppers. I can't stop telling people about the great food. Every bite was better than the last.

Highly recommended for a great meal and great service  at an affordable price."}
{"text":"My review is based mostly on the food here -- it's good but not out of this world. The concept of tapas and sangria paired with decent service is sure to be a hit with a majority of people however I just didn't get what all the fuss was."}
{"text":"The tomato bread was amazing and the Serrano sliders tasted so good. Every thing I had was delicious."}
{"text":"I am SO glad that there is a Firefly location on the west side of town! It is a very cool location for either a date or with a group.  It was definitely busy on a Saturday night, but our group was able to be seated in the lounge area at one of the tables in the back. This was great, because it was intimate with couches and low chairs, and we were able to stretch out a bit and enjoy ourselves.  Service was a little slow, but we couldn't fault them for that- they were pretty packed.

I had a blueberry mojito, and while it wasn't bad, I've definitely had better. The food was very good, however. We had the meatballs, empanadas, duck egg rolls, lobster escargot, calamari, steak and mushroom skewers, stuffed dates, and maybe one or two other things I am forgetting. The calamari was great, and I also enjoyed the empanadas.  Despite all of this food, the portions are small, so you likely won't get full. The stuffed dates were delicious as always, and so was the calamari. The lobster escargot was good, but had lots of garlic!  

All of this adds up quickly, so keep track of your ordering.We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Been there about 10 times...
My top 5 ranking as follow:
1.  Camarones A La Diabla
2.  Filet Mignon Sliders
3.  Chorizo Clams
4.  Stuffed Dates
5.  Tuna Tatare"}
{"text":"Gooooood foood! Great atmosphere good for group get togethers or even a date :) and also excellent service"}
{"text":"For four people, we ordered 13 plates, which arrived briskly with a smile.  Service was prompt, and the food rather flavourful.  Price point was excellent, especially considering the two pitchers of Sangria and two additional beers we had ordered.

While there were left overs (especially the paella), we did enjoy the food soundly."}
{"text":"The Skinny: affordable fusion-Spanish tapas with some hits and misses (3.5), service: not as prompt as the Paradise locations - then again, we went when the place wasn't official open, lol! (3), value: for what it is, it isn't a bad place to hang out and nibble on some snacks. I have to say though - the chocolate tres leches is to die for! (3.5)

My hubby and I came with a group of friends to enjoy Firefly two weeks prior to the official opening date. I have to say - the place was pretty hopping from the get go and we got the feeling that the staff wasn't quite ready for it (ie, long waits for drinks, lengthy time between dishes). Seeing at how the Paradise location operates, I'm sure once their open for good, the service will be brisk and efficient.

The beauty of tapas is that you can try a little bit of everything - sorta family style. We were enthused that we now had a location so close to our neighbourhood.

So we ordered the thai beef salad, the chicken salad, the ahi tuna tartare, meatballs, filet mignon sliders, diablo shrimp, some skewers (steak and mushroom, chicken), crispy duck rolls, and the grilled Merguez sausage.

Overall - I have to say that the dishes were only so-so - nothing terribly exciting and would generally rate a 3 stars. The food was generally seasoned well however were often times overpowered by a strong sauce (ex. meatballs, diablo shrimp). The proteins in general tended to be on the overcooked end of things (the Merguez and the skewers tended to be a trifle dry). And the Asian fusion dishes fell flat due to oversweetness in various sauces (not to mention the duck rolls weren't really that crisp).

The chicken salad for me was a big surprise because I thought it was going to be grilled chicken on top of salad topped with some sherry vinegar dressing. Nope - it's a creamy mayonaise chopped chicken concoction you normally get in between sandwiches... without the bread.  I couldn't even taste the grapes and there's virtually no lettuce at all on the plate. Would not recommend. 

I have to say this - if you're looking for a good tres leches cake, come to Firefly. My favourite thing on the menu by a long shot. The cake soaked in milk is perfect for when you have the doldrums - a nice chocolate sponge drenched in milk - yum! A definite pick-me up. That alone is a 4 star dish.

Given these factors, I'd say Firefly deserves a 3.5 star review."}
{"text":"The best place i have found to just chill and sip sangria and eat tapas in vegas very fun with large partys . wait staff not the best but up their ."}
{"text":"Definitely do yourself a solid, go here with your significant other and enjoy the awesome food!

We got sooo much stuff  can't remember, everything was fast, hot and delicious. The Sangria was on point, spicy shrimp was baller and the banana's foster is out of this world.

Great service and fast cooks!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend had been dying to try Firefly for quite some time and kindly decided to take me for a belated birthday dinner. We were able to make reservations through open table via the yelp app (very cool and super easy)! Based upon reviews of Helpers and friends Firefly was surely a place that would please our curious appetites.
The service we received was attentive and extremely helpful. Our server had us stop ordering after we selected 6 items suggesting that it may be too much food for 2 people. I had a craving for a cocktail and order the Cherry Mule. It was such a creative take on the Moscow Mule with the twist of adding the St. Germaine's lovely flavor. Thebread and butter was absolutely a great pairing. The butter was sweet and the bread was slightly salty. Our server recommended the figs which we loved! They were stuffed with candied walnuts and sprinkled with cheese as well as a great lightly drizzled sauce. Next were the tuna tartar & ceviche. The tuna tartar was accompanied by fried taro chips and not only did it look good it was also very filling. If I had to pick a favorite of the Tuna Tartar and the Ceviche, then it'd be the ceviche hands down. It was so flavorful and refreshing! The next item was the spicy beef salad and item did not disappoint with its slight kick and yummy dressing! We decided to try out the Diablo shrimp and octopus. Of the 2 dishes I'd recommend the shrimp over the octopus since octopus seemed to have too much going on. We decided to add another dish for good measure. I must confess that Chicken AND Chorizo was my absolute favorite dish!!!! What an amaze combo of tastiness! 
To end our meal we ordered the gelato trio and chocolate trees leches cake. The chocolate tres leches cake was ok. I've had better versions in Santa Ana and at other establishments, but the Gelato Trio was spot on!"}
{"text":"Came with a group of 6ish while at convention, we shared numerous plates and all left satisfied and happy for around $100 total which is fantastic in Vegas and for being right behind the strip. Ambiance was warm and intimate. There is a bit of a wait, seems to be a popular place, however, a bar is conveniently located a couple doors down which we took advantage of while waiting.  Raved about the place to fellow conference attendees encouraging them to check it out. We had too many dishes to recall, however, we were not disappointed with any of them. Will make it back next time in town."}
{"text":"Nice looking restaurant, interesting food choices at very reasonable prices, good service and away from all the casino's smoke and bustle. 

We went at about 10pm on a sunday and it was perfect for a romantic dinner experience. we sat in the patio, which has just the right amount of light and the music level is good for having a conversation. 
However, if you are looking for a different experience, you can sit inside or at the bar where the music is louder."}
{"text":"Took the kids and went to celebrate my husbands birthday. Loved the ambiance and enjoyed the food. Recommend this place if you want to get away from the craziness of the vegas strip"}
{"text":"Off the strip little lounge atmosphere is a big relief from chain and corporate hell in Las Vegas.   It has a local feel that was a treasure in sin city.  
Have cocktails, have snacks, come on a night where they have a DJ, and feel a little more human off the strip."}
{"text":"The food here is always very good. The bacon wrapped dates I've always been one of my favorites. The sangria is very refreshing. I would've given it five stars but gave work because the service on this trip is not so good. The server system was excellent I waters were always fall. However the server himself acted like he had somewhere else rather be. I will continue to visit firefly for the great quality food."}
{"text":"I have been to Spain and had tapas before this place is as good as it get in the states. The name is perfect cause it is fire!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great food and service . Mario and Gerardo were incredible servers. Will be back again really soon
Recommend highly"}
{"text":"came here a few weeks ago when attending the NFR. a group of friends recommend this place to us, and also dined with us. the cocktails are amazing, and strong!! super service too!! we all orders 2 plates, and shared. everything ordered was fantastic, and fresh! ! we ordered more plates til all was satisfied, and tipsy!! wonderful! !"}
{"text":"I have been here a number of times and have not been disappointed. I've tried about half of the menu and the food has been consistently great! The sangria is delicious. Nice outdoor seating area. Between the price point and the food quality, absolutely worth getting off the strip to eat here."}
{"text":"This place was delicious! Our waiter was sloooowwww but the food was so amazing we didn't care too much.

Our favorite was the steak and mushroom skewers. So incredibly tender and the sauce was divine!

YUM!"}
{"text":"We went to Firefly last week for lunch. The service was excellent (their were only 2 other tables). All the food came out hot and fresh. Everything tasted great. I would recommend this place to my friends and family."}
{"text":"3 stars for the taste of food, 4 stars for lively atmosphere.

I love small plates of food because you have many options and many different flavors. Although I was eating different items, I could not find a dish that was so stellar that  I yearned for when I lie in bed. My tastebuds weren't on fire but I was OK with that because I was having a lot of fun catching up with my friends who were vacationing from California. We were chatting and picking at food and when we got thirsty we had a gulp of sangria and went back to chatting and picking at food. In the end, we ate and drank everything. I think this is a great place to hang out, eat a little to hold you over for dinner, and loosen up for the night ahead. So don't expect an excellent meal here but do expect to have a good time with your buddies!"}
{"text":"If you find this place, you're a foodie!!

First, this isn't on the strip, so there's no way you can find this place unless you do your research or know locals.

I enjoyed every bite from Ahi Tuna, Potatoes, to the MAC N CHEESE! amazing!!!! 

Prices were pretty cheap so, it's a plus!!!"}
{"text":"I live two blocks from this place and had yet to go.  But if your going to Firefly it up, the first time is always better with the Yelperazzi Posse for Angela H's Adios Fiesta. 

I love me some tapas or I like to refer to as the spanish version of dim-sum.  I've had great sangrias back in NYC and SF, so my expectations were high.  The sangrias are very good and nicely chilled and had plenty of fruit, absolutely order a pitcher or three.  I could've downed a whole pitcher by myself!

The Tuna tartare which was really good with sliced mangoes on top.  I also tried the Chorizo Clams which was kind of bland...probably wouldn't order that one again.  Veggie empanadas were good, but I don't think I've ever had a bad empanada that I wouldn't destroy.  

Unfortunately I missed out on the 3-6 happy hour but great to know for next time and look forward to checking out the downtown location also."}
{"text":"Wonderful if you are in the mood for tapas. Fun and lively place and you get to eat so many different things."}
{"text":"The place is great, the music is great, prices are great. We came here last night around 11:00pm and everything was good until we ordered the paella. It had lots of hairs, long hairs in it.... we we're pretty full, but we could've eaten more. We sent it back, however the manager came to our table and said: \"Just so you know, I'm going to take it off the check but back in the kitchen no one could've drop a hair there\" she didn't apologize, in the contrary, she insinuated that we, as customers, put the hairs on it. We thought it was very offensive. We were ordering lots of drinks and by that time we ordered a bottle of wine... We were there to eat well, spend money and have a good time and it was just offensive to hear that. Even if we could've been \"those\" type of customers, she should've just apologized. Very disrespectful. Our server was really nice and came back and apologized for everything, which was the only thing we wanted to hear."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere. Good food. Free parking. (Free valet) They moved a heater towards us because we sat outside. That was very nice of them. Inside the restaurant at 7pm on Friday night was pretty loud. If you want to go somewhere to have a meaningful conversation you might want to go elsewhere depending on the time and day you go there. The food looked and tasted great. I'm definitely going back there again."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Firefly and I was impressed. The place is loud but fun. The atmosphere is great and I wanted everything on the  menu! I had the Tuna and Avocado thing (totally forget what it's called) and a passionfruit mojito. The mojito was A-MAZING and so delicious! The service was so-so. They kept bringing us the wrong dishes and giving them to the wrong people. It took a long time to get a refill on my water. 
I'd definitely visit again when in Vegas"}
{"text":"I've visited Firefly on a few occasions and am only reviewing now....bad yelper.  Hubby surprised me by taking me here for a quick early dinner before opera rehearsal and it was a welcome diversion.  We shared a red wine sangria, tuna peppers (tuna salad stuffed into wee red peppers; lovely bright flavour), sausage plate, tortilla a la espanola, filet mignon sliders (2 lovely little baby burgers with plenty of cheese), and albondigas (meatballs in a very yummy sherry tomato sauce).  It's so easy to overeat here, because each selection seems so darn small (what?  Only 4 meatballs?? only 2 sliders?), but after trying a few things, your tummy definitely says stop.  Had to have dessert -- i AM a girl -- and chose the chocolate tres leches cake.  Gah, so good.  Delectable.

All hot items were hot, all cold items were cold, and service was pretty decent.  This place fills up fast, so don't come here with a strict timeline.  Atmosphere is trendy, young, chic, which can translate as \"low lighting and close quarters,\" but also interpreted as intimate and cozy.  :)"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! The food is excellent. For a Celiac like me, it is a wonderland. The fries with Parmesian and herbs are cooked in a designated gluten free fryer. So many other foods to choose from! The Gf menu is huge!!!"}
{"text":"Ok, my top dishes...so far...the dates, the shrimp diablo, filet skewers, and the cheesecakes with passion fruit sauce!  The service is always excellent, though the wait times for a table are sometimes a little long. (hazard of a popular place)"}
{"text":"Best meal I've had in a long time!  Service was great.  My friend and I sat outside on the patio and it was so fun, the ambiance was nice.  Our order came out one dish at a time --which was great because we were able to enjoy each tapas and not feel rushed.  This is an great restaurant and I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"This is my go to place and has yet to fail me. Everything is consistent. From the service, to the food, to the drinks, everything is on point. All their tapas choices are very good. I've tried a good chunk of the menu and I have yet to taste something I didn't like. My favorites are the filet mignon sliders, stuffed dates, and lobster escargo. You literally can't go wrong with anything on the menu. For drinks, they have some of the best sangria and mojitos in town. It can get crowded on the weekends, so be prepared to wait or come early!"}
{"text":"The selection of different things to try at this place is endless.  Come here during happy hour and feast like you've never feasted before.  Try the sangria and just about anything on the menu is worth tasting.  If you are picky then maybe this isn't your place.  But if you like tapas this is THE spot."}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant. Absolutely delicious. I've been to Spain and have to say their tapas are pretty similar to what I've had there. Definitely coming back. Also a plus - service was amazing."}
{"text":"So my future sister-in-law made reservations here for her bachelorette dinner on a Saturday at 7:30. We arrived at 7:30 or 7:35 and were seated at about 7:45. The ambiance was nice and I as digging the vibe. We were seated and were kind of discouraged right off the bat when the servers were around our table but no one came to introduce themselves, ask for our drink order, or if we wanted to start off with any of the tapas. Thirty minutes later we flagged someone down to ask if we could order drinks and food... And had to flag people down for another thirty minutes afterward. The restaurant was quite loud and busy, but other tables were being served and we were right next to the server station and bar and couldn't get anyone to take our order! After I explained that it was my sister-in-laws bachelorette the staff became more attentive. The saving grace was most definitely the food and mojitos. The bacon-wrapped dates and ceviche were amazing, as well as the pork empanadas. 

All in all, the food and drinks were delicious but the service leaves much to be desired. We are visiting from the east coast and my future sister-in-law was bummed that we were being looked over on what was supposed to be a fun evening out. The photographer that snaps a picture of you while you're trying to enjoy your food really brought us down a notch too. She then comes back later and tries to sell you the photos for $15 apiece... What?!? It really cheapens the entire experience. I get that it's Vegas, but there is a time and a place and it isn't while we are eating."}
{"text":"I like this location as it's close to home and the library!  Went here the other night and stuffed myself silly.  There were 3 of us and it was around 6pm and the place was hopping.  We waited for about 30 minutes, which is short, and were seated by the perky hostess.  All our tapas were great and flavourful; on this visit, our favourites included the padron peppers (mild), the bacon-wrapped dates (because anything in bacon is great), and the tortilla a la espanola.  We also enjoyed the sangria and dessert (lemon tarts and chocolate-cherry bread pudding).  Our server was fantastic and attentive without being insincere!

Come out for a good time and some great nibbles."}
{"text":"I visited friends in Vegas in June, and they brought me here.  I can't thank them enough.  I had previously never had tapas (a huge oversight on my part) and really enjoyed them.  

The dishes that stand out in my memory are:
- Tortilla a la espanola (served hot, which was new for me, I'm used to it room temperature or cold, but it was very good)
- Mushroom tart (delicious, but I'm a sucker for puff pastry and mushrooms)
- Artichoke toasts (refreshing and tasty)

It was very crowded, but we were willing to sit outside, even though it was at least in the 90s out there.  I wouldn't recommend taking many out of town guests into the heat of the Vegas night, but I was visiting from Texas, and it's both hot and humid there, so the dry heat was fine.

As previously noted, the parking lot is somewhat dangerous and busy but the food was worth taking the risk.  This is a good choice if you have a mixed group of vegetarians/meat eaters, as there's a little something for everyone."}
{"text":"Had a lot of delicious food here.  We had the sliders (the petite filet, I think), tuna tartare, ceviche,  albondigas, lamb chops, stuffed peppers, and some other stuff.

I really enjoyed the ceviche.  The lambchops were tender and flavorful.  I also liked the texture and flavor of the tuna tartare, although my boyfriend thought it reminded him a little of cat food.  My boyfriend said the petite filet sliders were the best burgers he had ever had.

We also ordered a pitcher of red wine sangria.  We were starting to get drunk by this time, so maybe that has affected my review, but I thought everything was delicious, including the sangria.  I particularly liked the lambchops and ceviche."}
{"text":"Nothing better than ending a LOSING trip to vegas with some good eats.  My buddy use to be the former exec. sous at TAO, recommended this joint.  Cant believe it took me this long to try.  One of the better tapas places i've ever been....granted, my tapas tasting has been limited due to younglings.... anyhow...on to the food:

Stuffed Dates:  Lived up to the hype.  Must eat all components together.  My first bite was without the blue cheese crumble, and it was eh...then the second one was HOLY SCHMOLY!  Very good... And i dont even care for dates.

Chicken Chorizo Stuffed Mushrooms;  Good...but no wow factor... they tricked me by printing \"YUM\" on the menu description.

Calamari:  Very good....the garlic aioli was excellent

Tuna Tartare:  Fresh, cut too big, but nice cold app to go with alcohol.

Paella:  MONEY MONEY MONEY.  Now this is good stuff.  Not too salty, plenty of shrimp, chicken, sausage, calamari, very very good.  ONLY minor glitch... i think because of the wait and the crowds, they served the dish in a cold paella dish.  The best part of paella is the crunchy part of the rice on the bottom of the pan.  Otherwise, this was first rate.

White Sangria:  Only had a sip, but it was ok....better off with hard liquor or cold beer.

Service was good considering the crowds.  Kinda hot though...the A/c wasnt on full blast.  Definitely worth another visit..... nice change of pace from the Overpriced strip eateries...."}
{"text":"Probably everything you order off the menu would be good!  We had a party of 16 people, and I had no idea what we were ordering, so I just threw out some dishes I saw that caught my eyes - fish sticks, clams, mussels, and paella.  

Everything was delicious, and I mean EVERYTHING!  The tuna tartare and the ceviche were on point!  We had two birthday boys with us, and the restaurant treated us with a few pitchers of sangrias, two birthday shots, and two tshirts for the birthday boys.  

Don't have anything but good thing to say about this place.  I know this is the new location, (I've never been to the old location) but the place seems nice and clean.  

Our party had a great time! Definitely be back next time we're in town!"}
{"text":"Love this place the food is amazing the staff is even better!!! Very personal super friendly my kinda place to get a drink and relax!!"}
{"text":"Worst service of my life. Staff is mental! And Joshua is a complete idiot. Went there for happy hour with my family. Showed up at 3, place was completely empty and the host asked if we had a reservation because out party was too big. Waited for 30 minutes to be seated. Server showed up twice our whole time there. Once to take our order and the second time to drop the tab off. Waited another 30 minutes for him to pick it up and he never did I had to go up to the bar to pay. And still waited till my server gave me the tab to sign. And was charged for a plate that they gave to the opposite side of the table so I never received it. Plus paid for a new order of the item and still waited 20 minutes more. NEVER AGAIN DONT COME HERE!"}
{"text":"Loved finding this unique and tasty restaurant off the strip for our vacation! The food was a  pleasant twist on the authentic flavors. Since my husband has taken trips to Spain this was a real comfort food trip for him. 

Be sure to try different tapas and share them in the standard Spanish tradition. We also enjoyed the Paella. A must for Vegas."}
{"text":"Two years after one of my students, who'd recently traveled widely in Spain, suggested Firefly to me, we finally popped into the Sahara location near Fort Apache.

I was a little hesitant because I'd done my own travels across Spain - a month in 1994 - and as a vegetarian it hadn't gone well. One extraordinary lemon sorbet and the first plate of asparagus I ever liked aside, that entire trip could've been dubbed \"Parade of the Manchego Sandwich.\" And manchego is a pretty hard (as in knock-knock, hear-an-echo hard) cheese to endure in a sandwich. Twice a day. For a month.

But the menu at Firefly looked invitingly diverse, so I put my prejudices aside and off we went.

I was concerned that the atmosphere might be uncomfortably posh or trendy for this aging suburban nerd, but it was truly an all-types atmosphere. I saw families, older women chatting together, couples, and the usual bar scene, which didn't dominate the rest of the establishment. 

Four types of seating are available: barstools, high-tops for four, lounge sofas and ottomans with lowish tables for 6-8, and traditional dining tables for 2-4. We didn't want a high-top, so the hostess offered us a lounge \"quadrant\" all to ourselves. Nice! The tables are not \"ultra-lounge low,\" so we enjoyed the seats even though we were there to eat, not to laze around and drink.

We both ordered soft drinks (lemonade), and even though one might think \"tapas = bar = alcohol,\" the waiter didn't ignore us as sometimes happens, and refills came quickly.

Soon a plate of small slices of toast, balls of sweet (really sweet) butter (and garlic?), and a little bowl of unpitted Spanish olives arrived. All three parts were tasty, and I've been a hater of the green olive all of my life. But in this set-up, it just finally clicked. Mostly, though, I was impressed that they'd throw in a complimentary like this when we'd be ordering our own series of small plates in a moment.

(Firefly does offer \"big plates,\" bowls of pasta, and they also do paella from scratch - and advise you of a 40-minute wait - including non-seafood and even vegetarian versions.)

We started with the lightly dressed green apple and manchego salad with smoked almonds. This was probably my favourite dish of the evening. Both the cheese and the apple were cut matchstick style, so in the dim lights it was hard to tell which was which, and I think this added to the experience. (Kind of a spin on the \"dining in the dark\" trend - probably unintentional, but it kept my mouth surprised.) I don't know what type of herb was on the salard, but it added pep to what is always a nice combination. Light and delicious!

Next we had the veggie empanada and the regular (roast pork) empanada. I'm a sucker for empandas, so they couldn't go wrong here, and it was my husband's number-one pick. Each was served with a different kind of dressed greens, making these choices, at $4.50 each, an especially good value.

After that we had Spanish-style tortillas, which means something like a little omelette made of potato, onion, and egg. Three fave ingredients, but it was at this point that I noticed there wasn't any salt and pepper on the tables.

Finally we tried the stuffed peppers, filled with mozzarella and garlic cream cheese with a tomato sauce. Hitting the mozzarella center provided an interesting chewiness, but honestly, it tasted more like it should be described as \"cream cheese with a thick skin around it.\" Enjoyable for one bite, but that was it for me.

After this we were full, with all of my plans for mushroom tarts and roasted potatoes in spicy aioli and tomato-basil soup with tiny grilled brie sandwiches floating away. We didn't even get the Firefly fries! This is the disadvantage of going as a twosome; you won't have room to sample as much.

For friendliness, Firefly gets a 5. For atmosphere, a 4-5, just because the traditional dining tables (where I'd rather sit next time) looked a little close together and noisy/busy, and this was a Wednesday night, but it's a pretty space with several seating options and not at all bar-loud. For menu variety, a 5. As a vegetarian, I was elated. My husband wasn't, but he's truly the picky one. (So, check out the online menu first if you're Driving Mr. Fussy that night.)

Now, for taste. I'll say... 3. 

I loved the green apple/manchego salad. I wish it was next to me right now. But the rest? While the tortilla was the worst example, everything tasted a little bland to me. It wasn't that it lacked spice so much - and it's true that I have my Indian/Thai/Mexican biases - but that the flavours didn't offer any interesting contrasts when mixed together. Maybe the missing ingredient was a side of booze.

Fair enough. And I still want to try that mushroom tart, that toasted brie sandwich, and - ooo - the roasted eggplant cannelloni! I'll definitely be back, but it's no hardship to wait until Mr. Fussy owes me a favour."}

If we could give zero stars
We would, if based on food alone

{"text":"Good tapas restaurant.  It's like eating bunch of Spanish appetizers.  It's a little pricey but I don't mind since it's on the company expense.  Everything is pretty good there.  I enjoy the duck rolls, calamari, and the sangrai."}
{"text":"Solid Spanish tapas restaurant! We came on a weekday afternoon for a late lunch, which was nice because there weren't many people there and our server was quite attentive. We originally wanted to get the paella, but we didn't want to wait, nor did we have the appetite for the dish (it feeds from 2 to 4 people and there were only 2 of us...), so we ended up opting for the tapas. The tapas were delicious! The stuffed dates were delicious! Bacon! Dates! And a toasted almond in the middle! The croquettas were of course delicious! I'm not sure how that dish can ever go wrong. The stuffed peppers were super cheesy and good. My favorite, though, was probably the baked tetilla. This is essentially a large pot of baked cheese. Oh so good! The cheese also has some tomatoes and chorizo, so each bites has a bunch of flavors and stuff mixed into creamy baked cheese."}
{"text":"Best tapas place in Las Vegas and probably in most places I've been to.  Love the seafood paella (I had them put the sausage and beef bits on the side).  The tilapia was good if you like it lemony.  If you don't like it to be too zesty, you can always ask them to put less lemon slices, or have them on the side.  My friend raved about his mac and cheese, which disappeared in his mouth in less than 3 minutes.  

It's also opened late too which was a plus!"}
{"text":"This place is daddy! This is the best Tapas place in Vegas, hands down. What's nice about this place is it's not all touristy etc. This is more of a locals hangout spot. Lot's of sexiness there, so you may wanna throw on some Cologne for this one. 

My Favs: 

Dates wrapped in Bacon 
Thai Beef Salad 
Baked Tetilla 
Meatballs 
Chicken Skewers 
Duck Rolls 
Merguez 
Cherry Bread Pudding 

Its right across the street from the Hard Rock."}
{"text":"Great place. Good food, good prices. The manager Eduardo is a total pleasure. I wasted money on cigarettes that I didn't get and he went out of his way to make it up to me without reimbursing me for my pack. Good times"}
{"text":"I felt we were paying largely for the atmosphere. The patio was packed when we arrived and the inteior has nice decorations with red being the primary theme. The candles are a nice touch and make the open seating feel a little more intimate. The front waiting area is like a lounge. The bar was well attended and looked well stocked. 

When we arrived, I ordered a cappuccino and my boyfriend had a beer. He didn't like the beer very much so he downed it quickly and we ordered mojitos. I got the blood orange while he had the mango. I liked the tartness of the blood orange and the texture was nice- like it had some pulp in it which I enjoy. The mango mojito was a bit too sweet, though. 

We started with the tuna tartare. Obviously stuffed into a tuna can and flipped onto the plate, it's layers of fresh tuna with mango, avocado and a little seasoning plus some taro chips to scoop with. This was a highlight to the meal. 

After the tartare we had the ham and cheese croquettes. They came in a serving of 3, which I thought was odd. They looked slightly burnt on the outside but were creamy and tasty on the inside. The sauce was rich, but the portion size was awkward and a bit small. The risotto balls at Ferraro's or croquettes elsewhere are better.

Then came the sirloin sliders. Tasty, but not particularly memorable. 

The crispy duck was burnt and had too much sesame. Not something I'd order again and a bit disappointing. The portion was small and it was sloppily sliced. 

The lamb chops with lentils were the other highlight. The meat was tender and the lentils with veggies were flavorful. The portion was small but balanced by the lentils. 

The mushooms stuffed with chicken and chorizo were boring. We didn't like the cheese on top and the chorizo flavor was weak. Not something we'd order again.

Overall, it ended up being expensive for what was essentially fancy bar food. I might give them a second chance some day and try the other dishes I hadn't gotten to sample, but I'm in no hurry. We weren't impressed."}
{"text":"Service was a bit spotty and one of my colleagues had a really gross drink (I think a mojito) here, but other than that, it was a great place to go for dinner. A great list of various tapas and we had several: tortilla espanola (they put hot sauce on it, so watch on it), sliders (yummy), shrimp diablo, stuffed peppers (delish), and several others which I forget. It was all quite tasty, but a few dishes were a little too spicy for me. I am a wimp though, so they might be better for you. Go for the sangria too - it's quite tasty! The atmosphere is nice - it's dark and a little more cozy than other places in Vegas."}
{"text":"Neo and the entire firefly team made our wedding reception absolutely amazing. Food and drinks were delicious , service was top notch  we had reserved the private room and they assisted my bridesmaids with set up and were more than flexible . We ordered the three course meal and everything from cheese platters, filet Mignon , paella was perfect . Prices super affordable ! We live in Texas but def want to come back to eat at firefly again"}
{"text":"Always terrific tapas with great service!  Note: they do not take reservations on weekends.  Kind of a pain in the ass when you have 8 people. However, they let us take over a table for a 8pm reservation (apparently you can get them if you are willing to pay $55/person or have a friend that works there) as long as we were gone by then.  Turns out the 8pm reservation were friends of ours.  How funny!

The red sangria was awesome and they kept it flowing.  Good local Summerlin place to celebrate that doesn't close at 9pm."}
{"text":"I adore Firefly, but you all have to admit that this location is getting a little worn around the edges.  The place is dark but not so dark that I can't see the holes in the couches.  Still, the tapas and sangria are great.  I think the bacon-wrapped dates taste better at this location, although it could be that I always tend to be drunker at this location.

The sangria is a little ice intensive when you get it by the pitcher, which is fine.  But usually I end up with a ton of ice and a tiny bit of sangria.  I take one sip and my glass is empty and my co-workers think I am a lush.  Occasionally, they use a cocktail strainer to pour the sangria from the pitcher but they aren't consistent about that and I really wish they would be.  There is only so much ice I need.

I have fond memories from this location and I love the food but I think this location needs a bit of an overhaul."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about Firefly. I have been there for New Year's Eve, dinners with friends, drinks after work, and nights out.  Everything on the menu is delicious!  I have never had a bad meal. The sangria is the best I have ever had.  My favorite tapa is probably the bacon wrapped dates, but they are all delicious."}
{"text":"Honestly one of my favorite tapas places ever. It's close, it's convenient, the food and service is good, and the prices aren't bad. Unfortunately, their old rep is preceeding them, but I've never had food poisening here, and neithet have any of my friends or family. 

The happy hour here is great. The pear martini is delish. Not too sweet. I really like the sangria, I usually get a pitcher. Sometimes two. :P

The boqueronea are toasts with anchovies, avacado, and lemon drizzle. Super super good. Nice and fresh. Not too heavy.
The roasted eggplant cannolini with goat cheese is also quite good. I'm a sucker for goat cheese.
The beet salad is probably my favorite. Also has nut crusted goat cheese. 
The stuffed dates are probably the most popular dish, and for good reason. They have an almond inside with of course...goat cheese. So delish. These are pretty rich, however.
Stuffed peppers have mozz and cream cheese. It's like jalapeno poppers but fancy.

I've also had a few of their salads, the steak one is my fav. Just look at the menu. You'll know why.

All in all, a great place to come after work for happy hour or before a night on the town."}
{"text":"The food is always amazing at Firefly's and the bar staff is always very friendly and their drinks are very generous. However; I have now dined in twice at this location is Summerlin and both times received pretty bad service. The most recent visit the server was quite friendly but almost absent the entire time. The first time the server was very unfriendly and only came to our table once to take our order, once to bring the food and last to bring the check. I gave him 0% tip. The second server received a little over 20% because he was really really nice and he did look busy. I would highly recommend checking this place out as a TACO TUESDAY spot. they have great tacos for 2 bucks a pop and they also have latin night so the place is open until 3 a.m. Blah blah blah"}
{"text":"Ambience is great. Good I was not surprised. I was expecting authentically Spanish tapas and you can always tell by their tortilla española, it was fair quality.
I would recommend for drinks, the sangria is pretty good and one glass got me buzzed."}
{"text":"Killing time playing Blackjack on a Saturday night before 8 pm dinner reservations at Firefly, we mentioned to our pert little dealer we were dining there.  \"I *love* that place!\"  she squealed, \"Get the mac 'n' cheese!\"  When we piled into the taxi later and told our driver, \"Firefly on Paradise,\" he crowed, \"That place is great!  Get the mac 'n' cheese!\"

Dinner at Firefly (which SIL found through Yelp) was for husband's birthday bash.  SIL had been working with the the manager via e-mail for weeks to arrange a group dinner for 13 of us.  For 2 hours and $50 a head, we could eat as many of the 6 pre-selected tapas (which SIL had chosen after reading the hundreds of Yelp reviews) we wanted, and drink as much alcohol as we desired.  SIL said that dealing with the manager through e-mails to arrange dinner had been a pleasure -- smooth and easy.

We started with fresh bread and ramekins of almond butter.  Which was not the almond version of peanut butter I was expecting, but butter blended with crushed almonds, slightly sweet and delicious.  The tapas we sampled were:

1) Dates stuffed with smoked almonds, wrapped in bacon, and drizzled with a red wine reduction and blue cheese crumbles.  The combos of salty and sweet, chewy and crunchy, were really pleasing.

2) Veggie empanadas -- airy, thin, crisp pastry filled with spinach, mushroom, artichoke, and herbed cream cheese, covered with red pepper aioli.  Remarkably interesting and flavorful.

3)  Steak and mushroom skewers -- grilled filet, button 'shrooms, roast garlic cream, and a red wine reduction.  Meat itself was a bit tough but tasted good, and the mushrooms were cooked perfectly.  Garlic cream was a phenomenal foil to the dish.

4) Steamed babyback ribs with mango BBQ sauce.  Nice flavor, falling off the bone tender, but really fatty like a lot of ribs.

5) Camarones a la diabla -- shrimp in a *spicy* chile sauce served with grilled bread. My personal favorite tapas.  Burn-your-lips spicy (in a great way) and explosive with flavor.  Shrimp were plump, juicy, and cooked just right.

And finally...the pièce de résistance: 

6) Manchego mac 'n' cheese.  After all the build up, after all the recommendations, you could practically here the \"womp wommp\" hovering over the table as we sampled it.  Sundried tomatoes were a great, flavorful addition, and the dish itself tasted good.  But it was soupy and not nearly as fabulous as we'd expected.  

Dessert was small plates of caramel flan, chocolate tres leches cake, and banana Nutella sandwiches.  All three were delicious.

We drank our fill of white and red sangrias, pitchers of mojitos, and bottles of wine and beer.  Service was wonderfully attentive and efficient.  Atmosphere was like a neighborhood bar: loud, crowded, and boisterous, everyone enjoying themselves immensely.  Ambiance was laid-back, very casual, and comfortable.  We were *so* glad we got off the Strip on this visit to enjoy a local favorite!  We weren't disappointed.

{"text":"Packed on a Monday evening!! I think we waited about a half hour.  

Sangria!!! Firefly is a tapas bar located off the strip but absolutely worth the drive or taxi ride for those who enjoy awesome food, drinks and atmosphere. Sometimes it's nice to get off the strip away from all the gambling and tourists.

Food and service were also great!
-Ceviche - very tasty.
-Thai Beef Salad - this might have been my favorite dish.
-Empanada - good!
-Bacon Wrapped Dates - a must.

The three of us shared a pitcher of Sangria It's as good as the Sangria I make at home...which is really good!! We had a great time!"}
{"text":"They serve tapas here, which are like small appetizer sized plates. They're a little pricey for what you get portion-wise and the food is ok... Service is usually decent, but they do get really really busy on Friday and Saturday nights so get there early to avoid waiting too long"}
{"text":"Cool little tapas restaurant, came in a large group for an event.  We had a private room which i though was weird that the tables were all squished in together, yet the room could have accommodated more tables spread out.  But it turned out fine and everyone had a great time.

We had the \"Tapas Banquet\"
Toasted bread, Olives and almond butter
artichoke toasts -  artichoke hearts, aioli, basil and pepper 
Stuffed dates - smoked almond, red wine reduction, blue cheese wrapped in bacon
Baby back ribs - with mango BBQ sauce
patatas bravas (spicy potatoes) - Roasted potatoes with spicy aioli
steak and mushroom skewers - Grilled Fillet, roasted garlic cream and red wine reduction.
camarones a la diabla - shrimp in a sweet and spicy sauce.
Chocolate très lèches cake.

My favorites were the Mango BBQ baby back ribs, i didn't taste any mango but it was definitely really tender and fall off the bone, and the BBQ sauce was delicious.  Bacon wrapped dates, smoky/savory and sweet at the same time too.  I think my favorite of all was the spicy potatoes, so good, i love a good tangy aioli and especially a spicy one it went really well with the potatoes, I'd put that sauce on a burger or even their fries any day of the week.  At first bight its really hot, but it wasn't the kind of hot that multiplies as you eat it.  I think as the dinner went on i got used to it so i just kept eating more and more of it.  So good!

Service was great, they explained everything and offered to take pictures of our group, refilled waters and drinks promptly.  Im sure everyone had a really good time."}
{"text":"This place is our new spot! The Fly Tai is super addictive and hits the spot! The service is so on point that they refilled my bf's Arnold Palmer 3 times throughout our dinner, immediately provided a new knife for me when mine fell, and quickly came to retrieve each dish and glass that was no longer in use (Thanks Mario and Lenny). I have tried so many dishes, I wouldn't know where to begin! All I can say is that when a restaurant has a separate vegetarian menu and the dishes come out delicious and in under 20 minutes - I'm impressed!

I heard they had some issues before, but they have truly made up for what ever errors took place in the past and have continued to surpass my expectations for service, food, and ambiance on multiple occasions."}
{"text":"This place isn't bad but it isn't the best. I must admit that I must get my artichoke toast, bacon wrapped dates, and albondigas fixing every couple of months. The atmosphere is cool for an after work hang out. It's not too much of a bar but not too snobby."}
{"text":"I have been here maybe 3 times. Each time I went I thought, \"Maybe I just ordered the wrong dishes. I should try something else next time.\" Bad idea. I know that the last time I was there was about 2 years ago but it really left a bad taste in my mouth. I have been going to the other Fireflies in Summerlin and that's better than the original.
I have never had to return a dish in my life but this had to go. I order a stuffed mushroom dish that came out cold and under seasoned. The fries were good. I forgot what else I ordered but I would recommend to go to the Summerlin Fireflies for a better experience."}
{"text":"On a very wintery day, i gotta say how much i dig the huge fireplace. 

Our server was chill, very anti-typical server- meaning she had her own hippie, unique lingo. \"wanna start with some drinkage?\" i imagine that's who she is outside the walls of Firefly. 

Speaking of Firefly, here's what we ordered: of course the Mt. Everest of firefly fries, very garlicy, make sure you bring your stash of gum for later. 

I ordered the 4 ounce Petite filet medium well, nicely seared but on one side a little bit burned, I'm assuming from the red wine. Next time I'll order it medium for more juiciness. But allow me to say this $10 item was worth every penny. Besides its simply beautylicous presentation, it came with a good amount of roasted potatoes and mushrooms. I should've stopped there. 

But I also had veggie empanadas to balance my diet. Packed with spinach. It's like popeye making culinary art work. 

The fish sticks were ok. It was the crispy texture that made it fun to eat, but the spicy tarter sauce made it extra spesh.

i noticed how almost each dish was complemented with some kind of ruffage (crisp romaine or arugula).

Fast forward to dessert. Their bread cherry pudding topped with vanilla ice cream. What A close.

As far as service, the great chemistry between our server and busser made our experience smooth."}
{"text":"Solid small plates and a nice patio. We were there for lunch but would love to come back on a Friday night for the entertainment. Nice to get away from the strip and find a decent restaurant."}
{"text":"Seriously, this has to be one of my favorite spots when I come to Vegas. The drinks, the tapas, the ambiance is all fabulous.

One warning. If you book a large group, have the first person check in when they arrive. I brought a group of students here and we didn't check in until everyone arrived and then despite being 15 minutes early for our reservation, we waited over an hour after our reservation time to be seated (with pre-made reservations guaranteed with a credit card). Once we were seated, everything was fine. However making 20+ people wait while one table sits (and doesn't order anything else) is ridiculous.

However, if you aren't bringing a large group, this place is awesome. The dishes are priced right. The drinks are pricey but no more pricey than the nearby strip!

You have to try the dates. Seriously. No really. Has anyone mentioned those dates yet in a review? Other must tries: Tuna Tartare, Smoked Salmon Toasts, Padron Peppers, and Crispy Duck Rolls

Vegetarian? Some of the favorites of my vegetarian friends (including the Padron Peppers) are the Mac n Cheese, Mushroom Tart, and Nutella Sandwiches"}
{"text":"We booked a large party at this venue. They were very accommodating and the food was excellent. The wait staff was very attentive to us. On our way out everyone was complimenting how great the food was, none of us disliked anything that was presented to us. We weren't sure what we were in for but our expectations were define my y surpassed. We really enjoyed the continuous flow of food. They even told us if there was anything we didn't like or wanted more of something they would be glad to swap it out. Really great experience and would definitely revisit them on our next trip to the area."}
{"text":"Food was good. Happy hour specials on beer and wine were decent. Over-all, a tad expensive for what it was. We sat at the bar, 2 people working behind the wood. The guy was ice cold, . a bit useless. He seemed to like to chit chat with colleagues/co-workers rather than entertain guests. The young lady working was quite welcoming, we tipped based on her service. I hope she doesn't have to share it with him. Not a bad experience but I wouldn't return on my next trip."}
{"text":"three words...absolutely freak'n awesome! The bacon wrapped dates are fantastic, and the red sangria was fabulous! Great place."}
{"text":"For When you've got some friends in town and you want them to have a fun interactive social dining experience with amazing food that they will talk about with their friends when they go back home this is the place. 
Also awesome for dates when you want to take turns picking what to order and sampling each others food. 
 
I always LOVE coming to this place. the food isn't crazy expensive, its delicious and its fun! Its always packed here so you really should call ahead and make reservations. 

I would possibly take away 1/2 a star because sometimes its a little too loud which takes away from the social aspect...since it can be hard to hear your friends. 

Tips:
Make reservations
Get a pitcher of sangria. 
Try the bacon wrapped stuffed dates."}
{"text":"Firefly has the best mojitos North of the Caribbean! My favorite is the their signature Paradise Mojito: coconut rum, pineapple flavor, mint, etc. -- simply delicious! 

If you're in the mood for a snack, their tapas aren't half bad either. The menu has something for everyone's taste including filet mignon sliders, stuffed peppers, macaroni and cheese, tres leches cake, and so much more! Everything on the menu tickles your taste buds with rich spices and unique flavor combinations.

This place is a great setting for a light lunch, a date, or a late night snack. The atmosphere is fun and energetic with a Latin twist. The downside? Everybody agrees -- it can get a bit crowded on nights and weekends. But its worth it, trust me!"}
{"text":"Been wanting to try Firefly and so happy we finally get to. 

First off, drinks - The sangrias are delicious and refreshing. We got the red and sparkling sangrias and the sparkling is definitely a winner

Bread with almond butter - The almond butter was soo good! Creamy with a little kick

Bacon wrapped dates - Must try! Sweet and salty combo was great! Theres a surprise nut in the middle.

Tierra y mar skewers - sooo good and tender with a chile verde sauce. Comes with sausage, filet and shrimp

Scallop Escargo - Garlic butter sauce is delish I wanted to drink that sauce

Steak skewers with gravy sauce, Yum!!!! Meat was very tender and flavorful

And last but not least Paella - Very tasty and plentiful. Flavor is good and it has a little heat.

Service is really good. Servers are nice and attentive. We'll be back here every time we're in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Had firefly cater an event for my company. At first they were a little tough to get ahold of but last minute they really came food (otherwise I would have left a 5 star reveiw). The food was amazing, the service from the delivery crew was amazing as well. The pricing was pretty good too!

I would use them again! Everyone was very pleased!"}
{"text":"I have got to call this place out on their TEEEEEEEERRIBLE service! I am a local and since this place has been around it has always had the worst service in Vegas! The service at the old Sahara location was good so it must be the management here that is the problem. I came in here on a slow day during non-happy hour prices and I still got bad service as usual. Im so mad i tipped 20% i shouldve talked to the manager lady that was there but she seemed to be really snobby and also not really worried about helping her team. 
1 star for the food
1 star for the decor 
-1 star for the service
-1 star for the hospitality 
-1 star for the value"}
{"text":"Good Job on the free sangria, place is going downhill fast....not even free stuff will get the public to come back.

Fix the health department issues first'

Farewell firefly"}
{"text":"This place is delicious. I came here with a large group of 9 and we were given excellent service. The food is very unique and delicious. The calamari is fantastic and so are the artichoke toasts. Has just the right amount of spices that make your mouth tingle. The empanadas were cooked perfectly and not greasy like other restaurants. The ingredients inside many of the dishes are unique and very flavorful. Next we tried skewers which were good but nothing really to write home about. We ordered more food but it wasnt stuff that i eat so i cannot comment on it. I will say though that this is my husbands favorite place to eat at and we shall go again soon."}
{"text":"Affordable, fast, and delicious tapas, it's one of my new fave spots to eat at in Vegas! They don't take reservations on weekends and we stopped in at around 5P for an early dinner and were seated right away. The fries, tuna tartar, and empanadas were a few of my faves. It's well worth the visit off the strip!"}
{"text":"I thought this place was awesome! Food was great it's off the strip had a cool lounge in the front where you could order food.  All the food was great and so was the sangria.  The prices were great and it wasn't too fancy so you didn't have to dress up. This place is a must try! Going to add some pictures of the food! Pictures really don't do this place justice"}
{"text":"I'm happy the place is bigger and there's actually parking! 

I Wish the service was as fast as it used to be.... They get your order and that's about it... Not good with the follow up service! 

Slightly disappointed they switched their shrimp cerviche order!!! And things are now even smaller.... I used to love their bread and now that's even different! 

Oh good luck getting a refill! 

I just want to old firefly service back, this is too commercial for me."}
{"text":"Fantastic food.  Wonderful service. Even though close to closing, food came out fast and everyone was  very helpful and nice. Only thing that kept the 5th star was some of the sauces tasted overdone."}
{"text":"Good friend of mine turned me onto this place, try to make it out there every time I'm in town..

Service typically seems good, never had a complaint..

The food is amazing here, I wish I could stuff myself more than possible..highly recommend Stuffed dates, don't think I've ever had dates before this place..Then there's a bunch of other great items, steak skewers with mushrooms are solid.

One thing I really hate about this place is it can get packed and wait times can be insanely long with no reservations."}
{"text":"I love this place!! I'm coming back here or sure next time I'm in Vegas. It was nice to eat somewhere off the strip!! The food was so good and the waiter was super nice. The drinks were pretty good too! If you just wanna get off the strip and have dinner; go to firefly!"}
{"text":"I love this place! This is the thrid time I have been to this location and it has yet to disappoint me. The one in summerlin just doesn't compare to this one, but I never get anything here that I don't like. Love the bacon wrapped dates and the mac and cheese really surprised me too. Can't ever go wrong with the red wine sangria either. Great atmosphere, good service, will continue to keep this as a top fIve on my list."}
{"text":"Love the new location! Clean & modern. Great service, the dates and steak salad are my favorite dishes. 


Only reason for 4 stars is they don't offer a medium size plate- just small bread plates and they are too small. Also, under out table the area was wet and dirty from the previous customers. 

A nice change from the busy strip!"}
{"text":"If you want a 5 star meal at a reasonable price you HAVE to stop here for dinner. We went down to Vegas for my wife's birthday on a foodie bender. We ate at some of the \"nicest\" places we could find (not trying to be snooty, just dropping a benchmark for everyone) Firefly was our favorite spot on our four day adventure. The service was outstanding and the food...ohhhh the food...

We started at the bar with the house infused vodka..I knew we were off to a good start when it hit the lips. I initially thought there couldn't be any vodka in it because it was so smooth and at six dollars, I guess I was still in the twelve dollar mind set for hotel rum and cokes. 

We were quickly seated by Irinia Omar, who became known as the Tapas wizard. We're passive aggressive in the fact that we like to order a few dishes and then have our server pick a few. There were four of us just to complicate things a little more. Some servers balk at this and are very hesitant to offer their opinion, let alone make the final call. After a few quick questions Irinia smiled and headed off. Then the onslaught of food began..the tomato bread followed by the tuna tartare, and chorizo plate set the stage in the chilled Tapas department, then the fun began. The stuffed dates, baked goat cheese, grilled octopus, spicy shrimp, scallops, empanadas, and lamb chops were to die for. We regret we didn't try at least one Paella (that was our choice ) but by the end when the desserts came out it really didn't matter. 

At this point in the night after the onslaught of tapas and a few samples of the cocktail list, we were now in a battle against the food. We had to almost force down the desserts, the tres leches and bread pudding won. 

The manager, Jon was very personable and friendly and made sure our group was taken care of and was overly apologetic when a group of twenty seated beside us quickly grew to the unplanned group of thirty and we volunteered to move tables to allow everyone to be seated.  Jon runs a very clean and efficient restaurant, and is quick to jump in and make sure his customers are enjoying themselves and are full. 

If your in Vegas and you want an awesome and unique meal put Firefly at the top of your list. You won't be sorry. I would put Firefly up against ANY of the other \"well known\" establishments in a food off any day."}
{"text":"Tried this place out with my wife. Seemed nice and I really wanted to like it. Our waiter was absent for the duration of our dining experience. Bread was stale and tough. The blood orange mojito was highly recommended to us so we decided to try it. For $30, I thought it would be savory. Unfortunately, it tasted like some juice mixture I made in high school. It was barely drinkable and tasted like bottom shelf liquor. Not worth the money. The food was just ok, for small plates, could have been better. I just wish the service had been better to reflect the food and create a better experience for us.  Menu is very boring and the ambiance is very pretentious.

This was the last time I visit this place, sad to say we you need to move on..."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years every time I stay in Vegas I try to come here to eat at the tapas. My favorite believe it or not is the filet mignon and the mushroom Chicken chorizo. By the way don't forget their bread and their butter it's also really good will continue to come love this place"}
{"text":"Excuse that i can't make any specific recommendations. We just closed our eyes and pointed at the menu. Everything we got was FANTASTIC.

The sangria wasn't too expensive (I think $15 for a pitcher?). After a quick dousing of that my friend and I were both feeling pretty good.

The waitress who helped was very cute, Eastern European I think. She was super-friendly and chatty, but we had to let her go to help other people. Service was prompt and the food came pretty fast for the entire evening.

The place was really loud, but at one point I made a comment to my friend about the food that the couple adjacent to us were eating. the gentleman at the other table willingly offered me his plate because he was full. Not really a +1 for the restaurant itself, but I suppose it's one for the crowd.

Overall, we ended up spending about $70 and left with full stomachs while feeling pretty wavy as well. Having arrived here from New York about 3 weeks ago, it's doubtful I could replicate this experience at that price where I'm from, but I find myself saying that a lot out here."}
{"text":"My cousin first took me here and introduced me to tapa style food. It was a nice treat because the prices are reasonable and I can try at least 3-4 different items and everything I have tried were delicious. Located off the strip in a cute corner location. Restaurant size is small but romantic with outside dining patio. Here is a list of things that I have tried and loved:

 Firefly*fries $5.50

[parmesan, herbs, aioli]  -- The cries are thinly cut traditional style - nice parmesan flavor and absolutely love the alioli sauce that comes with- i had to ask for extra.

Mushroom tart $6.50
[puff pastry, boursin cheese] - mm mm - mushrooms are nicely baked in puff pastry with warm boursin cheese nicely crisped on top.

 Manchego mac 'n' cheese  $8.00
[baked w/baby shells]  - I loved mac and cheese since I was a kid and like to try different variations of it. This was delicous!

Terra y Mare skewers $10
[grilled shrimp, filet mignon, chorizo sausage, salsa verde] - filet mignon on a stick???!! AWESOME!! .. comes with 2 skewers . didnt dig the chorizo sausage but I did like everything else!

I forgot what else I had. But this is a nice place to go to to try a few different things without breaking the bank. A nice place to go with a group of friends or a nice intimate dinner with your significant other. It does get crowded and booked up so I reccommend making a reservation.

THEY ALSO HAVE THE BEST SANGRIA! YOU HAVE GOT TO TRY IT."}
{"text":"Hell yes to Bacon Wrapped Dates!
Heck yeah to the Beet/Pear/Goat Cheese Salad...
AND to the Scallops done Escargot style. 
Eh on the Tuna Tartare; a little too stringy for my taste; but yummy to the tarot chips. 
Oh! and the Sangria, steeped for 3 days, is fantastic. Little edible pieces of fruit vs the 'here's  half an apple' you find in some pitchers. 
Lots more to try, we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant!  I highly recommend the stuffed dates, the blood orange mojitos and the tres leches cake is heavenly!!"}
{"text":"Come here for a party! LOL It was my first time having TAPAS and I came with 20 people.  Quite big location, I love the inside decor it's dimly light and has a red ambience to it. There's a huge bar in the center if you prefer ordering drinks or some small dishes asap. Servers were very friendly and accommodating. I was worried that since we had such a large group it would take a while for all our orders and it was a busy night but, absolutely no complaints! All food came out on great timing and was fresh and so delicious. I didn't get to post all pictures of everything I ordered because it was so good everyone ate it too quickly. 
**I recommend the stuffed dates & manchego macncheese #perfection 
Their paella is also very delicious! Order that first because it takes 40 min to cook and serves between 4-6 people. 
Overall it was so much fun for a birthday dinner/party  10/10 experience 
I'll definitely be back again with more friends, probably during their happy hour from 3-6"}
{"text":"Place is amazing. Great for a group meal. Lots of options and very accommodating. Def recommend this place for any meal."}
{"text":"Its been a favorite of ours for years. Having gone back recently after a while, it's a new location!!! Right next door to the original spot but upgraded in every way ;) hooray! Still amazing service, delicious sangrias, and goooood food."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! Super yummy food, great prices, and amazing atmosphere. Well worth the trip off the strip."}
{"text":"Oh wow!  Choco tres leches.  Brought 1/2 dozen buddies with me and we all had a blast, everyone was impressed.  Each dish was better than the last.  We'll definitely be back next month."}
{"text":"Love love love firefly ! 
I love all the different kinds of food they have to choose from....the waters are really nice and friendly and the food comes out quick ......
Thank you for great dining every time we come .....
And for anyone that might be second guessing about going because you might not find something for the little ones...We have 4 kids and they find something to eat every time we go ."}
{"text":"I always order red sangria (the best!), bacon wrapped dates (sweet and savory), shrimp ceviche (fresh and light), Mac n cheese, (cheesy and creamy), tres leches (flour less cake soaked in sweet milk! Mmm). I feel better it is a new location.  Our service this last time was extremely delayed.  She also forgot to put in an item. We did not receive it until we finished  eating everything else we ordered."}
{"text":"Wow! This place was a great find!

I had been told by my coworker to check this place out if we wanted to escape from the Vegas strip for a little while and this place did not disappoint! Incredible tapas, the perfect portions to share and the most delicious sangria! The bacon wrapped dates were amazing and I had the cheese fondue dip with chorizo that was out of this world!

You can tell that this place is filled with locals and it is such a great break from the intensity of Las Vegas. The atmosphere is fun but not overwhelming and filled with cigarette smoke. Our server Neo was wonderful and so attentive even though we had a very large, distracted group. When I'm back in Vegas I will definitely stop by again!"}
{"text":"Love the food here. Have been many times! Try the steak skewers, bacon wrapped dates, shrimp and much more! The only thing that is disappointing, when you order a red bull vodka and they serve you some crappy energy drink w vodka. Yet on their bar counter tops they have a Redbull logo? See attached picture. Maybe get rid of that if you can't service it."}
{"text":"Amazing! Came here for my birthday dinner celebration and had one of the best meals ever. Great food, drinks and vibes. Highly recommend and will definitely be back. Our sever, Eder, took amazing care of us and made the experience all the better."}
{"text":"Some of the best tapas I've ever eaten. Great prices, large menu, wonderful staff, etc. LOVED IT!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed Firefly from the many years I've been patronizing this business. However, now that they have released a Vegetarian and Vegan menu I am ecstatic about dining here all over again. The atmosphere is always fun and inviting, the food is delicious, and the alternative menu has many great options for those who are meat conscious."}
{"text":"Firefly was awesome - everything was delicious!!!
Here's what we had (we shared everything):
The garden salad
Roasted eggplant cannelloni
Albondigas
Empenada
Chicken & chorizo stuffed peppers
Steak & mushroom skewers
Firefly fish sticks
Fried calamari
Paella"}
{"text":"Came to this place because it was highly recommended by locals and I was not disappointed. Don't let the strip mall fool you, the restaurant ambience is great! I ordered the following:

Bacon Wrapped Stuffed Dates- delicous. I can't remember what it was stuffed with but it had bacon and I was sold! Anyways as you bite into the date, you get this all kinds of wonderful flavors in perfect harmony

Filet Mignon Sliders- These came with little onion straws and some type of aoili on it.  The meat was a little bit dry but not too bad

Tomato Basil Soup- this was accompanied with a grilled cheese sandwich and the soup had a very good balance of tarteness and creaminess

Parmesan Fries- cooked to perfection, not greasy and was a nice portion size

Lobster Escargots- these were not tasty! They tasted frozen and thawed with a very bad flavor. I bit into it and a bunch of water poored out, not recommended

Panko Breaded Fish- fish did not taste fresh and again, not recommended

Overall, restaurant and service was good. I would definitely return but I will stay away from the seafood tapas."}
{"text":"I'm an avid firefly food-lover so I was happy (oh, and my stomach was too) to find out that they didn't close down. They literally just moved down the street! The new place looks great and service was awesome! And, most importantly no change in food quality! 

Same great food but new and improved place! Where all the locals go and you can chill with friends over tapas and sangria! What can be better? Definitely a spot to hit up during your stay at Vegas!"}
{"text":"I love all about this place. I always order from tapas menu. Yes, it is tapas but it will fill u up. 
I almost try all their tapas menu, moving forward to the entree soon. As of their cocktail, it always good."}
{"text":"We ordered Stuffed pepper, Patatas Bravas and Chicken tinga empanadas and they were fantastic.. I can definitely say one of the best tapas to try in Vegas.  Drinks?.. Do try their Sangrias (Sprakling and Red) .."}
{"text":"Thank you, Yelpers, for helping us find this restaurant.  What a great place! Eight of us went for a birthday celebration on August 19.   So how do you do tapas for 8 people?  Order one of nearly everything, cut it up to share bites and then just order more of whatever was favored.  The table was seriously overflowing with food.  

The big favorites for our table were the Manchego Mac n Cheese, the Lamb chops (my 12 year old wanted her own order),  Stuffed Dates,  Terra y Mare skewers and Ham and Cheese Croquetas.   We also had the Firefly fish sticks, Fried Calamari, Camarones a la diabla, Camarones al ajillo, filet mignon sliders, crispy duck rolls, Baked Tetilla and Albondigas.  I know we had more but I can't remember.  I just recall enjoying every bite and being so full that we couldn't try dessert.   Oh, wait, they did bring a flan for the birthday guest.  Tasty!!

This will be a regular stop on our Vegas trips whether for sangria, mojitos and few bites, or to pig out like we did.   For me personally, I'll order the Manchego Mac n Cheese, the lamb chops and the Terra y Mare skewers again and then I'll try some of the other items and work my way through the menu.  Next time I'm definitely trying the Roasted Eggplant Canneloni - just no room for it this time.  

Tapas was a new concept for my mom.  She couldn't quite understand small plates of food to share.  I told her it was like Spanish dim sum and she instantly understood.   

For those of you new to the concept of tapas - start with just two or three menu items to share and hold on to a menu.  Try it.  Like it?  Order another or try something else.  You could seriously just keep ordering another item, and then another, and then another.   My 9 and 12 year olds even enjoyed it.   Good food - nothing pretentious or fancy, just good comfort-style food.."}
{"text":"I'm giving a revised 5 stars to Firefly, not based upon the merits of a second visit (we haven't been back), but because of the stellar customer service provided by the manager in a recent series of emails and phone calls.

I was delighted and surprised that the manager (Dave) read and responded to my less than positive review.  We had the most amazing conversation wherein we shared our thoughts and views about customer service, expectations of customers and how he trains his staff to deliver the best experience possible.

It was very clear to me that he is committed to not only the restaurant and his employees, but to providing an outstanding experience to every guest.

He extended a very warm invitation to visit again, which we plan to do.  Although Vegas is not only our schedule for 'weekend flings', we'll definitely be back to enjoy a meal and I'm confident I'll be able to post a much more positive and happy YELP!

Marcy."}
{"text":"Sehr leckeres spanische Küche. Viele Tampas......und kleinere Gerichte........sehr freundliches Personal 
Geheimtipp für Vegas"}
{"text":"This place has plenty of 5 star reviews and I have to agree.  Everything was excellent. we had the fried shrimp, pan seared tilapia, ahi tuna skewers, fries, mac and cheese, and tres leches cake as well as two mojitos.  Lot's of fresh mint in the mojitos.  Great lively atmosphere. If you are staying on The Strip the food quality and price make it well worth the cab fare over. On a slow night limo drivers will circle through the strip mall like taxi's.  We caught a very nice ride back to the Aria for $20. Dinner check was $65."}
{"text":"So this is their new location, the other one on Paradise got closed down because their food had salmonella. 

The new location looks fabolous!! its really nice and intimate inside and the bar is really pretty. We went here for a birthday party and they served the red sangria, omg to die for. Really good and lots of fruits. They also served artichoke hearts on sourdough bread really good. Bacon wrapped dates omg this is the best thing i ever tried. So yuumy. they also order the beef kabobs, the meat was really tender and not chewy. For dessert we had the tres leches chocoalate cake. OMG OMG!! seriously..First time i ever had a tres leches cake and omg i freaking love it. You have to try it. 

The waiters were really good on making sure my water was full and to take the dirty dishes away. Really good service and i would deff recommend this place. 

Lets just hope they don't close down again. 

FYI the Firefly in Anthem is closing because they got a C grade. YIKES!"}
{"text":"I've tried to keep this my little secret since 2010.. This is the one and only mandatory restaurant when I'm in the area, mainly for 3 things: sparking sangria, paella, and the creamy dip and olives with garlic bread you get when you are seated. 

RECOMMENDATIONS (why I give this place 5 stars):

Sparkling sangria- heaven's gift for sangria lovers who like a fruitier, fizzier and lighter version of the drink. $7 a glass or $28 a pitcher. 

Paella- the best I've had up to date (and I've tried many in SF). The amount of saffron is usually perfect, very savory with a bit of sour, and there is always a generous amount of seafood, chicken and sausage. The rice is soft, chewy and well-spiced. 

Filet mignon sliders- the boyfriend's favorite. These are mini burgers with medium-rare beef and the most amazing cheese sauce, Fried caramelized onions on the side.

Steamed mussels- a big plate of mussels bathed in a delicious wine sauce.

Garden variety salad- so fresh and bursting with flavors of feta cheese, orange and dried cherries with vinaigrette. The baby beet salad and warm spinach salad are really good as well. 

OTHER NOTES:

Baked filets of tilapia- way too sour but if you like a heavy lemon taste with several slices of healthy fish, go for it. 

Crispy duck roll- not recommended, super salty. Leave the \"hoisin\" sauce to Asian places.

Chicken and chorizo stuffed mushrooms- five cute little bite-size mushrooms that don't particularly wow me, but the boyfriend likes the taste combination. 

I have heard that the stuffed dates are well-liked.. will try next time.


I love that Firefly is consistent in its service, presentation and quality for the items I like to order. Also, this place is completely reasonably-priced for what it offers."}
{"text":"No complaints here. Groupon has a $79 deal for 2 pitchers of Sangria and 8 tapas. Ceviche apple salad and calamari were muy bueno."}
{"text":"This place is definitely a favorite of mine! When ever someone asks for a good place to go or i have family or friends visit this is the place i recommend. The environment is beautiful! You can dress up or down for this place. Service is wonderful, food and drinks are DELICIOUS!!! LOVE, LOVE, LOVE coming here!!!"}
{"text":"Consistently great quality.... Especially love the one on Paradise! Great selection of tapas and awesome sparkling sangria!"}
{"text":"Very good service and flavors. A full menu. Perhaps a bit noisy."}
{"text":"amazing food! seriously! so damn good. the service is also excellent. cocktails are delicious! BEST TAPAS EVER!"}
{"text":"We made a reservation for my first time here. Arrived 5 min before reservation and was seated 5 min after reservation time. We ordered the fried calamari, Chicago beef bocadillos, and the mixed paella. The bocadillos were okay, too salty for my taste. The paella was delicious! The rice was cooked perfectly, and I loved the flavor of the dish. The service was excellent. Had refills before I could even ask! I really appreciated the attentiveness and friendliness of all the servers. Only downside was that the atmosphere was very loud with the music, and it can sometimes be hard to hear."}
{"text":"Love the food here and the eviroment, however the staff sucks! They took forever to get out orders and refilling our drinks. Service or taste for me."}
{"text":"I am a little torn on this one. I love tapas because I can never decide between 2 or 3 things, but the price seems a little high! I recommend the Chicago beef bocadillos, stuffed dates, and the apple manchengo salad. 

Their sangria and mojito pitchers are the best bang for your buck but are still a little overpriced. One pitcher of sangria is $30. If you have 3 people, I guess that isn't that bad.

Overall, it is a great place to hang out and get some food."}
{"text":"While driving on Paradise Road on the way to the Cosmopolitan to check out China Poblano 2 weeks ago, I saw this resto's and it immediately reminded of when my co-worker told me about this place. So, I made a u-turn and my wife and I ate dinner her instead. We had the following:

Smoked salmon bagels $9

Patatas Bravas $7

Fried Calamari $10

Ahi Tuna Skewer $10

Chicken Tinga Empanada $7

Vanilla Yogurt Mousse $7

First of all, we were told that this is a spanish style resto with emphasis on tapas. All of the food tasted pretty good. The bagels were great mostly bc the bagels were toasted perfectly and that caper dill cream was pretty tasty. The patatas bravas was pretty much an elegant version of roasted potatoes. I wish the friend calamari came with a acidic sauce like a tomato-based sauce bc eating it with tartar sauce can get pretty heavy. The Ahi Tuna Skewer was the best tasting dish for me. The ginger soy glaze on it actually reminded me more of Hawaii than Spain.  The Empanada was pretty good...light and fluffy and not greasy at all. Im glad it came with a side salad. The vanilla yogurt mousse was ok. It was like not as heavy melted ice cream mixed with fruit. The crispy sugar cookie sticks that came with it were probably one of the best cookies i've ever tasted and made a good dipping partner for the mousse. Overall, I would say this place is pretty good. I'll be back to try their paellas and update this review...."}
{"text":"The only criticism is that it is very loud... hence the 4 stars. We ordered from every category 
Chilled- ceviche of shrimp, my daughter liked it however I did not like all of the lime flavor, but that's a ceviche, the shrimp was huge and in abundance so if that's your thing order it
Hot- manche go Mac n cheese. Delicious and creamy very tasty for a mac n cheese
Seafood-our favorite!!! Scallops escargot, everything about it was delicious we even put the remaining sauce on the Mac n cheese we loved it so much.
Meat and poultry- steak and mushroom skewers ordered medium they are very tasty with lots of flavor and very tender. 

Mojito and Sangria was nice and refreshing"}
{"text":"LOVED this restaurant! I have never done the tapas style dinning and I really liked it! I got to try so much more from the menu and let me tell you its heavenly! Next time I'm in Vegas I am definitely stopping here!"}
{"text":"Hard to get a seat on the weekends, call ahead. Very loud. View is great. Great place to start an evening downtown. Many unique tapas. My favorite are the stuffed peppers, crispy duck rolls, and veggie empanadas. Be careful not to go nuts and spent a ton. The sangrias are great."}
{"text":"Goodness on a little plate, or two, or three.

I had the Tuna Tartare and calamari; both are great.  Service was great, very helpful and suggestions were on point.

It's off the strip, so prices are reasonable and not crazy busy.

Would go again, just to try more plates.

Cheers and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Came on a monday afternoon for lunch. and it was delicious! 

I've only had tapas twice and there was not a thing we ordered that was not full of flavor and savored each and every bite. 

We oredered:

Tuna Peppers: Sweet with a little kick. loved the different testures of this dish

ceviche of shrimp: i didnt eat it, cause im not a fan of the shrimp. but my friends loved it

stuffed dates: Hands down my fave dish of the afternoon. it was sweet and savory and tongasmic. Bacon, cheese, dates and a piece of nut in the center. How can you not love??


Veggie & pork Empanadas: the veggie one was great and didnt feel like you were eating veggies wrapped in fried dough. it was smooth and great flavor. The pork was good but the veggie was my fave

Camarones a la diabla: i didnt eat  the shrimp cause im not a fan of the shrimp, but the sauce that came with  it was  superb! we requested more bread and i lathered it up with the sauce and inhaled it! 

Albondigas: i love meatballs but i had better. the meat was a bit tough and not as succulant as meatballs should be. but it had delicious flavor. just the texture of the meatballs turned me off

Lamb skewers:  meat was a bit dry but non the less delicious! must eat with the mushroom, the sauce and the veggies  all together!


Filet mignon sliders: yum yum yum!


def will come back when im back in vegas!"}
{"text":"The sangria is excellent, the appetizers I had during a tour event stop were also freshly made and delicious. The appetizers and drinks were complimentary to the tour event that I was on. Many kinds of food types for all tastes were available.

I would go back with no more than four people. The restaurant seems to have a smaller overall space and it gets very busy starting on Friday, lasting through the weekend. I would also only do a late lunch or a super early dinner because the restaurant quickly fills up starting at dinner time.

If this location is super busy, you may also visit their second location in the Downtown Las Vegas Fremont Street Experience."}
{"text":"I was really craving this place when I last visited Las Vegas! Specifically, I was craving the bacon wrapped dates and sangria. I was so disappointed when I heard about the health code issues at the Henderson location, so I was happy to see that this location was good to go. 

We ordered a plethora of dishes, all of which were very delicious! However, they are so overpriced that it was hard to make sure the small party I was with got even a taste of each dish. Some of the small dishes had only 2 pieces! For $10-ish dollars, I think that's a bit ridiculous. I simply couldn't afford to eat here with more than one or two people, because that adds up quickly. 

I love the interior of this restaurant. It is a pleasant place to be! I especially love the patio, although it was closed the last time I was there. 

Overall, this would be a good restaurant for a date, but, in my and my wallets opinion, not so great for a party of multiple people because you would need multiple plates of the same item. The bacon covered dates and sangria are must haves."}
{"text":"Celebrated a co worker's birthday dinner here. Spanish tapas that was a fun way to try the large menu selection. Overall, great service that accommodated large party (13+) and the food came fast and furious. Fan favorites were paella, tuna tartare, bacon wrapped dates, and many more!"}
{"text":"==Vegas Birthday weekend continued==
Feb 18th-Feb 21st

The first to arrive in Vegas were the three Chris'. Christian (christiang.yelp.com) Cebo (cbooz.yelp.com) and myself. After getting settled in our room and having a few drinks to start off the trip, we decided to grab a bite to eat here at Firefly. Christian has been here before so he suggested it. Great pick my friend!

GOOD:
- Various items to choose from. Great menu.
- Bar. While waiting for a table, decided to grab a few jack and cokes.
-Firefly fries (parmesan, herbs, aioli) Who doesn't love fries!? 
- Terra y Mare skewers (grilled shrimp, filet mignon, chorizo sausage, salsa verde) Came with 3 skewers. Another good choice.
- Fried calamari (spicy gribiche dipping sauce) One of my faves. I mean who can resist deep fried rings that resemble foreskin!? Squeeze some lemon all over and you're set.

BAD:
- Right when the waiter comes up and asks what we want to drink, this is how the conversation starts:
Waiter: \"what can I get you fellas to drink?\"
Dude: \"Oh, I like your hair!\" (he had an awesome mohawk with designs shaved on the side)
Waiter: \"oh thank you, I like yours too!\"
Dude: *looks at his friends* (they are already clowning) \"what!? it was the first thing i noticed!\"

What an awkward way to start the dinner. Nothing wrong with complimenting a guy on his hair. The compliment from the waiter talking about how he likes my hair set up a whole night of ridicule. 
Yes the \"dude\" was me and yes the waiter liked my bald head, big deal. 

UGLY:
- Firefly. The name of the place. Had us singing this song all night. 
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psuRGfAaju4
But instead our version sounded like this.

You would not believe your eyes
If 100 real buff guys
was the last thing you saw as you fell asleep

Why did we stop and stare? 
These buff guys are everywhere
Are we at excalibur?
Oh wells, We don't really care

I'd like to make myself believe
That one guy danced slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay
Awake when I'm asleep
Cause everytime he dances you get weak!

'Cause we'd give a thousand hugs
Hugs from these SD thugs
Our hugs are equivalent to turbuLANCE

Why is this in our heads?
Maybe we should go to bed
Please don't jump on yelp and start a thread

I'd like to make myself believe
That this room is turning slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay
Awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems
We should go to sleep!!


Why did that song come out that way?? After a few drinks, ok maybe after A LOT of drinks and always seeing THUNDER FROM DOWN UNDER ads you know why that came out that way!

When you do Vegas with us, be prepared for some great laughs. That's how we do!!"}
{"text":"excellent service and great tasting food.

just came back from Spain and I must say their tapa dishes taste better then few restaurants I've tried in Spain.

ordered

tun a tartare--love the taro chips

stuffed dates

baked cod

scallops escargot

chicken chorizo stuffed mushroom

desert platter-------amazing! love everything on the platter!"}
{"text":"We were here, again, in between appointments and everything was awesome as usual. My only complaint would be that sitting inside of the restaurant doesn't feel as classy as it did sitting on the nice patio. The booths/tables seem older and just don't match with the quality of food. This time we tried the stuffed peppers that were great as well as a chicken dish that was just amazing. My lamb rocked, just as it always does!"}
{"text":"Firefly is one of those great places in Vegas that's off the Strip which means tourists don't know about it unless they go with a local. They have a great selection of tapas that you don't normally see in most places like Iberico and Ba Ba Reba, and the prices are very reasonable. The first time I went there were 5 people in our group and I don't think we spent $90, and that included drinks. It's a great spot for something different than the usual Strip spots."}
{"text":"Ay Caramba!!!!

I Love This Place!!!!

On our last stop through SinCity before heading out to the airport, my friends and I decided to check out this off-strip Yelp favorite. With over 1,000 reviews, Firefly has scored an impressive 4.5 star average out of five, no easy feat I might add!

Well, it goes without saying that I came with high expectations. Luckily, I was not disappointed...whew!

Upon stepping into the bustling restaurant, i heard rhythmic salsa music being played in the background and it had a very familar Latin cantina vibe to it, which felt casual and fun. With lots of red and orange all around my hankering for tasty tapas became even more amplified!

We were seated conveniently by the large window, which let in a good amount of natural lighting (excellent for foodporn) and spacious enough for us to stow our luggage.

Our server was friendly and helpful with the menu and never pushy or rude.  Within moments of ordering, we got some sliced baguettes drizzled with butter and served with pickled olives and a house butter spread. The bread was warm & crisp and house butter was delicious! 

Then came our drinks and tapas!

I must insist that you try the blood orange mojito. You can taste that the blood orange was deeply infused in this amazing drink and the combination of the refreshing mint makes this exhilarating drink all the more enjoyable! Of course, the sangrias here are phenomenal and also a must if you're going to enjoy tapas here, as well.

Now onto the tapas...

Bacon Wrapped dates with smoked almonds red wine reduction and blue cheese crumbles were remarkably good! Crisp bacon wrapped around sweet dates and tooped with fragrant blue cheese crumbles is always a winning combination in my book!

Tuna tartare - the marinated tuna had a tangy Asian flare that had hints of soy, lime & chili...enjoyed on crisp taro chips, it was a delicious contrast of textures and flavors that made this tartare a shining success!

Tierra Y Mar Skewers - Grilled Shrimp, Filet Mignon, Chorizo, Salsa Verde - from the plump shrimp to the juicy filet, each morsel on the skewer was cooked perfectly. Tack on the the tangy  kick of the salsa verde and it was a virtual fiesta in the mouth! 

Duck rolls - Crisp and delicious fried wonton wrapped around tender pieces of succulent braised duck and dressed in a very tangy sweet hoisin sauce, almost too cloyingly sweet but overall, very tasty.

Filet Mignon sliders - Served with a very rich Serrano ham, cabrales cheese sauce and caramelized onions this dish was probably the most disappointing as the burgers were cooked well done leaving them without the awesome pink center I love so much. Because they were well done, they were chewier and less tender juicy and flavorful 

Camarones la diabla - Now this dish was a winner! Bursting with bright flavor and beautifully presented in a fiery red sauce, the plump shrimp were generously dressed with a sauce that creeped up slowly but left a spicy kick at the end of each bite...yum!

Ceviche - Loaded with plump shrimp, this dish came with loads of crunchy tortilla chips and buttery avocado. My only gripe would be that it needed some some spice to kick it up a notch. Nothing a lil Tabasco couldn't fix which our lovely server remedied for us upon request.

For dessert - We enjoyed a caramel flan with a lady finger and it was the perfect end to a delightful meal!

Our server also arranged cab service for us which arrived in record time!

I highly recommend Firefly to anyone looking for a great lunch or evening out with friends. The restaurant is fun, the service is friendly and the food is fantastic!

Happy Eats!"}
{"text":"Can't give an accurate review as we just got drinks and then went to Batista's later that night. Drinks were good and strong....will update when I try the food, service was good."}
{"text":"In the words of the effervescent and poorly dress MC Hammer this place is: Two legit, two legit to quit! Hey, hey! Two legit, two legit to quit! Hey, hey!

Located in a strip mall near the Las Vegas Convention Center, it would be very easy to overlook Firefly and run off to its more glamorous competitors...but I'm so happy we took a cab to enjoy this local favorite. The atmosphere at Firefly has a friendly and slightly frantic feel to it as it's packed to the brim with a mix of tourists and locals. We waited by the bar and met some really nice people who we chatted with and they offered us some of their food. Wow, how nice is that?!

We were seated about 5 minutes after we arrived and were taken outside to another door which opened to the other half of the restaurant. I guess they expanded but didn't knock down the wall in between. We didn't really care, we were just happy to get a table quickly! 

As other reviewers have written the small plates can get pricey, especially if you've got a YELP sized appetite, but the food is delish! We ordered 10 different dishes and all you have to know is three words: Bacon wrapped dates. Do it, do it right now you fool!

Yelp 365 Challenge: #48/365 (The Dates)"}
{"text":"My wife and I had a great meal here. This location has some unique flavor combinations that I would recommend to all. Starting with the bread they serve with all plates included roasted red pepper infused butter. Awesome!! Stuffed picquillo peppers with a garlic cream cheese over a tomato sauce. Wow!! Chicken tinga empanadas are a must try. While Spanish food is not generally spicy the tinga sauce does have a bite to it. I do like eating spicy food and requested something hot to complete my meal. The server,Mario, had no problem with the request and brought back roasted and chopped sorrano peppers. Really good customer service. This is another one of my must try locations to all of you visiting Vegas."}
{"text":"Thank you thank you thank you Yelp. 

As soon as I walked into the Las Vegas airport I knew this city would its hardest to convince me that I wanted its flashiest, loudest, and scantily-scandalousy-est. Well ha! I have Yelp. Does *your* iPhone app save you from one of the grossest cities on earth? 

Because of Yelp, I knew to forget the Bellagio buffet. Skip the Paris buffet. Avoid the Wynn. I actually really wanted to go to Lotus of Siam, which somehow both Gourmet magazine and the LA Times think is the best Thai in America, but reservations were booked through the weekend and drop-in wait was 2 hours. And I hadn't scammed any guy into taking me to Joel Robuchon. 

Enter Firefly. Convinced a childhood friend and his buddies to come here, and it turned out to be the perfect choice. Not too pricey, about $30 per. Only an $8 cab ride away from the strip, and no wait. 

Sangria: A must-have with tapas. Obviously. This was watered-down approximately 4X normal. It took me half a glass to get drunk! 

Bacon-wrapped stuffed dates: Yummy signature dish. The crispy texture and saltiness of the bacon paired well with the sweet, chewy date and creamy nutty stuffing. 

Frites: I love frites. These were pretty good, better than room service but not as good as Chez Maman. Delicious aioli. 

Baked brie: Eh. Not bad, not outstanding. 

Steamed mussels with chorizo: I was not expecting this to be a soup. Sour, tomato-y, tangy, so I liked it a lot. 

Tuna tartare: Probably the worst thing we ordered. Ew.

Mac & cheese with manchego: I wouldn't have ordered this and the brie, but one of the guys is really into cheesy things. It was ok. 

Spicy shimp: Super spicy = awesome! The shrimp wasn't that fresh though."}
{"text":"Place is outstanding! Great for groups! Bacon wrapped dates are to die for. Tapas portions are small, so order more than one of each. Every meat option they serve is incredible. Nice to get off the strip for a really delicious meal and some peace and quiet."}
{"text":"There's only one thing that's bad about this place...  the wait!  This food is as good as it gets and at a fraction of the price you will pay for the big names on the strip.  Its not an elegant dining room, its tight and usually a bit noisy, but the food is AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME.  If you've never eaten here, shame on you.  Come in and order a variety of dishes and you will be BLOWN AWAY by all of them!  Words can't describe the wonderful flavors on the menu.  I moved to Vegas from Orange County just so  I could eat here all the time!"}
{"text":"this is my first time at Firefly and in my opinion the ambience was great the crowd seemed to be having a fantastic time the service was respectful punctual and consistent I would definitely recommend this place again and again the food was amazing"}
{"text":"The food, the drinks, the ambiance, the staff, the place, the price... oh, how I just love this place! I go here once a week. I love this place! A MUST TRY!"}
{"text":"It's Kevin B.'s birthday and we're going to Firefly for dinner! I haven't been to Firefly for YEARS and I've never been to this location, only the Paradise one waaaaaaaaaaaay back when. 
This location is a lot roomier than the Paradise spot and it is better for accommodating large parties... and we were a LARGE party! We had a bunch of tables put together in the middle of the restaurant and the more people that came, the more tables they added on. I have to say, the staff, especially our server JOSHUA, were all VERY accommodating, nice and friendly, and were super nice about getting us more tables, getting the food out to us, spread out all over the table, clearing the table and getting us drinks and water! Everything was just as tasty as I remember, especially the SHRIMP DIABLO! I could just eat this ALL day and order all the bread in the place to soak up the DELICIOUS sauce!! NOM NOM NOM! The main thing I wanted waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaas the Red Sangria!! This is THE best! It's the thing I look forward THE most at this place! When I think Firefly, I think SANGRIA. FREAAAAKIN' DELICIOUS!!!!!"}
{"text":"Food was good, sangria was great, service was excellent. Went here for lunch. The atmosphere lends itself to be an upscale place in how it's lit and decorated but there are hints of being a bit like just a bar (smell, colors, etc). Overall, it was a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Almost everything we ordered was delicious, and we ordered around 15 tapas. This place is a gem, especially for overpriced food served at big hotels in Las Vegas. I hope Firefly on Paradise will stay true to their quality and continue serving delicious food. Next time we are in LV we will definitely come back with our friends.

The only negative is Citrus Bliss drink ($10) -- they have to improve their cocktails if they expect people to order more of them. This one had very artificial taste, as if they added dry 20 cents mix to it so we just put it aside. In house made white wine sangria was fresh and tasty, but I would prefer it with less ice in a pitcher.

The amazing thing about ordering tapas is that you don't have to commit to a huge meal which can be hit or miss. Instead, you order a lot of different tapas for the table and have fun sampling differed food. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"My all time favorite restaurant in Vegas!
Great customer service and amazing food. 
Order the sangria by the pitcher for sure. 
The bacon dates are delicious but I've really never ordered anything I didn't love. You have to try the truffle fries, they are so good and great for sharing with the table. 

Make a reservation, they get really busy on weekends or when there are conventions in town. The wait has been well over 2 hours before."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch since everyone recommends it. Now we see why. Great fast service snd amazing delicious food!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Its very fun and lively atmosphere. Plus I love tapas and according to Vil which has try almost every dish here said they are all good. We had to order the Paella, Veggie Empenadas, and Tuna Tartar. We end up ordering a pitcher of white sangria too. The Veggie Empenadas was taste and was fried perfectly. Tuna Tartar was just okay to me but it was not bad. The Paella was the best, Vil and I could not get enough of it. The white sangria was tasty and refreshing. Yes among two girls, we finish the pitcher. We also made friends with the bartenders. We met Rico, Hector, and Ray. Vil liked to call Rico - Rico Savvy. Yes we had good times here. Will be back for sure next time in Vegas."}
{"text":"I've got three words for you: Sangria, Sangria, Sangria. If for nothing else, Firefly is worth it just for this. 
I like tapas style, allowing you to try many different dishes, and Firefly has a good selection to choose from. I try to stay away from bread/pasta as much as possible and there are still plenty of options. And any of their locations are good. 
Why a 3-star you ask? It's a good consistent place, but food quality lacks for me to be able to give it a higher rating. I usually keep my higher ratings for grass-fed beef, free range chicken, organic option places. 
For lunch I get the chicken salad tapa, which is plenty for me. For dinner, it's a great place to go with friends. My top favs that I always gravitate to are: the Firefly fries (addicting), stuffed dates (very addicting), chicken skewers and petit filet. 
Drink Menu: White or Red Sangria, can't go wrong! Goes down like kool-aid. Not a fan of Sangria? They also have an excellent Pomegranate Martini."}
{"text":"Yay!  I'm a big fan!  I will definitely be back here the next time I'm in Vegas and will certainly recommend to all my friends.  Awesome vibe, reasonably priced and the drinks are sooo good.  I've never had white sangria before but one of my friends recommended it to me and so glad she did.  It was tasty and sweet and, as they say on their website, it gave me maximum enjoyment.   This place is excellent for lunch, dinner or happy hour with 50% off all drinks.  Or just stay here all day and enjoy all 3 meals of the day (yes, happy hour in my book is a meal.)

As for food, my friends and I had the stuffed dates, ham and cheese croquettes, crispy duck roll, chicken and chorizo stuffed mushroom and the merguez (spicy lamb sausage, tomato-pepper confit and grilled bread).  I could pass on the croquettes and duck roll but loved the dates, chicken/chorizo and the merguez.  Hmmmm....oh so good.  I think back on all of these oh so fondly.  I'm reading about the mac n' cheese from the other reviewers and I can't believe I missed that one - I think I was just so excited about all the yummy choices, I inexplicably overlooked it (shameful).  

Highly recommend this place.  If you're tired of the other cheap options on the strip or can't afford to go to all of the nice places for every meal (incl happy hour), go to Firefly.  It'll be worth your while."}
{"text":"This place is just awesome. The food and the vibe here are always good.

I've been here on multiple occasions. This place just never seems to disappoint.

Nicely decorated interior. Place was packed. Nice vibe. Very loud. Very large interior with small tables and booths. So be sure to make a reservation. 

Service was good. The waiter didn't balk at our massive order for two. Be careful though when ordering the Paella. It takes a long time to cook.

We ordered the entire menu it seemed liked:

Combo Paella - Bomb! But takes forever to come out. Order in the beginning. 

Stuffed Dates - Fire!

Tuna Poke with Chips - really good

Serrano Ham - really good

Fruit and Cheese platter - So good, I don't know why it's on the dessert menu

Beef empanada - Fire!

BBQ ribs - Fire

Lamb Chops - Bomb!

Han Croquettes - Would have been good but were cold

Fried Calamari - Good

Ricotta cheese served hot - Fire!

Steak/Shrimp/Pork skewers - So Good

Mushroom Pastry - Ok

Bread pudding - Really Good

Nutella sandwiches - ok

Ice cream - Really Good!

Red sangria - Bomb 

Overall a great place"}
{"text":"Great place, really happening.  We found a spot in the bar area.  It was around 7:30 p.m.  and it was crowded.  We had a few tapas, I loved the stuffed dated and one of the stuffed peppers.  Also the steak tapas were really good.  I ordered a Ginger Pear martini, very nice.  This place gets pretty loud, but still fun.  Service was good, my husband loves this place, he brings people every time he is in town, so it was my turn, haha."}
{"text":"Chicken paella was mostly all rice, empanada was extremely oily, and salty and the pork stuffing was overcooked and dry. Service was ok, sangria was good. 
Won't be back."}
{"text":"Delicious tapas!  Last time I went was about a year ago and I can't really remember what I ordered, but I know that everything I had was good!  

Amazing sangria!  Definitely order it.

It gets kinda loud in there which makes it hard to talk sometimes, so keep that in mind if you're on a first date or something. :)  Pretty cool place with a table area and a lounge area with couches.  

Probably best to go with 3+ people to share tapas!"}
{"text":"We really loved our dinner here... 

the only thing would be that we felt slightly rushed to eat and all of our tapas were brought out at once to our tiny table... it would've been truly perfect if we were able to eat more slowly without the fear of everything getting cold. I would order things spaced apart next time,

AMAZING FOOD! To start with the almond type butter in the bread basket. They also agreed to some of my special requests... so. nice.

Our favorite was the stuffed mushrooms & the stuffed peppers. TO DIE FOR. The tilapia was brilliant and the salads were HUGE. 

Red Sangria (which is a 4 day process) came in a large pitcher and did NOT disappoint!  We really wanted to try their house-made infused vodk, but they were out. 

This place definitely lives up to the hype. GO! And affordable!"}
{"text":"Came here early on a Sat night before a show at Brooklyn Bowl. Arrived around 6pm and although the large dining room looked like it had space, we opted for bar seating and found seats immediately.  The tapas here are at least twice the size of a normal order and easy to share. We enjoyed a bottle of wine, the bacon wrapped dates, pork empanada, clams and chorizo, the octopus, and the lamb chops. Every option was cooked to perfection and delicious! We made the mistake of ordering a little too much just because of the portion size being larger than anticipated. It provided the substance we needed before a night of drinking at a concert. The icing on the cake.. our wine and feast were all for under $100!  I think I just broke $100 with a $20 tip. We will definitely be back because the service at the bar was fantastic, the food was on point, and because there is so much more that we would love to taste from this menu.  Off the beaten path.. and well worth it!!"}
{"text":"Visited again on trip with wife ,who is one tough person to impress, and firefly did it.  She had fun and enjoyed the food."}
{"text":"I love this place for their sangria ! 
I would always hang out with my husband to have drinks . Tonight we came for dinner . We had a bad experience with our sever,  Irineo . He would talk to us but was always looking away , was in a rush to take our order .  But our busser Jaime was very attentive to us . Brought us water , was always around to see if we needed something . While our server was sitting down at a table. Which I believe was his friends table . Didn't care to come around at all . My husband and I are also servers so we know how this industry is . I wish we could have more people / servers like Jaime, that's are very humble and care about customer service !"}
{"text":"must add was there last Tuesday and now the skinny drinks they have added are awesome!! Could sip on them all night. And the Tuna Tar Tar  and mancheco mac n cheese shut the front french doors DELISCIOUS!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is great! Fast, delicious and good service 

Highly recommend the sangria, albondigas, boquerones, and stuffed figs. 

Empanada was good. 

Tuna tartare was okay, as well as the gelato."}
{"text":"Tapa Delight

The Gist:

*A random strip mall with pretty intense restaurants that inhabit the place
*Cute little lounge
*I think the table an inch away is eavesdropping...
*Pitchers of sangria- too bad I'm driving straight to Cali right after!
*Small dish of olives & \"croutons\" came out to entice the palate 
*Ceviche & both kinds of empanadas were good
*Servers were nice & cleared out plates efficiently 

My quick visit cost me about $23 for three small plates. I'll probably want to give this place another shot to taste the \"must-haves\" of the menu...but that depends on if anyone else is in the mood for some tapas."}
{"text":"Neil our server was really attentive and friendly. I'm only giving 3 stars because the food was just ok. I felt like every dished lacked something. It was alright. Nothing special. Met up with a friend. we got two cocktails, the fries, meatballs, and apple salad off happy hour. I ordered the tuna tartare off happy hour. It was good, but like I said nothing special."}
{"text":"We had a large group of 7 and we wanted to avoid the strip prices on our recent vegas trip.  This place is recommended by all of my local friends and very close to the strip.  We were really happy because they serve food until 2am.  We showed up at 11p.  There was a short wait for a table so we opted to put 2 tables together in the lounge.  The lounge area has lower tables and small ottoman looking stools to sit on which are pretty comfortable.

There was light music in background..and we started with 2 ptichers of sparkling sangria.  It was amazing!  They marinate they sangria for 3 days minimum.  

Here is what we ordered:
*Tuna tartare...fresh mixed w avocado and served w taro chips - very good
*Shrimp diablo... good kick slightly sweet - good not amazing
*Firefly fries - awesome!
*Stuffed dates..not for those watching waist but delicious - delicious! one of my favorites
*Ceviche shrimp super bland just taste of lime - would not order again
*Salsa verde chorizo shrimp skewers - one of my favorites
*Filet sliders...covered in scallion blue cheese w a home made mayo with slight kick of cayenne.  THese were good but not amazing.  I was surprised because they had such good reviews.  They come with some fried onions.  The bun was crisp so it is a well executed dish, I just wanted better flavor. 
*Steak skewers w mushroom..sauce is quite bland, parlsey.  Steak cooked to a perfect medium rare - good for a simple eater.
*Mac and cheese excellent not too rich not greasy slightly crisp topping not the overwhelming cheddar taste

This was a great spot for our group and a great light meal for preclubbing.  You can take small bites and share everything.
The lounge has great artwork that creates a sexy vibe against the red walls.

Many large groups were around us and still eating/celebrating different occassions.  I would definitely return on my next trip.  Reasonable prices, good fun and a fun place."}
{"text":"Fun and sheik!

Happy Hour was perfect for that hot day in Vegas - pitchers of sangria & mojito couldn't have hit the spot any better!  Loved the dark red ambiance and lounge furniture."}
{"text":"The place is small but really nice. I loved the food and drinks. I must return here. This place is a little hidden diamond chip. But its a nice little romantic spot to relax with your boo. You have got to eat this food! You have got to dance here. Try the blueberry mojitos!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, nicely decorated, good music but a bit loud, wish they stuck more with the Latin music, it was only about half the tracks, otherwise the songs were a bit random, nothing bad though.  For a drink I tried the cherry mule, as I suspected it was pretty sweet but good flavor, would have preferred a little more ginger beer. For food we tried the baked cod which was fsntastically amazing. Albondigas (meatballs) were also pretty tasty. Chicago beef bocadillos, something went horribly wrong with this, one slice of meat was downright terrible, tasted really old with a bad texture, not good at all. Petite filet was pretty good but I've had much better, was good flavor but not super tender. Not sure the mushrooms and cream cheese paired all that well either but it was good overall. Chicken skewers were good but underwhelming, not what I was craving.  Service was excellent, didn't feel like bringing up the bad price of meat but I'm sure if I did they would've handled it."}
{"text":"very nice place. it has small little portions of different kinds of food with decent prices. so order at least 2 portion per person. the drinks are good too. they are not cheap and they make rich drinks. only reason i am not giving it a 5 is the location and the waiters/esses are not professional and a little dump"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas and I love introducing friends to it.  The tapas style menu makes it great for small to medium sized groups.  You also get a lot of variety for a very reasonable price.  I've tried almost everything on the menu and this is my list of favorite dishes and the ones I'd pass on.

Favorites:
Artichoke toasts- My boyfriend who doesn't even like artichokes, likes this one.
Stuffed Dates- Great flavors and textures.  The sweetness from the dates and saltiness from the bacon and blue cheese are such a wonderful combination.  The red wine reduction really brings it all together and the almond adds a nice crunch.
Albondigas- Just well done meatballs in marinara.
Ham and cheese croquetas- Fried meat and cheese, it's a little hard to go wrong there.
Merguez- A flavorful lamb sausage served with red pepper and tomato confit.  The sweetness from the confit compliments the slightly spicy sausage nicely.
Firefly* fish sticks- Fried tilapia fillets with a great texture and usually perfectly cooked.  (Once when they were busy, the fish sticks came out over cooked.)
Fried calamari- Well done calamari served with a garlic aioli.  The aioli can be a bit pungent, but not enough to deter me from this dish.
Camarones a la diabla- Shrimp in a sweet and slightly spicy Asian influenced sauce.
Passion fruit mini-cheesecakes- The passion fruit flavor just explodes in your mouth; perfectly tart and sweet.

Pass on:
Tuna peppers- Tuna salad stuffed in marinated sweet peppers.  The tuna salad was nothing special, and the peppers were a tad too sweet for this application.
Stuffed peppers- Little peppers stuffed with cheese and topped off with a tomato sauce.  This dish was boring compared to the others.  It reminded me of not good Italian food.
Crispy duck rolls- Let me start off by saying duck is one of my all time favorite foods.  With that said, these were a complete disappointment.  The filling in the rolls was so overpowering you could not taste the duck.  It really tasted like a bad egg roll.  On another occasion my friend, who also loves duck, ordered these and agreed they were not very good.
Paella- This was edible, but certainly nothing to rave about.  It was missing that nice crust on the bottom of the pan, and the texture of the rice was a little too sticky for paella.

If you are near the strip and want Tapas, I would suggest Firefly* over Cafe Ba Ba Reeba.  The food and prices are better.  If you are looking for a pitcher of tasty sangria, choose Ba Ba Reeba over Firefly*.  Ba Ba Reeba adds hard liquor to their sangria for a nice kick to compliment the sweet fruity beverage."}
{"text":"My best friend took me here on my bday and I had SO MUCH FUN.  Of course we walked in with like a shit load of hot girls, dressed to impress...So wherever we go it'll be a fun time lol.  5 pitchers of mojitos later.....EVEN FUNNER TIME!  The food is so delicious and perfectly sized portions.  LOVE this place.  It's my mandatory stop every time I'm in town..."}
{"text":"Came for dinner. Interior was very nice and server was friendly however we were seated in the middle area near where the kitchen is and the servers kept on hitting the back of my chair when they walked by. It happened at least 8 times while sitting down so I moved my seat and a server noticed and asked about it. I said it was fine since I moved my chair but shouldn't the servers notice if they hit something as well? Food was good so points for that but it's really unnecessary to walk so fast when it wasn't even a full house. Anyways my favorite dishes were the Bacon Wrapped Dates and Scallop Escargot. Everything else I'll take a pass on, even the complimentary bread was not memorable, it was hard and stale."}
{"text":"A great starting point in Vegas. The Tapas are outstanding. The drinks even better. Sit at the bar while waiting on a table. Great Mojitos (Great Pours!!). The process is just order once you finish the selection you made as these are small portion dishes. Would suggest starting out with the warm spinach salad, then onto one or two of the different tapas. So stop by this place before you explore Vegas."}
{"text":"Really fun place to eat.  I love the tapas menu, the small servings allow you to sample several different items.  One of my favorite restaurants."}
{"text":"I love Firefly! Ive been to the other two locations but this one is my favorite. Its closer, less crowed, and I like the way this one is set up. Right when you walk in you see the bar and the large beautiful fireplace. They also have a really cute patio for when the weather is good. Ive never had to wait longer than 10 minutes here and the time that I did have to wait they gave me a free glass of sangria while I was waiting! 

First of all I love the drinks! Ive tried some of the mojitos but mango is my favorite, its so delicious that if I know Ill be there for a while I get a pitcher. Their red wine sangria is phenomenal. I always think of Firefly first when I want sangria. They do have a happy hour for the drinks I believe after 6PM the pitchers are half off. Make sure you at least try one of their mojitos or sangrias. 

Okay now on the the food! Every time I come I try to get something I haven't had before but its so hard because I have so many favorites! If you've never had tapas before the way it works is you order a bunch of things (they are all small plates) so you can try a variety of food. Everyone at the table shares, its family style dining :] I personally love this kind of dining because you can try some many different dishes and everyone else can try them too! My favorites items on the menu would have to be: 

Apple and Manchego salad: Apples and cheese are cut julienne style, so crisp and flavorful! They also sprinkle nuts on the top, delicious! I always get this first whenever I come to Firefly. 

Steak and Mushroom skewers: THE STEAK... mmmm so tender and juicy! I cant get enough! OH and the mushrooms so amazing and they complement the steak beautifully. I absolutely love the sauce the pour over them, ahhhh these are a must get! 

Stuffed dates: WOW small little things but packed with flavor! These cute little dates are wrapped in bacon, yes bacon and stuffed with blue cheese mmmmm. Get these, that's all I have to say. 

Shrimp Civiche: Wonderful, so fresh and with large chunks of avocado. The chips that come with it are very good too. 

Baked titilla: Not sure if I spelled that right, but this dish has manchego cheese in fondue form with chorizo and tomato. Very good if you're a fan of Manchego cheese. It also comes with crispy bread to put the cheese on. 

Tuna taretare: mmmm very tasty tuna! Comes with taro chips! 

Those are just some of my favorites, everything on the tapas menu I've gotten I've loved! Ive also tried the chicken and mushroom piallea, very good, very large! If you want to order this make sure a few other people with help you eat it. I was with 2 other people and we barely made a dent. It also takes around 30 minutes so make sure you order it right away or have time to spare. 

Oh yeah and the desserts! I think I've had almost of them, banana-nutella sand-witches: decadent and oh so yummy! The tarts are really good, and you can go wrong with bread pudding! That is if you even have room for dessert, I usually don't because I get so much food...  If you've been wanting to try tapas come to firefly!"}
{"text":"For my birthday my amazing boyfriend whisked me off from the cold of San Francisco to the desert warmth of Vegas.  After meticulous planning and calling in his connections he was recommenced to take me to Firefly for dinner (he knows my love of eating tiny bits of food with my hands).  The sangria was delicious and the service was polite and very swift (some of the best service we had in Vegas).  The tapas were all delicious however the one that outshined all  of them was the dates stuffed with almonds and wrapped in bacon (he also knows my love of bacon).  So delicious we ended up ordering a second round even though neither of us were hungry.  

Also to everyone complaining that this place isnt authentic Spanish tapas well duh....first of all its Vegas...is there anything authentic in Vegas? Second, nowhere does Firefly claim to be authentic tapas restaurant (although 2 pitchers of Sangria in, I wasnt looking for fine print on the menu).  In fact in most of the US and Europe, tapas is its own cuisine that  doesnt necessarily pertain to Spanish cooking...look it up...no seriously...go ahead I'll wait.

You back? Good,  probably about half the tapas places Ive eaten at arent anywhere near traditional Spanish food, which I am very well educated in (trust me, Im dating a mexican so yeah my word is gold...or at least gold plated). Yet, I can still enjoy tapas even when they arent made with olives from Tia's ranch.  

Bottom line, good food is good food no matter what you call it, and Firefly is good food."}
{"text":"The food was varied, lots of selection, and really a lot of unusual choices-most were quite good. We ordered approx 15 dishes and liked about 85% of them. The service was terrible. Slow and unorganized but we weren't in a hurry so we didn't make a fuss. Not the cleanest...menus were sticky."}
{"text":"We were staying at the hotel right nextdoor so it was very convenient. We had 2 pitchers - one of the white chardonnay sangria and the other was mango mojito. We also had some tapas - stuffed bacon wrapped dates, artichoke toast, tuna tartare, firefly fries and ended with the passion fruit sorbet. IT WAS ALL SO MINDBLOWINGLY AMAZING. Service was fantastic, we never had to pour our own drinks. They were very helpful and extremely friendly as well. Everything was very reasonably priced as well! It wasn't cheap cheap but it wasn't exorbitantly priced either, I would definitely return next time I'm Vegas!!"}
{"text":"I came here because I'm one food borne illness away from my goal weight!!!  Okay actually I like the food here and since it is tapas style I can put a variety of things in my mouth.  Most of the time I come in here and drink a lot so I can pretend I'm a rich old lady and the Latin staff are my hot pool boys.  That's what I love about firefly's atmosphere!"}
{"text":"We were told this place was a good spot with a lively nightlife. When we went there only people that were there were having dinner. We went to the bar and had a drink. We ordered the infused vodka with blackberry and lychee. It tasted like syrup. We struggled to finish our drink. We didn't have any of the food. I am just rating the bar."}
{"text":"Delicious food + excellent service = great experience

Very big selection of various tapas - hot, cold, seafood - lots to chose from. Bacon-wrapped figs, shrimp in spicy sauce, chorizo-chicken stuffed mushrooms, thai-style ginger salad, baby beets salad, stuffed peppers, tetilla cheese fondue - everything was outright delicious. Also don't miss on Sangria - made at a restaurant with red, white and sparkling wines - not too sweet and just with the right balance of fruit and sugar - very tasty. Great prices.

Also have to commend the service - our waitress Sandy was very friendly and helpful, all the food came out promptly and at a write temperature. Will definitely come back next time I'm in Vegas.

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Loud and very busy - however, if you want to escape casino crowd, this restaurant is conveniently located on Paradise road, within walking or short taxi ride distance from many hotels on the strip.
Very good selection of drinks, from sangria to signature cocktails.
Food is served tapas style with lots of tasty options. Bacon wrapped dates, baked tetilla cheese, empanada - everything was very tasty.
Service was friendly and prompt.
Recommended."}
{"text":"Great view over freemont street. Lamb skewers excellent. Mussels were average but but good spice.  
The sausage and chorizo stuffed mushroom are a must 
The salads are huge so share one."}
{"text":"This is a great spot for locals to bring visitors. It's nice for Vegas to have a non-chain/non-gaming/non-smoking restaurant that has good food and good drinks. They have a great happy hour with $14 pitchers of sangria! Their chicken salad tapas is to die for. The only reason I'm not giving this little gem 5 stars is because their service is hit or miss. I feel it often takes longer than it should to be greeted by our server and receive our drinks. However, that's easy to overlook when you're getting such great food, drinks and ambiance!"}
{"text":"I love the fact that you just order different appetizer sized plates and share it with whomever is with you.

Let's see... so I tried: 

Ceviche of shrimp: pretty good... standard ceviche. Nice and tart.

Terra y Mare skewers: these were pretty awesome.  Cooked nicely and in a great seasoning.

Steamed Mussels: LOVE these. You make yourself a total mess, but it's totally worth it.

Pulpo Asado: the octopus was cooked VERY nicely.  Not rubbery at all and the seasoning on the dish was beautiful.

Ahi Tuna Skewer: just as great as the rest of them.  Tuna was cooked well done, and the mango next to them definitely added a tart.

Tips:

It is super duper busy... even on a Sunday night at 10pm.  Call me small town, but holy smokes.

It's pretty cramped inside, but the decor is really cool with deep colored lighting."}
{"text":"The food and drinks were great and we are trying to have a great birthday  party. When we were done dancing we sat down and a couple came to us and  told us we needed to move that the chairs belong to them. The tone he used was rude and he was talking down and yelling us to move and get our of the chair. So we got up to avoid more conflict but he was still talking to us in a rude tone. Then his friend eas talking more trash and loud enough fIe me tp hear thsy she wanted me to say something again so she could hit me. One of ours friends  came to tell him not to talk to us that way he wanted to fight him and then his friend had more words and threatened us and continued wanting to fight. I went and got management and told him what happen. 
Management  had  three people leave and the host for salsa dancing went and brought them back in after the fact. The host then goes up to us and told us to stay on one side of the floor or she was going to call the police. We went and got management to come to tge bar and they appeared to be in shock. I ask them to explain to me why host was allowed to do that and they were unable to explain why.  We spent over 1500.00 tonight and was treated  very poorly. The host who is not an employee of fly flies  choose to keep non paying customers over paying. The fact we were planning on spending more money before the drama over 2 chairs. We won't be coming there for another event we will spend our money at another location."}
{"text":"Yup... it's that's good.
Steak and Mushroom skewers in a red wine reduction sauce
Camarones Diabla
Bacon Wrapped Dates
Apple Salad
Empanadas
Sangria

But the biggest plus... for anyone staying on the strip and eating in those expensive hotels is the price. Extremely reasonable for the quality of food. Best deals can be found by getting into Uber and getting off the strip."}
{"text":"We were 50/50 with drinks and food. Some of them were done so poorly they went right back to the kitchen. Others were outstanding.

A little quality control is in order here. Get to work Dave!

PS Not at ALL the same vibe as on the strip. This was Chevy's Fresh Mex-ish and suitable for Hank to sit on the table."}
{"text":"So, after eating at countless restaurants on the strip we wanted to try something new. I give this place four stars instead of five because 1) the service is somewhat lacking and slow and 2) the parking issue but other than that, the food is delicious. We had a pitcher of their famous red sangria which is a definite must - sweet and perfect. We had about 8 different plates that we ordered and the portions are small so this was adequate for two people. Out of all the plates the one's that I recommend and would order again are:
*mac & cheese - really very delicious
*shrimp in lemon-garlic butter dish
* shrimp, chorizo sausage, and filet mignon skewers
*bacon wrapped dates
*ham and cheese
*firefly fries


For dessert we had the dessert sampler and the bread pudding. The dessert sampler is not too great and I wouldn't recommend it, but the bread pudding was actually pretty nice. 

This place is JAM PACKED and parking can be hard to find (we lucked out). Highly recommend this place though"}
{"text":"Dined here on a Sunday afternoon on 11/27/11 for my husband's birthday lunch.  He originally was in the mood for burgers and fries and as we were driving down the road I spotted this place and remembered it was the many restaurants I bookmarked on YELP.  :)  Service was pretty fast, and friendly.  They were not busy at all, so it may be best to come here on Sunday afternoons if you want to avoid the crowds.  

We ordered the following items:  Firefly fries (my hubby was craving fries), Firefly fish sticks, Filet Mignon sliders and ceviche.  Yes, I know these are weird items to order at a tapas place, but let me tell you everything was really delicious!!!  We really enjoyed the fries and fish sticks and the dipping sauces that came with them.  For dessert we had the passion fruit cheesecake and tres leches chocolate cake.  The passion fruit cheesecake was too tart for my liking, but the tres leches cake was very good.  

We will definitely be coming back here again, and trying something new.  :)"}
{"text":"The place was packed.  I don't remember all the tapas we ordered but there wasn't a bad one.   The sangria was excellent.  Good food and drinks.

On the service side it lacked.  Our busser took better care of us than our waiter.  I watched our busser in action and he was keeping the place going.  He was busting his ass.

Three stars"}
{"text":"A ton more low key then the firefly on paradise, but the food is just as good, the drinks are just as good, and the prices as always are the best, its just a much more toned down crowed, so If you want the up beat aura then hit up paradise, but if you want to sit back, have some good food, and make fun of your friend for totally striking out with the hot hostess, then try this firefly"}
{"text":"Inventive tapas, great drinks, solid service, and a swanky ambiance, make this a must every time I am in vegas.  Bacon wrapped dates that make my nipples hard, crispy duck rolls so good I peed a little bit.  Make reservations, or be ready to wait most nights, but well worth it.  Its one of those places you just cant go wrong with ordering ANYTHING...just try it"}
{"text":"I really don't know why this place has such a high rating. The food wasn't good, everything is like homemade with a lot of oil or butter, don't go here to attempt to eat healthy. Quality of food was prob the worst I ever had. 

I'm not trying to be mean, everyone was really nice but I just don't understand the food ....  

It's not even bar food... very confused but I guess a lot of people like it"}
{"text":"I trekked out here after reading the great reviews and was pretty disappointed. This is a mediocre tapas spot.  There is nothing \"amazing\" or \"fantastic\" about it.  

*Mushroom Tart with Boursin Cheese- I love mushrooms and Boursin but thepuff pastry was dry and tough- not soft like a croissant- just a hard piece of pastry dough. 
*Steak & Mushroom Skewers- Boring, steak isn't very good and the sauces are mediocre.  Tastes like diner food.
*Baked Brie- this was one of the best dishes- the fondue and tomatoes make a nice combo
*Kobe Sliders- these are good although I hated the green chili that was hidden inside the beef- no mention of that on the menu
*Fries- these are pretty decent and the accompanying aioli is good
*Tomato soup- good but not much different from Campbell's

If I found myself in the adjoining mall (highly unlikely) and wanted a quick bite- sure I would stop here- but it's not worth seeking out..."}
{"text":"I love this place. Super yummy and affordable, with a great vibe. The Paradise location is the best. My fav tapas are the bacon wrapped dates, stuffed peppers, ham and cheese croquetas, and the salads. Worth it to wait to sit in the main restaurant rather than the \"annex\" thing they've got going on."}
{"text":"Totally delicious! Great date night spot or for a treat with friends. The food is really fresh, crisp and delicious, the ambiance id describe as sexy and modern and our waitress was lovely. We ordered the shrimp ceviche, which turned out to be my favorite, the Thai beef salad, the tuna tartar, and a couple other dishes. My glass of wine went perfectly, all in all a great experience. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Fantastic food & service! We were in Vegas for my birthday and a co-worker recommended this place. Tapas and sangria were delish! Restaurant was busy when we arrived and our party of four was seated right away. Our sever Jesus greeted us right away and made some fantastic recommendations. We loved the mango barbecue ribs, crispy duck rolls, almond-bleu cheese stuffed dates wrapped in bacon (MUST TRY), tuna tartar, and some other really wonderful dishes. Prices were very reasonable, the food came out very quickly and our water glasses were never empty! Definitely will be back next time we are in town!"}
{"text":"My favorite place in Vegas!! So good.. I love tapas.. so delish.. I love being able to try different things and I haven't had one bad thing from here.

I try to go for happy hour and sit at the bar. The bartenders are really nice and quick. Happy hour drinks are half off and you get a free plate of appetizers. It's a small portion of 3-4 items but free! The drinks are so good.. mojitos and sparkling sangria.. must try!

Food is amazing.. if you don't like it then you are seriously insane!"}
{"text":"Love their tapas! A huge selection to choose from, if you go early there is no wait, I was there at 530ish and went straight to a table. Service is always quick and food is good!"}
{"text":"The wait is long here during the night, but well worth it!

You must order the bacon wrapped dates - to die for!

The atmosphere is fun with a splash of comfort.  My date and I sat in comfy sofas with candles set on the table, surrounded by a boisterous crowd.  The tapas we ordered just kept coming and every single dish was tasty.  They also make a bomb mojito.  Other dishes to try: tierra y mar skewers, and ceviche of shrimp"}
{"text":"Literally every dish here is fantastic.  Service is fast and attentive.  Sangria is a must.  Can't go wrong with the empenadas, Serrano sliders, bacon wrapped dates and much more.  Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Dreadful. Tapas are not meant to be mass produced. Dates, chicken tinga empanadas and baked goat cheese were good. The rest were truly mediocre ... pulpo, papas bravas, garlic shrimp, pork empanadas, etc. skip this one !"}
{"text":"This place was awesome!  We went here on our first day in Vegas, and it did not disapoint.  We had four people, so we were able to get a ton of different dishes, and none of them were bad, though some were just ok.  Most, however, are great.  Make sure you ask your waiter what is good...ours did not lead us wrong.  Best dishes were the filet mignon sliders, merguez, and the stuffed dates."}
{"text":"Tasty Ceviche and yummy sliders."}
{"text":"Very nice tapas restaurant.. food is innovative and tasty, great cavas... I only took one star out because of the noisy environment inside."}
{"text":"Keep in mind that tapas are small dishes. 

But oh boy, waited too long to write this review (again). We have friends in Vegas this weekend (hot!) and I just reminded them to check out the Firefly on Paradise - can't vouch for any others!

We had a group of 8 and ordered a different plate for each of us and ate them family style. Then we ordered more, ended up ordering 16 plates, which was too much food. 

All of them were OK, but a few were simply outstanding. I reluctantly tried a stuffed date - I usually don't like bacon on sweets - but that was one we ordered 2x! Also a shrimp dish. 

The mac and cheese and sausage plates were OK, but only ordered once. I'm getting old and waited too long to remember the rest. But just order a few and see what you like before ordering the additional plates."}
{"text":"We came here to celebrate my sisters 30TH birthday! they were super great with us bringing a cake for her. They cut and served it for us. The food here is pretty good! i just wish they brought out our dishes in pairs or all together, since we were a party of 6 we ordered multiple dishes but we all didn't get to try the food at the same time. not a big deal though.
We sat out on their patio which is great! covered and with fans and cute patio string lights (my fav)
I would definitely recommend this place! check it out if you're ever in Vegas!"}
{"text":"The tapas in LA area are much more flavorful. Why is this one 4 times the price? Oh wait never mind...

They tried to make a pimento kind of butter with their bread but it was more than a little sour. I don't know how. We ordered our food and my  ceviche tasted like old fish and was also pretty sour. My veggie empanada was a really weird combination of things thrown together that tasted old. And the paella, although cooked fresh, was not very flavorful. 

The servers kept ignoring us, although I wouldn't think a table of 9 is easy to miss. When they took the orders, we did ask ahead of time to split it 3-way for it to be easier. When I told her my order, I said the ceviche and veggie empanada... When the food came out, they gave us an extra plate of tartare and said I ordered it. When I said no and repeated my order, she insisted I said so, even though my eating buddies said no as well. Even more so she avoided our table, and then the new waitress came over 3 times to fill 10 ml of water (it was about an inch tall in the glass). But even then, when we told her our needs, service came really slowly (I believe water girl isn't supposed to do more than fill water and run small errands)... Probably because the other one didn't want to help us out. 

I wouldn't come back here again. I can't stand mediocre, overpriced food. We each ended up paying more than a buffet per person (except for the two girls who didn't order)."}
{"text":"Firefly has been on my list for a while now, but the Eastside location was closed (boo). On Sunday night I ventured to the Westside location instead. Here's the breakdown,

Parking:  Easy there is a lot right next to the restaurant so no drama there.

Ambience: Has a dark and sexy vibe to it, the tables in the dining area are a bit too close together for my taste. If you want to avoid that just sit in the bar section there's a bit more room there.

Service: Was good overall my waitress was friendly, the dinnerware was cleared in a timely fashion with each set of tapas that came out, and they kept my water glass filled. 

Food:  The prices are very affordable tapas range $4 - $12 per item while the big entrees range from $12 - $24, now they cook everything to order here so if you're in a big rush to eat you might want to save this place, for when you have more time. 
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here's what I tried:

Warm spinach salad- This salad was great it was fresh, light and the vinaigrette had a nice balance and wasn't too overpowering.

Empanadas- Was good the pork was season well, the was pasty light, wish I could have tasted more of the red pepper but it was a solid choice.

Ham and cheese croquetas- My favorite so far, between the smoky ham, the warm  
creamy, cheese and the crispy fried exterior I was in heaven. I                           
could have easily ate my weight in these they're just that good. 

Lamb skewer- Delicious, tender, and well -flavored.

Paella- Now it takes a while for the chef to prepare this dish so make sure it is ordered  at the very beginning.  I liked it thought the rice and the meats were cooked well, It was flavored well; however the dish was a bit salty which might have been due to the chorizo, I would order it again and just ask them to ease up on the chorizo next time.

White Sangria- light, sweet and refreshing.

Overall I had a great experience here and will add it to my list of Vegas go to's."}

{"text":"I bring my out of towners here.  I'm actually going here tonight, my mom is in town, it's a perfect place close to the hotels.  It's off the strip but it's still fun.  Always crowded, great music, great food, affordable, what else do you want??

Not to sound like a groupie, but the items recommended on yelp are seriously fantastic.  Terra y mare skewers, filet mignon sliders, stuffed dates.  Go with the big guns, fantastic.  I have yet to have a drink here

My personal favorite is mac n cheese.  But how can that go wrong?  Even the Kraft microwavable boxes I find delicious.

Cute date spot, great for a group of friends, love this spot."}
{"text":"Great food, nice atmosphere! Very personal staff along with good customer service. BEST sangria in town!  A nice place to share good company and good quality food from all around the world. Definitely give this place a go if you haven't already you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Food wasn't the best. Decent but not spectacular. Fun lunch with small portions to share. Chicken skewers were flavorless and steak was very rich. Restaurant was real dark, service was slow, but price wasn't too bad."}
{"text":"Firefly is excellent!  What a fun place that doesn't feel chain-restauranty like many other places I have been in Las Vegas.  Beautiful patio, reasonable prices and excellent food.  I went with a friend and we shared three tapas and each had a couple of beverages and the prices were reasonable.  I lived in Spain and this brought back memories... I will definitely return and recommend this as a place visitors to Las Vegas go with me when they come to town."}
{"text":"Well rounded menu, with many different options. I ventured in for lunch, based on their Yelp reviews and I wasn't disappointed. The portion size was nice, as one dish was plenty for lunch. I ordered the steak and mushroom kabobs...delicious!  This would've a great place to go with a big group. I can only rate the one dish I enjoyed, but I can't wait to try more."}
{"text":"Firefly serves excellent tapas. The staff is friendly and the service is great.  We walked there (about 25 minute walk from center of strip) and returned by taxi.  We will definitely return next time we're in Vegas."}
{"text":"We opted to get off the strip for our reception on Saturday.  My best friend, who just moved to North Las Vegas, suggested this place and I'm so glad she did.  We booked a private room and had the two hour open bar.  Everything was just amazing.  They brought out the white and red sangria (sadly I didn't get to try the white) as well as a couple of different mojitos.  The blood orange mojito was amazing.  And at the risk of sounding like a broken record, everything was amazing.  We opted for the bacon wrapped dates (of course), chicken and beef skewers (the beef were the better of the two...super tender), spicy potatoes (good but there was almost too many of them), the albondigas.  The chocolate tres leches cake at the end was the perfect cap.  They also brought the entire party of 16 shots of their infused vodka.  And the service all around was just amazing.  They kept asking us if there was anything we needed and they were not stingy with the drinks in the least, even bringing out extra glasses so people could start double fisting!  :)
I wish they would open up a spot in Denver or Colorado Springs...this place is amazing!"}
{"text":"We showed up at 9:30 pm on a Tuesday, and were very surprised to learn that they close at 10 pm. Really? Isn't this Vegas? I mean, I know it's downtown, but still.

We were seated after being warned that they were closing in half an hour, and I noticed that the place was fairly empty. Hmm, strange. I guess not many people come here when it's not happy hour.

I ordered the stuffed dates and a tomato soup. I liked both, but neither one blew me away. I had a sip of sangria, which was pretty yummy, but I didn't order a drink.

The view of Fremont Street was nice, even if the actual Fremont Street Experience was disappointing. And the Plaza (which Firefly is located in) is kind of.. dumpy. But that goes for almost all of downtown Vegas.

Overall, I had a nice experience here, but it wasn't really worth the $20 cab ride from the Strip. If you're not staying downtown, skip Fremont Street and stick to the Strip."}
{"text":"This place is mostly for locals only and it's off the strip. But any can will take you right away. The quality & taste of food as well as service is excellent and the price it's super cheap. It's Spanish cuisine and mostly tapas so there's plenty to order and taste. Portions are reasonable to sample and share. Try the chorizos, tortilla española, figs w bacon. There's plenty cold and hot tapas to choose from. Also try the sangria. At the end of the men you will leave full, happy and without breaking the bank."}
{"text":"Shrimp Ceviche - delicious. 
Fried Calamari - lightly fried and the spicy tartar sauce was yummy.
Firefly Fries - came with parmesan cheese on them and an aioli sauce on the side, heaven.
Garlic Bread w/ sweet creamed butter - bread was soft and the butter was mixed with some sort of spices... sad when we finished the plate.
White Sangria - sweet and tart, not disappointed.

FINALLY
Dessert Platter!

Caramel Flan - I HATE flan, this one changed my mind. Did not have a rubbery consistency which is what usually turns me off.
Lemon Berry Tarts - sweet and tart, perfect. Lemon Berry glaze on the tart was delicious.
Mini Cheesecakes - creamy and came topped with a strawberry. Yum.
Chocolate Tres Leches Cake - amazing.

Food was so delicious and the service was fast. Irina was our waitress tonite and her busboy was ON HIS GAME. our glasses for water were rarely empty more than 2 minutes.

I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS. Another bonus perk is that it's a quick walk from the Fairfield Marriott"}
{"text":"Ate there last night with couple of friends. Food was excellent. The service is excellent. It's a tapas house so everything is a small plates serving. But the serving sizes are just right share with three other people at the table. We got six different entrées they were all good I could particularly liked the shrimp tempura but all entrees were good"}
{"text":"I am so confused by these raving reviews. This place is pretty but the food was terrible.  Prices are now twice of what the pictures of the menus on yelp show.  The now 33 dollar pitcher of sangria tasted like rotten fruit, boxed wine, and the cheapest brandy."}
{"text":"This place is great!  The decor is very cozy and inviting and the food is delicious.  My boyfriend and I prefer to sit at the bar and the service is always good.  Besides the food being good and that they are open till 2am our favorite thing is the Sangria, its AMAZING!  

This place is usually packed so I suggest a reservation or there may be a wait.  Either way, I would say its worth it :)"}
{"text":"OMG. I'm going to talk about food. I just had the BEST Pulpo Asado. Without a doubt the BEST Pulpo/Tako dish I have ever had. I am a foodie and I have opposable thumbs therefore I am making this food texture comparison the Pulpo was like veal. 'Like buttah'!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Went there again, this time with my wife, and confirmed that yes, this is a great place for a date.  My wife is both gluten and dairy free, and was able to find plenty of things she could eat (tip: they will leave out the blue cheese on the stuffed dates).
Refreshingly un-Vegas and mostly locals."}
{"text":"So I have to update my review because I'm blown away. Aldo was the busser and he took care of us so well. He was completely on top of our refills and clearing our table and he took our order a few times. Thank you so much Aldo for redeeming firefly for me. The food was also fantastic as always but really tonight was all about how fantastic Aldo was."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The food, the ambiance, everything. I would definitely recommend the Chorizo and Clams - so much flavor! My boyfriend and I had fun picking different dishes. They have a very large menu but everything we ordered was cooked perfectly and tasted great. Firefly is my new favorite restaurant!"}
{"text":"This is still one of the best places to eat in Vegas. Had like 10 appetizers. Too many to describe individually, but all I can say is that it was all amazing. From the sangria to the food to the dessert. One thing make sure to make a reservation."}
{"text":"This little hidden gem is found right outside the strip.  The service was amazing, the food was AMAZING!! We will definitely dine here again when we come back for another Vegas trip! Everything was so fresh!  Pictures are posted for some of the amazing dishes we enjoyed that afternoon!"}
{"text":"My partner is suffering from food poisoning right now as I write this review - thanks alot firefly.  We assume it's from the chicken skewers or an apple salad - these are the only things I didn't try of his, Thank God.  We ate around 8pm on 4/25/11, he was throwing up by 11:30pm.  It's 2:21am now and he's still praying to the porcelain god.  This is horrible and obviously we will never come back - I feel disgusted and almost want to ask you for a fucking refund.  We weren't expecting a side of salmonella or e Coli with dinner tonight.  Also, thanks for ruining what was a great vacation thus far."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch since all the rave reviews had made me very curious as to how good the tapas were.Armed with high expectation and an empty stomach, we were sat down right away since the place was nearly empty.
Given the menu and a basket of bread to start with, the waiter showed up after 10mins to take our orders. We had pulpo, patatas bravas, steamed mussels,steak in skewers,stuffed mushrooms,somethng egg layered with potatoes.
The taste was disppointing, Pulpo was too soft to the bite, it was tasteless. the bravas were burnt, mussels were served in coconut milk that is canned!!! UGH!!!
Service was so so. Not attentive.Had to ask for refill 2x.
I have truly experienced better.I also  noticed that all the tapas were topped with chopped scallions, onions,tomatoes."}
{"text":"The locals and tourists love this place.You can be sure it will be jumpin on Friday/Saturday evenings, The House drink is Sangria, red or white marinated and thirst quenching, then they have more tapas than you can count, but the fave for me was the dates filled with Blue cheese and a smoked almond wrapped in bacon. There are warm and cold dishes, I would avoid the more expensive $ 10 meat and seafood dishes, they mostly did not live up to expectations. The simple dishes worked best for us. Service is average friendly but frenzied, drinks are made well if a bit small. This is a great place for groups or couples , not so much for singles though.There is an outdoor patio too. We saw at least 3 groups of 8 or more. You will have a authentic local experience here. It's a great place to start or end your evening. When you are done, in the same little mall is the Havana Cigar bar, you can stroll in for a nightcap and some live local entertainment."}
{"text":"Even if you you didn't score 2100 on your  SATs , there is always hope that you can get a good paying job as a valet at even a mediocre place like this and maybe  earn  
$ 60 K.a year.Ya'know this aint the Wynn or Caesars but of course they have a valet too even for this small lot. Just  sayin'.
As far as the place, this is the new location much improved ambiance, further back from the street, bigger, nicer, cleaner than before. Same menu and maybe a little too friendly waiters. This is primarily a local joint , but visitors have caught on too.
It's a tapas bar with some good selections;
The standouts;
Suffed dates: smoked almonds, blue cheese, dates and awesome sauce.
Stuffed peppers: w/ cheese herbs
Baby back ribs: fall off the bone tender
Tierra Mar skewers ; Surf 'n Turf for us fogies- were recommended but  a bit too many things goin' on for my taste.
Summer Salad with heirloom tomatoes- for Vegas OK - but not primo  by west coast standards.Greenhouse stuff , not the aroma you expect.
The interior is full of options, inside, outside, bar, tables what ever you like. The best thing is that with a group of people everyone will find something they can own and get behind.
Beers , or a pitcher of  white or red sangrias ,you can't beat that for  $ 28-
The place beats the pants off the typical Strip crowd, it's easy, and can be quick or slow as you like. Great early or late- you could do a lot worse.  It's more about the company you 're  with than the restaurant IMO- this place will support whatever is you are trying to make of the evening.Salut."}
{"text":"Basically all I can say, because I'm apparently the last person on earth to go here, is:

Hey everyone!  I agree!

Holy poop is this stuff excellent!

I suggested this last night on a whim.  I've been before, but always with people who didn't want to wait.  We did have to wait about 25 - 30 minutes, but my dining partner assured me it was worth it.  We were able to get a seat at the bar and ordered a pitcher of sangria to share.    They have two sangria varieties - red wine and white wine.  We had the white wine and it was delicious - light and refreshing.

After we were seated we were seen promptly by our waiter and it didn't take long for us to choose our selections, all of which were marvelous.  We had the filet mignon sliders, baked brie, camarones a la diabla, and chicken and chorizo stuffed mushrooms.  Everything was prepared perfectly and was absolutely delicious.  The sauce on the shrimp was divine, and the brie was paired with some deliciously roasted tomatoes.

The only downside was that our waiter seemed to forget about us after our food had arrived and we sat without the bill for a while.  But, while we sat we talked about how good the food was.

Recommended for any occasion.  So flippin' good."}
{"text":"Ive only been to 4 tapas places in my entire lifetime, this one was memorable! We celebrated a bachelorette lunch here and the girls liked sharing the different plates we got. For me, The highlight picks were the paella, mac and cheese and egg and potato (i forgot the name!) The environment is nicely deco'd and theres a lot of seating. Customer service also good! Great tapas place to try in the area. I take one star off because they didnt have reservation slots through open table at the time i needed."}
{"text":"The dates are amazing. Sweet baby Jesus the pork empanadas were one of the best things I have ever eaten. The service was excellent. Also they serve PITCHERS of mojitos. Any flavor you like. Local friend recommended and it was phenomenal. Affordable and less than a $10 cab ride from Bally's."}
{"text":"Excellent service and delicious food! 

We avoided going to the Vegas buffets and decided to eat here instead. 

I don't think you could go wrong with any of the dishes! It's that good!

Just to give you an idea, I came with two friends and we ordered 8 small plates. We were full!

I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"The bacon wrapped dates were to die for. Those are worth making a trip to vegas for. Overall a very good alternative to getting food at the strip. You can have a really nice meal and not feel like you're spending an arm and a leg."}
{"text":"Everything I try here is delicious!  Come early and it much quieter!! You have to try the dates, mac n cheese, peppers, tuna tartare is my favorite. 
Love the tre Che for dessert.  It a great first date or anniversary experience!!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here for brunch. I've done dinner here half a dozen times, but had never come for anything else. I've never had a bad dinner here and now I've never had a bad brunch as well. The service is just as fast and friendly as ever and the food is the same great quality. The brunch drink menu isn't too long, but everything on it is very good (blackberry gin and tonic!). And you can't go wrong with pumpkin beignets."}
{"text":"Get off the Strip and go somewhere that is un-pretencious, affordable and fun.  That would be Firefly.  I have been coming here for years and am a little sad to say that too many of my industry associates have discovered this hidden gem.  

I come to Vegas several times a year on business and this is my go-to place to get out, relax and NOT see anyone I know or work with in my industry.  I guess that you can't keep a secret for too long, as I always see people I know here now.  Even so, I won't stop coming because of it, although I may go to one of their other locations further outside of Vegas?

I cannot pinpoint any one item on the menu that I love more than the others (except for the Stuffed Dates, which simply ROCK), but just take some friends, order 6-10 tapas plates, get a few pitchers of Sangria and try not to look surprised when the check comes.  Its half the cost of anything comparable on the Strip.

A real treat for a small-business owner or someone on a tight expense-account.  Go check it out!"}
{"text":"Rick Harrison of Pawn Stars fame recommended this place, and he was right! Everything here was amazing, and we loved the tapas approach. My wife enjoyed her favorite-ever steak, the petite filet mignon, and I enjoyed a wonderful Firefly burger. Everything was full of flavor, from the diablo ketchup all the way to the bread pudding for dessert. This is a very upscale-feeling place where you can be comfortable dressing casual, too. Magnifique!"}
{"text":"This place is crowded not just on a Friday night as other reviewers have stated, but also on a Sunday afternoon!  Some local friends wanted to take us off-strip, and I'm glad they picked Firefly.  The food was good (loved the tuna ceviche) and so was the sangria.  While we were there, a small R&B band started playing, and it wasn't long before people got up to dance.  Very diverse crowd, everyone having fun and enjoying the food and music."}
{"text":"I love Firefly! I've been here a few times and I always make sure to eat here anytime I visit Vegas! This place never disappoints! The food is always on point and the atmosphere is phenomenal! Tapas are one of my favorites and they are very well done here. Lots of different options to chose from ranging from veggies to chicken or steak to seafood and just about everything in between! The red sangria is DELICIOUS AND REFRESHING! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"My wife and had dinner rather late around 10pm and it was maybe 50 % occupied. We ordered the combo paella first because it takes about 40 to 50 minutes. We had the patatas brava and wasn't to impressed by it the potatoes were not crispy my daughter had this in Barcelona and it was not up to par and we also had the huevos estrellados which is similar to the braves but with a fried egg and chorizo.  I was waiting for the server to mention that I had  2 potato dishes but he said nothing and it was a little better but I have to say that both potato dishes seemed like they sat around for awhile. Someplace place use the 2 fry method to crisp them up but it seems like over fried once trying crisp them but it was not.

Then we had octopus(pulpo Saadi)was really good and tender.  Next came the warm Spinach salad and it's just okay.    The ipaella finally showed up and it was okay but not prepared properly it had no socarrat at the bottom of the pan which I was looking for; the flavor was rather muted.

We had dessert the cherry bread pudding and flan.   The bread could have more edge it lacked any cherry flavor but the flan was one the best I had in flavor and texture not heavy or aerated it was perfect."}
{"text":"We picked Firefly for our 11/12 wedding reception, as this was frequently one of our favorite places in Vegas for dinner, and they had a nice banquet room, big enough for our party (45 people). I communicated primarily with Regina to set everything up. I'm a project manager, so I tend to over communicate, and communicate frequently, and expect the same in return. Sometimes I would have to follow-up for a response, which made me hesitant at times, but on the day of the event, it was clear that everyone (including all of the vendors) had communicated just fine, and Regina had everything set up perfectly. Our other vendors included a DJ, Elvis w/ Showgirls, & a Desert Bar. We had a bar set up in the back for our guests, and we thought they did a great job separating the rooms for cocktail hour, dinner, and dancing. The best part, Firefly's food! It did not fail. I was nervous that if we had a lot of food, it would come out cold, and slow. I was wrong. It came out hot, and quick. The only complaint from my guests were that they wish they knew what was coming out- as they ate a lot in the beginning, but didn't realize how many courses there were. My Grandmother wasn't a fan of the food (very different for her!), but they were so nice to make her some ribs with no sauce, and she was happy. All in all, we were very happy with our event at Firefly, and I was glad I didn't need to worry about a thing! Thank you!!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best (somewhat) hidden gems in Las Vegas.  Word seems to be getting out about this place as they have recently expanded.  You will still find mostly locals in this off-strip establishment.  They have excellent red and white sangria and tapas.  But the best part about this place is the atmosphere.  It does not feel like Vegas.  This restaurant could easily be in an urban setting such as SF or NYC, or even beach side in Southern California.  It definitely has that appeal.  I would highly suggest this place for just a relaxing place to hang out, grab a drink, and some tapas.  Reservations are highly suggested."}
{"text":"Budget conscious tapas 
As per Many other peoples' suggestion 

My brother and his friends wanted something lite, tasty, and relatively inexpensive; Firefly fit the bill.  Though we intended on going to the smaller late night location, somehow the wrong Yelp click, give me directions led us here.  

I have to say I was thrilled with my misclick; the view was spectacular. I haven't had the opportunity to see Downtown with the covered lights and people bustling about; this was definitely the way to do it.

Great french fries, my salad was okay, beers were inexpensive, the meatballs looked good, nice empanadas, and a happy full set of tummies for all.

Friendly staff, beautiful lofted glass ceiling, separate dimly lit bar, full drink menu, plenty of cozy booths with views, what more could a girl ask for?

Date Rating: 4
Pick up Scale: N/A (almost empty when we came, it was closing time, great space though has potential).

Strong Suggestion: Don't confuse this location with the nearby smaller cozy one; but if it's early and you don't want to wait it's pretty much the same menu."}
{"text":"Great Spanish tapas for a birthday family lunch. All ages OK in the restaurant. We had a party of 7 and were quickly seated about 1PM. Jesus was our server and was very attentive throughout the meal. The warm bread served with the honey butter is always a nice way to start the meal, of course we had another hot batch mid way ;-)

We started out with waters and a pitcher of sparkling sangria. Very good and dangerous as you can barely taste any alcohol 5/5. We began with some stuffed dates which are... amaze balls 5/5! We also had a couple orders of the Firefly fries 3/5 and a tomato basil soup 2/5. 

Since we arrived early in the day they had breakfast tapas available so we tried the Huevos Rancheros 4/5 and the brunch potato bravas 4/5. Camarones Al Ajillo were very good 5/5. We also ordered some of my favorites: Scallop Escargots 4/5, Tierra Mar Skewers 4/5, Albondigas 5/5 and another 2 orders of stuffed dates. To try something new we ordered the Petite Filet 4/5, Pulpo Asado 4/5 and fried calamari 4/5.

Overall a good lunch and everyone enjoyed the variety. For dessert they brought out a flan and sang Happy Birthday. The rest of us tried the Banana Beignet 4/5 and the trio of Gelato 4/5.

Thank you Firefly for making this a memorable birthday lunch! Will be back for Happy Hour as this is one of our faves!"}
{"text":"Firefly is a great tapas restaurant off the strip and away from all the hustle and bustle. Don't let that fool you, its good food and drinks still attract a ton of people, so don't be surprised if there is a wait. The food was all very good and comes out quickly. A mix between coffee table type settings, regular dining table, and bar settings make this good for groups of different size and different levels of intimacy.

mini filet sliders 7.5
empanadas pork 4.5
beet salad 5.5
seafood paella 15
sangria 6/cup"}
{"text":"We were a party of six and we sat in a booth in the back which was perfect so we could talk.All of our dishes we delicious.My favorite was the tuna stuffed pepper and the shrimp tempura. I WANTED TO go back for Sunday brunch! It's a bit loud for a large party, but,I will definitely make it a go to place on future visits."}
{"text":"Another good meal but we were lucky enough to eat there at Happy Hour. Eight tapas and two drinks for $44 was a bargain. And we enjoyed most of our eight dishes.  Favorite is the bacon covered date with some sauce and cheese.  Service was excellent, everyone was nice and the place is classier than most."}
{"text":"Good stuff! Delicious tapas at this place, with great atmosphere, convenient off-the-strip location, etc. This place should definitely be on your list if you're heading to Vegas. The short ribs, Mac and cheese, and empanadas were all great."}
{"text":"I LOVE FIREFLY! It's a nice and relaxing place to munch with friends or go on a romantic date. 

I love the ahi plate and of course the sangrias!! I will definitely be returning... Bringing all my friends"}
{"text":"Amazing!  Came here 3 years ago.  New look.  New vibe.  Food was exceptional!  Price was spot on.  Are new favorite tapas spot."}
{"text":"Fire fly was on FIRE tonight! I always love the atmosphere especially on the weekdays around dinner time it's not as busy and you can request a booth for just two! The sangrias are amazing and the red one is my favorite. The ceviche tastes so authentic to me it's so limey and good! I also got the lentils with veggies which are delicious as well and the tomato basil soup is great so is the baked cod but they put too much fried onion on top next time I'll say light on it or non at all. The customer service is great he kept making sure we are good!! I highly recommend this place! I heard they have great brunch I need to try it sometime!"}
{"text":"Visited this place without a reservation, upon arrival the wait was estimated 1 hour for table for two. It was a Saturday and prime time for dinner. We got lucky and found a spot at the bar. Our server was super cute, and sweet. The pitcher of sangria is huge, wasn't able to finish it, which is not a complaint by any means lol. Tuna tartar is fucking amazing, great quality. Ham & Cheese Croquetas were crispy on outside and super cheesy and delicious. Calamari was cooked to perfection. The Tierra y Mar skewers:shrimp, steak, sausage was filing and great flavor. Apple and manchego salad was refreshing, but not my favorite. We ordered the stuffed dates to finish, so damn rich in flavor and delicious. Service was quick sitting at the bar. My only complaint is their restroom situation, it's located through the kitchen and it was super confusing I just decided to hold it. Would dine here again, so much more to sample."}
{"text":"Amazing describes my dinner with my husband. We pretty much had little to no wait time and are at the bar. The bartender was super nice. Good was affordable, fast, and filling. The octopus was to die for and the passion fruit cheesecake is a great way to finish the meal. I am dreaming about it as I wrote now."}
{"text":"I was excited to come here after reading all of the reviews. I was in town on vacation, and many friends had recommended this place. 

Thankfully, I made a reservation. There was a huge line when we arrived. I liked the feel of the restuarant, but wasn't blown away by the food. Maybe it's because I live in NYC and we have some amazing tapas places (Boqueria), but I wasn't so impressed. The sliders were delicious, but the paella left something to be desired. It was dry and not very flavorful. 

I wouldn't come back to the restaurant when I am on vacation, but if I was a local, I could see myself coming back for drinks. Seems like a great place for a date."}
{"text":"It was a busy Saturday night.  We waited about half an hour to get seated, which was fine.  The food was good, but the SERVICE, was what makes it a true 5-star experience.  The mussels & and the flan were probably my favorite.. the octopus was a bit over cooked but still tasted alright.  I highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"Wow, that's some good stuff. Went to a trip to Vegas recently, and didn't feel like spending $60 per person eating on the strip so we went to Firefly for some Tapas. 

The stuffed dates had an interesting taste. Interesting good. Sweet dates, salty bacon, crunchy nuts. Very nice texture. 

The meat empanada was spectacular. It's a small empanada, but cooked very nice and had a cream sauce that went well. 

We had a mushroom dish that was basically mushrooms with a creamy sauce on top of a pastry. Good and pretty filling as well.

Fried calamari - yum! Tentacles were better than the rings. 

Sangria was pretty good. Might not be the best, but certainly not the worst. 

Lunch for two was just over $40, but we only had one glass of sangria, so if you're a drinker, it'll cost a bit more. This is a place I'll visit again if I go to Vegas again. Nice to know you don't have to spend alot to get a nice, \"different\" meal not too far from The Strip."}
{"text":"Some of the best tap food I have had, a definite hidden gem of Las Vegas. Worth the trip off the strip, the chicken salad was great and the chocolate cherry bread pudding is awfully tasty."}
{"text":"We love this place!  Both here and the one on Paradise.  The prices can't be beat.  Every tapas we tried was absolutely delicious.  We try and come here every time we visit Vegas."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying Pepe, my waiter is the best waiter I've ever had in my life. No kidding. This place was already a favorite of my mine just because of the food but the service was amazing tonight.  Pepe kept my glass full, ensured there were no food allergies, really just went the extra mile. Hands down great service. He said he inly serves on Friday nights. .. not sure why though because he's great at what he does. I'll def be requesting his section going forward. 

Food is delicious. Worth the wait every time to enjoy this great food. Red sangria is my favorite, order by the pitcher, it's a better deal and ur going to want a few glasses! 

Thank you Firefly for great service with Pepe and delicious food!"}
{"text":"The food was great. We had the tomato-basil soup, Grilled Veggies, Firefly fries, and warm spinach salad. The house Sangria was awesome as well.

It was a nice sunny day and they have a nice patio!

Service - meh. The waiter brought in 2 wrong dishes even though we asked questions about those dishes before ordering. By the time the food arrived, we had already waited more than 30 minutes.

I guess the worst part of the experience was that I was charged double the actual amount that I signed for. I called to correct this, and they were very nice, friendly and apologetic but its more than a month later and I still don't have a refund. My advice would be to check your bill twice and make sure you keep a copy in case you need to dispute it later."}
{"text":"This is by far one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas. The menu has a wide variety and since the portions are small, you can try so many different things. The octopus, grilled shrimp, petite fillet were among my favorites. Great ambiance!"}
{"text":"amazing food. bacon wrapped dates. filet mignon perfect. diablo shrimp and sangria all amazing! great food great drinks amazing service!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is fun and has great food.  I had the Crispy duck roll, Firefly fries, Empanadas, and the Mac n Cheese.  Very tasty.

I will say that I prefer not to go when it's busy. A. The line gets long.  B. It's really loud.  This is the only reason for the 4 stars. :-)

Also, the service has also improved since the last time I was here.  Normally I have to ask for my drink to be refilled.  The buser was right on it this time, filling my drink 3 times."}
{"text":"Where am I?? Barcelona! Amazing tapas and delightful sangria. Loved the padron peppers, shrimp ceviche, eggplant cannelloni, camerone al ajillo and empanadas.  New favorite Vegas dining location! Great service and upbeat atmosphere."}
{"text":"4 1/2 stars. Came here about 8pm on a Sunday night. There were a handful of people waiting and although the hostess said it'd be a 20-25 min wait for our party of two, we got seated in 10 min! Several different dining areas- outside, the main inside, and another inside dining area adjacent to the main one accessible from a separate entrance. The interior was nice and somewhat dark, good for a date or even a large party.  
The mojito i ordered was really really good! I could've easily downed several although I kept it to one. I tried the red sangria which was good too but very light, almost watered down. We tried several of the waiter's suggestions- the stuffed dates (SOOO good), and the Tierra y mar (Shrimp, filet, sausage skewers) which was also good but not to die for.  The Tuna tartare was really really good! But the Grilled octopus was not what I expected. But I prefer raw over cooked octopus and I had the whole plate to myself which was even more unpalatable. The Petite filet was very good and the Fish sticks were so good and crunchy and meaty n tender on the inside. 6 tapas and the 2 drinks for $65. I would definitely return."}
{"text":"The food is amazing! Best tapa definitely the camerones de la diabla (name may not be correct)! The service is awesome. Great experience overall!"}
{"text":"Ordered an UberEats delivery from here and every single thing I got was amazing"}
{"text":"Aside from Jaleo, this is another amazing place for tapas. Unlike Jaleo however, this place is more casual (scratch that, VERY casual) thus the price is also lower. I still prefer Jaleo due to the distance and the ratio of GREAT dishes vs  GOOD dishes is slightly higher at Jaleo's. However, I will be back for the spicy prawns dish which was divine!!"}
{"text":"I honestly come to Vegas all the time and had no clue this place existed. I am so happy my friend took me here. The server(Mario) was very accommodating to the allergies in our group and super nice. The tapas are so delicious. My fav was the Mac n cheese and the firefly french fries. Basically anything with cheese was super sexy. Def coming back."}
{"text":"I should've done this sooner, but we celebrated my best friends birthday on March 31st and Fireflys did a wonderful job at accommodating our entire party. Our server was Ivan and he was just awesome! The manager on duty was awesome as well although I can't remember his name. Fireflys is one of my favorite places to grab a bite to eat and have some drinks. Their food is amazing and my favorite drink is the sparkling Sangria which is amazing as well."}
{"text":"i cant say anything different than anyone else has besides oh god i miss those dates like my cross country grandmother.

and the sangria was nice but i knew better than to drink too much...sweet!

by far the most inspired and worthwhile meal i had while in las vegas."}
{"text":"Traditional tapas aren't really my thing. I just determined that I'm not a huge fan of Spanish cuisine thus far (paella is good though...). That being said, I do like small dishes as a concept and Firefly executes this so well without coming off with an ounce of pretentiousness.

This place is very laid back - visually, it has more in common with a nicer bar than a fine dining establishment. But don't let that fool you, the quality of the food here is top notch. Keep in mind though, it lies in a small strip mall with minimal parking, so brush up on your parking lot stalking skills or take a cab.

Here, Firefly offers a wide variety of food in tapas form, but doesn't constrain itself to traditional tapas fare, which worked out perfectly for me. There's also French, American, Thai, and Chinese-inspired dishes here too. We had a decent-sized party, and we went to town here: bacon wrapped dates, french-style mushroom tarts, lamb skewers, filet mignon sliders, the list goes on. There is something for everyone here and everything they did, they did well.

I will happily suggest and introduce this place to others next time I come back to Vegas."}
{"text":"Ah, Vegas.  Revisiting the past again.  I actually ate at Firefly for the first time years ago when my wife and I were visiting with our friends and were guided here by an old high school friend that lives in LV now.  Prior to eating at Firefly, my wife and I had never had Tapas.  Being in town for CES last weekend with the same friends that came the first time, they requested to revisit Firefly for a dinner and we obliged.

When my wife found out that they wanted to come back, she had a feeling of discomfort associated with the restaurant that should couldn't really place the reason behind at the time.  But as soon as we walked in, it came back to her; she didn't like sitting at the lounge table.  For those of you who have not been before, be aware that there is a bar, a set of normal tables with chairs and booth seats, and then a number of tables surround by low couches that require leaning over a lot to eat.  We requested a normal dining table this time to appease her, and it made all the difference.

When we arrived on Thursday night after our first day at CES, it was already pretty hopping.  We put our names down for a table and went to the bar.  I remembered having the Sangria last time, but didn't remember how good it was.  I asked the bar tender if I could try the red wine Sangria (effectively ordering it), but then he actually made a mini version of the drink with fruit bits and all for me to try it.  I then asked to try the white and champagne Sangrias (meeting more and more resistance each time, understandably) before ordering the champagne version.  The fact that he was wiling to let me sample all three was greatly appreciated.  Great bar tender.  My wife ordered a Mojito (so-so), and then a couple caramel apple martinis because they blew her away.  Highly recommended.

Soon we were told a table was available for us and we sat at a comfortable, standard table.  Here is what we ordered (that I can recall) and our impressions:

Shrimp ceviche - Nice shrimp, but way too citrusy (sour).

Stuffed dates - A great blend of sweet and savory (dates + bacon).

French Fries - A great filler. Shoestring with Parmesan and herbs. Ask for aioli to dip in.

Manchego Mac 'n Cheese - A favorite for my wife (the mac 'n cheese connoisseur).  Very good and cheesy.

Terra y Mare Skewers - Tasty and good quality filet, shrimp, and chorizo.

Chicken and Chorizo stuffed mushrooms - Sizzling awesomeness.  They're hot when they first come out, so be careful.

Lamb skewers - Very good and tender.

Fried calamari - I don't like squid, so I didn't really partake, but the other three said it was very good.

Camarones a la diabla - Shrimp with a nice kick and a smoky sauce.  Good stuff.

Chocolate Tres Leches Cake - Amazing! Melts in your mouth. No chewing necessary.  Super soft and moist.  Drooling...

With the 10 entrees and multiple rounds of drinks, you'd think the bill would be nuts, but it was around $150 total, which is perfectly reasonable for 4 people given the quality, variety, and quantity.  I recommend you check this place out if you want a great tapas experience.  There's a nice cigar bar in the same strip mall, too.

Summary: Great food. Very reasonable prices.  High quality.  Full bar.  Lots of parking.  Place gets hopping at night, so come early or plan for a wait.  Great bar service and drinks.  Lounge seating and normal tables.  Lounge seats require leaning forward a lot.  Highly recommended restaurant."}

{"text":"This is the best tapas restaurant! I've had tapas in Miami and DC (at places that receive raves), but this place blows the others out of the water. It's worth it to get away from the strip. 

Everything was so flavorful and well executed than their price would have you believe. We had the following, starting from my faves to least faves. Mind you, they were ALL great!

STUFFED DATES
(bacon-wrapped, smoked almond, red wine reduction, blue cheese)
This dish was fantastic. I'm not even really into bacon, but they do it well here and it's fully cooked, not soft as it can be sometimes, when it's wrapped around other items. Get this dish. 

PADRON PEPPERS
([flash-fried, touch of salt; most are mild)
These were the most surprising of the bunch. I mean, they're little peppers and fried with salt - and it comes with lemon to squeeze on top of it. All of the flavors make sense. So simple but SO good. You have to try this dish as well. 

STEAMED MUSSELS
(red curry, white wine, and coconut cream)
These mussels are very 'meaty' and fresh and tasty. The coconut cream is very pronounced, so if you like that, order this dish. I could do with some more flavor that comes through besides the cream, but it was great. It comes with 2 large toasts topped with cheese. Let it sit in the cream to soften by soaking up the broth. 

TIERRA Y MAR SKEWERS
(grilled shrimp, filet mignon, chorizo sausage, salsa verde)
This dish comes after the mussels for me, only because I'm not a total meat lover, but this is great. It's a pretty decent portion, so be forwarned. The meat and seafood have a nice flavor from the grilling and the sauce is perfect. 

CRISPY DUCK ROLL
It's duck inside of an eggroll wrapper, hence the roll in the name. This was tasty - and the cherry hoisin sauce made this dish. 

BANANA NUTELLA SANDWICHES
Come on, it's got nutella in it. You know it's good. Bread, filled with banana and nutella, grilled so the nutella is nice and melted. It comes with a sauce/dip that tasted like hot chocolate. NOM. It's like a a crepe, but sturdier. We've decided to make these at home."}
{"text":"Awesome service and atmosphere. The menu is deep and diverse with something for everyone's taste buds. 

Took a group of six for lunch today. Everything was amazing. I especially liked the beef skewers, the and the artichoke hearts. We sampled 7 dishes and ordered a total of 10, since we doubled up on the skewers, the artichoke, and croquettes (so amazingly good!)

The sangria was also great. Overall I would highly recommend it"}
{"text":"I love this place! We come eat here every time we are in Las Vegas. Delicious, flavorful tapas & sangria!"}
{"text":"Came here with a friend.  Great place to share several items.  Everything we had was great.   The sangria is delicious as well.  The portions are large for small plates."}
{"text":"Thanks to Alejandro Garcia and the chef our trip to Firefly was enjoyable and delicious! We ordered the escargot, the huevos estradelldos, the skirt steak, calamari, empanadas, petite filet, tuna tartar finishing up with the flan and tres leches. Everything was perfect and we can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and experience. Make sure to order the ahi tuna tartare and baked goat cheese. Our server Eder was AWESOME!!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing! Great happy hour specials too. They just need to add more tables and more staff...then it will make the five star rating."}
{"text":"We ordered so many things I can't even remember! I do however remember the LAMB! Melt in your mouth and full of amazing flavor! The mac n cheese was delicious! And please order the pitcher of sparkling sangria!!!! It is the BEST I've ever had!!! How will my life go on without that, I have no idea! 
A MUST!!!"}
{"text":"Went there tonight. Nice place. Food was excellent and that service at the bar was great."}
{"text":"We came Friday night around 6:30, and there was no wait. How lucky are we!! We sat down and Alejandro took our orders. He was friendly, courteous, and helpful. We ordered the seafood paella, lamb chops, bacon wrapped dates, and the shrimp cervici. The dates were a bit too sweet for my liking. The lamb chops though tasted perfecto!!! Yummm.... The paella was cooked great but a huge portion and it came after the tapas with good timing. 

All in all its a great place to be and the service was excellent thank you !!"}
{"text":"Love this place. The paella is awesome with a great balance of sauteed chorizo, mussels, chicken and shrimp. One of my favorite tapas meals are the bacon wrapped dates. 

They have a short happy hour during the week but they give half off on all their nice mojitos and the sangria. I personally like the paradise mojito which has the pineapple juice. Definitely a great place for Spanish tapas off the strip."}
{"text":"I frequently visit Firefly Downtown for food, drinks, great customer service, and the atmosphere. Theres only been one instance when I was unhappy with the service.

First Timer?
Go for Happy Hour and order a pitcher of the Sparkling Sangria (even if you're not a sangria fan, because I'm not and I love it)
Also, can't go wrong with the Filet Mignon Sliders."}
{"text":"My first tapas experience was at a Strip restaurant 4 years ago. The bill for two people was $70+ and we left still very hungry. I have been scared to try tapas since, until I couldn't stop hearing about how amazing Firefly was. Unfortunately, Firefly ended up being more or less the same as that other restaurant: really small plates, mediocre food, and overpriced. 

Bacon Wrapped Dates - These were pretty decent but the bacon was so hard that it could be viewed as a weapon in prison. 

Manchego Mac and Cheese - Really cheesy but I can make a 9 x 13 pan of margherita mac for only a couple bucks more. Not worth it.

Vegetable Empanada - The crust was yummy and flaky but the filling wasn't as delicious. My husband didn't finish his half. 

Firefly fries - big serving and decent but I wasn't planning on getting full from fries alone.

Our bill was $24 for those dishes and we left to get different food because I didn't want to drop $70 to get full off of seemingly mediocre food. I think if you're the type of person to who doesn't need much to get full and likes variety, Firefly is for you. For those of us who have a never-ending appetite, you'll go broke before you're full eating here."}
{"text":"My husband and I really enjoyed our late lunch here.  It wasn't crowded and service was very friendly and attentive.

Bacon wrapped dates:  5/5 - if you've never had it, they are delicious.  
Sangria:  3/5 - it was kind of weak
Tomato Bread/Pan con tomate:  3.5/5 - nice crisp to it; not soggy
Tortilla a la espanola:  2/5 - bland
Camarones a la diabla:  3/5 - large shrimp in an asian sweet and sour sauce.
Ham and cheese croquetas:  4/5 - standard, but the standard is delicious
Filet mignon sliders:  5/5 - the best dish by far"}
{"text":"The light sangria was good- although a bit tooo \"iced up\" and the chunks of fruit needs to be a little bigger. The stuffed dates would have been good if the bacon wasn't to dry or crisp- i think prosciutto would've worked better...but the sliders were good. the ambiance kind of sucked- we ate outside and it was literally in the middle of the parking lot- it would have been nice if they could've covered it with greenery or face the outside dining on the sidewalk to see passer-by's even then it was kind of whacked...i guess coming from the hotels and all of sudden being out in the middle of the parking lot- i have to take off points for the ambiance...our waiter kind of sucked too- you would think they would at least talk about the menu a bit and be excited about being there! i guess if you're gonna check this place out- I suggest you eat inside- the place is forgettable not one i'd go back to when I'm Vegas...I've had better tapas and sangrias..."}
{"text":"This was my very first time trying tapas, and OMG I'm so glad I did. 

We came a few weeks ago on a Vegas trip, and I cant believe I totally forgot to review the place till now. My memory is a bit foggy, with no help from the fact that I was already tipsy when I got there in the first place. 

We made reservations for I think 7pm, got there just before then, and were asked to wait at the bar for a good 10 mins. No big deal, the place was packed, and I know there's only so much a place can do to get people out when they want. We ordered drinks from the bar, I got a Pomegranate Mojito, the bf got a simple Gin&Tonic. My Mojito was pretty boring, and the G&T was not too weak, but not all gin. 

We got to the table and the server recommended I try the Sangria, which was an easy choice since it is featured on the drink menu with a big box around it. And I'm glad I did because it was delicious. The bf got red wine, but neither of us can remember what kind or if he even liked it. Now, I sure don't remember the specific dishes we ordered, but here's what I can... Chicken skewers of some sort, DELICIOUS, Filet, BOMB, Escargot scallops, HOLY MOTHER SO GOOD, and shrimp something or other, AMAZE-BALLS. And I cant choose a favorite. They were all SOO GOOD. I cant wait to go back to Vegas just so I can eat here. I honestly think this was my favorite part of our 2 day trip. I really think this place could have had a lot of things wrong with it and if the food was as is I think I'd still give it 5 stars. It was that enjoyable. But alas, the service was good, the drinks were good, the atmosphere was great, and the food was off the hook.

Beter start planning another trip..."}
{"text":"Ceviche of shrimp was my favorite tapa here. From there on we paired the Firefly fries, Firefly fish sticks, and Serrano ham sliders together for a full meal. The ham sliders were actually more like hamburgers but were the better off the three. Four dishes and we were stuffed. Felt a little expensive but they are tapas so we knew what we were getting ahead of time."}
{"text":"I really like this place. I try to visit this place every time I'm back in town. The food is great and the prices can't be beat. Its open pretty late, but it can get packed pretty quick, but its defintely worth the wait. Service is okay, its better than average. The bacon wrapped dates are amazing, the flavor combination is great. The mac and cheese was pretty plain, I think it lacked flavor. Patatas bravas was so good, especially when they serve it with that sauce. The sliders are also a must try, the texture and flavor go very well together. The atmosphere of this place can get pretty loud, but its still a great eatery."}
{"text":"Came here as a farewell Sunday brunch to reflect on all the poor decisions we made over the weekend in Vegas. And it was also my mom's birthday.

I live in LA, where \"tapas\" are like $20 each and you get a serving that looks like a Costco sample. I was hesitant about coming here but I wanted to try and be a good son for once so we tried it out. 

The menu is HUGE. Lots of options that made the decision difficult so we just said funk it and ordered a bunch of stuff. Avocado toast, chilequiles, steak and mushroom skewers, calamari, a couple other things I can't remember, and the chicken mushroom paella. The paella was decent, nothing groundbreaking, but all the tapas were DELICIOUS. And affordably priced for the generous portions. I was surprised. We didn't really need to eat the paella by the time it came out but we're American so obviously we didn't just stop eating when we were full. Come on.

Service was kind of bad, but the waiter made up for it by offering a complimentary espresso and a flan for my mother. I didn't eat any, but my mom said the flan was amazing. Now she's inspired and sending me pics of her in the kitchen at home working on her own flan recipe. Thanks Firefly...you inspired a new chef."}
{"text":"If you're looking for tapas in Vegas, this is the place to go! My friends and I came here for dinner one night and ordered the Mixed Paella and 4 tapas to share. We also ordered a pitcher of Sangria. The Sangria was light and sweet. The Paella takes about 40 minutes to prepare so make sure you order that with your waiter as soon as you sit down! 

They bring out a nice garlic herb bread with sweet almond butter while you are waiting for your food. my party ordered the ceviche, tuna tartare with taro chips, bacon-wrapped stuffed dates, and pulpo asado (grilled octopus). All of the tapas were delicious and left us craving for more but we knew not to order any more while we waited on our paella. The paella came out and it was huge! I do not understand how a paella serves 2-4 people. I cannot imagine 2 people sharing a whole paella. The paella was good with a nice assortment of seafood and meats. However, it was a little disappointing that the paella didn't have any soccarat at all. I understand that it was probably because they were in a rush to serve us since we were sitting there with no food after we finished our tapas. However, I would have rather waited for the paella to finish cooking fully. 

Overall, good food, good service and nice atmosphere/decor! I would definitely just stick with the tapas next time though. 

P.S. it is a little pricey but it's Vegas, right?"}
{"text":"Good local spot.  Great place to go w friends for drinks and quality food.  Open pretty late as well."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas.  The bacon-wrapped dates are a MUST as well as the fruit and cheese plate for dessert.  Awesome sangria (the white is my fave) and a fun, casual atmosphere.  Super friendly staff and a great way to try a bunch of different dishes.  Super reasonable prices and the food comes out insanely quickly!  Love, love love!"}
{"text":"This is very mediocre \"spanish\" cuisine.  The Serrnao ham had the descriptor \"Iberico\" next to it but it tasted like it came straight out of a package from Giant or Safeway.  It was hidden on the plate by thick blocks of cheese (again tasted like it came straight out of a grocery package).  The grilled octopus was overpowered by both in taste and presentation by the sauce.  The saving grace was the paella which was passable but unfortunately, it was overcooked.  On a side note, how do you call yourself a Spanish restaurant when you serve butter with your bread?"}
{"text":"We found this place on Yelp and decided to try it in Vegas.  Its a little bit off the strip, but no worries.  There were four of us and to start we ordered 8 plates and a pitcher of Mojitos. 

First the Mojito was actually too minty, but once the ice melted a bit, it was excellent.  

The first 8 dishes came out, I don't remember them all but it was fantastic.  The highlights were a savory shrimp dish, the filet migon sliders, and fried calamari.

For the second round we just asked the waiters for suggestions, have gave us three and they might have been the three best dishes for the whole meal.    Try the Stuffed Dates, Bacon + Dates + Cheese, so freaking good. We also got the Diablo shrimp and these skewers with sausage, beef and shrimp.

All in all this places is amazing, in particular the shrimp dishes."}
{"text":"This restaurant is delicious and is very cost effective (especially for Las Vegas standards). I actually came here by myself while attending a conference and liked it so much that when my boyfriend joined me for the weekend we went back here. The Chicken Tinga Empanada is amazing, should be your first choice tapa! The patatas bravas are classic. Got a strawberry mojito too, which I would also recommend. Ambiance and service are good too...aka you should definitely go here for dinner."}
{"text":"First time.  Don't know what took my so long.  I live like 2 minutes away.  Now I'm sad I didn't start going sooner.  Great atmosphere.  Nice mix of clientele.  Only down side was that it was packed on a Tuesday night and we had to circle to find a parking spot.  The wine list was pretty good but I would have liked to see some more Spanish wines.  The food was solid and the service was good.  I'm going to make  this a regular stop on my way home.  I think the best dish was bacon wrapped dates and I don't like dates.  The small loser was the calamari, it was good but they did not give enough aioli, but he calamari was seasoned well enough that it didn't require sauce.   Service was good.  I'll review again as I try more dishes."}
{"text":"This was one of the first restaurants in Vegas we went to and we were not disappointed.  Very clean, great food and service.  Very busy, but we were able to get right in.  We made an evening out of the many different dishes and we enjoyed them all.  The plates are actually bigger than you would expect and we probably ordered more food than we actually needed... But, it was so good and different!  Highly recommend and the prices were fair.  My fiancee' loved their Mojito's!"}
{"text":"Even on a Monday this place is great for after work drinks or dates or just come with friends the vibe very hip they have a bar in the middle and an outside patio area .the dress is dressy casual in case the ladies were wondering ..the servers are great very attentive and friendly and the food is perfect small bites of a variety !!!!"}
{"text":"with the recent salmonella outbreak i don't know if i will ever go back ... i didn't find the little bit of food i did try to be very good anyhow... sorry just not a big fan ... their mojitos aren't bad"}
{"text":"After 30 minutes waiting we decided to take one of the bar tables and keep ourselves busy until the 45 mins to 1 hr waiting was over and we could get a table. We were 4 bar tall tables with 2 chairs each. 2 of us took the chairs and 2 were standing. Before we could order drinks someone came and told us we can't take that table without ordering and it's not our turn yet! There were 3 other empty small bar tables! For a Monday night we decided it was not worth the wait in a place where we couldn't even get a drink when waiting and left."}
{"text":"Love this place. Perfectly executed food, perfect service, perfect drinks. If I had a restaurant I would wish it would be this great. If Gordon Ramsay came into this place on Kitchen Nightmares, he would say 'what is this a joke-there is not one thing wrong here'. Love it!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed Firefly. I went for dinner with a co worker and we really enjoyed our meals and the atmosphere.  we got several small plates and all of them were good."}
{"text":"Preface: On Friday & Saturday nights - naturally the busiest nights - they do NOT accept reservations for small parties.  Expect about an hour wait, but the cocktail bar makes it go by quickly.

The entire experience with Firefly was pretty good.  It was jam packed on a Saturday night when we showed at 7:30, and we did wait about an hour for our small two-top in the back corner.  The restaurant is pretty small and it was full of larger parties - more than one bachelorette party, or so I'm assuming by the amount of pink boas and other paraphanaelia I noticed.

I enjoyed almost everything we had.  Started with a pitcher of red sangria and it was amazing.  A little sweet though; by the end of the pitcher we couldn't even finish our last glasses.  Then again, both the bf & I are dry martini drinkers, so don't let my experience sway you from trying it.

We had the tuna tartar - awesome, shrimp ceviche - awesome, surf & turf skewers - awesome, & mac n cheese - passable.  I live for mac n cheese, and I could have lived without this one.  It was extremely sharp in flavor, and that's just not my style.

The only thing I didn't try that I really wanted was the cherry chocolate bread pudding, which I hear is great.  Next time.

Five stars for the atmosphere, cocktails & service.  Four stars for the packed in tables (I couldn't get out of my seat without bumping the table next to us...and I'm not a big person) and food.  Next time I'd like to try the patio seats and maybe on a weekday when it isn't so crazy packed."}
{"text":"This place a amazing. We ate outside and it was so nice and open. Service was good our waiter was friendly and attentive. The tapas plates were of average size. The bacon wrapped dates were so good so flavorful I would just come back for that dish!  The muscles in a curry sauce as ok could have more flavor to it. Got to have the red sangria we had two pitchers so good!"}
{"text":"Cool spot. Good vibe and buzz. Try the mojito and some tapas. Dig the make shift dance floor and the paintings on the wall. Its a \"to see and be seen\" kinda spot, but its not stuffy like some places I've been Hmmm...Japengo - La Jolla. Ha! These cats own Dragonfly next door, if you are in the mood for Asian grub and can't stand the waits. Yup."}
{"text":"Solid off the strip spot in Vegas, def worth hittin up to get away from the madness. Tapas style restaurant lots of good bites.  4 of us went on a Monday and had no problem getting a table for 7:30. We tried lots of the dishes, some better than others, but for the $$ all and all it was a good meal. I'd go back !for sure"}
{"text":"I had my wedding reception here that hosted about 70 people. The planning process with their event coordinator, Valeria was very professional and very accomodating. I was able to bring in my own decorations. They set everything up for us and it was amazing! 

Now lets talk about the food. We did the Meal #2 plan I believe, which consisted of 5 tapas: bacon wrapped dates, albondigas, artichoke toasts, and the other 2 I can't remember because I was busy with everything.. They were all amazing! I wish I was able to eat more and enjoy it! We had a salad included in our meal. For the main course, we had steak freitas... AMAZING! and some type of rotissorie chicken. We had seafood paella with the main course and it was one of the best  We also had chocolate cake and flan that was served as the dessert. Oh, and the bar was very convienent as well since it was just for our guests.

Overall, the restaurant staff was great. They were all very welcoming and catered to every need. We had our own private banquet room that fit everyone perfectly. The only downside was it was a bit hot in there. I do plan to eat there the next time I am in Vegas. If I were driving by I probably would have not stopped to eat, but I did find the reviews on yelp very helpful in selecting this location for my wedding reception!"}
{"text":"Located just South of the Strip, Firefly on Paradise has become an essential stop that brightens the already ecstatic Vegas experience usually felt by yours truly.

This place oozes Vegas in all senses. From the dim lights above, to the bright lights around the bar and along the walkways, the banter, laughter, cheers, showoffs, care-nots, great service and what matters the most, GREAT food.  

The wait was (and usually is) relatively long as we entered the packed house. It was just my sister and I.. that being the case, we noticed a couple available stools bar-top and nabbed them on the (fire)fly. It's not necessarily the case in ALL restaurants with a bar, but I noticed that because there's more action here, you'll probably get an attentive bartender, prompt service and  a quicker food turn around time. 

Spanish tapas / small plate style.. Ladies and gentlemen, this means you'll be eating more than one dish tonight!  

First dish that was placed before us was the chicken and chorizo stuffed mushrooms.. though quite small in size, they definitely pack a punch when it comes to flavor.. probably because of the chorizo.

Second, Serrano Sliders.. mini burgers with Serrano ham, bleu cheese & crispy onions, cooked Medium rare; Not sure why we ordered mini-burgers.. they played the 'void' filler until our next dish arrived. I enjoyed the bleu cheese, but asked for medium rare and they came back to us a little too well done.. dry & crunchy. They happily replaced them and got us a new order within minutes. Very nice service.

Third, Steamed Mussles.. steamed in white wine with an heirloom tomato, garlic, herb butter with parmesan crustini. I'm not even a fan of the things, but the Mussels were the best tasting seafood item that I've had in a quick minute. It's really the sauce that made it.. the best way I can describe it would be the equivalent to a creamy Alfredo, minus the pasta. It masked that 'fresh out of the water' taste, which I don't mind.

And Fourth, the item that stole my heart.. the baby back ribs covered with an out of this world BBQ mango sauce. Fall off the bone tenderness covered with a sweet finger lickin' sauce that'll have your tongue and lips slurpin' and smackin' through every bite. I'd get a full rack of these alone. Straight up, yo. 

Our bartender was on point; we were continuously checked on, had our waters refilled, if my beer was low another was offered (this is how you keep me here) and aside from the slider mishap.. everything here was tasty and the atmosphere sparked the perfect start for our night. We'll be back to explore the rest of that menu!"}
{"text":"Thank you yelpers.... I was in the area and was looking for a good meal.  Yelpers directed me here and it was OUTSTANDING!!!  Service was great and the food was the bomb.  Waitress recommended most of our dishes and she knew her stuff.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"My friend Karen recommended this place, it was fantastic!  We ordered the manchego mac-n-cheese, patatas braves, vegetarian empanada, and the stuffed red bell pepper.  At first, I thought having one empanada wasn't enough, but with the other dishes combined, it turned out I couldn't eat another bite!  We also ordered a pitcher of their delicious red sangria.

What I also liked about this place was there were a lot of vegetarian options, which I usually don't see at a tapas place.

We also ordered the spicy chickpeas, but it never came out.  I'm glad it didn't because, like I said, I was full.  I would love to come back here and try more of their dishes."}
{"text":"Good was good, service left a lot to be desired. We waited 30 minutes between plates. I ordered a medium petite filet and it was cooked to death and flavorless. The patatas bravas, smoked salmon, tuna tartar and camarones diablas were all delicious! The sangria was heavenly"}
{"text":"Had a great little dinner here with friends.  Worth more visits.  Keywords:  Fun, Eclectic, Off-strip, Tapas. 

We had (and I recommend all of these) Eggplant cannelloni w goat cheese. Pulpas (grilled octopus) to die for. Lamb sausage.  Tomato soup with brue grilled cheese.

The dessert platter is a must:  lemon tart with flavor that exploded in my mouth; Tres leches was a choc cake soaked in cream; A little flan,  very nice;  and Little tartlets with pastry cream and fruit.

Great prices and decent wine by the glass."}
{"text":"I like this place and it seems very popular. The crowd is young and attractive. The culinary fair is of course \"tapas\" or what i consider tasty appetizer dishes where one orders in a way similar to a sushi bar.

I mostly enjoyed what I had, although, some in my party complained about the tapas being overly rich with shortening. I must concede some were. Over all I like the place and the young crowd.

I like the stuffed dates.

Parking can be intimidating."}
{"text":"Yes! The coveted 5 star rating. Why? How, you ask? Here are the deets my friends.

Food: Just from the complimentary bread, you already become charmed by Fireflys gastronomy. Smoked almond butter, olives, and spiced orange segments are perfect companions to the bread that was served. House made empanadas with its buttery crust, and deliciously braised pork filling hit a special place in my heart. Clams, chorizo and a savory tomato broth was memorable flavor as well. 

Service: The service here is like a well oiled machine. On top of everything from refills on bread/drinks, knowledge of the menu as well as alertness. Our server was warm and genuinely took pride in the work he was doing. 

Ambience: Spacious and dimly lit. It was festive but intimate at the same time. Dark wood and warmly painted walls transports you to Spain.

Verdict: Firefly rates up there with some of the best eats in Vegas."}
{"text":"I go to Firefly every time I come to Las Vegas, which is a couple times a year. Service this last time was adequate, in the past has always been fun and flirty with an attractive and attentive wait staff. The place is always noisy, so don't expect an intimate conversation!

So many great bites to choose from, some of my favorite are the Ahi Tuna Skewer, Steak & Mushroom Skewer, Baked Goat Cheese, Camarones ala Diabla, and Camarones Al Ajillo. The Stuffed Dates are usually my top pick, but they skimped on the goat cheese and the dates where tiny and dry this time. While the Flourless Chocolate Cake with raspberries was tasty, it was not moist. 

I'll definitely will be back again soon, just hope they tweak the shortcomings I noticed this last time."}
{"text":"Long overdue review. Came here in Feb during our trip to Vegas. This was the one restaurant that I was dying to try in Vegas. So I made the BF drive here straight from the airport, even before we checked into our hotel.  

Firefly sits in an unassuming location off the strip. I didn't expect it to be so big inside, but I guess everything is bigger in Vegas (or is that Texas?). Anyway, came during late lunchtime on a weekday, so the place was pretty empty. The menu looked so good that I wanted to order one of everything, but the BF convinced me to start with just five dishes first, probably a more sensible approach. 

Here are the dishes we tried:
Stuff Dates - my favorite dish! To be fair, I rarely met a stuffed date dish that I didn't like. The combination of the soft sweet dates, crunchy salty bacon and the stinky Gorgonzola cheese is just heavenly. 

Lamb Chops - oh how I love my lamb chops. I always try order it when I see it on the menu, even though most of my friends can't stand the taste of lamb (whatever, more for me). The chops here were seasoned well and perfectly cooked. The accompanied lentils and vegetables made me feel healthy, despite the fact that I just inhaled two lamb chops. 

Stuffed Peppers - not a dish that I would normally order, but I am so glad I listened to our waiter and got it here. The peppers had just a hint of spiciness and provided a perfect balance to the creamed cheese. I still think about this dish today... 

Shrimp in Sweet & Spicy Sauce - shrimps were well cooked, I didn't really taste the spicy note in the sauce, but it was a good sauce nevertheless 

Tuna Tartare - the most average dish among the ones we tried. I didn't think the tuna was very flavorful, although the taro chips were good. 

Trio of Gelato and Chocolate Tres Leches Cake - oh that cake, it was what dreams were made of, so fluffy, so moist and so chocolaty. I would marry it if I could. Or at least date it for as long as I can without the BF getting jealous. It was sooo perfect. The gelato were good too, but, they were like the jealous bridesmaids next to the cake. 

The service was a little weird, our waiter was extremely attentive in the beginning with recommendations and water refills. All five of our dishes came out in extremely quick successions, I understand the place was pretty quiet, but they could've slowed down and allowed us to savor the food instead of rushing us. Our small table was covered in plates in the span of 10 minutes. Also, our waiter disappeared once we've put the dessert and coffee order in.  I had to track down another waiter to finally get my coffee. Moreover the coffee came in a comically small cup, it was more like an espresso cup. I would normally take off a star for the weird service, but the food was soooo good that I am will to overlook it. 

Overall, I highly recommend the place, wish they would open an outpost in NYC!!"}
{"text":"This place is definitely one of the best local favorites in Vegas.  No longer a secret, be sure to make reservations or show up 2 hours before you expect to sit and eat.  

Usually I think tapas places are a rip off, but this place had delicious items for decent prices.  AND the service was great too.  I made reservations for a group of about 12, was able to push the reservation later on that same day, and my friends were seated 15 minutes early.  Even though the place was semi-crowded, we werent waiting forever for our drinks or food.

highlights of the menu:
crispy duck rolls, bacon-wrapped dates, ahi tuna skewers, and pretty much everything else.

major plus for affordable pitchers of mojitos and sangrias.  DEFINITLEY a MUST DO whenever you are in VEGAS."}
{"text":"Small tapas plates style restaurant. Food and service are both good. Would come back again. Not far off the strip and worth it. Got tired I eating on the strip with overpriced and low quality this took care of that. With a try."}
{"text":"My friend wanted to try this place all weekend but due to scheduling conflicts, we weren't able to go to dinner as planned. We did however, eat here for lunch right before we left and it was pretty good. I can admit I don't really care for tapas that much. A lot of the places I've had them at are really overpriced. This place was fairly resonable and the food was excellent as well as the service. Actually, now that I think of it, I probably enjoyed this place more because my two friends that won over the weekend paid for lunch. I think most can agree that food always tastes better when its free.

Two are of things I especially liked were the ham and cheese croquetas and the roasted eggplant cannelloni. Mmmmm. I'm really glad we were able to check this place out. 

As an added bonus, there was a really hot girl with huge knockers sitting across from us. She caught me staring twice ! I know this has nothing to do with my review of this restaurant but I just thought I'd share. After all, sharing is caring."}
{"text":"Amazing food.. And when I say amazing.... I mean absolutely amazing! The service... Well that is just icing on the cake. Every time I come, we are treated with the most amazing service I have ever experienced. Every server is on top of their game as well as super personable, attentive and friendly. Today we had Samantha and like usual, we were not disappointed! She took care of us with a friendly smile and quick efficient service. We are always bringing our friends here, introducing the \"amazingness\" that  IS Firefly."}
{"text":"Let me start off with MY only complaint: it was a little loud for my taste. My wife said its just cause I'm getting old as we were celebrating my 35th this past Friday in Vegas. But I'm a talker, and I like to talk and hear myself talk and the people I'm talking with talk, and the music playing made that a little difficult. With that being said, there is nothing else to complain about. So if you like a more quiet, intimate vibe, this isn't gonna be a spot you'll like.

So for those of you that don't know, tapas are small appetizer plates. In fact, most of the plates are no bigger than the size of the bowls most Mexican restaurants put salsa in. Don't expect big portions. These bite-sized Spanish appetizer plates are only a mere fraction of the size of a typical American app. Thus, if you are a big eater, you might want to order more than a couple. Or, go in decent group and share, as our party of 8 did.

When we arrived, the hostess told us it would be a 40-minute wait. We didn't complain because they had misters outside, which was very refreshing in the Las Vegas heat. We decided to go to the bar while we waited instead so that we could try the sangria everyone keeps talking about here on Yelp. Hands down, the best sangria I've had in a while. Better than the sangria they serve at Buca di Beppo, which was my favorite until I tasted the deliciousness of this red wine and fruity goodness! Twenty minutes into our wait, we were seated and expertly attended to. Service here is impeccable. We didn't have to ask for anything and they were quick with all our orders.

Moving on to our food, this is what we ordered and shared:

Stuffed dates- date wrapped in bacon, smoked almond, blue cheese and served in a red wine reduction. Winner all around. I'm not a big fan of blue cheese and I loved these! Portion size is about 4 or 5 dates. I'd highly recommend them.

Chorizo and chicken stuffed mushrooms- no explanation needed. Smokey chorizo flavor enhanced the earthiness of the mushroom and was nice on the chicken too.

Filet mignon sliders- moist, juicy, tender and if that flavor could be duplicated in a normal size burger, they'd run out of it everyday!

Lobster escargot- don't let the name fool you. No snails here. Just little balls of lobster tail meat in a garlic herb butter, and perfectly grilled.

Camarones a la diabla- just like the Mexican version, not as spicy. Very flavorful.

Baked filets of tilapia- herbs, lemon and garlic. Melt in your mouth white fish. 

Shrimp temura- beer battered, very crispy.

Tierra y Mar skewers- grilled shrimp, filet mignon, chorizo and salsa Verde. All cooked to perfection, all compliment each other.

Ribeye steak entree- 14 oz. ribeye in a red wine sauce, topped with cabrales cheese. Outstanding steak on its own. Tender, tasty, no A-1 needed.

Overall, make room for eating here while in Vegas. Unanimously vote on as being g a place to come back to on our next trip."}
{"text":"First time a couple years ago and everything was really good.

When I came back in July 2017, everything was subpar.

Best dish we had was:
chorizo clams
tuna tartare

would not order again:
stuffed dates (bacon charred, not very appetizing)
tierra y mar skewers (good but not memorable)
camarones a la diabla (they said the sauce was great...but it was not)
chocolate cherry bread pudding"}
{"text":"Love Rachel; love this location! Why the hell did they close after New Years? They have more than enough business at the Paradise location to fill this one. Then maybe the Paradise one wouldn't be an hour wait with reservations! It is called advertising, try it some time and this one would have been the new more successful one!"}
{"text":"Probably the best food i've had in Vegas in years. Not blazingly authentic in the dishes, but the spirit is good. We were lucky to get sucked in on a dinner with the sales guy and some customers, so a lot higher budget than normal. Still exceptional. Good service, great food."}
{"text":"On our last night visiting Las Vegas my friend took us to Firefly. It was the best meal we had there by far. We had been to a less than good place in the Venetian, where we shouldn't have chose to stay, for twice the price, half the quality, no view, and incompetent service. It was so freakin good I might even go back to Vegas, stay on Freemont, and eat there every meal. If more people stopped overpaying for crappy dinners they think tastes good based on location, who else eats there, and dress codes, Vegas might take a turn for the better."}
{"text":"This was a wonderful Tapas restaurant not far from the strip.  The food was fantastic and the service was great as well.  The stuffed dates were to die for!  The sliders were probably our least favorite of everything we ordered (and we ordered a lot :) ).  Can't wait to go back on our next trip!"}
{"text":"A great, inexpensive, off the Strip dining choice for Spanish tapas. I went there with my mom and aunt and several friends and really enjoyed myself.

They're open late and the sangria is also quite delicious!

UPDATE:
Do not miss the Thai beef salad.
And skip the tuna tartare!"}
{"text":"Delicious off strip meal. Mrs and I have now been a couple times and enjoyed it. It's easy to get caught up in ordering too much but just go for it. The food and drinks are amazing. Highly recommend the mojitos by the pitcher, and if you can get there for happy hour they are only $18."}
{"text":"LOVE this place!!!!!!!!!!! Just thinking about it makes my mouth water. I pretty much ordered half the menu b/c everything sounded so good! The lamb chops and dates are to die for and a must have! The white wine Sangria is DELISH! Way better than the red wine Sangria so definitely try it out. You can either order by the glass or pitcher. 

If you go for dinner, make sure to reserve a table. They get super busy. Be sure to let your tastebuds venture outside its comfort zone... everything on the menu is YUMMY!"}
{"text":"Amazing service and delicious food!!! I am a local and I enjoy coming to this place every time because every time servers like Oscar make my time there super special by recommending new things to try (like the tres leches cake...yummy!)  Sangria is a MUST with your tapas which always hit the spot and are not too heavy because the portions are just perfect.  

If you're a tourist and are looking for the perfect spot to have drinks while having a good ambience, definitely go here.  Love dining on the outdoor patio filled with charming lights and Spanish music. On Friday nights they even have Latin dancing!"}
{"text":"The best place to enjoy the Fremont Street Experience! The restaurant sits at one end of the street overlooking the canopy. It's decorated to be a modern dimly lit tapas house. It is red, to go along with their \"fire\" name.The service was respectable. They didn't have any tables ready for us so we sat at the bar area for some beverages where it seemed that no one wanted to sit. As soon as our table was ready, we were quickly seated close by the window with a view in the tower room. 

Everything on the menu looked so appetizing. I ended up getting the paella and we also got a few other tapas. The paella is definitely not like the spanish paella that I was accustomed to but it was tasty nonetheless. The tapas dishes were so good that we ended up ordering 2 of the same ones. Even though they were reasonably price, ordering twice of the same stuff added up pretty quickly!

Overall, a good place to just have light meals over drinks with friends. Nothing really spectacular about the taste and quality of the food or drinks, but the view was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Good menu, decent prices, service can get a bit bogged down during peak hours. Well worth a visit, just aim for an off hours visit if you can."}
{"text":"I'm torn. I loved this place the first few times eating here, so my wife and I decided to come here for a private event (our rehearsal dinner). The food was good, as always, however the service left something to be desired. 

We were told that, with the package we chose, we could have 6 different tapas and they would be served family style and  be all-you-can-eat. Well, there's a catch. Not only were they served on the usual small plates (not very family style-ish), but you can only order more food once all the courses come out. So after waiting (at least 10 minutes between each course), we were finally able to order more. By that time, though, no one felt like waiting any longer. 

The servers, though hard working and somewhat nice, seemed to be blind as to making sure drinks were adequately filled. Most people had to ask (in some cases, several times) to be served a drink.

I like this place. I love the food. There just seemed to be a little bit of a breakdown the night we were there. I'll be back, but won't be booking any more private events there.

Another tip: This is, in my opinion, the best tapas place in town...including the ones found on the strip. And DEFINITELY the best value."}
{"text":"My wife remember coming here a while back and so she said we had to go.  Happy she made me because this place is great!  Definite bang for your buck. We ordered the paella and almost killed it lol, definitely serves 4!

We also got some other tapas that were very good.  For dessert I got the chocolate tres leches cake. Yummy!!"}
{"text":"This review is long overdue!  My boyfriend and I visited Las Vegas for the first time last Valentine's day.  We stayed on the strip for all of our dining and entertainment.  On our last day, we were getting ready to drive home and had to go to the outskirts to fill up on gas, when we passed by this restaurant!  We were both hungry and saw that it offered small plates, tapas, which was just our style so we decided to go for it!  I can't remember what we ate, but it was SO yummy!!!  I am so happy that we happened upon this cute little place, and the next time we're in Vegas we're definitely going back!!"}
{"text":"This place is great! The atmosphere is so chill, and the decor is awesome. Food and service was great! Will defiantly be coming back!"}
{"text":"So I went to this place with pals J. and M. It was my last night hanging out in Vegas, and we were talking about coming here because of two things we have a love of: bacon, and mojitos. Well, I was satisfied.

This little tapas bar was definitely full of an early evening swingles crowd in sequined halters and those non-wrinkle-able slacks, but there were also some large groups and families sitting around. We got a table outside on the heated patio and the waiter brought a basket of yummy crostinis, black olives, and a sweet/garlicy butter. 

I had a raspberry mojito, and also tried the blood orange one. Both were delicious and I'm sure the other selections from the bar are just as good. Absolutely, you must try the figs wrapped in bacon in a red wine reduction, and the tuna tartar. Although not enough taro chips for the tuna tartar.

Other things worth trying are a variety of skewers, ceviche, and artichoke toasts. 

Our service was incredibly slow, although supposedly that is not the case at Firefly usually."}
{"text":"OK so I have mixed feelings about this place. I looked in the Summerlin business guidebook for a place that was late night and not fast food. Firefly looked very appealing. The ad and menu in the back of the book both stated they were open until 11. We arrived at 9:25, the hostess said they were about to close but if we \"hurried and ordered\" we could make it. Being super hungry we decided to stay and hurry our order. There was so much to choose from that it was a shame we had to pick the first thing that caught our eye. We were excited to try many plates but couldn't because we were rushed. The Dates were great as was the steak. When the food came out we asked if we could order dessert right then they said we just made the cut off time. We ordered the dessert sample platter, it was obviously pre made/plated. The dessert quality wasn't as good as the food. Plus, we were sitting at the bar and both had empty drinks and had to ask 2 times for more beer and water.  Another table had to walk up to the bar and ask for more wine, the bartender just handed the customer the entire bottle without even corking it. I could hear employees in the back talking about how its pointless to close at 10 when they allow people to stay until 11. When one of them came out I told him that the advertisement said 11. He expressed to me that some ads say 10 and some say 11. No big deal but we just felt like we were being rushed, There were so many great choices on the menu that we were looking forward to having the full Tapas experience. Great ambiance, we will try it again but this time will make sure we are there at a decent hour."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!

Every time I take a trip to Las Vegas, which is about every 2-3 months, i make sure I take a trip down to Fireflys!  Even if I am staying up at Green Valley, it is worth dealing with the Strip..... Trust Me.

I first found this place on Racheal Ray's show..... and remembered to check it out... each time I take a new guest to this place they LOVE it.

The best part about this place is that you can get  a \"Strip\" dinner (Special, Location, Festive, Fun) without the Strip price!!      The last 2 times I went there, with one other, we had 4 Tapas, each a drink, and dessert... we walked out with paying under $55 incl tip!

*****FAVs*****
Wrapped Dates
Sliders
Filet, Chorizo, & Shrimp skewers 
PLUS(i dont care how full you are, you MUST try..)
TRES LECHE for dessert... Heavenly"}
{"text":"Do get the bacon wrapped dates, as well as the braised ribs. Oh, and the lamb chops are pretty righteous too. I really wanted to try the paella as well, but the wait is pretty ridic (like 40 minutes). #lame"}
{"text":"Firefly is the ultimate, \"anytime\" go-to spot. Awesome tapas & refreshing drinks! You can come before or after work, with a group of friends or even a date. You can have dinner or dessert here, and even get hammered if you'd like. I highly recommend this place for you sangria &/or mojito lovers! Paradise mojito is my favorite.. As well as their sliders! I like their skewers and macaroni tapas. The atmosphere is kind of on the business formal or semi-formal looks. So put on a summer dress or button-up & prepare for a pitcher of your choice!"}
{"text":"What a fascinating place... Coming from NY- I have to say the tapas portions are double the size and half the price I'm use to... Hurray!! My boyfriend and I had about 6 dishes and 4 would have been plenty...
 Had the spinach salad........ MMMMMMMMMMMM sooo good... then artichoke bread... pass, the lamb kebabs were the most amazing thing Ive ever put in my mouth... and the server assistant accidentally gave us another round.. Whoops! we kept our mouth shut... We also tried one of the salads, eh.. OK... nothing special... The fries are ridiculously huge... Definitely not Tapas! But the flavor was out of this world good... Parmesan and garlic. mmmmmmmmmm... don't wast your money on the fillet Mignon with potatoes.... it just didn't cut it ... Didn't get around to desserts because we were so stuffed!! Will definitely be going back again!!!!!"}
{"text":"Got a mojito pitcher with my girls for happy hour and had a great time!

From what I can remember everything was so tasty and the waiters were hilarious. Don't know if it was the drunkeness or if everything was really that great! I vaguely remember something made with bacon and dates that was amazing. I don't even like bacon like that.

I think this has to be my most useless review ever but this place definitely gets 5 stars. :) food, drinks, service, ambiance, all were great. Next time I'm in Vegas I need to take better notes when I'm here.

I wish there was one of these in LA. I'd be there everyday with a mojito pitcher . Lol alcoholic..."}
{"text":"I give it 3.5 stars only because I have been to lots of tapas places and have had better food.

Maybe in Vegas this is the best place for Tapas?

It was ok. Good food. Nothing great. If I lived here would probably not come back."}
{"text":"I think everyone that had written a review for this place have probably said it all!

I'm so overdue for FIREFLY!"}
{"text":"Unprofessional stuff. For example: we order sparkling water it came later than food cause they forgot, than they brought bottle with only one glass. Food was ok, but we ordered skewer medium well, it came bloody. Very loud inviroment. The wine glass was sticky on the outside. I don't  know, just whole dinner experience was ruined."}
{"text":"Went for lunch, service was great, & food was so yummy! Had stuffed dates,  Apple salad, calamari, & scallops for tapas, & shared a mixed paella. Already too full, but the desserts were calling to us, so we had the tres leche cake & bread pudding...oh boy! So delicious! The service was very good & pleasant. Not crowded at lunch, but I imagine it's probably not the case in the evening. Such a nice change from the casino scene.  Go try!!"}
{"text":"By far on of the best places in town and not to mention there services was phenomenal our server Carlos was amazing explained and answered ever question I had about the menu, and to think that the only reason I ever came to firefly's was for the passion fruit cheesecake, that is out of this world!!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place!
Lets start with the bread with that amazing butter that I just can't have enough of.
Then I ordered the 
stuffed dates: I could eat 100 of those.
Camarones a la diabla, that sauce goes good with anything I used the sauce to dip my fries.
Stuffed peppers: ok..
Sliders: soooo good!!
Croquetas: like
And for dessert a tres leches cake, I know traditional tres leches cake and I've never seen a chocolate tres leches but it was good.
Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"I live in Vegas and I always enjoy going to Firefly.  It is my go to place to take people who come to town to visit.  There is a varied menu of tasty tapas with something for everyone.  Get a pitcher of sangria or mojito to really make things fun.  My wife and I have a handful of things that we enjoy, but after coming here many times with various people with different tastes, I have not had a bad dish here.  You can get out with a cheap lunch without drinks, but it is still reasonable for a full night of dinner and drinks.

Firefly is packed late night, but if you can manage to get a seat it's a great late night snack."}
{"text":"Came here while my brother and I were at a business conference. We heard so many great things about it and had to check it out. When you sit down they give you some garlic bread with an amazing butter spread. The butter tasted like some herb/chipotle/garlic butter. We ordered ribs which melted off the bone. Even when we tried grabbing the bone the meat was falling off. It was one of our favorite dishes. We also had chicken skewers that were just okay. They were a little chewy and the sauce could of been better. For the most part service was great and the food was good! I will for sure be back the next time I am in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Rachael Ray led me astray...  I tried this place after seeing RR's review on her show.  While the atmosphere and ambiance are nice, you'll leave finding the food mediocre at best."}
{"text":"Everything Is pretty much awesomely tasty here. I have been coming here for years, and it's always been a go-to, never-fail, dependably a good time kind of place to bring friends and out of town folks. The trendy atmosphere makes it perfect for a late-evening dinner-to-club/dancing restaurant, as they break out the dj and thumpa-thumpa as the night progresses. 

But what always sticks out is the food and drink. The sangrias are uber tasty, and potentially dangerous as they have the tendency to affect you more than you think.  I have a few regular dishes, but the ones that stick out in terms of must-try are the bacon-wrapped dates, the tortilla espanola, patatas bravas, and the camarones a la diabla.  Also, the tres leches and nutella sandwiches for dessert are always a crowd pleaser. The paella is pretty good, but I've had much better homemade (who hasn't?), however it definitely ranks high in terms of places that serve paella in town.

The service is very quick, however, I've learned that its usually best to order all that you want at the beginning as the tapas plates come out as they're made and not all at once. It can be kind of difficult to grab your server when it's really busy, but then again, they get really, really busy.  

My only complaint is that sometimes the music can be a little overbearing, especially when you're trying to converse with friends. I especially like the seating in the lounge area if you've got a big group, but that's where they put the music set up so if you're going late in the lounge, just beware it's more of a club atmosphere. However, if you're into that, it's a great place to be."}
{"text":"Every time my husband and I come to Vegas we make a stop at firefly. We love the variety of tapas. I am a vegetarian and they offer a lots of tasty options for me and carnivorous snacks for my husband. The blueberry mojito, which sounds weird, is actually amazing. Just try it!"}
{"text":"On separate occasions that I've gone, I have never EVER been disappointed and consistency is hard to come by nowadays. 

[AMBIANCE] 
your average I want to be chic but still chill and mellow
[SERVICE] 
friendly, pleasant, nothing less..
[FOOD]
 I cannot get enough of their menu, eclectic but not overbearing. 
With that said, these are my recommendation
+ crispy duck rolls 
+ paella (can never go wrong with that choice...not at firefly anyway)
+ Steak and mushroom skewers (not the most amazing thing on the menu, but if you're a carnivore like myself, it's always a must)
+ firefly fries - now this is not technically my recommendation but it was a good side, comparable to the truffle fries @ yardhouse
[DRINKS] 
if you're in Vegas and you want to bring the wild someone out of someone without the mess I recommend a pitcher of this creeper!
[OVERALL]
for someone who likes to get the most out of a buck, it's not bad. Be prepared its TAPAS style so don't expect hefty-size helpings, but a great place for big parties where you just want some good food, good conversation and again at vegas...it a change from the unusually LARGE meals and buffets"}
{"text":"Great location off the strip. Easy to find, plenty of parking. We went for an early dinner on a Monday night and sat out on the patio. Attentive service and fantastic food. We had the shrimp ceviche, croquettes, baked goat cheese and petite filet. Generous portions and this was more than enough food for the 2 of us.

Back again to treat my daughter and daughter-in-law for mother's day. Our reservation for 3 plus an infant was 545 on Saturday night. Although not a place you would normally take a baby, the girls just moved to Vegas and a sitter was not an option. They kindly accommodated us in a corner booth with plenty of room for the baby. (She slept most of the time and then smiled at & watched the staff bustling around). On top of the dishes from my first visit, we added the mushroom  tart, tuna tartare, lemon & berry tarts, stuffed dates. Again, it was all delicious. I tried the blood orange mojito which was so good I had a second. 

This place is a gem. There isn't another restaurant I've been to twice in 6 months, and I'd go back here today. If Vegas locals aren't eating here, they're missing out!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite nightspot in Vegas. Amazing sangria, great tapas, good looking people. It's gotten a bit too busy recently, but the attention is justified."}
{"text":"Great little off the strip place to check out. Went here during summer at around 10pm, and didn't want to wait, so just decided to get the first available seat, outside! It was a bit miserable sitting in the heat, but that's when you get a refreshing drink to cool you down!

As for food, almost everything we got was delicious. They use manchengo cheese for their mac n cheese that I absolutely love, and have not seen it ever used for mac n cheese. Got the sliders which were delicious, but I had to scoop off some of the cheese cuz I can only have so much blue cheese. Patata bravas were some of the best I've had at a tapas place

I'll definitely be checking this place out again for a delicious off the trip restaurant."}
{"text":"Love coming here for a tasty bite that doesn't break the bank like most restaurants on the strip. Be prepared for a hefty selection of tapas options. 

I really like the apple and manchego salad - a nice combination of tart/sweet and salty.

Mac n cheese is a tasty choice as well. Of course, you have to get the bacon wrapped dates. Just don't freak out when you find a hard thing in the middle - it's just a crunchy almond. 

Fries were meh when I went - they weren't freshly fried. 

The best thing about this place is it's open until 1am for those late weekday parties."}
{"text":"Great tapas! The bacon wrapped dates everyone talks about is a MUST! Sounds strange but we ordered a second order after the first was devoured so fast. Everything was exceptional except for the paellas. At roughly $25 a pop we thought it'd be delicious. It was too saucy which made the rich soggy. The seafood paellas mussels and fish were both way over cooked and the chicken and mushroom one was not spectacular. 

Service was great. Go with and group."}
{"text":"This place opened about 6 months ago and it was WONDERFUL.....it went down hill soooo fast....it is BAD.  Even the recipes have changed...portions smaller too...the place is DIRTY and smells bad.  Our wait staff has always been nice except the bartender who is non describably un bartender-ish and makes us feel that we are unwelcome.  They have 3 locations...this one is on Eastern Ave."}
{"text":"The first time I've ever had tapas was here! So ridiculously yummy.

My favorites:
Ham and cheese croquettes
Diablo shrimp
Meat empanada

My not favorites, but still very yummy (in decreasing order of yummyness):
Stuffed mushrooms (too cheesy)
Thai salad
Firefly fries
Stuffed dates (I love bacon, but not when there's something sweet inside...)

Very cute setting. Next time, I need to try some sangria!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here after reading very good reviews about the place. We got fooled by the walking distance in getting to the restaurant from our hotel but thank goodness we persevered because I can't imagine missing this restaurant after our experience. 
We were seated immediately because we chose their outside seating area. There was a 25 min. wait to be seated inside the restaurant. Yes, it is very popular and we saw why. The outside seating was fine because the heating lamps were adequate and kept us warm. It also had a very fun and vibrant atmosphere with some string lights hanging outside and the music they played was great. We were greeted immediately by our very friendly waiter Jesus who recommended so many good non expensive dishes. We really liked that. I read that their sangria is excellent and Jesus told us it is the best. I couldn't agree more. It was very close to the sangria I've had in Madrid. It was so delicious and the alcohol was not weak. We ordered the stuffed dates, crispy duck, sweet and spicy shrimps, artichoke on toasted bread and sirloin skewers with shrimp and chorizo. They were all divine. The service is just absolutely great. Our waiter was very attentive and always checking up on us and a guy named Jaime kept pouring our pitcher of sangria in our glasses. Every staff member we met was friendly and smiled at us. The price is also very reasonable. The bathroom was very clean which is very imporatnt to me. What a gem! I'll definitely come back here."}
{"text":"We were visiting Las Vegas with family and friends to celebrate my wife's birthday last weekend...about 16-18 of us...and was recommended to Firefly by local friends who live in Vegas. The staff really took care of us, the service was excellent, the food was really good,decent portions for tapas style and reasonably priced. Our wait staff even came out with a birthday dessert for my wife and her cousin who was also celebrating her birthday. Would definitely recommend Firefly to anyone who wants to have some good food, a casual restaurant with nice ambiance and an overall good time. Thanks for helping to make my wife's birthday memorable."}
{"text":"We have eaten there a number of times in the past but will never return. Dishes were dirty and a few of the food items were cold including shrimp tempura which I have never had cold. We told the waiter but all he said was ( oh, it's cold ). Never offered to make good on cold items. They also are expensive for the product you and then charge 20 % gratuity for four adults and two children. We will never go back. I can see why the health Dept closed them"}
{"text":"Oooooh my goodness, the bacon wrapped dates!!...The bacon wrapped dates! Oh my goodness!!

This is, hands down, where I had my best meal while in Las Vegas!
We first tried to go on a Thursday evening around 6:30, it was so busy we couldn't get a table. But, after hearing how exceptional Firefly was, we weren't about to give up! So we went back at 5 on Saturday and were able to get a table without waiting. 
We ordered the *bacon wrapped dates*, (after reading amazing reviews mentioning them), the chicken salad and sliders, for my boyfriend. Everything was perfect! The bacon wrapped dates were ~orgasmic~ and the chicken salad was divine! (and I'm pretty picky about chicken salad!)

I would highly recommend this place; the food was exceptional and the service was impeccable-  our waiter could not have been more friendly, fast or attentive. 
My only regret is that I didn't save room for dessert! :)"}
{"text":"One of the best tapas places I've been too and I've eaten tapas in Spain. (Humble brag)

Make sure you make reservations because people started piling in on a Friday night when we went at 6:30. 

Feel free to take a taxi here, there's a greeter/valet team outside who'll help you get one back to your hotel.


The service here is quick and the menu is huge.  
Not only was everything fatty and buttery and delicious but the portions are huge!!!! 

Great value and perfect spot to sit in the patio with girlfriends"}
{"text":"Firefly is the place to go if you're craving delicious small plates and alcohol. The interior is decorated with dark red walls and paintings.

They have a wide variety of items you can choose from, and basic items with a twist. They also serve paella that is made to order, so you have to give them 40 minutes to prepare. 

They start you off with some garlic bread and their house butter. It was sweet, and balanced very well with the savory flavors.

We ordered the firefly fish sticks, and I was pleased with the crispness of the Japanese bread crumbs. The spicy tartar sauce wasn't spicy at all, but it had a slight kick to it. 

The vegetable empanada was delicious. The breading had a wonderful texture; soft, buttery and flakey. 

We also ordered ribs, that were doused in their mango barbecue sauce. The meat just fell off the bone. It was so soft and tender! The mango chunks and the sweetness of the sauce created a beautiful symphony of flavors!

Finally, we finished the meal off with a pan of chicken and mushroom paella. It was filled with flavors, that just made you want to eat more! By this point of the meal, I was already full, but I just couldn't stop eating.

To top it all off, we then ordered a chocolate tres leches, which was also very delicious. Super soft and moist! Tastes even better with the chocolate bits drizzled around the plate!

I had an amazing experience here at firefly. Definitely would like to come back to try their other tapas options. One of those places where you don't regret spending a bit more for some small plates!"}
{"text":"After first dining here several years ago, we were excited to return when we stayed off-the-strip.  It was a busy, hoppin' joint, but we got a nice table right away.  Our server was friendly and efficient.  We had several dishes, which were all so delicious.  The meat was perfectly cooked, the sauces were nice, and the vegetables were fresh.  My only complaint was that it all came out so quickly, I would have rather lingered over small courses.  

We shared a pitcher of sangria, and we sadly could not finish it all, very generous pitcher.  The sangria was stellar, with nice chunks of fruit floating within."}
{"text":"Firefly is awesome! The varied selection of tapas is top-notch, as is the flavor of the many tapas my party and I tried. We ordered about half of the tapas on the menu and we found them all delicious. The sparkling sangria is delicious as well..strong yet fruit at the same time. The butter that accompanies the complimentary bread is, in all honesty, finger-lickin' good and I wish I had the recipe! Oh, and the desserts are just to die for! We ordered the dessert platter which included the caramel flan, chocolate tres leches cake, lemon-berry tarts, and passion fruit cheesecake. To say that these deserts were exquisite would be an understatement! 

The service was great as well, zero complaints there! The only reason I am not giving 5 stars is that the atmosphere was not what one would think one when thinking of a Spanish tapas restaurant. We expected it to be more lively and vivacious but it was more quite and mellow than we had hoped. Still, I highly recommend Firefly!"}
{"text":"it was my second time around and i'm so happy my memory didn't fail my tastebuds. for all you san franciscans, it's a cha cha cha's-like restaurant kicked up some notches. more selection, fantastic sangria and great portions for a excellent price."}
{"text":"The food and drinks here at the Paradise location is terrific!! Every time we go to Vegas, Firefly is part of our agenda. IMO - Tapas or small dishes is the best way to eat and share food. I have seen tasting menus at other restaurants that are twice the price with less variety. The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because they changed the Firefly Fries from shoe-string potatoes to regular french fries. The taste and texture is totally different. and not worthy of 5 stars. Hopefully they will change the fries back."}
{"text":"When friends visit from out of town and we are looking to bring them off the strip for something a little different we often find ourselves headed to Firefly. There is something here for people of nearly all tastes and as others have mentioned all of the Paella variations are excellent. The tapas are small and relatively inexpensive allowing even a smaller group to sample an impressive variety of dishes. Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"We had read that this place was vegan friendly so when our friends suggested we meet there for dinner, we made reservations. So glad we did. They were very busy. No parking available in the back, had to valet which was free. My husband and I like to order different plates and then share them, so the small plates here just fit us perfectly. We had bacon wrapped dates, clams and chorizo, lamb chops, grilled octopus, and mango BBQ ribs. My vegan son had the lentils and veggies and the tomato bread. Everything was hot, tasty, and served just at the right time. The staff was busy but very friendly and provided good service. Dessert was Nutella and banana for hubby and coconut sorbet for our son. The place is very very loud   but it was packed with big parties celebrating birthdays so understandable. The food and service are both high quality. We will go back to this one."}
{"text":"Great restaurant for tapas. Went here for a birthday party and service was impeccable. Will certainly return!"}
{"text":"This is where the locals hang out. The place wasn't crowded and it was off the strip. I know when you go to Vegas you want to go all out and do all the touristy things, but for me... I like to hang out with the locals as well. The food was great and the place has a nice atmosphere. I love tapas style places. Definitely a good place to take a break from all of Vegas glam."}
{"text":"i have mixed feelings about spanish tapas places in general but i did have a really enjoyable meal here. my friend and i each had a sangria, red and white, and both were really good, not too sweet, and shared the following:

tuna tartare, roasted eggplant, spicy beef salad, grilled octopus, lamb chops, and empanadas. everything was really good but a lot of them were on the salty side. my favorites were the octopus, which was super super tender, and the tartare, which is almost always my favorite anywhere it's good. this one could have used more avocado, but that's just a personal preference.

one complaint i have about the place that's not really a complaint is that the portion size is huge - the biggest i've ever seen with tapas. it just made me sad because we had to order everything to try it, but couldn't finish everything. as with any tapas, a bigger group is better. regardless i would have liked to see smaller portions at slightly lower prices, though the prices are still really reasonable.

the service was good and the place was just a normal seeming restaurant atmosphere wise. this is only the second tapas place i had tried in vegas and the other was the fancy one in the aria on the strip. this is way better!"}
{"text":"We had a table for 20 on Friday night - it was a pre-party for our wedding the following day. Daniel was our server, and he was AMAZING! We ordered pitcher after pitcher of sangria and mojito (so yummy!). He was on top of everything the whole time. The seafood paella was the highlight for me - but the table was full of tapas and everyone raved about their food. It was my first time at Firefly. I will be back every time I am in town now. Fabulous evening all around."}
{"text":"I love this place for group outings. It can get kind of loud so if you're looking for a nice, quite restaurant on a Friday night...not here.
The prices are extremely reasonable and the Tapas are really good.  I have been satisfied every time I've gone.....

Get the Sangria. Try the mushroom tart and the mac & cheese.

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Pretty cool date place. Lots of options and finger foods keep the atmosphere fun and relaxed."}
{"text":"I came here with a group of yelpers. Not a UYE or anything, just a super casual dinner. 

We got there right at 4 pm when they opened and Vanessa N. right off the bat says \"it's happy hour from 4-6, we need a pitcher of white and red sangria.\" I just met her, but I knew I liked her already. By the time everyone showed up, I had already gone through 3 glasses of red sangria. 

Anyone who has been to firefly knows that almost everything is yummy. I always order the bacon wrapped stuffed dates. They are sweet and savory all in one. The pork empanadas are flaky and the pork is flavorful and moist. The spicy beef salad was also yummy. Beef was tender and dressing on the salad had a nice heat, nothing too overwhelming. The only bad dish was the tuna tartare. I usually get this dish, but today the tuna was really fishy and old. Lisa G. ordered the same thing and we had to send it back. 

Out waiter was a little flustered when it came to the bill since we all wanted separate checks, but we worked it out. I had an awesome time with everyone (Vanessa, Anthony, Loren, Lisa, River, April and Doug). Sorry there's no initials for last names, but you know who you are. Vanessa and I did have to finish off Loren's white sangria. My thing is, I'd rather waste food than alcohol. So we were not about to let an entire glass of sangria go to waste."}
{"text":"Love this place 

There sangria is to die for  you can't go there and not have sangria it's the best. The infused shots they have are yummy! 

I always get the ceviche and there mac and cheese both are super delicious! Everything there is good don't think I've had anything bad!"}
{"text":"One of our Las Vegas favorites, celebrating our anniversary~dessert on the house.  Thanks to our awesome waiter Nahum"}
{"text":"I am going to be thinking about the meal we had here for awhile and crying because there is not one near my house. Flavors were amazing. We ordered about 12 dishes and all were so good. Food came out fast and staff was great. 

SO FREAKING GOOD!!!"}
{"text":"not usually a big fan of tapas since the plates make me feel like a giant, but this place is the perfect place for both locals and tourists alike. that means it can get really crowded! the food is really good; good bold, flavors and well balanced - not overly salty, spicy or sweet. since it gets crowded, it does affect the service, but our server did good job as did our hostess. and since the restaurant is in an outside shopping center, parking can be an issue. but if you're stick of the buffets and high-end hotel restaurants, this is a solid choice."}
{"text":"Vegas food doesn't impress me too much but this is off the strip and good. One star off for bad/slow service. Another star off since the food is good but it wasn't too memorable. The only thing I can remember (and the reason why we went) was the stuffed dates (get that)."}
{"text":"Thanks to Susan, this was my 1st Spanish Tapas experience and I liked it.

I drove by this local twice before I found it. I expected a bigger neon sign I guess.

It is a quiet locale. There is parking but with the other businesses in this strip mall spaces fill up quick. 

Very crowded, popular and noisy but worth it.
Cannot wait to go back. Gracias."}
{"text":"GREAT SERVICE! GREAT FOOD! The manager Eduardo went above and beyond out of his way to make sure we had a memorable dining experience. He felt a little bad bc there was confusion when we got sat and it took a little bit too long for our server to get to us. Thank you Eduardo for everything I have a new found love for this place."}
{"text":"This place is always impressing me. I went and they were doing an art sale. our servers were so attentive it was fabulous. the food exceptional as always. the chorizo stuffed clams were to die for. of course we ended with the chocolate tres leches . thanks for a great date night."}
{"text":"I dare you to name something that IS NOT good here!!!
Ok, maybe the paella isn't in par with Miami, but still darned good!!"}
{"text":"I have been to numerous restaurants in Las Vegas, but Firefly is my favorite. It is off the strip, but very close, so well worth the trip.

First, you should order the sangria. Delicious! The menu is primarily made up of small plates, or tapas. There is a large variety of selections, from salads, to chicken and steak, to seafood. Most are prices from $6 to 11 each. We have been there numerous times, so we've had many of their offerings, which are consistently excellent.

In our most recent trip, we were served by Alejandro and his assistant, Roberto. Both were personable and attentive. They made great recommendations, which helped us, even though we have been several times before.

We started with the plate of serrano ham and manchego cheese. Served with bread and sun dried tomatoes, it was a great start.

We followed this up with the pardon peppers and pork empanadas. Both were great. The pork empanadas were cooked perfectly and tasted terrific.

We followed these with an order of the Tierra y Mar skewers (skewers of shrimp, beef and chorizo) and another order or sangria! When we asked Roberto about his favorite dish, he suggested an order of the camarones a la diabla, so we ordered that, too. Both dishes were outstanding!

Without saying much, the second pitcher of sangria was better than the first.

All in all, another outstanding experience at Firefly. If you go to Las Vegas, this off the strip gem is not to be missed!"}
{"text":"Thanks to the help of the yelpers Firefly became my choice for my wedding dinner/reception.  I heard from locals the food was great and a fair price.  I wanted my guest to feel as if we spared no expense in them. Tiffany understood my needs and helped shape my vision for the night.

When I arrived earlier in the day to drop of decorations Andrea was sweet and very helpful. I left the decorating up to her and she made me very happy. All my guest commented on how festive and nice the decor looked. The private dinning room was perfect and left a romantic feel in the air.

I am a foodie, so I will try anything once. I was a bit nervous that some friends and family may not like some of the dinner choices.  But to our surprise everyone was happy even the kids with the food.  I appreciated that they brought out a few mac and cheese for them and sorbet for my nieces that are lactose intolerant. Shane our server was all over it. He tended to the groom and I perfectly.  His assistant helped keep drinks filled and food coming out for our guest. We have some hefty eaters and even they came out stuffed.

My thanks to Regina the manager who was very accomodating and nice dealing with some unexpected party crashers. LOL! A big hug of happiness and thanks to all the staff that made this evening perfect on our wedding day, Tiffany, Andrea, Regina, Shane, the cooks, and anyone else I may have forgotten."}
{"text":"Good variety of tapas, service can be slow to nonexisting when its crowded, which is often the case at lunch time. Get there early!"}
{"text":"This was good, not over the top amazing tho. The good stuff was great but other things were good (borderline ok). Nothing was bad but service was friendly but sometimes hard to find. They seem to rely heavy on spice too. I will go here again for sure, great break from the strip stuff."}
{"text":"Firefly is the type of place that fills my heart with warm fuzzies when I think about it. Each time I've visited Vegas, I've dined here, and it has always -- always -- been worth it.

On my most recent visit, we made a reservation through Open Table, which worked out perfectly.  Even on a Tuesday evening, the place was hopping.  We were seated immediately and attended to by friendly staff.  We split the red sangria and ordered an assortment of small plates, including the following: Firefly fries, mushroom tart, manchego mac 'n' cheese, fried calamari, and lamb chops.  Per usual, everything was fantastic, especially the mushroom tart.

We rounded out our meal with caramel flan and banana-Nutella sandwiches. If you try nothing else here, order. the. banana. nutella. sandwiches. So perfect. And entirely worth it.

Overall, I would sing Firefly's praises to the highest heavens.  If you're in Vegas, make sure to include it on your must-see list."}
{"text":"At this place the food is tasty. You can tell they really pay attention to detail. They prepare their  food with love. This place is always busy no matter what nite, I recommend you make reservations. All the sangria's are good and they will give you a good buzz. You gotta try the stuffed dates, garlic shrimp, and my fav the steak and mushroom skewers."}
{"text":"Wow, just super good. I got the Diablo shrimp, potatoes (papatas), mixed salad with dried cherries and mandarin oranges. One point! Service is really great as well, constant water refills and great guidance through the menu."}
{"text":"First time here. Was hungry as hell and didn't know what to order. But our server Rojelio made AWESOME suggestions. We left it up to him to bring out what we had. He had a great helper Jazzey who made sure our plates were taken once done. Waters were refilled really quickly. This is what we had...
Mango ribs... tender. Sauce was over powering
Bacon wrapped dates...delish 
Tuna tartar... my favorite
Ceviche... good amount of lemon and came with these hand fried tortillas
Mac and cheese... ehhhh
Marinara sauce and a glop of cheese in the middle. BOMB with the bread
Surf and turf skewers. Tender. Was excellent combo with the steak shrimp and sausage.
Filet mignon on a bed of spinach and fried onions soooooooo tender
We had a few more thing but we were starving from being out on the strip. Overall. This would defiantly be a place to visit again. 6 people. $150. A crap load of dishes. Awesome service. Quickly served. Food was prompt and hot. Thank you for a great meal. Sorry no pics... like I said. We were starving:)"}
{"text":"A hidden gem in Vegas!  The service is impeccable and the portions are right on for tapas.  The tuna tartare is a favorite of mine.  The sangria is a definite hit.  You see it on almost every table.  I highly recommend Firefly* on your next trip."}
{"text":"Great food!  Bacon wrapped Dates live up to their reviews as well as manchego Mac and cheese. Awesome!  We also had the Diablo shrimp, mushrooms and steak. They were also very good. The server was perfect as well. Kind, helpful, but not overbearing."}
{"text":"Tapa style but MEGA portions. Left very full and satisfied but some of the food was just MEH. Ordered smoked salmon bagels, manchego mac n cheese, spicy beef salad, stuffed dates, firefly fries, mushroom tart, tierra y mar skewers, shrimp tempura, chicago beef bocadillos, and lamb chops. Salmon bagels, fries, and stuffed dates were really good. The rest was overcooked or bland but at least we were full..."}
{"text":"Just when I think I have game....

Girl: Yeah!  It's my birthday!!!

Archie: Nice, where you from?

Girl: Colorado.

Archie: Awesome, so how old are you tonight?

Girl: Guess!

Archie: Ok, (better guess young so I don't offend) I am thinking 25??

Girl: *GASP*  NO!!  I am 21!!

Archie: Oops.

She could do with using more sunblock on a daily basis.

Anyways...this is actually my second time to Firefly.  

Both times have been good.  It's well off the strip but always seems to attract a large & loud crowd.

Recommend the mac & cheese, the ceviche, and the pork ribs.

SPF."}
{"text":"I wanted so badly to like this restaurant. It's one of those places I've been hearing about for years, but never actually got around to visiting. My boyfriend owed me dinner, so I asked him to take me here last night. Not one of the tapas I had wowed me. For the price, the portions are exceptionally small. Three mini stuffed peppers for $9. A single cup of soup for $7. We left with a bill of over $80 (two drinks included), and I was still hungry. I would have ordered another tapa to fill me up, except nothing I had thus far was all that good, so I didn't want to waste even more money on substandard food. Most of the food we had was too salty, aside from one tapa that didn't have much flavor or seasoning at all. 

At least the staff was friendly."}
{"text":"I normally do not use phrases like \"it's the bomb!\" or \"off the hook\" unless I'm talking about an actual bomb or an article of clothing that has fallen to the floor, respectively, but this place was both. 

The best way to go at any tapas place is to order 5-6 dishes and share. You can always order more if you're hungry. If my wine-soaked brain recalls correctly, we had: eggplant cannoli (the name escapes me, but the dish is rolled eggplant and goat chees); fries; pulpo asado (octopus), chicken salad, and the veggies and lentils (probably my favorite). We also split a tres leches cake, but that was pretty forgettable. 

If you go to Vegas, you really need to go here. It's a hip place with a good vibe and interesting people."}
{"text":"It's happy hour from 3-6 Monday thru Friday. Pitcher of watermelon mojitos for the low low. Today's line up mac and cheese always solid. Tierra Mar skewers slamming. Steak and mushrooms skewers save the sauce to dip the bread in. Almond butter nuff said. Bacon wrapped dates. Berry tarts for desert. Forgot the mango ribs they were thick and proper."}
{"text":"food is 3.5 stars. special drinks are so-so,,, not so special. however the price is very reasonable - so, i give 4 stars. 

atmosphere,,, really loud - music and these people talking too loud. 

what is the matter with these restaurants with dim lighting??? do they think it is sexy or something? wrong! 

for these reasons, i like to visit here for lunch when it is not too loud, not too dark,,, having lunch with wine at the patio right now (October) is just perfect!"}
{"text":"Firefly is supurb.
Excellent atmosphere with the soft red lighting and a great painting on the back wall - loved it.
Excellent service, very attentive waiters.
Had to try the red sangria drenched with fruit to go along with the bread and olive plate - very, very nice.
I ordered the meatballs, the stuffed red peppers with manchengo cheese and the ham croquettas. A very satisfying meal
I love Tapas.
I got to savor Tapas in Madrid, going to the \"avenue of Tapas\" after viewing a bullfight in the Plaza de Toros. It was such a great experience - walking into the bar - picking up a plate - selecting the pieces of food you wanted as you walked along the counter and then showing it to the cashier at the end and paying what ever they thought was correct. Enjoying the food with a cold drink.
I was not sure that experience could be duplicated - but Firefly sure gives it outstanding effort.
There are so many tempting items on the menu that it makes you want to return for sure. 
I have already staked out the Filet skewers with mushroom and the Filet sliders for the next visit.
Oh yea - the shots of berry infused Vodka don't hurt your enjoyment one bit."}
{"text":"Oh Fireflys, despite of the heat this place has been getting I've always loved this place. But, now the quality of the food has    deteriorated as well as their customer base. Now I know the whole salmonella thing happened to the paradise location. You would think Fireflys would learn from it but than I hear the Eastern location closed down. The eastern location was the fanciest one! The building structure was ridiculous (the good kind). Than that leaves the Sahara location. People might thing I'm crazy to eat here again but I do enjoy their food until now. 

Friday nights are always usually super busy. We came in and it was pretty dead. Ordered the usuals that we usually get-- 

spicy beef salad (my fav)-- still taste amazing. Warm salads are always my fav. Add ginger in it for the kick & it's delicious. 

Empanadas- really dry. The salad that comes with it had a sour dressing with it that didn't taste too familiar. 

Ceviche- oh how this dish had change. Less less less. I remember they would bring a bowl with hella chips. Now it's 6 chips with palm full of ceviche. One of the worse ceviches I ever had. 

Albondigas- the meatballs are smaller now. Tasted pretty good still but something was missing. I don't know what it is. 

Cocktails & sangria -- pretty much the same no changes there. 

I used to be in love with this restaurant but I guess all good things must come to an end.. ¯\_(?)_/¯ Oh and if anyone's wondering.. I didn't get sick."}
{"text":"WOW!

I was completely blown away by this place.  My friend from Vegas lives and dies by this place, and I now know why!

Upon our arrival into Las Vegas, my friend immediately decided that this is where we would be eating for dinner.  After a quick shower and some down time, we finally met back up with my friend and hailed a cab to Firefly.

Miami needs a Firefly!  What a great ambiance.  When we first arrived, they were a bit crowded and we sat at the bar to have a couple of drinks and await our table.  Not too long after, we were seated in a seperate area that was originally the restuarant next door.  Great atmosphere and loved the decoration.  Low lighting, lots of use of the color red.  Totally my vibe!  :)

I was advised that EVERYTHING on the menu is absolutely delicious, and that I MUST try the croquetas and empanadas.  Alrighty then, I said.  Here we go!  Oh, and the Sangria is a must-try too!

Between 3 of us we had:

*the Ham & Cheese Croquetas - OMG, delish!  Soooo tasty with the addition of the cheese!  A new fave.

*the Empanadas (with Pork) - very tasty and cooked to perfection, with the crispiest, flakiest dough that melts in your mouth.

*the Crispy Duck rolls - these were good, but not my fave.  A little gamey for my taste, and I usually really like duck, but the crispyness was good and I enjoyed the cherry sauce drizzled over...

*Petite Filet - hands down my FAVE dish of the night.  The filet was cooked to perfection, and the mushrooms were just melt-in-your-mouth good!  The roasted potatoes that were also mixed in, along with the red wine sauce, were just PERFECTION.  :)

*Manchego Mac&Cheese - what an awesome twist on a traditional dish!  I must learn to make this at home.

*Tuna Tartare - WOW!  I've never had such delicious tuna.  It was not served as traditional thin slices, but in small diced pieces with a delicious sauce (not sure what the sauce was) drizzled over it, served on a bed of edamame and enoki salad with taro chips.  I would use the chip to pile on everything else on top of it and then eat this crunch concoction!  SOOOO GOOD!

For dessert we all shared the Banana-Nutella sandwiches, which were ORGASMICLY divine!  My new favorite dessert!  SOOOO tasty.

I give this place 5+++++ Stars!  I wish I would have had the chance to return while on my trip, but alas it was too short.  I will DEFINITELY be back here the next time I am in Vegas to try the rest of the items on the menu!"}
{"text":"My friend who is an ex-resident of Vegas recommended that I stop by Firefly and try their delicious tapas. The selection of tapas makes decision making for the indecisive quite difficult. Though, almost instinctively, the bacon wrapped stuffed dates caught my eye...like I have bacon radar or something. And yes, they are as yummy as my fellow yelpers have indicated. The best part, aside from the obviously delicious little crispy ruffled pork jacket gently caressing the date, was the surprise bit of almond thoughtfully placed inside date adding in the perfect crunch, texture, and flavor. We also tried the mac n cheese, which was quite rich and filling; the filet sliders, perfectly cooks little burgers with cheese and fried onions; the veggies and lentils, which were surprisingly flavorful, and the best of all, the crispy duck rolls. The duck rolls with hoisin sauce were so crispy and tender, I wanted to order two more helpings. All in all, we ordered five plates and felt pretty full afterwards. And, the bill was really reasonable. It was pretty refreshing to dine off the strip, eat a really delicious meal, and not feel like your wallet just got hijacked. We will definitely be back on our next visit."}
{"text":"I've been hearing about Firefly for 2 years now from a co worker and I finally get to try it.

The food was awesome.  We ordered the bacon wrapped dates, lamb skewers, mussels with red curry, smoked salmon toasts, french fries, mac and cheese, and the tres leches chocolate cake.

My favorite were the dates and the chocolate cake. I want to try the paella next time.

We came in around late lunch me, the hubby and kiddies.  It wasn't very crowded  yet so we were able to sit at the lounge area with the comfy sofas and tables.

We will definitely go back again =)"}
{"text":"Came here for my bachelorette party and just had to return with my fiancé...I mean husband. Lol. We just got married last night and over 24 hours later we finally come out of our hotel to have a romantic newlywed dinner."}
{"text":"We were in Las Vegas for a week. And our first day we ordered Uber food in this place and it was absolutely delicious. So two days later we had to come back, but we wanted to eat in the restaurant. We had an amazing time. The food was delicious, service was amazing. So I can say that from 6 days that we were in Las Vegas we came 4 times for dinner. That means a lot."}
{"text":"3rd visit and still amazing!  Ordered almost the entire menu and loves everything.  Lamb meatballs and stuffed dates are off the charts."}
{"text":"I really do love this place. And if I had reviewed them a few years ago, they'd have definitely gotten 5 stars, but I think I've gotten pickier now. 

It's a great place for a group, so you can try more tapas. Pitchers of sangria always make the mood more festive. They've got an excellent patio for beautiful afternoons or evenings (afternoons are more peaceful- this place gets BUSY at night). And their bacon wrapped dates and potatas bravas are some of my favorites. 

It does get loud when it's busy, so a tough place to catch up with old friends. And service can be hit or miss. And really, I've easily had better sangria and mojitos... But you're going for the atmosphere, bc this restaurant doesn't feel like it's in Vegas...  and the dates and potatas of course :)"}
{"text":"The bar at Firefly on Paradise is a great comfortable place for the single business traveler.  The bartenders are friendly (and cute), and they keep my sangria glass full.  The tapas makes a wonderful way to try a few different things when eating alone.  

I found the dates a little sweet and greasy after the much lighter tuna tartare, but I think that was just a pairing snafu. I loved the tomato soup and grilled brie sandwich.

I took my colleagues to lunch at Firefly on Sahara - it just didn't have the same vibe.  Maybe it's because we passed on the Sangria - but the tapas just didn't seem to taste as good there for some reason.

I will be going back -"}
{"text":"Tasty food and very good service! The food  portions are small and expensive. Love the waiters. They're very attentive. I love when they give you a pot of fresh coffee!  The lamb chops and the dates wrapped in bacon are the best! Great last before heading back to SD!"}

Wow 
Customer service it's amazing
The stuff they're so nice
the Hottmosphir so good 
And the design something else
I love it love it love it"}
{"text":"We came back this weekend... had the artichoke toasts, they were very good.  Also had the chocolate tres leches... nothing to write home about, get the flan!"}
{"text":"i like this new location a lot, it's more local to the strip, spacious, and trendy/intimate than the Westside location that they moved from. they have an outside patio seating area, or you can sit at the huge bar in the middle, or at one of the half-moon booths or tables.

there's a strongly Spanish and seductive vibe which i'm definitely diggin' - the intimate lighting, red tones, spanish dancers and bullfighter paintings adorning the walls, the uniquely patterned wallpaper, i love it all. 

definitely a place you want to bring someone special or a Ladyfriend you're trying to impress. good times will be had over their tapas, calamari, sliders, octopus (my favorite), bacon-wrapped dates, etc. the cocktails are on point as well.

-salud!"}
{"text":"So good!  So many choices!  The wait staff was friendly & efficient.   The kitchen was so prompt getting tapas to our table!  We were with 2 friends and tried 8 or 9 different dishes - and enjoyed them all.  Also had wonderful mojitos that they prepare by the pitcher full !"}
{"text":"I've been here several times before, and the food is superb. However today, we were told it would be a 30 minute wait for inside or we could sit outside immediately. We opted for an outside table and after 15 minutes had not been offered water or anything to drink. The waiter came out several times to check on other tables and even after we ask someone to send a waiter to us, and he checked on the other tables again and left. We walked out."}
{"text":"Tapas, the Spanish equivalent to Chinese dim sum. I've always thought, why pay for such small plates, when you can get bigger portions of one dish somewhere else? Quantity (portion wise) and hopefully of course with quality over quantity (plate wise) any day! Once again, Yelp sure has a way of making me switch my archaic way of thinking when it comes to my food adventures. 

Seeing plenty of good to very good reviews of this place, why not try something off the strip, off from the hustle and bustle and overpriced, mediocre, touristy spots for food? My entire concept of joining Yelp was to find and experience new culinary places that I have yet to sink my salivating teeth into.

The atmosphere is trendy, yet comforting, almost like you're at a family members house who keeps up with the times in regards to decor and other furnishings (like the fish tank above the door way into the main dining room area - just look up). 

You are greeted with complimentary bread, cheese type spread, and green olives to get your appetite going.  I can honestly say Firefly is one of the places I actually wanted to try every-single-item on the menu, but alas my gut, or wallet will not like me later. Here's the gauntlet of food we ordered:

Roasted Eggplant Cannelloni, stuffed with goat cheese and drizzled with tomato sauce - the cheese had a nice, sassy funk to it, but nothing that only an \"educated\" palate would like and the tomato sauce was paired to it just right by adding that acidity to it

Tuna Tartar mixed with mangoes, avocados, with taro chips to scoop the loving ingredient onto - tuna was seasoned perfectly, no fishy taste at all, the flesh was perfect, coupled with the taro chips to give it a difference in texture

Manchego Man N' Cheese, baby shell pasta baked with manchego cheese - a nice little sharpness to the cheese, but nothing overbearing

Empanadas, pastry shells stuffed with roasted pork, red bell peppers, served with a little greenery and aioli sauce - really good, flaky like crust on the shells, seasoned pork, and the aioli flavors worked well

Filet Mignon Sliders, with sliced serrano ham, cabrales cheese, and caramelized onions - really good, moist burgers with the combo of the ham and cheese, we really loved this one (we ordered two)

Crispy Duck Rolls, served with a cherry hoisin sauce - really crisp, duck was a little dry, but paired with the sauce, gives it a better overall taste/texture

Firefly Fish Sticks, were filets of grouper, nicely coated with Japanese panko bread crumbs and served with a spicy tartar sauce - I really like this considering they were fillets (not sticks) and that sauce was just awesome

Baked tetilla, roasted tomato and tetilla cheese fondue with chorizo, toasts - melted cheese + roasted tomato + chorizo = mouthgasm times 10

Chorizo Clams, served with peppers, two kinds of spicy sausage, white wine, and Parmesan toasts  - Oh, my, goodness!! Who knew that this would be amazingly good as it was. The refreshing shellfish, coupled with the sausages, white wine, and using the toasts to scoop up all the yummy goodness, please, game over.

We also had the stuffed mushrooms (I believe with Chorizo), and those were quite outstanding as well. It wasn't, ho-hum, stuffed mushrooms, it was more like, wow, these things are the definition of what a good stuffed mushroom should be like. 

Most of the dishes had 2-3 servings a plate, but with 4 hungry people (3 being Yelpers), after tax + tip + drinks (no alcohol) it was around $120. That's almost impossible for the quality and quantity (also the fact we were all STUFFED) to get away with in a nice restaurant in L.A. So, if you've never been and haven't tried tapas yet, this would be a great way to start it off. I hope you end up being a fan of not only tapas, but of Firefly. This will be a spot I will visit when ever I'm in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Where else can you get stuffed dates? The menu is eclectic and promises to surprise the adventurous with a drink menu to match. Amazing romantic ambiance but it's loud. Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Great little Tapas bar just off the strip!   

Out in Vegas for convention and to escape ACL in Austin lol.

Used Yelp to find this place and not disappointed.   Great cozy atmosphere buzzing with life. Dark, with a great pulse, and original art on the wall.   My kind of place.  Table wait was about 45 minutes on a Wednesday but found a spot at the bar in 10 minutes.  Bar tenders were very attentive even whilst making gallons of fresh Sangria. Yum.  Have me two of those please!  Perfect!   Off to a great start so far.

Ordered the beacon wrapped dates for starters, very tasty.  Then moved on to a Petit Felit, and Tuna Tart tart.   All good.  In between I through in a perfectly on-point mojito and finished off with some gelato.   

All and all a very solid and a fun experience.  Compliments again to the bartenders for great service.  Always nice to find an authentic little spot off strip in Vegas.   Without Yelp I might have missed this one, you shouldn't."}
{"text":"I cannot thank them enough for the wonderful food and service!  I came here for the first time for my boyfriend's birthday and we both enjoyed the scene and the food.  I would say it was definitely worth the trip from L.A. to Vegas just to experience this.  The staff was very accommodating and focused even down to the parking lot attendant for the parking structure.  In case you don't know, when you park in the plaza there is a charge, but you can take the parking stub and validate them at the cashier.  

They even included a complimentary flan dessert just for my boyfriend's birthday which was a nice surprise.  

I would highly recommend this to anyone visiting Vegas!"}
{"text":"Oh my GOD the dates!!! OH MY GOD THE DATES!!! If you see your mama slap her! OH MY GOD THE DATES!!!! The stuffed bacon wrapped dates are that good!!!! We came across the place by accident on our trip to Vegas. We were driving by & notice this place. We decided to Yelp to view reviews based on the reviews we decided to give s try. Best decision ever! Our server Gabriel was excellent. He recommended the strawberry mojito a definite must!  Service was superb! If you're in Vegas you must stop in."}
{"text":"Oh, FireFly. How i love thee, let me count the ways! 
Every time I decide to try a new restaurant in town, I almost immediately regret not going to my faithful FireFly. 

I've been a regular for about a year now, and I'm never disappointed. I love the tapas style. Tapas meaning small plate, If you didn't already know that. It's great to share a few plates with a friend or scarf a few down all to yourself. 

I'm a vegetarian but I have no problem with options here! 
Some of my favorite plates include;
-Apple and manchego salad- scrumptious and light 
-Artichoke toasts- a delicious little snack 
-Veggie Empanada- Pretty filling 
-Warm spinach salad- healthy and yummy 
And of course the Manchego Mac and Cheese if you can afford the calories!  

Not to mention the pistachio gelato! To freakin die for. 

As for drinks, the sangria's, both red and white are delicious. 
My personal faves are \"The new girl\" a red vodka drink infused with a hint of jalapeño! Yum! 
And the \"cherry mule\" a Moscow mule with cherry flavored  grey goose! 

Ok, but MOST IMPORTANTLY.... The servers and bartenders. 
Athena, Omar and Eduardo are so sweet and they always take such good care of me! 
I love it when I walk in and they greet me like a friend, and then ask, \"your usual?\" Maybe it's because I come here too often, or maybe it's because they're great at serving their loyal customers! 
Either way, I'll keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Fantastic place for tapas. I love almost every dish they serve. Their bacon wrapped dates are a must try as well as their samosas. The ambiance is really nice too with plenty of heat if you sit outside at night."}
{"text":"Excellent Tapas, service was awesome and the atmosphere was great.  We had only eight of the many available Tapas and everyone of them were flavorful and cooked perfectly.  

I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone who enjoys great Tapas and at a very affordable price.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"This place is the bomb.   This is the best food to money ratio in Vegas.  I can't recommend it more highly.   In a town with high end food for expense accounts and high rollers this is the real deal for real people.  Excellently prepared food, a great staff,  flipping off the chain flavors!   I'd stay an extra day to eat here again!   Damn!    Get the Bacon Wrapped Dates!"}
{"text":"Firefly has the coolest dome in part of the restaurant that looks out onto Freemont Street. You can see pretty much the whole thing, and while inside you can also watch the giant TV canopy thing if it's time for the show.

Misti Y took me here for dinner on my last night in town and I really enjoyed it. They serve up tapas style foods so we got a ton of small plates to share including the manchego mac and cheese, artichokes hearts on little toasts, lentils and veggies, bacon wrapped dates, and spicy shrimp. All of it was pretty good, but my favorite actually turned out to be the artichoke hearts. I know, I know! Who would have thought compared to manchego macaroni and bacon wrapped anything, artichoke hearts would win, but they did and they were damn good.

Firefly also has a pretty decent drink menu including a sparkling sangria cocktail that I ordered. Yes, it's sangria made with sparkling wine. It was chock full of fruit, too and fairly sweet so it you don't like sweet drinks you may want to try something else."}
{"text":"The food is great. The atmosphere was extremely loud.I guess it was my own fault as this was the first place we went to after we arrived in Vegas.I was tired and looking for good food with some atmosphere. Well the food delivered  but the glass dome the restaurant is in is LOUD. I mean it was hard to hear the server. This was on a Thursday night @ 9:00. Locals at the hotel suggest the location by the Hard Rock. Price was not bad but, if you are downtown,the taxi fair will eat up any savings. One nice advantage is you can see  Fremont Street from the restaurant."}
{"text":"Never Again!

This was a place that we made a point of going to every time we were in Vegas, as we've always enjoyed their tapas and blood orange mojitos.  Then we ate there on 4/23/12 and were among the 200+ people impacted by salmonella poisoning due to the fact that these morons don't know how to store food, prep food and wash their hands (see the 5 page, 44 point violation report filed by the Southern Nevada Health District).

As to the other reviewers saying that it is closed for renovations, they are misinformed.  This place was not closed for \"renovations\".  It was closed for making over 200 people violently ill.  If they do reopen (and I seriously hope they don't), avoid this place at all costs.  The violations show a complete lack of control from management and this place does not deserve your business.  There are way too many great places to eat in Vegas that actually know how to properly store meat.

Thanks for the week of vomiting, dehydration and pissing out of my a** Firefly!"}
{"text":"I was in Vegas for a conference and handsome and I enjoy trying new places that they don't have in LA. We pulled up Yelp and noted all the great reviews for this place and decided to try it out.

Here's what I thought:

 - Service was good
 - garlic bread was tough 
 - almond butter was ok
 - Bacon wrapped dates not bad, but not great
 - shrimp with garlic was ok
 - ceviche was fare
 - chicken, chorizo and cheese stuffed mushrooms was good until it got cold
 - sardines were average
 - prosciutto and cheese plate was meh
 - wine list was weak and had no dates
 - the lobster \"escargot\" was TERRIBLE! Glad the server took it off our bill.

As you can see, we did not particularly enjoy our experience at Firefly. Sorry guys..."}
{"text":"Been here several times and never had a bad meal. Friendly, quick service. Great atmosphere. Decent prices. I love Firefly.

Update:

I've been here many times now. Everyone I take here loves it. Every meal I get is great. The only issue is that it is PACKED on a Friday night. It's awesome."}
{"text":"I love Tapas. Many gluten free options, and a fantastic wine list! They even had The Prisoner by the bottle. Nice restaurant with an outdoor covered patio too."}
{"text":"It's about time that I review this place!  Fire Fly has been one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas for years. I discovered this restaurant when I was craving tapas after my semester abroad in Spain. Everything that I have ordered off the menu has been delicious, from the baked tetilla (anyone who speaks Spanish knows it's a funny name) to the paella. We spend the last NYE here and ordered the AYCE special so we have ordered almost everything! Today we went here for brunch and we were also impressed! I loved the idea of the breakfast tapas! Order the lemon ricotta pancakes!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner very recently, and really enjoyed it.  Made sure to come on a weekday night, with a reservation, so it wouldn't be too busy and my chances would be better of getting a good table in the dome overlooking the Fremont Street Experience (and we did get a great table with a view - a great part of the dining experience).  One past effort to come without a reservation on a Saturday night led to a 1 hour wait, which was too long for us (we went to Tinoco's), so reservations are a good idea.

In general, service was friendly and very reasonable based on how budy they were, and the food was quite good and varied.  I was introduced to tapas style dining in Washington DC at Jaleo, and Firefly follows the model very well - many small plates of different ingredients and preparation, reasonably priced to encouraged variety and sharing.  Red Sangria was very good if a bit on the sweet side.  We ordered the spinach salad, merquez, firefly fries, albondigas, tetilla, clams with chorizo and banana nutella sandwichs.  All were good, the clams were probably the standout in my mind.  I thought the tapas at Cafe Ba Ba Reeba were the best in Vegas (and atmosphere was great there two, although I think Firefly Downtown is superior over all for atmosphere, but alas, Ba Ba Reeba is gone, and Firefly Downtown is among the best if not the best option here as of the writing of this review.

A very good option downtown, and the type of dining is very well suited to the glass dome space - lots of drinking, nibbling of different things, robust conversation, etc.... suit the environment well."}
{"text":"Always an excellent evening as anticipated.  I took friends here that came in town.  They wanted a different type of dining experience.   They too became instant fans."}
{"text":"This place was outstanding.  Went here while visiting a friend in Vegas.  We ordered a pitcher of white sangria during happy hour.  Im not a huge fan of sangria, but this stuff was perfect.  Very refreshing.  For an appetizer, i had the Tuna Tartare.  Perfectly done with avacado and taro chips.  My mouth is watering now just thinking about it.  next, I ordered the lobster escargot.  Its like clam casino but with lobster.  The portion was huge for $10.   Then i had the TIERRA Y MAR SKEWERS°[grilled shrimp, filet mignon, chorizo sausage, salsa verde]  This was OUTSTANDING.  The flavors of the meat with the salsa verde to die for. 
If there was a FireFly where I live, I would be there often.  

OH  and i almost forgot...  Get the Flan for desert!!!  Its so smooth, not chunky.  EXCELLENTE!"}
{"text":"Firefly had a pretty diverse menu, with some traditional favorites and some more trendy picks.  Five dishes was about the right number for the two of us, who were hungry but not starving.  We each had a glass of wine and an after dinner digestif, and ended up at about $80. The atmosphere is casual, and portions are ample.
Mussels: Very tasty in a coconut curry broth, served with bread to soak up the goodness
Tuna Peppers: probably the lowlight. We're big fans of peppadews, but they were pretty much just stuffed with canned tuna, drizzled with oil, and plated. Disappointing.
Lamb Chops: cooked perfectly, interesting side with lentils and veggies
Stuffed Dates: YUM! Everything they should be.
Pulpo Asado: very tender octopus, pretty flavorful
We ordered the sliders, and they showed up on the bill, but never came out. We were already getting full by the time we noticed, and the server was apologetic and gracious about taking it off the bill."}
{"text":"Totally stumbled upon this place by accident...And what a fortunate accident it was. The watermelon mojito was refreshing as it was delicious. I was torn on what to order but our server helped with narrowing down the decisions. Pear &-best salad, chorizo plate, and the mushroom pastry were more than enough to satisfy. 

The location is close enough to the strip to make it an easy enough venture but far enough away from all the noise and hustle n bustle. Loved the outside patio seating that provided plenty of shade and cooling fans with mist. 

I definitely need to come back again...with more friends and a bigger appetite. The dessert menu is calling my name!!"}
{"text":"Good for a tasty bite or a quick dinner date before dancing or a show.  The choices are nominal and they do seem to try to make everything up scale at an affordable price.  There have been a tish or two about the service and food safety standards at the previous location.  This is a much nicer roomier spot.  Honestly I haven't had any issues with the food ever.  I like it as a less formal dining option, decent food.  Service at this location is much better than the westside location.  Probably why that location is closing..  Sangria or flavored Mojito in a carafe pitcher is the way to go.  

I recommend: 

firefly fries
duck roll 
petite filet 
stuffed dates
tuna tartare
tierra y mar
camarones al ajillo
lamb chops
scallops \"escargot\"

Not too fancy, not shabby at all."}
{"text":"Oh man, I loved the Paella, oh god!  So many yummy flavors, good god!
And these little cheesy curd like things, scrumptious!

This is one of the cooler, tastiest Tapas bar I've been too :)"}
{"text":"The only disappointment here, was that with a group of 25 people, we had to have a stuck menu.  They brought out bread and almond butter and green olives as we first sat down.  & some very strong Sangria! We had a set menu that continued to come out. First was the Artichoke Toast, then bacon covered dates, patatas, steak & mushrooms, meatballs,  & smoked salmon.  Everything was phenomenal! My favorite part was the cappucino and dessert.  Chocolate tres leche!!! HOLY AMAZING!!!  Highly recommend this restaurant & I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Another review update for Firefly and another perfect 10, or 5 in our yelp world.  I know that most of my hardcore friends here on yelp have some mixed reviews which is totally understandable.  However, I through different situations at these guys/gals and they always seem to pull through.  17.... Yes, 17 people at 8:00 for a birthday dinner! Guess what, we arrived at 7:55 and were seated at 8.  

The service was some of the best I've ever seen.  I've been to this location numerous times and they were packed and just flying around the restaurant taking care of their patrons.  The food was all fantastic and the drinks matched perfectly.  For the money, its one of my favorite places to go and to take others along with me.  I cannot wait for a yelp event to take place at one of their locations."}
{"text":"AH-Mazing!! 

Great food, great drinks. We've been here about four times. Sometimes there's a wait but that's because it's sooooo good!!"}
{"text":"I got introduced to firefly from my brother who is a VIP host in vegas. Never disappointed when i come here and i eat here everytime im in vegas. If you plan to have a big group i recommend making reservations because it does get packed or try to go for an early dinner to beat the crowds that eat here before hitting up the clubs. everyone i have brought to this restaurant also enjoys it as well. i LOVE this place."}
{"text":"This was my first time back to Firefly since they moved down the street. I have to say I love the change! The restaurant is bigger, more open and it looked like they had separate dining rooms for larger parties.
It was super unfortunate what happened a few years ago with the food poisoning but don't let that change your mind about dining here. The food is still amazing but their prices did go up a few dollars per item.
This trendy restaurant has always been my favorite Spanish tapas go-to. The flavors never disappoint! I love their tuna tartare and artichoke toasts but tonight I tried some new dishes. The smoked salmon bagels and scallops were a great pick! Larger than expected and a flavor explosion in my mouth!
The only reason I can't give 5* is because the service is still amiss. Our server was friendly but he did forget to put in half my order. When the food runners dropped off food, they literally drop it and run away, instead of taking pride in the dish and announcing what it is. Our drinks were also always empty. I would understand if it was a Friday night with a 45 minute wait, but we came in on a Monday night around 9pm.  I watched bussers look at our empty glasses as they walked by, and servers huddled in groups on the floor."}
{"text":"Truly, I'm a fan of Firefly on Paradise but, the Main Street location is just ok...for the comparison to be explained below...

AMBIANCE
Dark reds, contemporary, loungey.  Unlike it's sister restaurant, this establishment isn't \"stuffy\" because it boasts tall ceilings and a lot space between tables; therefore, no bumping into the tables next to yours!  Cleanliness-wise, this restaurant looked so clean, I might've demonstrated the \"5 second rule\", though luckily my eating skills were top-notch last night.  This location is located in The Plaza Casino on the second floor.  It has a wonderful view of the Fremont Experience.

MENU
I think it was exactly the same, including the reasonable prices!  For the non-Firefly frequenter...  The menu is made up of mostly all tapas (small plates/portions) which include hot, cold, meat/poultry, and seafood tapas.  Some of my absolute fav's are the:
Bacon wrapped stuffed dates
Manchego mac & cheese
Stuffed mushroom caps (ground chicken and chorizo stuffed)
Baked tetilla (similar to queso fundido)
Tres leches (dessert--three milk cake)
For the traditional folks out there, there are a few large plates, though I cannot remark on them since I've never tried them.

FOOD
Presentation of food was nice--just like Paradise.  One really nice thing I noticed was our order of stuffed dates had 5 dates instead of 4!  Our food was cooked remarkably the same as the Paradise location--good!  Except, there was an order pulpo asado that was way over cooked; some pieces seemed tender to chewy, while some where just too charred and had the texture/density of a brick.  However, overall, the food was good and pleasing, just like the Paradise locale.

SERVICE
Quite surprisingly, it was pretty dead last night (Monday around 8pm) with about 25% occupancy--unike its sister locale who's always bumping 7 days a week.  Our server and food runners were friendly but seemed a bit unorganized and astray.  This is where the star rating dropped.  Our water was brought immediately but, this is a protocol service Firefly does with all tables (just like the bread and olives).  Our party of four (4) orders a Coke, riesling, and cabernet, it took awhile to get them, almost long enough for me to ask where they were.  No biggie.  Our food order was taken promptly after our drinks were served.  We clearly ordered two (2) bacon wrapped stuffed dates but were only served one :-(.  Luckily, our bellies were too full for us to ask where the second order was.  Also, we order pulpo asado but were brought the Big Bowl salad.  Miscommunication but, still no biggie.  In the middle of our dinner, we were almost served another order of stuffed mushroom caps, though we declined them because we were already served our one order.  About two minutes later, I saw they were served to the next table who were eagerly awaiting them.    Disorganization from their staff, still no biggie, to be human is to err.  Though, here's my two big bangs that made my Asian eyes squint.  I was drinking a Coke, and my glass remained empty for probably 10 minutes or so...okay, okay...but I HAD to ask for a refill, argh, duh, if it's empty just bring another or ask me if I'd like another.  The second big bang was, the dirty dishes piled up!  I don't mind stacking my dirties to help the server out, I don't mind them being left there because the server is getting slammed, but I do mind it when the restaurant is at only 25% occupancy, the dirties are piled up, and there was NO attempt at taking dirties away.  On our servers behalf, I can definitely understand when plates aren't taken because there's a few morsels of yummy goodness left but, these were bare to the bone and like I mentioned, stacked.  We weren't even being piglets, only 11 tapas plates were ordered.  I guess I had the expectation of the Paradise location who are awesome about turning over new/dirty plates and keeping extremely organized!  The Main Street locale needs some help, SOS!

BILL
It was correct, even with the one miscommunication and one stuffed dates plate being omitted!

OVERALL
Nice place to dine and be a tourist again.  Firefly on Main Street can easily gain 5 stars in my book with a little elbow grease, attentiveness, communication, and organization.  Like I mentioned the food was wonderful, just like its older sister, but lacks the fluidness and wisdom of the elder sister.
llllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll"}
{"text":"I didn't think food off of the Las Vegas strip had much to offer... until Firefly. I was once a tapas virgin and am now an addict. Seriously,  although I know that my experience at Firefly will not be easily beat, I'm officially on the hunt for tapas in my area.

I compared the experience similar to that of having dim sum. We were presented with small plates packed with medium sized portions and humongous flavor.  My favorite thing to eat were the stuffed dates... wrapped in bacon. Bacon makes the world go round, sorry vegs. Some other meal highlights included a melt-in-your mouth tilapia topped with fried onions, a mushroom pastry, and shrimp ceviche. 

My tummy begged me to stop yet my tongue begged for more. Firefly is a MUST if you need a little flavor in your life."}
{"text":"Went here on a trip to Vegas and man was the food good! I love Tapas but usually always see a $100 bill each whenever I go. Not here!

All the tapas are $4.50-$8 each and the drinks were reasonable too. The result - 6 items and drinks for under $50 for the two of us!

We had:
Chicken Empanadas - my favorite dish, flakey and full of flavor; a lot lighter than a typical empanada. Excellent.

Tuna Tartar - not the best tuna I have eaten but for $8 it was decent for the price

Bacon wrapped almond fig - okay no the official name but you will see the one I am talking about it. If you like bacon order it. The perfect blend of salty and sweet. Has a bit of blue cheese and a balsamic type sauce. Very good.

Apple and Manchu Salad - really awesome. a light and yummy summer salad. I love the fresh green apple cut julian with the almost-blue-cheese. 

Garlic bread with almond butter - the free dish was probably the most unique. I need to know where they got the almond butter from because it was like nothing I have ever tasted. It was galic meets peanut butter, but not. It looked and spread like butter but tasted creamer. So good.

Dessert - Gelato Trio - 3 excellent flavors: chocolate, vanilla and my favorite the pistachio.

Sangria it was the sparkling white one aged for 3 days; very good for a hot summer day

No this wasn't the quality of San Fran tapas but it gets 4 stars for being cheaper than eating at the Olive Garden and excellent food. I will be back on my next trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"Enjoyed this place - awesome food, friendly, courteous servers and prompt service..... this place is highly recommended! Would definitely come back when I'm in LV."}
{"text":"I had a great experience here. I came here around 1230 on a Saturday, and it was not busy at all. My waitress, Irina, was superb. She was very friendly and attentive so excellent service there. We had about seven different tapas, including the chocolate/cherry bread pudding (delicious), bacon dates, mushroom pastry, ceviche, beef salad, and sangria (red and sparkling). I've had better tapas before, but overall tasty dishes and great service."}
{"text":"delicious!! one of my fav restuarants in Vegas! I luv the big salad, garlic shrimp, garlic french fries! minus 1 a star for service and cleaniness.  they are always slammed/busy!"}
{"text":"I planned my birthday party to be held at this location last month and these people really delivered.

I had a group of about 25 and had setup reservations for the lounge area.

I showed up and they allowed me to choose how I wanted the seating arranged which was great and they had it done in less then 10 min.

The waiters were very understanding and very nice. There were no struggles with orders and no conflicts what so ever with anything. Everyone had fun and enjoyed being here I personally absolutely love this location and the staff here are seriously beyond fucking great. Really great managers too I reccomend anyone to go that loves eating tapas."}
{"text":"Primera vez en este restaurante!!!! Excelente servicio, atención inmediata no tuvimos que esperar, la paella deliciosa, diferente variedad de escoger!!!! El sabor riquísimo,  definitivamente recomendado, precios accesibles¡!!"}
{"text":"Cozy restaurant off the beaten Vegas path. Glad we decided to cab it and go outside of the strip. Tapas is not normally my thing, BUT this was quite enjoyable. They were able to accommodate our group of 10 even after we arrived late for our reservation. And yes I would recommend a reservation, this place was pretty packed.

The stuffed dates and the mac n cheese REALLY stood out. Definitely a good place to get the night started or even as a chill spot to have tapas and some drinks if you're looking for a mellow night."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of swinging by Firefly for an early lunch yesterday. Based on the building and parking lot (which is private), they must get incredibly busy later in the day, but at 11:30, I was the 2nd table seated. 

I was seated right away and everyone was friendly. The service was great throughout. The waiter immediately brought bread and butter. The butter was honey and some type of pepper. I don't do bread, but it looked amazing and the sweet/spicy butter was great. 

The waiter recommended 2 items and they were exactly what I had my eye on! So I got the stuffed dates and Tierra y mar from the Hot Tapas menu. Both were awesome. The dates were almonds, dates and then bacon-wrapped and had a red wine reduction and blue cheese on top. The Tierra y Mar was grilled chorizo, shrimp and steak skewers with salsa. Delicious! I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here for our anniversary. 

Pros: 
-It has such a cool, romantic environment with the low lighting and dark colors. 
-The view is AMAZING! 
-There wasn't many people at all, but that could've just been on that day. ---Some of the food is pretty tasty!

Cons:
-The service is as slow as molasses. After we got the menu, we asked for a minute, and she gave us at least 30. We were so hungry that we just wrote down everything we wanted and handed the list to her when she was serving the table next to us, for the 3rd time. This is unacceptable considering there were only about 5 tables of people and 3 servers
- The food really wasn't as good as I expected it to be. I guess all the great reviews left me with high expectations that weren't fulfilled. 

All in all. I would come back, but only for the view and  a little dessert."}
{"text":"I came here for a nice, fresh, cold brew and some tapas and sat at the bar. The ambiance I thought was nice. But I must say, at least compared to Minneapolis and Seattle, the tapas served here are rather mediocre. Beer selection was poor. The tap wasn't working we were told. I guess Vegas is not considered the beer capital of US and for Vegas, maybe this place is considered better than average. Probably not coming back. The nice girl who worked at the bar was nice and friendly though."}
{"text":"The tapas are delicious. We had a mishmash of sorts, the bacon-wrapped dates, the chorizo/chicken mushrooms, the tinga empanada, the mac and cheese. Everything was delicious!!!! Can't decide which is my favorite, but everything was great! The drinks were good, too!"}
{"text":"Firefly was awesome all the food we ordered was delicious. Each dish served had its own authentic taste, every bite was superb and for the price it was off the charts. Wish we had one of these in Hawaii, I'm glad it was the last meal I had in Las Vegas"}
{"text":"A must-stop for me in Vegas.  Love their Mijitos and Sangrias.  The tapas were great with many variety.  My favorite is the lambshops.  Not so crazy on the Firefly fries--not worth the $5.5 price.

Try to get there for Happy Hours.  All drinks are 50%.  If you sit by the bar, you'll get a tapa samplers too.  Also, order by the pitcher.  You'll get 6-7 glass of Mojitos for $28 (or $14 at happy hours)."}
{"text":"Always outstanding. They can get busy at times, but worth it. Grab some Sangria and relax."}
{"text":"Firefly brings Fremont Street the culinary star that has been missing
(not including the fried twinkies, which are, without a doubt,
disgustingly good).  Hidden in the otherwise un-noteworthy Plaza
Hotel, Firefly is a stylish tapas restaurant (Spanish snack or
appetizer cuisine with a variety of smaller dishes) with a cornicopia
of delicious dishes and an excellent view of the Fremont Street
Experience.

My party had a table full of hot dishes, including patatas bravas
(roasted red potatoes in spicy aioli), manchego mac 'n' cheese, and
the empanada (pastry stuffed w/roast pork, red pepper, w/salad,
aioli).  We all kept leaning over the table, sticking our forks in
each other's dishes.  Then we'd order more dishes and more cocktails and look out and watch the lights of the Fremont Street Experience play on the overhead screen.  

Everything was excellent, the wait staff was attentive and friendly and we all lamented that we were full and couldn't try more of the menu.  Firefly is a must-visit spot in Vegas."}
{"text":"First timer! Great place to get some drinks and some appetizers. The food is very tasty. Friday nights and Saturday nights are very busy and it's hard to find parking but other than that the place is very upbeat and is great for a night out with some friends"}
{"text":"I love their Tapas, and mojitos...it can be a pain getting a table if you don't reserve ahead of time, because it can get pretty full especially during summer time. It's can be loud, and it's not that big of a place so expect noise."}
{"text":"The Burrell's love Firefly. We love the bacon wrapped figs and the Paella. We used to come when they were in the old building but they are still great, if not better in the new building. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I heard bad things about this place, but don't listen!!! It's was amazing, went with friends and we each ordered something different. Best thing was the artichoke toast. Loved it!!! The sangria was also incredible. It had apples which are my favorite! Defiantly gonna come back."}
{"text":"Best tapas in Vegas. I've been to that one on the Strip and one in Town Square and those were over priced and so-so on taste, but Firefly has remained continually good! I've been going to Firefly for years and never get tired of their variety of dishes. Their sangria and mojitos are also some of the best I've ever had. They also have the best variety on their menu."}
{"text":"Each dish is exquisitely prepared, promptly brought to the table, and delicious! I can recommend the following:
- Tuna tartare
- STUFFED DATES**!! (i don't even like dates... and this is my favorite dish at firefly)
- Tomato basil soup- nothing too special, but a solid dish
- Manchego mac and cheese
- Ahi Tuna Skewer- didn't realize the tuna would be cooked in this dish, but I was pleasantly surprised when I tried it. Refreshing flavors and the only cooked tuna dish I've ever enjoyed in a restaurant
- Blueberry mojito!
- The bread brought to the table is nothing special, but the spread it is served with is really good (:

5 stars for the food quality and creativity alone. Not much to say about service. Oh, no outside drinks."}
{"text":"Read all the reviews and they did not fail me! Love everything that i had here from the stuffed dates ( which are to DIE FOR) to the mac and cheese. Probably had 6 different types of tapas and all of them are very good and mouthwatering! The sangria is good but i prefer the mojito better. They pack it up with a lot of lime that's not too overpowering. The food was excellent (whatever tapas you order, but i definitely love the stuffed dates, tuna tartare and filet mignon sliders -they melt in your mouth... And you're left with the bread) service was good and atmosphere is great. This will definitely be one of my main stops when i visit vegas!!!! Plus it's happy hour!!! So all drinks are half off!!!! Even better!"}
{"text":"Hands down my FAVORITE restaurant in Vegas.  Love everything about this place - the ambiance, the food, the service - all great.  Give it a try next time you are in Vegas!  You will love it too!"}
{"text":"Ummmmm, can we talk about the banana-Nutella sandwiches?!?!... AMAZING! The best rendition of a comfort food-turned dessert I have ever had. It made a lasting impression since it was one of the last things we ate, but there wasn't one thing we ordered (out of about 13 items) that we didn't like. 

Larger portions, yet lower prices than you would expect from a tapas restaurant, and the food will take your taste buds on a culinary adventure they won't forget. 

Favorites: Baked tetilla, stuffed dates, empanadas, crispy duck rolls, and of course the banana-Nutella sandwiches

Favorite condiment: spicy tarter sauce (comes with the fish sticks - FAR from your typical freezer section fish sticks). 

You do not want to miss this place if you go to Vegas!"}
{"text":"Loved the food and service.

- Bacon wrapped dates are a must have! 
- Same for the Kobe beef sliders that come with that delish chipotle aioli. 
- The garlic butter and bread were a cherry on top. 

Our server was kind enough to replace our drinks which weren't on par with our expectations and the replacements were amazing! Great spot right off the strip if you want to have great food and alcohol for a reasonable price."}
{"text":"What hasn't already been said about Firefly? It's one of the best restaurants in town.  Since everyone knows, I'll keep it short.

Beautiful interior, service is superb, food is mind-blowing, diverse menu, awesome location.

The only drawback is how busy this place can get! That's why make a reservation if you ever decide to go!

PRO: Food, Decoration, Service are all great!
CON: Can get a bit busy and noisy during peak hours"}
{"text":"I am a HUGE fan of Firefly. My boyfriend took me to the Paradise location a couple of years ago and I was instantly hooked. Once I made the move to Vegas, I thought I might get tired of my favorite restaurant. Um, no chance.

The prices simply can't be beat and the atmosphere is perfect for either a romantic meal or a night out with friends. I take almost all of my out of town visitors here and no one has once complained. Not once. 

You must order the stuffed dates. Seriously. This is not optional; it's a requirement and, yes, you can thank me later. Other favorites of mine include: the ham and cheese croquetas, the filet mignon sliders and - my new favorite - the tuna peppers. As for drinks, you really can't go wrong. I'm a big fan of the sparkling sangria because it is just so light and refreshing, but I've tried many of their drinks and they really are all fantastic.

Although I originally fell for the Paradise location (very close to my home), the new downtown location at the Plaza is really where it's at. It looks out over the Fremont Street Experience light show and, trust me, you'll love it.

My only complaint is that the service can be pretty mediocre. Nothing too serious, just worth noting. Honestly, it is much better at the Paradise location, but the ambiance and view of the downtown spot more than makes up for it.

Go order yourself some dates and sangria and savor the view. You'll eat it up. Literally."}
{"text":"one of the best bargains in vegas. great food. great service. we were seated close the door which may have been the reason it was quite hot. other than that it was perfect."}
{"text":"Tapas and Sangria...yes please! I go here whenever I am in Vegas, and have introduced this restaurant to some of my friends as well and everyone loves it. You can eat here and drink and still have money to gamble. The restaurant is in a small shopping center, so parking is difficult. I would also make reservations on a Friday or Saturday night, since it is pretty popular. 

My favorites are the sangria, tuna tartare, stuffed dates (love blue cheese and bacon), ham and cheese croquetas, and filet mignon sliders. However, go somewhere else for dessert if you are craving sweets....they are not good at Firefly."}
{"text":"Best damn Tapas in USA and bar none best servers, service and Atmosphere for Lunch or Dinner. Great for Couples, Families, Friends and Business trip.  Have never had a bad dish and reasonably priced so you can order 6-10 items!! The best!!"}
{"text":"Tapas and sangria, can there be anything better? The atmosphere is intimate and dark, a nice place for a date or a small group of friends. Make sure to make a reservation or you may have to wait a while for a table. Their waiting area is small and only consists of 4 chairs. 

You know that Firefly is a legit place for sangria because they offer three types: red, white, and sparkling. I loved the sparkling because it was made with white wine and champagne, the fruit pieces even included blueberries. 

Big Bowl Salad [5/5]
Tossed with romaine, spinach, sherry vinaigrette, red pepper, tomato, artichoke, pine nuts, and blue cheese. Great salad to split, especially since we ordered some tapas!

Stuffed Dates [5/5]
They were bacon wrapped and stuffed with a smoked almond and blue cheese. The dates were smaller compared to other places I've had them, but the flavor combination was amazing. 

Firefly Fries [4/5]
Lightly seasoned with parmesan and garlic, aioli on the side. This was a large basket and great for sharing! 

Crispy Duck Roll [5/5]
Think of a giant egg roll stuffed with duck and served with cherry hoisin sauce. We knew this one would be amazing when we saw a yelp photo while waiting for our table ;)

Tuna Tartare [4.5/5]
The marinated ahi tuna with avocado was great, but there were only two giant taro chips to compliment them, In pictures we saw, there for four chips. Not a big deal, just wished there were more fresh taro chips!

Manchego Mac 'N' Cheese [4/5]
Their macaroni of choice was baby shells, which was great for the dish. This dish was definitely cheesy, not the best I've had, but not bad at all!

Service was great and attentive, though the coffee cups are small, my friend needed a few refills - they should have left him the pot. 

Parking might be hard to find, but not impossible. By the time we finished dinner there were taxis lined up. One limo driver even asked if we needed a ride home. 

If it wasn't so cold out, the enclosed patio looked like a nice option. Perhaps next time!"}
{"text":"I found this restaurant on OpenTable.com and then looked at the Yelp reviews to verify. I made a late reservation after seeing Zumanity at NYNY.   We took a short cab ride over, and our driver verified we had made a great choice for dinner. 

The outside seating was pretty bare because it was cold, but once we stepped inside it was packed. I was glad I had made a reservation becuase we were seated right away. We ordered the red sangria.....excellent. A little on the sweet side, but very good. The service was very fast, and they brought out each tapa as soon as it was done, so our food was hot.

We ordered: manchego mac n cheese, patatas bravas, chicken skewers, and mini sirloin burgers. Everything was great, and the patatas bravas were really spicy . I have had them at other tapas restaurants, but these were the best. The mac and cheese was also excellent. Everything we had, we would order again. The menu is very reasonable. I look forward to going back again next time I'm in Vegas. We had a wonderful meal and I highly recomment it."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Everything was absolutely delicious! And better yet we were able to share and try everything! Would recommend this place highly"}
{"text":"Ok.... So I have told about this place time and time and time again


Finally went and was. It disappointed 

The bacon wrapped dates...are a must order fir anyone.... Ohh man I want to go back after writing this..


Also the shrimp Diabla the sauce amazing..

Sangria amazing red that is 

Service was great..


Will follow up with more details"}
{"text":"My wife and I absolutely love Tapas- so when we got to Vegas this was an absolute must and they definitely didn't disappoint. We started with a pitcher of Sangria that we were able to both get 3 cups out of- so that's a super win. As for the menu, it ranges from Cold, Hot, Seafood, and Meat Tapas so we were in Heaven.  

We started with Some Shrimp ceviche that was incredible. Next we tried the Stuffed peppers that were solid. Being that we look Chicago style Italian beef sandwich with had to try their version in the tapas form and boy are we glad we did. It was three mini-mini size hoagie Italian beef that were delicious. We also tried the stuffed mushroom and the empanadas that were good. 

All and All we had a blast here and definitely would come back. All the food and drinks came at reasonable price so don't be alarmed."}
{"text":"AN extra star because they are open until 2 a.m. but minus a half a star because they don't tell you when you call that you need reservations even at 11:30 at night.  Thankfully you can sit at the bar and apparently the place has regulars so pull your stool up to one of them, and if sober, they'll tell you what's good or not.

This joint is jumping and its easy to understand why; the service is fast and friendly, the food is very tasty, a bit creative and very inexpensive.  My and my hungry mouth sister went and with cocktails had a bill of only $30.  I thought I was back in South America and the menu's latin style flavor only reinforces that.

We passed on the famous (soaks 3 days for flavor!) sangria but enjoyed a number of delights.  Their signature Firefly fries are a bit greasy but quite tasty."}
{"text":"Favorite restaurant in all of Vegas. We've made trips to Vegas planned around eating here. The service is always great. The sangria is amazing! Happy hour prices can't be best. The best tapas are the bacon wrapped dates and the croquetas. Their chocolate tres leches is delicious! Definitely venture off the strip to go here!"}
{"text":"Firefly is an awesome tapas restaurant. I must get the bacon-wrapped dates every time. I also enjoy the camarones a la diabla, albondigas, croquettes and mushroom tart. I have tried many dishes and have not had a bad one.

The sangria is by far the best in town.

Normally, the service is hit or miss, depending on how busy they are. At times, it can get a bit noisy, so I usually request to sit outside where it's a bit quieter.

Overall, a great value for the price."}
{"text":"Its loud, dark and sexy. I like this place and with the right company it IS a blast. Not normally a tapas person  but i was very pleasantly surprised by it. The service is good although they forgot to bring everyone's coctails and we had to remind the waiter.

Good stuff: albondigas, the artichoke dish, the mushroom pastry thing, all the mojitos obviously. I liked the pomagranate mojito but prefer the mango. Overall I can totally see coming back here.

Plus they have a ton of vegetarian dishes for baby and if baby is happy im happy. If baby not happy, all hell breaks loose so nice job firefly on paradise. You kept the hell storm at bay."}
{"text":"Sangria and lamb chops at 1:00 a.m. in the morning, baby."}
{"text":"Great place! Food is spectacular. Favorite tapas dish is the bacon-wrapped stuffed dates; just amazing! Everything we had was really fantastic.

- Bacon-wrapped Stuffed Dates
- Tomato Bread
- Baked Goat Cheese
- Chicken Skewers
- Albondigas

So good!"}
{"text":"Have always loved The original Firefly on Paradise, but actually prefer this west side locations ambiance more. Brittany is an awesome bartender with a great personality!  She made our dining experience wonderful. Was very patient since I couldn't figure out what I wanted to try that I haven't had before! Great suggestions!  Will be back more when she's here! Btw. The food is always terrific! I love the bacon wrapped dates, and the warm spinach salad is delicious! So many great things........."}
{"text":"Ive been here more times then I can count for business dinners.  Always consistent and always amazing meals.  Tapas give you so many choices and bites for dinner.  We ordered wine this time ...  2nd bottle recommended by staff was better than the one I picked."}
{"text":"Heard so much about them, so my boyfriend and I planned our date night there. 
Making reservations was hard, all the hostess told us was to call ahead. But even for 2 people, we still had to wait about 20 minutes on a chilly night. The wait was worth it though.

It's a very social restaurant and can also be a romantic place to take a date, as it's very dark inside, with hints of lights from the table to the walls.

Their stuff dates is really the business, that's all I can think about. My mouth is starting to water. Their mac and cheese hit close to home. And their paella was delish as well. Our other tapas was great but the dates and mac and cheese left a great impression. The portions are small which is great, because you get to try more things out on their menu. I loved, loved their complimentary bread and butter, their butter was different and my boyfriend isn't a big fan of things like that but he killed that before we even got to order. I was too shy to ask for seconds. I wish I could have ordered that to-go if the option was available.

They do get pretty crowded and I now understand why. As one table cleared, it was filled back up shorty after. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Love this place! The food is great and the view is excellent. We loved their pork empanadas, paella, and calamari! The prices are unbelievable. They also took a really nice picture of us--free, but give you an option to buy more."}
{"text":"Excellent food and very fun to eat! A little pricey, but they have a good happy hour - all drinks half off, including pitchers! We have been here several times and never had a bad dish. You have to try the stuffed dates. They are small, so get something bigger to go with - but they are totally worth it. You will probably wind up ordering another round."}
{"text":"A MUST for me every time I'm in town! Absolutely LOVE this place. Always a pleasure coming here, from environment to servers everyone if so nice and fast!"}
{"text":"We came to Firefly to celebrate my fiance's birthday while on a one-night trip to Vegas.  It was my first time at this type of restaurant.  We started off with the sparking sangria, and proceeded to order half of the menu to share among 4 people.  The food was great, but service was a bit slow.  The server didn't offer any recommendations, which seemed odd since the menu is long, and it's a popular place.

Unfortunately, 50% of our party came down with salmonella poisoning a day later.  My fiance was very ill for 10 days and lost over 14 pounds.  I was lucky, and didn't get sick.  We aren't sure why, but I didn't have any of the seafood dishes, so perhaps it was something there.  

The food was great, so it's disappointing that their standard of cleanliness with their food preparation is so low."}
{"text":"Great drinks and great food. What else is there? This joint has a small patio for outside seating and has a cozy and clean interior. I wouldn't call it upscale, but it's a nice place to get away from the crazies at the casinos for tapas. The prices were pretty reasonable even for tapas. Sampled in this run: Albondigas (meatballs with a sherry sauce), Sliders (very juicy with a kick!), Big Salad, Cheese stuffed peppers, veggi empanadas and a huge pitcher of mango mojitos. We capped the meal with Cheese cake and tres leches cake. The food was filling, but I have to admit the Big Salad was big, but sort of uninspiring. It's a ceaser salad with some standard salad stuff, heart of palm etc. The peppers were great but, it's nothing to write home about, was just a pepper with cheese, maybe I didn't get enough sauce. The meatballs, sliders and empanadas were good and offered a better depth of flavor. The cheesecake was pretty standard fair and I felt the lemon sauce over powered the dish a little. The tres leches was great, even better than some I had in Mexico, it was the perfect consistency and was very sweet.

This is a great spot for a meal with friends, and a great spot for drinks too! Don't forget the bar!!!"}
{"text":"Came here with my friend who is a local in Vegas. This place seems to have a few delicious choices on the menu. Bacon wrapped dates, escargot, mac n cheese and much more.  They offer a great variety of tapas and drinks. Good place to meet up or hang out with friends."}
{"text":"Server was excellent. Busser or server assistant was terrible. My cousin came to visit from Peru. I wanted her to try one of my favorite restaurants. I asked the busser to take a photo of us (closest person at the time) and he was the rudest!! He seriously gridded his teeth and took the phone from me with out saying a word. He acted as though I slapped him in the face.. Last time I checked you're in the service industry, to SERVE! Like I said my food was great, server was great but the bussing staff is terrible. He just made us feel uncomfortable the entire time. Took every single thing off our table with out smiling or making himself friendly by any means..."}
{"text":"Firefly lived up to every review. The mojitos were amazing (mojitos are my fave and I order them everywhere), especially the Passion Fruit one, and my boyfriend ordered the house-made infused vodka on the rocks, which was also amazing, and not nearly as strong-tasting as you would think. The food was great, and the prices were even better. We sat outside and the service was slow, but it was a monday night. The music was also a bit loud, but oh well. The baby back mango-bbq ribs were awesome and literally falling off the bone. The stuffed dates were amazing, the calamari was thick-cut and delicious. The stuffed mushrooms with chorizo and chicken were good, but not great, and same goes for the salmon with brioche toasts. They were both good, but I guess just not what we were in the mood for. We will definitely be going back!

We have been back to Firefly about 4-5 times since I last reviewed...still wonderful! They have added a few more tapas dishes to the menu, and it seems some of the portions got bigger, which we were happy about. We were especially happy they were able to sit us on Valentine's Day with no reservation (Dragonfly was closed and they were apparently using their dining room for the spillover...or maybe it was just another dining room?), the service was fast and the waiter kept our mojitos filled to the brim. After about 5 or so trips here now, I can definitely say it is one of our all-time favorite places to eat in all of Vegas. It's easy, affordable, delicious, the ONLY negative is the atrocious parking lot..but that's no one's fault...there are 5 other restaurants in the same small shopping center, and that's just poor planning."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!
The chef is outstanding! The staff is super helpful and all the food and drinks are amazing."}
{"text":"A great place for happy hour. A great place to meet up with people. A great place for pitchers of sangria. A great place to order tapas and share them with your friends. I arrived at 4 when they opened and by 5:00 this place was buzzing with laughter and fun. My group ordered a variety of items off the menu and ended up sharing them which was a great way to sample. The sangria was bubbly and refreshing. I would definitely go again with a group of people. I did like the dark and romantic vibe of the decor and the background music set the tone of the evening."}
{"text":"Friendly staff but concerning the food : VERY disappointed ! 
Spanish potatoes : still raw. The tuna tartare : too big cutted pieces. The meatballs : fresh made ? The shrimps tempura : 4 shrimps but the rest wasn't tasteful (our advice : delete it asap). The only thing that was good was the lamb : strong & lovely taste. The drinks : red sangria was ok (made with sprankling water) and the normal mojito was only too strong.
We love Spanish food, but this was not a reference, sorry. I'm sure we will not return."}
{"text":"Ate at this new location once before I moved, but I used to frequent the spot that closed due to problems and have been to the Sahara location, this one is better. Firefly is awesome for drinks w/ friends, a date, or whatever. This place does tapas right. Many interesting choices and great cocktails. 

There's quite a lot to choose from, so you'll probably be back again. My favorites are the coconut mussels, fish sticks, and tuna stuffed peppers. There are many other notable items, including hot/cold options featuring shrimp, beef, chicken, fish, etc. Their drinks are the best I've had. I'm a beer girl, so when I order sangria or a pomegranate mojito, you know something is up. 

Prices are reasonable. I love the ambiance and the service is always good here. It's better here than at Sahara, for some reason, so come here if you have the option."}
{"text":"I love to try a multitude of things at one time, and tapas is the way to go for that food mood.  This was my first time going to Firefly after watching them on a rerun of that restaurant makeover show.  I was a bit hesitant, but it turns out that the service is decent.  

The food, however, is okay but lacks finesse and pop that I expect when I pay $10 for two small sliders, for example.  I also bit down on a fish bone on my ahi tuna dish.  Ouchies.  I didn't tell the staff, but I do have a picture of the bone just in case anything happens to my gums in a few days.

Any who, service was decent and the best part of the tapas experience there were the steak and mushroom skewers.  I don't dig paying that much for small plates, so I guess I don't fit into that \"in\" crowd.  I also didn't dig the black walls.  The whole color scheme screamed villain to me for some reason. 

Well, posh pals, I'll leave you to your tapas foo foo and stick to other ways to catch a bite.  Still, nice place, nice people, but nothing I will swoon for in the near or distant future."}
{"text":"Very solid place to sit down and have fun with a group of friends over a pretty varied menu of tapas plates to try from. We went around 5 oclock on a weekday and it was  happy hour, ordered a decent pitcher of red wine sangria for half price. They also has sparkling and white wine sangria, as well as mojitos. My girl and I tried....

- Crispy duck rolls (Way heavy on the tangy sauce)
- Calamari (Recommended by waiter, but as good as any seafood place)
- Firefly Fries (Not a bad basket of fries with Parmesan cheese and seasonings)
- Cheese stuffed figs (MMMhhh)
- Stuffed mushrooms (Tasty as well, but nothing outstanding)

The rest of the party's dishes looked pretty good as well. I would say atmosphere more than the food makes it an enjoyable place to be with friends. Although the prices are not too expensive and you order as much as you want to eat. I think my friends and I might come here again next time we're in vegas."}
{"text":"Horrible food and service....Lisa was our waitress, 1st we ordered a bottled she brought us regular, we had to wait...which is ok accidents happen, I ordered a hot tea,  they brought an assortment, the person I was with ordered tea also, Lisa dropped off an empty cup and didn't bother bringing the assortment to them until we asked, filet mignon skewer was tough, overcooked...we didn't hardly eat it, we got chicken fried bread , forgot what it's called very tough and old, fish cod was tough we didn't eat that at all, manager took it off, just terrible all around..."}
{"text":"The tapas were very tasty and they have a bunch of choices for people with allergies.  The paella wasn't spectacular but the tapas made up for it.  My only complaint was that it was very loud which made it difficult to have a conversation."}
{"text":"Just love this restaurant...great staff, great food and they serve Stella Artois."}
{"text":"CUSTOMER SERVICE: was average. Nothing special. Host was not inviting. Services hardly came to our table.
FOOD: Its more of an appetizer and drinking place. Has a couple of entrees but I dont really recommend it. But if you are hungry there is that option. There small plates/appetizers are very good. Alot of them have alot of flavor. 
DRINKS: AMAZING! I would definitely say this is a drinking place. Sangria amazing. Mojito amazing!"}
{"text":"Thanks Yelp!
Once again, we have found a restaurant that we would not have visited if we would only have followed the tourist information in an unknown city.

When we were in Vegas last week, we checked Yelp for restaurants close to the Hard Rock Hotel, where we stayed. Firefly on Paradise had such exceptionally good reviews that we decided to try it... And we were not disappointed.
Greeted by a very friendly waiter with the funkiest hairstyle (a leopard-Mohawk combination that rocks!), we were seated immediately at a very nice table by the window.
Following other reviews, we tried the sparkling sangria (usually I always go for red one, but omg, this is delicious!). It had blueberries, apples and pears which we picked out - awesome.

We were pretty hungry, so we decided to go with 3 Tapas each. For European standards, that would be the minimum, here you get ore American-sized Tapas, and we were stuffed after 3 per person.
We had the Apple Manchego Salad (which I copy at home now, it's so simple yet so good), the veggie empanada (yumm), the pulpo asado (great fresh pulpo with a nice sauce), the Thai beef salad (pretty large tapa, very good), the merguez ( you get two sausages, nicely spicy), and of course we had to try the dates (my family lives in Spain, and we had a lot of bacon-wrapped dates there - Firefly dates are even better!).
We decided we had to try the desserts after those tapas, so we went with chocolate cakes tres leches and the bread pudding. Again, the presentation is mouthwatering, and the taste simply exquisite.

It's a shame we don't live here, otherwise I'd be a regular. Make sure to try out this tapas restaurant when you're in Vegas, especially if you stay in the Hard Rock Hotel or closeby - it's just a little walk away!"}
{"text":"I went to Firefly for the UYE, but my schedule didn't allow me to stay for the group so I went a little early.

I got there at 5pm, and had no problem snagging a stool at the bar. They run a Happy Hour from 4-6 with half priced drinks, and I must say the Mojitos were really good.

This summer I decided I'm gonna try Mojitos whenever possible and have been drinking my way across town, I have to say Firefly's are top notch.

I had the Pomegranate and the Watermelon Mojitos, both were hand muddled, the Pomegranate included Pomegranate Juice, while the watermelon one included some watermelon syrup that made it taste just like a Jolly rancher.

They also had Sangria that looked amazing, but I wasn't really in a wine type of mood.

As for eats I had the Meatballs, i think there were 6 meatballs that were served in a tomato sauce and topped with Parmesan cheese, the meatballs weren't anything super fancy but good, but the sauce and cheese were great.

I also had their Tomato Basil Soup- The soup was amazing, you could really taste both the tomato and the basil. It came with a Bire grilled cheese that was surprisingly good, I'm usually not a Brie fan, but this was a very delicious companion to the soup.

The bread and olives that they serve is a nice touch, the compound garlic butter was amazing, and it was a great starter to the meal.

I will be going back and trying my way across the drink and tapas menu, undoubtedly during happy hour!!!"}
{"text":"Food was just okay, service was lacking (only saw our server 3 times), we ordered hot appetizers and most came out cold or luke warm at best, the sangria was very lacking and had maybe a tablespoon of fruits to compliment the drink, and finally the mixed paella the dish that can make or break whether a true Spanish restaurant is good and it came out burnt and the flavor was lacking all the foods flavor in fact was just okay, we walked away disappointed."}
{"text":"Firefly is amazing - from the food to the drinks, to the great ambiance and fantastic service. Manny G came up with a fantastic mojito not even on menu - strawberry, cranberry, and malibu! The place is easily in my all-time favorite Vegas places and I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This tapas bar and restaurant off the Strip, is definitely a hidden Vegas gem. My friends and I came into Vegas on Friday, and decided to check this place out. Prices are fantastic and range from an average of $5 to $10 per tapa dish. I ordered the bacon-wrapped dates stuffed with almonds. Bacon-wrapped dates are one of my favorite tapas, so the almond was definitely a different texture than what I was used to, but still tasty. In addition, I got the veggie empanadas, which were quite savory. I was saddened that there were only two of those on the plate. My table ordered a pitcher of sangria for $28, which was a steal. Firefly* also has some affordable desserts, and so I shared the chocolate tres leches cake with a friend, and was more than happy with its taste and texture--not too sweet, and not too runny.

I am not sure about other nights, but definitely on Fridays, it can be quite loud with the live band, so be prepared to use your outdoor voice inside. The band, Space to Pace, played light salsa music. After seeing one of the waiters dance with a hostess, I really wish I knew how to salsa dance (note to self: take some salsa lessons). I love Latin music, especially the classics like, Oye Como Va and Guantanamera, which they both played, and so it was a treat to be there that night to listen and clap along with the band, as well as enjoy tasty, inexpensive food with great company. This will definitely be a go-to spot every time I go to Vegas."}
{"text":"This place is great.  If you are in Vegas for a couple days for business, or just for the night, definatly worth your time.  Great tapas, great service, awesome happy hour from 4-6 with half priced pitchers of sangria.  Perfect place to dine alone at the bar.  If you do not know what to order, ask one of the bartenders and they will guide you."}
{"text":"A couple of dishes disappointed me this past weekend, but I still had a wonderful time at Firefly.

Tip: They do not accept reservations for parties of less than 10 on Fridays and Saturdays, and this place can get really pack. I highly recommend going before 7:30 P.M, or you're going to wait 30 minutes for 2 people, and more depending on the size of your party.

I ordered the Paella (my favorite dish) and it did not disappoint me again. For $18, you get a well made dish and a lot of food here. You can easily share this dish with 4 people. Since it was my favorite dish, I ate 75% of it.   5 / 5 Stars

Do not order the fries here. The portion of the fries were generous (a basket actually), but it was not prepared well at all. McDonald's fries are out of this world when you compare them to Firefly. 1.5 / 5 stars 

-Empanadas:  first time eating Empanadas and I actually liked it.  The ground meat inside had a nice textured and it was stuffed inside a pie-like crust. 3.5 / 5 stars

-Mac & Cheese: Macaroni Shells were used in this dish, a little different, but I was fine with it. I would probably avoid ordering this simply because it wasn't as cheesy as I would like, and it definitely did not have a thick crispy layer of cheese crust. 2 / 5 stars

-Stuffed Dates: I actually enjoyed my dates a little more this trip. I definitely enjoyed biting into the almond and tasting bacon at the same time. 4 / 5 stars.

Watermelon Mojita like mostly reviews mentioned, tasted a lot like a Jollyrancher. I'm not a fan of this drink. I would avoid ordering, and stick with the Sangria. 2 / 5 stars

For dessert, I had the Bread Pudding and it came out cold. I spoke to the server and they corrected it. It was my 2nd time trying this dessert, a lot better the first time. 3.5 / 5 stars"}
{"text":"i do love the food here. i have been here a few times and everytime the service just gets me. i understand it is a busy restaurant but pay attention to your customers. we are the ones leaving you your tip. now like i said i love the food but for service purposes i would rather just eat tapas at barcelona tapas & bar and that is why i give it 3 stars.
if you do venture to firefly despite the snobby service i would make sure to try the tuna tartare. it is very sweet and something i always would get. the stuffed dates which are full of flavor. terra y mare skewers were great and i got to taste three different meats. the filet mignon sliders with firefly fries are pretty good and basic if you are afraid to let your taste buds explore. i also really like the empanadas. it had a little spice to it which won me. i also like their infused vodka. you can really taste the berries and lychees, but beware because they hit you fast.
i hope everyone else that goes here gets better service than i have. enjoy their food and drinks!"}
{"text":"Our business group found Firefly a couple years ago at the old location up the block on Paradise and fell in love with it for entertaining customers. The food and service were outstanding, and the Tapas theme great for having a fun business meal. The place was noisy, but you could still hear each other. However this trip to Firefly we found the restaurant had moved to a new and larger location just about a block up the road, however the building has low ceilings and terrible acoustics, making the once passable noise level for business unacceptable. Also, the tables are really small, so once you seat six or more people, and they start bringing Tapas, there is simply ZERO room to put the food! Unfortunately we will now sadly not return for business meals, but will always go for the Bacon-wrapped Dates!"}
{"text":"Thank you Javier for directing us to this off-strip Tapas place. 

The sangria was dangerously delicious.  Don't go there thirsty as you'll suck down a glass only to realize that woops, there is alcohol mixed in with the fruity goodness.

I don't recall all the tapas we ordered but let's just say that as someone who HATES lamb...I would not only eat, but order lamb at this place.  Yum.   

We ordered:

Tortilla de Papa 
Ceviche
Filet Skewers
Some kinda bacon wrapped in almond thing that was like a thousand mini foodgasms in my mouth.

Oh and be sure to try their flavor infused vodka shots..YUMMY!"}
{"text":"Great food. Mac and cheese and bacon dates unreal.. Great wine. Sat at the bar, nice setup.."}
{"text":"It's been awhile but the food quality remains awesome!! A lot of tapas to choose and we ordered 5 and they were all delicious & flavorful. Red wine Sangria a must try!!! Finished up with the chocolate tres leche. I couldn't give 5 stars because the service was not great. Our server, Ivan came to our table...no greetings, no introduction, no smile. Basically asked us \"Anything to drink?\". Took our order, delivered the food and didn't come back to ask how's the food, need anything...we had to flag him down to order more tapas. It was disappointing and it was not busy at 9:30 pm. Nevertheless, we will return because the food is just too good"}
{"text":"I went to this tapas bar a few months ago and the service was awful. 

Then last week (despite my moaning and groaning) my friends really wanted to go to Firefly.  I couldn't believe that I was in the same place.  The wait staff was amazing! Everything was great from the food straight down to the service.  Well done, Firefly!  Keep it up!"}
{"text":"What an experience! 

First off, we decided to go on Valentine's Day, after we eloped, so this would be our special wedding dinner....having never been....I solely booked a reservation based on yelp reviews.
The restaurant is beautiful! Black velvet wall paper, red velvet booths, perfect dinner lighting.  Even the staff's uniform is great! Everyone was so professional,  kind and attentive. The perfect spot for a special event! The beautiful manager offered us a complimentary glass of champagne and checked in on us a couple times, she was so nice! We decided to purchase the photos from the young lady taking shots of guests. She did an amazing job!

We got blood orange mojito and sparkling sangria. Both drinks were big, mixed exactly right and it was happy hour! Bonus!!!!

 Our server suggested a tapa item from each section, we decided to get 2 of her 4 suggestions. We also got the special of the night YES! They were so good. Here's what we decided on:
Boquerones, anchovies on toast w/roasted red pepper, vinegar, fresh avocado and greens. Delicious! Everything blended quite well... the acid from the vinegar was a perfect touch.

Bacon wrapped dates.  W/smoked almond and bleu cheese. I could eat a platter of these!! They were addicting! A MUST try

Eggplant cannenoli with goat cheese. Tender, thin sliced eggplant, creamy filling, light tomato sauce. Excellent

 Grilled Octopus with roasted potato and diced pepper relish . I Love this dish. I don't remember the title of it, but it was cooked perfectly. I usually get octopus or squid and this dish was one of my all time favorites. Acidic, sweet, and a textural delight.

Heart of palm \"crab cake\" a vegan choice...very very VERY good. Over baby greens topped w an aoili, these cakes were prepared perfectly, lightly panseared, perfectly moist and very fresh.

Special was...Red Snapper and grilled shrimp over grilled asparagus w pomegranate sauce.
Again, another fantastic dish. It was cooked perfectly, especially the seafood. So tasty! 

We got the dessert platter, had a couple bites and took it togo since we were full. Every item was fresh. Chocolate tres leche was our favorite as well as passionate fruit cheesecake.

I Would absolutely recommend Firefly and we may go again before we leave Las Vegas, as there were many more things to try."}
{"text":"I'm writing this from the bar at Firefly as I enjoy a glass of pinot grigio,  Serrano ham and manchego cheese and the bacon wrapped dates. It's 1:30 pm and it's pretty quiet in here. Let me preface my comments by saying that I have lived in Spain and frequented many tapas bars there and in southern California, where I live. The prices are very reasonable. Comparable dishes at other places would cost the same or more in California. The portion of Serrano ham is very generous and delicious. I got my food quickly. Both items are beautifully presented and tasty. I will definitely come back. They have ample parking that's free. They have an extensive wine selection."}
{"text":"Firefly is a great place for reasonably priced gourmet tapas. I've eaten there three times and as recently as last week. The food always is flavorful and presented well. 

I'm docking a star because the service has been consistently slow. The wait staff takes a while to come around after you're seated, and then they doesn't check in that often. The other side of that is that they are really friendly and make great suggestions.  Their bus staff is incredible. Plates are cleared promptly and water glasses are kept full. 

I'm wondering if it's Spanish thing to have laid back slow wait staff? Maybe that's part of the authentic experience. In any case the food is great, it comes out as it's made and the hostess and bus staff are definitely working hard. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Best tapas hands down!  Wow!  I can only say try everything.  The bacon wrapped dates are pure heaven.  The surf & turf skewers rocked too.  

And definitely have a glass or pitcher of homemade sangria.  Great vibe, A+ service, friendly staff all make for a very moderately priced venue that should cost a lot more.

I'll be back again!!"}
{"text":"I really like this place and have been dozens of times. Happy hour is good but limited, wish they would add more items or switch them occasionally. 

I love the 
Apple and cheese salad
Ribs
Chicken skewer 
And many other things. All small plates (tapas) so ideal to get 2-3 things and maybe share few things. 

Don't get the fries, they're SO bad! How can you make world class tapas but serve terrible French fries is just silly to me. I guarantee almost 50% of the fries get thrown in the garbage, the owner should be ashamed they haven't been removed or fixed. 

Great service almost all of the time, rarely been unhappy with they. I have brought groups of 10+ without reservation a few times and got seated and served reasonably quick. 

I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"I would give this restaurant 4.5 stars.  Firefly was a really great restaurant with a nice ambience, friendly waiters, and yummy food.  Reservations are highly recommended if you have a big party.  We came as a party of 7 and we were seated on time with our reservation (waiting for 30 minutes after reservation time is one of my pet peeves).  We were worried about the portion sizes because most tapas are really really small.  But we were pleasantly surprised because each plate was large enough for all 7 of us to try and then go for seconds!  

4.5 stars for:
*friendly staff
*clean bathrooms
*large portions
*excellent presenation of food
*food came out FAST
*nice variety of foods

minus .5 star for their weak sangria... it was very watered down and i've had much better at other restaurants.  

Other than that, I think i'll make this restaurant a regular dining experience everytime i come to vegas!"}
{"text":"Went here for our anniversary dinner Friday night before Mother's Day. The cons are very few so let me start those off. 

VERY LOUD! The location, and I love the decor and ambiance, but with the place full of customers, it was extremely hard to have a conversation with hubby (and yes I was sitting next to him). The place echoes a lot on top of all the conversation, so by the time you leave you almost have a headache, and the traffic sounds are peaceful crickets! Then again we went on a Friday night - so of course it was really busy, but still - a bit louder than I would have liked. Won't stop us from coming out again, but may decide to eat outside next time where it will be a bit quieter. 

We had the seafood paella, and it was very mouth watering good - really good! Just a tad too much salt in it. Not enough to make you stop eating it, but enough to make your throat parched enough.

Like I said those are my cons. Now on to the pros!

Roasted Baby Beet Salad
     Very light and flavorful! Didn't know beets could be yellow, so we were 
     pleasantly surprised on that one. A nice start.

Roasted Eggplant Cannelloni
     YUMMMY!!! The eggplant flavor being very delicate was a little overpowered by 
     the cheese filling, but I kept going for more. Also noted the cheese filling 
     tended to get stuck in my upper mouth. But like I said - yummy! Couldn't put my 
     fork down. 

Pulpo Asado
     What a yummy delicate surprise! The tenderness was so awesome and spot on!     
     They paired the pulpo with potatoes, giving it a very earthy flavor, but the herbs 
     kept it just light & airy in the mouth. Mouth watering just thinking about this dish.

Empenada
     I'll admit I was a little hesitant to eat this when I saw the pastry had been 
     charred, & was tough to cut into. When biting into it - the pastry just melted away 
     in the mouth, and a very nice fire popped into the mouth! All the different spices, 
     & herbs - we just were in heaven!

And as noted above the seafood paella well worth it! Like I mentioned a tad too much salt in it, but we loved it!

Passionfruit Cheesecake
     Oh baby. Ohhhhh baby! Now THIS ya gotta have! Perfect round little morsels... I 
     still want more!!!!!

Service
     Can not find one fault with them! Spot on service! Drinks refilled at the perfect moment, without even asking! Very polite and making sure all our needs were being met. 

Yeah we'll come back. :D"}
{"text":"It's Friday night, reserved a lounge seating for 6 ppl at 10:30pm. We arrived on time and were seated immediately with no wait. Bf and I have been here before for drinks, but haven't tried the tapas. 

It's my sister's birthday which means \"drunk time\", so we started off with three pitchers of sangria, $24 each. Two sparkling and one white. 2/3 of each pitcher was mostly ice cubes. Lucky for Firefly, the sangria made us all tipsy so I let this go.

Tasty dishes and we were having fun trying each one. We had two waiters, one who keeps refilling our glasses (I liked that he's keeping us consistently buzzed) and one who brings/clears away our dishes. Great service!!

Tapas ordered:
Ahi Tuna Skewer
Terra y Mare
Empanada
Stuffed Chicken Mushrooms
Steak Skewers
Thai Beef Salad
Petite Filet
Crispy Duck Roll - none of us liked this

Food - 4 stars: overall good food
Service - 5 stars
Parking - lot is shared with other businesses in the plaza, we were happy to find two spots on a Friday night.
Restroom - 3 stars
Wait - No wait, made reservation on opentable.com

I gave Firefly five stars because we had such a great experience from start to finish. Our waiter surprised my sister with a birthday flan with a candle. Aww, you guys rock!!"}
{"text":"We went with a group of four and it was worth the short trip over! We split a few Tapas and then shared the Mixed Paella. The price was incredible, especially considering we were only a 10 minute walk away from the strip. $100, including tip, for 4 people, including drinks! Doesn't get any better than that. We have already suggested it to others and we will be back next time we are in the desert!"}
{"text":"Worth going out of the way for!  Food is excellent and comes out very fast.  Try the flavored mojitos.  You won't b disappointed."}
{"text":"Vegas peeps who are paying way too much for subpar food on the strip, this is the place you need to come.  Great food from a chef who helped start mon ami gabi.  Tapas were fantastic as was the sangria, which they marinate for three days to really meld the flavors.  Its not really walkable from anywhere but it isn't a far cab ride either.

Edit: Although this was posted on 5/5, I ate there a few months ago...looks like they are having sanitation problems and were/are temporarily closed http://tinyurl.com/bvdtw74"}
{"text":"My girls and I, after a long night of work,love to hit up Firefly! Such a good happy hour! The red sangria is my favorite, we always get a pitcher! (Okay maybe two) At night we don't want something too heavy so we love the tapas idea! MY Faves are the bacon wrapped dates, stuffed mushrooms, STUFFED PEPPERS, and the manchengo Mac and cheese is a guilty pleasure! The ambience in here is great, I feel like someone is about to bust into the room and start dancing salsa! The waiter that serves us I'm so mad I forgot his name but you can't miss him he looks like a Telenovela superstar! Just yum! (Wait the food, the food is yum) Overall love it here!"}
{"text":"Incredible, try the sliders, ham and cheese crouquetes, stuffed dates, and anything else that looks interesting to you, can't go wrong.  The mojitos are delicious too and come by the pitcher if you want.  Just a great fun delicious place and for the prices you can't go wrong.  Every one I have ever taken here loves it and I have taken more than a few."}
{"text":"Firefly has definitely earned my business.  I can't wait to come back to Vegas to sample more of their delicious tapas.  The sangria was so tasty, I could have downed the entire pitcher by myself if my friends weren't looking.  The chef uses fresh, quality ingredients; you can see it reflected in the dishes.  The food was so good, we had to order a second order for most of them.  We sat at the bar and the waitress was so attentive and the food didn't take long to come out even though it was a packed house.  I've tried so many other restaurants in Vegas, 3 to 5 stars and all, some costing an arm and a leg and never have I left Vegas thinking about the food... But this time, WOW, Firefly definitely blew my socks off!!!  I was so impressed with the food and the price.  I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"This place is beyond jaw dropping because of it's amazing food.
Every time I come to Vegas this is a place which is a must!"}
{"text":"A friend of mine that used to live in Vegas highly recommended this place to us and boy did it not disappoint!! We ordered a pitcher of Sangria and it was absolutely amazing. Then we followed that up with two plates per person and split them all. We could have easily tuned that down a bit but all the food was super delicious!!"}
{"text":"As a chef who has worked for a tapas restaurant before I use say that Firefly reminded me how much I love this concept.  The food and drinks were amazing and the service was pretty much the same. A little slow at points in removing dirty plates but to me that is only a small thing.

My wife and I had a strawberry mojito and a watermelon mojito which we very flavorful and delicious. 

For food we had:

Manchego and Serrano plate 5 stars
Bacon Wrapped Dates 5 stars
Pulpy Asado 4 stars
Firefly fries 4 stars
Tomato bread with Manchego 5 stars
Manchego Mac n Cheese 5 stars
Lobster escargot 4.5 stars
Albondigas 4 stars
Filet Sliders 5 stars

Dessert
Flan 5 stars
Tres Leche Cake 5 stars
Bead pudding 4.5 stars
Banana and nutella sandwich 4.5 stars

Great food, great drink, nice environment. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"YES to firefly!! I lived in vegas for a year, but did not discover this place until I visited this past weekend.  Great food at a great price.  Excellent sangria to start of the meal.  Then we ordered an assemblage of plates that tickled the palate to the maximum.  The best dishes of the night were bacon wrapped dates (we ordered 4 of them), the diablo shrimp (sauce was amazing), paella (juicy rice with good mixture of meat and seafood), and the fall off the bone short ribs (tender to perfection).  Overall I would definitely come back here and bring a big group to sample all the dishes!! It is definitely worth the drive off the strip!!"}
{"text":"Amazing tapas with a great late night happy hour. A little bit away from the strip but nice environment to get away from the tourists."}
{"text":"Terrible service from the two hosts at the front desk. They let FOUR other two-person pairs get a table before we did, and we arrived FIRST. It got frustrating to the point where I decided to directly confront the Host staff, and refused to step out of the way (i'm intentionally making them uncomfortable) until she made it certain that we are getting our table NEXT. 

Insanely expensive tapas for portions the size of little niblets. At least Sammy's Woodfired has tapas that are considerably larger, two of which can add up to a meal. 

But between me and my brother, we needed around 8 or so shared between us to get full. With a humungous freaking bill totalling over $70 before tips. 

At least our actual server for our table is fairly fast on his feet and competent. Both of us tipped him while specifically telling him not to pool his share to the Hosts. 

Oh, and this is not the same location as the 2nd one on Paradise, which is all the hoopla about the food poisoning outbreaks and restaurant closure by the health department (read the Review Journal). And as far as I can tell, me and my brother never got sick from our one and only time coming here. 

Watch out for the drivers in this side of town in the establishment's parking lot. The locals don't care if they hit your car or run over your infant toddler, since they got plenty of dough to hire their lawyer and fix up their Mercedes while suing you all the way to a homeless shelter. 

In fact, I would say that as a poor person, I wouldn't ever want to be taking my own car to Summerlin and definitely not a place as trendy as Firefly. The locals on this side of town make running over \"peons\" like a GTA video game."}
{"text":"I'm so upset with myself that I haven't reviewed this earlier when all the food I had was still fresh in my mind. What I do remember is that the prefixed menu of about six course I believe was only about $80.. And on top of that the plates are unlimited! Say what??! I know, I still am trying to fully grasp that idea myself. For prefixed menu this is an amazing deal, let alone for unlimited plates. Also unlimited sangria/drinks included! I don't remember if it's just sangria/mojitos, or if other cocktails are included. I'm pretty sure they were. 

The food was pretty good as well. I remember the scallops being delicious. We had sliders included and I only ate half of mine because I don't really like sliders and it tasted like a normal slider you would get at a TGIF. Mussels and the spicy beef salad were very good, I definitely recommend those. We only used the unlimited plate option for a couple items split between 11 girls and by the time our last two plates came we were so full. We ended up wasting a lot of food because we couldn't take leftovers with us as we were having a night out and didn't have time to go back to our hotel. 

I definitely recommend this place for group outings."}
{"text":"I went here with a friend. We were a little apprehensive at first in light of the recent history.  Their menu is quite amazing.  We ordered a lot of small dishes including Serrano Ham and Manchego Cheese, Padron Peppers and Firefly fish sticks and several additional dishes.  We were both impressed and satisfied with our meal.  We are both looking forward to our return."}
{"text":"***** Apple monchego salad: amazingly refreshing and nicely balanced

***** chocokate and cherry bread pudding: next level of happiness achieved.

**** starter bread and butter: holy moly, best free appetizer ever

**** steamed mussels: the curry makes it great. Hope u saved some bread

*** boquerones: if u like anchovies,  this offers a nice few bites. Goes well with the roasted peppers. 

*** red wine sangrias: stiff drinks but not mind blowing by any means. Just a solid drink with ur meal

*** sliders: really salty, too much bread, but the quality of the meat saves it.

** empanada: overdose of sour cream, not impressive.

***** service was quick. Food came out in a timely manner. Very pleased.


Im freaking well fed and can barely breathe after this meal. Amazing."}
{"text":"One of my boyfriend's favorite restaurants when he visits Vegas so we decided to leave our group and have a romantic dinner for two.  When we arrived it was pretty full already and I would recommend making a reservation if you have a larger party for sure on the weekends.  This is a small plates/tapas syle restaurant.  We were able to sit at a high top in the bat, which was perfecr for the two of us.  We ordered a few smalle plates and only the chicago style bocadillo beef dip sandwich really wowed us.  We ended up sending the grilled octopus back as it was very chewy.  We did order a pitcher of their famous sangria but it took forever for it to be made and we were right next to the bar.  I think it was an off night bc our server was definitely new and it was so loud we had to repeat ourselves several times to ensure she heard us correctly."}
{"text":"Great place!  Tasty food, fast service, this is a great place to get off the strip for a quality meal."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Enough for easily three people to share! We stopped here on a whim and were blown away by atmosphere and food. The portions are tasty and filling. We tried four small plates and the main entree of rice, chicken , mushrooms, veggies. That plate took forty minutes to make but the others started coming out quick and hot. We were starting to get full when the main dish came out! Great place I will be back!"}
{"text":"After going to the other Firefly a couple of years ago (the one on Paradise), we decided to try the one in Downtown this time.   We found this new location to be fantastic. The bar area is a great spot to quaff some Sangria before being seated for dinner.  From our dinner table we enjoyed the view of downtown.   We enjoyed the ambiance of this location very much.

Our favorite food and drink items there:  red sangria (three pitchers for 4 people; I think we liked it),  the ahi tuna skewers (yum!), the camarones diabla (great flavor, but would have liked some more shrimp for the price), and the ham and cheese croquetas (these were *amazing* albeit pricey for what ya get).  

The ceviche was good, but they need to serve good quality tortilla chips with it rather than their very blah large round tortilla...Tostitos would have tasted better than the tortilla they served with it.

Empanadas were enjoyed by half of us.  

The Filet Sliders and the Albondigas were fine, as was the Mac N Cheese.

The Thai Beef Salad needs more spicy marinade to be really good....it should be doused in spicy sauce (I hope the chef/manager is reading this :) ). 

And they threw in a birthday flan for the birthday girl.

$150  for four people including alcohol (excl. tax & tip); we had a great time, loved the atmosphere, and enjoyed most of the food.   We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I used to love Firefly, but unfortunately it is nothing like what it used to be.   The big disappointment over the years has been the change of the atmosphere.

The first Firefly we went to many years back was in downtown Vegas.  Although the seating was nothing special, the great view of the old casinos and the light show made for a very cool atmosphere.

The second Firefly we went to was at their PREVIOUS/smaller Paradise location.   That one had some cool seating with couches and what not, giving that a very cool atmosphere as well.

Suffice to say that when we were seated at their CURRENT Paradise location, it was a bit of a letdown.   The atmosphere is completely missing in this larger location of theirs on Paradise.   They tried to give it some atmosphere with the candles and red hue, but the space is just too big and open for sit down tables for that to work well.   

The red pitchers of Sangria are still delicious and well worth the $28.     

The tapas don't seem to stand out to me as they used to; they were all good, but nothing really stuck out as being delicious.

The old Fireflys used to be something we would visit every time we would go to Vegas.   With this latest experience, things have changed."}
{"text":"Not to be confused with the Firefly Lounge in Studio City, CA.  Firefly in Las Vegas is a nice place. Went to the city of sin for a business dinner and came back a few hours later. Firefly was a good choice. The tapas our group had were the tilapia, the spanish tortilla, the pork empanadas, the tuna tartar, and I believe the chicken skewers. Didn't have any drinks that night, so I can't rate the sangria or the mojitos. The food, however, was pretty good. 

Nice decor. Good staff. Would recommend !"}
{"text":"Fan of Firefly! I love the stuffed dates, mac and cheese, firefly fries, and kobe sliders. I could live off those 4 items at firefly, but it's always fun to try new things because the prices are good and portions are small, so if you don't like it it won't turn into a ruined meal and also won't break the bank. We came on a week night around 730 and the place was still really busy, the nba finals was on in the bar and the place was a little rowdy, but that's fine. I like festive places!
The place is always consistent with it's food offerings, but it does seem to me that portions are getting a tiny bit smaller, the firefly fries used to come in a huge bowl, and this time it wasn't near as big. The mac and cheese used to seem bigger, but maybe that's just me, it was barely enough for two of us to share.

The bill here is always much lower than we expect, and that's including a few drinks, and always seems to surprise us! 
Firefly will continue to be a fun place to go when company is in town, my mother loves this place!
4 solid stars"}
{"text":"I love this place, great food with nice decor.  We ordered probably 10 tapas plus Paella.  The Tuna Tartare, Stuffed Dates, Camarones A La Diabla, Mushroom Tart...everything we ordered were  delicious.  Their Sangria was also pretty amazing.  I also feel fresh since it is off the strip, not those typical casino restaurants.  I will definitely go back to try more different dishes."}
{"text":"The menu is expansive and delicious! Lotsa choice and everything I have tasted was spectacular-- wine is very fair priced and the servers are quite knowledgable when it comes to wines!  In definitely going to return here!"}
{"text":"Words cannot express how much I absolutely LOVE this place. I could eat everything off the menu and I'm pretty sure I will one day. The atmosphere, though a little loud, is quite coozy. 

If and when you go, get the mushroom tart. SO DELICIOUS and make sure you have plenty of napkins ready when you start glancing over the dessert menu, because you will drool a little, guaranteed. While on the topic of dessert, the chocolate cherry bread pudding is to.die.for. 

So in conclusion, amazing little snackies with mouthwatering desserts. AND GO!!"}
{"text":"Summary: Food is crazy good! Service is fast! Environment isn't too bad either.

Food:  Are you kidding me? Literally everything that comes out of this kitchen is great! Great attention to detail. 

Service: Pretty good service. Nothing extremely unusual about the service, except that it is fast!

Environment: Environment is alright. It hasn't been consistent the two times that I've been so I can't comment too much. 

This place is getting a 5 star because the food is unreal!"}
{"text":"Definitely a tummy pleaser ! Firefly has yet to disappoint me on my birthdays or even just group gatherings with friends. Besides the delicious tapas, the ambience is set to perfection . It reminds you being at a family get together plus the music on Latin nights makes you want to dance the entire time ."}
{"text":"I've been there only once, and that was as part of a group luncheon.

But, the food was terrific and the service was even better.

There was a total of six folks in our little group, and everything was so perfect, I picked up the check for everyone.

Few places make THAT kind of favorable impression on me."}
{"text":"Friendly and patient staff. Very quick to deliver. We came with a big group and the service was great. All the plates were very flavourful. You've gotta try the bacon-wrapped dates! Great tasting and loaded drinks too. Love their 2 for 1 happy hour, the sangria is especially good. Well worth the drive off the strip and more interesting food and better prices than the hotel buffets."}
{"text":"There are certain things you have to do when you go to Vegas.. Drink, party, gamble and eat at firefly. We come all the way from Australia and everytime we get here we make sure to book in a time to enjoy a decent meal with a nice range of tapas and a decent drinks list to go with it. On the busy nights I'd definitely recommend booking but allow a few hours to relax and enjoy here!
I always get the prawn dish something a la diabla, bacon wrapped dates, french fries, anchovies and avo toast, Apple mânchego salad. It's just always so good"}
{"text":"Didn't review when I ate there and felt ill. Who knows? I might have been sliding downhill before I went to dinner...so I didn't want to unfairly hang it on them. But now...hmmm. I am sure they will undergo a thorough review before they reopen."}
{"text":"I haven't been to such a nice restaurant . The food is quick to get to yourtable and the waiters are active, quick to clear the table, the bread and butter keeps coming. Me and my fiancee will continue to show up here . It wasn't to full but the overall service was great. The bar seems like a cool way to head if you like that type of thing. Will return soon"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The food was spectacular and the service was above average. Our food started coming within a few minutes. I have been wanting to try a Tapas place but there are none where I live. So if you're in Vegas this place is a must go....I tried 6 different things and all were great. Our waiter was Danny and he was very helpful and knew the menu thoroughly."}
{"text":"I like the atmosphere almost as much as the small plates. It's busy and lively, and the waitstaff are helpful and friendly without being overly familiar or intrusive. The food is fantastic! We tried 5 dishes and loved them all."}
{"text":"My first time eating at this restaurant and it was a good experience. If you are planning in going on a friday evening and you don't want to wait for a table for a long time make a reservation. The food was good. The tapas that I recommend are: the chorizo clams, stuffed dates wraped in bacon, baby back ribs, and lamb chops. The pitcher of red sangria was refreshing and very good. My son is Vegan and he had the tomato bread and the veggies and lentils. The coconut sorbet ice cream they had that day was out of this world. I also recommend the banana sandwich with nutela for dessert. I did not like the scalops escargot, pulpo asado, and the ceviche of shrimp. The service was very good and efficient. As soon as you are done with your tapas the servers clear the plates off the table. Selfparking is behind the building and it was full on that friday night so I had to use valet which is awesome that is free of charge. So I gave the valet $5 in and $5 out. I will go back again for sure and if I have guest visiting I would definitely bring them to this restaurant."}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite place to eat in Las Vegas!! It is usually pretty busy, especially on Fri and Sat nights but it is worth any wait time, without question.  The stuffed dates are excellent and the mac & cheese is heaven.  If you come to Las Vegas I HIGHLY Recommend you put The Firefly on your list of must visits!"}
{"text":"After almost getting smashed twice in the tight parking lot by circling minivans, we made it into Firefly.
I'm a Tapas gal from way back, and El Farol in Santa Fe New Mexico is one of my all time favorite haunts!
The ambience here is a bit crushed, but cordial waitstaff showed us to our table, and even allowed us to pick our table.  We chose the window, since this lively lounge is very crowded and noisy.  Enjoyed the colorful version of Guernica on the wall!
Fabulous service, but I always find a smile works to break the ice, and the considerate waitress even advised me to order my drinks quick, since Happy Hour was about to end!  Two Sangrias in hand, I then perused the menu.  The white wine with aples and other fruits is light and refreshing and two for one definately made them worthwhile.
Thank you fellow yelpers, for helping with decision time!  The bacon wrapped dates are todiefor!  Also the pork empanadas, would brave rampant minivans for one anytime!  Beef sliders went down with  no fuss!  The best ending was the Tres Leches Chocolate cake...like a cool cocoa with whipped  cream!  Hearty and soulful at the same time."}
{"text":"With over a thousand reviews and a 4.5 rating, Firefly was on my list of places to try in Vegas! 

We had a party of five and we were pretty hungry! I love tapas because it gives us the opportunity to try multiple dishes and share rather than chowing down one large plate of burger and fries. I love trying different dishes!

The dishes we had were good. Some dishes were better than others. Here's what we ordered (between $4-$9 a plate):

- Apple and manchego salad. So fresh and so good! This plate was rather larger than the others. The apples were super crunchy and sweet!
- Roasted baby beet salad. YUM!
- Stuffed dates. Super yummy! Love the crumbled blue cheese.
- Veggie empanada. This was just ok. Too doughy for me and not enough veggies and cheese!
- Firefly fries. It was good but I thought it could use more herbs and aioli.
- Manchego mac and cheese. Yum! Thank goodness we shared otherwise I would have felt super guilty eating the whole plate!
- Baked tilapia. Thumbs up!
- Ahi tuna skewer. Super fresh and flavorful.
- Ham and cheese croquets. Super good! 
- Camarones a la diabla. The BEST! The diabla sauce was well made. I used my break and fries to soak up the sauce. It was THAT good!

Let's not forget the bread, olives and butter they bring out to you when you are seated. So good! The butter is some herb/spicy butter. I've never loved butter before until now, lol.

Everyone raved about the Sangria. It was nothing special to be honest. I've had better sangria elsewhere but I'm glad we tried it.

The restaurant is super close to Harrahs. We could have walked here but it was raining and way dark out since we came late. It's really dark inside but most tapas are. We didn't even have to wait, walked in and they immediately sat us. The staff were all super friendly and nice. Service was quick, thank goodness since I was starving!

I will definitely come back to Firefly and try the other items. I won't be ordering the sangria though!"}
{"text":"We came here in the middle of our trip, it's a little off the strip ($8-10) cab ride, and completely worth it, especially for the money you'll save. Great food, quick service, reasonable wine list unlike the rest of the city, and a good time. Since most people go to vegas in groups, it's great to go w/a bunch of people and order everything that sounds good. 

Tapas style, so small plates that are for sharing. 

Stuffed dates, fishsticks, lentils, stuffed mushrooms, manchego mac n cheese, and on and on. Delicious."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for a very long time & I could actually say it's okay for the price you are paying, but then again they specialize in tapas. The reason I gave them 3 stars was because they have an amazing red sangria and that I cannot deny. Service is always good, but just be prepare to wait for a table for a very long time on some occasions."}
{"text":"I heart this place! On our last trip to Vegas we needed a place that would be delicious, parent friendly, and not in a casino. I found Firefly on Yelp! and made a reservation on line (so convenient for those of us that dislike telephones). When we showed up around 10p on a Saturday night it looked like a night club with how many pretty people were lined up outside. I was a little nervous that perhaps me and my crew were a little too ahem...mature to have a nice time. I was so wrong. 

I went to the hostess station where I was greeted with a big smile. I told them that we had a reservation and they said - oh, you must be betsy. why...yes, i am. I was really impressed that they were ready for us on a busy Saturday night. That all pales in comparison to how impressed I was with the food though. 

We read over the menu while enjoying a pitcher of very tasty sangria. We ended up choosing some garlic shrimp, muscles, the mushroom tartletts, some thing with a sardine on it, and several other things. Everything was delicious and was presented beautifully. There were some things that I wasn't crazy about - but all of those things contain foods (like sardines) that in general I wouldn't eat unless a little tipsy. 

The waiter and other staff were very attentive and despite the club like atmosphere we felt right at home here. I would recommend this place to anyone and look forward to returning on my next visit to Vegas."}
{"text":"Awesome lil tapas place! Good tapas and great service. In the same parking lot as la quinta!"}
{"text":"This place was pretty awesome! I have to go to LV for work each week and one of my sales reps took us here because I said drinks and happy hour apps were on me.  Well,,,,,, I am so happy he picked this place.  It beats any of the stuffy hotel restaurants I have been going to during my stays.  

The red wine sangria is soooo yummy and even better when they serve it in pitchers.  We had a ton of their tapas and three pitchers and the price was so reasonable.  I was ecstatic. We sat at the bar and the bartender was pleasant and very helpful. 

The sliders were super tasty along with the calamari and the tuna tar tare thing.  Yummy.  We had so much stuff along with a complementary tapas sampler that was very good.  

I know want to come back here every time I am out in LV for work."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm in Vegas I always try to make time to come to Firefly.  This newer location is great with lots of seating and dark, nice decor.  Great Spanish tapas at reasonable prices, right off the strip.  A few of my favorites are the stuffed dates (2 orders please), patatas bravas, empanadas, ham and cheese croquetas.  Sangria is a must!  Early and late HH has some nice selection tapas for less and of course great deals on the sangria.  Come early or late, or you'll probably be waiting for a long time.  Always a fun time at Firefly!"}
{"text":"Came here and tried a few things my favorites were the garlic shrimp, stuffed dates, filet mignon sliders and the firefly fries. I also tried the duck, chorizo mussles and the enpanadas those were good but nothing to rave about. The white sangria was okay nothing special.
Finished off with flan and nutella sandwich, the flan was to die for.
This place its really cozy great for a date or a night out with friends. The service was superb."}
{"text":"As a first time trier at a Spanish Tapas Restaurant, I thought this restaurant was better than I thought! The portions were reasonable, but a bit pricey to me. However, the quality of the food was good! I wasn't much of a fan of the mac and cheese we ordered, but the bacon wrapped dates were so good and I don't usually like dates!

If you order the paella, it takes 40 min, but if you order a bunch of tapas, it won't seem long because the tapas come quick and in the meantime while you eat them, your paella will be ready!

As for service, they really do a good job filling your glass of water and taking away your plates!"}
{"text":"Great Vegas stop for locals AND out-of-towners!!! 

My bf and I decided to stop by here during our latest visit.  

Here's the deal:

- tapas style restaurant..ie small plates
- price ranged from $4-10
- sit @ the bar for the free sampler [includes 3 items--meatball, an egg/fritata thing, and bacon wrapped date]
- get a pitcher of sangria...totally worth it if you are up for a paaaartaay!
- bacon wrapped dates are the bomb.com
- all the skewers were delish
- less than 5 minutes from the strip

highly recommended if you're tired of buffets & fast food on the strip =]"}
{"text":"Great tapas good mix of locals and tourist always busy I would recommend the sangria or diablo shrimp"}
{"text":"If you are like me, every time you go to a restaurant and take a look at the menu you wish you can be gluttonous and order everything on the menu because you either can't narrow it down to just one dish or you just want a little taste of everything. Look no further....Firefly is just the remedy if ever you are in that situation. A Tapas restaurant and favorite local hangout, Firefly's atmosphere is just as cool as it's food!! My favorites are the Surf and Turf Skewers, Tuna Tartar, Baked Brie, Crab-cake Sliders and of course the Sangria!! If you are looking for great, inexpensive food, awesome atmosphere that is open late and even has happy hour....Firefly is definitely for you!!"}
{"text":"Truth be told, I was disappointed in Firefly on Paradise.  The place is always packed, and the smells from the outstanding were amazing, but the eating experienced left a lot to be desired.  I had a hard time even getting a table - tried a couple of days - and then I was seated but only outside in a corner.  Waiting times for service were longish, and then a couple of dishes I was served were obviously made ahead of time and heated at the last minute, and the inside of the food was still cold.  The dishes were modern yuppy fusion and not traditional.  All in all, there is a lot of flash and not a lot of substance.  I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"The filet mignon sliders are the best!
The atmosphere was a little too busy and noisy for the couple we were dining with, but to be expected in this little hot spot not far from the strip. Shaded outdoor seating is available as well although we chose to dine indoors (our friends visiting from the SF Bay Area thought 85 degrees was much too hot to be eating outside!) The food is good and reasonably priced. I've been here for lunch several times, and it is not as crowded as the dinner group, but still quite busy. Our server was attentive and knew the menu well enough to make some good suggestions. He was also happy to take a couple of pictures of us at our table before we dug into the tapas which began arriving quite quickly once our order was placed :-)"}
{"text":"Perfect for a girls night out or meeting with another couple. Low key on weeknights and lunch can be crowded Friday and Saturday nights.Firefly has both red and white Sangria, which are both good. My favorites are the Mojitos by the pitcher, bacon wrapped dates and apple salad. Calamari is good with a group, it has a bigger portion."}
{"text":"most devine sangria! And their so *healthy* tapas are so delcious OMG i am getting my panties in a bunch just thinking of them!"}
{"text":"Do not waste your time or money in this place.  The worst service i have experienced in as long as i can remember.

I must adjust my review. While the service i received was well below expectations,   That was possibly the individual.

The food i received was very good and certainly deserves 4 Stars.

I feel certain,  they will correct this oversite."}
{"text":"The tapas here are moderately priced and very good! The service is fast. It is a very cool place to just hang out and get a drink also. On weekend nights, you should call ahead to make a reservation, as the wait may get quite long. There seems to be a lot of locals who go here. I was shown this place by a friend who lives in Vegas and have loved it ever since. I try to go here every time I'm in LV. Last time I was here for dinner.. my friends and I ordered a bunch of tapas and  the bill came out to be about $20 per person. The paella was not bad but it's an entree, not a tapas plate. The garlic fries are very good, tapas priced, but comes in a big bowl. The other things that I ordered were the empanadas, thai beef salad, croquettas, and meat skewers. I can't remember what else i had, but it was all very good. I highly recommend this place to everyone. The mushroom pastry was EXCELLENT!"}
{"text":"I ordered 4 different tapas plates and they all were delicious. Scallops were well cooked and all the sauces were good. Artichoke bread was really a nice surprise, well seasoned and topped with basil which just complements the dish well. Only thing was that's the food came out slightly delayed, too far from one dish to another but granted, it was very busy night. I will be coming back!!"}
{"text":"Great sangria (the red one especially), delicious paella (though it takes a while to be cooked), and unforgettable tapas..."}
{"text":"A very busy place where everyone in Vegas seems to hang out. The food it's a bad imitation of Spanish food (tapas) . If you don't know much about the real taste and quality of paella, tapas and sangria then you might not see a difference.

The service its great, the bartenders are nice so if you get yourself to seat at the bar you will at least enjoy their amazing company.

Try croquetas de jamon, probably the best thing in here."}
{"text":"Sexy modern Spanish tapas restaurant not far off the strip. Great place to slow down and enjoy the company of a group of friends or that one special friend. Wide variety of tasty tapas. You won't find chicken fingers or nachos on the menu, so if you don't know tapas look it up. The empanadas are excellent. Friendly attentive servers."}
{"text":"Having been a regular to Firefly's other location on Paradise, I found this additional location a treat and conveniently located near my office. The menu does not disappoint with its variety of delicious small dishes...be careful as your table will go crazy ordering different delightful temptations...tapas is intended to be shared! 

Some of the favorites that stand out include the curry chicken salad, the fresh ceviche and filet mignon sliders...(I'm getting hungry just writing this!) Many of the dishes are created daily in the restaurant to maintain the authenticity of the dishes. 

You will certainly be tempted with their \"adult beverages\" like their house-specialty Sangrias. They are marinated for three days and provide the perfect accompaniment to your meal. Try their delicious and fresh mojitos, brews on tap, and other signature cocktails."}
{"text":"I found this to be an OK venue. It's off the strip, and has parking. Also, it's convenient for getting to Thomas & Mack before or after an event there."}
{"text":"The food is just amazing. We had a party of 20 and the accommodated us last minute. Let me tell you about Ivan our waiter. Such great service and he handled our entire table so fast. We told him our limo was coming in a hour and a half and he responded. Food 5 star. Service 5 star. Drinks 5 star. I'm coming back!"}
{"text":"I ate here last week when I was leaving vegas and it was the best decision I made that week for food. Everything there is super reasonably priced and delicious.

We had the Mac and cheese which was amazing. The filet mignon was delicious too. The ceviche was to die for. The cheese plate was so so. We had chicken skewers which were pretty good. We also had the mango ribs which only half of us like but I really enjoyed them. The scallops were sooooo good. 

I recommend anyone with a big appetite to go share a meal there and try a bunch of stuff.

This is not a place meant to have only one thing."}
{"text":"A local suggested this to me and I can see why!  I loved this place and I will be back next time I am in Vegas.  I was seated right away.  The waiter suggested the stuffed dates.  I was a little leary, but they were awesome!  Everything else was delicious and the prices cannot be beat.  Service was excellent too.  Watch out for the Sangria - delicious, but it sneaks up on you :)"}
{"text":"Okay I've been here enough times now to forgive the credit card incident. Each time I've been back to Firefly the service has been as perfect as the food. Firefly is the first place I recommend to friends visiting Vegas since there's a variety of flavors to choose from and the pricing is very fair. Also what's not to like about pitchers of sangria.. 

New favorite must-order dishes:
Ceviche - LOVE this dish. A simple but refreshing combo of cold shrimp, lime, tomatoes, onion, and avocado served with crispy tortilla strips. 
Mango BBQ ribs - Not something I would usually order but the ribs were extremely tender and the sauce was sweet and savory. Also the portion is huge! So good.

Evenings are their busiest times but each time I've been for lunch there's been no wait!"}
{"text":"I went to this Firefly while staying in downtown Vegas and I didn't like it as much as the other Firefly but I don't know why.  The decor was different but nice and the food was just as good, maybe it was just in an odd spot.  The service was ok and Sangria was YUMMY but took forever to come.  The white Sangria wasn't that good.  You won't be disappointed that is for sure! Just make sure you try the meat empanadas and red sangria.... mmmmm"}
{"text":"I'm so glad my longtime personal friend decided we should eat there because I would have never found this place on my own. For anyone wanting to try something completely different and off the strip, YOU HAVE TO COME HERE! Just forcing myself to keep my language PG because it really is that effing good! Can't wait to come back and introduce this to my LA friends!

Everything we ordered was clearly mouthwatering:
Bacon Wrapped Stuffed Dates
Stuffed Peppers
Albondigas
Chicken & Chorizo Stuffed Mushrooms
Smoked Salmon Toasts
Steamed Mussels

This place gets pretty busy and full. Towards the end of our meal, they forgot one of our orders (spicy lamb sausage), and we told them to just not make it and take it off our bill. I'm glad they ignored our request and told the chefs to rush it. I've never had lamb sausage before so we ordered the Merguez. Unbelievably good. It's not gamey at all. Perfectly cooked and amazingly tender. MUST EAT!

The Mushroom Tart is definitely a bigger dish considering it's still tapas. The pairing is something most people would never consider, mushrooms & puff pastry, yet may often be overlooked!!! MUST EAT!"}
{"text":"I thought this place was great! The restaurant is huge, the lights are dim, and it's super lively (I liked it, but my friends complained that it was too loud). People were dressed anywhere from jeans to cocktail dresses. My group was impressed with the food. Mine was really good, but I'm going 4 stars because I felt like my shrimp (ceviche) and octopus were slightly overcooked. Not the best I've ever had, but it was good. The tapas selection was insane, huge variety and super reasonably priced especially considering how large the plates were."}
{"text":"I love tapas in general for variety, but i felt like out of everything we ordered (grilled octopus, tuna tar tar, cod, skewers, crab cakes) it all tasted like the same sauce of some sort so it got boring fast. The drinks were good though! :)"}
{"text":"Coming off a bad dinner at Wicked Spoon buffet at Cosmo the night before, Firefly made us wonder why anyone goes to the buffets on the Strip. Parking was free and plentiful behind the restaurant, although rush hour traffic made it a bit difficult to get to. We timed our visit to take advantage of the Happy Hour specials and had the inside dining area to ourselves at 5pm on a Wednesday.
 
We started with a beer and a sparkling sangria ($5) which was both strong and sweet! We got several of the $4 tapas specials to sample and share including the wonderful French Fries and some rather standard little Meatballs. The \"must try\" Stuffed Dates were delicious and I am craving that sweet-salty flavor combo now as I type. The blue cheese really makes the dish. The Apple Manchego Salad was light and flavorful and went so well with the other heavier plates.

We saved room for dessert as the Chocolate Tres Leches ($7) stood out to me and the Chocolate Bread Pudding ($7) caught my husband's eye. Both were delicious and he finished the bread pudding, but the Tres Leches cake was definitely meant for a crowd! Mmm, all of that for only $40 plus tax and tip!"}
{"text":"Firefly is an awesome restaurant. The tapas are incredible. The petite filet was awesome as well as the stuffed peppers, the steak salad, the ham & cheese croquettes, the green bean summer salad and the Nutella dessert!!!! The service was incredible. It is a bit loud inside but for a place that has such good food, it's expected. Two thumbs up"}
{"text":"thanks jujuan for taking us here for our first night in Vegas. 
the food was awesome, the service was on point, and we had 6 small plates and 2 cocktails for $60. we were stuffed and couldn't even finish everything. the shrimp ceviche was fresh and yummy. 

best part, all locals there"}
{"text":"Incredible, I annihilated the Chicago Beef Bocadillos and finished off with some coffee and the Gelato Trio. Service was quick and clean. Atmosphere is a definite two thumbs up as well."}
{"text":"Went to a friend's birthday gathering at Firefly's new location on Paradise. Disappointed. Best example was the potatoes brava. They were slimy with a spicy but otherwise flavorless sauce and globs of what seemed like mayo from a jar. A feint shadow of the fabulous potatoes brava at Julian Serrano, which have a gourmet tomato-based sauce and light creamy aioli.

The service was also frustrating. We were in a booth with about eight people. The curtains blocked people on the ends of the table from sight, which meant waiters never bothered to ask us if we wanted anything else. We had to get up from the table and seek out the waiter several times.

This is huge place and in terms of quality this is like the chain restaurant of tapas places. For a little bit more Julian Serrano, in Aria, is orders of magnitude better."}
{"text":"This place was great especially if you want something off the strip but still tasty. I recommend ordering the paella before everything else so that it comes out as you finish with your tapas. The paella was the best that I have had stateside and for $26 we got a steal with the seafood paella. Incredibly cooked and seasoned.

The tuna tartar was amazing, incredibly fresh and if it was just me I would have ordered 2 and would be done with my meal. The scallop escargo, which is basically scallops cooked in the escargo style of heavy butter and garlic was also well done buy I wish the scallops were better.

The music was also great but could be turned up a bit to help drone out the other conversations and because it by itself is very nice. 

The best part is that this place isn't too far from the strip, like one mile off las vegas blvd. So it wasn't crowded but still tasted good. We were full but we weren't vegas buffet style full/dying so we could still go get drinks and gamble without the food coma feeling.

We will be back soon."}
{"text":"So good!!  You have to try the bacon rapped dates. They don't sound like they would be tasty but it's my fav dish there."}
{"text":"A lot of choices. Decent food. The stand out dish was def the bacon wrapped dates. Good spot if you want something off the strip."}
{"text":"I must admit that I was a bit weary to dine here given that they were shut down in the past due to severe food poisoning, but a really good friend wanted to eat here and since it was her celebration and ultimately her decision, I went along with it. Another friend, who was also part of the group that ate with me, came here on her birthday and had nothing but great things to say about this location and she didn't get sick from it then. 

The parking was a bit confusing. Up front they have a valet area and in the back of the restaurant is self park. When entering the lot, there was no indication that the back parking lot is self park. Here is where I got confused--normally the parking in the front is reserved for self park and valet is sectioned off somewhere in the back. So I thought that the back parking was reserved for valet. I decided to valet my car since I couldn't figure out parking and it was just easier for me to drop my car off. When the valet parked my car in front of the restaurant, I thought that was interesting that I valeted my car to have it within walking distance. 

We had reservations already made so we didn't wait at all for our table. Right from the start, our server came by and asked us if we wanted anything to drink and since we were still waiting on one more, we just asked for water for the meantime. We also placed an order of paella since that takes awhile to cook and we thought it wise to get it started. Other dishes ordered were the shrimp ceviche and calamari. We also ordered a pitcher of sangria for the table. 

Reasons for the 3 stars:
-parking could be better indicated for first time guests
-the paella said it could serve 2-4 people. This could be true if more tapas are ordered along with it, but we ordered it as if it was the main dish. When I imagine paella, I think of a big serving of it!
-the shrimp in the ceviche were whole. I'm used to ceviche being cut up in smaller pieces and I've had better ceviche at taquerias
-it wasn't as busy as it could be, but we still had to wait around and ask for our check several minutes after they cleared our table

I would come here again to try other stuff on the menu. Maybe next time with better knowledge of the place I'll have a different experience. For my first time there I would say that it was ok, but it wasn't spectacular."}
{"text":"Great for Tapas and large groups, or any groups for that matter. You can sit at the bar or make reservation for a table (this place is packed!) and try different food options from the menu, most of them are around $5 and very good!. Loved the bacon wrapped dates and mushrooms and the eggplant, heck loved them all! It's a little off the strip so if this is your first trip to Vegas you won't make it here, but if you want to try something else and have some good food and good time absolutely bookmark this one!"}
{"text":"Firefly was fine, but not at all amazing (contrary to its amazingly high yelp rating of 4.5 at the time we came). The sangria was excellent, and my wife got the steak and mushroom skewers and liked them a lot. But everything else we got was ehhhh"}
{"text":"Can't say enough about this place. Amazing food. Great experience. Affordable prices. Excellent drinks.."}
{"text":"Probably should be 3.5 stars but Yelp doesn't allow 1/2 star.

Should be three $$$ instead of $$ since by the time you order enough tapas to be satisfying, you've probably shelled out $30-$35/person.

Interesting dishes. The almond honey butter was amazing. Tiny portion size for the price - one could easily eat 4 $10 tapas and still be not full. $6-12 for 4-6 morsels of food - the scallop escargot ($11) didn't even come with 6 smallish scallops but 3 smallish scallops cut in halves. The mixed seafood paella ($26) has lots of chicken (every other bite) and maybe two clams and two small mussels and lots of rice and little other discernible ingredients.

Loud and lively attractive scene. Not a place for quiet conversations.

Probably worth trying once but for us experience was somewhat underwhelming primarily due to the the stingy portion size. You can tell the tapas were light on costly ingredients which took away from the dining experience."}
{"text":"I really like this place.  I just came back from Barcelona not too long ago, so I was still in the tapas craze, so I was happy to come here.  I like that it's big so it seats a lot of people. The couch style seating is an added touch. There is also a view of Downtown Fremont, and the thermometer that tells me how scorching hot it is outside...even at such late hours.

I love their menu selection. They have all sorts of dishes ranging from seafood to red meat. I ordered the stuffed dates because that was supposed to be one of their signature dishes.  It was good. I like the bacon wrapped around it.  I also had the steamed mussels.  The serving size was adequate, enough for one.  Nothing too memorable about it. I've had better in Australia. The waiter recommended the camarones a la diabla, raving about it and telling me how it's one of the most popular dishes. He raised my expectations a bit too high, because it was definitely just mediocre...a bit on the bland side. It sure could use some added sauce or something.  Finally, I had to try the camarones al ajillo because I was curious to see what the ajillo is since I've seen that word in my travels to South America. That was my favorite dish.  The shrimp were large and flavorful. The sauce had the perfect mix of salt and garlic taste. I dipped my bread in the sauce and had to get the very last bit of it before the waiter took the plate away. Yes, it was that good.

To sum up, I definitely recommend this place. Food is excellent and with tapas, you can sample a variety of dishes before getting full. 

Buen provecho!"}
{"text":"Really good food and excellent service both times we went. I highly recommend this place. It also has excellent atmosphere."}
{"text":"Bacon Wrapped Dates!!!! Magic in ones mouth! Lamb Chops are also amazing, actually everything on the menu is amazing. You have to go with a group because you have to order most of the menu and have a bite of everything!"}
{"text":"HOW RUDEEEE!!!

Came here w/ a couple of friends when they finished work & it was late happy hour. We decided to sit at the bar since that's where it seems like it was POPPIN... we sat at the edge near the well wear we could see all the drinks being made...

The 2 stars is for the food ALWAYS being AWSOME at any Firefly location but honestly your palate gets affected when other things affect your mood such as service.

We were greeted promptly ... we ordered some cocktails & one of the guys ordered a bulleit rye on rocks while my man ordered it w/water. They brought both w/ water. Mind that both our boys are bartenders & love their bourbon & know the flavors. BUT we saw the bartender pour just Bulleit Bourbon & not Bulleit rye... also because the bottle was still sitting on the display. The fact is he had the odosity to come & say we ordered wrong & even though it was our fault he would make a new one. We said forget it...it's fine. The boys decided they wanted one more... & again we were watching as the drink was being made.. he poured the regular Bulleit AGAIN!! Brought it over & said it was rye... UGH! ARE YOU SERIOUS?!?!? 

APPLE & MACHENGO SALAD $3.50 - absolutely refreshing with thin julienne slices of green apple & some cheese w/toasted almonds & lightly dressed.

STUFFED DATES $3.50 - bacon wrapped w/ toasted almond to give a crunch... sprinkled w/ Bleu cheese crumbles & drizzled w/ red wine reduction. A MUST dish whenever you go into firefly!!

FIREFLY FRIES $4 - large bowl of fries thin & crispy w/ seasoning.

Sadly DEFINATELY will not be back to this location..."}
{"text":"When I was 8 years old I was told by my father many things that always made sense to me. Things that stay with me for ages. Shaped who I am. Things like...never buy ducks from man in a hat, or punch anyone in throat who looks at you cross eyed...because of that one I was thrown out of Catholic Boarding school...to be fair...that nun had it coming. He also said to me this...whenever you can buy small plates of food...do it, you can really throw those plates much more accurately when you are mad.  So wise. So wise. Again, because of that one I spent 11 months in a Basque prison. Oh well, I learned how to stamp on grapes and make wine and say \"abajo con los cerdos espanol.\" Overall not too bad.

So when I heard that the beloved FireFly was taking over the horrible restaurant in the Plaza I was thrilled. So happy that I put down my bottle of keyboard cleaner and my rag, stood up, fell down, and stood up again. I waved my weak and jittery arm. The people in the bus moved further away.

Oh, Spain...you may be fascist oppressors, but you invented a damn good drink...Sangria.  The Sangria here is aged 3 days and it tastes out of this world. It really is as good as you will possibly get for the price (24 bucks for a pitcher that would cost you 100 in a club on the strip).  I had the white wine Sangria. Perfection. Bring your own big straw...they don't provide them. Oh well.

We tried 10 plates ranging from 4.50 to 9 bucks. Each one better than the last. The civiche was perfect. Lime juice, red onions and shrimp. Perfect.  The fillet minon was expertly cooked.  We had several others, chicken and chorizo stuffed mushrooms were so amazingly good they should have their own large plate...like a platter...delivered to me by supermodels. The  empanadas were rich and perfectly filled. 

The food is great, but the atmosphere is just excellent. It is fun and casual without being too casual. The round glass room, which you will need reservations, is the best at night. See the lights of Downtown and watch the Freemont Street Experience show every half hour. It fits in so perfectly with the whole Downtown revitalization vibe.  

One star off...the plates, as good as they are could have more on them. They really skimp at times and it makes no sense considering the price tag. Also, the wrong server can blow this experience for you, by being too slow and not knowing the menu. I have had decent servers most times, but once I got a bad one...and believe this...when you hold him down and start pulling out his nose hairs one at a time suddenly YOU'RE the bad guy. This world is so sideways.  Oh well.

Rex speaks. You eat. You do if you know what is good for you. Rex doesn't speak twice."}
{"text":"Our last meal in Sin City, and worth the build up, especially after a week consisting mostly of pampering and partying. 

Much needed when your friends need some space from the blinding lights of the strip. This spot was recommended by some local friends, and we're glad that they have prime taste. Super hip, and not as gimmicky as most tapas places can be these days.

Vegas fall weather is the best weather. so try and grab a table outside. A little vino won't hurt either, it's more Spanish that way."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful!! GREAT food, wonderful prices. A MUST go every VEgas trip."}
{"text":"We came here last time we were in Vegas and loved it, so last weekend when we were in Vegas again we had to come back.  We brought a Vegas resident friend who had never been here before and she loved it too.  It's a very cool place.  Both times we've gone have been during the day, but I can see how this would be a great evening date place, although from other reviews it looks like it gets pretty busy on weekend evenings.  Most of the dishes are small tapas plates so it's a great place to go, order a bunch of different dishes and share with your pals.  Between four of us, we had:

Bread, cheese spread, green olives (free appetizer);
Roasted eggplant cannelloni (with goat cheese and tomato sauce);
Tuna tartare (with mango, marinated ahi tuna, avocado and taro chips);
Manchego mac 'n' cheese (baby shells baked with cheese);
Empanadas (pastry stuffed with roast pork and red pepper, served with salad and aioli);
Chicken and chorizo stuffed mushrooms (we got 2 orders);
Filet mignon sliders (mini burgers with serrano ham, cabrales cheese and caramelized onions) (we got 2 orders);
Crispy duck rolls (with cherry hoisin sauce);
Firefly fish sticks (fillets of grouper, Japanese breadcrumbs and spicy tartar sauce);
Chorizo clams (peppers, two kinds of spicy sausage, white wine, parmesan toasts)

Everything was great, but my favorites were the stuffed mushrooms, duck rolls and chorizo clams.  I guess I'm down for just about anything with chorizo in it.  Not only was the taste of the dishes great, but the presentation was fantastic too.  It's the kind of food you look at and even if you don't like something in it you can't wait to try it because it looks so good.

The price was reasonable, with most tapas dishes costing between $5 to $10 each.  The four of us were stuffed afterwards and the total including tax, tip and drinks came out to about $120.  I'd definitely come back here anytime I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"excellent food, excellent wine selection! staff not very knoweldgeable at times but theyre very nice to make up for it!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!!!  They have the best Mojitos & Sangria.  And every visit the must have items on menu are the Stuffed Dates & Lamb Chops!!!!  Till my next visit......"}
{"text":"Excellent food excellent service excellent atmosphere! I'm super picky and I am super happy with this dining experience!"}
{"text":"Though I'm glad I finally tried this place, I'm not going to be rushing back here. I came here on a Tuesday night and it was super busy and super loud. Not bad if you're looking for a place to hang with a group of 4 or more, but don't expect a cozy dinner for 2.

The one dish I feel is worth mentioning is the stuffed dates with blue cheese and bacon. This is the one dish I'd recommend and order again. The sangria was a little to effervescent for my taste and I think it could use a little more spice. It was pretty weak so don't expect to get a good buzz off of it.

The atmosphere was lively and I'd recommend this place to you if you're looking for a young crowd. The service was decent and the food was too. It's just that nothing stood out to me about this place that I would come back here knowing there's tons of other places to try in Vegas."}
{"text":"Always my go to for special occasions or big groups . Love this place ! The strawberry Mojito is soooo good and the firefly fries and comarones a la diabla ( shrimp diablo) are a must ! The place is cute and the service is good."}
{"text":"Good tapas place off the strip. It's a really short taxi ride/drive from the Wynn end of the strip so don't be afraid to deviate from the main strip. They offer free valet here too so it's convenient if you have a car. 
We went with a fairly large party of 9 and our waiter advised us to just order a few tapas at a time in rounds. They come out fairly fast so you don't have to be afraid of waiting that long. For the most part, he was correct, except our party was pretty hungry and scarfed up every plate almost immediately after they came to the table.... so if your friends are a pack of ravenous dogs like mine, you can order more at a time. 

We ordered:
Mixed Paella (one order is good for about 4-6 people)- nomskies. Legit Spanish cuisine. 
Ahi tartare + avocado- standard dish you can't really go wrong with 
Bacon wrapped stuffed dates- I don't normally care for dates but this was like CRACK. So good. Nice balance of salty and sweet. It's really small though, like 5 dates on a plate and one date per person is not enough  
Fries- good but also forgettable 
Lamb shank? Thigh? I forget which part but it was good. 2 pieces only. 
Mac and cheese- nomskies in all it's creamy goodness 
Stuffed mushrooms- nomskies,  I'd get it again 
Some kind of stewed veggies + egg- meh I'd pass on that one 

I can't remember what else because it just kept getting passed around the table rather quickly. 
My other advice to you would be GET THE RED WINE SANGRIA. It's a little on the sweeter side but I think everyone can appreciate it, even those who don't care for sweeter tasting wine. 

\"Take this all of you and drink it. This is the cup of my blood which will be given onto you and to all so that your sins may be forgiven.\"

If Jesus was talking about the Firefly red wine sangria then I'd be downing that all day and all night... like a mofkn sangria vampire or something. 

Okay that's my advice, you heard it, enjoy your time in Vegas!!! :)"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times in there new location and old. The atmosphere is always busy and loud but makes a good environment for fun with friends or even a first date. The central location is great for pre dinner drinks or food before you go out on the strip. The bacon wrapped dates are a must try! I'm also a big fan of Serrano sliders with crispy onions and bleu cheese. Yum! Order firefly fries on the side and you are in food flavor heaven.if you're a seafood fan I recommend the chorizo clams. I've tried most of the menu and everything is very good. Service is always good."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing! I went with five friends and we each ordered two things off the menu and we also had a pitcher of Sangria. Everything was full of amazing flavor! This place is a must if you're heading out to Vegas. Our check ended up at only $90. Not bad at all. We stayed at the Hard Rock which isn't too far away from this place. Also, our service rocked!"}
{"text":"The original had a bit more character, it was aged and awesome. Locals knew this whole in the wall that was sooo cool and hip. The new place is new, bigger and the food is just as good and on this Tuesday evening it was packed. Yeah for Firefly. I hope they can add more locations again in the future."}
{"text":"Normally I do not review places with so many reviews already that I agree with.  But my Mom and I went, enjoyed our dishes, and my Mom talked about the Sangria for 4 days.  I don't drink, so I have to take her word for it."}
{"text":"1300+ reviews don't lie. This place is quite delicious. 

Why the one star? Because I ate here on Tuesday 4/23 and started having food poisoning symptoms two days later. It's been five days and I'm still in pain and have lost 13 pounds due to so much water loss. I had to visit the ER yesterday for dehydration. After multiple complaints from other patrons, Firefly was shut down today for a health inspection. 

However, this is not the first time I became ill after eating here. A couple years ago, I had their fish sticks and started violently vomiting soon after. After some time, I decided to give this place another chance. Everything was good...until now. 

It's such a shame because Firefly has delicious tapas and drinks. This was my go-to place for a long time. But apparently staff members aren't keeping clean and washing their hands or they're not handling their food properly.

I've already given this place a second chance. A third chance? I highly doubt it. Eat here at your own risk."}
{"text":"Huge fan of the regular tapas and desserts. Tried the brunch today and was so disappointed. Patatas had no flavor, eggs Benedict was dry, mimosa over priced, the home made strawberry jam wasn't just impressive. Will stick to the regular menu."}
{"text":"Any time I go to Vegas, I eat at a Firefly location. I am a sucker for tapas and they do a great job at it. The wait staff really made us feel at home and was very patient with a few members of our party being late. The food is amazing, the drinks well stocked and the atmosphere is sheer fun. 
Looking forward until the next time."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!! The staff is always so nice and I absolutely LOVE the sangria!! I have not found anything that I don't like about this place. When my friends ask me what is a good place to go sit and have drinks Firefly is the first place that come to mind. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!!!"}
{"text":"The greatest food ever! All dishes are super tasty! I had the mussels in coconut sauce, chicken skewers, beef skewers, two order of the sliders, lamb, and a mango mojito! Delicious foods! Great service! This is the second time I have been here when in town. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Always a fav or mine when I am in town. Great food and atmosphere. This time tried the steak and mushroom skewers..OMG soooo yummy!!! Always love the bacon dates and tuna tare tare. Summer salad was light and refreshing."}
{"text":"This place is always packed so I recommend making a reservation. Although its worth the wait if you don't make one too. Their red sangria is so good! But i also like the white, it's refreshing on a warm Vegas day. My fave tapas are the bacon wrapped dates and the tuna peppers, gotta try them if you go!"}
{"text":"It's F*ing dark in here. Sorry, not a fan of dim lighted areas, service sucked, didnt get my food till about 30 mins of sitting down and do not come here for dinner. Portions are small and probably a place just to kick it at"}
{"text":"Okay so I totally get why this place is so popular, its cheap, fast and mostly easy aside form the long waits. We've never waited before as we use opentable for a reservations which takes away the hassle of standing around outside and being hounded by panhandlers. Anyways.. service is pretty tight and the dishes come out really fast so if you're looking to relax while you're dining you'll need to let your server know that you are in no rush. 

While perusing the menu we ordered a whole pitcher of their tasty sangria, a must. If you don't like wine they also have a full bar though their beer selection kind of sucks all the same bottles everyone else serves. Very disappointing. 

The menu is pretty huge with a little something for everyone. Our server recommended 2-4 plates per person though we totally over ordered, 4 plates each was a little to much for the 3 of us. Below is the laundry list of dishes we order along with quick comments. 

+Tomato bread is chewy bread topped with tomatoes though the juice of the tomato along with salt and vinegar has soaked into the bread making it really moist and flavorful. Loved it.

-Artichoke toasts.. to be honest I don't even really remember eating these. I guess that would mean they were just alright. 

+Sausage plate was one of my favorites. Thin slices of various cured Spanish sausages along with mustard, pickles, olives etc.. 

+Tuna tartare was huge and for the price a great value. Super fresh tasting with a light seasoning just enough to enhance the flavor of the fish. Winner winner!  
Stuffed dates are addictive and their bacon wrapped version packs a whole lot flavor into one tiny bite.

-Baked tetilla was alright, melted cheese really. There are better things to order.

+Manchego Mac n cheese was pretty good. Nice and gooey with a decent crust. 

-Thai beef salad was the weakest dish. I'd say its more like Thai light as there really wasn't a whole lot of flavor from the beef or the dressing. I wouldn't order this salad again.

+Pulpo asado, grilled octopus, was slightly chewy but had a decent amount of flavor. 

-Chicken and chorizo stuff mushrooms were insanely hot temperature wise, be warned. I thought they were just okay but probably wouldn't order these again either. 

-Ham and cheese croquetas had a good texture but not as tasty as one might imagine.  They needed dipping sauce.

+Filet mignon sliders were pretty good though I wished that they came out hotter. 

+Baby back ribs were pretty awesome, sticky, porky meaty and satisfying. 

So over all a good time with lots of tasty bites. Definitely great for either a light meal or like we had, a serious tapas feast. Be sure to make your reservations ahead of time!"}
{"text":"Very good but not the best tapas I've ever had.  Actually had good service for a group of 9 and the restaurant was also pretty busy.  Though all the plates we ordered were good nothing stood out to me as fantastic.  The drinks however were fantastic and those were the most memorable of the night.  Especially the espresso martini which was mind blowing.  Location is a little off the strip but not more than a 5 min Uber ride away.  Nice to get away from the Vegas prices but this place is not cheap by any means just more of a bargain than anything on the strip. Would return!"}
{"text":"This place is mmm mmm good. This was my first tapas experience and I loved it. I came here with a couple other people so we were able to order a few things and share them. We got the Mac n cheese, calamari, parmesan fries, and a baked pepper. I didn't try the calamari because I'm not a big seafood person, but everything else was very good, especially the fries. We came in at the beginning of happy hour so we were able to participate in the drink specials which we were also delicious. This place is definitely worth a try, and I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"We decided to go here with our party of 9 people for dinner on a Saturday night and I am so glad we did!!!! We arrived and had about a 30-minute wait which was fine as we just had cocktails at the bar. I tried the infused vodka on the rocks and it was fantastic!!!! When we were seated we ordered a bunch of small plates. We had the following plates:

Apple & Manchego Salad - Great mixture of crunch and flavor
Baked Goat Cheese - AWESOME and so mild in flavor
Ceviche of Shrimp - So flavorful
Veggies and Lentils  - for lentils that lack flavor this dish was packed with flavor

And then we all kind of ordered more for ourselves to share with our dates and I tasted/ordered the following

Tuna Tartare - So fresh and delicious
Manchego Mac 'N' Cheese - WONDERFUL
Petite Filet - one of the best filet's I've had!!! Cooked perfectly!
Chicken Skewers - Flavored so well!

I have to say everyone in our group/party loved every plate of food! Service was also great. One thing I did like is dishes came out randomly which worked out perfect!

I cannot wait to go back the next time we are in Vegas!!!!"}
{"text":"I love tapas foods and drink in here. Also the price not expensive and about the portion is ok. We're been here last night for 2 ppl and we're order 5 menu that enough. And foods come fast too."}
{"text":"We have dined at this Firefly location a number of times and I finally decided to submit a review. On this visit there were 3 of us and we shared a number of hot and cold items. There are several choices of seating. Bar area, dining room and outdoor patio.  The patio has a fireplace and gas heaters. Service was friendly and the food service was timely. The dishes were delivered at different intervals as to the various cooking times. We shared the following: Tuna Tartare, Padron Peppers, Firefly Fries, Chorizo Clams, Albondigas (Meatballs) Steak and Mushroom Skewers and Babyback Ribs. All of the dishes were delicious and perfectly cooked. The Babyback Ribs were served in a Mango BBQ Sauce as noted on the menu. However, the sauce had a tangy bite. We were told the sauce also contained Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce. You may want to verify this before ordering. Since I enjoy heat it was fine for my taste. The food goes great with a pitcher of White Sangria. Cheers!"}
{"text":"All five of our senses are triggered.  Starts with the hearing, sight, and touch; continues with smell and taste.  Having an eye for art, interior design, and food presentation will be a bit of indulging.  With a strong preference for noise to drown out a hectic week, the task can be satisfied within the walls of Firefly.  All of the other senses will just follow.  Allow it... by starting with a Ginger Smash, Island Mojito, or a Pear Ginger Martini at the bar.

For the remaining flavor senses, manipulate them with a cool selection of tapas.  My faves are as listed:

Mushroom Tart - comfy smells appetizing
Seared Tuna - wonderful highly recommended
Calamari - pretty good nice with the sauce
Grilled Octopus - soft good flavor, missing sticky rice hahaaa (no picture included)
Bacon Wrapped Dates - stuffed with an almond WOWtastic!
Baked Cod - good flavor but DRY (get it right next time)
Beet Salad - salty... why?!!! (otherwise healthy)

There were more tapas ordered by others in our group of 11 people.  They had a good flow going with servers delivering them to our table.  Best to make reservations way ahead.  Even with a reservation it took almost 40 minutes to be seated after our reservation time at 8pm.  This restaurant rocks!  Friday night Salsa dancing happens in the side room past the bar.  Didn't try it; just letting people know in case they didn't yet.  Cuz no - not everybody knows everything.  4**** stars even if it was a little chaotic."}
{"text":"Buen Provecho! Deelicious and super busy! Came here with my sister and got in a corner table at the peak of Happy hour. The hostesses were very friendly and quick to seat us. 
The meat skewers, bread and cheese, fried (sauteed?) green peppers, parmesean fries and even the mini bread with garlic butter came out quickly. The kitchen was turning it out! 
The servers and bussers didn't skip a beat with refilling water or even bringing the check. 
Go early if you can. Can be a bit of a wait if you have a party of 4 or more, as we saw when heading out after 630pm. 
All I can say is the food and ambiance was full of life and quite noisy! 
It's in a small complex with other businesses, parking can also be a bit of a challenge."}
{"text":"This was my first time at the new location and it was great! We went for a family get-together and although the table was very small for 4 people, we made it work. I always get a pitcher of sangria to share with the table and it's always amazing, definitely recommend the red wine sangria! All of the tapas are amazing, I can't get enough. To top it off, the atmosphere and staff are so accommodating, helpful and very knowledgeable. My husband has a gluten allergy and they were nice enough to spend time explaining ingredients so he was sure not to have an allergic reaction. We are often limited because of his allergy, however he was still able to enjoy several tapas and even dessert. Great new spot, much bigger and so pretty inside!"}
{"text":"What a turn around they've made. Everything was really good, service was meh but I was concentrating more on the pitchers of sangria haha 
Bacon wrapped dates are a must!
Ahi Tuna Skewers were the perfect little bite, there was pineapple in between each piece of tuna. Great idea! Love some grilled pineapple.
Chorizo stuffed mushrooms weren't my favorite. They tasted like the mushrooms were pre stuffed and frozen. 
Lemon tarts were cute, I just wish it was bigger. Not enough of the tart alittle too much crust.
Flourless cake looked good, my girlfriend said it was delicious !

All in all, everything was great :) but I'll be back for that red sangria !"}
{"text":"This is the saddest I have ever been writing a review on Yelp.  Firefly used to be my favorite restuarant in the city.  The tapas are amazing.  Mini-sirloin burgers to die for.  A mushroom tart to salivate over. Lush sangria.  On my last visit however, we ran across a server who ended up trying to purposefully overcharge us.  Long story short, he got caught, management refunded the amount of the mistake, but refused to do anything else.  I just refuse to give them any more of my money."}
{"text":"I really love firefly!! I've already written a review but I feel the need to write another! 

I went in the other night and received a free pitcher of sangria, complements of the owner for my loyalty! 

The food here is always top notch and I must repeat: the Sangria is so delicious- easily the best Sangria in Vegas, and it's definitely in the top 3 best sangrias I have ever had (and I've had A LOT of Sangria!)

If you're looking for a fun restaurant, with great food, excellent drinks and good service, go to Firefly. It's one of my favorite places in Vegas"}
{"text":"Pretty good tapas, but a total douche-fest. Nothing but fake tittie bitches and Federline-looking losers."}
{"text":"This tapas bar located a little off the strip is another reason why I miss living in Vegas ,this place gets pretty packed and is a good mix of locals and toursist. I have hit up this spot many a night with groups of people to enjoy the ambiance and of course the food. Their sangria is absolutely amazing and is THE way to start of the Firefly experience, some of my favs on the menu are the pork empanadas, the petite filet, the filet mignon sliders AND....the BACON WRAPPED DATES...augghhhh it pains me how good these morsels are because they are so simple. Just give me these and a pitcher of sangria and I'm good to go!"}
{"text":"I have been a fan of Firefly restaurants for several years now but had never been to the original location on Paradise.  Finally made it (apparently it is now the ONLY location) and I was not disappointed.  The ambience is sexy, the drinks are tasty and potent and this is THE original place for tapas!  

Many other restaurants began offering tapas menus following the late 00's economy crash, but nobody does it as well as Firefly!  They offer something for everyone, whether you're a vegetarian or a carnivore, and the food presentation is interesting and unique.  

Basically, tapas style is like ordering appetizers.  But these aren't anything close to your traditional \"loaded potato skins and chicken fingers\" appetizers!  While Firefly does serve more traditional entrees as well, the tapas is where it's at for the ability to sample multiple items.  I can't think of a more fun destination for a night out with a group of friends.  The mojitos and sangria are delicious, as is the food.  And if you are splitting the bill, you can really get a lot of bang for your buck here!"}
{"text":"I was a little worried for this location when they first opened b/c my husband, friends, and I didn't think the food was as good as the Firefly on Paradise.  Being that this Firefly is so close to our house, my husband and I went back to give it a shot during happy hour.

I'm happy to say that months after opening, the food is just as delicious as it is at the other Firefly locations, and they are still always busy!  Definitely make a reservation, and if you can...get there early!  

Little tip...since it's a tapas restaurants, the portions are snack size.  Order just a couple at a time so the food stays hot and you can stop when you're full.  And check them out during a happy hour.  All drinks are half off including pitchers!

We especially love the Blood Orange Mojitos, any of the Sangrias, the Steak and Mushroom Skewers, the Mussels, the Clams (are BOSS!), the Empanadas, the Albondigas, and the Mac n Cheese is great here too.  Really anything you order from here will be awesome!  Oh and for dessert, be sure to try the Banana Nutella and the Bread Pudding!  YUM!"}
{"text":"This is absolutely one of my favorite eaterys in VEGAS!
Such a fave that it is where I had my Dirty 30 b-day dinner!
We absolutely had the awesome tapas like bacon covered dates, steak skewers, sangrias, etc.
Also we had the nutella + banana sammies for dessert, along w/ flan and tres leches.
Although there was a mixup of the selected menu I faxed over, the spot was pretty accomodating.  And I believe everyone, all 30 of us, enjoyed the tapas dinner...not topless! ;) hee2
YaY!"}
{"text":"We came in without a reservation and got a nice table on the patio immediately. To start we got the firefly fries.The Aioli that's served with them is delicous and a must try! We also tried the Tierra y mar, baked tetilla, Manchego mac n cheese, stuffed dates, artichoke toast, Camarones a la diabla, and the big bowl salad with grilled chicken. Everything was amazing and was served pretty quickly even though it seems a little busier tonight. The waiter suggested the dates which we loved and can whe why they're one of the more popular dishes. I can't wait to come back this summer and enjoy dinner on the patio again. As a side note, Jonathan, the manager, truly took my dinner to another level. His level of service and care for our experiemcewas on another level. He was attentive, caring, professional, and personable and I can't wait to go back; solely because of him."}
{"text":"I love this place! I've been to this place many times but their service is consistent as well as their food.  
Great food and great service!  
I had tuna tartare, shrimp ceviche and spicy beef salad.  Their dessert was great too."}
{"text":"Solid tapas place just outside of the Las Vegas Blvd insanity."}
{"text":"Delicious sangrias, and a very creative tapas menu, everyone we told about Firefly said it was their favorite place! From the The cab attendant at the hotel, to the cabbie, everyone raved about it, this is definitely a much loved which even the locals enjoy. It's a nice looking restaurant, not over the top like most other places in Vegas, service was friendly and the food was excellent.

We tried:
- Artichoke toasts
- Stuffed Dates
- Roasted Veggies
- Patapas Bravas
- Empanadas
- Steak & Mushroom Skewers
- Ham & Cheese Croquetes

Everything was delicious, the only one we didn't care for was the Baked Tetilla (Chorizo & cheese fondue) but everything else was excellent. I would love to go back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Not bad but bring your appetite. Reservation via OpenTable is recommended but do go back to the lady seating ppl when your reservation time is due because it gets busy and she might forget.  Paella was big and really good.  All the recommendations on Yelp were good as promised, including grilled octopus.  Full bar so order your heart out but be prepared to expect no conversation- the place is loud and at dinner time there are lots of people.  Still worth it - dinner for with Mixed Paella $76 (3 tapas, dessert, 2 coffees and a drink)."}
{"text":"Paella was over seasoned. Staff was so rude staring with the hostess and the waitress. Price was good. But I won't come back."}
{"text":"Please bring Firefly to Atlanta! The tapas here were the best I've had. EVERY SINGLE  item that we tried was a perfect 10!  The mushroom tart was my favorite, it was to-die-for! The petit filet was the second runner up. The tapas are a pretty nice size, my husband and I ordered a total of 4 and we were completely stuffed by the time the last plate came out. Our server was s bit forgetful, but really and upbeat. Overall, this slot was the highlight of my trip. The next time I'm in Vegas I'll plan on eating here daily."}
{"text":"Firefly is one of our favorites! It never disappoints. We went the other night with a big group for a special celebration. 
The service was spectacular and the food is super consistent and delicious! Our server was great and even comped us a bottle of champagne. If you are looking for a fun atmosphere, great food and delicious drinks firefly is the place!"}
{"text":"From the atmosphere to the food, I LOVE this place. This is like one of those secret off the strip places that you treasure. We brought a big group in during the Furniture Market. Our table wasn't ready so they let us hang in the bar. We had a blast! The SANGRIA here is amazing!!!!!! We then were seated and ordered TONS of plates -they were ALL delish! It is loud and a little crazy in here but I can't wait to bring other people here! 

Well done!"}
{"text":"Everything on the menu sounds delicious so it was so hard to chose , started of with camarones a la Diabla , they were not spicy at all mostly sweet but still tasty , followed with scallop escargots , so good but so hot! I burn my tough because I didn't wait . For main corse I had the lamb chops and my husband had the petite filet mignon and we finished off with the chocolate tress leeches cake . Everything's was great but I do have to say that the menu was overwhelming with so many options . The good thing is I can keep going and try something new every time."}
{"text":"We went for a bachelorette party and ordered 6 tapas and ipaella, flan. The best was apple and manchego salad and is a must try cold tapas. Rest all the other tapas which we ordered were really good. Would like to visit again for apple and manchego salad"}
{"text":"if you're in Vegas & want to go to a good nightspot a little off the strip with good food & good atmosphere.. go here, you won't be disappointed. try the mac & cheese.. the best!"}
{"text":"We ate at Firefly on Paradise during our last visit to Las Vegas and decided to try the new downtown location this time.  When we parked the car we were a bit put off because the Plaza hotel is pretty run down.

The setting of Firefly Bistro, however, is a one of a kind, in an atrium overlooking the downtown light show.

We had great service (from a Firefly veteran - she said she had been with the restaurant for 5 years) and we enjoyed our choices (bacon-wrapped dates, beef/mushroom kebabs, parmesan frites, chicken salad).  Our only regret was that we had eaten a large lunch (buffets be damned) so weren't too hungry at dinner and couldn't try more items (such as the lemon tarts we had had enjoyed so much on our last visit).

Firefly is a great tapas bar and the kitschy downtown location is worth a visit.  If you can time your visit to see the light show, I would recommend you do so and ask for a view table."}
{"text":"I cannot say enough about how great Firefly was. The menu was extensive, prices were great, and serving sizes were much bigger than I'm used to at tapas restaurants. What really made this worth five stars, however, was the excellent, excellent service. I went with two friends, one who has an extreme shellfish allergy. We called ahead of time, just to make sure it wouldn't be an issue (she knows not to order shellfish, of course, but kitchen cross-contamination can be deadly). We were told they could accommodate this food allergy, just to let our server know when we got there. Apparently, unbeknownst to us, they also flagged the reservation. So immediately after we were seated, Carlos, a manager, came to our table, acknowledged the allergy, and let us know we would be taken care of. The cleared out one fryer to only fry non-shellfish items for the evening, offered the best suggestions, and even put up with the additional issue that I'm a vegetarian. (Note: they have a separate vegetarian menu with only non-meat choices!) The sangria and mojitos were flowing, the food was great, and my friend was able to enjoy the meal without worry. Fantastic all the way around. This was, by far, our best food experience in Vegas, and we tried the gamut during our four days there!"}
{"text":"You will not find better food in Las Vegas!

The ambiance is wonderful. Staff is friendly. 

The shrimp ceviche is a MUST! And the banana nutella is a great way to end your meal. I've yet to have a bad thing on the menu. This is a wonderful restaurant with loyal customers. We have been going to all of their locations for years and will continue to do so."}
{"text":"This is still my favorite restaurant in the country, and that's saying a lot.

I've eaten here so many times. Here are the MUST HAVES at firefly that you won't get many other places.

- Boquerones (anchovies on toast with roasted red pepper, avocado)
- Shrimp Ceviche (out of this world)
- Bacon Wrapped Dates (unghhhhhhh)
- Manchego Mac n Cheese (unghhhhhhh)
- Empanadas (unghhhhhhh)
- Chorizo Clams (clams in a thin red sauce with chorizo, mmmmm)
- Ahi tuna skewers

I mean, I love everything on the menu, but this is a standard meal for 4 people at Firefly, in my opinion. So so so so so good."}
{"text":"Best tapas place I've ever been to in my whole entire young adult life.  I'll never go to Vegas again without stopping here for some grub.  Take lots of people and share.  Order one of everything, it's worth it.  Service was great - they sat a group of 12 even though we had no reservations at 6pm on a Saturday night (just told us to leave by 8).  Below I'll rate the plates individually:

Artichoke Toasts - awesome - 4 stars
Ceviche of Shrimp - awesome - 4 stars
Tuna Tartare - good - 3 stars
Tortilla a la Espanola - not a fan but that's personal - 3 stars
Patatas bravas - not the best, get the firefly fries instead - 3 stars
Manchego Mac N' Cheese - great - 4 stars
Tierra Y Mar Skewers - chorizo, shrimp and filet minon - hello? - 5 stars
Pulpo Asado - wish this was better but sadly it was dry - 3 stars
Chorizo Clams - AfreakinMazing - 5 stars
Camarones A La Diabla - awesome - 4 stars

Their bread with garlic is great too.  Everyone shared pitchers of red sangria.  Sadly I couldn't have any but I heard it was good.  The atmosphere, food, portions and service makes this a 5 star place in my book.  Oh and the price.  All the food above times two plus a few other dishes I didn't try, plus tax and 20% tip came out to only $352."}
{"text":"I have been to the old location on Paradise a few times in the past. I thought over time it became overrated. When they moved to a larger place I thought maybe the food would have improved. Not really. I still think its overrated and the tapas are slightly above average.  I am sure I will be back a few times because my friends LOVE Firefly. The next time I eat here I will most likely get an entree instead of tapas. 

PROS: Tres Leches chocolate cake
             Chorizo and clams
             Great place for a group to try many different dishes. 
             Ribeye Steak and truffle fries (entree)

CONS: Spicy Beef salad - the salsa verde didn't mix with the other ingredients
             Pulpo Asado - the octopus was good but the tomato, paprika lemon vinaigrette  didn't mix. 
             Lemon Berry Tarts - the berries were good but the tart cups taste like they came out of a  box."}
{"text":"Tapas and sangria... check.  Dim mood lighting... check.  Noisy, boisterous drunken conversation... check.  A long waiting list at 10pm?  Very impressive.

Firefly is a hip, party type place and very popular.  Unless you are going on a Monday night, don't think you are going to stroll in here on a Saturday night (even at 9pm) and get a table right away.  Make a reservation and get yourself opentable.com points.  I arrived 20 minutes early and was promptly seated.  Perhaps it was because it was just a party of 2 or perhaps they are just on the ball.  They generally had several large parties, so I am sure it is coordination nightmare.

Be sure to confirm your reservation and show up on time.  Otherwise, they will give away your table.

Service is as good as one can expect for a super busy restaurant.

Food consists of small dishes running about $5-10, with a few large dishes such as paella for $15.  You can see the menu online with exact pricing.  Expect that you will need 3-5 dishes per person depending on appetite.  Alcohol is fairly reasonable, though not really a bargain.  I figure a $6 sangria is fair for the most part.

We had smoked salmon on toast with cream cheese, paella, beef skewers, duck rolls, warm spinach salad and fish sticks.  The only dish that sort of missed the mark was the paella.  It had pockets of extreme flavor and pockets of extreme blandness.  I guess they didn't mix it enough or maybe that is how paella is supposed to be?  Each order, aside from the paella, serves two... maybe three, so plan accordingly.

They is no valet parking.  Just swing around behind Ruths Chris to find ample parking.

A pretty good strip mall for restaurants.  Yolie's is here, too."}
{"text":"Really underwhelmed.  Everything tasted like it had been soaked in a salt bath.  Even the warmed spinach salad!  Mac and cheese was completely bland and not worth it.  The octopus and chorizo was okay, although if the spinach salad was salty you know this was to the nth degree.  Overall I was very disappointed with the menu choices.  Won't likely waste my time or money here again."}
{"text":"More like 3.5 stars, but I'll round up.  The service was great.  The food was alright, not amazing, but for sure a solid choice.  I am very thankful for this oasis that was still walking distance from The Strip.  Much better value for money!"}
{"text":"The entire experience was fantastic. Love the atmosphere and the food was all delicious. Really enjoyed the vegetable empanadas. The goat cheese, the lamb the shrimp tempura and the bacon wrapped date. Oh and desserts! Loved the cherry chocolate bread pudding and the dessert plate with the tarts!! Yummy! I can't wait to come back and try some more things. One if the most yummy meals I've had in a while."}
{"text":"Maybe they should change the name to phoenix cause this place is reborn.

Its nice to see spot like Firefly bounce back from the whole Salmonella disaster last year. Yes people got sick from the food here, will it happen again? Nope. In fact they have a food safety consultant and its probably the safest place in town to eat.

I've been slacking on checking out the new location but I finally got to stop by a few days ago. The new location is a building over from their original spot but is probably three times the size. Its a large stand alone building with a big patio, massive bar, and plenty of space for diners and large parties. The new spot captures the look and feel of the original Firefly while expanding a little and establishing itself as its own restaurant. Across from the bar is an open kitchen viewing area/bar which should ease some concerns about food handling and safety.

During our visit the service was spot-on. Our server and bussers were on top of refills and had some great recommendations. Keep in mind that the tapas come out in waves not all at once. The food thankfully (unless you had the limited edition Salmonella flavors) is the same. During this last trip we had the mac n cheese, chorizo and chicken stuffed mushrooms, bacon wrapped dates, and chicken skewers. We also had the chicken and mushroom pallela, kind of like a gumbo without the shrimp, this thing can easily feed 3 to 4 people. All of the dishes were as delicious as before and I recommend checking out all of them. I think their raised their prices on the pitchers of mojitos but its still worth it especially if you are stopping by during happy hour.

Its great to see people give Firefly a second chance, and I commend the restaurant on making some substantive changes."}
{"text":"First off, this place is not on the strip. We went here for a reception after a wedding. We were placed in the back reception room where there were some high tables, a couple low tables and a few chairs. We had 40 people. 
They set up a bar in the room and because the wedding party did not opt to have an open bar we had to pay. $10+ per drink... During happy hour!!! Weak ass drinks to boot. 
The food was good but tiny. I mean really freakin small... Like one bite type of stuff. It was good but for what the bride and groom were charged, total rip off. I recommend finding something else for tapas. Unless you want to go broke. Kinda gross dirty building too."}
{"text":"I just want to say I have such an excellent experience for my Husband 40's Birthday Celebration.
Manuel really take care of everything we need and accommodate all the needs perfectly.
Is a great place to run a private events in their privates rooms.
The food was fenomenal and service excellent from the Managers to servers and bartenders.
Nothing to worry about our guest were so happy as I'm. My husband have a great surprise party.
I won't hesitate to make any celebration at Firefly and also we really enjoy the restaurant we usually have tapas there and we love it!!
Great place!!!!
Thank you so much!!!

{"text":"Even though firefly used to be a traditional local spot,,,it has become I've of the most talked about tapas restaurant in vegas. I have gone there so much i don't even need a menu and now.. Either do u! 

Bacon wrapped dates 
Mac n cheese
Beat salad
Mushroom tart
Stuffed peppers 
Steak and mushroom skewers 
Duck spring rolls 

My favorite... The sangria! Your welcome and enjoy!!! Xo"}
{"text":"Arrived for early dinner with a party of 6. Luckily we got there at 5pm and Happy Hour goes on till 6pm!! We ordered 4 Sangria pitchers and wow where they amazing!!! We also ordered the stuffed dates 10/10, chicken skewers 8/10, Fires were a 100/10 !!  
 Service was amazing! Waiters picked everything up right away  so don't leave anything unattended lol
Will make it a point to come have some sangria and a few appetizers here more often, the vibe here is great, the decor is amazing and just a really great spot to meet with friends!"}
{"text":"Wayyyy too salty! ! Couldn't even enjoy it:-( Got the Warm Spinach Salad & Eggplant canoli. The Eggplant was so little, could barely taste it. Plus it was drowning in goat cheese that didn't even taste good with the eggplant. The salad was so salty that it was hard to finish."}
{"text":"Best Vegas Spanish tapas I've found. I went at night and it happened to be happy hour so a lot of tapas and drinks were half of. Would highly recommend and can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"I came here for a birthday dinner this past week. We ordered a bunch of tapas for sharing. My favorites were the mushroom tart, tuna tartare, and the croquetas! The sauce from the mushroom tart was so delicious, it can be used as dipping sauce for the complimentary bread."}
{"text":"We went here with a large group. Even though the restaurant was very busy we were seated within 20 minutes, no reservation. We were not in a hurry, but were very happy with their ability to accommodate us quickly. 

The atmosphere is swanky and fun. The staff nice and very knowledgable. It was our first time trying a tapas restaurant, the menu is quite extensive giving us many choices. 

We tried the sangria, was excellent. The white was a little too sweet to drink a lot of, but was very good. Most in our party preferred the red. 

We ordered to share as a group, so we made a rule that if someone before you ordered an entree you could not order the same thing. Doing it that way allowed us to try many different things. Fun! 

When the food came we passed it around the table family style. They filled our extensive order accurately and with a great flow, well timed so we were not overwhelmed or ever waiting. 

The prices are affordable, the food is flavorful and varied (everyone can find something that fits their taste), the drinks are yummy and the ambiance is unique and perfect for a group looking to celebrate or an intimate date. 

Don't leave without trying the filet mignon or bacon wrapped dates, they are fantastic."}
{"text":"Amazing!

Wonderful food, great portions, and spot on waiter. I regret not getting our waiter's name, because he was truly a great guy and made us feel really comfortable and taken care of, without being overbearing or pushy.

We ordered: stuffed dates, ham and cheese croquettes, tuna tartare, firefly fish sticks, boquerones, and baked goat cheese. Fish sticks were okay but not too special; everything else I would definitely order again."}
{"text":"This is a PHENOMENAL place to hang out for brunch and some sangria or a light dinner before a party or for a bigger dinner, just a great place. The food is phenomenal, the service is amazing and after having a dispute with a credit card (that turned out not to be a dispute but a mistake on my part) the management was phenomenal with trying to work with me to solve the non-existent problem.

I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"Headed this way after  a late of bowling.  Happy hour  11pm to close -1pm m- th. Able to taste a few things that i would not normally order at full price. Apples manchego- pleasantly freshing apple salad with cheese crumbles  tossed in a vinegrette. Steak and mushrooms  on a stick was amazing.. moist with a drizzle of a flavorful  beef and red wine sauce.  Ceviche was right on point with avocado and home made chips ."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is incredible and the food is great. Small, bite size pieces of delishiness.....

Definitely try:

Apple/Manchengo salad - very refreshing
Smoked Salmon toasts
Ceviche of Shrimp - this was the best
Veggie Empanada
Roasted eggplant cannelloni
Stuffed peppers
Calamari - this is a huge plate)
Trio of gelato"}
{"text":"My hubby and I decided to dine here during a recent trip to Vegas. We wanted to get away from the strip and try a 'local' joint. After seeing the yelp rating we decided this place was worth trying. First off, the restaurant is located in a strip mall and the parking situation is awful. Basically we had to park in an adjacent lot and then cross the street. Once at the restaurant we waited for about 45 minutes for a table at which point we were seated outside. It took about 20 minutes to get water and bread. The bread was cold and stale and the tapas were flavorless and sad. I would not recommend this place to anyone! The service was terrible and the food was lackluster! Just stay on the strip!"}
{"text":"Excellent service matched with delicious food means a place I would frequent if only I lived in Vegas!  The apple salad with manchego cheese, so crispy, creamy and refreshing!  Eggplant goat cheese cannelloni again with the creamy goodness. Bacon wrapped dates, why mess with a classic, these were our favorite dish! Chicken tinga empanadas, chocolate cherry bread pudding, delish."}
{"text":"Delicious! Tons of options, for vegetarian and meat eaters alike. 

I went there on my first adult trip to vegas, 2 others had already been there and strongly suggested we go, and all 6 of us LOVED it."}
{"text":"Super yummy tapas! Service was awesome and the food was good! Just wish I sampled their famous sangrias! One negative though! Please don't order their ahi tuna skewers! Regret!! Besides that! Stuffed dates live up to the hype and the pork empanadas are a must try! NOM!"}
{"text":"now i know where all the cute vegas locals hangout. 
this is a super cool, fun, and useful tapas bar.
great food...my favorite is BACON WRAPPED DATES. i didn't think i would like it but once again i was wrong because i LOVE'em. stuff red peppers, beef and mushroom skewers, stuff mushrooms, and calamari were all delicious. 
great service
great sangria (the key is to add a shot of berry infused vodka) 
reasonable price ($5-10/ each tapas dish)
no disappointment what so ever

all the yelpers said everything i wanted to say about this place.
once again, yelpers prove to be right. we love good food and we are not shy to share with others how we feel about it."}
{"text":"This review is for 3.5 stars. 

I came to Firefly after work on a Friday to hit up the end of Happy Hour and try some tapas I've heard so many great things about.  The Happy Hour menu only includes drinks, but included beer, wine, and Sangria, most for $5 or less.  The bar area wasn't too crowded for the time and day of the week and had a very low-light, intimate, Spanish-type of setting.  It was a great environment and had a very post-work feeling to the crowd.  This makes sense as the restaurant is ideally located right next to the Corporate sector of Las Vegas.

I began with the Sangria, and it was very good and highly recommended.  I also had a chorizo plate which was quite good but not as authentic as I was expecting.  I saw a bunch of orders around me and they all looked great.

I will be back to come for an actual meal in the very near future.  Most of the food sits at around $7-13 for tapas so it is highly affordable and worth a go if in the area or even for an after work stop."}
{"text":"The paella had little flavor and tasted salty. The manchego mac and cheese was good but could of used more browning on the top and a hint of spice to cut the cheese. The tuna skewers were overcooked. Not sure how they have received 4.5 Stars this restaurant does not have the flavors to warrant 4.5 Stars."}
{"text":"Ambiance was hip.  Definitely good for the younger crowd.  But the food was also really good!  Loved the ceviche, chorizo clam, and stuffed dates was also pretty interesting.  I would've given 5 stars, but a couple of the steamed mussels were slightly off.  Price was reasonable, too!"}
{"text":"Very nice Spanish restaurant. Beautiful decor. Great service, waiter even ask you about if you have any allergies. Never ever j remember that somebody ask me about allergies in restaurant. Everything we ordered was delicious. Stuffed dates with unusual kick of bacon, nuts, cheese and reduced red wine but absolute delicious, must try. We also had spicy beef salad, ceviche of shrimp, baked tetilla ( melted tetilla cheese with sun dried tomatoes and chorizo), and mixed paella . Everything was delicious with enough spices. I hate over salted or over spiced food. They had just right. We were told it will take about 40 min to prepare paella so we ordered it first with drinks. Plates with tapas were brought at perfect intervals, as soon as we finished one, next was coming. I would recommend to visit this place off the strip about 2.4 miles from Caesar casino."}
{"text":"Food and drinks were awesome. The service lacks, we asked for bread and more water for hot tea twice and it never arrived."}
{"text":"Sounds like this place gets pretty packed. We were in town for a wedding, so we had our 2- and 5-year-old with us and we went at 2pm on a Friday--no wait and we didn't feel weird with our kids at that time of day. Our kids liked the Mac & Cheese, the Apple Salad, and all the Crostinis. Plenty of small items to choose from if you happen to bring your kids like we did.

Some items were a huge hit, and some things were just good. Sounds like the bacon-wrapped dates are the way to go, and it's true, they are pretty amazing--something you'll crave. I also loved the shrimp with chili sauce; lots of spice and flavor. 

We were full but wanted a taste of dessert, so we ordered the Dessert Platter amongst the six of us. We should've ordered another one because we loved all the little desserts. The popular ones were the Chocolate Tres Leches and the Passion Fruit Cheesecakes--I want to go back and order one of those just for myself."}
{"text":"I usually really like Firefly because the food comes out really quickly which I love, and it was delicious.  The issue came when we tried to ask for our check.  Our waitress seemed to have one whole side of the restaurant plus tables outside.  We had to ask for our check twice.  Then waited for awhile before she would come back to get the check.  In the meantime one of the people I was dining with had to leave.  10 minutes later came to get my cash payment and then 20 minutes later I was till waiting for my $87 of change.  The other three people I was dining with had to leave so I was now sitting alone and the waitress still did not come to bring my change.  I finally flagged a manager down and asked if I could please get my change because I had been waiting 20 minutes.  No apology, just said the waitress was having issue with another table.  Brought my change back in two minutes again saying the waitress was having issues with another table , I said I understood she was busy as it looked like she was waiting on half the restaurant.  She just looked at me like I had two heads. Brought down the mood from what had been a fun dinner."}
{"text":"Overall a very good experience here at Firefly. Traveling solo (no co-pilot!), so grabbed a seat at the large bar. The tapas menu is expansive, with many cold, veggie, and hot options. Very solid drink options and I chose wisely with the red sangria--not too sweet w/excess sugar and fruit--it was a perfect mix, just right. 

My tapas selections were spot on:  Pulpo asado (octo, potato,tomato, paprika-lemon Vinaigrette), the Chicken Tinga Empanada (fried and good), and the Mushroom Tart puff pastry (served warm--herbed cream cheese) in \"gravy\". The pulpo plate had a lovely coordinated flavor and the mush tart was a light, creamy journey to loveliness. 
The tapas and sangria were vehicles to the holy-land:  the Chocolate Tres Leches Cake. Do yourself a solid and share this with a pal or two--they will love you for it   I had the honor of devouring this symphony of flavor all on my own. 

Service was attentive at the bar--friendly and no nonsense. Grab some friends, some drinks, and have fun at Firefly."}
{"text":"As always I just love firefly. The feel, the atmosphere, the people, tapas and of course... sangria!! Perfect place and how can you not drool over those dates .. Mac n cheese ... Shrimp diabla... Sliders.. the bread pudding. I could go on forever only bad part is deciding .. love this restaurant. Lets not forget who started it all-Vegas favorite for sure. Can't wait for my birthday!"}
{"text":"amazing food,  this location it is always pretty packed so plan accordingly. Great atmosphere, the food is extra tasty, service sometimes can get slow but that it.  Great music, they restaurant is dimly lit so it great for both date nights and social gathering.

i would recommend................

the empanadas
the pulpo asado
the bacon wrapped dates
and buy a pitcher of sangria its so worth"}
{"text":"Great local spot.  Filet sliders were great.  Croquetas perfect.  Went with a co-worker, portions were perfect for sharing, not too expensive."}
{"text":"Fool me once? Shame on you. Fool me twice (and make me barf)? 

So I decided to give this place another chance back on my friend's birthday. The food ranged from really good (the bacon--wrapped figs) to meh. The service was as snooty as I remembered it. But the 1-star (I'd give it zero if I could) is for the FOOD POISONING I got from this dump that had me hurling for two days straight. This was about a month or so before Salmonella-Gate last year, which certainly explains a lot. 

I will never understand the amount of hype and praise this restaurant gets from foodies in this town."}
{"text":"This was our first time here. Food and service amazing. Stuffed peppers and fried calamari were our favorite. Mussels and ribs also delicious. We will be back next time we are in Vegas."}
{"text":"This was probably the best food I had over my 4 day stay in Vegas. We eat on the strip and off. 

We ordered 6 different dishes and only one did not impress us. That was the Papatas Bravas (roasted potatoes). They were bland and needed some kind of sauce. 

As a vegetarian my favorite dish was the Veggies and Lentils while my boy's favorite dish was a tie between the ribs and the bacon wrapped dates. We will definitely be back to explore more of the menu! 

Ps... sit on the patio!"}
{"text":"For the uninitiated, tapas are meant to be small plated hours d'vours to be eaten during long stretches of pub drinking. Served on small plates, tapas were originally meant to rest on a small plate on top of your beer as you stand in a group and talk ( thus the name tapas ). Eating small amounts but throughout the entire evening helps combat all the alchohol thus allowing you to drink more and longer! Brilliant! Firefly is a fun place to gather with a large group of friends, drink and eat. A decent selection of many spanish styled tapas ensures that one can find at least a few pleasing dishes. Here, variety is the spice of life and make sure to have a ride as all dishes are best paired with heavy doses of pickling ones own liver!"}
{"text":"Will keep this short and sweet. Great place to get either small plates or even an entree. Wanted to try to Paella but ordered so many of the small plates didn;t have room. I was with friends and we all ordered and shared stuff. We loved everything we ordered. Some small plates are priced ok and others a little high. I like this location over the old one. Much bigger, more room, nice bar. Will be a regular here."}
{"text":"Wow!!!! Just wow!!!! We got 5 things but 2 were by far the best. The Ceviche of shrimp and steak and mushroom skewers are amazing!!!!! For sure get them or at least one."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in vegas! The place is a little small & does get packed, but it is worth the wait! My favorites are the stuffed dates, filet mignon sliders & the stuffed peppers & the bread pudding for dessert.  I have never liked stuffed peppers anywhere until I tried them here, they are amazing! I have never been disappointed in the food & have eaten there many times! I highly suggest firefly & I am extremely picky, so for me to give a place 5 stars is very rare! & if you don't like the loud music & the tight space, then order to go! I've done this a few times as well & it's still amazing!"}
{"text":"Now that it has moved, I must write a new review. I just love this place! I am sad that I have moved so it is out of my way so I can't make my weekly happy hour trips, but I have been able to visit a few times and I have had great experiences. The food and drinks were just as good as the old location as was the service. I love that the new location is much bigger and more modern, although I do miss the dark romantic ambiance the old location had, but the bigger the restaurant is that means the less of a wait so I'm happy about that! Also, valet is a HUGE plus as the last location's parking situation was horrible. Some of my favorites I order every time I have been here and never disappoint are the stuffed peppers, pulpo asado and camarones al ajillo (garlic shrimp, I may have totally spelled that wrong but at least I tried LOL). Definitely recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"Called to pick up the seafood paella an hour before going to pick it up. It still wasn't ready when I went to pick it up. Had to wait another 20 minutes until it was done.

Apart from the waiting, the paella was delicious and enough for two people. Firefly did not skimp on the seafood and their tomato sauce is delicious.

The bread was delicious and fresh. The sauce to go with it is buttery and fantastic.

I would highly recommend trying their food. It did not disappoint."}
{"text":"Overall it's still firefly even with the scare that happened. I came here the other night and ordered a few dishes , it's still really good just like it's always been there was a few minor changes to each dish. The server was the only downfall to my experience here. Overall still taste and has the vibe of firefly."}
{"text":"This tapas restaurant has amazing food. Value is great, the choice of tapas is fantastic and all the ones we tried from gaspachos, bacon covered dates, apple mangego salad, firefly fries, ablondigas were unbelievable. We also had brunch tapas and came back twice! Best food in a long time, not to miss. Will try next their other Mexican restaurant! Congrats to Chef Villanueva and his team! Great service as well. A big thanks!"}
{"text":"The sangria is marinated for 3 days, so can you imagine how incredibly tasty this is?

Wish I can say the same thing about the food.

Well, except for their paella  -- chunks of chicken, chorizo, mussels, clams, prawns (yeah, NOT shrimp!), you'd be seriously amazed by how deep this dish is, we took home half of the paella and had it for breakfast the next day.  GET IT and for $15, it is quite a deal.

Spotty service didn't make us feel better spending money on cabbing it here -- it's about 3.5 miles away from the center of the strip.  Oh, it also didn't help that the NBA Celtics vs. Lakers final game was on  TV -- MOST of the staff was glued on the game.  I'm all for cheering and enjoying the game -- but not when I'm waiting for my check or my drink."}
{"text":"Everything was off to a good start with the food until the mussels and clams. Then the service went south. Hmmmmm, if it wasn't for the tuna tar tar I wouldn't have been happy."}
{"text":"The food here is great we order so many things every time we come here and are always more than satisfied! Oscar and Carlos are great servers, funny and easy going!"}
{"text":"love this place.  it's got everything you need for date night, girls night, friends night...any night!

great ambiance, amazing mojitos, yummy food, very intimate!!  also, the tapas portions allows you to try everything.  it's a great way to dine.

2 thumbs up!! way up!

some of my favorites:
smoked salmon platter
empanadas
baked brie
stuffed mushrooms
steak skewers
and..
BANANA NUTELLA SANDWICHES...

enjoy!"}
{"text":"Prices are a little steep for tapas, but then again portions are pretty decent. The drinks are strong and good. I had the muscles and the portion was huge! Also delicious."}
{"text":"I died and went to tapas heaven!!!  OMG the pork empanadas gave me a foodgasm. You must get the stuffed dates.  Think candied bacon with a sweet creamy filling. Paired with a yummy sangria this. Place will be visited twice while I'm here on vacation."}
{"text":"By far THE BEST PLACE FOR SPANISH TAPAS for hundreds of miles around. I'm torn between giving them 4 out of 5 stars because the lowlights of the hostess's/our unattentive waiter. The food however and the busboy(man) was the stars of the night. We had a helping of their Bacon Wrapped Dates with Cheese/Nuts...I my...Tasting Food Porn WOW. Delicious...To start actually...the Bread with Almond Butter Yum!! Who would've thought Almond would make Butter taste So Good? We also had the Mushroom Puff Pastry tart which was very tastey as well as the Spicy Beef Salad (BEWARE Very Spicey but very Good) and the Duck Egg Rolls (Crunchy, Meatey, and Saucey delicatable). You MUST try the Bacon Wrapped Dates though, it's been 2 days and I'm still thinking about them. How tastey they were and how genius. AMBIENCE: Red and More Red lighting. Very hip place. Plenty of Good Atmosphere. A great buzz. Packed for sure. RESERVATIONS a MUST a long as the Hostess don't screw them up. We thought we'd successfully changed out reservation time, come to find out they hadn't done anything to it. The waiter was also too busy focusing on his bigger tip/group tables."}
{"text":"Id give a 1 star if the food wasnt so delicious here. thats why im giving two. 
The service was horrible. came here for a going away party last week and we were sat in the middle of the room at a long table. My boyfriend and I were a little late so we asked the hostess if she sat any big parties, who ever she was texting on her phone was obviously waaay more important then we were so we found our party ourselves. once at the table it took us 15 minutes to be able to order drinks. I ordered my usual scotch and soda, never being asked what scotch i wanted, but i assumed they would just give me their well scotch. was i wrong about that... but we will go over that once i tell you about our bill.

our drinks finally arrive about 10 minutes later, i ordered water as well so i reminded the server when he dropped off our drinks. Our water never came, even after reminding him a 3rd time.

The food was amazing, as usual. We had the heirloom salad, padron peppers, artichoke toasts, ceviche, ahi poke, and we split the spicy shrimp. (i obviously took a break from veganism for a night) The heirloom salad is freaking amazing, ive never had such a great salad. 

Once getting our bill, we noticed i was charged for Macallan 12. For all my scotch drinkers that are reading this, it is a crime to mix Macallan 12 with soda.. If you cant just drink it straight, just admit to yourself that you are by no means a scotch enthusiast.  And with a price of $14 (i think?) a drink, we werent too thrilled. On top of everything the tip was already included, and we werent told this. So for horrible service we ended up tipping double. 

On our way out the same hostess was still on her phone texting away. If we didnt live in Veer Towers and were so close to this location we would never return. You would figure with all the bad press this restaurant has endured they would step up their customer service."}
{"text":"My first time at this location.
I'll start with the pros: The food is still pretty good. I ordered the Patatas Bravas (roasted red potatoes $5.5) and the Steak Skewers ($9). The steak skewers were the same delicious steak and mushrooms that I remember, served in a flavorful red wine reduction. The potatoes seemed to have a little more of a cheesy sauce to them, than I remember but they were still really good. 
I also still like the original, red sangria. Red and fruity deliciousness. 

The service was good, they seemed to be attentive. One of the servers did forget to bring me a water, but he apologized, and brought it later.

The cons:
One of the side plates on our table had dried food on it, this was before we were brought any food or drink. The menu also had some dried food on it... not that big a deal, but they should be more attentive to cleanliness. 

When I arrived there was only a few of us sitting at the table and I asked if I could be on my own check. The server agreed, I only had one sangria and more people joined our group, the server told me that I had to cash out and go on the group check. All parties of six or more must be on the same check. This doesn't really make any sense to me, and is quite an inconvenience.

Also, our table was never brought any bread. I didn't even think to ask for it, and actually forgot about it until I saw the photo of it on here. 

Overall the food is good, service is ok... I'm not overly fond of the \"rules\" but I guess I just need to limit my group to 5 or less."}
{"text":"I took my two tweenage boys here and we had a wonderful meal. I loved our wait staff, and I loved watching them and the kitchen people making and delivering the food. I had lamb skewers, chix skewers, filet sliders, parmesan fries - so yummy!  We all loved it so much, we are going to buy shirts from the website. It is a cool place. The only drawback was how loud it was - Friday night, early, it was PACKED! A testament to it's goodness! I already want to go back with hubby!!!"}
{"text":"I pledge to myself that every time I visit Vegas, I will drop by Firefly. Food is amazing, wine list is great, and sangrias are the best in town. Staff if knowledgeable of their menu, the process and ingredients...and friendly! You feel the local ambiance and you don't get stick with high prices..."}
{"text":"We are in Las Vegas at least 10 times a year and always have dinner at the Firefly.  We have never been disappointed with either food or service.  The best value around for food quality--and the sangria is some of the best around.  The firefly fries are always a hit when we bring people here.  The menu is so varied that it is perfect for any palate."}
{"text":"Hands down.......Best Tapas Ever.
Took a chance on this place based on the reviews. Gambled and won big!!!!
Had pork empanadas, Tierra del Mar skewers and a nice rib eye steak. 
Staff was attentive and friendly. 
Ambience was cool. I will be back for sure.
I definitely  recommend  this tapas bar!!"}
{"text":"After being a huge fan of the Firefly Paradise location, I was very eager to try out the new spot while the Plaza gets remodeled. I loved it just as much this time as my first. This is totally MY kind of place, I would go back 1,000 times! Tried out a couple new things this time, I would recommend all of them: White sangria is a must, lamb skewers, ceviche, bacon wrapped figs, & patatas bravas. The calamari was also good last time I tried it. This is a great date spot, or even a night out with the girls. Vibrant, fun crowd. Go!"}
{"text":"If you want to get away from the strip....including the glitz, glamour, and expensive cuisine...come HERE.  They had the biggest tapas portions I've ever had, and I won't even take the time to list what I ordered because everything tasted amazing.

With a group of 12 people, with each person ordering 3 - 5 different plates, that's a lot of taste testing.  There wasn't one thing I didn't say...\"OMG...that's delicious.\"

The one thing I wished I had tried was the sangria, but the bottomless mojitos were delightful as well.  The service was also great, but it got to the point that there was so much food coming out, that they didn't bother asking what belonged to who...so that got annoying trying to pass down the plates.

All in all...I would seriously give this place a chance, even though it might be a small trek for all of you staying along the Strip.  But definitely worth the try.

Trust."}
{"text":"Spacious casual or pre or post club place on Paradise, so convenient for clubbing. I enjoyed the tapas, but half of them tended to lean towards the quality of Applebee's type dishes. I really liked the huge open windows and the vibrant young crowd, the air felt full of pre-game excitement of Vegas partying. I had a couple of beautiful glasses of red wine, pretty fantastic wine choices considering the not so great quality of the food.

I have to say, that this place would come in handy if you are drunk off your gourd and needed some heavy friend food to dissipate the feeling. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"First time here and I was impressed. Off the strip it is a favorite of the locals and its tapas style dining is a great opportunity for a group to try several of their tasty offerings. Everything we ordered, and it was a large selection, was nicely prepared with this restaurant's own signature highlighted by subtle variations. For a Tuesday night it was unbelievably busy and that is a testament to its ability to tickle the palate."}
{"text":"Went here to eat with my husband and two friends.  Everything was fantastic!  Service, atmosphere, drinks and food.  Can't wait to go back for our birthday!!  Best eats in Vegas, forget the Strip.."}
{"text":"Really great atmosphere!  They were super busy on the Saturday night I went to dinner with friends, but they somehow managed to give stellar service!  The server and busser (this place apparently works in teams to handle tables) were attentive, pleasant, and funny to boot.  

The food, well, it's super tasty, and you would do a disservice to yourself to not come here at least once.

Big kudos for a larger space and more parking than the Paradise location.

Oh, and they're allegedly doing salsa nights on every other Saturday, though don't quote on me that as I only heard that from the busser in passing. 

Great option for dinner with friends or for a date night!"}
{"text":"I think we tried about 7 or 8 dishes and only the ribs and calamari stood out. Bacon wrapped figs didn't do anything for me. Joint is cheap and boisterous if that's what you're looking for."}
{"text":"New Year's Day and came here for a very late lunch. With the hubby and bro in tow, we ordered several plates to share and waited until 3pm to order the lemon-lime mojito which at HH prices, was half off for a pitcher. Our server was very friendly and accomodating. He recommended several plates which he explained in detail. Such a nice guy and really very attentive. 

We ordered the stuff dates (2 plates), boquerones, tuna tartare, stuffed peppers, terra y mare skewers, and 2 pitchers of lemon-lime mojito. 

My faves are:
-stuffed dates- who doesnt love lots of cheese and crispy bacon? It was so good I had to have 2 orders
-stuffed peppers- garlic cream cheese and mozzarella stuffed inside a red pepper with tomato sauce
-boquerones- spanish white anchovies on toast with roast red and yellow peppers. I nver had anchovies before, but this was suprisingly good. It had a nice balance of acidic flavors.

just ok:
-the terra y mare skwers- it just tasted like ordinary skewered beef (tough) and shrimp (tasty). 

The mojito pitcher is usually $28 but at HH prices, it was only $14!!

It was sooo good and very refreshing with the loads of yummy mint that we ordered another. 

MMMMMmmm...this was a great first meal for 2010. And you bet, I will be coming back for more."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat. Sparkling sangria and the ham & cheese croquetas are my fav."}
{"text":"This is always my go to place in Vegas.  Not on Strip, great food, and close enough for Uber.  They moved into a much larger place from the start so you can get in pretty quickly with a party but always make reservation if you have a large party.  The 1st favorite is bacon wrapped dates, just try it and you will be hooked. Plates are small so sharing is recommended.  The meats are awesome, albondigas(sp).  Etc.  I love almost all fish dishes, try to get the ceviche with fish or shrimp.  You should try the sangria's and order pitcher's, you'll want more after one.  All the food is solid, some of them unique taste.  Go here if you want to eat well, and start with what I said up here."}
{"text":"I think with this place having SUCH high reviews, I expected more. instead, the popular dishes listed on yelp really were kind of a letdown minus a few shining stars

STARS!!!
-the RED SANGRIA! prob one of the yummiest sangrias i've had in awhile
-the stuffed dates. I don't even normally like dates, but it was wrapped in amazing bacon goodness AND it didn't taste liek a date! haha
-tuna tartare, this was my favorite........just light, refreshing, fresh tuna and perfect amount of avocado and the chips that came with it were delicious!
- the service. amazing service. everyone here is very friendly and sweet.

average:

artichoke toasts. They were good, but not great.
crispy duck roll was a little dry and only ok, but still flavorful and yes, filled with lots of duck

some downfalls :(
all the other dishes we ate.

-the shrimp ceviche was sooo sour, they basically just threw in lemon juice into a bowl and threw some shrimp in it
-the famed filet mignon sliders had terrible bread and the steak was chewy
the \"manchego mac n' cheese\" lacked flavor and was really bland

I've definitely been to better tapas spots and if I'm back in vegas, unfortunately, will most likely not be back."}
{"text":"We went late, sat at the bar. Our bartender was nice and helpful with our questions. Sliders and chicken tinga empanada were highlights. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Went here for happy hour for my husbands birthday.  We sat outside on the patio.  It was a beautiful day.   We got monitors and sangria to drink. Yummy!!!   To eat got a bunch of tapas. The stuffed pepper bacon wrapped dates and steak were amazing. The other ones certainly weren't bad at all. We cannot wait to go back n"}
{"text":"We had our wedding reception in one of their private rooms for 35 guests.  We chose the Tapas banquet  ( stuffed dates are DELISH) and the premium bar. We had the room for three hours.  Everyone and everything was beyond compare.  The food kept coming  the wait staff was unobtrusive.  Bar was great.  I cannot say enough about how great Fernanda was to work with.  I'm sure I made her crazy.  All of our requests were met.  All in all a great experience.  Our guests are all saying it was THE BEST EVER!  Thank you FIREFLY."}
{"text":"I had the privilege to go here for a girlfriend's 30th birthday party. There were just 6 of us and we were seated right away at a table near the door (which was perfect so we could see our friends arrive). We started with a pitcher of red sangria, which was absolutely perfect. It goes down WAY too easy.

We ordered dishes bit by bit. The highlights were:
Bacon wrapped dates - a must have whenever you come here
Lox on toasted brioche, creme fraiche, tomatoes, capers with a dill vinaigrette - So light and an excellent new find
Tomato basil bisque- I HATE tomato soup usually...until I tried this...served with a grilled cheese sandwich.
Calamari - will a garlic lemon aioli...not good for you but so dang tasty

The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the ahi tuna skewers. They weren't awful but they just didn't do it for me. Too much pineapple and mango and not enough tuna. Gotta take the good with the bad.

Our server was pretty attentive until the end. It was close to midnight and we wanted a round of shots to cheers the end of my friend's 20's. By the time he came back...there was 3 minutes left. We didn't get them until 5 minutes after so we were a bit bummed but still bid her last decade farewell.

Overall it was a great night and we had a blast...will be back soon :)"}
{"text":"We ate at ramseys steak the night before - here is my 2 star review of that place which i will never eat at again.  The wine list is a bit overpriced - many of our local wines were nearly double in price.  Food service was slow - quoted 45 minutes for meal to be ready (beef Wellington) took close to an hour (we had a show to see -which we informed server - that was 2.5 hours after our reservation time) - don't order Wellington if you have time constraints.  Wellington was nothing special.  Food was good but nothing spectacular.  The price points were high - we had an inexpensive bottle of red and total for 4 was over $400.  The next night we ate at firefly - for 10 people it was nearly $100 cheaper - the food was 10 times better, better service, more variety, better ambiance and overall much better dining experience.  Will never go back to Ramsey's.

Did you catch the point where I compared firefly to Ramsey's?  No comparison - firefly is in our top five favorite places we have eaten.  Our entire group had a wonderful dinner - everything was great - from the rod to service.  We showed up at 630 on a Saturday and were seated right away - and everything was wonderful from there on - our favorite was the scallop escargot - but everything had wonderful flavors - will definitely be stopping here on our next trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"In the land of buffets and assortment of restaurants this is truly a hidden gem. there is only one word I need to use to describe this place - yum!!!! It is a little bit off the strip but definitely worth a try. Everything I tasted was delicious and mouthwatering. Also the service was pretty good and I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I have to eat here at least once every time I come to Vegas. I thought it was a hidden gem, but noticed a lot of reviews on Yelp.

Either way, the place is the best you can do for the price, and the variety (and huge menu) ensure that everybody is happy.

When it comes to suggestions, get the Dates and be sure to drink Red Sangria. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the duck, but that's like one item out of 60."}
{"text":"We hosted a dinner during my sister's bachelorette weekend and it was amazing!! Everyone was so helpful and the food was amazing!! The stuffed dates and sangria were my favorites! Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Their sangria is sooo good!!  The dates are a must,so are the croquetas and empanadas!! Everything I had was ridiculously good. Price wise, not bad well worth it."}
{"text":"Bring Firefly to NYC! ... Or maybe don't. I like having secrets gems out of state. Their happy hour is TOP NOTCH. It's off the strip but so what? So much variety and it's all half off! Lowkey spot, cool ambience, AWESOME DRINK/TAPAS MENU! Def make this a stop for happy hour!"}
{"text":"Must try Lamb chops, warm spinach salad, shrimp, & veggie empanada.   GREAT atmosphere.   Light & refreshing"}
{"text":"\"my endless love!\"

I visit Vegas almost as often as I change my undergarments.... seriously! We have been there twice this month and visit Firefly each and every time!!

I am vegetarian, pushing vegan and there are TONS of yummy creative options for me! With a few modifications, there are even MORE options! My boyfriend is a full-fledged carnivore and this is a place that suits us both. 

His favorite: the Rib Eye. My favorites: The empenadas, the artichoke toasts (with or without the aioli!), the green apple salad and the lentils (though they do need a little salsa/sauce). 

We always sit at the bar. 
Service is not the friendliest in the land or the most attentive but it is definitely not bad. Actually, in about the 2 years we have been going there it has improved. But there is still the occasional empty bar and we have to flag down the bartender even though there is no one else around. 

I encourage you... please do NOT go here. It will be too packed and I will be super sad if we cannot find a seat! This is my place, MINE I tell you!"}
{"text":"This place was really amazing.  They have a huge variety of tapas and all selections we sampled were very unique and tasted excellent.  The bar is cool and I strongly recommend the sangria as it is the best I have ever had.  My favorite tapas was the bacon wrapped dates.  The location is just off the strip and it is easy to get to.  Service was fantastic and prices were reasonable for an upscale restaurant with a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"I had been feening for tapas after trying Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba in Chicago, so finally came out to Vegas on a weekend girls trip and hit this place up for dinner. 

The place was definitely cute and cozy, with spanish decorations along the wall and dim lighting. My only gripe with the place was how dark it was - it was just a little hard to see our food or maybe I'm just being nitpicky? I have no complaints about the service, our server was attentive and helpful and our food came out fast! (our dinner maybe lasted an hour?)

For 7 girls, 1 pitcher of white sangria, 11 tapas & 2 desserts...our bill came out to about $22/person w/ tip!!! so this place definitely scores with the price range and we were definitely content, not starving or overly stuffed! 

What we ordered: tuna tartare, shrimp ceviche, chorizo clams, curry mussels, stuffed peppers, stuffed mushrooms, duck rolls, manchego mac n cheese, firefly fries, stuffed dates, baked brie, banana nutella sandwiches & chocolate tres leches. 

We loved everything with the exception of the duck rolls (dont get them!) and their white sangria wasnt up to par with the white mango sangria I had at Ba-Ba-Reeba in Chicago (but then again it really is a hard one to beat!). The  tres leches could have been softer (it seemed a bit stiff) but it was well complemented with the strawberries. I would love to come back again and try all the other things on the menu! Until next time..."}
{"text":"Very good tapas and great selection of adult beverages. Be careful though, it's easy to spend a lot of money here by ordering a lot of tasty pitchers of sangria or mojoto's then followed up by the delicious assortment of tapas."}
{"text":"Dinner just took way too long. The food was good but it was not as great as it used to be. Things were either way too salty or not flavorful enough. The white sangria was way too sweet but the strawberry mojito was delicious.   I used to love the papitas bravas now I would have to say my favorite is the manchego mac and cheese. The service was sooooo slow."}
{"text":"Here is the deal folks : come here for tapas only!  I mean, that's it! Not paella, not for the hostess service, not for trying to get most of your tapas together.   Fill up on tapas. And the sangria will not disappoint. 

Five stars tapas are as follows: stuffed dates (ON POINT - I mean seriously on POINT! ), merguez (couldn't ask for better lamb sausage - savory with right amount of spice), empanada (NOT the the chicken tinga), chicken and chorizo stuffed mushroom,  juevos estrellados (it has really good spice but only order to get full...carbs will help fill you up)  

They have outdoor misters if you want to be outdoors. Noise level is fine. Not too rowdy at all but I went on a sunday evening around 8 pm so you be the judge.   Plenty of parking but can easily get here by taxi from the strip for under ten bucks (like 8 bucks) - note that we came from Wynn. 

One of the better tapas places I've been to. Really really good food. :)"}
{"text":"You have to make a trip to firefly at least once if you live out here. Or if you don't. I'm not a huge fan of the concept of tapas, but these guys sold me on it fairly well. I had several pickings, including a delicious red kabob skewer that really stood out. Some cheesy fry like thing that I can't remember but I do recall was pretty tasty. Even the bread and butter is good here. And you definitely have to order a pitcher of the sangria. To the more budget minded diner, I highly recommend you take advantage of their reasonable happy hour when you have the opportunity. Tasty treats, unique dining experience, cool ambience--there's plenty to love about Firefly."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite restaurant. i used to go to here like 3 times a week. I love me some tapas since i always like to try a little bit of everything on the table. The food is great anytime, day or night. The happy hour is great, half off all pitchers! Their red wine sangria and their mango mojitos are delicious! 

Ooo their Firefly Fries!...I could clear off the entire dish. I think I have tried almost everything off the menu, but i cant decide which dish is like the most. I suggest trying as much as you can off the menu. Everything is delicious!

The ambiance at night is so \"romantical.\" It does get busy at night, especially all day on the weekends. Unfortunately, they don't take reservations on Fridays and Saturdays! Other than that, must go!"}
{"text":"Went to firefly with homies for a bday dinner. Have to say the customer service was on point with them constantly checking up on us. The food was priced well and came out fast. Definitely had some favorites but I feel like if you know what to order this place is bomb. Way better than overpaying at the strip. Would be back for sure."}
{"text":"I love this place. My company usually get the red sangria which is always so good. And fried calamari and salad taste great. It is one of perfect places to hang out with your friends. I just wish they open more longer at night.."}
{"text":"The food is good as always disappointed they removed some items but added some new. My review is based on service and in the restaurant industry customer service should above and beyond that's what tips are based off right? Well in my case my server took a few mins too long to greet our table didn't really care for us.... Our food came she didn't even ask us if we liked it or how was it... She didn't even top off our waters!! She was passing my our table and didn't stop once and she would be either her coworkers by the register chatting away ... This is tapas plates get empty fast and we finished and waited for some interaction from her. I was so irritated I had to speak to a manager who then only offered drinks... She allowed the same server to serve and she was now being rude in purpose. For a Friday night that was only maybe 8-10 tables with people they were having bad customer service as if they were a full house and short staffed sad to say I won't go back in particular to this location
I got better customer service at old firefly that has a wait and elbow to elbow tables that are full 
The atmosphere and ambience was also bad... Too bright no music until I addressed why there's no music it was awkward"}
{"text":"My favorite place to dance in Las Vegas! I've been coming here for years and it never fails to be a good time, especially if you love salsa."}
{"text":"The food and service is amazing! 
Great ambiance too. 
I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"My wife loves this place. We used to go here a lot. Actually we used to go here everytime we go to las vegas. We would also recommend this place to everyone.

Its a tapas place (small plates) which is good so you get to taste a lot of different dishes.

Me and my wife felt that this place deteriorated over time."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Right next to the Hard Rock where I was staying....so I'm so upset I've never been here! We got a table in about 15 minutes. First went to the bar for some sangria. 

We all ordered 2 plates at a time and they were all delicious. Meatballs to skewers to shimp OH MY! It gets a little pricey if you're really hungry so try to eat light. Keep a menu nearby and order before you are done with your first course or else you will be waiting awhile in between rounds.  

The service was OK, he forgot my wine for a little bit then brought me champagne....I won't hold it against him though because I also love champage as well...

The ambiance was very ALIVE! I missed the salsa dancing, but this place looks super fun!

My recommendation: Skip the over priced hotel restaurants and come here!"}
{"text":"Excellent service from Neo! Food is flavorful , ambiance pretty chill. Sangria delish . Mushroom tart a must try ! Paella tDF"}
{"text":"Excellent tapas dishes; we had 5 different plates that were all equally delicious. They have a honey & almond butter with their bread that is unbelievable. Atmosphere was really nice too - noisy but you can still have conversations. The service was awesome with the dishes coming out one after another, giving us time to enjoy each one. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"I'd give it 5 stars, but I only had a mojito and a couple bites of my friends tapas.  He ordered baby red potatoes w/ aioli sauce and spicy duck egg rolls, which were both very tasty.

I loved the atmosphere and the Brazilian/Spanish music.  I can't wait to go back and try some more tapas.  This would be the perfect place to impress a date and set the right mood, without going broke!  The tapas range in price between $3-$8, so you can afford to experiment...have fun!!!"}
{"text":"Great food, reasonable prices, great ambiance with a cool, hip vibe. I have been coming here for years and never been disappointed. It's off the strip, but totally worth the cab fare. Some notable menu items: 

Sangria and the mojitos...goes without saying ;-)

Machego Mac n cheese
stuffed peppers
apple manchego salad
artichoke toasts
croquetas
stuffed dates (OMG!!)
filet sliders
banana nutella sandwiches (amazeballs)

I have had most of the menu items...they are all really good."}
{"text":"My review would have been a 5 star rating, but their night time salsa dancers pissed me off & ruined my good time.

First, let me say that the red sangria is the best I've ever had!!  Truly amazing!  Our party of 3 finished two pitchers (it would have been more had we not been \"forced\" out).

It was SO noisy inside with little acoustic material to absorb sound so we asked to sit on the patio. It was a beautiful fall night!

We had the dates, shrimp ceviche, tuna tartare, baby back ribs, skewered meats, and caramel flan.  All the food had a rich flavor, and everything tasted very fresh. The sauce on the ribs was sweet yet savory.

Everything was perfect until the salsa band showed up. Girl #1 started moving tables to make room for dancing by dragging the metal tables across the floor. It was so loud & the pitch was so high that it hurt my ears....like nails on a chalkboard!  Seriously?!?!  There were still 3 tables enjoying their meal!!  Then girl #2 approached each table & basically told us to leave because they were going to play music & dance. WTF?!?!  After telling the server that I was upset, we paid our check.  When we arose from the table, these people had all their band stuff around our table & we couldn't even exit the area!!  SO RUDE!!!!

Had the manager approached us earlier to let us know what was going on, we would have taken our group inside to drink more sangria. But instead the server kept apologizing.  So we just left. 

If I do return to this restaurant, it will be for the food & I will NOT get in the way of the rude conceited self-absorbed salsa people. Just plain ridiculous."}
{"text":"Bartender is friendly and makes great drinks. Also recommends what to get since it's my first time."}
{"text":"I adore tapas and am thankful Firefly is in Vegas because the only other tapas plus in town sucks. 

But...Firefly can be really uneven. When it's good, it's wonderful. When it's not good....it's pretty stinky. 

Best thing on the menu...stuffed dates! The sweet of the dates and the salty smoky flavor of bacon and the sharp pungent taste of blue cheese is a smash hit!

Other favorites are the tuna tartare, ceviche, terra y mare skewers (shrimp, beef, and chorizo)

Worst on the menu? The spicy beef salad is supposed to be Thai food (which really doesn't belong on a tapas menu anyway) and might be one of the nastier things I've ever tasted. 

The roasted eggplant canneloni is bland, but at least it's edible. I'd say about the same for the duck rolls.

When  this place is good, it can achieve awesome...but be careful of what you order. I give it 4 stars because if you know your way around the menu, you can have a great meal here."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The waiter we had was so attentive and even moved our menus to the side for us to have extra space on the table. The pitcher of red wine sangria was delicious and just two tapas were enough to fill me up. I had the apple machengo which was a green apple type salad which was delicious, and the ahi tuna skewers which I highly recommend. The atmosphere is calm yet infused with red everywhere and the music is just the right volume for having conversation without yelling"}
{"text":"WOW the best tapas i've ever had! i first found this on yelp, and then we asked our hotel for a good happy hour place and he said FireFly! so i felt that we had to try this place. three of us ordered:
+ Boquerones [Spanish white anchovies on toasts w/roast red pepper, yellow pepper vin]
+ Sausage Plate [Four imported Spanish sausages, cornichons, capers, mustard]
+ Tuna tartare [layers of mango, marinated ahi tuna, avocado, taro chips]
+ Steak and mushroom skewers [grilled filet, roast garlic cream, red wine reduction]
+ Crispy duck rolls [cherry hoisin sauce]
+ Pulpo asado [marinated and grilled octopus, potato, tomato] 

plus they gave us bread & olives to start with, and we ordered sangria, and other drinks. the best dish was the pulpo asado, and the one that was not outstanding was the tuna tartare. i would definitely come back here again! i love this place."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE!

I frequent Vegas often, but I had an unplanned, overnight stay on Sunday, due to a layover. I ended up going to Firefly for a late dinner w/friends, around 10:30pm. We waited less than 10 min for a table for four. Their menu is on the lengthy side, but it was very easy to scan through, which surprised me. There are a lot of words, but descriptions get to the point and just tell you the main ingredients. Good enough for me.

Things we ordered: (Ready, set, DROOL!)
-Ceviche of shrimp
-Firefly fries 
-Mushroom tart
-Steamed mussels
-Ham and cheese croquetas
-Steak and mushroom skewers
-Crispy duck roll
-Chocolate \"tres-leches\" cake
-Passion Fruit mojito

Drooling yet? YUMMO! Everything was great, but my favorite was the mushroom tart. The mojito was very refreshing, the service was great. I can't wait to try more tapas from their menu! When I'm a fan, I'm very loyal. I will definitely make it back to Firefly again soon."}
{"text":"This location is nowhere close to the ambiance and intimate atmosphere that makes Firefly special, but the food and sangria is exactly the same so 5 stars is all I can give. If you hate anything about Firefly that makes you a terrorist. DON'T BE A TERRORIST.

For a serious review please see my original Firefly on Paradise review. I would post a link but we all know that takes effort."}
{"text":"Amazing. Great ambiance, fabulous food, and their drinks are to die for. Don't forget the stuffed dates. You won't be disappointed. Can't forget how affordable this place is. What are you waiting for?"}
{"text":"The food was amazing and delicious. Service was exceptional as well as the drinks. Mojitos were stout!"}
{"text":"With 985 reviews under my belt, my friends handed me the task of picking a place to eat on a Friday night.  \"Keep it cheap, but not too cheap\". \"Classy but not stuffy\".  \"I want MEAT\".  \"Something off the strip\".  \"$20 entrees, plus drinks.\"  \"Dude, we trust you\".  Ok, I got this.

The reviews were, in the words of Vin Scully, \"remarkable\".  Two $$. Good looking pictures (food porn).  Easy to make reservations for a party of eight.  My wife and I were the first to arrive and we had the choice of inside or outside.  The bar area is gorgeous, the inside had cool music and a classy vibe but the patio was perfect for us.  We are a loud group so we wanted to feel more comfortable.  Red and white lights above us on the canvas patio cover.  Very simple, kind of cool.

Service was prompt and efficient.  The tapas were amazing.  Top picks were the hot cheese dishes with chorizo, bacon wrapped dates and tuna tartare.  The highlight was the paella.  We had one with seafood and another with chicken and mushroom.  Killer dishes.  3 pitchers of different sangria so made us all fuzzy and happy.

The desserts were plentiful and the banana Nutella dish was a standout dish.  In truth, I was pretty buzzed to remember too much but all of my friends had a great time.  About $40 per head including booze, tax and tip.  Winner winner tasty dinner."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE Firefly.  I come here pretty frequently, only because my friends from out-of-town have fallen in love with the restaurant just as much as I have and always need to get their fix whenever they come into Vegas.  This place can get pretty packed and wait times can be crazy around dinner time, but trust me.. if you've got the time, it's worth it!  

I almost always get... 
- calamari
- stuffed dates
- mushroom tart
- ceviche
- mac & cheese
- filet mignon sliders
- steamed mussels
- firefly fries
- sparkling sangria 

The spread that's given with your breads is also heaven, mmmm."}
{"text":"After FireFly had their little health code shut down i thought I'd never be back, but they turned it around and have the best Sangria and awesome tapas for cheap which make for a great meal. The stuffed dates and chorizo stuffed mushrooms were most memorable dishes of the 10 or so we tried. Every dish was quickly served and  flavored to perfection. if you've never been its amazing and for return visitors the newly remodeled Firefly makes for an impressive venue for a date or just a casual hangout with good friends. awesome job!"}
{"text":"I went here on the recommendation of a local buddy, and it was CROWDED. But that's okay! We sat at the bar and talked with the bartender, and we were comfy and still got all of that AMAZING food. Honestly, it was all so good that it is kind of a blur of gluttony and satisfied drooling in my mind. I do remember getting the bacon-wrapped stuffed dates of course - DELICIOUS, but also something I make at home (VERY easy, try it yourself!), so if you know how to make these too then I would order other things. Basically I wanted to try everything on the menu! I also remember getting these cheese-stuffed red peppers, patatas bravas, stuffed mushrooms and camarones al ajillo. What can I say? This place made me happy. I would recommend this location over the newer downtown one because the downtown one has a limited menu. I live in LA and I have yet to find a tapas place here as good as Firefly in LV. Basically, I will now go to this restaurant every single time I visit LV, perhaps even more than once per trip. I'd rather pay to eat what I know will be great food than overpay for some mystery restaurant that may or may not be good. Drool...."}
{"text":"We arrived a little before the late happy hour time, but since we asked information about it the waiter was so nice to give us the HH menu and wait until the clock struck the hour to take our orders!

The ambience/atmosphere is pretty cool, I liked it. It is a perfect place for a couple or for a small group of good friends. The service was good, fast and not too oppressive. The only negative note to it is that at the end of the meal the waiter took my husband's glass away before he had actually finished his beer!

Anyway, I'm giving 5 starts also because of the food: it was really tasty, fresh and well prepared and presented. We tried a few tapas - some of them in HH too, GREAT deal! - and the empanadas were probably the best, so give them a try. I enjoyed my red sangria as well.

The place is a drive away from Las Vegas' center, and that means it isn't crowded. Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"After much consideration, my fiancé and I decided on Firefly for our wedding rehearsal dinner in September 2011. We had been to both locations numerous times and loved the food. The management was very helpful in planning the event, picking out menu items, reserving the private room, etc. At the rehearsal dinner (the night before our wedding) everything went wonderfully, all of our guests had a great time and enjoyed the food... UNTIL 10+ of our guests came down with horrible FOOD POISONING the night of our wedding! Both of my parents, my sister, my fiancé's mom, members of the wedding party, and friends from out of town, all became severely ill, to the extent of visiting the hospital emergency room! My family was so ill that they were not able to see family and friends that had come in town for the first time in years.  Once we realized exactly what happened we called and spoke with the restaurant manager who, when first hearing the story, did not seem all that surprised. He offered to speak with his boss and get back to us. When we finally heard back (after having to track him down) he offered to do NOTHING!  Not even an apology!  After spending quite a bit on this dinner only to have our family and friends fall ill, I was amazed.  This is the first Yelp review for me, I just had to let others know. Do not plan a special event at this restaurant!"}
{"text":"As soon as knew I was going to Vegas I bookmarked this place.  
I read the reviews, saw the pictures, and knew I had to try it.

I did not have a lot of time in Vegas, just going for a trade show, during the week, and only time off for dinner.
First night I attempted to go, place was booked for a private event and wait time was over an hour.  I didn't give up, next day, I went a little earlier and was able to find a spot at the bar.

I was greeted immediately, and given both the happy hour menu and food menu.
I love Tapas style restaurants, gives you an opportunity to try many different things, especially if sharing.  
Since I was traveling solo, I didn't get to order many things but what I did, I absolutely loved.

I started with one of their specialty sangrias, the sparkling one.  Very well balance between the wine and peach flavor, plus all the fruit.  It's a little too sweet for me but very refreshing and I would order it again.  

While enjoying my Sangria, I looked over the food menu and decided on the Mushroom and Steak kabobs, and the Manchego Mac N Cheese.  
They didn't take too long to come out, and they served them almost at the same time so I was able to have them as a meal.  Protein and it's side dish.
The steak, I ordered medium-well, was soft, juicy and very flavorful.  The mushrooms were decent size, and so delicious with the steak.
The Mac N Cheese was crunchy on top, perfect amount of cheese...  maybe if I would have stopped eating this I would have been able to try something else but I just couldn't.  

Before I was able to finish my meal, the sangria was done.  Instead of ordering another one, I saw their other specialty are mojitos...  and, they have a passion fruit one.  I just HAD to order it, and absolutely LOVED it!  The passion fruit flavor (my favorite fruit) really comes through, and it's not drowned in sugar/ simple syrup (like many places do).  I like it's natural tartness, and love when people don't mess with it.  Extra points for that!

The food was amazing, service was friendly & quick, and on top of that, I got to talk with some fun people sitting at the bar near me.  
So glad I went again that night and got to enjoy this place.  Definitely a must and permanently on my list of restaurants to visit in Vegas."}
{"text":"I love firefly. If i have any family or friends out of town, I always bring them here because it's always a crowd pleaser. No matter what you get, the food is amazing. Their sangria's and mojitos are awesome. The restaurant itself is very trendy, full of life, and really noisy if it gets too busy. I love this place. I think it's one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas."}
{"text":"Great tapas! The atmosphere was up scale causal. It is just off the strip so it was easy to get to and had a bit more relaxed atmosphere. Favorite dishes were the scallops escargot and rib eye."}
{"text":"Service was excellent! The ambiance has a very cool vibe. Love the red! The drawback was the food. The tapas were just ok. Nothing fabulous. We had the lamb sausage and it was tasty with the goat cheese. Also had the mushroom pastry that was a little bland. The biggest upset of the evening was the 40 min wait for the WORST PAELLA ever! Undercooked, starchy mexican flavored rice with overcooked seafood, chicken and meats was so unexpected. There was not one spice of saffron in the rice and we were super disappointed. It might be a good place to drink but not eat."}
{"text":"Great food, amazing mojitos. Busy location. On a Friday or Saturday you better have reservations. The bar seating area is very noisy with a lot of people walking all around you. This location is best enjoyed midweek in the dining area. Can't think of a better place for a Tuesday date night."}
{"text":"Used to come here all the time but waited after all those people got sick. The new place is better and bigger visual wise. The firefly fries and stuffed dates were on point! The sangria is the same and I had two glasses. My sliders had chewy meat so I gave up on those and my boyfriend didn't like his chicken empanadas. He got ahi tuna and he ate the whole thing and like it! We got the peppers and they were delicious! We got the dessert platter but next time I'll just get tres leches. Coming back again ."}
{"text":"I never actually went there. I called because Yelp showed it was very busy. I asked if they had a waiting list I could put my name on or reservations. She said you have to check in there. I explained I had a disability and cannot stand. I asked if there was seating for people waiting. She said yes but they would not make sure I was able to sit. I again explained that I wanted to come but that I cannot wait. She suggested I go elsewhere then. Her tone was very rude. She certainly has no empathy for people with disabilities. It is a very poor reflection of the establishment. I do not plan to go there now."}
{"text":"I'm not saying this is a good thing, but Firefly is the first place I've ever gotten drunk!! The food was incredible here. We ordered several tapas and a pitcher of raspberry mojitos. I would love to tell you all the dishes we tried, but I don't think I can remember them all. I know we had a vegetable empanada, an apple salad, mini steak sandwiches, baked goat cheese and diablo shrimp. Each dish was wonderful. We will definitely return when we head back to Vegas."}
{"text":"My wife is pregnant and we were on our babymoon in Vegas for a week. We had a great time and I thoroughly enjoyed the food, but I need to give this a 1 start given that if we had eaten a week later, this salmonella outbreak could have caused immeasurable harm to our child."}
{"text":"My husband and I made a super last minute decision to try Firefly after every other dinner option we'd considered failed. I mean, it was on my list of places to try... but I wasn't explicitly in the mood for tapas that night until we checked Open Table and found they had a table available at 10:15.

We were seated right away, and a waiter magically appeared seconds later to take our drink orders, before I'd even opened the drink menu! I'm glad I took a second to peruse it because they have three different kinds of sangria and I decided to try the sparkling first. I wouldn't get it again; it was more like a sweet cocktail than I'd expected (I swear there was midori in there) but the yummy red sangria I had next made up for it. The red sangria is GOOD STUFF.

We were really hungry so we ordered like 6 dishes and enjoyed them all. We had the tiera y mar skewers (steak and shrimp with chorizo), baked tetilla, patatas bravas, crab claw corn dogs (i LOVED these), lobster \"escargot\" (little lobster knobs in a scampi or de joghne-like sauce) and shrimp ceviche. Everything was delicious! 

The only thing really lacking was the service- the two girls at the hostess stand ignored us and kept right on chit-chatting for a couple of minutes when we first walked in, and our waiter could've been friendlier, but it was nothing egregious and the food and sangria is good enough for me to come back MANY times."}
{"text":"Firefly is one of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas and I love their food and sangria SOO MUCH. I haven't really tried anything from their menu that I dislike and I love it! Favorite dishes: stuffed dates, tuna tartare, baked tetilla, manchego mac 'n' cheese, lobster escargot, camerones a la diabla, croquetas, the filet sliders... basically everything.  But I have to give this location one star off because it's near the strip so it's SUPER CROWDED and as a result the service can be a little slow. Also there are a number of sketchy characters in the parking lot (one guy came up to my car to ask me for money, another one yelled at my husband and called him a heathen??!).

BUT they are open later than the other locations which is good for me and my late night tendencies! And it's Firefly so still super yummy."}
{"text":"Incredible food at great value.  Terrific sangria and a massive selection of tapas that includes some real winners.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Nice place, great vibe, loud , and the food well the 4 stars are for the food, it is tasty but the meals are  small."}
{"text":"The smoked salmon bagels and ceviche of shrimp were both a hit with my friend and I. The bar serves drinks with style and a little something extra each time. It's definitely a cute place to bring someone out for a fun little date night."}
{"text":"Off the strip and to my recollection, the first time I've eaten at a LV restaurant with a very diverse crowd ( ie Gay, Straight). The atmosphere is drak, colorful, salsa music playing loudly- its a great place. The food makes it really cool. Bacon wrapped dates, savory chicken skewers and a delicious even cooked calamari. Fries were spot on, the sangria was good. Good place"}
{"text":"I didn't hear about this place's \"storied\" history until I had already been here and decided I loved it (for more info, read the 1 star reviews or google it). Lucky me - I may not have ever come otherwise. This review is only for my experiences, which have been top notch. 

That being said - this is now just about my favorite restaurant in Vegas. Very reasonable prices, a great selection (i haven't had anything on the menu that i didn't like - and Ive had a lot), and fantastic service. 

Highlights:

-Tortilla espanola
-Shrimp ceviche
-Tierra y mar skewers

Come here with a group that's hopefully not too picky, and try as much on the menu as you can until you can't eat anymore. The waiters are very happy to help you through this process and make suggestions for you too. 

Cool atmosphere and an extensive beer and wine selection on top of all that. Tapas + Rioja + sobremesas = happy Kurt G. 

Also - the bathroom smells like Sweetarts. Not sure how i feel about that yet, but thought it deserved mentioning."}
{"text":"This place is not far at all from the strip, so people without cars can make the lil trek up here, too.

Come during hh, when all drinks are half off from 3-5pm. I got the sparkling sangria for $3.50, which was sweet and tasty! The steak and mushroom skewers were super filling, loved how the mac n cheese came out hot and crispy, and those dates were unique. Btw I LOVED the bread with the almond butter (had about 8 or so slices of it!).

We all only needed about one dish to get pretty full. Yummm I'll be back!"}
{"text":"We tried to get a reservation but they were booked, but we decided to try our luck at the door. We waited a good half hour, but it was totally worth it!

We started with a pitcher of their red sangria. $28 and two of us couldn't finish it, and we love Sangria! They marinate it for 3 days and it's delicious, full of apples but not too sweet. Great bargain, easily good for 3 people!

We ordered a variety of plates, all of which were reasonably priced and delicious!

Apple and Manchego Salad - $4.00. Really different, with tiny strips of apples and manchego cheese, with a light dressing and a hint of almonds. Not like anything else I've ever had. 5 stars!

Tuna Tartare - $8.00. A nice portion with an unusual taste. I found it light and pleasant, and I normally don't enjoy any type of raw fish at all. 5 stars.

Mushroom Tart - $7.50. Light pastry with mushrooms and boursin cheese and some sort of sauce that was delightful. Thoroughly enjoyed. 4 stars.

Baked Tetilla - $8.00. A cheese fondue type dish with tomoatoes and toast. It was good, although probably my least favorite dish of the night. Nothing special, but certainly not bad. 4 stars.

Ham & Cheese Croquettas - $5.00. 3 small but delicious croquettas that we totally inhaled. Absolutely a must! 5 stars.

Steak & Mushroom Skewers - $8.50. Absolutely heavenly. Tender steak, huge mushrooms, and an amazing creamy red wine sauce that just melted in your mouth. AWESOME! 5 stars.

Dessert Platter - $12.00. We had flan, passion fruit cheesecake, chocolate tres leches and lemon-berry tarts. The flan was delightful--light and caramely and flavorful. The passion fruit cheesecake was really different, a hint of the fruit and lots of cream! chocolate tres leches is definitely not my thing, although my dining partner liked it--I thought the chocolate took away from the dish (least favorite thing I ate all night). Lemon-berry tarts were wonderful! Light and tart and creamy! good value!

We heard about this place from a waiter on the STrip who said this is where locals eat--you need to eat here!"}
{"text":"This place is the shiiiiiiiiit.

My first time in Las Vegas, so we decided to go off the strip and get some tapas. I've had the real thing in Spain so I was a little cautious as to their food and what they considered \"authentic tapas.\" The place is very quiet and intimate, which was a great departure from the hustle and bustle of the strip. 

Do I remember what I ate? Nope. All I know is that every single thing I had was delicious. The sangria was delicious and very dangerous because it tasted like juice and I had to ask the waiter twice if they had put alcohol in it. 

The kicker was the dessert, I'm a Nutella stan so I tried the Banana Nutella Sandwich...the gates of heaven opened, angels sang, and my life is complete. 

I would recommend reservations just in case."}
{"text":"Great lively atmosphere, good drinks, cool hangout spot for small groups. Too bad Latin Night (Salsa dancing) wasn't profitable enough for the place, so it got shut down, but next time I'm in LV, I'll def come back."}
{"text":"Use any excuse to check out the new Firefly on Sahara in Summerlin.  It's a larger space than the one on Paradise and I think it's great for kids.  
I came here for lunch to meet up with an old friend at noon and right before the lunch crowd started to come through... it never got to full capacity but it did get pretty busy.  Service was good, but you can tell the hostess and wait staff were still tryin to get the feel on how to best service the guests (asking every 5 minutes if were ok and if we needed anything)...

Since there was only two of us, we shared 4 dishes.  We ordered the babyback ribs, mac n cheese, thai beef salad, and terra y mare skewers.  I thought it wasn't going to be enough for us but it was just right.  Every dish was so good - just like on Paradise.  It was my first time having the mac n cheese and it had really good flavor.  The Terra y Mare (filet mignon steak, shrimp, chorizo) skewers i felt were a just a lil overcooked but all else was great and pretty much melted in your mouth.
Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"You must order the bacon-wrapped dates w blue cheese and almond. Great music, atmosphere and staff. Outside patio area when weather is nice. The chicken salad and the filet sliders are also a must at Firefly Sahara on the west side.  And of course, if you are thirsty, their mojitos and sangria will hit the spot."}
{"text":"Lovely and inventive tapas. We shared tender octopus, roasted potatoes, skewers with shrimp, sausage and filet and amazing shrimp and mangos with soy ginger sauce.

The sausage was absolutely amazing. Everything was perfectly spiced and prepared. 

The space is an awkward set up and on a cold evening, the wind came through and it was bone chilling."}
{"text":"We went to several restaurants while in Vegas (yes as tourists) this was the only one that was any good.  If you're looking to find something off the strip that's good and not a mortgage payment, check out Tapas."}
{"text":"Tried this place out for a vendor lunch while attending a local event at the convention center. Was hesitant as all we had heard was about the sick outbreak some time ago, but was willing to give it a try. 

We were seated on the patio and the environment is great, but the food was not. We had 10 people in our party and no one was super excited about their lunch choices. 

With all the amazing food places to choose from in Vegas, would not recommend or return to Fire Fly. Quality of food is not worth the price tag."}
{"text":"From California to Vegas my best friend who now lives in Vegas took us here. . . and after reading the reviews I knew we wouldn't be disappointed! Sure enough, my fellow Yelpers you were RIGHT!!! It definitely lived up to its reviews! 

It was happy hour so we were in luck! The three us best gals shared a pitcher of their White Sangria which was mighty tasty.

We had:
Camarones a la diabla [I think out of everything we tasted this was the best plate. What really made this dish as delicious as it was, was the spicy chili sauce which was YUMMMYY!!]
Fried calamari [Calamari was good buy not anything exciting but like the Camarones a la diabla it was the SAUCE that made it delicious!!]
Roasted eggplant cannelloni [I don't plan on getting this again, I love eggplant but the goat cheese was overwhelming]
Firefly*fries [Never can go wrong with fries and the sauce!! Yummy!! AGAIN]
Stuffed dates [Bacon wrapped stuffed dates sounds good if you look the salt & sweet combination but the dates were too much for me! ]

All in all although I wouldn't try 3/5 of the plates again, I do want to go back and try everything else they have because the service was great and for the plates we tried that I liked. . well I LOVED!! 

Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This is a great Tapas bar!  They have a nice wine selection and many different tapas to choose  from.  The server was very helpful, but when I asked him what was good, well he seemed top like everything on the menu.  I can see why, because everything we ordered was very good.  I guess our favorite was the apple manchego salad, but I think you can't go wrong.  Great service, nice atmosphere, we will definitely return."}
{"text":"Food is good, but service is kinda a joke. I feel very disappointed for coming back to this place. We sat down for a while before our server approached us and we barely see that person through out rest of the dinner time. We had to ask someone to refill out water and that person never returned back to our table.  One server stood close to us once a while to watch a game that was playing on the tv which located right above my friends head.  Asked for the bill and took forever to get it. I feel like we spent most of our time just waiting around for someone to serve us. We did not enjoy our time at all. I'm very surprised to see this kind of service here. I will not recommend it to my friends and family.  There are many places in Vegas that provides great food with great service. I would not come back to this place again."}
{"text":"Finally made it to the downtown Firefly location. Friday night reservations at 6:30 for a party of 4.

HITS
- gazpacho: delicious
- stuffed dates: the dates might be a little small but they're amazing. Love the blue cheese and red wine reduction
- veggie empanada: 2 empanadas filled w/ a gooey and tasty mix of spinach, mushrooms, artichokes and cheese
- ham and cheese croquetas: 3 of them fried perfectly with a delicious ham and cheese mixture inside
- chicken and chorizo stuffed mushrooms: one of the best dishes of the night
- crispy duck rolls: 1 large roll over stuffed with duck and cut diagonally lengthwise. Wonderful flavor.
- fried calamari: good, but nothing special
- chocolate cherry bread pudding: the bread pudding was delicious, but I wasn't crazy about the cherry sauce and port reduction. Tasted a little too tart.
- passion fruit mini chesecakes: 3 small cheesecakes. I couldn't really detect the passion fruit flavor. Tasted like plain cheesecake to me.
- white sangria: 2 people can easily finish off one pitcher -- it comes out to about 4 glasses per person.

MISSES
- steamed mussels: beautiful presentation, awful 'rancid-fish' taste
- ahi tuna skewers: decent flavors, but there was too much going on. Too many ingredients. It looked like a big mess

The service was great. We had a cute blonde waitress named Ferrin (no idea how to spell that) who was quick to greet us and take our orders. Food came out really quickly. It actually would have been better if they spaced out the dishes a little more so we could enjoy two or three dishes at a time and hang out longer. I think we had all of our dishes (except for the desserts) within 30 minutes, which made for a quick dinner. Our waitress was always around, asking how our food was and refilling our glasses. I never had to refill my sangria all night. That's good service.

The mussels were so bad that we only ate one and had to send it back. Ferrin was cool about it, apologizing for the taste, taking it off the table, and more importantly taking it off of our check. She made a few good suggestions for alternate dishes and quickly brought out a new dish after we ordered it.

As other reviews have mentioned, the atmosphere is cool -- a glass dome overlooking Fremont Street. We were seated in a booth which gave us a great view. There was some country music award show in town and a country band playing on Fremont Street so there were stetsons-aplenty down there.

I really wanted to give this place five stars because some of the dishes were great and the service was wonderful. But because a couple of the dishes weren't good they'll have to settle for 4."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! I've been to all of their locations including the new Taco & Beer place and I have always gotten great service, and even better food and drinks! You HAVE to try the lamb. I usually don't care for lamb but LOVE theirs. It's a perfect place to go before or after you hit the strip for your night out. Maybe they've gotten some bad press but considering that I've taking my family and friends there with me for two years and never experienced anything bad I have to say theirs might actually be a case where mistakes were made but were fixed and learned from. I'll be going back again, and again."}
{"text":"Hubby and I met up with some friends for a birthday dinner here. We had a reservation, but still had to wait for our table in the bar area which is pretty common on a Friday or Saturday night. The bar is big, busy and can get crowded. They have several options when it comes to hot and cold plates to share. We tried and shared several dishes from the menu and most everything was well liked. 

Garlic Bread with Sweet Almond Butter - This was brought at the beginning of the meal and it's oh so addicting! Very very good. 

Ham and Cheese Croquetas ($6) - Serrano ham and manchego cheese. These were tasty! Comes with 3 croquetas. Why oh why couldn't you put 4 on the plate to even things out? Lol. They are a decent size and best eaten right away while hot. 

Roasted Beets and Persimmon Salad ($9) - Star anise, mixed greens, pecan crusted goat cheese, beets, persimmon and balsamic-pear vinaigrette. The greens were a tad too salty on this dish, but everything else was very good. 

Mushroom Tart ($10) - This was a well liked dish at our table and now we know to order more of it next time! It came with 4 puff pastries covered in a delicious mushroom sauce and it also had some cream cheese. Everything melded well together and I wanted to lick the plate. 

Stuffed Dates ($6.50) - You get 5 bacon-wrapped dates each stuffed with a smoked almond in a red wide reduction and sprinkled with blue cheese. This is one of the most popular items on the menu and with good reason. The stuffed dates here are some of the best that I have had and even when I see Firefly at Bite of LV or some other event around town I have to stop by and grab some of their stuffed dates. These tasty gems shouldn't be overlooked when ordering from the menu. 

Baked Goat Cheese ($8) - Goat and garlic cream cheese in a boat of tomato sauce that's drizzled with pesto and served with toast. My hubby really liked this dish while I didn't like it much at all. I personally didn't taste any garlic it was just plain cream cheese. I did enjoy the bread that came with it. 

Stuffed Peppers ($8.50) - 3 good sized Spanish piquillo peppers stuffed with fresh mozzarella and garlic cream cheese on a bed of tomato sauce and topped with green onions and crispy onions. This was a very good dish and well liked by others in our group. 

Serrano Sliders ($9) - 2 mini burgers with serrano ham, cabrales bleu cheese and a side of crispy onions. These sliders tasted great, but where was the ham? I'm not sure if the ham is mixed with the burger and then cooked or if it's supposed to be slices on the slider, but there was no visible ham or none that could be tasted in the mini patty itself. Still tasty regardless however with serrano  in the name I would expect more of a piggy flavor. 

Someone in our group brought a birthday cake from a local bakery and the restaurant had no problem slicing it up and serving it to us on their dishes after our meal. Service was good and the menu is priced fairly. Definitely a great place for large groups."}
{"text":"Love this place, my favorite dishes: 
Papas bravas, croquetas.
Friaday night: Salsa music do you can dance all night.
The only thing: they no bring the food to the terrace on Friday night, you have to purchase at the bar, and it could be inconvenient. 
Service is good"}
{"text":"My husband found this place on the whim while we were in Vegas. We took our friends there and had the most amazing meal! All the dishes were bursting with flavor, freshness, and heat! This place isn't on the strip so parking was a breeze. Will be back the next time I'm in town. The wait staff was attentive and friendly. The reception could use some work but I'm judging this place on the food so I would override that mishap. Don't forget to order the paella in advance 'cuz it takes ~40 mins to make. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Nothing says \"I love you\" like great tapas and sangria. Did I mention the bacon wrapped dates stuffed with almonds in a red wine reduction? They were a damned fine start. 

Who'd a thunk Mac n cheese at a Mexican themed joint would be good, well it was. Correction it was great (especially after a wee pinch o salt).

Did I mention the bacon wrapped dates?

And our starter was the manchego and apple salad. I wanted a big bowl of it. It was lightly dressed with chopped, toasted nuts atop. I am going to make that at home - twice.

Did I mention the bacon wrapped dates? Maybe?

Go. Have fun & eat like a local in Vegas. Bring some friends and sit in the gangster alcove in the back."}
{"text":"I love this place! Every time I come here I am never disappointed! Thank you for your great food and service Fire Fly!"}
{"text":"My date and I checked this place out on a late Wednesday night.  I'm new to tapas but she wasn't.  We both enjoyed this place though I have to say it was way too cool for a self-professed nerd.  The clientele varied, but more and more club-bound groups came in as the night grew later.

For the amount of food we ate (2 sangria, 7 dishes including paella) our bill came out to a very reasonable $60 without tip.  The hostess was polite and the wait staff was one of the most attentive and efficient crew I've ever seen. Even they looked like they enjoyed working the place.

Take a cab to Firefly as the restaurant shares a strip mall with it's sister restaurant Dragonfly and a Ruth Chris's.  Parking is crowded.  Don't worry about finding a cab to your next destination; with the number of restaurants in the immediate area there are always two or three cabbies idling in the lot."}
{"text":"Ordered 8 dishes. Steak was over cooked then what i asked for. I am a chef myself so my critism is slightly high, but the food was ok. The shish kabob was fantastic, but as for the rest, not worth going back a second time."}
{"text":"happy hour til 6pm! woohooo! all drinks half off!

we had the white, red AND sparkling pitchers of sangria. YUMMM-O! my favorite was the white and sparkling.  they dont put overly excessive amount of fruits in the sangrias like some places do which makes drinking them much better than eating our drinks.

good foods:

- paella
- tuna tartare
- stuffed mushrooms
- meat empanadas

free - bruschetta with olives and some sort of cheese spread.

i LOVE the ambiance and the casual seating in the lounge. its a dark, romantic and cozy place. price is not too bad but expect to pay between $4-10 per tapa dish....could be more for the obvious pricey dishes.  location is a bit hard to find since they dont have huge flashing signs.

*featured on food networks \"$40 a day\"*"}
{"text":"I've been to Firefly before, at their smaller location a few years back. We were in town for the weekend for Mr Olympia and to celebrate our post-wedding bachelor/bachelorette so i wanted to come back and try their new larger location.

i made a reservation for Saturday at 8PM and we drove up right at that time. They had our table all ready and set up with no wait time at all. The restaurant is definitely much bigger and nicer than their previous spot. 

I absolutely love sangria so naturally, the beau and I ordered a glass each of the red sangria ($7 each). Some of the others in our party ordered the mojitos which I tried as well.  Both drinks were delicious and refreshing!

For food, he and i had the chicago beef bocadillos, chorizo plate and huevos estrellados. i'm a meat eater, give me lots of protein...and all the dishes we had was perfect! i also had a little taste of the dishes my friends ordered which included stuffed dates, chicken skewers, steak & mushroom skewers and baby back ribs. OMG, i was seriously in tapas heaven! the portions are much bigger than what you'd expect too so be prepared to share!

we really wanted to order the paella but knowing it would take a long time to prepare and we had to places to go, we decided not to order it this time.

the service was good, the food delicious, the drinks strong and made to perfection. it was absolutely one of the best dining experiences, especially with good company! Seriously, this is the one of the best places to eat off the strip!"}
{"text":"I give this place a 5 star for food, but 1 star for service.

 We ordered 4 different tapas, as well as alcoholic beverages. The Sparkling Sangria was nice, lots of fresh fruit inside.  The stuffed dates are a must. Tuna Peppers were quite tasty with just the right amount of spice. The fish sticks were delicious with a nice sauce for dipping.  And the Lamb Skewers were also very good, cooked to perfection. 

 However, once the waiter dropped off our food, he never checked in on us again. I expect a waiter to come by within at least 10 minutes of getting your food.  If he had, we would have ended up ordering another order of the stuffed dates, as well as another round or two of drinks.  But instead, 20 minutes after dropping off our food, we had to flag him down just to get our check.  It was not busy inside at all, so there was really no excuse for such crap service.  He had 0 personality, which was surprising considering his very exciting hair. 

But like I said, the food was amazing, but our waiter ruined the whole experience.  I would come back, as long as I don't have him again."}
{"text":"I was shocked to see the one review about poor service-- the service is actually the reason I bumped this place up one star! Maybe you have to stay away from the girls? ;D  Our one waiter and two busboys were that perfect balance of super attentive + totally on top of the refills, but without being in your face all the time.

The Tapas were all pretty decent, but the Stuffed Dates, Albondigas & Camarones a la Diabla (especially THAT one!) were stand-outs IMHO. The straight up Mohito is tasty and the Passion Fruit Mini-Cheescakes were different (in a good way).

Use valet if parking looks impossible..."}
{"text":"I've come here twice and would recommend Firefly to others! It's about an 8 minute uber from the strip but worth making the trek to visit. The house made sangria is a must try! This is a tapas (small / sharing plates) style restaurant, which is great for any type of occasion. Tons of vegetarian options, but plenty of options for the meat eaters alike."}
{"text":"PRICEY. 

I came her because ever since I was in college everyone raved about how good this place was. It's been 8 years since and I have to say the price definitely outweighs the flavor here. It's tapas style where everything is a appetizer and you order a bunch to share. We order about 7 dishes and really only enjoyed 2:

Mushroom Tart
Lemon Butter Cod 

The rest just wasn't worth the $8 price point. For example, the chorizo mushroom cap was literally 4 small BUTTON mushrooms. 

Extra star because service was good."}
{"text":"Food, good.
 - Bacon wrapped dates, stuffed mushrooms,  skewers, spinach salad.

Drinks, good.
- Red wine Sangria

Dessert, eh.
- forgot.

Service, good.
 - Prompt and friendly.
 
View, good.
- Booth faced Fremont Street"}
{"text":"I cannot recall the name of the dish I ordered but its a steak dish with potatoes and Marsala sauce. Anyhow, completely different from the one at their Paradise location. Same menu, prepared completely different. 

Service:
Very slow and waitress was not very nice. She snapped at me when I told her dish was prepared completely different from Paradise location. She said it wasn't possible because they use same recipe. She didn't ask if I wanted anything else, instead I brushed it off and ate it anyway. Later, she comes back and apologized after confirming with Paradise location they do in fact prepare differently. Again, she did not offer to bring something else. 

Conclusion: 
Sangria is awesome. I love this place, just not this location. To wrap up my story with cherry on top; we come to find out later the the restaurant gave themselves a $20 tip! Of course we disputed this charge and recovered the money but will probably never go back to this location."}
{"text":"My favorite tapas restaurant! I always have to go here when I am in Vegas. Food is amazing! Here are my favorites in order:
- Stuffed Dates
- Manchego Mac & Cheese
- Tierra y Mar skewers
- Scallops Escargot
- Stuffed Peppers
- Pork Empanada
- Mixed Paella (although this is a hit or miss because sometimes it is too salty.. ask for lemons)
- Baked Goat Cheese

Sangria are better than the Mojitos here. Get a pitcher!"}
{"text":"Food is good. The service improves, but staggers to fill their customers needs due to understaffed for the volume of customers. 

Try the sangria !"}
{"text":"I made reservations for 6 for birthday party at 6.30pm (Friday). We got seated today in a cute private booth. 

I love their ambiance, trendy, and dim with lots of Spanish arts on the wall. Outside seatings looked very beautiful.

The waiter suggested their winter Sangria that has pumpkin and cinnamon. It was tasty. I ordered Chorizo clams - the clams were very fresh.

Camarones Al La Diabla - the lemon garlic sauce was flavorful and the shrimp was plump.

The place is great for big groups. It was very loud and packed with big parties celebrating birthdays. Not a place for quiet conversations.

My friends enjoyed their food. If you let them know it's your birthday, they give you a complimentary flan.

The service was top notch. We sat there talking for a while and they didn't rush us."}
{"text":"Our expectations were high after reading the reviews but our expectations were exceeded. Our experience was fantastic from drink to food to service by Alejandro. 
We had 2 martinis that were GREAT. The Scallop Escargot was amazing. We shared 6 different Tapas and every one was so flavorful. 
You will not be disappointed here and the patio is lovely."}
{"text":"I have had tapas in a lot of cities and this place did not disappoint! The menu was huge and the food was amazing. We had the garden variety salad, pork empanada, and salmon bagels. OH and a pitcher of sangria!! They also give free bread with a garlic butter. SO DIVINE! 

Having dinner at Firefly was a great way to spend our first night in Vegas. I would have to say out of all the places we ate in Vegas, it was the best. We will definitely be back next trip!!"}
{"text":"My girl friends and I must have ate Firefly's kitchen out.  We had 10 tapas and a pan of paella for lunch before, of course, dropping our guts at Encore Beach Club.  Sexy! 

The paella is an absolute must-have for $20 (Toto, I've a feeling we're not in San Francisco anymore!).  It was chock-full of clams, mussels, shrimp, calamari, chicken, and chorizo--I couldn't believe there was more seafood than saffron rice.  My favorite small plates were the camarones a la diabla (shrimp in spicy chile sauce), stuffed dates, and chorizo clams.  The shrimp was perfectly cooked in a delectable sauce--after we had all the shrimp, we hung on to the sauce and smothered anything and everything with it.  The dates were small, though tasty and complex.   The clams were in a lighter sauce than the shrimp but also delicious simmered in chorizo and white wine. 

I would skip the roasted baby beet salad, tortilla a la Espanola (Spanish omelette), and the lobster escargots.  There were barely any beets in the salad; the tortilla not only looked but tasted unappetizing; and the lobster escargots were so small I can't even remember their taste.

I've had paella and tapas in Spain and at many memorable restaurants in the US.  Firefly doesn't come close to the top, but the prices are so reasonable (for Vegas!) and the selection is so vast (even the pickiest of eaters can't whine!) that I have to bump this 3-star tapas bar to 4 stars.  Plus, it's nice to leave the Strip for a meal!"}
{"text":"This is the first Mexican Tapas restaurant that I have been to in Las Vegas. I I did not know what to expect. When we watching all of the hostesses and waitresses were extremely friendly. The menu was relatively cheap and had a variety of things that I had never seen before, such as bell pepper tomato soup. We were able to order a wide variety of things and nothing had let me down. The best items on the menu that we had ordered that I would probably have been the bacon wrapped dates or the paella for $26. I would most definitely come here again if I had the opportunity."}
{"text":"Firefly has excellent food when you know what order. Stay away from entree because the tapas are usually delicious. Also the mojito pitchers are delicious. Last time I went it was pomogrante flavor, so good we ordered two. The service is okay but their always super busy."}
{"text":"2nd time here. great food. fast service. great vegetarian items. This time we had patatas bravas and stuffed peppers, and both were great!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the tapas! Plus it has a really fun atmosphere. 

The stuffed dates were amazing! So was the tuna tartare. 

Was a bit disappointed with the chicken stuffed mushrooms. But other than that dish everything was really yummy!!

Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"The Girl and I went to Vegas two weekends ago for a little getaway.  We were going to go to Maggiano's, but a college friend that lives in Henderson recommended this place.  We went with him and his fiancee late Thursday evening.  We were FAMISHED as it was nearly 9pm when we finally started ordering.  As any place in Vegas, it's loud and crowded, so that can't go against them.  It's very dark inside and crowded, but I was digging the atmosphere and the meal was a perfect start to our 48-hour trip.

The four of us ordered TWELVE tapas.  My friend and fiancee had been there twice before so they already have some favorites.  We decided the best thing to do was to each order 3 things.  The Girl and I hadn't eaten for 9 hours and had to run around packing, driving, flying, cabbing, shuttling, checking in so it was a good thing we got so much food.  I was the only one who ordered alcohol (a red sangria, which was pretty good.

So in no particular order, here are the dished and the two desserts with individual ratings.   See my photos for each dish.

01) Spicy Beef Salad. Seared beef, warm dressing, romaine, tomato, cucumber, ginger.  Decent but not memorable. [3/5]
02) Patatas bravas. Roasted red potatoes in spicy aioli.  Fantastic.  Crispy and tasty even without the aioli.  [5/5]
03) Chicken and chorizo stuffed mushrooms.  Very good.  [4/5]
04) Stuffed dates.  Bacon-wrapped, smoked almond, red wine reduction, blue cheese.  These were just ... WOW.  [5/5]
05) Steak and mushroom skewers.  grilled filet, roast garlic cream, red wine reduction.  Good but it sounded better than it was.  [3/5]
06) Manchego mac 'n' cheese.  Excellent.  Almost as good as the mac n' cheese w/ truffle oil at Alexander's.  [4/5]
07) Baked brie.  roasted tomato and cheese fondue with chorizo, toasts.  Pretty good but a little lacking quantity-wise.  [3/5]
08) Roasted eggplant cannelloni.  goat cheese, tomato sauce.  The Girl loves eggplant and this sounded good, but the execution was a bit disappointing.  [3/5]
09) Babyback ribs.  steamed, mango BBQ sauce.  Delicious!  [4/5]
10) Baked Filets of grouper.  marinated with herbs, lemon, garlic.  Actually pretty good for grouper, and a refreshing change of pace from all the strong flavors.  [4/5]
11) Ahi tuna skewer.  mango, basil, mustard-ginger glaze.  Not really that memorable.  [3/5]
12) Petite filet.  mini filet mignon, herb cheese, roasted red potato and mushrooms, red wine sauce.  Wasn't sure if this was actually filet, but very good, very tender.  [4/5]
13) Chocolate and cherry bread pudding.  warm w/port wine reduction.  Not usually a bread pudding fan but it was good.  [3/5]
14) Chocolate \"Tres Leches\" Cake.  Forgot how spongy and sweet (thanks to condensed milk) this is, but once I got the hang of it I was sucking it down.  [4/5] 

Overall, the meal was excellent.  And all that food came to only about $37/person.  Exceptional for Vegas!  I recommended the place to another friend who went this weekend and she really liked it as well.  I'm definitely coming here again.  Firefly is a solid 4 stars!"}
{"text":"This place used to be one of my favorites! But guess what? I was one of the lucky ones who got food poisoning. Obviously, I will never go back to this place or their sister restaurants, the way I felt for a week is not worth the risk. I was there with a friend and we had their sparkling sangria, rib eye steak with fries, stuffed dates, apple and manchego salad and mussels with chorizo.  Their service was great and their food taste as their usual, but unfortunately one day later I ended up getting salmonella. I was at a volunteer event when my symptoms started, I actually had to leave the place and go home because I could not even walk straight.  The diarrhea started when I got home and then the abdominal cramping came, it was as if I were a girl in my period. Gals, I know what you go through and I feel ya! I wish I could recommend this place, but my advice is: EAT THERE AT YOUR OWN RISK!"}
{"text":"A great location that's somewhat off the Strip, but very close to all the major hotels - easily accessible if you have a car.  The bar was a little tight, but it's a very popular location.  Great music, even though when I was eating, there wasn't a live band.  It's not the most authentic Spanish food around, but it's a great departure from the standard steakhouses and buffets in Vegas.

BTW, I realized that if you say \"I'm going to a tapas bar\" that it sounds like something not so innocent.  Good for a laugh or two (but gets old very quick).  It's also a handy way to find out how dirty your friends are.

PROS:
- Reasonably priced (about $25/pp with some drinks)
- Wide variety of choices on the menu
- White wine sangria is very light and easy to drink
- I really liked the empanadas, duck rolls, and 
- In a plaza with several restaurants, including Ruth's Chris - so if there's a long wait, there is always an alternative

CONS:
- The paella was the worst thing I've ever eaten in a tapas bar
- The bruschetta was a close second"}
{"text":"Food was excellent. First time coming to restaurant like this. I was unfamiliar with the food selections. Wait staff was helpful I recommending a couple of plates I would like. Next time I will try the paella."}
{"text":"I loved this place!!!  My girls and I came here when we were in Vegas.  We had a group of 13 and they were sooooo accommodating.  We got our table on time, we got the food quickly, and we had a ton of fun!  The waiters were extremely friendly and interacted with us--which made dinner a lot more fun.  All of the tapas were flavorful, and my favorite part, it was not expensive at all!  I highly recommend."}
{"text":"My family and I ate dinner at this \"off strip\" restaurant on a Saturday night.  The food was really good, and we had a lot of fun trying new things.  Our bill for two adults and one child was only $50, and that included one beer and a dessert.  We would definitely go here again the next time we are in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"first time i actually had tapas was here at firefly in 2008. they were yummy! i loved loved loved the little brie sandwiches with the tomato soup. everything we had was so good! including the sangria! i will definitely eat here again next time i'm in sin city."}
{"text":"I wanted to give this place a better rating.The Fried Calamari was great and loved the fact they have tenticles and okay saice. The Churizo Clams we're probably the best thing we had, really awesome flavor. Wish there were more clams. The ribs weren't as good as I thought, very tender but I felt they tried to mask a lot of taste with all the topping. The Rib bones broke off while I was eating and the meat was burnt. Waiter wasn't really on it, but the inside of the restaurant was very well setup. Wish I had something better to say..."}
{"text":"The food is absolutely amazing!!!! Whoever thought one would get full off appetizers! I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"The waiter was very rude. I knew our party was rather large, but were all very easy and polite. I specifically specified chicken and he brought me pork and tried to deny it. Thankfully he brought out another. The food was very good, but I was not happy at all with my experience here."}
{"text":"This place is always fun. The sangria is great and the food is different than most other restaurants. It's one of my go to stops when Im in Vegas."}
{"text":"We went to Firefly on a Friday night with a group of 6. We ordered about 10 dishes, and everything was delicious, particularly the Korean short ribs, the clams & chorizo, and the baked goat cheese. Even the complimentary bread and almond honey butter was incredible. There wasn't a single dish or drink we didn't love, and the service was fantastic. The atmosphere was great, too... we sat outside and had a great time."}
{"text":"My group had lunch here while at a conference.  The only reason this isn't 5 star is because the food came out in no logical order.  Some of our party were done eating before others got food.  Two people ordered the same thing that came out at different times.  Really not a big deal to me, but 5 star takes perfection.  Wait staff was polite and accommodating.  The food was really, really good."}
{"text":"Well....I can tell you this...I have never eaten at this place...but was looking forward to.  As you know if you are staying in Vegas (i.e. not from Vegas)...and venture off the strip is somewhat cumbersome...even if only a few miles away.  Thankfully we had a car and didn't pay taxi fare.  Shame on me for not calling ahead for reservations...but we did go on the site 2-3 time when deciding on where to eat and this place had NO MENTION that they were going to be randomly closed for the night... a SATURDAY NO LESS (4/27/13)????  WTF?  Obviously this isn't a case of dumb ass tourists either as we were there around 8PM for 10 minutes and no less than half a dozen other cars (with Nevada plates) drove up with the same reaction.  It is close to the strip...though on the other side from where we were staying...but seriously guys...Yelpers seem to love you...but POST ON YOUR SITE IF YOU\"RE CLOSED....dont leave a 8 1/2 by 11 sheet outside your business saying you're sorry but will be closed today!"}
{"text":"Like most people I was a little nervous to consume food here again but I also think once an establishment has been caught doing the unsanitary things that they are guilty of that that they are now on their best behavior.  Firefly's new space is larger often making it look like it doesn't ever get crowded.  I also appreciate the fact that unlike the old location you can actually have conversations here without yelling or feeling like you are sitting on top of each other.  I have now been here for a private function in a back room, sat at the bar for apps and drinks and most recently for a birthday celebration.  

I've never had a problem with service.  The dates used to be my favorite but this last visit they just seemed watered down and I don't think I will order them again.  The mango ribs, however, are a must order."}
{"text":"delicious tapas!! the food was amazing and so was the ambiance of this restaurant. Great for date night, so intimate and some-what dark inside. Great place for dinner and drinks OFF the strip"}
{"text":"Had family in town and was looking for somewhere that would really hit the spot for everyone. I  am so glad to have found another location for this restaurant as the location nearer my house was closed. Firefly has always lived up to my expectations at their now closed Summerlin location, I was extremely pleased to see it carried on in their Paradise location. :) The service is attentive without being overbearing, the food delicious! We left full and happy! Please open in Summerlin again soon."}
{"text":"I asked a friend to take me to somewhere the locals go - I was tired of eating in the casinos, and this is where they brought me.

Just off the strip. Great, flavorful tapas.  Pitchers of Sangria.  This place is great.  Chorizo and Clams, and Bacon wrapped Dates are two of the dishes we had, that I will remember for a long long time...

I look forward to coming back..."}
{"text":"My favorite place off the strip. I had the red sangria, bacon wrapped dates, mac n cheese, lamp chops, and empanadas. ALL were very good."}
{"text":"I went on opentable to book this reservation. 

It was an excellent choice based on all the other yelpers.

Let's start by explaining how we happen to get there.

We were driving North on Paradise and missed the exit to the restaurant. So, we turned right on Twain and then, turned right onto Palos Verdes. Wow! We turned down a street that was like a war zone. There was a gate around the entire street. A police activity was happening. Yellow police signs were cordoned off the sections of the block. Scary. So, don't miss the exit and don't turn on this street.

Back to the restaurant. 

There is plenty of parking. There's also a Citibank in the same parking so you won't have to look for an ATM machine.

The restaurant is small but great atmosphere. Every person in there working is good-looking or gorgeous.

The food is excellent. You should try one from each section. Potatas Bravas is spicy, but excellent. The steak and shimp skewers were very delicious. The caramel flan was excellent, too.

The drinks were excellent.

Our bill for 4 people came to $97.00. I was shocked, because the food was better than David Birk's in the Venetian. I was prepared to pay and arm and a leg for excellent food.

Try everything and enjoy the fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"Yes,  two stars.
I felt compelled to write this review for the fact that it was just a bad experience overall. I eat out, alot. I frequent new and old establishments.
I eat mom and pop all the way to joel robuchon.
I give everyone a fair chance, and probably me being in the industry is not going to help this review at all, however...

Upon entering Firefly last night, there was no greeter for 4 minutes in a small lobby area that had no one present but myself and my girlfriend.
When the hostess finally sat us, we waited 10 minutes before anyone remotely attended to us. When that person came, it was for bread on the table. Then....the wait, another 10 minutes and still no service,even for drinks.
When my girlfriend spoke up, it was to another server who took our drink order AND our tapas selections. He told us, this was not his section, however..he put the order in and informed us that our \"server\" would be taking us through the remainder of our meal.
We Thanked him and soon after, our plates arrived, rather quickly I might add.
I must say, I am glad we only ordered 5 plates. Everything was either a fried element or had some sort of fried item in the food. 
At best, it was \"ok\". 

The Thai beef Salad tasted boring. No real essence of Thai at all. The beef almost tasted poached with no char,which could be from the over saturation of dressing. The dressing itself needed something to balance the acidity,perhaps a sweetness [which I am assuming was the purpose of the pickled ginger, is that even really \"Thai\"]
And the crispy wonton was over exposed and just way to much.

The empanada ..all I can say is Shame On You! Creme Cheese? Really?

The duck rolls were constructed as if it were rillette , almost a puree.
If, and I do stress, it was supposed to be that way, I would suggest learning to confit.

The croquette seemed like fried potato soup with cheese. No real evidence of any ham whatsoever.

About the only thing really \"decent\" was the tempura. Sauce was nice and not to overpowering with citrus segments in it. However, the green onions were left to soak in the grease for way to long and almost tasted burnt.

All the while of eating, I noticed the heavier set man who I am assuming is the FOH manager roaming. He spent most of his time however at a table, picking up a child and speaking to one table and that table alone. Not realizing what his staff is doing.

Now, back to the lack of service. Our waiter who \"should\" have been giving us service in the first place finally arrived at plate number 4.
He saw that most of the plates were left un eaten and suggested that he \"pack\" the food up in a to go box. We declined. He never asked us how our meal was or even why there was an abundance of food left.
You would think someone would get 2 + 2.

It was also a little strange that when the \"original\" order taker asked if my girlfriend wanted a refill on her drink and the busboy delivered it, he prepared to take my beer away in replace,yet, my girlfriends glass was empty [ o , did I mention that I never received the option for a beer glass and just received a bottle], then..the bussboy brought another drink to the table after that. Two drinks in a confusing fashion were delivered. At this point, I was at my limit.

There are smaller points I could make, but I believe I am getting my point across. 
Firefly, this is my second visit. I wont be returning for a long long long time, if ever."}
{"text":"AWESOME!! Loved Firefly and can't wait to go back!! tried a several dishes and enjoyed a sparkling Sangaria. My wife had a mojito tha twas also very good. I wish we saved room for some of the desserts. Service was excellant and the food came out very quickly on a very busy night, which i'm sure most of them are! Here are some of the items we had:
Tuna Peppers
Roasted Baby beet salad
Tuna Tartare
Roasted Eggplant Cannelloni
Mushroom Tart
Firefly Fries
Crispy Duck Rolls.
The Duck rolls were my favorite and the fries..WOW"}
{"text":"i really don't understand the popularity of this place.  my friend and i came here for lunch and we were underwhelmed.  thought the food was subpar and the sangria had bits and pieces of fruit with the edges all brown and gross.  the only redeeming attribute was the al fresco dining and the people watching.  will not be returning"}
{"text":"First time to the downtown location. The service and atmosphere was nothing like Paradise location. Had to remind the staff that is was happy hour, they acted like it was something new. Waiter was friendly but a little slow to respond to a dining area that had 5 tables of eaters(all right next to each other). The food as usual was outstanding.
Service-3
Food-5
Love Firefly!!"}
{"text":"I haven't been here since they moved and I always enjoyed Firefly. A 30 min wait on a Friday was not bad and we were taken to a table within this time frame. We sat and it took  a bit for a server to come over so we made some food decisions before ordering a drink. Finally ordering a mojito it was brought back to the table with the worst sour taste to it. A new one was made with no issues and it was a little better.
 -The food itself was up and down. The fries are always good and the Serrano ham and cheese plate was excellent. The clams with chorizo were bad, the clams weren't cleaned and there was grit in the dish along with broken pieces of shell. The Tierra y mare skewers which are my favorite were so salty I wiped them off with a napkin! just a nightmare.
- service may be the worst. Waiting on drinks and trying to reorder food is like waiting in line at the DMV but with alcohol. Most of the staff was busy talking to a friend who sat at a big booth and sipped water for an hour while other parties waited to be seated. It was nice to see someone was being waited on."}
{"text":"Don't know what it is with any business that starts to expand, but once you open other locations around town, the quality of the food suffers. 

Perfect example is Firefly on Sahara. The only decent items we had were the olives and tomato butter you get in the beginning, and the Bacon wrapped dates.

We ordered the other following items which were a total failure in taste and execution:

Ceviche-totally overkilled with lime juice and you could hardly taste the fish, and where's the salt?

Boquerones- When I ordered these at the Paradise location, the bread was slightly toasted, the roasted pepper vinaigrette was full of flavor, and the Aioli was garlicky and creamy-this time, the bread wasn't even toasted, the pepper vinaigrette was barely noticeable, and the aioli was not only flavorless, but was also runny! Aioli does not run!!!

Mussels-Ever had mussel jerky? They do it very well here. My order was almost all shells. when I did find a mussel, it honestly was the size of a dime!(PLEASE SEE MY PICTURE!!!PLEASE!!!!) To the idiot who doesn't know how to cook mussels properly-They're done right when their shells open!!!!

Pulpo Asado-No charred,grilled taste whatsoever...more like stewed with peppers and sherry vinegar....wtf?????

Firefly Fries- we got these free because the table next to us that did order them already had their order. Cool! Right? WRONG!
drenched in that same tasteless aioli-YUCK!

So our waiter suggests the Chocolate Tres Leches and the Banana-Nutella Sandwiches......sandwiches were forgettable and the tres leches was a total mushy mess! You're better off going to Mariana's or Cardenas and getting the real deal Holyfield Tres Leches at a fraction of the cost.

Why all the 4 and 5 star reviews?????Like Flava Flav says, 
\"Don't believe the hype!!!!\"....ALOHA!!!!!"}
{"text":"I rate this place 4/5, but my husband gives it a 5/5. For starters, the complimentary bread is addictive! For the entrees, my husband ordered the stuffed dates and the filet mignon sliders and thought both were fabulous. The food was hot, tasteful, and the presentation was nice. I ordered the the only entree salad on the menu (with avocado), and loved it. It was heavily tossed in dressing, so request lightly tossed if you don't like your lettuce drenched. This place isn't known for its salad, so I won't complain. The energy level and ambiance are super nice, and the service was top notch. Full of locals - I think we were the only tourists, so that tells me they have a round of regulars. Good sign. Great place."}
{"text":":D :D :D 1) the Tres Leches cake 2) and infused vodka - enough said!"}
{"text":"Great place for Spanish tapas. Everything was very flavorful. I ordered apple manchego salad, chorizo clams, lamb chops, dates - all excellent

Great choice for a light meal of small plates. I would have loved to order dessert but was too full. Topped all off with a glass of dry CAVA"}
{"text":"So I was drunk when we were hear, and memory is an issue, but I really think I judged the food well :) haha!! I loved the bacon dates, the achovies on bread, the steak kabobs, the lamb kabobs, oh crap, I can't remember what else, but I liked everything (a lot), the only thing I didn't love was the apple salad.. it was ok... coulda used a little dressing or honey... 

The atmosphere was nice, the waiter was very cool, the food came fast... GREAT price for such good food, I will be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"The new place is great! Don't know how, but it was even better than the 1st time we went, we tried a lot of tapas, and all were AMAZING! Stuffed dates, patatas bravas. stuffed mushrooms, meatballs, chicken skewers, fries, sardine/anchovie avacado bread, all were so delish! Sangria was out of this world! Banana nutella sandwiches and chocolate tres leches were good, not the best part of the meal, nothing to complain about, but not out of this world.  Our waiter was great also."}
{"text":"Every time I roll through Vegas, this place is a MUST visit! The atmosphere is awesome, with a young crowd and good vibes all around.  The food is reasonably priced and everything I have tried is amazing.  I'm especially a fan of the lobster escargot, the filet mignon sliders, the ahi tartar and the stuffed mushrooms.  I can't wait until I come back so I can eat here again!"}
{"text":"We decided to fuel up at Firefly the night before our all-day climb at Red Rocks.  The first thing I noticed was that it was packed and very loud.  The menu had a wide variety of items, from Spanish to Thai inspired.  We ordered paella, machengo mac & cheese, and the roasted beet salad with goat cheese and carmelized pecans.

The waiter brought out complimentary bread and green olives.  The bread was a run of the mill baguette with a sweet/spicy butter.  Our food came out quickly.  Other than the dressing the salad was quite good.  The sherry vinaigrette was heavy on the vinegar with not much else for flavor.  The machengo mac & cheese was an interesting twist on the comfort dish, although I think there was a missed opportunity for adding in a bit more spice.  The paella was heavy on the tomato and not at all reminiscent of more traditional paellas I have had at other restaurants.  I found the base overpowering and I wouldn't order it again.  Overall: service 4 stars, food 3 stars, atmosphere 2 stars"}
{"text":"I did most of the happy hour menu there with my mom, I think happy hour is from 3 to 6 Mon-Thursday. Everything was $4 to $5 on happy hour menu. The shredded apple salad was delish! Veggie Empanadas were crispy and yummy. The complimentary bread looked amazing, but I am watching my carb intake. The sauces were were flavorful. Overall I would recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I was not impressed this visit. Had the paella with the red sauce. It Was over cooked. Rice was mushy and the seafood was very chewy."}
{"text":"I live in LA and I come to Vegas every year for New Years and this is the one spot that I have to hit up each and every time.

Four words = AMAZINGLY ORGASMICALLY DELICIOUSLY GOOD!!!!

I think by now I've tried all the tapas on their menu already and I would have to give each tapas 5 stars each so that equals out to hundreds of stars total for Firefly. :D

My favorite tapas are:

-Filet Mignon Sliders
-Empanadas
-Fried Calamari
-Chicken and Chorizo Stuffed Mushrooms
-Tuna Tartare 
-Crispy Duck Rolls
-Ham and Cheese Croquetas

Even their fries are off the hook because it has a hint of parmesan, herbs, and aioli and their Mojitos - I can get drunk off of that all day everyday. yUuMmMmmYlicious to EVERYTHING on the menu - no joke!"}
{"text":"I would suggest 10 orders of ham and cheese croquetas. Jessica is the best server on earth."}
{"text":"Loved the food! Delicious!! The ambiance was fabulous!! So glad we heard about this place... We Loved it! Everything was top notch! Will be back again!"}
{"text":"Amazing food & service! If you're looking for a good time and incredible food, this is definitely a place to try. Our group couldn't get over how delicious each plate tasted! My favorite? Definitely the mac & cheese and the chicken empanadas. Absolutely one of the best tapas meals I've had."}
{"text":"Worth a trip off the strip.  Totally worth the $8 cab ride from Ceasar's. Great tapas at reasonable prices.  The food came out quick, which I thought might be a bad sign (i.e., pre-prepared food), but the food was quite good.  

The best dish was the boquerones (Spanish white anchovies served on toast, with roasted red and yellow peppers).  My second favorite was the dates wrapped in bacon and stuffed with smoked almonds, and served with a red wine reduction and blue cheese.  The sweet and salty flavors worked really well with the almonds which gave the dish such a nice crunch.  The ceviche of tiger shrimp and avocado was delish as well--very fresh and tangy.  Unlike another reviewer, we really enjoyed the cheesy mushroom tart puff pastry.  Maybe the shrooms came out of a can, but that was one delish can.  The camarones a la diabla didnt lie--the spicy chile sauce was quite hot and yummy.  For dessert, the chocolate tres leches cake was perfect.  A lot of places really mess this dessert up, but the cake was fresh and milky and to die for.  

The only thing I didnt like was the red wine sangria.  Not enough fruit and the wine tasted kinda heavy-sweet and cheap.  But there's a full bar, so you can get any other kind of drink you want."}
{"text":"Their Happy hour is absolutely amazing. Their mojitos and Sangria are off the charts! 10/10 would go again"}
{"text":"Ok so, bumping you back up. My friends dig it and I very much enjoy your sangria, warm vibes and company Firefly. But don't think for a second you can take my love for granted and start slippin' on me again."}
{"text":"What can say about this place except I LOVE FIREFLY AND THEIR FOOD! I originally had eaten, a while back, at their location they used to have off of Fremont in Downtown Vegas. I fell in love the first moment I had their food. It's hard to find any Spanish restaurant that actually has TRUE Tapas. This place has the best Tapas outside of Spain. The flavor of the food is absolutely mouthwatering and delicious. I have never been disappointed. I don't live in Vegas but when I visit, I have to eat here each time. It's a must!!! If you are vegetarian like me, they have a special menu for you. I wish they had more location but I am grateful for even having this one. The Sangria is also a must. And if you are a fan of Nutella, you have to try their banana Nutella sandwiches! Yummy!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great food, cool atmosphere! Worth the trip off the strip. The food came fast, knowledgeable server."}
{"text":"Super busy on our arrival Saturday night. Met up the birthday boy and friends at 8:30pm. They were already down a pitcher of Mojito, and we quickly ordered another pitcher of Sangria for the table.

I know better than to eat too much before going out dancing so Joy P. and I kept it simple with just an order of ceviche (a little watery), and paella (delicious).  The menu was an interesting mix of spanish, asian, and cuban(?). The other orders basically the rest of menu, and the stand outs were the bacon wrapped dates and ... and i don't remember eating anything else."}
{"text":"I love love LOVE Firefly!!! The food is absolutely delicious, the drinks impeccably refreshing, and the service is speedy. I have never tried a dish that I didn't like, but my favorites and first to recommend would be the Stuffed Dates, Ahi Tuna Skewers, Steak and Mushroom Skewers, Petite Filet Mignon, Stuffed Peppers, and Chocolate Tres Leches Cake. Try it and love it too!"}
{"text":"Everytime i go to Vegas, this is one of my favorite stop.  I absolutely love the food and the service.  I'm not too excited about the waiting, but it's worth the wait.  Best time to go is probably at noon or early evening because anytime later, you will waiting in line. This is not on the strip so do not attempt to walk there.  I wish I had a private chef in my kitchen that can cook like this.  The portions are not too small and each plate have their own special flavor.  If you don't like something, try it anyways, because they would change your mind. For example, I'm not a fan of dates, but the way they make it, I finished the entire thing.  As I'm writing this review, I'm actually thinking about taking another trip!"}
{"text":"Found this place after talking to a girl in killer heels on a bench at the Venetian. She said that they closed late and the food was good so we decided to try it out. 

I am seriously glad we did because this was one of the best tapas bar I have ever been in. The atmosphere was cool and very red, and the food was delicious!! Everything we tried was awesome, and pretty economical. The portions were good, service was great. Overall it was a great experience. Will definitely be coming back here!!!"}
{"text":"Soo NOT disappointing!
I wanted to try so many things but alas, had to start with just a few items, now happily so, because I will definitely be back. This restaurant sits adjacent to one of my crew hotels and I can't wait to get back here.
Beet salad
Tuna tartare
Filet sliders - kinda overdone but still delicious like a mofo
Well done! Every plate was well worth my walk over and my anticipation.
Blue cheese stuffed martini - I wish the olives had a bit more flavor, but still good.
Pear martini - Probably one of the sweetest, tastiest martini's I've ever had.
Everything was bomb diggity! damn
Oh, and the service was prompt and on the verge of splendiferous."}
{"text":"Always great food at Firefly!!  We had the best server her name is Mandy...she was awesome, great personality and good sense of humor... Hopefully she will be working the next time I'm there because she will be requested..cool girl!

Nothing bad to say!  I eaten at Firefly's numerous times over the years and I've never had a bad experience.  

Ask for Mandy if you dine there!"}
{"text":"Food was perfect! Bar staff was super nice! Will come back next time I'm in town. Good place for locals."}
{"text":"Amazing food and Sangria. My favorites are the bacon wrapped dates, lamb chops, and the garlic shrimp. Make reservations if you want to get seated quickly."}
{"text":"I was seeking a unique eating experience off the Strip but special for a day trip to Vegas. My Special Lady Friend hadn't ever had Tapas and Yelp was recommending Firefly so I thought we'd hit it. 

I'd been to a couple of Tapas places but looking on the app I've never seen such an extensive menu with so many types of Tapas to choose from such as Chilled, Seafood, and Meat and Poultry. 

The space is pretty amazing with the romantic atmosphere and these awesome images of Flamenco dancers and Spanish art all over the walls. Great for something romantic or friendly or just stooping in for lunch on a day trip to Vegas. I'd love to come check it out on their Latin Night. The bar is a very stylish installation that should be a wonder when the lights are low. 

Have individual captions on the Tapas that we ate. Our favorites were definitely the Bacon wrapped dates that had a nice, rich sauce to go with it, the Chorizo Stuffed Mushrooms, and the Serrano Ham and Machengo Cheese. Each portion is sizeable and great for two people. The Ahi skewer was actually pretty meaty and nicely packed with fruit and a great garnish that completed the dish. I would have loved to try more of what they had on the menu. 

My one complaint might be that during lunch rush our waitress disappeared for a bit but the bus boys and her fellow waiters made sure to help us out as best they could. 

I'd totally recommend this place and would happily visit again for lunch. Many more Tapas to try."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times now and it has only gotten better. It is a Spanish Tapas restaurant off of the strip with very sensual red lighting and amazing food. I am a big fan of the chicken skewers and the filet mignon especially. The sauces are amazing!!! The strawberry mojitos are off the charts. Super fresh, there is actually real strawberry in it. I love the lemon berry tarts and mini cheesecake!! Very tasty and the serving size is not huge. There's a super neat fish tank in there too. The service is very good, you are never stranded. Firefly will always have a very special place in my heart for more reasons than one."}
{"text":"Tried this on a whim. It was wonderful. We ordered several items and split them. Everything was great with an exception of the fries which were just good. We look forward to going back and exploring even more of the large menu they offer."}
{"text":"The food was great and was really surprised how flavorful and fresh all the food was.Im a picky guy and was quite hesitant to try this place out.When we arrive our car was parked quickly by valet and we were seated promptly.My girlfriend and I enjoyed everything about the mean except out waiter was training a new guy and never really came around,however we were fortunate enough to get a great busser who picked up all of the servers slack while he was flirting with his coworkers. We'll go back for sure and I look forward to trying more from their menu.I do recommend this place most certainly and had it not been for the waiter making his shift his personal social hour this would be a 5 star review."}
{"text":"Terrible!
They sold the restaurant as a Spanish tapas place but is toooo far away from the original Spanish food, the only thing they keep in the dishes is the name. 

Something funny, they bring the same horrible bread over and over, at the beginning with butter and with every dish.

They add butter to every single thing. The next morning, I woke up with a strange taste in my throat.

A place to avoid in Vegas."}
{"text":"Reviews were great and Firefly didn't disappoint.  Everything we tried was fantastic. Loud but lively atmosphere. Wait was close to an hour but we spent the wait at the nearby cigar bar.  
Must try!!"}
{"text":"Coming here on a Friday night for dinner is a bad idea if you're hungry cuz the wait is an hour at least. BUT, so worth the wait cuz you can wait in the bar area and drink up their mojitos =) Which I love more than their infamous sangria!

By the time you get your name called, you'll be 3 pitchers/canters in of the stuff. Passion fruit is prolly my favorite and Paradise is my least."}
{"text":"Visiting my Las Vegas office, my coworker and I decided to venture out in the area for lunch.  I wanted to try out new restaurants and went against chains.  Firefly was in walking distance so we thought we'd give this place a try.  

Upon walking in, you can sense the atmosphere: everyone is having a great time enjoying the nice day and the food.  As soon as we sat down our waiter with really cool hair greets us and brings us water and complimentary appetizer plate with bread and olives.  

What we ordered:

-Stuffed dates:  Bacon wrapped stuffed dates with bleu cheese and crushed almond........amazing!!! We had to order another plate!!

-Mac n Cheese:  Cheesy and delish, but nothing special about it

-Beef empanada: Meh, it was bland and a bit dry

-Crispy duck roll: Dry but flavorful

-Beef sliders: Comes in two, it was tasty!

There's a big list of tapas and detailed descriptions, I wish I could've tried more.  The food is unique and different compared to other tapas restaurants.  I will definitely go back as much as I can whenever I'm in town."}
{"text":"Love tapas. Love Firefly. Sad the other locations are closed. Will always and forever adore their bread and butter. Red sparkling sangria was my new venture this visit, and I really liked it. I always get the bacon wrapped dates... and then will indulge in a second order. I am a fan of their spicy shrimp tapa... can't remember the name of it but it's  sinfully good. Great place for casual business dinners, or girls night out. The border of swanky and casual- and I have found Tapas to be one of the best ways to have a social dinner. Can't wait for my next visit!"}
{"text":"When I got married two years ago my husband and I opted to have a \"reception\" the day after our wedding at a restaurant that would leave our wedding guests happy. Let's face it, wedding reception food almost always SUCKS. Why torture your friends and family when they've spent their hard earned money to travel from places near and far with rubbery chicken or bland side dishes served out of tin foil, probably made 47 hours before your event?

That's where Firefly stepped in. They closed the restaurant on a Saturday afternoon to accommodate for our large crowd of 125 hungover guests. They gave us a gigantic selection of food to offer to everyone, and made sure that pitchers of mojitos and sangria were placed on each of the tables. Ultimately, we ended up giving everyone a choice between Steak Frites, Herb Roasted Chicken, or Vegetarian Paella. When everyone arrived, we were pleased to see more than enough servers to take care of us. We were given the standard bread and sweet butter with olives, and the entrees were on the tables within 30 minutes or so. The kicker is that we spent less than $30 per person on all of it. 

Since then, I return to Firefly every single time I go to Vegas. I've happily tried every small plate on the menu, and I always enjoy the sangria because it's not syrupy and not overwhelmingly sweet. My favorite tapas are:
Firefly Fries
Pork Empanada
Petite Filet
Ham & Cheese Croquetas
Manchego Mac n Cheese
Patatas Bravas
Stuffed Dates

I typically order twice as many plates as our table needs, and somehow have never managed to spend over $75 during any visit. 

If you're looking for a place where the locals go, go to Firefly on Paradise. Get off the strip and have some tapas!"}
{"text":"I went to eat here with a few friends. I love tapas and this place had a great selection and atmosphere. I loved the bacon wrapped dates and the caramel flan the best! The flan was so good,we ordered another. Definitely want to eat there again when I visit Vegas next time."}
{"text":"The menu is HUGGGEEE for tapas. Surprisingly 4 dishes was way more than enough for my friend and I. We came on a Thursday night and it was really busy as there were only two servers in the entire restaurant. As busy as it was, our server rang in our food rather quickly because our dishes came out right away!

We shared: 
- Warm Spinach Salad - Pretty tasty dish! But we could've done without as we enjoyed the other dishes way more!
- Ceviche - So fresh! Be sure to ask for extra chips, it's not enough!
- Mac and Cheese - Pretty tasty but also pretty standard compared to most other restaurants. 
- Babyback Ribs - The meat fell right off the bones and was so tasty with their mango bbq sauce.

I'd love to come back the next time I'm out in Vegas!"}
{"text":"2nd time at Firefly... 2nd time amazed!  I laid off the happy hour sangria this time though... so I can actually remember something about the food to write a review.

Everything here is fantastic... for those not familiar with Tapas (such as my parents)... just think of it as a Spanish version of Dim Sum. 

Ordered the usual:

Stuffed Dates - bacon wrapped... yum!  Some might find the flavor unusual however... each serving comes with 5

Roasted Beet Salad - have had better elsewhere... you can skip this and try something else

BBQ Mango Ribs - my favorite dish... very tangy yet has that mango sweetness... meat falls off the bone... dish comes with 4 good sized ribs

Firefly Fries - truffle fries = king of all fries.  comes with a nice dipping sauce as well

Stuffed Mushrooms - stuffed with some sort of chorizo... fantastic. 4 pieces per order

Seafood Paella - order this right when you sit down because it takes a while to cook... probably could feed 4-6 people... it's great!  It's quite on the peppery/spiced side (not spicy but you can taste a lot of different spices added).  Unfortunately it came last and we were quite full already and couldn't enjoy it.

Even the bread appetizer is delicious... comes with what I think was a jalapeno butter and olives.

I stayed away from it this time... but the Sangria is fantastic.  Especially if you get it during happy hour.... quite the bang for the buck... careful though... that sh*t creeps up on you!

Only reason this doesn't get 5 stars in my book is the music is way too loud and the service is a bit slow."}
{"text":"I think I've been here twice in the past month and I am ready to come back to nom again very soon.  For a big guy like me, I usually prefer \"healthy\" sized meals in comparison to a plethora of small entrees to pick from.  But, Firefly seems to get me every time.  From the Camarones a la Diabla to the Tuna Tartare, all of the dishes ordered at Firefly seem to continually hit the spot.  Plus, they have a nice malbec on the menu at a nice price.  What more can I ask for??  Actually, I would ask for a decrease in the hustle-n-bustle and a little more of a quieter atmosphere.. but when everyone else is enjoying it just as much as I am.. well, I can't do too much about that now can I?

Definitely coming back to grub here soon.. make sure to try out the Camarones a la Diabla (the sauce is bangin'!) and the Passionfruit Cheesecake when you stop by!"}
{"text":"FLASH FRIED PADRON PEPPERS

We made two stops into Firefly on the most recent Vegas trip. Or was it 3? I had been thinking about Padron peppers for over a year. I've tried to find them around the Bay Area, and I tried the flash fried shisito peppers a couple months ago at Covern's Tavern in Walnut Creek, but it just wasn't the same.

I've only sat on the back patio at Firefly. Since Vegas has good weather most months of the year, and it's shaded for the hotter ones, I prefer this over the dark indoors. Service is usually pretty standard. They get very busy so it can be slow, but it never seems like I've had to wait too long.  Maybe because they serve small plates the food comes out and gets devoured faster. 

On the table after you're seated is place bread with almond butter and a couple of olives. We like to add a plate of fries, a plate of salad, a hot plate of some sort, and of course... my peppers ($5.50). 

The mojitos are great here but a pitcher will run $30 unless you're here during happy hour when it's half off."}
{"text":"I'm so happy that Firefly moved and didn't close. I have loved visiting this place as long as I've been coming to Vegas (long time). Their Padron peppers are my favorite menu item and they did not disappoint today! A full plate of peppers flash fried with lemon and sea salt was $5.50 - a really unbeatable price compared to anywhere else. We also had fries with Parmesan seasoning and that's the only plate that at all disappointed me. The serving was very large but the fries were soft and not crispy, even though they were skinny and browned. Lots of yummy shaved cheese though!

Husband enjoys the ham and cheese croquetas ($5) and had a soda also (coke $2.50). I tried a new plate this time and went with the chili, lime garbanzo beans (in the shell!) ($4.50) I didn't even know they came in a shell (but it makes sense) so I asked the server what they're like. He compared them to edamame but these little pods were much more difficult to work the beans out of. I liked them a lot but they were a lot of work for too little reward. 

The new restaurant is wonderful. Much bigger and still a great location. There is parking in the back, but if you miss the driveway on the way in, be sure to not park in the subsequent parking lot, as we were told they are happy to tow you.

$25.41 for amazing tapas for two"}
{"text":"The food was delicious. I had crab cakes, steak and mushrooms skewers, filet mignon, and mac and cheese Tapas. If I had to change anything it would be to bring out the food all together and keep homeless people out. We were followed out to the parking lot and hit up for money by a homeless man we just saw grabbing candy inside."}
{"text":"Who would of known that there is an AMAZING Tapas restaurant in Las Vegas? 

Firely is located off the strip but well worth the trip. As we enter, it was dark and social with latin jams blasting in the background.  I was starting to dig this place!

To get the party started, I order the sangria and mojito. Both drinks were TERRIFIC! Don't judge me it's VEGAS! 

There were so many tapa dishes to choose from. The bacon wrapped figs, tierra y mar skewer, crispy duck rolls and tuna tartar were incredible. The filet mignon sliders and mac n cheese was outstanding. Each tapas dish ranges from $4-$8. 

I would definitely be back here on my next trip to Vegas!"}
{"text":"Stuffed Bacon Wrapped Dates - 'nuff said!

Even of all the nice, fancy restaurants Las Vegas has to offer this one is always at the top of my list and mostly always on my mind when I dream about yummy dishes!"}
{"text":"I really love the paella and sangría, the place it's a little bit noisy but good... and decoration it's"}
{"text":"We came here for a very early dinner before we hit up the Strip and it was a great idea because not only was the food amazing, but it was also happy hour. I had a Cherry Moscow Mule and it was nice spin on the drink. It was definitely on the sweeter side which was enjoyable.

If you're looking a pre-party meal, I would suggest this place. I was not full in anyway after the meal, but I knew if I was going to have 21+ later that night, I would still have enough food in my stomach to keep me functional. However, if you're looking to chow down, I wouldn't recommend this place because the portions are fairly small and for three girls, we pretty much cleaned up every plate. For that reason, I would put this place at more of a 3.5."}
{"text":"Great place that is local. Found a long hair, manager addressed as well as server. Scallops were over cooked. Other than that good food good price."}
{"text":"Great service in this surprisingly and unassuming little place off the Strip. Very reasonably priced tapas that are delicious. Don't be discouraged from the \"strip mall feel\" joint. Nearly everything here is quite tasty and again...very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"This is the best kept secret in Vegas. Great food and amazing service in the BEST of atmospheres. Do not miss this gem while in the Sin City!  Ask for Haley or Athena for the time of your life!!! Craft beer I haven't had the pleasure of trying yet, paired with the finest tapas! Amazing taste and affordable pricing! Great company with knowledgable bartenders! Every flavor mojito you can imagine made to order! Very well known by locals for their Sangria!!! We love Firefly, come see for yourself!!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas. Always great service - quick service, and very friendly and attendant staff.

The only downside is that the wait can be a little long on busy nights and if you have a big group (understandable for any place) but they're very good about getting tables cleaned up to help the next party.

GREAT food. Pretty good sized menu of tapas, and nothing is ever bland. So much flavor to choose from! Whatever your taste it, I'm pretty sure you'd find something that you'd like.

The mojitos are freakin' BOMB. If you like bread pudding, theirs a must-try!

{"text":"I love freaking tapas! This place was a great birthday dinner location, and I had a blast! We came an hour before happy hour ended so we were keeping those drink orders rolling since they were half price! We had the pumpkin spice martini, pomegranate martini, a martini with ginger (I'm sorry! I forgot what the name was), and the passion fruit mojito.

Passion fruit mojito? BOMB!
Pomegranate martini? BOMB, but strong
Pumpkin Spice martini? Strong, spicy, and EXPLOSIVE in your mouth!

The food? I honestly lost track of how many items we ordered because it just kept coming! They were all so good! I mean we practically ordered half of the menu.

Chicken skewers: so full of flavor and tang, that its kicking soccer balls of flavor in your mouth. chicken very tender.

Beef and mushroom skewers: very very good. Tender, juicy, and flavorful.

Fish sticks: a great crispy breading with a very tender filet.

Lobster escargo: AWESOME.ORG!!!

Ceviche: Very light, and soft flavor

Honestly, we had more food, but I just lost track and couldn't remember thanks to the food coma I had towards the end of our meal. I was so stuffed and buzzed that I didn't quite know what hit me more...

The service was great! The server and bussers came back to check up on us every 15 minutes, and they didn't mind at all that we kept making more orders. Most of all the nice waitress gave me and my friend free tres leches cake with a nice candle for our birthday...we didn't even ask for it. Aw..she's so sweet. HUGS FRIEND!!!"}
{"text":"I lived for another day...so their previous demerits should not merit on this review. I like their new location and the new feel. It's very dark, romantic (if you want it to be), and hip. They are filled with nicely designed booths for more privacy, and they have a private room which you can reserve for a big party.

I headed to the bar and of course you have to order one of their signature mojitos or sangria (by the glass or pitcher...if i were you I'd order a pitcher) as I wait for the rest of my party. Even if I was already late I was still early than the rest of my group. Anyway, I ordered a glass of the BLOOD ORANGE MOJITO. Then, as our party slowly but surely showed up, we ordered rounds of pitchered mojitos. This included the watermelon and cucumber mojito. 

Here are my mojito highlights:
Glass: $7.50 Pitcher: $30.00

BLOOD ORANGE: Lovely! It has that nice tart taste from the blood orange, and can barely taste the alcoholic kick. So if you want something with a strong cocktaily flavor with less of an alcoholic taste I would recommend.

CUCUMBER: This is pretty good too. Here, you taste more of the alcoholic flavor. It is a lighter mojito flavor wise. So if you're looking for something fun in flavor...probably steer away from here.

WATERMELON: While a pitcher or two of these bad boys may lead you to your own rendition to DRUNK IN LOVE (you can't help it since Queen B does say watermelon), this has a really light refreshing taste with a good mixture of that alcoholic POW. Definitely, one of my faves. In which we did drink the most of. 

Food wise, we ordered a bunch of random plates in which a party of 7 shared. 4 pitchers and a handful of tapas plates later, our tab reached a good $300. So expect to pay a good $60 to $80 PER PERSON especially if it's at a dinner party. 

Other favorite foods I like ordering here:

DATES
CHORIZO SKEWERS
SCALLOP ESCARGOT
STEAK AND MUSHROOM SKEWERS
SHRIMP CEVICHE
MUSHROOM/CHEESE TART (this is really filling with a strong cream taste...which is usually a hit or miss with people so be careful)

Just name drop these choices and you'll sound like a regular here. Other than that, read everyone else's review on the plates."}
{"text":"We saw this place for the first time in 12/11 but could not get in because it was packed with a wait time of almost 2 hours. Then we saw it on TV on a food channel, maybe Restaurant Stakeout, where it was profiled for horrible service. During this trip to Vegas we stopped by in late afternoon and were seated immediately, although we were warned that the computers were down so the service may be slow.

The experience was mixed. The wife loved her beet salad, and I got smoked salmon on toasts that was very good. We also split a vegie empanada that was good, although the wife liked it better than I. 

Our \"main\" courses consisted of lamb skewers for the wife and serrano sliders for me. Her lamb was tough and chewy. The toughest lamb she ever had at any restaurant in her life. She actually just spit it out in a napkin. My sliders were not very good. There was no serrano ham. I asked the waitress if they forgot to add the ham and she said it was in the beef patty. That was a lie, because the patty was pure beef, unless the ham was microscopic and flavorless. Another problem is that the sliders were dry and overcooked. And I mean way overcooked, as in hockey pucks. Overall, the flavors did not come together with the aioli and it just did not taste good. I could barely finish the two sliders, and frankly, I did not want to. On the  positive side, the food came out in a timely manner, despite problems with the computer. 

The service was substandard. Our waitress Fernanda disappeared after taking our order. I had to ask random waiters for another drink and for the bill. Mind you, this was 4:30pm and the place was not busy. Where she was or what she was doing, I have no idea. Groups of waiters/waitresses were congregating and talking, hugging, laughing, etc. Apparently, the Restaurant Stakeout effect has worn off. 

On the positive side, we arrived during happy hour so drinks were half price. 

I wanted to try the filet mignon sliders but they were not on the menu.

My wife wants to give this place a 4, my experience was a 2, so I am compromising on a 3, as in average, not \"A-ok\". I would never return and would never choose to spend my money at this place again."}
{"text":"I was fortunate enough to dine here during CES last week. Holeeee moleee it was good. We bought pitchers of the Sangria which was suitable for 3-4 people. Then we started off with the bacon wrapped dates because BACON. My colleague was very eager to try something with Manchengo cheese so we ordered the Manchego Mac & Cheese which was good but I'd pass next time around(not a manchego cheese fan). The pork empanadas were good as well but I'd definitely recommend the steak and mushroom. Nom nom noms.

Price was reasonable so if you get a chance dine here!"}
{"text":"I love fire fly, if it was a little cheaper would get 5 stars, took the girlfriend on a date here and we were both very happy with the service and food. The bacon wrapped dates Mmm so tasty. If locals get discounts I would be returning quite often ."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night, It was quite busy. Three girls/hostess were at the host desk, they were not welcoming, no smile , no greeting, just a \"how many?\" We said \"3\" and the girl didn't look at the books or anything, and was like \"30 minutes.\" There was no one else waiting. We knew someone that worked there so we called him and boom got seated right away. From this point on, everything was great! Our server was very attentive and always checking on our table. When our food came out, it was phenomenal. I got the steak and mushroom skewers, and my two friends got the filet minon, and the lamb, we like meat! Lol all three was soooooo good! We also ordered a pitcher of Passion Fruit Mojito, and it was very good and refreshing!!!! 

All in all, great food, great servers, great ambiance BUT HORRIBLE HOSTESSES. I think hostesses are a big part of a restaurant operation, they are the first impression of the restaurant, and with those girls there that night, Oh NO, seemed like they were just there chit chatting and checking out guys, not doing their job. Should have been 5 stars, but garbage hostesses made 1 star go to garbage."}
{"text":"Every bite was delicious!  You can't go wrong here.  Servers were friendly and helpful.  They even called a cab for us to get back to our hotel on the strip after the meal.  Definitely worth trying if you're visiting the area.  Don't forget to save room for dessert!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love the sangria & the tapas!  Very nice bar where you can dine solo. Stuffed dates are a favorite! Red sangria much better than white!"}
{"text":"We had been thinking of trying out this place for quite a while and we finally went. I could have lived without eating here it was just okay. The food was fine just nothing spectacular, the service was fine as well just nothing impressive overall. It was super loud so it was difficult to converse with our friends. I do recommend trying to bacon wrapped dates if you come here, though. Those were really good but you only get a bite since this place is tapas style. Nothing bad to say about Firefly but just nothing impressive about it. They do have a bar that we did not try anything from so perhaps they have some awesome drinks to make up for the place."}
{"text":"My whole body awoke to taste the bacon wrapped dates. The fantastic flavor of the sauce enlivened my spirit and encouraged an illuminating conversation between myself and my date. Pun not intended. 
With each bite of the petite filet mignon revealing more and more power of a red wine sauce, so too did each sip of the perfectly crafted mojito reveal more and more the depths in relationship that are discoverable through a layered and reasonably priced meal. 
If you want your taste buds to envelop your body like goose bumps on a cold naked night, then eat at the Fly... and soar into one of God's kitchens."}
{"text":"Open late, great ambiance and even better staff. Manny G was a great server, very attentive and very helpful. Suggested a variety of delicious tapas. Overall he was an excellent server & Alexis was great too! 

I recommend the the tuna tartare."}
{"text":"Wow, what a fun restaurant!  Being from out of town, I was told by many people to take a little adventure off of the strip and go try it out.  What a great decision.

The menu is tapas style, which is basically my favorite thing in the entire world.  I mean, you can get so many different flavors and varieties (each at around $6 or something) all while appreciating the ambiance and fun atmosphere!

Our table ordered the big bowl salad to start, followed by the stuffed dates (AMAZING! GET THESE!!!), spicy beef salad, manchego mac 'n' cheese, ahi tuna skewer, camarones a la diabla, sliders, chicken and chorizo stuffed mushrooms, merguez, firefly fries, and we all shared the seafood paella.  Everything....EVERYTHING....was wonderful! 

This sounds like a lot of food, but keep in mind that it is tapas style.. Between 7 girls, it came out to be like 2-4 bites per dish!  They were perfect for sharing!  Also, our server was spectacular and everything was served relatively quickly, given the restaurant was packed!

Oh, try their blackberry and raspberry infused vodka and/or a pitcher of the blood orange mojitos.  Trust me, you will love.

This will be one of the first stops when I go back to Vegas!!"}
{"text":"Kinda slow service but really good food. Tons of options and very reasonable. Great menu and close to the Strip. Way better than overpriced strip places to eat."}
{"text":"This restaurant came highly recommended by a friend. She is beyond a fan. This restaurant participated on the Epicurean Affair we came to all the way from Florida to attend. 
 She came with us on this visit and ordered some of her favorites for all to share. I had tried what they offered at the Food and Wine affair and I looked forward to try more selections. Everything was great. I especially loved some skewers I had and the sangria!  I wasn't too crazy about the bacon wrapped dates, which seem to be their specialty. 

Service was phenomenal, and the restaurant is a mixture of funky and eclectic. Lots of colorful artwork. Lots of mirrors. It is a great place.
We didn't get entrees, just tapas. I would definitely be back."}
{"text":"My second time here. I was in charge of setting up a dinner for my Bffs Bachelorette for 6 girls! They all loved the food! Best part was Gerry the bus boy! Awesome and funny! The manager Eduardo was accommodating, funny, and made sure we were taken care of! Great food and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"This is definitely a cool and hip place.  Lush, red decor and comfortable high tables in the bar.  They have a patio, which is always a plus.  Great mix of people here.  I should be giving this place 5 stars, right?  But here's the thing: I HATE TAPAS!  I hate that there are only like 2 bites of everything and the worst is when you go with a party of, say, 4 and there are 5 pieces of something and then everybody keeps eyeing that last piece and there's a bunch of fake

\"Oh, do you want that?\" 
\"No, you can have it!\" 
\"No, YOU can have it.\" 
\"Are you sure?\"
\"Yeah, it's ok.\"
\"Are you sure?  Because you can have it if you want it.\"  Uggghhhhh.  I want to enjoy food, not play Goblet of Fire for the last bacon wrapped date.

So why am I fan of this tapas restaurant even though I admit I abhor the dining style?  Well, when it's a sultry summer eve, crisp fall night, chilly winter evening, or fresh spring twilight...nothing is better than a glass of perfectly made sangria.  And THAT is why I love Firefly.  And when it's happy hour, a pitcher of that delicious sangria is only $14.  You can easily get about 8 glasses out of that pitcher.

Sitting on the patio with my man or some good friends, having beautiful conversation, drinking perfect sangria, knowing I'm getting it for half price, and enjoying life...that is my definition of a perfect afternoon.  And I'll even let my husband have that last bacon wrapped date."}
{"text":"firefly once again satisfies our ever whim. Nahum served my girlfriend and me with candor and professionalism, and of course the food and red sangria were all amazing. flavors,  textures,  ambiance... fantastic! 

it was only in the 90s yesterday and cloudy,  and sitting outside with the misters was all very pleasant. 

do see if there is a Groupon... ours was totally a steal. and let your server know if you've been a loyal customer! they very much appreciate years of love,  and happy reviews. 

and did I mention the sangria was on point?"}
{"text":"Go during happy hour. The drinks are half price and the restaurant is less crowded.

The mango mojito was the best that I've ever tasted.

We ordered a lot of food and couldn't finish everything, so I'll just review the favorites. The mac 'n cheese was extra cheesy and creamy. The vegetables and lentils had a fresh citrus flavor. My boyfriend liked the duck dumplings, but thought that they had too much sauce (I'm sure that you could ask the chef to go light on the sauce). The ham and cheese croquets were my boyfriend's favorite. They looked like gourmet tater tots and were very creamy.

Even though we were stuffed I ordered the caramel flan for dessert. It wasn't that gelatinous stuff that you get a Chevy's. It was delightfully creamy and smooth.

Go to Firefly even though it's not on the strip. Share a taxi with some friends and it will be well worth it."}
{"text":"Update Time! Went here for the 3rd time, in as many years. There is always a wait as the secret about these guys has gotten out over the last several years. It is worth the wait! They are still my #1 goto-spot for Vegas. Sneaked out of here under $50 for 2 people! The infused Vodka Martini was the winner of the night. Never had a fruity martini that was so well balanced and not too sweet. Other highlights include the eggplant canneloni & lamb chops. I was sad that we were swayed away from the garlic shrimp which everyone raves about but, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Tasty and relatively inexpensive tapas with a bit of a locals vibe yet close enough to the strip a tourist like me could make it there. Certainly worth trying out if you want some tapas."}
{"text":"wow. this place is SPECTACULAR. exceeded my already high expectations with the insane quality of ingredients, friendly service, unique flavors, and affordable prices. 

to start, the free bread appetizer was delicious. comes with this sweet butter thing. dont know what it is but i want moar
shrimp ceviche came first.. sadly it was way too acidic for my taste and some of the chips were stale. however, the rest of the meal would more than made up for it...

-scallop escargot: perfect texture, GREAT flavor!! so effing delicious!
-mushroom with puff pastry: whatever sauce they used on the mushrooms brought out the flavor of the mushroom PERFECTLY... the light and airy puff pastry was a perfect complement to the stronger but delicious flavor of the mushroom
-lamb chops: so full of flavor and cooked to an exact medium rare as requested... a tiny bit too salty for my taste but delicious nonetheless 
-chocolate tres leches cake: wow. i've only ever had tres leches cake with white cake before but i much prefer the chocolate version. the combo of the chocolate with the milk was the perfect union of sweet desserty flavors. such an amazing way to end the meal 

its a little off the strip but TRUST ME...its worth the short drive/cab ride to check this place out. i actually walked 1.5 mi from planet hollywood and it wasnt that bad albeit kind of a ghetto walk haha. also i hear the sangrias and mojitos are amazing too"}
{"text":"Firefly is one of my favorite off-strip places to have a great variety of food and excellent drinks. Pepe, Vanessa and Alejandra really know how to take care of you and make you feel like a rockstar!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I come here religiously. The food is so good and it so fun to order a ton of food because it's all small sized and easy to share. The servers are always on point and the hostesses are awesome. This place is incredible and you're not limited to ordering one entree because it's all tapas. 100% love this place and hope they branch out and open up more locations! Anyone who judges this place for things in the past is truly mistaken and missing out on amazing quality food."}
{"text":"We actually ventured off the strip and made our way to Firefly that was recommended to us by a friend who lives in Vegas. 
The first and most annoying part of this restaurant is the staff who answers the phone and act as the first faces who greet you as you come in. Pretty much everyone had a bit of an attitude with us. They would also reiterate that there are NO RESERVATIONS taken here. Once we arrived, we asked about possibly waiting for one of the table up front that had some nice loungey (is that a real word?) couches and were told that you had to call ahead for that!  Hellooooo thats usually a reservation right? So weird. 

The food itself was pretty tasty but your usual tapas, nothing too unique. The sangria was great. 

I would recommend this restaurant for a quick bite and a drink but wouldnt really go out of my way to go again."}
{"text":"I have eaten at firefly at least a dozen times, and I have to say I am a huge fan!  I came in for happy hour tonight and enjoyed a half priced of pitcher of Red Sangria with my friend, this is one of the things they are known for and is a must have!

The Food is usually on point at this location and that was the case this afternoon.  If you eat here you HAVE to get the bacon wrapped dates, they are freakin amazing, sweet and salty.  I also ordered the Calamari, which was perfectly fried and tender, and the Stuffed Piquillo Peppers.

My friend ordered the Duck Rolls, they were a little overcooked.  The food also seemed to be taking a while to come out of the kitchen, especially for 3pm. 

All in all, I will definitely be returning for another happy hour."}
{"text":"Did not disappoint!  We kept passing Firefly and being intrigued.  Their Sangria is flavorful and devine.  We ordered a wide selection and loved all.  Not a traditional paella with saffron, but rich and delicious anyway.  The butter for the bread is incredible too."}
{"text":"Eat it. Maybe. Skip it.

EAT IT! 

As a current resident in Seattle, I lived in the Henderson / Las Vegas area for 4 years. Firefly was my all time favorite place for drinks and tapas in LV. A great place to grab some food and drinks after work and/or to take my guests from that visited me from out of town.

The staff was very friendly. The food was plentyful. The drinks were endless.
The pitchers of passion fruit mojitos and the white wine sangria are the best thing to ever drink under the shade, alfresco, to beat that warm Las Vegas day heat, trust me. They are 10 out of 10 of the best refreshing drinks in the 702.... and the better yet, the best tapas I've had too date.

My only mediocre critique: Firefly used to be a diamond in the rough. A locals paradise. But now I heard that sometimes it gets so busy that you have to make reservations... sad but also great for their business. I highly recommend this place to locals and visitors alike! This place will make you love the LV foodie seen and want to come back for more."}
{"text":"What a view!  Came here around 9pm on a cab driver recomendation, and somehow got the best seat in the place.  Amazing view of freemont street!

Food was ok.  Appetizer sized items to share.  Nothing stood out as amazing.

The hotel seems old and gross, this hidden gem is located on level 2 of the Plaza hotel.

Get some food and drinks here before hitting up the freemont strip."}
{"text":"Came here with great friends on our vegas trip.  It was my first time trying tapas. It was really good.  Restaurant looked small but had plenty of seating and service was good. We tried a little bit of everything. I really enjoyed the sliders and the Mac and cheese. Both were well done.  We ordered the firefly fries and there was plenty to last for the whole meal for all of us. The date wrapped with bacon was so good.  We got a pitcher of sangria. Which was plenty for four. Sangria was too strong for me but I know others will enjoy the amount of alcohol. We finished with the Nutella sandwiches which was amazing. Only thing I really didn't like was the cold chorizo meat platter. I was not a fan."}
{"text":"Smack dab beside our humble hotel, Marriott version, the Firefly was a taste and cultural treat. Our drinks, house Shandy and a Cherry Mule, delicious different and just right after long flight. Small plates includes spicey steak salad which was a palate explosion and chorizo stuffed mushrooms.  Tres leches were a wonderful ending.  Best way to finish was watching some salsa dancers on the front patio. So cool!"}
{"text":"DEEELISHH!

My co-worker highly recommended this place and no way did it disappoint!

We had lots of food - too many dishes to remember, but I remember the stand out of the night was the seafood paella.

To be honest, I think it was better than most of the paella i had in Spain last year.  It was full of seafood, and the rice was cooked perfectly al dente.  It was perfectly seasoned and the portion was HUGE.  We were all happy campers.

It's just a close cab ride from the strip.  It's moderately priced and there's something for everyone.  It's my new LV place to go for some good food!"}
{"text":"Love this new location, and can't believe it took us this long to finally go check it out! It's so much more spacious then either of the other locations, I love that I can walk here! 
The sparkling sangria hit the spot!  We were pretty hungry & got carried away, we ordered 4 tapas! My fav this time was the vegetables & lentils, yum. 
This might just have to become a regular outing, but next time 3 tapas for 2 people is plenty. Especially since a pitcher of sangria during happy hour is pretty much mandatory :)"}
{"text":"I love EVERYTHING I ordered here. Which is almost everything on the menu. My favorite is the lentil salad. I try to come here as often as I can.The desserts are delicious. Especially the chocolate leche cake. It's sooo good!  Milky & not to sweet . I always get the pitcher mojito's or pitcher sangria.
 
Service is always on point even if you come w/ big groups. They are always on top of everything. The restaurant is always clean & I like the red decor. Best tapas in vegas!"}
{"text":"Can I just say this is my absolute favorite place! I recommend it to anyone and everyone! The red sangria is life along with their happy hour! From 11pm-2am Monday- Thursday and Fridays they have Latin night!! Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"1200 reviews and 4 1/2 stars? I had to try this place. Plus, it gave me another excuse for tapas! No reservations for Fri or Sat- but they take them any other day of the week.

Sooo- we came on a Sunday instead. We had made reservations ahead of time and were promptly seated. For being a Sunday night during off-season, the place was still pretty crowded. There is very low lighting- so if you expect some amazing phone photos of your food, probably not going to happen unless you drown it in a flash.

There were a ton of things that we wanted to try on the menu and the server gladly explained his pros/cons on each of our choices while recommending some of his own. There was no rush, but he continually checked in with us to see if we were ready or had any other inquiries. I was glad there were four of us- we really pigged out.

While we waited, we went for their house sangria. Though I'm not a wine person, it was pretty fantastic. It was light and fruity, but after glass two, I was definitely feeling a nice buzz. We ordered a pitcher for the four of us and it was probably the better deal since we each got about two glasses out of it. If you're not lightweights like us, a pitcher between two people would probably be sufficient, too. It's definitely a great drink while enjoying your food.

We inhaled:
Serrano Sliders: Filet mignon with serrano ham, grilled onions and clouds of heaven. Not the menu description, but I think I heard angels singing when I bit into them. They were super moist, cooked medium and the cheese was melted perfectly in the soft, yet crispy bun. These were so amazing that I'll probably compare every other slider experience in the future to these little things.

Manchengo Mac and Cheese: Came out in a little skillet that was still bubbling when served. It was crispy on top with a generous amount of bread crumbs. It wasn't too cheesy and split between four people, it was just enough without weighing us down. I loved the strong taste of the cheese and liked that it was so gooey without being watery. Even if there were two of us, I'd still probably order it again.

Stuffed Dates: These sweet things were stuffed with blue cheese and then wrapped in bacon. The bacon was perfectly cooked with some nice crispy fat and it was unanimous that it was the favorite dish of the night.It comes in a serving of 5, so we all got one and I got an extra. I'm seriously salivating thinking of the sweet and savory combination and wish that they had a location in CA for me to indulge in... but it's probably better that they don't.

Firefly Fries: It's a generous portion served with melted parmesan cheese on top. For dipping, it comes with aioli. The french fries were crispy and I loved the oil that they were cooked in. It didn't even really need the sauce that accompanied it and it was plenty for the four of us.

Albondigas: These were like mini meatballs with the tomato sauce and parmesan sprinkled on top. They were delicious and moist and held some great flavors. As soon as they hit the table, we pretty much inhaled it. Definitely worth getting.

Empanadas: A hit as well. Really enjoyed the flaky pastry outside and the super moist pork inside. The peppers gave it a nice little kick, but nothing a swig of sangria couldn't extinguish. It was so good, I again forgot to use the dipping sauce that came with it.

Baked Tetilla: Just like the description says, it's fondue- so super cheese. It comes with crisp pieces of toast to spread the combo of cheese, tomato and chorizo on. We saved it and continued to dip our fries in it after the bread was gone. There was no way in hell we were going to let any go to waste!

Fried Calamari: This was good, but standard calamari. It was good, but I would opt for something a little more adventurous next time.

Tierra y Mar Skewers: Little kebobs with shrimp, filet and chorizo. I loved the charred tasted from the grill. The combination of these three proteins was pretty genius, each meat was delicious on their own and even better together.

Chorizo Plate: Different types of thinly sliced chorizo served on a plate with capers. This was probably our least favorite dish. It wasn't bad, but we shouldn't have ended with it. It would have worked better as one of our beginning courses. It wasn't bad, but we had a bunch of hearty samples and this was light and salty. 

Banana and Nutella Sandwiches: Now this was the perfect way to end a meal. It was like crack and we almost ordered a second serving because it was so damn good. It was like french toast with bananas on the inside. Add in the nutella and it was the dessert of the gods. Super simple but extra delicious. This is a must if you're in the mood for a sweet finale.

Service was impeccable. Someone constantly came around to clear our plates and refill drinks. This place deserves a 6th star and will become one of my regular Las Vegas stops for sure!"}
{"text":"I really look forward to eating here whenever I'm in Vegas.  The flavors all complement each other so well in everything I've tried! The servings are definitely small but it won't break the bank to get a few options and enjoy what they do best... The food! Do yourself a favor a skip the buffet and give this place a try!"}
{"text":"We have been coming here for 12 years and have seen them through good and bad times. We have always had outstanding service, tasty drinks, and delicious tapas. 

We always order multiple orders of their dates which are stuffed with an almond, covered with bacon and finished with crumbled bleu cheese in a tasty sauce. 

They also have delicious paella, stuffed red peppers, eggplant cannelloni and of course sangria. 

Everything is to di"}
{"text":"Firefly needs their own entrance because walking through the Plaza just set the WRONG mood. It was as if, we had been transported back to some really bad, early 80's movie, and the patrons were slightly Deliverance like. Ay-Mommy!!!  Even the escalator had seen better days and don't get me started with the funky cigarette smell. The place needs to be detonated!

Let me preface the food review by saying, I came expecting to be impressed. Well Ok, more like fed because it wasn't España and I have super high standards for tapas.  Oh how I wanted to like you, but at every turn I was rebuffed. It wasn't quite a ghost town, but it might as well have been. It was a sad state of affairs. 

Good- The Fremont Experience View & Getting reservations easily through Open Table. The steak was just about the only thing edible.

Bad- Lackluster waitstaff - Yeah, I understand- If I worked in a restaurant, in the crumbling and oh so sketchy Plaza Hotel, I too might not feel all that chipper either, but COME ON! Muster up a little faux excitement for newbies-- pretty please!!!! 

Ugly -Just about everything we had was better off left in the kitchen. We tried the dates and I can do better at home. We tried the ham and cheese. Argh!! The fondue tasted like sweaty gym socks. The meats were like chewy leather. The salad was aight, but salads should not be a measuring stick.  The drinks were blah. I guess the atmosphere sans a large group was just plain lame. 

They need to revamp the menu and relocate away from a location in decline."}
{"text":"Was taken here for dinner, and it was pretty good. The food was great, the staff was nice, but a little slow on service. They had salsa music playing inside, but we were outside eating and talking. This place is a bit out of the way from the strip, so you may or may not make your way over here. However, if you are willing to take the ride over, or are in the area, I highly recommend you go! Great tapas, great serving sizes and a great atmosphere. Would visit again."}
{"text":"It's New Year's Eve and there's a lot on the agenda. Deciding where to eat before the major festivities begin is no easy feat. After hours (ok, maybe minutes) of research, we landed on Firefly and it did more than fit the bill for the occasion (which just happened to be my birthday too!) 

A group of 12 of us sat down and everyone got wide eyes when we were handed the lengthy menu. It was a 25 dollar minimum per person which was not difficult to fulfill. We took to picking out a couple dishes each that we passed around the table and filled glasses with pitchers of red sangria and passionfruit mojitos and were anything but happy. 

With that many people, we were able to try so many different dishes. I couldn't avoid ordering my go-to tapas including the bacon-wrapped dates, patatas bravas and ham and cheese croquetas. Luckily others I was with ordered different things like the fresh tuna tartare, shrimp and filet skewers, mac n' cheese and vegetable empanadas. 

As if the food wasn't enough, the service was outstanding. On a busy night, they were nice enough to push tables together for us, clear our plates quickly and put candles on my birthday cake when the time came! 

Paying in big groups can sometimes be a headache, but they made it easy for us. When the time came to grab a taxi, they helped us with that too! 

Landing in a new city for your birthday can always be a little nerve wracking but I cannot imagine a place that would have been better at leaving everyone able to find something they could enjoy!"}
{"text":"yummy tapas? good.
pitcher of sangria? good. 
whats not to like about firefly???

what i ate:
- mushroom tart: puff pastry filled with a delicious concoction of various mushrooms on a bed of creamy cheese. you wont miss the meat in this one, the mushrooms are so earthy.
- bacon wrapped stuffed dates: i LOVE these things. its such a simple tapas, but so tasty. the sweet date pulled the sweetness out of the bacon but the saltiness was still there. the cheese inside balanced everything out with some creaminess, and the nut gave it just the right bite of texture. i could pop these things all night
- steak and mushroom skewers: i wasnt expecting much, i mean this isnt a steak place (ruths chris is right next door). but omg, the steak was perfect! it was tender and perfectly cooked. the mushrooms were a nice balance. i dont know that the sauce was on the plate, but i sopped up the rest with some bread
- empanda: this was also tasty. the meat filling had a nice spice to it, and i loved that it came with a bit of salad on the side. the salad was vinegary, crunchy and fresh. a nice palette cleanser
- sausage plate: i dont know all the different meats that came, but there were four different kinds. came sprinkled with capers and gherkins. 
- firefly fries: you know why these were good? because you know firefly peeled the potatoes and made them on site, FRESH. because these tasted like in n out fries... but BETTER (i know i know, you didnt think it was possible, but these were actually better)
- sangria: light, fresh, fruity but there was still a nice wine flavor to it
- bread: yea, i know who cares about bread when you have yummy food to eat? but honestly, i get turned off by places that dont take details into account. i wasnt worried about the food when i had the bread at firefly. the baguette was good, but the butter that also came out with it was amazing! kept eating it with the rest of our small plates

pros:
- FOOD: i cant rave enough about everything i ate!!! my mouth is seriously watering about all the food we ate. i know its a tapas place, but the portions were generous!!!! i left feeling stuffed! and we didnt even finish everything
- price: 6 tapas plates and a pitcher of sangria for about $70. cheap considering everything we ate! 
- service: server was attentive and always filled our glasses when he saw that they were empty. the busboy was also adorably eager to whisk away our plates. 
- ambiance: definitely a great place to take a date! the patio was nice and cozy with dim lighting. inside was nice too, though CROWDED when i went.

cons:
- the WAIT. they dont take rez on the weekends i think. 
*TIP* try calling ahead and asking to be put on the list. the hostess will politely say, ok, but this does not put you on the actual waiting list and it does not guarantee you a table upon arrival - basically just talk to cover her ass just in case. we did this before we left and got seated right when we got there. awesome! 
- bathroom: i know its a busy restaurant, but my god, this was a bad hollywood club bathroom! paper towels all over the floor, and a line of bitchy girls that stared every girl down as they entered. *shudder* 

would i come again? YES"}
{"text":"Came her for my cousins 21st bday, it was so amazing! The food was so good, we ordered so many different things, and there wasn't anything I tried that I didn't like. The highlights for we were the filet and the chicken empanadas. The red sangria was also very delicious. Our server, Eder,  took amazing care of us! It's for sure a must go for dinner!"}
{"text":"Went here on a recommendation and was very impressed. This Tapas restaurant is not in a touristy area and is a huge locals hot spot. The Sangria is the first thing to get your lips on. It is some of the best I've ever had. Not only is the food amazing but the prices are very reasonable. Filet sliders, ahi tartar, shrimp carpaccio, lentils, and bacon wrapped dates totaled $39 + $24 for a pitcher of sangria and you have an amazing dinner for two for $63. (not including tip) Treat yourself to Firefly the next time you visit Vegas, you won't regret it :)"}
{"text":"Amazing tapas!! The filet mignon sliders are extremely tender and perfectly cooked; I could eat 100 of them"}
{"text":"I really hope this place doesn't shut down.. its my go to spot for good food and great sangria.  Never been disappointed eating here, everything I've tried is amazing.  I am really sad the Henderson location closed, please open another one! New paradise location is really loud, makes it really hard to hold a convo."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Seriously..the tapas are phenomenal and the sangria is on point! Only negatives would be they can get pretty slow with service and getting food out and sometimes the crowd is a little loud for a restaurant. I have had to literally shout to the person sitting right across from me. But overall, the tapas make it worth it. And the waiters, though sometimes slow, are always nice and helpful!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to unwind before or after going out on the strip. Great place to meet up with friends, cus it is not too loud. It is located parallel to the strip so none of that chaos. The food is delicious, but the portions are tight. I enjoyed the tierra y mar skewers, empanadas,   stuffed dates, fire fries with aoli and their complimentary starter sweet butter and croquetas. I recomment a pitcher of ANY flavor mojitos (more bang for your buck), I prefer mango."}
{"text":"Delicious!! Went with a group of friends and ordered maybe like 8-10 dishes? They are all small tapa dishes and they were great!! The only thing is if you order the paella it takes like 20 mins to cook, which they inform you. Since we were in a time crunch, we didn't order that. All the tapas were great, but the best ones were the skewers-- I think we order 2 different ones and both were so good! The empanadas were also really yummy. Service was attentive and atmosphere was relaxing."}
{"text":"We came here for a birthday celebration and had a great experience. 

We had about 20 people, and they were quite accommodating to us all! The drinks we fantastic, loved the sangria! And the food was delish. Between all 20 of us I think we at least got one of each thing on the menu, and everything was amazing. My personal fave was the muscles in a coconut curry sauce, YUM!

Only reccomendation... it IS tapas after all, so each person orders multiple things, the tables are so small!!!!! They need some bigger tables, and maybe people would eat and order more!"}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE this place. Fabulous food, fabulous service and fabulous ambiance. Tasty sangria drinks, the white sangria was especially good because it wasn't too sweet. Ordered the crispy duck, surf and turf skewerers, camarones all ajillo, bacon wrapped dates, ahi tuna with mango, ham and cheese croquettes and every single tapas dish was delightful! Only complaint is that it was a bit dark in the restaurant so we couldn't really see what we were eating."}
{"text":"Came to Firefly for our last meal in Vegas before returning home to NYC.  On a Sunday night there was a wait which speaks highly of such a restaurant.  

Atmosphere: Typical tapas place.  Not a complaint at all, but don't expect anything above and beyond in terms of atmosphere.  It looked like a nice date spot. In fact we sat next to a couple on a birthday date and honestly it looked perfect. They even had a private photographer who came around and took photos.

Food: I feel like we ordered a ton of stuff, ironically my favorite dishes were the roasted vegetables and the grilled peppers (not sure what they are actually called). I've been back for over a week and I'm still thinking about those peppers, they were the perfect blend of sweet (not spicy peppers) and salty.

My other favorite dish was the scallop \"escargots\".  I must admit, they did a fantastic job with this dish.  The presentation and flavor was spot on.  Firefly escalated a scallop dish in an inventive way that I have never seen before, and I always appreciate that.

We didn't drink or have dessert so I can't speak on either of those topics. I would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"The best Tapas restaurant I have ever been to. I make it a point to come here every trip to Vegas. Oct 26th can't come soon enough!!"}
{"text":"Simple fare but very tasty.  Many choices and the service was pretty good.  The stuffed dates and chicken empanadas were our favorite.  I also enjoyed the flan for dessert.  Solid meal and they didn't rush you out the door....."}
{"text":"I've been recently been dubbed a \"Vegas local\" since I'm there 2~3 times a month. Unfortunately, as a \"vegas local\" and a foodie, I'm always tasked with finding great local restaurants off the strip... 1st reaction: freak out! 2nd reaction: pull up yelp app on my iPad! works everytime (not the freaking out part).

Food was absolutely AMAZING, service is very attentive, prices very reasonable. They do have a Happy Hour - drink specials only. 

Coming back very soon."}
{"text":"Finally made it to the new location, still the same menu with a great selection but the quality of the dishes has really gone downhill. 

First off, happy hour only has drinks discounts, food items are always regular price. We came in for dinner, and ordered several things. The signature bacon wrapped dates, unfortunately had a cold center and was not baked throughly, which is an indication that the kitchen was rushing and not paying attention. The other thing I did not like was the serrano ham sliders. The filet mignon patty was definitely not filet mignon, I can taste the difference, also there were pieces of bones AND chewy tendons in the patty that I had to spit out. Yuck! Also, I was informed by our waiter that the serrano ham was grounded into the patty, which I couldn't taste at all, probably due to the tiny amount of ham that was put in. 

Service was very nice,  but I'm really disappointed with the food."}
{"text":"Oh, Firefly...I wanted to give you five stars, I REALLY did. After reading amazing reviews, I attempted to make a reservation though Open Table. The time provided was a little later than I wanted so I called the restaurant directly. The hostess hung up on me the first call. She flat out told me the second call that they weren't accepting any more reservations for the evening. I wish I'd gotten your name, love, because your hosting/customer service skills are lacking.

Er, okay. I logged back into Open Table and booked a table for 2 at 9pm no problem. Kind of made me wonder if they try to lighten up the later reservations so the host staff can get cut? Anyway, we arrived at nine on the dot. And we sat. For fifteen minutes. Staring at an empty two top. Which we were eventually seated at.

We had a server...who took our order and who we pretty much never saw again until we got the check. Odd, There was an \"assistant server\"...some young girl who seemed annoyed to be there. No smile, no initiative to refill my boyfriend's Sprite. 

The food! The food! Good, great, awesome! (5/5)

The service (crying emoji face) Stop the madness. If management doesn't oversee this closely, they will crash and burn. Good food only carries you so far. Especially in a town with endless options."}
{"text":"The place was jam packed on a Sunday evening at 7:45. We had great service, the bartenders were very attentive and friendly. There was lots of energy and very pleasant atmosphere.  

Try the bacon wrapped dates and dip the free bread in the sauce. Yummy!  Very delicious.  This is a great find for both locals and visitors."}
{"text":"I was there for an event which had a buffet. I really liked almost everything about this place. The patio is huge and was perfect for our large group. The food was very good, especially considering that it was a buffet. The drinks were good, but a little overpriced. There are cheaper places to drink in Vegas! I would try their happy hour if I went back. (3-6pm)"}
{"text":"Very good flavor in all the food we ordered. The music is very loud in the restaurant, the restaurant itself is quite loud, but the impeccable service and food made up for it. 

The restaurant is about a ten minute walk from the strip which made it easy to get to. We ordered several small plates which included the Mac and cheese (AMAZING!), the chicken skewers, beef and mushroom skewers and the ahi tuna skewers ( AMAZING!). Every single dish we got was very very good. Complex flavors, not something you normally find at a place with good reviews, strangely. 

We got the dessert platter which featured 4 different desserts including the caramel flan (AMAZINGGGGGG!)

If you live in Vegas or passing by, you need to come here. No questions asked!"}
{"text":"Wasn't expecting to find such a great tapas bar in Vegas. It's off the strip, but well worth going a little out of the way. We loved everything we tried. The chicken skewers with veggies, scallops served escargot style, and bacon wrapped dates were all full of flavor. They serve bread with some kind of butter, almond butter if I remember correctly. It was different - my husband wasn't crazy about it, but I enjoyed it trying something new. 

Even though we were satisfied from the three small plates, we ordered the dessert platter. It's a good value for the money if you like sweets. I wouldn't say any specific dessert blew me away, but I am glad we got to try several different things. 

Our bill was less than $50 (before tip) for three small plates, two sodas, and the dessert - for Vegas stands that is a cheap meal, but nothing about it tasted cheap!"}
{"text":"A few friends had recommended Firefly to me so thought I'd give it a shot. Soooo glad I did! The service was amazing... Joaquin was our bartender and server. He was so knowledge and provided us great service and great drinks! The food was very good as well. We had a few appetizers and the paella.. Everything was on point! I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Great food! The filet mignon sliders were delicious! Mac n cheese was good not great. Love the ambiance."}
{"text":"This is always my first recommendation for anyone who is looking for a guaranteed good meal and visiting Las Vegas for the first time. The stuffed dates are a party in my mouth! The ham and cheese croquetas are classic and fantastic.  The service is almost always on point considering they are busy from open to close. You can have an amazing meal here and still walk out with money in your pocket."}
{"text":"So I came here again for my birthday for the 2nd year in a row.  I've been here other days, but I just happened to come here again for some reason on my birthday.  The group ordered a lot of food, and we split it amongst ourselves.  We ordered ceviche of shrimp, firefly fries, spicy beef salad, stuffed dates, albondigas, chicken and chorizo stuffed mushrooms, filet mignon sliders, crispy duck rolls, empanadas, baby back ribs, firefly fish sticks, big bowl pasta, baked brie, caramel flan, and chocolate \"tres leches\" cake.  They also gave us patatas bravas because they kept bringing it out to us even though we didn't order it.   Yes, that's a lot of food.

Now my first time eating here, it was pleasant and all the food was delicious.  This time, only partially good.  The service was lacking although I'll give them the benefit of the doubt since it's Labor Day weekend.  The fish sticks looked burned and it tasted like it too.  The free patatas bravas were charred to a black crisp, no wonder they gave those away.  They would also keep bringing us this ahi tuna skewers that we didn't order.  The crispy duck rolls were very sweet, and other than that, didn't have much flavor.  I didn't try the bowl of pasta, but there wasn't much rave about it.  People said it tastes just like any other pasta you would get anywhere.  The rest of the food was delicious though.  The Spicy Beef Salad and the stuffed dates were very good along with the baby back ribs.  I'd recommend going here on a less busy day otherwise it's too hectic, and you might get no service around here."}
{"text":"Paella, pitcher of legit sangria, a few other small plates (all of which were good) and it was the best end to our Vegas vacay."}
{"text":"yummmmmeeeeeeeee!!!!! this one is better than the paradise one (less orange people trying to be on a Vegas reality show)"}
{"text":"Very cute place with great tapas.  I would definitely recommend it as an option for something off the strip, and the prices are good too.  The only reason I give four stars is because the food does not all come out at the same time....so some people have to wait longer than others and not everybody eats at the same time."}
{"text":"DO NOT GET THE Paella. I dont know what to say, other than it wasn't good. I felt like they didn't let it cook long enough, so the flavors weren't able to seap into the rice, and there wasn't a good crust on the bottom...just a gushy mess.

Other than that, EVERYTHING WAS AWESOME and delectable. Get the pitcher of Sangria if you're with friends."}
{"text":"I ate at Firefly during all this hoopla of salmonella. Before everyone gets up in arms and judgey about my liking this place so much, I don't care. Humans are disgusting animals, and sometimes careless animals who let their food go bad. Whoops! Since I have lived in Vegas, I have been wanting to try this place. I'm proud to report that I did--also super proud that I didn't get sick off this place. Nothing short of a fantastic meal was had by me--even if others did not, sadly.

My mom and I ordered five or six small plates. The standouts were manchego mac and cheese (super bomb, I would eat this in a sandwich or on top of a pizza), the bacon wrapped dates (blue cheese to die for) and the mushroom tarte (I'm so sad I spent so much of my life hating mushrooms. They're delicious!). I would order of these again. Not so much on the duck confit egg roll--it was weird and the sauce was too sweet. 

The service was attentive as could be--the place was packed on a Thursday night at 9pm. The reviews and the patronage don't lie--this place is good. Sucks that they were careless enough to not look for salmonella on the eve of their relocation. 

I hope that Firefly can recover from this really, really bad PR. I've said it before--I'm going back and I look forward to seeing how they change it up!"}
{"text":"I had to host a happy hour for 70 people. Got referred to Fire Fly by the hotel I was staying at.  Best referral!  The management at Fire Fly was on point!  Regina and Eduardo were extremely accommodating.  Athena and Omar, the bartenders made sure cold drinks were in everyone's hands at all times.  The food was tasty as well. Defiantly a fun time had by all!"}
{"text":"I came here with friends for restaurant week. I liked the busy, dark atmosphere, the food was good, and my friends seemed to enjoy the drinks. 

I enjoyed the mixed paella, though I wish the seafood portion was a bit bigger as compared to the rice. The tapas I tried, albodigas, shrimp diablo, dates stuffed with almonds wrapped in bacon (so good), and shrimp ceviche, were all good but nothing was so outstanding that I would make a return trip. 

I'm glad to have tried to the place at least once. The other members of my party seemed to be having a good time, and so did everyone else in the restaurant."}
{"text":"This place was definitely a highlight on our Vegas trip, and worth the trip off the strip!

Any place thats packed at 10pm on a weeknight has got to be good. Of course we weren't expecting to have to wait a half hour that late, but it was worth it.

Sparkling Sangria was great, my sister didn't like her mojito too much, but I have a feeling she doesn't like mojitos at all haha.

We ordered about 6 small plates, most I cant remember. They bring you a small plate of bread, olives and some kind of delicious flavored whipped buttery stuff as soon as you sit down. It was small, but enough to keep us from eating our napkins we were so hungry.

The food was AMAZING and inexpensive too. Our favorite dish by far was the chorizo stuffed clams. O.M.G. i would seriously eat this as my last dish before I die. Heavenly. I would drive 10 hours back to vegas just for this. 

I think with drinks and however many plates we ordered it only came out to about 50 bucks!"}
{"text":"I came here with my boyfriend on valentines day, It was pretty busy so good thing he made a reservation. 
I had never been to a tapas restaurant before but it was pretty cool. the restaurant inside is very nice and cute, service was great, and food was also very good. We ordered the chicken and mushroom paella to share, and then a handful of small tapas plates.
The paella was delicious, it did not look like traditional spanish paella, but it was very good! The tapas plates we ordered were also good, the do seem a bit pricey for such cute tiny plate though. 
The only thing i didn't like was our table, it was the half booth on one side and then a chair on the other side, which is fine, but the table (that was for 2 people) was so big i felt like the people next to me could hear our whole conversation because my boyfriend was so far away.

Overall firefly was a great restaurant and i would recommend it. Im sure we will go back."}
{"text":"This place was so fun!! We hit it up for a Sunday brunch based off of Yelp reviews and honestly, it was one of our best meals in Vegas. We sat outside where a guy was playing the bongos to a DJ. Different, but cool. 

Our server was great as was everyone else who was helping. 

The food was incredible. We wanted so many things and couldn't decide, so we ended up getting way too much! Next time, I would order one thing at a time so I don't get as full. However, the online menu said that brunch came with two sides and the menu contradicted that, so I assumed the portions were small. Regardless, we loved everything we ordered!!"}
{"text":"My first dining experience at Firefly was great and it was definitely not the last time I came here!  The food is delicious, drinks are great and the atmosphere is comforting, what better place to enjoy an evening with your friends right?  

Some of my favorite things to get at Firefly include:

* Red Sangria: Delicious and sweet!  If you are not a fan of sweet drinks, you may not like this, but for those who are still new to wines, the sangria here are a great way to get you started on drinking wine!  They even mention in their menu that they marinate the sangrias three days with fruits to get its full flavor!  Included in the glass or pitcher of the sangria are cubed apples which makes the drink even more fun! 

* Stuffed dates are a must when you come to Firefly, unless you're a vegetarian of course.  But anything wrapped with bacon and baked is dangerously delicious!  Those who are allergic to almond beware, the dates are stuffed with it. ;-) 

* Filet Mignon Sliders:  Delicious and juicy!  The burger meat is very tender and it comes with a side of fried onions, that go really well with the burgers.  This is something that you should not miss at Firefly! 

* Spicy Shrimp: I'm not entirely sure of the exact name, since it was in spanish, but it was delicious!  Beware, when it says spicy, it is sure damn spicy but also flavorful!  

* Shrimp Ceviche: Served with fried won ton chips and has a tangy kick with each bite.  Not salty but very flavorful and refreshing.  

There are many more dishes to get at Firefly, but these are just a few that I recommend getting, especially the first two mentioned.  

Enjoy your experience at Firefly and don't forget! They also serve dessert! =)"}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots in Vegas to go eat, drink, take a date. Great food great staff"}
{"text":"This is probably the best tapas place I've been to, my boyfriend and I was there for 2 straight dinners during our stay in Vegas. Everything we ordered was delicious, the lamp chops were the best !  If you like food with an oriental/Chinese twist, I'd highly recommend crispy duck and garden salad. We also tried the highly praised stuffed dates from my fellow Yelpers, it's no doubt the yummiest among its kind.  I'm really impressed with their chef, who according to our waiter is from Mexico. The food is anything but Mexican, which works out with me since I was never a Mexican food fan. The only downside is that it's not that close to the strip, quite some walk to get there from flamingo & Vegas intersection. But it well worths the effort !"}
{"text":"A pleasure as always! We've been back every year with CES and love this place.  Amazing stuffed dates and patatas Bravas and tuna tartare.  Good sangria too!  Really very good! Friendly service, reasonable prices. Will return again next year!"}
{"text":"Had a great event at the Firefly last week and it was AWESOME . First the place looked great they set us up on the patio. 

The staff was more than attentive, (Thanks Carlos and crew) glasses were never empty. The plates never were not full. We finished one thing and the next came. Special requests didn't slow them down. The paella and shrimp were so so yummy. 
Please if you are in Vegas try the Firefly"}
{"text":"Loving this tapas restaurant on a lazy Sunday afternoon in April - sat on the patio and took my time enjoying a book, beer, and several tapas. The beet and roasted pear salad was perfect for a very warm day. Vegas is so crazy on the Strip, this location on Paradise Road is a welcome respite. The Tiera y Mar tapas was excellent - shrimp, filet mignon, chorizo with a salsa verde - great flavor and fun to eat, although it would be nice to offer to take them off the skewer to avoid a meat projectile. Complimentary side of toasted garlic baguette with almond butter was a great filler between course. Server Mario and staff were very friendly and efficient.  I'm guessing this place is quite busy and hectic at night, but daytime is the best choice.  Great outdoor patio for al fresco dining. I'd return on my next Vegas trip for sure."}
{"text":"I have been eating at the Firefly Restaurant for many years now and have never been disappointed.  The variety on the menu keeps me coming back and interested and I love to take new people there for inspiration on new dishes.  The service is fast and friendly and the ambiance is comfortable and energizing both for lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"I love this place.  We eat lunch here often.

Food - During my most recent visit, I had:

- Stuffed Dates...very yummy w/bacon.
- Ham & Cheese Croquetas...one of my favs.
- Vegetable Empinada....1st time trying it, was ok.
- Stuffed Mushrooms...another one of my favs.
- Firefly Fries.....you can't go here and not get these...they are addicting!

The weather was awesome, so we ate on the patio....just a great experience.  Hard to find in Vegas.

Service - The service here is always spectacular.  They are very attentive to your needs and make sure you're taken care of.

Will I return?  Absolutely!"}
{"text":"Overall good experience. Restaurant was a little noisy for our group but the service and food were pretty good. The ceviche, steak and mushroom kebabs, roasted mushrooms on toast, and some form of avocado toast were all very good. The tartar and meatballs weren't bad, but I would pass on the potatoes bravas and shaved beef sandwiches. The food came out pretty fast and service was quick except when it came time for the check (it was very busy though)"}
{"text":"UM...i think this place was a little too hyped up for me. i found their dishes salty, overwhelming, and not very impressive. i think my favorite one was tuna tartare...which you can't really go wrong with right?? maybe bc it was their least seasoned/sauced dish that i got. 

Other stuff we shared: 
Smoked salmon toast 
Pulpo asado- Grilled octopus. it was ok. 
Merguez
Stuffed dates- Bacon-wrapped date stuffed with an almond and goat cheese. This one was pretty interesting. the date was really sweet, the cheese soft, and of course, bacon makes everything savory and delicious. 
Roasted eggplant cannelloni- I did not like this AT ALL. the eggplant had absolutely no texture, overpowered by the goat cheese and strong sauce. 

the interior deco was not impressive either. dark, reddish tint...and just meh."}
{"text":"This place was so much fun and the food was delicious...the restaurant was included in a bachelorette package I booked that included 2 hours of unlimited food and drinks. Great deal for 6 of us. Service was good too, the gentleman was actually from Spain. Started with pitchers of sangrias, mojitos, and margaritas. The sangria was the best and later we tried all the different flavors they offered, all were amazing. Our server sent out the house favorites, we ate so much I honestly couldnt tell you what we had but I know we loved 95% of it.  Always recommend to any guest staying Vegas."}
{"text":"Our Saturday night dinner reservations fell through and instead of battling the lines and wait on a weekend night on the strip we went here. There was no wait for two at 8pm. Friendly service. Nicely priced and well made tapas. We ordered the sangria and 3 tapas: bacon wrapped almond/dates with a red wine reduction and blu cheese-which was flavorful savory and sweet, Shrimp Diablo which was good too-it ha: the same wine reduction base as the date tapas but with added sweet spicy chili, and we had the chorizo, shrimp and beef skewers with a tomato/chimichurri sauce that was also delicious. If you like flavorful and thick saucy dishes to dip your bread into this is the place. It was crowded (lots of large group celebrations), lively and loud and we had a wonderful time! We left full and happy!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! This is a staple when we come in to town for a Vegas vacation!! I know there was some drama with a health issue. However, I am a huge germ freak and the new location is great and the staff is wonderful!! I love this place! I wish we had one in Minnesota!!!"}
{"text":"After a long day of working in LV, my husband and I wanted a quick, delicious meal. Firefly happened to be right down the street. We were greatly surprised with the yumminess that was had. Bacon wrapped dates, artichoke toast, salads, chorizo-chicken skewer and can you say \"Sangria\"!!! I tried all three varieties..... Like candy! We will definitely be back on our next business trip!"}
{"text":"Firefly is a tapas restaurant that I'd happily welcome into my own neighborhood.  It serves moderately priced tapas off the strip.  It is obvious that this is a local gem whose value is probably overlooked as people flock to Michelin starred restaurants just blocks away.  

We started with the blue cheese, bacon wrapped stuffed dates.  These were very roasty, the bacon was crisped almost too much but they were certainly crunchy.  I liked the added crunch of the smoked almond.  The red wine reduction was interesting.  It was a very thin sauce that struggled to cling onto the food.  Sweet date, rich cheese, crunchy pork fat, smoky almond, acidic sauce - it was nice. 

The chicken skewers were one of our favorite items.  I would have never ordered them because nothing sounds more boring to me than grilled chicken.  To my surprise, the chicken was well marinated and extremely flavorful.  I really liked the roasted tomato and the garlic cream sauce.  It was also a very generous serving with quite a few skewers. 

Another favorite was the pulpo asada.  The octopus had been marinated and grilled.  It was tender and smoky with enough chew to make you remember and appreciate what it is. 

There were some dishes that were less successful.  The manchego macaroni and cheese was not well-received.  It was heavy and greasy with puddles of oil across the top of the baking dish.  The baby back ribs with a mango bbq sauce were boiled tender but otherwise not really memorable.  The mango bbq sauce was not was surprisingly boring as I expected something sweeter, tangier, or more tropical perhaps.  The dessert, a chocolate tres leches had an identity crisis.  Itwas not as creamy and milky as a regular tres leches and not as rich as a normal chocolate dessert leaving it ho hum.  

Even though I did not love every single dish, every single dish was solid and tasty.  The greatest selling point was perhaps the price and the value - good food accented by great food."}
{"text":"I chose this place for dinner for a bachelorette party, so 8 of us all dolled up came stomping in and had a nice big table. Service was friendly, but not that attentive. We often had to ask for water refills and our server disappeared many times throughout the meal. Needless to say, we all enjoyed ourselves. Food was delicious, and we ordered a ton of different dishes so we could try them all. I do have to say though that about half of our party had stomach issues a few hours later, which I'm chocking up to just eating too many different things. The food was pretty rich too.

Bacon-wrapped stuffed dates: i hate dates, but these were SUPER tasty. Only got about 5 of them per order though

Scallops: I'm also usually not a fan of scallops, but these were cooked perfectly and the polenta underneath complemented the seafood well.

Mussels: Tasty! Good. Not delicious, but not bad.

Chopped chicken salad: Tasty! Good. Not delicious, but not bad :D

Baked tetilla: basically cheese fondue. I looove me some cheese and some fondue, but the cheese had a weird rubbery consistency after a bit

Chicken and chorizo stuffed mushrooms: LOVE! So good. Mmmm

Petite filet: It was kinda rubbery meat. The steak was a disappointment

Meatballs: These were pretty good, I'd order them again

Paella: A couple of the girls in our party had been to Spain before, and they said the paella here was better. Delish!!

For all the food we ordered (we ordered multiples of the above dishes + a few I forgot to mention), dinner only came out to about $30/girl. Awesome!!

They're off the strip so you avoid the wait, the long lines, and the overpriced food. But they're also really easy to find."}
{"text":"We're just passing through Vegas and picked this one because a pro TV foodie mentioned it. Punchline: We just ate the best meal  in ages. Very deep menu of hots, colds, meats, seafood (about 15 of each). The preparation was waaaay up there: fresh, spot-on seasoning, great accompaniaments. Nice sized portion. And value-priced. The service staff (especially Nahum) was helpful, enthusiastic and made sure our order was promptly served. We ordered 5 dishes and a glass of wine at a laughable price. This gem is not far off The Strip and worth a detour. ."}
{"text":"Went here with my girlfriends!! So yummy! My favorite is the scallops!! Yummy . We are definitely coming back here!"}
{"text":"Usually when I make a trip out to Vegas, I am much too intoxicated to eat anything at a sit-down restaurant but it was my friend's birthday and his gf suggested this place and I'm glad we went! The menu is tapas style with various small plates to share family style. They also have entrees if you're the kind of person who just doesn't like to share :)

The paella takes about 40 minutes to prepare so you should order that right when you sit down as you look over the rest of the menu. We opted for the mixed paella for the table. Everyone ordered various things and honestly, EVERYTHING was delicious. I have no complaints. I had the petite filet as my main entree and it was DELICIOUS, only $15! 

From what I remember from tasting everyone's tapas, the shrimp, stuffed mushrooms, ahi tuna, chicken and rib eye entrees were ALL great! I hope I can come back soon. The menu is so extensive, there's prob around 50 tapas to try!"}
{"text":"This was a totally unexpected surprise I happen to use Yelp and read the reviews and I am happy to say that all the reviews made this Experience worthwhile... not only is the food awesome and the menu pretty diverse but the staff is phenomenal I wish I could remember everyone's name.. so I gave it five stars for the food and for the service"}
{"text":"I've had good food in the past months, but not grrrreat food!  I've been anxious to try this place since ever since.  I didn't care about doing anything else in Sin City this time around... I just had to try this place out!  

They start you off with bread, butter, and some olives.  The butter was sweet and silky; if it could keep it's form for a few hours, I'd like some to go.  I'd be snacking on bread and butter all day long. 

We ordered the paella, stuffed dates, tuna tartare w/ taro chips, and lamb kabobs on top of lentils.  The tuna tartare was fresh and lightly seasoned, which went well with the clean and crisp flavors of the taro chips.  The dates were definitely a highlight.  No need to go into lengthy detail--they are as good... as great... as everyone describes them!  If I were to ever host an event or even someday get married, stuffed dates would be on the menu!   The lamb was tasty and the lentils were evenly cooked.  I had to take baby bites thinking that our paella was coming out.  However, we find out that our server didn't take that order down.  (Boo.. minus one star.)  He said it would take 10 minutes; so I impulsively told my bf to order another dish to fill the 10 minute void.  (We could've just eaten the kabobs, but like most Asians, we'd rather have our protein with rice.)  So, he ordered the steamed mussels.  I thought steamed would mean boring.  But boy, was I wrong.  Another solid dish!  The red broth or sauce the mussels were soaked in was freaking awesome!  (They can have their one star back.)  I couldn't quite pick out the flavors, but I did taste some ginger.  Sometimes ginger can be a bit overpowering, but this was nice and subtle.  And then our paella finally came.  The paella, which had a combo of clams, mussels, chicken and chorizo, was good, but by the time it came out, we were stuffed.  We=me+bf.  We caved in to gluttony, but felt no remorse.

With Firefly's nice play on texture and awesome flavors, this was truly an unforgettable dining experience.  Firefly rocks!"}
{"text":"great vibe. but food could be a lot better. ordered the octopus, paella, anchovies, and sangria. 

paella did not have the delicious crunchy crust that it is normally associated with it. the octopus was precooked and kept too long. the octopus wasn't tender with a slight chew, it was grainy and mushy. anchovies however were perfect. salty, sour, and paired with red peppers and crunchy bread. and of course the sangria can't be beat. 


recommend for a group of friends or a casual date."}
{"text":"As a previous reviewer wrote  \"Stuffed Bacon Wrapped Dates - 'nuff said!\"  

The food is great 
The prices are right 
The service is great

We had about 8 different dishes from the dates, chicken skewers, stuffed mushrooms, filet, empanadas and a couple others for $65.00 + tip.  

Everything tasted and great and everything was little different with a unique taste.  Well, worth the $14 cab ride. 

We will definitely return when in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Wow.  Blown away.  After spending $150-$200 for dinner for two on the strip we went to this place.  On a Monday night, it was quite crowded.  My wife and I each had 3 plates, she had a high end martini, me a Pyrat rum drink and a Grand Marnier for dessert... and the bill was $74!!  AMAZING food, the Tuna Tartar and stuffed mushrooms in particular.  Only 2 blocks off the strip, this place is a GEM.  I am not easily impressed and dine out a LOT, but this place blew me away.  No complaints with noise, seating or service either......"}
{"text":"I was excited to try Firefly because of my love for tapas. Overall, everything was decent but not good. I think because I've tried some great tapas places in both SF and Portland. Firefly did not come close. The flavors were bold as tapas should be but it did not feel authentic. Something missed the marks. However, it is a great place to come with a big group and only a few minutes drive from the Strip."}
{"text":"The Food made me sick. Tapas plates were too greasy and were not prepared well. The fries was The only thing I liked. 
They post food pictures in their bathroom. I don't think that's appropriate when you see food advertising in the bathroom stall behind the door."}
{"text":"awesome place for happy hour! all the drinks were half off including pitchers. came after work with all my co-workers. ordered pitchers of white sangria, passion fruit mojito, and paradise mojitos. the paradise mojito was not my fav...it tasted like a big glass of coconut malibu. we also ordered a bunch of tapas...some stand outs were the diablo shrimp, sliders, bacon wrapped dates, chorizo and clams, chicken and chorizo stuffed mushrooms, and the firefly fries. honestly, all the food was excellent! minus one star for service...our waitress was nice but not that attentive. yea it was busy, but it would have been nice if she checked on us more often. all in all i would love to come back. =)"}
{"text":"Great Food, Great Service and Great Ambiance. We were in town for a conference and went to Firefly with two couples and was very impressed with the service and the quality of the food. Definitely a great place to go out to eat that was not expensive. Definitely a place we recommend."}
{"text":"The food was amazing. My sister took me out for dinner and at first we did not know where to go. She suggested Firefly and I had no clue what it was so I decided to give it a try. When we arrived it was full of people. The wait wasn't long but I was sure this place will be worth it.  The service and people were great. They got everything delivered in no time. The chicken salad was definitely something I would get again. I would recommend this restaurant to kids and families."}
{"text":"Wow, what a nice trendy place to get a few bites and drinks before hitting the club! I came on a Thursday night and this place was definitely 'poppin' with people.

 Myself + two decided to sit at the bar due to the quicker service.  This was only my second time here and it had been years since my first visit. A lot of tapas to choose from, creating a great variety! The prices were also very inexpensive, which already puts this place on my good list. The other 2 weren't too hungry so they opted to order a few drinks while choosing to nibble on calamari. However, I came with an empty stomach so I choose the Thai Beef Salad which sounded very appetizing at the moment. The calamari was pretty standard and would satisfy anyone's craving for this fried seafood appetizer. However, the Thai Beef salad was basically a salad with beef. Nothing in it made it Thai other than the name. 

Other than the so so salad, definitely a great experience and will be coming here more often with friends before getting our dance on at the club."}
{"text":"This is now the 3rd time I've come to Firefly. It's become a ritual where every time I'm in vegas we eat at Firefly for one of the nights. The food is absolutely delicious and very reasonably priced.

Definitely get the Tiera y Mar skewers, the patatas bravas, and the banana nutella sandwiches. The thai beef salad is also really good!"}
{"text":"Firefly is a vibrant little tapas restaurant that's great for large groups. We were treated to some nice, cool fall weather on the outdoor patio. The menu has a huge selection of tapas, broken down by hot, chilled, meat & poultry, and seafood. Their eclectic food choices are matched by their drinks menu with numerous types of cocktails, beers, wines, and sangria. 

With a large group, we were able to try a bunch of their most popular tapas. My favorites included the ahi tuna skewer with mustard-ginger glaze, the ham and cheese croquetas, and the manchego mac 'n cheese. The firefly fish sticks were a bit over-fried. For dessert, we tasted the banana-nutella sandwiches and the trio of gelatos. Nothing special that couldn't be store-bought and made at home. 

All in all, Firefly is a nice place to grab a drink and some food after work, but I imagine the value to be better during happy hour 3-6 PM or reverse happy hour 11-1 AM."}
{"text":"The tapas were surprisingly good, and they are open late.   If you're staying close by (as I was), it's worth checking out."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic from all angles. Love the tapas experience. It can get pricey quick but the selection and ability to have a little bit of everything is welcomed in this tapas setting. If you have at least 3-4 people makes it a lot easier to try many things. Sangria is also quite good. Food is real tasty and satisfies all appetites. It is a great place socially but that also means it tends to be very busy. It is worth the wait in my opinion. Have been going there for years now and appears to be the De facto place for my friends and I to celebrate birthdays."}
{"text":"Everything was so delicious, and my mouth waters as I think about the shrimp in garlic sauce! Everything sounded soo enticing on the menu, though I know from experience that I shouldn't order more than I know I could eat. In addition to the shrimp (I can't remember the name, sorry!), the tuna tartare was amazing! To accompany the tuna, were some taro chips which perfectly complimented the tuna and avocado. The only thing that I felt was a little \"meh\" was the filet mignon sliders. Don't get me wrong, it was really good. However, it was just ok compared to everything else that we ordered."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here on a recent vacation to Las Vegas. We have never been to a restaurant like this before but it was a fun experience overall. The atmosphere was rather loud for us and the tables are so big that we could barely hear each other. The food was delicious and we got to try a lot of different types of things. It was a really nice place but we would not go back."}
{"text":"Fireflys knocks it out of the park for sure.  Their staff are their key to success.  Their staff where friendly, energetic, and took care of our party very well.  We had my mothers 60th birthday party (8 people in party) , and it was beyond memorable.  Food was amazing and the drinks where tasty.  I had the seafood paella which was perfectly cooked and I finished it all (serves 2-4).  
Loved it and everytime I go to Vegas I will have good times and great food at FIREFLYS.  Thank you."}
{"text":"There's nothing to say about Firefly that others haven't already said but I'd like to offer up a few thoughts.  For one, it's gotta to be one of my favorite restaurants to be at in Vegas.  The ambiance, the aura, and the sangria/cocktails (definitely a struggling AA members nightmare), are awesome.  Secondly, I love how fast the food comes to the table when you order something.  I like things done lightning fast so I was surprised with the 21-service rating in Zagat.  I'd have thought is would have been around 23-24.  The food rating is where it's at though 24 sounds just about right.  What I love most about Firefly though is how reasonable their prices are.

Here's a listing at our recent visit:
Pitcher Sangria - $28
Boquerones - $5.50
Beet Salad - $5.50
Dates - $4
Pulpo Asado - $7.50
Steamed Mussels - $8
Empanada - $4.50
Crispy Duck Roll - $6
Babyback Ribs - $9.50
Lamb Chops - $8.50
Paella - $20

Not all of what we ordered was good.  But, all-in-all, NICE!  My favorites were the Empanada, Steamed Mussels, and Babyback Ribs.  Pretty decent dishes were the Boquerones (anchovies), Crispy Duck Roll (just the duck itself), and the Paella (although I can make a better paella with my eyes closed...paella is the only thing I can cook though).

You can't do Vegas without a visit to Firefly for some quality food at reasonable prices!"}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS TERRIBLE. WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED TO THE GOOD FOOD FROM 2005????

This used to be high atop of my list. But several cooks, and two years later, their food has gone completely downhill. Don't worry though, this place is on University Ave between Madison and Middleton, and since most people eating in Madison won't drive too far, there is no worry of accidentally walking into this place. If you do, turn around and RUN out. 

Lettuce wraps used to be with butter lettuce, now iceberg?
Curried Beef Short Ribs used to be incredible, now the recipe is completed different, and sorry, but not very good.

You would be better off fasting than eating here."}
{"text":"The food was amazing! We ordered nine different tapas and shared them all between three people- that along with a pitcher of sangria- it was plenty!!

Favorites:
Steak skewers, petit filet plate ($13!!!)
both cooked to a perfect Medium rare 
The Apple salad was perfect - and plentiful!
The shrimp cheviche  was the best I've ever had!!

Also yummy:
Baked goat cheese
Chicken salad
Artichokes toast

It was very busy, my critique would be that I called to make reservations the day before, a left a message and they never called me back. I made reservations through open table and ta-da! Rsvp's for a party of 3 at 7:30 was confirmed.

This is a *must* try place when visiting Vegas!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, friendly staff, fast service, what more could you ask for? I think they've really stepped up their game since they had issues and moved locations."}
{"text":"We found this restaurant on Yelp. It looked like it would be reasonably priced and had four star review.  We were not disappointed in fact we give it five stars! The service was so friendly and attentive. They were very busy but you need to expect to sit and relax at a place like this and enjoy the ambience and the social time...  The small plate of food items were fabulous. Their bacon wrapped dates were very good.
I think our waiter's name was Roger. He was a sweetheart. The manager came over and he was very charming as well. Thank you firefly for a great evening!!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious tapas and great for a quick, relatively inexpensive lunch. My wife and I shared four tapas:
Manchego mac & cheese
Bacon wrapped sates
Chorizo stuff mushrooms
Tuna tartare

All were delicious and it was about $35 with tip. That's great, in my opinion, for food of this caliber in Las Vegas. The service was fast and always attentive with the refills. 

My brother says the sparking sangria is awesome, but we didn't try it.

This is located in the strip mall right across the street from Del Friscos Double Eagle Steakhouse."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Expect to come for a great time & delicious food & drinks. Weekends are always packed and there's always a waiting period. I recommend their happy hour in the late afternoon where it's slower and the sangria pitcher is half off!"}
{"text":"Did not disappoint! Wide variety of tapas, and you can't beat the white sangria. My favorite has to be the bacon wrapped dates. Delicious! Plus we hit it at happy hour, so they were only $4. Actually the happy hour menu is perfect, so arrive before 6 to take advantage. Our favorite waiter, Alejandro, came by to greet us--nice touch! Although our waiter (Naum) really hustled to keep us happy. Prices are very reasonable unless you eat as many portions as we did!"}
{"text":"Full flavor tapas off the Strip so it's about 50% less cost than a casino restaurant. Service has always been attentive and prompt. Really enjoy this gem. Portions are very fulfilling and artistic. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Firefly is my go-to Happy Hour during the week. After 11pm Monday-Thursday, the fun begins. A glass of sangria for $5, and they have a small menu of tapas for $4 or $5. Always go with the Firefly fries, stuffed dates, and the chicken skewers. They have the best stuffed dates I've ever had, and the chicken skewers always have different seasonal veggies every time I go. Last time I went they had brussel sprouts. Firefly also has some of the best bread! It's a sliced garlic bread with AMAZING almond and chipotle butter I think. 

This is a great place for a late night dinner with friends, my friends are always reluctant to go but by the end of our meal they rave! They have a fun photo booth too so you can commemorate your awesome dinner."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Great service. Bacon wrapped dates, lamb chops, garbanzo beans, mushroom shrimp steak skewers were all awesome! The food came out insanely quick as well. Wish there was a location in Houston!"}
{"text":"Unimpressed by everything.  The Sangria was good,  not great and all of the food was super heavy.  I would not go back."}
{"text":"Everything was great.  Service was quick, attentive, and friendly, and not intrusive.  Blood orange mojito was incredible and very refreshing.  The plain mojito was not great, either over-muddled or using old mint, as it was very bitter and the mint was black in places.  The tortilla espanola was the least favorite dish.  It was okay, but the potatoes were underseasoned and undercooked and the dish as a whole was nothing special.  On the other hand, the patatas bravas, the mac 'n' cheese, the steak and mushroom skewers, stuffed peppers, artichoke toast, fried calamari, were all to die for.  I believe we had one other dish as well.  Stuffed peppers were my personal favorite this trip.  Perfect balance of creamy and flavorful, sweet and spicy.  Textures and flavors all went quite well together.  Also, the chocolate tres leches cake was one of the best desserts I have ever had, and I'm not even a chocolate person.  Texture was great, and the bitter cocoa flavor of the chocolate sponge cake balanced the sweetness of the milks.  Firefly is definitely a winner."}
{"text":"Great authentic tapas.  Fun, upbeat atmosphere.  Variety of people, food and drinks.  Staff was efficient, helpful and friendly!  I highly recommend ordering a few different dishes to try and sharing them. Beauty of this system of ordering is you don't have to order all at once, and the food comes quickly.."}
{"text":"Seriously, I love this place every chance I get to go.  The Red Sangria is excellent, if you want to drink alcohol and enjoy the taste too.  I love the bacon dates, firefly fries, albondigas, and Tierra y Mar.  The food was quick, drinks were 5 stars, and the general manager Carlos was nice enough to allow us to use both of our groupons.  Service was excellent and the food came out fast.  Will be returning hopefully some time soon!!!"}
{"text":"mexican people are work hard and they were very attentive nice. good quik food and tasty"}
{"text":"Firefly is closed and is  now Tex Tubbs Taco...thank god..."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was so fun and the staff were really funny and did a great job. The food was delicious!! So happy that we chose to go here!"}
{"text":"Loved it!  We were a party of 4 (business co workers).  

Seated quickly and attentive service

Food was very good.  Believe there were 12 different dishes between the 4 of us and all were good

Definitely recommend the dates and tuna"}
{"text":"I came to Firefly for my 21st birthday, and it was one of the best meals I've had! (I could be biased since it was a pretty important milestone though.) Firefly also had great value, especially considering we were too full from Hash House to try a buffet. Tapas are the way to go!

Standouts include:
Gazpacho
Stuffed mushrooms
Tilapia
Skewers -both steak and chicken

Ironically, the raspberry mojito was my least favorite part. So much for my 21st, right? At least they gave us a small dessert on the house."}
{"text":"I absolutely love coming here. I've been several times while I was visiting Vegas. The service is amazing but the food is even better. The stuffed peppers were my favorite thing I got the last time I was in. Not to mention the sangria. I recommend people to go every time someone tells me they are visiting Vegas."}
{"text":"The food and sparkling sangria are amazing! Stuffed dates, sliders, fries, baked cheese with chorizo, pretty much everything. Small plates so bring other people and order a lot to share. Even the bread and butter they bring out it good. The only thing I had there that I didn't like was a spinach salad. Go figure. The only other downside is the long wait and cramped atmosphere, but it is worth it. Go for happy hour, not as busy and have price drinks, even pitchers."}
{"text":"BEST. FOOD. in VEGAS. 

I recommend to everyone I know who travels here. 

beautiful motif, great atmosphere. Food delectable. My favorite was the chorizo clams. I could have eaten those all day."}
{"text":"I love this place!  My first indie restaurant find when I moved to Las Vegas, thanks to the Food Network.  Actually, the first time I went, I had horrible service and complained about how bad it was, but the manager comped me our next visit.  The next time the service was much better, and the food was simply delicious both times.  I've been going back ever since, and every person I bring agrees on the quality of the food.  Sangria is amazing as well -- we never go and skip at least getting one pitcher for the table.  And we're even amazed when the bill comes -- we're always stuffed (and drunk) and somehow only end up paying about $20-$25/person."}
{"text":"How can I not give Firefly 5 stars?  Same great food we've all had a million times at the Paradise location, but sooooo much closer to my house.  No wait to get a table, and the food came out super quick.  We tried a few new dishes, and they were really good.  Old ones were great, too.  Will do my best to not become a total regular here, lol."}
{"text":"I have nothing positive to say about my experience at Firefly on Paradise.  The service was the most awful thing ever.  I was in management for a Forbes rated the hotel for a long time, and I would be seriously embarrassed if my team ever acted like this team.

We were sat at a table outside, and then we were left for 20 minutes before anyone checked in on us. During this time, all the tables around us were being serviced. I watched the waiter check in with several tables. 25 minutes into this experience the busser brought waters, and the waiter came over. He didn't say Hello, he said what do you want to drink. I was expecting some type of reason why he was ignorning us. The paito wasn't that full.  He took the order and left.  During this time the manager was walking around the patio area.

I also watched the manager of Firefly mingle with what appeared to his friends and several other tables except ours. During this time, the manager made eye contact with me four times (I was giving the look of hey how's it going can you please assist me), but he failed to do anything.  He started to walk our direction, and I was about to speak up to him, but he turned his focus to a table full of young women. The service should be the focus, I can understand if you are speaking with your guests, but this was not the case.  He continued to check in on what appeared to be his friends and tables full of young women. Each time he did this he was chatting it up for several minutes.

We were still waiting for our drinks at this point about 35 minutes into our experience. At this point, we had to walk up to the bar to get our drinks because no one returned with them.  The manager also was at the bar during this interaction and failed to say anything. We mentioned our experience to the bartender and the manager could have said something, but he didn't. 

Overall, the waiter seemed mad he had to work, and the only person who was doing anything positive was the busser.  We asked our busser at one point to get send over the waiter so we could order another round.  The busser walked over to the waiter, and the waiter disappeared for several minutes before coming to our table. 

During this time, the waiter made eye contact with our table, and then walked away. I tried to give him the benefit of the doubt, but I then watched him walk inside and stand by a curtain. He wasn't doing anything for a good five minutes, and then he finally came back out, went to another table and walked away.  I had to wave him over, which I hate doing, because it is rude, however, there was no other way to get his attention.  

Eventually, our food came out, and the waiter continued to be short with us.  The food was good, but the service at this place was awful. I think the thing that rubbed me the worst about this place was that the manager failed to step in and show any interest in our situation. He seemed consumed with talking to women rather than doing his job.  This was my perception last night.

I hope everyone else doesn't experience this while you are at this establishment. Maybe it was an off night, either way, the service was horrible.  The only reason we didn't leave was because our friend loves Firefly and it was her birthday.  

I also witnessed several staff members on their phones, I can't believe this place...get your standards in with the rest of this city!"}
{"text":"I have been to firefly a few times already. Last night we arrived at about 915pm were seated in less than 5 minutes inside. The pitcher of sparkling sangria was a hit and if you drink enough you get a nice buzz. The lamb chop was cooked perfectly and melted in my mouth. The civiche de camarones is seasoned to the absolute t. Just the right amount of acid. Definitely recommend this restaurant. You can dress up or dress down either way you fit in. My date enjoyed every dish we selected which made for a nice date. Look forward to returning for another pitcher"}
{"text":"Firefly is by far one of my favorite restaurants in the city. 
I love tapas personally. I belive that variety is the spice of 
life so I like that you get several small plates, it makes me happy!
Its always busy at this location and is becoming as popular as the 
paradise location. Its easy to spend a lot of money so be careful still
and if anyone goes that hasn't been the absolute musts are:
stuffed dates; sparkling sangria;nutella sandwiches and last but 
not least the sliders.. 
You cannot go wrong with those four dishes.. oh and lets not forget the 
manchengo mac & cheese! 
Damnit now i'm drooling..!!"}
{"text":"BACON WRAPPED DATES!!! that is what you must have! the food here is delicious and the service is great. i love the atmosphere and my favorite drink is the sparking sangria. i can go here and stay for hours to talk and relax. i highly recommend firefly. 
must haves again the bacon wrapped dates, the chicken salad, the sparking sangria, and the paella..enjoy!"}
{"text":"Friends had gone on our last trip to LV and I was elsewhere. so I went with them on this next trip.  They loved it and I have to agree..it really was a nice place, cool scene but relaxed.  The food was excellent.  We had like 12 different tapas and sangria.  Really everything was pretty cool.... Definitely hitting it again next time.  With Tapas everyone has their favorite type of food so tough to say whats best.  we ordered all different types and they were all really good"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE Firefly. This was my first introduction to Tapas food and I haven't looked back since. 
There are so many great things to say. Lets start with the Sangria. The servers often say they're famous for their Sangrias, some of course are better than others and i usually recommend the sparkling, it literally drinks like juice! 
As far as the food goes its a smorgasbord of deliciousness!!! I'm a huge fan of tapas because they offer me a little taste of everything so my taste buds are happy and the prices aren't overly expensive. 
To any one going to Firefly for the first time I recommend the stuffed dates. They literally make my heart go pitter patter lol !!  Oh and dont forget the Nutella and banana sandwiches... You'll thank me later!"}
{"text":"i'm a big fan of firefly I love the food, the cocktails, and the atmosphere. The food here is tapas style so small plates. The prices per plate run from $5 to about $10 dollars each with a few larger priced entrees such as the paella. Their also known for their sangria and I personally recommend the sparkling sangria over the other two. 

The atmosphere here would be considered trendy and tends to be on the loud side but as long as you know that going in its no problem. If you go on a friday or saturday night expect service to be a little bit less than stellar because of the sheer number of people in the joint.  Some of their stand out dishes would be the bacon wrapped dates, the ham and cheese croquetas and the manchego mac & cheese."}
{"text":"A cozy establishment with a great assortment for myself, the vegetarian, and my meat-eater boyfriend. Between us we ordered, the roasted beets and persimmon salad, Firefly fries, albongigas and Chicago beef bocadillos and either of us had a complaint and enjoyed every bite. We are moving to Vegas and this is the first comeback spot we have found. Cheers!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to the Plaza location, I've been to the Paradise location and rate that place higher just because of the ambiance.

First off anything in the Plaza can't be good...walk through smoky casino floor, up shaky escalator, take a left, no a right oh wait straight through those doors up ahead.

They tried to go sheik and sexy with an amazing view, but I think all they accomplished was a second story food court with fancy tables and windows to peer down on the destitute and desperate of downtown.  That might be a little harsh but what I am getting at is the view ain't worth a star.

The food is ok but probably to pricey for what you get, $4 for 4 dates and a piece of bacon?  $7 for some shoestring fries?  Surf and Turf Skewers and Calamari are probably the best items on the menu and the Mojitos and Sangria are solid!

If you just want to get hammered on some wine and fruit in a pitcher and watch the crazy's peeps getting of the grey hound, this is the place.  But for a better time I would hit up the Paradise locale.  You're gonna spend the same amount of cash but at least there you will feel less like you paid for a bad vegas show."}
{"text":"This is one of the best restaurant that i ever visited in Las Vegas.  The place is not hard to find and the atmosphere is great, came here during Christmas eve and the people is so welcoming.

The food was delicious, it is appetizer style and encouraging us to order wine to cope with the food.

Pros: great price, great food, great service, and great decor

Cons: wine is fine but not great, bread is free but is cold upon delivered, table were ruined and bouncy.

Another thought: will visit this place again, great for dating or family or friends!"}
{"text":"To my shame, this was the first time I had Tapas in my 25 (at the time) years of existence on Earth.

My goodness, this place totally rocks!  I loved everything we ordered and it was regrettable that I did not have a bigger stomach.  Pitcher (or two... or three?) of sangria was tasty.... mmmmmmmmmmmmmm.

Finally, I loved the relative \"local joint\" feeling.  It's nice to get out of the strip area, even for a little bit, and visit where the locals eat.  I'm sure there are outsiders here too, but it's definitely less than... say Bellagio buffet lol.

I imagine that it'll be really fun to go with a big group, so you can order all the varieties and try a little bit.  Yum.  I would definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"The new Firefly on Paradise is beautiful! Upscale and trendy! Lots of delicious and fresh vegetarian options!!! And the best sparkling white sangria! Check it out!!!"}
{"text":"I studied abroad in Spain this year and therefore consider myself a tapas expert...and although Firefly tapas aren't exactly what you'd find in your typical spanish bar, they're GREAT

Suggestions: The flavored mojitos are deeeelish and only 7.50- much less than you'd pay for a drink on the strip/in a club.
-My favorite dishes were the dates, the stuffed eggplant and the Firefly fries. The bread they give you when you sit down is also great

The tortilla española was the only dish that was lacking, but maybe because that's all I ate in Spain for 4 months and therefore am familiar with the real thing.

Firefly is highly recommended for a great, more affordable dinner option a bit off the strip. Its easy to catch a cab from the strip mall its located in as well."}
{"text":"I don't live in Vegas, but I would fly back just to eat here again and again. I don't know where to begin but this is one of the best dining experiences I've had. Plus the company I was with was the best too. We waited in the bar and were seated pretty quick considering it was Friday at 8. The bartender was awesome and made me a mean dirty martini complete with blue cheese olives. Great start.

There were 6 of us and it was an ordering cluster-f*$k. But our waiter was totally all over it. He got everything down with calm ease and all the food came out so quick and no mistakes. So service was spot on. 

Ambiance was cozy, low lit and the room just buzzed of chatter. Food was AMAZING. The selection of tapas is vast! And, the portions are large and price is more than fair. I had the ahi poke, ham & cheese croquettes (unforgettable!), mussels and I forget what else. It was an orgy! Everyone sharing and gushing over how good it was. 

Firefly... I love you.  :-)"}
{"text":"For 2 of us, we ordered
Empanada (7.50), Machego mac and cheese, Steak, shrimp skewers, bacon wrapped dates, stuffed mushroom chicken. 

Meat skewers: cooked very well and had a lot of flavors

Bacon wrapped dates: crispy and declisiuos 

Empanada: It was really good but hard to justify paying 7.50 for one empanada. 

Machego mac and cheese: nothing special, tastes like mac and cheese to me 

Stuffed mushroom chicken: yummy and juicy. 

We also got a Flan dessert with a crispy waffle like roll for our anniversary and it was yummy.  


The complimentary bread looked really good from the looks of it but it tasted stale. 

Make sure you make rsvp.  I saw a bunch of people waiting when we left (around 7:30pm Saturday).  

I would come back to try their ham sliders, and paella."}
{"text":"Great food, my wife and I love the Paella, get it! It is worth the wait and best in LV, so delicious and amazing portions could easily feed 3 to 4 people."}
{"text":"been to the original numerous times and i was excited to try this westside addition.  overall the food is good but it lacks the atmosphere of the paradise location.  it looks exactly like it did when it was z tejas.  started with the serrano ham and monchego cheese tray.  the ham was buttery and the cheese had a nice sharpness that paired well with the meat.  overall an excellent start.  we also had the suffed peppers.  they were also very good.  we then ordered calamari and croquettes (neither were my choice).  the calamari was ok but too heavily breaded and the dipping sauce was way too strong.  i didn't care for the croquettes at all.  they were mostly cheese.  in fact, i tried to dig into one and find some ham but i couldn't.  the croquettes at cuba cafe are much much better.  service was attentive but not overbearing."}
{"text":"All the tapas I've had are good.  The sangria is also good.  The place can be very noisy so don't go if you're looking for an intimate dinner."}
{"text":"This is seriously an amazing Tapas restaurant and the ambiance is just perfect for a date or a group outting. 

We ordered the civiche, dates, melt in your mouth baby back ribs and for dessert we had flan and the nutela banana sandwich bites. 

The service was speedy, efficient and simply perfect.  We had a main server and a runner whom both provided us their names and recommended dishes based on what we said we liked.

My friend actually asked for an iphone 4 chsrger and the waitress was kind enough to let us use her charger & she even watched it for us while it charged.  

This is a great place to go before heading out to the clubds or bars. You can enjoy small dishes and get a littls buzz going before paying $20 for a drink in a popular club."}
{"text":"We come here every time we go to Vegas, and although it's off the strip it's a nice refreshing change to the restaurants in the casino's. 

The food is great, the prices are very reasonable and it has a really fun and lively atmosphere.

Worth making the trip off the strip for!"}
{"text":"Great food and I love all the options. Not too crowded on the weekends but I would still recommend a reservation. We didn't try a paella but we shared plenty of tapas and that Pan con tomate being the tastiest! 
I do however miss their old quaint location."}
{"text":"Bacon wrapped-dates and Camarones a la Diabla (Grilled Shrimp in a spicy sauce) were my favorites, but the Mac & Chesse and the Filet Mignon (I think?) Sliders were killer too.

We had a hard time understanding the waitress (her accent was strong), but her smile lit-up a room, so we just asked her to choose some of the \"house favorites\" for us.  She was so nice and the food outstanding.  I also ordered the garlic fries, which were a little bit nushy this time, so we just dunked 'em in the spicy sauce from the grilled shrimp!"}
{"text":"Delish menu and good service.
Trying to stay away from bread, but Firefly has the most delicious sauces you have to eat a bunch a bread to dip and soak up the sauce- so if you're on a diet- stay away from here!! Too much temptation.

I drank the red sangria- it's sweet and goes down very quickly, but not the best I've ever had... 

Food is scrumptious."}
{"text":"This was my first time having tapas and I am definitely coming here again the next time I'm in vegas! Not too pricey either. It's good to go with some friends and order a bunch of plates to share! The shrimp and filet mignon skewers were to succulent, flavorful, and very well cooked.. I'm salivating as I yelp! Check this place out for sure!"}
{"text":"My friend and I went to Fireflys for a cocktail or two (wink wink) and food. First of all, out server Andrea was AMAZING!!! She had great suggestions on her faves and we ordered them!!! The Mac N Cheese was cheesy and full of flavor. And you could never go wrong the Stuffed Dates. 
We will definitely be coming back...thanks Andrea for the great service!!!"}
{"text":"What a dive. Just like the whole of downtown. We were seated in this seedyish bar in a seedy hotel in a seedy downtown. Ordered a drink and asked some questions after getting a server to come over. 15 minutes later asked where the drinks were; 15 minutes after that we left. Ran back to the strio where we felt both cleaner and safer. Downtown is an adventure; bring your machete with you."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant with good food. I love the grilled oysters and the garden-variety salad. Next time I'll use a Groupon."}
{"text":"Great vairiety of food

This is a great off strip place to head to with a bunch of people

Nice selextion of drinks.  

Cold beer, icy glasses

I especially liked the borqueraderos, or something like that.  White anchovies"}
{"text":"I went to Firefly when it was in the Plaza quite a few years ago but haven't been to one of their locations since.  We decided to try the West Sahara location last night and am I glad we did!

We started with three plates--the Firefly fries, steak and mushroom skewers, and marinated and grilled octopus (pulpo asado).  All three dishes were excellent.  The fries are completely addictive.  You cannot stop eating them.  The have parmesan cheese and herbs on them and a side of aioli for dipping.  I liked them without dipping.  Did I mention they're addictive?  I think the FDA will soon start regulating their distribution and sale.  :)

We decided to try two more things because this is tapas.  I ordered the scallops \"escargot\" for myself and my wife got the ham and cheese croquetas.  Both were winners all the way.  The butter/garlic/herbs with the scallops fooled one into thinking they were having real escargots.  The ham and cheese deep fried croquetas were really tasty and the aioli on them was super.

Finally, we ordered some dessert.  My wife got the chocolate and cherry bread pudding with a scoop of ice cream and I ordered the banana-Nutella sandwiches.  The sandwiches had mashed bananas inside and Nutella drizzled on top and there was a small side container of more Nutella.  Absolutely delightful!!!

Our server was Joshua and he was top notch!  He answered questions we had, recommended some things when we asked, and he always saw to it that we had new glasses of iced tea before we finished the ones we had.  It seemed like everyone in the place was very customer oriented and we felt welcomed and appreciated!

I will be back to try some more of their goodies.  But, this time I'll skip the fires.  As addictive as they are, they can also be very filling and you just cannot stop eating them.  I was waiting for my wife to say, \"Put the fries down and put your arms up.\"

5 stars for a place with great food and service to match.  And, 5 stars to a place where my wife tries a piece of octopus and actually likes it!  Miracles do happen!"}
{"text":"I had a great meal here tonight.  My rating would have been 5 stars if the dishes had not come out almost concurrently.  Next time, I'll order one tapas at a time and have more time to enjoy the experience.

I had the bacon wrapped dates, the veggie empanadas, and the chicken and chorizo stuffed mushrooms.  For dessert, I splurged ands went with the dessert platter.  Wow.  Great!

I'll be back."}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch, and we were very happy. The food was very good and the wine was super. Prices were good, and the place had a very good vibe. The bacon figs were great, but the stuffed red peppers, well, the were even better. New lunch spot in The Sin..... Good work peeps."}
{"text":"Food and service are pretty equal to me. If I have a great meal I will come back to a place. If I have great service but a bad meal I'll come back and try another item or a different time of day. At Firefly you will find fantastic tapas at great prices and generally very inconsistent service to go with it.

I have been to this location 3 times and have been consistently happy with the food. The lunch deal ($10) is basically a full portion with a side and fills you up for cheap. The brunch was really good too and offers some gourmet lunch items in small sizes. I really liked the breakfast tacos and benedicts. The chicken skewers are a must for the lunch deal and the Firefly french fries are a delicious go-to when ordering off of the regular menu (get extra aioli).  I haven't found a favorite dish yet because everything I've tried has been great so far.

The happy hour wasn't really described by my server but the gist seemed to be 50% off everything from the drink book from 3-6pm and no food items are discounted.  We got a large pitcher of white sangria (delicious) and it came out to a total of $14 on the bill, what a steal!

On the flip side the service has been pretty nonexistent all 3 times. Does your server ever come back to check on your food or allow you to order more food? Rarely, and usually by then you aren't hungry for more. Does your server bring you water or keep it full? Not when you sit in the on the patio.... although a female back-waiter we had yesterday was very attentive.  It seems that the only time we had good service was when the restaurant was actually busy instead of an off time.  The bartender was chewing gum with her mouth open while talking to guests, there were servers on the floor talking in large groups instead of working and one server was even at a table with his cell phone out for a good 5 minutes before he left the table.  We also saw that fabled creature, a manager, for the first time as well.  But with all of the above we still had an awkward server that forced some jokes and seemed to be around when we needed him, which was a welcomed change to the type of service we usually get here.

The food is fantastic, reasonable priced for gourmet style, and the service is hit or miss.  Will I be back?  Absolutely, I'll just make sure I come during regular times instead of off times.

{"text":"This place was AWESOME!  Great TAPAS and a really nice environment.   The only problem we had was not knowing when to stop ordering!  Well....that and we were slightly underdressed compared to the other clients."}
{"text":"Always a favorite place to eat when I'm in Vegas awesome delicious food and great atmosphere definitely recommend this restaurant if you are in Vegas ...."}
{"text":"Just ehhhhh. Every time I am here I want everything to be just has great as the Sangria and I am always disappointed. The only thing I really love is the parm fries, but on occasion they are way to salty and stale. But I love the atmosphere, by atmosphere I mean the Latin concepts and hustle and bustle of the staff. it needs to be bigger with a better floor design. It feels musty and dirty most of the time.  I want to love this place but I just can't."}
{"text":"Awesome food, drinks ands atmosphere !!! Always a good time when my friends and I go here"}
{"text":"I'm so glad we got off of the strip for dinner! Though I saw all the stellar reviews by those I know and trust, I was still a little skeptical (or perhaps it was residual grumpiness from not being able to get a table at Mesa Grill..).

Our party of 5 snagged a table easily at about 7:30 on a Saturday night. I think it was sheer luck and great timing because thereafter I could see groups waiting outside and as we were leaving lines of people (lots of feathers, wigs, bunny ears, sequins - you name it! Vegas is so crazy) 
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/firefly-las-vegas-3#pcF2Ql6hcUzQ3Oey_mX-zA

I love LOVE LOVE LOVE tapas bars!  Firefly truly embodied the style I became accustomed to in other major cities, extensive menu, contemporary twist on latin-inspired cuisine, priced to order multiple and share and tasty cocktails. 

The ambiance was cozy, loud and exciting - the smells of delicious food, glasses and plates clinking and excited chatter was a nice background to the awesome dinner we enjoyed.  

Remembering our dinner almost a month ago, I've got to echo the hundreds of other reviewers in saying GET THE BACON-WRAPPED DATES!!!!  We did and loved them so much we ordered them twice!
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/firefly-las-vegas-3#iv_9yqEHI5K5FFmBR2FYZA

I'd also highly recommend you save a tiny bit of room in your tummy for the dessert platter!
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/firefly-las-vegas-3#AatAVzAxwN6YmxCozEAMcQ

The house-made infused vodka drink was also really good, It could have been a tad stronger so I recommend ordering a extra shot of vodka on the side to amp it up :)"}
{"text":"Very nice Tapas place! We (5 of us) were there for happy hour and got a pitcher of Sangria an a bunch of the happy hour tapas. The pitcher only cost $18 and there was enough for all 5 plus refills for two people. I would highly recommend the stuffed dates, very amazing."}
{"text":"Went here based on the yelp reviews and yes because I saw it on tv.   We pretty much ordered what the other yelpers said were must haves and a couple of things to our tasting. Everything was very flavorful and decent portions considering they are tapas and supposed to be small plates.  We ordered the stuffed dates which was the smallest portion and after one bite you know why, they were really rich and sweet, this was not my favorite thing and probably will not order this again. We also ordered the filet mignon sliders (yummy),the firefly fries (a must), steamed mussels (I think we should have ordered the clams instead), and the calamari ( fresh but the star was the dipping sauce). My only complaint was the sangria, it tasted watered down and didn't include any fruit which I think is a must with sangria. Overall a very cool place to hit away from the strip."}
{"text":"Got seated in a flash! Our server Michael was super nice, everything came to our table hot from the kitchen. Food was perfect! Good job guys!"}
{"text":"Always a delightful dining experience! Tasty food fantastic service. Our server was so on point he had the good decency to ask each of us if we had any food allergies before taking our orders which is very rare but welcome! Food was prompt but the fries were quite soggy (only negative) still a favorite."}
{"text":"I always take my friends and family to FIREFLY. When I lived in Vegas, it was a great date night place and I am missing it now!!! 

The sparkling sangria is perfect. I love sangria and this one is sweet and bubbly, great on hot Vegas days! Get a pitcher and enjoy your surroundings, plus it will get you feelin' good as your delicious tapas come out. 

The must-haves:

Bacon Wrapped Dates-everyone likes these. EVERYONE. I don't like bleu cheese and the little pieces in this make the dish stand out! GET THEM. 

Anchovy toast things-Boquerones? I probably just butchered that. Anyways. THIS IS MY FAV!! I know I know, anchovy whaaaaat!!!? But for real get it. White anchovy on toast points with avocado, roasted red peppers and a lemony sauce....it is SO GOOD. I didn't want it, my date insisted, and it's now my favorite dish. A balance of seafood saltiness and creamy avocado...omg yum. 

Manchego Mac N Cheese- I'm a lover of all things cheese and this is great, baked on top which just enhances the texture. 

Stuffed Peppers- cheesy, creamy, and fried onions for crunch. Love this. 


Nutella Banana Sandwich Dessert. Explained itself. 

 
The ambiance is fantastic, the drinks are strong and delicious, and the pricing is great (especially for Vegas), and service has always been very helpful and friendly!"}
{"text":"LOVED it!  No doubt we would return.  Everything we had we were a fan of.  I could have skipped the desert platter (I LOVE desert and it wasn't rich enough for me :) )  We were very happy :)"}
{"text":"This is my go to place for happy hour and taking out of town guests.  Happy hour is daily from 3-6 (5 on Fridays).  The drinks are half off.  Tapas is a great option for a snack or light dinner.  The prices are right and slightly off the strip for visitors.  
My favs are the blood orange mojito and the baked tetilla."}
{"text":"Checked this place out it ,was close to the hotel ,nice atmosphere , OK service  , food was good, but limited choices for picky kids. Would recommend if you want to try something different"}
{"text":"I LOVE THE FOOD AT THE FIREFLY.  I usually go to the one on Paradise.  The food quality is just as good at this location.  I like the fact that this location is more spacious, the staff is more attentive and the food came out way faster.

However, had to subtract 1 star because parking sucks here.  Had to pay $5 at the Plaza lot next to the Greyhound station"}
{"text":"Was in town in Vegas for a short get away trip with my girlfriends and wanted to go back to Firefly since we remember the food was awesome from the previous visit before the restaurant moved to a bigger and nicer place (few doors down), but this time it was a disappointment. Sorry Firefly.. Your service was good since it was a late lunch, and it wasn't crowded, but your food has changed and not how we remembered it. We each ordered 2 dishes (total 12) plus a paella. Every thing was mediocre except for the scallop with butter and garlic sauce, the mussels, and the salads.. But other dishes either were too sweet (the ribs, shrimps, octopus), and the paella was not even close to be ok. It wasn't your thing. It has too much tomato sauce which causes the dish too wet, and the mussels, clams, shrimp were too dried. Hmm.. Not sure if we would come back here again for the good old time.. You had it going, but not sure what went wrong?? Did you change the chef or just simply because of the expansion that made it go out of hand? Hope you could pull it together so i could recommend others when they're in town because the new place looks awesome with good decor and vibe."}
{"text":"I ate there on April 25, the day before the board of health shut it down for 3 dozen cases of food poisoning. I choose firefly based on the comments on Yelp. From NY, and now back home and suffering from food poisoning from their cheap and bad food. Be warned, if they open again. What happens in Vegas does not stay there."}
{"text":"Awesome!! Tried many dishes and all were yummy!! Highly recommend tuna tartar!!!! Stuffed peppers definitely need to order!!! Highly highly recommended! Very nice atmosphere and reasonably priced! The hostess actually walks around looking for you after your table is ready! Pomegranate monitor delicious!!"}
{"text":"Great place for any occasion. Very friendly staff that is always willing to make suggestions. Can't pick a wrong dish! Everything is ridiculously GOOD!! Even if it sounds like something u won't like try it. I was shocked when I tried the date  . And they have great happy hr deals and reverse happy hour."}
{"text":"As Owl City famously once said: \"Try the Sangria, it's delicious.\" With the drinks sorted out, you have a multitude of tapas options... and I haven't met a menu item I didn't like. The apple salad or tempura shrimp are always good picks. Great place to bring the posse."}
{"text":"I found out about this place through Groupon & it was really good!
The location could be better (It's in a slightly ghetto area).
But once you're inside, it's great.
I love the ambience/decor (Red lamps & damask wallpaper are nice).
Feels like a trendy lounge atmosphere.
Food is delicious!
Service was fast, friendly, & attentive."}
{"text":"We came here for a light lunch during the day , but I imagine the place would look pretty hip for a nighttime hangout with friends. My previous experience with Spanish tapas was pretty unremarkable... until I came to Firefly. I wasn't expecting much from bacon wrapped dates since I'm not a fan of bacon, but I was blown away by the unexpected sweet and crunchy flavor of the ones served here. They were like little bites of candy.  Bacon+ dates+ blue cheese+ almonds=genius! 

The empanadas were also delicioso but the paella was so-so here."}
{"text":"(3.5 stars)

Firefly serves the purpose if you're looking for an alternative away from the strip and want a casual bite to eat. There are PLENTY of options on the menu to keep everyone happy!  

On our plate - 
* Veggie Empanada - crisp, flaky and flavorful.
* Warm Spinach Salad - with artichoke, red pepper, pine nuts, feta and a dash of lemon. The slightly warmed up spinach gave the salad a nice body and the addition of pine nuts added a great crunch. 
* Baked Goat Cheese - can't really go wrong with baked cheese! Ever. This was creamy and melt-in-the-mouth delicious.
* Shrimp in lemon garlic butter sauce - the sauce was good, but the shrimp did not absorb any of it and seemed to be tossed in it a few minutes right before serving.
* Grilled octopus - very disappointing, the octopus was chewy and didn't taste fresh at all...the sauce lacked seasoning as well. 

Service was friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"Wanting to stay away from the hotel dining  scene we headed over to \"Firefly\"!  Holy crap....This place was PACKED on Friday night.  Luckily we had a reservation for 6 and only waited for a about 10mins for a table.  Without reservations we would have been looking at at least an hour wait.  Overall we had a great experience.   The sangria was good and the tapas were even better.  Great little people watching spot to boot.  And last but not least, since I treated my peeps it wasn't  too hard on my AMEX card.  We will definitely be back..."}
{"text":"I was designated as the planner for my friend's bachelor party, and was guided here by the yelp forums.  I decided to give them a call and before I knew it, I was already picking out menu items.  For the tapas banquet, it is all you can eat, and you can choose 6 items from their entire menu of tapas, except for the lamb chops.  We went with:

Empanadas - good, but a bit filling..and the sauce is a little on the rich side
Steak and Shrimp Skewers - has a piece of sausage on top as well, very good, but their chimichurri sauce is a little on the salty side
Ahi Tuna Skewers - the one thing we shouldn't have ordered, the tuna was a bit dry and did not mesh too well with the fruit it had on the skewer
Filet Mignon Sliders - excellent, although some burgers had a bit too much sauce on them...also a major filler on the all you can eat...they kind of killed a few of us and ended our eating...haha...
Spicy Shrimp - my favorite thing we ordered, delicious, sweet and spicy and cooked to perfection
Mango Baby Back Ribs - these were a hit with everyone...numerous rounds of these...fall off the bone (baked I think for any bbq snobs out there)...with a nice mango glaze...i personally have had better ribs, but these are better than your average baby back rib you will get at a non-bbq joint...

The service here started off very slow, and with a 22 man bachelor party, you could just feel the antsyness kicking in when there was no food or drinks for about 15 min.  However, once the food started coming out, the service went from 0-60 in about 5 seconds.  The wait staff got into their rhythm and it was smooth sailing the rest of the night.  We even had 5 stragglers who were already pre-paid for, show up about an hour late, and the staff accomodated them as if nothing was wrong.  

This place is just OK for big groups, as they do not have private rooms or anything, but perfect for medium size groups of 10 or so.  It is also good for casual diners as well.  haha  The food is excellent and service is pretty good.  I would definitely recommend this place to anyone out in vegas and would return."}
{"text":"This place is pretty awesome!  It was my first Tapas experience as well as having Sangria throughout my dinner.  We stayed there for a good 2.5 hours!

What we ordered:
-Pomegranate Mojito: strong....but good!
-PitcherSangria ;) - super yummy and good buzz!
-Firefly flies - yummers..keeps the buzz at bay. haha
-Steak and mushroom skewers - delish! not too well done..just right!
-Stuffed Dates - kind of different...sweet and salty!
-Banana Nutella sandwiches - YUMMY!  I love nutella and I love bananas...great combination!
-Tuna tartare...I've had way better.  Good, but could taste more fresh

I think this is a great interactive restaurant where you can share tapas with everyone at your table.  Kind of like Chinese dim sum, but the plates are much larger with a much bigger serving.  And Tapas is spanish. LOL

I thought it would be quite expensive, but the price was just right and well worth it.  Great atmosphere, great strong drinks, and fantastic food to tantalize your palate!

Go now, with great people, and have a great time!"}
{"text":"Everything we had was amazing. The table ooh'd and aww'd with every bite. The bread and spread alone are wicked good. I can just eat that alone and be happy. Seriously.
Any way, what did we order?

1. 2 pitchers of Sangria (one white, one red) Both tasted good! Comes with infused apple pieces. 
2. Bacon wrapped dates. These are off the charts! Crispy and extreme flavor!
3. Manchego Macaroni and Cheese; the best cheese to use in this dish - so decadent!
4. Tuna Tartare  with Taro Chips; this is really good and refreshing. Tasty!
5. Steak and Mushroom skewers. I wish I knew what kind of sauce they use for this cause it's fabulous! 
6. Ham and Cheese Croquetas - manchego cheese again! Yum! Some thought it was a bit salty; but I love salt! LOL.
7. Baked Cheese; whoa! Didn't think I'd like it, but I loved it!
8. Firefly fries; great combo with the Sangria; carbo load while drinking! Plus their fried to perfection and has a great seasoning!
9. Paella! Whoa! We got the seafood one and it was a great ending to the rest of our tapas! It was able to give a sampling to 7 people and everyone loved it!

You can't go wrong with anything you order here. Everything tastes so good. I have brought friends and family alike here, and it is ALWAYS a winner and becomes a favorite to all! Go now!"}
{"text":"Firefly was an amazing experience

Pros:
1. All of the food tasted amazing and came out in a timely fashion

2. Our server Elena and Jazzy was attentive and efficient

3. There were no tables inside, but the outdoor sitting area had fire pillars to keep you warm (see picture)

4. The bathrooms were clean and had around 5 stalls so there was no line for women (always a plus)

Cons:
1. Our entree came out before a lot of our tapas which was weird for me

2. The blue cheese on top of the steak was a bit much so if you don't love blue cheese ask for it on the side


What we ordered:
1. Scallops Escargots (hot tapas)
2. Lamb chops (hot tapas)
3. Roasted Eggplant Cannelloni (hot tapas)
4. Stuffed dates (hot tapas)
5. Chicken and Chorizo Stuffed Mushrooms (hot tapas)
6. Blue Cheese Ribeye
7. Flan (not a huge fan)
8. Chocolate and cherry bread pudding (delish)"}

Happy hour:
Monday-Thurs 3PM-6PM, Fri 3PM-5PM.

The night I came here with a party of about 25 people it was a disaster.  Food was great but service was horrible.  When I say service, I mean only the waiter.  Drinks took forever to come out, refills bahh, food plates remained on table as more food was being served, and we never got bread.  Can't split checks, come on upgrade your system.  - 2 stars.

Came again for happy hour with just one other and the food still tasted great.  Bacon wrapped dates still delicious, mango ribs still killed it, firefly fries, sangria, everything was just as good but with better service.  - 4 stars.

If I ever come back, it'll probably be for happy hour.  And I would definitely recommend Firefly's for one of Vegas' best happy hour option."}

tapas and sangria were enjoyed by all, especially the bacon wrapped dates, the mac and cheese, the filet mignon sliders, the lamb skewers, the thai beef salad. some people will be like, oh is this place authentic? blah blah. well, it's better than some food I had in barcelona, if that answers your question, and I had some food in spain that could never be beat by anything stateside. 

Who cares? It tastes good and you'll have fun, but make sure you get the sangria."}
{"text":"Seriously....if you haven't been to a firefly yet, you've been living under a rock.  

Trendy, upbeat atmosphere coupled with tasty beverages and chic tapas style food makes this a winning hotspot.

Happy hour is awesome.  Food is normal prices but ALL drinks are 50% off! That's right! That means you can get a pitcher of sangria for $14 or a pitcher of mojitos for $15.  That could be the price of one glass elsewhere!  You can get a glass for $2.50 or a shot of infused tequila for the same price! Bananas!  Wines are priced low anyhow... $5 -12. But at 50% off, this is probably the best drink prices you'll find!

Went on a date with my hubs yesterday.  We shared a pitcher of white sangria which was zingy and refreshing.  We also had mussels.  They were served steamed to perfection in a spicy curry coconut broth with a baked baguette crusted with cheese.  Very good!  We also had the thai beef salad.  The flavor of pickled ginger is overwhelming; however, I love that flavor so its fine by me.  The bacon wrapped dates are a winner too.  They are crispy and hot and served with a stinky blue cheese and an incredible red wine sauce.  Ask for extra bread to soak up the sauce and they will gladly bring it to you.  

Firefly is always good; however, if youve been as many time as I have to their three locations, you know....nothing ever changes! It's the same menu all the time for like 7 years!  YAWN! Personally, I am hoping they will wise up and create some specials and new items!  I know, if it ain't broke, don't fix it, but we are begging for more!"}
{"text":"After looking at their menu online, my boyfriend decided to eat dinner here for our monthly date. We didn't have a reservation, but the hostess seated us fairly quickly considering the fact that it was busy. The menu was organized and really easy to read so that helped me to order what I wanted to eat. We ordered Apple and Manchego Salad, Stuffed dates, Scallop Escargots, Camarones a la Diabla, and the Seafood Paella. The food was delicious! I do wish that the Camarones a la Diabla had a little more shrimp because there was only 4 pieces, and the Paella wasn't so salty, but asides that everything else came out wonderful!"}
{"text":"Have been here twice... It was 8 pm on a Saturday night-the music was loud and almost all of the inside tables were packed so we sat on the patio that had outdoor heaters.  

We started with the Tortilla a la española.  They were lukewarm and sort of bland...Next we had the often touted Stuffed dates-neither one of us found them anything to brag about.  The Manchego mac 'n' cheese was good-but once again, nothing I would find myself craving... My hubby ordered the Filet mignon sliders that come w/Serrano ham, cabrales cheese, caramelized onions. My husband said they were \"ok\" and  but he did not taste any ham and did not bother to finish.  We also ordered the Firefly fries-they were just ok.  

The star of the whole night was the bread they brought out first with almond butter.  So delicous! I could have had that all night and maybe given 3 stars!
  
Honestly it just could be that the dishes we ordered weren't the best and I would be willing to give them a try again since there are so many options and so many people rave about the place. The concept is great and it seems like a perfect place to have a large & casual get together.

I won't write them off yet! : )"}
{"text":"I had found this place via Yelp, and meanwhile a friend sent along a list of \"10 best Vegas restaurants\", and they were on it! I definitely agree they should be! This was really good. We ordered 4 tapas plates for 3 people, and each of them was memorably good. Generous portions for tapas, delicious. Ample parking. Attentive service. There was road construction in the general vicinity, but that amounted to a minor annoyance (especially since I wasn't the driver)."}
{"text":"Funny to see the last person who reviewed Firefly is my brother! Hahaha. My hubby and I went to Firefly two nights in a row. It's a less than $10 cab ride from Renaissance Hotel on this last vacay in Vegas. We discovered Firefly back in 2005. ALWAYS enjoy their tapas, love the stuffed dates and red sangria!!! Been telling friends & family for years about this fun place! They now have misters to keep you cool on the outside patio & have opened up next door to accomadate more patrons. Incidentally, the previous review was made the weekend before we came for Mr Olympia. We both live in California."}
{"text":"Used to love this place so much but the quality seems to have changed quiet a bit and they got rid of some of the best dishes and don't have many vegan options."}
{"text":"Excellent flavors. Stuffed Dates and Terra y Mare Skewers were my favorites. Packed with flavor. The sauce on the Terra y Mare Skewers was delicious. The Smoked Salmon Toasts were pretty average but tasty with the capers. And the Empanadas were only average. The ground meat inside wasn't that impressive, and the aioli on top was a negative for me but I'm not a fan of mayonnaise-based sauces.

Berry and lychee infused vodka. Sounds good. Love lychee. But didn't love this housemade vodka.

They have a small patio seating area, which would be fun to sit at when it's cooler (not in the middle of summer), so keep that in mind when planning a visit to this tapas restaurant. There's also a main dining area and bar with a detached dining area next door. Dark ambience and not really a good place for little kids with the squished seating.

Lemon berry tartlets for dessert were excellent but a tapas sized portion. Enough to clean the palate and satisfy a sweet craving but not nearly enough if you like to have your large-portion dessert at the end of a meal. 

Overall, it was great as a food experience. If you're sick of eating at the big expensive steak restaurants on the strip, try this place."}
{"text":"I don't know what to add that hasn't already been said. Great food, very attentive service, and plenty of tapa options (some authentic, some more of a latin fusion, but all delicious). We didn't have a plate we didn't enjoy, and lets not disregard how reasonably priced everything was! 

Recommendations: Chorizo clams, tierra y mar skewers, & stuffed dates."}
{"text":"Food was ok. Pallea had shell fish that wasn't properly cleaned...got a bit of sand and one of the giant shrimps still had most of its vein...yucky. The service and callamary was great. Red sangria was great also!"}
{"text":"I have had this place bookmarked for I don't even know how long but I have been low key scared to check it out because of the Salmonella out break a few years back. Finally I found a friend who wanted to go and check it out! 

We went on a Wednesday during happy hour (3PM-6PM) and it was pretty much empty. I have a weakness for Mojitos and they have like 9 different flavors. I asked our waitress what she would recommend and she had me try the Paradise Mojito and it tasted like a tropical getaway. With hints of pineapple and coconut this was truly refreshing, And during happy hour they were only $5.00 or a whole pitcher for $18.00!

We got quite a few tapas to share and everything we got I would definitely recommend/get again:

Artichoke Hearts 5/5

Firefly Fries (Happy Hour) 5/5

Calamari 5/5

Filet Skewers 4/5

Stuffed Dates (Happy Hour) 4/5

Shrimp Ceviche 4/5

Warm Spinach Salad 4/5

We ended the day with a beautiful Flan dessert!

I cannot wait to come back and try even more of their expansive menu!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place! Never had a bad meal or service here and much more reasonably priced than all other tapas in Vegas. A must try!"}
{"text":"Still in my top 5 favorite restaurants.  I brought 4 new people here and they raved about the variety and creativeness of the tapas.  Pitchers of mojito's rolled and we finished with some tres leches and flan.  what a killer place.  I hear they opened another location in DT LV.  I'll have to try that next time.  My go to place when in sin city."}
{"text":"The food is just as good as the paradise location but this place is big and so it's hard to get the same atmosphere.  We did walk right in on a Thu night and get a table at 9:30PM.  You gotta love that at this place!  We had great service and a nice light show from Fremont St. from our table."}
{"text":"Once again awesome tapas and sangria!  All for the same price as three margaritas at the Jose Cuervo  airport bar.  I love the new location!  I hope the kitchen issues are behind you firefly!"}
{"text":"Rasberry and blood orange mojito and lamb skewers this time. mmmhhh everything was to die for."}
{"text":"I thought the food was pretty good. I have done alot of really good Tapas and this was just pretty good. These guys pack it in like sardines and a young good looking crowd it is. Too busy for me on the weekends I would go back but there are many other fish in the sea so it won't be soon."}
{"text":"Started this past Saturday night out at Firefly for some drinks and a light meal before hitting the clubs. We arrived sometime between 7:30 and 8, couldn't find a parking spot anywhere near the actual restaurant. Ended up parking at the medical plaza behind the strip mall that Firefly is in, there was a lot of parking available back there. 

The hostess working was both adorable and friendly, she informed us it would be about a 30 minute wait and invites us to have a drink in the bar area. I had read a few reviews raving about the watermelon mojitos so that is what I decided to order... As soon as I did Dawn C. looked over at me with wide eyes and said YUM, ME TOO! so we decided to go with the pitcher instead. Pitchers are definitely the way to go, $30 for what ended up being 3-4 drinks each. The mojitos were the perfect amount of sweetness, went down so easy. 

30 minutes flew by and the hostess found us in the bar area and took us to our seats outside. October evenings are beautiful here in Vegas, just cool enough to be enjoyable without needing a jacket. 

While we were waiting in the bar area, Dawn C. and I had talked a bit about what we were thinking about ordering, based on the reviews we had read. Once we were seated and had menus to look over we finalized our decision, and went with: 

Tuna tartar - Disappointing. This was one I wanted to order and it was pretty bland. The mangos were the best part. I would not order this again.
Lamb skewers - Dawn C picked these and I was glad she did. I don't eat much lamb but these make me want to. 
Ham and cheese croquettes - Mmmm. Only bad part is they only serve you 3. So creamy and good. Would order again. 
Shrimp Ceviche - Some of the best ceviche I have had in a long time. The shrimp were sweet, the citrusy marinade complimented them perfectly. Would also order this again.

Total for the food was around $30, plus the $30 pitcher makes for a not bad cost for a nice dinner out. Firefly is a place I'd definitely go back to on a date or with a group of friends."}
{"text":"One of the best tapas restuarants I've been to.  My second favorite is the Firefly in Summerlin.

I like the overall ambience here.  Everyone mingling and everyone having a good time. This place can bring you at ease. You almost feel like you're in a club in this location.  

This location get's pretty busy compared to the Summerlin location. So, expect a lot of people, but don't expect to wait. I've never had to wait to be seated at this place. 

Whether you're visiting or local, you have to try Firefly at least once. This a great place to hang out with friends, take a date or significant other, mistress, and even some co-workers to relieve some work related stress.  But I wouldn't suggest this place if you're taking the family out or if you're by yourself.  I've been to this location about 4 times and the Summerlin location 2 times.  Almost everytime, there's a group or single person not handling their liquor well.  

My Suggestions:
Artichoke Toast
Mac N Cheese
The Skewers: Forgot the name but has shrimp, filet mignon, and some pork
Fried Calamari:  Not uncommon for us to order extra
Chicken Skewers
Petite Filet
Stuff Mushrooms

All the portions are small and very inexpensive.  You can come out of here spending very little.  The drinks will cost you more than the food. The experience...priceless."}
{"text":"So much delicious items in the menu, try different of them and share with those in your family or group. I highly recommend this restaurant. :)"}
{"text":"Firefly, I really do love you. They have some great tapas, if you're in town, you need to stop in. The stuffed dates are so good. I highly recommend the red sangria, it's really good. My favorite item to get is the steak and mushroom skewers, they're cooked in a red wine reduction; and it's amazing. 

The only reason I couldn't give 5 stars is because of the service. The service is pretty terrible at best. Everyone looks annoyed to be there, and the servers tend to disappear after you order only to be briefly replaced by what they call, an assistant server. They look even more annoyed that the regular servers. 

Firefly, please hire some better servers. The service needs to be comparable to the food!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food, great staff.   We go there once a year when we visit Las Vegas. The Tapas are fantastic, just order tapas with Sangria and your evening will be perfect.  You need to try this place !"}
{"text":"Small plates are one of my favorite ways to dine and I've been fortunate to have great tapas/small plates in different parts of the country.  After reading all the reviews on Firefly, we were all geared up for good drinks and grub!  The place, in a strip mall, had a great vibe.  Their was a large group of people next to us and we liked the fun and friendly vibe of the place.  The menu was great, lots of selections, and we enjoyed a decent pitcher of mojitos waiting eagerly for our tapas.  At the waiter's recommendation, my hubbie and I ordered the beaf/ shrimp/ chourizo skewers (very good); stuffed red Spanish peppers (okay but strangely chewy cheese in center--not cooked enough?); calamari (too, too salty--skip it!); cherry crispy duck rolls (dry--skip it); and spinach salad (very good).  But the desserts reigned supreme--the housemade gelato and chocolate tres leche cake is what earned this restaurant three stars.  Considering it's in Las Vegas, the value for the money is good but the quality is only okay, and overall, wouldn't go back considering location off strip and the $15 taxi ride each way from Paris."}
{"text":"If you are a fan of Tapas and are looking in Vegas, Firefly is the place to be. Yummy Yummy Yummy. With the all window atmosphere, our evening meal was super cool due to the Fremont Experience (like in the picture). The service was fast and our waitress super nice. We left after feasting! We all picked 3 tapas while in retrospect we had wished we only picked 2... there was A LOT of food."}
{"text":"I love, love, love Firefly!  I love tapas!!  We used to frequent Cha Cha Cha back in SF so when we discovered Firefly a few years back, we knew we had to check them out!

So here we are, 4 years later, and I still love Firefly each time we go.  It always seems like it's packed so reservations are your best bet.

Alright, down to the chow:
Sangria- both the red and white are good, depends if you are a white wine or red wine person.  The pitcher is well worth it cause you get almost 3 glasses per person ( based on two ppl)

Bacon wrapped dates-love them! This took me awhile to get used to as I'm not a fan of sweet/savory but this combo really works.  And they really char the bacon, just how I like it, crunchy and salty on the outside and sweet and chewy on the inside...YUM

Camarones Al Diabla- SO good!!!! The sauce is what makes this dish..it's slightly sweet, tangy, salty...SO good to dip your bread in, this dish is a MUST every time..

Lamb chops- I love lamb so they couldn't go wrong with this, just don't overcook it and we are good.  It came out pink in the inside and had a nice char on the outside..perfecto..

Overall- this is definitely my go to restaurant when I have visitors in town or special occasions..."}
{"text":"To give this place a thorough review, I really need to go back again, but I was so happy with my first visit here, I feel compelled.  On a Thursday night, a group of girls were getting together here for happy hour.  Aaron the bartender started early in the little overflow room, so we got there at 5 p.m.

I didn't eat much, but I did try the bacon wrapped dates (holy cow, this is amazing) and a meatball.  The meatball was aight, but dang, that date was orgasmic.  I love dates, but this took it to a whole new level.  Really really good.  Now on to what I did have a lot of: drinks!  Firefly has sangria in so many many flavors, but I opted for the flavored mojito.  I ordered passionfruit, but Aaron also offered a few samples of blueberry and raspberry mojito.  All really good and I don't even like raspberry.  This place really lives up to the hype.  Great food, great drinks and an awesome bartender: Aaron.  If you haven't been, you've got to go.  I can't believe I waited so long.  I plan on making Firefly a regular pit stop."}
{"text":"Firefly is one of those off-the-strip places that Vegas locals love.  It's a tapas bar (not to be confused with topless bar) serving up Spanish small plates packed with big flavors.  The sangria is plentiful, the music is loud and the place is always busy, especially late at night. So don't be surprised if there's a wait at 1am on a week night.  It's a cool place to grab a bite, a drink, or have a full-on meal.  Since the dishes are small and reasonably priced, it's great for sharing and trying a variety of things. Me and the hubs have always had a huge soft spot for Firefly.

Our Favorites:
Red Sangria- fruity but strong. My absolute favorite sangria in the world... (and I've studied abroad in Spain!)

Filet mignon sliders $7.50-  Serrano ham, cabrales cheese, caramelized onions

Manchego Mac and cheese $8

Ham and cheese croquetas $5 - fried pillowy bites of potato filled with hot melted cheese and ham... this is a must!

Albondigas $4.50- meatballs in sherry tomato sauce, parmesan

Baked tetilla $7- roasted tomato and tetilla cheese fondue with chorizo, toasts... oooooh baby good

Crispy duck rolls with cherry hoisin sauce $8

Firefly Fries $5.50- some of the best fries I've had.  Thinly cut, seasoned and topped with parmesan and herbs.  The aioli is worth licking the cup clean.

Firefly has opened another location in downtown LV because they are THAT awesome.  Maybe they'll be spreading the love this direction sometime soon? Fingers crossed."}
{"text":"Cancelled flight took me to the Fairfield Inn. The front desk clerk recommended this place that is next door. Fantastic service and the happy hour menu is one of the best! I had the chicken skewers char grilled with fingerling potatoes asparagus and a garlic cream sauce and a cucumber martini with Bombay Sapphire gin for 11 dollars! Stayed at Caesars Palace the night before and spent that on a cup of coffee."}
{"text":"If you have to be downtown, you'll survive eating here. But this is not the amazing food Vegas is known for. It is, however, an interesting place to look out over Fremont St.

When we travel, we usually throw the Vegan thing out the window and go straight Vegetarian because we are lazy. Thank goodness we did that night because I understand their chef employs a strict \"if there ain't no meat, bring in the cheese!\" policy. So, while the menu does have vegetarian options, they're rather lacto-extremo. Generally, the dishes were bland to boot. 

One thing they know how to do there is mix a mojito that delights the senses. Very well-balanced. 

Looking around the restaurant we did have get a good chuckle seeing  a concentrated group of late 20's/early 30's couples like us for the first time since we'd been on Fremont - The Yelpitarians were out in force. I think it's the only well-reviewed joint within walking distance of Fremont, and that's probably fair, but still not a good reason to skip the cab ride to the finer food."}
{"text":"Excellent service! Almost too attentive! Great food! Took my husband to dinner he had never been and I had never been to this location. Very good."}
{"text":"Everything we ordered was absolutely fabulous. Food was served very quickly, excellent service. Loved the atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I was disappointed by this restaurant -- it did not live up to the reviews.  It is true that this is an affordable tapas restaurant, but the food was just ok.  It wasn't horrible.  But nothing was really a wow."}
{"text":"Food

Pulpo Asado 

Nose of skillet potato with a hint of sea brininess and tomato. Octopus had grilled nose, very gently salty and spicy palate with soft consistency with only a hint of chewiness. Potato was skillet with skin. Smokey nose, a bit of saltiness with skin crunchiness. Some sautéed small-diced pepper, tomato, and green onion added accent. I think potato was unnecessary. 4.25/5. 4.5/5 without potato.

Merguez

Nose of feta cheese and tomato-pepper confit. Gamy lamb nose on the sausage, followed by medium saltiness and high black-pepperiness. Feta gave accent and tomato-pepper confit gave sourness fresh counterbalance. Eat them together. 4.5/5.




Service

Half bar half trendy bistro. Bar open seating. Food delivery is as authentic Spanish as the tapasAlcohol service. 4/5.


Ambience

A trendy bistro for a nice getaway. 4/5.


Overall

A delicious food at a crowded trendy place. 4.5/5."}
{"text":"The food was delicious! From the egg plant to the scallop escargot and beat salad. We loved everything. The steak & shrimp skewers made the meal. Nahum our server was a highlight of the evening.  Go here ... you will be glad you did!"}
{"text":"I'm not really that fond of the food on the menu, but I go here for the pitchers of sangria! And the staff! Both are amazing! and If you go during HAPPY HOUR, they are half off...well, the sangrias are. lol

Cons: the later you go, the harder it is to get a seat because this place is always buzzing after about 6pm. You can expect a wait time of no shorter than about 30 minutes....The bar area is really small and only seats about 15 comfortably so as it gets later, there's usually lots of people crammed in standing around."}
{"text":"First timer here. Walking in and getting seated was nice and easy. Luckily we had no wait. We ordered the Tierra y Mar skewers which had chorizo, shrimp, and steak. Definitely recommend it . Our second mini dish was the empanadas. We were a little disappointed with it. It's only one small empanada cut in half. The meat was okay in flavor just wish it contained more than just meat. For drinks we ordered sangria and a raspberry mojito. Over all food was a 4 out of 5. Reason I'm giving only two stars is because the service was not what it should have been. We had to keep waving down our server and our plates were never picked up until about 15 minutes once we waved down one of the hostess. 
Also hostess did not seem happy to stop and see what we needed. After wards the person that came to help us and bring us the check was very rude and just dropped the bill off with out saying a word or looking at us. Really wish we could have been treated better . ALSO I mentioned it was my wife's birthday and not once did they even say happy birthday. 
REMEMBER customer service makes a huge difference in a persons visit to your business."}
{"text":"Great value for the price. Many options to choose from. Service was excellent. Kept the tables clear of dirty plates and always there when you needed them. Flan was amazing too."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to go to!  It's a great place, so it's always crowded, even with reservations, you'll have to wait a little.

All the dishes are great, the waiters and bartenders are very customer oriented, but the hostesses are OK. They forget they are the first ones customers see when we walk in and they have to finish their conversations before accommodating us. Hence the 4 stars. 

This place is perfect for dates, intimate ones, and also groups- girls' night, birthdays, etc; any kind of celebration; The vibe makes you really happy yet relaxed; but never sleepy =)

They need to open up a few more!!!"}
{"text":"Best Tapas in town! Every time I come to Vegas I have to stop and enjoy the food! Best lamb chops ever!! Stuffed peppers to die!! Just everything is delish!! Come you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"WOW! How did I not know about this place any sooner?!

We came here for dinner on Saturday night and our server Carlos was just downright AWESOME. He was attentive, courteous, and offered excellent meal recommendations! I love that we didn't feel like we were rushed given how long the wait was and how crowded the place was. We got to enjoy our meal - people watch a bit and take in all the flavors of the amazing food. 

Food - bring a huge appetite because this place will rock your taste buds. My favorite staple of the night was the Apple Manchego salad - order it!! It was crunchy and salty and every bit amazing. I almost wanted to order another plate to go as a late night snack post drinking. We also ordered the veggie empanadas, the petite filet, the firefly french fires and for dessert - the trio of gelato. If you aren't drooling yet - you should really re-read what I just ordered. The food came out as each plate was ready and it was nice and hot. I did think we could have lived without the fries. It didn't have much of a wow factor compared to the other dishes we ordered. The food tasted great and it probably now my go to place for every vegas trip going forward. 

Amazing food - awesome service and no fancy price tag. Gotta love that! Be sure to make reservation. There are always large groups here so to avoid the wait, plan ahead. Also perfect place for group dinners!"}
{"text":"Went here for a friend's birthday. Haven't been since they closed down the original one across the parking lot.

One thing that struck me is how big Firefly is. It's a huge establishment which is nice. I feel the new location is much bigger than the old place. This is a definite plus.

Drinks. I did not order a fruity drink (like sangria or mojito) but I saw people order them. The mojitos are drowning in mint. Barely any drink in there. That was a downside. The beers on tap though are actually pretty good. You would think they would only specialize in mixed drinks, but they had some nice Belgian Tripels on tap that really packed a punch.

Food. The bacon wrapped stuffed dates are what you get. Get a couple of orders. Quite possibly the best item on the menu. Fried Calamari was okay, they give you a bunch. Bit chewier than I wanted it but it was still good. Empanadas were okay, nothing special. Tierra y mar skewers were very delicious. This is the one with filet mignon on a skewer along with some other tasty morsels. For dessert, the flan was fantastic. 

Service. Just like many other restaurants, there seems to be a communication issue with servers. You'll have a server take your order (dates), then they'll disappear. Another server will come and take someone else's order. That person's order will come out before yours. You'll see another server, ask about your order as another server is walking aimlessly around asking every table if they ordered dates. This just happens so often with every order. Luckily, all my food arrived without much trouble but I can only imagine that other people's meals aren't so lucky. The positive is that every server was very nice and was trying very hard. 

Overall, I like the new location better. It's bigger, better atmosphere and the food didn't make me sick."}
{"text":"Firefly is a great place, but I've had a couple of not so great experiences with their seafood, which is a shame cause I love ze fishies."}
{"text":"If you're in the mood for tapas. Check out Firefly on Paradise next time you're in Las Vegas. Located off the strip and away from all the riff raff, Firefly offers yummy ceviche of red snapper, stuffed dates, roasted eggplant canneloni, tuna carpaccio, baked shrimp with roasted garlic cream, chorizo clams, empanadillas, skewer of beef, and so much more. 

I had a great experience here, much better than any of the overpriced fine dining restaurants in Vegas.

With excellent service and reasonable prices. Tourists, venture off of Las Vegas Blvd and onto Paradise Road!!"}
{"text":"I type this in my hospital bed so I'm sure you know where I'm going with this. I as ate here 4/23/12 with about 5 other friends from out of town to show off how amazing this place is. And it was another great dining experience.... 

72 hours later or less and I'm in a state of what seems to be nearing death.  And it seemed none of my friends were affected but they were/are. I just happened to get it the worst!! 

I've been a firefly customer for 5 years! Never have I gone through anything like this. I may never come back and never recommend this particular firefly to
Anyone or anyone coming to visit Las Vegas... I'm still in shock this has happened.  Most expensive dining experience ever. Thanks a lot.


*** also this was no food poisoning I got for all you dim witted fools that think otherwise. Salmonella feels like and is (currently) Hell. 



SALMONELLA"}
{"text":"I didn't really know what to expect going here, but was pleasantly surprised by how good the food was.  I had the apple and cheese salad which had a little kick to it thanks to some finely chopped cilantro.  Then I tried a mini fillet mingon which took a while to get to the table but was worth the wait.  I ordered it without mushrooms and the first one came swimming in them.  It was ten dollars and in my opinion a really good deal.  The mac and cheese was gooey goodness.  I ordered the dessert platter but wasn't impressed with anything because the cheesecake was too tart for me and the rest was just okay.  The only thing I didn't like was the service was a bit sketchy.  It started out great but over the course of the meal, but the waiter was few and far between after we were seated.  I couldn't even ask for sugar for my tea until halfway through the meal.  My party had to grab several people walking by to get service and it took at least thirty minutes to get our check.  I'm looking forward to trying out the other location because the food was very yum."}
{"text":"Excellent tapas and service.  We probably tried about 10 different tapas and they were all pretty good.  The tuna tartar was excellent as was the petite filet.  The petite filet arrived well after all our other food and without even asking, they removed it from the bill.  That is the kind of service that I like, not having to ask them to do the right thing.  The sangria is excellent as was the outdoor seating.  For a pitcher of sangria plus all our tapas (less the petite filet) it was $88, not bad for a big dinner.

100% would eat here again and recommend to friends"}
{"text":"Modern Spanish tapas.  Big classy place.  The recommended mac & cheese and empanadas were great.  Warm spinach salad was good.  Mojitos were quite decent.  Prices were fair for LV."}
{"text":"Love. 

My husband and I were trying to keep our Vegas budget on the low side, but it seems all the best places would break the bank. When I found Firefly on yelp I was pretty jazzed and I was not dissapointed. 

It's kind of pricey to get to if you are carless (we paid about $15 to get there from Manadaly Bay) but I suppose that's vegas for you. Seriously, your cabs are expensive! I could have gotten from the Sears Tower to Wrigleyfield in Chicago for that price! ....anyways....It was worth it - fun atrmosphere, excellent food, service was great and we got full and tipsy for under $80.

We shared a pitcher of red sangira ($24), the ham and cheese croquettas (mmm), the mini filet sliders (awesome!), the veggie empanadas (okay) and the duck eggrolls (all duck and damn tasty). For dessert my hubs had the flan which was really good and I had the chocolate tres leches cake. Um, I've never had anything so good in my life. I shit you not. Never. And I eat. Look at my picture - this girl has had a few desserts in her life. This was, if not the best, maybe number two. It was that good. 

Next time I am in Vegas, I will definately be coming back to Firefly and getting more of that cake!"}
{"text":"Firefly is my go to place when I stop my gambling frenzy and realize that all the typical restaurants have already closed and I'm hungry.  So whether you want to load up on a bunch of tapas or are just looking for a place to drink without having to talk over loud club music, this is worth going to.  I had a whole bunch of dishes and can't remember them all so I just wrote a few of the memorable ones:

Tuna Tartare:  layers of mango, marinated ahi tuna, avocado, taro chips.  Can you say yum?

Ceviche of shrimp:  tiger shrimp, avocado, crispy corn tortilla.  Just the right marinade of flavors mixed together.

Stuffed dates:  bacon-wrapped, smoked almond, red wine reduction, blue cheese.  If you told me to order this, I would decline.  But if someone else is ordering it, of course it's obligatory to try, right?  O-M-G.  What a delightful surprise of deliciousness!  

A group of us went and shared a whole bunch of dishes so it was perfect, while we talked and drank.  There was a slight wait, even at 11pm at night but we didn't mind since we could order drinks at the bar.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Firefly overlooks the Fremont Street Experience and is a nice place to go to, whether you're loading up on a bunch of tapas or you're going for drinks.  I had a whole bunch of dishes and can't remember them all but here are a few of the memorable ones:

Tuna Tartare:  layers of mango, marinated ahi tuna, avocado, taro chips.  Can you say yum?

Ceviche of shrimp:  tiger shrimp, avocado, crispy corn tortilla.  Just the right marinade of flavors mixed together.

A group of six of us went and shared a whole bunch of dishes so it was perfect, while we talked and drank.  The only reason for the one start ding is because service was very intermittent at times.  But when they did manage to come to our table, it was very polite and the order was brought promptly.  But my idea of good service is not having to ever have an empty glass on the table.  Fail.  Luckily, we were all have fun so it wasn't too big of a deal.  You should definitely go here at least once, after the Plaza is done with their renovations."}
{"text":"Larger location with a much larger patio. Service is much more personal and more attentive. The food is much better quality with bigger portions and the alcohol is flowing a lot better. It's obvious Firefly is trying to gain there customer base back. I will continue to be loyal to this amazing restaurant."}
{"text":"Love love their Sangria and tapas. 

The place is the go to when you come to Vegas.

I have been coming here almost every time I'm in Vegas and have yet to get disappointed. Wait time can be insane but its will worth the wait. Perfect environment to mingle, bring a date, have a girls night out or anything you can think of.

The last time I came here was last year, Yes - VERY late review but always better late than never. Been craving for their jambalaya and sangria, not to mention I will be purchasing my flight to go satisfy that craving - crossing fingers its still just as good as I remembered."}
{"text":"Always have and always will come to this place. 

Went to the old and still with the new. Tapas all around with yummy sangria. Doesn't take look to be seated but I do highly recommend reservations because it can get busy and expect to wait. If you didn't make reservations, don't worry, there is a bar where you can sit and enjoy a glass or two of beverages. 

My hubby and I love coming here. This is our must go to every time, so highly recommend it.

I will be coming here in the next few months so I will try to take some photos before we devour it."}
{"text":"Easy lyft ride from our hotel to the restaurant.  They wouldn't take reservations  on same day (knock a half star for that), but we took a chance, just showed up at around 7:00 and were seated right away.  Surprisingly, there were many seats available for a Sat. Night.  We ordered 6 dishes and I specifically had a discussion with our waiter to bring a couple of dishes out, wait till we were almost done and then bring the rest.  So what happens?  They brought all dishes out at once!! For that poor service, I knock a half star.  Food was good.  Not amazing, but good except for a couple dishes.  Highlights we're the bacon wrapped dates, firefly sticks and ahi Tatar.  We weren't crazy about the stuffed peppers (cheese was just too heavy, thick and flavorless).  Also disappointing was the Tres Leches desert.  Too dense compared to others we've had in the past. The restaurant is nice, clean has a good vibe and we will probably go back with a larger crowd so we can try more items."}
{"text":"The gf never been and wanted to try this place and for so long, I kept saying it's overrated as I've been quite a few times and it was very average at best.  So last week, felt like hanging out more than eating so decided to take her to a great hang out spot: yup, Firefly, where there's always a nice crowd.

Surprise, surprise. Since I was the veteran, I ordered the mojito, bacon wrapped dates, the lobster escargot, and the Ribeye with Firefly fries. All of it was not bad at all.

The knock was for the lobster escargot. When it came out, I thought the server had served us someone's leftover by mistake but to our surprise, that's it. Picture about 6 little lumps the size of m&m's if not smaller served in a garlic plate.  True story, after eating about 2 little lumps, the busser came by and asked if we were done with the dish, and I looked at him and he looked at me and realized that we had just started on the dish. Despite this little awkwardness, the service was excellent. I will be coming back more often.

Note: I always hear that Firefly is cheap. It's not. The menu price is deceiving because the portions are SO small that I've never walked out of that place for less than $50 for 2 despite usually not even drinking alcohol."}
{"text":"Love this place! The small \"Tapas\" style food means I get to taste several items, which makes my taste buds happy:) Food is priced well, atmosphere is fun and funky, and the service is super.  Have and will continue to visit. 

P.S. Mac and Cheese is magnanimous!! Order one for yourself, you wont want to share this Tapa."}
{"text":"I cried when I heard that the downtown Firefly had closed. Literally. In this hour of sorrow, I can comfort myself with the fact that I enjoyed the chorizo stuffed mushrooms and pitchers of delicious sangria here as many times as I could during this restaurant's short life. Still, it's cold comfort.

RIP Downtown Firefly - let's hope your successor can live up to your high standards. Somehow, I doubt it."}
{"text":"made a reservation on Valentines day @ midnight (they're open late which is very awesome) crowded but had our table ready, parking is not great  so arrive early if you have reservations, good place for groups since you can all try a little of everything, we ordered the pitcher of red sangria ($24) which was not bad, but for our second pitcher we tried the passion fruit mojito ($30) which I really liked.  Total bill for 5 people $142-not bad considering 2 pitchers of booze, 10 different types of tapas, and 3 desserts. ** recommend the mushroom tart, stuffed dates because everyone else yelped about those so I had to see for myself, banana nutella sandwiches because face it...Nutella is good with anything and the choc tres leches cake.  I will definitely be back!**reservations booked through opentable.com"}
{"text":"The food here was surprisingly good and the service was perfect.  I ordered several tapas...the best was the calamari and the worst was the octopus (it was like a \"fear factor\" challenge).  Even though the food was exceptional, I can't imagine returning since it just wasn't my scene.  Any time I looked around the room, I was horrified by the other people there.  Mostly 30-something's who get their fashion ideas from TRL (the table near me had a young father with a mohawk and his little baby had a mohawk too).   Now that I think about it, there was a lot of bad hair."}
{"text":"I feel the need to not only give a bomb-ass review to Firefly but to stand up for them despite what happened at one of their locations within the last few weeks.  First of all, let's all be sure to understand - when you go out to eat, you are choosing to put yourself at risk to any number of things that could happen.  You could slip and fall walking into a restaurant or yes, you could eat food that won't sit well with you.  Neither event is ideal to you and certainly not ideal to the owner/staff of the establishment.  People get into the restaurant business mostly because they want to host and give everyone a great experience.  They never anticipate the unfortunate event that the science of food and cosmic forces at work will cause anyone to get sick.  So, let's not continue to punish them because I'm sure they feel bad enough.

Again, being new to the Vegas scene, there are sooo many places that I have yet to try.  One of the fellow foodie girls that I work with had been insisting that I needed to try Firefly so we took advantage of the only night we were both free! Again, I have to say - I LOVE WHERE I LIVE! Firefly is a 10 minute or less drive down the street from me that requires all of 2 turns to get to.  The decor and set-up is pretty standard but with the kind of food they are serving - they don't need to worry 'bout it! We shared a pitcher of the red sangria that was BOMB.  I'm pretty sure I consumed most of it but she was busy talking so I don't think she noticed.  As far as food, we tried SO MUCH! I'm so glad I saved the receipt to know exactly what I had so I can be sure to try more next time: tuna tartare, terra y mare, camarones diabla, petite filet, dates, camarones ajillo and the banana nutella dessert.  The bonus of this place is that everything (with the exception of the dessert) was Paleo-friendly! I mean seriously, meat on sticks with sauces?! You've got this girl's heart.  And I'm sorry, don't put nutella on the menu unless you want to see me dominate a plate - because that's exactly what happened.  We rounded out the night with a shot of Don Julio and their Ginger-Pear cocktail and I'm already excited to go back!"}
{"text":"First off, parking was a nightmare. I would avoid this place Friday to Sunday for dinner. Yes, there's free valet but they park your car like they're playing tetris. 

Next, the food. The food presentation is great as is the ambiance, but most of what we got was jusy OK. Based on the price point and parking experience I probably would not be back. Yardbird was better. 

*BACON WRAPPED DATES: sweet and savory bites of heaven. A MUST TRY. 

*STUFFED PEPPERS: good flavor just a bit much on the cream cheese. 

*FIREFLY FRIES: you can get these fries at McDonald's and sprinkle Parmesan on it. The Parmesan melted together and was difficult to distribute for taste. 

*FIREFLY BURGER : we asked for medium, but it was pretty much med rare. Nothing special just your average burger. 

 *PAELLA, as others have mentioned - order first as it takes like 30 to 40 min. It was good, but unfortunately we were pretty much full when it arrived at our table."}
{"text":"I love this place and make it a point to go there at least once when I visit Vegas.

Local friends introduced me to it years ago. It's always crowded, but service is still pretty good for the amount of business they handle. 

I love the Sangrias and Mojitos. Never ever have I left sober from here. :-)

This is my favorite tapas place of all tapas places, including the ones in LA, and it's also not as expensive as fanc, wanna-be tapas places in LA are. Such a variety! You can never pick enough plates, there are always a bunch left that you want to try. I just love the fact that I can have 5-6-7 different dishes and not just 2. I can't even pick favorites, although it seems that I always start with the Apple & Manchego salad and I always have at least one order of the fish sticks.

I love the fact that even vegetarians or people who don't eat red meat can choose from a lot of stuff. They even made me the blue cheese stuffed dates without the bacon wrapped around it once. I usually have a lot of seafood and veggie tapas and some chicken.

Even the music is Spanish speaking (sometimes American songs covered by a Spanish speaking band), so it totally fits the atmosphere. 

All in all, I can't say enough good things about this place. 
I love it here."}
{"text":"This is a great place to go off the strip.  We actually went twice while we were in town.  You can't beat the great food and reasonable prices.  I highly recommend the dates, empanadas, and chorizo stuffed mushrooms!"}
{"text":"I just had to try this place out when I was in ATL for the weekend and I'm glad I did! The service was awesome and the food was amazing. I had the mango ribs and they were delicious!! They fell off the bone with each bite. I also had a steak dish but I can't remember exactly what it was to be honest but it also delicious. It was a big crowd on the couch area but I sat at the tables by the bar. I dont know if you have to make reservations to sit on the other side but it seemed like it. Everything came out quick. Now I will say that the drinks weren't memorable. 


The bathroom was clean and everyone seemed to be friendly. I will be back !"}
{"text":"Only been here a few times but every time I've been in, I was never disappointed! This past time, however, every dish we had was amazing!

We started off with the apple manchego salad. AMAZING. Who would've thought sliced apples and manchego cheese together would make such an appetizing dish?! This is a must order for me every time I'm here. Definitely shareable too!

We sat at the bar, to which our bartender was very knowledgeable on the menu and suggested many items to fit our taste buds/diet. 
We then ordered their shrimp ceviche, tuna tartare, and scallops \"escargot\" from his many, delicious sounding, suggestions. 

Their shrimp ceviche makes my mouth water just thinking about it. SO FLAVORFUL! Its a little on the citrusy side, but I loved it that way. They came with crackers so balance out the lemon. *droool*

The tuna tartare came with taro chips, which by the way, are my faavorite, so it instantly got a lot of lovinnnn from me. But the tuna tartare alone was delicious. It's basically ahi tuna and avocado, and their seasonings, sprinkled with love. 

And lastly, the scallops escargot was very delightful! Herby, buttery, breaded goodness with a nice lilll scallop in the middle. 


Those four were about 50 dollars, give or take. I absolutely love tapas for the fact being you can try many different options on the menu without breaking the bank. And with that, I absolutely love this place! The portion sizes, yeah they're still small plated, but I feel like they still give you a good amount! We're small girls tho, so that was enough to fill us up without feeling too full

Also, side note, on another occasion, I had their stuffed dates and those are just as bomb as everything else :) try everything! Or atleast what I've mentioned."}
{"text":"I've always heard this place had really good Sangrias. But no chance to try it yet! After the whole massacre of everyone getting sick from the other location of Fireflys on Paradise, I was thinking \"wth\"...they should of bumped it up a notch on being clean at this location right? The service was great, not once was our water glasses not filled up. I ordered the ahi tuna tar tar plate and sad to say the tuna tasted not really fresh at all. The meat looked dark, i thought it was just the sauce. The chicken empanada came in just 1 piece cut in half. Kinda disappointing for $8 bucks if i remember the price correctly. However, the mango bbq ribs plate was the best! And the bacon wrapped dates we're amazing too. The steak and mushroom skewers were good also. Take notes, they are tapas so most of the plates are very small dishes. The dessert was next and I got the dessert sampler. The cheesecake was sour, the flan tasted like spoiled milk at first, but my friend loved the tres leches cake. So this place really has its up and downs on food plates. I would come back, but maybe think twice about what i ordered before & get a glass of red sangria. ;)"}
{"text":"Pros:
Food is pretty good
Large selection
Lots of vegetarian and vegan items
Moderate pricing

Cons:
Loud, definitely have to increase your voice level to talk to the person across the table from you
Some dishes could be executed better 

I came here with my friend on a Thursday night and we were seated within five minutes though the place is filled and booming. One of the most immediate things we noticed was the volume of the setting. We chose four tapas plates, albondigas, empanadas, scallops escargot, and heart of palm \"crab cakes.\" 

The albondigas which are a type of meatball in a tomato sauce with cheese were delicious and warm. 

The empanadas, which was really just one cut in half was good, but maybe a little heavy. I understand that it is an empanada, but I've had empanadas that are lighter and airier. The pulled pork with the cream cheese and the aioli on top was a little much. 

The scallops \"escargots\" were good, they came in a pesto like sauce with a lemon to squeeze over. They were good, the flavor was spot on but... I wish they were seared more for a crisp outside, they didn't have much of a crust at all, so I was slightly disappointed. 

The palm of hearts crab cakes was vegan, really just a mix of vegetables seasoned with old bay and served with a mustard aioli which was quite citrusy. These were good, but not necessarily crabby except for the old bay and the shape of them. However, they were still tasty. 

Overall, I'd return, but I'd likely try some of their other dishes, which isn't a problem because they have a huge variety. Our bill was $36 for four plates."}
{"text":"Thank you fellow Yelpers! I was able to find this great place through you. Went here for a late night dinner and it was so damn good. There were 4 us. We started off with ordering a pitcher of red sangria which gave us about two glasses each. Each of us picked 2 plates to being with. I can't honestly say I remember all of the plates since we were randomly picking off the menu. I can say though, as each one came, they got better and better. We were all pretty fully satisfied, but did end up ordering 2 more plates because we really wanted to try them out. We had steak, chorizo, shrimp and mango skewer, Ceviche, ahi skewer, stuffed peppers, Diablo shrimp, chicken skewers, goat cheese dip, petite filet, and mussels. They were all great dishes. We had absolutely so complaints. Service was great, staff were friendly and helpful. Place was nice and clean with attractive decor. Bomb!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and even better food!! They have a delicious brunch menu for Saturday's. My mouth is watering now thinking about it! 

Must try's: pumpkin beignets, watermelon water, salmon toast!"}
{"text":"This is by no means the first time I have been to Firefly. It has been a place I go now and then over the years for a late night bite to eat or a social gathering or two. Sometimes it's loud and there are tons of people.. but the food usually quality and if you can get a table you are golden. 

I went again the other night and it seems they have done away with alot of the clutter, added more dining areas and used the once \"Dragonfly\" Sushi next door ( a short-lived endeavor) and turned it into a disco ball having lounge of sorts. ( I haven't ventured in there yet) So the dining room is free for just that. The food is always good, inexpensive and easy to get to. 

Between my friend and I, we shared a pitcher of red sangria, 4 tapas and dessert.. the bill was about 60 bucks. Not bad for an hour and a half of dining for two peeps. Check it out. Its a fun spot!"}
{"text":"Nice place to grab a drink and a small meal.

Waiter was nice.  We didn't know what to order. The waiter told us what was popular and some of his favorites.  We tried the stuffed dates, it was very flavorful.  We also tried the lamb chops. Lamb chops were good."}
{"text":"Super tasty Spanish restaurant.  Ordered 4 or 5 tapas to eat while we waited on the made to order paella.  Everything tasted so good.  Inside seating is quiet and dark, and outside is lively and fun.  Best part is they are open late.  My friends and I went around 1am after doing some late night Fremont street exploring.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great food love the sangria! Happy hour before 6pm is always great since the majority of tapas that I order is on the happy hour menu plus the sangria. I love the Tuna tar tar, sliders comes with shelters and blue cheese if you don't like that then let your server know and also read INGREDIENTS it's very annoying to hear people around us that they didn't like a certain thing. Service was a bit slow could use some work on faster paced but our server was very attentive when he did arrive."}
{"text":"Ask the locals and they'll all tell you to go to Firefly. Great place about a block away from the strip that touches all your senses! 
Sexy dark ambiance more on the casual-chic side.
Service is meh.
Food is AMAZEBALLS!
Wine, tapas and good company...what more could you want?

So 4 girls walk in to this place and had to seat themselves and wave down a waiter after a long wait. Menu has a great selection of items. Bacon wrapped dates are great. Manchego mac and cheeze is to die for, Tuna tartare is ok, Baby beet salad is :), Camarones a la diabla MAS POR FAVOR!, Petite Filet my fav, stuffed mushrooms you can't go wrong, Lamb Skewers bueno, and steamed mussels gotta have em! Four girls left stuffed and ready for a nap. Speechless none the less. 

You are doing yourself a diservice if you don't try this place! Wish we had one in LA :("}
{"text":"We got in pretty late from Orange County on a Friday and decided to skip the obligatory In-N-Out stop in Barstow to try a late night joint in Vegas. I spent most of the car ride yelping on my phone (and no, I wasn't driving) and decided to give Firefly a try. It had good yelp reviews plus I remeber seeing Rachel Ray go there so figured it would be a good option.
I was a little hesitant to try a tapas place since I was afraid the small portions would be too much of a tease and my husband is pretty opposed to anything \"hip\" such as the tapas trend but all I needed to know is it had three of favorite things in the world- gazpacho, Nutella and mojitos and I was sold.
We got to Firefly shortly after midnight and I was pretty surprised to find it almost completely full. Since we were expecting pretty small portions, we ordered wayyy to much for 2 people. We ordered:
---Gazpacho- very good flavor, but i prefer it a little thicker. Perhaps I'm used to Gazpacho at Spago.
---Firefly fries- very good, good flavor/seasoning. Wayyy bigger portion than expected, plenty for 4+ people to share. The two of us couldn't finish it.
---Filet mignon sliders. Soooo good! My husband's favorite dish of the night. 2 pretty big sliders, each close to the size of a regular McDonalds burger. Will definitely be ordering this again.
---Empenadas- Weakest dish of the night. Not bad but didn't compare to the other things we ordered. Kinda weird flavor, maybe cause I don't normally order pork.
-Baked tetilla- sooo good! I'd say its comparable to a similar dish I've had at Mesa grill. Gooey flavorful cheese, how can you go wrong with that?
---Nutella/ banana sandwiches-all i can is yummmmm. No joke one of the best things I've ever had but as I've stated before, I love Nutella. The dipping sauce plus the sandwich somehow just works wonders to my taste buds. I tried to describe it in a coherent way but words fail me. All I could think was that it had 3 different dimensions of goodness. Definitely a winner to end a great meal

I also had a passionfruit mojito which was pretty good and strong and the red sangria which was pretty good as well. My husband ordered 3 beers and they accidentally brought him an extra they didn't charge for. All together our bill was around $80 which considering the amount of food or drink we had, I would say it wasn't too bad. A similar meal on the strip would probably be twice the price. 
The service was pretty good and quick. Dim lighting and surprisingly good acoustics. Fun, hip atmosphere. I will definetly be back again. Next time I will try the bacon wrapped dates for sure and I will be ordering the nutella sandwiches everytime I come here without a doubt!"}
{"text":"Wow! So just a few things before I get to the food-

1) The customer service was great! I made reservations for 13 about a week in advance since my company had a conference out here in LV; and they were able to accommodate it easily. With a large group, and a loud/happy group of people, all our servers were FAST, answered all our questions, and made sure we were well taken-cared of (probably b/c they knew they'd get a great tip). Food came out super-quick and their water / beverage replenishment was on point!

- We were also celebrating one of our co-worker's bdays and they were able to keep the cake in the back and bring it out to surprise her after dinner!

2) The Food: again, WOW. I haven't been to a spanish tapas restaurant in awhile, and this made me just want to go everyday! The food was fantastic. With such a large group, we were able to order a good variety from the menu, and honestly, everything was great!

- Just to name a few favorites: Tuna tartare, ceviche, bacon wrapped dates
- We also had the seafood paella which was very delicious BUT there were parts of it that was way too fishy - which made me worry & wonder if they washed the seafood since I haven't tasted anything so....\"seafoody\" (& I'm not even that picky and eat lots of seafood). BUT again, since the service and EVERYTHING else was so great, I couldn't knock off a point for this but thought it was still important to mention.

3) The Sangria: Saving the best for last - oh. my. SO GREAT. The end.

Overall, awesome experience. Thanks to the employees that waited on us! They were so fast and ensured our drinks/water was always replenished! I will be taking my fiance here when we return to Vegas next month!"}
{"text":"I fell in love with this place...  When driving up, it looked empty and there was only one car in the parking lot.  Then we realized the parking was behind the building...  We walked around still wondering if there were people inside or if we'd be the only ones there for dinner????

We walked in and I'm so happy we did, it was packed.  The vibe was great, the decorations was great, the music was great!

Now let's get to the food.  It is tapas, so it made it great for sharing.  The food was absolutely delish and I will definitely come back again to try more dishes.  If we're weren't so stuffed I could be just kept ordering.  The need empanada and salad we're so, so good.  The ribs just fell off the bone.  The croquettes we're, ok I'm going old school, the bomb dot com!!!  Hahaha. The fries were the beginning of our meal, and my daughter would not let them take the ate until she had the very last fry, so in saying that...  They were pretty darn good!

Off the strip, well actually, right behind the strip, so prices are decent. The reviews are pretty on point.  Give this place a try when you're in Vegas.  You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"now why would anyone go to the strip to have tapas when this place is just off the strip??? 

firefly is a locals' hang out. it was super crowded even at 7pm on  a Monday. who eats out on a Monday? 

you must have some sangria--we ordered the white--along with the sliders, the spicy shrimp, and the basket of fries (this was clearly not a tapas portion). the mac and cheese was also delicious. 

overall, this place is fantastic. truly."}
{"text":"The food = Amazing. 
The Ambiance = dark, cozy and intimate.
Service = Cool, but not very impressionable from what I've experienced.
Drinks = great cocktails and great selection of pitchers of mojitos and sangrias.

Come here for cocktails with friends.  Great place for a date night with the lover.  Celebrate something special here.  Compared to the other location on Paradise this place in bigger, better and convenient since it's in my area.  

Favorites: 
-Chorizo and clams = 5 star
-Stuffed dates wrapped in bacon = 5 stars
-Veggie empanada = 5 stars
-Petite filet = 5 stars
-Shrimp ceviche = 4 stars
-Carmel flan = 4 stars
-Red Sangria = 5 stars

TRY ALL OF THEM! You will fall in love with this place."}
{"text":"This is one of our new favorite restaurants. We went for lunch time and the service was great. I've been dreaming about the food ever since. I'm a vegetarian so my husband and i ordered, the avocado \"toast\", the tomato soup, and the firefly fries. They were all delicious: we also had the chocolate tres leaves which I have to admit wasn't very tasty. We can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I've been to this place several times and have always had a good experience. Most everything is Tapa's style and very reasonably priced. My favorite is the petite Filet that comes with some potatoes & some greens with a very tasty sauce for under $10!! The bacon wrapped dates are Amazing!! They have a happy hour but not for food, just for drinks but you can get a pitcher of flavored Mojito's for $25 and it comes with plenty of drinks for 3 people. Nice outdoor patio and nice dining area. Great good, good prices, nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"I love this Firefly! I always get the Firefly Fries, which are delicious. Tonight I got those, with the Petit Filet and it was boooomb.com! And my dinner partner got the Mushroom Tarte, which he really enjoyed and the sliders which he thoroughly enjoyed. They did much better than usual with their customer service; our drinks were constantly refilled, even after we paid. Very professional. Although, the hostess was a little rushed, and no one was waiting and she didn't hold the door open for us and left us both with one menu. It was about $20 each for us and we got 4 tapas with two drink.
Ps. Their butter on their bread is AWESOME & their butter on their steak..."}
{"text":"Super good Tapas! I love the rack of lamb, wings, cheese plate just to name a few. Quick friendly service with incredible ambiance. Updated lighting and hoppin bar area!"}
{"text":"Great place to have a good small portioned meal with a Lady.   Its fancy but casual.  Very inviting.  :)"}
{"text":"Amazing. The 10$ Filet is Huge! Drinks are great Just a little pricey."}
{"text":"This place is soooo off and on to me.  Is the food amazing??  yes, there is no denying that the food and drink of this resturant is amazing!  However the service always leaves something to be desired EVERY SINGLE TIME I come to the Paradise location.  For instance this past week i met up with some girlfriends to have drinks and tapas and my friend had to ask for her drink three different times and litterally 20 minutes later her diet coke showed up AFTER our sangria and mojitos had been on the table for like ten minutes.  I had to practically beg our waiter to give us any attention and to take our order.  The busser had more interaction with our table than our waiter.."}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place out and it was SOO GOOOOOOD. I forgot my server's name but he was very helpful. The service was great as well. 

Breakdown of what we ordered:

- Bacon Wrapped Dates: Yes, listen to what everyone is saying and GET IT!! 

- Petite Filet: the meat was so tender

- Tierra y Mar: it was good, the salsa verde was amazinnggggg

- Apple Machengo: so refreshing & the cheese was so good 

- Shrimp Ceviche: AMAZING

I definitely recommend coming here. It's inexpensive. I def want to come here again the next time I visit. I want to try the paella! The table next to us got that & it looked amazing."}
{"text":"I've eaten at many fancy places on the strip, but we decided to try a new place based on reviews. This restaurant is very unassuming upon entering; did we make a mistake? The food was AMAZING, the service was great, and the prices were even better. If you are looking for atmosphere, this probably isn't the place for you....but if you are looking for amazing food.....you NEED to try this place."}
{"text":"Average food, portions were large for tapas. The service was okay, but all the servers were pretty cold and unfriendly. I wouldn't come back here."}
{"text":"I've always loved this place because I love sharing and talking about food. Tops: red Santeria: light fruity, yet strong... order a pitcher, you'll need it! Pork empanadas... amazing and tender! My favorite go to is the toasted goat cheese dip and bacon wrapped dates! Savory and rich! Outdoor patio is great and breezy!"}
{"text":"Ive been here twice and I'm positive that this place will always stay awesome. I've tried about 16 different tapas on their menu and they were all delicious. I've also had coffee with flan dessert and a few cocktails and it all tasted amazing. 

I like it that there's always a crowd, but the downside to that is that it can get kinda muggy and hot. It seems that there isn't good air conditioning, but the joint is still great. I'd say this might just be one of the best tapa's restaurant in town and I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Yummy!
This is a place that serves \"tapas\" (read: mini appetizers) and they are tasty, nicely presented, and appropriately priced. They have some fancy flavored martinis and a few main-course dishes as well, all served to you overlooking the colorful lights and fat tourists of Fremont Street. I had a caramel apple martini which gave me a nice buzz and we had bacon-wrapped dates which were AWESOME, a small bowl of thick, creamy tomato-basil soup that is served with a mini grilled brie-cheese sandwich on a sweet-tasting bread, and a big bowl of paella complete with clams, mussels, and shrimp. The atmosphere is a cross between romantic and trendy and this place is definetly affordable."}
{"text":"Ate there for the 2nd time (6/22) and it was simply wonderful. The stuffed dates are delicious. Desserts are out of this world. Never a disappointment."}
{"text":"OMG! Everything was sooooo good.  I highly recommend the baked cod  and steamed mussels."}
{"text":"I am not sure why people swoon over this iteration of Firefly.  It's not bad, but it is not great.  Service was spotty, the food my wife and I ordered was delivered haphazardly and late, and it just was not great.  The garlic fries are always tasty, the bacon wrapped stuffed figs I ordered were burned, and while we wanted this to be our \"go to\" place, it just wasn't good enough to warrant a return visit.  Maybe we just got the wrong food.  I like the Paradise location better, but maybe it was the trip to Madrid and San Sebastian that spoiled me....this just did not deliver the authentic tapas experience I was hoping for....."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this restaurant. Had one of my bachelorette party dinners here a few weeksn ago and I couldn't have been happier. The food, drinks and service were all really amazing!!! Thank you for everything!"}
{"text":"I have been lucky enough to patronize this Firefly twice: once for my birthday dinner and once with my one-time crew of besties.  Both times I have fallen truly madly deeply in love and I HIGHLY recommend this experience to all regular Vegas goers at least once in a lifetime!

Tortilla a la espanola:  3.5 (needs a little more salt, but otherwise just like I remember from Madrid!)
Stuffed dates:  5 (I would give it a 10 if I could...  best form of self-pleasure ever without having to go blind.)
Patatas bravas:  4 (still not Spain-worthy, but definitely tasty.)
Baked tetilla:  4.5 (appetizer perfect for sharing; more like a cheezy dip that's very spicy!  Bad for cholesterol = good for taste buds.)
Manchego mac:  4 (very solid, very cheesy, a must for mac 'n' cheese lovers everywhere!)
Empanadas:  2.5 (not the best ever...  dough was pretty tasty, but then again, it's fried...)
Ham and cheese croquetas:  4 (well done FF!  creamy consistency inside, crunchy outside, worth a try always :)
Chicken and chorizo stuffed mushrooms:  3.5 (well stuffed and yummy if you're into the fungi, but just need a liiiittle salt)
Crispy duck rolls:  4.5 (how could you go wrong with this?  plus the hoisin sauce it comes with is slightly fruity and oh so yummy.)
Merguez:  4 (if you like the oily, smoky consistency of this sausage, you will dig this a lot!)
Fried calamari:  4 (always a crowd pleaser!  not too chewy either ;)
Chorizo clams:  5!!!!!  (SOLID!  the sauce for this was so good that we asked for extra bread to dip in it!)
Camarones a la diabla:  5!!!!!  (the sauce is spicy and sweet, and the shrimp are cooked to perfection.  my fave of the restaurant!)

Aaand then there were the desserts...

Caramel flan:  3.5 (the bestie gave high praises, but I still prefer my mom's flan.)
Chocolate tres leches:  5!!!!!  (absolutely luscious, chocolaty, but still reminiscent of an old-fashioned tres leches cake.)
Passionfruit mini-cheesecakes:  4  (again, a combination you just can't go wrong with -- not too heavy, not too sweet.)
I REALLY wanted to try the bread pudding, but was way too full of food and FABULOUS sangria (the red kind is better than the white) to even go there!

Seriously, just the thought of Firefly makes me so happy :)  I can't wait to go when the Downtown branch re-opens!!!  Thanks so much FF for providing another layer of back-alley awesomeness to the Vegas experience :)))"}
{"text":"I have been, and taken numerous groups of family/friends, to Firefly at least a dozen times throughout my life. Most recently, however, was the crown jewel: my brother, his best friend, his bf's wife, and I, truly enjoying ourselves. Yes I have had better sangria, but FF's version is delicious, refreshing, and compliments the food well nonetheless. I cannot live without their mussels with chorizo, bacon wrapped dates, and camarones a la diabla. Our service has always been outstanding -- a couple of visits were a tiny bit more frustrating than others because we had to flag down servers, but those incidents were few and far between -- and we always leave feeling really satisfied as far as value is concerned.

So what prompted me to write this? Man, haters gonna hate. I suppose that's the beauty of Yelp, and America in general I guess. But seriously? I find it highly ironic that there is a petition circulating to shut down all Firefly branches. ABSURDITY. I'm no math teacher or anything*, but Firefly's aggregate rating goes into the 4 star range, which for hundreds of reviews is pretty impressive. I've delved deeper into this situation and found that many have claimed that Firefly's owners refuse to adhere to any standards of cleanliness or sanitation, and Firefly's owners responded by hiring a consultant specializing in health safety. I don't know who to believe -- the strange minority stepping in because they know so damned much, or the overwhelming majority of people who are pleased with Firefly and believe it to be a true Vegas gem.

I adore you, Firefly, and so does EVERY person I send over. Don't ever go away!

* Note: I actually am a math teacher"}
{"text":"The food was so good that I decided to start writing reviews on Yelp. The garlic shrimp was amazing! The Sangria with sparkling wine was great (I love girly drinks). We also had the filet mignon burger, lamb skewers, fries and another one of the meat skewers among three girls and the food was more than enough. They were all good but definitely recommend the garlic shrimp!"}
{"text":"The view is awesome.  Glass ceiling--a scene from \"get him to the Greek\" and a great spot for a romantic evening.  I had heard good things so when we were trying to decide where to go last saturday, I wanted to check it out.  We split a pitcher of Mojitos.  I ordered the tapas and my man had the paella.  The paella was getting tons of looks and was awesome.  The tapas was pretty great too.  Food was really great price.  I was actually shocked.  Overall you can't beat a nice view, some booz and a great ambiance.  Then a buzzed stroll around downtown followed by a $20 sit-n-go at the Plaza."}
{"text":"I don't write many reviews; reserving my opinion for only the best or worst experiences. Firefly ranks among the best. Highly recommended, and if you don't try the bacon-wrapped dates then either you're a fool or you hate bacon which is essentially the same thing. The flavor explosion is life altering. Pair the pulpo asado with a Rogue hazelnut brown; it's a surprisingly exceptional flavor combination. Cheers!"}
{"text":"We were kinda skeptical about going to this place so soon after the Salmonella scare but we figured we would try it out and give it a go!  MAN were we on the MONEY!!

Fantastic spot to check out hipsters, have a few shots, and a few more tapas, savory and sweet alike, as well as enjoy the beautiful decor and friendly staff.

Started off with Patron shots, then a pitcher of Sangria which was very refreshing then we moved on to tilapia sauteed in butter and wine, dates stuffed with goat cheese and wrapped in bacon, shrimp cocktail, Spanish albondigas, Angus sliders, ohh and so many other delicacies that I want to remember but it's been a month since I was there and my memory is a bit shot from the Patron but I promise, everything was excellent.

This is definitely a MUST GO TO when in Vegas!!!"}
{"text":"Tapas Style restaurant, killer mojitos, good music and a kick-ass happy hour. When my wife and I go to Las Vegas this place is one of our stops. Do yourself a favor and give it a try. Specially during happy hour"}
{"text":"The fid was good.  We had the Albondigas meatballs, baked goat cheese, petite filet, ham and cheese croquetas, chicken skewers, and the chocolate tres Leche cake.  All were pretty good, the skewers were dry and the petite filet was pretty so-so,but everything else was great.  I highly recommend the baked goat cheese.  Service was slow, and my waiter spoke brown English.  The dished were staggered but still really slow and I never got my second drink."}
{"text":"Firefly got rave reviews from friends, family members, and the Yelp universe, so we knew we had to give it a try during our Las Vegas visit. 

We got there right when it opened on a Thursday, and were the first patrons seated. Within fifteen minutes, the place was packed. The waiter recommended the pomegranate martini, so I went with that - my friend ordered the sangria with red wine (you can choose between red, white, or sparkling).

When the fresh bread coated with huge pieces of sweet roasted garlic, honey almond butter and olives on the side arrived, I knew this was going to be a good experience. 

My martini was a little lackluster, so the waiter brought me a side of extra pomegranate juice to add more flavor. My friend's sangria, however, was perfect as presented. 

The meal (Yes, we ate all of this in one sitting, don't judge):

1) Stuffed dates wrapped in bacon with smoked almond, blue cheese, in a red wine reduction - Oh my goodness. These were so good we ordered them twice. The dates were sweet and melted in your mouth, offset by the crunchy bacon and almonds, the sharp blue cheese, and the savory red wine sauce. 

2) Artichoke hearts with basil, garlic aioli, and red pepper - Normally, I steer cleer of red peppers, but these had a sweet, mellow flavor that went perfectly with the artichoke. The artichoke hearts are served cold and are absolutely impossible to eat gracefully, but so good that you don't mind.

3) Manchego mac n' cheese with sundried tomatoes - the waiter recommended this one, and honestly, it was delicious, but not mind blowing. Pretty standard mac n' cheese, but with a delicious baked crust on top. I would definitely eat it again, but not with the same...smack-your-grandma-for-another-serving-gusto that I felt with the dates.

4) Shrimp tempura with ponzu-mandarin orange dipping sauce - crispy, golden, tempura perfection with a superb sweet-salty-tangy dipping sauce. 

5) Ahi tuna skewers with mango, basil, and a mustard ginger glaze - This was the only disappointment of the day. The presentation was amazing...and the separate sauces were delicious, but the mango was very underripe, and the tuna was wayyyy overcooked. We probably should have said something, but we had a lot more eating to do, and we didn't want to make the chef mad.

6) Lobster \"escargots\" - this dish was adorable. Little knobs of lobster tail were served on a silver dish swimming in garlic herb butter. There is very little lobster on the plate, but the pieces you get are tender and flavored beautifully with the butter.

*Yes...we are STILL eating...*

7) Roasted eggplant canneloni with goat cheese and tomato sauce - This dish was super simple and super delicious. The goat cheese lent a tangy, creamy component to the dish, and the sauce was simple, fresh and delicious.

8) Crispy duck roll with cherry hoisin sauce - Maybe it was because we were getting a little full, but I thought this dish was delicious, but way too big. The duck roll comes wrapped in a wonton about twice the size of your standard egg roll, and stuffed with duck meat. The meat is a little on the dry side, and the lack of anything else in the roll makes it a little difficult to eat. I would have liked it a lot more with some fresh veggies inside, or at about half the size. It was a LOT of meat.

*Are you impressed with our appetites yet?*

9) Camarones a la diabla - shrimp in a spicy chile sauce - shrimp was cooked well...the sauce is definitely on the milder side. Nice kick, but no afterburn. 

*Dessert time! Obviously, we ordered two...*

10) Lemon-berry tarts - These were delicious. Lemon curd was served in crisp cookie shells with a raspberry drizzle, fresh blueberries and a mound of whipped cream. 

11) Sorbet of the day - Pineapple, Mango, and Cantelope sorbets topped with fresh berries, and Grand Marnier. The perfect light way to end this amazing meal. 

- Other memorable moments from the meal: An older lady came over specifically to tell us that we \"Really did it right\" - and my grandmother called...completely convinved that I said I was at a topless restaurant...not a tapas restaurant. Good times."}
{"text":"I came here for a Bachelorette party that was party of a VIP package - so we got treated to all you can eat and drink... I have to think the alcohol is definitely factoring in to what a great experience I had, but honestly the food was great and our servers (we had two) were AMAZING!! I would go back just for the service alone as they were attentive and went above and beyond to keep our party of 9 happy.  

Food - like I said it was all you could eat tapas and desserts for us, and a table of 9 girls, yep we pretty much had it all.... and managed to hand the plates around as if they were big enough to be family style.   I loved the bacon wrapped dates, the octopus, the apple salad, the tuna tartare, the empanadas, and the dessert platter.
You can probably skip the mussels, the chick peas in shells (these were actually good, but not worth the mess or effort to eat), the shrimp diabla, and the steak skewers....  trust me we ate many more than this, but these stick out as the best and the worst.

Drinks - the mojitos were ok, not as flavorful as I would have liked, but it was all you could drink and really I wasn't complaining. The sangria was strong, maybe too strong, and then others in our group ordered wine and beer.  

Service - again, sooooo good!! Our waitress took the time to get the bachelorette a candle and sing a made up bachelorette song to her as though it was her birthday... she didn't think the bachelorette looked happy enough so she kept going above and beyond with little details to make our night that much better.  

Atmosphere - loud, like really loud, and I'm sure our table wasn't helping... definitely not a romantic tapas spot I'd want to go to with the bf, but perfect for our kind of evening."}
{"text":"They have a very extensive tapas menu and the service was great. Omg surprisingly their red sangria was delicious especially on a hot day. If you want the paella , order it early. We had the seafood and it was good, lots of seafood. The dates bacon wrap was a tad bit salty. The potatoes with chorizo was super salty, you truly need a bowl of rice to scarf that down. The shrimp glazed with sweet and sour sauce was typical , nothing interesting. Felt like I can buy a sweet and sour sauce bottle at the Asian store and just stir fry it with the shrimp. 

I truly enjoyed the scallop escargot , pesto and bitter were so yummy!!! Must order !! I also enjoyed the apple salad with manchego cheese and smokes almond, very light and refreshing!"}
{"text":"Remember your first crush? The one you had as a kid and you fondly look back on it with nothing but good memories? Well Firefly is that to me. This is the place that introduced me to the world of tapas. Years have passed since my first trip here and I have consumed and experienced my fair share of tapas around the world. Some better and some worse than Firefly, but there will always be a little love for the place that started it all. I try to visit once every time I am in Vegas but with the popularity of tapas and small plate restaurants in general growing, there are now incredible tapas restaurants all over the country and the absolute high regard I had for the food here isnt there anymore. 
Unfortunately this location was recently shut down due to a Salmonella outbreak. We actually dined there in early March and luckily didnt get sick. I hope they get their stuff together and open up again since this was one of the most popular restaurants in town."}
{"text":"I haven't been to this restaurant in years so this time I went to a wedding reception. The new building is nice as well. The reception was set up outside on the patio area and was well decorated. The staff were nice and even though I'm not big on tapas food it was served as different samples and some things were very tasty. I was pleasantly surprised this time around. 

The one thing that stood out is the parking is in the back of the building and there are signs to lock your cars and hide belongings. Maybe there have been car break ins??? Not sure but it was a concern for me."}
{"text":"Could be a 3.5, but I'll get to that in a bit.

Firefly is a nice place off the strip with a nice menu. We've done Jaleo in our hometown (it's a go to) so we venture away from the Vegas locations to try Firefly. The white sangria stood out as the best thing we ordered. With four of us we order 10 plates and they were all good - nothing to really complain about - but nothing that stood out. Nice staff. The mark down is for the roaming photographer who's running some sort of \"you're on the rollercoaster at DisneyWorld and want to buy pictures.\" She took a few and then came back to pass along a 'free' photo and offerings to sell. I don't need someone selling me photos at dinner - it's cheap and...cheap. And, vaguely unprofessional for a restaurant. If the manager reads this, knock it off. It's awful. Ran about $125 for ten plates, a pitcher of sangria, and two coffees."}
{"text":"My family lives in Summerlin and I visit every few months from NYC. I always go to Firefly when I am here because it reminds me of the city. I recently created a yelp account and decided to see how Firefly was doing. 

I recently visited with some of my girlfriends and ordered around 10 tapas. I am writing this because I noticed Mandalines name was on here. Unless this is a different Mandaline, which I doubt, then I felt like I should comment. I always ask for Mandi (black hair/tattoos) and she has been my server a handful of times. 

In Manhattan, the quality of service has to be top-notch, so when I am out here, I also look for that quality of service. I have had other servers there, but I always remember Mandi. 

I hope this helps, I'll continue to be a patron of Firefly, as well as ask for Mandi when I am in town. 

p.s food is outstanding, the new lobster escargot is delicious. Good Work."}
{"text":"Eating at Firefly was one of the highlights of my Vegas trip! We went on a Wednesday night around 8pm without a reservation and were seated at the bar while we waited. In general I'm a huge fan of food that's easy to share, so I was predisposed to love the restaurant. Ambient lighting that wasn't so dim you couldn't see the other members of your party, and the noise level was decent.

My friend and I had:
- stuffed dates: as many have mentioned, these bacon-wrapped things are beyond delicious! I'm iffy on dates and love bacon, and found the dish to be just the right amount of sweet
- firefly fries: we were hungry and wanted something more filling. These fries seem like a much classier (and possibly marginally healthier) version of your standard cheese fries. They tasted great, but I might have ordered something different if I was less desperately hungry while ordering. 
- mushroom tart: pastry was fluffy and crisp, mushrooms and sauce were well-made. Felt more like a breakfast food than a dinner dish, but I didn't mind.
- chorizo clams: unexpected combination, but delicious! My friend's favorite dish of the night. I think it came with around a dozen clams and a heaping pile of sausage-y sauce.

I wish we had come with more people so we could have tried more dishes!"}
{"text":"Never disappoints!!! This place never seizes to amaze me! The food, the service and not to mention the staff!
I've taken numerous groups and friends to this location and it's always such a treat to see how much everyone enjoys it. I've never had a dish I wasn't impressed with. Thank you Firefly for making it so easy for me to share this little gem."}
{"text":"Food was good. Bread and almond butter was delicious! Had tuna tartare and ceviche that was full flavor and close to perfect. Server assistants and Bussers were on top of it but our server was not attentive at all. Will be back for the bar and food!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this 6 stars. Everything was incredible. The complimentary bread and butter was enough to swoon over. Then my waiter alejando  was so attentive and made sure my mojí tos never ran out. Mac and cheese was great, veggie empanada was better, skewers were delicious. Watermelon is better than mango. Amazing dinner!"}
{"text":"Only 10 miles from the strip, but a 25 minute drive because of all the lights.

This location is less busy, way newer, way cleaner, and way spacier than the Paradise location.

Food portions are small and pricey, but very flavorful."}
{"text":"Finally a place I can order several plates and not be judged..... 

I like tapas restaurants because you get a little bit of everything and you don't need to order five huge meals to get it. The idea of tapas is to get people at your table to share so you get to experience several dishes and that's exactly what we did.

They started us off with their sweet almond butter and bread. This was complimentary and the only problem was I couldn't stop eating it. The sweet almond butter was addicting! I think I filled up on bread. 

We also ordered off the tapas menus:

-The Apple and Manchego salad: Green apple, Manchego cheese, smoked almonds, and light dressing. The salad was light and refreshing if you want a healthier choice. It was good but nothing memorable.

-Veggie Empanadas: Spinach, mushroom, artichoke, herbed cream cheese in a pastry with red pepper aioli. They were served hot and crispy. 

-Firefly Fries: Parmesan, herbs, and aioli.  I'm not a fry person but I do prefer thin fries when I eat them. These actually were my least favorite. 

-Baked goat cheese: Goat and garlic cream cheese, tomato sauce, pesto, and toast. This was the groups favorite dish. I thought it was great for cheese lovers! So cheesy and delicious! 

-Mushroom Tart: puffed pastry, herbed cream cheese and mushroom sauce. This was my favorite. It was rich but also had enough carbs to make me happy! 

I also tried The New Girl drink which was house infused Vodka, cranberry, hint of Jalapeño and mint. Delicious! I loved it! 

All these tapas dishes were pretty big. They probably run on the bigger side of most tapa plates.

My friends ordered two main dishes:

 -Firefly burger with truffle fries 
 -Clams 

Neither of these interested me but everyone seemed to love their food, they all were very happy. It was very busy on this Friday night so it's probably a good idea to make reservations. We came in with no reservation and waited about 30 minutes.

This place was very busy and the atmosphere was fun. There were lots of people at the bar, loud music, and I even saw people dancing. No frowning allowed in here!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to go in Vegas, I always go back.  Fantastic Sangria, fantastic eats, friendly waitstaff, great atmosphere.  In our small group, we ordered an array of delicious delights, loving the mushroom tarts, the stuffed dates, and really pretty much everything we tried.  Usually there is one dish at a Tapas place that you don't like.  Not here.    Travel over off the strip, and go here.  It's been consistently wonderful for the last 5 years I've gone."}
{"text":"Andy is awesome and friendly and makes awesome drinks. I came here on my birthday after a terrible lunch experience (elsewhere) and he brightened up my day!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants here in Vegas!! I always bring my guests here for their sangria and yummy tapas."}
{"text":"A friend who lives in the area suggested we go here one night while we were in town for my bachelorette party. It's just off the strip but the cab ride is WELL worth it!

We had a reservation and our party of 6 was seated right away. The restaurant was packed the whole time we were there. We started off with a pitcher of sparkling sangria and a pitcher of mojitos. I only had the sangria but it was very light, refreshing and had plenty of fresh fruit in it. 

A rundown of what we ordered. All the plates were enough of us to each have a bite or two.
-Smoked salmon toasts: tasty, but the dill sour cream was more sour cream, very little if any dill flavor. We ordered a 2nd round of these however
-Bacon wrapped stuffed dates: a recommendation from Jesus and SO GOOD. Warm, nutty flavored and saltiness from the bacon. We ordered a 2nd round of these and would have probably ordered more if we weren't so full. One of the best things I had all night
-Fries: fine, but nothing to write home about. Just french fries. Save the sauce from the spicy shrimp and dip these in it. YUM.
-Mac n cheese: another recommendation from Jesus. Cheesy, creamy, rich and delicious.
-Camarones a la diabla: sauteed shrimp in a spicy sauce. Great spice, plump shrimp and the sauce was to die for. We ordered a 2nd round of these as well and kept both plates of the sauce so we could dip our fries and bread in it
-Albondigas: meatballs in a tomato sauce. A little bit of spice and very tasty. 
-Empanadas: filled with pork and beef I think. These were not my favorite. Just kind of blah.
-Ham and Cheese Croquetas: lightly fried, crispy little bites. 
-Crispy duck roll: I'm not a duck fan so I only had a small bite of this. It's covered in a sour cherry sauce which I did not enjoy. Too sour and too cherry for my liking. And it was kind of soggy. 

We ended up ordering another pitcher of sangria through dinner also. Best part of dinner is when the ticket came (which already included gratuity), it was only  $210. Each of us got out of there with a full belly, a buzz and it didn't drain our wallets! A gem right off the strip."}
{"text":"On a random Tuesday evening I found the following at Firefly:

Attentive & pleasant servers.
Good food.
Lively (yet not whooped-up) atmosphere.
Most excellent Happy Hour prices. 
Its located off-strip; a mix of locals and visitors.
The soundtrack was Thievery Corp.
It started to get slammed around 7:00p.m.

Five stars for realz cause its pretty close to a \"normal\" urban experience as I've had since relocating to Vegas from Seattle last Oct."}
{"text":"This place is clearly one of the best places I have been. ITs god very unusual combinations of food and excellent staff"}
{"text":"Another Vegas favorite! Service, food, drinks, atmosphere, all fantastic! They gave a huge variety of tapas, pick a bunch and share! Also if you use the Open Table app, reservations are worth 100 points!   The champagne sangria is delicious!  Get a pitcher!"}
{"text":"Tapas is my favorite way to eat food, and I haven't had it in so long, so I was very excited to come here. 

I came here with my sorority since we were spending the weekend in LV for a convention, and the staff was very nice about finding enough tables/chairs for us. Among the many dishes my favorites were the paella and the herb-roasted chicken. The ribeye, however, was The One. I didn't get to eat the desserts since I had to leave early, but overall I had a wonderful time. Loved the vibe.

Oh, and had to love the fact that the staff found a town car to take us around the Strip when we asked for help flagging down a taxi. So friendly!"}
{"text":"I love firefly. Everything is so tasty. I love the dark and red ambiance. It's such a great date night spot. Or group dinner with friends. Late night happy hour. It never disappoints."}
{"text":"Amazing Sangria. Try the bacon wrapped dates. They are the best."}
{"text":"Best tapas in Las Vegas. Too bad they dont have this restaurant in OC! Scallop escargot, tuna tartare and bacon wrap dates are my fav.  The New Girl drink was sooooo good and refreshing!"}
{"text":"Tapas - glorious tapas.
We went on our last trip to Julian Serrano...

and we must say - Firefly is world class; Julian Serrano's is run by chefs hoping to become Denny's salad cooks.

And the price is half the cost of going to Julian's (note: We pigged out so you could actually save a lot more if you were not as piggy as us.).  
The decor is stellar - rich hues; red lights; beautiful.  While Julian Serrano is right off the casino floor - none of the richness of some of the restaurants you so want in las Vegas.  Firefly delivers.

So if you want tapas and wonderful sangria wine to go with it, do not stop but head immediately to Fireflys.

Our party was a party of 3 and of course we started with their wonderful dates - just right.  Fantastic.  We continued with their lentil and vegetables (and so good). We continued with their meatballs, steak and mushroom skewers, ahi stuffed pepppers, and empanadas. All pure food magic - great taste; and so much more.  We had a very good banana desert.

The person we brought was not sure when we wanted to go to Firefly's.   He had read some down reviews about the place and said - what the heck - at least we get to talk.  And we did in our nice booth in the back.    However, his comment at the end was - This was truly the best; it is a memorable meal; it is fantastic.  And the reviews I read - they must not have eaten here.  

Locals love this place as well as visitors.   Its closer to Red Rock Casino than the strip but if you have a car its worth the short drive.  All in all - a big thank you to the cooks, the wait staff; and everyone at this fantastic restaurant."}
{"text":"My favorite go to place for tapas when in Las Vegas.......
Bacon wrapped dates (as many mention) are the best...
So many great tapas - 
We love to get some drinks; enjoy looking at the menu; and then deciding on what great tapas to have this go around....
Too bad the place is so far from home for me - but when in the area its our go to place for tapas....Firefly is the best! 
And I like the sangria -  just writing this makes me happy!
Next trip already planned - Firefly I'll see you soon!"}
{"text":"Whenever I have visitors from out of town, this is one of my favorite places to take them. They have a variety of food for the meaty eater to the veggie eater and I have not yet received a complaint about the food. My personal favorites are the tuna tartare, the manchego mac and cheese and filet mignon sliders. This time I also ordered the steamed mussels, Terra y Mare skewers and the mushroom tart and all three items did not let me down at all. It may seem a lil pricey, but its definitely worth the money. 
P.S. I love their mojitos!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars for the food
2.5 stars for the service

I've never been to the Plaza before....it's like walking into a time machine. The Paradise location does not take reservations on Friday or Saturday and since someone recommended going to this one, we decided why not? The valet was very slow so by the time we arrived, we were later than late since the 15 had an accident. However, my friends that were on time said that had to wait 20 minutes for the server to even come and take their drink order. Please note that when I arrived, the place was not very busy at all. On a plus side, We had an awesome view of the Fremont Street from our table. 

After I looked at the menu, I decided to order the tuna tartare, manchego mac and cheese, petite filet, steamed mussels, lamb chops and a pitcher of the Mango Mojito.  It took another 15-20 minutes for my mojito to come out and that was after my bf waved down someone asking for the update of our drinks. Luckily the food started arriving fairly quickly after I had some mojito in me. The tuna tartare was such a dissappointment. The taro chips were so stale that the dish was a big fat FAIL.  They did redeem themselves with their mussels. The petite filet was oh so tender and juicy that I wanted more, but I was pretty much full with some yummy mac and cheese in me.  I did get to try the smoked salmon toast that my friend had order. It was pretty good, but salty...so if you don't like salty don't go for this dish. I didn't try the lamb chops since I was really full, but the bf enjoyed it. On the plus side, since we had to ask what the status was on our drinks, we got another pitcher for free!  Overall, I thought it was ok and the view was nice, but I probably won't be returning here unless someone else has a dinner here."}
{"text":"Perhaps i ordered poorly... or perhaps I wasn't drinking while eating. Probably the latter... yep definitely the latter.

Best thing I had was the bacon wrapped dates. Also it was enjoyable watching the two couples at the table in front of going to the bathroom every ten seconds... ya know... for stuff.

The rest of the food here was adequate and not worth the price. And as many reviews say... it is extremely loud! Once again due to all the alcohol consumption. It is also very dark... great place to take an ugly date.

The service is great, and I don't really know what else to say about it. Great ambiance minus all the noise. Our reservation was for ten but they let us in at 930 because there was no one in line. A lot of people have said to get a reservation which I suggest... BUT if you want to go earlier you might be able to sneak in... to the bathroom and do blow.

THE VERDICT: Go?! I can only suggest this place who have money to burn. Which i do i burn 1 dollar bills for heat. There is such a VAST variety in vegas (how bout that alliteration?) that if you are there for a weekend you should definitely go to other places, because there are a lot of delish places. oh and to the prostitutes at the table in front of us... make the powder breaks a little less noticeable."}
{"text":"This was one of my favorite places in Vegas and it's still turning out quality tapas and drinks. Whenever anyone asks me for suggestions on places to go eat on the Strip, I always recommend Firefly's since it's pretty good prices for really good food. 

My favorites are the bacon-wrapped dates, Tuna Tartare (comes with chunks of mango and avocado which sets it apart from other tartares), Warm Spinach Salad, Paella (very moist and flavorful), and Camarones a la Diabla (Grilled Shrimp in a spicy chili sauce, great to dip your bread in!). 

The sangrias are marinated for 3 days before served. This is one of the few places where I've seen sangria made with white wine and sparkling wine. I love the white wine sangria. The mojitos are fabulous as well. I love the mango mojitos. You can just taste the fresh mango in it."}
{"text":"This place is excellent! Quite a mini hidden gem for me. Is off the strip on Paradise Blvd, but only a few minutes drive from the strip. Firefly is known for their tapas and their sangria is DELICIOUS! 

I ordered the \"Ahi Tuna Skewer\"- The seared Ahi Tuna was cooked perfectly, and the presentation was nice. There's two skewers and there's pineapple bits in-between every ahi tuna cube. The pineapple and tuna goes pretty well together.

The sangria was AMAZING! I had two glass. So good. It was not too strong yet not too light. However, my girlfriend got tipsy drinking it. Funny. It's really good though. Definitely recommend others to get it.

The ambiance was nice. Dimmed lights inside. Service was great."}
{"text":"I love going here with my friends, and my sister. Cannot wait to bring my boyfriend on our next date. This place offers the best happy hour deals for the best mojitos and sangrias in the world. They are strong enough and delicious at the same time. The service could be a hit or miss sometimes, but mostly good. They refill your drinks before you need them and have really good foods as well. I personally love their bread and almond butter. Their bacon wrapped dates are a bit sweet but definitely a must try on the menu. Although the paellas take awhile, they are definitely worth every minute of wait as well. I wish they opened another location near my house so I could go more often!!"}
{"text":"This is now one of our favorite restaurants in town. We love the stuffed dates and beet salad. The food is perfect for sharing and the pitcher of sangria too! :) Firefly is a must do while in Vegas."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now & loved it both times! The sangrias (both red & white) are smooth and delicious. Just get the pitcher. I've only had the tapas, but they're fantastic. Some favorites: the patatas bravas, the apple & manchego salad, the macaroni & cheese, the petite filet, the spicy beef salad, and the empanadas. Service can be a little slow depending on the waiter & the crowd, but the food is worth it. An easy uber drive and especially great for mid-large size groups."}
{"text":"I love this place.   The ambiance is great.  The Apple and Manchego salad is my favorite.  They have delicious Mojitos and Sangria and tons of other cocktails."}
{"text":"My husband and I go to Firefly at least twice a week and this place is always hoppin!  We usually sit at the bar to eat instead of waiting for a table and there is a steady stream of great people watching.  I love the tapas style menu because we can order several plates and just share.  The bread and butter spread they bring is super yummy.

A few of my personal favorites from the menu:
bacon wrapped dates!!!
tomato soup and grill cheese
pupusa (octopus) this is divine
sliders
roasted peppers
empenadas
goat cheese and beet salad
fries

They also serve a very tasty infused fruit vodka and the service is always friendly and fast.

Awesome low prices, especially for the quality and hoppin atmosphere.  I would especially recommend this to tourists, however I'd like to keep it as a secret gem for us locals!"}
{"text":"Thank you fellow Yelpers, you did good!

Loved everything about this place. Great food, excellent prices and a happening ambiance. Five of us ate so many tapas, some favorites were the Mac n Cheese (2 orders) Filet, Mushroom Tart, Tuna Tartar, Sausages, Tortilla (egg, potato, onion) 5 different desserts and drinks for a really great price. 

SHOCKING, especially since my husband kept trying to talk me into another high end tapas restaurant. I will definitely be back. 

I recommended this place to a friend the next night (both of us were in town for a trade show) and he loved it as well."}
{"text":"Located in a strip mall.. We visited the Firefly for my sister's Bachelorette dinner before hittin the town.. good thing we had reservations because this place was packed.   Good SIGN!

Their specialty here is tapas/small plates so we ordered a bunch of different items recommended by the waitress and just shared everything.  They have so many different items to please any palette.  They also serve nice yummy mojitos by the pitcher. Needless to say that was a hit with the entire group!  

Items ordered:  Ceviche Shrimp, Bacon Wrapped Dates, Empanadas, Tuna Tartar, Mac & Cheese, Chicken & Chorizo Mushrooms and a few other items.  Everything was pretty tasty especially my favorite mac & cheese.  We had to get double of that!

Everyone was pleased with the meal and got their fill... ready for a night on the town!"}
{"text":"Service 1/2 a star+ food 5 stars= 3 stars

The reason I even gave this 3 stars was for the incredible amazing food. 
The service was horrible.
 I understand its Vegas and when servers are charging gratuity for big parties at some point they dont care because they probably won't see us again. Its sad but true. I will recommend this place to friends when they want amazing food but will always warn about the service.

Salsa, Merengue, cumbia, Bachata dance floor outside."}
{"text":"Wow!  How have I not heard of this place before.  I the bacon wrapped dates, among other things.  It was amazing.  The staff is really friendly and attentive too.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Yes, you are reading this rating right 4STARS for Firefly.  At the end of this review I will explain why I did not rate 5STARS

With all the negative publicity that this restaurant has received it's time to put them back in the good light.  

I was recently here for a team meeting, and I have to say that I was very impressed. This new location is AWESOME, valet parking in the front and ample parking in the back.  Hostess booth as you walk-in just like the old location but the update in the new location is now there is a WAITING AREA.  Helloooooooo, no longer do I have to wait outside, in addition to the waiting area the new bar area is big enough to sit and have a drink and not be elbowed by other patrons.  

RESTROOMS - clean, clean, clean! and more than 2 stalls (sorry just keeping it REAL)

DINING ROOM - OMG, amazing you can actually walk through the restaurant w/o saying the following: 
- \"oh, I'm sorry\"

- \"excuse me, can you scoot your chair in please\"

- \"it's hot in here, is the AC on\" , etc

Big parties can be seated and accommodated comfortable.  Firefly now has a extra room for private parties, that sits off tot he side of the dining area.

BAR - The bar is SUPER, more than 5ppl can sit at the bar now.  If you and friends want to chill at the bar and sit together, you can.  Open bar area, it sits kind of in the middle of the restaurant.

PATIO - couches outside, more of a lounge area now.



FOOD - 

- STUFFED DATES: yummy! yes indeed, dates stuffed w/ blue cheese wrapped in crispy bacon. (I don't even liked blue cheese, but i KILLED those stuffed dates)

- MANCHEGO MAC&CHEESE: when you can see the grease of the cheese along the rim of the dish, know that you're in for a culinary delight.  bubbly cheesy goodness, mac&cheese comes out w/ that crunchy cheese top. you know how you throw food in the oven set on broiler to make it extra crunchy...YEP, and that's what come to you table. mmm, mmm, good

- ALBONDIGAS: juicy moist meatballs w/ melted parmesan cheese sitting in a bath of tasty tomato sauce.  NO really, the sauce is on point, I wanted to take the bowl and slurp but I didn't want to look like a fat a$$.

- VEGGIE EMPANADAS: crispy flaky dough, you hear that slight CRUNCH when you bite into the empanada.  the veggies are not all mushy or hard for that fact.  its a nice balance, it comes drizzled with some kind of sauce that matched very well

- STEAK&MUSHROOMS SKEWERS: um YEA! medium rare, i don't what type of steak but it was tasty.  it reminded me of filet mignon, it was so tender, when I pinched the steak to pull of the skewer it just slide right off.  If you are a mushroom person, then this dish will make you very happy.  They do not skimp of size or flavor

- BEEF SLIDERS: DELICIOUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! no extras needed, don't ask for for any ranch, no ketchup, no mustard, no NOTHING. EAT AS IS, beef is seasoned perfectly, cooked medium rare, you take a bite and your teeth just sink into the beef.  OH MY GOSH, i'm getting hot over here..oh i forgot I'm still writing a review

GO TO FIREFLY'S you will not get SICK, I PROMISE.  They have cleaned house in there, I did not see any of the OLD employees there.  I was a regular at the old paradise location, I was familiar w/ all the workers at the old location.  The NEW paradise location is NEW all the way around.  The food is still GREAT 

NOW, the reason why I did rate 5STARS is because of this one problem:
With a new spacious restaurant and bigger restrooms there is still NO TOILET PAPER in the bathroom.  If you're a girl, go to the bathroom with a friend just in case you walk into the stall and it is out of paper.  \"hey girl, can you hand me some rough ass paper towels please\"  I'm just saying.....

Check out the NEW FIREFLYS on Paradise, it's good.  A good place for anything"}
{"text":"I was there for 3 days for some concerts and we stumbled on this place using yelp.  We got there around 1am and we waited in the bar area for about 10 minutes then we were promply seated.  Tapas were amazing Top picks

Atmosphere is dark candel lit with a casuall hang out and drink place.

1. sliders were seasoned and cooked perfectly.
2.Both shrimp dishes were specatular
3.Even the bread they give you at the start is awesome. 
4. chicken cheese chorizo mushrooms were amazing as well.

Get off the strip and come here for dinner or just to grab a drink.  You wont be dissapointed."}
{"text":"Been here multiple times, and everytime the service is great, the food is fantastic and the sangria is light, not too sweet, thirst quenching and will get you buzzed. Never. Fails.
I've tried multiple items with everything always being so tasty, however I do remember last year when I came I tried the veggie paella and it was not delicious. But again, paella is supposed to have seafood and meat, so that was a lack of judgment on my vegetarian friend who ordered it. So I forgive Firefly for that one and blame my friend. Ok back to last week. I ordered the clams, and it was so tasty my mouth is watering just thinking of it. Steamed to perfection and soaked in a broth with chorizo. Simply amazing. Roasted veggies were also amazing, as well as the pasta bowls. Our table ordered 3 of them and everyone who tasted it was in awe. However, it's alot of pasta; I don't think we even finished 1/2 of each one of the orders. All in all, you can't order wrong here ( Unless you get the veggie paella) and the sangria is one of the best I've ever tasted. This place is always on top of my list to visit when in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good, but it wasn't *that* great of a deal... and the place is really, really LOUD and full of annoying local Vegas singles on the prowl.  I guess this is where you go if you're even marginally \"artsy\" or \"cosmopolitan\" (by Vegas standards, that is) and want to pick up on other similar types.  Whatever!  I just wanted some bad ass tapas in a chill atmo, and this was NOT it.  I much preferred Cafe Deia out  in the 'burbs."}
{"text":"If you want to experience old Vegas and the grit of downtown, but from a safe distance... come to Firefly!  This restaurant floats in a secure glass bubble, overlooking the Fremont Street shenanigans. It's almost like being at the zoo, with a comforting wall of glass between you and all the strippers, hookers and downscale hoi polloi with their plastic footballs full of frozen daiquiri.  If that's your bag, then you're a pussy -- but you will like this restaurant.

I was prepared to dislike the place because I was such a HUGE fan of the swanky old-time steakhouse that used to occupy the space.  As always, they had to rip out something cool to make way for something trendy and overpriced.  But it actually turned out to be really cool!  As mentioned it's a great view, good food at reasonable prices, and a MUCH better atmo than the other Firefly (on Paradise), which is loud and thick with poseurs. The atmo here is more laid back -- dim lighting and stylish comfy furniture, with lots of windows looking down at the circus maximus.  Bonus tip: if they don't have any tables looking out toward Fremont (as they claimed when I went there, and tried to seat me at a table looking at a wall), just go sit in the lounge area.  Great view and less hassle, with all the same service!

Food-wise it is fancy schmancy tapas.  Everything I ordered was rich and full interesting flavors and ingredients, and the prices were good, so no complaints on that front.  The French bread they serve was greasy, though, like it had been basted or even soaked in Canola oil before being toasted.

All in all, this is a fantastic place for you suburban walled-fortress-dwellers to experience downtown without WALLOWING in downtown.   Only caveat: the valet parking is located right next to the downtown Greyhound Bus station.  So you're gonna see some real grit and grime anyway, puss!"}
{"text":"For what it is, Firefly works. The concept is great, and the quality of their product was high.

HOWEVER, If I am hungry, I will probably pass on heading Fireflys way. I absolutely loved the dishes I had. The potatoes were awesome, and the grilled shrimp hit the spot. But ladies and gentlemen, I am 6' 220 lbs. I could easily spend $100 on my own mixing and matching these tiny plates. The service was alright, although my friends who come here often tell me it is sometimes shakey. 

I will definately be back for some drinks, but never on an empty stomach!!"}
{"text":"Meh. Not memorable or remarkable. Missed its mark on the service. I felt that our server didn't even want to wait on us. All of our food we ordered came out at the exact same time except for one hot dish. Will not be coming back or recommending anyone to go here. Save your money and go elsewhere. Very cold welcoming and basically set the tone for the entire evening where I just wanted to pack my mediocre tapas and just leave even though I wasn't full or satisfied."}
{"text":"Took my grandma here for her birthday the food was so good and the service was great doesn't take long for entrees to come out and big enough to share thank you for the awesome time"}
{"text":"I am a fan of all things Sangria, and Firefly has to have some of the best around.  I love places with a great happy hour, atmosphere, and patio.  Firefly has all  three plus great tapas.  The service is always fantastic they are very attentive and friendly.  I can't think of a better place to start off a weekend in Vegas with your friends than this place.

The must haves for me when I go is of course the Sangria (red) and the stuffed mushrooms with chorizo and chicken.  The Calamari is quite good, and on my most recent visit the Shrimp a la Diabla was fantastic.  I look forward to my next visit to Firefly which will be very soon."}
{"text":"If you are looking for great food, drinks and music, this place is it ! 
The service is exceptional and the food even better.
Gabriel is the best., attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"we come frequently to this place, excellent food, environment and the service/atention of Irina is the best. She always is ready for help us and give us an excellent service

Irina you are vey kind and sweet.. mulumesc!"}
{"text":"I heart tapas and Firefly does it perfectly. Low key but trendy atmosphere, good quality food and interesting dishes, and of course sangria!! All at the cheapest prices I've seen in a while. I think it's the perfect place for a night out with friends, wohout the touristy bustle of the strip.

Here's what I ordered, and I honestly recommend all of it, but like others have said, especially the stuffed dates.  It's a combination on sweet and savory unlike any other!

-stuffed date ($4) their must-try
-roasted eggplant canneloni ($5) basic, but good
-filet mignon sliders ($7.5) - well marinated beef and yummy onion strings!
-tres leche cake ($5)...so moist..drool."}
{"text":"304. I rarely go off the strip for food, but my friend raved about this place so we met up here. This was his first stop after driving directly from California. #Commitment.

All of the tapas that we got were tasty, but the real highlight was the stuffed dates. I don't like dates, but they were decorated with so many other things that it didn't even matter anymore. The dates were wrapped with bacon and topped with blue cheese with a sprinkling of some red wine and smoked almond somewhere in there. It was an explosion with every bite.

We also ordered a pitcher of sangria because it's a tapas bar, who doesn't? I didn't take it too well though. Ended up with a bad headache. It was probably too sugary for my brain.

Sounds like this place can get packed on the weekend, but we went during off-peak hours and it was pretty empty. Parking wasn't an issue either with plenty of space behind the restaurant. Definitely would come back for the tapas, but I'd probably go elsewhere for drinks."}
{"text":"This place has a serious obsession with mint. 

I came here with a large group to celebrate a friend's birthday. Many people in the group ordered mojitos. I was not on that list but just from observation,  I was blown away at the amount of mint that was in these drinks. From what I understand, all you need is a little bit of mint to be muddled to release the mint flavor. My dining companions could not even finish their drinks at times because there was so much mint gumming up their straws. It was practically coming up the sides of the glass and people were pulling out leaves and putting it on their plates. So please, Firefly, pull back the heavy hand for mint in your mojitos. 

Here are some of the dishes I tried and my thoughts:

Bacon wrapped dates-Were really good but super rich. 
Empanada-Meh. Nothing that impressive about it. I can see why they drizzled it with a ton of aioli--they were trying to give it some extra flavor. I believe that a condiment should be served on the side and compliment a dish, rather than make it the only way it has any dimension. I say this because I scraped the aioli off and it was just bland and then soggy in the parts were the aioli sat on the crispy empanada shell. 
Tierra y mar skewers-grilled shrimp is the first thing on the description and there were only 2 shrimps to be found on the entire thing). The filet mignon chunks were quite heavenly. 
Caramel flan-a standard flan that was served with an almond \"cookie\" which looked like a cannoli shell. When I scooped up the fruit compote garnish with the cookie and ate it with the flan...I enjoyed that combo together. And of course there were a few mint leaves as a garnish!

I was a tad bummed because although they have Delirium Tremens beer on the menu, it was not on tap when I got there. The waitress did express some concern that it was on the online menu (which is were I had seen it). BUt I was still happy with the beers I ordered in its place. I don't care that they are known for Sangria. I had Sangria the day before at a baby shower. I was over having just some fruity wine. So beer was poison of choice that night. 

Service from our main waitress was really good. She was very fast and informative and kept all of the separate checks straight and there was not a large group gratuity charge! 

The other servers really missed the mark with getting waters refilled or handing out food. When  some plates came out, they would go to the edge of our table and say \"tomato soup? who ordered the tomato soup?\" and this happened every single time. This became grating  because they said it barely above a whisper and they just stood there repeating it until someone realized it. The table was so large that it was very easy for someone that was deep in a conversation several feet away to miss the call for their food. I don't know if there is a way to improve upon that strategy. 

Overall, I had a fun time with the people that were there and I enjoy the tapas style of eating. But, the dishes did not really impress me enough to give this place a 4 or 5 star review."}
{"text":"Service: Great 
Food: Good 
Restaurant: Clean but they could stand to turn down the music 50 notches.
Restroom: OK
Return Visits: Yes
Favorites: Pulpo asado, Gazpacho, Tres Leches

I've been coming here for about 3 years. I used to be in love with this place but now, I'm just in LIKE with it. They have a lot of flavor in their food, that hasn't changed... It's their portion sizes, they seem to be getting smaller every year. I get it, hard 'economic times' but if you're going to charge the same amount, can I get the same amount? I'm suffering from this economy too?!

Food, it's got lots of flavor. Gazpacho isn't for everyone, it's cold soup, but I like it! Pulpo asado is really good, just disappointed, as I stated earlier, the portions are smaller now. They used to pile that thing so high, now, it's almost the same size as the small tapas, no bueno. But the quality of the dish isn't affected, thank goodness. Tres Leches is bomb but, again, smaller than it used to be.

Atmosphere is kaka, lol and is the reason why I knocked one star off. I mean, I like it when a restaurant plays music to take care of those \"quiet\" moments that can happen when you're having dinner and you run out of things to talk about BUT c'mon, I at least want to be able to hear my thoughts!!! It can be so ear piercing that sometimes I wish I was a lot more drunk so that I wouldn't be bothered by the music.

Restaurant; there are several areas that you can sit: inside, inside the lounge-type area (which consists of couches and coffee tables as your dining area), outside and also their overflow part of the restaurant that is also indoors. Personally, I kinda of like the lounge area because that seems to be the only area that doesn't get as cramped as the rest of the restaurant. 

NOTE: Please don't ever go there at night and MOST especially on the weekends, without a reservation. You can wait 1-2 hrs just for a table of 2?! You'll be pissed. Usually on weekends, they have to open up their overflow portion of their restaurant that's usually closed during the week because it does get super duper busy on weekends. AND, since they get so busy, sometimes they try to stuff everyone into the restaurant that it can feel a little cramped."}
{"text":"I HATE GOING TO RESTAURANTS THAT MAKE ME FEEL LIKE I'M AT A CLUB BY BLASTING THEIR MUSIC SO LOUD THAT I CANNOT HEAR THE PERSON THAT I AM TRYING TO CONVERSE WITH!!!! OMG. It's the same story at the other location on Paradise which I used to visit quite frequently... By the end of the night I feel like I was lost my voice. Gah, minus 1-star for that. 

Their menu is pretty much the same, the waiter mentioned that they only changed the wine list but other than that, pretty much the same. I do have to mention that in the last year or so the size of the dishes seem to be shrinking but the prices are staying the same. Not too happy about that but whatever, the food is pretty good. 

We ordered: Gazpacho (Cold Soup), Albondigas (Meatballs), Pulpo Asado (Squid or Octopus, eh, something w/ tentacles), Lamb Skewers, Mango Mojito, and Tres Leches. All flavorful and full of goonie goodness! If you're not accustomed to cold soup, I really don't suggest the Gazpacho... I'm the only one out of my friends and family that like it LOL. 

Parking wasn't too bad, then again we lucked out since we found a spot right out front. 

RESERVATIONS, yes, I do suggest them. There were tons of people waiting and seemed a little annoyed when we were seated before them and they had been there way before us. Anyone that has eaten at Firefly, you know that there can be a 2 hr wait, so please, don't come without a reservation and definitely do NOT come hungry!"}
{"text":"This is such a great little joint.  We hung out with a group for happy hour and the drinks were great as well as their appetizers! It was a great atmosphere! We will be going here when we go to Vegas."}
{"text":"This was a great stop to get away from the hustle and bustle of the strip.  Great atmosphere and patio was adorable.  There was a great variety of things to choose from. super for sharing and trying new things. The servers and staff were very attentive without being pushy. A great find!"}
{"text":"If there is a reason why anyone would move to the God forsaken desert town full of sin and mischief, it would be so they could dine at Firefly on Paradise on a whim without driving 200 miles. If you think you've had a good tapas experience, think again. Firefly on Paradise had such creative plates that offer such an eclectic combination of flavors. It is definitely a dining experience you will leave thinking you won't forget because this is the only place that offers them. Their eggplant cannellonis are amazing.  The Lemon Chicken served with Firefly french fries were so fresh and tasted like home cooked goodness.  Definitely coming back here when we're in Vegas again.  The prices are decent considering the quality and portion size and the fact that it's a Tapas bar.  They don't take reservations though and the wait can be long and trust me, you don't want to sit outside in 106 degree weather."}
{"text":"bomb!! the tapas are creative and delicious! like the warm spinach salad with pine nuts and feta, and the mushroom tart, and the manchego mac n cheese! the service is great, portions are perfect, good atmosphere, and i cant really complain about the prices. but the reason this place gets its fifth star is bc of the banana-nutella sandwiches with warm nutella cream dipping sauce for dessert!!! need i say more??"}
{"text":"See those 2 stars up there? They serve as a reminder that no matter how good your food is, if the service blows then you've lost me as a customer forever. 

Came here mid-afternoon on a Tuesday, when it was lively but not exactly crowded. 

Our waiter, a diminutive Mexican with a thick accent and leopard mohawk which belied personality, came by to take our drink orders. I went with a traditional mojito and my gf got a sangria. 

Once they were dropped off, he came back to take our food order. We wanted to sample a lot, so I ordered the bacon wrapped dates, tuna peppers, lamb skewers, and fish sticks. 

Man, everything was awesome!

My mojito was perfectly prepared. The bacon wrapped dates are astoundingly good. They're small, but each one packs a serious flavor punch. Tuna peppers were light & refreshing, with a slight kick. The fish sticks had a tasty sauce accompany them, but otherwise I wasn't overly impressed. But the lamb skewers rocked, and they came with a side of... ah, geez... it was either couscous or quinoa. It was great. 

Everything was so great, in fact, that we were dying to order more. But our waiter was MIA. I scanned the place for him - nada. The few times I did see him, he showcased his learned skills in the art of \"how to not make eye contact with customers\". After around 10-15 of this shtick, I gave up. 

Finally, I flagged down a busboy and asked for the check. 

Then our waiter magically appears with the check and asks me if I want dessert. 

You're joking, right? I told him no and handed him my card, since I didn't feel like waiting to see when he'd show up to collect my payment. He returned it quickly with a muttered \"thank you\" that sounded like someone forced him at gunpoint to say it. 

I gave him around a 6% tip, which my dad later told me should've been ZERO. Per his wisdom, a low tip only makes you look cheap, but no tip says \"fuck you, you suck\". 

Should've gone zero. 

I might return here - the food was so damn good I could make my mouth water just thinking about it, but the shit service had me so hopping mad after we finished that I couldn't wait to jet out of there. 

If you're a manager, tell the mohawked server to grow a personality commensurate with his hairstyle. You lost more of my money because of him, and I've got a sneaking suspicion I'm not the only one."}
{"text":"BEST FOOD IN LAS VEGAS?!?! Every plate was full of rich flavors. Made you want to order more and more!"}
{"text":"Flew in on a Friday night and saw that Firefly had reservations available on OpenTable AND with 4.5 stars how could we pass this up? 

We were excited to arrive at this lively and casual establishment and proceeded to order the following: bacon wrapped dates, tuna tartare, ceviche, ham and cheese croquette, and the sliders. 

Within the first few dishes, we were beginning to doubt the 4.5 star average. All of the seafood did not taste fresh - ceviche was very sour and not much else, tuna tartare was extremely bland. Sliders were mediocre and a little overdone for my taste. The only thing I enjoyed were the bacon wrapped dates and my glass of white sangria. 

At $60 for 2, price was not bad but my Firefly definitely did not meet my expectations given all the amazing tapas places in SF. Service was just OK - it was quick but every time the food was just thrown on our table w/o a description. Food came out  a blink of an eye which made me question it's freshness. TIP: If food came out at a slower pace then perhaps your patrons will stay and drink more. We were in and out within 40 minutes and left feeling unsatisfied, impersonal, and rushed."}
{"text":"Great Sangria, red and white, but I personally prefer the red. Everything is in the style of tapas, but is ethnic infusion of all kinds. 

Everything is good, but my favorite dishes are the  Baked Brie, Mushroom Tart, Gazpacho, and the fries. Okay, but they're not just fries. They're heaven in a bowl with shredded parmesan and awesome dipping sauce. I'm kind of a fry connoisseur, by the way. 

One dish that I wasn't too hot on was the tuna tartar. If I want raw fish, I'm gonna go to a sushi joint. 

The service is kinda slow sometimes. Well, the wait staff is sometimes slow, but the kitchen is fast. I go with my bf and we order two rounds of three dishes per round. Go with more people and order at least three rounds. Once the food starts coming, it never stops. 

Its a little pricey, but you can order small or you can order large. Just don't go after you've smoked a blunt. 

We always take out-of-towners here to entertain. It always earns points. 

I don't recommend this place for a date during prime time as it can get really crowded and loud.

{"text":"Security ONLY on Latin night?! WTF!

JUST KIDDING, I know us Latin people are fiesty little mofos, but seriously, HELLA CREEPER at the door!

So basically this is the first time Ive ever been to Firefly and I can really only review this one night, LATIN NIGHT! So I met up with my beloveds, Vanessa, Sweet Angel Anthony, mArio, and John here and was ID'd by this hecka weirdo at the door. He gave me my free drink coupon and I went inside. The interior is large and spanish-esque and nice and cool. I loved their black and red lamps and their mosiac tiles by the fire place (I think thats what it was, twas dark inside!) The bar area is large and there are plenty of seats as well as high tables around the area. I love the high ceilings and color scheme they used as well.

The bartender WeSSSSSley is super awesome and nice and put up with Vanessa nicely. CAUFEE, CAWFEE, CWAFEE! She was rather loud and he handled her with ease. The drinks are strong and yummy and fresh mint complemented the mojitos nicely. 

I would def go here during the day to try it out. One of the things I did really like was the street taco area outside prior to leaving, for 2$ you can get pollo, adobada, or asada and you can put as much crema on it as you like.... I love me some crema!! LOL.

Go here on Latin night, the drinks are yummy, music is awesome, people are beautiful and get yourself a street taco to go!"}
{"text":"Great experience, excellent happy hour. My family of 6 ordered everything on the happy hour menu and we were extremely satisfied with all the tapas. The Fly Mule was a little too melon-y for our taste. The mojito was also good. Definitely worth $5."}
{"text":"Food poisoning.  You know its bad when you call the restaurant to complain, and the board of health calls you back."}
{"text":"Food was fabulous and the sangria was the best I've ever had!! The ambiance brings it all together :) Wonderful find outside of the strip.

Attended March of 2010, 2 years later and I still remember the experience and will definitely return in fact we already have reservations for banquet service for our upcoming trip back to Vegas.

Bottom line: highly recommend, you have to definitely try this place out."}
{"text":"If I need to take one star out is Due to the fact the Dish is h u g e and you cannot enjoy the incredible taste the chef offers. I tried almost 15 different place each one of them was delicious . The top dish for me was the Tuna tartar. But really it's worth the price. They Have Parking as well. For free. That's a rare thing in Vegas. 

Enjoy."}
{"text":"Great spot for locals AND tourists! I've been to the one in Summerland and since it closed down was worried the food wouldn't be as yummy.... I was wrong! Tasted great as always! The tapas are def the way to go!! I also order the chicken paella, takes 40 mins but enough to share and it tastes amazing!! Patio has a nice ambiance and it's a great spot to have some sangria and hang out with friends. 4 star due to the slow service. Half the time you can't find the server!!"}
{"text":"The wife and I are first timers at Firefly. I have been to the one on Paradise before, but was only there for a short time and only had one thing to eat, so that really does not count. 

We were in the neighborhood and decided to give it a try as it was about 3pm on a Saturday and we new we would not have to wait. The place was about half full for being an off hour. We were seated right away and helped immediately. All of the staff we encountered were very helpful and very friendly. We didn't try the famous sangria this time (we've heard its incredible) as we just stuck to water. We ordered 5 different tapas and a dessert. We liked the selection of vegetarian tapas. Some tapas places have only a handful, but even after selecting 5 there are more that we can try on our next visit. Each one was quite delicious. My favorite was the stuffed red peppers. 

We finished off the lunch with the chocolate tres leches. Wow...that is one mighty fine tres leches. Very chocolaty but also pretty light. 

The price averaged out to about $5 per dish, which was pretty nice. 

We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The exceptionally good, tasty food at Firefly Bistro makes it worth coming back here despite the noise (it's very, very noisy even if you come for early dinner).  My favorites:  stuffed dates, mussels in red curry sauce,  camarones con ajillo, meat and seafood skewers, and paella.  Not a fan of their red sangria (tasted like Benadryl).  Make reservations... there's a long line of folks waiting to get in!"}
{"text":"I was attending a convention in Las Vegas when stumbling across Firefly (and am SO I glad that I did). I have never really ventured off of the strip in Vegas and I realized by doing so I have really been missing out. The food at Firefly was fantastic! I should have known it was going to be great by the amount of people that were there at 5:00 PM mid-week...the place was packed! I enjoyed a variety of small plates & a few cocktails to go along with my food. Everything was delicious!!! The service was outstanding which made for a perfect dining experience!"}
{"text":"When in Vegas, Firefly is a must especially for happy hour! Lamb sausage, pork empanada, albondigas, Apple salad....oooooohhhh....I wish they had a Firefly back home with the same prices!"}
{"text":"Seriously good. The way to eat. Try a few small plates and all will be good. Bacon wrapped dates, Tuna tartare were awesome, one more, what shall it be?  The Sangria is the bomb."}
{"text":"This is one of the best places I've been to in Vegas! The menu, the food and service are excellent! Can't say enough good !!"}
{"text":"Our favorite spot in Vegas. Went there for my B-day dinner . we were 18 ppl.  Great food, great sangria, great atmosphere but most of all the waiter Mario,  Very efficient, he kept our table clean and our gasses full. 
I strongly recommend this place !!"}
{"text":"Amazing love the food and the drinks. Works of  Advice the drinks are strong but good"}
{"text":"Love this place. This has been the go to place when no one knows what we want to eat and just want something consistently good. We have been coming here for years (the original location and this place combined) my favorites are the ceviche, stuffed dates, the all the skewers, and Padron peppers. Honestly tho anything you order from here will be good, not once have I been disappointed. The best of all is the red sangria. It is a must try. The service is always consistent, and very friendly people."}
{"text":"I've tried this place a few times for the happy hour, then dinner with a group.  I cringe when someone suggests it.  
why: 1) service was consistently crap (full house, but not crowded).  2) food was overpriced. 3) they will push alcohol, no matter if you or someone in your party has had too much.  
Want a DUI? go there."}
{"text":"first tappas bar experience but Ive known about them for a while and had high expectations for this place after seeing the reviews.  However of our 4 different dishes, none impressed :(
Lobster bites was good (how can you mess up lobster lol) but nothing spectacular and not worth the price in our opinion)
exact same feelings for the Shrimp tempura, which was more crispy strings than shrimp.
Chicken chorizo was a disappointment, we made bootleg stuffed mushrooms mixing in whatever we had in the fridge that came out better than these.
I couldnt really eat the slidders since they had a sauce on it that Im picky about but wife said they were good, not special."}
{"text":"I'm sooo excited to be writing my first review here!

Firefly on Paradise was amazing.  I went based on lots of people's reviews here and loved it.  The place was definitely packed and I was glad I had called for reservation for the party of 4.

The food was great!  I had been missing Spanish food since I came back from Spain and the food here definitely hit the spot.  

The boquerones were traditionally done and were delicious.  The stuffed dates are to die for and a must-have.  We even tried it without bacon since we had someone following kosher diet in our group.  The veggie empanadas were also very tasty.  Another traditional spanish dish is the patatas bravas.  They made them very much like the ones I had in Spain though I would have liked them a bit spicier.

To compliment all the delicious food, we also enjoyed a couple of pitchers of sangria.  The service was good all the way through.

I can't wait to go back and try more dishes!"}
{"text":"After hearing about Firefly on Paradise for years, I was happy with my first visit and can't wait to return. As the other reviews have stated, this is an excellent spot for group outings as well as intimate dates. While my wife and I enjoyed our meal, I'd suggest going with a group so everybody has a chance to try a wide variety of tapas.

My wife and I decided on an early dinner on a Sunday night and booked our reservation through Open Table on Yelp, which was easy and convenient. We arrived and were seated immediately. It was still early for Vegas, so the restaurant was not fully buzzing yet. 

Our server Nahum greeted us and he was terrific throughout the dinner, as were the additional servers who promptly removed empty plates and refilled our drinks. Nahum explained some of Firefly's dishes and offered a few recommendations. We went with a few of the more popular items and since we'd had our share of meat during lunch that day, we went with dishes that were not meat-centric.

The tapas we tried:

The stuffed dates were outstanding and lived up to the hype. I was a bit weary at first, thinking that the bacon wrapping would overwhelm the date, but it was used more for its smoky qualities and the almond center was a nice way tie in all of the flavors. Highly recommended.

The fresh garbanzos were a nice snack seasoned with lime, chili, and sea salt. It was the first time I'd had them served in their shell; it was similar to munching on edamame, but with more flavor. 

The Firefly Fries were shoestring potatoes topped with parmesan and herbs and served with aioli. I didn't think they were anything extraordinary, but my wife really enjoyed the comfort food quality they brought to our meal. 

We both enjoyed the manchego mac and cheese, which was made with baby shell pasta instead of elbow macaroni and topped with a tomato-pepper relish. It was rich, creamy, and mellow.

The camarones a la diabla were more sweet than spicy, with the shrimp cooked perfectly and served in the sauce along with small pieces of grilled bread.

Surprisingly, the tapas filled us up more than we thought they would, so we intend to return to sample the other dishes as well as their popular sangria. We did, however, leave room for dessert and devoured the chocolate tres leches cake. It was a perfect ending to our dinner.

Note: it's unfortunate there's no sort of dress code at Firefly. It's a nice restaurant, but when diners show up looking like they just returned from their hotel's swimming pool, it ruins the atmosphere. I'm reserving my fifth star for a future visit."}
{"text":"what an off strip find in vegas..
i'm not sure if you can call them tapas because their portions are so freaken huge.. usually when u go to tapas places their portions are like 2 bites each.. this place nearly doubles those portions.. we went in a big group and ordered about 3 tapas per couple.. plus a paella to share.. and boy that was ALOT of food.. 
the server was really nice and chatted with us even thought they were pretty stacked.. i wish he had told us that we were overordering.. but too much of a good thing is never a bad thing. 
one very cool thing was.. that they forgot to put the seafood into our paella.. i didn't even notice.. until they brought a second one to the table WITH seafood.. that was a sweet doubleup...
highlights are the patatas bravas... tierra y mar skewers.. beef shrimp AND chorizo? i'm in heaven... stuffed dates.. camarones diablas
def a must visit in vegas restaurant."}
{"text":"Went to Las Vegas for a bachelorette party with 15 girls and didn't know where to go to dinner before we went out clubbing. Asked a friend who is a native to Las Vegas and she recommended FireFly Tapas Restaurant. 

I am sooooooo happy that she recommended this place!!! We were able to book through their party planners, Regina and Valeria, and they really set us up to have an amazing evening. We did the $55 per person set menu and this included 2 hours of unlimited drinks and 6 choices of tapas items. 

We picked 6 different tapas items and they brought them out unlimited. Every single item that we ordered was OUTSTANDING!!! I honestly can't pick which item was better than the other. We had the Bacon Wrapped Stuffed Dates, Camarones a la Diabla, Eggplant Canneloni, Ahi Tuna Skewers, Terra y Mar Skewers and the Chicken and Chorizo Stuffed Mushrooms. They were all AMAZING!!!

All of the drinks were great, but I do have to say the Sparkling Sangria was OUT OF THIS WORLD!!!! It was delicious!!!

Then, for dessert, they brought out cupcakes that were appropriate for \"bachelorette\" parties only...This was a cute little twist on dessert and just another way they were able to make our night so special!

I have to say, Regina and Valeria were extremely flexible with our reservation and the entire experience was amazing! They were willing to move the time around to accommodate us and make sure everything was perfect. 

We had Ivan as our server and he was outstanding as well! The service was impeccable. Ivan and a few other food runners were constantly at our table making sure every girl had a full drink in their hand at all times. He was there at a moment's notice with anything anybody requested!

I have to say that this was just an amazing experience and I would recommend this place to anyone visiting Las Vegas. I hope that they open them up all over because I can't wait to go back!!!!"}
{"text":"Food was great, drinks were great.  Too bad they don't understand how to run a business.  I purchased this Groupon for use on a Friday night while visiting Las Vegas.  I called first, because I read the restriction about only being able to use from 5:00 - 6:30 for dinner, and reservations being required.  The person I spoke with was really short with me, didn't really understand my question about \"having a groupon and needing a reservation during that window, etc.\".  She told me to just come right over, because they weren't busy and there was no wait.  When we got there, approximately an hour later, it was 6:15.  I know this, because we had told friends we would meet them there at 6:00 and I was upset with my husband because we were 15 mins late.  By the time we got sat and had ordered our drinks, it was probably 6:30.  We had a party of 8, and spent almost $300 and 1.5 hours there.  When I presented the Groupon, the waiter told me it was only valid from 5:00 to 6:30.  I explained that I had read the fine print, had called for a reservation, was told it was unnecessary, and was still seated by 6:30, regardless.  He persisted in saying that he understood, but still couldn't honor it, but i was welcomed to use it on a different night.  When I explained that we were in from out of town and had purchased it specifically to use that evening and asked him if he could let me talk with a manager, he said he would certainly check with the manager and explain my dilemma.  He came back a couple minutes later and told me that \"the manager was sorry, but they couldn't accept it, and since I was from out of town, I was welcomed to call Groupon and request a refund\".  Really?  I'm not a cheap skate.  In fact, I'm the opposite.  The measly Groupon amounted to a $17 discount on a $240 check, upon which I left a $50 tip.  I really don't care about the $17 but I do feel a little scammed for being lured into their business, bringing 7 other people with me (2 of which live in Las Vegas) only to be treated like dirt.  Worse than that, I hate that the employees at Firefly, clearly don't understand that the value in advertising is in bringing new customers into your business and keeping them coming back, not to bait and switch them, thus ensuring they will never visit again.  And, sadly, had the manager come over and spoken to me, I could have shared this feedback with him, rather than airing my grudge on Yelp.  Fail, Firefly.  Fail."}
{"text":"I came here for a late dinner on a Thursday night and was seated right away.

The restaurant has indoor, outdoor, and bar seating.

To start I had a cucumber martini made with Bombay Sapphire which was delicious.

For my meal I had the bacon wrapped dates after seeing so many positive reviews on Yelp. They lived up to the hype. I also had the pork empanadas. Yum!

Fun atmosphere, great food, and good service."}
{"text":"This place was great.  Huge selection of food that will fit anyones tastes.   The mac and cheese was our favorite dish! If you like Tapas style food,then exit the strip and get to Firefly."}
{"text":"Writing this review while still in Firefly. Yes, the tapas ARE that good! It is only matched by the impeccable service we got from Pepe and crew. Great food, good fiun, overall awesome experience! Nuff said..."}
{"text":"Would have put a 1 star, but the food and atmosphere are excellent. Absolutely terrible service followed by a forced 20% gratuity! Wtf! Our server Pepe' came to our table only to take our order, deliver food, and handle the check. I ordered food 5 minutes after my friends, and it took over 30 minutes to bring out my food after reminding several other servers and table cleaners. Almost laughable service. Leaving hungry and upset."}
{"text":"I really love this place! Get a group of friends out here, order a few things and share! Now that's what I call a social scene! I love the atmosphere of this scene, it's very loud, fast paced, and out going.  People who come here, come here to have a good time and that's what I get.  A good time.  The food here is great, I love the flavor that's incorporated into each dish.  The only thing that gets me here, is the prices.  You pay almost $10 for tapas, usually made for 3 to 4 people.  That's why I suggest you go with a group of 10 and split the check.  Now that sounds like a good time to me."}
{"text":"AMAZING, blown away, just amazing. I live in New York and I dream of the apple and manchengo salad! I cannot wait for my next visit to firefly and I am so excited!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for something off the strip that's got great food and you're short on time and can't dish out $50 for a fancy buffet, then Firefly on Paradise is where you and your friends are going for dinner before the club.

HERE'S A TIP: If your wait is long to get seated, go to the bar, order a pitcher of Sangria and put in your order for a paella because that will take 40 minutes to cook and by the time you get seated you can have the paella delivered to your table. By the way, the Sangria will change your life. 

       Let's start with the house bread which is garlic and the butter that accompanies it is this sweet, herby mix with I don't know what, but it tasted AMAZING! The staff saw that our group enjoyed this and brought extra bread out without us having to ask. We ordered the mac and cheese which was delicious and used the pasta shells instead of the elbow macaroni. Definitely home made and not out of a box, creamy and delicious.The goat cheese dish was good and had a sort of marinara base. I'm not a huge fan of goat cheese but it went well with the base. The mixed paella was out of this world! I need more paella in my life after eating the mixed paella which consisted of pieces of chicken, shrimp and clams and just a great flavorful bed of rice.  I'm still heart broken that we didn't take the leftover mixed paella (there was at least a cup of paella left) to go because my friend said she didn't want her car to smell (we were headed to XS at Encore after dinner and it would've sat in the car for like 3 hours).
It was my friend's birthday, and they brought us flan for her at no additonal charge and put a candle in it. Luckily she hates flan so I got to eat most of it and yeah, I'd lie and say it's my birthday anytime I visit here to get free flan.
 
          Everyone from the hostess at the front to the bartender and wait staff outside were courteous, beautiful and attentive. Next time I'm in Vegas, I'm definitely eating here and trying even more tapas and taking the leftover paella to-go and eating it on the way home."}
{"text":"Very tasty-yes; the stuffed dates are a must.  Nice to find a place in Vegas that's not either cheesy or super high end.   Just a good place to have a nice dinner."}
{"text":"On one of our many trips to Vegas, Minh and I met up with our friends Ashley and her fiancé Taj for a late night dinner. This place came highly recommended by Kent D. Seeing the amazing reviews and all the yummi photos and not to mention they have Sangria, I was in! 

When I told Ashley where we were going she was overly excited, come to find out this is one of her favorite places to eat at. 

Now, parking here is hard, you will be making circles in the parking lot trying to stalk people coming out of the restaurant. Give yourself more than enough time is all I can suggest. A lot of their clientele are people pre-gaming before a night of drinking and dancing so it will be busy until about 11:00pm. They do not take reservation on Friday and Saturday nights either. 

Minh and I were the first to arrive; we put our name in and had a seat outside. We were told it would be no more than a 20-30 minute wait for a party of four.
Our friends arrived just in time as our name was called about 10mins later. I think we only waited a total of 15mins or so which is awesome considering the place was packed when we arrived.

Most of the staff was nice; we were lead to the back of the restaurant, which was fine for us. The place is loud and it can be hard to hear each other, so do not be surprised if people look at you if you are talking loudly so someone at your table so that they can hear you! 

Our server came by and took our drink order I had a White Sangria, while Ashley had a Mojito (which btw is super strong).

The menu is impressive with what they have, wanted to order one of everything just to try it! Ashley made suggestions on what was the BEST; all her suggestions were true to her word too!

I started out with trying (and ooo btw the White Sangria was prefect, strong and tasty... can I get a pitcher?!) 

-Ceviche of Shrimp-tiger shrimp, avocado, crispy corn tortilla 
-Steak and Mushroom Skewers- grilled filet, roast garlic cream, red wine reduction
-Ahi Tuna Skewer-mango, basil, mustard-ginger glaze

I was going to rate this with a perfect five but towards the end our server got sloppy and started forgetting orders. I ordered Empanada's and as the rest of my friends and boyfriend received their food; I was left sipping on my sangria wondering where my darn empanadas were. Well maybe they take some time to make I thought. Therefore, I let it go not thinking much until Minh realized that I still did not get my order. 
We tried to get our server attention, which took some flagging down. She finally came over and we asked her about my order. She stared at us blankly and said, \"Did you order Empanada's?\" I said yes I did. \"oh, I didn't put your order in\" When she walked back to the kitchen, I guess they were sitting there for awhile she came back and said that someone must have put the order in because they were sitting in the pickup line. Knowing that they were sitting for a while, I did not have a good feeling to eat them, so I told her never mind. She made kind of a stink about it so instead we asked for a box to take it with us.

Would I come back again, yes! It's rare for me to say that if I had semi crappy service, but the food and sangria is just damn good!"}
{"text":"Best Tapas and Mojitos @ this restaurant!! I wish they had one in the bay area. I now try to make it a point to come by here when visiting. On this trip we came here for Maritel C's bachlorette dinner. They accommodated our large party of gals and we had great service. The food came out pretty quick...a star for that and 4 more stars for the drinks!!! Yummy!! Can't go wrong with a mojito, mango mojito, or some sangria!! 

Best thing to do is come here with a group of people and order different tapas to sample them all....then pick your favorites! Tapas + Drinks = 5stars for this place!"}
{"text":"This was a great little place tucked away off the strip. The food came out really fast and was packed with flavor. It was perfect to share with a ton of variety. We went on a Tuesday night and it was packed! The Sangria and Mojitos were awesome as well!

I'd definitely return here for a great deal!"}
{"text":"We were soon hungry and found this place that serves paella and tapa style food!! Service was quick and had a bunch of food that we took back and ate at our hotel! The paella was massive! Saved it for later and it was still delicious! Come during happy hour! Great selection of drinks (try the mango mojito) and tapas are all very organized so you can decide very easily."}
{"text":"The star in LAS VEGAS. There is great service, wonderful food, super friendly staff, and a warm, welcoming environment. Try the pitcher of red sangria."}
{"text":"I absolutely adored this place. I love the tapas concept because I get to try a little bit of everything. I won't say much because I know it's already been said, but I highly recommend this place. The food was flavorful, creative and fun. The sangria was awesome and the prices were fair. The service was great. 

My favorite part was the bacon wrapped figs. It was a refreshing combination of flavors. It was like eating bacon candy!"}
{"text":"BOMB!!! Since their reopen I have to say even better than before. Their new facility is HUMONGOUS!! 10x the size of their old spot. The layout and design of the restaurant is very chic. Their full bar is a great place to entertain drinks!

As for the Tapas! Well........ 
They are simply delicious. I love it all. The mini filet is excellent. The potatoes that came with it are great too. 
Can't go wrong with the shrimp either. The sauce is succulent. 

But the real kicker here is the Mac and cheese! Nothing like anything I've had except maybe the Mac and cheese at BarBistro by Chef Beni Velasquez. These two Mac and cheeses are the best in the city. 

Overall a nice dinner date venue."}
{"text":"Great food and even better service ! Patrick at the bar gave us awesome recommendations and kept us entertained - wish we would have gone earlier in our trip because we would have gone back to try more tapas!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Vegas.  Good and reasonably priced food.  We had the cerviches of shrimp, bacon wrapped date with walnut and cheese, mussels, lamb chop, and paella.  All were delicious."}
{"text":"So many options, but there was only so much room in my stomach to try them all. Had the tuna tartare, stuffed dates, steamed mussels, & the lam chops aka $40. Not too shabby on the pricing. 

Before I get into the \"imo\" of the food, I have to recommend the sangria ($13/pitcher). Probably the best sangria I've had so far. Sangrias tend to either have too much alcohol or just be too fruity, & I don't know how they make it here, but man oh man the balance was just perfecto. 

Okay, back to the food. The tuna tartare was okay. My favorite about this plate was the taro chips. Those are some tasty chips. But, I have had better tuna tartare. I am not a dates fan. And although this taste wasn't particularly for me, everyone who enjoys dates in my group loved them. But if you don't like the texture of dates--yeaaaah, don't try this one. The lam chops were okay in my opinion. I've had better lam chops as well. Not sure if it was the texture, the taste, or just both but the sautéed lentils & julienne vegetables were just not doing it for me. The star of all these plates were the mussels. Be warned, this is not a tapas plate. They are very generous in portions with their mussels, but it is nothing to complain about. The sauce just had my taste buds exploding with flavor. This is a must-have for mussel lovers. 

I would compare Firefly to Cheesecake Factory, but a more elevated version. I would've been happy with just the mussels & the sangria all night long. For a group of 17, I did expect a bit of better service, but I guess we can't have it all now can we? 

Eat on."}
{"text":"On a quick weekend work assignment, I popped into Vegas and decided to partake in the tapas at Firefly based on the Yelp reviews.  As usual, my fellow Yelpers did not fail me.  This place is hoppin' at night but the food is excellent.

The sangria is infused for days to obtain maximum fruitiness so it's a must if you come here.  As for the tapas, here is what we sampled:

Stuffed dates - bacon wrapped in a red wine reduction, it was slightly sweet but still left me wanting for more.

Pork empanada - I never thought anyone would do empanadas right until I tried this one.  It was sublime.  Flaky crust with just the right amount of seasoning on the pork.  

Pulpo asado - I love octopus but this was a disappointment.  I didn't care much for the preparation and the octopus itself felt slightly on the chewy side.

Baby back ribs - slabbered in mango BBQ sauce, it was tender and the sauce did not overpower the ribs.  Delish!

Crispy duck roll - the duck itself was cooked perfectly yet the hoisin sauce really ruined the dish.  It was the worst dish of the evening.

Steamed mussels - a simple dish that was executed well with a white wine reduction in a creamy coconut broth.

Lamb chops - the red wine reduction was spectacular and really brought out the flavor of the well-cooked lamb.  However, the lentils left a lot to be desired.

Paella - perhaps I'm just too picky about Spanish dishes but I thought this paella was just okay.  I'm a traditionalist so I love my paella cooked in that lovely paella pan where I get the burned rice at the bottom that makes me think I'm back in Spain.

A couple of misses but everything else was pretty darn tasty and that's coming from a girl that goes to Spain a lot."}
{"text":"This is the best tapas restaurant that I've ever visited. Every dish is perfect. Standouts include the mac 'n' cheese, the empanada, the stuffed dates, and the stuffed mushrooms. They also serve a killer red sangria.

The prices are a steal, ranging from $6 to $13 per dish; the entrees cost more but are still very reasonable. While the restaurant is located off the strip, it's just a short taxi ride away. And the restaurant itself is roomy with a charming ambiance. My husband and I make an effort to visit every time we go to Vegas."}
{"text":"Pretty darn good Tapas place in Vegas. The boyfriend and I arrived in Vegas around noon on a Tuesday and decided to have lunch here. There was no wait and we were seated. 

A few of what we had: 
Passion Fruit Mojito: I looooove passion fruit mojitos and Firefly makes pretty good passion fruit mojitos. Blood orange mojito is also good but I prefer passion fruit.
Patatas Bravas- potatoes with spicy aioli. Pretty good. I'm a potato lover and I've bad better BUT for this restaurant, I'll definitely order it again.
Firefly Fries- I'd skip on this next time and order the patatas bravas instead. 
Camarones al ajillo- shrimp with lemon garlic butter. Loved this dish that I ordered two. I'm a shrimp lover and this wasn't THE BEST shrimp I've ever had but its pretty darn close.
Stuffed Dates- boyfriend ordered this and he loved it.
Empanada- boyfriend also ordered this and he looooved it.

Since this restaurant is tapas, small plates = must buy more. Which really means buy everything hahaha. We ended up ordering more than we needed to and when we do go back (we most likely will), we will probably order what I had stated above (we actually had tons more but they weren't worth mentioning). I would definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner on a date. I have to say, Firefly have crazy good food, excellent service, awesome alcoholic beverage. One of the best in Vegas, and we've eaten at what were claimed to be the best."}
{"text":"I got Salmonella poisoning from here. We ate there last Wednesday 4/23/13. Thought this was a nice place. Went to VegAs for my birthday and had dinner with 6 of my friends and every one of us got salmonella poisoning. One of my friends was hospitalized for 5 days. Ruined my trip, my birthday and now I can't pay rent because I've had to call into work the last 5 days. Thanks a lot I will never ever go here again."}
{"text":"We were thrilled to see their new location. Ample bar seating and no one crammed around the little cocktail tables any more. Drinks are 5 stars.  Crafted cocktails with a little ingredient background to boot. The curious in our group got a little taste test of some interesting bottles of spirits. I sampled the sparkling Sangria. Delicious! The tapas menu was varied but a little lacking in vegetarian options. We ordered generously and drank plenty for a couple of hours. Our bill before tax and tip for 4 was $150. Fleur de Cossette, Old Fashioned & Watermelon mojito were favorites. Worth driving/cabbing off the strip!"}
{"text":"I really liked this place.  Great place to meet after work.  One trip to Spain and now I'm hooked on tapas.  I think this is the best place in Vegas for tapas."}
{"text":"Nothing but a praise for those guys!

Super attentive service regardless big crowd. Great waitressing staff. Very tasty food. Extremely fair prices. Fun atmosphere to be in.

What else can one possibly want? Its TOTALLY worth cab ride from the strip.

\"I Like\"
\"Very Nice\"

{"text":"Their signature dates dish is genuinely one of the best things I've ever had the pleasure to taste. The artichoke hearts on toast was amazing too. The dishes are small, so you'll be ordering multiple items to be satisfied, and it's definitely worth it to leave satisfied. We did try the shrimp ceviche and weren't great fans. It would probably be better to shoot for something else. Our server, Carlos, was excellent. We'll most certainly be dreaming about those dates until we're able to make it back"}
{"text":"I've never been here... so rating neutral. BUT we picked this restaurant because the high Yelp rating. Called the restaurant a few weeks before hand with questions, very nice. When we arrived in Vegas called about 8 hours before hand and they said we needed a reservation at least 2 weeks in advance. Why didn't they say anything beforehand. Not sure if I want to try next time?"}
{"text":"This was so memorable that we had to eat Tapas the next night.  The only thing we did wrong was try a different Tapas bar which was a flop. You must try the Sangria, the sliders, the stuffed dates and the spicy hot shrimp. The shrimp tempura was good as well.  We had the flan which was very good.  We thoroughly enjoyed this place and would go back for sure   Best of all was the service, the price and the atmosphere.  It was a local place and people were friendly and about the only thing I can say negative about this restaurant was that it was a bit warm inside for my liking but it was 106 degrees outside."}
{"text":"We came on a Friday night. It was a Latin night. We both ordered the spicy beef salad. The beef was seasoned well and the dressing was amazing! I couldn't enough!"}
{"text":"I've wanted to come here for awhile, but for some reason it took me three years to make it in. It won't be another three years before I return. The food and service were great when I dined here for lunch last week.

There wasn't a wait for a table when we arrived for lunch on a weekday. I'm sure evenings and weekends are a different story. The ambiance of the restaurant is cozy and I could see this being a great spot for a date night. Our waiter was great about refilling drinks, checking in frequently, and getting food to us as soon as it was ready. There weren't any delays in getting additional orders placed. 

I really enjoyed every item that we ordered. The menu offered a nice variety of dishes so everyone will find something they are sure to enjoy. All of the plates had a lot of flavor and I was impressed with everything I ate.

Roasted Beet & Persimmon Salad- the largest serving of the items we ordered, several really great flavors that came together well, loved the pecan crusted goat cheese and beets
Stuffed Dates- my favorite tapas I tried, bursting with flavor and the texture was perfect
Padron Peppers- one of my favorite pepper dishes I've tried, salty in a good way
Empanada- serving includes two empanadas, the outer pastry was delicious and the sauce on top was great too
Chicken & Chorizo Stuffed Mushrooms- simple, but delicious
Manchego Mac-N-Cheese- addicting, this was really yummy and was tastier with each bite, one of the heartier tapas options
Warm Persimmon Cake- yummy, a moist bread pudding with delicious raisin gelato on top, a delicious dessert for sure

I'll definitely return and bring my husband for a nice date night!"}
{"text":"One of the most reasonably priced restaurants you will find anywhere near the strip. Great variety and great service!"}
{"text":"Firefly is an absolute must if you like tapas. Perfect setting for groups, dates, or just flying solo and the food/drinks are out of this world. You can't go wrong here so make sure to check it out!"}
{"text":"This place has really good food period. It is all well priced, quickly made and extremely satisfying. The tar tar was absolutely delicious I recommend that Item first and foremost. The sangria is also super tasty. When coming with a large group just order and bunch of plates and have at it. Everything that we ordered was really good and all the plates were cleaned and glasses empty. Satisfaction at a good price and only a 10$ cab ride off the strip!!"}
{"text":"Excellent place to have some delicious tapas!  I love coming here with a few friends and ordering a bunch of items to share.  Order a pitcher of their yummy mojitos to drink with your food."}
{"text":"I really don't venture out East of the Nile (LV Strip) because it REALLY feels like I have to navigate myself through the river of cars to get to Firefly. But it is worth it. I've seen comments of this place being better than Cha Cha Cha of San Francisco but to me it is not as great. There is definitely a wider selection of tapas here than triple \"C\" but the flavors are not as on point.  I like the creativity of the ingredients here but all dishes all lack  the right amount of seasoning. Salt, pepper, chili, acid !! Stick to those basics people. 

Definitely great for large crowds, order large pitchers of Sangria and Mojitos and have a blast! Don't be too dependent on the food because they tend to come out in waves.  If you miss the wave, you will be suffering...."}
{"text":"I've had the tuna tar tar, ribeye steak, chicken skewers, steak skewers, ribs, must have mac n cheese, dates, meatballs, and a few others. All were fantastic! Everyone loves their food."}
{"text":"On my never ending quest to eat food, I rarely return to a place to eat more than once.  If I should return, it is because the food, atmosphere or people there are amazing.  Firefly definitely falls on that list for me.

I came here on a special date with the lady and was not disappointed at all.  I was able to introduce her to new and amazingly delicious foods.  Spanish tapas are something out of this world, and firefly does it right.  From the artichoke toasts to the camarones al ajillo to the empanadas to the sangria, everything we tried was amazing.

The foods, the atmosphere, and the roaming Spanish guitarist all make Firefly an amazing place to enjoy food in Vegas again and again."}
{"text":"Went with family and ordered a variety of tapas. You can't go wrong with any of the tapas. This place is amazeballs. Chicken tinga empanada for the win."}
{"text":"I have been coming to firefly since the old location down the street. I have not been back to the new location in a few years but it didn't disappoint. Everything was good and quality was also good. The paella is amazing and worth the wait since it is made to order. Prices have stayed the same over the years but noticed that sangria pitches got smaller and more expensive. Best to come during happy hour for 1/2 prices."}
{"text":"The happy hour is fantastic! The mojitos were \"Bomb- tasting\". If you have 3 or more people - buy a pitcher!!! The dates, Chicken skewer and pork empanadas were so tasty. The parking lot had a security guard so I felt my car was safe. The staff were friendly and the restrooms were clean! I am definitely coming back!!!"}
{"text":"I'm from out of town and I went to Firefly on behalf of a friend. Let me say, hands down, one of the best spots in Las Vegas. The service was impeccable, the food was beyond words and the sangria... Wow. Not only was the atmosphere amazing along with its food and drinks but it's priced at a perfect amount. Such a special place off the Strip. Carlos, the owner came to our table, introduced himself and even sent us an exquisite dessert platter. I was in Heaven. Thank you Carlos and to your whole team at Firefly. I will be coming back and bringing more guests!!!"}
{"text":"Great server, Joshua, great food, and super fast. It made a great birthday dinner experience."}
{"text":"Amazing experience.  I have to go to vegas every year for a work conference, and Firefly will definitely be on the list of must-visit restaurants, for me, right there next to Nobu in terms of awesomeness.

We tried about 15 dishes, the sangria, and cocktails.  All were quite amazing, especially the food.

From the ahi tuna skewers, to the manchego mac and cheese, to the petit filet, lamb chops, and much much more, it was all rememberable and amazing.

The most enjoyable  dishes for me were tuna tartare, the manchego mac and cheese, ahi tuna skewers, and the flan :)

Lastly, value wise, it is extremely affordable.  We went with 5 people and were shocked when the bill came because we thought we would have done much more damage.

Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"My cousin suggested we check out this tapas bar which is located at the end of Main Street (e.g. where the Fremont Main Street experience) at the Plaza Hotel and Casino in downtown Las Vegas.  You'll see this dome shaped window as you look down Main Street on the second floor.  Just walk towards the Plaza Casino and entrance to the second floor as you're facing the main entrance of the casino from Main Street is to the left.  You'll see signs for bingo.  

We sat in the dome shaped area, looking directly out onto Main Street.  Pretty cool view and a different experience looking out.  I like the ambiance of Firefly.  Considering it's downtown where many of the casinos have that old-school feel, Firefly kind of takes you away from that atmosphere which has a modern but comfortable feel (not the glitzy, you can't afford me feel like the bars on The Strip).  The restrooms however, still need to be modernized and don't match the rest of the ambiance.  But, I'm not going to hate on that - except it's hella bright in that restroom!  Yikes!  My eyes needed some serious adjustment.  

But, it's the tapas that we came for.  I checked out Yelp first to see what it is that is a must try.  Everyone mentioned the stuffed dates and, no, it's not dates per se, it just kind of looks like a date.  What is it is a bacon-wrapped, smoked almond with a little red wine reduction sauce and sprinkles of blue cheese.  It was tasty and something a little different.  

Other items that we sampled were the:

Veggie empanada - filled with spinach, mushroom, artichoke, herbed cream cheese in a nice flaky pastry with a dash red pepper aioli.  This was yummy.

The waitress recommended the steak and mushroom skewers because she liked the sauce that comes with it which is part roast garlic cream with a red wine reduction.  It was okay - I'd like my steak to be a little bit more tender and smaller bit sized pieces.  

Paella which is a saffron rice with clams, shrimp, calamari, chicken, and Spanish chorizo sausage.  I have a had better in terms of a more flavorful rice, but it was edible and the sausages helped to spice it up.  

For three girls - it was enough, but were still a little hungry - and of course, fries would be the topper to help us finish the remainder of the red sangria (by which was also okay I have had better, but it was tasty enough).  Firefly Fries which are skinny fries and dusted with parmesan, herbs and aioli.  Nice.  

On my next trip I'd definitely go back because there seems to be more on the menu that I'd like to try.  I liked our waitress, she was really friendly and was prompt with the service.  There's another location out on Paradise and I heard from the waitress the owner was considering another location."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant to dine or hang out when in Vegas. 

The menu offers a variety of more of the American-Spanish fusion tapas rather than traditional Spanish tapas.

We ordered:
5/5 - Camarones a la diabla (shrimp with firely sweet and spicy sauce)  $10
5/5 - Grilled Scallops $12
4.5/5 - Steamed mussels $9.50
3/5 - Seafood paella $20 45 min. wait so order in advance
5/5 - Large Salad $12

The shrimp and scallops were absolutely flavorful and cooked to perfection.  Even the salad with sun dried tomatoes and roasted peppers was absolutely delicious! 

Since this is a Spanish tapas restaurant, we decided to try their seafood paella. The paella takes 45 minutes to prepare and for most people, that's not a long wait since the times goes by fairly quickly when people are talking and sampling tapas. Nevertheless, it wasn't very authentic so will skip that next time around.

Great service and lively atmosphere. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Honestly the best place to eat in Vegas... and The best part ... it's NOT on the strip.  Whatever you order you will be impressed.  The wait for this place is sometimes one hr. and there's a reason for it.  Tuna Tar Tar, Steak Sliders and Dates and the apple salad.  I can go on for ever.  This is a LAS VEGAS Must Eat."}
{"text":"Firefly never fails! I've been coming here for years and it is consistent. Service is always good and fast even on busy nights. They have a nice wine list but if you're looking for something on the sweeter side, their pitchers of red and white sangria are infamous. Some of my favorite food items are the apple/Manchengo salad, boquerones, stuffed dates, and chicken skewers. I love that firefly is tapas style because you can try a little bit of everything."}
{"text":"Best Tapas restaurant! Tuna Tartare is my favorite!"}
{"text":"Wow. Service is fantastic.  Food is so fun and delicious.  Tapas satisfy all desires."}
{"text":"@FireflyLV on Paradise has long been known as an OFF the STRIP hotspot with hundreds of reviews,photos and news articles about it. 

Recently they opened a 2nd location at the Plaza in downtown Las Vegas and it has received an ever BETTER reception if that is possible. The view downtown seems to be all the rave:) 

My visit was around 7pm on a Thursday night since I've seen the crowds here on the weekend I wanted to avoid a long wait and I was delighted to be seated immediately. The place was packed and everyone seemed to be having a great time eating & drinking. 

We ordered filet mignon sliders, fries, some lamb chops and the waitress recommended the bacon wrapped dates!!! No drinks this time 

The menu has a nice selection of tapas all priced very reasonably and the food is presented like those other higher priced chic places;) 

The food was incredible, the dates are fantastic, wrapped in bacon with crumbled bleu cheese in a red wine reduction. Soooooo Good I had 2 orders:) 

The lamb chops were great, cooked perfectly medium-rare in a nice wine reduction sauce with julienned veggies and capers. Really I could have ate 10-12 of the lamb chops and been good. 


The sliders I didn't like the cheese sauce I could have done without-maybe some dijon mustard instead-the filet mignon burger didnt seem any different than any other sliders Ive had. I like the crispy onion straws but I'll skip the sliders next time. 

The fries were good-nothing spectacular just fries with grated cheese. I'd like to see some truffle fries or something;) 

The dessert was outlandish-Chocolate and cherry bread pudding[warm w/port wine reduction, vanilla ice cream] -I could have ate another one. 

It was a TOUGH choice between the bread pudding and the Banana-Nutella sandwiches[w/Nutella cream dipping sauce] which the table next to us was enjoying:) 

My overall experience was fantastic the service was fast,friendly and quite helpful. The food was good. The atmosphere was fun & comfortable. When I left iasked the hostess if I could present the manager with something 

She looked at me a little strange but came back with the manager who was quite pleasant and accepted the TOP RATED RESTAURANT(#3) on Urbanspoon I gave him-telling me it would be given to the right person. 

UPDATE: To my pleasant surprise it has been placed in the menu marquee right outside the front door:)"}
{"text":"Tried this place out since high ratings on Yelp and it was on Food Network as one of the top places for great food at great prices.  

As most have mentioned the stuffed Dates were amazing (I was a little hesitant to try - but certainly was worth it).  We also had the Artichoke Toast, Ham & Cheese Croquetas, Camarones Ajillo & Terra y Mare Skewers.  Our favorite was the Terra y Mare Skewers.  I am not a shrimp fan but the Camarones Ajillo was our 2nd favorite with a great sauce.

Service was great and very helpful to assist us on first time visiting.  We did make reservation ahead of time just in case and it was a great experience overall to dine at this place.

If you are in the area this is a great place to eat and you have to try a little bit of everything.  Overal for the 5 plates, 2 drinks & 2 desserts our meal was $50.  I believe this is a great price for the quality of the food with the great service."}
{"text":"Perhaps I just did not order the right thing.   Or maybe because I was not drinking pitchers of sangria like others at my table that I was able to taste what their food really taste like.

SO not impressed... the empanadas taste like the Goya frozen ones that you get from the spanish supermarket.  The fries ehh okay.

Although the location is bigger now it is still to loud for a decent conversation... and again the food was just okay.

So if you want okay food and alcohol go here.  Otherwise there are plenty of delicious places to go in Vegas."}
{"text":"One of our favorite restaurants. We left in 2008 and came back to more Firefly locations. We tried one of the new locations and hated it. We tried it again thinking it was a fluke and it was still terrible. Then the food poisoning happened. and while I would not wish that on any business, it has forced them to close the other locations and focus again on their main one. 

This has allowed them to go back to doing what they did so well before. Although I wish they would bring out the bread, olives and honey almond butter like they used to. Now you have to ask for it. They have some new things on the menu now too like the Chicago beef sandwiches. Their flavors on that one are spot on. (I'm from Chicago, I can say that). The dates are to die for and 

The things have have changed for the not so good are the mushroom tarts, filet sliders (now it's much cheaper meat) and ham and cheese croquets. Those are so bad that the inside is ground down to the consistency of baby food. 

So it's all about knowing what to order."}
{"text":"We needed a late night place to eat dinner after we saw Blue Man Group, and this place fit the bill, as they were open until 1am on a Sunday night. Fresh made tapas, and we ordered enough for the whole table of four. Our server was kind and attentive and plates were cleared quickly. The food was delicious, and we tried a large variety of dishes. Each dish was large enough for everyone at our table of four to get a portion. It makes me want to return for paella. The Red sangria was also delicious. Of note were the empanadas, Albondigas and shrimp diablo(?). Disappointing goat cheese dish. Lots of manchego (sheep cheese) dishes, including their take on a mac and cheese. If you like tapas, and even if you've never tried it, this is a good one to seek out."}
{"text":"Small plates. Yes. Large taste also yes. 

I got the gazpacho. Cold tomato soup. Very different very tasty. 

I got the stuffed peppers. A little spicy but great taste. Fried onion rings on top with cream cheese in the middle. Good combination. 

Congenial atmosphere. Attentive wait staff but not over bearing. 

Recommended."}
{"text":"Keeping this short and sweet because I'm not a fan of tapas. 

Selection here was great. Food was inventive and nicely displayed upon arrival. For the most part, service was quick on our initial order, but then very slow on our order additions. We had to remind them multiple times about orders already placed. 

I didn't really like the type of people this place attracted either, but you'll be fine if you live in Las Vegas but wished you lived in Los Angeles. That is not at the fault of the restaurant, but still a factor in my dining experience. I didn't think the final bill reflective the quality or amount of food we received, but then again, I don't get tapas.

Also, we found a giant hair in one of our dishes. I understand no one is going to die from a hair, but at the price you're paying for a tiny dish, I except a little more attentiveness to cleanliness."}
{"text":"Oooooooh my god! The food is soooooo good! Atmosphere is great, service is great, food is great what more can you ask for. This spot is a absolute must if your in town."}
{"text":"There is a reason firefly has almost a near perfect rating with over 1k reviews... it is awesome!

Tapas restaurant with a full bar; I can't recommend this place enough for groups. We have been there a couple times before and last night's stellar experience was on par with our other visits. 

Go with a group and order a paella or two (recommend the mixed paella with all the seafood, chicken and chorizo in it for $30ish it is a great deal because it can serve up to 4 people) to start to share as a table (they take 40ish minutes to make, so order it first thing) and then have everyone pick out a plate or two to start with and enjoy! The sangria is pretty good, not the best, but an awesome value at $33/pitcher. Another favorite appetizer of mine is the petite filet, they cook the steak perfectly and the accompaniments and sauce is tasty!

Give firefly a try for your next get together or celebration."}
{"text":"I never thought going to a different location the food would be different. 

*Food*
5/5 Bread w/ sweet almond butter spread: I'm addicted to this FREE appetizer. It's just a simple french bread cut into slices with olives and this amazing sweet almond butter spread.  

3/5 Baked Filets of Tilapia: Tasted like your normal fish sticks with tarter sauce. It came with a salad and this light dressing. I loved the dressing very light and I can't really explain it but it was delicious. 

4/5 Ahi Tuna Skewer: The tuna's seared with mango's left in a a sweet soy sauce salsa. First I didn't think this was my ahi tuna skewer till I realized OH ITS SEARED. I was expecting fresh chunks of tuna but its okay it gave the skewer a nice flavor seared. 

3/5 Camarones al ajillo: My favorite and one of my usual orders at firefly, I was pretty sad to taste that there was a huge difference between the paradise location and this location. Camarones al ajillo is shrimp/garlic/butter and its delicious. I felt at this location there wasn't enough butter or garlic but more lemon. It had more of a tangy sauce rather than the butter goodness I'm used to. 

4/5 Steak and mushroom skewers: One of my usual orders, I pretty sad to taste that there was a difference between the paradise location and this location. The creamy sauce the skewers are placed in tasted off. If you want to try this tapas I suggest trying it at their paradise location first because you'll absolutely love it there. 

4/5 Filet Mignon sliders: The filet Mignon came wit 2 small buns topped with some kind of creamy cheese and caramelized onions which were crunchy. Very delicious. The filet Mignon was also juicy. 

*Drinks*
5/5 Sangria: Red, everyone knows Firefly is known for their sangria. I've always gone to their other location on paradise but my boyfriend and I couldn't get a reservation there. So we tried this location and in my opinion I think the sangria was much strong here than their other location. We ordered a pitcher for 2 people surprisingly we finished it. 

*Desert*
5/5 Chocolate \"tres leches\" cake: get this desert, I've tried the Gelato which was also good but super bad for you lol but this cake omg.. it melts in your mouth. Its not your traditional chocolate cake you would expect. The cake is super soft and what ever cream sauce they drizzle on it is so yummie...

*Service*
5/5 The Service here was amazing! I went on Valentines day with my boyfriend. Before walking in I felt bad because the workers had to work on Valentines day. I thought they would be sluggish or rude but omg they were so nice. I had a great waitress that was super funny. Also we had a busboy that knew the menu really well that helped us with our order."}
{"text":"I love Firefly, one of my favorite restaurants to go to. 

Design: 5/5 the place has dimmed lighting with ruby red lighting, very vintage. Great ambiance

*what I USUALLY order & what YOU should order*

Camarones Al Ajillo: 5/5 Is shrimp in this lemon butter sauce with slices of bread. When your eating it I suggest dipping the bread and letting it soak in the butter sauce. My favorite dish!

Steak and Mushroom Skewers: 5/5 yummm its a roasted filet in a creamy garlic sauce. The sauce is a perfect add on dipping sauce for the steak. Compliments the filet's roasted flavor. 

Sangria (a pitcher): 5/5 Trust me best Sangria in town, 1 glass won't be enough. Even if your with a group of friends I usually can down 2-3 glasses myself because its so delicious. Its not acidic and it tastes like juice with a hint of EXCITEMENT 
 
Service: 4/5 The hostess are very sweet, there's usually a wait. The door ways kind of small and hard to maneuver around because there's usually a lot people packed in that small area. The servers are really nice and attentive. 

Happy Hour: 5/5 I absolutely love their happy hour, I definitely take a late lunch when ever possible.  its 50% off All Drinks from 3-6pm mon-thur and fridays 3-5 Can't beat that!"}
{"text":"The ambiance of this location is what you'd expect of Summerlin. It's a cool, hip and more trendy vibe. Service is on and portions seem a bit bigger.
We came here a couple months back with a large crowd. We ordered the sangria pitcher which was very potent but very good. We love the complimentary toast with honey almond butter & green olives which were set down immediately after we were seated. Ordered our favorites like bacon wrapped stuffed dates (get a few of these because they go fast), artichoke toast (love the creamy garlic sauce and grilled artichoke), manchego mac & cheese (comfort food) big bowl of pasta (which is like angel hair pomodoro with vegetables), tuna tartare & taro chips (perfectly fresh & good portion), albondigas (a little dry), the empanadas (were ok).
For what seemed like a lot of food & multiple orders, plus sangrias & other alcohol, we were very surprised with the reasonable bill. Fireflies is definitely our goto spot for tapas."}
{"text":"2 stars for this location, 4 stars for other locations. Fireflies is the best tapas place but service, portion and quality do vary between locations.
Summerlin has the best vibe, great portions, good service, Anthem has great service, decent portions and beautiful view. This Paradise location's service ranks last. Our server did not bother to check on us once, refill a water glass or even come around to bring us the bill. The bacon stuffed dates came out with raw fatty bacon, we had to flag down the server & ask him to please cook them more. He came back with burnt black bacon :/ Fortunately we had a very nice buser that did all the work and helped salvage our experience. The artichoke toasts were on crouton sized toast and hardly any garlic sauce, the tuna tartare taro chips were hard & undercooked. And pasta was drowning in tomato paste. Sad how poor management can ruin a location. I think this location was also featured on one of those restaurant stakeout episodes and didn't do too well. Guess they didn't learn much from that experience."}
{"text":"Swanky food in DOWNTOWN??!!!  Yes, yes, YEEEESSS!!  When Maounds suggested this place for dinner, I was skeptical at first.  A nice restaurant in The Plaza?  Are you sure?  But I trust her (and her palate) so I went with it.  Man, oh, MAN, I am glad I did!

The decor is super sexy.  A giant wall of window looks out onto Fremont Street, so if you hit it at the right time, you can see the light show.  The lighting in the restaurant is dark and sultry.  It was very modern with clean lines and dark wood too.  You would swear you are not Downtown at all.

The food was incredible.  Everything is tapas style so you can have a bite of everything (or hog a couple of plates just for yourself, like I did).  I had the tomato basil soup with grilled cheese (BRIE!) and the ham and cheese croquettes.  The soup was delicious, as was the grilled cheese (though the bread was a little too soft and flakey for my taste) and the ham and cheese croquettes were incredible (but share these because they are rich and you don't want to over-do it).  I only drank beer since I did not want to mix my liquor for the night.

My boyfriend had the thai beef salad and he really, really liked it.  Generally he like potatoes with his meat, so I was surprised it got such rave reviews.  He also raved about the sliders with the bleu cheese (and he is no bleu cheese fan at all).  Maounds had the bacon wrapped dates and something else, all of which she loved.  She also had a carmel apple martini and she is not one to normally drink the frou frou cocktails.  You know how to make people want to come out of their comfort zone, Firefly.  That is a sign of a great restaurant!

Next time I am Vegas, I will definitely be back here!  I cannot WAIT!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty cool for tapas. They have A LOT of small dishes and I liked how they make their own sangria, and on the menu it says they marinate it for 3 days. it was pretty refreshing and delicious. I came with a large party so it was a little difficult to get full since everything is small plates. Some of my favorites were the tuna tartare, thai beef salad, skewers, and the big bowl of chicken salad. Also since we were still hungry we ordered the herb roasted chicken which came with fries and devoured it."}
{"text":"Awesome spot and food made fast! Ahi tuna, Lamb Chops, Firefly Fries. All were great and cant wait to come back for the whole menu."}
{"text":"Awesome! Be sure to go with a group so more plate can be ordered & tried. My group thoroughly enjoyed all our dishes, especially the bacon wrapped dates!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at Firefly while visiting Las Vegas and I will definitely be back. The highlight was the Mixed Paella which had seafood l, chorizo sausage and chicken and it was very flavorful and filling. It was enough for our party of four to share. Keep in mind that everything is served tapa style. We also ordered the Red Sangria which was delicious! We got a pitcher of the Sangria at happy hour which ends at 6pm. Some of the other tapas we had were the Scallops Escargot Style, Bacon Wrapped Dates, Calamari and Empanadas with Pork. I can't complain about anything we ordered. Service was excellent and we even got a free photo post card given to us!"}
{"text":"This is a great tapas/Spanish-y place and I'm not really a tapas person, but almost everything I tried here was dee-lish.

They have full-fledged meals too, I got the paella 'cause I wasn't really in the mood for sharing. It wasn't all that great as I didn't like how the rice was burnt onto the pan - Samantha Brown says that's the best part but for me, NA-DA. The flavours didn't pop up in my mouth like other paellas I've had and it should SORTA taste like Chicken Tikka Masala mixed with Jambalaya and Uncle Ben's Spanish-style rice, SORTA. Okay I have a fucked up palate.

Scanning around, this seems more like an industry hangout. It was bustling the night we were there.

Came here to celebrate a birthday and tried almost everything. I was really digging the stuffed dates (everyone loves them!) and chicken skewers. They also have some really refreshing and sweet  sangria (heavenly) and mojitos in pitchers; I didn't know mojitos could be pitcher-friendly and it was enough to get me fucked up before going to the club and that's not really a good thing, haha. Service was prompt and courteous, just how every restaurant should be. 

Only con is parking is a pain, but it is to be expected for a hangout hotspot.

Had an unforgettable dining experience with my cocktail waitress \"friends\" (who by the way complain about working 3 fucking jobs and not pulling in enough tips to keep up with their pseudo-wealthy lifestyles.........stupid showoff sluts) in a lively atmosphere and I end this with a \"I would come back.\" :-)

Screw the paella."}
{"text":"I was suggested this restaurant by some fellow Phoenix yelpers.  They got it right once again.  My husband and I called ahead to find out there was a 20-30 minute wait on that particular Saturday night.  We arrived and the place was jumpin'!  It gives off the vibe of a very hip and trendy spot with dim lights and loud voices.  We waited outside for 10-15 minutes watching all of the too-cool guys who tried too hard to look like they didn't try and barely 20 year old girls with dresses that barely cover.

We were seated and started making some drink choices - red sangria for me (too many mentions not to!) and a diet coke for him.  I didn't care for it at first, but then like the others said, it goes down just like water.  I think next time I would try one of the mojitos.  For dinner we ordered the manchego mac n' cheese (delicious and rich), terra y mare skewers (very good), and shrimp tempura (good).  For dessert we ate the gelato trio with chocolate, vanilla, and pistachio (yum!) and lemon berry mini tarts (very tasty).  Our bill for three tapas, two desserts, two drinks, tax and tip was about $50

Overall the food was tasty and had a very large selection, service was good, and atmosphere was just too loud - we almost had to yell to hear each other.  Maybe next time I would ask for seating on the patio or make reservations.  They accept reservations over the phone and online.  I will definitely be back again to try more menu items, desserts, and drinks!"}

{"text":"This place has delish Tapas!  My personal favs are: firefly fries, MANCHEGO MAC N CHEESE, roasted eggplant cannelloni, and baked brie (w/o the chorizo).  And they have awesome sangria!!

my only gripe with them is that have made their proportions smaller, which is annoying.  But its still good, and worth the trip down there.  Its a fun, loud place with great food!"}
{"text":"We arrived around opening time and made a reservation for an empty restaurant haha.  The server was super nice and answered all our questions.  We still must have ordered wrong or ordered why too much food because half way through the meal I felt super gross and greasy.  Most everything was good but super rich.  We could have gone with less dishes recommended by the server."}
{"text":"When in Las Vegas this place is a must.  We never come to Vegas without a trip to this Firefly.  I didn't think the place could get better until we had Patrick as our server.  Sometimes the menu can be overwhelming.   Patrick assisted us with our food and beverage selections making outstanding recommendations on both fronts.  His  food and drink pairing suggestions were excellent. The almond stuffed bacon wrapped dates should not be missed.  Best to order one for each person to avoid a brawl."}
{"text":"We had a friend in town and opted for the way off strip location.  It was not busy at all which was great for conversation.  

It was nice because they had a brunch menu so the picky eater was able to get breakfast food.  Highly recommend the pumpkin beignets!  As usual, everything we ordered was awesome.

We had a table full of delicious goodies to share.  The service was nice, they left us alone to visit and didn't interrupt unnecessarily.  

We love bringing out of towners to Firefly!"}
{"text":"I tried Firefly for the first time 6 years ago, and since then, I have always made it a point to visit every time that I am in Vegas because it is my favorite tapas restaurant, better than any others that I have visited (mostly in SoCal), and possibly my favorite restaurant in Vegas thus far (though I have recently found a couple of solid contenders). Anyway, the tapas, the drinks, and the dessert are all fabulous. You really cannot go wrong with whatever you pick, particularly because you can do family style and if a dish is not your favorite, someone else is bound to enjoy it. My favorite items are the stuffed peppers, the patatas bravas, the bacon wrapped dates, and the chocolate tres leches cake. Aside from the food, the ambiance is great, with a bit of a classy romantic flair, the service is good, and the valet parking is free."}
{"text":"Have you ever been hungry after work and gone to a local restaurant you have previously had a great experience with looking to pickup your day, only to be disappointed?

I've been here several times, with pretty good experiences, however this time I ordered take out, and was severely disappointed. To start the food was not ready 20 minutes later when I went to pick it up, the teenaged receptionist seemed out of touch and ambivalent about my order, another inquiry 10 minutes later, and I get \"it will be up soon, just waiting for the steak\". Another 5 minutes and I ask for the manager seeing it's now been over 35 minutes, and they could have started cooking the food when I arrived and it should be ready by now. Another 10 minutes no manager, but the food comes out and seems to be hot. Get home, food is not to order, despite all the time wasted.

While this used to be a go to place, it seems understaffed, management does not care (half full restaurant btw), and service level sucks (did not even order the paella, which takes 30 minutes). I'm done with this place and would not recommend it (despite previous reviews).

Please see my review record to confirm I'm usually a pretty positive person."}
{"text":"My friend brought me here, claiming it's the best place for tapas. Having only had tapas once and not walking in with a good impression, I was really impressed.

Their portion sizes are really generous. The food was great. The mushroom tart was my favorite, with the the fries coming in a close second along with the burgers. 

I recommend going early since I'm told that it gets really packed at night. And 2-3 tapas is more than enough for one person.

I've been wanting to drive back to Vegas just to come here!"}
{"text":"Love the food here . We have been planning to come here for so long and we finally got to try it . All the food and drink selections are amazing ! 
Service was great and we would come back again !"}
{"text":"This was one of the best meals I have eaten in Vegas. It is perfectly portioned and the food tasted great too. Even the mojitos were good."}
{"text":"Just come for the vodka infused shots. So good. I can't believe I haven't gone here before.  The food is amazing. You can't go wrong with bacon dates. The beet salad was scrumptious. I love that its off the strip a bit, so it's not too crazy. The garlic butter for the bread is amazing. 
A great date place or after work place to try and share small plates. 

They do like putting blue cheese on everything. Again just come for the vodka infused shots. :)"}
{"text":"love everything about this place EXCEPT the music and crowd can be quite loud at times. tapas and sangria's always amount to a great night. love love love that the month of July is half off sangria's."}
{"text":"OMG. This place is rad. Get a little bit of everything--I don't think you could go wrong with anything on the menu. Good drinks, too!"}
{"text":"\" I THROW MY HANDS UP IN THE AIR SOMETIMES, SAYING AA-OOOOOOOO\"

\"CAUSE WE GON' LIGHT IT UP- LIKE IT'S DYNAMITEEEEE\"

Fellow friends and Yelpers including Francis C. and Christine G. were eagerly waiting for this song to be played at this fancy Tapas bar... but unfortunately, the crowd may have been too old for us (eeks... did I just say that?)  I was sad that the sounds of Taio Cruz weren't blasting this evening, but for a night out with small bites and good drinks, Firefly is sure to provide!

Located in downtown Vegas right across from Fremont Street, Firefly offers up a clubbey/lounge area for party goers that want to avoid the crowdedness of the Strip.  Firefly gets extremely busy, so I highly recommend making a reservation before hand.  The management allows a ten minute grace period from your reservation, but try not to be late.  Once inside, we were impressed by the luxurious environment we were placed in.  We were on the second floor of the building, giving you a glimpse of Fremont Street and a cool view of the lights surrounding Sin City.

Once again, you won't be dancing your drunk butts off at Firefly, but you'll be enjoying a chill, fun night out.  For those that don't know, Tapas bars provide small bites and big drinks.  Everything on the menu is made for either 1-2 people, so if you are hungry, this may not be the best place to go because it can add up.  However, we came for some light food, and for the amazing Sangria they have here.  Our waitress was very sweet in giving us recommendations on foods and drinks, and was fun to chat with throughout the night.  They also have a worker going around taking photos of your party, which you can pick up afterwards.  So for service and ambience, it's not bad so far.

On to the food options.  I tried the following:

Sangria [$24 for pitcher] - Worth it!  This was absolutely delicious and makes a great, sweet drink to wash down the food that you'll be eating with it.

Dates Wrapped In Bacon [$6] - You get five pieces of these little suckers.  They were mad delicious!  The bacon was crispy, and the juices infused with the hot dates made a remarkable explosion of tastes in my mouth.

Skewered Steak [$10] - Two skewers of marinated meat that goes extremely well with the free bread provided.  Definitely get them more on the rare side because they were extremely tender... so good!
There are many things to try here, so feel free to experiment and find what flavors suit you the best.  For my first tapas bar experience, this was definitely not bad.  If there was a dance floor inside and cheaper drinks, life would be perfect.

Parking can be hard, but my friends and I parked at the California Hotel.  It's free, and you just need to get your ticket self validated.  It works!"}
{"text":"Very delicious meal and great serving size. I mean of course the size is small but I order three different dishes and I was full after two. If anything you mite want to eat slow and order some drinks. 
I definitely think the bacon wrapped dates were ridiculously good. But I won't just recommend any certain dish just because everything is good"}
{"text":"my boyfriend's cousin brought us here when we visited in may/june right before we hit the clubs. the food is amazing. i love mushrooms and the mushroom tart was GREAT! i can't wait to eat here again.

although it does get a bit crowded. there were tables outside too and we were right next to the door and everytime the waiter went out the door, a gush of hot wind blew in. all in all the food was bomb."}
{"text":"I'm still a fan of Firefly, but for some reason I think this place is beginning to rub me the wrong way. Maybe it's because when they had their place downtown I really enjoyed going there over going to the Paradise location and now I'm forced to go to the Paradise location because the downtown location closed.

I went here last night and shared Sangrias with a group of friends and also ordered some ceviche. My boyfriend had never been here before and he didn't seem too impressed. He (and I) were incredibly annoyed by the very, very loud group of girls to the right of us. We were seated in the front part of the restaurant in the couch area and they were directly to the right of us. At times I couldn't even hear my boyfriend and he was sitting right next to me. Good luck trying to hear the other people in my party.

The sangria was good, our waiter was attentive and nice. The atmosphere is the same 'ol. Maybe I'm just ready to move on to a new place..."}
{"text":"My friend David obrought me here this place it was amazing irina was our server and the food was so tasty"}
{"text":"This place is delicious! We dined here with a party of six so we were able to sample a lot of of different dishes. The favorites were the bacon wrapped dates with blue cheese (need I say more?), the tuna tartare, and flash fried peppers. We also had the filet mignon sliders, the stuffed mushrooms, and grilled shrimp. It was all very good. We also shared a carafe of sangria, although some in our group did not like the sangria, so we also ordered a bottle of wine. We did not have room for dessert, so I will have to go back for that. And the price was right, I think our bill was $200 for 6 of us!"}
{"text":"This place is dynamite son!

I had pretty much the whole menu since I came with a big party and everything, I mean everything, was fire.  Best of the best in Las Vegas so far.  I will make this spot a stop in my list for every trip I take to Vegas.  The sangria was also really good.  I have no idea what kind of butter they serve with their side bread but I gained 10lbs just eating that junk.  ooo weeee 5 Stars all the way!  Great service too."}
{"text":"Must must must stop when you are in Vegas!! I could eat there every night for 2 weeks and never eat the same thing that's how good this menu is. Have been there several times and continue to go back. Friendly staff good service. Don't miss this place!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"OMG ... everything about this place was on point!!

I had bookmarked this for my trip to the Sin City and looking forward to it, so I was concerned that my expectations would be so high that I might be let down.  Um, negative.  We took a cab over to Paradise and have found our new favorite restaurant in Vegas!

From the ambiance, dark and trendy, to the food, rich and delicious, this place did not miss a beat.  The mac n' cheese is a must if you love mac!  And the stuffed dates ... om nom nom.  

We didn't have any issues catching a cab back either, as the hostess station was accommodating with this, too. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were looking for something a little cheaper than all the fancy and expensive options in the Strip. A friend referred us to this place and I'm glad she did! We came for dinner and luckily had reservations, the place was PACKED. We ordered 4-5 tapas to split. Each was served one at a time and came right on time. Service was exceptional. Only complaint is that it was very loud inside, sort of dark, and the tables are very close together. would definitely recommend to a friend."}
{"text":"This is the second time that I have come here and I love it!! First time was during lunch time and this time for dinner for 11 girls for my bachelorette!

Please order the  mojitos when you go there. Just the regular one or the mango one. The raspberry one was just \"eh\".  Order a pitcher, cuz you get more for your money and trust me, you will want more than one mojito!!

Food came out fast and fresh, but my stomach was going through some trauma after a full night of drinking, fat tuesdays, and denny's @ 5am, that I just had no appetite. Only the mojitos and few bites of whatever kept me sane.

Just off the strip and a short cab ride and you will be in Tapas heaven!"}
{"text":"This place is HYPE. 


 Sorry to all my fellow yelpers who gave them solid 4's and 5 but the dishes sound A WHOLE LOT better on paper than executed!

  So we were on our way to Capriottis and I told PIC to make a U-turn and please lets go to Firefly LOL.  So we came in before the lunch rush. Place is cute nothing toooo special. Service was good. Scaled the menu and again I want it all LOL! So we order a few things. The goat cheese stuffed peppers. They were ok but not even close to Jaleos version of it. The empanadas were for the PIC, they were good but I wasn't focused on that. The albondias wasn't a soup but a plate of meatballs in some red sauce. The came out lukewarm not even hot. I hate that shit because I rarely get borderline cold food! But that ruined my favorite latin dish! The mushroom puff pastry dish was HUGE, way to big. I wish they detailed that on the menu! It was AOK Just to large and didn't go with the theme of the eatery to me! The favorite dish of the lunch was the shrimp tempura. The veggies that were also tempura were BOMB. The carrots so damn good. I could eat a whole plate of those carrots! 

 I might comeback here if I was with a bunch of gfs in Vegas wanting something off the grid a bit!  But yea this is hype to me. SOWEE"}
{"text":"OK, wanted to have a nice night out with my wife while in Vegas.  Too many choices of high end restaurants.  Settled on Firefly based on tapas style, and location for FSE.  Had been in once years ago when it was something else but did not eat.
Got A TON of food.  Will only mention a few.
Stuffed dates: mentioned in other reviews are as good as everyone says.  5 in an order, could have eaten 50.  
Eggplant canneloni: which was thin eggplant filets wrapped around goat cheese.  Awesome.
Skewers of chorizo, filet, and shrimp with salsa verde:  Incredible.
Calamari: average.  I am really not sure why I even ordered this.
Stuffed peppers: just OK. sauce was canned.

We LOVED most of the food.  Service was not stellar but certainly not bad.  Had a couple Estrellas to drink.  Got out for under 100 bucks and we were both stuffed like the dates.  I think this is a place where you have to have a little knowledge of the food.  A couple things were just ok...menu filler.  Waiter's choices were All on the money.

Not only would I go back, I wish I could go tonight.

Complaints about the china?  Who cares.  Food is good or great, tapas are fun, location is excellent and the price is right."}
{"text":"The ham and cheese croquetas are delicious!! We go often. Good food and reasonable prices. Their mixed paella is a must try."}
{"text":"Great food, fast and pleasant service! will definitely be going back! perfect for a date night or a double date"}
{"text":"Went to Firefly yesterday to celebrate.

The food were delicious but the service was not great. The lady that served us brought us the wrong order, twice. When we told her we didn't order the first one, she gave us an attitude and insisted that we did order it. We originally ordered stuffed mushrooms but changed our order to mushroom tart when she told us that the dish I wanted on the picture was actually the mushroom tart- not the stuffed mushrooms. We ended up with two mushroom dishes. The stuffed mushroom was mediocre but the mushroom tart was superb! I didn't want to make a big deal out of it (although my boyfriend was a little frustrated.) 

Later on, she gave us the wrong order... again. We ordered baked tetilla and got something completely different (I don't remember the name). We couldn't  eat because it was too spicy and frankly, it didn't taste good. My boyfriend was very upset. We ended up paying for food we didn't want and can't even eat because our waitress was not paying attention. She should start writing down the orders and repeating them back to customers to avoid messing up orders in the future. She caused us money that we did not want to spend. 

The garlic bread was chewy, but everything else was great! The baked scallops were delicious. The petite filet was juicy and cooked perfectly (medium rare.) The red sangria and the pina colada were both awsome!

If it wasn't for the messed up orders, I would give this place 5 stars."}
{"text":"Good drink prices even if its not happy hour. Their sangria's are delicious! Amazing food...at least what i ordered was yummy....a Vegas hot spot! Loved it definitely will go again soon!"}
{"text":"Wow! What a fantastic dining experience. We went here for the first time last weekend with my brother and sister-in-law and learned first-hand exactly why it is one of their favorite place to dine in Las Vegas. The food was stellar and the service prompt and friendly. This was my first tapas experience and I fear it may have spoiled me for anywhere else. 

Since there were five of us and we all shared our selections with the rest of the group, I got to taste a wide variety of their menu offerings. It is hard to pick a favorite because everything was delicious, but I think I'd have to go with the stuffed dates if pressed to only pick one. I only had the white sangria but it was so superb I can't imagine the other sangria offerings would not be as well-crafted and delicious as the white."}
{"text":"My wedding party ate here after the wedding and this place knocked it out of the park!  The tapa's plates were nothing short of incredible.  Having 12 different people order different plates made it a smorgasbord of incredible diverse tasting foods.  The tuna tartar with sesame was to die for, smoked salmon on tiny bagels was divine.  I don't think a single plate was over $10.  Service was nothing short of exceptional and very patient with our guests that needed help with the tapas philosophy.  Eat here when in Vegas!!!"}
{"text":"I made a last minute decision to come here for dinner before going to see Vegas! The Show everything was really good! I started with the shrimp cieviche followed by the summer vegetables & stuffed mushrooms. I really liked the ambiance too very inviting & seems nice for a date just hanging with friends."}
{"text":"My favorite meal yet in vegas:) I could have thrown a dart blindfolded at the menu and fully trusted that I would receive an interesting and delicious culinary success. 

The meal is well paced and the servers are efficient (you get what you pay for). Only drawback? I was there on a Thursday and it was PACKED and very loud. 

Also, free valet;)"}
{"text":"The value for the price we paid was great.  The food is good, maybe slightly above average.  

We ordered calamari, eggplant roll ups, mac and cheese, scallops, ham croquetas, salad.  

The calamari was good, not greasy, rings and tentacles..sauce was served.  The salad was good, but as I write this, I can't remember what was in it so it was not memorable.  But I do remember that I loved the salad dressing (vinaigrette of some sort).  My husband liked the croquetas, but croquetas are not my favorite thing, I'm not fond of the gooey center.  

The scallops had some sort of burnt taste to them.  Kind of reminded me of burnt garlic.  They were cooked well, but ruined by that burnt garlic taste.  Maybe something stuck to the grill and then stuck to the scallops.  I find that inexcusable.  

Eggplant roll ups were quite tasty, I wish the portion was larger, or we ordered another plate.  Eggplant with goat cheese, and very little tomato sauce.  Over all good.

The mac and cheese was made with manchego cheese.  I think manchego is best eaten on its own, or with fruit.  I didn't like the mac and cheese, but I think that's my personal taste and not the dish served here.  I like mac and cheese more traditional and creamy.  Again, just an opinion, not a knock against the restaurant.  

I'd go back to try other dishes, but I think I'm spoiled with previous experiences at other, authentic Spanish Tapas Restaurants.  For example, Emilio's in Hillside, IL."}
{"text":"Firefly is a Spanish tapas restaurant that recently opened a second location in the Plaza Hotel at the West end of Fremont Street. The food here is reasonably priced, fairly consistent, always tasty, and it is the perfect spot for a light bite with a neon view. I wish there were more tapas restaurants in town, as I believe they are the wave of the future in American dining. In this respect, Firefly is on the right track.

Where they are on the wrong track is with the service. I have never had a good experience with servers here as it always takes forever to place an order, or to grab your waiter anytime thereafter. It is just poorly managed. On this particular night my brother and I sat at the bar and it took us a good ten minutes to order a drink, even though the bartender was right there. He decided it would be best to finish up the drink order for a party of ten before making our two little drinks, one of which was a bottle of beer. Isn't that the first rule of any service industry? Prioritize the people in front of you before those out of sight, especially when their requests are quick. After he was done chitchatting with the servers standing around waiting for him to finish drinks rather than tending to their tables, he eventually got around to us. He didn't even look at us while taking our food order but just stood in front of the computer as we shouted it to him and he entered it in. I wish this weren't indicative of the regular service at Firefly but that's pretty much how it's been for me every time.

Once you do grab your waiter's attention, the food generally comes out quickly and you generally get what you ordered. Plus, it's really tasty so you begin to forget about the people who brought it to you. The first thing we had were the bacon-wrapped, almond stuffed dates ($4) in red wine reduction with bleu cheese crumbles, which I have to get every time I come. They are sweet, savory, crunchy, and squishy, which makes for a happy mouth (even my brother who is allergic to nuts orders them and simply removes the almond). I especially like that they are not too large to consume in a single bite. The dates were followed by the stuffed peppers, mac n' cheese, steak skewers, and roasted eggplant cannoli. The peppers ($7.50) were OK, but the more satisfying vegetarian option was the eggplant ($5), not only because of price but because the cheese inside was creamy and herbaceous rather than somewhat tough and bland. They come with the same yummy tomato sauce so you won't miss anything with the eggplant. The steak skewers ($7.50) are a good deal, and the accompanying sauces are good, but the presentation needs some work. Finally, you can't go wrong with the mac n' cheese ($8). It's one of the more expensive tapas options but the portion is fairly large and it's baked to an appetizing golden brown. The cheese can be a little gritty on occasion but it's still hard to go wrong with cheese and pasta. Another favorite we didn't order tonight are the sliders with fried onions and spicy aoli. They are filling but delicious!

All in all, Firefly is a perfectly frugal place to get good versions of your favorite foods. Nothing will blow your mind but you will leave content in the fact that you haven't spent a fortune and your belly doesn't feel as stuffed as the dates. Oh, and well drinks are only $5, which actually is pretty mind blowing come to think of it."}
{"text":"A friend of my good friend recommended this place while we were having a girls weekend in Vegas. I've never been to a tappas restaurant and I was so glad this place was my first. It has such a great atmosphere and a perfect place to have dinner & drinks with your girls. We actually went here after watching Sex in the City with my friends and it was perfect!! The sangria is AMAZING, love all their dishes, and we tasted about 8-10...and their dessert, was off the hook! We tried the chocolate tres leches and their chocholate w/ banana dish, yummy! If you're ever in Vegas, I highly recommend trying this place, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Firefly is my absolute favorite tapas restaurant in town.  Took my family here while they were in town and they loved they experience just as much as I always do.  We all have our favorite dishes but some of our faves were the ham croquettas, baked Brie, stuffed dates and Serrano sliders.  The sparkling sangria is also fabulous.  Great social restaurant to enjoy small bites with friends, family or a date!"}
{"text":"One of the best Tapas restaurants ever!

You must try the ceviche, beef thai salad, roasted eggplant cannelloni, steak and mushroom skewers.  And the paella was filled with many mussels, clams, shrimp, chicken and sausage!  All of the dishes were so delish!  We also had a pitcher of sangria ... which was marinated for 3 days!

Firefly's a must!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food and staff. Been here twice now and will come back every visit to Vegas."}
{"text":"This is the second Firefly location that I have visited. The first one was downtown which has a spectacular view but it's too hectic for me. When I go out to eat I like to relax and enjoy good conversation over tasty food. The Sahara location had music playing in the back round ....but it's not too loud. She Will Be Loved by Maroon 5 was on during the meal which helped me relax even more because I do like that song. 

The interior is done in a nice red and they have this huge fireplace that's on the left as you walk in. It gives off a homey feeling in a \"From Dusk Till Dawn\" kind of way. It's not because Selma Hayek comes out and dances with a big yellow snake either... I think it's because of the picture hanging above the fireplace. I didn't have my glasses on but it looked like a skeleton of a male Flamenco dancer. It just gave me that vibe but it was cool....I liked it. 

The service was very good and we didn't feel rushed even though they were closing in an hour. My husband and I ordered a couple of tapas to share. I started out with the Tomato Basil Soup that came with a mini grilled Brie sandwich. I'm sensitive to salt so it was a little too salty for me. My husband who is a bread and cheese lover didn't like the grilled sandwich so for us that was a miss. We also ordered a Beef Thai Salad which was delicious. The meat was very tender and had some kick to it! Our last non sweet dish was the Filet Mignon sliders. It had ham, crumples of cabrales cheese and onions on the side. The cheese had a very sharp taste but it was still very good. We polished off our mini meals with Banana Nutella Sandwiches per recommendation from our waiter. He knew what he was talking about! I wish I ordered it with some ice cold milk. 

I think this is a nice cozy place to grab a bite to eat whether you are on a date or hanging out with a bunch of friends."}
{"text":"Just say no. The food was aweful! Atmosphere was trying but LACKING!

I will say my friend hadn't had Spanish tapas ever and thought it was okay, not great though."}
{"text":"Great food, great service. need I say more? Try the stuffed dates and chicken/chorizo stuffed mushrooms.  Tasty!"}
{"text":"FAST_VIEW: friendly atmosphere, tasty food, fast service but can easily break the bank.

pros: every dish was solid, vodka shots were infused with flavor and delight!

cons: every dish was expensive and not particularly outstanding. simply solid. list of items can be overwhelming

getting here before 5 will beat the crowd on a weekend, which is quite large! by the time we left, a mob had formed a line outside. we were surprised.

here's what we ordered: scallops, empanada, eggplant, & a vodka shot which amounted to about $30. that's not too bad if you think about it.

here's the problem: that was probably enough food for a 10 year old. ah he can have a shot, its chocolate, lychee, strawberry infused! delightful!

the scallops were flavorful!! but seriously tasted like 2 and a half scallops. empanada was tasty but you pay a hefty price for ONE, sliced in half so we actually thought there were 2 at first. the eggplant with goat cheese was tasty but also small. i completely understand this is a tapas place and we appreciated the portion sizes actually. my girlfriend and i tend to share every meal, but at $6-$12 a dish, even with our light appetites we would've had to spend $70 to be just full. i imagine the people with normal appetites.

so while this place is tasty, i think i'd only come back for the vodka shots. and i'd like to try those filet mignon sliders yelpers have been raving about. ;)"}
{"text":"Excellent, excellent!!!! Great service, great food and fabulous atmosphere. Me and some friends met here afterwork even on a Thursday the place was packed but it was comfortable and you could hear yourself talk without yelling. The good and drinks were reasonably priced and worth every penny. I will definitely come here again."}
{"text":"You know I do love tapas. Ever since Cha Cha Cha in SF, I've been crazy for tapas. After the many good reviews from Firefly, I came here with two friends to try it out. We wanted to order everything but tried to limit it to what we could eat. So we ordered:

Lobster Escargot. A little on the mushy side. Portion is small. I'm warning you now so that you don't have a shock face like I did when I saw it. There's about five pieces. Good start to the food though.

Filet Mignon Sliders. This was good. The filet mignon was cooked perfectly. Slight pink on the inside and juicy. There was also crispy onions on the side and along with two sliders. The aioli in the slider was a definite ingredient that separated Firefly's sliders from other places. 

Stuffed Mushroom. Chicken was a bit dry but I like mushrooms so I'm getting it anyways. Came in four pieces.

Camarones Al Ajillo. About 6 medium sized shrimps and one hell of an amazing sauce. The shrimps were not mushy. The sauce went perfect with the bread given. Got to impress me with sauce when I go to tapas eateries.

Along with our $30 pitcher of watermelon mojito which had Bacardi rum in it yet did not taste as strong as I thought it would, My friends and I were still a bit hungry. So we went and order the Paella. Not the best I've had. The rice a bit overcooked but the ingredients in here is absolutely worth your money. The seafood were plentiful and more than the average selection at other restaurants. 

Our total bill was about $90. We were full after for our party of 3. The restaurant is not too big and it's off the strip of Las Vegas. However, very much worth coming. Service was attentive, had no problem with it. It's located in a plaza so there is also lots of parking."}
{"text":"We came here full of expectation, but the whole experience was a disappointment. We were seated at a side table. The place is loud even it wasn't full. The tables are close to each other.
We had a hard time picking and the waiter didn't know what to recommend, felt like he was randomly saying dishes.
We picked a few and they were all pretty tasteless and small portions. None stood out and we were disappointed with the food. 
We had the eggplant with goat cheese, escargot like dish (please stick to escargots, this made no sense), tuna with chips and another I don't even remember. The stars are for the tuna as that was really good but nothing that blew me away.
Won't be back."}
{"text":"Found this location from a random website as my boyfriend and I were looking for good eats in Vegas. Firefly is simply the best near-strip restaurant.  

The only downside: a lot of people know about this place and there's always a wait. 

The menu is HUGE and I've yet to try something that I didn't like.  I few suggestions that I enjoyed a lot: the bacon wrapped stuffed dates are a must try, along with the tuna tartar; almost one of the best I've ever had.  The LOBSTER \"ESCARGOTS\"[KNOBS OF LOBSTER TAIL BAKED IN GARLIC-HERB BUTTER] are amazing & cooked so perfectly, and big enough to share.  

Other suggestions include the Thai beef salad and shrimp ceviche, stuffed pepper, mac n cheese, baked talapia, and the mergeuz.  Don't fill up on the entrees too much, because the tres leches cake is probably the best thing on the menu, so save room for dessert.  

Over-all this is a great little local tapas restaurant with good food, good service & decent prices."}
{"text":"So much fun! This was my first time here, and I'm glad my friend made a reservation because this place was packed! I enjoyed the white sangria more than the red, but both were good. I'm told the champagne sangria is great and I will probably get it next time. I came here with my husband and 5 friends, this place is great for a group, because you can try many of there tapas this way. The bacon wrapped dates were my husband's favorite, and the group as a whole. I really loved the apple manchego salad, it was surprising how much I enjoyed it. It was so fresh, crisp, and nutty. I will definitely get it next time. The filet was delicious, I thought the Mac n cheese was just ok. The mushroom pastries were lightly crispy, but the saucy mushrooms on top we're just ok. Calamari good, stuffed peppers yummy. Padron peppers that were flash fried were a table favorite, I thought they were good but I might have enjoyed them more with more lemon. Was impressed with the stuffed mushrooms which was disappointing. The heirloom tomato salad wasn't very good. The butter lettuce, vinagrette, and tomatoes were yummy, but the creamy cheese they slathered on top was just too much. It overwhelmed the dish and ruined it for me. All in all I'm extremely excited to go back. I will definitely be getting Sangria (get the pitcher), filet, apple salad, dates, and stuffed red peppers again. Hopefully I'll leave some room to try some new things and dessert! 
I took away a star because our waitress was kind of snobby, and seemed to be in a \"wish I was anywhere but here\" kind of mood. I'm assuming because we were in a group, they automatically added gratuity, and I don't think she was very deserving of it. Having been a waitress, I completely understand adding gratuity to parties (I wish they did that when I worked at Applebee's'), but I feel that some waiters take advantage of that and slack on service. I will return though!"}
{"text":"I've had this restaurant on my Vegas Places to Eat List for a very long time! We're so happy to finally make it out on our last trip last month.

It's dark, loud, intimately-cozy, lots of great food to share with our friends. Everything from the pitcher of the yummy white sangria to the bacon wrapped stuffed dates and lobster escargots were awesome!  It was a fun tapas style dinner before a long night ahead. Our waiter was spot on and terrific. 

We'll be back again.....Thank you! Cheers!

TIP: Make a reservation! It gets packed for dinner. We used the Yelp Open Table link and got right in."}
{"text":"Even though it was a hot summer night, my friend and I decided to sit out on their patio. I actually preferred the patio: it was much more laid-back and quieter outside, so we could hear each other talk. 

Sangrias were refreshing and tasty, and kept us parched. 

We ordered calamari, shrimp ceviche, spicy potatoes, and some kind of mushroom pastry. Everything we had was absolutely yummy. Their calamari was spot on delicious, but that mushroom puff pastry was spectacular. 

It's nice eating off the Strip occasionally, so definitely make the trip away from the chaos to have some tapas, sip some sangria, and take a break from the madness."}
{"text":"This is our go to spot for lunch on this side of town. Love the Apple Manchego Salad! My absolute favorite! Flavors of sour apple and rich cheese blend magnificently, and sliced ever so perfectly. This is a must, EVERY TIME!!!!!!
Some other favorites are the meatballs, the firefly fries, firefly fish sticks, and the lamb chops.
I actually have never had a tapas plate that was bad here. This is great for almost any occasion and any taste bud. Love Firefly!!!!"}
{"text":"I think the one on the westside is much better. We went for lunch on a Sunday to the Paradise location and it wasn't too busy. We had somewhat slow service but the stuffed dates and apple and manchego salad didn't disappoint.  Some to the fried plates were a bit cold and the last item we ordered took way too much time to come out. When it did, it was so hot as to approach a meltdown and so we waited nearly 15 minutes for it to be safe to eat.

I still like this place and it is the best Tapas restaurant in town."}
{"text":"This was a great choice to dine. The food is great and the staff is attentive and very pleasant. They have really good selections on the menu I don't get back home in Memphis.   The atmosphere and music really enjoyable. I would give it 5 except for noise from patrons; some at the bar are extremely loud and practically screaming. Otherwise, I love this place."}
{"text":"I LOVE this local favorite restaurant.  I want to try every single tapas.  The 1/2 off HH drink is good deal.

During HH, the waiters and waitress come clean plates very often.  Just so you know, there are others waiting.

Fair priced and Good food"}
{"text":"We had a large party that was split into multiple tables. Took a real long time for orders to be taken. Plates were delivered haphazardly. When everyone had been served, I asked where my tapas were?  Turned out they'd been delivered to our other table quite some time prior.  Staff wasn't organized, very loud environment. Food when delivered was good. Pricing good."}
{"text":"Visiting from Chicago, I was excited to give this tapas place a try. I came in with a party of 12 or so not too long ago and was pleasantly surprised at the array of choices of their tapas menu along with the option of choosing entrees instead if tapas is not your thing.  The staff was very friendly and accommodating to our large group-  points for that! 

For drinks I tried a blood orange mojito- very good and strong- another plus. Tried their sangria, equally good.

For food, I opted to share the shrimp ceviche with a friend and ordered the machengo mac n' cheese and filet mignon sliders for myself. Out of the three I would have to say I enjoyed the ceviche the most. The sliders were a bit over cooked and although my friends all raved about the mac and cheese, mine failed to impress. It seemed as though the cheese in mine had coagulated while I was working on my sliders- bummer.

One thing I found funny and a bit creepy (non related to their services/food) was a customer coming out of the bathroom and then sneaking a picture of us has he walked by. Awkward!

Overall I would recommend firefly as a great place for drinks after work, not sure if they offer happy hour or not but this would be a decent place to go. Given the opportunity to go again I would be okay with giving the food a second try- perhaps  trying an entree next time..."}
{"text":"Food was amazing and very reasonable. Happy hour from 3-6pm then 11pm-? You can get a pitcher of mojitos for $18... prob 6 drinks worth. Bacon wrapped dates are to die for $4. Tuna tartare was incredible. We came to the restaurant 3 times during our 4 day trip, it was that good. 
The only thing I ordered that didn't blow my mind was the beef salad. It was good, just not on the same level as everything else we ate.  Servers are very attentive and super friendly."}
{"text":"I try to get here for any occassion. I LOVE the Thai Beef Salad & Stuffed Dates, oh ya & the Ham&Cheese Crockettes."}
{"text":"My first impression of he restaurant was the service wasn't to friendly and couldn't  accommodate my request because I'm a vegetarian and I wanted them to hold meat from the dish but he repeatedly told me that it's not good with out meat and I insisted I wanted it made without meat. He finally go if you want it you have it but he's going to be nasty. The garlic shrimp and spicy potatoes and shrimp ceviche were the best thing on the menu. The clams hold the meat were also good. He recommended the mussels with curry sauce so we tried it and sent it back it so gross. It was a Mexican restaurant but the flavor of the food was Asian and Italian ( Diablo shrimp dish ). I probably wouldn't come back here again."}
{"text":"I came here for work, lucky I didn't pay. The food was ok I guess, but it all adds up quickly. It's as its described, tapas, or small plates. Best suited for quick work luncheons,  meetings, or just some side snacks to accompany drinks."}
{"text":"As part of a Bachelorette party package (where the limo takes us to a restaurant and then to a nightclub), we went to Firefly last year in May.  We had 14 girls in our group.  We all ordered different items and we all shared different dishes with one another... the food and service was amazing.  I want to say that nearly every dish out of the 5 that I tried was very good!
One year later, I was craving Firefly again because I had such fond memories of how delicious the food was.  
Once again, I wasn't disappointed.  The food was as good as I remember, the service was great and I believe you get a good deal for your money.

I highly recommend this place.  It's slightly off the Vegas strip, but worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Visited while in town for business based on a colleagues recommendation. I'm generally not a fan of Spanish tapas, but was very pleased. Everyone enjoyed and there is certainly something for everyone. Great for a group"}
{"text":"** meh**


The good :
- Tapas mean a huge menu with several affordable tasty options
- plenty of bar seating 
- great happy hour menu with affordable options including some of their most popular meals 
- tasty sangria 

The blah:
- wasn't impressed with the bread and almond / mango butter too many flavors on the butter ' the bread was cold and the butter was like marble. Didn't care for this 
- apple salad was the only edible thing but BEWARE a lot of their meals have almonds in it . So like clearly
If you have a nut allergy this isn't for you
- didn't care for the flavor of the dogs wrapped in bacon
- meatballs were forgettable"}
{"text":"Even in a place with so many great restaurants, this is a gem. Amazing food. Good service. Bit noisy, but with conversation, no doubt about the food.

Tried:
Albondigas (meatballs): 7/10
Padron peppers: 8/10
Ribs: 9/10
Merguez: 8/10
Chicken and chorizo stuffed mushrooms
Chicago beef bocadillos"}
{"text":"Yes.  This place restored my excitement for Vegas.  I don't gamble.  I don't care for strippers.  I don't care to drink free booze until I black out and wake up with a face tattoo in Thailand.  I just enjoy good food and people.  Wanted to stay off the strip to avoid all the meaninglessness so walked to this tapas place near my hotel. Bellied up to the bar... group to my right were bartenders and waitresses from the strip on their day off, laughing out loud and having a great time .  Guy at my left was a chef grabbing some food before heading to work.  Bam.  You know you got a solid place.  Everything I had was amazing (Stuffed dates, pork empanada, eggplant cannelloni, petite filet).  Bartenders on their game and very attentive.  Just a great place, bottom line.  My new favorite place in Vegas."}
{"text":"Love the ambiance of this place. They always have ample seating throughout the restaurant, bar and patio area. 

Drinks: I would highly recommend there strawberry and watermelon mojitos. May just be some of the best mojitos I've had in a while. I'd skip on the passion fruit option. No Bueno. 

Bacon wrapped Dates are still my favorite plate to get here. It's really a great place with good tasting portions. 

Try the Camarones al Diabla and Ajillo. Can't forget those."}
{"text":"Food good, service good, outside parking lot especially in front, SEVERE safety hazard.

Dark curd, nothing to show a curb there, poor lighting, an overall reflection of a management/owner not really caring about the safety of its customers, a common thread for these owners.

Explains why they have had issues and have had to close a few establishments.  My mother law tripped over the curb and fell, the valet guy could have cared less.  Didn't say anything, didn't offer any help, management has no idea, a total lack of caring otherwise there would be plenty of lighting and a well marked curb just like the north side of the building, well lit with a bright yellow curb.

Like I said the service was good, the food came out fast and all tasted good, just disappointed about the outside and the lack of care for customer safety & if someone does have an issue, oh well not their problem attitude."}
{"text":"Great place, cool vibe delicious food! I will definitely try this place again. Service was great also!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite go-to spot in town, whether your starving or just want food to pick at while catching up.. this is where you wanna be! The flavor here is on point  their drinks are so bomb! My favorite is the passion fruit mojito and their red sangria! I always order the petite filet because all the flavors in one dish is to die for! Their firefly fries are one of my favorite, always yummy to have on the table to everyone to pick at."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, small plates of great food to share. A really fun atmosphere and great food. The staff is incredible, the food comes to the table as it is ready, they do a great job of keeping everything straight. They keep the table clear of empty plate and make sure your drinks are always full. All of this at a very reasonable price!! For dessert the chocolate tres leches cake was fantastic."}
{"text":"Ate there tonight.  45 minutes after I left, I threw it all up in the bathroom of a nearby store.  Instant food poisoning.
I had zero to drink - zero!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, great people to meet and great sangria!! A gem that isn't far from the strip! One of my favorite places to go in LV!"}
{"text":"My 300th review and a local Las Vegas favorite! I have to say I've only ever been to this location and not any of the others in the past, but I've never had any type of problems. This most recent time I came with my boyfriend and parents for an early Father's Day celebration. The location parking kinda sucks which is my only reason for a 4 star rather than 5 since it's so hard to find a spot when it's busy.

This time we ordered quite a few different things. My favorites were the steak and mushroom skewers, stuffed peppers and stuffed mushrooms. Their bacon wrapped dates are also very good. Don't let the word tapas fool you as some of these plates are pretty large portions.

I also have to recommend the red sangria, so good! They don't skimp on the liquor either."}
{"text":"Okay so it wad hard enough going into this place the first time after all the trouble the company had had with the health department , but hey, i try to keep an open mind so we went for it. 

Honestly (surprisingly enough) the food was hands down the saving grace of this place. The stuffed dates were insanely good and everything from fries to steaks was well cooked, expertly seasoned and of decent portion size. 

However, and i wish i knew his name (a big muscular guy, maybe late 20s), the bartender was so incredibly rude--and openly so!-- that instead of moving on to entrees like we wanted to, we cashed out and left. 

I wont go into the drawn out details of it all, but trust me when i say i was shocked how clear he made it to us that our business was neither wanted nor appreciated. Its not like the bar or well was even busy. If it was negligence due to that, i could have understood...

Well, we liked the food so much though that we decided to give it a second chance a couple weeks later. But, when we walked in and saw the same bartender with his signature eye roll and snarky comment as our only greeting, we quickly regretted it and left. 

So then, it really is a shame, because the food is killer. If you decide to go, i recommend getting a table and bypassing the bar. We wont be back though."}
{"text":"Firefly is a great off the strip tapas spot. 

Huge restaurant and very lively. Crowded on a Friday night.

Service was friendly.

Artichoke Toast - $7 - Artichoke was tender and seasoned well. 

Stuffed Dates - $6.50 - Salty bacon and sweet date. Reduction makes it really sweet.

Pulpo Asado - $10 - Octopus was grilled perfectly and really tender. Too much potato mixed in, made it hard to find the octopus. 

Camarones Al Ajillo - $11 - Shrimp were plump and tasty. The lemon garlic sauce resembled something you would find in an asian restaurant. 

Steak and Mushroom Skewers - $11 - The filet was so tender and flavorful. Mushrooms were placed evenly with the steak so each bite was perfect. The garlic butter and parmesan enhanced the steak but did not overpower it. My favorite dish we tried. 

Babyback Ribs - $12 - Ribs were fall off the bone. The mango sauce was good but there was to much and made the ribs so saucy and sweet and hid the pork flavor. 

Chocolate Tres Leches Cake - $7 - Chocolatey and moist cake.

Red Sangria - $8
Blueberry Mojito - $8
The signature drinks they have here. Good but to sweet for me."}
{"text":"Went to here for lunch on a weekend with my girlfriend and it was busy, but not nighttime busy. It is a relatively good place to go for lunch if you don't like crowds. We didn't know what to order so we took the tips from the waiter mentioning that we should get the Filet Mignon Sliders and Stuffed Dates. I've got to say, my gf and I both thought they were off the plate tasty! We also tried the Tune Tartare, which apparently was too fishy for my gf, but I thought it was quite good. We also got some skewers and calamari, but those were just mediocre plates. Overall, the food was impressive.
I'd give Firefly 4.5 stars if I could due to it being slightly pricey. I am probably biased, but tapas places are pretty expensive."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. The dates and mac and cheese are wonderful. Ate there twice while on vacation !"}
{"text":"OH MY GOD! this place was amazzzzzzzing. Please open one in Chicago just like it!!! I was visiting Vegas with a friend for 4 days. Please note that I ate here twice during my stay. Wowzers.. Talk about tasty food. We had dinner the first time- The place was packed and the hostesses were very friendly and helpful. We didn't wait too long since I had called for directions and made a last minute reservation. 

My friend had the dates wrapped in bacon- she couldn't stop raving about it. Almost made my vegetarian self try some :) But I didn't. I did however, have the eggplant stuffed with ricotta cheese and marinara sauce.. I have never had eggplant that tasted that great. It was perfectly cooked and the cheese melted in my mouth. YUM. We also had the beet and goat cheese salad. That was pretty tasty also.. the perfect mix drizzled with olive oil... and least but not last, we had the dessert... oh I thought I died and went to heaven. Bread pudding mixed with ice cream covered with raspberry syrup... I don't care for sweets too much but I couldn't stop eating it. 

My friend really liked their sparkling sangria. The second time we had the tortilla española(hot) and manchego cheese- mac and cheese.. This folks is something you should not miss out on. 

Did I mention the service was impeccable and they even called a cab for us. One of my favorite places. Now if I could just go back to Vegas more frequently I would definitely do so. Go here. Just in case the 4 1/2 stars didn't persuade you to do so:)"}
{"text":"I love tapas so I can try everything. This place has fun, noisy atmosphere, good sangria and very good food. Best for a small group"}
{"text":"Being a big eater, I thought a tapas restaurant would not be for me.  This worked got me I was way stuffed."}
{"text":"Yummy tapas for sure! My hubby and I really really like this place. We have been there 3 times in the past month to just have some drinks away from the kids and enjoy a snack while chatting. It is always a pleasure to come here and we get treated well each time by a friendly staff. The table however was not really clean that well the last time we came but that is my only issue."}
{"text":"We found this place off the strip, and it was a great find.  More reasonably priced than Cafe Ba Ba Reeba, but I'm sure their location has a lot to do with that.  The ahi tuna skewers were good, caamarones a la diabla are nice and spicy, and of course I had to have dessert... the caramel flan was perfectly creamy and tasty.  I wasn't a big fan of the crispy duck rolls... duck is already oily and this fried roll was way too much for me."}
{"text":"Firefly never disappoints, obsessed with the firefly fries and their chicken salad is one of the best. Nahum was our server he was very kind and attentive."}
{"text":"What a fabulous date place!

I have been here many times but had taken a hiatus until a hot date suggested tapas...We made reservations for 8PM Saturday, got dolled up and went to town!

We were seated right away and the hostesses were very friendly.  Our waitress was awesome and the other staff constantly refilled our waters and removed plates.  Considering it was wall-to-wall packed, our food came out extremely fast!  

We ordered a pitcher of red sangria...mmm!  I might have had 3/4ths of it!  For grub, we had lamb skewers over lentils (soooo yummy), crispy duck rolls, tuna tartare with taro chips, vegetable empanadas (looove the sauce on them), manchego mac n cheese, and tortilla espaniola (potato omelette).  These were ordered over 2 rounds so we could pace ourselves.  Food was hot, delivered fast, and very tasty.  

It set us up to walk around Fremont Street and my date won the equivalent of our dinner cost back at 4 Queens playing blackjack (luck be a lady!!)"}
{"text":"Firefly has amazing food and great service. Carlos knows exactly what's going on and I recommend you request him as your server if you want to have a great experience. Our favorites were the Firefly fries, tuna tartar, lemon garlic shrimp, and lamb chops. Carlos knew how to provide excellent wine service and never left our glasses empty. The establishment was constantly busy which attests to the quality of service they provide."}
{"text":"the food is so so to bad meat taste so hard and not much foods there no any kind seafoods or wat dislike come here"}
{"text":"a nice chill and mellow social experience.^^

TIME SPENT
2x at night-time

LAYOUT
south american decor, low lounge seating, very somberly lit.   everything seems to roll together to give off the right upscale and interesting social experience.^^   it may even be even good for a romantic engagement.

SERVICE
prompt at first, but delivery is slow.   i found the server friendly and knowledgable about the menu.

FOOD
be warned, the majority of the food is not meant to fill...   the portions are small and the selection is meant to be picked over while u converse with your party.   however, what u get IS tasty, but the sangria is average fair.

PRICING
the menu isn't expensive, but all the small orders do add up.   drinking prices can look pricey ($8-$16 avg), but is really the norm in Vegas.   i'm actually surprised they're not pricier as Firefly feels very upscale.

CLOSING
i think Firefly is a great place to be -- if you're a local.   sure, the decor is nice and the ambience is good...  but ur buying into a look and not the over-all experience.   IMO, the Vegas experience tourists should value, is the kind that they can't find anywhere else...  am i right.??

low lighting, common tapas food, and the selection of exotic drinks (who doesn't have a signature drink these days) at Firefly won't leave you with a lasting impression of Vegas.   this place is more for locals who want to kickback after a long day of work or schmooze with their friends.

and i hate to say nay to something and not fix it.   the Gordon Biersch Brewery right across the street would do you a better service.   i know my friends would recommend Musashi's located in the same shopping center, but i say meh to that also......  i'm not on their payroll, btw... LOLz.^^;"}
{"text":"Did a Yelp search for tapas before heading to Vegas from Buffalo and found 2 close to our hotel.  Turns out we could walk to Firefly it a minute.  Soooo glad we did.  We've had dinner and lunch here this week.  All the goods ..... Nice atmosphere and patio, Service was VG, and great menu.  We're going there for lunch again before we fly back.
Suggestions: Heirloom Tomato Salad, Stuffed Dates, Grilled Garbanzos (although they're \"in the shell\" meaning a little messy to eat), Ahi Tuna Skewers and Chicken Skewers.
Firefly will be on our \"To-Do\" list each time we return to Vegas.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Was taken here for a business outing during my trip to Vegas for a conference.  How did I like it?  Luved it....sure did.....not only because it was off the strip and outside of a casino with fresh air and without the sounds of slot machine bells but because the food and sangria were d-lish-us.  Damn straight.  

If you go, try to take friends.  Tapas are meant to be shared so the more people, the more plates.  Order the empanadas, the duck rolls, the cerviche, and most everything on the menu.  I am not a fan of lamb so I stayed away from those dishes.

Atmosphere was pretty good and music generated a great vibe in the place.  Definitely recommend it.  

**They just opened a sister joint next door called Dragonfly.  It's a sushi place."}
{"text":"First time eating here for drinks and dinner. I ordered the seafood paella and it was amazing! Great service and all food was great!"}
{"text":"Sangria was super refreshing. Choice of red, white, or sparkling. $6 a glass or $24 for a pitcher. Mojitos are good too. The flavored ones are $.50 more, but 1/2 off during happy hour! Bacon wrap dates with smoked almonds and blue cheese was my favorite dish! Free bread and olives for starters! Great service too. A great place to dine besides the strip!"}
{"text":"Yummmmmmmmm!
Best little Tapas joint in Vegas !! If it's busy, it's worth the wait.  Red Sangria is very nice with lots of apple in it.  This is always my  favorite location"}
{"text":"Vacationing in Las Vegas was wonderful especially because we found this great Tapas restaurant. We were a table of 4 and got a seat right away since we got there at 6:30pm on a Saturday. Expect a wait if you go after 6:30pm, but it's worth the wait to get a drink and relax while you wait. We started with a pitcher of Red Sangria, which was able to serve each of us a glass and a half (we ordered a pitcher of White Sangria after that was gone). I'm not sure which I liked better. Both were delicious and the red was a little dryer which was nice since we had it with dinner and it complimented the food nicely. 

We had a friend with us that is allergic to shellfish and made sure we told our server before hand that way the server can tell him if he ordered anything for himself that had shellfish in it and he wasn't aware. 

The dates wrapped in bacon were one of my favorites as well as the tuna tar tar. Yummy! The flavors were like fireworks on my palate exploding with flavor and making me want more. The dishes came out quickly and even after ordering so much our final bill was not as high as we all thought it would be. 4 people ordering dishes like crazy with 2 pitchers of margarita's around $200. 

In my opinion the food was better than our favorite Tapas restaurant in Boston, MA and the prices were a lot better as well. Service was great and ambiance was perfect. With it being so big I thought it would get loud, but you don't notice it when you have good food, pitchers of sangria and wonderful company. Yum!"}
{"text":"When you are craving great Spanish Tapa's food (and you should often....) and are in Vegas make sure you stop by Firefly Tapas Kitchen and Bar!!  The food is amazing....  Finish your meal with the stuffed dates because it is soooo yummmy.  You won't want any other flavor to end your great meal.  We always hit this place up when we come into town which is once a quarter.  We went to the new location and it is so nice inside.  Cozy and warm.  You won't be disapointed!!1"}
{"text":"Wow....  when you want true authentic Tapa's go here!!!  Was craving the great tapa's you can get in Spain and found this place by accident.  This was the best accident we have ever had!!  The manchego mac n cheese is to die for.  The Stuffed Dates wrapped in bacon, the tomato biscue and and and and..................   Everything was fantastic!  I only rate a 4 because the dining room was just OK.  Appropriate decor but be a little better.  Staff was also great!  We also eat here on our way out of Vegas.  Save the best for last."}
{"text":"I ate here twice while visiting Las Vegas, NV. I love the prices. The quality of the food is quite good.  I enjoyed the flamenco paintings on the wall and the atmosphere afforded by pleasant waiters reminding me of southern Spain.  The tapas make me happy. The only thing I would add is some more architecture...as it is, the place is a bit too much of a strip mall in a desert city in the U.S.A..  It needs a bit more stone work, a tighter decor that makes you feel like you are in a tiny alley in a historic town in Andalucia.  Oh well, it's Las Vegas.  Go for the prices and you won't be disappointed by the food.  

I guess the \"firefly\" lived up to it's name: the place needs to add some fly catchers on the front patio.

Another recommendation to improve this place would be a better beer list.  More microbrews from the United States would be a good addition to the Spanish wine drinks."}
{"text":"Most of the dishes were fine. Not sure why all the 4-5 star reviews. The best thing was probably the stuffed dates. The kitchen forgot our order and we didn't get our food until 40 mins later. That sucked."}
{"text":"Have you ever glanced over a menu and had the urge to order practically everything, but resisted because you otherwise would have a plethora of to-go boxes to take home?  Well, thanks to small plate servings such as dim sum and tapas, adventurous foodies can now have their cake and eat (all of) it too!

This past weekend, a few friends and I trekked over to Sin City to celebrate a dear friend's twenty-seventh birthday.  After checking into the Vdara Hotel (which is simply gorgeous in a minimal and contemporary fashion), we taxied off the Strip and arrived at Firefly to meet with some new friends for birthday dinner #1.  Since some of us skipped on breakfast and/or lunch, the ladies and I got a tad carried away with ordering.  But hey, we were planning on sharing.  And you know what they say, sharing is caring!

Amongst the extensive tapas offered, our entire group of seven probably ordered about a quarter to a third of the list (there were so many plates in rotation during dinner that I might have forgotten an item or few.)

*Tuna Tar tare
Smoked Salmon Toast
*Stuffed Dates
Sausage Plate
Thai Beef Salad
Stuffed Peppers
*Manchego Mac N Cheese
Fried Calamari
*Steamed Mussels
Lobster 'Escargots'
*Ham & Cheese Croquetas
Steak & Mushroom Skewers
Crispy Duck Roll
Paella
*Flavored Mojitos

* = personal favorites

 Although all the plates were delicious, I had a few noteworthy items that I wanted to spotlight. 

Stuffed Dates: It's been a few days since our tapas dinner yet I can still taste the delicious flavors of the dates.  The bacon that wrapped around the date & bleu cheese was cooked perfectly - slightly crispy but still chewy enough to enjoy each bite.  The sharpness of bleu cheese was a wonderful compliment to the sweetness of the dates, all enhanced with a red wine reduction glaze.

Steamed Mussels:  I'm not a huge advocate of mussels, but these were pretty darn tasty.  No, not because of the mussels itself, but because of the aromatic coconut curry sauce that it basked in.  Coming from a Southeast Asian background, I have a strong appreciation for cuisines that infuse coconut into its entrees as well as desserts.  The concoction was so good that we were all dipping our bread into the sauce, long after the mussels cleared out.

Ham & Cheese Croquetas:  I absolutely love the chicken croquettes at Portos Bakery (Burbank, CA) and never failed to order some when I'm dining elsewhere.  The smokiness of the Serrano ham and the buttery texture of the melted Manchego cheese was a match made in food heaven.  If we didn't already have a quarter of the menu sprawled out on our table, I would have suggested ordering seconds!

I was extremely surprised at the serving portions of each tapas plate.  After my last experience at Viva Madrid (Claremont, CA), I anticipated on having to pick up a snack on the way back to the hotel.  Luckily, that was far from the case at Firefly.  The portions were generous and sufficient to share amongst the seven of us.  Also, if a pitcher of mojitos is on your list, I would suggest the Mango flavored one - delish!

Would it be wrong of me to say that I want to come back to LV just for Firefly?"}
{"text":"Had a great time with a big group here. The food was fantastic. Make sure your order includes the FireFly Fries, the ribs, and the bacon-wrapped dates. Everything is great, but those items are unbelievable. The staff is super great and helpful too!"}
{"text":"We got to this place 20 minutes before it opened. The waiter let us in anyway. The interior design looks so much cheaper than the other firefly, but the food is quite beyond my expectations. Firefly fries (bluecheese on fries, very creative) is a must have. If you have any questions, just consult with the waiters there, their suggestions are more than helpful. 

Another thought: this place should be an alternative option for a Vegas night. Their drink selection is quite special."}
{"text":"Off the Strip with a solid tapas selection and offering giant pitchers of your choice sangria or mojito, Firefly was a great reprieve from the extravagance of Las Vegas' strip. The food wasn't necessarily phenomenal but all of the dishes were good. And the prices were very reasonable (rare considering its locale...).

They had all of the basics - stuffed dates wrapped in bacon, patatas bravas draped in what tasted like a chipotle mayo sauce, Serrano ham and cheese croquetas (quite rich), stuffed picadillo peppers with goat cheese - and they all tasted the way they should. 

If you're in Vegas and are looking for a quick escape back to normalcy, head here to load up on some well-priced pitchers along with a satisfying sampling of small plates."}
{"text":"Delicious food, good prices, super friendly wait staff and manager. Although, it did take a while to get a bill. Granted we were a large party- but asked to have our checks split before ordering."}
{"text":"I was a little reluctant to try because of the food poisoning fiasco they had at the previous location but have to say was very pleasant. The tapas were very tasty and although I'm a vodka guy the sangria they are famous for was very good. Good job turning things around Firefly!"}
{"text":"What makes us go to Firefly in the first place is their spectacular sangria but what keeps us going back are all those bomb tapas. Food & beverage there is on point. Staff could be better at being more available for the tables but hey it was a busy Saturday night so completely understandable as well. Love the ambiance!"}
{"text":"loved this place.  pretty much everything is good, especially the fries, the mac and cheese, and the bacon wrapped dates.  we had a pitcher of mojitos and a pitcher of sangria, i loved the mojitos (and they were strong) but i wasn't a fan of the sangria (although i don't like sangria in general so its nothing against them ...).  great for a girls night or a date night.  we went for a bachelorette party and i thought the service was more than adequate (and they brought our bride a free shot, which was a nice touch).  Prices were pretty reasonable given the quality of the food.  Wish i lived in vegas so i could go back!"}
{"text":"Overall food was great! So much different types of food and well we were brought  here by my friend because he LOVES the sangria...and boy he was right!!! I usually get headaches when I drink sangria, but for some reason I didnt get one when I drank it.  My friend also mentioned that their servings were a bit bigger than what it was before thus the priced increased by an average of $1. 

Tried the chicken and mushroom paella, ahi tuna skewer, steak and mushroom skewer, manchego mac n' cheese,  spare ribs,  baked scallops, shrimp tempura, and escargot.  All BOMB.

The service was good... but there were lull times of waiter for the come  but when he did come, he was nothing but polite."}
{"text":"Great experience.  I recommend anyone in Vegas make this one of the places you stop to eat.  It is great food, great service and great atmosphere.  I would consider this one of the places locals would go to eat.  There isn't any inflated prices you see on the strip so if you want a great time without the typical inflated costs so many good restaurants in Las Vegas have, this will be a nice surprise for you too."}
{"text":"Perfect starter to a wild Vegas night.

I love tapas joints and this is one the best.  The menu here is excellent with a wide variety of original dishes that wont break the bank.  The ambiance is loungey hip and the service is excellent.  Ive been here several times with large groups and they have catered nicely to us each time.  Place is pretty popular so dinner time usually has a wait but there is a bar for you to pass the time.  

Here are some of my favorite plates:

Filet Mignon Sliders - Juicy patty full of flavor and deep fried onion strings on top give it a crunch.

Firefly Fries - Goes great with the sliders and good item to share.

Chorizo Clams - Delicious! Chorizo adds richness and the broth makes a great dip for the bread.

Crispy Duck Roll - Kind of a small dish, but if your into duck this thing is bomb.

Stuffed Dates - Just a real tasty little concoction with great flavor.  Very good appetizer to start things off.

This place is an off the strip secret for some great fine dining and a perfect warm up to some good times.  Parking is a little tough but you'll manage."}
{"text":"Loved the place. Service was wonderful. Told my son about the place and he was very pleased with the food and service. A little loud for my liking"}
{"text":"Muy buena atención y la comida espectacular, el ambiente de poca luz pero muy acogedor"}
{"text":"Food was good. We were with a group so it was great to try many types of dishes. The mohitos in a pitcher were terrible. We just sent two pitchers back."}
{"text":"We had a tough day so we treated ourselves to dinner at Firefly and were not disappointed. Our service was impeccable and the food was great. I highly recommend the ribs. They were my favorite. By the time we finished our pitcher of sangria we felt much better."}
{"text":"Firefly is such a cute spot. Very quaint and relaxing. Came around 4PM on a Sunday and got seated very quickly. They give you a choice of sitting at the bar, outside, or inside. 

We chose  to sit outside since it was pretty nice outside considering Vegas never has nice weather lol ((I hate the weather here.)) Outside seating area has fans and light bulbs hanging from the ceiling. 

They start off with bread and almond butter. My expectations were high since all the reviews raved about it, but the bread was pretty hard and didn't taste fresh and the almond butter was a bit too sweet.
 
We ordered firefly fries, calamari, mac n cheese, and the ribs.

When they brought the fries out, my eyes lit up and I swear my pupils turned into hearts. The portions are so big and they put the perfect amount of Parmesan cheese (some places are so stingy with that lol), luvvvvvv fries!!!!!!!!!! You can never have too much fries. If you think otherwise, we can't be friends. Ever.

The mac n cheese was really good at first, very unique flavor. The tomatoes on top make it even more flavorful. However, halfway through I had to stop eating it because it was way too cheesy. It's either that or I was a little tipsy off my red sangria (which is yummy, btw!) 

Calamari, yum! So crispy and well portioned out.

The ribs....... R.I.P to those. They were devoured in about 5 minutes. 

Service: Quick and attentive. 

All in all, would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Went there with my fiancé, and we both loved it. We probably like the stuffed dates best. Also had the mushroom tartlet, stuffed peppers, and ahi tuna skewers. All were great. They also didn't skimp on the alcohol in the cocktails. We'll be back, as there are a lot of other things we would love to try."}
{"text":"Love it!  Apple & manchego salad is amazing.
Just went back after a month.  Warm Spinach salad is great.  The dressing and the cheese, peppers, artichokes  were good.  My fish was excellent, great sauce.
Unfortunately I was next to this rude and grumpy table of six.  They didn't understand that little plates come out at separate times.  They all wanted to eat together.  And they were confused by what they ordered.  The people that had the lunch specials complained about the fries being cold.  Now that was a real complaint but it could have been fixed.  
The \"Ringleader\" of this group was very unpleasant.  I think we all know what type of foods they are going out to eat now.  (No more Chinese!)  Apparently they eat out a lot!  Eating out is great but we don't all need to hear for 15 minutes what you six are going to eat.
Firefly is a lot of fun, and very good food.  The atmosphere is friendly but trendy.  I hope that the ladies working there don't get in trouble.  These people were difficult.
Yes I will continue to eat there, keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"I always order the ceviche whenever I come here, deff my favorite! My fiancé is obsessed with the bread they bring to the table while you wait for your food & I second that! Another item  I would say to not hesitate to order is the white sparkling sangria. Every time I bring friends with me to eat here, we always leave happy with the service :) just a quick tip if you order the ceviche, always ask for extra chips!"}
{"text":"Every time I'm in town, I make this a must eat or die place.  I can forgo all the places Hawaii doesn't have to make time for to eat here.  And it's because I'm so in love with this place!  It's perfect for groups or dates because tapas are the best thing ever!  I have tried a lot of things on their menu, but not everything.  I hope to try everything, but there are so many choices!  And of course you have to get your favorites, too.

My go to favorites are the empanadas, baked goat cheese, chorizo clams, to name a few.  I'd probably list all the stuff I've tried, if I could.  But yes, I still have to try all.  Go with a few friends and have each person pick a couple so you can taste a variety.  I mean, hopefully, everyone would pick different items!  And the best thing to drink is the sangria.  Tapas and sangria are so awesome together.  The sangria tastes great and isn't watered down or bitter.  Trust me on this even if you don't care for wine, get the sangria!

Normally it's just a couple of us, so we've never had to wait for a table.  I know if you have a large group, you should make reservations.  There is ample parking and the service is awesome.  Kind of random though, when a person just drops food and takes off.  They normally tell you what it is.  But with me, I normally forget what I've ordered and I'll sit there wondering, did I get this?  But usually it is something I've ordered.  Rarely do I get someone else's order.  Service is always quick and friendly, I just love it!

I can't wait to return to Las Vegas to come back!  I need to try more items!  With Sangria!! Yay!!"}
{"text":"Out of every place we've eaten at on our 2 day stay, this has been my favorite. We ordered:
-Ceviche of shrimp
- Stuffed dates
-Tierra y Mar Skewers
- Calamari 
-Scallops escargots 
- chicken and chorizo stuffed mushrooms 
- Seafood paella 

Everything was delicious. Not a single plate disappointed."}
{"text":"There's so many extensive reviews already I don't need to write another, just want to add that this is my favorite place to eat in all of Las Vegas!  You might wait a while to get in but it's worth it.

Don't miss the filet sliders or infused vodka martini, but don't try to stand up too quickly after more than one!"}
{"text":"Slightly disappointed because all the publicity took away some of the intimate aspects of the \"old\" Firefly. Parking was horrid (you can't tell if one side is one-way or not) and the wait was long at the new location when we finally found it! Given that, I still think that this is the best tapas restaurant that I've ever been to. My friends and I have been a regular before it was \"popular\" and hyped up, and we've always loved the menu items, all the way down to asking for extra bread and that yummy butter! 

Our regular orders would usually consist of the chicken salad (TO DIE FORRRR!!), petit filet, firefly fries, empanadas and the kabobs among other things. I am absolutely in love with the chicken salad and I wish I could make it at home, but ehh. Price is okay, but I wouldn't go regularly--only on special occasions or when the gang gets together for a dinner date. Their dessert items are also very good.  I have never, ever been disappointed by their food! Also, the white sangria is yummy but I gotta say that their pitcher of Strawberry mojito beats the sangria hands down. 

I wish they had a Firefly here where I lived now, that's how awesome this place is (minus the long wait). Last visited August 2013."}
{"text":"We came here with friends and I wasn't blown away by it. I had a mediocre experience and didn't feel the food was as great as described. I'll have to admit the restaurant made me reconsider my feelings towards dates, because their stuffed dates with blue cheese was really good. The bread was also good. Other than that though, I didn't think much was special. The tuna tartare was bland, and the mac n' cheese was pretty ordinary. I prefer the steamed mussels on the Strip at Bouchon. However, because everyone has such great reviews for this place, I'll have to come back and try it again!"}
{"text":"Firefly is about as good as it gets! A well-kept secret that just might soon become Vegas' most popular restaurant. We are locals and had heard how good this place was, and guess what? it was ALL true. There is nothing to not love about Firefly. Mojitas and Sangrias are excellent. Bacon-wrapped dates are sublime. The service was flawless - our waiters Ladell and Alex G. were on it the entire time - nonstop. Overall, a terrific experience! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"If you are staying at the Mirage, TI, Venetian, Palazzo, Wynn, Encore, you can walk to FireFly, we did it in 24-minutes, and it is worth it. 

We did not have a reservation on a Monday evening, FireFly was crowed, but they seated us right away at 7pm, we sat on the outside deck, and we noticed by 8pm the cabs were just dropping people off , it seems like every 2-minutes.  

The menu has a very large selection, so a tip is, do a little research before you go and ask questions of the wait-staff on what is popular, what do other guest like the most, etc....also, start with Vegetable dishes, move on to seafood, then the meats.

We had a couple of Cucumber Martini's made with Hendricks Gin, they were tasty, refreshing, good, but not enough alcohol/gin, in these drinks.  It was more like a mixed drink/cock-tail.  My expectation for a Martini is a, well, Martini, and two Martini's should do a little bit of damage.....

The bread served, with olives, and some mystery spread, not anything special; actually, i didn't bother to eat any of it.

Here's what we had:

- Stuffed Roasted Red Peppers - cheesy goodness.

- Warm/Wilted Spinach Salad - light and citrusy

- Bacon Wrapped Dates - okay, it's BACON ! BACON anything !

- Steamed Mussels - can't go wrong here, yummy, only criticism is the cheese bread served with the Mussels, isn't toasted very well, and it is severed on-top of the mussels, and it made the bread soggy.

- Pulpo Acaso (Squid) - grilled, smoky, tentacles (I know what you're thinking)

- Camarones Diable (Shrimp) - Like a chinese dish, soy, sugar, spicy, red pepper flakes, tangy, and NO Breading, NOT Fried . (all ways good, but I think this was the best dish of the night).

Best thing was the Bill, which included 5-cuumber martini's w/o tip was $89.18. 

Fun Place, really good food, ...Value, Value, Value for your money.

We were stuffed and walked back to the Palazzo, we need the extra exercise to walk off the extra calories...."}
{"text":"If you want the best Bloody Mary's you have ever had in your life, go see Daniel Chino (the Russian) at Firefly. Please don't wear him out though, because he is my favorite Bloody Mary Maker!! Omar is also fantastic...pretty much every bartender here is on point. Become a regular and they will absolutely take care of you. No matter what other Firefly establishments may have done, this place is by far on point. I love their Happy Hour, I love their appetizers, I love it all. Come here over and over and over!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas. The food is delicious. I was in there this evening, and had the best service  in a long time. My boyfriend and I were celebrating a special occasion and our waiter went above and beyond to make it a wonderful evening. He was informative, kind, and attentive. Thank you Jesus Eduardo!"}
{"text":"I've heard about firefly & its previous demerits with the health district which is why I was reluctant to go at first...but I'm so glad I changed my mind! Coming in at around 10pm, our small party didn't end till around 1am. This is definitely the place to not only eat, but get a good conversation in. 

TAPAS are amazing. Our group ordered several small plates to try it all out! Our dishes included machego Mac n cheese, stuffed peppers, Apple & machego salad, firefly fries, camarones a la Diabla, etc. 

I don't eat bacon, but many others have loved the bacon wrapped dates (I wanna say it's called chorizo or something). 

It was all so good my mouth continues to water. The apple and machego salad was different; definitely worth trying! The camarones a la Diabla were fancy, loved the sauce/dressing. I could go on and on about the stuffed peppers and the garlic cream cheese that was stuffed inside...but even then no justice would be served. 

For dessert, us 4 girls ordered the dessert platter and that was more than enough to try their best sweet items. Flan was definitely the best! 

Bottom Line: TRY what you can. It's delicious. It can get ridiculously busy, but they are open late."}
{"text":"Nice place for Tapas!!  Easy & convenient to make reservations online.
Lots of parking behind the restaurant!
Great place to get-together with friends..."}
{"text":"So I should start off with saying that my husband and I could not afford the 3 to 4 thousand minimums on the strip for our wedding reception. I had been to the firefly before and liked the food enough and the vibe enough. So the good, I live in Seattle and I am privilege to really amazing food. If you live in Seattle and you make a decent living a month you also know what good food is and likely don't even realize how good you are eating because you take for granted how fresh and local everything is. So yeah, we chose tapas. It was good. They had some really great and delicious items but it was not amazing by any means but then again nothing I ate in Vegas was amazing. I am convinced that amazing food is very difficult to come by in a desert.  So the food was better than anything we had eaten in Vegas but by no means amazing. The service was o.k. People waited  longer for drinks than I would have liked them too considering we booked this six months in advance. Our space was cramped, at the back of the restaurant in a corner. A bit more space even two or three inches between tables would have made moving about easier. They did however allow us to bring in an Elvis impersonator at no additional charge. That was awesome. We had ordered a lovely cake from a local bakery that we were charged per head for yet when the cake was brought out it was obviously straight from the walk in and the frosting was cold and hard. We brought the remaining cake back to the hotel with us and were able to fully appreciate how delicious it was once it was at a warmer temp the next day. Firefly was an ok pick for being on a budget, however if we would have had a few extra K to spend for a reception we would have taken the party elsewhere. It was not great neither bad. It is close to the strip."}
{"text":"This is another another place a Vegas local friend took me to on my recent visit. As with Kaizen, this place has a more locals feel. It is off the strip in the same strip mall as Ruth Chris Steakhouse. This restaurant was doing so well that it opened a restaurant next door called DragonFly. 

Anyway, Firefly is Latin inspired tapas restaurant with a good looking bar. They have small patio area. The decor was hip and modern. The food sampling was good and varied. They have an octopus tapa which I tried. The service was OK to good. We were there for a early dinner late afternoon snack so definitely not peak time. 

Again as Kaizen, another Vegas locals place to try if you can tear yourself away from the Strip, stripping clubbing, or strip steaks."}
{"text":"Fantastic tapas, great service, delicious drinks and a cool atmosphere. I am definitely coming back here. I would recommend the blueberry as well as the original mojitos. As I said, all the tapas were delicious but the Tierra y mar skewers take the cake. These were my favorite! The salsa verde ties the flavors of the filet, shrimp and chorizo together. I could simply go there and just order these and the mojitos and be a happy camper."}
{"text":"Food was excellent. Had to wait at times for the waitress. Overall fantastic experience. Good ambiance. A little loud, part of the charm."}
{"text":"The food here was good and unique! I would recommend slightly dressing up... like with slacks and a nicer shirt/top. I went in a t-shirt, capris, and flip-flops and felt under-dressed."}
{"text":"Arrived when they were opening.  Odd, funky smell from old mop water thankfully dissipated before food arrived.  

Bartender spent too much time talking with her boyfriend, so drinks took Way Too Long to be delivered, and we were sitting next to the bar.  

Waiter and back waiter were friendly and attentive. Small plates were hit and miss, but I would give it another try."}
{"text":"This was everything I could have asked for in a dinner experience. 

We had a busy night ahead, so we planned for an early dinner. Even at 5pm on a Wednesday, it was pretty hopping, but with no wait. We inadvertently arrived during happy hour, so our drinks were 1/2 price...a very pleasant surprise when we got the bill.

Speaking of drinks, they had by far the best sangria I've ever had...3 days of steeping will do that. Their pomegranate mojitos and martinis were also incredible. 

Between the two of us, we shared 4 plates, which was plenty to be on the verge of stuffed. The plates were bigger than I expected and every dish was wonderful in its own right.

The Mushroom Tart was very tasty, with flaky buttery layers in the tart, a hearty and deeply flavorful mushroom sauce, and tender, thiny sliced mushrooms...and that was the dish we were least excited about :)

The Tuna Tartare was to die for. It literally melted in your mouth, with bit of avocado, sesame seeds and other flavors that blended together for the perfect balance, served with thin crisps that offered a lovely texture contrast.

The Thai Beef Salad had thin, seared slivers of tender beef, cucumbers, ginger, and a fresh savory dressing over a crispy romaine bed of lettuce. I could have consumed my body weight in it, and never felt guilty.

And the best for last - the Petite Filet - was hands-down our favorite. The steak was tender and beautifully prepared. The roasted potatoes were seasoned with something I couldn't put my finger on, but I'd really love to track it down...it was amazing. Add a bit of sautéed mushrooms and it was a dish that was a masterpiece.

All that culinary joy, plus 3 delicious drinks and tip came in under $60 during happy hour. I can't recommend the quality for price point more!

The atmosphere was hip and a little close. You'll definitely be sitting next to your neighboring diners closely enough that they could lean over and ask what that dish is that is making your eyes roll back in your head, so I wouldn't expect a private romantic dinner. But it was a lively, fun environment with friendly, attentive waitstaff (ours had an impressively tall Mohawk). 

All in all, I see what the hype is all about!"}
{"text":"Hmm...I'm not sure where to begin here. 

Let's try some sandwich management (no pun intended) - positive, negative, positive.

Positive - The food was great and so were the prices.  I'd say the pricing for the quality and portion size of food was really right on.  Had the Pulpo Asado (octopus), Filet Sliders, Podrano Peppers, and a few other things - all great.  

Negative - The sangria is SUPER overrated.  My boyfriend and I had almost pitchers and we were stone cold sober afterwards.  It was just a LOT of juice and not much else...not impressed, especially for an \"authentic\" tapas place.  I should also mention that in general, I really love Sangria, so this was a big disappointment.  Also - the bacon-wrapped dates? I mean, they were good, but not amazing - I've had better.

Positive - The bartender was super sweet and I really liked the vibe.


I'll definitely be back, but next time, no sangria."}
{"text":"This place is Awesome! On top of having the best looking date in the entire restaurant, the food was remarkable! It was her idea to come here, and I have to say, it was worth every penny! The downfall was the wait however, i think that has a lot to do with the fact that i was starving...everything seems long when your hungry or in a hurry. Overall a great experience. 

Open late, nice relaxed atmosphere, unbeatable prices and unparalleled taste! Filet Mignon for like 12 bucks ! go figure! Anytime I visit vegas you will find me here at some point! 

Keep up the great work and hey whenever you want to open a Firefly in Los Angeles, or Los angeles area, Contact me for the grand opening! I will be there with bells on! lol May be interested in investing in it! lol Buy some stock, hell i'll sleep there and wake up too it! lol Hope this helps someone definitely go here!"}
{"text":"Great find off the Strip! Came here with a group of 9 to celebrate my friend's birthday. The tapas style worked perfectly for our large party, and we all got to sample a variety of dishes: ceviche, tuna tartare, patatas bravas, pork empanada, chicken empanada, fish sticks, fried calamari, pulpo asado (octopus), steamed mussels, scallop \"escargots\", steak and mushroom skewers, lamb chops, and seafood paella. We also ordered pitchers of both red and white sangria. Everything was delicious and there wasn't anything I didn't like! Some plates do only come with a few pieces, so we did order doubles. 

The service was attentive the whole night, with our waiter checking up on us regularly and our waters refilled. We brought a cake in, and they helped us cut and serve it for dessert. Price was extremely reasonable, unlike some other restaurants in Vegas. In terms of atmosphere, there was some dim mood lighting, Spanish decor and art, and the space is pretty big. We got seated in a sort of private booth which was kinda cool. Will definitely come back the next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"I had the bacon wrapped dates, scallops escargot, steak skewer, and manchego Mac n cheese. It was all good, but nothing made me overly excited. I would love to come back again with my husband or friends because the atmosphere is nice and we could all share."}
{"text":"This location is working hard for your business! The servings are generous for tapas! The mojitos and sangria are excellent!
I highly recommend all of their dishes as I've tried almost all of them!

Don't forget to use your bread to soak up the tasty sauces from the plates!

Nahum in an awesome server! Thank you!"}
{"text":"love love love coming here!! firefly is always a favorite when I come down by the strip. the tapas are a great price and SO yummy. my favorites are the apple manchego salad and the stuffed dates. their mojitos are bomb too. Daniel was my bartender today and he was awesome! He even invited us back for their Sunday brunch :)"}
{"text":"Simply put this place is AMAZING!  Probably one of the best restaurant experiences I've ever had in my life.  The food here is on a whole other level & the attention to detail is superb. These folks are turning out world class tapas dishes that taste & appear like something you would see on a \"Food & Wine\" cover.  I went with a few friends and we shared a ton of different dishes & 2 pitchers of Sangria for a total bill of less than $100.00. My only advice would be to get there early, on a Monday night the wait was easily over an hour & on weekends I'm told the waits exceed 2+ hours quickly."}
{"text":"Service on slow side on busy Friday night, but food was fantastic! Everything I tried was very, very good!"}
{"text":"Came here for my bachelorette dinner and had a fantastic experience. Our server Mario was very attentive and helpful with the menu. The manager came over at one point to ensure we were enjoying ourselves and had a round of drinks sent over to us. The food and sangria was also excellent, I highly enjoyed the bacon wrapped dates. Thank you Firefly for a memorable dinner"}
{"text":"This Tapas place is really good. 7 of us went for dinner here and we ate good!  The service we had there was pretty good, and the time we waited for our food to come out was pretty much like nothing!  We had two pitchers of Sangria (red and white) and both were delicious.

Do try this place if you love tapas! And if you go, try everything! hehe

I would love to come back here on my next trip to vegas!"}
{"text":"I come here often when in Vegas. The food is great service is fast and though I have not had the drinks here they look delicious and I will definitely try next time."}
{"text":"I went here with a bunch of co-workers last week.  The food was really good and the service was great.  It was fun to order about 30 different things off the menu and try everything.  The stuffed dates are probably the best thing I have ever eaten in my life.  Yeah, you're probably thinking the same thing I was - \"what the hell is a date and why is she stuffed\"...but trust me, worth trying (a few).

It was really crowded and loud.  I wouldn't suggest going here unless you are in a group of 6-8+.  The parking lot of horrible, but it is shared with about five other places...it's Vegas, what did you expect."}
{"text":"Our waiter provided menus and a complimentary plate of olives, bread and an almond cream cheese spread.  The first order included a pair of mojitos (4.5), the mandatory bacon wrapped dates in a red wine reduction and blue cheese (4.5) and a disappointing roasted beet salad (2).  Our next order was a mushroom tart (puff pastry and boursin cheese) that burst with flavor (4.5) and a seafood paella (3.5).  We finished our meal with a banana nutella sandwich (4) while watching the FSE light show."}
{"text":"This is bar none the best restaurant we've been to on this vegas trip.  $3 margaritas, $3.5 mojitos, etc at happy hour made us extremely happy.  Great drinks at cheap prices.  Those happy hours on the strip can't compare to their drinks.  The food blew my expectations away.  Stuffed dates, diablo shrimp, paella, skewers were all freakin awesome.  The filet mignon sliders weren't bad either.  To top it all off, the service was great.  What more could you ask for in a restaurant?  Don't waste your money on the strip, save it for here, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Food was delicious, as always but the service was NOT good. Our waitress was named Rachael I think? Something like that, idk. Took 10 minutes to even come to the table. My boyfriend and I side tipped the busser. He did all the work. If I didn't LOVE Firefly, you can bet I'd never go there again."}
{"text":"Oh, Firefly...where do I start? Before I walked in the door last night, I had a four-star history with this place. When I walked out the door, it was more two-star worthy. So I'm splitting the difference at three.

We ordered white sangria at the bar while waiting for a table. We got red sangria from a bartender who clearly did not want to be there. We like red and didn't want to be rude, so we stuck with it.  Whatever.

I decided to try different food than I've ordered in the past. Big mistake. First, the Tomato Toasts. I added manchego cheese for an extra dollar. Which I thought was a bargain for one of my favorite cheeses. I got a plate of stale bread with a can of crushed tomato slopped on top. And I'm pretty sure that was monterey jack cheese that had been sitting out for a little too long.

I usually get their lamb sausage, and it's always been delicious. But, stupid me, it was \"try something new\" night. So I asked for the lamb skewers. It did have some tasty pieces, but it also had globs of gristle. It wasn't a complete disaster, but I'd never order it again.

The dessert was pretty great. We had the chocolate-cherry bread pudding. This was also the only time our server seemed excited about her job. She gushed over the bread pudding, and she was right. The rest of the night, she talked to the table next to us about the interview she'd just been on, and the follow-up interview she missed because she was too drunk to show up. We never have gone there for the service, but last night was especially bad. It's fine if you're looking for another job, but at least act like you want to show up to the one you have. Between her and the bartender, it was just a sad scene.

I used to love you, Firefly."}
{"text":"I have been to Firefly more times than I can remember. It's the place for old friends to reunite and for new friends to bond over delicious sangria and food. The concept of tapas is just really fun. It's even more fun when you have several people and can try a little of everything. My only peeve about this location is the parking (which I believe they recently solved by providing more parking in the back of the building complex, however, in that part of town and at night, no thank you) and the small, cramped space that is the restaurant. Besides that, LOVE IT.

These are my go-to menu items that I order basically EVERY time I visit:
FIREFLY FRIES: Nothing special about the fries themselves, however the parmesan, herbs, and seasonings that they throw on it? YUM. It's also served with their menu-popular aioli. It's pretty amazing.
STUFFED DATES: What can you hate about a date stuffed with creamy bleu cheese and a smoked almond, wrapped in bacon, and roasted in the oven, then served with a perfectly-sweet red wine reduction? Yeah, nothing.
EMPANADA: Every culture offers some sort of pastry stuffed with meat and/or vegetables that is baked, fried, or boiled and it is always delicious. This one does not disappoint with its roasted pork, red peppers, topped with aioli, and served with a tangy salad. When you're done eating it, your only complaint will be that there was just ONE.
TUNA TARTARE: A delicious stack of raw tuna with avocado, mixed with a soy sauce concoction and served with crispy taro chips! A light and fun dish.
PAELLA: I understand that I will never know the true meaning of paella until I venture to Spain (as I'm told by my well-traveled friends), but of all the restaurants that I've had paella, this is one of the best. It has all your main players like chorizo, chicken, calamari, mussels, etc and of course, the heart: saffron rice. It's served in the pot that it's cooked in, so it's hot until you leave.

All the sangria choices are delicious, but my personal favorite is definitely the SPARKLING SANGRIA. I love having carbonation in my beverage and this is sweet and delicious. Go before 6 pm (I'm not sure when it starts) and you can enjoy half off your pitcher during their Happy Hour!

I have been twice since my Vegan/Vegetarian journey has begun, so my meals have been significantly different. Sadly, there's only a couple Vegan (non-confirmed, just assumed) tapas and besides one, all salads. Not exciting at all. So, I decided that if I wanted to eat, I had to consume some dairy. I've tried: ARTICHOKE TOASTS: artichoke hearts with aioli, basil, pepper on their delicious toasted bread, very good; VEGGIES AND LENTILS: Just meh and totally could have done without it (the one rare, possibly, Vegan dish); VEGGIE EMPANADA: Also just meh - the cream cheese was overwhelming and I had no desire to finish it; PATATAS BRAVAS: Very yummy, but spicy, so you've been warned. 

Therefore, being restricted to a Vegetarian/Vegan diet makes this place very bland. It's still one of my favorite restaurants, so maybe one day we can meet (meat) again.

BTW, all three locations in the valley accept reservations except on Fridays and Saturdays (I'm sure there are other exceptions like holidays perhaps). So if it's the weekend, ensure you arrive early if you're dining with a large group or try a weekday!"}
{"text":"I'm really kicking myself for not remembering exactly what I got here. It was something like filet mignon sliders and some type of shrimp diablo. Usually, I forget what I order because the food was bland and/or gross. This time I forgot because it was a late, Thursday night after a transcontinental flight, and I was eating with a cousin I see only once every 4-5 years. I was so confused from being both tired and excited that I barely remember eating.

What I do remember is this place was packed!! Our food did taste great (whatever it was) and came with nice portions and reasonable prices. This was a much better experience with Spanish/Mexican food than my almost fail with Cabo Wabo on the Vegas strip. The place is literally a few blocks away from The Hard Rock Hotel, and. it's worth a cab ride from the strip there. Also, they have an excellent mojito!"}
{"text":"When the most recent health inspection debacle revealed the same offenses (food handling, contamination, hand washing) as inspections in the past, it sent a message. It was a blatant disregard for the public's health and safety. It stung more because I was very adamant about forgiveness and continued to patronize their restaurants after the salmonella incident. I've never had a food poisoning issue, but now it felt like a gamble to dine with them. I've made a choice to not support a business that has repeated offenses of this nature (regardless of what they claim is not their fault) based on principle.

My recent visit was prompted by the celebration of a good friend's graduation. We joined her and her family on their vacation to Las Vegas (I had forewarned them about the events). In any case, our dining experience was mostly pleasant and I was admitedly excited to eat some of my favorite dishes again. 

The hostess was kind enough to accomodate our large group in one of their semi-private dining booths/tables with drapes (although these proved difficult for the servers and bussers since they had to constantly move them to reach the table). Everyone was really friendly, but service was just okay. Several times we were searching for our server or anyone to come to our aid or just replenish water.

The food was still as delicious as I remember. My favorites being the Stuffed Dates, Firefly Fries, Paella (mixed), and Pork Empanada. The only disappointment was the Tuna Tartare, which was also an old favorite. But overall, I enjoyed my meal. Also, I really liked the Chocolate Tres Leches Cake.

So, the food is still good and service is okay. Doesn't change how I feel about the business and their owners. Dine at your own risk."}
{"text":"Love the concept, and love this place!  Tapas are the way to go to sample small dishes with lots of flavor.  Firefly is trendy, but the food is good and the atmosphere is great.  This location is a little quieter and a little less crowded than the strip location.  Love it!"}
{"text":"SO in love with Firefly! 

I know this place catches a lot of crap for it's mistakes in the past BUT Firefly is actually one of the better restaurants in Las Vegas these days (in my book). 

I love the atmosphere and energy at Firefly; the service is always great and the food comes out quick. I take newbies to Firefly all the time and it really is because the food is so creative, flavorful, and impressive. 
I have a ton of favs at Firefly that I typically order but am never disappointed when trying something new (lots of options on the menu). 

*Things to note
-Infused potato vodka with lychees and berries..YUM. 
-Pitchers of Sangria are perfect for a group. 
-Manchango & apple salad- looks plain but full of flavor. 
-Any of the empanadas are delightful. 
-Salmon bagels are excellent 
-All the skewers are tasty, especially the shrimp and ahi. 
-Tomato basil soup with the little sandwich is great comfort food
-BACON WRAPPED DATES are a must-do. 
-Flour-less chocolate cake 
 And I have yet to try stuff off the brunch menu but will sooner than later (especially the lemon blueberry pancakes).  
-Unlimited mimosas and bloody's on Sunday for $20"}
{"text":"Firefly has possibly the best sangria I've had in my entire life! I came here during my most recent Vegas trip (annual sorority pledge class trip), and it didn't disappoint. Normally, I only love red wine sangria, but the white and sparkling here were both excellent, as well. The tapas are decent, but I'd come here again for the drinks!"}
{"text":"Another 6 star if I could!! No this is not my first time at Firefly so I can write a well rounded review. However, every single time I go to Vegas I make sure that I stop at Firefly for some of their stuffed dates, mar y tierra skewers, their sangria (fave is red) and calamari. This is ohhh so good and it's not uber expensive if you were eating on the strip or a buffet. This last time was for a bachlorette fiesta and we had 13 guests. The drinks were flowing and the food was coming and the bill was less than $400 (with tip). AND we order desert. Not bad if you ask me especially since we had at least 8 pitchers of sangria. 

Hit up Firefly is you want something different that wont cost you mega bucks."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly staff, they know the menu well, all of the drinks and food they suggested was awesome. Great for a group of people willing to share. New place to visit every time I come to Vegas."}
{"text":"Good food. Good atmosphere. Good service. The tapas are the best. I would go back and eat here every night if I could..."}
{"text":"My friend has been trying to get us to go here for quite some time & we finally did!  When we walked up to the door it looked like there was going to be a wait, but luckily we were seated right away.  It was a shame though that I wasn't feeling very well because I had been overeating (expected in Vegas I know), but I still managed to nibble on some of their delicious tapas.  Bf & I shared the: stuffed mushrooms, the sliders, & Firefly fries.  My friend had the bacon wrapped dates & the anchovy toasts both of which she loves.   My only gripe about the menu is that it seems like at least 90% of the entrees have cheese!  I'm not lactose, but I can be dairy sensitive, especially when going through the torture of eating so much in Vegas.  Dishes came out fast.  Everything was tasty and prices and portion sizes were decent (which I usually don't see with tapas)!  I even lost one of my little mushrooms which rolled towards the next table & one of the staff members saw and brought me another one.  How's that for customer service?

I wish we had a Firefly here in the Bay Area.  Their menu and service is a lot better than Cha Cha Cha.  Next time sangria for sure!"}
{"text":"Reservations were made using Open Table and when we arrived, I had to show them the email confirmation.  The hostess didn't show us in the system and the place is quite small, (we were told in advance we needed reservations due to the size), after showing the email, she seemed putt off with us, but eventually sat us. We had a party of three and all of us differ in what we prefer for good eats.  Firefly satisfied all, immensely. That's the joy of a Tapas bar, you can order several items, get a small taste of everything as a opposed to one huge meal that you may or may not enjoy and have to get through.  

Bacon wrapped stuffed dates and the Shrimp, Steak, and Chorizo Skewers in Salsa Verde being the highlight of all the tapas ordered.  We also ordered a pitcher of Red Sangria (recommended by another bar tender on the strip) and were surprised by the flavor in it.  The waiter mentioned that they let the Sangria sit a few days to allow the fruity flavors to come out, quite delicious.

I am looking forward to another trip to Firefly when I'm in town next time."}
{"text":"Everything we tried was deeeeeeelish ! And everything else on the menu sounded equally as yummy.

Service was friendly, although a tad unattentive. But they were so busy, it's understandable.

Definitely coming back next time we're in town! Totally worth going that mile off the strip. (;"}
{"text":"It seems to be that everywhere you go, tapas is the hot new topic. Small plates are awesome. You can have as many plates as you want, and variety makes us all happy. You don't have to order 1 dish and be stuck with it. If you order one wrong dish, you at least have 3 other ones that are good. Tapas is shareable, and at one sitting, you can easily have tried 10 different dishes. For those saving money or not too hungry, its a good way to save money and just get snacking items. It doesn't seem like tapas is going away anytime soon. Firefly in Las Vegas, not too far from the strip. They have some of the best tapas in Vegas, and the atmosphere is very relaxing. Stumbling upon this spot, I could only wishttp://www.dinedelish.com/wp-admin/edit.phph it were on the strip, inside the comforts of a resort.

Their stuffed dates were on point. Wrapped in bacon, the salty and the sweet was working perfectly together. Also stuffed with smoked almonds, it gave it a nice nutty flavor as well as a good crunch. A sprinkle of blue cheese made everything round out nicely. When you are talking about tapas, stuffed dates is automatically in the conversation. The ones at Firefly were nothing short or spectacular. The red wine reduction was a nice touch to the stuffed dates. This is a must order when you are at Firefly.

The filet minon sliders were surprisingly tasty. Topped with blue cheese and fried onion straws, the sliders were rich. The fried onions gave it a good crunch, and the cheese is what gave it a nice flavor. If the cheese didn't do it in the flavor department, their south western style sauce topped it all off. With filet minon being the patty, you know it was going to be soft and juicy. The patty had a nice crust on the outside, and the inside was juicy and not dry at all. This was a perfect little slider combination.

My favorite was the tierra y mar skewers. Skewers with grilled shrimp, filet minon, and chorizo sausage was a perfect trifecta of flavors and textures. Drizzled with a nice salsa verde on top, each bite was perfectly different on its own. The filet minon was uber tender and though it didn't have a lot of fat, it contained so much flavor. The shrimp was grilled to a nice crisp and was a match made in heaven when eaten with the chorizo. Everything seemed to work together in this -- as if the shrimp had the beef's back, and the chorizo had the shrimp's back. Obviously, pork chorizo sausage can hold its own. This is a must order. Maybe a double up would help so that you can have your own plate.

Firefly was awesome. Despite not being on the strip, it isn't that bad. Basically a block behind the strip, it isn't too far off. The food is done right and the tapas allowed me to snack on the cheap. Yes. All that was a snack, not lunch. All kidding aside, Firefly is the place to be if you want small plates. I went during the day so it was quite mellow. I'm sure it gets somewhat rowdy at night as it turns into a lounge after hours. Either way, you will get your tapas the most delicious way possible."}
{"text":"7 girls + 18 dishes + 2 pitchers of Sangria = a tummy full of HAPPINESS!!

Went on a girls reunion trip with the UCLA girls to Vegas and we knew we wanted to have a good dinner meal for Saturday. With no idea what to get, the lovely May suggested Firefly. We heard it could be busy so we called to see if we could make reservations but they told us it wasn't that busy around 6:30 which was the time we wanted to go and that it gets busy later at night (very true). 

The atmostphere is awesome. It's dim with red accents, and there's latin dance type of music playing. Right when we walked in I had already seen two of the waiters/waitresses dancing a little- it was very cute. 

So we sat down, and decided to order whatever we felt like because either way it would have been cheaper than if we had decided to go to Joel Robuchon's restaurant in the MGM (which I definitely want to try). 

Here's what we ordered- 

1. 2 plates stuffed dates ----soooo good
2. 2 plates manchego mac & cheese- pretty good but not the best of all the dishes
3. 2 plates of chorizo & chicken stuffed mushrooms
4.  ceviche shrimp- very good
5. Thai beef salad
6. petite filet
7. lambchops
8. spicy lamb sausage
9. mussels
10. shrimp diabla 
11. paella
12. ham and cheese croquetas
13. tuna tartare
14. chocolate cherry bread pudding
15. dessert platter

My favorites- stuffed dates, the ceviche, the petite filet, stuffed mushrooms, ham and cheese croquetas, lamb sausage & Paella- the paella is very good to get and large enough to share with a lot of people. 

My least favorites- the tuna tartare (tasted a little funny, we think they added mayo or something to it) and the lambchops (didn't have that lamb flavor). 

and of course the chocolate bread pudding was very good with ice cream. 

The dent- only $35 per girl with tip. A lot better than the minimum of at least $100 at Robuchon =)"}
{"text":"Bacon wrapped dates - were just ok I've had better and the peanut inside threw me for a loop thought I was chewing on a bone 

Mussels- were very good! Tangy and perfectly sauced 

Tierra y mar skewers - amazing steak cooked to perfection flavors meld together with the green salsa 

Grilled scallops - not too great had a very fishy taste to them which seeped into the potatoes when your food all taste the same as the main part of the meal it's no bueno."}
{"text":"First off, make sure you get a reservation on the weekend and give yourself 10 mins to find parking.  The cabbies are nuts in this parking lot and will attempt to run you over!

I have only been to one other Tapas restuarant, but compared to that one, this place had very small portions.  I know they are supposed to be small, but come on!!  The chicken skewers...it was like 3 sticks each with a piece of chicken the size of my pinky!  Everything tasted good...but small portions.
 
Here is what we got:
Calamari - This was SO GOOD!  But we had to order 3 servings for 8 of us to get enough of it!
Shrimp Tempura - Yum
Beef Skewers - Yum but barely any meat
Chicken Skewers - Ditto beef skewers
Clams - Yum
Duck Rolls - They were okay...but could be that I don't like duck all that much either
There was more but can't remember, LOL!

Oh and it was a friend's b-day and they gave him a complimentry shot (not sure what it was) and flan!  Better than the resturant at Luxor that gave him shit the night before at midnight..."}
{"text":"Had an amazing time here yesterday with about 6 of my \"mommy\" friends. We drank..we ate..we drank some more. This place is perfect for a big group like ours was. We chilled out on the U shaped sofas. Our server was great & took excellent care of us. I drank my usual watermelon mojitos. They were perfect. And I ate the stuffed dates & shrimp ceviche. They were both perfect as well. I cant wait to come back here again!"}
{"text":"I have a special love for this place.  It's extremely tasty, and a really good medium between casual and formal dining.  Want to go out someplace after a show, but you can control the price?   Good place to go.  Want someplace to meet a friend for lunch.  Good, too.

Only downer is the lack of gluten free and vegetarian options.  Being a tapas restaurant, you need as many options as you can get with your petit portions.  As for Vegas's normal vibe, this is a different change of pace.

The tomato soup is really yummy.  Make sure you make reservations."}
{"text":"\"Firefly\" is somewhat of a misplaced moniker choice since it invokes memories of the excellent, if short lived Joss Whedon sci-fi series.

Overall, a very simply, and elegantly designed restaurant.  In a city where excess and flash are norms, Firefly provides a refreshing milieu.  I got the feeling that it caters less to tourists, but rather to the local white collar work force.

Our lunch menu was a assembled tapas selection.  There were enough choices to cobble together an expansive meal, yet not too large as to be overwhelming.  

The obligatory free appetizer consisted of toasted baguette slices with green garlic olives and sweet jalapeno butter.  These was also a good and extensive selection of Tazo teas.

Some examples of sampled food: (the good)
Mushrooms stuffed with chorizo:
Garlicy shrimp (came with plenty of sauce)
Potato bravas (less spicy than usual, and much tastier)
Tuna Tartar (not technically a traditional Tapa, but a good variation on the neo classic dish)

The mediocre:
Artichoke hearts on toast (tasted too canned)
Gazpacho (lacked definition)"}
{"text":"Only came here for desserts, which was pretty good but the service was awful. Two servers went to the table next to us and asked if this was their order, they said no and we said we think it's ours over and over again. The servers immediately got confused and nervous. Finally, he put in on our table and I think he thumbed one of our desserts.

On the tab:
Banana-nutella Sandwiches
Dessert Platter

Yum to both. Enough said"}
{"text":"Once again Yelp was right! We went to Firefly the first night we got to Vegas. Didn't have a reservation but got a table in less than 10mins. First we sat at the bar and ordered the Mango Mojito. I finally found a place that has really good Mango Mojitos that's comparable to the ones I had in Miami, FL. I wish I could order the jug, but that would be way too much for just me and my partner

Here is what we ordered:

Bacon wrapped dates
Mushroom tarts
Spicy beef salad
Ham and cheese croquettes
Roasted Chicken with fries (entree)

And we received complementary toasts with olives and butter type aioli (I think that's what it was). Well whatever the spread was it was so good! So tasty! I slathered my toasts with it.

Wow, everything we ordered tasted so good! The mushroom tarts were huge! I was imagining small tartlets made in mini muffin tins, but instead was 2 large triangle puff pastry with creamy mushroom sauce over it. So filling! 

The roasted chicken, was half a chicken!!! and it was ONLY $14. The portion size was very generous. 

Total bill, about $50 for 2, tax and tip included, minus the mojitos, since they were paid at the bar and I forgot how much they costs, $7 each I think? 

Would definately recommend the place! Like others have said, nice place to go as a group, but also nice place to eat for two."}
{"text":"My sister and I hit up this place before exploring downtown and there is no better way to start an evening than at Firefly.

The decor and the great glass windows make for a comfortable, yet sexy dinner. The view is of Fremont street and if you get there at the right time you'll get to watch the light show.

The mojitos here are AMMMAAAAAAZZZZINNNNGG.  Our cutie waiter recommended the Pomegranate and he did not steer us wrong.  I like to think mojitos are good for me, especially pom ones.  I get mint, that's good for digestion and pomegranate, super fruit! Possibly good for you, super delicious, and a pitcher well get you feelin' fine.

The food here, equally as amazing. I love tapas style eating and is perfect for trying new dishes and sharing with friends.  The manchego mac and cheese is the ish and I could eat an entire vat of the artichoke hearts. 

If you're traipsing around downtown or need a mojito fix, I highly suggest you come here."}
{"text":"Food was excellent. Service was very good. To our surprise they even have a happy hour on Satursdays and Sundays until 6 pm. Drinks are 50% off."}
{"text":"this is my go to spot... I used to go to the Sahara location every week until they shut down... Now my only option is the Paradise location... Luckily I work at the Howard Hughes Center across the street. I'm not being paid attention to by the waitress at the bar... I asked for a menu so clearly that means I want to order food, but she has yet asked to take my order, and she's standing right in front of me!!! I'm a bit disappointed. It's now been 30mins...It's happy hour but she isn't busy... How do I know this? Because Im sitting at the bar and she's standing right in front of me looking cute and doing nothing. I'm going to pay for my one drink (even tho I want several more as well as food) and I'm going to leave to go somewhere else. Very sad. Smh"}

{"text":"We came here almost every night during our stay in Vegas and the food was absolutely amazing every time. There wasn't any dish that we did not like (and we tried a lot of them). The staff is very friendly and attentive and even on the most busiest nights dining here we seemed to have gotten all our food VERY fast! They waste absolutely no time when it comes to customer service. Well done!"}
{"text":"Sangria, Sangria!

Along with many of the other places, Firefly is bomb.com!  Definitely a place you can come with a party...to party.  With awesome food, service and ambiance, a good time is to be had!

No matter how many people you come with, you can expect them to enjoy their experience.  Don't worry about ordering, everyone can order something different and pass the plates around.  A favorite of mine is patatas bravas, veggie empanada, firefly fries, and mac n cheese.  That mac n cheese I won't share.  Get your own, you won't regret it. Along with the food, the drinks are tasty too.  Can't go wrong with sangria.  Red sangria is really good.  If you plan to have more than 1 drink, order a pitcher.

Service here, I hate to say, could be better.  My friends and I were seated right away, but service after that was slowww. And we were sitting at the bar, where someone is always there.  We ordered through someone other than our waiter, because he was a lil too busy.  But other than that, I enjoyed myself.

Fridays at 10:30pm is Latin night.  Salsa! So much fun.  I love watching the really experienced dancers.  The fluidity of their movements is amazing.  Some of them incorporating flips and special turns in their routines.  And they all switch partners.  Don't be surprised if someone come to you while your dancing."}
{"text":"I use to frequent the old location on Paradise quite a bit but had not been to the new location yet...I like it much better.  The space is bigger and every area feels much more open.  I didn't have any food at this last visit but we did have a couple of pitchers or Sparkling Sangria, still my favorite.  The ambience is great, love the music they play and will go back soon to have some bacon wrapped dates which are exquisite from what I remember."}
{"text":"Love this place, went here with a buddy from LA, decided to have a drink so we went to this well talked about place.  I had their Padron peppers and tuna tartare along with a bloody mary.  Great place for daytime drinks and appetizers :)  Expect to pay too much for small dishes of these delicious appetizers though..."}
{"text":"Holy Tapas, Batman! I will never again eat anywhere else in Las Vegas. Ok, that's a bit of an exaggeration. But this place knocked me off my feet. I'm in love. The food was delicious and filling, the service was great, and it was DIRT CHEAP. For ten people, the bill came to $30 a person for dinner AND drinks. And I was able to get a Red Bull Vodka for $5. That's almost unheard of in Vegas! 

Let me just give you a sampling of what we sampled. (This is a Tapas place, after all, so everything is small. But you just keep ordering and they keep throwing the plates at you and it's wonderful.) 

-Ceviche of shrimp (shrimp with avocado in a light broth)
-Stuffed dates  (I usually hate dates but i LOOOOOVED these. It's dates stuffed with bleu cheese and wrapped in bacon. DROOL.)
-Veggie empanada
-Firefly fries (with parmesan cheese, herbs, and aioli dipping sauce)
-Stuffed peppers (red bell peppers with mozarella and tomato sauce)
-Baked brie (with tomato and chorizo)
-Manchego Mac 'n' Cheese (DELISH; I'd never heard of Manchego cheese before but had it again the next day; it's kind of parmesan-ish)
-Stuffed mushrooms (with chicken and chorizo)
-Chicken skewers
-Camarones al ajillo (shrimp in lemon-garlic butter sauce)

Is your mouth watering yet? This place was fantastic, and I recommend it to anyone with taste buds."}
{"text":"Let me begin by saying i have never spoken with anyone that has given this place a bad name. Only rave reviews. From the ambience, to the wait staff to the delicious food and cocktails what more could you ask for.

We went on a Friday night around 7 with me, my hubby and toddler and my parents. Even on such a busy Friday night, the staff was very accomadating with us and our small child. 

To start off, there are so many delicious cocktails to chose from so we asked our waiter Eduardo for suggestions. We ended up with the Blueberry Mojitos which i have had before and are to die for. My husband had the Delirium beer which is a pretty strong beer but refreshing. 

Next i feel like we ordered everything off of the menu. Its pretty hard at Firefly when it comes to ordering because pretty much everything on the menu is fantastic. From the Bacon wrapped Dates to the Shrimp Diablo to the lamb chops and mussels. YUMMM! Even though you can get a little crazy ordering for dinner since there are so many fabulous options, i would highly recommend saving just a tad room for dessert. 

We went with the Tres Leche Cake and Chocolate Cherry Bread Pudding. OMG! Even though none of us had any room for either of these, we shoved them in our faces as if we had never eaten before. Man they were both to die for. So good!

 Its so refreshing to go to a hip place with a small child and have a great time and leave 100% happy.

I would suggest Firefly to any of my friends and it is especially great for groups. We came here for my 30th birthday party in December and were wowed again.

This place is GREAT!"}
{"text":"I haven't given five stars to any restaurant. Ever. This place is fantastic! Especially for the price.

I sat at the bar and my waiter was so attentive, friendly, helpful, and knew the menu well. I went solely off his recommendations. When he found out it was my first time there, he was very welcoming and enthusiastic.

I had the stuffed dates...amazing. It's a small plate, but I guarantee you won't want to share! I also had the petit fillet, which melted in my mouth. I was bummed that I didn't have more people with me so that we could try more food....but those two small plates filled me up!

I will DEFINITELY be back! 

PS If you have more than one in your party, best to make a reservation...it was packed!"}
{"text":"Gross... I saw my server outside smoking and walked straight back into the kitchen... I 
Watched him take plates to be served out to the main room without washing... Good food is one thing, bad cleanliness is another."}
{"text":"Beyond excellent!  Everything was delicious and eye candy as well.   Lamb chops were remarkable as was the Pulpo. I can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love Firefly and am so glad Rachael Ray introduced me to it two years ago.  I make sure to come every time I'm in Vegas and this past visit, my boyfriend and I came here three times, lol.

My favorite dishes:
~ Camarones a la Diabla: OMG!!  Best shrimp ever.  I love their spicy sauce and am so glad they give you the plate of complimentary bread so I can mop up all the leftover sauce.  Actually, the sauce would make anything taste good.  A must try!!
~ Firefly Fries: Lots of garlic and parmesan cheese ~ delish!
~ Paella: rice is tasty and they don't skimp on the seafood.
~ Steamed Mussels: it comes in a coconut curry sauce that is good enough to drink.  Not very spicy but good curry flavor.  Mussels are very fresh and steamed to perfection.

Other recommended dishes:
~ Patatas Bravas
~ Stuffed Dates
~ Fried Calamari
~ Empanadas

Not so good dishes:
~ Baked Brie: I think I didn't enjoy it much because the cheese wasn't as hot as I expected it to be and it wasn't that special.
~ Terra y Mare Skewers: the filet mignon was really dry and wasn't very tasty in general.
~ Tuna Tartare: the tuna was in huge chunks and not marinated enough.
~ Caramel Flan: meh...I've had better flan, texture wasn't very smooth.

Overall, still a great tapas place  Prices are pretty reasonable and it's just great being able to try a bunch of small dishes and not having to fill up on an entree.  Great place to have a few drinks and kick back with some friends or to have a romantic date.  Yay for Firefly!"}
{"text":"This is by far the Best Tapas I have had before.  It seemed like a local hang out and went with 2 of my brothers that lived there.  I liked the atmosphere and the price was pretty reasonable for the size of the portions.  I will be coming back for sure next time I am in town."}
{"text":"Firefly man I love this place. Food orgy time yet again.  I discovered it via a friends recommendation last time I was in vegas and now it is an essential part to any great vegas vacation. First time to the new location which is a stones throw from the old location. I like the larger size but miss some of the character of the old building. 

They have a great mojito and a even better happy hour M-F 3-6. Unfortunately the happy hour is only for drinks. I also enjoyed one of my favorite craft beers rouge hazelnut its only 3$ during happy hour.

We brought a few friends along and stayed for several drinks and hours. It was definitely one of the highlights of our trip. The standouts wrrr the majitos we had both a pitcher and a few extra glasses. It is a little better in a glass the flavors are better proportioned. The sliders and dates were my two favorite dishes. I really enjoyed the shrimp, empanadas, stuffed mushrooms and firefly fishsticks. The only dish I would pass on was the scallop as they were rather fishy. 

I feel the best way to experience firefly is with good service,  friends, drinks and great food."}
{"text":"I love everything about Firefly. The food, the ambiance, the drinks. It's such a great place to go when you're in the mood for drinks. I can't imagine going here and not ordering food though. My favorite tapas are the stuffed dates and the warm spinach salad. For drinks I prefer their red sangria and mango mojito. I've been meaning to try their sparkling sangria since I've heard it's delicious as well. This is a place I am always up for going to. Easily one of my favorite places in town."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. We had reservations for a Monday night and were promptly seated and asked what we wanted to drink. I had an amazing ginger pear martini that was out or this world, and my date had a mojito that was also impressive. I was disappointed that they ran out of pear purée for a second ginger pear martini, but ended up having a mojito myself.

The food here is some of my favorite in Vegas. Favorites included the plate of Serano ham and Manchego cheese, steak and mushroom skewers, and lamb chops. Also good was the veggie empanadas, grilled scallops, and the chorizo plate. 

The atmosphere is good, always have pretty decent customer service, and the plates are priced well considering the quality. You will need a few plates per person so it can add up, but you definitely get what you pay for. Most people I know really like this place. I did come here in summer 2013 and it definitely improved from the first visit. I would come back again no doubt."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! We celebrated my birthday here a couple nights ago and everything was so delicious! Some of my favorites are: manchego salad, bacon wrapped dates, camarones a la diabla and you have to have the tres leches for dessert!"}
{"text":"This is a perfect spot for a large group: everyone gets to sample a little sumthin sumthin and no one feels like they have to commit to too much food.  

I was in a group of 7 girls and we each ordered 2 rounds of tapas, all of which were really good.  The two items that stood out were the firefly fries and the stuffed dates.  OMG- the stuffed dates were 2 DIE 4!!!!  I'm not a big date eater...who really is??? But I was shocked as hell when a friend insisted that I try one...since I initially didn't want to waste the space in my tummy with one of these.  The dates were stuffed with almonds, wrapped around with bacon and topped off with blue cheese. 
Yum Yum Yum!!!

Oh- and i can't forget the drinkies.  We ordered a pitcher of red and a pitcher of white Sangria.  I've had better Sangrias elsewhere, but between the two at Firefly, I preferred the red.  My girlfriends were grubbing on the fruit at the bottom of their glasses and leaving the wine....go figure!?!?!  

Overall, this is a great place, especially for the wallet.  With the approximate 14+ orders + drinks + tax + tip, divided by 6 girls (exluding the bachelorette), we paid $30 each.  NOT BAD AT ALL!"}
{"text":"I was lucky enough to be a part of a private wedding party at Firefly last week. Holly mother of all that is awesome this place is great! 

The atmosphere is Vegas lounge-esk and lets you sit back and relax while you're served tapas and drinks in a club like environment. 

We sampled almost every plate they offered throughout the evening and I was never let down. The stuffed dates will be the last meal I have before my dirt nap...seriously they were that good. 

The staff was super friendly and the bartenders were well trained. The blueberry vodka mojitos are incredible despite them being anything close to a traditional mojito. Nothing but love for this place and it's staff. You have to go here while you're in Vegas."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!!  I have experienced both sitting inside at the bar as well as eating outside in the summer. Today I sat at the bar and they had three bartenders on staff. I ordered the warm spinach salad, bacon wrapped dates and the mini filet sliders. All very good :) I will be back."}
{"text":"I've been to their other location on Paradise Rd. a few other times before, but the boyfriend and I decided to try this new location. We were surprised that this location was pretty spacious compared to the other one. The atmosphere is similiar to the other location. However the food was AWESOME! We had Stuffed Dates (always order this when we go there), Fried Calamari, Ahi Tuna Skewers, Lamb Skewers, Lobster Escargot and a pitcher of the Red Sangria. Oh! and we also had a small plate of bread with olives & butter. (yummy!!!) YES! That was a lot of food for 2, but as parents on a date night it was a must! Haha! I LOVE their food, but when someone mentions Firefly's, I automatically think SANGRIA!!!"}
{"text":"It is fantastic. I was brought here on a trip to Vegas a few years ago and was blown away by this place.  Whenever I go to an awesome restaurant, I stare at the menu wanting to order half the things on there.  Finally I could!! The Sangria was incredible as well.  In fact, I can't really remember what food I had on that first trip because the sangria was so good...anyhow.....fast-forward to last weekend....back in Vegas and back to Firefly.

 I was pretty worried as I was bringing someone new here and I had been hyping the place for the whole drive from LA and figured it probably had gone to shit over the past couple years like many restaurants do. Nope! It was awesome, again.

Garden Salad = win
Mac & Cheese = win
Tetilla = win
Steak & Mushroom Skewer = win
Bacon wrapped dates = win

all that stuff totaled like $30, which I know I am biased coming from LA, but that is amazing. Now hurry up and open one of these in SFV!"}
{"text":"Love the first Firefly*, love this one too.  There are a few differences of course, but the food, drink and atmosphere are all great. 

Happy hour is nice, all drinks, not just 4-5 things like other places around.  All in all it's great, maybe better than the first just because I can drive home in minutes from here.

Welcome to the neighborhood Firefly!"}
{"text":"So I guess this is Tapas Day. So Firefly - I've driven by so many times - Saw it on Rachel Ray's $40 a day....Hmmm finally went there and was quite impressed. BTW THERE IS NO THAI BEEF SALAD IN SPAIN. Whatever and your tapas fusion. Overall - great atmosphere. A little Loud....Drinks are delish. Hmmm Reading all reviews...I'm just gonna copy and paste everyone's to make my own :) Mwahahaha Behold Plagerism!!!
A great, inexpensive, off the Strip dining choice for Spanish tapas.
AN extra star because they are open until 2 a.m. but minus a half a star because they don't tell you when you call that you need reservations even at 11:30 at night.  Firefly is a welcome alternative to the overpriced strip restaurants and clubs.  This is where all of the local crowd hangs out.  It's up the street from the Hard Rock, quick cab-ride from the strip.  Great food, hip but relaxed atmosphere.  Open late with DJ's and more of a bar/loungey crowd the later it gets.  
BTW, I realized that if you say \"I'm going to a tapas bar\" that it sounds like something not so innocent.  Good for a laugh or two (but gets old very quick).  It's also a handy way to find out how dirty your friends are.
So, Firefly is becoming a weekend tradition with my crew.  And even more exciting....John (the restaurants owner/chef) has opened a sequel next door called Dragonfly...we'll talk about that later.

Tapas is a treat, literally.  And the best way to pigout with friends for less money that you would expect. It's like ordering a table full of appetizers.   Hmmm....like TGI Friday's, but good.

Firefly friend pleaser's.......Jug O' Red Sangria
                                              Baked Brie and/or Cheese & Meat Plate
                                              Empanadas

Yummy and way fun to share.  An awesome bar.  Thankfully a bar that knows how to make a kick ass martini.  Cuz when the Sangria is gone you might as well kick it up a notch. BAM!!!

And it sports a pleasing trendy atmosphere at Happy Hour.  Believe me....wall to wall SHINY HAPPY PEOPLE.   Men who use product, and the women who love them.  Wink, wink. 
Mwahahaha and that is my review completely not plagerized and true...
No Really I knocked it for the crowdedness, and noise levels, oh and for we had really crappy seats when we went....table small. Myke SMASH...."}
{"text":"This is another staple spot for me in Las Vegas. As I am usually here on business, my company has me stay close to the convention center. Not that I wouldn't make the journey across town to Firefly in any other case, but it is convenient that it is right down Paradise. Here's what's up:

Food: This is a tapas bar. We usually just order like crazy and sample sample sample everything that ends up on the table. Here's the thing: you could throw 10 darts at the menu, order whatever you hit, and you'll be happy. Don't get me wrong there are some things that are better than others but seriously everything is legit. My biggest suggestion are the sliders. 

Beverages: Like most places in Vegas, there's no good beer. It's a harsh reality that I have come to except. They have some in between beers and a few good cocktails, but certainly do not come here for the flow of quality liquid.

Environment: It makes sense that Firefly has a very Spanish feel to it. It's a tapas bar after all. I'm a fan of how communal the layout is. In the tradition of everyone sharing food, Firefly has a very intimate feel where you are not necessarily 'packed in', but the feeling of being close to everyone promotes the idea of being 'one' and encouraging the idea of sharing. Sort of like most Ethiopian restaurants- where you're all eating from the same plate and the conversations occur in a very raw, intimate setting.

Certainly an 'off strip' gem that is worth checking out. Be prepared to eat lots!

Salud!"}
{"text":"Amazing food!!! Came here on a Monday night date night and couldn't be more happier that we chose this place! The ambience is great and the food is delicious! Yum yum!"}
{"text":"i give it 5 stars because i like ambiance. The tapas are delicious and the price is very very reasonable, the manager was very friendly and accommodating, he comped our dinner because we found a hair in our paella but it was still delicious!"}
{"text":"Party of 12 please...

We had a huge group and arriving to firefly was a hassle. Most taxi companies allow 4-5 people per car, so we drove in style... Party of 12 in a nice stretch out hummer. The driver was cool asking us what kind of music we like. We dance in our limo ride to firefly and was it fun!! 

The ambiance of the restaurant is dim makes it romantic. LOL. Service was good.

Anyways back to firefly....I'd recommend making reservations for big groups and in general so you wouldnt have to wait that long. We had a prefixe menu so we had a variety of appetizers and 3 desserts.

A must try items...
Ceviche of shrimp - Delicious but has a lot of lemon juice.

Stuffed dates - Bacon wrapped dates with blue cheese. Delicious but not a fan of blue cheese.

Patatas bravas - love how the spicy aioli is smothered on the potatoes. Not too spicy.

Mushroom tart - Delicious mushroom tart especially the cheese!!

Filet mignon sliders - These sliders was delicious!! especially the fried onions on the side..

Babyback ribs - sweet and smoky yum!!!

Fried calamari - Love the dipping sauce mildly spicy yum!!

Crispy duck rolls - Delicious, savory egg roll. 

and for Dessert we got offered a dessert platter of Flan- rich and creamy. Cheesecake and chocolate tres leches cake yum!! And the Lemon-berry tart - a little bit tart."}
{"text":"I loved the food! Portions are bigger then what you expect from tapas and the flavor was truly Southern Spanish. They are open late, until 2am with excellent happy hour prices for a few good tapas 11pm to close. An awesome place to recover after the strip ;)"}
{"text":"I've been to both this one and the Firefly on Paradise Rd. The deliciousness of the food is consistent. The alcohol was too strong for my liking, and the host could have used a slight attitude adjustment, but it was definitely good eats. I'd recommend this place to anyone and go back for more yummy tapas."}
{"text":"Firefly has a lot of potential, but is short on the customer service. I made a reservation for 7:00pm and received a phone call that if I was not in the restaurant by 7:02, my reservation would be given away. Well, good thing I like to be on time. In fact, my husband and I were at the restaurant by 6:45pm. We were then told that we had to wait until closer to 7 to be seated. Understandable. Until I noticed about two to three parties without reservations being seated before us. What's the point of making a reservation??? At 7:02, when we were walked to our table, we passed about 10 empty ones...um, ok. The three stars is for the food. It's good. Service, not so much."}
{"text":"Awesome food and better service! Just happened to stop by because it was close to our hotel and so glad we did! My wife and I both had the petite filet and it was better than some of the five star places we went. The scallops were also awesome! Very cool atmosphere it is a little loud though. We didn't mind, just wanted to mention that it isn't the best place for a quiet date. You can find people dressed up for a bachelor/bachelorette party or just in jeans. Cool place with great food and service!"}
{"text":"Two stars for service. 

Food: Fried calamari - too salty; Eggplant cannelloni - too bland filled with coagulated, low quality goat cheese; Seafood paella - more like rubber disguised as seafood - was overcooked beyond belief; Chocolate tres leches - cake on top of melted ice cream it seemed

Atmosphere: not a great date place unless you want to exercise your vocal chords via yelling at your date. Excellent bar atmosphere, chill and great customer service. Overall appearance of the restaurant is great.

Best thing they can do for this place, re-train their cooks or fire the ones they have. They need new cooks. 

Overall, take your money elsewhere, this is VEGAS. You will find better."}
{"text":"Food was delicious and they had a lot of vegetarian options as well. Very quick and friendly service! A very good experience overall"}
{"text":"Amazing service. Great food, get the stuffed dates it is divine. I had my food in less then 20 minutes. Food came out perfect as ordered. Server was polite and had my drink put within 2 minuted. Would come back again any day!!! Love it here great atmosphere!!"}
{"text":"I've been a huge fan of the location on Paradise -- it's my go-to place whenever I have friends here from out of town.  It's got a good vibe and a \"locals\" feel to it.  But the best thing in my opinion is the sangria.  That's why I'm thrilled about this new location --- it's within walking distance for me!

I will admit it, I'm a girly-girl.  That's why I like the sangria.  It's light and fruity and tastes good.  But the other thing is the price.  You can get a glass for $6, a pitcher for $24.  And if you go during happy hour (3- 6 pm, weekdays), drinks are half-price!  That means you can get a pitcher for less than the price of one drink at many Las Vegas establishments.  

The food is an issue for some people -- it's hard to know how many tapas to get, especially if you're hungry or if you're planning on drinking and need something in your stomach.  That's why I think it works best to go with a group of people and split a number of dishes.  

That being said, I think everything on the menu is good.  I've never liked dates before, but the ones here are fantastic.  I'd never tried octopus before, but I get that here on a regular basis.  The mac & cheese is good, especially if there are vegetarians in your party. 

As for service, I've had both good and bad here.  It depends on the time of day and how busy the restaurant is.  I've been at 3 pm, right when happy hour starts and it's usually fine.  So I plan on being there at that time on a regular basis.  And yes, I'm going to walk so I can have as much sangria as I want!"}
{"text":"Firefly is a good place to do happy hour.... They have some pretty sweet  HH specials, and the small plates lend themselves well to snacking.  They have lots of flavored mojitos, many of which I've tried (I generally find them a bit on the sweet side) and their famous sangria at a sizeable discount. 

The food, as far as vegan choices go, is pretty limited, but tasty enough.  There's gazpacho (my fave), patatas bravas (minus the aioli), some salads that can have the cheese left off, a lentil dish, and a large plate pasta.  You can fill up if you get three or four of these, but your socks will remain firmly on your feet.  

The service varies - sometimes great, sometimes pretty bad, usually in between.  They serve food pretty late, so it's also a good option for late night snacking. 

For non-veggie people, apparently the bacon-wrapped dates are a little piece of heaven."}
{"text":"This is essentially the same in terms of food (OK) and service (OK) as the original location on Paradise... but with much better ambiance and a super cool view of downtown!  It's a reliable place to get a couple of vegan options when downtown (there's really not much else, unless you just want fries.)

It's currently closed while the Plaza is being remodeled but should be open again soon.  

Get a big comfy booth in the fishbowl and settle down with a pitcher of sangria or some specialty cocktails, and enjoy the view!

Beware - they stop serving at 10 pm unlike the paradise location - so get in early."}
{"text":"Seriously, I don't know how I can add on to the plethora of geat reviews that Firefly has already received; other than being another one of the millions...AND MILLIONS, of fans :)

Came here for the first time w/ a few ppl this past memorial day wknd.  We were already going because our friend wanted to hit this place up, so I would end up having to review this place no matter what.

The first thing I heard was that this place can get pretty packed...but we showed up @ about 8:40PM and our friends already had a table ready for us.  The wait was supposed to be a min of 30 min, but I guess we got lucky.  WSOP and a UFC fight might have kept the masses at bay during this time, so all the better for us.

This is definitely now one of my favorite spots to eat in LV.  Spanish Tapas; love em love em love em!  There is SUCH a variety of things to choose from, from the bacon-wrapped dates(sounds strange, but actually VERY good), to the various types of empanadas, to the ahi skewers, to the duck rolls...seriously too many things to name, and we had a LOT of them.  It's basically like picking various appetizers and finger foods and everyone gets a little taste, and moves on.  So you end up ordering maybe 8-10 items for a party of 4 or 5.  And that left us quite full...  very affordable(items range between $5-9 per item and each of us ended up spending about $25 each, and that was with several pitchers of Sangria.

Parking - it's a plaza so there's a good amount of parking.  Just remember that if you take a cab there(about $10-15), it might be hard finding one back, unless there are more and more people coming into the resto.  

Service staff - very friendly and very attentive.  They definitely pleasured me - in all manners of restaurantism!"}
{"text":"Everything here is great. I had a fillet of beef dish (small plate) it was perfect. The red sangria was amazing. The bacon wrapped dates were great. The French fries and the apple and manchego salad, and the ribs... better than most places that claim to specialize in ribs. Fall off the bone in a mango BBQ sauce that was not too sweet, just right

Finish with the desert platter... 

It's great, one of my new favorite spots"}
{"text":"Firefly serves up consistently gorgeous tapas, it's my favorite place to catch up with friends in town.

Fav dishes are the ceviche (OMG!), the stuffed dates (OMG OMG!) and the sliders (m'kay I'm hungry now!). All of the aforementioned should most definately be washed down with the delicious sangria which flows freely at Firefly. 

If you've never been here, you're seriously missing out!"}
{"text":"The first time I visited Firefly was in 2013 for a wedding reception and I had the best time munching on the bacon wrapped dates and downing mojitos.  So when I was planning my high school's 20th reunion, I immediately thought of Firefly, a hip, super fun place to have a great dinner and hang out with friends.

From the initial email I sent Regina with Banquets to payment at the event, the whole deal went without a glitch.  Communication with Regina was a breeze and she answered all of my emails quickly.  Our group was small (under 50) and from out of town so naturally many of them were skeptical with the salmonella incidence and health inspection violations and closures at their other locations.  But I kept close communication with Regina and paid attention to the REPUTABLE recent reviews of Firefly on Yelp.  

The affordable all you can eat banquet menu included their starter, a choice of 6 tapas, and \"chocolate\" tres leches cake for only $30 per person.  Out of their extensive selection, I chose the most popular based on yelp reviews:  artichoke toasts, stuffed dates, baby back ribs, patatas bravas, steak skewers, and camarones a la diable.  We decided on a cash bar that they set up in our private room and we added on unlimited soft drinks for $2.50 per person.  The room charge was $200 with a minimum $1000 food and beverage.  

Our room was set up with one row of tables which initially seemed a little crowded, but turned out fine.  Our crowd mingled for about 20 minutes before I asked when the food would be served and they told me as soon as we were seated.  We sat down and like magic, the food was ushered in by the trays.  As expected the dates were a favorite, but people seemed to love the artichoke toasts, ribs and shrimp as well.  

They are located minutes from the strip and parking in their lot was plentiful.  Our group had a great time and having it at Firefly was awesome.  Highly recommend Firefly for your banquet.  Excellent service from start to finish."}
{"text":"WOW!

Talk about being in for a treat! Fremont Street is not exactly my first destination when seeking out good eats, but holy smacks! My party was seated in what I would describe as the best seats in the house. Directly center in front of a huge window overlooking the street and able to view the \"light show\" about 15 minutes into the meal.

We ordered so much food and nothing was disappointing. We started with a pitcher of the white sangria. The drink was great and the booze marinated fruit was a great finish to the meal. 

Crispy Duck Roll - Really Great! The duck was tender with great flavor, although I agree with previous yelper, could have used a lil somethin somethin (like sriracha)
Albondigas - The sauce on these little meatballs was the star.
Babyback Ribs - SO TENDER! I was really impressed! The little salsa it was served with was such a great compliment to the protein.
Calamari - Very nicely cooked. Not rubbery or overcooked at all. Hooray!
Patatas Bravas - While there's nothing super special about this dish, it had a nice spicy sauce.
Stuffed Dates - YES YES YES! DELISH! The bleu cheese made this dish. Perfectly balanced.
Tierra Y Mar Skewers - Very nicely done. I was worried the beef and shrimp on the same skewer may be a death sentence for the shrimp, resulting in a sad pink eraser of \"shrimp\" but it was very nice, and the beef was med-rare. The sausage on it was also really yummy.
Camarones Diabla - Nothing groundbreaking, but a solid spicy shrimp dish.
Mac N Cheese - Creamy and rich. Very nice.
Filet Sliders - Tasty goodness!
Bread Pudding - Very moist.
Flan - Great great flavor. 

Our server, Tony, and his flock of fellow servers were attentive and the food was coming out at a perfect clip. We were able to enjoy each dish, without feeling overwhelmed at any time. 

The food was solid and the bill was incredibly reasonable both for the amount of and quality of fare we enjoyed that evening. Firefly will certainly be on my list of places to return to next time I'm in Vegas. Bravo!"}
{"text":"If I learned I was going to die tomorrow, I would eat my last meal at Firefly.

Food and drinks are amazing!
I always have to get the Manchengo Mac N Cheese and Chicken Skewers with either a Flavored Mojito or Sangria!

Love the food. Love the atmosphere. if you've never stopped to eat here make sure you put it on your To Do list!"}
{"text":"I had an amazing time here! Came with friends before I left on a trip and their happy hour is the best time for an afternoon pick me up. I had a server by the name of Carlos who couldn't not have been more amazing! Got an amazing goupon deal so it worked out well with their happy hour and food. Would come back here again! Especially for the mojitos! Yum!"}
{"text":"shared a few small plates, the food was great, the white sangria amazing, the date was aweful. lol Thank God the restaurant was fantastic"}
{"text":"Great spot! Portions are larger than your average tapas that's for sure. I was starving and got full 3 tapas. The Ahi Tuna, Shrimp Diablo, and Grilled Octopus were delicious! I had about 6 cocktails and they were all amazing! 

The food comes out super fast! We got our dishes delivered no longer than ten minutes after we ordered and it was made freshly. 

Good for dates, group dinners, and parties/celebrations."}
{"text":"love this place. love the food. this time - the only thing giving this place 3 stars is the food

i took my 2 girlfriends and my sister here after we saw le reve. there was a little bit of a wait, probably about 20 minutes. we sat outside near the door, which is the worst table ever! if it werent for the heaters, we would have froze out there! 

maybe it was because we were hungry and a little cranky, but it felt like everything from water service to actually taking out order took forever. the food came out in a fairly timely manner, but out server forgot about the patatas bravas we ordered, which my sister was stoked about because they its a traditional spanish tapa.i must say - the busser was awesome! very attentive with the water refills and pre-bussing. she even brought new plates and forks for our dessert!

we ordered:
smoked salmon toasts
shrimp ceviche
tuna tartare
stuffed dates
thai beef salad
manchego mac n cheese
albondigas
chicken and chorizo stuffed mushrooms
lamb skewers
banana nutella sandwich

the table by the door sucks because the door would hit my chair anytime someone went in or out.

needless to say, this was one of my worst experiences here. the food is definitely gonna bring me back though!"}
{"text":"Amazing bacon wrapped dates... And finished with chocolate and curry bread pudding. Great service, very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Went again this afternoon for Saturday lunch, all the food was great except the artichoke bread, which we did not enjoy.  The waiter today was excellent and the service was outstanding.  Kudos to Firefly."}
{"text":"I'd always been a fan of this place.  We didn't get food poisoning. =D  I love the new location, bigger, cleaner, and nicer!  I'm so happy they opened a new restaurant and closed the other one.  Must try their sangria if you haven't yet.  Everything they serve is so tasty."}
{"text":"Delicious food, friendly service, scrumptious drinks...my party of 5 loved this tapas bar.   Visiting Las Vegas, I was on a quest to try some new places there...so we checked out Firefly of Paradise. 

Happy Hour was great! I tried a few drinks on the menu.  We ordered a ton of food. Each of us had very different tastes, but everyone was very pleased with all the choices. Some favorites...bacon wrapped dates - a must try, Terra y Mare, Chorizo clams, Plate of Serano ham and Manchego cheese.  Prices were great. 5 people, half the table drank alcohol - bill was just under $100 before tax - with dessert, and tons of food! 

DESSERTS: previous reviews listed complaints about the desserts, which is why we ordered the dessert platter. I wanted to see for myself. Everyone at the table tore that plate up!  There's something for everyone, nothing was left behind. The flan was especially delicious!"}
{"text":"The ambience was good but really noisy. The food was definitely tasty but the quantity was not at all sufficient for a meal. We had to order atleast 2 plates per person. I liked their berries drink"}
{"text":"I work in fine dining and am a self-proclaimed foody, so I'm not ignorant when it comes to judging food. Everything was delicious, the sauces that complimented every dish were excellent, and flavors were layered expertly. 
The stuffed dates (wrapped in bacon) were exceptional. 

Service was professional and attentive. Atmosphere was both casual and classy. A very nice experience."}
{"text":"We really like this place. A lot of bang for your buck. We get everything here, especially all the tapas. Everything is good here & drinks are good. Nice atmosphere & service. A must on every Vegas trip. Wish we had one here in CA."}
{"text":"A must on every Vegas trip. We ordered the shrimp, bacon dates, beef salad, escargot & more shrimp & sangrias. Dinner w/ drinks around $70 not bad for the taste and selection."}
{"text":"Awesome girls night out or celebratory dinner spot! Food was AMAZING. Very small tapas portions.. I could've eaten 5 by myself easily lol. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I've only been to Firefly a couple times for drinks and to nosh on tapas. Well, I'm glad I did since it was an excellent choice. It gets super busy come 5pm and stays packed until close..I should know I pass it everyday from home to work. Try Firefly you won't be sorry you did!"}
{"text":"I think we should all have a friends night out at this restaurant. Share the food (macaroni shells!), share the drinks (sangria!), enjoy the menu. Big parties are better. Firefly does not take reservations so expect a wait, especially on weekends!"}
{"text":"If you want to get away from the high priced restaurants on the strip try Firefly. It's a local place where very few tourists go or even know about. And if you enjoy the variety of a full tapas menu, this is the place to go. The food is worth the cab ride to their location on Paradise Rd, near the Hard Rock. Two outstanding recommendations: the lamb sausage with red pepper confit and the white sangria. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Read great reviews about this place but wasn't so impressed. This could be because it was not very crowded night given the off season. Tapas were good. If you're thinking of ordering entrees, the her roasted chicken is really good and flavorful (decent quantity too)."}
{"text":"Why I loved Firefly
1. Awesome Tapas
2. Good atmosphere
3. Very reasonable for Las Vegas ($30 per person including drinks)"}
{"text":"I had higher expectations of this place and was a little disappointed with the dishes we ordered.  The Garbanzo Beans with spices and the shells still on them confused me, I wasn't sure how to eat this....chew and spit out the shell?  We did order a spicy shrimp dish that was the most simple of all the dishes and yet the best it had nice flavor combinations.  The Red Bell pepper dish that was stuffed with Manchego cheese was tasty but I think just going the chille Relleno route would have made this dish better it was too tart with the bell pepper.  Than there was the Clams in a tasty broth with chunks of sausage in it, that was really good just a tab bit too much sausage flavor as it took away from the clams having any flavor at all.   We also ordered a Safron type of rice that was wayyyyyy to overpowering that flavor was stuck in my mouth all night.  I'm thinking we ordered wrong and there was possibly way better dishes on the menu than what we choose.   I would give this place a 2nd chance but probably at a different location."}
{"text":"tried coming here friday night but the wait was discouraging.. so me and a friend returned yesterday night and i'm glad we did. had a pitcher of the red sangria between the two of us. it was yummy.. not to strong.. but strong enough to get me buzzed since i drank more than half the pitcher myself. yea.. thats how much i liked it! we werent that hungry so we only tried the fried calamari and the filet mignon sliders.. both excellent choices. we finished off with a shot of  fruit infused vodka, with berries and lychee. i'm not a big fan of vodka but this was tasty! it gets pretty loud inside but you dont notice too much cuz you're having fun just like everyone else...

update 4.23.07

so the last two times i've been here i've been disappointed with the sangria. maybe they havent been letting it chill for the usual 3 days but even my friend who is a fan of firefly's sangria says it hasnt been up to par. last night.. tried the steak and mushroom skewers.. so wrong!.. i felt like i was biting into a chewy piece of charcoal. it had no other flavor than that of charcoal. ordered the crispy duck roll.. it was alright. it was very meaty. i had imagined it a whole different way. was hoping the duck to be the crispy part but it was more like a duck eggroll. a little on the dry side. next was the patatas bravas. the potatoes were grilled just right.. and the spicy aioli complimented them very well. not smothered in it.. just enough to fill your mouth with the zesty goodness. and of course calamari. i wont lower my rating.. but i'd just be more careful of what i order next time......

and they've raised their price for sangria. $5 for a glass, and $20 for the pitcher.. instead of the familliar $18.. ehh.. just thought it was nice to know."}
{"text":"This restaurant is awesome! Great place to eat and have drinks. They have a beautiful bar with a vast array of liquor to suit any taste and seats plenty! The substance of the food menu is filled with flavor and caters to a wide range of vivid tastes, and the price is excellent for such high quality food! Totally recommend for anyone looking for a great meal and cool atmosphere,  perfect for friends, family or dates!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to see that Firefly added a restaurant closer to my house! This is my favorite place in Las Vegas to go out to dinner too. I love that it isn't a chain and is one of a kind. Even though their sangria is very popular the mojito is where its at. My favorite mojito is mango although their passion fruit and blueberry are in close second and third. I love that all of their plates are small portions. I love going with a group of friends or family and choosing many plates. That way you can sample much of their menu without getting too full. My favorite chilled tapa on the menu has to be the apple manchango salad. If you haven't tried it yet it is a must! Their petite filet is also a must try! If you are vacationing in Vegas or just a local this is a restaurant you will have to try! I have been to the one on Paradise as well and is just as great! I really want to visit the one in Henderson as well because I heard the view there is amazing!"}
{"text":"This was the first Firefly that I visited and I loved it the first time and I continue to love it to this day! The location on Paradise is great because its close to the strip so if you have visitors in town you should take them off the strip and to this great restaurant! I love sitting out on the patio on summer nights if seats are available. This is my favorite place in Las Vegas to go out to dinner too. I love that it isn't a chain and is one of a kind. Even though their sangria is very popular the mojito is where its at. My favorite mojito is mango although their passion fruit and blueberry are in close second and third.

If you are vacationing in Vegas or just a local this is a restaurant you will have to try!"}
{"text":"Probably my favorite place in Vegas! I love their mojitos and sangria! I must order one of these drinks whenever I visit or else it isn't really a complete firefly visit. 

I have tried most of their small plates but I think my favorite would have to be the dates! They taste almost like candy! They are a must try when you visit!

I also really like the eggplant with goat cheese. I mean, who doesn't like goat cheese?! It tastes like heaven.

The fries are always a good option especially with a larger party. 

The escargot scallops are also divine. It's not actually escargot just cooked in an escargot tray. It's made with lemon butter and garlic sauce. Need I say anything more?

The dessert platter is also a must try. So many desserts on one tray-trust me you'll love it! The dolce de leche cake is out of this world!"}
{"text":"I studied abroad in Spain so I was excited to try a tapas kitchen in town. Went with a decent sized group and ordered a good selection off the menu... Wasn't let down by any of the food. It was all really good. This will sound snobby and I can't do anything about it but, a lot of them weren't the traditional Spanish tapas or pintxos (Basque Country) we ate abroad, but still good. HOWEVER the ones that were traditional Spanish or Basque WERE AWESOME. I got completely nostalgic and felt like I was back there. If you can, try to go during happy hour (Monday-Sunday 3-6pm) otherwise you will leave with your wallet pretty worked out as they charge generally $5-8 per dish."}
{"text":"YUMM! Solid 4 stars. 

Came here on a Sunday for an early dinner; there was no wait and we got seated right away. Our waiter was really friendly and helpful. We got 6 or 7 dishes if i remember correctly and a pitcher of sangria (must have) and the bill came out to about $25 pp for 4. Very affordable and i was stuffed! My favorite dishes were the merguez and the paella but that might be because it reminded me of the food I used to eat in France. The bf really liked the camajones a diablo. The sauce was soooo good! We had to keep asking for bread and wiped that plate clean! Haha The ambiance was nice, modern and dim and they had a patio to sit outside. I  wanna go back and try more dishes!!

So glad we skipped the buffets and came here instead!! I was pleasantly surprised to find out that there was such delicious food away from the strip! We took a cab and the fare was about $13 from PH, not too bad. Our cab driver told us Firefly was one of his fav restaurant in LV and gave us a list of other local places to try too. Def need to check them out next time!"}
{"text":"Another great experience at fireflies. Pepe and Vanessa were on point with service, and the food was amazing. One of the best spots to eat in Vegas, hands down. I recommend the pitcher of sangria and anything else on the menu."}
{"text":"Just a short walk from the strip and so worth it!! Tapas were amazing as was the sangria. The best thing on the menu though was the bacon wrapped dates in red wine reduction sauce. I discovered this place on one of Rachael Rays episodes!!!!"}
{"text":"Oh dear! The Gazpacho! The Mac & Cheese! The Flan! The Passion - Fruit Cheesecake! Yum! But really the Stuffed Peppers are to melt for. Whoa! Oh, and the Sangria...... delicious."}
{"text":"Arrived on a Friday night with no reservation. We were told it would be a 20-25 minute wait, but were seated after only 10 minutes. Just as well since no one offered to serve us in the 10 minutes at the bar. Our waiter was prompt and courteous. The four tapas we ordered came out extremely quickly. Unfortunately, this seems to be due to the fact that everything had been prepared well in advance.  The bread seemed several days old. Very disappointed by the quality of the food. Too loud to hold a conversation."}
{"text":"I came to Firefly before the drive back to San Diego on a Sunday evening.  We had a group of 9 but got seated promptly at around 7pm.  There are two rooms to the restaurant so it's larger than you think.

I've only had tapas once before, but the general rule seems to be an average of 2 plates per person if you're not big eaters.  With a large group, its always hard to share small dishes so we split into smaller groups for sharing.  We also ordered a pitcher of sangria for 3 people.  

Recap: Sangria was good.  The lobster escargot is presented in the same manner as escargot - extremely buttery and delicious.  Tuna tartare was really average - similar to all other tuna tartare can get at other restaurants, imo.  We had some other dishes too but nothing really stood out in my mind.  My absolute favorite is the manchego mac and cheese.  I love mac and cheese.  I've never had manchego cheese, but now I also love manchego cheese.  This mac and cheese is on the cheesier side compared to most I've had so you really gotta love cheese for this.  The dish is small but it is so rich that each person really only needs a small amount to be satisfied.  The baked crust on top was perfect.

Definitely worth giving this place a try, especially if you're sick of eating the overpriced food on the strip or buffets."}
{"text":"Always a great experience coming here. Food and service is excellent. I don't think I've ever ordered anything that I wasn't pleased with. That being said, I have a particular fondness to the tuna tartare, tuna skewers, tres leches cake, and especially the chocolate cherry bread pudding (warm with a generous serving of ice cream on the top). 

The ambiance is really lovely as well. You wouldn't be out of place dressed up or down (as with most LV places). Prices are very reasonable. I think each individual plate is good for two people to share and feel satisfied with the amount tasted. If you have three or more, you might want to order doubles of some plates to make sure everyone gets a decent amount. The two of us order four to five plates, plus one dessert (and you get some delicious free bread), and leave feeling well-satisfied."}
{"text":"(Jan/ 2006)

We came here really late after watching \"O\" at the Bellagio and waited at the bar for a while before we got a table. Cheap drinks! 

Tip: If you need a cab to get back to your hotel after eating here late night, make sure you ask have the hostess call while you are dining. We had to wait nearly an hour for a taxi to make its way out here to get us. That was ridiculous."}
{"text":"Stumbled on this place by accident..Thank God we did!  Plates were flavorful and plentiful.  Drinks weren't overpriced, and it had a great atmosphere.  Favorites were the stuffed dates and the clams and chorizo.  My wife went crazy for the gazpacho!  What a great night out, we will be back!"}
{"text":"Firefly is a more than competent tapas place with a lot going for it.  The decor is comfortable but perhaps a bit dark - nothing special.  And the service is friendly and very prompt, maybe even too prompt; if you want your dinner paced, you will have to do it yourself (see hint below).

But in every other respect, Firefly excels.

Every item on the menu that we tried was very good to excellent.  No misses at all, and some were really outstanding, most notably the baked goat cheese and (believe it or not) the Chicago beef bocadillos.  The San Gria was above average too.

The menu is large and has a wide variety of selections.  You will want to order 20 or so, but two per person is enough for an average appetite.

The prices are quite reasonable, with a typical plate being well under $10.

Go hungry.  

HINTS:
1.  Reservations are really necessary.
2.  From the time you order to the time you get your food will vary from a few minutes to about ten.  Each plate will be brought separately, so you really need to share.  
3.  To pace your meal, order one or two dishes, sit around eating and talking, and when you are ready, order a couple more.  They are fine with you doing this."}
{"text":"Stuffed dates? Nothing I'd ever order.

Luckily, I tried them. And they were delicious. And most of what I ate here was great! Along with the dates, I sampled the empenadas, petite filet, chicken chrorizo stuffed mushrooms, shrimp a la diabla, and the nutella sammiches for dessert. The stuffed mushrooms were disappointing since they were under the heat lamp for too long, so the cheese was hard and not very tasty. But everything else was pretty great. The Sangria rivaled what I've had in Spain (or at least, what I remembered I've had in Spain), and it was a great lively feel to the place.

It was absolutely packed on a Tuesday night, though. So reservations are recommended. 

Although I'm not a local, I was treated like I was an regular, with attentive and helpful service from our server and the busboy quickly grabbing our old plates to make room for the new ones. 

I'll be back here again, hopefully for Happy Hour next time."}
{"text":"I go to this place a lot with friends. Blood orange mojitos. Get a pitcher if you have a cab or a DD with you. Sweet, flavorful, full of mint and not too much ice (but enough to keep it cold). Yum!

I go here with my gals for nights out (and sometimes evenings out that turn into nights out... oh yeah). The service is friendly and prompt. I don't like the butter-type stuff that comes with their bread, but I love their:

goat cheese cannoli (rolled in eggplant)
mini-cheesecakes
warm spinach salad
campenadas
lentils (my friend comes here just for that)
duck egg rolls (my friend finds them spicy, but ketchup is adventurous for her)
banana sandwiches with Nutella sauce
Um.. can't think of more, but I know that I want to go there again just for that!

We aren't as big on thier mixed salad (too oily for me) or baked brie. But out of their 50 menu items, we've tried about 35 and loved maybe 28, which is pretty good!"}
{"text":"Really good tapas, but go for happy hour. The bar is small, but it is an awesome place to sit and have your discounted mojitos, sangria, and tapas. The place gets very crowded and I found the best time to go is happy hour. You get great service from the bartender. You do not need to deal with the crowd or have reservations. Once you are drunk and stuffed with tapas, crawl next door to their sister restaurant Dragonfly and have some sushi. The bartender, Aaron, is awesome!"}
{"text":"It's a fun place to go. I love sharing my food family style so this place is great for me. The dishes we chose were hit and miss, though. An eggplant and goat cheese dish had the eggplant so thin, it was overwhelmed by the 90% cheese portion. An egg/potato/something else dish was very... potatoey, though what was I expecting from it huh? Filet mignon and Thai beef salad were delicious though. Glad I tried it, but probably wouldn't return."}
{"text":"Delicious mojito.  Super empty compared to normal, chairs up on tables in half the room when we walked in at 5pm seemed like a bad sign.  All the favorites were good except the scallop escargot... Half burnt and half raw does not equate to properly cooked despite the waiter's attempt to say it should be done that way. Hopefully issue rectified in ordering something else."}
{"text":"Firefly is the best Tapas restaurant I've been to yet! I was lucky to get to eat here two weekends in a row! I came last weekend for dinner w/ a group of 18, and then again yesterday with my girlfriends for lunch - both times we were seated promptly and the dishes came out quickly. I've probably tried 15+ tapas dishes here and they're all really tasty, under $10/each, and the portions are bigger than any other Tapas place I've been to. I think the sauces for the dishes here are what really make them excellent. 

Standout items on the menu would include: Chicken & Chorizo Stuffed Mushrooms, Camerones a la Diabla (Shrimp, Spicy Chile Sauce [SO GOOD], Grilled Bread), Stuffed Dates (Bacon-Wrapped, Smoked Almond, Red Wine Reduction, Blue Cheese), Smoked Salmon Toasts (Brioche Toast, Sour Cream, Pickled Ginger, Capers), Roasted Eggplant Cannelloni, and the Steak and Mushroom Skewers. Don't forget to order a pitcher of their White Sangria (marinated for 3-days to enhance the taste).

I wish there was a Firefly in the OC! Good thing my friends LOVE to go to Vegas ;)"}
{"text":"I think we ate half the menu. All of it was mind-blowingly good.

You think that's hyperbole? it's not. I went with two TOUGH people to find food for on account of their pickyness. Even they were impressed. Every bite was amazing. It's going to be tough to find a tapas bar to compete with this place.

We had no less than 8 plates, all of them awesome. The lamb skewers were sublime. The diablo shrimp was so good, we wanted to save the sauce for dipping. Hell, we wanted to dip the flan in it, it was so good!

Great atmosphere. Great service. And incredible food. This is my favorite place to eat in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Great food. Loved the atmosphere. THE SERVICE was fantastic. Highly recommend. The shrip with diablo sauce was amazing. The mussle sauces was good. The clams were very good."}
{"text":"Great off strip tapas restaurant. Solid food, great service and a good location. Great spot for lunch."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, great sized plates, amazing choices, the petite filet has to be the best piece of meat i have ever eaten, moist, flavorful all around delicious. The ceviche was ok, the tortilla chips were a lil stale, the tomato basil soup was great, the fried dates were great, and the vegetable empanada was savory. All i can say is that i am gonna go back for another plate of that petite filet."}
{"text":"Great sangria and great happy hour! We came here with a large group of friends and were accommodated quickly. We were over 15 and I was surprised with the quality of service we received. We did not wait a lot for our food or  drinks. Everyone on the table each ordered different things and the food came promptly. 

I ordered the empanadas (delicious), fries (big basket!), Mac and cheese, croquetas and chocolate tres leches cake. All the food that we ordered was great. The only one I did not love was the Mac and cheese. It tasted fine but not something I would order again. My personal favorite was the empanadas. The dessert was also very tasty and could be shared with 2 people. 

Like I mentioned, the sangria here is really good. We ordered pitchers for the table. They have 3 options but I only tried the red sangria. This is a place I would definitely come back to especially during happy hour."}
{"text":"We never miss a chance to have dinner.  This trip we took granddaughters age 9 and 14 and they loved it too.  The menu has the best Tapas selections we have experienced.  Great Mojitos.  The staff members are friendly and knowledgable.  The manager Carlos makes the whole experience a must stop in Vegas and everyone we've sent from Arizona considers it a must stop for Vegas visits."}
{"text":"Food is awesome...and the Sangria is the best I've had in a long time. This is a total hidden gem being a couple of blocks off the strip. Payless, get better food and drinks!"}
{"text":"I cannot believe that I have not left a review for Firefly yet! I have been coming to Firefly for over 6 years now and always have a great experience. The food, the ambiance, and the service are consistently excellent! This is the restaurant I always recommend for people new to Vegas, and so far everyone has thanked me for this recommendation. 
As for what to order...I always get a pitcher of red sangria, to share of course. They start you off with complimentary bread and sweet almond butter, which surpasses any other buttery spread I've had. Most of the menu is tapas style which makes the meal even more enjoyable because it is possible to have a little taste of everything if you want. My absolute favorite dishes are the artichoke toasts and the vegan \"crab cakes.\" YES, they are VEGAN FRIENDLY here! Lately, I've been getting their veggie paella. It's delicious, huge, and contains the most perfectly cooked artichokes within it. Back when I did eat meat, their stuffed dates, sliders, and fish sticks were my top picks. For dessert, you can't go wrong with the Nutella sandwiches or chocolate cherry bread pudding. 
Do yourself a favor, and give Firefly a try if you haven't yet. You can thank me later!"}
{"text":"If you haven't tried this place you must!  Everything is good, but I had the bacon wrapped dates which were amazing!  Happy hour at the bar is fun as they give you little appetizers.  Totally recommend it but it does get busy."}
{"text":"Sat At the bar and Omg the stuffed dates were the most amazing thing I have tasted in a while!  Service was great and the cucumber Mojito was so refreshing :).  Definitely coming back on my next trip.  Plus it was easy parking and not to far off the strip."}
{"text":"Went for a late b day  dinner. Being my first tapas spot it was amazing. The stuffed dates are to die for, l could eat a whole table full. It Has a great scenery and awesome vibe. Service was AMAZING. Had our food in a matter of minutes. And they brought me a b day desert that was really a great added touch. The white sangria was spot on as well"}
{"text":"A great place for visitors and locals. It's got the local feel but the proximity to the strip makes it a great option for the visiting crowd. I highly recommend a reservation if you don't show up early. It's located in a small strip mall with lots of parking.

For three of us, we got out under $60 (not including tip). The food was generally very good. However, there was one foul item - baked tilapia. This came as a recommendation, but the fish didn't taste fresh. It tasted like the frozen filets I get from Walmart.

The mushroom tart was a really nice portion. I'm not a fan of cream cheese and since Boursin is like cream cheese, I strayed away from the cheesiest parts. Anything puff pastry and mushrooms is good in my book and it was a hit with my tablemates.

The tuna tartare was delicious. The taro chips were a nice addition - texture and flavor-wise. The three chips only lasted through half of the tartare so I would recommend you save your free bread and use that. Frankly, the tartare was seasoned nicely enough that I had no problem eating it alone!

The ham a cheese croquetas were like an upscale hot pocket. There are three to an order and it was just good enough for a taste. Good comfort food.

The crispy duck roll was a hit with one but I wasn't wowed by it. It just seemed like a shredded pork egg roll with some hoisin sauce and chopped scallions. Solid, but I won't be ordering this next time.

The lobster escargots were FANTASTIC. I hope this is a consistently cooked dish because everyone should try this once. The lobster was cooked just enough so it was super tender and had great flavor. A definite repeat for my next visit.

I had the paradise mojito based on some other reviews. The flavor was nice, but if you're not a fan of chewing your drink (minced mint), I would steer clear of this. It didn't become much of an issue, but I was careful every time I took a sip that small chunks of mint didn't get caught in my throat.

Service was great and food comes out of the kitchen very fast so we were in and out in about an hour. We left when happy hour ended and there were quite a few parties waiting for a table."}
{"text":"Incredible. Bacon wrapped dates, Mac n cheese, sorrano sliders, crispy duck, ham and cheese crocquetas, ceviche, French fries. Eat it all!"}
{"text":"I had bookmarked this place for a while now after seeing Rachel Ray feature it on her $40 a day. We didn't manage to eat here on our last trip, so this time around, we decided to try and get in there on our first night in Vegas. We didn't make a reservation and it was around 7.30pm when we got there. Even though it was a Monday night, they looked pretty packed, but then again, where isn't it packed in Vegas every single night of the week?

Luckily they had a table for us. Before we even ordered, a plate of complimentary appetizers were placed on the table... olives, toasted slices of baguette and some balls of either cheese or flavored butter - I couldn't tell what it was really.

Hubby ordered sangria ($6). ACK, it was awful and tasted like they used cheap wine in it. I stuck with iced tea. After we ordered, the food arrived rather quickly. Boquerones ($5) on toast was okay. The marinated anchovies weren't the best I'd ever had, but we hadn't had boquerones for a long time now so we really felt like some. Really awesome bocquerones has no trace of fishiness, but these ones did have a slight fishy taste to it.

Fried calamari was also okay. It was pretty good although again a little too much batter to my liking. But it wasn't rubbery so that was a plus. The camarones al ajillo was not bad, but hubby said I could've easily made that dish at home so it wasn't anything which blew him away.

The duck rolls with hoisin sauce were pretty disgusting in my book. The rolls were like egg rolls but stuffed with duck. It had WAY too much hoisin sauce making them just TOO TOO sweet. It actually made my mouth pucker from just one bite. I did not like these at all. 

The last tapa we ordered were the lamb chops which were served with a red wine reduction. This was clearly the star of the evening. Perfectly grilled with the sauce enhancing the lamb chops instead of throwing the entire dish off like the hoisin sauce on the duck rolls. It was served on a very flavorful bed of lentils, zucchini spaghetti strands and artichokes. I would definitely order this dish again.

5 tapa, 1 glass of sangria, an iced tea and one lemonade came to slightly under $55 before tip. Kinda pricey if you ask me. Service was okay, nothing to write home about. Now that I've eaten here, I don't think I'll come back again on a future trip. There are just way too many great restaurants in Vegas to return to Firefly. Food was mediocre, but I think if you are in Vegas partying, this place has great atmosphere and is good for downing alcohol and having a small bite to eat. However, we aren't the partying type even if lil guy wasn't in tow. All we want is awesome food at reasonable prices (or even awesome food at not so reasonable prices) and Firefly certainly doesn't fall into that category."}
{"text":"The only reason why I can imagine one going here is one member of your party wants sushi, the other wants some kind of Americanized wrap and chips, and yet another wants curry?  You could get all of those things separately and better tasting  elsewhere, but if you need them in once place, I guess you should go to Firefly."}
{"text":"Why oh why does Firefly have to be located 2,082 miles away from my home?

This place was flat out awesome; almost everything about it was perfect

The atmosphere is nice; looks can be deceiving because Firefly is located in a small strip mall and on the outside does not look impressive but the inside is surprisingly cozy and relaxing.  The outside patio is where you want to be as long as it isn't too hot, sitting outside was a very cool experience, even though there isn't much to look at, it's always nice to enjoy a good meal and quality drink in the open air.

The drinks were delicious, well at least the sangria that I enjoyed as well as the Riesling that my friend enjoyed were.  Some of the best sangria that I have had in my entire life, sweet and savory.

The food was awesome, we ordered 5 plates and the food was not only good but surprising filing, most tapa places you need 5 or 6 plates per individual but 5 plates were actually enough for a party of 2 to get full.  We had the smoked salmon toast, delicious, the Thai beef salad, delicious, shrimp tempura, delicious, fried calamari, delicious and the steak and mushroom skewers, delicious.  Not one part of the food was a miss; all 5 plates were flavorful and utterly enjoyable. 

My only issue was with the service, the main waiter we had wasn't very attentive and also messed up on part of the order. I asked for lobster \"escargot\" but instead was served lamb skewers which I sent back.  I mean I guess it's an honest mistake; both do start with the letter L but come on now you can't mix up lobster and lamb.  Even with that said, overall service was pretty good, the guy in charge of refilling my water glass and clearing my plates was excellent and really likeable; if only he could teach the main waiter something all would be good.

Firefly is a must visit if you are in Vegas, I don't care if it's off the strip or in a little strip mall, the food, drinks and overall experience was awesome! Definitely worth a return visit, if only it weren't so far away from where I currently am."}
{"text":"Firefly moved to a new location but everything I said in my previous review http://www.yelp.com/biz/firefly-las-vegas-3 still applies. They're still located on Paradise but they have moved to a bigger and better spot.  This place has a bigger outdoor patio and is large enough inside for big groups.

While they have moved on to bigger and better digs, this didn't change their attention to detail when it comes to food or service. My only problem was that I came alone and since it is a tapas place I wasn't able to sample as many items as I wish I could.

Firefly is bigger and better than ever and definite worth a visit if you're in Vegas, it's a little off the strip but well worth it."}
{"text":"Not bad for a tapas place I guess. We got a seafood paella, stuffed peppers, potatas bravas, empanadas, and stuffed eggplant to share. The paella was quite delicious; good flavor and a lot of food. The tapas were just okay, nothing to rave about. Prices were fair (paella was $26 for 2-4 people, which isn't bad at all), though tapas were on the pricier side. I would give this place 3.5 stars for the food, will bump up for good service."}
{"text":"So good! Went there because it was within walking distance of my hotel. Ordered way too much food, the sizes were very generous. Had a pitcher of very delicious sangria. Service was stellar & I would come back again."}
{"text":"Best restaurant in Vegas! Our service was spectacular and so generous! Went for my sister's birthday and they gave her a free drink. She couldn't have been happier!! The food was absolutely delectable. Every single item on the menu that we ordered (we ordered a lot) was better than the last! Thanks Firefly for making my sister's 21st her best birthday to date!"}
{"text":"Overrated.  Went here for dinner on 10/30/13.

I had a few things, including the mushroom tart - tart was cold, but mushrooms were warm.  When food is not served at the right temperature, then I'm over it.

The garlic cream cheese stuffed peppers sounded better on paper than they did on the plate.  The cream cheese completely separates from the pepper when you cut into it.  No bueno!

The best part of my meal is the garlic bread and sweet butter.  That was good!

Restaurant is dark and very large.  Self-parking in the back.  I was put off by the large number of kitchen workers taking their break outside of the restaurant that backs into the parking.  I also didn't like seeing the numerous servers inside the restaurant all chatting with one another waiting for something to do."}
{"text":"Amazing!!!!  Artichoke toasts are one of my favorites..stuffed dates,mushroom tarte..so good!!  We were so stuffed but had too get the nutella and banana dessert..it was great!!  I was so shocked it was so cheap..everything was about  $35 for two of us!

It is loud but I don't mind it and there is usually a wait but you can make reservations. A great place!!!"}
{"text":"Hype wasn't real. 

The food here is supposed to be Spanish (fusion) but a lot more like American. I tried several dishes and they were all just ok... Nothing stood out. The sangria was grossly watered down. 

You would enjoy coming here with a large party for drinking purpose because it's more like a quantity over quality place. 

If you are looking for real Spanish tapas in LV, Jaleo at Cosmopolitan is the better option. Don't be fooled by the stars on Yelp.....They are fake anyway."}
{"text":"Although I enjoy the view from the Firefly in the Plaza more, once you walk into the Firefly on Sahara in Summerlin the red hue makes you feel at home!  You must have the Red Sangria!  Out of all the tapas dishes you can choose from, the top 3 are the bacon wrapped dates, stuffed peppers, and the kobe beef sliders!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food. I've eaten at the one on the eastside before... service was a little strange, but the waiter warmed up after a few pitchers of sangria... wait, that was us that were doing the drinking. Anyway.. loved everything we got! Especially the bacon wrapped dates. Yum. 

Would recommend for a date night out or a group of friends. But beware... it gets crowded and loud and stays that way the whole time!"}
{"text":"I swear to god, I tried almost every. single. dish. And I honestly wanted to love this place but everything was mediocre at best. 

The best part of the meal was the paella, but the seafood here just isn't very fresh - you know when shrimp gets mushy/rubbery when frozen? And I can't believe I dropped so much for those \"filet mignon\" burgers which were so overrated! I would recommend against the sangria as well which was wayyy too sweet. 

The people were really nice, and it's good for groups, but it's really just not very good food.

Sorry Firefly!"}
{"text":"I like it. Good selection of tapas and everything I've tried is very good. They currently have half off sangria. $3.5 per glass!!"}
{"text":"Delicious food for a really reasonable price! I love coming here with friends. It's such a cool atmosphere and the service is usually great. Get the pitcher of red sangria! It's nice and refreshing and a bit strong. I was feeling it after the first glass lol my favorites here are the stuffed dates and the chorizo clams. We ordered all sorts of different plates and a mixed paella. Everything came out accordingly so we always had food on the table while waiting for the paella (they let you know it's gonna take about 30 minutes.) They also gladly brought us more bread and butter when we asked for more. The paella and the mushroom puff pastry was a bit too rich for my liking but it was still good. We had a great time here. We left feeling super full, satisfied, and a little tipsy ;)"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place.... it's a MUST GO to when I come to Vegas.  This time I brought my girlfriends and we really went to town!!  We came here to eat an early dinner before our show.  Ordered about 12 dishes to share among 4 of us.  We could've done with just 10 as the meat dishes were huge!!  But we managed to eat everything plus down a pitcher of white Sangria which is a MUST!!  so light and refreshing!!

Food came out pretty steadily...  We started with the Apple and Manchego salad! SO GOOD - slivers of refreshing green apples and manchego cheese (which is light and not over whelming) along with chopped smoked almonds to give that extra crunch!

We then got the warm spinach salad - WOW!  So MUCH - perfect for four of us - very lightly dressed - loved the artichoke hearts and feta that came with it!!

We loved EVERYTHING we ordered.... their tuna tartare with bits of fresh avocado to be enjoyed with crispy taro chips!  WE LOVED their Veggie Empanada... I actually wished I could've eaten a whole one myself!  The crust was crunchy - with warm fresh veggies - SO MOUTHWATERING GOOD!! Then there's the mushrooms that were stuffed with chicken, chorizo and cheese!! so good... then you can never go wrong with their fried calamari!! :)  A nice surprise was the octopus!  had a bit of a bite - spice but the octopus was SO tender... grilled to perfection!!  Loved their lamb chops (we had to order 2 as each order comes with 2 lamb chop).  Had SO much lentils... was crazy - that's the one thing we couldn't finish... OH and their ribs - scrape off the bone deliciousness!!  OH and the other nice surprise was the Shrimp with the sweet and sour sauce... shrimp cooked perfectly but that SAUCE.. yes - wipe clean with the bread goodness and even dipping our calamari in the sauce was AWESOME....

Overall we had a GREAT time - rolled out of there... the one thing about service which was frustrating was we needed our bill so we can run to our show...  the waiter forgot and I had to chase him down after 10 minutes... UGH...  but other than that - great and fun place to get a variety of tasty tapas and DELICIOUS refreshing drinks!!  A MUST GO to place when visiting Vegas!"}
{"text":"This was my favorite meal in Vegas.  The tapas were tasty, and though Spanish cuisine is usually difficult for a vegan I found plenty to eat.  The blood orange mojitos were great.  The servers were very cool, projecting a low key but attentive persona.  I would certainly eat here again.  The tomato soup is fabulous.  The patio is painted in a scuffed red and is delightful if you can stand the smokers."}
{"text":"Firefly is the kind of place we usually like to take visitors from out of town when they want something cool and hip, but without the chaos of the strip (nor the exuberant prices).

They started us off with a plate of bread, buttery good stuff, and green olives as we checked out the menu.  To get things started for our party of five, we ordered a pitcher of sparkling sangria ($24).  

To grub on...
* Stuffed dates \"bacon-wrapped, smoked almond, red wine reduction, blue cheese\" ($4) - Everyone always loves these.  It's just a bite of intense flavor and goodness, and there's bacon!  About four to an order. 

* Terra y Mare skewers \"grilled shrimp, filet mignon, chorizo sausage, salsa verde\" ($10) - Came with three skewers, it was good, not great, but okay.

* Firefly\" fish sticks \"fillets of grouper, Japanese breadcrumbs, spicy tartar sauce\" ($6) - Arrived with two sticks per order.

* Merguez \"spicy lamb sausage, tomato-pepper confit, grilled bread\" ($8) - A strong taste that gets some getting used to. The Husband was loving this stuff.

* Pulpo asado \"marinated and grilled octopus, potato, tomato\" ($7.50) - The octopus was bit overcooked, not quite what I expected.  But then again, it probably was frozen and that altered the texture a bit.

* Steamed mussels \"red curry, white wine and coconut cream\" ($8) - My favorite of the bunch, full of flavor in this red curry with two slices of toasted cheese bread for dipping.  I saved the sauce for my paella and bread.

* Ahi tuna skewer \"mango, basil, mustard-ginger glaze\" ($10) - Cooked tuna, which I don't care for too much.  Our friend got lured into ordering this by the waitress he thought was cute.

* Paella \"saffron rice, clams, shrimp, calamari, chicken, Spanish chorizo sausage\" ($15) - Good stuff with lots of good stuff in it.  Tasty, and of course, even better with the red curry sauce from the Steamed Mussels dish.

* Sparkling Sangria ($24 pitcher) - Enough to fill at least five glasses and really tasty too.  It's a light drink, with only a bit of fruit bits in it.  But definitely enjoyable by guys and girls.  We ordered another pitcher during our visit.

Overall, some food times are good and standout-worthy while others can remain unseen.  The sangria is perfect for sharing and has enough alcohol in it for you to be feeling pretty good.  Service was better in the beginning with our waitress checking up on us and our dirty plates disappearing in a timely manner.  It slacked off a bit when our waitress didn't come around anymore and when the busboys were a bit overanxious in trying to clear plates that weren't empty yet.

3.5 stars

Happy Hour: Mondays through Thursdays: 3 pm to 6 pm
Fridays: 3 pm to 5 pm (1/2 off all drinks)

Tuesdays: Latin Night, from 10 pm to 2 am (salsa, meringue, cumbia, rock, no cover)"}
{"text":"I'll preamble with a disclosure of my hatred of Vegas.  But, for being in Vegas, this place was pretty mellow.  The food was good and they had a lot of good wines on the menu.  The prices were also surprisingly great.  

I had a glass of wine and we each ordered one or two dishes each (tapas, so order more than just one per person).  I walked out spending $21 with tip.

I found the service to be a little bit slow, but I won't raise a huge stink about it because it was admittedly very busy and our waiter otherwise did a great job.

I would recommend this place highly.  Start your night off here and have a good time in this terrible city.

There's a good cigar bar and shop in the same strip mall, too.

All of the hot girls come here and its good for groups.  I recommend sitting so you can face the door and lurk the homegirls."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times and I really loved it the first time. This time it was just okay, although the sangria maintains five stars on it's own. We had a pitcher between the two of us girls and I think I drank 3/4 of it. 

Don't bother with the grouper and the beef skewers, which were so-so. But loved the macaroni and cheese...that's a definite must have. I think I had the sausages on a trip a couple years ago and that's a good one too.

I've got to hand it to them, though. This is a great place for a party. Lots of people having good times here, so the atmosphere is lively and fun. Even we got sucked into a bachelor party celebration.

But really...I came for the sangria more than the food...comes in red, white and sparkling. I've only tried the red, and like I said, I drank most of it by myself...little lush that I am."}
{"text":"A wide variety of choices, good signature sangria and cozy decor. The place is not big but big enough to accommodate groups in a comfortable setting. The wait was fairly long at about 30 minutes but it was worth the wait. 

I enjoyed most dishes but some were mediocre at best. Their mushroom and steak kabobs were pretty bad- meat being not the best quality. While this place is really good for the price, you're not getting best quality meats as expected. Be careful when choosing your dishes because its very easy to go overboard and order too much. My favorite was the shrimp Ceviche which was deliciously refreshing! Overall, I'll be back here if I'm really hungry and want lots of food for good price. But considering there are so many more 4-5 star options nearby on the strip, I'll pass if I have more money to spend on food."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. Excellent customer service. Its a Tapas Bar...small portions appetizers. Just a handfull of full dish/menu. Ordered the beef skewer...wow tasty. The hubby ordered the petite sirloin.he was happy with his choice.

Just FYI: on the pricey end...but its worth it...at least for me"}
{"text":"I am late in finishing this review and can't wait to get back!! As mentioned in other reviews this place is off the strip and you can tell mainly for locals. There was a minimal wait to be seated but okay since we were getting started on our pitcher of Sangria. 

I have been to Spain and the tapas here are very authentic and the customer service is excellent. 

What we ate: Red sangria, firefly fish sticks, lamb chops, apple and manchego salad, camarones a la diabla, veggie empanada, chocolate cherry bread pudding, banana nutella sandwich. All delicious!!"}
{"text":"This. Place. Is. AWESOME.

I cannot express this enough. The tapas here are so delicious to the point it's exciting. It's exciting because the plates are small but SO packed with flavor. The menu is practically an all-go menu. No matter what you choose, it will always be satisfying. I have tried maybe every dish on their menu due to my constant cravings. I guess that's what makes it exciting -- you never know what to expect but you will always know your taste buds will be happy. Another thing you can't miss while you're here: their mimosas and their flavored mojitos. 

If you're looking for a good time with friends, or here for a first date, you won't be disappointed. 

Omnomnom"}
{"text":"The sangria is excellent!  Get the pitcher. Everything we ordered was fabulous.  Service was also great.  You will enjoy.  Shrimp, ceviche, octopus oh yeah and the dates wrapped in bacon are awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Tapas!!! One of my favorite things in the world. I love variety. I'm not the person to order a pasta plate with one sauce and one type of noodle with some toasted bread in the side. I love different things in 1 meal. With firefly you can have multiple things in 1 meal therefor satisfying all your hearts wants and desires. 

Beet salad-amazing
Ceviche- spectacular
Spinach salad- divine

We probably had about 8 other plates of different stuff that made my tummy happy! They are kinda famous for their different flavored mojitos. I tried my husbands watermelon one, it was good. I tried my father in laws blueberry one, it was good, but I got just a plain lime and mint mojito that was by far the best. Stick to the original. Tapas places are not for everyone but they make my knees weak and I will totally go back here the next time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Disappointed. After reading the reviews it was a let down. Food was just ok and service was poor. I would suggest going to a different  place."}
{"text":"Found the place a few years ago and every time we go to Vegas we always stop and enjoy some lunch and sangria! We usually order 4 plates and share, the staff is always very pleasant!"}
{"text":"This place is worth checking out. It provides a comforting & spacious atmosphere plus delicious tapas & sangria. Come with a group and order many items collectively so that everyone can try a multitude of dishes (as one would at a dim sum restaurant). I recommend the bacon wrapped dates, shrimp diablo, lamb, skewers with filet mignon/shrimp/ chorizo, fries, octopus/potato dish, mac n cheese, and of course the red sangria :) Service was good. Expect around a total of $30/person in order to leave very satisfied."}
{"text":"Real Tapas!! Delicious tapas! Estrella Galicia lager.  Killer Mojitos!"}
{"text":"A perfect night.

I had a very large party to celebrate my birthday, and even though our reservations were last minute on a Saturday night of a three day weekend, they gave us the best table in the place.  Prime view of the Fremont Street experience.

They also did not insist on our entire party being present before seating us, which is super cool.  

The food was AMAZING, the service was efficient and best of all, they put up with me and all of my drunk ass friend attempting to reenact Caligula's Greatest Hits.

so yeah, don't ask me what we ordered, because I really can't recall anything except the Mojitos  (which were pretty great.).  But hey, it's tapas so I'm pretty sure there were fried potatoes, mussels, olives and manchengo cheese, shrimp ceviche, and empanadas.  And given the fact that I'm a pretty finicky bitch, the fact that I don't recollect complaining about anything bodes well for the food quality. 

I didn't see the bill, but judging from the prices on the menu it was REALLY inexpensive for what you get.  Definitely the best bang for my buck in Vegas, and I've had a lot of bangs."}
{"text":"Came here during the week and had great service all around. The host and our waiter had great customer service and anyone who dropped food off at our table were very friendly. The food is amazing and the atmosphere is fantastic!! It's been a while since my husband and I have been down here so when we went it was the exact same delicious food! Can't wait to come back again real soon!!"}
{"text":"This place gets a big thumbs up from me! A great place to share food with a group of friends. Just to name a few, we got the bacon wrapped dates, tuna tartare, mac & cheese, and more! The tuna tartare came with taro chips, which were very light and complimented the raw tuna perfectly. I was hesitant about trying the bacon wrapped dates, but it was one of my favorite dishes of the night. The saltiness from the bacon paired well with the sweet juicy dates. Firefly is one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas!!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant that we go to every time we're in town.  It's just off the strip, and it's a nice way to get away from the long lines and tourists.  They offer both indoor and outdoor seating.  All the tapas are great - some of our favorites are the thai beef salad and the tuna tartare.  Both are very refreshing and a good combination of ingredients.  And of course, their sangria goes with all of their dishes!"}
{"text":"cant say enough LOVE this place a little packed on the weekends wish the would take reservations...but worth the wait from the food to the sangria NO complaints located near the strip"}
{"text":"Perfect late night meal. Every bite was flavorful yet light. The ribs were perfectly cooked and the steak and mushroom skewers were melt in your mouth. We also ordered the Serrano ham and manchego cheese plate, empanada, fries and calamari and have no complaints. Everything was perfect."}
{"text":"What a nice change of pace! I was visiting  head for work and getting tired of eating on the Strip. The reviews don't lie....this place is phenomenal! 

A local eatery with delicious food and even better prices! There were four of us dining and we all got 2-3 tapas each and it was more than enough! 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"My first love for tapas started here in 2009, at the other location where it was always crowded and there was no place to walk. The old location was much more entertaining.

The food was great. Their butter is so good I can eat a whole tub of it. My husband still loves this place and like Pinball HF we come here every visit to LV. 

I don't like this place much anymore because I have had better. They lost their touch. The warm salad is just warm lemon juice on greens. So plain. Should change up the menu, or go back to the old menu. Tapas is an adventure to me but Firefly decided to get married. 

Four stars because he loves it and I think it's ok. Worth a try. All our friends now love this place. 

They use to give out really cute matchboxes but not anymore. Boo."}
{"text":"Yummy Yummy Yummy but not as good as Julian Serrano at Aria.

Firefly is definitely solid.  I think most people will walk away from there extremely happy about their meal.  However, once you've had the potatoes bravas at Julian Serrano and compare them to what you get here you'll know what I'm talking about.  The bravas here is just a little bland and not as interesting as at Julian.
The same basically goes for all the dishes you get.  Firefly is upper middle class and Julian Serrano is elite.  

But you'll get away from Firefly for about 40% less than you will at the Aria joint.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The food was good and this place might work its way to 4 stars eventually. But the service was spotty and I was only in love with half of what I had. Ham and Cheese Croqueta was great along with the Empanda. The dates and Tuna skewers skip."}
{"text":"Excellent experience. First time doing the Tapas thing and was not disappointed. The food and drinks were perfect and I would highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I really don't get the rave reviews about this place. To me the food was mediocre at best and way overpriced!  I tried a couple of the tapas including the steak and mushroom skewers, Mac and cheese, this baked egg thing and the stuffed mushrooms. Each dish was tapas sized and looked pretty but it didn't taste that great to me at all. 

The Mac and cheese was not bad. Very creamy rather than cheesy actually, but it wasn't special or great. The beef skewers were wayyyyy saucy. The whole plate was covered in 3 types of sauce. Although presented nicely as the sauce made pretty patterns, the skewers weren't that flavorful and the beef was chewy!  The egg thing was a super disappointment. It had the same roasted red pepper garnish as the Mac and cheese and beef skewers ( how lame.. Same garnish for all your dishes?) with a piece of potato inside?  It was very flavorless. The stuffed mushrooms were ok. I've had better. The mushrooms were good.. the chicken paste they stuffed it with was kind of weird. 

It's a nice big place with nice outdoor seating and a full bar. Service was good, ambiance was good, parking was good. Everything was pretty great except the food haha. I will not come here again unless someone chooses to eat here for their birthday. :(."}
{"text":"We've been to Firefly on Paradise Rd. and since we happened to be in this part of Vegas, we decided to try it out.

This location is much bigger and a bit more trendy compared to the Paradise Rd. location however, that's not necessarily a good thing.

The menu offerings are exactly the same as the other Firefly location.  This time around the s/o of course had to order the Bacon Wrapped Dates, which are always a hit.  We also ordered the Ham & Cheese Croquettes which were okay, kind of reminded of a Fried Cheese Stick.  I ordered the Stuffed Mushrooms and totally forgot I ordered that the last time and didn't like it much, thankfully I did remember to ask for lemon to squeeze over it, which in fact did help tremendously.  Not sure why but, I ordered their Fried Calamari, which was really basic but wow, it was greasy.  You know that lethargic feeling you get after eating greasy food...thanks Calamari!

The service...oh boy, this is where they fail and why they lost so many stars from me.

Our server who I won't call out, was really blah.  When he introduced himself, he didn't go the extra mile about talking about Happy Hour, any specials, etc. he just simply asked what we'd like to drink.  To sum it up, we saw him four times; first to introduce himself, second to take our order and last to bring the check and return the change.  I did have to roll my eyes when he asked, \"Any change needed?\"  Eff yeah dude!  However, credit is due to the food runners and bussers, they were the ones that provided us spectacular service.  I wish we could've given them the tip instead of our server.

Overall, nice location but we won't be back, we'd rather go to Paradise Rd. instead."}
{"text":"This Firefly location has to be our ultimate favorite.  It's unassuming, intimate and the service is pretty good, not to mention, the food is quite spectacular!

First off, it was a great sign when they serve us the bread and we were noshing on it as if we've never eaten bread before.  We can attribute it's deliciousness to the spread it came with.  I wouldn't say it was butter as it had a cheesy consistency and had a strong hint of almonds.  Whatever it was, it's was crack and I'm hooked!

The s/o fell in love with their Bacon Wrapped Dates.  In fact, love is an understatement as the s/o ordered two plates of it.  I'm not a fan of dates but I'll admit, it was a blast for my palette.

We also ordered the Filet Mignon sliders which were awesome,  you can't help but love the fried onions in them!  In addition, the Ceviche was delicious as well as the Empanadas.  I ordered the Stuffed Mushrooms which were just okay.  The filling was a bit dry, it could've used a little sauce or at least a lemon wedge to squeeze over it.  Lastly, the Mac and Cheese were like wow, it's not your Mac & Cheese in a box, that's for sure!

Overall, Firefly has become one of our fave restos off the hustle and bustle of the Strip.  It'll definitely be a spot we'll hit every time we're in Vegas!"}
{"text":"This was our first time here and we came as a party of 3. We ordered the mixed paella, and it was fantastic! The paella was more than enough for the 3 of us. I also ordered the sangria, and it was very good. The waiters were very attentive and friendly. The customer service was excellent. The atmosphere was nice but there was loud music playing so it was hard to make conversation. Nonetheless, I would highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Love love love this place.

Food: 
Stuffed dates-blue cheese stuffed and wrapped with bacon. What? You can't go wrong with these bad boys. 
Ham & Cheese Croquetas-just your basic ham and cheese popper, right? I think not.  I loved these.
Pulpo Asado-pretty good. Not great. Perhaps a tad bit overdone, not sure.  
Roasted eggplant cannelloni-light and fresh. 
Filet mignon sliders-tasty and substantial. 

Service: 
Great. No wait on a Friday night, but then again, it was around midnight.
Attentive waiters, quick food turnaround.  

Price: 
Each dish can run anywhere from $4 to $10 for the tapas and since you'll be ordering quite a few, it can get a bit pricey.  Throw in a pitcher of the must have sangria for $24 and you've got yourself quite the bill.  Still, in the town of excess, this is still a bargain.  

This is definitely a must try place."}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite place in Vegas! I have been going here for about 4 years now. The service is very good and quick. The tapas are absolutely amazing. You can share them or just keep them all to yourself. The sangria is the best ive had and the infused vodka is made at the restaurant over a 2 week fruit marinating process. The atmosphere is very loungy and the staff knows not to rush you. They encourage you to sit around and relax. They play a graet eclectic mix of music. Being a DJ, I am very picky. If you like the paintings on the wall, they are for sale. The deserts are awesome. I highly recommend the tres leches. I have brought hundreds of people to this place including my mom who is never satisfied anywhere and she wont stop asking me about this place. Everyone loves the place and so will you."}
{"text":"I've been to every firefly location in town. This particular location in the summerlin area I've been to a couple of times and the service really wasn't all that great. 

I do love everything I've tried on the menu which is a good handful of items. I cannot say anything bad about the food on a positive note. Personal favorites are the firefly fries - crispy and served with shredded Parmesan cheeses and really good dipping sauce, delicate little bacon-wrapped dates, spicy beef salad, calamari, tomato soup, sliders, chicken skewers, empanadas, and a few others. At every location the food is similarly presented every time and is absolutely delicious. The prices are a little high for tapas, but a few options shared will still leave everyone with a full and happy belly. 

The one thing you always have to get when you come with a group of friends is a pitcher of sangria or the passion fruit mojitos. So yummy! 

The service at this particular location however is another story. It has never really been outstanding. First of all, the hostesses were not pleasant and did not really appear like they wanted to be working there. 

Our waiter was hardly that friendly and did not return once to our table to check up on us and see how we were doing when we had dined there for about two hours. The busser was not very nice either. She came a few times to see if we were done with our plates when I was clearly still eating and when I told her that she seemed really annoyed. 

We asked for another serving of bread to go with our cheese fondue dish and she forgot about that. Since our waiter never came back once I had to track him down in order for us to get a chance to order some of the Nutella crepe dessert that they have. 

I think waitstaff is pretty important. They make a big part of the dining experience and contribute to the ambiance of the place. I am not trying to bag on this restaurant at all because I know I'll be back for the food, but I sure hope I'll get waited by people who know what impeccable customer service is like next time."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.

We didn't get out of the airport until past 8:30pm, and no one wanted to be around for the appearance of HANGRY SUSASAURUS, so thank the lord we were seated within 2 min of entering Firefly.

SERVICE: very good. They brought us delicious garlicky bread almost immediately upon seating us; our water glasses never went empty, and our plates were whisked away as soon as we were done. They even changed out our dirty plates for us.

AMBIANCE: dimly lit, I can see how this is a favorite spot for pregaming before going out. It was loud and rowdy, but I had no problems with the noise level.

FOOD: almost everything is tapas style. J and I shared:
- Octopus: J liked it-- it was good except that the octopus' texture threw me off. It was slightly mushy, which made me think that it had recently undergone a poor freeze-thaw cycle.
- Short ribs: yummy, but the sauce tasted EXACTLY like sweet and sour sauce from a place like Panda Express. It was amusing and completely unexpected.
- Lamb sausages: pretty good. A tiny bit gamy, but I still gobbled it up.

OVERALL: a fun place to snack a bit before an epic night of partying, or just chilling for the night."}
{"text":"Really good sangria; food is really good. Nice venue for a party or a small social gathering with friends."}
{"text":"I chose Firefly for our large group based on the excellent yelp reviews and the fact that we can all share our tapas and not leave the restaurant with having paid an arm and a leg.  Here are some of the things that we loved: Mushroom Tart, Stuffed Peppers, Tuna Tartare, Stuffed Dates, Tierra Y Mar, and Camaron A La Diabla.  I would skip the Patatas Bravas, Baked Filet of Tilapia and Chicken Skewers because they were less interesting.  We also had the regular and blood orange sangria and it was delicious.  Our waiter was excellent and even got us a large taxi to get back to the strip.  By the way, we paid $27 each for food and two glasses of sangria. Great experience for our group celebrating a birthday!"}
{"text":"Skyler the bartender was outstanding. Should be nominated bartender of the year!!!! Great drinks and service."}
{"text":"Great food. Good selection but not too much. I had friends from out of town and they really enjoyed trying and sharing everything. No one was disappointed with their selections. Service was impeccable. Will definitely go again."}
{"text":"Now my new favorite place to eat!!!
Ordered a few items and all were/are AMAZING! Ambience and service were just as amazing as the food. 
I can't recommend a favorite dish because they were all equally delish! We ordered the Lamb chops, Smoked salmon bagel, Goat cheese toast, Skewers (Fillet, mignon, shrimp, chorizo), Mushroom tartar, and spicy calamari...can't recall if we ordered more. MUST TRY!"}
{"text":"They lose a star for the service we received from our waiter, Ivan. He was disengaged, unfriendly, and seemed annoyed which put a damper on our reunion with our friends.
The drinks were high priced and not good. No one liked their drinks. The pear ginger martinis were syrupy sweet. We asked for spicy margaritas and there was no heat at all.
BUT, the food was AMAZING. Huge selection of delectable tapas. The croquettes were delicious and everyone's favorite. The stuffed dates were little flavor bombs. The clams with chorizo were amazing. We asked for more bread THREE TIMES to sop up the sauce and never got it. Eggplant around goat cheese was delish. Chicken tinca empanadas were good. Our least favorites were the stuffed piquillo peppers and chorizo stuffed mushrooms (which needed a sauce).
I would come again for the food but if we got service like we did last night again, I would never come back."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try a tapas place on the strip the night before we came here and it really made me appreciate Firefly so much more.  Here are a few of my favorites.

Sangria:  perfect balance between sweet and tart
Stuffed dates:  always a must, bacon perfectly crispy
Roasted eggplant cannelloni:  oh so creamy
Manchego Mac'n'Cheese:  added lbs. to my b*tt almost immediately 
Tres Leches:  One of the last things I would like to eat in my lifetime:)


These are a few of the delicious dishes we enjoyed on our last visit as well as a few more.  Our server met us with a smile each time he approached our table and knew the menu inside and out.  As our experience came to and end and we were given our bill, I seriously thought our serve must have forgotten some items since I had just been to an over priced underwhelming joint the night before.  Indeed our check was correct and the affordable prices at Firefly are just one more great quality that add to a spectacular dining experience.

Until next time....:)"}
{"text":"Of course, let me just preface this by saying that Firefly has always been and will continue to be my favorite tapas restaurant here in Vegas.  Tonight's experience however, didn't WOW me as others have in the past, for a few reasons:

1. The hostess staff was, to say the least, inconsistent and a little rude.  Prior to our arrival, I called this location to possibly get a reservation set for two people, as they are always busy.  The hostess informed me that they aren't accepting reservations, however, there is NO wait and to just come on in.  When we got there 10 minutes later, the same young woman who answered my call informed me that there was a 20 minute wait.  Hungry at this point, I explained that I had called earlier to request a reservation to prevent this situation from happening.  I was rudely interrupted with a \"that's correct, we are not taking reservations.\"  Giving this young lady the benefit of the doubt (and not wanting to make a scene), we then sat down on the chairs in front of the hostess podium.  It was shortly after that, where a group of 4 approach the podium and inform the hostess that they had a reservation tonight.  To my surprise, there was in fact, a reservation set for them!  I'm really glad, though, that my table for 2 was also ready at the very moment...

2.  We ordered a lot of different tapas and drinks, as this was the first time my friend has been to Firefly.  Here are the Tapas ordered and my review for each:

Red Wine Sangria-The taste is super potent, however, this is why I love their sangria.  What I look forward to, when it comes to their sangria, are the little chopped chunks of fruit floating in this drink.  The only thing floating in our pitcher tonight was ice.  What a disappointment.  Trust me though, that didn't stop us from finishing that pitcher.

Stuffed Dates-C'mon!  Who doesn't love a bacon wrapped date, stuffed with smoked almonds and blue cheese over a red wine reduction sauce.  Yum-o.  This dish has always been and always will be \"on point\" for me.  You get a salty taste, obviously from the bacon and blue cheese, combined with the sweetness from the dates.  This dish is \"AH-MAZE-ING!\"

Firefly Fries-I honestly think I've these same fries at PT's Bar before.  Not as a dig to Firefly, but I think the aioli is what I think they use to distinguish this dish from other competition.  To me however, the aioli is their way of dressing up the word \"mayonnaise,\" as that aioli is nothing but mayo.

Comorones A La Diabla-One of my favorite tapas dishes at Firefly.  I think the simplicity of the dish makes it so enjoyable for me.  Shrimp sauteed in a sweet-spicy chile sauce and accompanied with grilled sliced bread to mop up the leftover sauce.  The shrimp was perfectly cooked and the grilled bread really helped me to clean off that plate.

Lobster Escargots-I always love to commend restaurants for thinking outside the box and presenting dishes in a creative way.  Please know that the word escargots is accompanied with quotation marks because you're just eating lobster meat, prepared and presented to look like escargots.  In my personal opinion, I think it was just their way of serving less.  The dish didn't really make an impression.  Lobster meat in butter, garlic and herbs.  You'll get more for your money at Red Lobster.

Chicken and Chorizo Stuffed Mushrooms-I love a good mushroom.  This dish really offered that to me, in terms of the mushroom being cooked perfectly.  Not too over cooked, not to undercooked.  What kind of killed the dish for me was the chicken and chorizo combo. It was ball of mushy dryness that ruined the overall dish for me.  Thank goodness the melted cheese on top was there! 

Crispy Duck Roll-In my eyes, probably the worse dish I've had at Firefly.  The Hoisin sauce was too tart, the duck was SUPER dry and grinded up, causing this really weird texture combination for me.  Not a good dish.  As a suggestion, maybe using chunks of dark meat, not grinded and searing the meat prior to stuffing the roll and deep frying.  Not \"on point\" at all.

Lamb Skewers-Let me just say that when I started coming to Firefly 3 years ago, this has always been my number 1 favorite dish to order.  I love lamb, I love lentils and I love the combination of the two.  Tonight was no different.  This dish really makes my heart sing lol.  The seared, medium rare lamb meat skewered, on a bed of lentils, tomatoes and red wine reduction, really makes this dish soar to new heights.  This dish is truly, the reason why I keep coming back to this restaurant.

Overall, my love for this restaurant will always supercede the love I have for other tapas restaurants.  Tonight's experience was mediocre at best, however, the reason for my 4 star rating is that Firefly's ambiance really shows me that this restaurant \"gets it.\"  The vibe is very intimate, very chill, very hip.  It feels trendy, refined and chic.  I have been there many times and will continue to go there for years to come."}
{"text":"Our review looks like most of the other 163 not recommended ones hidden at the back section. Ready, hit and miss has become more on the miss side. This trip was special as we drove over for wife's birthday. We come to LV every month and eat here every time. It was @ 10:00 pm and we were seated next to 2 tables of 2. Our server a Ukrainian girl came over after say \"15 minutes\" and took our drink order. Never told us her name, failed to describe sangria, left to get drinks. About that time both couples on each side told us here is where the fun starts. Twenty minutes later she returned with one of the two drinks. She said I'll be right back. I said wait we want to order!  She took our order and again split. Now 40 minutes into this celebration she returns with the drink. I asked how do we get bread ?  One of the bus boys brings out \"cold hard bread\". What seamed like days, our food comes out and she drops and tried to split. I ask her if we could have warm bread. She can only give us what is ready in the kitchen. I explained we have dined here at least 35 times and have never been told that. A busboy returned with warm bread. She never came back to see if everything was ok, if we wanted to order anything else, or need another drink. We had dessert and left thinking do we ever want to return again! Walked into dark scary parking lot in back to find our six week old car smashed in the back and broken tail light. Go ahead hide us in the back so no one can see us.  Just like you will never see us again."}
{"text":"If you want TAPAS! TAPAS! TAPAS! Go to FIREFLY! FIREFLY! FIREFLY!

There are already over 100 reviews for this place with an average of 4 stars so really, need I say more?

1) Great prices. Get the empanadas, spicy beef salad, flan, stuffed mushroom, banana & nutella and I can go on and on....

2) Three-day prepared Sangria (deeeeee-lightful!)

3) Great lounge-y vibe and atmosphere (Red walls! Aquariaum above the entrance to the main room! Neeeeeat! )

Nice place off the strip.  Parking can get a little crazy because this place seems to always be so JAM PACKED but can you blame them?  People gravitate towards this place because it's a fun atmosphere to share  some laughs with friends while drinking Sangria by the pitcher :)

Can't wait for Vegas summer nights out on the patio.  

Definitely recommend making reservations first.  Thanks to our new friends Sergio and Vivian for introducing us!"}
{"text":"I'm glad my friend and I tried this place out a couple of weeks ago.  We took a cab here from our hotel and surprisingly it wasn't that far from the Vegas Strip.  We ended waiting for about 20-30 minutes before we got seated and as soon as we were seated, we didn't hesitate to order.  Problem was, our waiter wasn't ready to order and was no where to be found!  After 15 minutes we finally flagged him down to take our order because we were HUNGRY! 
 
The stuffed dates were delicious.  The beet salad, however should be called the pecan salad because we had about 4 tiny slices of beets and a whole lot of pecans (sigh).  The tuna tartare wasn't the best I've ever had, but it was definitely fresh.  The paella was large and flavorful, so I'd get that again the next time for sure.  The steamed mussels were so so and the filet burgers was alright, but probably only because I was too full from the other plates to really enjoy it (sigh).

Although I only gave this place a 3 star, I'd come back again simply because it was a nice change away from food on the strip and the menu was surprisingly cheap. I love the vibe this place gives out, it was definitely a cool place to be and seemed like a fun hangout spot for the locals.  Hopefully the service is a bit better next time (I had to flag him down many times for basic needs).  

I'm looking forward to my next Vegas trip so I can try the other tapas on the menu!"}
{"text":"Last minute decided to try this place out with my boyfriend and our friend. The service was great, super nice waiter. Ordered our foods and drinks and it was out pretty quick. It was all so delicious! Especially loved the stuffed dates. Going to be back when I'm in town."}
{"text":"I've had Firefly food at events, but have not yet graced them with a visit. Our Yelparazzi Angela H.'s farewell party was reason enough to head down for Yelpacious Dishes. 

I came late so I didn't order too much, but grabbed:

 Boquerones which has Spanish white anchovies (not the salted kind), red peppers, avocado and light chili oil drizzle on toast...said it has yellow pepper vin in the menu, but didn't see it on there? Overall, this is nice and really is a no fail dish. I love any kind of briny, lemony fish on crusty bread. 

Pulpo Asado which has grilled octopus, potato, tomato stirred in what taste like mojo (garlic, oil and citrus). Pretty good, but there is a consistency that is a bit soft/mushy on parts of the octopus that either tells me this was frozen too long or was precooked/overcooked (octo gets tough and chewy, then gets soft if you keep going). The flavors were good, but there was just the freshness aspect that I question since some pieces didn't have that octopi snappy chewiness. 

Banana Nutella Sandwiches- simple, good....who doesn't like nutella, bananas and crispy grilled up bread? I can make this at home ( I shouldn't- Nutella and I have a dangerous romance) , but this is a ingenious comfort dessert that appeals to a lot of people. 

I got an ice tea and I know we were a big party, but service please? .....maybe refill us? I got one refill of tea in a wine size glass and I did have to ask for it. Someone said that one end of the table got bread, but the other table didn't. Also that some people got some refills, but most didn't. They got 20% gratuity automatically because we were a big crowd. Sure it's a given tip, but if you work a little you might get some extra tip. Looked like the server was expecting more when we asked for change back and there was nothing inside the tab. I'm a very fair tipper (I go up or down from my standard 20%, last place I ate at- they received 30% tip ) and no, I did not think 20% gratuity was even fair if I can't get some tea in 100*+ heat. 

 I just didn't think Firefly was very accommodating. Firstly, they told us that a majority of the party needs to be there on time or they are giving out table away in 15 minutes. We planned this weeks ago, it's a Yelp event, so people will show. It's my fucking main bitches party, I'll come even if I got a leg amputated hat day dammit.  They wont split checks for a group of maybe 18 Yelpers, not even maybe split into smaller sections so it's easier to pay. We had to work it out with cash and do the math to get the bill right. So keep that in mind if you're coming in a big party- don't invite the bill moocher friend...I know everyone has one.

 This would make a good date night restaurant with the BF or a spot to bring visitors during \"off\" hours.  Tapas is one of my favorite things so the draw of sangria and plates will eventually bring me back, but I wont be back with a big party- ever."}
{"text":"Firefly had amazing food and great cocktails. My favorite dish was the bacon wrapped stuffed dates. The bread and butter they bring out to your table is amazing as well as the stuffed peppers. The service was great, it was a little loud, but not too bad. I would definitely come back for tapas."}
{"text":"WOW!  This place was very good.  I got the paella and really enjoyed.  I also liked the mussels.  The atmosphere was great and the service was excellent.  This was trul"}
{"text":"The tapas were excellent.  I highly recommend the dates with bacon and the shrimp.  The thing I was most excited about was the paella, but when it came it had been cooked with too much water.  As a result the rice was soggy and it just wasn't good."}
{"text":"What can I say this place is absolutely AMAZING!  I've always loved tapas and this place does not disappoint and the paella here is to die for.  Generally me and my girlfriend get a order of paella and 3 apetizers and leave pretty happy.
  I also recommend the Sangria.  Buy the pitcher....it is worth the $25.  If you like fruiter drinks get the white sangria but if you like dryer wine the I suggest getting the red.
  By far however the best part of this restaraunt is the view...which is stunning.  Most of the restaraunt is in a glass dome which overlooks all of fremont.  It is one of the better views in Las Vegas and definitely the best view of Fremont street.
  Finally I suggest ussing www.opentable.com to make you reservations.  You can make reservations online and definitely make sure you request a window view, which is by far the best view in the house."}
{"text":"Halloween was a clusterbitch and I just wanted something to nosh and to sit the hell down! With Firefly in the horizon, it seemed a better choice than fast food and diners in most the DT properties. 

BF and the Yelpizzles Elnino and Andy were my company. 

The BF and I weren't too hungry so we shared

Boquerones- one of my faves. I love white spanish sardines. 
Veggie Empanadas- comes with 2 and some salad. It was pretty good....I appreciate that the veggies werent processed down to a paste and were stuffed with slices of mushrooms and diced spinach. 
Chorizo and Chicken Stuffed Mushrooms- meh. My BF said it reminds him of Hamburger Helper on a mushroom. After he said that, that's all I can get in my head. Won't order this one again. 
Dessert Platter- comes with chocolate tres leches, passionfruit cheesecake, lemon tart, flan. All pretty decent. I liked the idea of the chocolate leches, I really like the passionfruit, tart was okay, flan was a surprise that it was good ( light, almost panna cotta like).

Got a white sangria since I usually get red. It was alright....it's a bit tart which I like, but I dunno...I think the bolder red makes more sense with tart fruits. 

Now the service was spotty and wait for items was kinda long. I however wasn't going to dock them down for it only because our server was very apologetic and really tried to help her tables. I looked around and the place was filled and  there wasn't enough staff coverage for the volume. I always feel bad when that happens because it's not the servers fault if they get spread thin. Someone could have called in and screwed everyone or upper management/owners haven't hired enough people. Tapas is about sitting around and chatting so I wasn't in a hurry. Just keep that in mind though- come when you feel like having a long nosh since speed and service isn't a strong suit. 

I'm a \"fan\" so I put it up to a 4 star since my visit was positive, but it's a round up since there are some obvious hangups."}
{"text":"Omg food was seriously DELICIOUS! Great Service, outdoor patio was spacious and nicely lit. Sangria was definitely a 10. Definitely a place to try if you want to share and try different flavors!"}
{"text":"I was skeptical to come back here, but my friend was insistent on getting tapas. I thought the food was okay, but it wasn't mind-numbingly amazing and mouth watering.

AMBIANCE: 4 - I'm not gonna deny that this is a really nice venue. It is dimly lit with very organized tables inside. Also, they let you sit wherever you want to. With the dim lights, and sitting with my best friend \"alone\" in the lounge--it was pretty romantic haha! The whole place is very lounge-like, and actually pretty comfortable. 

SERVICE: 3 - As with many places, the service was pretty good in the beginning, and got slower and worse towards the end! Most of the food came out fast, but some of them came out an hour later than the rest! 

FOOD: 3 - I don't have any food that I really want to shine a light on. None of it really popped out at me or was really amazing that it was worth mentioning. Probably the best part of the meal was my strawberry mojito, which was pretty well done! 

I'm going to say this as a generalization, because this happened with all the dishes we ordered. The food taste was average to above average. But, with every dish there was major problems such as really dry meat, it sometimes tasted off or not right, or the cheese that they used wasn't as luxurious tasting compared to the rest of the dish. 

In conclusion, it was good, but it wasn't great. 

Lastly, I don't wanna be one of those people, but I think I should mention this anyway..My friend and I both got stomach aches not long after we ate. I had never eaten there since 2010 or 2011 and my friend had never eaten at Firefly previously. 

My real complaint is that they should have kept the Firefly on the west side open instead of this one!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place and I always come here. Whenever friends are in town or I am trying to impress a friend with a Vegas local hot spot, this is my go-to place. 
My favorites include:
Apple and manchego salad
Tuna Tartare
Stuffed Dates
Scallop / Excargots
Petite Filet
Last time we visited we ventured out of the comfort zone and ordered some plates for the very first time. My new favorite is actually the Herb-roasted chicken. It is so juicy and flavorful. So many restaurants miss on chicken but this just hit the spot. It also comes with delicious crispy fries and it is very filling.

I was dreaming of their Paella since ordering in on my birthday in May and I ordered it again this time but something went terribly wrong. It was super salty and I could taste the rice distinctively as though it was not flavored well. I advised the waiter who alerted the chef. The manager was very kind. He came to our table and apologized and took the Paella off our bill. We would have loved to order one more but we had already waited 40 minutes for this one to cook and had a place to go after so we decided to pass. I love how they handled the situation. We are still loyal and will be back in the future for sure!

We also ordered their sangria pitcher and that was wonderful. It is very smooth and fruity, I think it is perfect for a light weight but only if you are sharing ;)

Overall, besides the wonderful food, the decor is beautiful with slight dim lighting. The noise level is a little higher if you sit inside but they also have outside seating with beautiful lights. It is all very fresh and exciting."}
{"text":"This was an excellent tapas option, with reasonable prices and delicious food. Additionally, they have a fairly extensive gluten free menu, which was an added bonus for our party. The atmosphere was great for a dinner before a night out on the town. Must-try dishes include the ever-classic bacon wrapped dates, the ahi tuna skewers, and the ribeye. Additionally, I didn't try the paella, but the sangria was decent."}
{"text":"Have not been here since they moved from a block away. Big n spacious, with a valet that has a sh*ty attitude. Even if i ask what you perceive to be a stupid question. ..you should still be pleasant in your response. Since i hadn't been to the new location,  and the lighting is dark the place looked closed, and the valets were just setting up their stand, so i asked if the bar was open. Response with tude was \"i guess, it should  be\". Anyway, didn't eat,  just stopped by for drink and see the decor. Good for drinks. And self park your car!!"}
{"text":"This place is my go-to when I'm in Vegas. I've also eaten at fancy places on the Strip, but I'll take Firefly over them! I've only had their tapas, drinks, and Big Bowl salad, but everything has been amazing. For tapas, I've tried: mushroom tart, chicken skewers, petite filet, stuffed dates, ham croquetas, apple and manchego salad, garden variety salad. Each dish has been beautifully presented with a tantalizing combination of flavors. Their sangria and Fly Mule are awesome too! Really, I don't think you can go wrong with anything here. I'll try their paella sometime, but can't seem to get away from the tapas!"}
{"text":"Crowded on a Thursday night, but not really worth the wait. We had fun, and the bar is decent, but the service was average (which for Vegas is code for \"not great\") and the food is fair. A few good tapas (I particularly liked the crispy duck egg-roll thing), most were only OK and not that special. Lots of Asian-fusion tapas, which sounds like it would be good, but it wasn't really (except the duck thing). I much would have preferred amazing Spanish dishes.

I also was a little surprised that the inside was almost exactly the same as the old Z Tejas, just a new paint job. I never liked the step-down dining room and I think a complete renovation of the space would have been better.

Quite frankly, the reason it was so crowded is because there's a dearth of places like it in or near Summerlin. Which made it fun to go to, but I'm not rushing back anytime soon.

{"text":"We were a party of six celebrating a friend birthday and we didn't mention to any one that we are celebrating a birthday..but they still manage to bring a cake just because they overheard us and this is going above and beyond the duty and we really appreciated it.besids the food you can't go wrong with any on the entree. 
Love this place"}
{"text":"If you don't have to be downtown skip this location and head to the original on Paradise & Flamingo. The menu is exactly the same but the food just doesn't taste as good downtown. I had the feeling it was just pre-made & microwaved since they managed to get our 6 dishes out in less than 5 minutes after ordering on a busy Saturday night."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise.  Food, service and ambience were well above average. I can't believe locals won't swamp this place.  Tourists are lucky to find it."}
{"text":"Just call me the Firefly barfly! Love this place. Been to three locations now (one closed and reopened a few metres away)

Simply put: Best tuna tartare ever!
Refreshing gazpacho and a delightful selection of tapas.

They have a nice happy hour that is 1/2 off cocktails in the bar area.

I could go on and on, but I have already! (Read my previous reviews)
It's the fun and tasty Firefly and its just on the Westside!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend was feeling an Ibiza themed night. After having a lazy Sunday soaking in the sun at the pool we started to talk about dinner plans.

Now I have been to Firefly on a couple of occasions to mainly grab a small bite at the bar and enjoy their great happy hour special. This was my second full dinner and now I can say it has easily become my go-to spot.

The decor is a fiery spanish inspired theme with lovely paintings of the flamenco dancers draped on the walls. The room is separated into three dining areas, one inside, separated by the bar, one mid point with a glass wall allowing you to peek outside and another just outside with heat lamps to keep it tolerable on the chillier nights. Firefly is festive with spanish music blasting in the background. It's a fun spot and always busy. Great to go alone or to dine in a small group. Reservations are highly recommended, although most times I've been lucky and was sat right away. 

The service is spot on at the tables. The food is quick. The bussers are always cleaning up and the servers - (the best is Juan) are always smiling and ready for any question you have. I would have to say the bartenders need some work because I think they live in their own planet and are too busy chatting with each or checking their phones instead of engaging with the guest (from one bartender to another: that's what a guest looks for when they choose to dine at the bar, especially if they are alone)

Food. Yummy. Great Value. Quality ingredients.

Highly Recommend: Tuna Tartare (some of the best I've ever had and I have it a lot)
Bacon wrapped stuffed dates (very heavy so be in the mood) 
Paella (share, share, & share the goodness.

I also recommend their pitcher of Sangria. It was slightly too sweet this time around but they quickly fixed that by bringing us some fresh cut oranges to balance the sweetness (sorry but we are in the service industry and sometimes we can fix the problem ourselves). Mojito's here are fantastic too.

Another quality find in Vegas! An attestment to its success is the fact that there are three different locations! Tapas I heart you...."}
{"text":"This is my third Firefly review and of course third times a charm! I cannot find anything wrong with this concept. Tapas options are spectacular chilled, hot, seafood, meat and poultry. I haven't tried dessert because I'm usually full by then, but I can only imagine they are inspired.

Portions are a steal with prices ranging with smaller tapas $4 to hearty paellas $20. And believe me, you'll want to share that paella!! It's a lively place that I always think of going with a large group. But I must note, this new bar is large and the separation from the restaurant makes it comfortable to kick back with their sangria on your own as well.

The staff is friendly and attentive. The bartender is knowledgeable & smiles. And now this new space is bright, clean and inviting. I'm glad to see them bouncing back from the bad press they received from the shutdown.

After all, mistakes happen, and we all deserve a second chance! Wait to go Firefly! I'll see you again very soon I'm sure."}
{"text":"Firefly, oh Firefly, how I love thee!!! 

Been to this location twice now and while it doesn't have the same feel as the original on Paradise, the food is just as good. I could go on and on about Firefly, but lets just say it's one of my favorite places in Vegas and I highly recommend going if you haven't already. Although if you haven't made that decision already based on all the other great reviews, you are clearly too picky!

My only gripe with Firefly has been that there portion sizes seem to change frequently and that often the dishes are inconsistent in appearance and extras on the dish. Most noticeably to me is the Eggplant Canneloni which I've gotten several times and always seems to be different sizes. Sometimes they are big, sometimes they are small, sometimes they are medium... you get the point.

Outside of that, no major complaints."}
{"text":"A favorite stop for my friends and I, Firefly is a great off-the-Strip spot with amazing food, great atmosphere, fast service and good drinks.

You must try the Filet Mignon Sliders! Ok, I'm going to have to finish this review later because I just made myself hungry"}
{"text":"Ok, so after much anticipation after recently finding out about the new Firefly thanks to my good friend Blanche, we made the trip downtown last night to give it a shot. This locations opened up this past Friday so we went on the 5th night of business for them. My experience went as follows:
1. Had to park in self-parking at the plaza ($5) because I pulled up to the \"Firefly\" valet sign and sat there for a few minutes before giving up on anybody coming to get my car. The Plaza self-parking is scary and leaves the entranceway to the casino on the third floor leaves you in a deserted area that eerily quiet.
2. Upon arrival at Firefly I was impressed by the overall layout and atmosphere of the space.  Took some of the ambiance from the original Firefly on Paradise and added its own touch as well.
3. The staff was very friendly from the start!
4. Sat down in the \"dome\" area overlooking Freemont Street (very cool view). Not many people there.... maybe 2 or 3 other tables in the whole place were occupied.
5. Faryn was our server and she was awesome (and cute).
6. Blanche ordered the usual pitcher of red sangria while I ordered a Washington Apple (drink not shot) and we ordered some Firefly Fries to start us off. My drink came and was green (Washington Apple is usually a dark red) Faryns only mistake of the night was putting in an order for an Apple Martini instead of Washington Apple. She apologized but the drink tasted good so I kept it.
7. While waiting for Fries and looking at Menu we decided to order the Empanadas (Pork) and the Roasted eggplant cannelloni.
8. Fries took longer than they do at the original Firefly and seemed to be a smaller portion and not very hot. Somewhat disappointing.
9. The other dishes came out and were very good! Lots of flavor and nice presentation.
10. We then ordered the Firefly fish sticks and the Fried Shrimp. They didn't quite make the same impression. The fish sticks were a bit smaller than I remember and the shrimp left much to be desired for the price. Only 4 shrimp and some greens for $8.
11. We finished up there and settled our check. Faryn came over and talked to us for a bit. She was very friendly throughout the evening and made many suggestions on things to try on the menu.
12. We took off and made our way back through the eery hallways... where someone was sleeping on a chair... funny but creepy

Overall I gave it 4 stars. My reasoning is it was not bad enough to give 3 stars to but not good enough for 5. And unfortunately there are no half stars otherwise probably would have done 3 and a half. There is much room for improvement here and I will be going back in a month or so to see if they improve. It has only been open a few days so they have to work the kinks out. They received the nod up to four stars because of the overall experience and the friendliness of the staff as well as the fact that the original Firefly is one of my favorites and I strongly believe this one will get on the right track.

Oh and I will post pictures soon!"}
{"text":"Love the new location on Paradise... as much as I enjoyed the original, they had outgrown it and were in desperate need of a larger space. The parking is not great in the back of the building, but outside of that this is a huge improvement. They fit plenty of seating and you don't feel like you are right on top of the people next to you as you were in the previous location.

Love that they have a full size bar now with plenty of seating. Food was as good as always... I have a very hard time not ordering the Serrano Sliders every time I go to Firefly. It's pretty sad actually.

Wish them luck with the new location and hope they learned their lesson and continue to monitor their staff/food more closely moving forward."}
{"text":"Absolutely the greatest tapas restaurant for locals! Great Latin nights every Friday! Food comes in small tapas portions and it comes out pretty fast! Paella is to die for, just keep in mind it takes about 30-45 minutes to be made! Stuff is super friendly end it is a must visit destination when you come to Vegas!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places, delicious and quick service. Must try the Apple
Manchego salad it it amazing!"}
{"text":"My favorite tapas restaurant in Vegas.  The Sangria is to die for and I love the eggplant with goat cheese, beef and mushroom skewers and of course the paella!"}
{"text":"I wanted to check this place out because of all the great reviews on Yelp.  I was not disappointed in the least!  

The hubby and I stopped in for a \"snack\" which ended up being more like dinner because we decided to order a 2nd round of tapas since we enjoyed what we got.  The only thing that wasn't great was the mushroom tart - I think it was too runny and made the pastry soggy.  

We had the red sangria and it was very tasty.

The service was ok.  Our server disappeared for long intervals for some reason but managed to come back just as we would start to become restless and annoyed.  

Overall, I give it a thumbs-up!  I look forward to visiting again next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"We flew in & were looking for something little to eat. We found this place & were excited to try it after reading the reviews ESP about the stuffed dates! We sat down & I bet it took a server ten mins to greet us. We were not only ready with our drink order, but our food order. I had their house infused vodka martini & my husband a Moscow mule. Mine was watered down, remade (I mean stirred as the server said) & then it tasted like cough medicine. My husbands mule he said was good. We ordered the stuffed dates, stuffed peppers, flashed fried patron peppers, roasted pork Empanada, & scallops escargot. The stuffed dates were fine, but not amazing along with everything else except the stuffed peppers....they were good! So I would not go back, but at the end of things they did take off my martini even without asking. I like that, that's the way you want a restaurant to do business! Of course we never did figure out who our server was...we saw three & never one consistently."}
{"text":"If you like Spanish cuisine. This is a must try in your list. 
They have tapas which are small plates or shareable appetizer. They have seafood paella. It takes 45 minutes to make because it made to order. So super fresh. 
I haven't been here since they got in trouble back in 2012. They used to have several location. 
I miss going to the one in Fort Apache and Sahara. Wish they would open one in centennial hills we need more options in the hills."}
{"text":"This is a superb Tapas restaurant. I cannot believe my luck as I stumbled on to this restaurant looking for a plug to recharge my phone. I need to play Roulette as quickly as possible.

This is my very first restaurant right from the airport and what a beauty it is. Red, white or sparkling sangria pitchers made from wine, fresh fruit and brandy, marinated for 3 days. $28.

Apple and manchego salad, green apple, manchego cheese, smoked almonds, lightly dressed. $4. this was a superb cold tapas. Then we finished with hot petite 'mini filet mignon' sliders. $10. these were rockin burgers.

If you want to start crying take a peak at the menu. http://www.fireflylv.com/menu.html"}
{"text":"Great sangrias! Great vibe. 

This is a great place to get away from The Strip. It's got a mix of locals and travelers. It's more laid back and not crazy feeling. So I like the vibe. It feels like a not-so-crazy Happy Hour. The lamb chops were good. Paella was average. For a Spanish-style place, I expected better paella. Bacon wrapped dates were great (but isn't bacon wrapped anything)?! I love their sangria."}
{"text":"I came here on my last visit to Vegas with pretty high expectations given the 4.5 star rating, reviews, and photos. I love tapas so I was excited to give this place a try! I will say that half the tapas we ordered were pretty good and the other half just didn't do it for me.

Here is what we ordered:

Chicken Skewers $8.50 - These were served cold and the meat was dry. I did like the garlic cream sauce so that saved this tapa even though I was disappointed with the cold meat.

Shrimp Ceviche $9.50 - The presentation wasn't all that but the taste was fresh, lemony, and delicious. I was surprised since it didn't look like it would have much flavor (see pic)

Tierra y Mar Skewers $11 - Thank you for serving up a nice piece of tender filet mignon as it should be. The shrimp and chorizo added a nice flavor to this skewer along with the salsa verde.

Apple & Manchego salad $6.50 - I love manchego cheese and apples but this salad definitely lacked flavor, nothing too special about. It was missing something but if you like manchego and apples that's exactly what this tapa is about. 

Albondigas $7 - If you like Chef Boyardee then you will like these meatballs because that's exactly what they taste like. I wasn't too fond of the flavor and it was a disappointment.

They do serve complimentary garlic bread with a sweet almond butter. This was definitely addicting stuff! It was sooooo good we ordered another round.

My girlfriend ordered the Sangria and had to send it back because it was overly sweet. Our waiter was very kind about replacing her drink. So just FYI the sangria is pretty sweet!

Overall this place has reasonable prices but the tapas could be hit or miss. I'm glad I could check this place out!"}
{"text":"We went here before a crazy night our for a bachelorette party. We organized our reservation through a VIP party package which included transportation, a show, and club access on the strip -- and dinner and drinks at Firefly! So in short - we got a great value.

I loved almost everything that was served. My favorites being the veggie empanadas, beet salad, and spicy shrimp.

One of our guests cannot have peppers and unfortunately there were peppers in a lot of the foods, but, I suppose this should be expected with Spanish tapas.

The sangrias were delish! Restaurant was VERY crowded and a little loud. Ambiance was trendy and romantic - great date spot."}
{"text":"Very good! Tuna tar tar, shrimp civechi, Lamb chops, and mushrooms! Everything was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Yum! My favorite late night stop. Firefly never fails at making me happy! Food is flavorful, drinks are perfectly balanced and the ambiance of the restaurant is sexy. Happy hour is also great."}
{"text":"We have been wanting to try this place the last couple times we've come out to Vegas..   We had three adult diners. Really wanted to like this place but we all came away thinking it was just OK. Very noisy. Could not really even converse with one another. Our waiter, Ivan, the hostess, the manager and the rest of the staff were great, very professional. The food was not bad, nor was the pitcher of sangria. Its just that nothing was great"}
{"text":"Hmm......

30 minute wait?  Check.

2 hot messes in clothing that was too tight and too young for them?  Double check.

Great food?  Check.

Hot hostess?  Check.

So we got here at around 745pm on a Wednesday, and it was a little crowded, but I think it was worth it.  I grabbed a Jameson rocks and a Vodka cocktail at the bar for me and my buddy and we drank it happily while we waited for our table.  The thing that surprised me was how big and full of liquor my glass was!  I'm used to the glass being smaller and less full, so that was a nice surprise.  I hoped for a table outside since it was a nice warm night, but we got in at one of the lower slung tables near the front.  Comfortable seating at the low table.  A plate of bread and olives appears with waters soon after we got seated, and so did our server who took our order of the following..

A pitcher of white sangria. 

Cold tapas  

Apple and Manchego Salad - Surprisingly filling for a salad, and the cheese and almonds provided for a nutty, almost meaty addition to the salad.

Artichoke Toasts -  I didn't eat any of them, but they were pretty!

Tuna Peppers - Marinated poppadew peppers stuffed with tuna, and seated atop a taro chip, these were perfect morsels of food combining salty sweet and crunchy!

Boquerones - I love anchovies and I like vinegar, so I ate most of these, and am biased to salted fish, but these were awesome and I don't usually like red peppers but they make sense on this dish to contrast the brininess of the anchovies and acidity of the vin.

Hot tapas 

Stuffed Dates - Crispy bacon wrapped around a date stuffed with a smoke almond, in a red wine sauce with blue cheese, these were like the Mediterranean Turducken you've never heard of.

Patatas Bravas - Roasted potatoes with spicy aioli.  Wish we got the sauce on the side, and the potatoes could've been spicier, but overall solid.

Fried Calamari - These were done well, not overcooked, crispy batter that stuck to the rings, and they included the heads!  Yes, I love tentacles, don't you??

 Me, my wife, her sister and boyfriend split the above.  We were absolutely stuffed to the brim, and in a good way.  And, it didn't break the bank, I was expecting the bill to be much higher, but then, we did only have one pitcher and 2 drinks.  But that's because we were saving room for Luv-It.  Oh yeah.....

Go to Firefly!  You go now!"}
{"text":"When everyone tells you about a place you have to go and see/try for yourself, you just have to!  

Firefly was one of those places for me.  Different groups/individuals have told me about Firefly on different locations, and I had to go see what the fuss was about.

I love TAPAS, and Firefly definitely took me to paradise with the stuff I ordered and tried.  I had the sliders, stuffed peppers, and the fries.  I decided to go with the favorites since I was with a big group who were all Firefly veterans.  I definitely loved the selections we all got.  I must try this place again, and hopefully I will have a chance to try some sangria while I'm at it.

Firefly, I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"I've been there so many times, that should say something about how much I like the place =)

Here's a list of things I had and what I think about them:

Stuffed Dates - texture party in my mouth, great flavor, never fail!
Fried Calamari - just like any other good calamari, nothing super special
Manchego Mac n Cheese - creamiest mac n cheese I've ever had, MMMM
Firefly Fish Sticks - more like fried fish fillets, good flavor, but dry sometimes
Roasted Baby Beet Salad - well, its a beet salad, nothing special
Spicy Beef Salad - tasty thai dressing on slices of beef and leafy green, pretty good stuff
Ceviche of Shrimp - too \"soupy\" in my opinion
Terra y Mare Skewers- good flavor, tender beef, goodtimes
Firefly Fries - I can never say no to fries, especially ones top with cheese!
Smoked Samon Platter - good standard
Plate of Serrano Ham n Cheese - its a pretty yummy dish, my friend said it reminded him of Spain
Tuna Tartare - not enough salt
Filet Mignon Slider - standard stuff
Crispy Duck Rolls - too greasy
Lamp Chops - nothing can go wrong with this one
Babyback ribs - nothing can go wrong with this one either, sweet n tender
Pulpo asado - meh...

To wash everything down, Mango Mojito is super yum!
Blueberry Mojito is so so, and I personally didnt care for their sangria, but I probably just don't like sangrias in general."}
{"text":"Overall the tapas plates we tried were okay.  We got a table in less than 15 min on a Friday which was nice, but that was because we were there around 5:30pm.  

We ordered the curry mussels because this was my favorite thing I tried on the east coast and I have been determined to find a suitable replacement on the west coast.  Unfortunately, the flavor of the sauce was a little more coconut, and a lot less curry than what I have been craving.  

The patatas bravas were good, I loved the spicy aioli, but I would have preferred a crispier outer layer on the potatoes.  Some of them had it, but most did not.

My favorite tapas was the tuna peppers, which was surprising because this was not my pick but I am so happy that we ordered it because the dish is delicious, and they have a perfect little kick to them.

And finally, I ordered the tortilla de espanola.  I could eat this all day.  While my husband loved the bell pepper vinaigrette, I was not a fan."}
{"text":"Dimly lit restaurant and lounge. Couches. Candles. Hot hot sex. 

Dopest tapas place in Vegas and a well known local spot. Sangrias and Mojitos, fill em up. Have a yourself a good time. Hanging with friends or your lover, you're sure to have an intimate night.

Skip the strip, come to Firefly. You'll thank me later."}
{"text":"My husband and I visited here last night. The entire experience from beginning to end was perfect. The girls at the front desk were polite and helpful, the waitress, other servers and manager were incredibly attentive. Drinks were lush, especially my cocktail. I cant remember the name of it but it had mezcal and kahlua in it. The food was incredible; tasty combinations and huge portions. We shared 7 plates between us, not anticipating the size but demolished the lot. The stuffed dates and the roasted heirloom carrots are a must. The petite filet and the chicken skewers were also awesome. We cannot wait to go back and try more of the menu."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's great before going out. For the most part the food is appetizer style, so you won't get too full or have left overs. They have a little bit of eveything. There's fish, chicken, steak or vegetarian. And their drinks are yummy, I recomend the Sangria (they have red and white). Everyone should make this stop on their trip to Las Vegas."}
{"text":"loved this restaurant! 

a great getaway from the Vegas eat-til-you're-stuffed buffets and with a relaxed, trendy atmosphere.  the service was super - the waiters were very attentive.

the foods were reasonably priced, and portions were substantial - portions large enough to enjoy the dish, but just enough so you didn't get sick of it, and to leave you room for the next one.

2 of us ordered:
- stuffed dates - i swear bacon makes everything taste delicious!
- steamed mussels
- lamb skewers - delicious!
- filet mignon sliders 
- pitcher of sangria - lots of fruit, very delicious, about 5-6 glasses 

our bill for 2 came out to about $55 - a great price for a satisfying meal!

would definitely like to come back here next time i'm in vegas!"}
{"text":"Some of the best in Town! I could eat the bacon wrapped dates all day! I love the selection at Firefly, but the amount of delicious food makes it difficult to not order the same things every time I go back. The lamb chops were perfect and they had skewers with shrimp/filet that were packed with flavor! I also recommend the tomato soup, which is served with Fireflies take on a grilled cheese sandwich. It brings back childhood memories in a classy way. Firefly is a great place for a date, night out with the girls, or celebration with friends. The atmosphere varies from fun to romantic,and that's what makes it such a classy place to be! I'm a wine drinker, but I will say that their white and red sangrias are both delicious"}
{"text":"Random find for a tapas place, but they have the best steak I have ever had. And for $20 with fries and dipping aioli you can't beat the price. The steak is topped blue cheeses crumbles and it's tender and perfectly seasoned. My boyfriend was not a fan of this place until he tried their sirloin. I have been on a search to find a steak better than theirs' and I haven't found it yet!"}
{"text":"Omg amazing customer service and amazing food!!! Great portions! Everything on the menu was so amazing!!!! Definitely coming back and the music was great amazing ambiance. Definitely a long wait but totally worth it!"}
{"text":"I'm going to write this review from a different perspective this time, and that is from a large group dining situation.  I was in charge of planning a bachelor party dinner for a group of 25, and that proved to be no small task for Las Vegas.  Most of the places I tried wanted any combination of the following: a very strict prix fixe menu, a signed contract, a minimum of $100/person (not including alcohol, tax, and tip) and a 50% deposit up front.

I usually stop by Firefly at least once every Vegas trip so I am well aware of how amazing their food is.  I figured to give them a shot at hosting our group after unsuccessfully booking at Tao, SushiSamba, and a number of other restaurants on the Strip.  Regina was extremely helpful, more so than I could have ever asked for!

Firefly required a prix fixe menu, but they let me select 6 dishes + 1 dessert that would be served.  The choices I had were of a large variety so we had everything for literally every taste in the group.  The best part was that the food was all you can eat, so the restaurant brought out one complete round of the 6 dishes, and if anyone wanted any more of any dish, the kitchen would cook it right up and send it out.  Unlimited food and \"basic\" beverage (i.e. coffee, tea, soda) came out to be $32.50/person before tax and tip.  This was by far the best dinner value I found for a large group!  The next closest value I could find was $75/person at Tao.

During the planning phase I must have emailed the restaurant a dozen times and every single time, Regina was very prompt with her response.  This was a great relief because I was so used to not getting a response from some of the restaurants on the Strip.  I don't quite understand why some of those other places would make it so hard for me to book a group reservation, but I am glad Firefly came in and saved the day.  They required a credit card number to hold the reservation, but nothing was charged until the day of the event.  This was very nice because I didn't want to have to front the entire bill for the group before the trip.

This was my first large group planning, and I don't envy those of you charged with the same task.  Let me tell you, do yourself a favor and give Firefly a shot.  You can read virtually any of the other reviews to know about their food and atmosphere, but if you need reassurance that they can admirably handle your large group, I hope I have provided that.  Kudos to you, Firefly!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing and the music was great. I would recommend this place to who ever loves a friendly and happy atmosphere."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the Firefly on Paradise and I have a review of them up already. I was crazy excited that there was one now close to my house because this town spoils me to the point where I dread having to drive more than 10 minutes to have to do anything. So how does it stack up??

Initially, I was expecting the ambiance to not even come close to the Paradise location, and unfortunately I was right. It's not even close. But they do get props for a fireplace. Even though it was off to the side nowhere in sight while we were eating. It looks like a typical restaurant that you would find in this neighborhood. This strikes me more of a Firefly that people might bring their kids to, which I definitely wouldn't say about the Paradise spot. This may be due to the fact that I was there around lunch time. For some reason, the average decor takes a bit of the magic out of it all. I guess should I one day have kids, it will be nice to have both options.

The hostess was very friendly. The waiter on the other hand, was one of the crappiest waiters I have had. The guy reminded me of Andy Samberg, minus the personality. That part I don't really care about. I mean, you should be friendly in the service industry; but if you are a great waiter who is attentive, I can easily look past the lack of friendliness. This guy however never really checked on anything, filled drinks or saw if we needed anything at all.  It's like he disappeared and went to the gas station to play the machines and pick up a pack of smokes or something, while the busboy took care of everything. The busboy by the way was also pretty nice. It also came to the point where we had to ask the hostess to tell our waiter we were ready for our check. That's  just plain sad. Now I should note this was during lunch time. It's possible the other waiters during lunch and the nighttime staff are better, but that has yet to be seen.

The food was pleasantly similar to the paradise location. Not quite up to par but close enough I think. I definitely prefer the herb roasted chicken at the other location. And the menu appeared to be identical. 

I will say this, the Mojitos were a bit better here. I like that they don't crush up the mint where you wind up sucking mint particles up through the straw like the other one. Maybe it can be argued it's supposed to be like that, but in my crazy mind, this was the better version. I'm not usually much of a Mojito drinker but I'm always tempted to order them at Firefly. It kinda reminds me of Family Guy where Brian drinks a Mojito while he's on the dating show. \"I don't think it's a gay drink. Mo-jiiiiito.\" Lol. My normal drink is a Jack and Coke, so it's one of the few times I actually branch out. 

So there's my overall assessment of Firefly on West Sahara. I will probably be back. Plus, if the service was an isolated incident, I'll probably be a regular."}
{"text":"This is definitely in my top 5 restaurants in Las Vegas. Firefly is a great restaurant for when your in the mood for something different from the norm. There's is a wait once in a while but nothing outrageous from my experience. The outdoor dining is my favorite any time of year, they have warmers in the winter time to make it just the right temperature. For the record I actually enjoy it a little cold so take that into consideration. When you sit outside you kinda feel like you aren't even in Vegas. With a delicious Mojito in your hands and the green grass and trees along the side of the dining area blocking off the road, it's a good little escape. The inside dining area is nice as well but I just prefer the outdoors. One side of the indoor dining looks like a comfy lounge with couches and tables and the other side is like a slightly crowded restaurant with a bar on one side. 

       Now to the more important part. The food! It's awesome! I have to order the herb roasted chicken every time. It's a half a chicken bursting with flavor. It's delicious and tender, falling off the bone. It also comes with their absolutely incredible firefly fries. They are great. They have a nice flavor and a little bit of shredded, melty cheese here and there. I recommend it highly. I also suggest the short ribs which are also incredibly tender and delicious. The machengo mac n cheese is worth checking out. I get it every once in a while. It's hot and cheesy. A little too rich to eat for one person. But to share it's good, and sharings kinda the point at a tapas joint. My Ex-girlfriend who, I exposed this place to, loved the chicken salad as well. That's the dish she has to order each time. 

     The prices aren't outrageous especially for the food quality and ambiance. 
  
  Overall, Firefly is a great date place, friend hang out, and business lunch spot all at the same time. And though the tapas can easily add up, especially with a number of mojitos thrown in, it's not too outrageous or out of line. You definitely need to check it out at least once. Plus it's close enough to the strip if you're just here on vacation. Don't let the summerlin location put you off to this one. This one is far better!"}
{"text":"WOW, I really needed this meal.  After driving 9 hours or so from the bay area overnight and being stuck in the terrible traffic of las vegas blvd, I was starving.  The empanadas and tuna tartare were amazing!  

Everything else I had here was more normal and what you would expect at most tapas places, but I was just dying for the food and rest, so they get a higher rating.

Definitely a place to check out if you want tapas around the strip."}
{"text":"I was feeling blue and a good friend took me to the one on Paradise. I fell in love, love, love with the place! The sangria was sweet nectar from the Wino Gods!  I normally don't like dates but OMG!.. the BACON WRAPPED STUFFED DATES! That is a FOODGASMIC EXPERIENCE! So, I was giddy with excited to learn they opened another location just 2 blocks from my house. Sometimes when there are multiple locations, things get lost in translation but not with Firefly. They are on point with every detail right down to the atmosphere. Every time friends or family come to visit I make them come with me and I get them addicted just like I am. I instruct them they all have to have their own order of DATES and then we get several items to share ranging from the Ham and Cheese Croquettas that just melt in your mouth, or the Artichoke Toast, or the Lamb Skewers that are tender and juicy every time! There isn't a bad item on the menu.  For those of us who are allergic to seafood, they take great care not to mix the dishes. I wanted the Paella and they combined they added the other meats to it so there would be no chance of cross contamination. Wonderful service always. Never have to wait for a refill on any beverage. If you haven't tried Firefly, what are you waiting for? An engraved invitation?"}
{"text":"My favorite Vegas brunch joint!! Everything is soooo good! The paella is to die for!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic! Went for lunch, can't wait to go back for dinner. Service, atmosphere, and of course the food were all top notch."}
{"text":"Honestly amazing. Awesome sangria. Reasonably priced. Great atmosphere. Bacon wrapped dates!! One of my favorite  restaurants in Vegas for sure!"}
{"text":"Tasty, but nothing really wowed me.  I would go again, but I wouldn't go out of my way.  The one thing I really liked was the complementary bread, hah.

One plus is the pitchers of sangria/mojitos.  Everyone in my party seemed to enjoy them immensely."}
{"text":"I've had Firefly bookmarked for some time now and I was finally able to check it out this past weekend for my Birthday.

I made a reservation for 8 people and when we got there, we were seated right away. Although, I would have preferred to be seated in the main dinning room, we were sat in the room adjacent to the bar. Our server greeted us right away and offered up his suggestions on drinks. We opted for the pitcher of Watermelon Mojitos. It was so refreshing and tasted great!

We knew that we wanted to try the Mixed Paella so we put in an order right away since it takes about 40 min to make. 

Here's a breakdown of what our table ordered:

Mixed Paella

Chorizo Plate

Serrano Ham & Manchego Cheese

Stuffed Dates

Camarones a la Diabla

Chicken & Chorizo Stuffed Mushrooms

Babyback Ribs 

Chicken Tinga Empanandas

Stuffed Peppers

Tierra y Mar Skewers

Everything tasted amazing but my top 3 favorite dishes of the night hands down had to be the Stuffed Dates, Mixed Paella & Camarones a la Diabla! The stuffed dates were so good, we ended up ordering 2 more orders of them! We just couldn't get enough of their goodness! 

Only complaint of the night was that the room we were seated in was extremely hot. It started to get uncomfortable in there. 

All in all, I would highly recommend dining at Firefly next time you are in the Las Vegas area. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Fresh, great tasting food and amazing service. Speciality cocktail was great as well. Could not be more impressed. Food came out fast and did not taste like it was sitting there... Very fresh"}
{"text":"I've come here a few times, and each time, the service is great.  Presuming you have done tapas before, you order a small amount, and you continue ordering small amounts until everyone is tapped...so the wait staff is usually hovering around, checking on you and asking if you want/need anything.

Atmosphere is cool...very trendy/date night appropriate, but still very casual.

On to the food...

I have tried a little bit of everything here.  Dishes go from relatively inexpensive to about $10...but a lot of the good ones are $10 and you will have to order a few, so it does add up fast.

Can't go wrong with the fries...large basket, big enough to share and sit on the table to snack on between plates.  We also like the chorizo clams and lobster here....lots of flavor.  The ceviche is also top notch, one of the best I have had, and the tuna tartare is very good.

I really like the stuffed dates...these are an interesting taste, so you might not, but I would still recommend trying them.  Mac and cheese is also very good, as is the fish and chips, calamari and crab corn dogs.  We also like the sliders and skewers.

Best part about the experience, is trying a bunch of everything.  If you come here expecting to get full off 2-3 dishes, it is not going to happen.  You will have to try a bunch of little things, but it is almost like a small tasting menu, that you get control!

Have fun"}
{"text":"Met some friends here for a birthday party...she loves it here...I came for the company.

First of all, parking is retarded here.  If you don't care about people parking your car, DO THE FREE VALET.  I drove my boat back there trying to find a parking space, and I couldn't find ONE space I felt comfortable leaving my car.  I ended up parking in the hotel parking lot next door and walked over after leaving the frustration known as Firefly's parking lot.

I wanted the Firefly fries that I've grown to enjoy...They come with Parmesan, Herbs, and an Aioli for $6.  Since I knew I was gonna order another plate or two in addition to the fries, I decided just to spend the money for the steak and fries :P

14oz Ribeye ($20): Red Wine Sauce, Cabrales Bleu Cheese, Firefly Fries and Aioli. Surprisingly large ribeye for the money! It was a good steak, cooked perfectly, but the sauce/seasoning was a little distracting. Still good though!

However, the fries were undercooked and stupid oily.  Like \"dripping off your fingers\" OILY.  I should have returned them, but my steak was cooked perfectly, and I thought it was a waste to turn over the plate.  They probably would have just brought me a new side of fries, but that's in hindsight. 

So you can still get a decent value at Firefly...just factor in bad parking and a hint of inconsistency and you'll probably be fine!

{"text":"Great menu, especially the vegan / vegetarian one! Great service, tasty food."}
{"text":"Great menu! Lots of vegetarian options.  My husband had scallop \"escargot\" which he said was delish- and it sure did smell it.  He lived his tuna kabobs too.  They had a lot going on that looked really good.  I had veggie empanada.  Amazing!  And I was pretty full after that! But I still had veggie \"crab cakes\" and OMG I need to learn how to make them! So good! We had a blueberry mule and amaze balls!!"}
{"text":"My (now) husband and I had our reception dinner at Firefly and I cannot say enough great things about it.

We planned our entire wedding from across the country, so we put our trust in the 5-star yelp reviews Firefly already had. We were a little nervous booking a dinner for over 30 guests having never tried the food, but in this case, the reviews were absolutely right.

HUGE shout out to Fernanda! She totally put us at ease, helped us make our reservation, choose our menu, answer any questions, and everything in between. She was super helpful, got back to us quickly, and adjusted the contract to our needs. We wound up having a few more guests than we originally anticipated, and they were more than accommodating. 

When we arrived for dinner, they had a private room set up for us. Fernanda was actually there with Regina and Neo; they all took really amazing care of us the entire night. Every single tapa was top notch and the drinks were amazing (sangria and mojitos were especially fantastic). People are still raving about how great the food was, even the few picky eaters we had with us. My sister, who doesn't eat seafood, actually came up and went \"OMG did you try the shrimp?!\". That says a lot! Firefly also allowed us to bring in our own cake (they recommended an amazing bakery, Freed's), set up a table for it, and brought it to the back to cut and serve all the guests. Everyone's drinks were full all night and we all left extremely satisfied.

I want to come back to Vegas just to come back to Firefly! It was the best meal we had our entire trip and the staff is amazing."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service!

Visited this place based on the reviews on Yelp and I wasn't disappointed. The service was quick and the food was great."}
{"text":"We were coming out for a late dinner tonight and knew the restaurant would be closing at 2pm. As a courtesy to the restaurant, we called an hour ahead and told them we'd be arriving at 1:30, and asked if they would mind seating us and taking an immediate order. They said it was fine. So we drive across the city, excited to eat at one of our favorite restaurants, only to find out that they would not seat us once we arrived (30 minutes before closing time). We informed the hostess that we called and she said it was her that we talked to, to confirm the reservation. She then went on to to explain that they decided to close early because they changed their mind. They did not bother to call us back. They were unapologetic, and could care less that two loyal customers had just driven across the city to eat there. It felt like they just spit in our face. I'm familiar with the restaurant business so I know it's not just the hostesses fault, but management is to blame. I'm disgusted that any restaurant would do that to someone. SHAME ON YOU FIREFLY. I'll be leaving this review on every outpost and review site that i can find. Hope it was worth it."}
{"text":"Amazing ... A culinary orgy for the palette ... The tag team style service keeps the food coming including killer Garlic bread almond butter and homemade green olives ... We ordered bacon wrapped dates with an almond inside (awesome), fish sticks (mediocre) ... The mushroom tort, stuffed peppers, chicken and pork empanadas were epic ... I LOVE this place ... A must return for me ..."}
{"text":"GREAT Spanish joint in Vegas!!! Authentic Spaniard food and LOVE the ambience. Make sure to order the sangria pitcher and the Spanish sausage. ALWAYS busy during dinner time. GREAT crowd and chic too!!"}
{"text":"As I sit here in the cold of another Chicago spring I have to find a happy place in my mind.  To do this I close my eyes and think back to one week ago today and the warmth of the Las Vegas sun on the Firefly patio.  I can not say enough about this restaurant.  We enjoyed it so much that after going for dinner on Thursday night we went back for lunch on Friday.  We are now on a quest to find something on the menu that we do not like.  I have a feeling that will not be easy.  Stuffed dates awesome....fries awesome....firefly fish sticks awesome.  In two visits in two days we had 10 different tapas....2 different sangria's and a mojito and the fruit infused vodka which I thought was awesome.  Please do not be afraid of the off strip location it is an easy cab ride to some of the best food in Vegas hands down."}
{"text":"Firefly is definitely a spot I must go back to each time I take a visit to Vegas.    Their menu consists of savory small dishes called tapas and everything on there just sounded great. They serve complimentary bread. This is always a plus. I tried the Firefly fries (so addicting), thai beef salad, mushroom tart, calamari, filet mignon sliders, paella, and tempura shrimp and veggies. I shared this with five other people, and I was completely satisfied. Oh, and don't even think about leaving this place without having their dessert, specifically their tres leches cake! Absolutely amazing! I'm not a huge fan of cake, but this...this hits the spot! Overall, Firely is a nice place to dine at, especially with a date. I'm knocking off a star just because of how dim it is in there. My eye sight sort of sucks, so I had to place my cell light over the menu to read the menu. Haha"}
{"text":"The chef is amazing, the tapas and drinks are wonderful! Specifically the mango mojito, cucumber martini, chicken empanada, apple and manchego salad, garden variety salad, lambchops, andtomato soup. The dessert platter was great as well!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has some extremely good tapas.  It is a smaller restaurant and can get quite crowded, but it is worth it.  The food and drinks are so delicious.  I don't think I've tried anything that I didn't like.  The staff is very friendly and attentive.  Nice environment."}
{"text":"If you're on The Strip being a tourist, do yourself a favor and splurge on a cab over to Firefly for dinner. You'll come out ahead money-wise and have a much better meal than you can find on Las Vegas Boulevard.
 
It's a lively little tapas restaurant, dark and packed on a Saturday night, far too cool for its strip mall location. But then again, it's Vegas, and nearly everything's in a strip mall.
 
We got a table for two after about a 20-minute wait and the service was great and glitchless from start to finish.
 
Every last thing we ordered was interesting and amazing. Not a plate was left with a crumb. We had: a warm spinach salad with grilled peppers; a beet salad with goat cheese and candied pecans; fried red potatoes with homemade aioli; grilled diablo shrimp with a spicy, sweet sauce and garlic bread; calamari; and bacon-wrapped almond-stuffed dates."}
{"text":"I went with a party of 8 during their happy hour last Friday night. (Monday-Friday from 3PM-6PM). We had an excellent server named Pepe, who I will likely request again in the future. He always had a smile on his face and was very attentive given the size of our group and that it was a busy Friday night. I have a shrimp allergy and when I was disappointed that I couldn't try the tierra del mar skewers, Pepe offered to make one of the three skewers all beef so that way I could have some. It came out on a completely separate dish which makes my allergies happy. This was also great for my boyfriend since he loves shrimp but usually doesn't get to order it due to my allergy. We also ordered their truffle fries and albondigas (a staple every time we visit) as they never disappoint! We then tried the ham and cheese croquetas which were great but were just very small - 3 pieces each about 2 inches in size. I probably will not get those again. Lastly, we enjoyed 4 pitchers of the red sangria, half priced during happy hour. The sangria is, and has been, the reason I keep going back and back!"}
{"text":"Ok, We Love it!

A friend of a friend suggested that we meet them at Firefly on Paradise...at first were very hesitant. So we yelped it, gave it a try and we loved it so much we went back the next night! The food is absolutely delicious, the service is the same and the Sangria is to die for. 

We had both the veggie and pork empenadas which were arguably the best I've ever had. The ceviche was amazing, the bacon wrapped dates were also amazing. The filet/shrimp skewers were also good, and the Filet Migon sliders were BOMB!

We ordered the Red Sangria which we loved! We didn't get a chance to try the others, but we will next time we plan our trip to vegas."}
{"text":"I've always loved firefly. It's more of a bar so it's not super relaxing but the food is good and it's a lot of fun with a small group of friends! My favorite thing there is the tres leches so-far it's the best one I've found in town. The tuna tartar is good, the lamb, the tomato basil soup, and the stuffed dates! 
Try it all it's pretty cheap! My friends all like the sangria here I don't like red wine so I wouldn't know but this is a fun place to try at least once!!"}
{"text":"Thank you God for letting us arrive at Firefly Tapas Kitchen and Bar.  I couldn't be more than thankful to leave the bar we were just at.  It's definitely a nice change of pace.  As soon as my friends and I arrived, I gave my boss's name and they advised us it could be about thirty minutes wait.  That was fine by me since I was still a little bit tipsy from the drinks I had at the other bar.

I decided to use the ladies room to freshen up, and they really keep that up.  It was one of the cleanest restrooms I've seen in a while.  It might just be because I was a little buzzed and when I'm in that state, I am normally biased in a positive way.  As soon as I got out, not more than five minutes after we got seated.  The hostess was super sweet enough to seat us outside where it was away from all the noise of the inside.  Seemed like people there can't hear each other well since they seem to yell at one another while in conversation.

I've been to the Firefly on Paradise Road and found that really great.  It's one of my most favorite restaurants to take my friends to when they're in town or if there's an occasion to celebrate.  I'm really glad they made one on the west side of town and a good one at that.  

As soon as we were seated, we were served with bread and butter and olives.  Mmmmm... olives.  I love olives and these olives were so yummy too.  The bread wasn't old and had the right texture, and combined with the butter was just oober delish.  It was time to order and considering I wasn't in the right mind to order, my boss ordered for me.  :D  I'm not very picky so anything would do.  I love to try different kinds of food.  I guess that's a great thing about me.  My tummy is easy to please.  

My friends ordered as follows: (Oh and I remember because it's food.  When it comes to food, I have a sharp memory.  Don't ask.)

Firefly*fries  [parmesan, herbs, aioli]
I close my eyes and remember these are the best fries I've ever had.  I keep forgetting to take a mental note of what they put in this so I can make it myself at home.  Luckily, I can just remember this review and make my own.  :)  The combination of the cheese, herbs, and aioli definitely work well together.

Empanada  [pastry stuffed w/roast pork, red pepper, w/salad, aioli]
This was delicious.  However, I think that Filipinos make the best empanada's.  This has a whirlwind of flavors.  I'm still impressed.

Lamb chops [2 chops, red wine reduction, sautéed lentils & julienne vegetables.
I love lamb when it's prepared correctly and they did a fine job getting all the flavors together.  I didn't taste any of that weird lamb after taste.  Thank goodness because I would've spat it out on the floor, or to not be overly dramatic, just close my eyes swallow it and drink the whole jug of mojitos on the table.

Plate of Serrano ham, Manchego cheese  [grilled bread & garnishes]
I loved this one too.  It definitely goes well with a tipsy body.  I think this is what helped me sober up a little.  Or it could be the combination of all the food on the table.

Albondigas  [meatballs in sherry tomato sauce, parmesan]
I will definitely order this one again.  I love meatballs and the cook was definitely happy that night when they prepared it.  The flavors definitely played with  my tastebuds and was happy with it.

Pomegranate Flavored Mojitos
I normally only like the regular way mojito is made, but the flavors of this was pretty decent.  No complaints to how this was made.  I was thinking keep them coming.  But I know I would've had to be carried out of the restaurant if I didn't stop drinking it.

I can't forget about our awesome waiter who was very attentive and on top of his game.  What ever my boss wanted, he was there to give it.  Could it be because he was under my boss's charmed spell.  She can be very bewitching and full of charm.  Or, it could just be because he's just that way with all his customers.  Great job Mr. Waiter!

My overall experience in Firefly was awesome!  My expectations of Firefly has always been high and they've always come through.  I hope everyone else has the same experience as I did.  I will go back again soon."}
{"text":"For my Th30th birthday, I celebrated it at Firefly on Paradise Rd.  How should I start?  I found out about this place through my cousin who spent his birthday here last year.  I was very attracted to the laid back and casual setting of the place.  It looks like a bar on the outside so you wouldn't know if it was a place that you can sit down and have a meal in.  

When entering the restaurant, on the right there are hostesses to greet you and ask for the reservation name.  When a table was ready for my party of 9, we are led through a crowded looking room and retro design artwork on the wall.  It was a little difficult to maneuver your body through the tight squeeze between each chair and table.  Finally managing not to knock anyone food or glasses, I finally sat down and  was able to relax.

Being my favorite drink there was the Mojito, they were happy to serve it to me a few minutes after ordering it.  We dug straight in to the tapa's menu.  I had a craving for Tomato soup with mini grilled brie sandwich.  Nothing worth saying about that.  It's just your regular grilled cheese dipped in tomato based soup.  We also ordered the Firefly Fries mixed with Parmesan, herbs and aioli.  I liked these fries.  It wasn't too cruncy and not soggy.  My favorite dish in the whole restaurant is the Paella.  It's a dish containing saffron rice, clams, shrimp, calamari, chicken, Spanish chorizo sausage.  All mixed together made my mouth feel like it was partying.  I know a little over dramatic.  But, it's the only way I can describe how good it tasted.

The service was okay.  I think our server was getting mad at us because our party was always unsure of what to order.  I really didn't care since it was a day of celebration.  He had to constantly come back to check if we were ready.  We all ordered at our own pace.  

I would go back just for an evening out to drink and get drunk.  It's a fun atmosphere and always seem joyous.  I've never seen any fights there or any drama going on.  They're definitely headed in the right direction.

Update:  10/20/2007
My bestfriend, Alisa, decided to have her 3rd 30th birthday here.  Reservation was for 7pm so we didn' t have to wait for a seat.  Good thing coz I wasn't about to wait in the cold outside with the wind blowing all over the place.  

After being seated, a sangria was waiting for me to be sipped and eventually gulped, and a menu to stare at until I was ready to order.  

What's good here?
*  Firefly*fries [parmesan, herbs, aioli] 
*  Shrimp tempura  [beer-battered, ponzu dipping sauce]
*  Paella [saffron rice, clams, shrimp, calamari, chicken, Spanish chorizo sausage] 
*  SANGRIA* [marinated 3 days for maximum enjoyment]
*   MOJITOS* [lime, fresh mint, rum cocktail] 
*  Terra y Mare skewers  [grilled shrimp, filet mignon, chorizo sausage, salsa verde]
*  Smoked salmon toasts  [brioche toast, sour cream, pickled ginger, capers] 
*  Warm spinach salad  [artichoke, red pepper, pine nuts, feta] 
Service this time was great and I can't complain with her efficiency.

What I thought was mediocre.
*  Tomato soup  [mini grilled brie sandwich] 
*  Crispy duck rolls [cherry hoisin sauce]
*  Babyback ribs [steamed, mango BBQ sauce]
*  Filet mignon sliders  [mini burgers with Serrano ham, cabrales cheese, caramelized onions] 

I still would go back over and over again for the atmosphere.  I always have fun here."}
{"text":"Came here for a CES networking event and was blown away with the food! We had stuffed dates, garlic chicken skewers, ham and cheese croquettes, and paella. They also passed artichoke crostini and tomato chutney toast. It was all amazing! My favorite was the dates stuffed with an almond, rolled in bacon and cooked with a red wine reduction, melted in my mouth with a little crunch from the almond. I would recommend this place to anyone. Exceptional for sharing as the plates are all served tapas style."}
{"text":"The Best bartenders in las vegas and great service aways ..red Sangria always a great start to drink .. Ask for karen as your fav bartender"}
{"text":"Excellent small plates. We had baked cod, lamb chops, vegetable empanadas and tomato soup. Everything was great. Great service at 1:15am too. Lots of music outside with dancing. Fun place!"}
{"text":"Whenever I'm in Vegas, this restaurant will definitely be on my itinerary. Don't miss the empanadas. None better anywhere I've been! Their paella was fresh, authentically seasoned and reasonably priced. If the ladies' room had been in better condition, I'd have rated this restaurant a 5."}
{"text":"Mmm first night in Vegas my cousin took me here. We got a lot of plates which are small, so it's easy to share and get a lot ! We got goat cheese which was  hot n delicious !  Scallops in garlic sauce, pork empanadas, ceviche and the apple salad are all a must !!! The cocktails are pretty good ! I forgot the name of the drink but one had a shot of Jalapeño juice !! Mmmm!!"}
{"text":"This is a MUST try restaurant when visiting Las Vegas! They have a live salsa band and a dance floor of to the side of the restaurant. The restaurants looks and feels sexy inside with the decor.

They had a long list of tapas categorized by proteins an also had paella's to share. My friend and I started our food adventure with the tomato soup and mini grilled brie sandwich ($7.5). the brie threw us off because were expecting the traditional grilled cheese flavor, yet it was good. The ahi tuna skewers ($10)were also a big hit with us; mango, basil, ginger-soy glaze, house pickles, and salsa verde is what this dish was mixed with. At this point with the, skewers, the soup and the complimentary bread they gave us we were getting a bit full, so we decided to share the delicious ribeye. A 14oz. ribeye with Firefly fries, aioli, red wine sauce and cabrales bleu cheese cooked medium rare ($29) was just the right thing to have. The meat and the pitcher of red wine sangria ($31) were complimenting each other perfectly.

If your into salsa dancing and great food, this is the spot to go. A lot of attractive people were around and both the restaurant and dance area are open late and is not too far off the strip."}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant with a large group.  We ordered the sangria and a bunch of tapas to share. The sangria was actually sweeter than I usually like it. The vegetarian paella was to die for!!!!!! The spice was one of the best I have recently tasted. 
The patty as bravas were spicier than I have had, or am used to and were not my favorite. The stuffed mushrooms and empanadas were good also!  Tortilla espanola was an average tortilla. 
Overall the restaurant had a really fun environment and was super crowded. I can see why so many people like this restaurant and continue to come visit!"}
{"text":"SO GOOD!

I've been here several times but my last visit was the best experience ever! We came here after our show and before we hit the club.. Tapas here is outstanding.. decent priced, and lots of varieties to choose from. Sangria is on the sweeter, fruiter side but still yummy, Mojito is so good!!

Our server was so attentive, it's like he can read our minds and know exactly what we need and want! They changed our plates like 3 times throughout the meal and cleared all the empty dishes right away.. i mean.. RIGHT AWAY! I was still contemplating on licking the plate since it was soo good I watched the busboy walked away with the plate with teary eyes.. 

you must, must, MUST try the Ahi tuna skewer. It was the best thing ever! It was lightly seared on the outside, with mango, a cilantro cream sauce ( i think), balsamic reduction, and sun dried tomato, and some other things..  sounds really complex right? But it was SOOO good. We stuffed ourselves with 2 additional orders of Ahi. It was that good! Everything else on the menu was all yummy..

For 10 of us, shish load of food and drinking like hippos.. it was only $25 bucks a person.. GOOD TIMES!!!"}
{"text":"Came here with the family for New Years dinner in Las Vegas.
Food was delicious and plentiful! Something for everyone. Been to the one in Sherman Oaks, CA and both are awesome spots for dinner or just drinks. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Favorite restaurant in Vegas. I come here every time I'm in Las Vegas. They have something for everybody. Mojitos are excellent. Toast with garlic butter is delicious. The shrimp ceviche is my most favorite dish. I love their atmosphere, there service, and their food. Everything about Firefly's is AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Had a great time here, the food is awesome we had the apple salad, the dates, and the paella. We drank red sangria. The mood is very red and romantic but seems like a fun place for all kinds of \"night out\" type events, a good mix of local and tourists"}
{"text":"Got here for the first time with my girlfriend. 
The best thing I can say about the place is the service. 
If you come here for a date I suggest don't. It is very loud. 
We ordered the fried calamari tapas and the eggplant rolls with goat cheese. 
I think the calamari was too salty and on the other hand the eggplants roll were too bland. 
We also ordered the seafood ipella. 
That was ok it had the flavor. 
I suggest to come here with friends and have fun not a one on one on Friday nights.
With friends you can make as much noise as you want and drink. 
Like a local bar almost.  
I give it a 3 out of 5 because of the service. I think it was great they were always on top of everything."}
{"text":"I'm really excited to have this place close to my home, I just hope they keep everything in order so they don't close it. Great place to hang out!"}
{"text":"This place is just amazing!! Our server Roger was just fantastic! The service from all the staff was great! I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Made reservations on some day, no problem. Environment is nice. It's dark but they had lights wear it need to be so we can see our food. Everyine was welcoming. Hottest were very kind, our waiter was very nice and on point. He new when to check up on us. 

My boyfriend and I ordered: 
lamb chop, baby back ribs with mango salsa on top, scallop escargot in Garlic, fried calamari, shrimp ceviche and passion fruit cheese cake. The only dish that was okay was the shrimp ceviche. Not enough flavor. But everything else was GREAT! I would recommend this place to all my friends. And would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Firefly was really happening! It's casual, but still has a lot to offer in terms of ambiance.  We had the gaspacho, artichoke toasts, fried calamari, and chicken and chorizo stuffed mushrooms.  All were excellent except for the mushrooms which were a little dry.  To top it off they make a good mojito.  Good food and a great price!!!"}
{"text":"It's hard not to love this place, the food, atmosphere and service is all very good.

Thanks to yelp reviews and some TV time, I found out about this gem and learned it's a locals favorite.

Took a 2.6mile walk from the Circus Circus (Thank goodness you can drink on the street), a little long but good exercise.  Got to this place, pretty typical strip mall but could tell this place was popular.

Walked in to the lounge area, awesome atmosphere and was seated right away on one of their low couches.  Scanned the menu, ordered some drinks and some food.

Bacon Wrapped Dates - Perfect!
Chicken and Chorizo Stuffed Mushrooms - Decent
Chorizo Clams - Amazing

Absolutely great experience, 3 dishes and 3 drinks for the two of us and we got out of there for around $50, wish we had time to go back, this is definitely somewhere you don't want to miss on a visit to Vegas, it's worth going out of your way for.

Also because this place is so popular, there are always a taxi or two waiting outside, very convenient."}
{"text":"Cool, hip place off the strip. Read all the great yelp reviews and decided to give it a shot while visiting my parents. They are pretty straightforward eaters so they were pretty critical. I thought some of the dishes were very good and some were not executed too well. The best was the tuna tartare and the signature dates wrapped in bacon.
The beet salad hardly had any beets. Mainly lettuce. The empanadas were mostly pastry, and the fillings (had a vegetable and meat) needed more seasoning.  The filet sliders could have better better if the steak was not cooked wekk done. Meat was tender, just way overcooked.
We had 4-5 other plates. Just nothing to make to come back when I am in town with all the other great dining choices.
On a plus note, prices were very reasonable and service was quick and friendly. Just don't get all the raves about the food."}
{"text":"Just went for our 5th meal here! Still loving it!
We ordered 11 dishes, 2 beers & 6 cocktails for four people. We were all stuffed and happy. The. I'll was $175 before tip.

Try the New Girl cocktail!!!

Blood orange mojito, amazing 
Fly-tai, mmmmmm
Bread and butter, loved it
Calamari, crispy and delicious
Fish sticks, a touch over done but tasty
Tomato bread, interesting... A bit soggy
Papas, OMG soooo good! And spicy!
Tortillas a la espanola, a bland waste of money

Overall, we REALLY enjoyed our meal here. The atmosphere is very pleasant (although the tables for two are far too close together. I did not enjoy listening to every word of the other people's conversations) the service was fantastic until we asked for our check so we could get to our show and the waitresses disappeared for a while. I will definitely be coming back soon to try some more dishes!!!"}
{"text":"Really good small plates with Latin flavor. Clams, chorizo, dates, fish, mushrooms, chicken and so much more! Each one delicious. Go with a group and order two per person. Fun and tasty. The price is very reasonable too!"}
{"text":"Happy Hour:
3-6 Mon - Thurs
3-5 Fridays
Free appetizers at the Bar
Half priced drinks.

I've yet to make it here for happy hour yet, but half off sangria should be reason enough to go.  I've eaten here tons of times, so I know the food is going to be great.  I'm curious though about what free appetizers come in the bar.

Get the stuffed dates!"}
{"text":"After our wedding at the Flamingo, we came here for our reception. The food is spectacular as well as the service. 

Fernanda and Regina took such great care of us before and during the reception, making sure everyone was taken care of.  Paul and Neo, our servers and bar tenders of the night, also deserve high praise for their efficiency and attentiveness.  

We began outside on the patio for light tapas.  Albondigas, the stuffed dates and artichoke toast kicked off the night.  Multiple trays of each were passed around to the guests, enough where I could have filled up on those had I not known what else was to come.  Although I loved all three of these starters, the albondigas were my favorite.  They were tender and juicy and full of flavor due to the Parmesan and sherry sauce.  The guests raved about the stuffed dates which had a perfect balance of sweet with the red wine reduction sauce and savory with the blue cheese.  The smoked almonds added not only another element of surprise to the mixture of flavors, but a nice juxtaposition of texture to the dates.  My mom and aunt's favorites were the artichoke toast- a perfect amount of salty crunchiness from the bread with a generous piece of warm artichoke on top,  Honestly, as I am writing this review recalling the food, maybe all three were my favorite!

To accompany the starters and the meal, we had an open bar. Being on the patio we had a separate opening to the inside bar that only our guests could order from.  No waiting at all.  I enjoyed the sangria, pretty much all night.  Both the red and the champagne sangrias were filled with fresh fruit and both had  unique flavors.  The champagne sangria was a little sweeter, perfect for dessert, while the red accompanied most of my food.  Regina brought out pitchers for all the guests to enjoy on top of whatever else they wanted to drink. Fernanda, Regina, Paul and Neo did not skip one beat!

Now on to the meal...We were moved to a private room inside.  The only downfall was that there was only a black velvet curtain separating us from another party and at times they got a little loud ( as did we I am sure).  But other than that, Firefly set up a private drink station for us to continue to order drinks from.

We began the meal with Toasted Bread, Almond Butter, and Marinated Olives.  That almond butter was so sweet; being married to the saltiness of the olives made this, again, another tantalizing combination.  Next was the paella. I have never had paella before, but now I am a paella believer!  It was filled with seafood and pork - just a whole lot of stuff! Many guests filled their plates with whichever meats they liked best. We also enjoyed the ribeye and the herb roasted chicken.  The ribeye was nicely cooked, especially in the inside if you like your meat more medium.  It was more cooked on the outside.  The sauce was reminiscent of the red wine reduction form the stuffed dates.  The herb roasted chicken was tender and we were served both white and dark meat.  As a side, we had the firefly fries, and damn that aioli was addictive.  A few guests admitted to eating multiple plate fulls of the fries the next day.

To end our evening of food, we got to savor the Chocolate \"Tres Leches\" Cake.  Moist and delightful, it was a perfect end to the perfect meal.  We also ordered a wedding cake from Freeds which was delivered to Firefly.  It was one of the most flavorful and delicious cakes I have every had - I recommend the almond flavored cake. 

The night was coming to a close, and we all had such an amazing time.  We were supposed to be out by 8, but our speeches went a little longer and people lingered a little longer.  The staff did not rush us out nor did we feel pressured to get out.  This wedding experience was pretty close to perfect, a word I don't use too lightly but used repeatedly in this review.

The only thing I wish is that there was a Firefly in the CLE.

Much thanks to Firefly: Fenanda, Regina, Paul and Neo!"}
{"text":"Firefly is a tapas restaurant in Las Vegas with a grande reputation. It was actually the very first \"local must visit\" restaurant recommendation that I received on my very first relocation scouting trip to Las Vegas, but I clearly did not take the recommendation as I just made it there a couple of weeks ago. Now, I have been twice.

People love their tapas, but for me, tapas is a bit like a buffet: I never know when I have had enough to eat. I rely on entrée size to guide my appetite, and at both tapas and buffet, there is no \"entrée\" size. Small plates really only serve one purpose for me: socializing!

So, the stars are based largely on the socializing quotient for Firefly, which I obviously think is high. The place is quite a scene with something for everyone. A patio for your outdoorsy people, a comfortable dining area for you cozy types and a bar for you stool pigeons. The atmosphere is festive and warm. Everyone just seems to be friends united in a common love of mojitos and the world bossa soundtrack. The bartenders are particularly sharp and personable. 

Happy hour starts early  at 3pm (only at the Paradise location, downtown it is 5pm), so bonus stars! Half priced drinks is the happy treat. My girl pal's Malibu and Pineapple was $3!

I think the food is good, not great, but a welcoming atmosphere makes my taste buds a bit friendlier. Everything comes out SUPER HOT, and I really appreciate that as nothing is worse than a cold something or other wrapped in bacon. The chicken salad has sliced grapes and nuts. The bacon wrapped dates are a winning combination of salty and sweet, but my personal favorite dish is the lentils with veggies. Good source of protein for all of my vegetarian friends!

Overall, Firefly deserves its reputation. Perhaps it is not the most brilliant tapas place in the WORLD, but here in Las Vegas it provides a starworthy combination of atmosphere, (small) food and booze!"}
{"text":"Who has a problem with neon? Seriously, I need to have a talk with you. Neon is like light from heaven to me. Thus, dome-dining at Firefly downtown is the equivalent to a front row seat to the pearly gates. Maybe I am taking the religious metaphor too far, but I do enjoy an interesting view, and Fremont St is definitely an interesting view for a variety of reasons. If you are not familiar with the variety of reasons, then you need to visit Fremont St more often. 

I think they did a decent job with the interior here, although, the bar is tricky. The edge closest to you slopes downward, so if you try to move your drink closer to your mouth without picking it up, you will probably end up with a lap full of alcohol. Beware of this, as the bartenders might not warn you. They have an incentive for you to lose your drink to gravity. My gal pal crafted a rather ingenious solution: she joined two straws together to create a super long straw thereby allowing her to sip her sangria without having to move the glass closer to her. She is such a smart lady. 

Happy hour is half-priced drinks.  No food specials, and the happy hour is not as long here as it is on Paradise. It is only from 5-7pm Monday thru Thursday, but they have happy hour on the weekends! Friday thru Saturday it is 4:30-6:30, and then on Sunday 5-7pm. Life is all about trade-offs. 

I am a fan of Firefly's tapas, as it is reasonably priced, presented well, tastes good and is always served hot. The drinks are refreshing. My last trip I had the sparkling sangria, and it is a nice companion to a warm Las Vegas day. 

As I have said before, for me, tapas is all about socializing, and the downtown Firefly provides a stellar combination of atmosphere, food, and drinks, with the rather glorious bonus of a classic Las Vegas view--intoxicatingly social for sure."}
{"text":"What a great little restaurant.  It was so worth going off strip to eat here.  Our group of 8 visited last Saturday night and the wait was only about 25 minutes at 9 at night.  The menu is pretty extensive and the drinks did not disappoint.  The favorite drinks at the table were the infused vodka, which hubby enjoyed 3 of, raspberry mojito, which I thoroughly enjoyed, and the sangria, which was a crowd pleaser.

Highlights: bacon wrapped dates, tuna tartare, petite filet, empanada, ceviche, spicy shrimp, lemon tarts and chocolate tres leches cake

Lowlights: lobster escargot (too mushy), sorbet (flavors were not very good)

We also tried the chorizo stuffed clams, ribs, potatoes, tilapia filets and a few other things that I can't remember.  These were just OK and not that memorable.

Service wasn't very attentive ... it took longer than it should have to clear plates and bring drinks, but that was pretty minor compared to the food.

This place is great for groups and the prices are amazing compared to the other places we ate in Vegas.  Total bill was approximately $300, which is pretty damn good.  Definitely a must try place if you want to get off the Strip."}
{"text":"Great restaurant simple small tapas. They have so many great selections from bacon wrapped dateds to chicken chorizo stuffed mushrooms. Amazing  this is a great little date spot. So dress up take your little lady, or guy out and enjoy some set time!!!! Oh ya and try the bacon wrapped dates, these are what dreams are made of lol."}
{"text":"A friend of mine recommended this place and I was really happy we went. It was nice to be off the craziness of the Strip in a more relaxed atmosphere. My friends and I went at 5pm on a Monday so it wasn't crowded. We were seated right away. We ordered the sangria (red, they also have white and sparkling) which was excellent. 

We ordered 4 different tapas - eggplant cannelloni, tortilla, stuffed mushrooms and fried potatoes. The eggplant cannelloni was my favorite, with crispy slices wrapped around goat cheese. The tortilla was not exactly like I'd had it in Spain - it came layered on toothpicks - but it was decent as were the potatoes. I didn't try the mushrooms because they had chorizo, but my friends said they were good. 

The service was very attentive, refilling our water every five minutes and answering questions about the menu items. Our entire bill came to $26. I will definitely come back next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with my family & got seated right away. The food is good, were familiar with the menu. Service definitely needs improvement. The server didnt even greet us he just came over and asked if were ready? I thought that was kind of rude considering the restaurant didnt look very busy. I ordered the ceviche (as its my top fave) and it came out way after our 2 order of tapas. I didnt like that they drop off plates at the table and leave right away. I needed condiments and Im in the service industry myself, I feel like they could at least ask if we need anything else. After asking 2 people that werent my server about the ceviche, they finally brought it out. We didnt see our server much until we would look around. I know I'll be back because this is one of my favorite local restaurants. I just wish they improved their service."}
{"text":"Maybe this isn't my thing... but its not a meal. A lot of little expensive food and really sweet wine.

The wine was REALLY sugary with almost too much sweetness. The appetizers were pretty good but not filling at all.

After an hour of eating tid-bits and drinking sugar-wine we ended up going to the Ft.Apache Fatburger for dinner."}
{"text":"We called and made reservations for dinner on a Saturday night around 6:00. I recommend making reservation because everyone is catching on how to how great this restaurant is and the I heard the wait got up to 45 minutes. 

Everything tastes great. My favorite was the Tierra y Mar. It is one of the most expensive tapas at $10, but it tastes great. It includes a few skewers with steak, chicken, sausage and shrimp. The best part was actually the green chile sauce on top. If I knew how good it was going to be, I would have asked for a side of it. 

After eating a few tapas and a basket of Firefly fries, it was time for dessert. We split the flan and chocolate tres leches cake. I have to say I have never seen chocolate tres leches cake, but what more could you ask for? It was really moist like all tres leches should be, but had a great chocolate taste. I hope I can find someone to make this in Houston. 

I was also a huge fan of their beer list which included Delirium Tremmens.  It has become more popular over the years, but it is still hard to find."}
{"text":"We loved everything about Firefly. Stuffed dated and chocolate tres leche cake our favorites."}
{"text":"Def a place to go in Vegas!
My boyfriend and I were trying to find a place in Vegas to go that was different, not over priced, and delish. We didn't want to do the traditional steak houses because honestly you can get a good steak from a good steakhouse anywhere. My boyfriend has never had Tapas before so I suggested we look up restaurants with Tapas. Firefly had good reviews so we made reservations for 6pm. When we got there it wasn't very busy yet. 

Ambiance:
The lighting is dim which is nice because it makes you feel like your the only ones in the restaurant. We were seated in a corner booth and it just made everything perfect. There is a lot of red to the color scheme and it kind of had a tacky-manly-romantic vibe to it but it fit its romantic fun feeling.

Service:
We had the best service. Our waiter was attentive, knowledgeable and all around an all star. I have worked in the restaurant industry for a good 5 years and i appreciate when someone is as good as he was. Not only was our server great.. the food runner was good, and the busser or server assistant was amazing. He did not let a empty plate sit on a table for anyone.. I saw him sneakingly cleaning up without interrupting people in the dinner conversations.

Food:
It depends what you get. All of the food we had was good. But some were just good and some were AMAZING. The portion sizes are definitely bigger than a normal tapas place which is nice and well worth the money. Some suggestions for food are.. Dates, Filet, Lamb. Those were our favorites.. we wanted to try much more but we got full fast. Not only is the food good.. omg the sangria was heavenly.. we got the pitcher and it was gone at the end of dinner.

Price:
The price is very reasonable and I'm so glad we went there. We got a pitcher of sangria and 6  tapas.. our bill was $95. We got to try all different kinds of food and get 6 glasses of sangria out of the pitcher. It is very reasonable.

The next time we are in Vegas we will be coming here!"}
{"text":"Amazing!!
Tierra y Mar was Bomb!!

Stuffed dates are a must!!

Lamb Chops are a slice of heaven!

Red Sangria tasted like it was made with sprite. No bueno.

Desserts are not worth writing about. 

Service was OK. Though they offered us a free dessert, i think it is important to be notified in advance if there are long wait times. I like being checked up on and my server really checked in. 

I gave this 4 stars for the amazing food and unbeatable prices!!"}
{"text":"Oh, when I go to Vegas, I try to make a trip out to Firefly. I love the cool laid back ambiance. After spending a night or two on the strip, it's refreshing to go to a restaurant without having to groan awkwardly from seeing girls wearing t-shirts as dresses, caked on makeup, or tops so low you wonder why they bothered to wear one after all. 

The food is delicious! I cannot remember all the names but I just remember that whatever dish they brought out, we savored every single bite (and drop) of it. The best dish? Their paella.....sigh.....makes my heart flutter just thinking about it! =)"}
{"text":"specially loved the Scallop escargot style YUM ask for more bread for the yummy garlic butter, also faves were warm spinach salad and the steak and shrimp skewers Patatas bravas not so much, the potatoes were not hot enough and the aioli had separated. Great mojito"}
{"text":"Went to this Tapas Restaurant on Sunday night and was pleasantly surprised. The food was on point, everything tasted amazing and the staff was incredibly nice. Definitely would recommend this to anyone in Vegas."}
{"text":"I always come here with a group of my friends because we are big fans of their sangria! This place accommodates big groups with convenient varieties of tapas available. From my past visits I have never ordered an actual entree because I'd usually get full off of their tapa's menu but my friend ordered a steak entree, which was pretty big and presented nicely. The food is okay but in my opinion it is on the pricey side for certain items you get. The environment is a bit dim inside setting a relaxed ambiance. The first time I came to their restaurant it was hard for me to see others in my group on the other end of the table because it was so dark. However, the other times I came after, the lighting was better. Customer service has been okay, they are nice and try to get our orders in as quick as possible. The wait is pretty long but Firefly is always busy so it is expected from this type of business. I have been a consistent customer for the past 4 years since they moved locations and each visit they get better and better."}
{"text":"The food was amazing! Outstanding! Simply delicious the shrimp ceviche was just out of this world good."}
{"text":"Have always enjoyed the food here, and this time was better than I remember!  I love that it's tapas/small plates, all reasonably priced, so I can try several things without being overly stuffed.  Great place to go with a couple friends so you can all share and just try everything!"}
{"text":"It was a very unique dining experience, being new to the tapas concept.  The food is very good, just not as good as they believe it is.  The Sangria was crisp, fruity and tasty.  The tapas platters were all each very good."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places. The stuffed dates are amazing, as is almost everything I've had here. Loved the lamb skewers as well. And the Sangria!!!! Great service to boot!"}
{"text":"For all the fanfare, the location was a little hard for me. Using a map app on my phone, I thought it was a short hop-skip-and-a-jump from UNLV. Boy, was I wrong--those are some huge blocks--and it was cold, windy and rainy. By the time I saw Firefly, it was like a safe haven after trekking in the wilderness of Vegas streets or something. I entered into the dark, reddish lights, seeing mostly couples and small groups of friends, so I sat alone in my corner, ready to feast!

Also, when you sit, they bring you a plate of olives, bread, and garlic butter, which is a plus.

Red Sangria- 3 1/2-stars- Obviously, I made sure I arrived for Happy Hour. At first sip, the flavor was strong, but not potency in the alcoholic sense. Just the pure strength of red wine was awakening. Digging around in my glass with fruits, I did nibble out pieces of apply.

Sparkling Sangria- 5-stars- If it's your first time, I'd surely suggest this first. It's definitely sweeter and lighter in flavor. I nibbled out some blueberry and apple pieces. As this was the second glass, I'm unsure if the effervescence made the alcohol hit faster or harder, but I felt a little happy after this glass.

Stuffed Dates- 4 1/2-stars- You receive four dates per plate. The dates are bacon-wrapped, with smoked almonds, a red wine reduction sauce, and crumbled bits of bleu cheese. The bacon explodes with juiciness. Just underneath, the dates crunch lightly with their sweet and creamy texture. I'll admit the dish turned out a bit too oily for me--whenever I can feel a thick oiliness on my lips, I get uncomfortable. The bleu cheese adds a depth of sharp and earthy surprise, which is a good things, because it keeps your senses alive. Definitely a good choice of date or bacon, or just plain flavor lovers.  

Lamb Skewers- 4-stars- You receive two skewers per plate. All I can say is that the aroma hits you immediately, which is a potent mix of all the ingredients. Definitely an interesting surprise. Your plate includes leg of lamb, mushrooms, red bell peppers, red wine sauce and lentils. The red peppers add a level of fresh, sweet flavor between each piece of lamb, well marinated with the red wine. Each skewer has about 3-4 huge chunks of juicy, cooked lamb--some pieces very tender, other very chewy. The overall flavor is earthy and delicious, I am definitely a fan of lamb. The bed of lentils is very interesting, as it seems to have captured the drippings and all the flavors and juices. Even if you don't want to eat it, you should taste a spoonful.

Atmosphere-- There are more secluded side areas, and then a larger space with windows letting white daylight in. I say this, because the rest of the establishment had a muted red tone to it. There is a beautifully arranged bar in the corner, next to their kitchens. The decor is nice, relaxing, yet artistic, with even a fish tank above the entry way. The music is a little loud, so people are also talking louder to compensate. There is also a television next to the bar for people who have no one to talk to.

Service- Although I was greeted by one person and taken to a table, I found myself helped by a half-dozen different people. One person I ordered a sangria from, another person I ordered my meal, and someone else came to deliver my different plates. At least I didn't need to worry about who to ask for help--anyone passing by was fine, because they all asked how I was doing. At least your glass will never be empty here.

Conclusion- As a visitor, the location made it almost too 'locals-only', especially since the bus back to the strip was in a deserted business area. I'd definitely eat and run before the sun sets early. The look and feel of the place is great. There are dozens of tapas to pick from, it's just too bad I had eaten a few hours beforehand, and had to meet a friend on the Strip for dinner. The food is also awesome. Definitely worth a trip if you're in the area or have a car, I wouldn't bus it."}
{"text":"Never again will I step foot into this place! I have never been treated so horribly as I did last night while dining at this restaurant. With the temperature here in Vegas being 30 degrees, they decided to sit my family and I on the \"patio\" with space heaters. When asked if we could have a different table that is in a warmer place we were taken to a table that was NEXT to a space heater. In top of that, the waitress acted like it was a bother and didn't even offer us a table inside or give us the option to wait for one. After sitting outside I ordered a coffee to try to keep me warm and never even received it! Later after calling the manager named James I was told that when it gets busy the indoor tables are reserved for people who spend a lot of money there! How dare them assume what we were going to spend there! I intend to draw a lot of attention to this matter contacting news stations and seeking out higher levels of management!"}
{"text":"Love the food, like the drinks, hate the service is what this comes down to. After eating here dozens of times, I have yet to have any positive service experiences.. ever. While their drinks are pretty tasty, all their mojitos are made with juice concentrates rather than real fruit or real fruit juice. They are a little sugary sweet and artificial tasting for my palette, but to each his own ! The bacon wrapped dates are freaking incredible (they have the best ones in town!), and I also love their mac and cheese. Sliders are hit or miss. Skewers are just ok. I attached a pic of the white drink mixes they buy to put in all the drinks. I watched the bar for 30 minutes last night and didn't see one drink made without some concentrate out of a white canister."}
{"text":"Great place to go with a group-
A group of friends and I went to Firefly on Jan 15 2011 - It was a little wait but we went to the bar... The bartender was really cute and made a great white sangria... 
We had great service - 
We ordered:

A pitcher of Mojitos and a pitcher of White Sangria - excellent

 Chicken skewers
[marinated chicken, tomato, mushroom, roast garlic cream]
So good 

Stuffed dates
[bacon-wrapped, smoked almond, red wine reduction, blue cheese] when I had this at the location on Paradise wasn't that great, but at this location was the best 

Veggie empanada
[spinach, mushroom, artichoke, herbed cream cheese in pastry, red pepper aioli] - crispy little pies that taste so good

Firefly*fries
[parmesan, herbs, aioli] - really good

Mushroom tart
[puff pastry, boursin cheese] - you have to try this

Manchego mac 'n' cheese
[baked w/baby shells] - taste like mac n cheese but kicked up a little notch

Ham and cheese croquetas
[Serrano ham, Manchego cheese] - it was gone before it hit the table

 Lamb skewers
[marinated leg of lamb, tomato, red wine sauce] - if you like lamb this is the dish for you

Steak and mushroom skewers
[grilled filet, roast garlic cream, red wine reduction] - don't eat red meat but was told that this was so good

Fried calamari
[spicy gribiche dipping sauce]


Great experiences - Perfect for groups - great music too..."}
{"text":"Always pleased. I always try to get new things but it's hard because there are so many favs! Absolute orders are tuna tartar, Mac and cheese, croquettes, and dates for dessert. Sangria is good but def weak. My bf gets a flavored monitor but asks them to muddle peppers inside so it's spicy! That's a better choice!"}
{"text":"Like this place a lot. When visiting try to keep it simple. Bacon wrapped dates, albondigas, patatas bravas , etc. 
get a pitcher of sangria and enjoy your evening!! They moved down the street from their old location so now there is more room and you don't have to wait for an hour to get a table. Still it's busy, so plan to show up lil early."}
{"text":"Been here twice, once a year for annual company dinner. We got package that they prepared.. food is absolutely yummy. The place is packed, I think maybe planning ahead to this place is a better bet. They have bar as well. I completely forgot to take the pictures of the food coz I was so so hungry, but nevertheless this place is worth to try."}
{"text":"I really love Firefly for birthday or special events. The atmosphere is very loud and exciting. Great for large groups ordering tapas or meals for sharing. Or sit at the bar and have a few drinks with a date before heading out for the night. Saturday nights is Latin night in their private room inside the restaurant, I've never been but I've heard great things about it. They change their menu periodically including ingredients on options that have been around for awhile. I absolutely love! Their Red Sangria, at $9 a glass your better off buying a pitcher for $30 and sharing. Be careful they are strong (to my liking). 

The food, tapas style, is very good! They have a ton of seafood options and of course you must have the Firefly fries, they are very garlic-y so bring some gum. I recently tried their Ahi Tuna skewers, they were decent and not too filling which was perfect to start the night with."}
{"text":"I liked everything that we tried. We had the lamb skewer, Croquetas, empanada, crispy duck roll, fried calamari, dates wrapped in bacon.
The place was nice too, service was good."}
{"text":"Was there for an early evening snack and drink, the four of us split some appetizers and a couple pitchers of red sangria. We sat o. The bar and the bartenders even though busy where very attentitive and pleasant. The food was good and tastey though i felt the portions couldve been bigger. The drinks were yummy, sangria was sweet. They have latin night on friday nights if thats your thing."}
{"text":"Oh hell yes. Tapas! 

Tuna tartar, sangria, creative dishes that will give you a taste for real culinary experiences. 

Broaden your horizons and go here, try 10 things and enjoy the fun atmosphere. Thank me after you've had a great meal.

{"text":"I LOVE Firefly* it is by far my favorite restaurant. I love the Mojitos, Sangria and all of the Tapas!!!! The food is excellent! One reason it became my favorite spot, beside their food, is due to their servers and their awesome personalities. Once I met Mandi, I started to frequent the restaurant on a weekly basis. She always remembered what my friends and I liked to order; She was fast, vibrant, full of energy and made us feel special. I was DEVASTATED when I went there last time and asked to be seated in her section, only to find out she was let go due to a bad Yelp review. =( Not only was Mandi my favorite server, but most of my friends would specifically ask to be seated her section as well. I can't say that I won't ever go back to Firefly*, because that would be a lie, but I know I haven't been going as often, since I found out this sad news."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants ANYWHERE. I was in town for work for one night and brought my coworkers here. Rave reviews from all. My favorites are the Tuna tartare, camarones a la Diablo, petite filet and stuffed dates. Try the paella as well, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"I went on a Friday between lunch and the happy hour crowd (guessing). The restaurant was 60% full and the bar area was relatively empty. But, I thought a pretty good showing given it was 2:30 pm. I had never been to this location (except to buy gift certificates) but have been to Paradise a couple of times, but it's been a few years.

Service was really good. My waitress was attentive but, agree with other yelper, the bus guys bust their butts and there was always one around to order more food (yes, surprised they did this, needed more water, or plates cleared).

Food was great too - I am not a drinker but everyone else had a drink - I do not eat meat for the most part and everything I ordered was delicious. In order of tastiness:

1) Thinly sliced roasted eggplant stuffed with cheese (goat, I think), with a little tomato sauce
2) Veggie empanadas - first time I have seen empanadas served without meat - YUM, you won't even miss it - seasoned empanada eaters
2) A tie with above, the salad of apples, manchego cheese and bits of smoked almonds
3) the potato espanola thing, a potato casserole, this may have been better but, it was the last thing to come out and the other dishes were so flavorful. I couldnt tell if this really fell short of the others or if it was timing.

I had the berry lemon tarts for dessert - presentation was pretty and they totally hit the spot for the sweet little something.  I ordered this from the bus guy, and had asked him the flan or the lemon tarts - he hesitated giving me his recommendation but, said for him, the tarts. Good recommendation! 

Tapas generally are pricey given the quantity but, I thought my experience at this location was better than what I remember of the Paradise location."}
{"text":"This is one place that has become a staple in my Las Vegas path of culinary travel.
A large and creating array of small plate items, covering the gamut, from comfort foods, to meat/fish, hot/cold, lite/heavy, etc...There is something for everyone here.
I am partial to the albongigas (meatballs), but the tuna tartare is great, as are the bacon wrapped dates, shrimp diablo, ceviche....I could go on, but try it for yourself.
Casual, eclectic atmosphere makes it comfortable for anybody. I've been here for business meetings, been here dressed up for pre and post nite-out bites, and been here in sweatpants. Never any judgement.
Full bar, and prices are reasonable too. I've been to 3 of their locations, but the one on Paradise is my favorite. 
Just a comfortable spot to enjoy good food."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat... food is great!! But the service was not so great.  We arrived on a monday night around 10:20pm the place was empty.  At this time we were the only ones who sat inside the restaurant.  Our server was Jesus (tall, skinny gentleman)  He greeted us with a smile, but throughout our visit.  We felt rushed when it came to ordering as if he didn't have time to be waiting on us.  I felt there were other workers in the restaurant that took care of us more than the server.  When it came time to pay the bill, we paid in cash and Jesus said he would be back with the change.  We waited, but all we saw was Jesus walking past us from the kitchen to the bar to his outside tables; He did not bother to look at us or come back to the table.  We flagged him down once we saw that he was not going to come back, only then did he say \"Did you want your change?\" without us having to say anything.  I will say we did not leave a good tip due to our experience.  We thought if was very rude of him to expect he deserved that tip.. We are very generous tippers but we tip based on the overall experience.  Because of that his tip went down further but it was never because of the fact that we are cheap.  We understand that people work for their tips and that is part of their income; but I also believe in excellent customer service wherever I go.  Because I love the food, i would order to go instead of dining in"}
{"text":"Walked in on a Monday night and was treated like a rockstar. The bartenders are so friendly, helped me make drink and food choices that were perfect and they make incredible drinks by hand there. The pricing is average, but worth it, cause the food tastes good and the sangria tasted better. Would definitely recommend this spot."}
{"text":"Oh yelp, you are my favorite travel buddy!  You help me out so much and you help me impress my friends.  

We got into Vegas late, and I knew this place served small plates and sangria late into the evening (2 am), which was just what we needed!  We hopped in a cab and were taken not far off the strip for some delicious food to share.  FYI:  from NYNY the cab ride was just under $15.  

This place is lit in a gorgeous red hue and it's very romantic!  Their menu has many tapas options.  Here's what we chose:
-Beef and mushrooms skewers:  delicious and cooked well with a combination of yummy sauces drizzled over it.
-Veggie empanadas:  empanadas are my tapas staple.  These hit the spot!
-Stuffed red peppers:  great taste and texture!
-Pitcher of sangria:  bold flavors...they let the mixture sit for 3 days!
-Stuffed dates:  our friends ordered these and enjoyed them too.

4 tapas plates and a pitcher of sangria totaled:  $55, which is pretty decent for Vegas prices!

When in Vegas again, we will be back!  There's so much more to try."}
{"text":"Went here for a bachelorette dinner and was not disappointed. All the food was delicious, drinks were good. Sangria was a bit sweet for my taste but we had a complimentary pineapple shot at the end that was delicious. I will definitely be back next time I am in Vegas"}
{"text":"The Bottom Line: One of our favorite places to eat in Vegas, proof positive that there are hidden gems away from the Strip.

Try:
Tomato Bread
Tomato Basil Soup
Seasonal Vegetables
Veggies and Lentils
Patatas Bravas
Firefly Fries
Baked Goat Cheese
Flourless Chocolate Cake
Red Sangria
Mojito

Pro:
Excellent date night restaurant. The lightning was just right, the service was fast, friendly, and knew when to check in or stay away. The small plates make conversation easy, though you may end up talking about the food a fair bit. Everything seemed to be designed to complement each other. 

Con:
Ordering tapas can strain the budget, but... this is worth it. Treat yourself and someone else. :)"}
{"text":"This review is directed at Brooke C's rude and ridiculous review.. First off I've been coming to this firefly location for quite a while now and I have never received anything but excellent service even during the busiest times.. And as for the bartenders I've found them all to be nothing but professional and service has always been quick and courteous.. Never have I heard the bartenders be rude or inappropriate but this is a bar and sometimes the talk at the bar isn't what everyone likes to hear and if u can't handle that then don't sit at the bar.. Go patiently wait on the numerous chairs and stools around the restaurant..The food has always been very good and there are few things on the menu i havent't tried.. The wait staff have always gotten to our table very quickly and our food orders have never taken an overly long time to get there even on the most busy of nites.. I find this review by Brooke C to be very personal and attacking and think it is way outta line and uncalled for.. It sounds to me like u were having a bad nite before u ever walked in here and pretty much parlayed your shitty mood into the rest of ur evening and took it out on everyone who served u and it seems a little biased and unfair.. My opinion is u should give this place another try or just keep ur bitterness to yourselves and stay home and be miserable there., but either way your review of this location of Firefly is way off base and inaccurate and everyone who reads it should take it with a grain of salt and anyone who wants to try this place should just come in and give it a try for themselves...!!!!I"}
{"text":"I was in Vegas with some girlfriends for a bachelorette party and we were staying at the hotel right next door.  We ate here 2 times in 3 days if that says something about how much we loved this place.  It's a tapas place with a nice variety of dishes.  We ordered the stuffed mushrooms, the bacon wrapped dates, the mussels, some Asian shrimp dish, the apple and manchego salad, and coffee.  All the food was really great and the coffee was much needed after a long night of partying.  

We came back again with some other friends and had an issue with their steak.  It tasted really weird and the servers were so great and accommodating.  They offered to make the dish again or replace it with any other dish free of charge.  When we didn't want anything, the chef came out to apologize and sent over a free dessert platter! AND they sent us the steak anyway, which I brought home to my husband (and he said it was delicious).  

LOVED the food and the super nice service.  I don't think I've had such great service anywhere (except, of course, for those fancy pants places where it costs $150 a person).  

Highlights were the bacon wrapped dates and apple and manchego salad.  I am definitely coming back every time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"This is truely a fantastic place.  The tapas are outstanding, the wine reasonbly priced.  What has always amazed me is the variety of tapas they offer.  I am always thankful when I am staying up the street at a convention center hotel so that I can walk a few blocks to hit up this gem.  Unfortunately, it seems to ALWAYS be crowded - but that is justifiable if you read the ratings.  Even though I am staying further out this next trip I am going to gladly make the drive to get dinner there.  Almost always room for a single traveler at the bar.

This is one of the best */$ values in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I was extremely disappointed with everything I ordered. I measure a restaurant food quality starting with the bread. Butter was frozen. Bread hard, dry. Cerviche was marginal. I ordered chorizo, shrimp, steak skewers. Flavor was marginal and chorizo was hard to chew, shrimp was chewy. The only thing I would say is that I ate late at night and perhaps the kitchen was getting ready to close. I will not come back. The bartender server was really good however."}
{"text":"FAVORITE RESTAURANT ! This place is a local gem it is the best food and drinks and atmosphere. UNLV even voted it best bar. 

Their sangria is delicious all three flavors so are their mojitos I love the paradise mojito is my favorite it is a pineapple coconut mojito its so tasty. 

The food is phenomenal and delicious I love love love the stuffed dates you can't eat just one order the baby beet salad is great their fries are great so is their steamed mussels and their tres leche cake for dessert is great so is their flan ! Everything I have ever eaten here has been delicious. 

It is also wonderful for happy hour 3 - 6 half off everything and it is always busy it is a good spot for singles to mingle and also a great romantic spot for couples! 

Great atmosphere very spanish sometimes they have a live spanish guitar player and he is wonderful."}
{"text":"Went here on our visit to Vegas with another couple. The food was absolutely fantastic!!! Everything we ordered was great, even got the dessert platter. We ordered four tapas and the seafood paella and dessert with two drinks, bill for the four of us was just under $100. The atmosphere was beautiful with velvet walls, rich colors and original eclectic array of art. The food was fresh and we would have loved to come on Friday instead as I heard they have live music and dancing. Either way this place is a definite must when we are in Vegas again. Missing one star because our waiter/male was inattentive and unwelcoming, he was like, \"what do you want to eat\" and did not engage when asked questions about the menu, only really seen him during check time. Oh well, I will still come back as this was one of my better dining experience with food and value."}
{"text":"I dont know what it is about this place, but every time i come its like a hit and a miss! My friends and i ate here for New Years and ordered several dishes, like the ahi tuna, the stuffed mushrooms, idk what else but alot of food, most of what they brought was cold! Being that they were very busy, i let it slide, i hate sending food back considering how long it took to get there, and we were starving! The Sangria was good at least!"}
{"text":"Went here during a girlfriend's bachelorette dinner. It came recommended to us from some other friends as a perfect spot for a larger party such as ours, 15 loud girls. The location is definitely NOT strip, the clientele will also let you know you are not on the strip. Once we got over this though and sat down at our table we soon forgot where we were and focused on the expansive small plates menu they had. To be honest, it was a bit overwhelming but our server was happy to walk us through popular items and recommended some great items.

The list has something for everyone and prices that will save lots of cash for drinks, club entrances and whatever else you might spend your money on in vegas. 

The décor was lacking a bit in my opinion, and at the time we were there the bathroom was under construction so we had to share time with the guys bathroom (ladies in, guys out, ladies in, etc. . .) it was interesting for sure.

Overall, knowing how good the food is I would go back. It worked out for our large group as well, but if you are looking for a true vegas feel then this isn't going to be your spot."}
{"text":"i had:

tomato bread, sliders, fries, babyback ribs, and ham&cheese croquette!

they were amazing! gave me instant coma though,
fast and attentive service too!"}
{"text":"Having been to their former location just a block or two down the road, this new location is much much nicer and slightly more upscale. The space is huge. On a Friday night this place gets very crowded. Nice ambience but can be very loud so forget about talking to the other person sitting across the table from you. 

The food quality is about the same as the old location. I asked for a red sangria, mushroom tart and firefly fries. Honestly, I remembered the red sangria to be a lot better from the old location. Delicious fries. I wasn't too crazy about the sautéed  mushroom on top of popovers."}
{"text":"Went last night with some coworkers.  It was my 3rd time to Firefly in about 1.5 years.  The food has always been really good but last night the food wasn't that good.  It didn't taste fresh and was frankly pretty ho hum.  I hope they get their groove back."}
{"text":"This place was packed Saturday night. We waited 45 mins even with a reservation. We got two pitchers of sangria as compensation but I really just wanted to sit down. My husband enjoyed the food, for me it was just ok. The service was good once we sat and ordered some food. The ac was a bit too cold as well. My husband wanted to come back and I didn't. I guess I was put off by all the waiting to be seated."}
{"text":"Cute but flavorful tapas plates. Great service for low price (relatively speaking)!"}
{"text":"This place rocks!  Great hot fresh food every time which comes out relatively quick.  My 2nd time at the restaurant and 1st time at the location.

Always an excellent choice to visit."}
{"text":"Filet Mignon sliders and ceviche is to die for. We also love the fries with crumbles of cheese on them.  Always packed but for good reason.  Sangria pitchers make for a great meal."}
{"text":"Highly reccomended. Great ambiance, excellent food, great service. This place rocks ! My 14 year old son enjoyed our dinner here immensely. The prices are very reasonable as well."}
{"text":"My meal at Firefly was the best in Vegas by far. I went with a couple girlfriends and from what I remember, we ordered:
- Firefly*fries (fairly good)
- Terra y Mare skewers (good)
- Filet mignon sliders (delicious!)

THE BEST dish was:
- Camarones al ajillo (shrimp in lemon-garlic butter sauce)

The sangria comes in red, white, and sparkling wine - I've tried all three before and sparkling is my favorite. 

The shrimp (as mentioned above) was so delicious it really blew us all away. I love the atmosphere of the restaurant and the wait was not long for us (5 mins) for a Saturday night in September."}
{"text":"Before I had ever moved to Vegas I saw a food network special on firefly and I always said I'd visit Vegas for THIS local spot. The next year when I moved to Vegaa I rushed down to Firefly and it has NEVER disappointed. It is one of my top favorite local hotspots. If you love tapas this will soon become one of your favorites as well!"}
{"text":"Wanting to catch a bit after a long day of traveling and not much was open. Their late hours led me me. From the decor to the food, to the ambiance, to the service, it was all absolutely amazing. This is a MUST everytime I'm in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"I have to jump on the 5 star bandwagon here.  This was a great place with outstanding Tapas and we experienced very good service.  we loved the bacon wrapped figs and the hot and spicy shrimp were very very good.

I don't put out the 5 stars too often, but this earned this big time.  And the service is was very good.  We sat down with a reservation for 2 at 8pm on a Wed, the place was packed.  At first nobody came and I thought that some of the comments about the service (negative) were going to come true. But our waiter came pretty quickly and ended up being a super great guy. Even showed us the recipe for a few of the dishes.  

Off the strip and worth the trip."}
{"text":"So, Firefly is becoming a weekend tradition with my crew.  And even more exciting....John (the restaurants owner/chef) has opened a sequel next door called Dragonfly...we'll talk about that later.

Tapas is a treat, literally.  And the best way to pigout with friends for less money that you would expect. It's like ordering a table full of appetizers.   Hmmm....like TGI Friday's, but good.

Firefly friend pleaser's.......Jug O' Red Sangria
                                               Baked Brie and/or Cheese & Meat Plate
                                               Empanadas

Yummy and way fun to share.  An awesome bar.  Thankfully a bar that knows how to make a kick ass martini.  Cuz when the Sangria is gone you might as well kick it up a notch. BAM!!!

And it sports a pleasing trendy atmosphere at Happy Hour.  Believe me....wall to wall SHINY HAPPY PEOPLE.   Men who use product, and the women who love them.  Wink, wink."}
{"text":"This place lives up to all the hype. Came here with help from yelpers. On a Tuesday night around 7:30 the place had a decent crowd. Restaurant was full. We could've opted for a table pretty quickly but decided that the bar was where we wanted to be. 

Bartenders were pumping out some massive carafes of mojitos and sangrias. We both decided on sangrias (amazzzing)... Not overly sweet. Everything on the menu looks great. Unfortunately we tapped out after 6 dishes. Top pick by far was the bacon wrapped dates but you can't go wrong with anything here. 

Ambience is perfect. Great for small or large groups. But if you're coming with a big party be prepared to wait. Service could've been a little more personal but it wasn't bad. That would've made it 5 star otherwise. Thanks yelp for the help,"}
{"text":"Second time at Firefly (weird thing was we got the same table)....great crowd, awesome food, great drinks...what more could you want?

Definitely going back when I get back to Vegas."}
{"text":"Ah, time to review some of my Vegas favs. If you're in Vegas on a budget (I know right... Vegas, budget what am I talking about) this place is probably the best bang for your buck you will find. I'm pretty much just throwing my review into the never ending bowl of 5 star reviews but whatever this place deserves all the praise it has on here.

I found this place on yelp and I've been to both locations. A couple of the dishes have just been good but nothing has really disappointed me and then there are a couple dishes that are just crazy good. The best part is when you look at your check which ends up being the price of a couple drinks at any strip bar or restaurant. This is probably the only place in Vegas you'll feel like you beat the house when you leave. 

Each dish is small but still enough to share, just the perfect size. I actually have a hard time deciding what to order here because everything sounds so delicious. I haven't had everything but I'm guessing you can't really go wrong here, even if you don't like what you order almost every small plate is under $10 with many being around $5 so you don't feel bad trying something new and out of the ordinary. 

The one thing that stands out above everything is the stuffed dates. It sounds weird but there is a reason it's the top mentioned item on yelp. 

I don't remember everything I had but I know it was all good and I can't wait to come back on my next trip. 5 stars easily, don't question it just go."}
{"text":"I LOVE coming to Firefly every time I visit Vegas. It's definitely one of my go to spots when I don't want to eat on the strip. They have great lunch specials, happy hour deals, and also great for date nights and dinner time. 

It is tapas style so there is plenty of options to choose from depending on your preferences. My girlfriend and I went the surf and turf route as the below will describe our order.

Scallops escargot
Tuna tartar
Lamb chops
Pallela 
I think we tried flan or an ice cream dessert I don't remember as I am writing this review over a month later. ( I know horrible procrastinator)

I have never gotten sick here and I've eaten here probably 6-7 times over the years of my Vegas trips. I love the honey butter or whatever butter they serve with the thin baguettes. They used to give olives with the bread but I guess not many people were eating it so they stop. I do believe you can request it though. Will come back as the location isn't really far from the strip either and they have a parking lot you can park in."}
{"text":"Came to Vegas for a bachelorette party with 7 girls and needed a pre-club dinner location. Firefly came highly recommend by a few locals as a great destination, so we decided to check it out. A few weeks prior to the event, I worked with Regina and Araceli to secure a reservation. Both of these ladies were awesome and extremely quick in their e-mail responses. I had a few  last minute changes to the # of attendees and they were super accommodating. 

In order to secure a Saturday night reservation, we were required to meet a $35 food / beverage minimum per person (not including tax / tip). The restaurant contacted me the morning of to reconfirm and see if there were any changes. When we arrived @ 8:30pm, I checked-in and had to sign an agreement guaranteeing we'd meet the minimum. Once the document was signed we were immediately seated. The line/wait outside looked ridic! I was was glad the reservation process was so seamless. 

The menu is extensive and a little overwhelming. Our waiter was helpful and made a few suggestions of the most popular dishes. I basically told him to start pumping everything out! Once we gave him the green light it felt like the plates never stopped coming:)  I'm allergic to shellfish, so I wasn't able to partake in all of the seafood dishes. Here are a few of my favs: 

Bacon Wrapped Stuffed Dates w/Bleu Cheese: I'm not a huge fan of bacon or dates - however these little things are addictive. The bacon is perfectly cooked with just the right amount of fat and crisp. The Bleu cheese and the smoked almond give it just the right amount sweetness and crunch. I ended up eating about 3 of them - the flavor is pretty rich, I couldn't imagine eating more. lol 

Roast Pork Empanada: You can never go wrong with Empanadas - nice flaky crust - a little on the salty side but still good.  

Stuffed Mushrooms - Chicken and Chorizzo: One of my favorite selections - Delish! 

Mac N Cheese: Cheesy and awesome with a bread crumb-esq crust. Our table polished off the first dish and immediately placed another order. 

Tuna Tartare: Great flavor - fresh and everyone seemed to like it. I literally could have eaten the entire plate by myself. 

Drinks are solid and the Mojito's are pretty damn tasty - we ordered 2 pitchers for the table to share. We also ordered a few other drinks from the bar which were OK. Best bet is to stick to the Mojito's and Sangria (light ice)."}
{"text":"So... there was no seating available indoors, so my girlfriend and I agreed to sit outdoors. I don't know about you, but it's very hard for me to enjoy a meal (or anything) in 120 degree weather... until Firefly. 

You are amazing."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh, SO good! I got the bacon-wrapped dates that everyone was talkin' about and they are orgasmic! I also ordered the shrimp ceviche - yum! The avocados were so fresh. Lastly, the veggie samosa, which was decent, not great. My boyfriend got the filet mignon sliders; I had a bite and they were so tender and juicy! His machego mac and cheese was just alright; that kind of cheese is too mild, in my opinion, for mac and cheese. A very enjoyable out-of-the-ordinary meal for Valentines Day! We had to wait for a table, but that's to be expected given the holiday. Service was pretty good; they were very attentive. I will probably be back!"}
{"text":"Firefly was very good and some dishes were great.   A fun dining experience off the Strip. 

Ambiance - 4 stars
Hipster.  But, very noisy and ice-cold AC inside.  So, we opted to sit outside, which was fine at 10pm 

Service - 3 stars
The server was very timely initially, but then they seemed to forget about us as the meal progressed.

Drinks - 2 stars
The Mojito & Margaritas were far too sweet and took forever to arrive.

Food - 
Menu Variety - 5 stars
Amazing choices (perhaps too many!)  ;-)

Stuffed dates - 5 stars
\"Dance Party\" in your mouth with bacon-wrapped, smoked almond, red wine reduction, blue cheese.  Amazing!

Ham & Cheese Croquetas - 3 stars
While good (and recommended by the server), it was just too rich & creamy to fully appreciate the Serrano Ham & Manchego Cheese

Steak & Mushroom Skewers - 4 stars
Grilled filet, roast garlic cream & red wine reduction.  There was quite a lot of meat, which was tender & tasty.  The sauce, while good, was a bit bland.

Beet Salad - 3 stars
It had all the proper components, beets, tender greens, nuts & feta cheese.  But, it was also somewhat bland.

Overall, Firefly was good and we might try it again with another group of friends."}
{"text":"My fave when near the Convention Center.  The sangria rocks.  Any and all flavors.   Food is always great."}
{"text":"This lil gem is by far one of my favorite places to eat in Vegas. It's amazing how tasty and well priced the food is! 

We ordered many tapas for our dinner.
Calamarai-- ok I've had better
Chicken Salad- definitely refreshing
Apple and Manchego Salad- delish!
Lamb Chops- Amazing
Paella-  THE BEST DISH there (in my opinion), omg, it was soo good!!! 
Stuffed Dates-- fiance said it was the worse dish all night, I didn't try it. lol

The sparkling sangria was also delicious and refreshing.

I've never been to such a well priced, great tasting tapas restaurant. I'm definitely going to come back!!"}
{"text":"I live in San Francisco, and San Francisco has good food...but nothing like Firefly!  The food is delicious, service is friendly, and the atmosphere is super fun!  Only downside is that it's a little dimly lit and can get a little loud.  I went on a Saturday night, so if you're looking to have a good conversation with your dinner-mates, go at a less crowded time or just try another place. 

They also have DELICIOUS sangrias - delicious enough to inspire me to make my own the next night.  Sadly, mine were not as good. 

Overall, if you're in vegas and want to get away from the strip, come here!"}
{"text":"One of the best secrets in Vegas! My favorite restaurant in Vegas. You order A bunch of appetizers and share. The Mac and cheese, calamari, ceviche, steak skewers, and best of all... The stuffed mushrooms with chorizo!!!! Order a pitcher of red sangria and your in heaven. A must try!"}
{"text":"I adore this place. It can be a little bit loud, especially later, but it's fun, it's delicious and it's quality! Order a pitcher of Sangria and dig in! Popular with locals & tourists - I bring all my friends here when they're visiting from out of town...

MUST TRY: Banana & Nutella sandwich for dessert. Sooo good!"}
{"text":"It was our first time to try Firefly. The food choices looked all great and different. After we ordered several small plates each they came out in no orderly fashion. One of us had all of our plates and the other person had none. I ordered a glass of wine that never came so I asked the waiter and he ran and got it.  We were enjoying our meal and I patiently waited for my empanadas when I realized I better ask in there whereabouts. Once again the waiter ran to get them.  Once I received them I was a bit disappointed because the were burned around the edges, which left about two bites of empanada because they are small.  Lastly the oil used to cook the fish sticks was past its prime because the fish stick color was an ugly darkish brown. No good. For the foot version the service could have been better. The food is very good but attention to detail would help."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Vegas! Everything is good.  I recommend the Blood Orange mojitos!"}
{"text":"After doing an extensive search of restaurants with private rooms, we settled on Firefly for my mom's 80th birthday party and dinner for about 20 guests. Setting up the reservation, menu and contract was a simple process. The room was great, we had our own private bartender and the food was fantastic! All for a price that was very competitive. The paella, meatballs and dates were a few of my faves--delicious! The service was excellent! We had put together a 6 minute video for my mother--she had a bit of a hard time hearing it so they turned off the music in the entire restaurant--on a Friday night--for the 6 minutes so she could hear the audio. That was an awesome touch--great food, great ambience and great customer service! I would completely recommend Firefly and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I should've reviewed this place months ago, as I visited way back in January. I was in Vegas for 5 days and this was by far my favorite restaurant and I will be back the next time I'm in the area. Heard about it on Yelp and realized the hotel we were staying at our first night was right next door so I made a reservation (btw this is a couple blocks behind the strip but worth the detour). We ordered the Stuffed Dates, fries, and beef bocadillas. We may have had one more item, but I can't remember. Everything's was great although the little beef sandwiches were noticeably bland. The true MVP of our meal was the pitcher of sangria we ordered: BEST. SANGRIA. EVERRRR!! I still day dream about this stuff. The atmosphere in here is completely appropriate for a special occasion, date night, or evening out with friends. My BF had never had tapas and since he's a big eater I was nervous, but he also loved his time hear and when he found out I hadn't written a review he scolded me, lol. It was his birthday and I had made a note on my online reservation. I was dog tired from our flight and we were stuffed so I had completely forget and was ready for the bill when they came out with a birthday flan for him. I'm not ashamed to admit that I fought him for the last tasty morsel. Great place."}
{"text":"A great place for a late night dinner.  I absolutely love tapas and the food here was not bad at all.  But I do have to say I wish our server told us while we were ordering that this so called small plates were not that small.  Coming from SF I really expect SMALL plates.  Dinner for 8 was super cheap $150 and that is with alcohol and we were stuffed.

We had the white sangria...it was yummy tasted like juice.  I seriously think we over ordered.  We had the tuna tartare, sliders, calamari, ceviche, paella and a bunch of other stuff.  Everything was pretty good and once again the prices were great.  I would definitely come back again if time allows the next time I come back to Vegas."}
{"text":"Best tapas options available if you want to try multiple dishes. Lots of variety. Four stars for good taste."}
{"text":"A friend of mine wanted to meet up at the Sahara location and had to doublecheck she didn't mean the one that shutdown on Paradise.  I love tapas and I love Firefly but I don't want to sign up for food poisoning.

We ordered the bacon wrapped dates, fries, scallops escargot, empanada and baked tetilla.  I had 1 sangria and 2 sparkling white sangrias.  As always, food and drinks were amazing.  And I didn't get sick afterwards!

However, out of all the Firefly locations in the Vegas area, this one has the worst service.  Our glasses would be left dry for a long time.  Nobody was there to check on us or make sure we have enough to drink.

The one in Anthem is much busier than this location yet the service there was sooo much better."}
{"text":"We were here for my BFF's birthday. I really like the food at Firefly but just like the Sahara location, service here is bad. It's just a tad bit better here. However, parking is impossible here. I had no choice but do valet on a Friday night. 

I asked for a white sangria and a glass of water as soon as we sat down. I got my sangria but got my glass of water a few minutes before we left...that's 2 hours later! But then again, we were a big group. I can tell our server was really TRYING his best.

I noticed they added more items on their menu especially desserts. My Firefly faves are Firefly fries, bacon-wrapped dates, sangria and steak and mushroom skewers and a few others but I only ordered those last night since I wasn't too hungry at 9:30pm. I did get some calamari and chicken and chorizo stuffed mushrooms from my friends. We also got a rib eye. It was huge and comes with fries for only $20, wow! Last night's fries were super oily though.

If you get the fries, get double aioli...it's yummy! You can't go wrong with their sangria...either red or white. Just get a pitcher and leave happy. I don't recommend the Nutella dessert and I'm a huge Nutella freak...it's something you can make at home. Pretty much everything on their menu is delicious, trust me. Just have the patience for the service and pray they won't have another health violation scare."}
{"text":"We went to Firefly on a Thursday night and were surprised at how crowded it was.  Good thing we had a reservation.  We found out why people flock to this restaurant after we ordered 5-6 generously portioned tapas, including duck rolls, tortilla espagnol, pulpo asado (grilled octopus), apple and manchego salad and wilted spinach salad.  That was plenty for two people, and the bill came out to about $50, drinks included.  We left very satisfied with our dining experience.  Firefly is definitely worth checking out next time you are in Vegas."}
{"text":"OMG. I'm so in love. Make me wanna say OH OH OH. OMG.

I love, love, love this place! It's works well for groups and dates. It's the everything place!

Firefly is a tapas restaurant. Tell your friends it's a tapas place and they think it's a titty bar. For reals. 

I've never ordered anything here and not been pleased. There are a variety of different option: hot tapas, cold tapas, meats, seafood, vegetarian, and desserts. There are entree options, but ordering a variety of everything with a group of 4 or more is the way to go! They also have this plate with bread, olives, and butter that is complimentary. I have no idea what that herby-butter goodness is, but it blows my mind.

What really wins me over is Firefly's mojitos (various flavors) and sangria (red, white, or sparkling wine options). They can be ordered by the picture and for a group of 4, everyone will have about 2 glasses a piece and it's a steal at $18. 

Venture off the Strip and get here people. You will not be disappointed. You will be delighted.

The few downsides of this place are the looooong wait times at peak hours and the noise level. It is loud. It's even louder when their is a DJ blasting Spanish music. I deal with it, though. I also prefer to sit out side."}
{"text":"I love this place! I love the smaller portions. The dates are my favorite! It is a little loud but the food makes up for it."}
{"text":"This place just gets better and better everytime we go... craving those awesome bacon dates so we went here the other day.  The service is alwYs great and so friendly...
So we ordered the dates again...2 orders this time. So addicting with a pitcher of their fab mojitos!  
We also got the tuna tartare again with taro chips...fresh and light and big portion.
The kabob with chorizo shrimp and steak was melt in ur mouth delicioso!
We tried the spicy shrimp served with bread to sop up the amazing sauce... Wow! This is up there with those scrumptious dates!

Firefly never misses... a pitcher of mojitos N yummy tapas... Cant go wrong"}
{"text":"[note: if i could give 2.5 stars, i would. alas.]

pros: great ambiance, lovely outdoor patio, good service, relatively inexpensive, free valet

cons: the food. bleh. my sister and i ordered the chicken skewers, spicy beef salad, summer veggies, and patatas bravas. everything was bland and flavorless except the potatoes, which were so spicy they were practically inedible. the spicy beef salad supposedly contained filet mignon but the beef was grey, dry, and chewy. it was also topped with a dumptruck full of crunchy wonton crisps that were all stuck in the thick, gloopy dressing so i couldn't just push them aside. i was pretty annoyed bc these weren't listed anywhere in the description on the menu. i have special dietary requirements and if i had known they were on the dish i would have made sure to order it without. i wound up sending this dish back. (our waiter did take it off the bill without me specifically having to ask though, which is always appreciated.)

service: 5/5
ambiance: 4/5 (it was just a skooch too dark and i needed my phone flashlight to read the menu like an old lady.)
food: 1/5

if you're looking for delicious tapas in Vegas i'd recommend Jaleo over Firefly. yes, it's significantly more expensive, but the food is light-years better in quality."}
{"text":"Best place for Tapas. Service was friendly. Atmosphere was very amazing. Prices was nice.All in all a very nice place to try out."}
{"text":"Our first time here was good
We sat ourselves and although we saw plenty of people walk past us. We sat for 15 minutes without menus or being acknowledged. My company went to the restroom, came back and had to ask someone for menus. 

After that. We didn't have a problem with everything else. 
Food was fast. 
The second waiter that attended to our order was quick and attentive along with the blond girl with black glasses whom I assume is the busser. She has good work ethic. We needed to get our servers attention because we wanted to order desert. She informed us that our waiter was busy but offered to pass down our order. Very much appreciated. 

The 4 Stars was Bc how it started other than that
The food was hands down Amazing"}
{"text":"Easy cab ride from The Strip. Excellent sangria - get a pitcher! There was a table limit of 1.5 hours when we were there - not sure if that's always the case. Quick service. Charming place, good menu variety, worth the cab fare. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"After so many years, this is still my favorite place. The food is amazing and great customer service from my favorite waiter Alejandro. Highly recommended!!!!"}
{"text":"The food is great! Wow, full flavored and a great presentation. Service is good- they check on you, glass never empty, polite, and helpful. Food was fast. This is a first time and it wasn't busy on a weekday 11pm."}
{"text":"I had my mother's 60th birthday party here with preordered platters and pitchers of Sangria. The food, sangria and service was amazing! Everyone was extremely prompt and professional. I will definitely host more parties here!"}
{"text":"Very nice food choices! I had their lamp chop, beef, mussels and clams. Clams weren't too great because they were way too small and some had sands in them. Mussel were small too but they were fresh and prefectly cooked.

Their \"full bar\" wasn't full at all, they didn't have my favorite Macallan 12; their red wine selection seemed to be a lot more nicer though - one star off. 

A very nice place to go if you arriving Las Vegas late, they open till 2am."}
{"text":"This is my spot! For me - small plates - freshly cooked - are perfect. The service is efficient and mostly friendly. But the food is the attraction at the end of the day. They are open late which suits my vampire hours very well indeed. 

I've now eaten here three times - and the stuffed mushroom w/ chicken and chorizo is my favorite. The fish sticks, and empanadas are also top notch. 

Wifey loved the ceviche of shrimp, & crispy duck rolls. ...The almond butter spread they offer free w/ bread is worth the trip alone! 

It IS loud - so know that going in. They get very busy on Friday & Saturday nights from 6-10 pm."}
{"text":"I used to come here years ago and thought everything was half off on happy hour. Came in today on happy hour & nothing was on happy hour or told about the happy hour. $28 sangria was the only thing discounted to $18. Never was told by the bartender or the 3 bartenders that it's not half off, which most people assume or the server bartender tells them. Empty bar, 3 bartenders horrible service. Won't come back. Back in the day it was good."}
{"text":"Happy hour allows you to drink half priced, and the cocktail list and sangria is to die for. Every time my Hubs and I go, we try something new and never feel disapointed. Some of my favorites are:
Watermelon skinny Sandia cocktail(no longer on the menu but will make for you)
Octopus(pulpa asado)
Thai beef salad
Stuffed dates
Fish sticks

The crowd is worth mentioning, as well as the bar staff. They give top notch service. Cheers!"}
{"text":"My overall experience here was a pleasant one! Service was exceptional (THANKS JESUS!), food was excellent & the atmosphere was far from the norm. Upon arrival, they start you off with a mini loaf of toasted sliced bread, a little bit of almond butter, & green olives. DELICIOUS! I didn't want to completely fill up on bread, but I was easily tempted. My favorite dish was the Veggie Empanadas! Absolutely the most hearty & savory out of all the plates we tried. Each bite was flaky, creamy & warm. In nature, I barely like any of the veggies that are apart of the stuffing. Thanks to these empanadas, I'll be giving mushrooms another chance! The Passion Fruit Mini Cheesecakes came in at a very close second place. The thickness of each little bite threw my taste buds for a loop- the exciting kind, like on rollercoasters! My only complaint is that some the portions could have been a little more robust. I'm well versed on the whole concept of tapas being small plates, but I feel like the big & thick flavors of a dish should make up for that. With only 1 drawback, I think my lunch at FIREFLY* was a success! I can't wait to go back & try more things!!!"}
{"text":"Came for happy hour.

Got the chicken skewers and empanadas. Delicious. Skewers came with asparagus and potatoes. Empanadas came with a small salad. 

All felt like enough food for a single meal.

In total $14 before tip."}
{"text":"uh.maze.ing. You don't see many restaurants rated at 4.5 stars very often. And a local friend recommended this place as his favorite so we were intrigued. 

The restaurant is in a little strip mall of a parking lot- nothing too fancy. The dress is nice but casual and you don't need a suit. There are no stuffy white table cloths to be found. I'm sure they appreciate elbows off the table but I love any restaurant where I don't have to be conscious about proper manners. We went early around 7:30/8pm and luckily our group of 6 immediately got a table. The service was great, ambiance was perfect and the food was incredible. 

Order the pitcher of red sangria ($28). It was delicious!

We ordered 3 plates each expecting little servings of tapas. We were surprised with the generous portions (small salad plate style) and was planning on ordering more but couldn't even finish those. I can't decide what was my favorite. All of these dishes woke up our taste buds: bacon wrapped Stuffed Dates, Tuna Tartare, Smoked Salmon Toasts, Filet Mignon Sliders, Crispy Duck Roll, Babyback Ribs, Fried Calamari, Warm Spinach Salad with strawberries.

Trio of Gelato (pistaccio is my fav) and the Dessert Platter were yummy. The dessert platter was just a taste of all the desserts and just enough so we didn't feel like we were missing out. We couldn't have fit any more food in our bellies.

I would skip the Fish Sticks (wish they would make them smaller and it was nothing special). And the Artichoke Toasts were the only disappointment. They sounded so hopeful on the menu but were served cold and in a chunk. It couldn't keep up with the rest of the wonderful plates on our table. 

And best of all, our bill was affordable and didn't break the bank."}
{"text":"Order the stuffed dates ( bacon wrapped, smoked almonds, red wine reduction, blue cheese) 
Camarines a la diabla was perfection. 
The chicken and chorizo stuffed mushrooms needed more kick. Chicken and mushroom blended out any flavors they were aiming for. 
Seriously, just start at the top of the menu and start working your way through. I'll be back for round 2,3,4,5,etc."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE!! I make a point to go here at least a few times every time I go to Vegas. The food here is waaaay better than that of the hotel restaurants, which for the most part is overpriced garbage. My fave dishes...
Veggie Empanadas
Tomato Soup and mini grilled cheese (I always have to add a half pack of sugar to the soup)
Shrimp, I forget the name but I think it's in a garlic butter sauce.
Chicken Skewers- out of this world, not dry at all and so tasty
I haven't had them in a while, but I also remember the Duck Eggrolls being very yummy.
Beet Salad was good too

The mushroom tart was not my fave, kinda boring. Puff pastry triangles with mushrooms and cream sauce poured on top. 
I also was not loving the bread pudding."}
{"text":"This place is one of the top spots in Las Vegas, anything in the menu it's to die for just to name a few...the empanadas, chorizo stuffed mushrooms, the steak and mushroom skewers, camarones a la diabla and the list can just go on and on and to end up with the dessert the tres leches cake, I can't wait 

to go back, good thing I am local and can go anytime I want..."}
{"text":"Was here for a wedding while still under construction. One of the back rooms were made ready for the wedding we were attending. 
Food was good, not the best you expect for a wedding. I need to try their regular food and service."}
{"text":"On Sun. 11/24 the 4 of us arrived at Firefly at brunch time.  There were only 6 others in the restaurant and 1 server.  Of all the tapa orders, only the steak turned out.  One friend's eggs came alone on a plate & her toast was burnt & not buttered.  Myself & another friend ordered the same warm spinach salad & sent them back because they were swimming in a very acidic dressing & hers didn't contain any of the red peppers.  We exchanged these for a garden salad but that equally small one didn't contain hearts of palm as stated in menu.  Either the server or chef forgot about my eggplant cannoloni for a half hour & it came only after my reminder.  Unfortunately, it was a tiny portion, mushy & obviously overcooked.  Since  they were serving pumpkin beignets, we weren't offered the bread basket with the good almond butter.  We asked; then received enough for two, & weren't offered more.

The restaurant never did see many guests that morning, and considering the faux pas on so many items we ordered, the manager could have offered a future free meal or desserts for all of us, or a glass of wine.  But we merely were asked if we wanted anything else.

As a recent newcomer to Firefly, I was not impressed and will make no plans to return to neither the Sahara location nor Paradise.

K I K I"}
{"text":"Ah, Firefly. Where do I even begin?

Right. I begin with sangria, like I always do. Happy hour gets you half off sangria plus a free tapas. A pitcher during regular hours will be around $18 and should get two people through dinner at around three glasses each. They offer red, white, and sparkling sangria. I can't say I've tried any other than the red; why mess with perfection?

A free bread basket is always good, especially when it comes with the amazing herb butter they make in-house. Olives are served on the side.

The menu isn't huge but seems daunting. You absolutely have to read the titles and the descriptions of each dish. Does \"Stuffed dates\" sound appealing? Maybe it does, but the additional \"bacon wrapped, smoked almond, red wine reduction, blue cheese\" can't hurt.

Assuming you're a party of two, and you've waded through the menu, order at least three things per person. Of course, at happy hour for a snack, one item is perfect, but I'm talking dinner here. Some dishes that my other half and I never fail to order: Stuffed Dates (sometimes one order for each of us; an order gets you five), Chicken and Chorizo Stuffed Mushrooms, Manchego Mac n Cheese, Mushroom Tart, and Petite Filet. Some that are not always necessary but we love them: Patatas Bravas, Albondigas, Crispy Duck Rolls, and Steak and Mushroom Skewers. We probably end up with ten different dishes every time we go there.

I would like to make it through the entire menu, but my go-to plates are so delicious that I'm only able to try one or two new things every time! Last time I did get the Crispy Duck Rolls for the first time, and I will definitely be getting them again. I haven't tried any of their five entrees, but I'm intrigued by the Paella and will try it soon.

This is another do-not-skip-dessert place. There are very few places where I must have dessert; this is one of them. At least every second time I eat at Firefly, I order the Chocolate-Cherry Bread Pudding. Actually, desire would be a more appropriate word. I desire this dessert. Bread pudding is my favorite dessert, and this is one of the best I've ever had.

Firefly has two locations. One is downtown in the Plaza hotel, with a gorgeous view of Fremont street from a big glass dome where most of the seating is. The other is on Paradise, near the Hard Rock, convenient for visitors from the Strip, with excellent ambiance and an outdoor patio. The food is excellent and the menu is the same at both locations.

Parking is easy and free. Reservations are a good idea; they can be made via OpenTable."}
{"text":"I was visiting my friend in Las Vegas and he happened to bring me to this nifty little joint...and by little I mean quite large. When we first walked in on a chilly Tuesday night, the restaurant seemed poppin'. After looking around, I realized most of these kids were teenagers! WHY! Is this where the cool kids flock to during the weekdays in Vegas?

The hostess seated us after a few minutes and we took our orders. I was FREEZING! Has this restaurant heard of a thing called HEAT?!?! It was especially cold for my table because we were positioned right next to the patio door. Every time someone walked through...WHOOSH! A slap of cold air delivered directly into my face. OK, so maybe I'm exaggerating a bit...but it was cold!

I ordered the meatball tapa, a nice salad, and the sliders. They were all extremely satisfying! I especially liked the sliders, but I was a bit full off of my other orders and the bread. My friends ordered the fries...and that meal...was...wow. The fries themselves weren't fantastic, but when you have a bunch of friends at a table just talking...the finger foods will inevitably be eaten just because they were there in front of us.

So that was our meal. A little pricey for the drinks...the service was subpar...and I was shivering most of the time. But if you're going here to catch up with some friends (or make new ones), by all means...go for it!

I can't say that I'll be here again because I don't live in Vegas, but I wouldn't mind returning if someone wanted to go. So all in all....mediocre.

Bring a jacket."}
{"text":"Firefly is a local Tapas and small plates restaurant located on Paradise Rd. in the center of Las Vegas. It's easily accessible from anywhere in the city and always open late. I used to come here all the time and accidentally burnt myself out on the place, so I had to take a break but it's been long enough so I'm back. Anytime I come here I usually start with the Stuffed Dates [bacon-wrapped,smoked almond,red wine reduction with blue cheese]. That gets me ready for the next few items that I order which are the Chicken Skewers [grilled marinated chicken breast,seasonal veggies,and roasted garlic cream]
The Petit Filet [mini filet mignon, herb cheese,roasted potatoes,mushrooms and red wine sauce]
The Baked Cod [lemon,garlic,butter and fried onion]
The Chorizo Plate [4 imported thinly sliced cured meats, cornichons, capers and mustard] and lastly
The Baked Goat Cheese [goat and garlic cream cheese, tomato sauce, Pesto and toast]. All are delicious and should be given a chance. Now for dessert well they have over ten to choose from so I'm sure you guys will find something. As far as the actual restaurant and bar the vibe is great and always fun. It's a cool hangout if you and some friends just wanna kill some time!"}
{"text":"Great Location and View.. excellent Tapas and awesome Sangria"}
{"text":"I ate here for the first time a couple months ago. I usually don't like to go off the strip when I am in Vegas, seems like too much of hassle. It really wasn't and well worth it. We caught an Uber from our hotel and we were there in 10 min. This was one of the best meals I have had in Vegas and that is saying a lot. Their drinks are just as good. And, it's pretty inexpensive. Every friend I have who has recently gone to Vegas I have told them to go here. So good!"}
{"text":"Everytime I come to Vegas I tried to hit up this spot very good tapas here I'm not a drinker but the people at our table we're having sangria they look absolutely delicious"}
{"text":"Just get the skewers and skewers an more skewers! Tappas style restaurant. Went in on a Thursday and was seated right away. The sangria is very popular here, which I am usually not a fan of because usually it's too sweet, but it's a great balance between fruit and alcohol here. I'm already a fan."}
{"text":"Best. Sangria. PERIOD.

Came by myself but ended up finding another friendly diner who was willing to split a selection of tapas dishes with me. We tried the artichoke toasts, stuffed dates, padron peppers, warm spinach salad, roasted eggplant cannelloni, manchego mac 'n' cheese, a fruit and cheese platter, and of course the sangria. Each dish was delightful, although the warm spinach salad was my least favorite. To be fair, it was up against some really flavorful, memorable dishes. I would eat the stuffed dates every day if my arteries would allow it.

Not to beat a dead horse, but this place has ruined all other sangria for me. I eagerly await my next trip to Vegas, if only for the chance to dine here again."}
{"text":"Delicious! Love this place. It isn't really kid friendly. Ill go back over and over. Loved everything I've had and would love to go now."}
{"text":"Great recommend Yelpers! Start to finish everything was delish! The restaurant while needing a lot of upgrade was clean and comfortable.  Ordered too much, not so different from most Tapas lovers, but glad we did! Notables are all the empanadas, lychee ceviche, mushroom tart, Moscow Mule, and Old Fashion Bourbon. The cocktails, not surprisingly cost about as much as the food so beware of cocktail choices. Otherwise, Firefly* is definitely a great place!"}
{"text":"This location is such a hit or miss for me. 

I first came here and I didn't really enjoy my experience. The service was slow and not enthusiastic.  The food was bland.  I ordered a dessert I forgot the name but I know it was nutella something.  The dessert was not appeasing, I would have rather just eaten the nutella out of the jar instead of ordering that dessert ever again.  

A few other times I came here, the service was great, the food was delicious, and I think that they have the best stuffed peppers here in this location.  I did like the fact that they also have an outdoor seating area. & I actually like this outdoor seating area than the one at the Henderson location. 

I would still come back to this location since it is closest to my house now.  But i will miss the henderson location."}
{"text":"First coming here was such an amazing experience.  
From the stuffed dates, mango spare ribs, thai beef salad, and the mussels, man! what amazing food.  
The service is always on the top of their toes, i hardly ever have to ask them to refill my drink or have to call them to come to the table.  They always check up on you whether if it is busy or not.  

My personal favorites are:
stuffed dates (i always order at least 2)
tres leches (dessert)
thai beef salad
mac & cheese
mango spare ribs
just recently lobster escargot

I love this spot and my favorite firefly location :) cant go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"By far the better of the two locations. If it was not for my friend wanting to drive around before dinner, I would still be going to the Paradise location. These two are like polar opposite siblings; one is the dark party monster while the other is a more laid back social butterfly. 

The reasons to love the Sahara location. 
1- The fireplace is a nice touch that gives off a more chill atmosphere.
2. High ceilings and adequate lighting makes it look larger. 
3. It is not crazy busy, so we were sat right away.
4. Staff are quick to drop off food, remove dirty plates, refill drinks, and even pour my sangria for me.
5. For the first time in eons, I checked the bill and it was right. (The last three times my group went to the other one, we had to get things removed because they never came or they ran out and didn't take it off.)
6. Food is still delicious (Different presentation style then the other one, but flavors are spot on.)
7. Right now they have Pumpkin Beignets. They are not really beignets, more like donut holes, but still delicious. 

The reason to dislike the Sahara location.
1. If you are sitting on the high tops near the door, a cold draft hits you every other minute. 

The Lamb Skewers were tender and juicy. They sat on a bed of lentils. I would have been happy with just a bowl of these phenomenal legume. The purple onions contributed to the flavor and gave them a nice bite. Duck Roll with a hoisin reduction will always be high on my list of to get items. The Stuffed Dates and Patatas Bravas are also crowd pleasers. 

We made the mistake of getting a pitcher between the two of us. $28 is a great deal compared to the regular price for two glass, so it was a no brainer to just man up. This man will be giving up alcohol for a while."}
{"text":"Today was the first day that I had been able to go back to Firefly in over 2 and a half years. It would have been five stars easily, if it was based off of my prior experiences, but not so much anymore. Three stars seems too low for a place that use that used to hold a special place in my heart and stomach, so four stars seems about right.

The savory tapas are still delicious.

The standout dishes are:
Tortilla espanola- A potato omelet dish garnished with sriracha sauce and  parsley.
Crispy duck rolls- Fried duck egg roll served with a hoisin dressing.
Camarones a la diabla- A spicy and sweet shrimp dish. Get some extra bread and mop up the sauce.
Shrimp ceviche-  Large chunks of shrimp, avocado, diced onions and bell pepper tossed in lime juice and served with tortilla strips.
Stuffed dates- Dates stuffed with almonds, wrapped in bacon, fried crispy, garnished with goat cheese and parsley. 

If it was not 12:30pm... who am I kidding, if I wasn't driving, I would have been drinking. Remember kids, don't drink and drive. Make someone else be the DD. Their red and white sangrias are delicious. The best part of the drunken state comes from eating the fermented fruit floating around. After a few, it becomes a game to catch them all. Firefly's mojitos are amazing as well. My personal favorite are the mango or blood orange.  Even though it is a rum drink, that uses simple syrup, the fruit juices don't make it overbearingly sweet.

The real disappointment lies in the desserts. I use to love this place for their banana nutella sandwiches and the chocolate tres leches cake, but the former was lacking immensely today. For one, there was hardly any banana in the sandwiches and they were cooked so dry that I needed to ladle the nutella onto it. Don't get me wrong, I would drink nutella, but I want to have the choice to go without it and that was taken away from me. The tres leches cake was delicious, but did it get smaller? Since coming back to Vegas, this has been the first time I looked at a dish and said, \"WTF, where is my food?\".

I should have gone with my first instinct and gone to the Lunch Box for their waffle ice cream sandwich."}
{"text":"Every time me and my SO come out to Las Vegas, we try to make it a point to come out to firefly.

The food is good and consistent, sangria is delicious, and service is stellar.

Difficulty may be be met if you're trying to come here before hitting up the clubs on the strip due to crowds and timing so be sure to plan ahead.  Otherwise, I recommend coming here for lunch when service is a bit more tame and you have time to enjoy yourself without having to worry if you'll get back in time to get in the door somewhere else on the strip.

Favorites of ours include the paella, terra y mare skewers, camarones a la diabla and of course the sangria."}
{"text":"I love Firefly...I've never been to this location though. I find this location more convenient, the food and service was just as good as the Paradise location.
I always get their yummy Stuffed Dates, Filet Sliders, Lamb Chops, Tempura Shrimp, and Ham and Cheese Croquetas.
The Artichoke toasts,  Padron Peppers, Firefly Fries, and Baked Tetilla are tasty as well. Not a fan of the Albondigas, a bit plain, nothing exciting going on there.
Their mojitos and sangrias are perfect belly washers. The complimentary olives and toast with butter spread is perfect. Fun place for a group to pick a bunch of tapas and share, then you get to try more.
The only dessert I've ever had was their Chocolate Cherry Bread Pudding which was bit too heavy after all those tapas."}
{"text":"This place was great!wonderful ambiance, everything on the menu sounded awesome and everything we ordered was yummy ;)"}
{"text":"everything was great! had my 25th b-day dinner here...and it was so much fun! 
order the mussels, mac and cheese and fries - but pretty much everything on the menu was good...great pairing with a pitcher of mojitos...
however, friends set-up a cupcake arrangement for me and there was a cupcake missing...oh, well hope the staff enjoyed it..."}
{"text":"Everything was just awesome. Food came out promptly and the drinks were very good. We got there during happy hour which was an added bonus."}
{"text":"This place is always packed for good reason!  The plates might be small, but the flavors are gargantuan.  Their best selling dish is the stuffed dates (bacon-wrapped, smoked almond, red wine reduction, blue cheese), in fact they're so popular the kitchen never stops preparing them during operating hours.  They practically arrive before you can finish saying the word dates.  I wouldn't be surprised at all if there is some unique baseball-esque eye/hand signal that the servers flash the kitchen to notify another order of dates has been placed.

One of my other staples is the granny smith apple & manchego salad (green apples, manchego cheese, smoked almonds, lightly dressed).  We tried the roasted eggplant cannelloni for the first time and oh my, this is an instant favorite; it's thin slices of eggplant stuffed with generous amounts of goat cheese in a light tomato sauce.  The best values are: 
1) the large portion of Firefly fries for $6, which come generously spiced with parmesan and herbs & a delectable aioli dipping sauce and 
2) the steamed mussels @ $8 are swimming in a giant bowl of red curry, white wine, coconut cream broth 

Their drinks are bangin!!  I love the house-infused vodka (with berries and lychee), which makes for an absolutely amazing martini, but watch out because it packs a strong punch despite the deceptively delicious flavor.  The pear-ginger martini is another winner, as well as the sangria pitchers with fresh fruit afloat.  

The don't accept reservations during high traffic times.  Even when they tell you that there is a wait, it is never long.  

This is one hot spot that you can believe ALL of the hype.  It's all that and then some.  The only word of caution is that it is easy to get carried away with ordering and tasting, and before you know it you can accrue a thriving tab!"}
{"text":"Outstanding food, vibe and service. A must stop in Vegas. Really really good! So many good items. Order a bunch and share!! Empanadas are a must! A great place for groups."}
{"text":"With all these reviews there probably isnt much more that can be said, but Ill say it anyway...

For the positive: The food is great. Such a good selection and everything I have had here is good quality and really tasty. The vibe here is also nice. Low lighting, a generally good crowd, relaxed atmosphere. Prices are also fairly reasonable for the location and quality. Though very busy, the service was attentive and mostly friendly, especially the girl at the bar.

Negatives: On the weekend this place can be a nightmare with crowds and parking. Unfortunately the place is WAY too popular for its small parking lot. Also, its fairly small for the amount of people who try to pack in, especially on the heated patio. I also agree with others who say the alcohol, and sangria in general, is nothing to rave about. Between three friends and I we had many pitchers of sangria and were still stone cold sober by the end of the night. I also find the crowd somewhat off at times. The last time we were there it was a weird mix of some strange, rich preppy people and obvious prostitutes/clients at the bar. I mean, I guess whatever floats your boat."}
{"text":"HOLY SHIZNIT! THIS PLACE IS EFFIN GOOD! I came one night last year with the fellaz during a night of drunken stupor and I thought it was good. Of course I had to second guess myself and make sure it wasn't just the alcohol in my system that was doing the tasting. So when I came back this year with my wife, I had to be sure.  We landed in Vegas at around noon and decided to head straight for Firefly. 
It was a nice day, the sun was out and the wind was blowing a little so we decided to sit outside. The service was very attentive and the red sangria quenched our thirst. Here's what we ordered:

Stuffed Dates wrapped with bacon - There's something about stuffing a date that's exciting(in every sense of the word). Crunchy on the outside moist on the in. Blue cheese compliments the flavor. One of my favorite items. http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=TDQQuCXIqJHFP8Ts5YtTzw&userid=qAjGCMN4je7NkLz6YcrAYA

Stuffed Peppers -  For some reason I like things that are stuffed with other things. These were not as good as the dates, but good enough.
http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=pRmb8_tAP5y4YPt_viL07g&userid=qAjGCMN4je7NkLz6YcrAYA

Steamed Mussels -  Moist, tender, succulent. And they came with garlic bread to sop up the sauce they came in. Two thumbs up.
http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=x52o2wmZ4n0IkslttyemMA&userid=qAjGCMN4je7NkLz6YcrAYA

Crispy Duck roll - Crispy and full of duck, topped with hoisin sauce and green onions. Finger-licking good.
http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=SRf8mX8LTkTJNr3ZX9sCCA&userid=qAjGCMN4je7NkLz6YcrAYA

Padron Peppers - Green like the Hulk, but not overwhelmingly strong. The have a nice subtle flavor and are complemented nicely with sea salt and lemon. Very tasty.
http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=W8-Bsk_hHg5pxbt4EhmPWQ&userid=qAjGCMN4je7NkLz6YcrAYA

Tierra y Mar Skewers - It's like having steak and lobster on a skewer. And topped with salsa verde! DAYAMN!!!! So good.

I've been to other Spanish Tapas places in other cities and this is by far the best that I have tasted. Maybe they drug their food with some kind of min-altering substance. I don't know. But this place has awesome food, great service and a sexy atmosphere. I wish we had one just like it in DC."}
{"text":"I am not going to BS with the review, if you are giving this place anything less than a 5 star you are hating.  Unless you can find me a place that provides the same quality food and cheaper or higher quality with the same price.  

This place deserve to be the only place I know with 1000+reviews with a solid 5 stars.  

Quick tip you can impress girls here, tell her you will take her off the strip and then take her back to your hotel...."}
{"text":"I went to Firefly Downtown with a few friends last night and it was great!
The food is Tapas style, which means small portions that are  meant to be shared.  I was able to get a few things made vegan by ordering without the cheese. The food was great, they also have a fun drink menu including different type of sangria's. The view of downtown is awesome and there's a great atmosphere with good music. It's definitely a great place to bring visitors from out t of town or to go with a group of friends."}
{"text":"Thank you fellow yelpers for this great find!

This place was pretty packed, good thing we had a reservation. We were pretty hung over, so we didn't do the mojitos, but they looked really good. The tapas were pretty awesome. Not as great as I thought they were going to be, but still pretty good. My fav was the banana-nutella sandwiches for dessert----SOOOOOO good! Super fast service too!

Will def. come back again."}
{"text":"I finally tried out the location closest to my work. We went shortly after they opened and the place wasn't busy at all. The service was excellent. Even walking to the bathroom every employee I passed said hello and smiled! We ordered the steamed mussels, the white anchovies on toast, the stuffed dates and ribs. Everything was on par with the quality and taste of the restaurant on Paradise, Delicious! I have to say though that the steamed mussels dish was literally half the size of the portion I got at the other location. 

I can't wait to come back for Happy Hour!"}
{"text":"We ate at the old Firefly location several times when we visited Las Vegas three years ago and I was eager to eat there again.  The new location is much larger and the décor was nice.  The tapas were just as good as I remembered and we really enjoyed our lunch.  We ordered a variety of items and enjoyed them all.  As always, the bacon wrapped dates were delicious and I also enjoyed the chicken skewers over a bed of roasted veggies.  We will definitely return when we visit Las Vegas in the future."}
{"text":"One of the best kept secrets in Vegas!  The food here yummy and the prices are much better than those fancy steak houses on the strip.  The sangria isn't strong but is delicious!

I recommend if you plan on coming here, make reservations.  It can get busy."}
{"text":"Excellent place for small plate Tapas and wine. Modern Chic Decor, fun environment to go with excellent food. Service is good, staffs are friendly. I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I really like this restaurant. The environment was pretty relaxed but elegant. The appetizers & drinks were great and price was reasonable. 

I suggest if you go with a group of friends (like we did) we just all ordered and did it family style. That way you all can try everything on the menu :)"}
{"text":"This is on of the most arrogant places you do not want to deal it. I am temporary tax exempt and the managers do not want even to look at the paper work! If you are on the Army, do not give your money to those salsa/chips  copiers idiots!"}
{"text":"I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT HERE!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Came to Vegas this past weekend for a weekend get away and I finally got the chance to try the place out. A lot of friends have been recommending this place but I never got the chance to go due to Vegas shenanigans I would always get caught up into. lol. 

Every dish we ordered was delish and their sangrias are to die for. I wish they were a bit stronger but its okay I'm just going to have to order my own pitcher with a straw next time ;).  Service is great and the staff are all super friendly. We must of ordered like 10 different small tapas dishes, a paella, and a pitcher of sangria and the bill came out to be about $125 for 5 people, SUPER REASONABLE!!! Unlike that Spanish restaurant they have at the Cosmopolitan, which was way too overly priced with super duper small portions that didn't even taste good. But its okay lesson learned, just go off the strip to Fireflys for your Spanish fix. 

I'm making sure every time I'm in Vegas to pencil in Fireflys for dinner. Ah! Cant wait to go back :)!!!!!"}
{"text":"I like this place, the service always been good,flavors are well balance, nice presentation. Sangria is well prepared, a little sweet, a hint of vodka. Sitting at bar is always my favorite spot... You can see the whole place and get faster service."}
{"text":"On our last night in Vegas, we had a work dinner at Firefly. My boss actually scouted this place on Yelp and made a reservation. Good job, bossman! Needless to say, I was excited about this place all week due to the raving Yelp reviews, and my fellow Yelpers did not lead us astray!

We started with the Sparkling Sangria, which was delicious! Then I sat back and watched my two coworkers, who I lovingly refer to as \"Woodchipper 1.0,\" and \"Woodchipper 2.0\" literally suck down plate after plate after plate of delicious food. I wish I would have videotaped this scene, it was epic. 

The bacon wrapped dates were probably the most amazing thing I have I ever tasted in my entire life. Seriously! I think the \"Woodchippers\" had at least 25 of those each. 

All in all, we had the best time. Great laughs, great food, and great times! I highly recommend this joint. It is straight awesome sauce. :)"}
{"text":"This kind of reminded me of a diner that decided to re-brand itself as a tapas restaurant.  The space is large, with both indoor and outdoor seating.  The service was very efficient.  The menu was huge with sections for cold, hot, meat and seafood tapas.  

The quality and preparation were not all that great, though.  Best thing about it was that the portions were huge.  The ahi tuna skewers and spinach salad was enough for two people.  The fish,however, wasn't of a good quality and it came in some gooey sauce.  The salad was OK, with pine nuts and artichokes and feta, but needed some vinegar and flavor oomph.  The merguez sausage was odd tasting, unlike any I've had before and quite spicy.  The octopus was mealy and came in a large dish with mushy potatoes and other mushy items - odd.  The serrano ham sliders came on awful supermarket hamburger buns and the burgers were of a low quality.  The fried onions as a side, however, were the highlight of the meal. 

Considering the amount of food the prices are very reasonable.  Just like a diner."}
{"text":"Very fun and lively place for a late dinner with loud music and great people watching. Tons of large groups with bachelorette parties. We had a late night dinner @ 10 PM and ordered a pitcher of red sangria, stuffed dates, skewers, firefly fries and other tapas. The place was very busy on a Friday night so different people helped with our service. We were seated next to the kitchen and can hear all the hustle and bustle."}
{"text":"A local favorite that has grown to be known by tourist as well. I absolutely love this place. I've tried just about everything on the menu and never been let down. There are some items I simply wouldn't order again but I have never had anything I didn't like. The food comes out very fast! The fresh mojitos and sangrias are also delicious, if you have a group get the pitcher. Only reason I graded a 4 is because of the new location. The old spot seemed more authentic or...idk just a different vibe to it."}
{"text":"We came here for brunch on our first day in town and got a seat at the bar. We tried a couple mojitos (which I wish were on the all you can drink option menu!) and my favorite was my blood orange one. I tried the white house sangria and it was a little tart for me. The bartender was great and gave us suggestions on his favorite dishes on the menu. We ended up ordering solely off the regular menu instead of getting brunch and got the tuna tartare, the shrimp in garlic butter sauce, chicken tinga empanadas, and the filet/shrimp/chorizo skewers. While we waited, they brought out bread and butter and the butter was so amazing I could have just made a meal of the bread and butter. My boyfriend's favorite dish was the tuna, but mine was the shrimp - so flavorful. The empanadas were really good and I would get them again. I wasn't as big of a fan of the skewers, some of the meat was a little tough and the sauce wasn't my favorite. I will definitely make this a stop on our next trip!"}
{"text":"The food itself was really good, definitely get the bacon wrapped dates and flan.  If you're really hungry/have a lot of people to split with, get the paella (it's $18 but there's a LOT of it).  I also had the manchego mac and cheese which was pretty amazing.  I also got a mango mojito, but I couldn't taste any mango.

My gripes about this place have to do with the service.  I saw my server three times total, but there was a really nice guy who kept coming around and taking care of me.  But when I asked him if our server split his tips, the guy was like \"sometimes\" so I ended up tipping him along with my server (who I didn't want to tip at all because he didn't do anything, but he just never came back with my change).  Also our server forgot to put in one of my orders (steamed mussels) but he made up for that with free \"birthday flan\" which is funny since it really was my birthday."}
{"text":"I love this place, every time I come to Vegas this is a must locals joint to visit. It's tapas style food, and almost everything on the menu is excellent. The sangria here is also excellent and a must-have."}

ALERT!! Firefly serves contaminated food. this is my experience there! dirty dirty . Health department has shut this location down due to Health reasons. Please if you ate here from Monday 4.22-4.25 and are experiencing sickness head to the clinic and report to the SNHDLV.com. There have been more than 20+ reported cases of food poisoning from Firefly on Paradise considering this a food outbreak just like the outbreak Jack in the Box had years ago! Do not tread with this lightly!!!"}
{"text":"Firefly is a great spot to go to with friends and family. I've been here numerous times, old and new spots. The new renovation is great and spacious with a private room, great for big dinners. 

I've tried numerous items on the menu from Apple and Manchego Salad, Garden Variety Salad, Ceviche of Shrimp, Tuna Tartare, Stuffed Dates, Tomato-Basil Soup, Veggie Empanadas, Firefly Fries, Ahi Tuna & Chicken Skewers, Banana Nutella Sandwiches, & Chocolate Tres Leches. 

Most of them were 10/10, besides the Veggie Empanadas. The cheese sauce drizzle didn't do it for it. I rather of had it dry. 

Firefly knows how to take care of their customers. They even set up a long table for a big party of 20 for us even though we were seated in the back corner separated. Special treatment to make their customers happy equals 5 stars in my book!"}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem in Las Vegas! Located at the end of the strip on the far side near the convention center, I had no idea this place existed until I was invited by friends. We showed up around the time of happy hour and I quickly saw the place fill up!

(There is valet which is complimentary aka tips only, so that's helpful when it becomes busy)

Our group decided to order a bunch of tapas, small appetizers, and share those as well as some pitchers of libations! 

I decided to stay with my go-to: red wine. However, I did have a taste of the sangria and it was delicious! 

My favorite tapas were the shrimp ceviche which was fresh and served with crunchy chips. Also, the parmesan fries were crisp and hot. The chicken skewers were tender and came with roasted veggies. 

I loved the ambiance as Firefly had in and outdoor seating and rooms for large parties like ours. My only caveat was that the servers weren't quite privy to large parties, it seemed. I should've brought cash so that I could check out quicker, like most in my group. But, I thought that most people these days used cards to pay. I ended up waiting over 30 minutes to get my check, give my card to the server, and then another 15+ to actually sign my check to leave."}
{"text":"We've been to this location multiple times. Last night we had good service and our food hit the table in record time! However, it also lacked a little bit of flavor and some of the sauces that we're normally accustomed to.

Quality control was lacking and that's the reason for 3 stars instead of our normal 4/5 star experience."}
{"text":"We took a party of 9 there last night and Firefly knocked it out of the park!!! Excellent service and the food was spot on. A couple of new things we tried were the warm spinach salad, excellent, and their desserts. The tres leches chocolate cake is phenomenal!"}
{"text":"Great experience the other night at the new location. Excellent food, drinks and service."}
{"text":"This was a phenomenal experience and my best dining experience in Vegas so far.  The food is prepared to heart and intention, and the dining staff made us feel at home.  Beautiful plates, every bite packed with flavor, and priced very well.  I am happy.  Firefly will make you happy too!"}
{"text":"I loved this place.  Great sangria, great atmosphere, great food.  I am very picky about food and service because well, I am in food and service.  Staff was helpful, even had to change my reservation too a later time because the first part of my night was not on schedule and they were accommodating.  Ham and cheese croquetas, Kobe beef sliders, and stuffed dates were amazing.  Great beet salad and just an al around good time.  They made my birthday fun, special, and not super expensive.  Amazing."}
{"text":"Not the best service or nicest staff, but the chicken salad was spectacular, the veggie paella great, and the potatoes with Chipotle sauce delicious. The Chicago roast beef sandwiches weren't good, and neither were the peppers stuffed with cheese, but I have a feeling once you know what to order from this place, it would be fantastic."}
{"text":"I can't really rate the food, but the way we were treated was terrible. We walked in tonight, understandably there would be a wait, since we did not make a reservation. The hostess said it would be 15-20 min for 3 people. Our party of 3 could handle that. About 45 min later, we saw plenty of people get taken back to be seated, we asked about how much longer they thought it would be, and she said oh umm you guys are next. She then proceeded to take another party to there seats. On that note, we decided to leave. Very disappointing as I am sure their food is tasty."}
{"text":"Get the dates!! The best tapa ever!
Don't get the scallops, they are probably frozen first and were really gross/fishy. I was afraid they were going to make my husband sick so he just put them to the side. 
I have been going to Firefly for ten years and it has remained an awesome hang out. This is a Vegas must! Just watch out for those scallops!"}
{"text":"Funky strip mall like location but great food. Got some free drinks, I was stoked. Great tapas to share, good for light eaters or to hold over a drunken hunger with out making you sick. Just say no to a buffet it will not be pretty, stick with FireFly for great tapas!"}
{"text":"The sangria is still the best in town. The albondigas, warm spinach salad and dates were superb! Service was fast and the staff was friendly. I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Went here with 3 friends for a night of tapas and sangria....It did not disappoint!

Everything we ordered was excellent and reasonably priced.  I tried red and white sangria and enjoyed both, but I have to say I liked the red better (probably just a personal preference.)  What makes this place special is that there is something for everyone from the carnivore to the vegetarian. 

I tried the anchovy dish cause a friend ordered it, and I was very pleasantly surprised.  Not fishy at all like I expected.  My favorite dish I tried was the Tuna Peppers.  I found that they used the a lot of the same ingredients in different dishes, so you could stick with one flavor profile, or you could totally mix it up.  There's a lot to choose from so I suggest that everyone at the table orders two dishes to start, then you take it from there.  

We saved room for dessert and ordered the sampler.  I'm glad we did, cause it had a little bit of everything.  Overall, its not a bad cab ride from the strip, and a great place to come with friends!"}
{"text":"We stopped by Firefly for some drinks and dessert after lunch. Our friend is a huge fan of Tres Leches cake and I read reviews of Firefly's being top notch. We were hanging out in the bar during football Sunday. Both of our friends ordered the Tres Leches and my wife had the Fly Tai cocktail. She liked the drink a lot and ordered a second. The Tres Leches was also delicious, so much that my wife ate about half of one of our friends before he realized it. Our other friend who is the tres leches fan said it was up at the top of his favorite tres leches cakes. 

Service in the bar was also excellent for us as the bartender was constantly refilling our drinks including my water before I could finish it. All of us would go back to try their food and also eat more desserts."}
{"text":"Awesome food. Took off a star for the service. Takes forever to get a table, to get a menu, to order food. Food came out soon enough, however some things were forgotten. Took forever to ask for a check."}
{"text":"Another good place in Vegas that is way off strip. Been to vegas a bunch lately and man the food is just overpriced and terrible on the strip. Been investigating a bunch of places like this, and Firefly gets the thumbs way up."}
{"text":"Been twice, and ready to go my next trip to Vegas. Great selection of small plates, Tapas, always crowded. Food comes fast. Great off the strip happening spot. Good prices.!"}
{"text":"I do like this restaurant, but I am not sure what the big hype is all about. 

The food is good but in my opinion the taste is not worth the price. There is just nothing about the flavor that makes this restaurant stand out. So either every time I have gone there I order the wrong things (doubtful) or there really is nothing that stands out about their food. I am from the Netherlands, which is not too far from Spain (where everyone always goes for vacation), and have had amazing Spanish food before that the food at Firefly's does not even come close to measuring up to. 

The only thing I have had that I would ever go back to eat that is completely worth it is their ribeye entree. Makes up for all the other dishes, like the flavorless paella. 

Other than that the restaurant is beautiful and upscale compared to the average restaurant. Perfect place to take a date for the second or third time (might be too expensive for the first if you are a poor university student like me) or to have a dinner celebration. The staff was wonderful. 

If you are just looking for a good eatery and aren't eating out for any special occasion, I probably wouldn't suggest this place."}
{"text":"Literally the best restaurant in Vegas- and that's saying something! 

Definitely try the sangria (especially during the happy hour specials). Anything you order of the menu is going to be amazing- I've seriously yet to be disappointed.

Protip: If you ever got the horrible \"reality\" show Gigolos on Showtime, the guys are always eating at Firefly. So, you know, eat where your favorite man whores go ;)"}
{"text":"The food was mediocre at best and the service was slow. We had to have a member of our party help the waitress separate the checks so we could get them right. Sangria was good. That was the only upside"}
{"text":"paid lots of money for ok tapas and burnt, dry shrimp on our paella. I also thought it was impossible to screw up a screwdriver but Firefly proved me wrong. Meh. Find something else to eat."}
{"text":"We ordered Mac n' cheese, empanadas and Serrano Sliders. ALL of it was amazing. Our service was top grade. Our waiter was extremely helpful and all smiles. The busboy was on top of everything. Drinks were re-filled even before they were empty, trash and plates were cleared in a matter of seconds. AMAZING place. I'd highly recommend it and would definitely make my way back again when I'm in town."}
{"text":"First ate at firefly when it was just a small restaurant tucked in the corner of a plaza, now look at it. Interior was nice, and had my boyfriend even saying he didn't feel like he was in Vegas when we ate there. Parking lot and valet was full when we arrived, but most were dancing out in the patio, and not eating inside so we were able to get a table instantly. 

Service was prompt, with waters and appetizer bread being brought out as I sat down. Boyfriend ordered the calamari and Shrimp with pepper and butter. I was crazy excited to break that yolk on top of the Huevos. 

Waters were continuously poured, food came out in a timely fashion, bread was gahhhmazing and service was good. Definitely try it!"}
{"text":"My go to spot with my girls on a chill night out or before partying.  Their sangria and paradise mojitos are good (get the pitchers so you all can share).  I would recommend: the firefly fries, camarones a la diabla, terra de mar."}
{"text":"Amazing tapas place. And I'm not really a tapas guy. But my fella told me that he'd had a great experience here in the past, and wanted to check it out again.

We stopped in and I was instantly enchanted by the aesthetic. Beautiful but understated. Liked it a lot. My dining companion ordered a bunch of things, and we sat back and waited on our drinks to arrive.

The sparkling sangria. Oh. My. God. I could have sat and had this all day, were I not driving. It was fruity, fresh, sweet, delicious. One of the best drinks I've ever had.

The tapas were a mixed bag, but I think that speaks more to my boy's tastes than to the quality of the food. The anchovies were (shocker) salty, the mussels were (shocker) a bit fishy. But everything else was delicious and I absolutely adored it all. 

I'll definitely return on my next trip to Vegas. No doubt about it. It was a highlight of the Vegas experience."}
{"text":"My first impression was, \"I'd be back in Vegas just for their bacon wrapped dates with toasted almonds and blue cheese.\"

Here's a second review of Firefly after being there just a week ago and trying some more tapas plates with my friends. We first ordered a pitcher of red Sangria for the table since it was happy hour (1/2 price on all drinks) and of course, what goes better with Spanish tapas than a nice glass of wine? Our table of four had plenty of wine to share for just $14.00. It came in a pretty tall pitcher, well chilled, and with chopped apples inside for presentation.

-Chorizo Clams (peppers, 2 kinds of spicy sausage, white wine, parmesan toasts) the bits of chorizo mixed with the sauce for a sweet and spicy combination was delicious.
-Steamed Mussles (red curry, white wine and coconut cream) the sauce which really becomes a soup is the feature of this dish. It was rich and flavorful and goes so well with the mussles!
-Stuffed Dates (bacon-wrapped, smoked almond, red wine reduction, blue cheese) must try must try must try. Too out of this world.
-Stuffed Peppers (Spanish piquillo peppers, fresh mozzarella, garlic cream cheese, tomato sauce) The combination was good and they got a lot of cheese in the dish, but the sauce wasn't too impressive. I'd say pass on this one and get more stuffed dates. But good if you love your tomatoes and cheese, pasta sauce taste.
-Mushroom Tart (puff pastry, boursin cheese) Simply good.

The lasting impression? \"Check out the photos, you'll be sold. It's a great place to go on a casual date or share a pitcher with little Spanish tapas and enjoy a good meal with a group of friends. It's a nice breather off the Strip in LV.\""}
{"text":"Firefly is located off the strip, cute trendy decor.
Prices were normal not crazy as you will see on the strip. I got a glass of red sangria ($8) it was very good. My husband and I got 4 small plates and it was enough food for dinner. Dates were amazing (very small portions) eggplant was good, tri meat skewers were good and which came with steak, shrimp, and chicken and stuffed mushrooms were
Average. This place doesn't knock your socks off but doesn't knock your wallet empty either! Our bill was around $35 without our drinks."}
{"text":"Great place for tapas, food is great and so is the service.  Came for a snack and left satisfied"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of tapas so I usually go to Firefly when I'm going to a concert at the Hard Rock. I've gone to the location downtown a few times now and actually think I like it there better. The service is slightly spottier downtown, but it's a cool room and it's great place to bring out-of-towners to get the whole old school Vegas experience.  Anyway, a couple months ago we went to the original location and I was really disappointed...the bread was drenched in oil and everything was super greasy. We gave it another shot last night and they were back on point. I guess someone was just heavy handed with the oil that one night.  My faves are the artichoke toasts, eggplant cannelloni, manchego mac & cheese and shrimp a la diabla. Firefly doesn't really do \"traditional\" Spanish tapas, but they do have a few interpretations of classics. I just like it because I can basically order 10 different things off the menu without seeming like a giant hog or breaking the bank."}
{"text":"I honestly thought I had done a review for Firefly, but I guess I hadn't, so here goes.

The food is very good, I can not think of a bad dish, we have our staples, the dates, the fries and then pretty much just shotgun the menu, order 4-5 other dishes depending on what our mood is.

If there could be one complaint, for some reason they seem to like the lighting set low and the music high...Ok combination for a club, not so good when you are trying to do something silly like, oh read a menu and tell the wait staff what you would like...."}
{"text":"There's a lot to like about Firefly, a bustling, noisy restaurant with lots of varied food options, served tapas-style and meant for sharing. If your idea of a good time is to bring a crowd and sample many different dishes over the course of several hours, then Firefly may be the place for you. Our party of twelve thoroughly enjoyed the experience and tasted just about everything on the menu, along with several pitchers of their excellent sangria.

An added bonus for vegetarians or those with gluten allergies, Firefly has a separate menu with their vegetarian options on one side and their GF options on the other. This came in handy when ordering for our group, and made it easy to have safe meals for everyone, no matter their dietary restrictions.

If you like sangria, be sure to try some. Both the white and the red are excellent, but I preferred the red. Nice and dry, not too sweet, and a fine accompaniment to the Spanish-style tapas. Also good - their mojitos! Available by the pitcher.

My favorite items were the bacon-wrapped stuffed dates, the Padron peppers (deceptively simple, but tasty), and the watermelon sorbet at the meal's close. The sorbet flavor changes daily.

Others at our table raved about the Tierra del Mar skewers and the lamb chops. The bread and almond butter disappeared quickly.

Basically, there's enough variation on the menu to find something for everyone. But that's a little bit of the problem too. The menu feels scattered and not as cohesive as it could be.

Service is professional and fairly efficient, but at times was hit or miss. This is expected with large groups and a busy restaurant, and we never had to wait too long for beverage refills. Plus, the staff wants you to have a good time. As an example, our first order of lamb came out overdone, but Firefly was able to get another going and on the second try the lamb chops were hailed as the standout meat dish of the evening.

One final note. Don't call this a Spanish restaurant if you have an actual person from Spain in your group. It was my colleague's first time in the USA, and he was appalled that Americans think Spaniards eat this way. Live and learn! (Although he did enjoy the food and the drinks. He just took issue with anyone saying it was Spanish.)"}
{"text":"[4 stars is my top rating...5 is for WOW, OMG!]

You can not go wrong with this place.  It's a fantastic place to take out of town guests and a GREAT place for a date.

If you want a bit quieter spot sit to the left of the main room near the bar.  Still a great view of Freemont but not a noisy as the glass room (Not as cool tho IMO)

Open menu and point to something you will love it!"}
{"text":"My favorite go-to place in Las Vegas. Right behind the strip. This place is a gem!! Tapas -- but great sizes and plenty of food options to keep you & your party full and happy. I normally order almost everything and I'm completely satisfied always. 
Mac and cheese
Tuna tartare 
Baked goat cheese
Ceviche
Mojito pitcher! -- affordable and delicious 
Green tea whiskey --- best shot of your life 
Mushroom tart 
French fries!! 
The cod
Patatas brava
Even the effing Flan was good
EVERYTHING!!

Eder was the best server. He went above and beyond with everything and made sure our party was A OKAY"}
{"text":"We went to Firefly for lunch on a Saturday and it was pretty dead, so maybe that's why everything seemed a little haphazard and sloppy. We ordered all tapas: seviche, mushroom tart, smoked salmon on toast, some kind of skewer with shrimp, sausage and tenderloin, bacon-wrapped dates, and the ham & manchego croquettes, with the banana/nutella sandwich for dessert. The only things I'd order again were the dates and the croquettes (both of which were delish). Although the seviche was very tasty, it was a bad call if you have a bit of a hangover. The dessert was good, but not amazing. The rest, though, were all subpar. Apparently we should have tried the macaroni and manchego and the Firefly fries. Overall, I was not impressed, though, as the visit certainly didn't measure up to the fine opinions of my fellow Yelpers. Must have been a bad day?"}
{"text":"Best mojitos and sangria in Las Vegas. Friendly and helpful staff. Food tastes great. Good happy hour specials on drinks (half off pitcher of Mojito is my favorite)."}
{"text":"Whenever I come to Vegas, I always look for good food. Unfortunately, a lot of the food in Vegas are over priced and honestly not worth it at the inflated prices. Fortunately, the food off strip are super affordable and really good. And more and more, I find myself going off the strip for good food. 

Our weekend Vegas trip was coming to an end and our group wanted some good food but not too much since some of us were still hungover from the night before. We concluded that tapas was a great choice since we can order a lot of them and it came in small portions. 

Another good thing about eating at these places off the strip is that they aren't full of tourists so there's no hour waits. When we got here during lunch time, we had no line, no nothing. We were immediately seated and started ordering. My friends ordered a pitcher of red sangria which was a cure all for those with a hangover. Overly ambitious, we started ordering the tapas. The price ranged from 6-10$ and the servings for each dish served for 2-3 people. We ordered everything from the shrimp ceviche, firefly fries, filet sliders, grilled octopus, steamed mussels, steak & mushroom skewers and the bacon wrapped dates. Everything was delicious! The shrimp ceviche had the right amount of acid and freshness and the shrimps weren't over cooked. The fries were great and the garlic aioli was PERFECT. And thanks to the other yelper's recommendation of the bacon wrapped dates, those were to die for. The only complaint that I actually had were the grilled octopus. They were kind of overcooked so they were a lot chewier than I would prefer them to be. 

Overall, the service of this place is great and the setting is perfect for a tapas bar. If you want good, affordable food (especially after a weekend of gambling), you should really check out this local's joint for some GOOD with no wait."}
{"text":"I've been driving by Firefly for a few years now, telling my wife:  \"We should really stop in there sometime.\"  Sometime finally came, and now I'm kicking myself for waiting so long to try this place.

It's a tapas place, so everything on the menu is a small portion, generally meant to be shared.  They all probably average around $6-9, with just a few topping the $10 mark.  Everything I tried was outstanding, and I'm looking forward to trying a bunch of new things next time.  

The restaurant itself was clean, new, and very tastefully decorated.  And the service was outstanding.  We were there maybe 45 minutes, and had no less than three people (including what I assumed was the manager) make sure everything was to our liking.  

What a great find."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Vegas! As a local, I tell everyone that visits about Firefly. The atmosphere is cool and a bit fancy. Prices good.
They have a big menu of cold and hot tapas. Some of my favorites are the stuffed dates, the pork empanada, the fries, the apple and manchego salad, and the baked goat cheese. The sangria is also amazing! Great place for a birthday celebration!"}
{"text":"Make reservations make reservations make reservations.  Then order a pitcher of sangria and order away.  Food is good and it's very busy.  Could be cozy and a great hang out with friends after a day of gambling."}
{"text":"The standard-bearer for tapas in Las Vegas, and one of my top spots to bring visitors, for good reason. I have never, ever had a bad dish here.

Bad service, on the other hand, used to be a hallmark of the Firefly on Paradise experience. I used to tell people that the way to deal with the crap service was to have enough mojitos at the bar that you don't notice how slow and forgetful the staff can be.

Fortunately, on my recent visits to Firefly they seem to have gotten their act together. I'm not sure if the restaurant's expansion into the old Dragonfly space took some of the pressure off, or what, but it's a much more dependable meal now.

Some of my favorite dishes on the menu here:

Ahi tuna tartare with avocado chunks, mango and taro chips - perfect blend of textures, sweet and savory. Delish.

Artichoke toasts, with red pepper and garlic aioli - simple, clean flavor.

Gazpacho - cool, refreshing, and light.

Mushroom tart - smothered puff pastry in boursin and mushroom caps - and I don't even like shrooms.

Serrano ham & manchego cheese plate.

Manchego mac & cheese. Baby shells smothered in bechamel and manchego - a great grown-up twist on a classic comfort food.

Ahi tuna skewer - mango, basil, and a mouth-watering mustard ginger glaze.

Chicken and tomato skewers - the garlic cream sauce is ridiculously rich so use it sparingly.

As for drinks - the mojitos are where it's at. Blueberry and blood orange are quality if you're looking to broaden your horizons from the original."}
{"text":"At the Firefly location on Paradise Road, I tell people that the beauty of the place is that it's so crowded that you have time to drink enough mojitos at the bar that you won't notice the spotty service during your meal.

Well, the downtown Firefly throws that out the window. Service here is consistent, and it's good. Wow. Another key difference: you can actually hear yourself think, and your dinner companions talk. It's a much better date option than the Paradise location.

Fortunately, the mojitos are still killer, and the food is the same collection of deliciousness that you've come to know and love at the original. Artichoke toasts are a light starter, garlic aioli a zesty counterpoint to the quartered artichoke heart atop it. Gazpacho is always refreshing and flavorful (although a warning: manipulating the slice of avocado in the soup can be difficult after a few drinks). 

And the filet mignon sliders, topped with Serrano ham, cabrales cheese and fried onions, are melt-in-your-mouth good. The tuna tartare was another great example of contrasts in play, with mango, avocado and taro complementing the fish.

Of course, you can't talk about the downtown Firefly without mentioning the view. The domed restaurant overlooks the Fremont Street Experience, a historic and stunning vista. But with the warm, bohemian-meets-bordello decor inside the restaurant, there's plenty to keep your eyes occupied even if you don't get one of the coveted window seats.

Firefly has long been one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas, and the downtown location improves on the original."}
{"text":"Delish!  This was a really fun place. We ordered the bacon-wrapped dates and they were wonderful, even though we were really unsure about them. We also order the empanadas, which I thought were pretty good, but my wife thought were excellent. Finally, the filet mignon was absolutely delicious. I loved it. 

We will be back again (if we ever go to Vegas again; not a big fan if Vegas)."}
{"text":"Life is all about second chances... So is dining. We gave The Fly on Paradise a second chance tonight due to the awesome management and there contact. 

We walked in and checked in for the 9 o'clock reservation and the hostess was very friendly and let us know that it would be about 5 minutes before our table was ready... \" No Problem\" 1 star to Firefly.
Once we had been sat the waiter was at our table and taking our drink order and asking if  we wanted to get some food started.  We decided to start out with a drink and 4 of the Tapas.  Now, I am not kidding... I had pulled out my phone, unlocked it, logged onto yelp and then the food was at our table. AS fast as we could eat it they were bringing it. 

We made a few more orders and all the food was amazing, perfectly cooked and seasoned. The Drinks were all perfectly concocted and the waiter who i wish i could remember his name because I would definitely like to give a shout out to him. He was all over the service... Can you say \"TOP NOTCH\".

Firefly Paradise, you are back on the top of the list. Lets recap this one time. Why is firefly back on the top? Excellent service turnaround, Amazing food, Great atmosphere..

This location is great and definitely up to par."}
{"text":"This all started with a mere whim of curiosity, a year or so ago in Reno at Silver Peak my cousin ordered a Sangria, which looked amazing. I always told myself that i would find a great place to enjoy the fruity refreshment .

So last week I reached out to my fellow Yelpers here in Vegas and the response was Awesome. After reading over all of the reviews Firefly had an overwhelming lead when it came to the Positive feedback. 
So Friday night we find ourselves heading downtown to check it out. 
Now i am not going to sugar coat it and say that this place was coated in gold dust and was crazy appealing from the outside, because that is not the case. We pulled into the Plaza hotels Parking garage and headed in. 

Once in the hotel I was a little unsure if my fellow Yelpers pointed me in the right direction. Once we made the walk to the Firefly escalator and got upstairs it was an entirely different vibe. I felt like I could mellow out and have a good time. We asked to be seated in the bar for the happy hour which i was not sure we would receive since it was a matter of minutes until it over. The very approachable young lady at the desk sat us and it was a few minutes before we received any service; This is when it got good.. Our table wobbled quite a bit and i am not the type to complain so I was just going to deal with it, before my mind could even process that i was going to just make it work, a guy came out of nowhere and said excuse me while i fix your wobbly table. \"1 point Firefly\". Then our Waiter comes to the table and apologizes for the wait and explains that it was due to him talking to the manager to get us happy hour pricing since we just missed it. BINGO..\"2 more points firefly.\" We ordered a pitcher of the red Sangria and a pitcher of the blood orange mojito... and well.......2 more points to Firefly.. We then began the feast of Tapas... the calamari was awesome, the fillet Mignon sliders \"WOW\". we tried as much as we could get down, and last but definitely not least we tried the Bacon Wrapped Dates.. Everyone was spot on, these were one of the best things ordered for the night.

So to finish this up. The service was excellent and friendly, the view down Fremont street was awesome, the atmosphere is hip and nostalgic at the same time and the food and drink is not lacking. I will be back here for sure. And I recommend it to everyone!"}
{"text":"Every time I am in Vegas, we wind up here....which is such a good thing.  It is more of a townie place, not trashy though, it just gets you away from he annoyance of the strip.  
The mjoitos are scrumdiddly.  And it is hard to say what is the best dish to have here, there are so many.  Something as simple as the Parmesan fries with aioli are amazing.  Any of the skewers are awesome!  Stuffed dates, yeah!
The room is usually filled with hotties too!"}
{"text":"Amazing yummy appetizers..
Make sure to order Bacon wrapped dates.
The lamp chops and steak were also very tasty.
I don't remember the other stuff unfortunately.
Our waiter was very nice."}
{"text":"Went for early dinner at Firefly yesterday and got phenomenal service by server Alejandro and mgr J. Eduardo. Tried all 3 sangrias and we decided the winner was the sparkling version (least sweet of the 3), although they're all above average, esp. the white. Scallop escargot was voted #1 of the 7 tapas we tried. I liked the bacon wrapped dates, but my husband liked the stuffed mushrooms better. Tierra Mar skewers were also fantastic. Bottom of the list was the mac 'n cheese which I thought was a little salty. Chocolate bread pudding w/ cherry, recommended by Alejandro, was also outstanding. Overall, a great night out w/ super service."}
{"text":"What a fun little place to visit with your friends for a few hours in the evening!  On Fridays it is hopping with clientele ranging from the casually dressed to the dressed-to-the-nines.  The sangria is good and I had a tasty mojito the last time I was there. The tapas are delicious and service is generally good-  I have no complaints about Firefly and would love to come back.  The one complaint I do have is not about Firefly but about the parking- be prepared to drive around in circles for a bit if you want to park in the too-small private parking lot serving the plaza."}
{"text":"I'd say forget those all you can eat buffets, dinner reservations, $$$ piece meals in Strip, for a day and try this restaurant off the strip. This place is a few blocks away tucked in a small strip mall away from the crowd. Yet, this place might surprise you with the same charm it has got to offer for a modest price. 
This place had good options for vegetarians; service was great so was the food. 

We tried the Stuffed Dates, Mushroom Tart, Stuffed Peppers, Fries. All items were well done, not too greasy as you might expect but tbh, i didnt really understand why fries were such a winner here as yelp says. They were okay. But we really enjoyed the other items and Sangria was the winner among drinks."}
{"text":"Superb, wonderful, magnificent. Yes this is as good ad it gets. Not in any way shape or form is it pretentious or snooty. Went for breakfast slash lunch and ate more than I should have. You get a bunch of small plates ( me and the wife) we ordered calamari, steak & mushrooms, lamb sausage ( only dish not worth it to me) but everything was first class the service was superb. Be back yeah for sure."}
{"text":"I don't know where to start on this place. Every time I go to Vegas I have to eat here once. Happy hour is amazing! 
 
MUST HAVES: chorizo stuffed mushrooms, bacon wrapped dates, sliders and the 3 day marinated sangrias.

I recommend making reservations on thurs-sat nights it gets packed!!"}
{"text":"I and company dropped in here for a quick bite to eat after arriving in Vegas.

The aforementioned \"company\" ordered weird non meat dishes. Ugh. I cannot comment on what they had, as I ignore things that don't include dead animals in them.

I can, however, speak for the Thai Beef Salad with dead cow and the Filet Mignon Sliders with more dead cow.

Mmmmmmm...animals.

Ok, ok, I'm just giving my vegan hosts a bad time. Firefly is totes vegan friendly and also caters to us uncouth carnivores. The best of both worlds.

The Thai Beef Salad was super delicious. Huge slices of meat come with this salad; this is no dinky portion at all. The flavors were fresh and lively and the beef was served at the perfect temperature to compliment an Asian flavored salad. When I have a tête-à-tête with my beef I really find appropriate meat temperature an important feature of the relationship. 

However, after the Thai salad the sliders left me a bit on the outs. A good size...but holy cow (literally) the meat was SO SALTY!!! Like, somebody had a salt seizure up in that kitchen. Simma down now with the salt on the filet. We aren't aboard The Mayflower, there is no need to salt meat so severely that it will not spoil after a 6 month trip across the Atlantic ocean. I mean, this is filet mignon, COME ON!!! Minus 2 stars for dead animal abuse.

Also, the Gin & Tonic could have been a little less short on the poor.

But that salad, yum!"}
{"text":"Great Small plates. Stuffed peppers are awesome. A little loud on atmosphere, maybe it's just a busy night. The food is awesome though"}
{"text":"Disappointed from the last time I came here... first of all, it's my gf's bday and the server had a bad attitude from the start. He didn't introduce himself, my girl asked the server on recommendations on the alcohol drinks; he just named what drinks they carried. Not exactly the answer she was asking for... anywhom. I found out the name of the server, Ivan... at least that's what the busser told me. Food was brilliant. Thank you to the back of house..."}
{"text":"Awesome happy hour! The mojitos are always amazing and the atmosphere is awesome, one of myself and my friends favorite places."}
{"text":"I decided to celebrate my 23rd (yay mee!) in Sin City again-- but this time we decided to be smart and look up places apres-arrival! Thank god we did because we absolutely loved Firefly on Paradise!

The atmosphere was great, mango mojito was yummy and strong enough and food was delicious! Our favorites were the shrimp ceviche, thai beef salad and the fillet+shrimp+sausage (forgot the name!). The ahi skewers were a bit over cooked and the duck rolls were dry but over all the food was wonderful!

Probably wouldn't be back anytime soon just because there are so many places in Vegas to try! But definitely recommending it for anyone looking for a place that is moderately priced, close to the strip and yummmmy!"}
{"text":"Amazing tapas place! If we were to eat this on the strip we would probably expect to pay twice the price and felt it was well worth it. Definitely worth the drive."}
{"text":"Was in Vegas to celebrate my friend's graduation.  We were highly recommended this restaurant, so my husband and I thought we would give it a try.  

The place was busy on the Friday night we went.  We had to wait about 30 minutes to be seated indoors.  The ambiance was fabulous.  We ordered several small plates because we wanted to try everything.  While we were waiting for our food, they brought us this appetizer with olives, bread, and an almond spread.  It was very good!  We also ordered a sangria, which was delicious.  Our waiter was fabulous, always checking in on us and making sure our drinks were always filled.  She also timed our food just right, so our plates came out in groups, and we didn't have too much on the table at one time.  

Definitely well worth the 30 minute wait.  We loved the food so much that our friends ending up coming too because we talked so highly of the place.  They also had a great experience. Will definitely come back when we are in town again!"}
{"text":"I heard about Firefly from the Food Network and boy was eating here worth it! We had several tapas and they were all delicious! Especially the stuffed dates....YUM! My 7 year old grandson couldn't get enough of the dates, and also really enjoyed the BBQ Baby Back Ribs with Mango BBQ sauce! We will definitely eat here when in Vegas again and it should be on everyone's must try list!"}
{"text":"I know Firefly has a bad wrap ever since one of their other locations closed for food poisoning. But this location is so amazing I can't seem to keep away! Besides, I keep telling myself it has got to be one of the cleanest places to eat now, right?? ... Don't answer that. I'm happy in my ignorance!

For starters, they have an AMZING patio with shades, misters, soft seating and even a fireplace! It's great for all seasons. The service here isn't anything to rave about, but I can't complain either. I've been here multiple times and may occasionally wait for bread, but only when it is in the oven.

I'm a big fan of Tapas because I love small bites ad love to try different things. Only once have I ventured off the Tapas menu for a lunch special (soup and sandwich I think) and I didn't really care for it.

My favorite menu items are: the Bacon wrapped dates (order one order for every person, trust me!), the Manchego Mac and Cheese, the Tuna Tar Tar (salivating thinking about it - ask for extra chips), and absolutely hands down, the Filet Mignon - it's only $10 and well worth it!!!

They don't ave apply hour on food here but do have specials on their pitchers of Mojitos and Sangria. All in all it's reasonably priced. Ignore the poor reviews and come check them out!!"}
{"text":"The food was very good, although I'm not sure you'd find \"sliders\" at a tapas bar in Spain. But, you know what, the sliders were good. So, \"Yay, I'm a fan.\" Make sure you order a pitcher or Sangria. Be prepared for a wait. We saw people waiting outside for about an hour."}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times and enjoyed myself for the most part on each occasion.  The positives: Food is good, prices aren't bad, and customer service is solid.  The negatives: There always seems to be a wait, the place is really cramped, and Firefly does have a tendency to get ridiculously loud, which takes away from the ambiance."}
{"text":"Solid 3.5 stars.  

We hadn't dined at a Firefly in at least a couple of years so what the heck.  I actually prefer the atmosphere of this one over Paradise.  High ceilings, less cramped and more parking space.  

The menu hasn't changed much from what I remember but I did notice a couple of things like the lobster corn dogs and lobster \"escargot style\" so we got those at $10 a plate.  The corn dogs were the only disappointing dish of the night.  The breading was not good and it was kinda soggy.  The escargot lobster was tasty.  I suppose anything cooked escargot style would be.  

Aside from the usuals like bacon wrapped dates, empanadas (pork is better than the vegetarian) and sliders, we went with our waiter's one suggestion of the warm spinach salad.  Glad we did that!  Who knew warm wilted spinach with pine nuts, roasted peppers and artichoke would be so good??  I think whatever dressing they had going on knocked it out of the park.  The sangria packed a nice punch as well.  I would be fine coming back to this location."}
{"text":"Those damn dates wrapped in bacon....the overpriced empanadas I still can't enough of....the pitchers of mojitos where the 3rd one manages to taste better than the 1st.  I really enjoy this place.  Great for groups and I like the food goddamit!"}
{"text":"Everything about this face is fantastic!  As if you wouldn't be able to tell by the overtaken parking space and the long wait as you enter.  Every dish I have ever tried has been thoroughly enjoyable and their sangria is to DIE for!  Great place to go with friends to share multiple tapas and a pitcher of sangria.

Not only is their food and service impeccable, but the ambience is as well.  With a spanish flair mixed with modern lounge seating, anyone could see why this is such a hot-spot for first dates, mingling, or even late-night get togethers with friends.  Definitely a go-to place for any and all get togethers with out of town friends."}
{"text":"Jessie and Eduardo's service was phenomenal. Came here with 11 people (late night as we work in the industry) and honestly we had a great time. They gave us a round of shots on the house. We have been laughing, eating, drink and having an excellent time. This is my second night coming in a row and I am truly happy to have found this place, especially considering they are open late night."}
{"text":"LOVE this place. LOVE. 

In the last 3 years, I've been to Vegas at lease 12 times. No joke.  So how (HOW?!) is it possible that I've JUST had the pleasure of dining at Firefly? Shame on me, shame on me. 

Came here for dinner around 6:30 on a Saturday night and we were seated right away (score!).  

We ordered a handful of dishes and each dish left our table clean.  Not so much as a kernal of rice.  Everything was so amazing!

The order:
Stuffed Dates: Ummm...HEAVEN. MUST ORDER.  Dates stuffed with walnuts, wrapped with bacon and topped with crumbled cheese. No, it doesn't get any better. 

Camarones Al Aljillo: Garlic Butter shrimp.  Large shrimps drowned in decadent butter garlic sauce with toast for dipping. Need I tell you how delicious this was?

Crispy Duck Roll: Super tasty--like pecking duck or eggrolls?  You'll love this. 

Chicken Skewers: Really good, but nothing special. 

Tuna Tartar: Sooooooooooooooo good!  

Seafood Paella: Loaded with seafood! SUPER good...wonderfully seasoned. 

One of my favorite places in Vegas.  Will definitely be back and I'd certainly recommend it to anyone and everyone.  

Flan: Delicious! 

Banana sandwiches with nutella: Ummm...this dish didn't even last a minute.  We devoured it.  We drank all the nutella sauce.  It's that good."}
{"text":"Excellent food, nice casual environment on the patio (we came during the day, I can't speak for what it's like at night!), friendly service...this is a definite stop if you want a casual dining experience! 

We ordered the mac and cheese...seriously, the best I've had! The calamari was super yummy, the garlic aioli fries were amazing, and the chicken skewers were super tasty! Even the free bread that comes before the meal was delicious, it was like soft but flaky garlic bread with a really good sweet butter!"}
{"text":"I have been to this place for dinner dates, as well as for a large group party. Both times I was not very please with the loudness, or slow service.  However, the duck tapas is delicious when it isn't super greasy, and the passion fruit mojito is the best one, probably the only reason I went back there twice.  I would not reccomend this place unless someone loves tapas food since there aren't many, but I do not think this place deserves four or five stars."}
{"text":"This place is pretty much amazing and you need to get here when it's not busy or you'll be waiting in line like you would be at a club but everyone is there for table service. Service is amazing and cups of water are never empty.

This is what we ordered:
1) stuffed dates - bacon-wrapped, smoked almond, red wine reduction, blue cheese
2) firefly fries - parmesan, herbs, aioli
3) veggie empanada - spinach, mushroom, artichoke, herbed cream cheese in pastry, red pepper aioli
4) filet mignon sliders - mini burgers w/serrano ham, cabrales cheese, caramelized onions
5) crispy duck roll - cherry hoisin sauce
6) fried calamari - spicy gribiche dipping sauce

I would recommend all these things except the crispy duck roll. It just was not good--dry and bland. I wanted to try the Sangria but I was driving back home that day so I didn't intake any EtOH. It looked tasty though.

Firefly serves some of the best tapas in my opinion. Definitely a place that's worth a 4 or 5-people cab ride since it's off the strip."}
{"text":"Something going on with Yelp review situation and this restaurant.  We got snowed by it.  Don't let it happen to you.  Normally this rating at 1100+ reviews says astonishing awesome.  This place is just...fine.

We went with 7 ppl and ordered a bunch of tapas.  The menu and descriptions are amazing.  

First, food was delivered entirely in a span of 5 minutes.  It was like a race from the kitchen.  It was overwhelming, and we felt like it was a race to eat, b/c salads came with hot tapas...all tapas were served on dinner plates so there was very little room to even accommodate the food.  Zero sensitivity from staff in making this work.  Felt like fast food service. Yuck.

Second, food is average...at best.  Spicy beef salad is one of my favorite dishes.  Beef was overcooked and leathery and the salad had iceberg lettuce with zero flavor, no spice...bizarre actually.  Fries should have been great but were mushy and underdone.  Apple and manchego salad -- a real winner from Jaleo in DC fame--was just that...no zing from garlic or anything acidic to add punch.  There were some winners.  Stuffed eggplant and meatballs were good.  Sauce for beef skewers was good.  

So, go here if you want a decent dinner.  Do not go here thinking you're getting a great dinner.  Food quality is average at best  Preparation completely uneven.  Service is like a high school cafeteria.

This will be my last visit.  I was at the LV Strip adjacent location."}
{"text":"It was okay at best. Very busy as it was a Friday evening. Food was okay, nothing that I ordered was rememberable."}
{"text":"Husband and I went here before the Rat Pack show at the hotel.  It was ok, but didn't really live up to the hype of enthusiasm that I read here.

Pros:  
The glass bubble view
Red Sangria
the bacon wrapped dates (my favorite, but my husband was not a fan)
the Terra y Mare skewers

Cons:
Food took a very long time to prepare (might have been a service issue, not sure)
Too expensive for such small plates
The fillet sliders were horrendous
Mac and Cheese was a little too rich
Ham and cheese croquetas was made with way too much cheese and barely any ham

This is probably a place I'd go with a group but I doubt my husband and I together would go back again."}
{"text":"4.5 stars

Don't judge a book by its cover. Or, in this case, don't judge a fantastic restaurant by that fact that you have to go through the scruffy Plaza to get there. (Pay $5 to park in the Plaza's concrete funhouse of a garage, get your $5 refunded at the cashier's cage, blow your $5 on a slot machine.)

Design: Moody pictures of flamenco dancers in the entry. The glassed-in dome overlooks Fremont Street. Go after dark so you can enjoy the spectacle while pretending to mock it. Try to reserve one of the circular booths overlooking the street for maximum sex appeal. Although it's plenty sexy without one, and there were groups as well as couples.

Service: Pleasant, professional, not cloying. No handholding: Tapas will not be explained to you unless you ask.

Food: Ok, if you've gotten this far. You deserve a reward, so let's get those salivary glands going. Husband and I had six small plates, and we were so full we could not order dessert. 
Stuffed dates. Exquisite, bite-size nibbles. And nutritious, involving 3 of the 4 food groups!
Artichoke toasts: Sour, in a good way.
Manchego mac n cheese: Both creamy and snappy, but without the wow factor of the other choices.
Albondigas: Tasty little meatballs.
Fish sticks: Yay for spicy tartar sauce and golden, panko-shrouded goodness
Duck rolls: Big and awkward to eat, and not as flavorful as duck ought to be. Ate my half anyway.
Cava was lovely, and husband's mojito was A-1.

And how much did this little feast come to? Fifty bucks before tip. I was in shock. This was one of the best meals we had in Vegas and the cheapest."}
{"text":"When I am in Vegas this is my go to always.  Service is great, food is great, drinks are great.  Menu is very diverse enough to please everyone.  Can not go wrong here!"}
{"text":"Love coming here for their Latin Tuesdays. Food is good and even after kitchen closes they have the taco bar open. The music is great and I love dancing here to release some midweek tension! They play salsa, bachata, merengue, regae, and a bit of everything else.
We've had several birthdays held here too. Staff is very friendly and helpful. 
Will keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Would've never traveled this far to go to this location (I go to the one on the west side often) if it wasn't for latin nights on Friday nights. Just like the other location the sangria is good, service is friendly and although this place is bigger than the Sahara location there's still a lack of space to move around.

They have a large patio which I can see could be nice to dine on if the weather is  nice but the problem is that Vegas usually has very extreme weather, either too hot or too cold and appropriate weather days are far and few between. Latin nights would have been so much nicer if there were misters on the patio at least or if they held the event indoors. Everyone was complaining about the heat ALL NIGHT and most people had to dance one song and sit out for five to \"cool off\" in the 100 degree temperature. Heat + Sangria + sweating due to dancing = super dehydration and hang over and feeling that I shouldn't go out Friday nights ever again lol 

Also I didn't know that there's an automatic 18% gratuity on drinks for a reservation. Not that we weren't going to tip but that was just a tad odd. I thought that was just for food. Just FYI so you won't be caught off guard! 

And yes after all that complaining I still give them four stars bc I think under the right conditions this could be an amazing venue."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, even better food!

The scene: Loud and busy Sunday night for dinner. 

The Staff: Courteous and knowledgeable.

The Small Plates: Divine.

From the outside the place looks a little corporate with neon signage, however the food is not. Our dinner consisted of a giant pitcher of red sangria, stuffed dates, eggplant cannelloni, meat skewers (can't remember exact name), roasted pear and beet salad. 

Everything was delightful. Easy bite has great depth and flavor, and was made with love.

Desserts we had were the mini passion fruit cheesecakes, and the cherry/chocolate bread pudding. Both we above average.

I suggest making a reservation in advance, it is well worth it.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to grab dinner in my hometown. Nothing can touch it. I have had everything on the menu and never had any serious complaints. The atmosphere is awesome. Firefly has a Latin lounge feel and is full of vibrant people 

Just to confirm the other Yelpers cries, YOU MUST EAT the bacon-wrapped dates. They are delicious. 

Prices are reasonable and I always make sure to grab at least one pitcher of their amazing red sangria. It blows any others away. I am always in search of better sangria and I found Firefly's only competition in Barcelona -- It's that good.

This is a perfect venue for a first date. 
Bad time: Call it at after a couple plates 
Great time: Keep the pitchers coming, make sure to finish it off with Tres Leche Cake. Perfect end to a perfect night."}
{"text":"I brought my friend from LA here because I've been hearing awesome reviews about this place.

We came for lunch and sat in the the couches. We ordered about 6 different tapa dishes. It was decent.

I think this restaurant would probably be better in the night time. So I would go here again, and maybe try out their sangrias, too!"}
{"text":"The best place ever, food is fantastic, atmosphere is great, The bartender Omar super star! Thank u:)"}
{"text":"We had a party of 9 on a Wednesday.  Food overall was great.  Service was great.  We managed to make it for happy hour (1/2 off drinks) so $3.50 mojitos were a fantastic way to get the group going. 

Some of the favorites were the spicy shrimp, mushroom tart (not really a tart) and the Tuna tartare.  Overall a great dining experience with solid food at reasonable prices.  The lighting is undoubtedly part of the desired ambiance but some found it hard to read the menu."}
{"text":"Firefly is an excellent choice as they have a variety of dishes to choose from and they are fast at serving!  There is something for everyone's taste. Love going with a group of my friends when here on business!"}
{"text":"I've been to this location once, the location on the west side of town, and the one they closed down the street from this one. I'm not sure what happened, their service used to be top notch at the closed location. The placing of the tables in this new location are awkwardly away from everyone, so much so you seem so far from everything (especially your server). The atmosphere is red dim light and art all over but you can't really appreciate it since it's too dark to be able to tell what things are, or the color of food on your plate. I always get the sangria pitcher, which is my favorite. Red or white, both good. Dates wrapped in bacon with blue cheese is still a favorite of mine. The salmon toast aren't that good in my opinion. The rest of the menu of good too. Depends on what you like more, sweet or salty. I haven't been back here and probably won't be for a while. However, I'm hoping my next visit reminds me why I used to go here so often."}
{"text":"We just visited LV for my birthday and had to try this place. The reviews are right on the money... great unique dishes, fast service, and fun vibe. Very busy, yet they moved things around to seat us. We ordered a lot of food (Spicy beef salad was one of my favorites) and we were pleased with every thing...my 5 years old son love the mac n' cheese even with the sun dried tomoatoes. The large bill was worth the price- we had to get the desert too!

**Sangria was awesome, and my kids loved the bread!!

We can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Just order these and you'll be set!

Must-haves:
Pitcher of white sangria (easily 4 full glasses, maybe 5-6 since there's a lot of ice as a filler. But still a better deal than ordering by the glass.)
Stuffed Dates (Order two! Since it comes with only 5, you will be fighting over who gets the last one! Trust me.)
Filet Mignon sliders (Expensive for two small sliders, but soo worth it. You'll love the fried struggle onions so much, you can eat it alone.)
Empanadas (Comes in two. Order as much as needed.)
Mac & Cheese (Filling and comforting before a night of drinking on the town.)

You'll get almond butter with garlic bread & olives on the house. The almond butter alone is a ball of butter goodness!"}
{"text":"Definitely a cool place to have great food and chill with some nice, yummy mojitos! My friends and I ordered a vast array of food: Firefly Fries (fries with parmesan, herbs, aioli), Empanada (pastry stuffed w/roast pork, red pepper, w/salad, aioli), Terra y Mare skewers (grilled shrimp, filet mignon, chorizo sausage, salsa verde), and the Paella (saffron rice, clams, shrimp, calamari, chicken, Spanish chorizo sausage). There were only two empanadas, and the Terra y Mare had three skewers. The paella was alright, one of the better ones, since it wasn't so SALTY (like real Spanish food!). The fries were also really tasty with the lightly shredded parmesan.

For drinks, you have to try their mojitos! I am a huge mojito fan, and the way they make it is so delicious! I had their mango mojito! YUM! It tasted like juice with a little kick of alcohol, and maybe a slight \"sparkle\" feel to it. I also tried a sip of the Raspberry mojito, and it was just as good! SO REFRESHING!

For dessert, we ordered the Trio of Gelato (fresh-made toasted almond, chocolate, vanilla ice creams). YUM! The chocolate had this cocoa taste to it, and for some reason the vanilla tasted like condensed milk (Maybe when the ice creams just melted and mixed together it had that texture!) I loved how they added the ladyfinger in it too! It so complemented the chocolate ice cream! YUMMMMMM!

The service was excellent. The waiter never rushed us, and always asked how things were.

A great place to just relax with some buddies for a little chit chat..."}
{"text":"The Tapas are really a great size, the ambience is very chill and they have music going all night long. Great place to go and have drinks with shareable plates. Extra plus that they are open until 2am for food. I had the Mac and cheese and it was really cheesy and good."}
{"text":"Newbie to vegas scene with love for tapas.
Was yearning to find a great tapa joint, not too far away with a relaxing environment. This place was it!
Good sangria like everyone had mentioned.
Only tried the Red, but it was great. 
Ordered various dishes....
Can't name specific dish that I loved the most, but everything was pretty good. It was 5 of us and the tab came out to be around 30$ pp including 2 pitchers of sangria + tip. We were all stuffed from tapas...
good times. Comfy lounge chairs I prefer over table seating. Will go back with who ever is down for some tapas."}
{"text":"I forgot to write a review for this fabulous restaurant, shame on me! I was here for a Bachelorette party and really enjoyed the food. 

Firefly has a massive tapas menu. There's something for everyone. The stuffed dates were really wonderful, just would have done without the blue cheese. The calamari wasn't greasy at all. We had some sort of an awesome manchego cheese dip. We had a couple other items (fish/shrimp?) but I can't remember which. All in all great quality food and service, this would make a great date spot!

The white sangria pitcher was a great price, but not as good as the sangria I make of course ;)  And to finish the chocolate tres leches cake was to die for. Just the right amount of chocolate without being too rich or sweet. Very refreshing."}
{"text":"This is truly a 5-star experience for those of you who are (like me) out-of-towners with very Vegas-specific criteria, such as:

(1) Organizing a large group dinner - I did two separate bachelorette party dinners here (groups of 8 and 14), both on Saturday nights. (Note: They do not take reservations at this location for less than 10 but our group of 8 got seated pretty quickly in the bar area when we got there around 7:30pm.)

(2) On a tight budget but still want really good food - Both times, we stuffed ourselves and still managed to spend less than $25/person on food (about $30/person if you include drinks), inclusive of tax/tip. I am a foodie and so were a lot of the other girls, and everyone absolutely loved this place because the food is such a great value.

(3) Fun vibe - It's pretty casual here and it was divier than I expected, but I liked it. It's popular with locals, but not the type that make you feel lame for being all dressed up for a bachelorette party. (All the workers at the Trump, where we were staying, and our cab drivers, kept telling us \"great pick!\" when we told them where we were going.)

(3) Excellent, extremely accommodating service -  For my dinner for 14, they asked me sign a contract to guarantee at least $35/person (not including tax/tip), but did not require a credit card. We ordered as much food and drinks as we could but couldn't hit the $35/person mark before tax/tip, but they were okay with that because they could tell we weren't trying to to be cheap. Also, our server was awesome and helped me keep track of my costs so I wouldn't go over budget. He'd literally say \"You just ordered a mojito pitcher. You are now at $253.53\". He also gave great recommendations for how many of each item to order.

(4) Delicious drinks - The sangria is some of the best I've ever had, and the mojito pitchers are excellent as well.

(5) Don't mind a short cab ride off the strip - It's worth it if you're budget-conscious, trust me. It was only $15/cab, about 10 minutes from the Wynn side of the strip. It is a little hard to get a cab back, but the restaurant will call you one; or, just walk over to the steakhouse next door and grab one that's dropping someone off. 

(6) Relatively quick meal so you can hit the club early and not have to wait in a long-ass line -- The food comes fast, just perfect for an 8 or 8:30pm reservation so by the time you're done and head back to the strip, you have time to do last-minute touch-ups in the hotel bathroom before you hit the clubs.

P.S. I also looked at the downtown location, but a few friends that have gone said the ambiance is not as good.

P.P.S. What to order - everything was delicious and easily shared; I esp. loved the bacon wrapped dates, meat skewers, paella, croquettes . . . like I said, everything! And don't forget to take a doggy-bag for leftovers -- they keep well, esp. at 5am after a night out clubbing ;)"}
{"text":"I have gone to this place for Happy Hour for years. It is definitely my favorite place to hang out after work with friends. I always have the sangria. I haven't found any better in Vegas. The tapas are delectable. I always order the empanadas, stuffed dates, tortillas, and the patatas bravas. If I'm with a seafood fan, I also get the calamari. I've had the paella as an entree and it was quite tasty as well. You can't go wrong at Firefly."}
{"text":"(actually 3 1/2 stars as I don't think you really get your money's worth here compared to some of the other restaurants I have given 4 stars to.) So I have been waiting to try this place over the year since I moved here but my wife always said NO I DON'T LIKE SPANISH FOOD.  So the other day she goes out with friends and ends up at the Firefly on Paradise.  Lo and behold she comes home raving and admitting I was right and we should have tried it long ago.  So a few days later she finally lets me go to try it.  Other reviewers raved about the bread but we were not offered any.  We loved the bacon wrapped figs (even my daughter loved it to my surprise.).  The crab claw corndogs were good and I did love the spicy mustard dipping sauce.  We enjoyed the mushroom tarts, the steak and mushroom skewers.  The crispy duck spring rolls were excellent.  My daughter liked the empanada.  On the negative, I would stay away from the big bowl of pasta.  With shrimp it cost $22.00 and to behonest, I have had microwave meals that tasted better.  THe sauce is good but watery and the angel hair was way over cooked.  Also, it wasn't $22.00 worth of pasta and shrimp.    Although you could probably control yourself and eat much cheaper than we did, if you aren't careful the price can add up quickly as the plates are small.  The sangria is excellent and the Paella looks great, I think we will try that next time.  The service was good as the waiters and hostesses were friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"I went here with friends while we were in Vegas for a couple days.  I'll be back  anytime I'm in Vegas again.  The goat-cheese stuffed, almond-filled, bacon-wrapped dates in a red wine reduction are AMAZEBALLS.  Seriously.  A-MAZE-BALLS. Bacon is meat candy, right?  And these are like the See's Candy of bacon dishes.  I've decided I want a pan of these instead of birthday cake.

The chicken & mushroom paella was delish, too, but next time, I'd probably just stick with an assortment of the tapas because they were so great and outshone the paella (not to belittle the paella).  The ham & cheese croquetas, yummy.  The roasted eggplant canneloni, tasty.  The only dish that we didn't love was the grilled scallops, which, with pureed saffron potatoes, seemed like a good idea, but just didn't really mesh with the rest of the meal.  The service was excellent, especially for how busy the place was.

I highly recommend it! The food was an experience and a memorable one."}
{"text":"We gave this place a try after reading a few reviews on Yelp. The place was packed mid week!  We go seated in about 20 minutes which seemed fair for a full restaurant. Our the service was quick and helpful with the menu selections. The almond stuffed dates are awesome! The sangria was pretty good too!  A definite must when we come back to Vegas."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere, love the food. The restaurant is dark and uses dim lights and candlelight to give the perfect setting for a great evening. Rich red colors are used throughout the restaurant reminds me a little of DCR. I went with a friend and we started off with the Firefly fries which are really good. We also ordered lamb chops, ahi tuna skewers, filet minon sliders, garlic shrimp, and several others that slip my mind right now. I also had two of their Mojitos which are awesome. I love mojitos and I would say I have found two places in town which make them very well. My favorit still are the mojitos at The Abbey in West Hollywood, but when I am here I will stick to Firefly. Although I did not pay the bill I estimate our total to be between 50 and 75 dollars. A little pricey, but split between 2 or more people it isn't that bad. I love that the restaurant is enclosed in the glass dome of the Plaza hotel, very unique. I recommend all who have been to the location on paradise, or have never been, visit the new downtown locations."}
{"text":"Inexpensive but good good food. 3 girls ordered and finished a pitcher of sangria, baked brie, garlic prawns, seafood paella, filet mignon sliders, and macaroni & cheese. Yeeesss! We would've ordered dessert but it didn't sound that appealing so we ended getting dessert somewhere else. 

It's a hopping place for a group of friends looking to eat, drink, and be merry."}
{"text":"Initially, I ordered their chopped chicken salad and tierra y mars skewers.

The food took maybe fifteen minutes to come out. The first of my two dishes that came out was the chopped chicken salad, regretfully. What they produced before me was a large white chunky glob of mayonnaise. I proceeded carefully with my fork and made an attempt to identify the dish put before me. What I found were chunks of canned chicken,  shreds of endive, and grapes. The dish was composed of more maynonaise/dressing than of its distasteful counterparts, much too overdressed. This was no salad at all. I returned it to the kitchen. (1/5) Would not recommend.

I later placed an order for their garden variety salad: romaine lettuce, spinach, orange, feta, dried cherries, pine nuts, sherry vinegar, and heart of palm. The orange and dried cherries lend a nice natural sweet component to my dish, which I thoroughly enjoyed, especially since I had selected water for my beverage. This salad is priced at $7.50. What initially attracted me to their aforementioned train wreck of a chopped chicken salad I returned, was the fact that it came with a protein. I added grilled (actually GRILLED, not out of a can, like the first dish) chicken to my new salad for an additional $3 or $3.50 bringing my salad to nearly $12 grand total. Eh, should be $9.00 at most.
(4/5)

The Tierra Y Mars skewers were great. The tapas includes three skewers, stacked with filet mignon, grilled shrimp, and chorizo. (5/5)"}
{"text":"Why I have not raved about this place yet, I don't know. It's my go-to place when I have visitors, when I just want to sit with a friend over coffee and sangria, dine with family, have a girls' night, a business meeting, or a date. So, really, any damn time is a good time for Firefly.

My besties were visiting this weekend and we made Saturday night a date night, stopping here before hitting the town. The Mrs. had been here with me a couple years ago but this was the first time Mr. had been. Sacrificing virgins to Firefly is a great way to spend an evening!

We knew there would be a wait, so I put my name in and we headed to the bar for a pitcher of the red sangria. Unlike the cold red wine I had recently in another establishment, Firefly sangria is *real* sangria. Real fruit, real care, real flavors. I have come here just for the sangria. Top notch.

The atmosphere, I find, is always one of two things: boisterous and social and fun (without being overwhelmingly loud), or quiet and casual. Tonight was the former, and it was perfect. Patrons at the bar were engaging and personable, yet we still had our space, our own conversations, and time to ourselves while we waited. People watching is a must.

We were offered a table after only ten minutes or so and led to a hightop out on the patio. It was a little warm (duh, I know), and just as they bring heaters outside in the winter, some low-breeze fans would make a difference in the summer. When we were hit with a natural cross breeze, we noticed a huge difference. Just a thought.

Mmmm... FOOD! Stuffed dates, of course. Crispy, rich, and amazing. The Mrs. and I knew this going in. The Mr. is now a fan. Yay! A new disciple!

Eggplant canneloni, one of my favorites. I can't eat pasta, so this is a great, mouthwatering twist of goat-cheesy goodness on an old Italian standby! Molto bene!

Albondigas (meatballs). The Mrs. and I didn't care too much for the dish overall. I found the meat a little dry but raved about the flavors of the sauce. The Mr., however, really enjoyed them.

The ceviche was good as far as the seafood and avocado, but there was too much of the liquid in the dish and it had a little too much of an acidic flavor. 

The gazpacho was FANTASTIC. Some of the best any of us ever had. So fresh, so clean, just this side of spicy, and at once simple and complex in the layering of flavors. Really, really amazing. A must have.

The steamed mussels were good... until we found a rotten one. It was only one, but it ruined the dish for us. On the plus side, the liquid and the mussels WERE very good and tasty, but for that one... So we talked to the waiter, showed him, and sent it back without a replacement (which was offered, of course). It was too bad, truly, and I will be trying them again.

The lamb chops came out medium rare instead of rare and those we had replaced. Everyone was great about it and they came out the second time perfectly cooked, melt-in-your mouth tasty. The bed of veggies and lentils are more than a salad or garnish, but a dish of their own. Also amazing and very well received.

Instead of dessert we opted for a second pitcher of the red sangria and enjoyed the space, each others' company, and the buzz of the people around us. 

Service is always top notch, friendly, and helpful. The hiccups tonight were just that, hiccups. They were addressed as they should be and the experience was still fantastic. A great night and a great example of why this place is a 5-star favorite everytime I go."}
{"text":"Solid tapas, great service and amazing prices!  We liked the food but did not have anything that knocked us over (anchovies, grilled octopus, baby beet salad, meatballs, Tiera y Mar skewers).  Good sangria.  Good option if you want to get away from all the chains filling Vegas."}
{"text":"Excellent servers, portions, and variety!  You can't go wrong with this place!  What a great find close to the convention center."}
{"text":"Excellent food for an excellent price. First trip and first Yelp, but highly impressed. Drinks are priced to recupe for the food, but definitely give it a shot.  If you see an open seat, you're lucky - take it. Four stars for great food but slightly overpriced drinks off of the strip."}
{"text":"With 991 other reviews written, I'm probably not going to tell you something you couldn't already read, but here goes.  Came here at Midnight on a Thursday night/Friday morning, gathering friends from poker tables across the city via text and hoping they were hungry (or thirsty) enough to join us.   No problem getting a table for seven inside when we walked in.  We ordered about 30% or so of the full menu and a couple of pitchers of the red sangria and took our time.  

Standouts of the night were the bacon-wrapped dates (mmm sweet and savory to boot!), the pork empanada, manchego mac n' cheese, and albondigas.  The sangria was not very strong, which is probably a good thing or else we would have been in trouble.  

Considering we were going to enjoy Julian Serrano (Aria) or Jaleo, two of the more upscale tapas restaurants in Las Vegas I was pleasantly surprised by Firefly.  Definitely having exceptional luck with off-the-strip dining experiences in Las Vegas this year (see previous review of Mint Indian Bistro, as well)."}
{"text":"Ok, there's something to be said about a restaurant that is two blocks away from your house.  Especially if they DO have yummy and fruity Mai Tais, and Lemongrass Martini that's LOADED with alcohol.  On Friday afternoons, it's rather a cool hangout, and great ambiance. 

Their food, however, sucks.  It's supposed to be Asian fusion, and while I am still enjoying any \"fusion\" type place (aka, a hint of ethnic, a ton of Americanization), this is rather mediocre food at best, completely vegetarian unfriendly (which is odd, given the fact that this is Madison).

Service is good though, the staff is kind and attentive.

But I'd only go there for drinks.  Only because well.. I can walk to and from home.... And get a LOADED martini... YUM!


***** UPDATE *******

The Firefly Martini, with the ginger infused vodka, IS TO DIE for.

{"text":"This is an easy restaurant to rate 4-stars.  We discovered it through the reviews of other Yelpers.  

The service was excellent, food very good, reasonable prices, unique dishes, nice atmosphere, easy parking.

It's where the locals eat, as well as the folks you see performing for you on the strip.  

It's where you will spend half of what you will spend on the strip, and get double the quality.  

We would check this restaurant out again next time in Vegas."}
{"text":"The paella is so good. I got the combo paella and a bunch of other tapas, but the paella was the star of the show. Hubs liked it as well."}
{"text":"Saturday at about 8:00pm and the place was packed!  There was a 30 minute wait for a table - but any place with a bar makes the wait OK.  

The service was very good, which is hard to find in Las Vegas.  The place has a nice vibe going - good music too.

The tapas were all pretty pretty pretty good.  If I can remember them; spinach salad, dates/bacon, veg empanadas, grilled lamb, stuffed mushrooms, smoked salmon and eggplant.  One of those dishes was on a bed of lentils and that was very tasty.

There seemed to be a high ratio of nice looking ladies too - that seems to make the night a little better."}
{"text":"It was the FIL bday so to celebrate we went to Firefly.  It's good that he likes to try something different.  

The atmosphere was very nice, the bar area looked great for friends who want to meet up, nosh and catch up.

-gazpacho
-chicken salad
-tortilla a la espanola
-firefly fries
-pulpo asado (grilled octopus)
-paella
-chocolate tres leches

The food was really good, lots of flavor, and scrumptious.  Tapas can be hit or miss, but this place was definitely a hit.  Vegas is sure surprising me."}

The service was great, the atmosphere was great. Looking forward to going her again soon!"}
{"text":"Came here twice so far and every time I am blown away at how well the sangria is and the tapas!

Definitely try the sangria. Some tapas recommendations:

-bacon wrapped dates
-ceviche
-Steak and mushroom skewers
-Shrimp and pork skewers
-stuffed mushrooms
-mac n' cheese

I'm sure the other selections are great. I'd definitely come back to try more.

Also, free valet! =]

one recommendation: They could tone down the outside music or maybe try a more intimate/romantic ambiance."}
{"text":"Uno de los mejores restaurantes españoles que conozco.
Es una joya de Las Vegas. Probamos la tortilla española, terrina de atún (increíble) , las empanadas, y los Chicago Beef Bocadillos. Todo delicioso. Pero lo mejor estaba al final, los postres son maravillosos!
Es el ambiente ideal para una cita, intimo y si quieres compartir con tu pareja las tapas son una buena alternativa.
Muy recomendada la Sangría y el mojito.
El servicio rápido y bueno."}

{"text":"I love love love this place!!!  My fiance & I like to visit Firefly when we visit LV, which is pretty often.  I love the tapas thing they got goin' on.  The sangria is delicious and my very favorite thing on the menu is the stuffed dates yum yum yum!  

I've been to their other location, but the one in downtown definitely has a better ambience and view.  The location is great as it sits at the end of the downtown arcade thing.  

The only dumb thing about this place is how early it closes.  I think we went around 12am one time & it was already closing.  What restaurant closes at 12am in LV?!  boooo...lame"}

{"text":"I went to Firefly years ago when I was in Vegas for a conference and so when I borught my husband to Vegas for the first time I thought we could come back - Thank God we did!!!!

This place is HEAVEN!! The food is so good and we were all scambling to get the last bites!

Artichoke toasts - light and refreshing

Ceviche of shrimp - Was tasty, but messy :)  

Tortilla a la española -  Was good, but a little on the plain side

Stuffed dates - Melt in your mouth YUM!

Baked tetilla - Was good and so tasty on the toast!

Chicken and chorizo stuffed mushrooms - smelled the chorizo, but really just tasted chicken

Steak and mushroom skewers - these melted in our mouths - was soo good!

Babyback ribs - Oh my!!!!! Heaven on a bone - just fell off and the sauce was GOOD!

Ahi tuna skewer  - The Mango gave it a nice flavor, but wasn't my favorite.

Camarones a la diabla - Shrimp with a yummy chili sauce - We had to order TWO of these because they were soooo good!!! The sauce was incredible - firey and sweet and just OH MY!!!! Def recommend this dish!

Banana-Nutella sandwiches - I needed a little sweet after dinner and this did the trick! Was two pieaces of french toast with bananas and nutella sandwiched between them and for an extra kick, it's served with a little dish of extra nutella!

Sangria
Red - was fruity and flavorful, so good!
Sparkling - light and apple tasting - was soo good and refreshing!

All of this cost 4 of us $100 - so worth it!!!"}
{"text":"Spanish tapas thats open really really late - 2am. One of the best local food options after midnight.

The stuffed dates, Merguez (lamb sausage), and baby back ribs are excellent.

The Veggie Empanada was just ok. It had too much cream and cheese poured over it for my taste.

I've eaten in and done delivery here. They do both well. Delivery from here is a much better option than room service at most the hotels on the strip."}
{"text":"I found this place because I stay at the Fairfield Inn next door for work when I am in Vegas. The girl at the front desk said I should try out Firefly.
I am soo glad she did. 

Their Happy Hour 3-6 pm, (but I cant remember if it is Mon-Thurs or Sun-Thurs call to double check!!) is great half off all drinks. Sangria is $6.5 a glass or $26 a pitch normally. They also have Mojito's in a variety of flavors, $7 a glass or $28 a pitcher. So during happy hour those prices are so great! 

You start out by getting a garlic bread, green olives and almond butter. Oh that almond butter is to DIE for!! But do not, I repeat DONOT eat all the bread just yet! You have to save some for the sauces the dishes come with, especially the Camarones a la Diabla! 

The service is amazing, it can get a bit crazy during the busy dinner times. But you'll never sit with a stack of dirty plates. You actually have to watch out for your plate of diabla sauce, you'll want to dip that bread that you saved!

As for the dishes, I have tried SO many, here are my faves:

Camarones a la Diabla- You get 7 shrimps in this amazing sweet, spicy chile garlic sauce.  (You can ask for more bread of you ate it all with your almond butter)

Tierra y Mara- Skewers of shrimp, filet, and chorizo with a spicy green salsa. 

Stuffed Dates- Date with a smoked almond in the middle wrapped in BACON! Served with a red wine reduction.  People forget to add that they are ALMONDS in the middle.... I think that's what makes it great, other than the bacon of course! Another thing to use your bread for.'

Padron Peppers- These are under the hot tapas menu, but they're a great appetizer too. These spicy little babies are either grilled or baked to give them a slight char to them. Served with lemon, and sooner than you know it you'll want to order another plate. 

Other things I have tried, Manchego mac n cheese, empanadas both the veggie and meat, baked tetilla, lamb skewers, firefly fish sticks, and too many more to remember."}
{"text":"Terrific tapas!

There wasn't one dish that disappointed me. I was expecting to question a few of the plates we ordered but not a single one was lower than my expectations. In fact, most of them wow'd my taste buds. 
Mushroom and steak skewers were by far the tastiest dish of the evening. That sauce they are cooked in is absolutely amazing. 
Shrimp ceviche / tuna tartare were also very good. The mango salsa was a nice touch to the tartare and the tiger prawns in the ceviche really pleased the senses. 
Chorizo and chicken stuffed shrooms, I love you. 
Don't forget the delicious pitchers of mojitos and the firefly fries!"}
{"text":"Nice, dim ambience for date night or drinks with friends. There's a large number of items to choose from so everyone should find a couple things they'd like. As with any tapas place, the plates are fairly small and the cost adds up quickly. Be sure to remember there's a parking lot dedicated to the restaurant out back."}
{"text":"Oh my god! If you like Spanish/Mexican than this is the place for you! Sangria, Tapas, Paella!"}
{"text":"Eat It OR Beat It?
**EAT IT!!**

BEST tapas I've tried. The pitcher of sangria (red and white) is very delicious! Normally, people who visit Vegas don't venture off the strip too much, but Firefly is a restaurant you must must visit! The dates wrapped in bacon is my personal favorite!
Forget spending 3x the money at the Bazaar in Beverly Hills for snooty subpar tapas... try this place out! 

CONCLUSION:
If you're tired of eating buffets and want to mix it up, I recommend coming to Firefly! The prices are very reasonable and the food is rich and full of flavor! So, I say, EAT IT!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Make reservations!  Were in LV for a seminar and had 8 pm reservations.  Walked in at 7:30 with hopes that they could take us in early but there was a mob of people waiting to be seated but lucky us, we had the foresight to make reservations so we were seated at 7:40 before anyone in the mob.

Everything was amazing from food to service. I am a lover of great wine so was hesitant to order a sangria (code word for wine cooler) but  I finally had the red sangria and it was delicious.  I will definitely order one in the future."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love Firefly?  All I know is that I do, and whenever I go, it is mandatory to order:
1.  Sangria
2.  Stuffed dates
3.  Tres Leches cake.

A friend and I met there last night for a pre-movie meal, partaking of those requisite dishes, plus the apple/manchego salad, chicken skewers, shrimp tempura, and shrimp ceviche.  We got seated without waiting at  around 5:30pm, which is great for a Saturday night without reservations, and made it before happy hour was over.  This meant one glass of red sangria for me, two glasses of some kind of red wine for him, attentive service, delicious plates of food, and another satisfying experience at this terrific tapas (not topless!) joint.  ¡Muchisimas gracias!"}
{"text":"Small plates, yes. Tapas, no.

OK, so it's the Vegas strip, which makes me apply my sliding scale and give this place 2 stars (in NYC it would get one, or if Yelp allowed it, zero).

It's crowded, dark, and festive. OK - so far I'm thinking we're starting off right. Then we get the drinks. Way watered down. And expensive. Then came the food. If anyone who does food prep in this restaurant has ever been to Spain, I'd be surprised.

I'm all for innovation, but only when the results are worth it. The better tapas were completely forgettable, the rest were actually bad. Seriously. Have the people who give this place a good review ever eaten good food? Or were they too drunk off the (weak) crappy drinks to notice?"}
{"text":"The food is amazing. Pick it and it's great. Seriously. They're good at everything. 
Bacon wrapped dates, ahi stack and petite filet are the bomb. Get the infused vodka on the rocks to drink. 
Off the Strip location is perfect for relaxing and getting away from the craziness. 
Omar, is the Man! Great and verrrry personable bartender. Makes you feel like home. 
Athena is professional, yet fun. 
This place is a must every time I come here. Never ever ever had it let me down. 
Great ambience. Great patio. Great food. Seriously, just do it and you'll thank me. 
Oh, and tell Omar or Athena that Rick sent you. 
You're welcome."}
{"text":"In Vegas for a work trip and our group went to Firefly (Not sure if it was this location or the other). Fabulous food- and the mojitos were spectacular.  If you get nothing else, get the stuffed dates- bacon wrapped, smoked almond, redwine reduction and blue cheese. OH MY GOD.... they were amazing and fabulous and rich and wonderful. Everything that I had was really really good. The Padron Peppers are also great- these are some of my favorites. The lamb chops were really great with the sauteed veggies and veggies. Empanandas were smashing as well. It's a great place to go- get off the strip if you go to Vegas and go here."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! My girlfriend and I lived in Spain for 4 months so we are always on the lookout for good tapas. We recently came here with a large group of friends and loved it! The sangria (white and red) were delicious. We will definitely visit this place again next time we are in town. The service was quick and friendly. And it's not too far off the strip."}
{"text":"I'd have given this higher stars had I never eaten tapas before, which I have, in San Francisco and it's a lot better there. BUT. The prices are ridiculously low, except for the wine markup, which was 3x on the bottle we got, which I always consider just so inappropriate that it knocks a half point off my restaurant reviews.

The food itself was pretty good, especially the eggplant canneloni that had the perfectly roasted eggplant skin. The manchego mac-and-cheese could have used a tad more salt and the mac could have been just a little bit chewier, though on the whole it was a good example of the whole let's-play-around-with-comfort-food genre. The aioli wasn't really up to snuff, which made the patatas bravas a little sub-standard. 

The real winner on the menu was dessert, which I usually don't expect to be very good. But the tres leches was really moist and flavorful and the chocolate in the gelato was just the right level of dark with something floral in it."}
{"text":"We came here for hubby's Las Vegas birthday bash.  We'd been wanting to come here for a few years now but just never made it.  Boy, we were glad we came!!

This place was bumpin'....we showed up and the restaurant was already full.  We were promptly seated and quickly served. 

We were a big party so we all ordered what we wanted which meant a lot of food on the table.  At first, they were slow in clearing the plates but eventually this little lady came by and basically patrolled our table, picking up empty plates as soon as the last bite came off of it.  That lady was on top of it, filling waters, clearing plates, getting everything we wanted.  At one point, we saw someone from a departing party hand her a tip on their way out.  Doesn't surprise me!  She was awesome! (We tipped her separately too)

Food time!!

I have to admit, there were some hits and some misses.  But the hits very much out shadowed the misses.  
Misses: 
Tomato Bread - I was hoping for the simple version we had all over Barcelona but it turned out to be over-vinegary and the bread wasn't nearly substantial enough to sustain the topping so it became soggy very fast.
Lobster Escargot - This dish was overcooked so that the lobster was mushy and not fresh tasting at all.  The seasoning was not enough to make the sauce bread-dipping worthy

HIts:
Pulpo Asado - Roasted octopus...nice portion and the octopus was perfectly cooked and tender to the bite
Paella - I haven't had a good history with paella but I daresay this was my favorite version so far.  The rice was well cooked and the ingredients were perfectly balanced with each other.
Ribeye - This was topped with a blue cheese butter, one of my favorite treatments of steak.  I asked for it medium rare and it was served to me that way, perfect!!
Mushroom Tart - Mushroom gravy-ish thing topping a square of puff pastry. Not exactly a \"tart\" but delicious nonetheless.

All in all, it was a great time.  We had the sparkling sangria to drink.  Don't expect high octane stuff but it was a great palate refresher."}
{"text":"Great locals spot, I love anywhere you can share your food. I recommend the spicy shrimp, scallops in garlic butter, filet, dates and ahi tuna tartare.  I also love their blood orange mojitos.  Fun place to go with friends and just off the strip, without the price of the strip."}
{"text":"The only reason I went to Firefly on Paradise was because Rachael Ray told me to.  JK.  I saw her $40 a day on Las Vegas and just had to try it out.  We ordered a whole slew of things, but the stand out for me, being a veggie is the tomato soup.  Here's the kicker: I don't even care for tomato soup.  But for some reason, Firefly's tomato soup is divine!

I'm going back in a few weeks and I am excited!"}
{"text":"Just had dinner here and holy crap totally worth the walk from the Strip. It's a little out here so take a cab, but it's all amazing. We had the Cevacha, fish sticks,  mac and cheese and papas bravas and they were all fantastic. Extremely well priced for the portions served and good service, fast and efficient and our water always came quickly.  Also had mojitos and sangria,  both delicious and strong enough.  Great atmosphere,  a little loud but very nice.  Absolutely Check it out I will come back when I'm in a Vegas."}
{"text":"I was in Las Vegas on a business trip and was invited to dinner at the Firefly (it's always nice to get away from the strip) and I was not sure what to expect but I was in a group of 9 so I thought that even if the food was bad (I am a big foodie/wine guy) the company I was with would make it fun. We had a BLAST.  The food was delicious, fun and creative (yes it is not one of the so called foo foo 5 star digs on the strip)but this a truly a hopping place where it seems you could have a intimate diner with someone special, hang out with your pals at the bar or have a party on the patio(thats where we were). The service was as good as the food and they seemed to be spot on, they were like a machine. The wine list is very varied they had some \"fine wines\". Also save room for desert, great also. Yes it's a ways \"out there\" but thats why Ford invented the car! The biggest problem I had was that I have to wait until I get back to L.V. to try it again.  
Fun! Fun! Fun!
Thanks"}
{"text":"At the bar and this place is live!!! Patrick and Omar are BEAST!!! They work the Bar! Awesome customer service and I my wife and I felt VIP. Definitely recommend this place if you are looking for a good place with Great Service, Food,  & Drinks!!!"}
{"text":"Ok I haven't been to the firefly in years so let's just say I was tapas intoxicated after my dinner.  Even my children were food sleepy.  It was an excellent experience for my family.  Every dish was in point!"}
{"text":"WOW! This place off the strip really nails it! Fantastically priced and portioned. The signature mojitos and sangria go down very easy. Open late and serves food late!"}
{"text":"ok, with all the negative press this place has received recently, you would think the service and drinks would have been better. since when does a mojito-which is a 'muddled' drink- not come muddled? they just throw some mint leaves in the glass and call it a mojito, pretty lame. the service was slow and the server acted like he was doing us a favor by coming to our table. this location has always been the worst out of the firefly bunch but this last time was especially disappointing. i told the server i wanted my mojito like it was supposed to be made (apparently, you have to ask for it to be made properly by asking for it \"paradise-style\", meaning the way they make it at the paradise location) and my mojito came back to me with coconut rum and pineapple juice?! it was way too sweet and was the last disappointing straw. at this point, its only saving grace is their generous happy hr that features half off cocktails. if you can get your drink made properly..."}
{"text":"Dude, just eat here. Eder was our waiter. We told him to bring us his five favorites. It included tuna tartare that was amazeballs. We also had cod, lamb chops, and skewers of some sort of delicious meat. Do yourself a favor and go to Firefly, find Eder, and prepare your face for greatness. PS, this is a tapas bar, not a topless bar ya jigaloo"}
{"text":"Excellent, fairly affordable tapas in Las Vegas. A hidden gem that's definitely worth leaving the Strip."}
{"text":"Worst service I've ever received here, and it was for a special occasion  but the food came quickly and drinks were delicious even though the water glasses were always empty and we were left on the patio while the waiter maybe went home and we wondered if we would ever get the check. 

Of course I'll be back, I love this place. Too bad my friends had never been and were not impressed."}
{"text":"Our friend recommended this place to us and since we just got into Vegas we figured we'd grab lunch here.  The menu was impressive to say the least.  Just check out the pics posted to Yelp and you'll be able to get a good feel for the amazing options.  Everything we tried was awesome!  We will definitely come back on our next trip.  Be sure to check this place out!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of the shrimp ceviche, stuffed dates, duck rolls, ahi tuna skewers & the mojitos!"}
{"text":"Coming from the east coast to visit, I wanted to get away from the strip to have lunch.  So my friends thought it be a great idea to take me for Tapas and Sangrias. Of course - it did not disappoint!

1) We had Chicken salad -chopped breast, grapes, smoked almonds, creamy cider dressing, endive.  This wasn't anything special, just a regular chicken salad if you ask me.

2)  Smoked Salmon Toasts - brioche toast, dill sour cream, pickled red onion, capers.  This was okay, I think I expected this to be fresher, it the salmon was colder it would probably be better.

3) Stuffed Dates - bacon-wrapped, smoked almond, red wine reduction, blue cheese.  This was an awesome dish.  who doesn't love bacon wrapped apps?  

4)  Padron Peppers - flash-fried, touch of salt; most are mild.  Always a signature tapas dish, can't really go wrong with these.

5)  Stuffed Peppers Spanish piquillo peppers, fresh mozzarella, garlic cream cheese, tomato sauce.  I thought this was okay.  

6)  Manchego Mac N Cheese baked w/ baby shells.  This was a pretty awesome dish, I would definitely recommend this dish.

7) Tierra y Mar skewers grilled shrimp, filet mignon, chorizo sausage, salsa verde.  This was okay, skewered meat. 

8)  Chorizo Clams - grilled shrimp, filet mignon, chorizo sausage, salsa verde.  This was not bad, it was a flavorful and the toasts that came with it went great with the sauce.

9)  Filet Mignon Sliders - mini burgers w/Serrano ham, cabrales cheese, caramelized onions.  I thought this was only okay, nothing special.

And we had a pitcher of Red Sangria.  This was really good and I recommend this with the meal.

I would definitely want to come back here again when I come back out to Vegas."}
{"text":"THE BEST RESTAURANT IN LAS VEGAS. HANDS DOWN. Anytime anyone recommends a restaurant in vegas, this is the one I recommend. It never disappoints, I've been coming here for years!! 

The following is what I recommend::: 
Tuna tartare
Shrimp ceviche 
Mushroom tart 
Veggie empanadas 
MAC N CHEESE 
Baked goat cheese 
Baked cod 
Fries 

Everything on the menu is amazing but these were a couple of my favorites. The service is impeccable. Eder went above and beyond to make sure we had the best experience ever. Firefly is the restaurant I look forward to every time I'm in vegas!!! 

 Highly recommend the pitchers. Great bang for your buck"}
{"text":"I have a new favorite place in Vegas (that isn't a strip club or a dive bar)!

Last week in Vegas we went to Firefly on a Monday night. I think it says something about this place that it was packed at 6pm on a Monday!

I got there early and went to the bar while I waited for my party. It was happy hour at the bar with half priced mojitos and a free appetizer plate. I was sold right then and there. Then we sat down and ordered our food in earnest.

First off all the stuffed dates (wrapped in bacon no less) is nothing short of awesome! But then again so was everything else. The Spanish meatballs, empandas, filet mignon sliders, mac and cheese, all of it was great!

Seriously, this place as great drinks (the mojitos were awesome), a great atmosphere and amazing food. They definitely get packed, so make a reservation or be prepared to wait, even if you go on a Monday.

I will not make another trip to Vegas without going here!"}
{"text":"I love Firefly. I have been to many tapas spots, but none can compare to the fire that is Firefly (Cheesy? Yes. Accurate? Also, yes).

I would say this is the best low-key tapas spot in Vegas. And no, I am not including anything with an address on LVBLVD (read: low-key). The menu is reasonably priced for small-plates, and the waitstaff is both attentive and knowledgeable about their food and drinks. I especially love the dessert sampler, which comes with approximately 5-6 desserts for tasting (the Lemon-Berry tarte is my favorite!). In addition, the Firefly fries are delicious, I love the ceviche of shrimp, mushroom tart, and the Manchego mac'n' cheese is to die for! The fried calamari is also a win here. 

I hope that you go, and experience the love of tapas that is Firefly. Yes, they had issues. Yes, those have been resolved. 

Go. Love the tapas."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try this place for the loooongest time and finally got the chance to this past Valentine's Day! We had no reservation so we had to wait. How long? An hour and a half, according to the hostess. However, tables cleared out faster than expected and the congestion of people in the waiting area magically disappeared. 

The menu was simple and the prices were not too outrageous for me since I prefer eating many smaller meals throughout the day instead of stuffing myself full. The atmosphere was chatty and a bit upscale but not too noisy or pretentious in any way. The waiters all looked sharp and young, which probably helped. However, one gripe of mine is that our waiter was not so attentive at the right times and overly attentive at the wrong times. 

We tried 8 different tapas, my favorites being the lamb skewers, the eggplant, the shrimp ceviche and the chorizo clam. Everything else was pretty tasty as well. The fries were missing something though, and looked better than it tasted (even with the yummy aioli). Maybe I'm just used to stronger-seasoned fries.

Overall a good place to go for a night out with friends or a date."}
{"text":"I haven't been back to Firefly in years because of the crazy salmonella outbreak that happened at their two previous locations. If you don't know what happened, there used to be a location in Henderson and one where Tacos and Beer is right now (same owners). There was a huge salmonella outbreak in the Tacos and Beer location that made a ton of people sick and hospitalized, including some friends of mine. The health department then checked their Henderson location and it had to be shut down because of the health grade. 

The only reason why I came back was because my friends wanted to go and it is conveniently located near our office. I ordered the Firefly burger, which was actually pretty good. The fries were a bit under seasoned but the burger had really good flavor. They have a vegan menu here too if you're into that. I didn't order sangria because I had to go back to work. I won't be coming back just because I'm still not over the whole salmonella thing, sorry!"}
{"text":"Firefly is excellent for groups as the small plates makes it easy for sharing. On the expensive side, the atmosphere is mellow and beautiful with drapes and low lighting. Service is personable, authentic, and quick. Our waiter Carlos was extremely accommodating to our gluten intolerant friend, made sure to tell her everything that had gluten in it. He also ensured her that the items that are gluten free do NOT share the same equipment as gluten items. She was able to eat without fear. 

The bathrooms were a bit horrid, but that's depending on the guest, if you catch my drift."}
{"text":"Only for adventurous eaters. Don't go if you don't want to try something new. I'm tempted to take away a star for the crowds and the noise, but I don't want to hate on them for being too popular. Five stars. Great prices for what you get."}
{"text":"THIS IS A MUST GO! It is worth the drive off the strip. The food is DELICIOUS and the prices are really reasonable. The bacon wrapped dates with blue cheese are a MUST and the baby back ribs are also AMAZING. The white Sangria is also to die for! I will definitely be back when I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Winner!!! I loved this place and would come back here over and over again even though it's not 'on' the strip.  The sangrias here are to die for.  Marinated for 3 days?  You get to pick your poison - sparkling, white or red. YesssssSSSSSSSSSSSSSSssss!!!!!!!!!!!!

After doing a round of celebratory engagement drinks here, we were quite full on the stuffed dates (my absolute favorite), filet mignon sliders, mac n' cheese (can hardly ever go wrong with these), terra y mare skewers and camarones a la diabla. My man and I were sooo stuffed and buzzed off the food and sangria that we just wanted to take a nap. Wake up. And eat there again.  I cannot wait to come back and visit this wonderful place!"}
{"text":"My date and I decided to check out the new Firefly, just a block away from the old one. I enjoyed the spacious and hip interior, along with some ambiant music playing over the restaurant chatter. We didn't check out the bar but we did order some quenching sangrias since they were half off all month long. I'm not the tapas expert but the menu has a lot to choose from. Bacon wrapper dates were my favorite, along with the diablo shrimp and stuffed mushrooms. The staff was very friendly and attentive as well.  I will definitely make a return here very soon!"}
{"text":"TAPAS, amazing, just simply fantastic, delicious, so many to choose from tapas.
The stuffed dates wrapped in bacon were the most spectacular, delicious thing ever, camarones a la diabla oh my word. Just simply delightful, we were embarrassed we kept wanting to dip the bread in the sauce, it was the perfect amount of sweetness and perfect kick of spice, the most wonderful shrimp a la diabla. The Chicken and mushroom paella is new, different, but a very well made, and delicious paella, never tried anything like it, very tasty and flavorful.
We pigged out here, literally, we had 4 tapas, anything you choose will be amazing, plus paella, and Sangria. I am definitely planning on coming back here, most definitely, our waitress was very kind, sweet, and welcoming, very helpful also to when it came to tapa choosing."}
{"text":"As in most Tapas bars you can really spend some money here on a meal. The food was pretty good and the dishes were very unique."}
{"text":"I had this place bookmarked for over a year but never had the chance to try it out until last week. There are a limited amount of tapas restaurants in the LA/OC area and I was eager to try Firefly while in Vegas because I haven't had good tapas since I was in SF a few years back.

We ended up ordering five dishes total which were the tortillas Espanola, lobster escargot, chicken and chorizo stuffed mushrooms, filet mignon sliders and tuna stuffed peppers. As expected the dishes were quite small but didn't leave us feeling full in the end. But everything we ordered was really yummy and despite not giving us a satiated feeling, it did leave us wanting to make a return visit on our next Vegas trip to try different dishes.

Also, this place is great for mojito lovers! They have several different flavors but my favorite was the passion fruit mojito."}
{"text":"Delicious Sangria and food! The paella was superb. Service was perfect. Prices were great. We would definitely come back! Come here when you're free."}
{"text":"Very good! The two $$ is a bit deceiving as it really depends on what you order. Fortunately I loaded up on freebies at the Embassy prior to visiting here so was able to stay in the two $$ range but if I went hungry, it would have easily been in 3 $$$ territory.

Still very good food but parking was a bit of pain."}
{"text":"Nice location off strip.  The food was amazing and served in a great social manner.  If I lived in Vegas I would be a regular."}
{"text":"After great hesitation following the mishaps of this restaurant involving the health district, my hubby and I decided to return.  The variety of foods are still amazing.  My favorites are still the warm spinach salad, artichoke toast and empenandas.  

I am a BIG Mojito fan and decided to stray away from the original Mojito and try the blood orange Mojito, sure glad that I did... Super yummy and refreshing.  Staff were kind and attentive.  We will definitely be back, with the expectation that there will be no further issues involving the health district.

The reason for four stars is that due to one of the restrooms being out of order, both males and females had to share one restroom.  Before entering, I had to check with the hostess to ensure that the restroom wasn't being occupied by the opposite sex.."}
{"text":"The food here was delicious.  Everything came out really quick, and the sangria was amazing.  I liked that they had a fruit/no fruit option, as when there is no fruit in the pitcher you get more sangria for your dollar.  The fruit clogs the straw anyways, so I figure win, win."}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place. We frequent this establishment a few times a month. Great dishes and great drinks. The atmosphere is awesome too."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of 7 girls. Thank God we had reservations because there looked to be quite a long line outside. This restaurant is in a strip mall and pretty inconspicuous. 

Its tapas/small plates so we ordered a ton of different things. I'll try to list out all the ones I can remember

Tuna Tartar - Didn't really strike me as Tapas or Spain especially considering the taro chips but it was fresh and tasty.
Ceviche of Shrimp - WOW! So authentic and on point. Me and my friend both said at the same time that the only thing missing was some tapatio! 
Stuffed Dates - Super tasty! The almonds inside give it the right amount of crunch to change up the consistency. 
Tierra & Mar Skewers - Everything was cooked really well (which i didn't really expect since they were all one one skewer). 
Chicken and Chorizzo stuffed mushrooms - bite size with a kick.
Mac and Cheese - so good we had to order 2! Creamy and super tasty!

I am sure there is way more stuff we ordered I just can't remember it and there were  a few things I didn't get to order that sounded good as well.

They also sell mojitos by the PITCHER! The mojitos were good and not too stiff. Service was pretty quick once one plate came out they alls tarted to fill up the table quick. Everyone seemed pretty happy with the food.

The prices are pretty reasonable adn they have something for just about everybody on their menu."}
{"text":"Great tapas. Great spot for a date. Had the burger and some chicken tapas and mixed skewers. Delicious."}
{"text":"I love firefly...Best Tapas in Vegas. Food is reasonably priced and so are the drinks. Don't forget to try the Sangria., and don't let the strip mall fool you either. The vibe inside the restaurant is always fun and hip with a lot of younger crowd. I have probably been to Firefly more than any other restaurant in town."}
{"text":"Always great. I've been going here for years and while the atmosphere has improved... the service and food is still great. Love, love, love this place. And the Rib-Eye is fanominal."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were looking for a vegetarian-friendly place for a nice dinner while briefly staying in Vegas.  I did some web-searching and cross-referencing and Firefly seemed to fit the bill.

It was a Saturday night and we arrived at Firefly at about 8:00p.  After about 5 minutes we were seated on the heated patio that was beautifully strung with red and white lights and really just seemed to be an extension of the dining room.

Drinks were tasty: sangria and dirty martinis, and we were offered a nice crusty bread with compound butter consisting of schraicha, honey and almonds.  It was really good!

We ordered two cold plates and two hot plates.  The green apple manchego salad and pisto were real standouts.  All the plates were reasonably priced between $4 and $6.

For dessert: the caramel flan with almond biscotti was sized very well and tasted perfect! Not too-eggy and velvety smooth.

All-in-all a great dining experience.  I would definitely recommend this to a friend!!"}
{"text":"I had the best grilled scallops, grilled chicken.....topped off with excellent chocolate and cherry bread pudding for dessert!!  Great bartenders tonight taking care of everything!!  This place is HIGHLY recommended!!"}
{"text":"We went here on monday 03-09-15 at 8 pm with a group of 20 people.   Food and service were great.  We had the house sangria and some mojitos both were fantastic.   The food was good but the flavors were not quite as exciting as I had hoped.  I will definately be back."}
{"text":"In Vegas for the weekend, and decided to get off the strip for dinner Saturday night.  Best.  Choice.  Ever.  We weren't super-hungry coming in, but I wish we had been!  Next time I know to fast for a day or two so I can try more than 3 dishes!

We ordered:

Gazpacho - solid dish, great croutons/avocado on top, nice texture and flavor.  At most other restaurants, this would have blown me out of the water (and it did, until I tried the other 2 dishes....)

Ceviche - YUM. YUM. YUM.  Great lime-iness, nice texture on the shrimp.  I used the bread to soak up the rest of the broth.  Heaven!

Thai Beef Salad - I will order this again and again and again (assuming I make it back to Vegas).  This salad was perfection!  The beef was tender and flavorful, and the other salad ingredients were so perfectly balanced.  The dressing was soy/salsa verde-based and I also soaked this up with bread.  I can't stop thinking about it.

Service was great, food came out fast (probably helped that we ordered 2 cold dishes and a salad) but we didn't feel rushed in the least.  Arrived around 8 pm on Saturday, put out names in for what we were told would be a 45 minute wait, came back 30 minutes later and were seated immediately.  Fun & funky atmosphere without it feeling like they were trying too hard.  Basically, I was impressed as soon as I walked in and the food only increased my opinion of this place.  Check it out, for sure.

The 3 dishes above, plus the complimentary bread/olives/spread (WHAT WAS IN THAT??  It was sooo yummy), plus 2 beers only set us back $30 + tip."}
{"text":"Service on point as usual and the food is amazing.  Keep up the great work and hopefully we Las Vegas we see another location again."}
{"text":"Place has the best tapas selection in town.  The bar menu rocks and the service is efficient.  Just don't cross contaminate in the kitchen and I'll keep coming back.  I like the skewers, lentils, meat pastries, mushrooms, octopus and Spanish tapas.  Sangria's are the bomb.  Gr8 happy hour value and crowd.  Noisy but bearable.  Skip the meals and have more tapas."}
{"text":"Went to Firefly on a weekend trip to Vegas. We got there early, around 5:30 pm, so the restaurant was basically empty. We were seated at a booth right by the window, overlooking Fremont Street--a great spot to see the Fremont Street Experience! Low lighting added for a romantic setting at the beginning of the meal, but by the time we were leaving it was packed and loud. Not a bad thing, just a different atmosphere than when we walked in.

Meal started off with complimentary olives and bread with a side of almond butter. Then we ordered the sausage plate, patatas bravas, ham and cheese croquetas, and crispy duck rolls. I heard that the duck rolls were really delicious, so I had high hopes, but wasn't that impressed. Overall, the food was good. Props for an extensive menu and I wish we had more of an appetite so we could have tried other items.

Service was mediocre. Our waitress was very friendly, but service in general was pretty slow. The worst part of the dining experience was simply getting to the restaurant. There's no direct entrance to Firefly; you have to trek through the Plaza, which seems pretty dumpy."}
{"text":"We come here every time we're in Vegas since we have discovered them several years ago. This is our third time here. Bacon wrapped dates, albóndigas, tomato soup, tuna tartare, and Serrano ham and manchego crochets. All delicious."}
{"text":"We loved Firefly! Everything we ordered was full of flavor! The garlic shrimp was amazing and the wait staff were all very friendly and helpful!"}
{"text":"Great food. Really wonderful, especially if you consider the price. 

Ambiance- relaxed, pleasant. Fancy enough to go before a night out. Laid back enough for a casual meal.

Service- wonderful service! Waiters are not pushy, very willing to answer questions and give suggestions. Personable and fast. Clears dishes quickly, refills waters, great overall. 

Food: lots of vegetarian options. I hear the meaty ones are good, too.

- Paella: large cast iron skillet- looking thing, which serves 3-6, not 2-4, was tasty and flavorful. *** Really does take about 40min., so order it first. 

- Manchego mac & cheese: creamy & cheesy. Not overly salty

- Tomato soup: how come I can't get that flavor at home? Rich and smooth, just the right balance of tomato-sweet-salty. 

- Mushroom puff pastry thing: creamy. With mushrooms that weren't overlooked- great texture. 

-  Veggie empanadas:  crispy crust, and a filling of who-knows-what deliciousness. Outside wasn't too thick, and the filling was plentiful. 

Sangria- 2 kinds: sparkling white or traditional red. Both were tasty, but most ppl preferred the red.

Check this place out."}
{"text":"We listen to fellow Yelpers and I'm glad we did!!! This place was SO GOOD!!! I don't know if it's because I got 12 different dishes but every single plate I got was tasty hot and fresh!!! This is what we ordered and 4-6 steak and mushrooms!! So please try steak and mushroom when you try this place.. We will def be back. The service was fast so that always was a plus. Always had a server by our table if we ever needed anything. Refilled out drinks consistently.... Thanks Yelpers for the great recommendation !!! U def made up for some of the past ones.. Ha"}
{"text":"Firefly on Paradise.  We'd been to the Plaza location and LOVED the food.  Arrived about 8:00 pm, got seated immediately.  HOLY COW, is that place crowded and noisy, a little too much for hubby, after about 15 minutes he was ready to bail, but held in there.  It's also kinda dark.  I do hope the Plaza location opens again, much nicer atmosphere.  We had a great server.  There were three of us for dinner.  The food is outstanding, together we ordered:
Bacon wrapped almond stuffed dates - 5 stars
Chicken salad - 5 stars
Veggie Empanada - 4 stars
Chorizo & Chicken stuffed mushrooms - 5 stars
Filet Mignon sliders - disappointing, dry, 2 stars
Lamb Skewers - 5 stars
Steak & Mushroom Skewers - 5 stars
Ahi Tuna Skewer - 4 stars
$75.00 total
WAY too much food, but took a doggie bag back to the room, had a cooler with ice and ziplock bags!"}
{"text":"Happy Hour 1/27/10  Firefly at the Plaza
5 stars +++
This was our first experience with a Tapas Bar, but it won't be the last!!  Any tapas bar half as good as Firefly would be GREAT.  We met friends at the bar.  Try the sweet sangria - it's red & white sangria (marinated for 3 days) with champagne.  So good.  Friends said Mojitos we excellent.  Happy Hour is 5-7pm ONLY in the bar.  But any food on the menu is available.  They bring you (each person) a sampler plate with a bleu cheese stuffed bacon wrapped date, meatball and layered pototo somethinganother. All three were wonderful.  We ordered more stuffed dates, pork empanadas, chicken salad, a cheese spread, sirloin & mushroom skewers and I've forgotten what else - but it was all terrific!  Our bartender was so friendy and the evening view of Fremont Street Experience made this a memorable evening! I want to try everything on thier menu.  $38.00 exluding tip"}
{"text":"I love Tapas but this place wasn't very good at all. The only thing that was good was the bacon wrapped dates and those are pretty hard to mess up. We ordered a variety of dishes and the meat dishes were dry and the salad was bland. The service was horrible. We had to ask for water twice since they never brought us anything to drink and barely even saw our waiter. We had to ask the person clearing our table for our check. Won't be going there again."}
{"text":"this place is great!!! i love the food it has alot of flavor to it , the waitress are nice the whole experience was very nice i will definitely come back when im in VEGAS!"}
{"text":"Pretty good food!  i just loved the ambiance of this place.  The portions are a little small, so you have to order more dishes to be full.  But if you just want a light bite to eat, this place will definitely hit the spot."}
{"text":"Synesthesia: the production of a sense impression relating to one sense or part of the body by stimulation of another sense or part of the body. 

The taste of this food exceeds the synesthetical beauty of all I've seen here so far in Vegas and surrounding lands- the beautiful Hoover dam, the breathtaking Red Rock Canyon, the tasteful tits in the magazine kiosks advertising the college girls in need of tuition money. Maybe it's the mojotos talking, but WOW! What a meal. If I was stranded on a desert island with one restaurant for the rest of my life, it would be this place. Long live Firefly!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing the service was impeccable when we got there the manager Carlos greeted us upon our arrival and had a hostess Seat us then Neo our server was very descriptive with his suggestions  he suggested the mac and cheese which was ammmaazzeebbaaalllss and the tuna tartar needles to say I will comeback as soon as I get a chance 2"}
{"text":"Great ambiance and value for your $. Best strawberry mojitos (made with fresh fruit) and the portions are excellent. A must try if you've never been"}
{"text":"Wow a very excellent eclectic blend of flavors.

Terrific service and ample menu choices."}
{"text":"Reason why I'm giving 2 stars and not 4 is because of their lack of service. Firefly has always been my go to place for tapas, but after the service today, they are not on my top list anymore. We racked up a $200.00 bill just to have to ask for a refill because an hour has gone by and still no refills on our drinks, we had to tell them to take our dirty dishes and on top of that handing them our dirty plates! Not to mention, caught the servers gossiping about our table because we look like a group of younger people. You really think we can't afford your food? Where do you think you get your paycheck and tips from? YOUR CUSTOMERS."}
{"text":"Great meal with my friends. Cheaper than expected,  more delicious than we planned for.  Each dish offered a new texture or flavor. Wait staff was friendly, accommodating,  and happy to serve. Come here for a good dinner!!!!"}
{"text":"Went to this place earlier with my bestie. It was both our first time here and i must say food was really good. Was able to enjoy the happy hour and it was all worth it. Had a drinks named The New Girl, it was bomb. Babyback ribs and chicken skewers was delicious and tasty.  i will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Been to Vegas many times, and never had a chance to try Firefly until recently. Sadly, the food was not worth the wait.

Sangria - No. Not strong enough, and way too little fruit flavor for a drink that claims to have been marinated for 3 days. Did feel like the pitcher was never-ending, just never-ending sugar juice.

Stuffed dates - No. Recommended by server. Tasted like BBQ sauce.

Stuffed peppers - No. I prefer the Peruvian version. This was a bit overly cheesy (and I love cheese).

Pulpo asado - Eh. I've had better.

Camarones a la diabla - No. Tasted Chinese, and not spicy at all.

Albondigas - Eh. 6 meatballs for $7. Could have had 3 In-N-Out cheeseburgers.

Lamb chops - Now we're talking. The 2 chops for $12 were very tender, and my favorite of the night (and I don't even eat lamb!).

Ambiance is not conducive to holding a conversation, anything romantic, or close to relaxing. It's probably easier to hold a conversation at Chinese dim sum restaurants than it is here, as noise is coming at you at all angles. I could barely hear my BF across the table. The only good thing was the service; my glass was always full!

Needless to say, I'll save my stomach space for Vegas meals elsewhere."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat at in Vegas! Ever since I had my birthday dinner here a few years ago, I've been coming here every time I go to Vegas. I love tapas and was first introduced to paella and tapas on a Barcelona trip 2 years ago. Before then I never really knew what tapas were lol. My favorite things to get are either the shrimp ceviche, paella, tuna tartare, pulpo asado, steamed mussels, scallops, empanadas, or camarones al ajillo. The seafood here is super delicious and the sangria excellent!  The paella takes awhile to make so if you're gonna order that, put your order in with your appetizers. Weekends are really busy here so make sure to make a reservation or there's first come first serve seating at the bar."}
{"text":"If you've never experienced Spanish Tapas in your life, then visiting Firefly on Paradise needs to be on your list of places to eat before you die. 

The food at Firefly is quite delicious and I personally recommend the stuffed dates, the lamb, and the croquettas. I know I had more favorites than what I listed but those are the only things on my mind that come to mind. But TRUST, a lot of the items are really great and the staff is very friendly!

Also, it's a must that you order a pitcher of sangria and/or a pitcher of mojitos. I normally don't prefer mojitos because I see mint as being more a condiment or a flavor rather than being in your drink, but for some reason, the mojitos at Firefly are really, really tasty. 

I can't wait to come back and try new items on the menu! This place is definitely a great spot to go to if you're in a big group because the atmosphere is loud, the lights are dim, and since it's pretty loud inside, you might as well be loud and drunk with your friends. Why? ....well, why not?"}
{"text":"One of those spots that have been there forever and you still don't get tired of it. Pretty much having the same same menu for years but that's what makes it awesome. Why fix what is not broken right? that principle works like a charm with this fellas

Most plates are tapas style which means they are small, however its a good thing that they are because you can start exploring the menu. The paella however, is big enough to share.

Try the pulpo asado if you feel a little risky and willing to experience its amazing flavor. Tetilla cheese for the cheese lovers or camaron a la diabla for those who like  it hot.A must try is their filet Mignon sliders with cheese and the garlic fries Don't kiss a vampire after them fries though. Actually don't kiss anything .and not because your newly uber stinky breath ..but because you don't want to share all that awesome garlic flavor left inside your mouth

Waiting time can get crazy. specially on the weekends this place tends to get packed and loud..not because of the music but the people around you. The decor is great and the music is very good and goes perfect with the ambiance. Red is a predominant color so if you are a bull please dont be hitting the walls.

Before leaving try their well known signature drinks. Their mojitos are delicious!! And the sangria is refreshing and super tasty. A whole pitcher of the sangria and 3 mojitos might make you stand up on a table..get a red napkin and cry to the Madrid and Barcelona gods as loud as you can : \"OLE OLE!!!..Yes it was fun..dont judge me..well at least until security came in...Viva espana y hasta manana!!"}
{"text":"Service and food were great. I just hope this place doesn't become too busy every night! 

The summer salad is refreshing and the petite filet was spot on."}
{"text":"Love this place been going for YEARS and it's always consistent. Great food great drinks and good service. Can never go wrong. Love the stuffed peppers!"}
{"text":"The best tapas in town. Must try their Mac n'Cheese. Now I know what you're thinking, Mac n'Cheese?! Why would anyone go to a tapas place for that?! But this is way better than any another Mac n'Cheese you had even had. Other super tasty dishes are their spicy beef salad, lamb crop, stuffed data, sliders and so much more. AND their Sangria, they have awesome Sangria. Get a pitcher and share it with your friends. The place get hotter late at night. Except to wait, this place is pack all the time."}
{"text":"Came here for HH with a friend who's local.  And oh my gosh. the food!

The HH is amazing, super awesome deals and great food to choose from.  I would definitely suggest the bacon wrapped dates, it's insane how good it tastes!!  I would recommend it for the HH for sure, not sure about the regular hours 

Super nice place too :)"}
{"text":"Great food! Atmosphere is good. Does get busy at times, best to call ahead and make a reservation. The drinks are amazing, and the service is great."}
{"text":"Off the strip and on point.  This place simply rocks when it comes to good tapas style food.  We went there twice during our stay, and if I had more time, I would have gone back a third time.  We have had about 15 different dishes, and only two were in the \"average\" range, and I use that in comparison to the rest of the dishes.  

The standouts for me were the stuffed dates, the stuffed peppers, and the pork empanadas.  But I must also mention the chocolate tres leches cake.  Holy Moist Cake, Batman!  This was an excellent dessert.  Very rich and decadent, so you need to leave a little room for it.

They also have a homemade sangria that was really tasty.  I am not much of a sangria fan, but I enjoyed the sips from my wife's glass.  If you are even considering a sangria, get it.

Service was really good.  Very attentive and friendly.  The atmosphere fits the mood of the food, with some very attractive paintings that look a lot like Asencio, but not quite.  There were quite a few couples here, and the atmosphere is very inviting for a romantic evening.  Great place to impress a date. :)

Make a point to come here."}
{"text":"Food was really good although there was a mess up with the order and a took a while for the food to come out.  Staff was friendly and useful but not great.  Seemed to be more interested in the larger tables ( I was there as a table of 2)."}
{"text":"This is my second experience at Firefly from the guidance of my lovely g/f.  She is well versed on the menu but I was able to participate in the choices.  The dates will always be ordered; in fact we doubled up on the dates.  Every menu item I have tried has been exceptional.  I like the vibe of the place...Hip energy without the poseurs.  We could not get a reservation but opted for a drop-in at 5pm on a Saturday night and had no problems getting seated quickly.  I really like this restaurant.  My first experience we ate too much and the bill with dessert was still only $60.  This time we had just enough food to include dessert and the bill was $50 with tip."}
{"text":"I recently went to this Firefly location for the first time.  I have been to the westside location only two times.  I much prefer the westside location.  Food was the same which is great.  Here are the things I did not prefer:

I think the parking lot sucks. I went on a Wednesday night around 6:30pm and people were having to walk several hundred yards from an off street.  This is not a cheery neighborhood.  

It must be a re-habbed building because it looked sort of ghetto to me.  Then, we were seated in another part of the resteraunt where you walk through a door that looked like you were not supposed to.  My friends were still trekking from the parking lot and I knew they would never find me.  I would recommend they buy one of the nearby strip clubs that have gone defunct because strip clubs know how to setup parking and a good layout inside.  (that is what I hear...)

Other than that we had a good time. The servers did a good job."}
{"text":"We chose this place (long distance! I live in WI, my daughter in AZ) for a cocktail reception after my daughter's wedding strictly based on reviews and price. So glad that we did! This was a wonderful experience for us. We had about 35 people and the coordinator (I wish I remembered her name) was amazingly helpful and got us set up in a banquet room, with a separate table for the wedding cake, and spots for everyone to mingle and eat. Kept checking in with me to make sure all was good. We had three appetizers (so yummy!) and an open bar. The bartender Miguel was super great and took food orders for a few people who wanted a full meal. All the guests loved the food, the atmosphere and their experience. Most of all my daughter was happy! Thanks Firefly for helping make her day as special as possible!"}
{"text":"4/19/07

Hands down the best Tapas and Sangria place I've ever been to.  Including NYC and Europe.  Great atmosphere, location, music, staff.  Nothing lacking here, except maybe more parking spots.  A great find in the land of CORPORATE Dining.

And those mentioning all the fake boobies and K-Fed lookalikes...  HELLO!  This IS Vegas, they're everywhere!!!  And TAPAS is about little dishes to talk over and socialize over.  It doesn't have to stick to traditional Spanish ingredients."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE! If you come to Vegas, you must try Firefly. It's super cute and the food is SO good. My favs are the apple & manchego salad, the bread and butter they give you, and the mushroom and filet skewers. Everything I've ever had is good, so you really can't go wrong. If I could give it 6 stars, I would!!!"}
{"text":"Great food.  The reviews that mentioned spotty service did not apply to me.  I had great service from a friendly waiter.

We arrived early on a Friday night... I think at 6 pm.  No wait!!!  WTF?!  I guess it's a Tapas place, so people are coming later to get shitfaced.  Well, I was kinda right.  15 minutes later the place was packed.  We got lucky!

The servers came promptly and we mentioned to him that it was our first time.  We got a pitcher of red sangria to start off and when he came back we started ordering.  After we finished our first round he promptly came and we ordered a second round from him.  When we asked for suggestions, he was very friendly and patiently told us his favorites as well as popular items.

+the red sangria was amazing.  It wans't watered down and it's been marinading for three days.  You can taste the sweetness of the fruits mixed with the wine.  It was the best sangria I've ever had.

+Stuffed dates... as other Yelpers mentioned, this was great.  The waiter mentioned that this was one of the most popular dish.  The sweetness may have been a bit too much, but the almond was there to give it a bang at the end as well as another needed texture to go with the crisp bacon and the soft dates.

+Crispy duck rolls:  These were one of my favorites.  Just make sure you eat it before it gets soggy haha.  The duck was grounded up, it was made basically like an egg roll.  The hoisin sauce they had with it made it great.

+Something peppers.  Red peppers with the cheese.... wow.  I usually demand meat in my dishes, but this did not make me regret getting a meat free dish.

+/-Fillet sliders... I guess this wans't anything special  I mean they could have used sirloin or chuck and it would've been fine.  Why grind up fillet which is already tender?

+/-Paella was OK.  Nothing special.  A bit overpriced if anything, but you gotta have your paella with tapas

+/-Smoked salmon toast.  The smoked salmon part was good.  The fact that the toast was not crispy at all ruined it.

I had many other things that were great also.  But these were my favorites or the items I felt needed to be mentioned.  For 5 people including two pitchers of sangria (for $26/pitcher) the bill came out to be around $130 pretip.  I'll be going back!"}
{"text":"Those of you who know me or have read my reviews know that I generally only review a restaurant for which I completely disagree with the average reviews on Yelp.  I figure a great restaurant with 5000 reviews praising their establishment doesn't need another similar review for someone to wade through.  This is not one of those occasions.

I suppose I should have seen the stale, tough bread as a sign.  If I did, I chose to ignore it.  Overall, the food was hit-and-miss.  The apple manchego salad was nice - light and refreshing.  The ubiquitous bacon-wrapped dates were fine, the recommended shrimp, chorizo and filet skewers disappointing and the also-recommended grilled octopus just terrible.  Neither seafood option was fresh - the octopus was tough and tasted off, with a miss-matched sauce and generic potatoes.  The filet was fine, but the shrimp were frozen and in short supply.  The chorizo almost non-existant.

My real issues here are with the restaurant in general.  This was, by far, the most unimaginative, pretentious, poorly-executed and disappointing tapas restaurant I have ever been to.  The menu is just plain boring.  Come on, this is tapas!  Give me something exciting I've never seen before.  Give me crazy combinations and flavors.  At least give me something simple done perfectly.

I know this is Vegas, but off-the-strip Vegas.  House music?  Really?  An entrance like a steak house out of the 60s?  Pretentious waiters and bartenders who would rather talk to each other than their customers?

I have heard about this place for years, had friends recommend it and was anxious to try it.  Maybe it just can't live up to the hype.  Don't waste your money in town where great food is everywhere.  It's not worth the drive.  It's not worth the money.  It's not worth eating here at all."}
{"text":"Came here last Saturday for an early dinner with the gals. The location of Firefly is a few miles away the strip and near a corporate plaza (which reminded us of Orange County). Since we got there early (before 6 PM), there was no wait but the place was still more than half full. The restaurant has a nice, cozy, intimate feel with dark red interiors.

Everyone got a glass of white sangria but I opted for an Amstel light since I'm not a fan of fruity, sweet drinks. We all ordered 2 plates each but I ordered 4 since I was starving and wanted to try a few more plates.

From the plates I sample, my favorites were:

Ham and Cheese Croquetas - This was a flavor explosion in the mouth! I loved the rich cheese mixed with the tasty ham and the crispy outside batter. There was some sauce drizzled on top but I couldn't make out what it was

Camarones Al Ajillo  - So.Freaking.Good. The shrimp was fresh and cooked perfectly. The butter sauce was delicious - I wanted to drink it with a spoon. Next time, I will try the Camarones A La Diabla since that one has a spicy kick to it.

 Petite Filet - Despite the filet being cooked pretty much well done (I asked for medium), it was still very tender. It would've been 10x better if there was some red left in the meat. 

All in all, this is a great place for a date or a group outting. The atmosphere is pretty casual and laid back but the ambiance is fantastic. We're planning another girl's trip this summer and we're definitely planning on coming back here!"}
{"text":"Great place if you want to get off the busy strip and go to a place that's not crazy overpriced. It's usually pretty packed here even late at night past 9 PM. Food is solid and service is good as well. Their fried tempura fish is da bomb and so is anything with shrimp. Their steak tapas is pretty good as well. Try to sample as many small plates as you can since the portion sizes are smaller."}
{"text":"after years of coming to vegas, i finally was able to try this place out. 
i don't know why i didn't come here sooner.  i for one, love tapas, and this place nails it right on the head.  the food, service, atmosphere was great! 

we ordered the following below: 
stuffed bacon wrapped dates, artichoke toast, rack of lamb, Octopus with spicy tomatoes and potato, and stuff mushroom. 
The best items were the artichoke toast.  omfg.  it was like little bits of heaven.  do yourself a huge favor, and get this.  the stuffed mushrooms, is something you can skip.  not too appetizing.  

this place has a fun vibe to it.  i heard that some nights they have a live band come in and play.  call ahead and check. so come down to firefly and order yourself a sangria and enjoy your night.

They also have free valet for your car."}
{"text":"Go here! The food is just perfect! They made me love fish and I don't even like fish! 

After being surrounded with neon and that Steve Wynn advert that plays when you get into any cab in Vegas, I was feeling like a moment of fresh air off the strip. Firefly is tucked away just far enough where you can catch a cheap cab, or even walk if you're feeling particularly adventurous (or if you indulge in a pitcher of their sparkling sangria like we did). 

The place is incredibly romantic. Everything has a warm red glow, tables are cozy, and although it's a popular spot, we were able to get in at prime time with only a twenty minute wait. I was totally full after splitting 5 tapas in total - the patatas bravas are heavenly and spicy (ask for them spicy - it's not overwhelming, but it adds so much flavor). 

Prices are fairly normal, but after eating on the strip a few days, you'll feel like some kind of coupon queen (or king). Seriously a great find - perfect food, just the right atmosphere, and sangria to write home about."}
{"text":"This is the second time I've been here while visiting Vegas and I would come back hands down.

The food is amazing and unlike the rest of Vegas, NOT over priced. We had our fill of dinner and cocktails for less than $50 TIP INCLUDED! My wife (who can be very critical of dining experiences) loved it and wanted to come back the next night."}
{"text":"True story, I came here with my mom and girlfriend and we were seated next to a table of Vietnamese strippers.

Best dinner ever.

Alright, now that I've gotten that off my chest, onto the review!

Firefly is awesome. Period. We piled up plate upon plate of dishes, each one more delicious than the one before. Instead of eating some overpriced frou frou garbage on the Strip or succumbing to your newfound poverty and eating 99c hotdogs, please get in a cab or car or whatever and head to Firefly.

There's something for everyone. You like to kill and consume four-legged animals that run through the plains? They got it. Perhaps you're more of a follower of Poseidon and it's swimming creatures that get your tummy rumbling. You're covered there as well.

On the real real, I'd probably drive back Vegas on the stupid I-15 just to eat here again."}
{"text":"This place is conveniently located a few streets off the strip behind the Linq hotel.  The place itself is huge and there is parking in the rear and valet parking up front. The lighting is dimmed inside.  My group of 4 ordered the following items:

Mixed Paella - $26 - All the paella dishes take about 40 minutes to prepare so I placed an order for this as soon as we arrived.  They are also highly customizable.  My mixed paella consisted of shrimp, mussels, clams, calamari, chicken, veggies, hold the chorizo (as I don't eat pork).  This was the star of the night as this dish was bursting with flavors and had quality ingredients.  The dish is designed for 2 to 4 people to share.

Pulpo Asado - $10 - Another one of my favorites was the grilled octopus with potatos, tomato, and a paprika-lemon vinaigrette.  It wasn't as soft and tender as my favorite tapas place, but it was still very good.

Scallop Escargots - $10.50 - This dish consisted of scallops baked in garlic-herb butter and the presentation gave the affect that they were escargots.

Tinga Empanada - $4 - This tapa was a bit small and consisted of 2 crispy chicken empanadas, tomato, onion, and chili-lime crema.  This dish was good as well.

Petite Filet - $13.00. - The filet mignon was tender and I asked them to prepare the dish without the red wine sauce.  This dish wasn't bad, but I would probably order some of the other tapas.

By the time we finished our meal there was a huge wait.  I really enjoyed the meal and would highly recommend ordering the mixed paella as some of the other tapas weren't really filling.  Service was extremely fast for the tapas that we ordered and our water glasses were filled through the night."}
{"text":"Great ambiance.
Great service. (Even the manager came up to my husband and I)
The FOOD IS AMAZING. 
Ribs, fries, seafood...all of it! 

If you are staying on the strip, you have to get here to eat. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I love the small tapa dishes here! we were there as a party of 7 so we got to try so many different dishes. To start off the service was very warm and welcoming. Both the red  and white sangrias are sooo good! I also recommend the empanadas with the chicken or the veggie, the apple and manchego salad was aaamazing!!!The only one I am not a huge fan of was the chicken skewers it was a bit dry. We put in 2 orders of the mixed paellas, of course we definitely did not finish it so we took it to go. We were staying at an Airbnb, after the 7 of us came back from partying tipsy, tired  and starving late at night ... we just heat up the paellas in the microwave and they are the perfect comfort food before going to bed!!"}
{"text":"Food is excellent. My favorite thing to order are the empanadas, they never disappoint! Whenever I go with groups of people we always get the paradise mojito pitcher,  it is delicious and a great value! Portions are a bit small I wish they served more of their amazing food!"}
{"text":"The food was good and well prepared.  The service was also pretty good.  The restaurant however was really loud, Granted it was a Friday night and a few tables had no plates just tons of empty glasses.  We took a visiting Mom here and we were pretty embarrassed about the drunks sitting behind us screaming about pretty nasty bodily functions.  The food,  service and prices were good.  Probably won't go back on a Friday night."}
{"text":"This new location is much larger, cleaner, and better overall than the original service. I'm glad I gave it a try because I k ow I was hesitant to. 

Bravo, job well done. You earned my patronage back."}
{"text":"What a great place for a large group party. I came here for a friend's rehearsal dinner and had a fantastic time. We had the private room and 'it was just cozy and intimate. 

I enjoyed the various tapas that were ordered. The highlight for me was the chorizo clams, mac n cheese, and the steak. That steak hit the spot. It was cooked a perfect medium rare. I don't know if I was famished or just jet lagged but that steak was gooood.

The sangria was very light and very dangerous. I shared a pitcher with my friend and we totally destroyed it. I went with the sparking white sangria and later on the classic red. Thank goodness for cab service!!

The service was spot on considering how many people were present (about 20 ppl).

I had a great time with my friends. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Got here only a couple of minutes before happy hour ended absolutely love the red sangria pitcher for $18.00 like 6 drinks worth easily... ordered the tuna... calamari... and filet mignon everything was delicious. Will definitely come back just wish they had music for ambience lol"}
{"text":"I have never been to a Tappas Grill before and it was a good expeiernce, they have very good food and the prices were not bad at all, its a nice place to share your food and such! Will go again!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice, once for a girl's dinner about 4 years back and again recently for a bachelorette dinner with 28 people. The food is tapas style and the prices are really cheap (well, compared to SF and LA tapas prices) for the quality of food. We ordered about 10 different dishes to share between the four of us, along with a pitcher of their sangria (large pitcher for only $28!!) and we were all STUFFED! 

Our favorite stand out dishes include the scallops \"escargot\" (juicy scallops in a butter pesto sauce), the bacon wrapped dates, shrimp diablo, clams and mussels. I'm sure everything is yummy because there was not a dish I did not enjoy out of the 10 that we shared. This restaurant will be bookmarked for all my future trips to Vegas! It's great for groups or a romantic dinner and food came out hot and fast."}
{"text":"Third time here and it's consistent.  The food is authentic and the service is just right. 

FOOD: very solid authentic tapas. If anything the portions are too big which is not a terrible problem other than it limits what you can try in one sitting. Again - 3 visits and everything was very good. 

SERVICE: Just right in my opinion. Not too aggressive but very attentive. Water was always filled and setups changed when needed without a bunch of fanfare. Perfect. 

My server tonight was listed as Night on the bill - well done,  thanks."}
{"text":"The 5 stars goes to our dinner and our server, which was absolutely wonderful. We were a party of five and ordered the chicken & mushroom paella, two pitchers of the red sangria (my favorite over the white) and several tapas. The bacon wrapped dates are by far the best I've ever had, the pork empanadas and roasted red peppers are also a standouts. All the others were great as well. Although we enjoy this place a lot, it was our first time bringing out of town family members here and they were beyond impressed with the food, ambiance and service. 

HOWEVER: I must note that the valet parking here is RIDICULOUS!  It's like FIVE feet from the entrance. We initially parked in an open spot out front NOT marked for valet, only to have the jerky valet guy bitch us out for parking in a \"valet\" spot. So we backed out of the spot, drove about two feet and gave him our keys to valet....and he parked it in just about the same damn spot! I don't get it, but whatever. Wasn't thrilled about tipping him either, but the fiancé did. 

Definitely my favorite restaurant in Vegas. Despite the idiot valet situation. I think we would have had a better time if we weren't all put off by the valet guy. Lame."}
{"text":"We went there last night as a group. My friends wanted tapas and I found this place online. I also asked around and the feelings were all positive. The reason I didn't give a 5star is because they auto added a gratuity. I truly despise that. This is Vegas and hospitality and guest service are expected. All interactions like this should be 5star no matter where you go. That being said, lets talk about the food. ITWAS SOOOO GOOD.  there was 6 of us and we all ordered 3 tapas so u can imagine what our table looked like. I didn't get the waiters name, slight deduction for that as well, but he made suggestions to me based on what my friends ordered and they were spot on. i got to try the shrimp tempura, the filet, the steak on a stick, the ahi tuna, the scallops, empanada ( chicken ), stuffed pepper, the spanish chorizo, the ham, and the mini bagles and salmon. everything was so good. had a stella draft. it was kind of tiny to be honest and this is coming from a non-drinker. either way yo will not be disappointed !  the amount of food they put on each plate is actually pretty significant. enjoy !!!"}
{"text":"Mmmmm tapas!!! 
Wait, did you say topless?! 

TAPAS! Appetizers, appetizers appetizers.... What's up with all the hate?? I love this place! I have been here plenty of times, but have yet to put in a review... why? I don't know.. I haven't been here in a while, so bear with me on the names of these tapas dishes.. 

So far my list my group has had: 
Drinks: Watermelon mojitos, regular mojitos, and mango mojitos. 

Food: Salted peppers (this is vague, but i really don't remember the name), Thai beef salad, chorizo and clams, mac n cheese, fire fries, vegetable empanadas, stuffed dates, Terra y mare skewers, 

Dessert: Passion fruit cheesecake, nutella sandwiches, Tresa leches cake 

Of these what I recommend: WATERMELON MOJITOS, sooo good. I may be biased for my love of mojitos, but this is the perfect drink for sitting on the crowded patio in the summer months. The chorizo and clams is really good, the flavor of the chorizo creates an amazing flavor to go along with the clams, and it comes with bread for dipping in the leftover broth. And for dessert, I feel they are ALL incredible (I would come here just for drinks and dessert), but I think the cheesecakes are amazing, so tiny, but bursting with flavor and the perfect cheesecake-y creaminess. I would like to call it the best cheesecake I have ever had;] 

I have seen a lot of comments on the service... but I feel this is unjust. This joint is for large groups in my opinion. I don't feel this is good for a one on one date: it's loud, distracting, and lively. Come here with a large group of friends, get a pitcher of drinks, order a large amount of appetizers, and that should set you straight for your entire visit. The atmosphere is boisterous... and loud, and fun! Do you want your waiter chiming in when your yelling at your friends across the table??? Noooo. So, order in large amounts, trust me, it will get eaten.. No worry for wasting of food here."}
{"text":"As much as I'd love to give this place four stars (even five), I had an unpleasant experience with a bartender here that ruined the aspect of customer service that's otherwise nice. I was waiting to get change from his register, and apparently the person in front of me was also getting change as well (at the time I didn't realize this). When I was next to get change, the bartender gave me a dirty look and shook his head like I was supposed to give my change to him at the exact moment the other person wanted it, for the convenience of making one trip to the register (which, yes, I could understand, but didn't realize the person in front of me was getting change too). It wasn't like he had to walk far to the register to get it, but he said something that I didn't hear since it was so loud (which probably wasn't good judging from the look on his face), and handed off my change with an attitude. 

On the plus side, I like the atmosphere for the sake of it always being festive, busy, and lively. There are some choices on the menu that I'd definitely pass up on (just because the portions are too small for the price they ask), but then again most of the items on the menu are delicious and have flavor to them. It's a great place to go for an outing with friends when you want to be festive, but not spend a fortune."}
{"text":"Still one of my favorite places on or off strip (it's off btw which adds to it's awesome vibe)

Where do I begin. The hostess, who was Moldovan but her name escapes me (Nadia i think) totally saved us and got us an amazing table. She was on her game. 

We were there early and found four spots at the bar (not big and in a tough spot but worth it while you wait). They stuff their own blue-cheese stuffed olives for martinis.... i think we all had at least one. 

Why only one?

Champagne Mojito. Nothing like it, even when you have no-seat-oh. (HIMYM)
and the Pear-Ginger Martini.

it's hard to choose.

As for food? Dear god. Here are my top 4:

- Bacon-wrapped stuffed dates. - three orders.
- Tierre y Mar Skewers. the salsa verde is insane and this is filling for a tapa.
- Albondigas? (yes, HIMYM again) no secret. they rock.
- Filet Mignon Sliders - delicious, filling, fun to split."}
{"text":"I DON'T GET IT!!

Everyone at my table of 6 found this place absolutely disappointing and unspectacular. 3 of us ordered the following dishes to share:

1. Smoked salmon toast- Thinly sliced smoked salmon with dill sour cream and capers. It was a'ight. The taste was nothing noteworthy.
2. Tuna tartare- Raw, cubed tuna with avocado in sesame oil. This was perhaps my favorite dish, with a great savory flavor.
3. Stuffed dates- Bacon-wrapped date stuffed with an almond and goat cheese. I commend them for the flavor matching of the sweet fig and the savory bacon. I can appreciate the different textures- soft fig with crunchy almond and creamy goat cheese. The favors were perhaps too bold for me that I could only eat one.
4. Roasted eggplant cannelloni- The eggplant was mushy, with a thick layer of mushy goat cheese. The textures did not bode well with me. The tastes were unremarkable.
5. Pulpo asado- Grilled octopus with potatoes. This is actually the best octopus I've tasted, simply because it was not chewy like other dishes I've had before. 
6. Petit filet-  This was a'ight. I think I meant to get the sliders, but instead ordered the filet. I've definitely had better steaks.
7. Merguez- Lamb sausage was dry and not particularly tasty.
8. Sparkling sangria- Delicious and bubbly sangria.

Total price ~$30/ person

I do admit that my expectations were high upon entering. However, I do believe I've tasted much better tapas before. Firefly did not the mark for me or the rest of my table."}
{"text":"I would probably rate it a 4.5. I had been eyeing this place for a couple of weeks and knew that it was a must try. I found a Groupon so I was even more excited. The food and atmosphere was really amazing (a little dark but romantic since I was with my hubby). So comfy/cozy and it wasn't crowded (Tuesday lunch time). The stuffed dates, stuffed mushrooms, chicken skewers, fried shrimp, mac and cheese and pear martini were definitely memorable. I'm coming back next time I'm in Vegas.  The only negative was the dried bread they served as a appetizer but I didn't pay for that lol."}
{"text":"I used to love going to Firefly, but it gets increasingly less impressive each time I go.  There's not a lot on the menu I like... I've tried a lot of stuff but there's nothing I really order regularly.  I ordered the veggie empanada once and asked if I could get it without mushrooms.  The waiter told me they were pre-made, so taking out the mushrooms wasn't an option.  It made me wonder how much of the stuff on the menu is pre-made and shipped frozen to this place.  Besides the food, my friends and I used to always go for the tasty sangria.  I swear the stuff hardly contains any alcohol anymore, though.  One pitcher used to get three of us a good buzz... nowadays it's three pitchers later and we are feeling nothing!  Sangria at Firefly is out, and mojitos at Cana at Town Square is in!"}
{"text":"So damn good. Great for a date, party, or family. Service is amazing and the environment is killer! Huge vegetarian menu....i can't what to go back."}
{"text":"So I went on a Yelp'ing frenzy on my last Vegas trip since I did more eating out than I did partying and sleeping. It's usually hard to find tapas bars in Orange County, or at least ones I like eating at. So when I came upon this one in Vegas, I debated on writing to the owner and having them consider getting one out in Orange County...like really. I highly recommend you come here, bring a couple friends, grab a couple glasses of sangria, order a couple of dishes, order a couple of more, and then have yourself a darn good time. Bacon wrapped dates...very few places have these, only one other place (in Whittier, CA...) ties with this place on this dish. This is currently my newest addiction...I have no idea what it is about this savory-sweet combo that gets me every time, but it does...Also get the firefly fries and the tierra y mar skewers...flavors that'll leave you wanting more, like a good strip tease. Next Vegas trip, I'm heading straight for this place for more yummy!"}
{"text":"When I got to Vegas, I wanted to eat some Spanish food and I found this place through yelp. I love the atmosphere of this place. It was kind of a lounge feeling. Of course we ordered about four different things to share since we didn't really have a big appetite, but were just hungry. I loved the ceviche since it had a very lemony taste. We also had a glass of sangria which could have used more fruits in it. 

Their service was very quick and friendly. I believe this place gets really packed after 5 pm because there was a huge amount of people that started coming in. It was a friday night too."}
{"text":"Everything on the menu is my favorite here! One of my favorites in Vegas. I always recommend firefly on paradise. Try the stuffed dates,patatas bra vas, and sliders with a pitcher of sangriammmmmmmm"}
{"text":"What a cool place.  If you don't know what Tapas are, it's basically small side dishes/appetizers.  This place has is down, you can order all sorts of Tapas until you are full.  It's reasonable on price for what you get to try and everything tastes good.

It has a full bar and it's packed and popular with the young crowd.  Great people watching for sure."}
{"text":"Great food options for all.

Great service.

Great huge bar.

Must go and it's right off the strip.

Petite Filet is the best bang for the buck!"}
{"text":"Just had an absolutely wonderful anniversary dinner at Firefly! Apple/Manchego salad, mushroom tart, firefly fish sticks, and the petite filet. Topped off with a complimentary flan desert. EVERYTHING was spectacular. The apple salad was fresh and crisp, fabulous palate cleanser between meals. Service was on point, hostess, busser, server, everyone was friendly and attentive, but not intrusive. Overall great experience and we will definitely be back on our next trip!"}
{"text":"Ah yes. The infamous FireFly. Excellent sparkling sangria. Awesome tapas. Dinner...AND a show! 

If there was a Housewives of Las Vegas, this would be their major hangout spot. Seriously."}
{"text":"If you want to get off the Vegas strip for some tapas dining, I highly recommend this place. Fun and vibrant place that fills up. All the tapas are great and the Sangria makes is good as well."}
{"text":"Made a reservation on Open Table. Found parking easy, we were seated right away. All the dishes we ordered were amazing, great flavors, seafood and steak cooked perfectly. Authentic and so much detail put into every dish, even the smallest tapas and dessert. Very busy and pretty loud but I would still recommend for a date night. We were checked on a lot for more orders and refills even with the place packed. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"This place is definitely one of my favorite places to eat in Vegas. Whenever visitors come, i tell them they should stop by this place. In fact, we went this past Saturday and had the stuffed dates, the Machengo mac and cheese, the ceviche, 2 orders of the sliders, the chicken skewers, and the mussels. There was a pitcher of Sangria as well as several other desserts. Oh and somehow we fit in banana-nutella sandwiches, chocolate bread pudding and lemon berry tarts. Everyone loved everything. This is no joke. I do not lie about food lol. For 6 adults, this was sooo filling and our bill was about $120."}
{"text":"Overall, great service and tapas. Not the healthiest as most of the foods are fried or sitting in oil. However, all very tasty. It's a great location for a date night."}
{"text":"We come here on Friday nights for Salsa night and it never disappoints. Bartenders are super nice even as busy as they are and the drink prices are reasonable. The interior is beautiful."}
{"text":"Liked the mojitos!  The pitchers were inexpensive and the food was pretty good.  I think the thai beef salad was my favorite.  
If you can, get here in a cab that has a boom box.  Adds to the experience."}
{"text":"Firefly is a good Tapas restaurant.  The restaurant is quite large, so it's not too difficult to get a reservation.  Also, the service was fast enough, and the food was enjoyable.  There was nothing that blew me or Mr. Riches out of the water, but it was a good Tapas meal.  This is more a spanish tapas restaurant.  We went with a large group, so were able to try quite a few dishes.  The stand out for me was the diablo shrimp. Out of all the dishes, it was definitely the best!

If you are in Las Vegas, and want to venture slightly off the strip for some reasonably priced good food, give firefly a try!"}
{"text":"I have been here a handful of times- ALWAYS a great place. Yes you need to drive here, not a walk from the strip. But so worth it. This last time I got the Mac 'n cheese, meatballs, dates wrapped in bacon, oh and a mojito....so good! It gets busy and noisy-make sure to call for a reservation!"}
{"text":"Nice little place. Great atmosphere; average service; pretty people. Get the Ahi Poke if you like fish!"}
{"text":"Made reservations for a bachelorette group of 21 here and the food did not disappoint!! Our waiter was attentive to our needs and time restraint since Magic Mike was our next stop! The food was amazing especially the seafood paella at the end!! Will definitely come back!!"}
{"text":"A friend of mine and I found a groupon for this place and decided to come here for lunch. Upon arriving she had told me about their salmonella incident. This of course scared me and I told her I did not want to have lunch here anymore, but she assured me that the new location was fine and that they had really good food. So I gambled with my health and we decided to come anyway. Sure enough the food was delish!

Stepping into firefly I noticed the environment was nice and clean. The walls were painted with warm, dark tones. The overall atmosphere was pleasing. You even had the option to sit outside, but with the sun beaming out we decided to enjoy our meal inside where it was cool. 

We stuck with the groupon and ordered multiple tapas and not one of them was a disappointment. My favorite tapas would have to be the mushroom and steak skewers and the smoked salmon toast. The steak skewers were tender, juicy, and flavorful. And the smoked salmon toast..yuuum! Their dishes were served with abundant flavors. And before I forget to mention, their firefly fries are really good; the dipping sauce served with it really compliments the fries. 

The servers were also nice. I never had to ask for a refill because my cup would already be filled. I would definitely come back to try their other tapas or entres."}
{"text":"Tapas not bad, a bit disappointed in their paella
Don't understand why firefly can get 4.5 stars on yelp. 
Recommend spicy shrimp and ceviche shrimp tapa :)"}
{"text":"A couple of friends and I went out to Firefly to celebrate the evening.  The place itself is a little dark, but decorated quite nicely. We were seated at the patio...it was enjoyable,  the weather was pleasantly beautiful.  We started with a pitcher of Sangria,  it was sweet with a strong flavor. We ordered tapas. Baked brie, patatas bravas, tortilla espanola, and calamari all were enjoyed by all. There was no room for a main entree the portions were quite big. We couldn't say no to dessert and had to have the chocolate cake in tres leches....SO GOOD rich and sweet. Service was mediocre, our waiter was lame. Not very attentive nor talkative. We asked for several things while it appeared he was just being a little lazy and he lagged.   Overall good food experience, but unpleasant service.  Don't know I would go back because of the service.

I recommend reservations they get fully booked on Friday and Saturday. 
4 stars, but minus 1 due to bad service."}
{"text":"Tight crowded setting, but a lot of tasty dishes make this a great place to stop in. I could see having a poor meal here if you got unlucky in ordering, the shrimp ceviche, Thai beef salad, and crispy duck rolls were decidedly below average when I tried them. They do have a lot of really tasty stuff on the menu though, the stuffed dates, albondigas, and babyback ribs are standouts that I really enjoyed."}
{"text":"I come here every time I visit Las Vegas, when I lived in Vegas they were my favorite tapas restaurant and they still are! Reasonable pricing, great service and excellent food!"}
{"text":"I've had great tapas before but it's 5 star worthy. When you're beat from paying high-priced strip food, this is where the locals go. Maybe Rachel Ray messed it up by telling us non-Vegas locas about this in $40-a day. The price is right, the menu is damn good, and the assortment of sangria and especially mojito is endless. My next trip to Vegas I will have to stop here for a bite."}
{"text":"Really great restaurant off the strip. Diverse menu, tons of flavor, reasonably priced. I'll be back next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Diggin' this tapas restaurant.  Walked in and it was kinda dark.  Staff was pretty friendly and helpful.  There were 6 of us and we were seated pretty quickly.  We sat at like a big rectangle coffee table with a sectional on one side and a couple of cushioned cubes on the other.  Real casual and relaxing.  Perfect for tapas, sangria, and hanging with the friends.  

We were feeling a good from the sangria.  You have to get this.  We got a couple of pitchers of the red.  It was good.  Real good.  I think too good.  ;)  We knew we wanted to the stuffed dates.  Stuffed with bleu cheese and an almond, wrapped in bacon and drizzled with a red win reduction.  Yeah, we got more than one order.  A lot more.  The rest we just told our server to bring us his favorites.  There was the artichoke toasts which we liked.  The steak and mushroom skewers, nice.  Paella was pretty good.  The Fillet Mignon sliders were not bad but the crispy onion rings on that plate was light, crispy and delicious.  And a lot of others that the sangria made me forget.  

Great place to eat some good food and hang out with your friends.  

Coming back here for sure."}
{"text":"Love the scallops, shrimp a la diabla, cheesy potatoes, ambiance is great and staff is attentive. If you ask for bread it comes with garlic butter."}
{"text":"What can I say... I love this place the Tapas are truly delicious! They are always fresh and quick. My only complaint was the seafood paella. There was a couple muscles that tasted and smelled very foul (not their fault though). I think we may have had a bad batch of muscles. Regardless, they took wonderful care of us. And everything else was on point (as it always is). A few of my favorites are the chicken skewers, the steak and mushroom skewers, firefly fries, Serrano ham sliders, the hot spinach artichoke salad, and the abinadagos (meatballs).  They are meticulous and our servers were always ensuring our glasses were full. My favorite time to go is during happy hour I believe the day time is from 3-5pm and then from 11pm-1am. The pitchers of sangria are $18.... and believe me they are worth every penny. This is one of my favorite spots in the valley!"}
{"text":"All I wanted was a delicious meal. Thanks firefly! ..and lucky me to have stumbled in during happy hour. The albondigas were full of Italian flavor, cheesy and only 4 dollars. Such a steal. I also had the hot spinach salad it was fresh and everything went together perfectly. Lastly, I had the tierra y mar skewers. So much goody on such a small stick. There are so many options that have mbut attention I look forward to revisiting this place. I also tried their berry infused vodka. I dont typically like sweet drinks, but this was smoothe and almost tasted like straight grape juice. Bartenders were nice and attentive."}
{"text":"I don't drink, so since the appeal of this place seems to hang on the Sangria, I can only remark on the food. 

The food itself is fine, but the prices for them brings down the rating for me. 

It seems to be more a place to hang out and spend money with the drinking + social life combo hang out. 

I prefer tapas in the Japanese places around town or dim sum."}
{"text":"Sangria is good, but not the food.  I've been here twice, maybe three times and tried a variety of dishes.  The atmosphere was cool, but maybe I'm not a spanish cuisine person?  My date and friends love this place, so I think you either hate it or love it."}
{"text":"Firefly is yet another Food Fight Inc establishment in Madison, this one catering to the Asian fusion set.  Like all Food Fight Inc. places, the decor seems to have been given a larger budget than the menu.  Anything you can find on the menu here (curries, pad thai, etc..), you can find a better version of at any of Madison's other Thai places.  Skip it and head to Sai Bai Thong down the street."}
{"text":"AMAZING DELICIOUS Seafood Paella!! The only downfall was we didn't see the note on the menu that it took longer  for the paella to come out( I guess for cooking time), so as we ate all the other wonderful scrumptious tapas, we were all stuffed by the time the paella was served. It looked so delicious we all had to try it (stomachs protesting) and man it was soooooo delicious! It was by far the best paella I've eaten. The seafood was not overcooked, rice perfect, wonderful spices! All the tapas we ate were delicious! The staff was very attentive and friendly. My cousin and I even got a 3 piece dessert because it was our birthdays!! Will definitely be coming back here on my next trip to Vegas!"}
{"text":"I love this tapas place. The quality of their food is always really good. What a fun atmosphere with lively music and art. This place can get really busy so definitely come in non peak hours. Their service is good and really quick. We dined for 4 hrs one time, felt no rush.

-Mussels in coconut curry are delicious.
-Summer Salad... The burrata cheese is to DIE for! It literally melts in your mouth, perfect texture and the outside is not overly thick. One of the best burrata cheeses I've ever had. 
-Paella comes in a good portion. Although, I could go with more crunchy toasted rice from the bottom of the pan.
-Sparkling white sangria is so good and refreshing. 
-Baked goat cheese was ehh... Not bad but not that exciting of flavors. 
-Always love the Grilled Veggies in mint sauce."}
{"text":"This place is my new favourite! Every time I pass by this it's always full... and now I know why! Between two we had a pitcher of the white wine sangria (3-4 glasses each), garlic prawns, tempura prawns, steak and mushroom skewers, spinach and pine nut salad and ham and cheese stuffed chiqueto's (I'm sure I'm spelling/pronouncing that wrong) - everything was absolutely delicious! There was a 15 minute wait for a table (Tuesday night) so we just sat at the bar where we received super fast service. All of the above cost just $76, we left with a perfect buzz from the sangria and extremely full bellies. I can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Very small plates. Yes I know it's tapas and in typical Vegas style they are even smaller plates and the drinks are as well. 
 2 sodas
 1 martini
 3 plates
$60"}
{"text":"Ok so here goes...have lived in Vegas for about 5 years now and after all of the word of mouth about Firefly from friends and co-workers, I finally made my first visit to the new Westside location. The crazy thing is that I actually made two separate visits in the same day with different friends, was so not planned that way however this place I could go round the clock! Is just crazy, have never been and then i go twice in one day! lol

Mouth Orgasm at it's best. I seriously sat and moaned for two hours straight, savoring every bite, not sure what the waiter and other patrons thought, so it was either, amused, aroused or annoyed? A tasty explosion in my beautiful mouth no less.

I have to say is really night and day in comparison for my two visits, the first time was at 3pm, only one other patron in the whole restaurant was quiet and we obviously were seated immediately. The next visit was at 8pm, wow a whole other world, we waited about 30 minutes to be seated and the place was packed beyond capacity, lol. I have to say either way it is a fun experience! I have listed the goodies I was able to enjoy during my two visits. Everything was scrumptious!

{"text":"Off the strip and out of this world!  This place is worth the short detour from the strip!  Great outdoor dining and amazing ambience.

Even though they serve tapas the portions are decent size.  Everything  was expertly prepared succulents and delicious. You will not be sorry if you make the trip here.

Save room for the chocolate cherry bread pudding!  Your welcome!!"}
{"text":"Food was okay to better than okay. The main problem, the service was horrible, 30 minutes to get a water after sitting down. A lot of staff standing around for how bad the service was. The busboy was more helpful than our actual waiter. Would I come back... Maybe if someone else was paying."}
{"text":"Yum!  kinda divey but the food was excellent.  I was in town for a conference and I met up with a friend whom I haven't seen in almost 8 years.  So it was cool to catch up and after spending some time at Red Rock Canyon, we decided to grub it up here.
It's a tapas place, and damn I love tapas.  I am all about variety.  Variety is the spice of life as I'm sure you've heard.  I like tapas and small plates in general because you get to try a little bit of everything.  If you really like something, then order more!
Better than buffets, generally, since  the food is made to order.
I specifically remember the ahi tuna dish.  The anchovy bread was also tasty.  Honestly I don't remember everything cause I tend to just order like I'm shooting flies in a barrel.  Is that the correct reference?  I don't remember.

Anyway, if I go back to LV, I'll go back here.  For sure."}
{"text":"Back in town, and made this my dinner stop.  Even on Sundays they're open til 2a.  We ordered the potato brava, their fries, shrimp diablo, the bacon wrapped dates, chicken skewers, and the nutella banana sandwich.  The biggest standout was def the dates!  Just wow, the saltiness of the bacon, sweetness of the date, and the nut in the middle...Nothing I ate here even compares.  The shrimp diablo's sauce was particularly good as well as the nutella banana sandwich....I'd def  order the dessert again.  But the dates were incredible.  Don't come here and not try it."}
{"text":"I love it here!  Great concept.  Small plates and priced reasonably. 

We looked at the pics that other Yelpers had graciously posted and began our tasting session...  My party of 5 loved everything we ordered.  I recommend you try their paella!

Firefly is on a short list of restaurants in Vegas where I will definitely return for repeat visits.

Deservedly so, Firefly was a Reader's Choice selection in the BestofVegas.com awards for 2013."}
{"text":"Maybe I expected too much from this place because of all the great reviews and recommendations  from friends, but I really wasn't impressed.

First of all, their sangria was a huge disappointment. After everyone was saying how good it was, I was really excited to try it. I was let down with a super sour wine that they called sangria. But, I do have to preface this review with the fact that sangria is one of my ultimate favorite drinks and you can get a better sangria than this at one of the upstairs bars at the Venetian.

Second, the food was ok/good but nothing really stood out. Sorry, but I'm in Vegas - I expected better food!"}
{"text":"Servers were really nice, usually restaurants with reputations like Firefly have snobby servers but everyone was really accommodating and nice. The food was great! We tried the Tuna Tartar, Filet Mignon Sliders, Spicy Shrimp, and clams. Everything came out fresh and at perfect temperatures. All of the dishes were perfectly seasoned and I would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"My friends and I decided to have a late dinner after a night of losing money and dignity - firefly definitely made up for our losses 

We all ordered three dishes each and shared it, i recommend trying as many things as you can because I have yet to have anything disappointing. Out of the 12 dishes we got only one was just average (the crispy duck roll) but even that was pretty good. My favorite two dishes of the night had to be the Ham/Cheese croquettes and the Filet Mignon sliders...i'm salivating right now thinking of them."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas.  Prices are reasonable, service is great, and the ambiance is trendy.  Some of the items on the menu to try: Red Sangria, stuffed dates, and crispy duck rolls.  Each of these items is fantastic!  I also recommend the house made infused vodka on the rocks.  A reasonably priced and great tasting drink.  If you are looking for a trendy but unpretentious place off strip to have dinner, I highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Firefly delivers great tapas at a prime location, just off the strip on Paradise Road. Everything on their extensive tapas menu is great. The actual venue is just average, but that is acceptable given the spot-on service and great food. My favorites are the eggplant cannelloni and the dates."}
{"text":"The bacon wrapped dates and Sangria will change your life. Great vibe and lots going on. Usually pretty crowded but worth the wait. Not to mention they're very fairly priced. I will be back again to try more of their endless variety of tapas to choose from!"}
{"text":"You can't go wrong when you're ordering a pitcher of Sangria.

Made a reservation before leaving the house and waltzed right in. Okay, not really, we did have to wait a few minutes because there was a line of people at the host stand, but it wasn't more than 10 minutes before our table was ready. Nahum was our server and he was on point. He checked back often but wasn't overpowering the table and he was SO NICE!

The menu is huge and the plates are tapas style so it's easy to over order. A few highlights for me were the Scallop Escargots with the buttery herb sauce and the Chicago Beef. Oddly, my table mates weren't as big of a fan of the Chicago inspired sandwiches but they are east coasters so perhaps they have more to compare it to. I also loved the Hearts of Palm *Crab* Cakes. They are vegan, so don't expect crab, but I loved the texture and flavor. 

A few misses were the Serrano Ham & Cheese plate and the Seafood Paella. The cheese on the plate was flavorless and the paella was very bland.

The pitcher of red sangria was amazing though and for how busy this place is, the food comes out super fast. This was my second time here and although it's not my favorite spot in Vegas, it's close to my house and worth the price."}
{"text":"OMG the selection and the quality, impeccable.  with service to match!

The EXCELLENT:
- mushroom tart
- steamed mussels
- camarones a la diabla
- scallop escargot
- tuna tartare

The GOOD:
- stuffed dates
- patatas bravas -

The OK:
- tierra y mar skewers
- manchego mac n cheese
- pork Empanada

strawberry mojitos are made with the fruit, however the mango is made with the syrup, per suggeston from our waiter, thank you for the honesty!  the sangria is probably 3 times stronger than the mojitos just to give you an idea though..

wow i would definitely come here again, with a party of 6 or greater so you can all try the different dishes!"}
{"text":"Firefly is a tapas restaurant; I had no idea what that meant the first time I was there.  Upon arrival I realized it was just a punch of small dishes you could order in order to make your perfect meal; Wikipedia has it described as \"are a wide variety of appetizers, or snacks, in Spanish cuisine\"  to make it even more simple let me describe it as delicious! 

Ok so the restaurant itself is a very popular hot spot and parking is tight in their lot. Cross your fingers you get a sport there as you may be in for a walk; inside is just as crowded with the wait staff having to fight through the standing room only bar to bring your food out (bad design in my opinion but allows you to see the delicious food before you order); my 2nd time there the bar was less crowded but was still packed.  The staff is very knowledgeable about their dishes and drinks and were helpful in making suggestions to compliment everything I ordered (I asked them to do this they weren't pushing specials) 

The food was top notch; even though they are small dishes they still have enough to share between two people.  My first trip had a party of 15 people and our total bill was around $170 (minus drinks) so everything is reasonably priced. 
On my 2nd trip my GF and I discovered they have a 2nd dining area in an adjacent store; not sure if that is why the bar wasn't crowded or if we just happened to miss a happy hour but there was virtually no difference between the two buildings and don't think you are being downgraded by being asked to walk next door to sit down;"}
{"text":"Bomb dot com!! Good food good drinks and live Latin music! Super hip, super trendy and good vibes!! Good for groups. Good for dates. Good for a big ass group of dates! Haha! Salsa dancers come and get down!!"}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Firefly and have yet to have a bad experience. I tried the tomato bisque soup for the first time, and DAMN i have been missing out! It was delicious!! Bacon wrapped dates, ham and cheese croquetas are a must! All the sangrias are yummy too. The service is fast and attentive. Even when the restaurant is packed and there is a line out the door, the servers are attentive and don't rush you to eat and leave. Both locations are amazing!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, great atmosphere, good service and below average bloody Mary's. Try the stuffed dates!"}
{"text":"When it comes to tapas in Las Vegas, no one comes close to FireFly on Paradise. From the Sangria to the stuffed dates to the lines that stretch out into the parking lot, you will known when you have arrived at Las Vegas's best kept secret. 

Personal favorites are: 
-Pitchers of Red Sangria (If you order one for yourself, make sure you have a taxi standing by :)
-Stuffed dates
-Shrimp Diablas
-Empanadas 
-Pretty much the rest of the menu

The only thing I have to warn everyone about is that this place can become very busy at night and especially on the weekends. Plan ahead with reservations or try and grab a seat at the bar. If you do end up having to wait, grab a drink and enjoy the energy that flows through the restaurant as the night goes on."}
{"text":"Oh man.... this new building and location is amazing. It's huge! Relative to the old location that they had overgrown years ago, this place is the size of Costco. But the best thing is their food is still nothing short of Yelp 5-star quality. Service is solid to! While I do miss the old location in terms of number of parking spots and small cozy feel, this place is much more suited to the amount of volume they do."}
{"text":"Went here for a friend's bachelor party and we were rolling pretty deep (like 20 of us).  I was appointed to order for the table and was very glad to.  We got 13 different tapas (3-4 sets of each) and some paella.  The paella was OK.  If you get it, get the seafood one.  I've had some pretty good paella and it set the bar really high.

Make sure to start with their Sangria (I got the red).  It was delicious!  They say they marinate it for a minimum of 3 days and it definitely shows.  So smooth and bomb.

Pros:
+ Restaurant had a nice ambiance
+ Friendly staff (the owner came out and even bought us a couple rounds of drinks for the bachelor party).
+ Waiter was knowledgeable about the food
+ Huge selection of tapas to choose from (could make things difficult)

Cons:
- Not exactly on the strip, but worth it for a nice dinner.

Food highlights:
+ SCALLOPS \"ESCARGOTS\" - these scallops were amazing!!  My favorite dish here!!!  They were cooked in the escargots container thing and the garlic herb butter hit the spot so well.  Definitely get this!!
+ MANCHEGO MAC 'N' CHEESE - super cheesy but very delicious.  Can never go wrong with mac n cheese
+ CHORIZO CLAMS - clams with chorizo in a sweet and salty sauce.  I believe it came from the clams and the the chorizo.
+ Lamb skewers - tender and did not have a gamey taste to it
+ CAMARONES A LA DIABLA - big shrimps cooked to perfection. nice and crunchy with a sweet and spicy chili sauce that complemented it very well.
+ STUFFED DATES - bacon wrapped dates... crispy bacon wrapped with dates inside.
+ TIERRA Y MAR SKEWERS - shrimp, filet mignon, chorizo sausage.  AWESOME COMBO!!! enough said.

I'd definitely come back to this place.  Just make sure to come with a decent crowd so you can order a bunch of tapas.

Here's a pic of our group:

{"text":"Went back a second time a few weeks later, and unfortunately it wasn't as good as the first visit.  The service from our main server was very impersonal and infrequent (although another person who was mostly serving drinks and floating around the whole room was very friendly and helpful).  Also, the food seemed less well flavored and presented.  Perhaps the kitchen staff was different that night.

I would try it a third time, but I would lower my expectations a bit."}
{"text":"Hands down, this is the best tapas place in Vegas...maybe even the best I've ever had!  This was our second time eating here and it never disappoints!  The food plates are small enough that you can sample a variety of things, and boy, do they have a variety!  Here's what we've ordered thus far:
- Stuffed dates (bacon wrapped, 'nuff said!)
- Manchego Mac n Cheese (can't get enough of this stuff!)
- Chicken and Chorizo Stuffed Mushrooms (simply delish!)
- Fried Calamari (can't go wrong with this)
- Ahi Tuna Skewer (the ahi was seared just right and the mangos were an awesome addition)

Even writing this review, I'm starting to crave the tapas and want more.  Unfortunately it's only in Vegas.  This is definitely a new staple for us and we'll be coming here for a long time!  It's also nice that it's off the strip so if you want some down time from all the glitz of Vegas, this is a great place to chill!"}
{"text":"For sure get the dates wrapped in bacon they are delishhhhhh!!!! I was here with a large group this weekend, we enjoyed every single thing we ordered!! I cant remember the names of everything because we also had pitchers of sangria, but let me try, there were mushrooms stuffed with chorizo and chicken they were so good! And then all the skewers were good, we had chicken and lamb. The bread they serve you before the meal is also yummy! I will definitely eat at Firefly next time I am in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I came here wanting to try a really good tapas restaurant and ever since , trying to find one to compare has been difficult back home. Their Manchego Mac n' Cheese is a must because something about that cheese gives it that extra \"mmph\" in your mouth. You should definitely try their patatas bravas as well, they are different from your regular french fries because they are cut into cubes or thicker pieces and then cooked until the potatoes are crispy on the edges and soft on the insides, spiced with good seasoning and drizzled in creamy aioli. Service was great as well. I'm just hoping my visit to Vegas will be very soon so that I could update my review for this place."}
{"text":"Amazing food, wonderful service, great atmosphere, interesting dish variety.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"My whole family went there for 'something different\" and we will be back!

Gourmet quality tapas, great for sharing!   The plates look small, but you wouldn't believe that it can fill you up!  Almost everything was gourmet quality, enticing presentation, and top notch in flavor.

Their signature dish is the stuffed dates, and they were to die for!  One of the best things I've ever eaten in LV.! Our only disappointment was the duck.  It wasn't bad, just not that good.

Our group of 4 hungry people was there on a Friday night, and even though we ordered booze and some of the more pricey items on the menu (including lobster), our bill managed to stay @ $110.

The only complaint from our table is that they don't have a location in Pasadena (yet), where my family were visiting from.."}
{"text":"Went here for a bachelorette dinner and I must say that the food, ambience and MOJITOS were to die for!

I looved this place ! ! Tapas style plates that were delicious ! ! Try the fish sticks with their special lemon sauce - yummy! And their mushroom tart melted in your mouth!!  But my favorite thing I ordered were the filet mignon sliders!!!!  2 mini burgers served with crunchy onions on the side and  special sauce! ! I could've just had these but my eyes were hungrier than my stomach...I had to try as much as I could!

I think Firefly's served the best mojito I've ever had..for reals because it was tasty!  Between all us girls, we shared 2 pitchers..we had to get the party started because we were heading to Olympic Gardens afterwards..haha!!!

The atmosphere was great with close friends, yummy  mojitos and delicious food!"}
{"text":"On one of our annual trips to Vegas to visit my mom, my husband and I stayed at the Platinum one night (great!), and had lunch at Firefly.  My girlfriend had been urging me for several years to go to Firefly, so I finally had an opportunity.  Very friendly service, no complaints about our waiter.  It was a weekday so the only folks there were from the local area on their lunch break, no wait at all.  

We ordered at least one tapas from each section of the menu.  The only dish I would say I was a little disappointed in was the Tuna Tartare, it was cut a little thick for my taste, and as a whole it was kind of blah, for me at least.  The duck rolls and the filet mignon sliders were delicious.  The fresh bread and almond butter they bring to the table is really really good btw (crushed almonds mixed into the butter).

The highlight of the meal was dessert.  Since we were there for lunch we were supposed to get ice creams or something as part of a lunch special, but they were out, so they let us pick a dish off the menu.  We chose the Banana-Nutella Sandwiches.  It took our breath away!  Unlike anything we have ever had before.  Splendiferous.  I totally recommend that even if you don't have a meal here and just want to get a cup of coffee and dessert, this would be the dish to get!  Trust me on this one.

We will definitely be back.  Great meal overall."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the food and drinks. the patio was nice and service was good. will definitely be back. place looks like its very popular."}
{"text":"This place is mouthwateringly great! All the good things I've heard and read on about this place is nothing but all true! You have to come check it out yourself really to judge it but I can promise you won't be disappointed at all! Great atmosphere great food great drinks and most of all service is absolutely impeccable! Will be back in the future!"}
{"text":"This is definitely a trendy spot with lots of people watching opportunities. My wife and I liked it but the service was a bit slow. We sat on a couch with a low coffee table to eat from. It was cool, like hanging out at home with a bunch of strangers and your buddy cooking food that is good but comes at an unpredictable pace."}
{"text":"It took me a year to finally try this spot out! Ended up going here because wicked spoon is lame and closes at 2p n reopens at 5p -_- still love wicked spoon tho, but my sister told me over a year ago to eat at firefly. From the time she told me about it to the time I actually went I had been to vegas SIX times.  I thought by the time I actually tried Firefly I would be like \"ehh its ok\" coz I have been anticipating it for so long, but boy was I wrong. I ordered 4 tapas for myself. I got the ham and cheese croquette, firefly fries, sirloin burgers, and bacon wrapped dates. All were delicious. Apparently bacon wrapped dates are supposed to be the sh.t but when I tried, it was OK, kinda salty. If you want to try it share with 2 or 3 other people. Firefly is not too far away from the strip so you dont have to be concerned about sky high taxi fare. I really wish we had a fire fly in the bay but it gives me another reason to fly out to vegas!"}
{"text":"Mmmm . . .  I gotta say, this is good tapas and the pitcher of mojitos hit the spot. In fact, it hit the spot so well, I can't remember everything I ordered. 

The bacon wrapped dates are not to be missed. I also loved the mac n cheese (tasty, slightly crunchy). The pork empanadas were good too.  The duck rolls, however, were gamey (hey, it was duck), and as others noted below, the mushroom puffs were underwhelming.

We ate way too many (tapas creep up on you like that). 

We got there around 4 pm on a Friday and there was still room at the bar (though we didn't sit at the bar). I would go for the patio since the restaurant itself is so unassuming. 

This is no Lotus of Siam (as a Vegas culinary experience, LOS sets the standard for me), but it's great at what it does and tasty as hell. Servers and service were excellent. 

And if you want to keep the fun going, and walk off those mojitos, you can walk around the corner on Twain to the friendly gay bar, the Funhog Ranch!!! I'm just saying . .."}
{"text":"I love this place. I just moved here from SF and I was wondering if i would find a chill local bar/lounge near me to hangout and relax with friends. It's within walking distance. I'm stoked. I had the Crab Leg Corn Dogs, Duck Rolls and a pitcher of Sangria with a friend of mine. 

I'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Off-strip, but a quick drive/cab ride. Happy hour is a great deal.

Not particularly fancy, but reliable well-priced small plates. Pretty much everything is good, fantastic cocktails, and beautiful covered patio. I'm a big fan."}
{"text":"Loved everything here.  Excellent service all around, atmosphere was decent, lots of people talking, enjoying themselves.

The food was the best part, my favorite being the stuffed dates.  I could eat  a dozen or two of these.  It's a must order, and probably a reorder.

Also, not to be missed is the chocolate 3 leches cake, I hated to share this.  My lovely friends were lucky to not have been stabbed by my fork.

Next time in Vegas, this place is on the itinerary."}
{"text":"A team favorite! Great for large groups. The food is fast and delicious. There is something for everyone."}
{"text":"What can I say in this review that has not been said?? Lets see...JUST GO TRY ONE OF THE BEST DAMN TAPA SPOTS IN VEGAS! AND STOP READING THESE REVIEWS BEFORE YOU MISS OUT! asswipe"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to try Firefly because we were in the area looking for brunch. We found out brunch is only on Sunday's but they made up for it. We ordered the fire fly fries to start, chicken skewers and the Tierra y Mar. Both were excellent! The chicken was fabulous and had so much flavor. The fries were delicious as well. Our server, Nahum was very helpful in offering suggestions. The atmosphere is relaxing and pleasant. Reasonably priced for the quality of food. Very impressed, will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"We are visiting from out of town and this place was great.   Food was superb.  We ordered six different items and they were all excellent.  There was a 30 minute wait so we ended up sitting at the bar.  Servers were on itn. Very helpful and the food came out quickly.   Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Firefly has always been a favorite of mine but we recently had our after wedding dinner there and it was incredible. Fernanda was the banquet contact and she made it so easy and was so flexible with our changes. Manuel and Omar took care of us once we arrived. My only criticism might be they did their jobs too well. The tapas came out very quick and everything tasted amazing! They were also great with the bar service. I couldn't have asked for a better place to host all of our family and friends."}
{"text":"This restaurant is completely amazing! The selection and portion of food is perfect, sometimes you go to tapa's places you get A shrimp with your order or if you are vegetarian there aren't any options. At Firefly they have it all- Seafood, Beef, Chicken, Pork, Veggie. . .Some of my favorites are Chorizo Stuffed Mushrooms, Warm Spinach Salad, Stuffed Dates (TO DIE FOR), Diablo Shrimp-Truly have never had anything bad there. 

Also, the Sangria and Mojito's are phenomenal, but I will have to say, they made a damn good Dirty Martini!  Great place for a date, girls night out or starting point for a night out on the Las Vegas Strip. . . . Get there early though it get's busy!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were in Vegas in October and couldn't wait to go back to 
Firefly! When we heard they shut down we were so bummed. I just loved the atmosphere at the old location. We always take our friends  whenever were in town. I dream about the pardon peppers and bacon wrapped dates. We had no problem getting a table around 8:30 or so on a Monday night. The new place seemed almost bare it's so much bigger. We sat across from the kitchen next to each other looking into the kitchen thru the swinging door. Not what  we had in mind . I hate being to close to the kitchen traffic. We decided to move to the bar. It's a really nice addition. We were the only ones at the bar when we sat down. By the time we left it was 3/4 full. Restaurant appreciation night I believe. We always order red sangria but heard the white was really good. Our bartender offered to let us sample it . We still went with red. 2 of us will down a pitcher!  We are in Vegas you know! We were brought some yummy bread and omg! That butter is the best stuff ever! I forgot about the butter!  We ordered our usual , 1 order of bacon wrapped dates, then pardon peppers, such wonderful chile flavor not spicy a little salty, I believe they are flash fried, but I think the order was a little smaller than it use to be. They are so addictive. I found 1 place in Denver to get them but not the same  restaurant vibe. We decide we need more dates and then the cream cheese stuffed peppers. The sauce and cheese and peppers! Yum! Our bartender told us about the garbanzo beans. We had never had them roasted in the shell before. We liked them.  And then more stuffed peppers! That was our fav. Dinner in Vegas as always. Just sit and graze. Every bite was a party in my mouth! The bartenders were on top of the water and plates and very friendly. The manager stopped to see how everything was and we chatted for quite a while.  He was eager to hear our comments. When he found out we were in the bar biz in Denver he even gave us the locals discount! That was a really nice thing for him to do. I can't remember names as it's been too long. I should have written this sooner.  But life happens.  The food is as good as ever at the new location.  The atmosphere in the dining room I'm not sure I'm sold on. Something's missing. The kitchen really stands out too much. It's just really open for everyone to see. I missed the intimacy of the old place. Will we be back? Absolutely! If it's warmer I'm looking foreword to sitting on the patio! You guys do a great job!"}
{"text":"Tapas + Paella + Sangria = Recipe for a Successful Soirée in Sin City.  Having said that, I did walk in with some level of expectation as I am a huge, huge fan of Spanish cuisine.

DECOR: Contemporary, Artsy, Tall ceiling created an open space feel while dimmed lighting dominated the entire venue, in fact, reading the menu was somewhat difficult but manageable, LCD TVs at the bar!

VIBE: Cool and Energetic, Loud music played throughout the Evening, Hustle and Bustle from the Staff

DRINKS: Red Sangria had that great balance of fruit and wine which resulted in a very tasty concoction you would expect, so good we ordered 2 pitchers! 

FOOD: The sweet, nutty ALMOND BUTTER that came with the COMPLIMENTARY bread was OUTSTANDING! 

**TAPAS- incredible flavors and texture for just about everything we ordered, from the FILET MIGNON to the Eggplant, the STEW with thin, Toasty Bread was delicious, the EMPANADAS came out crispy and full of porky flavors

**PAELLA- Packed with all sorts of MEAT and SEAFOOD, I could not find a single complaint about the tenderness and flavors of each element in that regard.  The RICH SAUCE that encompassed every single solid object in that sizzling, hot pan was very HEAVY but not overwhelming, the RICE was cooked PERFECTLY, however I typically prefer my rice to be fluffier but for an $18 Paella, it did its job, as far as I am concerned! 

SERVICE: The only complaint I have was it was somewhat slow at times when trying to get some attention for more bread or water or just ordering more food.  Our server was doing his best but I can sympathize with the overwhelming demand and service at this particular night.  We had to wait 40 minutes to finally get a table, so I can understand that, perhaps they were understaffed? 

Due to the quality and price of the food, I was able to overlook the slow service and grant Firefly it into my Vegas Hall of Fame!"}
{"text":"I am not quite sure how this plays get so many high reviews I definitely know that a lot of my friends liked it it was probably my very first experience with Tapas
 We ordered several dishes one that particularly was delicious with the fags but I know we ordered multiple items I wasn't too crazy about the place because of the menu but I know that I hated the location I think that's the worst part but at least there is parking 
And the service was definitely good
It's not a place that I would visit on a regular basis"}
{"text":"Very tasty food, and great service. Portions are a bit larger than most tapas, and each new dish prompted me to try another."}
{"text":"I loved everything about this place from the moment we walked in.  Excellent atmosphere, food and service.  Every plate we ordered was AMAZING - stuffed dates, meat and shrimp skewers, filet sliders, and mac n cheese (very very rich - forewarning).  The drinks were unique and excellent too.  But the service was so stellar that even if the food would have been halfassed it would have still been the best place we ate at in Vegas. From our waiter to the bartenders to the manager - classy and friendly and perfect.   It's a nice break from the strip for a couple hours - just don't walk it from there unless you are down for a 1/2 hour walk (from Planet Hollywood area).  Walk/cab/drive - GO."}
{"text":"Food was quite good here, service was ok but nothing special. We got stuck in the drafty porch corner and seemed to get overlooked by servers a lot so it took awhile to get drinks. I'd give it another shot though next time i'm in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"The steak skewers are very rich tasting.

The caramel flan was delicious. 

Pricey but an interesting array of flavors that will quench your overall cravings."}
{"text":"OMG~ DELICIOUS!!!!!!!

After attending my cousin's White Coat ceremony for  Touro University at Rio Hotel, we ate dinner at Firefly's.  As we waited for our waiter, we were given bread and butter.  I don't know what the butter was made out of but it was so good!  Now,  onto the REALLY GOOD stuff.

This is what we ordered:

*Apple and Manchego salad - GOOD
Green apple, manchego cheese, smoked almonds

*Tuna Tartare - If you've tried Wolfgang Puck's Tuna Tartare, Firefly's comes in a close second
Marinated ahi tuna, avocado, taro chips

*Tuna Peppers - DELICIOUS
Smoked yellowfin tuna salad, stuffed in marinated peppers

*Tomato-Basil Soup - Tomato soup was good but if you dip the brie in the soup, it tastes a little funky
Tomato soup with mini grilled brie sandwich

*Veggie Empanada - OK
Spinach, mushroom, artichoke, herbed cream cheese, red pepper aioli

*Thai Beef Salad - I've had better at Coconut Bay or Presidente
Seared beef, thai dressing, romaine, tomato, cucumber, giner

*Baked Filets of tilapia - SO GOOD
Marinated with herbs, lemon, garlic

*Chicken Skewers - YUMMY
Marinated chicken, tomato, roast garlic cream

*Crispy Duck Roll - I'm not much of a duck fan so I didn't try but everyone else loved it
Cherry hoisin sauce

*Tierra y Mar Skewers - OK, Meat was kind of hard to pull off the skewer
Grilled shrimp, filet mignon, chorizo sausage, salsa verde

*Filet Sliders - DELICIOUS
Mini burgers with Serrano ham, cabrales cheese, caramelized onions

*Ceviche of Shrimp
Tiger shrimp, avocado, crispy corn tortillas

*Babyback Ribs - GOOD - Meat slides right off the bone
Mango BBQ sauce

*Camarones Ajillo - GOOD
Shrimp in lemon-garlic butter sauce

Unfortunately, despite eating all of the glorious food, I had a stomach ache and had diarrhea.  However, I would eat Firefly's and experience diarrhea again.  I think it's worth it.  =)

The total amount was $104.32.  Not bad at all.  We split the tapas between five people and we came out stuffed."}
{"text":"Delicious! If you're looking for something to wake up your taste buds you must go here. We've been here several times and enjoy many of the different tapas. I suggest trying the croquets, bacon wrapped stuffed dates, manchego Mac and cheese, albondigas, & empanadas. Those are just a few of the amazing dishes they have. They are priced just right for all the food and have excellent atmosphere."}
{"text":"Cam here with some friends and enjoyed myself. It was a huge group but the service was great and the sangria was bomb! I love that they keep it flowing like water. The bacon wrapped dates are always a treat! Definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"I have to be honest, I wasn't super excited to go to a tapas restaurant but my friends insisted. It was a good decision!

The wait wasn't too long and the service was phenomenal. The best part is that both the inside and outside seating are smoke free. To be full, you are looking at about $25-30/person.

Some highlights: bacon wrapped dates, paella, tuna tartar, octopus, and the chorizo clams."}
{"text":"Really good food. Came with a groupon( 30 for 50) We ordered the Garden Variety Salad, Spanish tortilla, fries, meatballs, ribs, chicken skewer, pork empanada and garlic shrimp.  They forgot to bring us the ribs, but we were so full by the time everything else came that we just didn't say anything.  The salad was very good, very refreshing.  I'd totally get a salad here because you need the acidity of the dressings to break up the other proteins you order.  The sauce on the tortilla was WAY too spicy for me.  I had to send it back and have them remake it.  The shrimp were too spicy as well, but I just picked off the red flecks of pepper and that was ok. 

The service was good, if not a little rushed.  There was no rhyme or reason to the way the dishes came out.  We didn't drink so can't comment on that, but the food was great.  The complimentary bread was delicious too."}
{"text":"My next trip to Vegas I am definately coming back here! The food was delicious, the Sangria was the BEST, and it was cheap! 

I don't entirely remembered what we ordered after the Sangria's, but the filet mignon sliders were awesome, tuna tartare was tasty, tomato basil soup was good, and much more but I don't really remember. 

Overall experience: *****"}
{"text":"Not bad.  I'll have to admit I don't get the appeal of Tapas, but the food was more than serviceable.  

Major complaint would be how the food came out from the kitchen.  No real rhyme or reason as to how it arrived at our table of 7."}
{"text":"Despite all the issues this establishment has had historically it has never failed to deliver when I've gone. I usually start off with a mojito but last night switched to mescal mule, it was delicious and hit the spot. Also steering away from ordering the usual chorizo and clams, we ordered the ham and manchango plate, scallops, tuna skewers, and apple and manchango salad. All were spot on and would order them all again. The scallops were decadent!  Love this place!"}
{"text":"Immediate outdoor seating with heat lamps, casual atmosphere, friendly prompt service (with rapid water refills), ample parking, dim suburban lounge atmosphere. Would not have found this place without Yelp! The icing on the cake was the affordable small-plates with a Spanish \"influence\" (although, that may be a bit far fetched):

Patatas Bravas: huge plate of roasted potatoes with aioli sauce. Very filling.
Stuffed dates with bacon, easily the best tapas we had. Four dates total.
Lentils with vegetables: Just OK; prepped very \"clean\" without much oil.
Warm spinach salad: again, just OK; tastes exactly how it sounds.
Tomato soup with brie sandwich: not bad, the sandwich was rather plain but the soup was just right for a cool November evening. 
Sangria: surprisingly good; sparkling white wine with blueberries and mangoes. 

Starter: crusty baguette with garlic and honey butter. The honey butter really complimented; the baguette was just OK.

Total bill, $48 + tip.

If you care to venture off the strip, this place is definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"Still the place to go. Food & Service at the bar are great! We love the ambience and has nice music.
The dates have always been my favorite and my girl loves the scallops. Finish the night with chocolate tres leches!"}
{"text":"Firefly is a great place for tapas and drinks! They're famous for their red sangria so I recommend getting a pitcher of that. It's my go-to drink! I have been here so many times and I just haven't gotten a chance to write a review. I order probably 6-7 dishes every time I'm here. My top favorites so far are their bacon wrapped dates, mushroom tart, tierra y mar skewers, scallop \"escargots\", steak&mushroom skewers, and their camarones a la diabla. The bacon wrapped dates is a nice blend of sweet and salty, with a dash of creaminess from the cheese crumbles. I can have all 5 to myself, honestly. The mushroom reminds me of cream of mushroom soup over puff pastries. It's so delicious! The tierra y may skewers is a little bit of everything from shrimp, chorizo, and I think some beef. The scallop \"escargots\" are exactly what they sound like, they're scallops made how escargots are normally made on the escargot platter with the butter herbs. The butter herbs is so delicious. After eating all the scallops, I enjoy dipping my bread in the butter. For the steak and mushrooms, it's steak and mushrooms! How can you go wrong with that. The camarones a la diabla are shrimps in a somewhat sweet and spicy sauce. It's to die for. I also love dipping my bread in the sauce. Maybe the only reason that I don't write this review is because it makes me hungry! Haha.
 
The service is very subpar. In all honestly, they should just hire more employees because it takes long to get your order in, to get more orders, to get a refill or anything. Plus the guys are not very pleasant, but oh wells! Can't expect 5 start service from such a busy place. Parking sucks so maybe just bring a couple dollars for the valet? And it's a very noisy atmosphere so don't expect to go here for a quiet dinner. Definitely try this place out."}
{"text":"Going by Yelp reviews. We chose this restaurant. We had a wonderful dinner & great loud & happening atmosphere. We love tapas and this place has something for everyone, even the in-laws who had never been to a tapas place. I definitely recommend this place. Thanks for great time & dinner while visiting Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Off the strip and I got to give up the props. Trendy, clean and priced right. Tapas and cocktails after work are just the ticket for locals or just a great place to visit for out of towners. Full bar for cooling off. I ordered the old fashion.. one of the best I've had. Great for a date, with friends or family. Noise level is about a 7 on a scale of 1-10, music is modern but no rap, rock or country. Great place, I recommend it."}
{"text":"Disappointed.  I had such high expectations for this place and the food was just OK at best.  

The bacon wrapped dates was the best item that we had and even then, it was super oily.  Everything was just way too greasy and salty.  On the bright side, the portions and prices were reasonable ($5-15 plate). Parking is easy and service is pleasant."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Me and my husband went here for an early dinner one week and were so happy with the service the food and even the prices. A friend was telling me how this restaurant was once shut down for health violations but don't panic its under new ownership :) 

Our waitress was a super friendly women who checked in on us often and let us order as we go. Not something I recommend if your really hungry, the food did take a little longer coming out then I had hoped.

And its best to come with friends and share you plate.

But I do recommend that you order the desert platter its to die for!"}
{"text":"First time at this particular location. It's a great place for small or large parties for drinks and light bites. I'm always a fan of their tapas. 

Some of my favorites include the macaroni & cheese, padron peppers, bacon wrapped dates (these weren't as good as before, hopefully just an off night) and the shrimp diablo. 

On this particular location we brought my friend's 3 year old daughter. Not the greatest location for kids, but we were running out of options and this was a good alternative. The staff was very accommodating and it ended up being a fantastic evening.

Good company helps, so I highly recommend this place for groups."}
{"text":"I heart tapas and I heart Firefly. 

I don't go nearly as often as I feel I should. Can't get enough of this place. We had another get together here with some friends and had yet another fantastic evening. I love almost everything on the menu. The lamb skewers are always cooked perfectly. The dates are to die for. We ordered some other of our favorites; pitchers of blood orange mojitos, patron peppers, mac n cheese and some tortilla espanola. Yum, yum and more yum. 

Can't get enough of this place. Still need to try the location on Sahara, though."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in town. This location's even better than the original. Great view, great service, great food and great drinks. A magical combination. 

I always get the bacon wrapped dates, they're perfection. I thoroughly enjoy the shishito peppers and lamb skewers as well. I haven't had a single dish that I haven't enjoyed here. Definitely a favorite in town! This place is great for groups, parties, anniversaries, birthdays, any occasion really. 

I'd recommend making a reservation for larger parties, especially on the weekends!"}
{"text":"Firefly gets a 5 star for its combination of great menu that is approachable to both vegetarians and meat eaters alike and also for its atmosphere.

Don't miss the gazpacho!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places! It's tapas so it's a fun small plate to try different things and share. The pomegranate mojitos are my favorite drink, why get a glass when the pitcher is cheaper! The stuffed mushrooms with chorizo are amazing. I also have never liked blue cheese but being stuffed in the dates is a whole new spin and melts in your mouth. The paella is also very delicious with many ingredients but it does take a while to cook so order first. Latin night is always a good experience and can't wait to go back. The almond butter served with bread is unbelievable."}
{"text":"barely a 3 if that... yelpers dunno what's up with all the high reviews

tapas bar with bar tasting food. i used to live in spain so i love tapas. i expected so much from this place with all the great reviews.

bread with tomato jamon serrano and machego cheese, the quality of the jamon here sucks, the bread was soggy by the time i actually got it because they at first forgot the ham and cheese, then they came back with just cheese, then had to go back for the jamon.. boo

jamon and machego cheese plate was a disappointment, the ham is poorly sliced  (too thick) and  like a said earlier low quality

tortilla espanola, dry without flavor, like they made it a long time ago and just had it sitting out, sauce was weird

patata bravas were good, nothing noteworthy
 camarones al ajillo actually the best thing we ordered
ribs with mango sauce... my friends liked it but i didn't
filet with mushrooms, not bad nothing special

hugely disappointed with this meal, i skipped dessert, left hungry with lots of food on the table. they kept bringing the food out really quickly that we ran out of space on our table, plates were hanging off the sides of the table. you would think that either #1 the waiter would tell us we ordered too much or #2 they would bring things out a a slower pace than 3 plates at a time."}
{"text":"Firefly is a sexy tapas joint if there ever was one.  Never mind the awful parking situation and the strip mall location.  Once you are inside, the mood lighting and kitchen aromas will overpower your senses and transport you to a happy place.

We tried several dishes, with the star of the night for me being the camarones a la diabla - five small, but succulent, shrimp in the tastiest sauce imaginable.  Once the shrimp were gone, we were sopping up the sauce with anything we could find on the table.  Other table favorites included the Serrano sliders and the manchego mac and cheese.

It's nice that they serve complimentary garlic bread, as my daughter went through an entire plate of that by herself (and she is no big eater).  

Whenever eating tapas, I must eat the patatas bravas.  It is kind of my measure of a great tapas place.  These were not my absolute favorite (those being at Cafe Iberico in Chicago), but they were good enough to keep shoveling them in my mouth.  

Firefly was not my initial pick, but I am glad I agreed to try it out.  I had a great time and they will now be on my Vegas list permanently.

NOTE: Their happy hour is great.  1/2 price Sangria (3.50) is a little weak, but delicious!"}
{"text":"Ok let's get one thing straight when it comes to dining you look for 3 main things to make your experience pleasurable- 1) service, 2) food, and 3) atmosphere! Sometimes one may totally overshadow the other so that nothing can really help it. That is what happened when I visited here to celebrate my friends birthday. Walking into this place it was dark but lively. The hostess were friendly and sat me right away. Be warned Saturday night was busy and they don't take reservations so FCFS. Well Jorge came by and got me started on the Watermelon Mojito (eh, not bad). We ordered the Petit Filet, Duck Roll, Ahi Tartare, Ceviche, and the mixed Paella. Believe me for two people this was way too much but it was necessary. All the tapas we ordered were delicious. The seafood was fresh, hot plates were hot. My favorite had to be the Filet Mignon as it was tender and juicy plus I loved the sides it came with-spinach and potatoes. Everything came out quick too, except the Paella but that takes awhile. While we were eating our tapas the hostess approached us bc she needed our table for a big party. Like who does that!? We were a little taken aback but we said ok. When our server came back to move us I asked if they normally do this and he said they have a few times? What? I've worked in restaurants for over 10 yrs and we have never done that. So we move and we are at a loss for words. We had a momentum of gabbing and it was lost not to mention ppl watching us move. Anyways the manager on duty, I think his name was Carlos, came by to apologize and took care of us but still it was awkward. The Paella finally came and it was enormous! It could feed six ppl. It was very tasty.  We also had the white and red sangria, both were good but I preferred the white. It was like alcoholic apple juice. For dessert we had the tarts which were the size of dollar coins but just enough for us since we were stuffed from dinner. So food was on point. Atmosphere was loud and dim, next time we'll eat in the bar. And Jorge was nice, knowledgable and attentive. But that game of musical chairs while we were eating was no bueno!"}
{"text":"Hard to rate
Food 3
Service 4
Location 0 unless you count the cheese factor then it's a 5

Pitcher of red sangria- good
Chicken salad- not so much
Bacon wrapped dates- burnt bacon
Stuffed peppers- good
Thai beef salad- good
Beet salad- simple but very good
Mac n cheese- how can you go wrong with cheese over pasta? Good
Chicken and chorizo stuffed mushrooms- nasty
Camarones Diabla- this was my favorite dish all due to the sauce
Crispy duck roll- it was ok but better covered with the Diabla sauce

The result is definitely an adventure. Had I not seeked this place out, I would have refused to come. The Plaza Hotel is run down and getting to the restaurant through the lobby was confusing. Once inside the view up Freemont Street was good. The food was better than expected too. All and all, it's no place to impress with all the 5 star, celebrity chef, over the top dining experiences in Las Vegas but there's something about Firefly you need to see for yourself. 

Hard to say if I'll ever go back but I'm glad I went. You should try it once."}
{"text":"The chicken empanadas are so good! The place itself is a bit small and the ceilings are low which make it very loud inside. We could barely hear each other talk but the food was good!"}
{"text":"We were invited by friends for dinner (party of 6 for tapas and drinks) We were seated right away. Our friends chose to sit on the patio, so I didn't get to see the inside. The patio faces a busy 6 lane roadway with no real view, and no garden between you and the street, only the sidewalk. The waiter never brought my drink. We ordered loads of tapas to share which ranged in price from $8 to $12. The dated wrapped in bacon with blue cheese were delicious, but overcooked. The steak and mushroom skewers were such a disappointment - ordered medium - they were tough and were fat and gristle, so we left them uneaten. The calamari was good, the roasted vegetables were mushy and flavorless, the veggie empanadas were forgettable but served on a nice bed of greens that we all enjoyed. Then there was the ribeye steak - we ordered it medium rare, but it was so rare no one ate it and the steak knife they served it with wouldn't cut the steak! The shrimp tempura, the shaved steak sandwiches and the big pasta bowl were the favorites. The shrimp tempura had enough shrimp for 5 to taste and also was on a pile of vegetables tempura that were delicious. The steak on the sandwiches was hot and tender, served on delicious fresh rolls, with a chopped cold vegetable relish topping and we cut them into 4 generous servings. The pasta was angel hair with a red sauce that was just spicy enough to perk up the taste buds without burning them. The food was served hot as each dish is brought out as it is ready, so no one really ate at the same time.  Plates were not cleared, so we ended up with piles of plates, and they never offered us clean tasting plaes. Our friends had a pitcher of peach sangria, which they reported was delicious. I was in it for the company, and some of the food was good, but I have no desire to return."}
{"text":"I love love love tapas and am a new fan of Firefly.  

1. Gather a group of friends
2. Order a pitcher of sangria
3. Order everything that your heart desires
4. Taste a little bit of everything
5. Order more sangria
6. Take notes so you know what dishes to order and what to avoid next time. 
7. Top off the meal with dessert and more sangria!

With so many tapas options on the menu- there will obviously be some hits and misses.  Personally, there were a lot more hits- including:
- Bacon wrapped dates: sweet, salty, bacony- always a hit
- Manchego mac n cheese: one of the best mac n cheeses I've ever had
- Artichoke toast: hearts, basil, aioli, pepper- perfect blend of flavors
- Petit filet (medium): very tender, but the mushrooms and red wine sauce were my favorite part.    
- Tierra y Mar skewers: shrimp, filet mignon, and sausage on a skewer. Delish.  But, order your filet, medium. 
- Steak and mushroom skewers- another hit
- Camarones al ajillo- recommended by our waiter was the star of the meal!
- Chocolate tres leches and the Cherry bread pudding were both decadent desserts and will definitely order again. 

The items that I can do without the next time:
- Tuna tartare and the Shrimp ceviche were both missing something (maybe salt?)
- Firefly fries- if you don't mind your fries soggy- then you will enjoy Firefly's version.  I prefer mine more crispy which is why this didn't appeal to me. The aioli was tasty though. 

And of course, the sangria and the mojitos were faaaaabulous. But, that may also be because I just had a baby- and had my first taste of alcohol after 9 months. Come during happy hour and you can drink even more! The atmosphere and vibe are great.  And the service was one of the best I have encountered in a while!"}
{"text":"From the outside: unassuming strip mall. From the inside, hip loungey restaurant and bar that looks upscale, but has great prices. Can't say enough good about Firefly - I was very impressed. The food was so incredibly delicious. My boyfriend and I split the following: the apple and manchego salas, the stuffed dates, the artichoke hearts and the tierra y mar skewers, tuna tartar, and cerviche. Tapas were just the right amount of food - not too much, and not too little. 

Great date night spot, spot to meet with your friends, or just a place to unwind after work. Great service, too."}
{"text":"Excellent. So, this place is better than any place I have eaten on The Strip. I am comparing it to places like Julian Serrano (way better) and China Poblano. There were vast vegetarian options for my wife. It is worth a cab ride or renting a car. I had the ceviche, which was great, and the camarones di diabla were amazing. Lots of meat choices, too. The service was wonderful. We come to Las Vegas three times a year and this is going to make it part of our regular places not to miss. When it's not too hot the outdoor patio is a great place to sit"}
{"text":"Ehh.. I guess I kinda like this place. They got some cute little tapas and a so so wine list. When I got no place to go for my wine nights, I will return~"}
{"text":"I've heard so much about Firefly from some locals, so I FINALLY had the opportunity to check this AAAMMAZZING place out. It definitely lives up to the hype and everyone's raving recommendations. I'm starting to think that I need to venture off the strip for better tasting food for cheaper prices.

Ambiance:
Firefly has an amazing vibe. It's dimly lit, quiet, and chill. I like how you can sit on couches as opposed to chairs. You can sit comfortably on the couches while you sip on some delicious sangrias.

Food:
1) Filet Mignon Sliders - Sliders are always a safe bet. SOOOO GOOOOOOOODDD. The meat was tender and the caramelized onions, of course, are always welcome on a burger
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5shgJB7a-2_gdnzc0gsOtg?select=qUWwQJqRjOxq2kpOnK43hA

2) Smoked Salmon Toasts - if you like the fresh salmon taste, this is definitely a must! capers, pickled red onions and dill sour cream were great on the smoked salmon. yummmm
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5shgJB7a-2_gdnzc0gsOtg?select=WCj5SXOvDukxgxMhv4lLVw

3) Shrimp Ceviche - very fresh.
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5shgJB7a-2_gdnzc0gsOtg?select=Da3M9N2PDmtRd6QiH9azrQ

4) Tuna Tartare - Didn't taste as fresh as the shrimp ceviche or the salmon, but it was still pretty dang good.
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5shgJB7a-2_gdnzc0gsOtg?select=UlE5AF8h0VoL7UxC8CO8JQ

5) STUFFED DATES were PERFECT! Even after reading all the reviews, I was still skeptical since I hate dates. However, I will ALWAYS order the dates here because they were bacon-wrapped and contained smoked almond, red wine reduction and blue cheese. The bacon combined with the almond, reduction, and reduction masked the flavor of the dates. Whatever they did, it WORKS.

6) Firefly Fries - can't go wrong with parmesan, herbs, and garlic aioli on fries. Not too salty, but enough flavor and perfectly fried.  
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5shgJB7a-2_gdnzc0gsOtg?select=WLctqbU82YT1yw6nSKfLBQ

7) Manchego Mac n' Cheese - I love mac n' cheese and it didn't disappoint here.

8) Grilled octopus - FAIL. Overcooked and too chewy.

Parking:
Plenty of free parking in the strip mall parking lot. Not crazy like the strip."}
{"text":"My favorite spot in Vegas!

The palla is amazing! The tapas... Omg you can't go wrong after several visits and nearly sampling everything u am damn near an expert at this place! Oh let me tell you about the burger! Damn, it's bomb! It's close to a chimi from the BX!"}
{"text":"Maybe I was just in a bad mood and am being a bit harsh because my iPhone had *just* been stolen right before we headed here but I just was not thrilled with Firefly in the least.

The sangria was okay but not great. The food was so greasy it was gross. The mini little burgers were the best thing and they weren't even all that. I felt like I needed to do a cleanse after I left..and a facial! 

Too much grease...ugh I so won't be returning :("}
{"text":"One of the best Tapas restaurants I've ever been to. Was visiting and was recommended this place by multiple locals and am glad we took the trip off the Strip to come here.

Prices were great, especially when compared against any place on the Strip and the ambience was phenomenal, this would be a great place to bring a date. Food was outstanding as well I would highly recommend the bacon-wrapped dates (what they are known for) as well as the merguez, but honestly everything we tried was great.

Sangria (we had the red) was good, but not outstanding. Overall, I would highly recommend Firefly to anyone living or visiting Vegas."}
{"text":"We were able to slip into Firefly during lunch when it was not too crowded. With a group of 12, we were lucky that it wasn't. However, the restaurant doesn't plan so well for larger groups with the tapas styles, as all the plates we were ordering didn't fit so well on the table that we were at. 

The menu has a wide array of items and everyone should be able to find an item that they like. I personally enjoyed the filet minon sliders with a good balance between the sauce and feta. The ahi tuna was a little tough and would have been better if just seared on the outside instead of completely cooked. However, in the tapas style, it was great to try a number of dishes you didn't order to add to what you did, such as the mac and cheese which was pretty good considering I am not a big mac and cheese kind of guy.

They also have a good selection for drinks to compliment the various tapas. With a good wait staff and good ambiance, I would say I'd be back, but only if I drive, as it was a bit out of the way."}
{"text":"3.5 stars for food.
We had ceviche of shrimp, padron peppers, scallop \"escargots\", petite filet, seafood paella and banana nutella sandwiches for lunch. Our favorite were the padron peppers and petite filet. My medium-cooked filet was surprisingly prepared to perfection, really tender and juicy. The scallop \"escargots\" was good as well but the portion sucks. Both ceviche of shrimp and seafood paella were way too sour and tasted bland. The banana nutella sandwiches were OK, looked better than it tasted. 
All in all, reasonable price with average food. Service was good."}
{"text":"During our trip to Vegas we ventured off the strip to go to Firefly.  At the end of the trip everyone said it was their favorite place out of all the restaurants we went to and I have to agree!  I made a reservation a week ahead of time for a party of 6 and they called the day before to confirm. The ambiance is dim lit, energetic, loud and fun! 

It's the perfect place to go to with a group because you can try a little bit of everything. We ordered and ate family style and everyone seemed to enjoy it. All that was left was empty dishes! Some of our favorites were the stuffed dates, baked goat cheese, and the steak and mushroom skewers. 

Out of the 6 of us 5 were sharing the tapas and 1 person ordered an entree. The tapas came out all at once, but our friend with the entree had to wait 15 minutes before hers came out so that sucked since we all felt bad she didn't have her food at the same time as everyone else. We could have clarified a bit better when we ordered. Since the tapas came out all at once I'd recommend ordering in courses especially if you are ordering half the menu like we did. The service was good and only got a little slow at times, but they were slammed so its to be expected. 

In comparison to all the restaurants on the strip we visited, the food at Firefly was better and it was a lot cheaper since you aren't paying for the celebrity chef's name. 

We also had fun with the GIF maker on the way out!"}
