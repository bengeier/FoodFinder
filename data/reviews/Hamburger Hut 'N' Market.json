{"text":"Tried chicken fingers in different places, but none come close to the chicken fingers here! Wish they had a better parking area."}
{"text":"Classic local place to eat. If you pass thru Las Vegas, and you have some time stop and get the chicken fingers."}
{"text":"Best thing going for North Town. You must try the hot wings & hot chicken tenders! The fries are perfect but burgers are whatever. I've never tried the Mexican or sea food because I'm addicted to the wings and fingers. You get a lot of bang for your buck! Last night i went and ordered 2 regular cheeseburgers, 10 piece hot wings, & 4 chicken fingers which came out to $20 and some change. Parking sucks though when it's busy."}
{"text":"Some of the best fingers I've ever had. As well as the burgers! Really some GREAT food."}
{"text":"Small place big flavor ! 
Been my go to spot for years now and I feel completely comfortable sending friends and family to this great place"}
{"text":"This place is the BOMB! I've been coming here since day 1 that they opened and I love it and all my friends do too.. 4 piece HOT! The ranch is the best also. It's always packed and no parking spots but you can't get enough of their great food. Sometimes the fries are a Lil overcooked but other than that. It hits the SPOT! North town!"}
{"text":"PROS:  Burger tastes like a down home backyard charcoal bbq burger.  Chicken fingers/wings also great.  Very inexpensive at about $5 for the largest burger with everything on it.  CONS: staff can be quite rude, atmosphere (this a a gas station, dont expect anything more), parking is non-existant, & sometimes the oil in the fryer is too old & it makes the fries taste like crap.  Never had any complaints about the burger however.  I would give the burger/fingers/wings 5 stars, however the rest of the menu deserves two stars"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for 12 years and the food is delicious my favorite is the chicken fingers and the super hut burger both come with thick fries that are seasoned and fresh !!! One the best spot if yoür really hungry and the prices are great too"}
{"text":"Its alittles small but this place is bomb I absolutely love their hot wing's!!!!! The food is always fresh and the service is good. The burgers are pretty good too and really big!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here all my life. The food is BOMB but a whole in the wall none the less. Idk if my bad luck or what but I feel like they always push my order last. The past 10 times I've been here I count about 10 other people that come in, place their orders after me and there orders still come out first. I've even tried placing phone orders to speed up the process but it always fails. However, this spot is still a MUST try. Their wings, fingers, burgers are all delicious and the steak cut style fries are worth the wait!"}
{"text":"The only reason I am giving this a one star is because this was my second time there, and this time, they messed up on processing my credit card and charge me $84.01 for my chicken wings. the lady said she voided it, then swiped my card again and fixed the price, 5 days later it was still taken out of my bank account. My bank is going to fix this for me, but I should not have had to go through all this hassle just for these dang wings. Because of this mistake of theirs I will find another wing place. I mean what if I had needed that money for a bill or something. Get it together."}
{"text":"SOOO GOOD!!! I always get the 4 piece spicy. Perfect every time. You won't be disappointed. It's also a convenience store with a really good selection of drinks =]"}
{"text":"I grew up in this area so the area doesn't bother but it might for others.  Mom and pop type place. Amazing chicken fingers! I always bring friends/family  from out of town and they love it."}
{"text":"My coworker turned me on to this place. The place is a classic hole in the wall with good food. I had the burger, wings and fries all was delicious with a great price."}
{"text":"This place is hella ghetto and nasty. I order a burger with NO onions and they put onions, the bad thing is that i told them about it so they could fix it but all they did was pick the onions off. Never going back again"}
{"text":"These wings are bomb dot com and the hamburger taste fresh with that charbroiled taste , with crisp vegetables and great steak fries. Little small only about 6 tables"}
{"text":"Definitely the best chicken fingers in town!! Even tho theres only one location in vegas the food is worth the drive, costumer service is okay could be a lot better bt no complaints to them really.

The food is cheap nd delicious. The area is a little scary nd theres literally only like 5 parking spots so finding parking can be difficult sometimes especially because they do get a lot of service which makes me think why they havnt opened a new location in vegas bt it is what it is nd I'm always going to be a costumer(: bt if your a chicken finger or chicken wing fan this is the place for you gurantee."}
{"text":"They totally got my late night order wrong!! I tried calling them that night and the phone just rang and no ever answered and they did not close until 1pm. I had been out late and was starving and I went to bed hungry. I order 2 wing combos 1 mild & 1 medium.  What I got was 12 extremely hot chicken fingers chili cheese fries and 3 extremely hot chicken fingers with fries.  I called the next day and was told to bring the receipt in and they would make it right.  I got there with my receipt and the manager on duty told me that I would need to bring the day old food back with the receipt.  I advised his that since it was hot fingers and chili cheese fries I could not eat it I threw it away.  He refused to make the order right!  This was my first and last business to an establishment that would think I would lie about receiving a wrong order. I know someone else would have had to call because they got my order.  I hope they enjoyed mine because I did not enjoy what I got.  Very poor customer service skills on this managers part and he did not even attempt to make me happy or even offer me a discount.  I was going to buy some more food but he lost that sell.  Disappointed in Hamburger Hut!"}
{"text":"The best chicken fingers, hot wings, burgers, and fries in North Town.. maybe even all of Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"I go for the wings & the oh so yummy fat fries! My mom had a burger there & said it was pretty good too."}
{"text":"The fried perch came pre-battered out of a box in the freezer.  The fries came out of a box next to it.  I saw the chicken strips on another table that looked like your basic freezer strips also.  The burger reminded me of my high-school cafeteria except with three times as much mustard as was necessary.  The hot wings were your standard deep fried with a sauce that I'm sure was straight from a jar.

That said, it was all pretty cheap.  However, I don't think it deserved the rave reviews.  I might try the fried chicken if I happened to be in the area but I'm not going out of my way for it."}
{"text":"Wings, fingers, chilli cheese fries, catfish, Superhuts (burgers), etc. All served directly from heaven."}
{"text":"Menu items are delicious and mouthwatering. The food can be greasy, the establishment is very busy, parking is limited, and depending on the day customer service is mediocre at best. But the food is so yummy!"}
{"text":"Haven't had a bad experience at a food place like I just did here. The service AND food is terrible. I went with my family and found this spot. It sounded ok, but is was a total hole in the wall and the food was even nastier. I asked the fist guy if he could clean a table so we could take a seat and he just gave me a stupid stare then ignored my request. Rude. I noticed no one did anything about it so I asked again but to a different employee up front. Again he looked at me funny then kept saying \"what\" as if he didn't understand. Again nothing was done and all the tables where filthy. My mom is super patient and nice to people and said \"lets just clean it ourselves it's okay\" it's not okay to me. We payed to eat and support their business they can at least help us take a seat? I was so annoyed. I asked the cashier lady if we could get out table cleaned, there was buffalo sauce and fries all over it. She was having a conversation with my mom so she was like sure. Finally. I thanked her and waited for our food. It shouldn't be a hassle when you go out to eat to find a place to sit. Anyways the hot wings they ordered where cold and they only gave them the ones with hardly any meat on them, not sure what the hot wing part is called but not the little drumstick looking ones, which was my moms favorite but knowing her she doesn't like to complain. They said their hamburger meat was extremely dry too. I don't eat meat but I believe it. I ordered a bean and cheese burrito but they didn't have salsa so I guess they gave me these taco sauce packets. The beans had zero flavor but it was the only thing I could order off their menu. Everything was greasy or dry. We will NEVER eat here again."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the local spots that people have to try if theyre visiting. Friendly staff, and fast service."}
{"text":"Hamburger Hut is that not so attractive kid in your class who turns out to be funny, friendly, and cool once you get to know him.

They have a few dry items, liquor and other beverages, thus the market part of their namesake.  A few video poker machines are there too, but the reason to come here is really for the food.

Mexican fare, and some fried deliciousness are all available here.  I have yet to try any of the Mexican food, although that will happen very soon.  I can't help but order the fried catfish overtime, it is so good.

This is a deep fried, flaky salty kick in the taste buds.  The fish stays nice and moist while, the breading is crispy and light.  I like these aquatic morsels with a little hot sauce or even malt vinegar like fish n' chips would be eaten.  The fish is served with fries which as Andy t. puts it, are \"too salty.\"  Does that stop me from inhaling them with my fish?  You know it does not!

The chicken tenders are delicious too, and can be ordered with varying degree of heat.  As a lover of all things hot, I recommend staying away from the hottest they have, as its more salty than spicy.  I think they use Frank's red-hot sauce to kick it up.

This dingy dive stop will not disappoint.  Come in for a quick and inexpensive bite, be ready to drink lots of water the rest of the day, all that tasty salt will keep you thirsty."}
{"text":"the best philly cheese steak ever! yes ever! with steak fries! i usually get extra mushrooms! and the best price ever! get a lip smacking good hamburger 1/2pound everything and cheese!"}
{"text":"Hamburger Hut has been the best for years. Yes, it is in the HOOD but that's where you find the best food of this type."}
{"text":"This is the spot in town for late night ficken chingers...(you know what i mean)... or if your in the mood for some fried catfish...ohh snap it's the bomb. I have to agree with the first yelper..this is an intimidating part of town but worth the trip."}
{"text":"I ordered the 4 pc fried chicken (I think it was $5.29). It came with fries and a couple rolls. The chicken was ok. The fries were too salty. There was a lot of food for $6.

You probably want to phone in your order before coming here because it's kinda greasy inside. 

I'll probably come back and try their philly cheesesteak."}
{"text":"The look of the place might fright you and I am sure they don't have an A rating just based off what I saw in the restaurant but the food is very tasty. There was a sink with a dirty rag and cleaner on it on the same counter as the soda and tea they had a drink system that dispensed the Mexican flavored drinks but they were empty and I think they had cleaner in the coffee pot because it was full of liquid but it was light brown. They have a wide variety of food to pick from and a little market in there as well with a lot of different drinks and snacks. The customer service for us was fine but a couple that ordered after us had an issue one of them ordered a burger with not ketchup and then when he walked back up to counter when he saw them making his burger they were adding ketchup he advised them he asked for no ketchup and they had an attitude like it was not his right to ask for something not to be on his burger, he stated if i am paying for it why is there a debate on ketchup going on my burger. Then one of the other people working chimed in and said something, the customer looked at the guy behind the counter and said I have been coming here for years and quite a few times a week and i have never seen you here so i am not sure why you are in this conversation all i am asking is for no ketchup to be on my burger. It looked like the conversation was about to get more heated but the guy just went back and sat down after he made sure not ketchup was on his burger. I was thinking why such a big issue the restaurant made over no ketchup, now on to the food... I am definitely a fan of this place! The bad news it that's it's so far from my house. I have missed fish n chicken places like this since I moved from the Midwest. The chicken wings were perfectly fried and seasoned not over cooked and the fries were good too. The only thing I was not crazy about was the buffalo sauce i got it to the side and it separated even when I put the top on it and shook it less than a minute it separated again, so that was a little weird to me. My husband got the catfish which he is now a big fan of theirs, he said the breading is what took the fish over the top for him. The fish was flaky and cooked perfectly."}
{"text":"I so hate everyone who complains about this area some people had to live here there hole lives i agree its a very dangerous area its northlasvegas what do you expect ? but you cant deny how bomb the food it spicy chiken strips the catfish the wings and the fries are fireee satisfies your wing cravinggs"}
{"text":"If you're looking for greasy, yummy food - this is the place.

I have never loved chicken or fries more.

They just redid the place, but it's still in a sketchy neighborhood. Don't worry about it.

The cook is amazing. My whole family loves this place.

And you CAN actually win money here! My aunt won $275 within 2 minutes. Believe that."}
{"text":"Hamburger Hut's food for the most everything I have tried has been really good. Though I wouldn't recommend the wings because the couple of time I've tried them they have been really dry and seem to be reheated too many times. 

But the chicken fingers with fries and the cheeseburgers are delicious. Also the ranch dressing is rich in flavor! You do want to eat the items sooner rather than later because if left in the containers for too long the food doesn't taste the same.

FYI: The establishment isn't really designed for dine in purposes. There aren't many tables and sitting area, as well the parking lot is super small."}
{"text":"Let me stay off with the good: their food is REALLY good. The burgers are big and juicy, hot dogs are grilled, and their wings and fry combo is my FAVORITE. 

The bad : their customer service leaves something to be desired.  It's pretty slow and they don't like speaking English... also,  their Aguas frescas fountain has been broken for YEARS. Really disappointing."}
{"text":"I love this place!  Best Chicken fingers and fries and ranch in town ... Well all the food is bomb.. Yea it's a small place but trust me it's worth coming here..."}
{"text":"Okay before we get started fair warning. This is not a nice neighborhood. No seriously, you could get killed down here. This particular establishment is in what appears to be an abandoned building that doubles as a convenience store. I stopped on my way out of town for a trip home, to grab a burger for the kid it myself at three in the afternoon. In broad daylight it was a scary spot. 
The food - good. They make a hell of a burger. Just don't know if it's worth getting mugged over. Pretty sure they're selling crack out of the apartments next-lol"}
{"text":"I Love me some hamburger hut..the best place to eat!!  
Their food is fresh and cooked to order. When in Vegas this is the spot!!"}
{"text":"Good find in the North! 

Fried Chicken - best tasting fried chicken I've ever had! Nice size portion for 2.

Catfish - very good, just wish they gave a little more.

Burgers - ok. tasted like a regular ol' hamburger to me. Which brings me to my next question, why is it called Hamburger Hut when they're burgers are mediocre as hell? Haha

It's a convenient store/restaurant. But more of a restaurant. It seems busy all the time and I hear people always ordering the fried chicken.  That's all imma get here too. 

Parking is limited. Like, only 7 spaces limited."}
{"text":"Came here during lunch hour- the parking lot is tiny and scary don't park too close there is at least a five foot drop!! Food was ok, I had the chicken finger salad. Pretty good. Crazy people in the lot . Not too much seating, but it was full of customers, and that's always a good thing!

Best hamburger ever !!! And the fries and the ranch!!!!"}
{"text":"It was hard not to go with a 5 star. But I need to keep real. This place is really good. Mom and pop shop. Good old fashioned fried burgers with taste. My fries, which came with the combo were huge portion and piping hot. The people were friendly and it's clearly a local joint. One of those hard places to find if your not a local. This kind of place doesn't exist on my side of town. I added ranch dressing for my fries at a fair $0.50. It was thick. Not homemade, but they clearly buy a good brand. My burger was a little bit too well done. I might ask for a medium burger next time if I'm ever in the area again. And then I might be able to rate it a 5. You won't be disappointed unless your looking for the healthy food."}
{"text":"This place has always been delicious thing coming here ever since 2004 the food is so fresh you can't find it anywhere else reminds me of California all day long"}
{"text":"I eat here like 5 times a month it's a cool place to get some good wings and fries my son loves the burgers I  love it all  but something out of the ordinary today my ten piece only had eight and no I didn't even look at it cause it's just always right so I called and let them know and I was pretty much told I wasn't telling the truth which I'm not too worried about it though it's just not good customer service being that you're located in this area with some not so polite people you can make it a better experience by not only having great food and better customer service Id probably return but I'll absolutely Uber eats"}
{"text":"Hamburger Hut n Market epitomizes a hole in the wall type restaurant.  It's not in the best neighborhood and you'll encounter unsavory type individuals.  But, if you're looking for savory and delicious food, Hamburger Hut is your place.

Visiting from San Diego for my daughter's volleyball tournament, I compiled a list of places I wanted to eat at while we were here in Las Vegas.  Hamburger Hut was listed on Yelp as 4 stars, had over 100 reviews, and showed one $ sign.  Hamburger Hut checked off everything that I look for in restaurants, which was at least 3.5 stars, a good amount of reviews, and cheap.  Hamburger Hut is truly a hole in the wall.  It has limited parking, so you might have to park on the street or in the sketchy apartment complex next door.  Hamburger Hut is deceivingly spacious inside as it also houses a convenience store and a row of casino game machines.  The seating is very limited and are cafeteria style benches.  Recommend that you buy your food for takeout.  While you wait for your food, you can try to win back the money you're about to drop by playing video poker or slots.  Decor and ambience is nonexistent.

If you want ambience, Hamburger Hut is not for you.  If you want to eat yummy and tasty food, this place is for you.  I ordered their Philly Cheesesteak combo that comes with seasoned fries and 10 hot wings.  I highly recommend the philly cheesesteak.  That sandwich was one of the best cheesesteaks I've eaten.  It was stuffed with meat, engulfed in gooey cheese, and complimented with just the right amount of sautéed vegetables.  The bread was soft and just added to the goodness of this sandwich.  The sandwich was a decent size, but I wanted more of that sandwich.  It comes with seasoned fries, which were large sized and were okay.  My son had their chilli cheese fries and that too was tasty.  Hamburger Hut has the option of fountain drinks or you can buy one of their many canned drinks.

Although some people might be nervous eating at Hamburger Hut, allow me to assure you that the nervousness is well worth it for tummy satisfying food you're going to consume.  Hamburger Hut is not a secret evidenced by the amount of people I saw come into the restaurant while we were eating inside.  After that outstanding cheesesteak, I can see why people flock here.  Next time, I've got to try their hamburger and zucchini sticks.  That good."}
{"text":"Have been going there since high school yeah it might be in the ghetto but the food is good!! I have never been disappointed....all they want todo is make good food!!! I recommend the hut special, chicken finger, and wings all are very good!!!"}
{"text":"What a dump. The place is dirty and the food is terrible. Felt like i was in a place off a horror movie."}
{"text":"Let me tell you something....they may not have the best parking lot (fills up quickly), nor do they have the best looking customers. But this is why they are still in business. The right customers live all around this hole in the wall that most suburbans tend to shy away from due to the amount of illegal activity that takes place in this surrounding area. But hey, sometimes you gotta do whatcha gotta do to get some good grub..even if it means heading to the hood.

The wait is a bit long from time to time, depending on how many hungry people show up.  Most of the time, you can expect the wait to be between 25-30 minutes. Which is why you can also call them ahead of time and order to pick up. They don't deliver but i think they should because of how much more business they would get.

Once upon a time in the hood there was this convenient store looking restaurant called Hamburger Hut that served the best wings (extra crispy naked with sauce on the side) and to die for Hutburgers! That was all she wrote \"literally\"."}
{"text":"The bbq wings are to die for, my personal favorite!!!! All in all, eveything is very very good especially the chicken wings. If your in this area try Hamburger Hut out."}
{"text":"After a long day in Culinary School, I was looking for a good place to grab a bite to eat around CSN. I decided to check out Hamburger Hut. Based on the reviews, I decided to go with the chicken fingers and my spouse got the catfish. I thought the chicken fingers were pretty decent but nothing special. However, my wife really, really liked her catfish.

A couple words of warning if you're heading to Hamburger Hut: the service is slow and there's limited seating."}
{"text":"Wings and fries always come out hot and crispy. Hamburgers are big and tasty too. Don't let the location or looks of this place deter you, food it good here."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service every time you order from this place. Does not matter time of day or day. If you are reading this and know of a better place with great fingers & wings. Please feel free to message me."}
{"text":"Just got a combo, burger with fries and drink included for under 7 bucks. Tricky place to find that driving into the parking lot I though it better be worth the hassle. Ridiculously close, its diagonally across the Marianas. Inside I counted 8 cameras the TV monitor right above the cash register. Clean place it looks and feels as if I'd traveled back in time some fifty years. Ma pa business are my favorite."}
{"text":"Best buffalo chicken fingers in town! If youre ever in the North Las Vegas area you have to stop by and try it! The burgers are great too"}
{"text":"If you don't mind a hole in the wall in the hood, then why haven't you been to this place?! It's literally a convince/liquor/market style store, with the room for 5 tables and a small wings or deli style set up. I'm usually the only white girl, however never treated to where I at all feel uncomfortable. The have a variety of items including (the obvious) burgers, wings, hotlinks, and catfish. The hotlink side is a Louisiana style link served on bread with mustard, ketchup, and onions. It's $2 and change and the best freakin link I've ever had. The burgers are cooked fresh and kinda remind me of five guys. I haven't had anything I don't like and wouldn't be surprised if they ultimately get a 5 star rating from me. If they had wiped down tables and a little bit cleaner of a dining area they would have!"}
{"text":"The first two times I came here it was absolutely awesome. The jalapeno poppers those are really bad deal. However the last time I came it was very inconsistent the hamburger wasn't that great in the fries weren't that great and overall I wasn't very happy. I'll come back again because I'm pretty certain that usually do better but that's why they got a 3-star. I'd say come on down and give it a try it's not too much on decorum and the service is fast food but it's pretty good. Also there's really no seating or anything there's some but it's not very good. So probably plan on taking out."}
{"text":"The place looks a little spotty, but don't let that fool you... The food quality is the opposite. 

I had the combo, something simple. It took a little while to make, which was fine because it was worth it. The cheeseburger was taaaaasty! It's 10x better than your average McDonalds burger and the fries were hot, steamy, and big. (That's what she said.)

I wish I could go here more often, but it's on the opposite side of town for me. They should really open up another location in Vegas. Try it out."}
{"text":"This my favorite stop for fingers and chili cheese fries. Love stopping here any time of the day and night.."}
{"text":"With a name like Hamburger Hut, clearly this is not gourmet dining. This is a family owned restaurant/convenience store combination. The location is a bit rough, but don't let that fool you. The staff is friendly and the locals know that you can always get a great cheeseburger, wings, or fingers here for a decent price. People rave about the fingers but my personal favorite are the cheeseburgers (Super Hut). The patties are hand shaped and grilled-not cooked on a flat top! They get that awesome char... Mmm. My mouth is just watering as I type. Don't take my word for it, go check 'em out and judge for yourself!"}
{"text":"I can not get enough of this place. We eat here at least 3-5 times a week. MMMMMMM"}
{"text":"ANOTHER GREAT FIND FOR MY HOLE IN THE WALL PLACES LIST!

Based on some of the reviews I read, the wings, fried chicken, hot links, and catfish were all highly recommended.

So I ordered wings and catfish. Originally I wanted to order fried chicken as well but they told me that they had just run out. From what I heard, their fried chicken is so good that they usually run out. Ok, so why don't they fix that? 

Anyways, the wings were decent. Your choices were mild, medium, spicy, and barbeque. The catfish was really good. It had that perfect blend of batter and cornmeal. Nice and juicy too. Next time I hope I can come early enough to try their fried chicken.

Now when you go to this place, they are situated in their own building in between an apartment complex on the right and a convenience store on the left. Parking is rather small and on busy occasions, you might just have to park down the street somewhere. 

When you finally make it inside, you will notice that they are basically a convenience store that just happens to serve burgers, wings, fried chicken, catfish, and many others that looks appetizing. You have about 4 decent tables and if you're lucky, you are able to sit at one of them if you are not gonna take your food to go. Yes, they take cards and I dont remember seeing any signs of a minimum amount so I guess that's a good thing. Their bathroom is all the way in the back and it's not all that obvious. You kinda have to do a little bit of exploring before you can find it.

I hate to say it, but the actual appearance of the place looks rather ghetto. But the food and the service they provide is quite remarkable. If they had a better location and make up they would be making some serious money.

So in closing, my advice would be to call ahead for a pick up order and if there is a table available then by all means, go ahead and eat there. As for their menu, you really have to be there if its your first time and some parts of their menu are not all that clear.  4 stars for the food and 2 stars for the location so 3 stars it is for me."}
{"text":"The hamburger is filling and they do prepare them the right way.

I got the wings, not the best mild but very good medium or hot.

A+ on the fried chicken and chicken fingers.

Hate the parking lot though..lol"}
{"text":"Yummy food cooked to order. Service is friendly and personable. I love the chicken wings and fingers."}
{"text":"This place is the best hole in the wall joint in Vegas! Food is amazing, parking small people are cool, kinda ghetto but I wouldn't change it because that keeps the food cheap. This would be a pricy joint if it was on the strip. It's a must try if your a foodie!"}
{"text":"This is my third time here and so far I have not been disappointed with the food. Definitely a whole in the wall kind of place but food is yummy.
This place has been here for quite some time and is easy to miss when driving by. Not in the best location, parking is limited, over flow parking in apartment complex or convenient store on the other side of restaurant. There is a small sitting area in the restaurant (holds approx 16 seats), 5 slot machines to play while you wait for your food to cook. Alcohol for purchase in back and many different soda beverages as well. It looks like this was a mini mart at one time.
The Philly cheesesteak is one of my faves, bread is soft but holds together (just how I like). Wings are fresh and crispy and you can make them as spicy as you like. No frills here but good spot to curb your appetite."}
{"text":"For those of you that just pass by this place and show it no love, you are missing out! This is one of the best little holes in the wall. I always pass by heading to my parents house and don't go nearly enough. It's a cool little convenient store with a grill. They have all the normal snacks like chips, soda, and even some beer. I think it's best to call ahead and place an order it can get busy. It can also get pretty crowded on the outside. Parking is tough. I'm always coming from the 15 so I make a u turn and park near the apartments next to the store. I usually walk right up and pay for my order. My favorite thing to get it the hot fingers and fries. I love when they put the fries in and put the fingers on top. It makes the fries taste soooo good with the hot sauce. They usually give you 1 ranch with your order and you can get extra for .50. I've also had the wangs and they are pretty good, little small but still good. The staff always seem busy but they are friendly. It's a great place to grab a quick bite. Also the number posted on yelp is wrong. It's (702) 657-9203."}
{"text":"This place was PACKED at 7 on a Saturday. The food was amazing and came relatively quick. It's in a rough part of town, so be ready for that. But once you make it through the door, you'll be happy you came there. Only thing that was missing was a drive thru. That would have been great. All in all, I recommend you check it out."}
{"text":"I love hamburger hut ! Always fresh & served quick! My food is always steaming hot and I never wait over 10 mins for food."}
{"text":"So decided to get some wings because I had the urge to eat some wings and, well I was desperate, haha.  

What I received was a very sad stack of chicken wings.  They were under sized and over cooked again :P. 

Never again"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Everyone's complaining about the neighborhood but honestly it's the safest in north town. So please, calm down. The chicken fingers are my favorite. And their hamburgers are great as well. They're cheap and I'd like to say it's North Las Vegas' version of canes."}
{"text":"These sre by far the best burgers in Vegas. We go here everytime that we are in town. Hugh burgers, fresh hamburger meat, not frozen, steak fries, and fresh vegi, i cant say enough.  They have hot wins, burgers, ect. Prices are amazing. Two people can eat for less than a 20 dollar bill. Great employees. Since i was raised in the hood i consider that the location to be in the hood, they have 5 slot machines and i have won enought there to eat free literally for years. A must try!"}
{"text":"My wings are always delicious. The best wings in town in my opinion. I always get hot wings and fries well done crispy. Never fails me"}
{"text":"I frequent this hidden gem 3 times a week for lunch. Best wings and burgers (don't forget to add bacon) in town! Parking can be a pain. It's always busy around noon, but I always get my order in a reasonable time."}
{"text":"Okay so let's be honest here this place is absolutely not in the best part of town however the saying \"Diamond in a rough\" applies here! I was a bit skeptical coming here but my co workers insisted that I look past the location and focus on how great the food really is! Being the open minded guy I am sure I agreed to give it a shit because after all I absolutely  live for a great burger and fries! We arrived with our order halfway made because you can actually call in your order which I highly recommend! They stay busy so it's encouraged! I ordered the super hut burger with fries and let me say that this burger was extremely good! Fries were hands down the best I've had and the service was so good! I would like to return but this time try and order some of the chicken strips and or the Philly cheesesteak! Looked amazing from the pics! Oh and by the way if you purchase any alcoholic beverages you CANNOT drink them inside while dining..weird but okay lol"}
{"text":"Delicious chicken fingers, one of the best in Vegas. Creamy ranch and mediocre fries. Sometimes the wait can be long. This place has the smallest parking lot in the world. Beware of giant potholes in the next lot. Watch out for crazies this place is in the hood. Still worth the risk."}
{"text":"As others have mentioned this is a bad art of town. Also, the parking to me is like an accident waiting to happen: So small and no room. I guess you'd have to see it to see what I mean. One time I had to park on the appartments right next to this place which I was not excited about. But on to the food, everything here is mediocre. I can make a better burger at home! Nothing special about the wings either. I do not understand why this place is so overhyped. I like FatBoy a million times better."}
{"text":"I had this place for lunch and it has pretty good cheese burgers and Massive chicken fingers! I got the 4 piece chicken tenders with half lemon pepper and half BBQ with fries. The fries was nice and crisp and was more akin to potatoe wedges then fries. The cheeseburger was the best though, it was nicely charged and tasted like something you would make on the grill in the comforts of your own digs. Price is reasonable but the only draw back is the terrible parking here due to it sitting on a small lot that you will miss easily if driving by and unfamiliar with this neighborhood. I want to try the regular chicken wings and of course the Mexican grub here as the dishes I saw the making looked really legit."}
{"text":"Hamburger Hut is def a hole in the wall - a must have in Las Vegas! I'd give it a 5-star, but not everything can be perfect! 

Cons: 
- Parking lot is literally enough for about 6 vehicles. 
- I ordered my food over the phone since my lunch is limited, and had to wait an extra 15 min for them to prepare my food upon my arrival. So what is the point of ordering in advance if they don't begin cooking your meal till you pay?
- Not in the best neighborhood. 

Pros: 
- It's also a small convenience store. 
- The staff is friendly!
- The food is so good! 
- The food is great! 
- & again, the food is great! 

Again, it's a must have if you're a local, or visiting the area! You def won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"You can't really say you're from Vegas until you've been to this spot for their chicken wings. I came on a Tuesday night after class around 7PM, and they were BUSY. Don't be discouraged by the line, there were a few people ahead of me waiting to order and for their food, but the line moves quickly. 

They have a classic \"American\" selection of wings, fingers, nachos, and burgers -I think that's about it. The sauce they use for the wings was really good, but pretty spicy so I'll be cautious next time. The wings & fries were perfect, the only thing missing was a good ranch to go along (I think theirs is bottled). Parking is really limited, but most people are ordering to-go so getting a space won't be an issue if you're willing to be patient."}
{"text":"Maaaaaan all locals know about that hamburger hut. If you want good food at great price this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Fuckin bomb son. Not the classiest place but the food is bomb as all hell. Damn son come on son, damn son."}
{"text":"Always delicious food. I recommend to call in and place your order ahead of time or you can wait for a little while."}
{"text":"Best chicken wings ever!! Not sure what is is, maybe a higher vinegar to hot sauce ratio but not even my second fave wings place can hold a candle to these guys. 

First time I was introduced to their delicious food was when somebody brought some wings to a hotel party. I didn't get a chance to try them while they were hot but even when they were a few hours old, they were still BOMB! That had me sold so every once in a while if I'm feeling brave, I'll drive there to the not-so-nice part of NLV and order myself some wings and a six-pack. Convenient cuz it's also a lil market. I wouldn't go there after dark though. Just saying."}
{"text":"Hamburger Hut has been around for a long time and the food has been consistent on the taste and they don't have any problem giving you your money's worth"}
{"text":"This place is the best hole in the wall with delicious food. There chicken fingers with seasoned fries drizzled with the same sauce, are the bomb!! I've followed them since I was 15, when they were at Stop n Shop. People complain about the area and the ambiance. That's all part of the package, you know if you go down there to find them, that's how good they are. 28 years later, I now take my kids there to eat or order out to take to drive in this place is on point!"}
{"text":"I'm literally ADDICTED to their chicken Philly sandwich!!! So dang good!!! It's all I think about throughout the week... yes this place is as everyone says crowded and you need to order ahead once you find out what your favorite things are! All I know is I recommend this to every and anyone. The prices are really good also."}
{"text":"Best burgers in the valley!  Patties made fresh daily.  Treat yourself if your in the area or if not - it's worth the drive!!"}
{"text":"This joint is a hood classic !!...reminiscent of the old original S&S on pecos & lv blvd ,  best fingers & wings in town...#checkmate"}
{"text":"This is the best place to gets some wings! Their bbq, mild and hot wings are sooo good! Best place ever! Nothing can beat this place! And the fries that comes with the combo is great! It's 15-20 minutes away from me but it's definitely worth the drive! And I love how they're open late!"}
{"text":"Made a special trip to this place based on glowing Yelp reviews and was really disappointed.  The burger was not great--reminded me of overcooked backyard BBQ.  The onion rings were okay.  Nothing good enough to make me return."}
{"text":"This place isn't in such a great part of town, but hey. They got some amazing chicken wings. Don't pass up on it!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite spot for chicken wings. best wings with delicious fries and amazing ranch.

I recommend anyone and everyone here, its in the ghetto but worth going out of my way for. i have introduced all my friends who introduced all of their friends.

The parking lot set up is terrible, don't go in a big truck, you will be asking for misery."}
{"text":"Hidden Gem,

Pros:
-Good Chicken Fingers (Hot is my favorite flavor they also have plain, 
   bbq, and mild)
-Fries are seasoned and so good ask for them extra crispy. 
-Its also a market so you can buy a drink and eat there.

Cons:
-Parking is limited usually I park at the convenience store next to it.
-Fountain drinks SUCK its better if you buy a drink from the refrigerators
-Seating is limited, if you plan to eat there. 
-It gets hot in the summer.

PRICE RANGE
I always get
8 Chicken Fingers (Hot) it comes with 2 ranch and Fries 
for 16.00 including 2 refrigerated drinks. There is a Credit Card fee of 0.50 cents.
You get fries with the chicken fingers and if you get 4 or 6 fingers you only get 1 ranch if you get 8 fingers you get 2 ranch lol.
Wings are cheaper.
Burgers are huge and wrapped in aluminum foil.

I would rate it 5 stars since I come here almost every week lol but the service would be better if they renovated the place a little or added more tables maybe fixed up the parking to make it a bit more accessible. Sometimes its hard to make a right sharp turn into the parking that's why I park next door."}
{"text":"Wow heard about it.  Drove across town. Glad I did. The best burger ever. The moms and pops places always shine over anyone I believe.  Can't wait to visit again!"}
{"text":"This place used to be a cool place to eat after your out shopping all day want a quick meal.  Well today i took a special trip to get me Chicken Tenders and Fries and a blue creme soda...well to my surprise!!! I also got in my order a Fried Roach!!! I called back to let them know about this and was told oh well if you could bring it back we will replace it....I wouldn't let my dog eat off they dirty floors...nor do I want anything they could possibly offer besides my money back and I just might call the health department..."}
{"text":"A hood staple in north Las vegas . Known for their hamburgers but the locals come for their hot wings and chicken fingers. This place isn't known for their hospitality but the workers are friendly and hard working. It's a small hole in the wall joint where you can buy a 40oz and some wings. Place is ugly as shit but the food is great and that's what matters. Small parking lot but most people who aren't locals are scared to go anyways . Im sure this place makes enough money to upgrade the store but hamburger hut is one of those places where it's perfect the way it is. But please dont be scared the locals are very nice ! I do recommend go go go!! You'll be coming back trust me."}
{"text":"I'm not giving a 1star for the quality of food because the food is good. When I call in to place an order the guy who answers is terribly rude. He talks over you. Then says \"see u in 10minutes and hangs up on you\". Definitely dislike the customer service."}
{"text":"Stopped by hamburger because I won a bet with my dad. All I can say is WOW! Walked in and got greeted by the cashier with a smile on her face. The burgers are packed and full of flavor. It's also a big size burger. The catfish melts in your mouth and the breading is nice and crunchy. The fries are bomb too! The chicken fingers were really good as well. Lastly the wings. IMO, the wings here are better than BWW. Hamburger hit is now my new favorite restaurant and I look forward to returning here soon."}
{"text":"This place is awesome hadn't  been here in a while.   Almost forgot about it.   Burgers  are great.   French fries  are the bomb.   This is the perfect little hole in the wall..   They just need some music.. The little market  Is a great convince.   It like one stop if you just going home to chill.  Chicken must be good.   Everything sells good."}
{"text":"This is a pretty bad area but the burger was actually OK.  I would like to try the Perch and even though the big sign outside says Broasted Chicken, they had no chicken. I will be back but probably not for the burger.  Five Guys burger still rocks."}
{"text":"I have been going to this place for over 10 years, I moved back to MT and when I visit Vegas, I always go to HH. I get the cheeseburger and the hot chicken tenders. Yum."}
{"text":"Ok this place looks a little scary not in the best neighborhood but let me tell you there chicken fingers are amazing and then get a regular hut so good n cheap."}
{"text":"This place has some of the best wings.  Not only that the burgers and stake fries are right on point.  Small corner spot is always the best food."}
{"text":"Yummy food. Ordered delivery, and everything was hot, fresh and delicious! The burgers are outstanding!"}
{"text":"Best chicken fingers in Vegas
It's not in a great area, the seating is terrible but the food is fried and fabulous! Where else can you get a burger, chicken fingers/ wings, fried fish or quick Mexican food all in the same place? 
It's all walk up service with a few booths to sit at. 
This place doubles as a convenience store, so you don't come for the ambiance, you come for the food!"}
{"text":"I've been working in North Town for a few weeks and Hamburger Hut was the first stop on my lunch tour of the area.
I read all the reviews prior and ordered the famous chicken fingers, which were nice and hot. The fingers are A-OK (3 stars), but I'm bumping The Hut up to 4 because, if it weren't for the acres and acres of empty lots around, you might think you were in a real urban city somewhere! The place is a little run-down, always jammed with patrons and high school kids just hanging out, you get your soda from a cooler on the \"market\" side, there IS a \"market\" side, and the staff are always yelling orders back and forth. Seriously, it seemed just like a place I used to go to in Inglewood! Not that Inglewood is anything to rave about, but just for the unique factor, I'm glad Hamburger Hut exists."}
{"text":"Very little parking, no drive thru, and that perpetual U-turn because you always drive past the first time, but worth the hunt when you are out on the prowl for that old time taste of the neighborhood from time to time. Especially after an extended trip away somewhere and only a sloppy old fashioned hamburger or your particular neighborhood delicacy will suffice. I had the super hut combo, 1/2 lb single patty cooked through, fresh fixings and bun so wonderful I can't recall much beyond light and perfect for my wants and needs. Large fries, an even larger size fountain drink, serve yourself. $7 I think. Total."}
{"text":"hate the small parking but OMG are they worth it !! the boneless fingers, thick fried, burgers, chilly cheese fries !! they are always packed and for good reason. This is one of those \"hole in the wall\" joints that if I could I would eat at every day."}
{"text":"The wings are awesome, fried mushrooms, zucchini sticks and jalapeño poppers are all amaze! The fried chicken is tough to get as its usually sold out and the catfish is eehh and I personally don't like their fries. But this spot is def worth stopping by. When me and sweetheart are in the mood for wings or something fried, this is a go to spot"}
{"text":"Looking for a cheap, delicious burger? This is the spot. I just wanted a delicious cheeseburger. No fancy nancy, just old fashioned like dad makes em' type. WINNER WINNER! Not in the best neighborhood, go before 5--haha"}
{"text":"This place was pretty good and the portion was great only downside is the location and the interior of the market. It could definitely use an upgrade. The food was pretty darn good I tried the wings, a burger and their chili cheese fries and I was satisfied. 
Wooohoooo Hamburger Hut"}
{"text":"The food is amazing and mouth watering just thinking about it. It would score an easy 5 star if it wasnt for the location. If it were in a better area i would easily go once or twice a week compared to my once a month."}
{"text":"Not worth potentially getting robbed for. Our wings were fried pretty hard and the sauce was kinda nasty."}
{"text":"This is my go to place right by my house order over the phone to just pick up love the burger its big juicy and the fries are always hot and fresh. The chicken wings are fresh and perfectly seasoned. Love this place ."}
{"text":"Chickens wings and fingers are superrr bomb.omg and the fries even better! Live like 2mins away always go their :p"}
{"text":"So this greasy spoon is as ghetto as they come. They got a market and a grill manned by this guy who looks like Snoop Dogg - What's funny is....its a lil intimidating for white people when they walk in. But hey everyone's friendly. They have video poker machines that are still coin in and coin out. But Hamburger Hut(or we call it Hamburger Slut) holds a delicious treasure of hamburger surprise. Ever watch Grease 2 and Michelle Pfeiffer is at the diner getting a burger and putting lots of ketchup on it? Or Pulp Fiction. Where they house the Big Kahuna burger? Well these movies make me crave burgers. This burger grilled over an open flame....FANF*CKINGTASTIC.....yes It's not Burger Bar at Mandalay or Kilroy's - This is just all man meat grilled juicy like a house burger without the onions or bell peppers sticking out of it. Snoop knows how to grill a burger. The chicken fingers....sure they're packaged - but it's good fast food they usually hook you up big. Fried chicken's not bad also. I haven't found anything I really didn't like at this place. Sure it's not Mc Donald's(I just threw up in my mouth) but it definitely is an experience if I use the FANF*CKINGTASTIC word....
So Location - 1 star...but it gives it character. Experience and Taste...4 stars."}
{"text":"The food was banging when I went last night.  Will be going back for sure.  Just moved here from Denver, and the food is waaaaaaay better here!"}
{"text":"This place was recommended by several people so i took my girl got 2 burger combos and hot chicken wings. When we got the fries they were soggy and and chewy and the burgers ha edges that were already burned and dried along with the whole burger being cold. The wings are the only thing i think they actually cooked today. Ill never waste my money here again"}
{"text":"Oh my jesus! 

I have a soft spot for little local hole in the wall type spots. This spot isn't in the best part of town, but who cares. Never underestimate a place like this. They were all kind, welcoming and work super hard. (It was busy) 

We got 25 wings and one super gigantor burger for everyone. There were other things on the menu from burritos to pork ribs to fried catfish. It was hard to  choose!  

25 wings - $17.99
Super Hut Burger - $4.29

Everything was just under $25. Not too bad. Decent pricing. 

Onto the food... 
Super Hut Burger - I had tried this colossal burger first and seriously, wow. The charcoal taste and warm soft buns with fresh vegetable was just amazing! They were very generous with the pickles too. Not a fan of pickles but yeah. Usually, I dislike raw onions but they went well with the burger. One of the best burger's I've had! 

Wings:
Lemon pepper: THIS packed a punch of flavor. Delicious, scrumptious flavor! The chicken was meaty and crispy. I was in heaven. 

Mild: A tad soggy when you wait to eat it, but it still had a crisp to it. Very delious sauce too. So bomb! Generous with the creamy milky ranch too! I didn't need to buy extra and everyone's a ranch fiend! 


I didn't wait too long either even when there was a line. Or maybe I wasn't paying attention because I was gambling. lol. Lemme just say, I wish this wasn't on the other side of the world or I'd be going here quite often.

FYI: 50 cent charge on debit/credit car transactions."}
{"text":"Hood Burgers...there are some good ones out there!  HH definitely fits the bill for \"hood\" enough...but is it \"good\" enough??

Super Hut Burger and Fry. It's inexpensive (at around $7 or so for the combo) but it is lacking in taste. Don't get me wrong, it's not bad, but I have had many better 'Hood Burgers' in town!!  Compare it to Fat Boy for instance...not even in the same ballpark.

Fries are very basic as well...could use a little more salt or flavoring.  I didn't bother eating them all.

The location and area sucks, but you knew that already.

The eating area is inside a convenience store, but all the tables and floors were dirty when I got there during lunch time.  I've grown up in bad neighborhoods my whole life and lived down the street from here actually...but was still never fully comfortable while I was eating here.

I vote pass!"}
{"text":"Very Very dirty I don't know how the health dept. doesn't do something.
The food is good and looks like it's family owned n operated just need cleaning"}
{"text":"I tried to order lunch for my company so I phoned in the order. And when I called back they hung up on me. So I had a coworker call and they were talking in the back ground to each other about hanging up the phone. Bad customer service...."}
{"text":"I've only ever eaten the combo hut but you cant really do better than that. Great cheeseburger, big fries and a drink for $5.00 (been here about 25 times over the years and haven't been shot yet)

The Neighborhood is such a dive I was going to deduct another star but the foods so good I had to go with four stars."}
{"text":"Don't let the neighborhood setting intimidate you.   Good quality burgers cooked to order and french fries hot from the fryer and dashed with seasoned salt -- just like back in the day.  Friendly folks all around too.

Parking is hard to come by during the lunch rush, but the food is worth the walk around the corner where street parking is available."}
{"text":"I went there on Saturday had the burger quality not the best plus it was cold but did order 50 chicken wings naked with hot sauce on side and I have to say they were cooked perfect. They definitely have that down pat"}
{"text":"I just came from this place.. We had mild hot wings, catfish, chicken and fries... So not good.. The fried chicken was cooked in what seemed like 3 day old grease and had no kind of seasoning.. The no seasoning trend goes for everything!!! Catfish no seasoning, how wings no seasoning.. Omg this has been the worse experience I ever had.. To top it off they ran out of tarter sauce but gave me blues cheese and told me to dip my catfish in that.. Ugh.. So not worth 21.83"}
{"text":"Tried for the first time and loved it!!! I got the 4 piece chicken finger combo for 4.99 ---Awesome!!!!
My husband and son both got Super burgers. The patty was bigger than my hand but thin and they got an order of chili cheese fries for 3.99 to share.

Place was clean and the staff very friendly. They do have a few booths you can sit at to eat but we got out to go. It was about a 8 minute wait. No biggie :)

I gave it 4 out of 5 stars because they only have about 5 or 6 parking spots and when those fill up people park behind your car and we had a very hard time getting out."}
{"text":"Myself and some friends stoped here the other night. If you've never been here before you might be surprised when you walk in as the place a mini mart as well. It's very small inside about 3 tables available. The food to me is a little over priced at least for what we got. My boyfriend and I both got the combo hut deal which comes with a burger, fries and a drink. It was almost $18. My friend and her boyfriend got wings and a combo hut which was almost $20. The downside to their order was That they ordered an extra side of ranch besides the one that comes with the wings but only got ranch with the wings. They tried asking for the other one but they said no it's with the wings. So really the wings didn't come with ranch included. The food however was alright nothing special. The burgers reminded me a lot of five guys. Although the bottom  bun on my burger was way to soggy it was like it was literally dipped in water then put on so I took it off and only ate it with one bun which kinda sucked. My friend said the wings were really good but the ranch sucked. The fries weren't that great either they weren't really seasoned and the ketchup we got came out in clumps so idk if it was old or if they make it and that's just how it looks. I personally wouldn't chose to come here unless I was on that side of town. I would have much rather gone to five guys which wouldn't have even ended up being much more expensive maybe like $5 more. So to me it wasn't worth the almost $20 we spent."}
{"text":"This is my 1st time here @ Hamburger Hut with my fam we got cheeseburger wity everything and the catfish. .. i can believe how inexpensive it is but it's on the other side of town.... OMG THIS FOOD IS SO F***** GOOD!!"}
{"text":"Food is very good and cheap. Extremely limited parking. Call ahead so you don't have to wait 25 mins for your food because everything is made to order."}
{"text":"One of the hidden gems in Vegas. This is a family run business that has FANTASTIC food. Try the mexican food, I had chile colorado once and have been raving about it since."}
{"text":"One of the classic, delicious Northtown staples that is a stop you must make if you find yourself in this part of town for whatever reason... The kitchen doesn't stop putting out killer wings, really good hamburgers and even some quick Mexican specialties, appreciate the love.. This is a unique spot because it looks sketchy from the outside and inside. But I can appreciate the realness of being able to walk over to the fridge, buy a tall can to drink while you wait for your food and then walk out, no frills or questions - just grub-sesh-status hitters that anyone would enjoy. I like the location, it is close to the college and if you are brave enough to venture there late-night, keep your head on a swivel. But it makes the reward of the great food that much better.  Much love for this locals only spot."}
{"text":"Love this place. Hamburger Hut is a small restaurant located in a liquor store serving up a variety of food from chicke fingers to breakfast burritos. My favorites are the Pancho nachos and the Philly cheesesteak. The prices are reasonable and food is good. Definitely a locals spot, but I encourage anyone to go down. You can also phone your order in so it will be ready for pick up. There are tables inside for dining in as well as a few slot machines and liquor."}
{"text":"Been one of my favorite spots since high school best chicken fingers in Vegas, the burger are great as well I love the HUT"}
{"text":"If want a really good hamburger this is the Spot! Forget about the other places. 
It's Busy, The Local residents and outsiders fill the place. I love the food there. 
Please support local business. Customer friendliness can need some improvement. 
All the Money this place is making an overhaul would greatly improve business."}
{"text":"Interesting place which makes it tough to review.   I'm torn between 3 and 4 stars but settling on 4 just because low expectations made this a pleasant surprise for me.  

Chicken wings are oddly delicious.  Definitely not the meatiest chicken wings on earth as they can be a lot of skin and bones... but the buffalo sauce and the crispiness of the chicken really is pretty damn good.  I'm also not usually a fan of steak fries but theirs are fantastic.  The ranch dipping sauce plays a key role in making the chicken and the fries so good.  I have to admit that I crave it just about every time I find myself nearby.   I've tried the burgers and they aren't spectacular... but again... pretty good for the price and better than you would expect by the look of it.  Not the best area... parking can be tricky when busy, but look past all that and you have a pretty good wing and fry place with reasonable prices."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good someone took me here a long time ago and I could never remember the name and I just found it. The neighborhood is not so nice But I guess don't let that run you away Have to try new things!!"}
{"text":"Had to come get the catfish yet again so juicy so flavorful always good service and food"}
{"text":"Love it. Best food !!! Chili cheese fries and hot chicken fingers are my favorite. Yummmmmmm!!!"}
{"text":"Despite the outside and inside do hesitate to eat here pretty damn good. The burger the Legit and fries were hot a fresh. Super busy as well. The lady running the Togo phone could smile once or twice but besides that it was cool"}
{"text":"I have no idea what people are thinking when they rave about this place.  It's subpar bar food at BEST.  I had the staples, a 2 finger/5 wing combo, and the Super Hut.  I didn't care about the wait time, or the staff who I thought would've been way worse.  They were actually really nice, and I sat in the booth next to the telephone orders and the blonde who was taking orders seemed pretty pleasant to speak with.  That's where the 1 star comes in.  Even though it's in a bad area, I wouldn't rate it on that.  Although you SHOULD be warned.  

The wings?  Too fried, too little, dry.  

The sauce?  Like any other bottled buffalo sauce.  

The fries?  Frozen/generic.  Over fried and you can taste the old oil.  

The Fingers?  Like any other frozen chicken finger you've gotten at an ordinary pub.  I say ordinary because places like Crown N' Anchor makes great, fresh fingers.  

The burger?  It tastes like a way over cooked version of a Five Guys burger but with bland toppings.  All I tasted was the lettuce.  

If this place has a sentimental value to some, I get it, but anybody who voted this place 3 stars or above on taste alone has lost all credibility in my book.  I went out of my way to come this place and I was greatly disappointed."}
{"text":"Best wings in north town. Fries are so big and crispy. Oh mah goidddd!!! GREAT PEOPLE GREAT FOOD"}
{"text":"Simple, good, classic, burger with all the fixings. For just over 3 bucks, you can enjoy one. No complaints. A simple hole-in-the-wall. Great drink selection, both alcoholic and non. I'm a burger freak, have had some better, more worse, but for a cheap and good fix, this is the spot."}
{"text":"This is my all time favorite place In The world they stay having my order right the wings are so special just like I like them they never disappoint such a well established wing spot"}
{"text":"This is a 2 part review
First off, the food at this place is off the chain. I've never not enjoyed whatever I've gotten here. The catfish is 5 star no doubt, never been lucky enough to get the fried chicken because it's always out. The wings are hot and excellently sauced and the burgers are good and worth the price

The location is something that I personally find charming but I understand why some folks are turned off. This is a tiny joint. It's a supermarket with the grill as part of it. There aren't that many tables if you're going to eat in. Because its a tiny place there isn't much parking. I usually never have issues but it has arose

TL;DR try the wings or the catfish, small parking lot but worry the wait"}
{"text":"If atmosphere is not an issue and you just after good food then this is your place the hot wings are very good havent tries thier burgers yet but thier prices are reasonable so i see many visits in the future for me"}
{"text":"I love this place. I always order hotwings and a cheeseburger. my son likes the chili cheese fries."}
{"text":"The location is definitely not in a good part of town, but any time I find myself in the area I have to stop in and get some of their delicious food. The Chicken fingers are amazing, and if you like spicy, the hot flavor tastes great and has a nice little kick. The Burgers are freshly made from scratch and grilled and taste delicious. The best part might be the reasonable prices."}
