House beef noodle soup 4/5

Great parking and typical modern Asian decoration with canto-pop playing a bit loud, we came to moo because of the yelp reviews and a recent recommend by Jerry. 

We're big fans of beef noodle soups so we came in with empty stomachs and anticipatory taste buds.

The two very large looking bowls came very quickly. 

The beef was on the dry side but the noodles and soup base were executed very well.

Carol liked the house noodles that came with eggs and more noodles.

A very hearty,soul warming meal. It's like a Chinese ajisen ramen.

{"text":"So my family and I were searching for a place to eat dinner in Markham and ended up at \"Moo.\" We were amused by the name, so decided to try it out. Not a bad choice! It was delicious and cheap! We each ordered either the House Beef Noodle Soup (comes with beef, tendon, veggies, eggs, etc) or the Spicy Beef Noodle Soup ( it was very hot! - I think I got the spiciest! since there were 3 levels of spicy). The beef was tender and the broth was great - noodles were just average as they were from a package. Bill came up to $40 including tax and tip among 4 people - so you're looking to spend around $10 a person here."}
{"text":"A solid casual restaurant to go with friends/ fam. Good quality food. I highly recommend the tofu (it's just labelled tofu but is actually fried, topped with a nice sauce and green onions for garnish), the dumplings (looks very homemade!), and both the noodle and the rice dishes are very good. I do not enjoy the complimentary soup though, but whatever, it's free.Though this restaurant isn't extremely cheap (nor is it expensive), they offer extremely good portions that leave me feeling full every time. Unfortunately, this restaurant has its quiet days, where it gets a bit awkward when you're the only table in the restaurant, but overall it is a comfy atmosphere, with a television to keep you entertained (though they only show Chinese things). Waitstaff is courteous, and does their job well. Overall I think this is a great restaurant, and it's unfortunate that more people don't know about it!"}
{"text":"After reading reviews on my favourite beef noodle restaurant, \"Beef Noodle Restaurant\" declaring that other places were better, I decided to try the \"better\" places. How Moo is better just confuzzles me. I admit the beef is quite tender but the soup is just bland and no where close to being any spicy. What a let down. 

Their pan friend pork and Chives Dumplings is nothing to write home about either."}
{"text":"Came to MOO when they first opened, back in the day when no one was around and they didn't even have A/C on (1 Year Ago).  I was SWEATING up a storm in my work clothes, that's the sacrifices I make to TRY new places.

I didn't have the heart to tell the waitress the Beef Noodle wasn't that great since she was quite friendly and helpful.  She even apologized for the malfunctioning A/C as later I saw the A/C guy come in and out of the resto.

Personally I just felt that the Soup Base was a bit bland even though it looked very dark and rich, the Noodles were OKAY.  It's one of those times when I think that I tried a place too early and they have no customers, so there are no turnover of ingredients day in day out.

The presentation of the bowl was the FIRST thing I noticed and it was a bit of a MESS.  At times I do EAT with my eyes first and I guess this is one of those times.

I got the Popcorn Chicken as well which was as nice as the same item at other Bubble Tea Houses(Next Door).  I gave them an EXTRA rating because they gave me 1 whole Marinated Egg."}
{"text":"My friend and I were suppose to go somewhere else for dinner tonight, but that place ended up closing early at 8:00 PM. So we were searching for a place to go eat, and ended up at \"Moo.\" We were amused by the name, so we went. Glad we made the choice! It was absolutely delicious and it was cheap! We both ordered the house beef noodle soup (comes with beef, tendon, veggies, an egg, etc) and popcorn chicken. Both are highly recommended. The beef was slightly hard, but I enjoyed the broth. They also serve rice dishes and other Taiwanese cuisine at this place here as well. Service was impeccable! Will come here once again!"}
{"text":"Moo Beef Noodle House is an unfortunately named restaurant that's a \"one trick pony\" ... perhaps more appropriately, a \"one trick bovine\".  The menu reads like a pamphlet.  Literally, your average food court Chinese take-out booth has 5x the selection.  It's a good thing that the one trick they perform is a right good one.  

With ample parking out front, this small restaurant has seating enough for approximately 60 people.  I've been three times and there has been no waits and plenty of seating.  The decor is a clean and spare with the dark hardwood look that is very popular among new Asian restaurants these days.  

Order the Beef Noodle Soup for well less than $10 for lunch or dinner.  The large bowl comes with hot beef broth, thick noodles, Chinese veggies (like small bokchoy) and lots of chunky beef.  Although the beef is bit dry and stringy (a common characteristic for this type of dish), the broth has a wonderfully meaty taste and the noodles are fantastic.  This is perfect comfort-food for a cold winter day.  For this alone Moo deserves 4 stars."}

{"text":"Went here on a recommendation from a friend when I told her I was looking for good Taiwanese food that does not involve bubble tea.  So after looking what seemed forever for parking and ended up parking on the mall across the street (it was Sunday lunch, so what do you expect?) I ended up here with a couple of my friends.

Their menu/order sheet was written primarily for Chinese people, no surprise there.  So I got their House Beef Noodle with thin noodle option (3rd column in case you were wondering).

Verdict? Loved it!

If there was MSG, I barely felt it.  Beef was ooh so tender.  I don't like tendon (there were two huge chunks) I traded them for the beef from my friend's bowl :D  The portion size may look big, but it is actually just right for brunch/lunch time food.  I didn't feel too heavy in the end.

Loved it so much I forgot to take a picture of it BEFORE I wolfed it down.

At $7.99, I found it a bit pricey, but for the quality you get I think it is worth it.  You also can get free wi-fi from Destiny next door, just keep to the left side of the restaurant :D"}
