{"text":"Such a delightful little place out of nowhere in a regular Fry's shopping center. We live close by and we were skeptical when we found out there was to be yet another Poke place off Ray between 10 and 101. Well I was wrong! This is a lovely place. Everything is clean, food is fresh and light (not heavy on sauce or seasonings which I liked), portion isn't too crazy, nice employees....The list goes on and on. Nothing too fancy or too crazy on add-ons, which actually keeps this place very authentic. We will be back."}
{"text":"If you had to choose between the ahi poke bowl chain and this place, go for this place!!! It is awesome and always delicious!! I love the poke bowls here and they are always fresh!!! Please check them out!!"}
{"text":"We ordered Poke bowls from here through Uber Eats and they were wonderful! I had the shrimp and calamari bowl and my fried had the spicy tuna! The citrus kale salad was amazing! Will definitely be ordering again! Food was delivered before the estimated time."}
{"text":"Most Authentic tasting Hawaiian shoyu poke I've had so far in AZ!  Come check um out gang! Best tasting poke bowl I've had"}
{"text":"Best poke wave in town, and I love the atmosphere. I come here every day and the food gets better with the passing of time. Favorite place ever."}
{"text":"I love this place, ingredients are fresh, staff were friendly, highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Super fresh and awesome toppings options! Loved the fact they had a gluten free sauce as I usually go elsewhere and get it plain and sauce it up at home. Staff was beyond friendly and knowledgeable. Will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Today was my first time at Poke Wave and it was fantastic! My husband came yesterday for his first time and loved it so much he returned today with me!  The food is fresh, generous servings  and full of flavor. The only \"challenge\" is there are so many choices it's hard to know what to choose. It is family run and they are extremely helpful with recommendations of sauces and toppings to go with your protein choices.   Highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"We love poke and we love Poke Wave. We try to go regularly. In our opinion it's better than nearby Poketrition because: - the fish tastes firmer and fresher; - there are more options for the toppings; - the dressings are better tasting; - the place looks cleaner; - the service is better as you are served by the owner, his wife and his daughter instead of the random teenagers at Poketrition who don't know much about the food they serve. For example, they couldn't tell me which of the dressings had sugar and which didn't. - there are more choices for those of us who try to avoid gluten and sugar; - it's quieter; - there's patio seating, if that's your preference.  We love Poke Wave and hope it'll be around for a long time."}
{"text":"If you haven't had Poké, it's a must try! Absolutely addicted. Salmon, ahi tuna, spicy tuna, avocado... That's love. I'm glad I found this place on yelp after leaving the gym. It's amazing and the people there are super sweet! See you all again soon! #poke #love"}
{"text":"We really enjoy the food at this place.  Everything is fresh and the portions are decent.  They have a good variety of drinks and the restaurant is always clean."}
{"text":"Just had Poke Wave...Salad with Tuna salmon, spicy mayo, onions cucumber cilantro. I might gave to drive back to get some more, it was that good!"}
{"text":"If you love food from the ocean this place is for you.    and tofu this place has it all. The best part is you can choose from a menu or get creative and build your own. The prices are reasonable!"}
{"text":"My favorite poke place! They have mix ins that I haven't seen elsewhere, like fresh mango and pineapple."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The fish is always fantastic. I recommend the citrus kale salad as your base. It tastes so fresh and light but has plenty of flavor and they manage to get rid of that bitter taste kale has. The spicy tuna actually has some heat to it, so be prepared! I was a big fan of Pokitrition and they are good, but this place is definitely my new favorite."}
{"text":"Very delicious and super large portions. I got a half rice and half salad bowl and I could absolutely eat no more, I can't imagine how full I would be with double the rice. I got the 3 scoops of protein, but honestly 2 might have been enough. The price was also less than their competitors down the road, and everything tasted fresh. I liked how their menu and labeling was much easier to follow than other poke shops I've been to, as there is a lot of customization involved which can get confusing. I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"There are a number of poke/bowl/wrap spots along Ray Rd, but for bowls - Poke Wave is the best. (Edit: looks like they have poke burritos now!! Will have to try it and report back!)  First off, the portions are generous. Having a square bowl allows for a bit more food than the round bowls at other places. There is a nice variety of proteins offered (including tofu for vegetarians!), and everything tastes really fresh. They put a lot of care and attention into the freshness of the fish and toppings and you can taste in in your dish.  Every poke place is different and I love the unique toppings at Poke Wave, including the kimchi cucumber and fried garlic. Adds so much flavor and texture. Service was great and they offered to let me taste all of the sauces to best choose which one I'd like. It was hard to decide because they were all yummy.   For drinks they have a variety Hawaiian canned juices and sodas, as well as fresh iced teas - unsweetened which is great because you can sweeten it to your own liking.   An amazing family-run local poke spot - I will be back for more!"}
{"text":"I took my dad to Poke Wave for Father's Day because he was in the mood for fresh fish and had never tried poke before. The fish was fresh and tasty (I had the salmon and Hawaiian tuna). The owners were so welcoming and they gave us generous portions. My poke bowl was MASSIVE by the time I finished selecting all my ingredients. They offered some interesting sides that I hadn't seen before at other poke places such as spicy Korean cucumber. I look forward to coming to Poke Wave again!"}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Poke so I tried Poke Wave on a whim. These guys do not disappoint.   The ingredients that they have is different from many other poke places. I'd recommend the citrus kale as your base as opposed to a normal salad. They offer the normal ingredients that you'd find in most poke places but some that I found unique as well.   The staff is amazingly accommodating and very happy to answer any questions and make recommendations."}
{"text":"Wow! I was really surprised. The fish was so fresh and they have a ton of really good sauces. The salmon and tuna were super fresh. I'll be back many times."}
{"text":"This is the Best Poke in town! Ive tried 4 other poke restaurants and this one is consistantly the freshest one around. I just left there and already cant wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This poke place is not just an ordinary place.  It has more than just regular salad. I would recommend their citrus kale salad with your mix ins.  They have a lot of other topping options to choose for your salad.  You can make your own salad or choose their signature bowls.  They do have their regular sauces for your salad but you can ask them for suggestions for tasty sauce combinations with your salad.  They do have sushi burritos as well.  You can either make your own or choose from their signature sushi burritos.  The miso soup is also very good and comforting.  In my opinion, it is the best one in the east valley.  It's a clean pls e and the staff is friendly.  Finally, their sushi burrito containers are very efficient and effective if you are on the go."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I went to Poke Wave for lunch today and had an awesome time! The food was fantastic! We can't wait to go back! Everything was very clean and very fresh and the service was excellent. You could tell there were several regulars there today grabbing lunch too. The man helping us knew it was our first time and happily let us take our time while ordering and asking questions. I'm on a strict nutrition plan for now so he helped guide me through the dressings and toppings. He even told us that they will be getting some new exotic hot teas in the near future! Excellent choice for s fun, healthy and awesome lunch! We can't wait to go back! I really want to try the citrus kale next time."}
{"text":"I called 15 minutes closing one night and they were super nice and kept the store open until I got there. Everything was still fresh and the counters were spotless.   They have a wide selection of proteins, including tako (octopus), scallop, seared albacore, and tofu.   I got the salad base and chose the citrus kale salad. Loved it! The kale was crunchy and it was tart and tangy with the right amount of dressing.   The owners are Korean and offer a cucumber kimchi as a topping. I loved it as well! For those wondering, kimchi is pickled vegetables. This preparation was the right amount garlicky, salty, spicy with a hint of sweet. If you like pickled veggies, put this in your bowl.   Friendly customer service and good food, definitely worth trying."}
{"text":"I love this place! For a healthy lunch, I always stop by here for their bowls. I usually make my own. Everything is fresh and the staff are lovely. This is a bit of a hidden gem in the Frys parking lot but once I found it, I crave it. Don't pass up their citrus kale salad!"}
{"text":"It was my first time trying a Poke bowl. Very similar concept to Chipotle style restaurant. The meats for the bowl are freshly cut tuna or shrimp, and there are various toppings you can add to the bowl from fruits to vegetables to rice seasoning and flakes and sauces. The combinations are endless. The amount of food in the bowl was definitely worth the price. If you do not want to create your own, there are signature bowls you can try."}
{"text":"I've been here twice so far and tried some of their wave bowls. They're delicious, well portioned, and they satisfy my cravings for sushi in a way that is otherwise impractical on a short lunch break.  It's sort of like getting a sushi bowl instead of a sushi roll, except you get to add and mix in extra toppings. I recommend getting the pickled red onion and crispy garlic on everything. I hope this place sticks around. They're fast, the staff is friendly, and the cost is reasonable."}
{"text":"Super good food! Fresh, clean, and LOADS of choices. Can't think of a single reason NOT to eat at Poké Wave! Oh, and the the citrus kale salad made a kale eater out of my husband! Now THAT is something to get excited about! Price is right too!"}
{"text":"Updated review: what are you waiting for??? This place is the most consistent in bringing in quality and quantity for a great price! Customer service is always outstanding. Don't be afraid to ask questions! Definitely a hidden gem!! We will continue to support this poke place!!   Husband and I went here for the first time and the poke experience was amazing!   I've had poke bowls before but this was my husbands first time ever with sashimi lol. Turns out he was a huge fan and is now a fan of poke!!   I had the ahi tuna and spicy tuna as my two protein and from that first bite the quality was just like I remember fresh tuna would taste like!!! Melts in your mouth and SHOULD NOT be fishy at all!!!  I highly recommend you give this place a try! They are really reasonable priced for the quality you get along with the variety of toppings and sauces to choose from! The owner was very pleasant ansuper friendly and helpful giving my husband some info on the choices!   We will def come back!!! Please go check it out!!!"}
{"text":"Great service and good food.  Very comparable to other poke places, definitely worth a revisit :)"}
{"text":"Very clean place!!! Food was ONO!!(delicious) the closet thing to poke back home in Hawaii! We WILL be returning!owners are very nice and helpful."}
{"text":"Excellent poke. Have tried all the other local poke stops, and this is my new favorite. Huge portions, tasty sauce, nice selection of toppings, and I love the seared Albacore."}
{"text":"Incredibly good. I'm hooked. The food is so fresh and so delicious. I highly recommend trying this place. You can create your own bowls with your favorite fixins. So many amazing choices. The staff is super nice and will put your order together efficiently."}
{"text":"This is absolutely the best poke place.  The sweet chili sauce, always fresh food, yummy seaweed and crunchy options.  We have been many times since they opened and the service is always friendly with excellent suggestions. Tried the passion fruit Hawaiian soda yesterday and it was yummy. Love it all!"}
{"text":"What a great fresh new addition to 85284. We needed a fresh choice and you answered   Family owned and the best tuna. Love the choices"}
{"text":"Tried this poke place and overall it was above average from what I'd expect for a poke spot. The service was good and the quality of ingredients was good as well. It was a good eat but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here, especially since it is not close to me."}
{"text":"This place was very good. Little confusing at first on how the build your own bowl worked, but ultimately not too overly priced for great food. However, the atmosphere was not very friendly or inviting. We would mostly likely come back for the quality of food more than anything else."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! The owner, 20 year sushi chef born in Hawaii served my husband and I up with amazing poke bowls. He explained all the ingredients available for making a bowl to our taste (and setting us up with little taste tests along the way) and gave us helpful guidance in our experience. Everything was incredibly fresh; small batches and big flavor. We will definitely be back!! This is a great local spot! Forget the chains popping up!"}
{"text":"We ordered Poke Wave via UberEats shortly after 8 p.m. on a Friday night. The order was prepared and delivered pretty quickly. Everything was packed nicely for a to-go. I was immediately disappointed once I opened the lid to find a very small serving of fish on the bowl. I had paid the extra fee for two additional scoops, but it looked more like a normal serving. The amount of fish was disappointing especially considering I paid extra for more. Other than that, the bowl was great. The salad was fresh and all of the toppings were good."}
{"text":"I have been going to this place consistently for couple months. During that time they added new options and updated their menu. Only poke place I've been to that has kimchi! Amazing! They are so friendly. They have an operational efficiency of a chain but the way you are treated And they're greeting feels like a Mom and pop shop. They are sooo friendly sweet and accommodating. I drive the extra couple miles to go here instead of place by me."}
{"text":"A solid choice for a quick bowl of good not great poke. The best way for me to describe this place as well as most of the others in town (in terms of quality) is that it's very good but still basically fast casual food. There is a different poke place here in AZ that is a step up, more like fine dining sushi grade quality fish that just happens to be served in a plastic bowl. That's the main difference for me."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place.  Everything is so fresh and delicious.  The owner and his daughter were there and couldn't have been nicer.  I chose Ahi tuna and scallops over brown rice with almost all of the accompaniments.  It was so filling that we could eat only half (saved the rest for lunch the next day).  Going back tomorrow.  Guess you could say I'm addicted!"}
{"text":"Delicious combinations and a variety of sauces to try. I have a new meal every time I come here. Their portions are big so I always leave feeling full, unlike when I go to other poke places in Phoenix and its surrounding areas. Definitely the best place I've tried yet! Don't let their empty restaurant scare you away. It's because they're relatively new!"}
{"text":"We were lucky enough to stumble onto this gem while on a grocery run during our visit to Wild Horse Pass Motosports Park. Food, A++ and great service. We each had variations of the spicy tuna bowl. Yum! And so nice and refreshing on a very hot day. They also have really yummy un-sweetened tea. Chat up the owners, they are really great. :)"}
{"text":"the poke bowl is giant, tons of yummy toppings including kimchi cucumbers, fresh mango and pineapple,  and seaweed salad. the fish is high quality and its very reasonably priced. love that their ponzu is made with lime- very unique! will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Once again, updating my review to 5 stars because this place freakin rocks. I absolutely love their sushi burritos and I've made my own each time I've gone in. My only concern was the lack of sauce but I've gotten soy sauce and their house sauces on the side, which has helped tremendously. And the customer service here is just so good! The folks are so friendly and the extra touch makes a difference; they wrap up my sauce so it doesn't leak on my way back. I can't get enough of their Hot Cheetos wrap, at one point it catches in my throat and makes me cough, but worth it. Thanks Poké Wave! I got your sticker on my water bottle so I'm spreading the word."}
{"text":"Love getting my build your own sushi burritos! Options like salmon, octopus and shrimp for protein, mangos and cilantro for toppings. This place always satisfies my craving, I used to think it was pricey but honestly the prices are true to what you get."}
{"text":"This is the best poke shop I've eaten at in Arizona. I asked the owner about it, he used to be a sushi chef for many years, and only buys the top quality fish and personally inspects each delivery, rejecting any fish that doesn't meet his standards. That must be why I enjoy eating here every time, that and the fresh cucumber, crab, ginger and other add-ons and sauce I add to my order. This is one of those word-of-mouth places you have to try because you won't see tons of ads all over town. It's hard to find good tasting fish in Arizona, but this place has it."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying out Poké Wave and I was not disappointed! I've tried several poke places around where I live and this place has fresh fish and seaweed salad, great sauce combinations and awesome customer service. I will definitely be going here again!!"}
{"text":"Got my order to go. Delicious!!!  I love all the options and flavors. Excellent customer service and attention. Couldn't believe there wasn't a line out the door!!  Best Miso soup. Will happily visit again!"}
{"text":"Delicious and super fresh fish! I really enjoyed my build your own bowl. The albacore was superb.  A plus is that there is a selection of sugar free and gluten free sauces to compliment any fish or salad."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff! Excellent food and they are not stingy with the toppings like many similar-concept restaurants in the area. Their specialty tuna is delish! I'll be a regular here for sure."}
{"text":"I've been here a few more times and I have to say my initial review may have been overly harsh. The fish has been super fresh on my subsequent visits. I really love the fact that they offer two different choices for greens instead of rice for those of avoiding carbs. I usually stick with the Aloha Classic and add a little edamame and seaweed salad. At some point though I need to branch out and try a \"waveritto\". I saw a bunch of those jumbo sushi rolls / sushi burritos when I was in Honolulu last year but never tried one."}
{"text":"There is definitely a wave of poke restaurants cascading throughout the Phoenix area and I'm not complaining! I was super hungry and a bit brain dead so I appreciated that there are pre-set options for poke bowls for those that don't feel like making a custom bowl. I went with the Aloha Classic, 3 scoops with spring salad. The classic comes with ahi tuna, onion, green onion, sesame seeds, red pepper flake, and classic Hawaiian shoyu. Not a bad combo at all! It was made in a speedy amount of time and I did add a few extra toppings (Cucumber kimchi, nori seaweed).   I enjoyed the bowl for the most part. The greens and fish were fresh and the toppings plentiful. The flavors all complimented each other well. The bowl was overdressed though, drenched in sauce so on some bites of salad all I could taste was the salty shoyu and nothing else. Eating 3 scoops of poke plus the salad base didn't quite fill my stomach up for lunch though so I had to scrounge for some more stuff to snack on afterwards.   Service was friendly and quick. I'll be back for more poke bites but I will ask for a lighter amount of sauce next time. Since we have no beaches here in AZ to surf any waves I will settle for riding poke waves!"}
{"text":"You guys, this little poke spot is my jam.  Do you know what I love so much about Poke Wave? Besides the obvious, it's the consistency.  The consistency of the food and service. It's family owned and boy does it show! They take so much pride in their business and it's appealing!  For dinner I ordered Hawaiian tuna and salmon as my protein on top of spring mix because I like to pick and choose where I eat my carbs. Of course you get brown or white rice or half rice/ half salad.  I pick all the toppings leaving little out, the more colorful the better and extra sauce please!  My sauce of choice is the sriracha aioli but other times I've gone in I order my favorite: wasabi aioli, I needed a switch up this go around.  I ordered the MISO soup for the first time but NOT my last, it was perfect. Super hot and super flavorful.   The toppings are perfectly paired together and none overpower one another, I love the Nori and fresh fruit options available.  The review is long overdue and deserves all 5 stars!! Thank you for taking quality care of your customers!"}
{"text":"A co worker introduced me to this place. It is far from where we live, but worth the drive. Healthy, fresh, and customer service was great !!! Definitely recommended for us Sushi lovers!"}
{"text":"I have been skeptical of the rapid spread of Poke restaurants of late but I would have to say the quality of the food at Poke Wave was excellent along with the flavor options.  Would definitely come back again.   Very clean with a warm and friendly staff."}
{"text":"I came in for a late lunch/early dinner on a Saturday around 3:40pm. The place was completely empty, but apparently this place is fairly new so it was to be expected.   I was greeted by a friendly girl who quickly helped me select my Poke bowl and was very helpful when asked questions.   The portions here are quite big, and definitely more Han enough to fill you up. The fish and all the other toppings were very fresh and tasty.   I'd come back again! Great first experience. :)"}
{"text":"I love poke and was very excited to hear that there was a new joint that opened up recently nearby. I took my younger sister (who is vegetarian) and my best friend in to try. I loved that there was a tofu option for my sister, she very much enjoyed her bowl, as it was her first. I've had many poke bowls, unfortunately, there wasn't any \"wow\" factor for me here. I didn't enjoy the atmosphere and the way the restaurant was set up wasn't very efficient. The vibe I got off was that it was family owned and the old couple who owned it decided to save their money by running the joint instead of hiring young works who can provide a better and more lively atmosphere that could potentially bring them in more revenue. They couldn't understand what I was ordering half of the time. I had to keep repeating myself and asking for additional scoops because they were skimpy. Also, I didn't like how the water wasn't self-serve. That's when I know they are really cheap."}
{"text":"My husband and I love Poke Wave!  We go there like once a week.  Always fresh.  The customer service is great too!  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"So far, I've been here once. The poke was solid. I selected a pre designed bowl and it was fresh, filling, flavorful and had the perfect amount of varying textures that I hope for in my poke. The place was super clean, well decorated and the staff was pleasant. You could tell there's a passion behind their work here and that's why I recommend this place. I was disappointed that my girl and I were the only two customers there during prime dinner hours.   Support this place. I think it's a great business.  4/5 because it's poke. And it was good poke, but these poke places all kind of do the same thing. Not sure I've ever been to a poke place I'd consider 5 stars. Poke Wave was one of the best I've had."}
{"text":"I love me some poki.. discovered this little gem in my new neighborhood, next door to the frys marketplace on Rural & Ray.. great find!  They offer the bowl & sushrittos (sushi burritos).. I always stick with the bowl..   On today's visit I had the bowl, with spring greens & brown rice, doubled up on the tuna .. opting for the cubed tuna & spicy tuna.. seaweed salad, pineapple, cucumber, avocado, lots of jalapeño .. ginger miso sauce.. fresh and delicious..  Clean, cute and very friendly service! I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"So good. Super clean, friendly service, really fresh and yummy. Better than the other poke places out there. Wide selection of sauces to try. Love it."}
{"text":"Ordered on uber eats. The food was so fresh and flavorful! Very big portions. Loved it!!!"}
{"text":"What I like about this place is that they have pre set signature bowls. Combinations that you know will be good. I like their Spicy AhI bowl, but don't be afraid to try any of the others! Their fish and sauces  are all good. I must go back to try the waverrito next time."}
{"text":"They have delicious poke! I really liked the sweet chili and Spicy Sesame Shoyu sauces. Also love the fact they have mango and pineapple , but if you are more for the sour they have a variety of pickled items to tickle your fancy. They also have preset bowls if you have issues with overthinking and can't decide (*cough cough* my sister). Other than that, they are similar to all the other poke places around the area. Prices are $9.50/small and $11.50/large. Friendly staff, and clean but small indoor dining area."}
{"text":"I'm no poke expert but my bowl was fresh and tasty, the citrus kale salad is a plus, some  Korean influenced poke selections, fresh fruit a plus, wish the water was self serve but will try again so much poke out their now"}
{"text":"I love this place a little more every time i come back. They have amazing customer service. The owner called me by name when I walk in that's so awesome that you would remember that with all the people that come in. The Citrus kale salad hands down by far is my favorite item and what sets them apart from every other poke Bowl place. Everything is always so fresh tasting and the portions are huge I get at least two meals out of it. They even comped my drink, I got the pineapple coconut tea. Oh my God let me tell you it is amazing."}
{"text":"I custom made my Bowl. I ordered the Large salad with two scoops of tako (octopus) and one scoop of tuna. The sauces I picked were the Spicy Seasame shoyu and lime ponzu. They have lots of toppings to choose from pineapple, mango, masago, cucumber, seaweed, dried garlic and onion and I forget the rest.  Regular is $9.50 two scoops of protein  Large is $11.25 three scoops of protein   The two sauces mixed have my bowl a spicy/citrus taste. If you don't like spicy, do not try the spicy seasame shoyu! I liked it, but most people won't.   They have lots of Hawaiian juices and drinks for sale.  Great food, everything tasted fresh, definitely will be back for more poke."}
{"text":"Plenty of healthy and delicious toppings to choose from. Sauces are great! Try lemon ponzu and their spicy chili sauce."}
{"text":"Tuna Ahi! Best food ever! Staff are super friendly an educated! Love this place!!!! Second time coming over an I'm sure will be coming back for more!!! I love house clean an fresh the food is"}
{"text":"Excellent poké spot. Family owned, and they don't charge you for every single add-on like other poké chains."}
{"text":"Best place to get a Poke Bowl!  The portions are generous, and plenty of fresh veggies and add-ons to choose from."}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients and tasty poke! The staff was very friendly and gave excellent service. They took their time making my bowl instead of rushing through it like other poke places I've been to. Keep it up poke wave!"}
{"text":"Okay here's the deal. This place is really good on many levels and yet it's lacking in a couple of key areas. Let me get to the good stuff first: The ahi was fresh, the rice was good, the sauces were tasty, the place was clean and the staff was great. The seared albacore was a really nice touch that was also really good. The problem is it's not a five star joint and people tend to throw that rating around as much as Ike threw around Tina. First of all they don't serve Diet Coke or even Diet Pepsi for that matter. in fact they don't have a soda machine at all. Second, the crab mix is styrofoam fake. It tasted OK but it's FAAAAKE! The spicy tuna was average at best and the scallops were about the same. So I have to say I'm looking at all these five star reviews and I'm thinking, um no, not quite. To be honest if you consider what yelp categorizes these star ratings as I'm being nice with a four."}
{"text":"omg i am im looooveee! this place has the best poke bowls in arizona! daniel and crew are awesome. i felt at home and shared a few laughs with  daniel lol i will definitely come back not just because of the great poke bowls but because of the experience"}
{"text":"Q:  What is the difference between a piano and a fish?  A:  You can tune a piano but you cannot tuna fish.  I know, I know, it seems like I eat a lot of poke --- and for the most part, I do!  It's usually on days when I take cycle class and I don't want to eat back the calories I just burned.  With that said, I was actually heading next door at Fry's to buy some cojita cheese for a Cinco de Mayo elote chip dip when I saw the light.  Like a moth, I was drawn towards it.  After poking my head inside, I learned that they were open for business.  Whoa!  I was just trying to creep around!  This place is heavily Korean influenced, rightfully so since the owners are Korean, and I love it. The kimchi cucumber is a great addition and the rice puff topping is fun. They offer a citrus kale salad base which is a nice option than the usual typical spring mix. Get white rice, brown rice, half-and-half, or a salad.  They have a huge selection for toppings, sauces, and mix-ins. Go wild!  The portions are generous and the protein is fresh, even at 8ish at night.  Their knife cuts are even.  I love that they have mangoes, pineapple, corn, and jalapeños.  I'm a sucker for some sweet and some heat.  Make me burn, babie!  It's $9.50 for two scoops of protein and $11.50 for three scoops.   The dining space is cozy and they do offer some outdoor seating.  The staff is friendly and very patient.  There were a lot of poke newbies inside and I don't think I heard even the slightest bit of irritation when they had to keep repeating and explaining things to customers.  Since they just opened on May 1st, they even gave us free iced teas because, \"it's a celebration!\"  How can you not fall in love with these guys!?"}
{"text":"This place is delicious! The best real poke I've had here in the valley hawaiian style!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  I had their spicy ahi tuna bowl with sriracha aoli sauce over brown rice and it was absolutely delish.  For my first visit I was a little overwhelmed with all of the choices of how to build a bowl, so I just opted for one of their signature bowls.  I'll definitely be going back as I build up familiarity with their selections, and maybe build my own bowl soon.  It is extremely tasty and very healthy food, and is very different from a lot of the boring chain store options in the area."}
