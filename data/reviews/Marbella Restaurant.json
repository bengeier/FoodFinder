{"text":"Quite possible one of the worst restaurants I've been to in Cleveland.  Service was bad, the environment was dirty (flies trying to fly out of the window next to our booth), food was gross.  The veggies that came with the entree were microwaved, it was ridiculous.  I understand the clientel are usually locals who do not know any better, but I would have imagined the universal tastebuds of a human being, no matter what locale they are from, would know this place is not good."}
{"text":"Visited Marbella for Sweetest Day and ordered the advertised special \"the clam bake\".  It was very very disappointing.  The clams were way overcooked and obviously not cleaned, leading them to taste like I was eating a sandy rubberband that had just been picked up out of a child's sandbox.  The lobster, while visually appealing was again tough and rubbery.  The vegetables that were served with dinner were not appealing at all.  They were barely cooked making you feel as if you were eating raw vegetables with no seasoning whatsoever. All be it a major disappointment, the carrot cake was very good and the Paella that the other party ordered was very good with more than enough to have a nice meal for the next day."}
{"text":"My family has been going to this restaurant for years and have enjoyed it every time. So we booked a table for 3 for 8 p.m. on New Year's Eve and even called that morning to double check. We even arrived early, despite the weather, only to get told they overbooked and was hour or more wait. Said something about people calling in and open table systems weren't combined. How can you not realize you are overbooked till that evening for a major holiday and not have the courtesy to call so people can try to find another place to enjoy the holiday instead of scrambling on the spot to salvage an already ruined evening. They were turning large parties away standing near us as well and no management was to be found! So unprofessional and frustrating! Like Dan J. below me said, we are never going back and will tell all what a horrible establishment it is!"}
{"text":"An extremely disappointing experiece, to say the least.  I went there hoping for an authentic Paella Valenciana, and ended up with a slightly soupy mess.  The rice was not dry and crispy on the bottom (the sign of a classic Paella Valenciana), the seafood tasted like it was boiled.  The shrimp were not deveined.  When I brought it up to the waiter his response was that was how they make it there.  Well, good to know, because I now know exactly were to go if I do not want authentic Spanish Paella Valenciana in Cleveland.  I will not be going back there."}
{"text":"I think that this is the most overlooked restaurant in the Beachwood area.  For some reason, it just never comes to mind, but when I drive down Chagrin Blvd I always remind myself to go here again.  Here's the deal with this place.  They have some really good food and some really not so good food.  Pick and choose wisely on the menu.  My suggestion is that you don't order anything seafood that is stuffed (this advice holds for just about anyplace as they are usually trying to get rid of old fish).  For some reason people I take there keep ordering stuffed sole or other fish even after I suggest they pick something else.  Guess that they walk into that plate of disappointment with their eyes open.  So what is good?  Any fish or seafood that is just straight up, cooked in some delicious broth or seasoning and eaten with the rice and veggies that come with every dish.  A couple friends of mine swear by their chicken cordon bleu.    And make sure that you try the fresh potato chips that come with your meal.  Delicious.    The servers are very attentive, sometimes overly so.  Some of the expediters don't speak English so well, so typically if you have some issue they will need to find your server to help you.  Give this place a shot.  In the summer, the patio is a delight to sit at."}
{"text":"Spanish food is not easy to find and always somewhat unusual. Even though I have traveled in Spain I was not really sure what to expect.  It's an upscale place - although we were wearing jeans - I might dress up a little more on a second visit.  Lovely dishes, full of flavor and spice and a very attentive waitstaff. It was very hard to choose what to order as there were so many things that looked interesting and delicious from the soup to dessert."}
{"text":"We've eaten here several times when visiting Cleveland and have never been disappointed. This isn't budget dining, and I'd probably feel a bit out of place wearing jeans, but we particularly like it for a special meal when staying in the Cleveland area. Service is attentive and a bit formal, without being stuffy, and we love the Spanish-inspired cusine. Particular favorites of ours include the gazpacho, the garlic soup, and paella. I'm a real gazpacho fan, but I find it really difficult to pass up Marbella's garic soup!  Our most recent trip, we tried the Spanish sausage appetizer (thinly sliced and spicy chorizo) and octopus appetizer (which included some filet meat in with the usual tentacle pieces and what was, for us, a more unusual flavor with its peppy paprika spicing), The paella comes in a particularly generous portion and we've found it more than enough to split between the two of us when we want some of the soup or appetizers. I'm usually not too thrilled to eat at a restaurant on a holiday because it's often disappointing. But we've been here a couple of times on Thanksgiving--and, yes, I opted for the Spanish specialties rather than turkey dinner then. It was one of the most pleasant Thanksgiving dinners we've ever had out at a restaurant as service and food were of as high of a quality as when we've been there on a non-holiday."}
{"text":"Boa Noite!  The orange roughy, trout, lobster, veal, lamb... - wow all to die for... very well prepared, have not had such a great meal since Lisbon! Appetizers were excellent, service was excellent (a few of the waiters don't speak English), music at the separate bar room. Pricey but well deserving.  The sangria was good, and the Maitre D's  surprise ending to dinner was well enjoyed ;-)  Saude!"}
{"text":"My paella was way overcooked, to the point of being inedible..  My wife's softshell crab was wonderful.  I ordered their calamari appetizer to replace my paella, which I sent back.  The calamari was really good.  Tasty and unusual gazpacho. Their wine list was curious.  Only a few Spanish choices, and only the pedestrian ones.  Their California choices are broad, and reasonably priced.  Service would rate a 2:  no wine list with the menus...took a while to get our wine...server assured me the Paella would not be overdone....later, he asked,\"Have they not brought your salads?\""}
{"text":"Anyone who wouldn't give this place 5 stars must not have ordered the paella. IT'S SO GOOD!!! and its HUGE. We went for lunch, which I highly recommend, and for $13 I was expecting a small portion. Nope. They brought out a huge pan loaded with chicken, shrimp, langostinos, lobster tail, scallops, mussels, I'm not sure if I missed something, but holy cow, it was wonderful. Glorious! The saffron rice was done perfectly, and it didn't have that dreadful \"fishy\" taste that you can get in a bad paella. I honestly don't know where else in Cleveland you could find a better paella. They also bring out sides of vegetables, potato chips (that part was random, but they were homemade!) and start you off with salad with a surprisingly good dressing. The service is great and the restaurant has a really nice ambiance."}
{"text":"I give Marbella a 4 stars, the atmosphere is nice and warm.  The service is very professional and the portion is Hugh.   I order their seafood bisque soup, very taste.  They are family style and all dinner come with small house salad, steam vegetable and home made potato chip (very good).  My wife has their seafood linguini and I order my seafood saffron rice.  They give you a lot of shell fish and the sauces are very good on both dishes.  The portion is so Hugh; we both can't finish them and have a nice lunch next day.  The price is very reasonable and gives you a good value"}
{"text":"A decent Spanish restaurant. Having been to Spain I can say that while the dishes may be Spanish inspired, they really don't compare. The flavors were fairly tame and nothing bold and spicy like a real spanish dish would have. Prices were a smidge too high, but the portions were quite generous...the paella dish I ordered could (and should) be split between two people. My dish was a little overcooked (especially the lobster) and they used the smallest clams and mussels they could find :)"}
{"text":"Disappointing. Tuna ordered medium rare and it was \"beyond medium\". Server was inattentive and simply rude; got the order wrong (my wife is a vegan, told him so, he brought pasta with chicken and shrimp then argued with her about what she ordered; replacement took another 10 minutes). Rest of food thoroughly average, and too expensive for average food. Decor is tired and a bit threadbare. However, the support staff (water and busboys) were very attentive and pleasant) - not quite enough to warrant recommending this mediocre restaurant."}
