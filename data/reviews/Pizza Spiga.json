{"text":"My girlfriend and I went to try Pizza Spiga for the first time ever last night. It was our night to leave our families at home and we wanted to try something different. We were extremely impressed with the quality and taste. Everything on the bar was hot; the cheese gooey, the meatballs perfect, the marinara sauce with just the right amount of sweetness, and a super fresh salad bar. Plus, the price was perfect. Service was friendly and there was never a time when the buffet diminished to a couple slices of this or that. What a kitchy jewel. I'll definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Best pizza ever, and meetballs fresh salad barr cold and sheep bears love the place  Staff is really  friendly the pizza on the buffet is always hot and fresh"}
{"text":"Pizza is below average, buffalo chicken pizza is good tho"}
{"text":"The pizza is pretty good honestly. Their cheese and pepperoni are their best pizza products. The salad is old and wilted, not sure if this is an isolate incident or not. Their pasta are not good especially their ravioli, they use too much sauce and way too much ricotta cheese. Their deserts are good especially their cheesecake. Strawberry is the best kind there. Overall this place is over priced.  If you get something there I recommend desert and pizza. Thankfully their wilted salads are free with most entrees."}
{"text":"Our family has received pizza delivery from Pizza Spiga for 16 years and we have always enjoyed it. The staff is consistently friendly and helpful. The product is always fresh and delicious. The price is a bit higher than most competitors, but it is absolutely worth it. Compared with other pizza available in the Matthews/Mint Hill area I would rate this the best and it's not close."}
{"text":"My experience was a good one.  The buffet items kept coming out hot and fresh!    They offer salad, soup, pizzas, stromboli, spaghetti, meatballs in marinara (excellent), bread sticks and dessert pizza.  I ate myself silly it was so good.  The prices are reasonable and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"I love their pizza, the sauce is very tomatoey (I know that's not a word).  I haven't had any of their food otherwise.   The pizza is cheap and the service is friendly."}
{"text":"What happened to this place? Years ago it was the best thing in mint hill. The owner sold it and the new guy ruined it, then the old owner came back but didn't really fix anything. Haven't been back in almost a year figured I'd give it a shot and walk in no one even acknowledges my wife and I. Just huddled around the register chatting it up with themselves. We seat ourselves as the sign says which is fine but immediately notice they shut down the pizza bar earlier now so that was sad since that's what I wanted, but OK. Server asks me what I want to drink and if I need time. I get a coke and tell her yes. Comes right back with the coke and asks if I'm ready..... I asked for a few minutes since I had no clue what I wanted, pizza bar was closed. 30 seconds later she comes back and asks what I'll be having. Frustrated I said I don't know and she offers the 10.99 pizza deal with two toppings. I ask if I can get bbq sauce instead of marinara and she looks at me crazy and says you can't get premium toppings. I said why does sauce count as a premium topping? Eventually she tells me the chicken is premium and that I should just order the bbq pizza and not get a combo deal. To get things rolling I agreed. Keep in mind... we were the only customers in there and yet it still took almost 20 minutes to get our food. The pizza was decent but the chicken was pretty dry, like it was microwaved then thrown on. The server never brought our ticket so we just walked up and had the person at the register print it out. I don't plan on going back."}
{"text":"The takeout pizza is definitely better then the buffet. We've had both and just prefer to go by there and pick up a pizza on Friday nights. The ranch dressing off the buffet is homemade and perfect on the buffalo chicken pizza. The calzones on the buffet dipped in the marinara sauce are amazing. Staff is always pleasant and quick to get you a refill."}
{"text":"Been going to this place for years. The girls on the waitstaff are hard working and friendly. The buffet is much better than CiCi's so we go here. The meatballs are the best thing on the buffet, however, they have put up a huge tacky sign on the sneeze guard that says:  LIMIT 6 MEATBALLS PER CUSTOMER.  It's a buffet and it's not all that cheap. I doubt there are many customers who can eat more than six. Tacky. It needs to be taken down. Other than that, everything else is not bad."}
{"text":"DIRTY KITCHEN. GOT SICK TWICE. The owner is a bald guy is rude & a Big guy who is his driver is Rude as well. I saw a pepperoni fall and they put it back on the pizza!!!!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here, will not be the last.  Salad bar is very fresh, fettuccine is home made. Alfredo sauce is rich and flavorful.  Marinara sauce is outstanding, as are the meatballs.  Garlic bread is nice and crusty on the outside, soft on the inside.  Very tasty.  Portion are large.  Go for dinner and you will have enough left for lunch the next day.  Service is excellent, fast and cheerful.  Water and tea glasses were kept filled.  Only negative, sit at a table, not a booth.  Booths are tight and difficult to get into and out of."}
{"text":"Just because a pizza place serves pizza doesn't mean its the best or only thing they serve. I've read reviews about this place all over the net and a bit upset with the ratings so here my review! :)  I am not a big buffet person, so I ask for the menu (or look at the board menu). The first thing I tried from Pizza Spiga is the Baked Ziti. I LOVE the Baked Ziti. I love it soooo much that I got it mmm maybe ATLEAST 5 times in a row. I finally decided to try some other dishes and I've tried the Lasagna which is ok, but the stromboli and calzone are DELICIOUS.  Some of the dishes come with salad and garlic bread. I hate the ranch they give when you order it to go, so instead I get the french dressing. When you sit in the ranch dressing taste better, so I'm assuming its different brand, or I'm crazy, lol.  I don't it the buffet and I haven't tried the pizza(s) yet, but I do enjoy other stuff on the menu."}
{"text":"We love Pizza Spiga.  They have the best Buffalo Chicken pizza I have ever eaten, the spaghetti is great and I love the Chicken soup.  The salad bar is always fresh and we just have never had a bad experience.  The buffet is awesome."}
{"text":"This place is super cheap but you also get what you pay for. For me it is a mediocre at best pizza spot. But for $6 during the day you get a whole pizza buffet with salad and dessert. Can not really beat that if your looking to eat a lot of pizza."}
{"text":"Food is on par with cici' pizza buffet. If you walk in with a low expectations you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I would give it zero stars if I could. This is the worst pizza ever. Cici's is better. Frozen Tombstone pizza is better. We only live about 2 miles from this place but I drive past it to get to better pizza (pretty much ANY pizza place). My husband got take-out tonight because the other 2 pizza places closed early & he was desperate. I tried a piece in the hopes it had improved. Nope, just as awful as the other 3-4 times. The crust is way too soft for \"thin crust\", skimpy on the cheese, and the sauce -- I've had better from a jar. Supposedly the original owner came back several months ago but the pizza has not gotten better. Their wings are not good either."}
{"text":"I can't believe we have lived less than a half mile from this place for the past two years and never tried it! Really great Italian food especially the subs and pasta. You MUST try this place   You can't beat the all you can eat pizza buffet either.  The decor is a little dated and looks a bit run down, but it's more like a neighborhood restaurant you would find in any small town.   I'm 100 % Italian. And thought everything was awesome from the Bruchetta  to the yummy cannoli  !  Beth was our server and she was attentive, personable and upbeat (we found out she worked there 17 years!).    This shopping center is at the intersection of Mint Hill Matthews Road and Idlewild Road which is going through major construction, but you can still get to restaurant.  Business has been slow since the construction so make your way over there and do them(and yourself) a favor. !"}
{"text":"My wife and I love their buffet and delivery. Always clean, friendly and great food."}
{"text":"Pizza Spiga is your typical pizza buffett with a few distinctives.  This laid-back Mint Hill establishment has withstood the influx of New Yorkers insisting on their style of pizza.  So before you visit, don't think you'll get an authentic NY, Buffalo, or Chicago pizza.  And don't even tell me or the fine folks at Spiga that that's how pizza is done elsewhere.  Before I get on my soapbox....  Pizza Spiga has a solid buffett: your staples like Pepporoni, Cheese, Speciality, and pastas.   The salads are good, not just iceberg lettuce and ranch.  They actually have good salad toppings. The bread sticks put Little Ceasar's to shame and the marinara actually tastes homemade.    The menu is worth checking out as well.  I love to get the meatball marinara.  Everything (minus the bread) tastes homemade.  And they layer it with a slab of provolone cheese.  I usually get this sub with onion rings.  And I wonder why I'm single.    I would have given it more stars, but there are so many pizza options these days that are as attractive.  Still if you want a bust-your-gut buffett for $7 that is a step up from most pizza chains, Spiga is a good bet."}
{"text":"Food is fine.  Buffet nothing to get real excited about.  But for a quick inexpensive lunch it's fine."}
{"text":"Been going to Pizza Spiga for years and we order deliver a few times a month also. I have tried pretty much everything on on the menu their Chicken Parmesan is  wonderful as well as their Chicken Broccoli Alfredo. They have creamy Chicken Marsala which I really like. The buffet is favorable especially for kids. The salad bar is good my only complaint is the lettuce choice is plain iceberg from a bag it could be a better quality. When we order pizza it is always delivered hot fresh and tasty they have a manager special that has 2 medium pizza's, bread sticks, wings, for 22.99 great deal for great food. Overall I enjoy it, lastly the service is great they have a waitress Beth and she is super sweet and always takes the best care of her customers."}
{"text":"The inside is very old and outdated. It's got a very grungy feel when you walk in. We went with the pizza buffet and it was just okay. A little better than Cicis but not by much. The salad bar was pretty decent though. I saw a kid that worked there open the back of salad mix (it's not freshly made) and use his bare hands to put more salad mix on top of the old stuff. That not okay. First in first out. Get a new container and fill it behind the counter with gloves....then put it out on the buffet. Just common sense things that I kept seeing people do wrong. Won't be back. There are much better pizza places that are local as well."}
{"text":"The food was good but the server was awesome Shelly!!! She was the best server I ever had"}
{"text":"We just moved to the area and a co-worker recommended I stop here for take out. I ordered the baked ziti and chicken Parmesan.  Both were delicious!  The sauce was great, portions were huge and they did not skimp on the cheese!  The buffet also smelled great. I look forward to trying the meatballs next time."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE !!!! Had stomach virus from this place two times !!!! Do not order or go !!!! DIRTY !!!"}
{"text":"My family and I would go to Spiga once a week growing up and it was always a great experience - the staff is very friendly and it's clear the owners are involved in the day-to-day operations of the restaurant. Great pizza and breadsticks, and I always go straight for the buffet.  I personally love the decor because it hasn't changed since I was younger and it makes me feel like time has stood still when I return. It's a great hole-in-the-wall, affordable pizza joint that I make sure I visit every time I make my way back to Charlotte. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"My family and I weren't aware of the closing time, so we accidentally arrived 30 minutes before closing. I felt so bad and apologized to all of the wonderful staff and they were SO nice. They even reloaded the salad bar and made fresh pizza. I was intending to use a coupon but I didn't. They're all amazing and the pizza is delicious."}
{"text":"ATTENTION.........   Phil Randazzo, the original owner is BACK.......  Service is back to Great.  He has changed the ingredients back to the high quality ones we all were used to.  If you haven't been to Pizza Spiga in awhile, I recommend you giving it a try.  You won't regret it.   Best Pizza place in the Mint Hill / Matthews area."}
{"text":"I use to go all the time when I lived in Matthews. To be honest I have never gotten anything except the buffet.  The buffet is always great especially if you get there right at 5pm all the pizzas are just coming out & are hot & fresh! A friend of mine got sick on the buffalo chicken pizza once so I steer clear of that one.  Other than that, everything is delicious!  I'm not a salad eater so I cannot comment on that.  The soup could be a little better, not much flavor & is always chicken & rice.  A different kind of soup would be nice for a change. The pepperoni & spinach Stromboli wheel is really good! Same with the spaghetti & meatballs!!  Normally I don't like meatballs but I like them here!  Pizza is always good.  For buffet & a coke bill comes to $11.89, so that's about average price.  If you haven't already go try it out!"}
{"text":"Grace's review was interesting. I almost wish she hadn't told us she was fired cause it's hard not to wonder if that played a role in her negative rating. I will assume it didn't and take a star off because of her inside info. However, still tastes pretty good. But now  . . . after reading Grace's review . . . I'll always wonder now about those pepperonis. Maybe going forward I'll just order Donatos instead."}
{"text":"I decided to eat here again, and the spaghetti was ok, they didn't drain the noodles well so it left extra water and that mixed with the sauce and it left it watery.  Besides the food the service wasn't good. The waitress was nice but slow with coming to check on us, we were the only people in the restaurant so that was very unacceptable.  She stayed at the front of the restaurant sitting in a chair playing on her phone. That's a major turn off when you have customers, then the rest of the girls at the front joined in with her in talking loudly about somebody's tattoos. The whole experience was very unprofessional ."}
{"text":"It's surprising how many decent pizza places you can find in strip malls.  Check out their lunch buffet - especially the stuffed bread with pepperoni.  Yum!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch one day. I had the buffet and my friend had the calzone. She loved it. The buffet has lots of choices. Plus it's clean. Nice options for your salad. Breadsticks are nice and garlicky. Pizza is good and not crunchy like it can sometimes be at buffets. Meatballs are good too!"}
{"text":"I  really enjoy this place.  I love the calzones. I also enjoy the pizza/salad bar. They have excellent lunch specials that you just can't beat! I used to go here at least 2 times a week when I worked nearby.  I look forward to going again. Good service too."}
{"text":"A pizza buffet for pizza buffet lovers. If you aren't really into the whole dried-out-slice sub-par-pasta-options basic-salad bar thing, this place ain't gonna do it for you.  If you can get past the crusty cheese and thinned-out Ranch dressing, tho, you'll bite into some slices and dig the chewy crust and flavorful ingredients, and pat yourself on the back for skipping out on Cici's.  Salad parts are pretty limited - no diced egg, for example. But what they do have is decent - crisp lettuce, good pepperoncinis, somewhat fresh cukes and tomatoes. Spinach stuffed bread was good. Even in the middle of dinner rush, things looked a bit tired, pizzas rarely refreshed. But hey, we're talking 6 bucks.  Service was surprisingly good.  Still, this place leaves me wishing for a Village Pizza Inn somewhere in town. That place I would (and do) drive out to Mint Hill (or Statesville, in VPI's case) for."}
{"text":"The buffet has a very nice variety of tasty and delicious food, you can really eat well here for around $10-12. A few things this place can do to improve: when you walk in, and everywhere you go in this restaurant, is smells heavily of cleaning supplies. Obviously they do a thorough job of wiping down tables here, but they should try and find an odorless solution. You can't smell the food, just the cleaning chemicals, it reduces appetite and is generally unpleasant.  Also, the workers here are friendly, but some of them act all silly and obnoxious like they are at home or out with their friends. One girl employee here was coughing really loud trying to show off to her co-workers how loud and crazy she can cough because she was a little sick or something."}
{"text":"I am surprised by the other reviews. We got a Calzone and it was very good. The pizza on the buffet looked fine and fresh although not anything outstanding.   They do have very good lunch specials although we seem to have been charged more for carry out. Still a fine deal though."}
