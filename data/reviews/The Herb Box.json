{"text":"Excellent breakfast food and staff!!!! Great for a Sunday of chilling and drinking! The wait staff was great and friendly and really on top of drinks.  The food was served fairly quickly with local fresh ingredients. We will be going back in the future to taste more of the menu"}
{"text":"Me and my date were only table in restaurant. Server was very attentive. Almost to a fault. Sometimes you just wanna be left alone to chat. But really I can not hold it against them for caring. Once I expressed that we were good and wanted time to chill they let us be. Food was good, but more to my dates liking than mine. Overall pretty good."}
{"text":"I liked this place, but it was on the pricey side.  Food was very good,. They have lots of salads and sandwiches.  If it was a special occasion, I'd go again.  The only other negatives is that the place is quite small, and it gets crowded.  When you go, don't always expect to find a seat."}
{"text":"The food is good, and ambience is nice. I have been 3 times, had the burger one time, the enchiladas and a salad another time. All the food was excellent and tasted fresh and clean. The service the three times I was here was not good. Lots of employees on the clock, but it isn't clear what most of them are doing. It wasn't busy any of the times I was here so don't know why the service lacked. With all the options in central Phoenix they will need to improve that to keep up."}
{"text":"Will never return. I'd reduce this to zero stars if I could. Food today was disgusting. Service was poor. Apparently the customer isn't right here.  There was hair in the food. Not on the food. Actually in the food. I pointed it out. Big mistake.  I will never set foot in this establishment again. The manager does not listen to the customers requests at all. This isn't over Herb Box you'll be hearing more about this issue."}
{"text":"I have been to this location several times and always had amazing food and great service! Tonight was awful! My friend and I both sent our food back because it was cold and the food they brought back was just as bad! The manager offered a free desert but we declined.. so she took $5 off each of our tickets.. super disappointed! Service was good but the food was AWFUL! Don't think we will be back!!!"}
{"text":"The herb box is one of my favorite places to take a date. Staff is extremely courteous an the food is always phenomenal. Could not be happier with the services provided."}
{"text":"DC Ranch Market Street Location...  So my wife, kids, and I were in town visiting friends we hadn't seen in awhile and they brought us here.  Their choices for restaurants are usually spot on though I must say The HERB BOX was a huge disappointment.  Being apart of The Slow Food movement I expected more.  The only thing SLOW was the service and smiles.  In a shopping center where stores are closing down left and right a smile can go a long way.  Instead we were ignored by the hostess who finally when deciding to realize that we were waiting for a table excused herself to locate us a place to sit on the patio.    Mind you it was a Saturday and the patio was empty (sign of the times, or the food and service?).  She then returned 10 minutes later surprised to see us  still waiting for a table.  Her attitude towards us because of having young children with us was appalling.  It's a Cafe/Bistro not a 3 star Michelin restaurant that only serves dinner!  My 4 year olds manners are better than hers are.  The food was also nothing exceptional, panini shouldn't take 30 minutes when there are no other people at the restaurant except wannabe socialites sitting at the bar patio side.  I would definitely not recommend this restaurant to anyone.  What a shame!!!  The HERB BOX will probably be the next store to close down in the DC Ranch Market street shopping center."}
{"text":"I ordered the turkey and avocado wrap, and it came rather quickly. The server was very polite and attentive. The food was very good as well. It was pricey though for what it is, but that's the only downside."}
{"text":"This casual dining spot was a first time treat. The service was great, the outside dining ambiance comfortable and the food choices and preparation made for a perfect luncheon with friends. The produce is organic and locally grown (as much as it can be) and our sandwiches, salads and flatbreads were creative and tasty. I don't give out many \"excellent\" ratings but The Herb Box deserves one. The serrano-avocado shrimp salad was particularly good. Nice beer and wine list and creative cocktails as well. Can't wait to come back to the Valley from Wisconsin and try this place again."}
{"text":"One star is really pushing it.  KRISTINA was our server's name and she was as terrible as they come. I only got her name because I actually saved our receipt with her name on it. Let's just get right into it.  *I am a server too and I STILL am sooo upset about this experience.   I came with the boyfriend to grab brunch yesterday afternoon because I heard they do amazing red velvet pancakes. We went to the hostess and they were polite, told us it would be a 15 minutes for inside and 20 for outside. We said we'd take first available.   We got seated sooner than expected outside on the patio (which is beautiful by the way; the only reason why this restaurant should even receive any stars). We had some time to look at the menu prior to getting seated so we knew what we wanted. Kristina came by about 5-10 after we had been seated, we ordered water,oj and coffee for the each of us. We also put in the order of the red velvet pancakes and and sriracha fried chicken.   Then we waited....  It took about 5-7 minutes for our drinks. No biggie, she's busy. No sugar caddy for our coffee. We wait to catch her. We don't see her. No biggie, my boyfriend just goes all the way to front of the restaurant to grab some.   Our coffees go empty but it's ok since we ordered OJ as well so we have something else to drink. Our food finally comes; served to us by a different server of course. We have no utensils. Awesome.  The guy who brought our food was so kind to bring us some.  The pancakes were good, nothing that special. Boyfriend's chicken had obviously been sitting at the window forever since his sriracha sauce was dried up on his place and his cole slaw was warm. Whatever we don't complain, it's fine. Up to this point we STILL haven't seen Kristina anywhere.   She finally appears when we're about half way through and asks how the food is, we say it's fine and she disappears again.   We're done with the food and we just want to get out of there now but of course our server is no where to be found. We see another server bussing a table and politely ask if we could get our check from our server since we had been waiting sometime now. This server was so apologetic and mentioned that everyone was quite busy and that she would find our server for us. She finally comes out with the bill; no apologies whatsoever and says \"here you go\"  We give the card right away an then she goes missing again for another 10 minutes.  I've had busy days myself but this server was just awful!!! I'm still so upset about my whole experience and how it ruined my whole afternoon. I'm pretty sure I'll never be back there and if I had Kristina as a server again I would be sure to peace out with a quickness!!!!"}
{"text":"I loved this restaurant, but after 2 bad experiences with their customer service I wont return.  The 1st time we waited 20 minutes to order food because the manager scheduled a staff meeting DURING the dinner hour. I had a 5 year old with me and the food took another 30 minutes once finally ordered.  No apologies from the waitress or manager. The 2nd time I arrived on a Tuesday at 5 pm and was very rudely told by the hostess that without a reservation there was a 2 hour wait. When I questioned the hostess as the restaurant had 4 only tables occupied, she offered me the patio. It's Arizona in August (no way)!"}
{"text":"Fantastic waiter, brought my dog water and gave us honest feedback on menu items. The kale curry (?) appetizer was amazing."}
{"text":"Nice place. I had the kale and goat cheese quiche. Not very good. It had a watery taste. My husband had chicken and goat cheese panini and brussel sprouts as side dish. He said it was ok. So the the two stars are for the panini. One star for the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Excellent service, good music and great food."}
{"text":"This is a great place for a quick lunch, very fresh and refreshing food. Love how unique the food and menu items are and it's not something crazy that I ordered but I just really loved the atmosphere and food!"}
{"text":"I ate brunch there last Sunday. I had the red velvet pancakes.  Yumm!!!  The food, the waiter, the atmosphere and even the bathroom decor was 100% what a sunny, mimosa-filled brunch day in Scottsdale should be.    It was truly difficult to choose only one meal because the menu is fabulous.  They have a mimosa deal that if you get an entre and the mimosa deal, it's about $20 or so and it's as many mimosas you can drink.  They had four flavors: original (oj), grapefruit juice, cranberry and mango.  Their mimosas are mostly champagne, which made me extra happy!  The waiter was very attentive and thoughtful despite the place being very busy.  And he, like many who work there, was easy on the eyes.  The bathroom looks like something out of Alice in Wonderland or Regina's office on Once Upon a Time, i.e., black, white and mirrors.  Very nice/ elegant, although I was confused when I thought the wall was moving (just a mirrored door) to the stall.  There was some good people watching going on that day.  I apparently didn't get the memo that it was pink day.  Lots of people wearing pink, even men in golf-style pink shirts.  A lot of the women looked over processed, but it's Scottsdale, so what do you expect?  It's fun to watch the scene.  I would highly recommend this place to others.  The only down side is that I called and made a reservation ahead of time and they had no record of it, despite a 5 minute conversation to set up the reservation.  They still accommodated my part, however."}
{"text":"Recently moved to Scottsdale and are just getting familiar with local restaurants.  My husband and I really enjoy our dinners here.  Modern food, but not too far out.  Very tasty.  He had roast chicken and I had trout.  Dessert was very good too.  Salted caramel creme brulee with maple pecan shortbread.  This will be a regular place for us.  Much better than other local restaurants we've tried.  The decor could use some improvement."}
{"text":"I love sitting outside here! The atmosphere is great. Our waiter was very nice and helpful. I had the sweet potato tacos and they're sooo delicious I can't wait to go back and get them again. I also had the red sangria which was lovely."}
{"text":"I like the Herb Box but I don't find myself dying to go back. Their food is good, but the service isn't as friendly as their small space and atmosphere suggests.   Their brunch is a definite highlight, besides the decor and cool location."}
{"text":"Lovely place for an outdoor glass of wine when the weather is nice. The ambiance is a bit manufactured but what to you expect on a canal bank called The Scottsdale Waterfront. LOL"}
{"text":"Been to this location about 5 times now. Very unique food options and always delicious.   Extensive wine list and fun cocktails!  Great service.   Love this place."}
{"text":"Just went for my first time last night with \"the \"girls\". Two of us heard about it and after I read the reviews and checked out the menu it was slated for our next night out. Anyway we had a memorable evening with wine, the make-your-own cheeseboard and the to-die-for pear and gorganzola flatbread pizza. It was topped with fried sage leaves -- different and delicious. Afterward we were able to fit dessert and shared a huge slice of fresh layer cake filled and frosted with dark chocolate. Sublime! Can't wait to go back and try other dishes - definitely made it to my 'Restaurants to Frequent' list :)"}
{"text":"Simply put 5 star perfection. The service from TY or waiter was impeccable. A menu filled with farm fresh ingredients prepared to perfection. Topped off with some delicious sweets surrounded by a nice atmosphere made for a GREAT lunch!"}
{"text":"Food and service was great. The aesthetic of it is gorgeous but I often heard the waitresses and waiters arguing and it kinda ruined the atmosphere"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. Great location in DC Ranch and a wide variety of healthy  / vegetarian options and I've tried the other locations and loved it! However the service at this location was beyond horrible. After a 10 minute wait to even be greeted, our frazzled waitress shows up. No, \"here's the specials\", \"any questions on the menu\", straight to the order. Fine, I'm starving anyway, let's get this over with.   25 minutes and 0 ice tea refills later and our order shows up. My flatbread order \"hold the bacon\" shows up with bacon all over it. Having gone vegetarian 7 years earlier, it was not an option to pick it off. Although I was seriously considering it because at this point, my blood sugar level was low from hunger I was about to start gnawing on the table. I only discovered this after it was dropped off, it was literally a dump and run. No checking back on us, she was MIA. After 10 minutes, I went off in search of someone who could help. The new waitress assured me that they would fix it and send another one out. 12 minutes later my lunch companion is finished with his meal and my hunger is no longer an issue because in the 30+ minutes this has been going on, the tea was never refilled. Thirst is now a bigger issue.   I finally decided to throw in the towel and ask for the check. She asked me if I wanted the $15 flatbread to go, it would be up in a minute ....um, no thanks. Would you like a tea refill to go? Um... no. Maybe 30 minutes ago. Please for the love of god, drop the check and let me out of here."}
{"text":"This was my first time here after hearing such great things.  Didn't realize that they had multiple locations.  We showed up for brunch around 9:30am and were able to beat the crowd, luckily as we had 7 people.  Very relaxed posh setting with a great desert feel on the patio.  The Chiliequiles were very succulent...not that you get to use that word often!  Very simple dish, but the eggs and pulled pork are great on the tortillas.  They also had $5 mango mimosas and very spicy bloody marys.  I'll be happy to return again.  The brunch menu looked exactly the same as the normal menu.  Would like to see some specialties/variety or perhaps a deal like a dish and drink for $15.    Would be a great place for Mother's Day brunch"}
{"text":"This is our favorite in Scottsdale. We loved here so much from our last trip. We came back! Their salad is exceptional with light dressing with lots of flavors. My husband and I were impressed from appetizer to dessert! Love their ambience as it's casual yet comfortably classy. Price is just right for the portion and the quality of food. We will definitely go back before we head back to New York."}
{"text":"First time eating here today.   Initial impressions: 1. Great vibe / ambiance. When it gets nicer out, I can't wait to sit and have a nice lunch on the patio.  2. Very classy at a reasonable price.  3. Great Food.  4. Great service - nice personable service people. (From reading other reviews, maybe that's not consistent... but I certainly was well taken care of today.)  I had the pulled pork ciabatta. I loved Chef Becky's interpretation of a classic pulled pork sandwich. Slightly more tex-mex or southwestern on the flavor profile, with a nice salad on top in lieu of coleslaw (which I typically don't like on my pulled pork sandwiches anyway). The salad had some jicama, which was a nice crispy texture and  mellow flavor to balance the otherwise soft texture and spicy flavor of the sandwich.  I had wanted to stop myself before eating my whole plate of sweet potato chips... but they're amazing. Bet you can't eat just one!  I'll definitely be back. I want to try more dishes before I give it 5 stars."}
{"text":"The Herb Box is a fantastic place to have lunch or get something to go!  I have eaten in as well as to go many times and yesterday stopped by and took home the Turkey Avocado wrap, sweet potato chips and Oatmeal cookie (so large I could only have a few bites)... I couldn't help but have a cheat meal I hadn't been in awhile!  DELICIOUS!!     I normally do NOT order wraps anywhere, but they are so wonderful here!  Again I do not usually get desert but their cookies are wonderful, the oatmeal cookie really tastes like oatmeal and raisins instead of a pile of sugar.  Everything is so fresh and high quality..... Did I mention they have Diet Coke, a must in my book...... and it is free refills which isn't out of the ordinary, but the specialty is it is poured from the CAN!  The most amazing little restaurant!  I love the feeling I have when I am there!  It is a place you want to bring a book and enjoy alone or with friends.  It is small but that is the attraction.  To Go is always great at this restaurant, not like others where you do not get the same quality!  This might be because they are a catering company.  I am new to Arizona and miss having lunch with my girlfriends.  When I come here not only is the food wonderful I feel like I am a part of something.  It's Great!  P.S.  I see there is a location in DC Ranch now and looks like it is more than just a lunch place, I will have to try this but for now only have experienced the original.....  Love IT!  :)"}
{"text":"This place used to be my favorite...but they've changed the menu and place little value on customer service anymore. We usually eat her for our girlfriend lunches but we will be changing our location. We had a reservation for the large table in back but were seated at an uncomfortable, pulled together high tables that left large gaps so the plates didn't even fit well on the table. The service was slow, she forgot to take on persons order. I ordered the brussel sprout flat bread and there was about one brussel sprout on the entire thing.  We had brought a cake from Nothing Bundt Cakes, the same thing we do at every luncheon we've had there in the past 4+years we've been doing our Bday lunches there. We were told we couldn't bring outside food and the manager wouldn't budge. We had desert there and it was terrible. He actually comped us one of everything, after we complained and said we weren't coming back. We couldn't even eat it. Every item was dry and inedible. I'm a dessert person, so I really wanted to like these, but don't waste your money. So sad my favorite place has declined so much in the past few years. We will be finding a new \"go to \" place for all of our Bday lady luncheons:("}
{"text":"This place is great for lunch. The location can't be beat, in the heart of old town Scottsdale where there is usually something going on like craft fairs, music or some special event. I have gotten into a rut ordering the amazing Market Sunflower salad over and over again. It truly is a great salad. During the fall, I've had the butternut squash soup....wonderful. Friends I have been with ordered the flatbread with goat cheese & pear and the chicken blt sandwich both were excellent. This place is a must visit when your in old town."}
{"text":"The Herb Box is a little hard to find for first timers, but worth your effort to get there.  You have to turn up a street that looks like you are going to a residential area before you get there and then it is tucked into a strip mall.  The Herb Box offers a wide range menu with a good selection of grab and go dinners/lunches in the cold case in the bar/pick up side of the restaurant.  They actually have two suites that are side by side that offer sit down and pickup.    If you are getting To Go or Pickup orders, they do a nice job of using good quality boxes that keep the food protected and warm.  They also will sell their salad dressings (vinagarette = yum) in nice glass take home bottles.   I highly recommend the Butternut Squash Enchiladas.  They are little more pricey than everything else on the menu and lack a true side, but they are very rich in flavor and have a very pleasant spicy taste that trailers the sweetness the butternut squash offers.  They are also cooked to perfection leaving the cheese nicely melted and crisping up the shell without it becoming soggy.  They offer a nice variety of salads and side options.  Another few notes, the mac n' cheese in the To Go case is a good reheat item to take home for a side or late night snack or powerful enough for a dinner.  The vinegarette  goes great with an orzo pasta and feta cheese.  The take home baked goods are very tasty.  Cozy little cafe style feel at The Herb Box and a simple menu with big flavor give this a 4 star rating!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff and great food. The hostess was very accommodating, I had my huge baby stroller with me. She sat our group in a large space so we didn't feel like we were crowding the table next to us. The flat bread and salad were good. A little overpriced but decent for Scottsdale and location on the canal. I love the outdoor seating here, lovely plants and trees make you feel as if you are dining in a garden."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant and I highly recommend you order the MangoLemonade, it truly is the best for being home made, I also, ordered the grapefruit salmon plate. We had a very enthusiastic waiter. I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I don't think words can really express my long-term love for The Herb Box.  Back when I lived in Phoenix, I probably visited The Herb Box about 3-4 times a month (and oft resisted going even more frequently).  Ambiance: It's everything you want in a cute lunch place.  You can see and be seen, hide away in a corner, or enjoy misters outside.  The place has character, the sweets are displayed for you to devour with your eyes, and it's relaxing to be there.  Appetizers: The Roasted Red Pepper Hummus is a MUST HAVE.  Served with fresh, home-made pita chips (often still warm) and a wonderful, substantive hummus with a bit of a bite, I can't get enough.  Entree: My die-hard favorite (and what I would eat as my last meal on earth) is the Grilled Chicken and Sage Pesto Sandwich (without the greens).  It's beautiful, white meat chicken on ciabatta, with a pesto spread, fresh bacon bits, sliced apple, and goat cheese.  Served with a side of fresh and crisp sweet potato chips, the contrast and deliciousness is amazing.  Simply unbeatable.  Dessert:  They have a chef who specializes and clearly rejoices in making sweets, so they always have something different to choose from.  Check out the options while you're there to decide.  Some of my favorites have been: Whoopie Pies, Almond Chocolate Chip Cookies, and Espresso Cookies.  Service:  The servers are always friendly and helpful.  Get to know them and you get even better service.  Marlee, who's been my favorite server for the last 3 years, is out of this world and super friendly.  The owner is also often there and is very sweet.  The Market:  I used to get take out from The Herb Box all the time and let me tell you: it's just as delicious at home or at the office.  Anyway, you pick it up on The Market side of the establishment, where you can also find tons of other ready-made tasties to go.  They sell their super fresh, beautifully dusted sweet potato chips there in larger bags.  It's definitely worth stopping by.  Catering:  The Herb Box actually stared as a catering company and I've had them cater several parties.  Their staff is ultra-friendly and accommodating and will remember you afterwards when you stop in the restaurant too.  They put out a beautiful spread of sandwiches, wraps, cheese spreads, and whatever else you ask for!  This place is a must visit if you live in Arizona or visit Phoenix or Scottsdale.  Do whatever it takes to get yourself there and become as obsessed as I am.  If you're wondering what their current sweet is or if anything new is going on with them, check them out on twitter: www.twitter.com/theherbbox"}
{"text":"When choosing to dine at The Herb Box I was quickly impressed by their menu selection. The food was very healthy and a great spot to take some girlfriends. The atmosphere was relaxing and service was average. I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"My family and I had a lovely lunch at The Herb Box in Old Town on our way to the Desert Botanical Gardens! The food was delicious, fresh and reasonable. We started with the avocado toast, falafel, and mac and cheese (yum!) and then I had the cauliflower and quinoa bowl with salmon! A great meal. Definitely recommend. Kid friendly, but not too loud. Would love to go back for dinner sometime soon."}
{"text":"Vegetarian and gluten free heaven! We had lunch on a beautiful sunny Scottsdale afternoon. Beautiful restaurant inside and in the outside seating area. I had the Grow Happy salad, one of the freshest salads ever with house made honey lemon dressing and the sweet potato tacos with mango and black bean salsa, just a perfect vegetarian dish and done gluten free as well! Hubby had short rib enchiladas which he said were excellent! Only reason I'm not giving  five stars is because I was up charged $3.50 for hot water, who does that? Seriously!  Make sure you visit the bakery and market next-door! They had several gluten-free options, great  coffee and tea selections and lots of healthy eating options as well! We thoroughly enjoyed our coffee and desserts sitting outside in their lovely patio area. We will definitely be returning on our next trip to Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Ridiculously expensive and horrible service. My enchiladas came cold and I didn't see my waiter for fifteen minutes after I got my food, not even worth telling him they were cold. He knew nothing about the menu and had no social skills or serving skills. He said he'd never even eaten anything on the menu... then when we got the check he stood by our table and stared at the bill waiting for his tip. Would not go back... I'm actually really confused why there are any good ratings for this restaurant. The only good things were the drinks and the ambience. If you go for brunch, look out for the middle aged socially awkward guy with black hair, HE SUCKS as a server. I worked in the service industry for a very reputable restaurant and he was the opposite of what a server is supposed to be. So disappointed."}
{"text":"Really like the steak and pork sandwiches on ciabatta. Creative fresh salads. Veggie nosh a very fun thing, different veggies brought to you on a platter in separate bowls. The tzatziki is refreshing and nice for sharing with pita/sweet potato chips. They have great mixed drinks and a cute little market around the corner with prepared foods/desserts baked fresh daily."}
{"text":"The food is good here at The Herb Box; however, the service is very Poor!! I have been a patron of this restaurant for a little over a year now, frequenting the restaurant whenever I'm in town. Sadly, I have begun to see a decline in the quality of the customer service and wait staff. Being an entrepreneur myself, I felt it important to notify the management; however, it quickly became clear why the service has begun to suffer... There are  better restaurants in the vicinity with a larger selection of food with great service!!"}
{"text":"After a long day of hiking and touring Taliesin West, my husband and I found this place on Yelp. Started with two cocktails. The server couldn't provide too many details about the wine I ordered, so he was thoughtful enough to provide me a sample taste before committing. My husband and I split both the Korean Fried Cauliflower---Amazing combinations of flavors. We then shared a small plate of Brussel Sprout \"chips\" which were also very well done--the addition of the vegan aioli was a good combination.  Finally we shared the Serrano- avocado shrimp salad which was delightful. Overall great service, great modern atmosphere and high quality food that was well thought out and prepared made for a enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"Food was great in theory, but don't expect any dietary restrictions you have to be competently accommodated. Example: can't eat most grains, so ask for the shrimp on the salad to be grilled (rather than battered and fried), and the avocado not to be on toast. Shrimp grilled, but avocado appears mashed and spread on toast AND the server failed to mention that the fennel on the salad is also battered and fried. This silliness happened after I had already asked about tweaking two other items to be to accommodate dietary restrictions, and was told that everything is \"made fresh\" except for, apparently, those other two items.  This appears to be part-and-parcel of the service problems referred to by other reviewers; our service was also extraordinarily SLOW. One member of our party waited 10 minutes for his food after the rest had been delivered.   To top it off, I'm not really sure what the restaurant is doing having the gardener moving around whatever buckets and cloths and chemicals/pesticides he's using in the immediate vicinity of actively eating tables. It's not like the place is open for breakfast during the week, couldn't the owners have scheduled plant maintenance for a morning?"}
{"text":"Went here for Mother's Day and started out with a pineapple mimosa which was pretty delicious. Shared the Bourbon-Ginger Peach Brioche French Toast and Smoked Salmon Hash with my husband and was not overly impressed. The Smoked Salmon Hash was only edible if you put the sauce it came with all over it, my husband could not even eat it, so I was stuck eating that while he ate most of the French Toast, which was also just okay. Our waitress was friendly but would often have to be reminded that we needed something. Unfortunately, we will not be returning because you did not get what you paid for."}
{"text":"I went for a coffee and a bite to eat on Sunday afternoon.  The patio is a great fun atmosphere. Food was great.  However the service, although our server did have a great attitude was very very very slowwwwwww!  It was my first time there and I will try anything twice..."}
{"text":"Excellent food! Very healthy, so you won't feel bad about eating too much here. There's something for everyone, so even if you're not into the kale fad, you'll still be able to find something on the menu you love. The drinks are great too!"}
{"text":"DO NOT SPEND MONEY here. Was just informed the night before Mother's Day that my reservation could no longer be accommodated as requested. When the manager got on the phone he did absolutely nothing to rectify the situation. He said it got filled up a week ago, so why was I only called the night before then? Then when I said I was extremely unhappy with his argumentative tone over the phone and that I would def write a review he said \"it's probably best that you DONT dine with us\" and the only way he'd guarantee my reservation at that point was with a credit card. It really is a shame that you will lose me as a customer after frequenting your restaurants for many years."}
{"text":"Had lunch here this past weekend and I loved it!! Wish I knew about this place before! Their Korean fried cauliflower was amazing. I had a chicken salad which was pretty good as well. Husband had their ribs and 2 orders of their Mac and cheese, it was that good! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Love this place. It is always good and such a fun place to take a group. The services is good and makes you want to come back. I have been with family and friends and also gone for work lunches never a disappointment. Also the sweets are delish."}
{"text":"Awesome food!! The cutest restaurant in DC Ranch. A little pricey, but great place to go with a group."}
{"text":"Could not get into our favourite Olive and Ivy on Super Bowl Saturday for breakfast as it was closed for a private NFL function. So we walked across the bridge to the Herb Box. Hostesses were quite welcoming, but we found the dining room to be sterile and lacking warmth. Ordered the breakfast burrito...worst I have ever tasted. It was just a whole lot of egg in a tortilla. There were supposed to be black beans and queso, but there were about 5 beans, and a tiny sprinkle of queso on top. It desperately needed some salt and pepper...but not one salt and pepper shaker could be found in the entire dining room.....and our server had disappeared too. The salsa was horrible. Finally found the server and asked for some pico, but they didn't have any other salsas. Also ordered \"crispy\" fingerling potatoes which were not crispy at all, but reasonably tasty with a nice sauce. Server disappeared again, had to get up and go to the hostess and ask her to have our server bring the bill.  We will never go back."}
{"text":"This place was pretty awesome and I'm glad we found it. Not only is it in a wonderful location (for Phoenix) next to the canal in Scottsdale, but the food is really good too. My fiance and I ordered a lot of food without realizing how much food we actually order so I was great for left overs the next day.  We ordered the pear and gorgonzola flat bread, the crab dip, trout beignets, corn enchiladas, glazed salmon, and the side order of smoked gouda mac n' cheese...all for about $80. So between 2 people and multiple extra servings to take home, it was well worth it. The portions are great and not claim jumper large, the quality is great and the service was awesome as well. The to-go containers were separated and labeled so the hash that came with the salmon was in a separate container and the salad that came with the enchiladas were done in the same manner as well.  I will definitely come back to try more food, but this time we are going to try to not order as much so we have room to try and judge the desserts."}
{"text":"This is a good place for drinks and apps before going out in Old Town.  Cool atmosphere.  Good drinks.  Not too crowded.  The patio is also nice and sometimes there's live music either on the patio or in the courtyard."}
{"text":"Service was great....kudos to Ashton. The rest of the story was not quite the same. Cold food, rude support staff, and a  manager full of excuses. Run the other way!"}
{"text":"Nice setting but rude service.  Arrived at 3:10 on a weekday and was told in no uncertain terms lunch is over . . dinner only.  Table of 5 of us ask for bread with apps and then get charged for it!  And not an inexpensive spot either.  Food was nothing to get too excited about but I'll give the patio kudos for drinks"}
{"text":"Every time I visit Arizona, my family knows coming here at least twice is a must. A few words for you... gouda mac and cheese. If that isn't enough, the rest of their menu is so amazing and you can get really healthy entrees. The service has always been amazing."}
{"text":"Very delicious and fresh food! I love the various menu items and what they have to offer. We came here for dinner with a friend from out of town, and everyone at our table was more than satisfied! I love how this place supports local produce and farms. Yum!"}

{"text":"Delicious macaroni & cheese. Bread crumbs are a nice touch and the blend of cheeses is unique.   Everything was pretty reasonably priced, too.  We had the beef tacos, fritas, and mac & cheese and with tip I think we spent under $30.   Awesome atmosphere, too."}
{"text":"Great brunch spot. The DC Ranch location is set back from the road and could be a little difficult to find. That said, it is well worth the search."}
{"text":"4 stars for the delicious sandwich we took to go.  Can't give it 5 stars until we actually eat here.  We had the brown sugar jerked pork with sweet red pepper and jicama slaw, watercress & smoked gouda on toasted ciabatta $11.  A bit pricey for a take-out sandwich.  The filling was generous and tasty with a nice balance of flavors and textures.  The place is cute and service was very friendly."}
{"text":"What a fantastic addition to the neighborhood! Loved the Brussels sprouts appetizer with extra aioli. Excellent drink menu. Perfect service from a charming server named Justice."}
{"text":"I took my daughter and daughter-in-law here last Saturday.  The food was tasty -- if a little overpriced, but what can you expect from Scottsdale?  The service was not very good though. They were not very busy so I was surprised at how long it took just to get two glasses of water and an iced tea. Incidentally DON'T have the iced tea -- it's really hideous.  We each had a lunch wrap which was filling and fairly good.  The sweet potato chips were the best part of the meal.  I'd go for the ambience and for the food but not for the service.  Really.....work on it!"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere and decor. Very comfortable. We just ordered some apps- the pakora and a small plate of blistered peppers.Both were delicious. I will be back to have dinner."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Bland food.  Manager was completely inconsiderate. Would never come back here."}
{"text":"My office picked up some food from the market at The Herb Box Southbridge for lunch yesterday. It was AMAZING!  Butternut squash with pomegranate, roasted veggie, black eyed pea salad, steak salad, roasted brussel sprouts and plantain chips....So delicious, words cannot even describe!  Perfect smorgasbord!   Plus, the entire office has been on a health-kick what with New Year's weight-loss resolutions and all...all the tastiness and none of the guilt.  I'd highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a quality meal that won't break the bank or your diet! Can't wait to try the eatery side..."}
{"text":"I have been to the Herb box for lunch  twice and have loved it each time. Located in the very chic DC ranch at Pima, the restaurant is best enjoyed if seated outside in the patio on a lovely March afternoon.  The mango lemonade is very soothing and the refills keep coming. Had the salmon with tsatziki and a side if the sweet potato chips . The salmon here is one of the best i have eaten and the chips are really addictive.  I didnt have dessert this time around but have tried their graham cracker chocolate mousee before and its delicious.  Would love to go back whenever the weather permits patio seating."}
{"text":"I don't give places 5 stars cuz there's nothing perfect about anything. However this place comes very close. The hostess was welcoming, the dining room is beautiful and perfectly lit. The chairs are not your average dining chair and they are more than comfortable.   Presentation is spectacular and the taste is divine.   This is a great place to take a date or do a business lunch. It's very impressive.   The salmon was very good, a little sweet for my taste but you'd love it. Everything was up to par and I have no complaints.    Definitely will be back"}
{"text":"The Herb Box set the scene for an elaborate bat mitzvah party that i planned for my daughter the first weekend of April 2017. We shut the restaurant to public, brought in a dj and caricaturist, and enjoyed the entire facility for ourselves.  There were some bumps in the road with scheduling, but the end result was fantastic. It was not the usual kind of event that they usually host, but it was pulled off wonderfully. The food was fresh and everyone raved. The dessert buffet was descended upon like no one had seen sugar in a year, and the prosecco flowed the whole night.   Thanks to Katia and the whole team for making mine and my daughter's vision a reality.  We look forward to dining at the Herb Box on a regular night in the future."}
{"text":"This location at DC Ranch is my favorite.. love sitting at the bar for a cocktail and dinner food is amazing and the service it great feels like family"}
{"text":"Best brunch place! Love the environment and vibe. Great staff! The pastries are to die for. Must try if you have not already."}
{"text":"Amazing, amazing food! I loved the variety/selection of the menu. I ate the chilled ciliantro lime crabdip and rosemary roasted grape and brie crostini and both were full of flavor. It tasted like all of the ingredients were fresh and after eating unhealthy food lately, it was nice to feel good after my meal."}
{"text":"Great place!  A must go!  Herb Box especially on a Sunday is leisurely place.  Food is amazing.  Service is great. Perfect time to just hang out, leisurely, meet new people.  A must go!"}
{"text":"It's very hard to find soup in this town so when I learned The Herb Box had white bean chicken chili I knew I had to try it out. I went into the small coffee shop underneath the restaurant not realizing it was 2 different parts of the same place. Since I was by myself and not necessarily looking for a long sit-down meal, the coffee shop served my purposes well.  I ordered a bowl of the white bean chicken chili and a cup of hot tea. The chili was incredible. Not too heavy and with a sauce drizzled on top that I thought at first might not be that great - gosh was I wrong! Whatever the sauce was it completely made the chili. I could have very easily had another bowl if not for the price!   The tea was an organic chai that I ended up not liking but there are several organic teas to choose from. It was also served in a very small cup though I imagine they will give you more hot water if you ask. I didn't ask as I didn't like the tea I chose - didn't complain either because  I chose it. ;-)  Overall the food is out of this world. The service was exceptional. The prices were high. But I will be returning."}
{"text":"All I can say is \"mmmm mmmm good\"! I've gone more times than I can count for lunch and serioulsy loved both locations.   My favorite is the Grilled Chicken & Sage Pesto but have also tried (and loved) Tzatziki - Humas - Olives with Pitas, White Bean Chicken Chile, Turkey, Apple & Swiss Wrap & finally the Apple & Frisee Slaw . Oh and lets not forget about the Sweet Potato Chips!    One downside is they charge you $5 to split plates! Seriously?! And that I'm afraid is why they only get 4 stars from me."}
{"text":"The Herb Box - A great choice for lunch when you want a healthy, fresh salad or wrap.  The daily specials are also tasty.  I have dined at this restaurant more than ten times with a consistently positive experience.  The seating is in close proximity but the decor charming."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Old Town hands down. Great patio on the canal when the weather is nice and gorgeous decor inside when it's too hot. I have never ordered something I didn't love."}
{"text":"Sunday brunch. Food was ok, the salmon hash wasn't fantastic but it wasn't bad. We ordered crab dip to share, never made it to our table. Turned out to be a good thing because the portions were generous but the oversight was never acknowledged by our server (we told the person that brought our entrees). I'd go back to try something else, the environment is comfortable and we didn't have to wait for a table."}
{"text":"I came to visit the Phoenix area for the weekend from Seattle. Recently I've become more of a foodie and I was pleasantly surprised by how amazing this place was. I didn't know this about Scottsdale!   Ordered a cocktail to start off and it was absolutely amazing. Nicely hand crafted. For dinner, I had the fried cauliflower, Thai baby back ribs, and mac and cheese. All very well made and delicious. Loved it!"}
{"text":"Ok spot but not life changing or really special.  I ordered the salmon and the portion was relatively small and I had to order more food.  I'm not a big eater either but this stuck out at me.    I then ordered some sweet potato chips and these were actually pretty decent as they were not covered in sugar.  Anyways, atmosphere was a winner too and staff was very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Was taken to the Herb Box for a business lunch and was excited to try it since I had recently read an article on the place.   Was going for the beef short rib enchiladas until I saw the short rib tacos. Asked the waiter and he recommended the tacos so I went for it! They were the tastiest beef tacos I have ever had. The meat was plentiful and full of flavor. There was enough meat to make another taco. The two were plenty. I will not have another taco for awhile as I know I will be disappointed.   Had a few of the sweet potatoes chips and I must say they were also very tasty and not so hard like many of the others that I have had.  Will definitely be back and recommended to a friend who went and she was not disappointed either!"}
{"text":"I would recommend this place for lunch/brunch. First time I went I ordered the pear and gorgonzola flatbread. Very tasty, but a little too much cheese, making it very greasy. I felt weighed down after. My mom ordered the sweet potato tacos. I took a bite and it was great! Next time ordered the market sunflower salad. It was a wonderful salad! It was a great choice for lunch/brunch. The bowl they served it in was awkward to eat from (but I still managed anyways). Good place. Give it a whrilll if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place because I have heard great things about the food but it was not written in the stars for me. I came here with my boyfriend on Friday night 3/27 around 8pm, so well after the dinner rush of most restaurants. The hostess asked us where we wanted to sit and we did not care so she asked if outside was ok and took us to a small table that was cramped between two larger tables. It took about five minutes before someone came to our table and they only dropped off waters and told us that our server would be with us shortly. Another three minutes after that someone came over to see if we wanted anything besides water and that our server would be over shortly to take our order. Another couple of minutes after that our server finally came over.   We had waited there so long that we just wanted to place our order and decided to forgo appetizers and drinks because I had not eaten all day and all i wanted was food. I love potatoes so I ordered sweet potato tacos and a side of fingerling potatoes as well and my boyfriend ordered steak cooked rare. I did not get my side of potatoes and his steak came out closer to mid rare. The only positive thing was that our food came out quickly but that was more a factor of what we ordered and not their pace of service. The food was good but nothing was outstanding. When the waiter cleared our plates, I let him know that I never received my fingerling potatoes but I obviously did not want them after I finished my meal. He dropped us off a dessert menu and the only reason we ordered dessert was due to the fact that they had a butterscotch crack pie and I love butterscotch so my boyfriend felt I should have it. It was good but not worth $11 and nothing I wouldn't have been able to make myself.   My real problem here was feeling discriminated against because of our age and how we looked. I'm young and I know in DC Ranch I'm not exactly their target clientele. I had just gotten off work myself and wasn't expecting to go out to dinner so I wasn't dressed as nice as most people there but I still feel that's not a reason to discriminate. I also noticed our server had no other patio tables except us so it was obvious he was pulled from inside to serve us because the other servers did not want us as their table. Had we been greeted promptly, we would have ordered drinks and an appetizer and spent more money there. I would not ever go back and have told my friends and family not to go there."}
{"text":"This menu is really a great journey of cool dishes made to sound majoe league tasty.  Casandra, our waitress, was  awesomeness personified... as for her and hit the big tip button after.  Gound back soon to try out other enticements."}
{"text":"Nice place to relax, the Korean fried cauliflower and short ribs enchiladas are wonderful, the service is good too I can't wait to come back and try the Thai bbq baby back ribs husband say are delicious."}
{"text":"Epic sweet potato chips and great chocolate cake! The mango lemonade is also really good. The place is cute , little cramped but when you have line of people waiting I could imagine you'd try and fit in everyone you can. Servers are nice and helpful and the place is pretty cute."}
{"text":"Consistently good, great value for good and wine. Best of all innovative preparations. Music periodically, too! Highly recommend sunset on the deck. Inside comfortable, doesn't try TOO hard with trendy stuff!"}
{"text":"The Herb Box was a total disappointment. Our server was completely aloof and seemed irritated by our presence. The food was cold and expensive. We will not go back, especially considering how many great restaurants we have to choose from in central Phoenix."}
{"text":"Such a cute little restaurant.  Very feminine and cozy inside and there is an outdoor patio too.   I've been there on a few different occassions and the food has been fresh and delicious each time.  Love the sweet potato chips.  We went with a sleeping newborn for lunch one time, and were seated in the take-out/deli area which was not very cozy or comfortable.  I understand not every restaurant needs to be child friendly, but there were open seats in the main dining area, and we only had a quiet newborn in a small carseat.... that was a bit disappointing and it was a tight squeeze.  Of course being seated in that area, the service wasn't as good as the times we've eating in the main dining area or on the patio.  Good selection on the menu.  A bit pricey, but I understand the food is very fresh."}
{"text":"Our food was OK, but my wine (a California Pinot Noir) was undrinkable.  The server was uninterested in whether anyone at our table liked or disliked anything.  Any decent server would have noticed that my glass of wine was barely touched!"}
{"text":"Good food....BUT....the catering manager is rude and unprofessional.  I ran in after the gym to grab a catering menu as I was considering throwing a baby shower there.  HELL NO!  I guess since I was in gym clothes, no jewlery etc. she must have thought that I could not afford her ridiculously over priced quote...$2700 min for half of the patio for a SUNDAY?  Unless it's at 9am she will give me a better price?  hahaha...I thought I was on candid camera....good luck with that."}
{"text":"great service!  Matt the bartender works on Sundays and is a great guy.  We come to see him every weekend!  Love the food"}
{"text":"As a vegetarian I am always looking for good restaurants that can accommodate my dietary restrictions with style and the Herb Box did just that. They have a great patio that overlooks the canal and I will definitely keep this restaurant in my rotation."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch  with a small group the other day and sat outside.  The patio was spacious with heat lamps.  The service was prompt and the food tasted light and fresh.    The salad with filet mignon that I ordered was a decent portion for lunch.  Since it was meant to be mainly a salad, I shouldn't have been disappointed that the filet was on the smaller end of the spectrum.  The tenderness was exactly as I ordered - which earned another star.    The price is on the higher end for what you get, but the quality was good."}
{"text":"I've been to the Herbox many times in the past. On this visit I was disappointed in the menu.  The menu was blah not the same. The usual wait staff not present & friendly. This use to be one of my favorite places in Scottsdale not sure now. Hope things go back the old way."}
{"text":"Love this place. Good food, good drinks. Try pear and gorgonzola flat bread, butternut squash corn enchiladas, Thai BBQ baby back ribs, smoked gouda mac and cheese, apple slaw with jicama and watercress, cheese plate...dessert... Try the Sun Salutation cocktail (citrus, ginger, curry, lemon, cayenne sugar rim --divine). --Service is attentive. Pricey, but worth it."}
{"text":"THE HERB BOX Honestly, incredible food, beautifully decorated and great location!  And they had a big selection of gluten free items that were some of the best we've ever had- my daughter was a happy girl! The Kale Corn and Sweet Onion Pakora and Korean Fried Cauliflower was delicious! We also ordered the short rib tacos, chicken avocado salad and the chicken blt.  All amazing! Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"My Husband & I met some friends for lunch here while we were in town. The wait was about 20 mins, but we were seated on the patio, where there was live music and a beautiful view of Scottsdale & Camelback! I ordered the Market Sunflower salad; blackened chicken, goat chz, bacon, dried strawberry, blueberry, sunflower seeds  & my husband the Smoked Turkey Ciabatta; gouda, bacon,sweet tomato, roasted red pepper aioli. I LOVED my salad, but the hubs was a little less than totally satisfied with his sandwich, however the sweet potato chips were super yummy! I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"We visited this place on two occasions and besides the lovely outdoor seating, we were disappointed both times in the prices and sad portion sizes. When one is eating vegan or vegetarian, portion sizes need to be increased to meet caloric needs and overall hunger. We walked away spending $50 for just two of us, trying to find enough food to eat. We are not big eaters so we found it very odd and thought that perhaps this was a fluke at the first visit. However, it was the same problem at the second visit. Each time we visiited we had to ask the server to add more food to the dishes. We certainly do not need super-sized meals but considering how few calories are in a salad or a bowl meal, we were very surprised at how little food was provided. For instance, in the sweet potato bowl, there was all of about 1/4 of a sweet potato in the dish. We had to ask the server to bring more sweet potatoes. In the salad, we had to ask for more of, well, everything. We will not visit again unless the prices were cut."}
{"text":"my fiance and i just returned from the herb box and i had to immediately write my first review.  we aren't from scottsdale and have been trying places every night since we got here two days ago for a work conference and this was by far the best food we have had here in town.  i had the pork stuffed with cornbread and it was excellent.  all that and the price was excellent.  nothing on the menu is over $24 and most items are under $20.  our entire meal, including edamame appetizer was only $50.  great food + great price = great restaurant.  this place is new (april 2008), but everyone should check it out.  it is run by locals, so go out and support your local restaurants."}
{"text":"Love this place! Have been for my birthday and we had our wedding party dinner here. Only gave it 4 star because they got rid of my favorite thing on the menu, the cheese board. Bring it back!!!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like The Herb Box but the whole experience was honestly just not good. We went for brunch on Sunday and it wasn't too busy yet, the patio was pretty much full but no one was sitting inside. Between the three of us, we got cold brew coffees, the stuffed french toast, the bourbon french, and the market blt.  The food took a while to come out but we were seeing other people's food come out of the kitchen so we knew it wasn't just us. When we got the food, both of the french toasts were yummy (i fell like it's pretty hard to make sugar topped carbs taste bad), but the market blt left something to be desired. The pancetta was actually just bacon bits and the bread tasted really stale and was crumbling in my hand while trying to eat it. The side of fruit was some melon chunks that weren't juicy and were fairly hard. When we finished eating our waiter pretty much disappeared on us and after about 15+ minutes of trying to get his attention, we were finally able to flag him down to get the check (prior to the end of our meal he was great so it may have just gotten really busy?). Once we finally got the check we noticed that several of the items cost more on the receipt than what they said on the menu. We pointed this out to our waiter, but instead of getting a new receipt that had the correct food prices, he credited us the difference. Normally this would of been fine except for we were splitting the check which made things weird- it also made us wonder if they had changed the prices but hadn't updated the menu yet, or why they didn't have those food items in the receipt system. Although the lunch items sound good, there's too many other great eating places in the Scottsdale area for me to go back again."}
{"text":"Brunch at the patio on a sunny Saturday with live music? Yes, please!!! It has been long since my last not-so-good experience at the Herb Box in DC Ranch, I finally decided to give it another chance at this location, well, I'm glad I did. This one definitely gave me a much better experience and a happier day later (maybe because I didn't order any egg-related items like last time? check out the review for the DC ranch location and you'll know what I'm talking about, lol)...  Anyways, we had to wait for about 25 mins for a patio seating which was expected since everyone wants to be out with the sun. Service at this location was great, very attentive, the waitress of ours was just friendly! We both had a salad (Market Sunflower Salad and Coconut Shrimp Salad), both were very flavorful, I'd definitely order it again! :) Looking forward to the next outing at this place!"}
{"text":"So I finally decided to give the Herb Box another try, ever since that 'egg incident' more than 2 years ago? And yes, this time my experience was much better, and this 2nd try was definitely worth it.  It was Sunday again, and Easter Sunday, we came around 2pm expecting to have a long line because of reservations and holiday and we were right, however, we took the bar seats when they came available after about 5 mins of waiting. Our server Gary was excellent! He gave us a few recommendations on the food and drinks, and this time, food arrived just about on time, and of course, they have enough eggs! Food was tasty (blackened chicken salad and breakfast burrito), and most importantly, the Chocolate Bread Pudding with Salted Caramel Ice Cream was soooo good! Thanks Gary for the suggestion. The sweet pudding with chucks of chocolate inside was perfectly balanced with the salted caramel ice cream, hmmm, i wanna go back for some more!  I'm glad I had returned to this place and would always look forward for some more!"}
{"text":"Loved this place! The buckwheat pancakes (add the orange honey- I think that's what it was- chicken) were delicious. Live music when we went, Sydney Sprague (beautiful voice). Service was great, too!  I already wish they had The Herb Box where I live, but I kind of like that I'll have to go back to Scottsdale to get my fix!"}
{"text":"Last friday I ordered the \"thai ribs with the smoked gouda mac n cheese.\" Ahhh-mazing!!!! Food is done to perfection here! Excellent service every time, which I find incredible for how busy they get. Our nice waitress Kristy knew how to get my order just right, being attentive to us the whole visit is why I give this place 5 stars. I hope she's working next time I go! There was a cute ambiance in the evening during sunset, I recommend eating on the patio.  I will definitely be coming back for more!"}
{"text":"This place is incredibly slow, I think everyone is high. The manager has no idea what is going on and I'm embarrassed for them. The  food was decent, but nothing to write home about or tell our friends."}
{"text":"If you want great atmosphere, friendly people, and delicious FRESH food. GO HERE. Seriously. Everything I've tried is delicious. One of my favorites is the chicken-arugula wrap with cherries in it. The crowd ranges from young mothers with their babies to older couples who live in the area. Definitely a great choice when in the DC Ranch area, and if you're further south by Scottsdale and Shea, the other location is just as good, but smaller."}
{"text":"I made a reservation for Mothers day brunch and we happened to be the first ones in the restaurant. That being said, it took 45 minutes for our food to come out..we were the first ones there! When the food came out my husbands was a completely wrong order. My daughter got the red velvet pancakes. When I tried to cut them for her I noticed they were very tough, and when I flipped them over they were burnt on the back. When we could flag down a waiter (5 minutes later) we had to send my husbands and my daughters food back. I got the smoked salmon hash. It was the most dissapointing brunch dish I have ever had. It was essentially dry potatoes mixed with dry smoked salmon. Salmon is my favorite food, so it was especially upsetting. My husband finally got his short rib sandwich, we he admitted was horribly dry. I couldn't even finish my food. I should have known better when it was the only restaurant with reservations open for Mother's day when all other restaurants were booked. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"The staff is not concerned with customer service! We book last month for Easter brunch even with an open table reservation number they lost our reservation. As it was some time ago when I booked I called a few days before and confirmed our reservation.  They had a number of empty tables and would not seat us and our two small children. They did not try to acomidate or say sorry. After waiting for 20 min we walked down to the breakfast joint and had a good breakfast. I understand things happen but the attitude of the staff was awful, even asking if we could come back in 3 hr.  We will not be back and if you are counting on your reservation do not."}
{"text":"The Herb Box is a really great place to grab a quick lunch.  It's a little pricey, but the food is very good.  My favorite is the Crispy Chicken BLT - it's awesome!"}
{"text":"Sat at the bar for five minutes while three staff members behind me were hanging out and laughing. I had to ask if there was anyone working. They responded that there was no bartender on at this time but they would grab a server. Horrible service. Then I overheard servers talking about bad tips and how slow it's been for dinner. Maybe if you gave better service you'd be getting more customers and better tips. I have been in the industry for fifteen years and standing around laughing instead of greeting a customer is inexcusable. Five minutes no joke."}
{"text":"I can't wait to come here again!  Perfect place for a weekend brunch.  I had a mango mimosa (a little too sweet, but still good) and the honey buckwheat pancakes.  These were perfect!  And the bacon it came with was delish as well.  All of their other dishes sounded amazing too, so I will be back to try more soon!  The only downside was the server.  He was a bit rude but maybe it was just a rough day for him."}
{"text":"I was pretty disappointed with this place! Maybe its because I had high expectations after everything I've heard. The menu was pretty weak and I was surprised at the lack of variety. I ordered a flatbread pizza and it was good but pretty pricey! I'd probably go back but I'm not in a rush,  hopefully next time it's a better experience."}
{"text":"Stopped in on Sunday morning after just moving to the area. Had the eggs and bacon and shared the red velvet pancakes. Everything was amazing. The pancakes are to die for. It was quiet and relaxing. We enjoyed the service and the food and will definitely be going back soon!"}
{"text":"Way overpriced. I had the blackened prawns ($22). It was four pieces of shrimp (not large at all, on the small side).  The sides were a tiny bit of corn and some bread.  They do have a nice patio, but the food is not worth the price."}
{"text":"Beautiful patio dining when the weather is at its best. Chose Herb Box as my bday happy hour and had a delightful evening. Three drinks and many bites later, we strolled the nearby craft fest and Thursday Art Walk.  The HH drinks were great, the food and service was good. I go back for the bread pudding and the location."}
{"text":"My wife and I took another couple here for Easter brunch. I am vegan, my wife is mostly vegetarian and the other couple consumes the standard American diet so we thought there would be something for everyone at The Herb Box. The dining room was somewhat noisy, not because the place was busy - it was nearly empty, but because there were employees screaming at each other in the kitchen.  This restaurant could have used some customer focused management to keep the staff in line but no matter, we won't go back. It's not a place for those following a plant-based diet because of limited choices. I had Vegetarian Sweet Potato Tacos that they simply left the cheese off of to make it vegan. That seemed to be about as far as they were willing to go to accommodate me and even at that it took two attempts because the first plate of tacos came out with meat on them. When the correct dish arrived it consisted of two small soft tacos and about 1 tablespoon of a black bean/mango salsa side. The dish was acceptable, but reminiscent of the sort of stuff that I throw together at home when I haven't planned ahead. I guess the experience seemed corporate to me. It's as if the menu was planned and executed by an accountant rather than a chef with any degree of passion. Assuming the Easter tantrum in the kitchen was an unusual event it might be worth a visit for those seeking a standard American breakfast. But you better go soon, I doubt it will be around long because there are too many good options in north Scottsdale."}
{"text":"We were visiting Scottsdale and asked our concierge where we could find a good healthy vegetarian restaurant.. He recommended the Herb Box. I'm telling you, it was the best vegetarian restaurant we have ever been to. The menu is incredible. We went there for lunch everyday day we were in Scottsdale. We want one in Indian Wells, Ca!!!"}
{"text":"WILL NEVER BE BACK and I don't suggest this place to ANYONE!!  There are so many places in Scottsdale that serve fresh \"farm to table\" food and I would suggest going there.  If you want to get attitudes, SLOW & HORRIBLE service all with a slice of \"could care-less\" waitress personalities, you've come to the right place!! When entering a restaurant, you expect to be greeted by the hostess instead of waiting for 4-5 minutes for her to get off the phone. We were left standing awkwardly right in the front where the door entrance is as the restaurant space itself is rather tight with wall to wall tables. RIDICULOUS and absolutely inexcusable. A fireable offense in my opinion but no one working there including the bartender who eyed us at least 10 times, never thought to signal someone to help us. Once we were seated we were told that they were no longer serving breakfast even though they are supposed to serve it until 11am and it was now 11:02am they absolutely would NOT make an exception.  When my husband gently asked the server if she could check with the manager and take into account that we had come especially for breakfast and were kept waiting, she complied. Then came back and said, \"Sorry, but the kitchen has switched over to the lunch menu\" and with that statement, TOLD us to look over the lunch menu and she would be back to take our order. I was SHOCKED!! We should have just left then as the service went downhill from there. Although I don't have any complaints about the food ~ it was good, BUT VERY PRICEY!! ~ but I cannot emphasize enough the POOR & SLOW SERVICE all with attitude... I WILL NEVER BE BACK and Susan & Chef Becky should be ashamed of themselves to allow these kind of servers to represent their establishment and to foster these SNOTTY, care-less ATTITUDES in their restaurant. Just remember... MANY good restaurants have been brought to their knees by the employee help (or lack of), I don't care how good the food!!"}
{"text":"Don't know if the food is good here. You can't get waited on and the staff doesn't even acknowledge you. Bad management. Won't go there."}
{"text":"Great place! Great food consistently. Dog friendly and very welcoming.  The staff is so kind to us and our furry friend.  We really appreciate the good service and great patio!"}
{"text":"The Herb Box is good.  For brunch, the Salmon Hash is an awesome combination of wonderful breakfast foods. I especially liked that it had the fingerling potatoes mixed in. But really, you can put potatoes in anything and I'll like it.  Today, I had lunch at The Herb Box, and was pleasantly surprised with their fish taco special. Seriously, I didn't expect tacos this good at a place with such varied food styles as The Herb Box.   What keeps me from giving The Herb Box that final star are the prices and service. The food is good, but just a few bucks more than what I usually want to spend. The service isn't awful, but it has that slightly snobbish Scottsdale vibe. Little things like that make me want to stay in Central Phoenix and out of downtown Scottsdale."}
{"text":"My friends and I went here after searching several restaurants in the area. What a great choice! If you want creative food that you have NEVER had anywhere else and probably can't cook at home AND is absolutely fabulous - go here. The Korean cauliflower is to die for, but so was everything else we had. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"new location place is very nice..good mix in the menu..food and service were very good. they have a huge outside patio area should be great when it gets a bit warmer."}
{"text":"A busy Labor Day so I'm partial to that today. With that said, we waited the standard 30 minutes to sit down. What really sucked is we waited 45 minutes to get our meals and to me this is unacceptable at this place. It's not like we ordered a steak, deep dish pizza or a soufflé. Any way the food was great and the chef bought us dessert. Happy.  Clean place with good ambience."}
{"text":"Food was unreal! Menu doesn't do it justice since at first glance it's hard to image the flavers going on. Had the Korean Cauliflower and Thai BBQ Ribs. Both we're amazing! Great atmosphere as well, especially on a Thursday/Sunday night since they have live tunes outside on the bridge. Server and Bartender were great as well!"}
{"text":"The Herb Box did not close....they just moved.  Two locations - DC Ranch and near Camelback & Scottsdale Rd."}
{"text":"This is my go-to restaurant for taking friends and clients who are tired of the ho-hum cafe. I love the atmosphere and the food is amazing. Everything is fresh and flavorful and the salads are enormous!"}
{"text":"A very disappointing experience! We had dinner here 3 years ago and it was a little gem; however that was then, this is now. We had dinner a few weeks ago and while my husband's dinner was good, mine was awful. The buttermilk chicken was dry and tasteless. We went back a week or so later for happy hour drinks only because we like the space. We were made to feel totally unwelcome. The patio was empty but they ushered us to a remote table because they were GOING to be very busy. We were given no menu and ignored to the point of getting ready to leave. We didn't realize it wasn't happy hour because it was Saturday...no problem. A woman, I am assuming a GM, came by and asked about our experience. I hesitated at first then said actually it hadn't been a great one. Her response, \"0h, I'm sorry. I hope the rest of your evening is better.\" REALLY, why ask? Throw us a bone...one free drink, happy hour price, certificate toward one meal? Nothing! We will not be returning."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast on a Saturday - loved the atmosphere out on the terrace.  Enjoyed a more healthy version of breakfast - my feta omelet was excellent.  Food came out very quickly and service was good, although our iced tea did run dry once, otherwise they would have gotten 5 stars!  We will go back for dinner to try that now and will also go for breakfast/lunch as well.   Will also take friends here when they are visiting and only do that with places we love."}
{"text":"Where are you going to Scarborough Fair? Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme ... You don't have to wander that far. Chances are The Herb Box is nearby with your PSR&T and so much more. Since 1995, owner Susan Smederovac-Wilcox (a native Phoenician) focused her natural talent and gracious skill for entertaining along with a generous helping of creativity and ability to offer something new and different to the Valley.   The Herb Box sparked the palates of foodies all over presenting a menu with samplings of innovative world cuisine with seasonal ingredients that unify regional flavors. A big favorite on the Scottsdale Waterfront and in DC Ranch, it caused quite a commotion when it was announced that they were opening a location in uptown Phoenix in newly opened enclave, The Colony along \"Restaurant Row\" on 7th Street with the boulevard's renaissance started a few years ago when Sam Fox revived a derelict building dubbing it \"The Yard.\" The new digs are bright and airy with a patio facing the street.  There's a global playground of flavors at The Herb Box. We started with their shared plates and a quick trip to Orient with Korean Fire Cauliflower with chunks of the cruciferous, crispy cauliflower, a hefty spoonful of quinoa, Korean hot pepper sauce, sesame, sugar snap peas and pea shoots. Spicy and sweet, but we would've like a little more of the promised \"fire.\" Still, you'll want more. $13  You'll adore the Kale, Corn and Sweet Onion Pakora (that's a \"fried snack\" originating in India.) The ruffled, dark green leaves of Kale are generously draped in a light batter and dressed with a sweet-hot Serrano glaze with vegan yellow pepper aioli. Turmeric gives it a brilliant golden hue. We adore it. $12.   We can't wait to try their Pear and Gorgonzola Flatbread, Crisp Brussels Sprouts Chips among other Shared Plate offerings from $7 to $18.  Dinner is casual and inviting at The Herb Box. Currently, ten entrees are available. The Grilled Trout with Corn & Leek Gratin felt like a natural choice for summer fare for $18. The boneless, delicate fillet was moist, tender and flaky and so fresh it must've jumped out of the stream and on the grill. It was accompanied by a ramekin of watercress butter, pickled baby lima beans, beets an bressels sprouts. The cast iron tray of hot Corn & Leek Gratin was sensational, and worth ordering as a side for $8.  Another fishy fave is the Grapefruit & Sugar Charred Salmon graced with sugar snap peas, fennel, blackberries, pistachio, orange charred onion, black quinoa and snow pea shoots for $18. The grapefruit and sugar charring was almost too nuanced to notice, but that didn't affect the bright, firm salmon.   Beef eaters won't go wrong with the Wine Braised Short Ribs. This hot hunk of meat ancho-bourbon demi-glaze, horseradish creamed Savoy cabbage and char-roasted baby cabbage for $24. The fork-tender beef is thick and juicy. Think of the most perfect pot roast you ever had. This is better.   If you're extra-hungry, think about the Serrano-Avocado Shrimp Salad with crispy shrimp, organic arugula, fried fennel pancetta with a sweet-hot serrano glaze and lemon-honey vinaigrette is $15. Big on flavor, still light and refreshing. A side like the warm Green Bean Fingerling Potato Salad with cherry tomatoes and a few bleu cheese crumbles adds the perfect crunch and pizazz.  Save room for dessert! The lemony zip of their creamy Crème Brûlée finish.   The Herb Box also offers a light breakfast and a casual weekend brunch that's bound to be a hit. SCOOP: the Bourbon-Ginger Peach Brioche French Toast with Bacon ($16) is your new best friend. You're welcome.   Finish the day with Happy Hour at The Herb Box. Their tasty appetizer/shared pates are only $5 each and select cocktails are half-off.   So why go to Scarborough Fair when there's a brand, new Herb Box near you?"}
{"text":"Beat the 1.5 hour wait at Olive and Ivy. Butternut squash and corn enchiladas and short rib enchiladas were good. No complaints."}
{"text":"So goo! We're only here for the weekend, and thank goodness for me because I would probably eat here everyday. The inside is beautiful, the staff is friendly, the food amazing!"}
{"text":"The brunch here is so tasty it should be ILLEGAL. Came here to celebrate with friends and got introduced to the kale corn dip... With CHICKPEA paste, not dairy. So ridiculously good! Plantain chips were perfect complement.  Also ordered the fried cauliflower which had some kind of delicious buffalo style sorcery going on... Snap pea garnish was so fresh and crisp, I'm sure it came from the Garden of Eden.  The French toast was scary good. Brought it home and my mangy family ate my leftovers before I could. Jerks.  Five dollar mimosas. Variety of flavors. 'Nuff said.  Finally, the service was STELLAR. Not over the top, just really kind and patient with my indecisiveness. We hung around way after closing, just gabbing away and catching up with each other, and no one ever came to kick us out. It looked like a few regulars were enjoying the bar, too, in all fairness.  What a sweet little spot this is. Such an inventive menu, such incredible flavor. Do it."}
{"text":"This spot is great, good food, great surroundings.....  Cool to chill with friend on the patio!!!  Our server was Eric....   Request this brotha! Excellent server.....  Check this place out!"}
{"text":"The drinks are great and the food is delicious!!! The chicken blt is amazing!! I am definitely coming back ;)"}
{"text":"The Herb Box recently opened in Scottsdale...yeah. I have eaten here 4 times in the last two weeks. The best and freshest ingredients served in a wonderful waterside setting. It just doesn't get better. A real new favorite of mine. I was waited on by Chaunce yesterday at lunch and he is the most delightful person and only made the experience better. He is witty and truly passionate about the place. Thank you Herb Box."}
{"text":"I had a meeting close and so I decided to stop in and try their market cafe.  I asked if they had quiche or anything that didn't have bread and he said that they were so busy yesterday and usually their product lasts a few days so they don't prep everyday so they were pretty much out of everything. The only breakfast item they had was the breakfast panini and it couldn't be modified because it was already made.  I completely understand the idea of having things pre made so that it's a quick process which is their concept here.  What I am not understanding is pre making everything and keeping it for days and if you are out on a Sunday wouldn't you prep Monday morning?  I got a breakfast panini and a bowl of soup it was ok.  Nothing to great.  The only great thing about this place is the location and the patio.  Service and food need some serious revamping."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch and wasnt that impressed. The food is really nothing to write home about for the price they charge. I ordered the crab dip with plantains appetizer and had a chicken avocado salad as my entree. The crab dip was really salty and had hardly any crab in it. The salad was very bland and I wouldn't order it again. I will go back to try there squash enchiladas as I love those and Hardly ever find them when I go out to eat. Also I am gluten free and its hard to find menus that accommodate to my food allergies. I will give this place one more shot on the food, the service is great had a great server and food was delivered fast. If the foods not a hit the second time around I will throw in the towel."}
{"text":"Went for brunch on Sunday with 5 people.   WOW!.  The butternut squash corn enchiladas with tomatillo sauce was one of the best Mexican dishes I have ever had... and I live in Mexico for most of the year!  This dish is also available for dinner and would be plenty of food (three enchildas plus a substantial salad.) Everyone else at our table ordered chilaquiles with pulled pork and all of them said their dishes were wonderful too.   Service was great... waiters often came by for coffee refills.    Street parking only.  I can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Let me address this first: Where the heck are all the herbs?! I don't know - but the food is still great.  We came here for brunch, and the atmosphere is perfect for a lazy morning in Scottsdale. The seating is large and comfortable, and there is ample outdoor seating. Even if you're indoors, it seems they like to open the place up, and the sounds of shoppers and birds outside really add to the experience. The prices are very reasonable considering the quality of the food, which is excellent, and they come up with some fairly unique offerings for brunch, but also offer traditional options if you're just in the mood for eggs and bacon.  Regardless, if you're in town visiting, want to take the family out for a meal, are having a lazy day, or want to take your special lady somewhere classy and fun, this fits the bill for everything."}
{"text":"Can you say WAY overrated? They must pay for their reviews because I've had better meals at a hospital cafeteria. We had their $14 chopped chicken-avocado salad. Supposedly there was avocado, bacon, onions, and tomatoes but I guess they just waved those over the salads because they were virtually non-existent in the two salads for which we paid over $30. And it never ceases to amaze me how a \"professional\" cook/chef(?) can turn a perfectly good chicken breast into an inedible, dry piece of shoe leather and call it \"blackened\". Why not just call it inedible. Stay away from this overrated, over priced, unskilled, pretentious place at all costs. Unless you like throwing money away on really bad food."}
{"text":"Stopped here for breakfast on a Sunday morning ... had the red velvet pancakes and they were quite amazing.  Highly recommended.  My wife had an omelet which she described as \"pretty good\".  Great service, nice ambiance, clean, well lit."}
{"text":"Hands down this is my favorite place to go have a salad. Words cant exoress how much this restaurant means to me. The one at this location has an excellent wine selection. THE perfect place to wear your sunday best (old fashioned dress, white gloves, and a big white hat) and enjoy a consistently excellent meal in a beautiful atmosphere. Although dressing up isn't mandatory. It does not matter what you order it will be amazing. They have different foods on a more gourmet level without being straight up weird or over priced. Everything is delicious and healthy. Best of all the get their meats and vegetables from local farmers and it shows in the taste. The service is always outstanding. I have nothing bad to say about this place as I have never had a bad experience. They're like the Nordstrom of the restaurant business They have a customer for life."}
{"text":"I went to the herb box for a late lunch with some friends. I'm not sure if i was more impressed with the atmosphere, the food, or the service. We sat on the patio in the mid 70's weather and it couldn't have been more comfortable.   Our waiter,  Drew, was extremely friendly and quick to offer suggestions on dining choices. He always ensured my iced tea was topped off (about 7 times throughout the meal!), and all food service was prompt and courteous.    I ordered the trout which might have been the best restaurant served trout I've had. It came with a medley of pickled vegetables and a corn and leak groutin that was excellent.  My friends ordered chicken blt, pork ribs,  and flatbread all of which were very tasty as well. However,  in my opinion,  the trout was the best of the 4.   Finally,  we finished with a chocolate chili bread pudding that put the whole experience over the top. I will be returning, and I would recommend it to anyone.  I'm looking forward to trying the brunch menu that was recommended to our group by one of the managers: Mandy."}
{"text":"There's only a handful in Phoenix that I crave.  The Herb Box is one of them.  Every time I go, I strive to try new item to taste test.  NEVER disappointed.  Trout, Short Ribs, Thai Ribs, Smoked Gouda Mac, The Beets!  I mean this place makes you crave the sides.  The sides?  Not to mention an amazing wine list.  The service is always personal and engaging.  Looking forward to their new PV location!  Now if they will just come downtown!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Well the food and vibe were great.  Service not so much.  I went here with some girlfriends for lunch during the week.  They have many great, fresh items on the menu.  My friend and I decided to split the Sunflower Salad and the Butternut Squash Corn Enchiladas.  Both dishes were divine!  Our server was very slow and we had to ask for our drinks to be refilled.  They also seemed to be promoting special happy hour items which sounded really good.    Despite the bad service, I will definitely be back.  The food is too good to pass up!"}
{"text":"I went to the Herb Box for the first time on 12/2 with a group of ladies for brunch. I had the chilaquiles and it was delicious. They also had bottomless mimosas with the option of mango or orange juice. I got mango and it was yummy. Our waitress was very pleasant. She split our check ( we were a party of 14) without a hassle. I would highly recommend The Herb Box."}
{"text":"Glad I stopped in today for lunch. Herb Box has been on my bucket list forever and I've read nothing but good things about the red velvet pancakes here. Wasn't going to stop in since it was lunch time but decided to see what else they have to offer.   I sat at the bar and had very good, prompt service. I asked the bartender to order me his favorite lunch menu item so I got the brown sugar pulled pork ciabatta. Great choice! Very great presentation, big portion, and had a very unique blend of ingredients. I like a chef that can think outside the box and bring nontraditional items together in a subtle way. Sweet potato chips were some of the best chips I've had. Great bargain and value for $12....I will be definitely be back to experiment with the rest of their menu!"}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh, unique food offerings. Cool vibe and atmosphere. We ordered the plantain chips with cilantro crab dip for starters - refreshing, and the plantain chips were a nice change-up from regular crackers for dip. I ordered the butternut squash corn enchiladas - pretty spicy, but so flavorful. He ordered the coffee crusted pork chop - also very spicy and tasty. We shared the peach bread pudding with honey greek frozen yogurt. What a fun dessert! Tangy yogurt balanced beautifully with the sweet and caramelized warm bread pudding. Will definitely go again!"}
{"text":"Herb Box is a cool place to hang out on their deck. We had sauvignon blanc, before heading to San Diego. It's cute inside, but the real fun is eating outside."}
{"text":"We had a great first visit here for brunch.  They have a creative brunch menu with traditional breakfast items with a twist, lunch items, and great-sounding desserts.  Our party had the sunflower salad, bacon and eggs, steak and eggs, the hummus platter, and the sweet potato chips.  Everything was quite good and very fresh.  We really enjoyed the sweet potato chips - not greasy at all, just sweet potato flavor with a hint of seasoning.  We'll be back to try some of the other menu items.    Great atmosphere and pretty small dining room which makes it quaint and cozy.  Unfortunately we had the table right next to the kitchen doors which was the only unpleasant part.  Bussers and waiters would come flying out of the kitchen and then stand inches away from me with load trays of food trying to figure out what table they were going to.  The water refiller seemed especially hungover as he literally stood next to my arm for 3 minutes trying to figure out who needed water.  They should put a divider between that table and the kitchen.  Also bar service was slow - 15 minute wait for 2 mimosas.  Waiter apologized but still...  overall a good experience.  Big fan of the atmosphere and menu.  Can step up the service a bit."}
{"text":"Very good food.  Was at a party that they catered and it was absolutely wonderful.  Great desserts, too."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, especially outside patio.  Strange to see some people dressed gym casual on a Friday night, as well as some kids.  They poured Chimay into a pilsner glass, so bad marks for that.  Falaffel appetizer was nice, but Falaffel itself was too finely ground and flavorless.  Salads were really outstanding.  Enchiladas, also, were very good.  Thai short ribs were pretty good as well.  Great dessert options.  Overall pricey, but fair."}
{"text":"To the point, I'm gonna say food was great! The service on the other hand was not. In todays \"foodie\" world, it's a package I look for, that's why I bother reading and writing reviews. Unless a restaurant is full, there is no reason to have to wait for a service. Sunday lunch should have been packed for a small restaurant, it wasnt so...the price I paid for my brunch should have come with better service."}
{"text":"The Herb Box is a restaurant in DC Ranch (they also have a location in Old Town).  Their menu says they use local and organic when possible.  They also have a lot of gluten-free and vegetarian options if that is what you are looking for.  They have a great patio and an acoustic guitar player on weekends around 6-9.  It is a nice view of the sunset in the evening.  They have a good happy hour on Mon-Sat.  We ordered the Kobe Sliders with sweet potato chips ($8) and Gouda Mac & Cheese, and wine ($3 off during happy hour).  We also had the bread pudding with ice cream dessert.  Delicious!  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Raves all around - LOVE the decor and ambiance - who designed this place?  It's perfect!   Had breakfast - AWESOME Cinnamon Buckwheat Pancakes served with the best bacon!  My partner had a Strawberry Lasi and I had a mango lemonade - both delicious!  Our server was Sadie - a true delight - ask for her!  We can't wait to go back for lunch and dinner and of course breakfast again!!!"}
{"text":"I have only visited the DC Ranch location of this place, but, needless to say, i love it. From the excellent coffee to the creative food to the delicious bakery to the cute decor, I love it all. The food is new american with an emphasis on fresh ingredients and local foodstuffs. Lunch and brunch are the main meals, and everything I have tried has been wonderful. My husband loves the rosemary steak sandwich and I love the corn and goat cheese flat bread. We both enjoy the sweet potato chips with curry and the chicken chili. And, no herb box trip is complete w/o a trip to the bakery, where the raspberry crumble bars are outstanding. The caramel apple bars are also wonderful and hit just the right tart-salty-sweet note."}
{"text":"The pastry chef for the North Scottsdale location is a rock star. Plain and simple. I love the desserts here not to mention the upscale, quaint vibe and sweet potato tacos. YUM. The protein bars in the bakery are also excellent if you are an athlete looking for a great, homemade bar. They have some good gluten free options that are also available. Great iced tea, too. Yippie! The servers are also friendly. Hoping for a more kid friendly dinner menu in the future... but, I can't have it all, I know."}
{"text":"I am writing this review based on my recent experiences in the new Herb Box location in DC Ranch.  I've been to the original location, too, but have been to the one on Market Street much more.  This place is so stylish and swanky that you just enjoy being there and looking around.  The menu is varied and interesting so you can go many times and have totally different culinary experiences each time.  I love this because it is right in my neighborhood and it is a much needed place to meet friends for lunch.    Fortunately there are lots of other businesses and offices nearby so you can also get some free wifi while you eat if you have your laptop with you.  A few cautions, though...  1.  While everyone who works there is friendly and upbeat, very few of the servers actually know what they're doing.  You WILL have to remind them to fill your glass, take away your dirty plate and occasionally to bring you the food you ordered.    2.  No one who works behind the market counter knows how to work the register...but they're commentary as they try to figure it out is entertaining.  3..The gift-y items in the market are adorable and disgustingly overpriced.    Even though I've been a little caustic about the things I don't like, I will say that they really have it nailed in terms of serving up a delicious meal whether you're looking for breakfast, lunch, dinner or a snack.  Their ingredients are fresh, the portions are good and the creativity of the recipes is delightful.  One last little thing, though...cilantro is spelled wrong on the lunch menu (it is correct on the dinner one, though).  Sorry, but spelling DOES count."}
{"text":"The food, the service and the ambiance at this place are all just perfect. We just had a family reunion dinner here and everyone loved their food selections and our server! Don't leave the kale pakora off the list of side dishes--it's delicious!"}
{"text":"We love the herb box. It is the best so far in Arizona. The only thing we don't like is the service but we don't care because we love the food. The cauliflower is amazing, the pizza love do die,we love everything."}
{"text":"Our food was excellent! Our server on the other hand...... well, he was just plain uninterested. He was friendly and charming but he forgot about us several times. I'm sure our food was ready but other tables who arrived later than we did received their food first.  Like I said, food was excellent, atmosphere great and as long as you don't get our server, you will have a smooth dinner/lunch.  I would come back again."}
{"text":"We had dinner there last night April 14, 2011..Martinis were priced at $13.00 which is more than other restaurants in the area. The martini had too much lemon juice so had to be returned..second martini ok. The salmon was terrible due to their pouring maple syrup over the entire plate or something equally sweet.  My friend had the trout and thought it mediocre ... Service was slow - at least 1/ hour to get drinks and restaurant was 1/2 full.  I guess I'd rather go to Cowboy Ciao's across the street ."}
{"text":"I was here for lunch and I tried the gipsy soup. It was really good: hot, creamy, tastefull. My hubby ate Ahi tuna salad which was very nice presented and very good and my friend choose a salmon sandwich with sweet potatoes which was very good as well ( the bread especially was really good). I love the atmosphere, their decorations ( the lady bathroom is so glam ) and the location. I definitely will come back."}
{"text":"I always wanted to try Herb Box and went in today on business to talk to the manager. The hostess was very rude however, and would not put me into contact with the manager nor did she offer me a table. Because of my negative experience with the rude staff, I will not be trying Herb Box."}
{"text":"Terrible service, average food, overpriced, understaffed and mismanaged... gave them many chances due to the location , but never coming back! Save yourself a trip..."}
{"text":"A friend and I had lunch at The Herb Box today after checking out the reviews on Yelp.  The restaurant is charming and located in the beautiful DC Ranch area.   We sat on the patio which was nicely cooled with misters. Our service was very good.  It was a Sunday afternoon and there was a good crowd but we were greeted and served promptly. Our waitress checked on us regularly and we always had our tea and water glasses filled (which I think is always a sign of good service).  I had the Coconut Shrimp Salad and my friend had the Butternut Squash Enchiladas. We both enjoyed our meals. My salad had a lot of flavor and was very fresh. The presentation of the food was beautiful, too.  The menu is diverse but a little pricier than a typical lunch. However, the food and atmosphere was worth it.   Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I was really, really looking forward to Sunday brunch at the Herb Box, as I have heard rave reviews! I have also walked past it many times on the waterfront, and have enjoyed the live music I've heard, as well the chic look of the place. I'm a definite foodie, and the menu looked great, so I was stoked to try it!  Well, I'm not sure if the restaurant was having an \"off\" day or what, but our experience at the Herb Box today was terrible, from beginning to end. :-(  Maybe it's all part of some restaurant \"rudeness\" kitsch that I am unaware of, but I really hate to say that the service was pretty awful--the hostesses were snobby and unfriendly, and the wait staff was very inattentive. I accidentally spilled a glass of ice water on my lap as our server handed it to me, and he just left the table without a word, and without offering or bringing back any napkins. Lucky for us it was 90 degrees out and it all dried fast! :-)   And then the food. Ugh. Really disappointing, especially for the price. I ordered a strawberry lassie to drink with a Market BLT, based on Yelp recommendations.  The lassie was literally curdled and undrinkable, and the BLT had absolutely no bacon/pancetta on it. My husband ordered the Smoked Salmon Hash, which promised an impressive array of fresh ingredients and flavors, but in actuality looked and tasted like canned fish mixed with fried potato chunks. Awful, awful.  I don't like to complain about food while sitting at a table, and I never send anything back. In this case, I really wish I had been able to, but we only saw our server twice--once when he took our order and again when he brought the check. He did not deliver our food and no one ever refilled our drinks. At that point, we just wanted to get out of there, so after 90 minutes of being basically ignored by the wait staff, we left with empty stomachs, out $50.00. Total waste, will probably never return. Bummer! :-("}
{"text":"Nice location and restaurant, however it's overpriced. The chargrilled tenderloin was not tender, slightly tough and chewy. Only 4 sm pieces in the entree priced at 25.00 The waitress was not familiar with menu or ingredients. When we asked about the boston cream that was supposedly in the dossants (dessert), she admitted there wasn't any even though the menu listed it. That would have been nice to know before ordering. The other dessert Crack Pie, was cold and seemed to be thawing out. Not what I was expecting, I inquired about it and the server took it back to the kitchen where I'm certain it was warmed in the microwave.  Oh yeah, the plastic green plant on the tabletops were not overly impressive either."}
{"text":"We had an outstanding experience last evening with the Herb Box Catering!  The catering manager, Kelli Burton,  is efficient, professional and knows her business.  She presented us with a delightlful and creative menu from appetizers, salad, entrees and dessert.  Kelli was the first to arrive the night of our event and she was the last to pull out of the driveway.  She and her crew are amazing.  Everyone raved about the quality and presentation of food served.  I am still receiving e-mails thanking us for a wonderful evening.  Our party was a sit down, outside gathering for 48.  The Herb Box handled it with ease and perfection.  I would recommend the Herb Box, 100%."}
{"text":"I would give 0 stars if I could. We walked in and there was no hostess at the stand so we figured we would seat ourselves. We waited for 20 minutes and no one could even grace us with a \"hello\". We ended up leaving due to the lack of service. Don't waste your time with this place, they obviously care very little about their customers."}
{"text":"Amazing food, service, and music.  The red velvet pancakes are a must try.  Our waiter was helpful with picking out foods to try.  There were lots of vegetarian options as well."}
{"text":"We've been waiting for the shops in The Colony to open up; so glad this place is now open! We were actually on our way to eat somewhere else when my fiancé mentioned The Herb Box was now open so we made a split decision and decided to try it out. It was lunch time and the weather was perfect so we sat outside. Indoors, it's still pretty open and very nice. The service was wonderful! Everyone was really friendly. I've been obsessed with roasted cauliflower lately so I had to order their Korean fried cauliflower appetizer. The dish itself was small pieces of cauliflower sitting on quinoa but the korean hot pepper sauce was so flavorful! I loved it!  For the entree I ordered the blackened salmon blt. Again, another great dish! I did think that the spices on the salmon made it a little \"salty\" for my liking but it was still a great tasting blt. I didn't realize my dish came with sweet potato chips (as did my fiancée's) and I wish I would've asked if we could substitute that side since neither one of us likes sweet potato anything. As a heads up, if you don't like sweet potatoes, ask if you can substitute them. Next time, I'll be sure to ask! I didn't order off their dessert menu; however they have a mini bakery so I decide to try the blackberry empanada and I loved it! I was a bit skeptical at first since I normally don't care much for blackberries but it looked too good not to try; it turned out great! Overall, this is a great new spot! Perfect for lunch, great service, and good food!"}
{"text":"We had a family brunch here and had a fantastic meal. Everyone loved their choices and the restaurant is nice large and airy with indoor and outdoor tables. It was our favorite restaurant in Old Town during our stay."}
{"text":"The food was so good... The crisp falafel bites with greek salsa and tahini sauce were yummy. Also, the butternut squash corn enchiladas with tomatillo verde fiesta salad with red pepper, and sugared pecans were delicious. Great location as well."}
{"text":"I went in and had lunch this week with my family. The food was absolutely fantastic!! Although...the BEST part about the Herb Box was our server Matthew!! We were all very down, and Matthew cheered us right up! His service was A+++ as well! I almost wanted to steal him and bring him over to my restaurant! I still might!!! Best Server Ive encountered in a long time!  All I can say is WOW... Service +Food= Me Coming back again!"}
{"text":"I visited with my family and we had the best food, service, and time!! The Corn and Goat Cheese Flatbread is delicious... Oh and the Salmon is to die for! My dad got the Ribs with apple slaw... Holy moly it was great!   The best part besides the food was our awesome server/bartender named Matthew! He was great! Awesome service and personality! He definitely added to our already awesome meal!!  There was a very respectful and professional manager named Paul who greeted us, asked how are meal was, and said goodbye! I think he's British... He was awesome too!!!  Herb box is now my favorite restaurant! Looking forward to coming back... I'll request Matthew as a server for sure!"}
{"text":"We made reservations and were seated.  After 20 minutes of sitting at our table no one acknowledged us.  Servers just kept walking by.  Confusing.  We left and ate elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great food at both locations. Great ambiance Old Town late afternoon. Friends and I sat at Bar to watch Cardinals game and have wine and small plates. Kitchen closes at 4 on Sunday. Ok but bartender gave impression bar open longer. We ordered quickly before kitchen closed but when ordering another glass of wine, bartender said bar closed. No last call given. His service and attention poor. Otherwise we have loved all meals moth locations. Wait and bar staff iffy on a couple instances."}
{"text":"I recently moved to the area and have eaten at the Herb Box at least one per week since arriving - it's that good.   We discovered this place when visiting the area a few months ago. In a mall with several restaurants, this one was the only one that was jammed - I was interested to find out why. The interior is very nice, a little tight but bright and clean with a few seats outside. Service could be considered slow but the food is well worth the wait.   Crisp Falafel bites, Edamame, and Honey Roasted Pear apps are all winners (the pear knocked my socks off and I don't really like pears). Market Veggie Pita - fantastic. I am addicted to the Pear and Gorgonzola flatbread, the sage pesto and fried sage on it are absolutely outstanding. The Wine Braised Short Ribs...melt in your mouth fantastic, the best short rib I've ever had. Smoked Gouda Mac and Cheese with rosemary breadcrumb topping - as good as it sounds. They also have a nice selection of flavored iced tea which is a big plus.   The only reason I haven't reviewed more dishes is that I've only been here a few weeks. The Vegan Nosh, Cheese Plate and Brussel Sprout and  Pancetta flat bread are next on my hit list."}
{"text":"WOW! WOW! WOW! That is what I have to say about this place! The food is beyond perfection and the service is impeccable. Tommy rocks!!!!"}
{"text":"Like most breakfast/brunch joints, if it's lined up outside you know it's worth the wait. A variety offering of ice teas (mango infused? Yes please!) is the start of what you can expect from Herb Box. Just the sound of red velvet pancakes sounds heavenly. Think about it: stacks of fluffy red pancakes, a dollop of vanilla gelato, lemon syrup drizzled on top and a dusting of icing sugar. And of course, to contrast the sweetness a side of BACON. Go head - you can drool, because I am as I reminisce about my first bite.   I don't think you can go wrong with anything else on the menu, anything they brought past to other tables I had to refrain myself from asking strangers if I can have a bite of their food :)"}
{"text":"I had never been to the Herb Box for breakfast before; in fact, it wasn't even on my radar until I did a little more digging for a nice (not chain) breakfast place in N. Scottsdale near Grayhawk. We were meeting some friends from out-of-town and wanted some good food with great atmosphere. Having had scrumptious lunches and dinners here before, it was an easy decision.  Since there were six of us, and the forecasters were calling for ugly weather, I had the foresight to make reservations for a table so that we wouldn't have to wait. Moments after we arrived, the place was practically full!  Our server was a gem and so patient as she easily picked up on the fact that we all had lots to talk about, so she gave us plenty of time to order. We were already on our second mug of coffee by the time we ordered!!!  The menu is not extensive for breakfast, but there were so many different types of items, I had a hard time making up my mind. I saw a gentleman seated at a table next to us having what looked like an incredible sandwich . . . turned out to be a BLT on brioche (with eggs). That's what I ordered . . . couldn't resist. Neither could my friend. This was a truly beautiful sandwich with the egg cooked perfectly, the bacon crispy, the tomato and arugula fresh, the goat cheese so creamy, and dressed with an amazing aioli that had a slight kick to it.  The guys at the other end of the table ordered a side of potatoes which was enormous and came with the same aioli . . . yum!!!!   The only near-miss, and they rectified it before we could say anything, was that they forgot to put the cheese on the side of my friend's BLT so they had to remake it, so she had a little extra wait before they brought her meal out.   I am never disappointed at the Herb Box. The food is always top notch and the service always attentive. I have to move it to the top of my list for breakfast!"}
{"text":"My husband and I just had a Beautiful evening on the patio overlooking the arts and crafts festival at the waterfront.  Our server, Kylie, was wonderful and attentive.  But as great the atmosphere and service was, the food was even better!  I had a simply delicious salmon BLT.  The salmon was perfect!  Next time I will be trying the grapefruit salmon.  We live and work in the area and we will be back...often!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing and ambience is very nice, elegant yet relaxing.  We had the short rib which was perfectly tender and the charbroiled cabbage had just the right amount of \"char.\"  The avocado shrimp salad was truly unique with just lightly fried fresh shrimp on top of arugula and something similar to avocado toast.  We try different restaurants literally every week and this place has jumped to the top of our list of favorite restaurants in Phoenix.  Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Any day I can have lunch at the Herb Box in Scottsdale is a good day. Throw in sitting on the patio with your friends & the day just got better. Food is off the charts amazing & they have excellent service to match! Everything is yummy here & I think I've tried just about the entire menu...except desert. But today that changed & I tried the Crack Pie & Pumpkin Cheese Cake. Both were delish but the Crack Pie was like a dream! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Build your own bloody Mary bar complete with peppers and bacon. Salmon hash for me and a Kobe burger for the wife. Everything was delicious, can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"We went to the Herb Box 3/30/17 at about 2:00 pm to see if and when they had a happy hour.  I asked the young host if they had a happy hour.  He said no.  I said oh they used to have one.  He said it's not until 3:00.  I asked if I could see a happy hour menu.  He said I don't have one, sorry bud.  I was a little offended by the bud because I am 71 years old.  We left and did some shopping, then came back about 3:20 pm.  The same kid was there.  I asked if he had a happy hour menu we could look at.  He said he did not have one, and that he was real busy now but he would see if he could find one in five or ten minutes if we wanted to wait.  It did not even appear to be that busy.  We enjoyed happy hour elsewhere. We always go to the Herb Box when we are in town and have always had good food and service.  The management needs to give the host a lesson on dealing with the public.  And no I am not his \"bud\"."}
{"text":"When it here for Breakfast and lunch.  Breakfasts are great! You need to try the red velvet pancakes and the con chile verde."}
{"text":"The best meal we have had in Scottsdale! Gorgonzola and Pear flatbread was perfect definitely going back this week."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch- i didnt know this was the home for ladies who lunch in North Scottsdale, place was packed with female guests. I was the only guy. Luckily I was with my wiofe otherwise I probably wouldnt have gotten a table  Ordered a couple of salads- mine with salmon, the blackened salmon was perfect. service prompt and friendly. we had a good lunch and a coffee, got out for less than $40 with a 20% tip  I will be back"}
{"text":"If you are gluten free, the herb box has delicious gluten free desserts. There is not a large selection, but you can always find at least one dessert sitting in the glass window. No matter what I have tried, from honey pound cake, choco quinoa bar, rasberry cake, everything has been yummy and fresh. Love it. The bakery is located downstairs. Cute place!"}
{"text":"Visiting from DC (not only the nations Capitol but the brunch Capitol as well). Did a quick google search for Phoenix brunch and found this restaurant after weeding through a few choices that didn't look so great. I was immediately hooked by the name \"the Herb Box\". Service was great from the moment I stepped through the door. I was quickly seat and had water with a lemon (these people do it right) brought to me.  The waitress was very energetic and friendly.  I first ordered a Melon Mule. I don't normally drink at 0940 in the morning but since I'm on vacation I decided to give it a try. This was one of the best drinks that I've had in a while!  I was a perfect balance of vodka, cucumber, ginger beer, and heaven. It taste like i was drinking right out of a melon. Very refreshing.  I later found out that the waitress was also my bartender!!!  I ordered the bourbon peach French toast, compliments to the chef, it was simply amazing!  Perfect balance of sweet (French toast) and savory (bacon). My only complaint is this entree didn't come with eggs. I ordered some on the side, scrabbled with cheese, they were amazing. I highly recommend this place! I will make this a stop every time that I am in the area!"}
{"text":"I can't rate the experience because I didn't really get one. Here is what I can rate:   I went to try H.B. for the first time on Monday (3/25). When I got there, they took my name and the host said 10 minutes. I came back 15 minutes later, and the same host said another 10 minutes. I came back 10 minutes later and a hostess said I still had 2 names ahead of mine and she apologizes \"we are waiting for the servers to catch up\"  I looked inside and there were plenty of seats. I said \"why not bring people off the curb and offer them drinks at least.\" To which she replied \"sorry, just what my manager said\"  So I called Citizen Public House and they prepared a table for me on the spot. (IT WAS MONDAY) I won't be trying again. Figured I would mention it, as it could have been easily correctable: \"hey can we get you a drink at the bar while you wait\" or \"Hey my apologies, we are very understaffed, can we seat you and offer you a beverage\""}
{"text":"Food and service was amazing. Props to our waiter Tommy whose recommendations were perfect. Mac and cheese in the short rib taco, we never would have thought to mix that! The cauliflower lentil bowl was delicious and the burger were also amazing!"}
{"text":"3* for the service 31/2* for the food 5* for using fresh ingredients but it wouldn't kill you to make it taste good."}
{"text":"Saturday brunch book club pick for our group of 5 ladies and 2 babies.  We met here at 10 am and had ample parking.  We are seated at the big table in the back and wait at least 10 minutes for anyone to take our drink orders even though the place was empty.  We ordered 2 simple breakfasts, buckwheat pancakes, breakfast tacos and stuffed French toast.  Our food was all quite good with everyone happy with their dishes.  Through the meal, our server Cassandra was very lax and uninterested in her job. The first cup of coffee was only filled 1/2 way... ok no prob.  Finally I flag her down for a refill which she says \"I have to brew more\".  Yah do it!  Finally when she comes back she pours another 1/2 cup. Lame!  The manager I believe was a lady in a burgundy dress with lace at the top, who was behind the bar barely checked in at the end and didn't ask us about our experience and just commented on the babies.  This place isn't going to last if they don't improve their baseline service levels."}
{"text":"We love this spot for Sunday brunch!!  We lunched here Sunday around 11- we were seated in our choice of the patio.  I had the vegetarian sweet potato tacos which were great- cubes of skin on sweet potatoes with onions guacamole and some greens.  Served in a flour tortilla is the only downside- would have preferred a wheat tortilla or sprouted grain homemade tortilla.  Side of black bean salsa was very bland- would have preferred the green salsa that was served with my husbands breakfast burrito!  I probably could have asked but I was still enjoying my food.  My husbands breakfast burrito looked good- not too overwhelming.  Everyone at the table next to us was having the Korean ribs so next time we want to try that!!  Yummy iced tea- I has the passion tea, no new for sweetener.  Also we asked about dessert and she listed a few options.  If we had a dessert menu to browse we would have been more tempted :)"}
{"text":"Seated but not served.  After waiting 15 minutes I returned to the hostess stand and shared that we had not been visited by a server. The hostess said she send an associate over immediately and walked me back to the table.  After another few mintues and no server, we left.  Total time investment, including a short wait for a table, 40 mintues. And we didn't even get a glass of water."}
{"text":"Came here for happy hour and the food, drinks, and prices didn't disappoint. Sat at the bar and the bartender was friendly but not overbearing.  Definitely plan on going back."}
{"text":"I was traveling for business and my office is right around the corner from Herb Box. The menu looked great so I decided to check it out after work. I arrived early (around 4:45) and it was pretty dead but by 5-5:30 the volume definitely picked up.   Usually I like to sit at the bar when I dine alone but I wanted to be outside and the outdoor bar wasn't open so I sat on the patio. I was quiet and peaceful which was perfect for me.   I started with the roasted fingerling potatoes as an app which were delicious; like thick french fries made with baby potatoes. My entree was the short rib enchiladas and they were phenomenal! They were served with a refreshing and tasty salad that had a little kick to it. For dessert, I chose the lemon custard with sugar cookie crust. If heaven were a dessert, it would be this! I'm only sad that I live in Philly  and likely won't be back often to get this dessert and it's much too complicated for me to replicate.   Dylan L. was my server and he was fabulous. He made great suggestions on the food and checked back on me just often enough. Great prices, great food, and great atmosphere. Should I find myself in Scottsdale again, I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love Herb Box.  For lunch I'm a huge fan of the Korean Cauliflower and Blackened Salmon BLT.  However, dinner is where they rule the day.  Their Thai ribs are insanely good. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Great ambiance, but breakfast is suboptimal.  Delivers on taste, yet if you are not a bacon lover - looks like more than half of menu has bacon - than you might be disappointed with options. Not kid friendly at all, I would almost say adults only - very hard to navigate with a stroller. Last but not least out of three waiters that we have interacted, two has been pretty uninterested in our business (ie one couldn't understand why I wouldn't want bacon and thought it is worthless with offering no substitutes, second one made me pass all the plates while cleaning table.)  In summary, we likely wouldn't be back. Good food, yet very limited options if you aren't a meat lover and traumatically poor service."}
{"text":"Beautiful place in the heart of old town Scottsdale. You must try this place. I live so close and can't believe I haven't tried it before. Fresh food, great location, good service. What else ?"}
{"text":"Pretty much nailed on prior Yelp reviews but figured I'd add my two cents.  Atmosphere, decor, etc is very solid.  Exactly what you'd expect in this area of Scottsdale.  Food was good.  Not off the charts but solid.  Appreciated the \"normal\" portion sizes.  Seems many places try and impress with volume rather than quality.  Service was slow.  Real slow.  Sunday morning and we were just chilling out so not a big deal.  Just know what you're getting in to."}
{"text":"Weekends are meant for lazy, relaxed breakfasts.  We like to bring our golden retriever with us when we go out for breakfast and our very favorite place to go is The Herb Box that is located in the DC Ranch Marketplace.  There are three small tables that sit separated from the rest of the outside tables.  It's nice to be away from too many people when your dog weighs 80 pounds and drools for food!  The staff is fantastic.  Most of them make the attempt to come out and say hi to Wrigley.  The food is delicious.  I tend to order the classic egg breakfast or the pancakes with fresh fruit and my husband never leaves without eating one of their sweet potato muffins.  But their iced coffee is the best in town.   Now, if I could only get them to have complimentary Sunday NY Times newspapers for reading, the experience would be perfect!"}
{"text":"Very nice place in Scottsdale. Really friendly service and knowledgeable as well as we had questions about both drinks and food.  Casual decor , seating inside and out. Drinks were very good and they also had a decent wine selection.  Food was good but for a place that sells itself as healthy etc I found all of the food exceptionally greasy. In my opinion way too much oil that really interferes with the flavor of the food. A little is ok , and especially a place called The Herb Box should taste fresher"}
{"text":"My wife and I had a wonderful view from our spot on the patio next to the tense. That is where the beauty of the place went down hill. The service, especially on our cocktails was extremely slow. I decided upon the hamburger which was very disappointing in that the meat was dry and overlooked.  There is a lot of competition close by.  I will not return for another meal'  Steve"}
{"text":"A truly seasonal menu, I love it! The menu is so fresh and really utilizes what's in season at the time. The staff is very knowledgable, service is fast and very friendly. Their patio is a lovely place for a light dinner or a later snack and drink.  I think the prices are awesome and the portions are ample. Order the crunchy green potato side dish, seriously. It is amazing! I had to force myself to only eat half to save some for my husband. And smoked trout beignets? So good. Especially served with cornichons.  Enjoy a glass of wine or champagne and dine on some truly fresh, unique dishes. I will be back."}
{"text":"Herbs, herbs, herbs in all things.  Order the enchiladas, and watch yourself begin to love life again!  Seriously.  Order them enchiladas.  Nice atmosphere, especially in the outdoor seating.  Also tried a couple of the flatbreads, and they were pretty amazing.  Friendly staff."}
{"text":"First and last.   Suspecting it may be busy as it is Superbowl week here in the Scottsdale/Phoenix area, I made a reservation for ourselves and two out of town guests (4).  To our surprise (but not really considering the service), the restaurant was practically empty.    When we arrived the hostess barely acknowledged us and she seemed to be rather unhappy to have to take care of us.   We asked to be seated next to the fireplace.    As it stood, a table of 3 had been set up there, and when we made this request, she seemed unwilling or unable to accommodate our request.  Surely it could have been arranged as no one was in the restaurant.  She ended up seating us in a dark corner (the lights overhead had not been turned on) and promptly walked away.  Not saying someone would be with us, a name of the server, etc.  Very poor  At this point I am getting the overwhelming feeling I've made a mistake in choosing this place.   Once seated, we looked over the menu, but could barely read in the dark.   We took it upon ourselves to move tables  (literally there was possibly 8-10 in the entire place so it was pretty easy to move around).    At our new table, we looked over the menu and discussed possibilities...at this point we had been there upwards of 20 minutes and no one had acknowledged us any further.    We decided to walk out....and even still no one even seemed to care that we were leaving, asking if there was a problem, NOTHING.....I was really looking forward to trying this place but now I not return."}
{"text":"Haven't eaten here in some time but liked it in the past. Asked for a seat on the patio outside and could we get a heater? Hostess wasn't really encouraging about the heater so we asked another 3 times before we actually got what we requested. Service was slow and just okay. Food is good but with all the competition in the area, and comments about the staff, you would think they would step up their game. I asked for corn tortillas when I ordered, and got flour. Took a long time to bring them to the table along with salt. And no one apologized. Heard others complaining about the service too. Servers didn't seem too concerned about making the customer happy. Probably cross this off our list of favorites and try some new spots that have great food and value the customer."}
{"text":"Excellent fare!  I was expecting better, to be honest, based on all the great reviews, but this place still serves up great food and service."}
{"text":"Today I'm having the cinnamon buckwheat pancakes with orange chicken the service is excellent"}
{"text":"We love this place ..the short rib tacos are really yummy and half price during happy hour.  I also have started eating Brussels sprouts here super tasty try them they will convert you.. We have sat at the bar both visits. Jason and Rico have both been great!  I love how you can sit outside and yet be at the bar at the same time.. This is my new fav spot.. And if you need treats to take home the market place is great!!"}
{"text":"Food was slow to come out of the kitchen and in one word, \"bland\".  Short rib enchiladas lacked any flavor, the slaw wasn't dressed, the brussel sprouts tasteless.  Exceedingly disappointed."}
{"text":"Great food, cool atmosphere, located in a nice relaxed strip of businesses and other restaurants.  The blackened steak served with the blistered peppers is an absolutely phenomenal combo!"}
{"text":"So I went here for Brunch on Mother's Day with my mom and sister. We had a reservation at 9:00 am, we tried to get a reservation for 10:00 but they told us they were all booked throughout the day and 9:00 was the only time that could hold seats for us. When we got there the restaurant was mostly empty, with maybe three other tables dining with servers and employees standing around, and it stayed that way throughout the entire course of our meal. We left around 10:15ish and I think maybe two other tables showed up.  When we made the reservation they did not tell us that for Mother's Day they were doing a buffet, they didn't seem to announce this on social media either. The buffet was alright, but it was mostly if not entirely composed of regular menu items sitting out. Most food was room temperature or just straight up cold. I ended up eating the Korean cauliflower, roasted edamame, peach french toast, and veggie enchiladas, all of which are regular menu items. Each one of these dishes seemed wrong in some way. The cauliflower had virtually no sauce on it and was totally bland, despite being labelled \"Korean\" and coming with sauce, the french toast was cold, and the peaches on it came in small cuts, the enchiladas were extremely cold, and the cheese on top wasn't melted, and the way they roasted the edamame caused the shells to split open, losing edamame beans. I counted three shells that were burnt to a crisp with no edamame inside. This method also doesn't really do anything to make the edamame taste any different from traditionally steaming them.  I went to their bathroom midway through my meal and it was unkempt, and they were out of toilet paper. I had to make use of their paper toilet seat covers that seemed haphazardly thrown around the stall in individual boxes in order to get my business done. Tearing open a box, and then ripping the seat cover inside up so it was useable.   By the end of the meal the check came out, and the hostess/server told us not to bother tipping because it was included in the price which was 123 dollars for three people. Absolutely absurd given that I'm almost certain everything on that bar is a regular menu item you could pay 15 dollars or less for, but that wasn't the end. When our checks were brought back to us they added a 20% gratuity bringing the total cost of each meal to just short of $50. Total scam. The cauliflower is probably good if it's warm, but I could've gotten basically the same thing at various restaurants around town for under ten dollars, and it would've been hot, and had sauce. I am tempted to give this restaurant two stars since the food wasn't awful, but then I remember they charged me 50 dollars for a brunch buffet they didn't tell anyone about, and didn't even put toilet paper in the bathroom."}
{"text":"Friday March 10th 7:30-8:45pm -HORRIBLE experience!! Waited a full 25 minutes after being seated - finally got the attention of hostess who was embarrassed and got the Bartender to wait on me. He was great and very nice - HOWEVER - 25 minutes later still no appetizer. I had only ordered a Chili, With entree to follow. The Bartender was savvy enough to see my agitation about 20 minutes in and sent me a drink on the house - saying he spoke to the kitchen and my soup would be right out. After 12 more minutes I gave up and left. I spent over an hour at that table and never had a bite of food.  I spoke to the manager (Rhonda I believe ) who said they had a large party and sorry. That moment was the first I had seen her the hour I was there. This place doesn't care about hospitality. Not one waiter made eye contact as I sat there those first 25 minutes. I NEVER saw anyone in charge as far as a supervisor or manager goes. No one checking the room, the outdoor area or bar area. Just waiters walking around in a robotic deer in the headlights look - clearly short staffed. It all starts from the top!!! If management is bad, then wait staff will follow their leader. This was my last night in Phoenix and I was so looking forward to a nice dinner out. What a total disappointment. Full disclosure- I've been in Hospitality business for 35 years."}
{"text":"I wasn't here long and just had an appetizer but the food was delicious and the atmosphere was cool. I had a corn gratin and my friend has the shrimp salad (don't remember the exact name) and both were A+. The service was quick (food came out in 5 min) but our particular server was a little bit cold. She seemed abrupt and like she was just ready to get our order and go. She gave us a dessert menu and then came back in what felt like two minutes. After I paid my check she came to grab it without asking if I had signed it or even taken my card back. Her rush almost lost her a tip because I didn't have time to write it in!   All in all great spot and I would recommend it to anyone. I would imagine this server was having an off night or at the very least isn't indicative of the service as a whole."}
{"text":"Super pretty indoor and outdoor setting in a great location. Fresh yummy ingredients on the menu. Ordered the sweet potato avocado bowl and it tasted great...was expecting it to be warm, but they definitely serve it cold as an FYI."}
{"text":"I love the Herb Box!  It's a great space with a lot of different seating options - tables, high tops, inside, outside, bar, etc.  They are also really open to letting you sit where you want, which is nice.  Brunch menu has a ton of options - both breakfasty items plus other good finds like tacos and salads.  There are also a ton of vegetarian and meat options so it's really a place you can bring anyone, even your picky friends.  The food here is also really good - tons of flavor and so tasty.  Taking off one star for price point.  Would return and recommend."}
{"text":"Took my Mom out for a girl's day and so enjoyed our lunch! We had the steak salad and it was delicious. The filet was cooked a perfectly, great seasoning and I love the organic greens. The patio setting was so relaxing, just what we needed before our afternoon facials."}
{"text":"Had the pleasure of eating here while enjoying art on the Scottsdale Waterfront. Everyone in our party made comments that there salmon sandwich was the best they have ever had.  I had one of the best salads I've ever had. Great food...can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Want a post-meal bakery snack and a hot beverage?  You'd be better served somewhere else.  During dinner service, the counter is pretty frenetic, but service is indeed fast.  They have a variety of hot beverages, coffee and not, and a selection of pastries and other bakery items.  Unfortunately they always taste super stale and dry. If you don't get any of these items, you're looking at a solid 4-star venue.  For dining in, I do love the flatbreads! Pear and gorgonzOMGla!  Service is always pretty good, and the live music some nights is a fun touch."}
{"text":"We stopped by here for lunch with the family. The venue itself is very night -it's large, open, and seating both inside and outside. We chose to sit inside, as it was a bit chilly outside. We got there are the perfect timing, as the happy hour menu was just about to start (at 3 pm). We ordered a ton of stuff off the happy hour menu, as it all sounded so good! We go the korean fried cauliflower, brussel sprout chips, avocado love (essentially avocado toast), mac and cheese, falafel, and the roasted beet and apple salad. For the entrees, we got the enchiladas and the sweet potato tacos. The korean cauliflower and brussel sprout chips were my two favorite from the apps. They were perfectly cooked, flavorful, and unique. I would definitely order these two if I were to go back. The salad was also great and refreshing! I would pass on the mac and cheese and avocado love; the mac and cheese has a smokey flavor, which I'm not a huge fan of, and the avocado love was pretty basic - can get something similar at most other places.   The sweet potato tacos were my absolute FAVORITE from everything we tried that day. I was also stuffed by the time we got them, but my mom insisted that I try a bite - I ended up finishing the entire taco. The sweet potato was so perfectly cooked, there was so much flavor in every bite, and the avocado salsa just perfectly tied the entire dish together. I have been craving these since! The enchiladas were also great! Would order both these dishes again.   The serving sizes are quite small, especially for the price - but a great deal at the happy hour prices. Would recommend going at happy hour so you can try all these delicious dishes at a deal!"}
{"text":"oh my gosh, this place was just amazing. there was nothing that i didn't like about this place. we shared the crab dip as an appetizer which was really good, not too heavy. i ordered a turkey apple swiss wrap. AMAZING. and the sweet potato chips that come with the dish was just so good i was full but couldn't stop eating!  we shared a red velvet cupcake and it was just AMAZING you have got to try it!!  one thing that i wasn't satisfied was the manager there. we split the bill 3 ways and somehow the server messed it up so she had to get the manager to fix it and it took about 20 minutes and the manager brought out the checks and didn't even apologize or thank us. he just dropped em off and said \"here you go then\" and walked away. Maybe he was having a bad day.  Anyway, the food there was AMAZING. Everything was so fresh and seasoned right. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Just had lunch at the Herb Box. I had the urban steak salad. I have never had a more tender steak. It was perfection. The atmosphere is lovely, pleasant, calm. The service was excellent. I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"We found this place on accident when Olive & Ivy was packed one night and could not have been more pleased! First, the decor is awesome. It's sort of this rustic yet contemporary Cape Cod look and the bathrooms are the best in the city! The service was perfect and the food-- even better. I got the trout with fried spinach and some sort of cheesy vegetable side dish that was amazing. My boyfriend got the spare ribs with mac and cheese. It was equally as good. On and the desert! The trio is a perfect way to end the meal and everything was so good. This is the perfect date night location."}
{"text":"Everyone's food was delicious.  Sevice was very good.  Not a terrific children's menu, but we fed our youngest from bits of everyone else's plate.  That worked very well."}
{"text":"Where else but Scottsdale can you sit outside for lunch on December 24th! Food,  service,  location and ambiance all great."}
{"text":"I loved this place. Lots of great choices, with lots of great flavor but not over the top.  I had the morning glory muffin to start and it was packed with goodness, carrots, raisins, walnuts, delicious! Then I got the salad with chicken on it - when it came out I thought I needed to ask for more dressing, but it was just right.  The server was friendly, personable and quick. We even bantered about the OKC T"}
{"text":"Great spot for happy hour but a little pricey for dinner. We got there towards the tail end of happy hour. They have decent drink specials and a good variety of appetizers. We tried the brussel sprouts, kale pakoras, and flatbread. All of them were really good but I would recommend the kale pakoras. They had the perfect amount of batter, crispness, and spice.   For dinner our table got the salmon with black quinoa which had a decent amount of flavor. We also got the fried chicken that comes with a corn slaw that was really good. The dinner portions are a good size.   The crack pie is really popular and some of the folks got that to go. They also have a dessert menu with some good options.   I'd probably stop by again for happy hour sometime."}
{"text":"Wife and I had an early lunch here. We split the pork belly sliders and the Mac and cheese. Both were on the \"starter\" menu but filled us up since we weren't starving. Both were very good. My wife had a mango lemonade which was incredible. Service was great and we sat outside on the beautiful shaded patio. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Their vegan options were on point. Got the nosh board which had Brussel sprout chips, edamame, a kale corn thing (they had a nice name for it, I don't remember) and cauliflower with quinoa. All was really good. Only complaint was the edamame was fried which breaks open the shell so most of the beans were missing -_- not to mention the unnecessary oil intake. They had a couple other vegan options which I'd like to try too. Somewhat expensive, $45 for the board (basically a shared appetizer) and 2 drinks. I think the main attraction here is the patio, it is beautiful with big trees and pretty lights."}
{"text":"I was recently in for lunch on a Friday with 12 ladies from high school.  We had the very best service from a young gentleman who was extremely attentive, accomodating and seemed to love his job because of the proud smile he wore.  The food was quite tasty as well; we all had salads or wraps and passed around the fabulous sweet potato chips.  The Herb Box is a place I'll return to again and again.  I love the wine/beer selection as well served up by Rico!!"}
{"text":"Great place for sandwich or salad! Turkey with brie is an awesome way to go. Steak salad is fantastic as well. Great happy hour."}
{"text":"Yummmmm.   When I worked down the street I had the opportunity to eat here a few times for lunch. My work paid for it so it was a bit more than I would normally spend for a lunch but it was so tasty that I've went back since and paid for the food on my own dime (and without a Groupon, can you believe it!)   As stated by my first word in the review, the food here is really good. The menu is for sure trendy and filled with all the buzz words that 5 years ago nobody would understand. Don't matter though. Also being right near the \"waterfront\" the interior is really airy and the whole place has a nice ambiance to it.   I remember the service being a slight bit slow if your trying to get in and out and back to your office on your hour lunch. If you have the time, I could see myself hanging out with friends and letting the conversation continue until the lunch crowd has just about cleared out."}
{"text":"Very lively outside sitting area that I really enjoy , but unfortunately food monotone and completely lack in spices or herbs  despite restaurant  name . My short ribs taco was good portion with great meat amount but completely lacking in salt, paper and all other spices and herbs, not me not or  my wife was able to finish our dishes secondary to that"}
{"text":"Will Yelp ever bring us the 1/2 star? I know everyone would use it. I had a 3.5 star experience.  We (Jim W, our daughter Abby and I) joined fellow Yelpers Scott W, Heather and Ryan C and organizer Aileen B for a brunch UYE this morning. So the company was five star.  I would give the atmosphere and service five stars as well. The place has a really open feel and the patio looked very inviting. The service was unobtrusive yet attentive. My water glass never ran empty.  The place they lost me was the food. I ordered steak and eggs. The steak was delicious, albeit petite. The fingerling potatoes were fine, nothing to write home about. But the eggs were not cooked right. If you can't get my scrambled eggs right (I order them scrambled lightly) you're not going to wow me. Especially if you charge me $15 for a diminutive steak and smattering of overdone eggs. I thought all the offerings a tad pricey, which my family attributed to Scottsdale Waterfront real estate prices, but this was the first time I have ever been hungry between brunch and dinner.  Would I go there again? Possibly. I doubt I'd go for brunch. But the raves over dinner make me curious. Maybe they could wow me the second time around."}
{"text":"I am really into good tasting food and this place lacked just that, taste. Everything was just bland. I should have known as soon as the waitress told me not to order the skirt steak. The service was lacking as well."}
{"text":"Food was actually very good. but the service was non-existent. No silverware or napkins without requesting them. 15 minutes for drinks; one was not what had been ordered and required additional wait. Coffee was completely cold on delivery. Waiter was out to lunch."}
{"text":"As one of my fave restaurant's in Scottsdale, the Herb Box is the perfect place for a great patio and lunch. At dinner the atmosphere is subtly romantic with string lights illuminating the patio. Other than the ambiance, the food is some of the best fresh local food I've tasted. A personal favorite is the Free Range Chicken with Goat Cheese... Can you say tasty? My mouth waters just thinking about it. Walking in, the crew at the Herb Box is some of the friendliest you'll ever meet (and the funniest). When you go, make sure to save room for dessert... the cheesecake of the moment is always a win!"}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant on many occasions but always for lunch. I have always been happy with their food, service and ambience. The food was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Great place and patio with cool atmosphere! The drinks were good as well as the service. The food was ok but not special.  We came back a second time and really love the broiled brussel sprouts! I would order these again."}
{"text":"What happened to the old Herb Box?!?!??  Service and food have gone downhill!  I ordered a wrap at 14 dollars and it was just thrown together:(. So disappointing. It's now too pricey for what you get. I'm afraid I won't be going back anymore!"}
{"text":"ok... Emily FORCED me ... yeah that's right... FORCED me to eat the mushroom appetizer they were serving at the YELP Birthday Party.  It was actually REALLY good!  I don't eat mushrooms due to my mom forcing them down my throat while I was a kid.  I actually tasted it and ate the whole thing!  If my wife reads this or anyone else... you can call her and ask for yourself! :)"}
{"text":"Love this place!!  I had their short rib tacos.  They were delicious!  Their staff was very friendly and inviting.  Definitely will be eating here again."}
{"text":"This is a great addition to the old town area for a delicious breakfast or lunch spot when you want really fresh food and a great patio.  I have enjoyed the amazing weather here the past two weekends and have had consistently delicious food and great service as well.  The sweet potato chips are awesome and the salads are very fresh and unique as well and I CAN'T WAIT to try the red velvet pancakes next time...YUM!"}
{"text":"I keep returning to The Herb Box because every time I try something new and love my meal.   First of all, EVERY time I HAVE to have the Korean cauliflower. Do not miss this appetizer. It's a must.  On my last dinner visit, my waiter sold me on the Thai BBQ Baby Back Ribs, which come with a green apple slaw, jicama & watercress, and smoked gouda mac-n-cheese. Yum.The green apple slaw was the perfect contrast to the rich mac-n-cheese, and the ribs were ridiculously tender.   For lunch my go-to has been the Urban Market Steak Salad (grilled beef tenderloin, ancho-bourbon demi, watercress, avocado, sweet red pepper, bacon, sugared pecan, sweet dried corn, gorgonzola), but my co-worker had the Chicken-Avocado Chop Salad and said it was the best salad he'd ever had. Really. Direct quote: \"This is the best salad I've ever had.\" So, I might need to try that next time."}
{"text":"Highly disappointed in the level of service from my past experience. I would not suggest going here to anyone using a stroller, wheelchair or any form of that nature. Staff members just looked at us as we tried to figure out how to get our stroller up all their stairs they have and never once said can I help you or are you looking for a table or any type of acknowledgement.  My mom went to the hostess and tried to get a table, sure enough we asked to be seated outside since we were carrying the stroller up all those stairs. The hostess said the only table available was next to the hostess stand outside which would mean carrying the stroller up a few more set of stairs... Mind you that there were five other tables outside with no one sitting at them or no reserved signs. At this point in time my dad found the ramp entrance into the back of the restaurant where an employee could have directed us but passing 5 workers from the entire time being no one said one thing to us that in that direction we have a ramp or stroller access... of course we weren't looking to sit next to the hostess stand we settled to sit inside. Thanks to the hostess who put us right by the front door with our stroller and who was pleasant to throw the menus on the table and not move a chair out of the way for us to put our stroller. No problem I guess it's my job as the customer to move my own chair at the table to the middle of the walk way and let you guys figure out where it should go. It was so bad I couldn't believe I sat there and had lunch. I was fired up with the first 3 mins of being here and how no staff member could even say one word or acknowledge us with seeing we had a stroller. Friendliness 0,  Accommodating 0, Likeliness to come back Never."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite brunch spots. The patio is so pleasant and there is usually a DJ. We sat and chatted for hours- the best part of brunch! We all enjoyed our food. Lots of mimosa options.  My only issue was that we were told we'd get a text when our table was ready. We never got a text and went to check with the hostess. She said she texted us but took us off the list because we didn't respond. We were like 2 feet away....annoying. There were clearly tons of open tables and they didn't even call our name."}
{"text":"I stopped here for a mojito while shopping Old Town.  Service was fast.   But I don't get the raves about the menu.  Frankly it looked unimaginative.  But predictability sells, too.  The place could use some spiffing since it's showing wear from its many devoted patrons."}
{"text":"Crazy this place has 4 star rating, remains busy and somehow still doesn't have enough money to pay their employees, weeks after payroll with no urgency to fix the issue. Wouldn't have this rating without the dedication of their employees, the corporation shows no compassion for the troubles they are causing."}
{"text":"Awesome! Fresh, innovative food served in a lovely place.   Anthony was my server and he was very good at providing some insight and guiding me through the menu--offering suggestions but not being pushy.  Go now!"}
{"text":"THE HERB BOX--Took an out of town guest to this cozy spot. Food and service was amazing. We arrived during happy hour and were able to order hh food and drink to our table. Food was fresh and delicious. Drinks were perfectly balanced. I had the lemon basil martini (or two;) and we ordered a bunch of the hh appetizers which were great. I recommend the cauliflower. Our friend from the midwest loved the short rib. I love how the app's all came with a little something healthy like fresh greens and/or couscous. They don't skimp on the healthy stuff which I so appreciate. We split a couple entrees among the three of us. Both were good, again with lots of healthy accompaniments. My favorite was the salmon (sustainable!). --We always say, a restaurant is only as good as it's waitstaff and bartender, and I can't say enough good things about them. They took great care of us. Sasha and Carlos were awesome! They worked around us beautifully and were careful not to interrupt as we caught up with our out of town guest. Thank you Sasha and Carlos! Shout out to the bartender too that served us awesome drinks. Didn't get his name. Please pass our gratitude on to him as well.:)"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what it is about Herb Box, but I don't get overly excited to come here. A great spot for a women's day/night out or vegetarians. The Pakora starter is tasty and my favorite entree is the Butternut Squash and Corn Enchiladas. My wife and most women seem to enjoy the atmosphere, location, and food. If you are in the area I think walking across the bridge to Olive and Ivy is a better play."}
{"text":"I wish there were half stars because I would say it deserves more than three but I can't bring myself to give it four stars.  We decided to go back to The Herb Box this weekend for dinner, I have previously been to another location and I kind of thought it was two pegs above Pita Jungle (just my opinion) service was very good and we started the evening with our server explaining the menu, ingredients, restaurant and she explained and explained and then explained some more it was almost getting awkward because it felt as though we had a third person at the table.  She was super sweet and meant well but she explained every part of the evening to death and then explained something else. I had the wine braised boneless short ribs with fried shallots, celery root and potato cakes. It was a good fresh piece of meat with good flavor the potato cake was lightly fried and not overly salty.  My actual dining partner had the Serrano shrimp and avocado salad.  The shrimp was very good and Ingredients was fresh, white bean chili with cilantro cream sauce probably my favorite dish I wish I ordered it."}
{"text":"If I could eat here all-day everyday, I would. Best of EVERYTHING (especially their iced-tea.... MMM)"}
{"text":"I remember this place when it was on shea and it was only open for lunch and they mostly did catering and had weird hours. I would always get the chicken arugula wrap and I could never get enough. Then it got popular and then it moved closer to me...I absolutely love their whole menu...I cannot get enough of this place.  Let's start with breakfast...OMG the red velvet pancakes...can you say DELICIOUS and FABULOUS!!! i do not even like pancakes but these are amazing and they are so decadent...You also have to try the granola trifle it is great for something on the lighter end, but it is filling. The Market Street BLT is also a favorite I love the pancetta and that the sandwich is on a brioche makes it even better! The strawberry Lassi is nice and refreshing...another fabulous option is the Chilequiles the pulled pork is so tender and flavorful...yum yum yum...also try the Goat Cheese and Chive omelet!! I promise you will not be disappointed with this place for breakfast! They have brunch which combines breakfast and lunch/dinner menu items.  Lunch/Dinner options OMG OMG OMG...starters are amazing try the sweet potato chips, the hummus, the prosciutto wrapped shrimp are a great starter...they are just amazing!! There are so many sandwiches to choose from because they are all great! I love the Grilled Chicken and Sage Pesto sandwich!!!!! I love the apple and with the pesto and goat cheese....great combo!!! The grilled petite fromage is fantastic as well...my son loves this sandwich and he is two! I love the coconut shrimp salad it is amazing!! Now the flatbreads are so fantastic you can get these for your meal or to share with the table. My favorites are all of them!!!!! I cannot just pick one! They are all phenomenal!  They all have great ingredients and how they make each one is just fantastic.  I cannot get enough!!!  Then there are the enchiladas...I do not even like butternut squash but these are great!  The pecans are awesome with it!!  The Kobe Burger and the short rib tacos are two other great entrees...The two last entrees that I love are the thai bbq ribs and the beef tenderloin!!  Now there are the sides that you could have as lunch or dinner too...there is the mac and cheese OMG talk about rich!!  The mushroom risotto cake they are great!!! I love it!!! My favortie  desserts are the chocolate cake...yum who doesnt love a great chocolate cake...but my all time favorite dessert here is the peach ice cream sandwich cookie....the caramel is amazing!!   I cannot say enough good things about this place.  I love this restaurant!  I wish I could go more often!"}
{"text":"I hosted my monthly Meetup group's brunch here last month. It was a group of 12. The food was really good! Bacon booked to perfection, steak & eggs absolutely divine.... The pancakes!! Yikes!!! All delicious!!  Primarily we chose this place for the mimosas and live music as advertised on Yelp, however while we were there about 3 Sunday's ago, no live music.   The place is small, small. We had 12 in our group. We often bumped chairs with the table behind us while backing away from our table or standing up. I'd definitely give them a try again .... Without a group!"}
{"text":"We couldn't get a reservation until late and when we got there they sat us in a closed section. We finally had to get up and ask for service after waiting over 30 minutes for help. Once they did help us and we received our food, they didn't come back to refill our drinks or ask if we needed anything else. We probably would have had more wine and other refills if they had.   The food, however, was very delicious, well presented and there were several unique items on the menu. I had an Avocado and habenero shrimp salad that was delicious. My hubby had the short rib enchiladas which were also delicious.   Our experience would have been fabulous if not for the poor service."}
{"text":"The Herb Box is my FAVORITE brunch spot. Their red velvet pancakes are to die for and their bacon is cooked to perfection. I've never had a bad experience here and they sometimes have crazy awesome mimosa flavors. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The best brunch!   Love this place the service and food for brunch is Amazon my.  Salads for lunch great as well"}
{"text":"Terrible super slow service for overpriced small portions. 20 employees but none smiling or engaging with customer. Waited 45 minutes brought only half of the order."}
{"text":"This location was highly recommended....although I can't figure out why! Now granted I have only been here this one time & maybe I had ordered the wrong thing~     I ate here on a Sunday, didn't order the brunch menu and ordered a BLT (without the egg, as listed on the menu) with avocado on brioche. Well it was ok, however the bacon (pancetta) was almost invisible it was more like a tomato, avocado & greens sandwich quite disappointing really.     The setting is lovely setting with indoor or outdoor options, a full bar and a desserts counter too! Ez FREE parking a plus ~     Would I try this place again? Probably as I hear their short rib enchiladas are quite the bomb and as we were having Mexican food for dinner I didn't order them.......in hind site I should have ~ Oh well ~ Live & Learn still applies"}
{"text":"Where to start....my only problem with herb box is the 13hr drive to get there..;) The food is fantastic, the service is wonderful Love this place."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with my friend. Their salad was very tasty and the waiter was very helpful and friendly. We received quick service. It's Scottsdale prices though. I can get a better salad at 24 Carrots or Pomegranate in Ahwatukee for much less. Nevertheless it's a cool lunch spot."}
{"text":"Lovely outdoor patio with a nice well rounded menu. Service was good and the waiter was a server, not an order taker. Gave us a verbal tour of the menu and helped us to see other items we didn't see just reading the menu. Both our dishes were amazing - Enchiladas and Salmon. Both were delicious and perfectly cooked and presented. We will be back."}
{"text":"AMAZING.. AMAZING.. AMAZING.. Great location, great atmosphere., great food, good service.. dessert I could have pased on, but other than that I had fantastic experience... I have a friend coming in town at the end of the month, cant wait to bring her!  LOVE THE BATHROOM (scottsdale location).."}
{"text":"Went here over Christmas with some friends and it was so good.  The cheese and charcuterie plate is a fabulous idea (being able to pick what you want) and the food was all amazing.  we're definitely itching to go back again.  with the cheese and charcuterie plate, it's also a great option if you just want to go for a glass of wine and some snacks.  it is more than just an amazing meal, it's a place to relax and unwind!"}
{"text":"Play by play. With a reservation, seated immediately ahead of a long line of customers  Seating, as in chairs, not a big fan of stools or high profile chairs--the place is half high chairs and regular chairs.  5+ min for someone to wait on us  Waitress simply was slow  nice but slow.  I heard too many apologies around me from multiple wait staff for slow service.  Granola trifle is excellent!  The kale/Brie omelette average (the best omelettes are at Buttermilk Pancake House).  The wheat toast very good. The coffee good but expect strong. Overall, overpriced for all-in value."}
{"text":"Really disappointing expierence with the service and the management made it even worse.  Food took a long time, ordered apps and then food.  Everything just piled at once.  They messed up the food order.  Vegetarian and they put bacon in our food.  Said they would comp and made us another.  Then said \"well we made you another one and you at it so we decided to bill you for it\".  Sent to management first and they didn't respond to my email.  Sooooo 1 star for you."}
{"text":"I have been to the Herb Box in DC Ranch, which I loved, but today was my first time at the one in Old Town. Needless to say, it impressed again.  A friend and I met for Sunday Brunch which was great because it allowed us the full breakfast menu as well as the lunch menu if we wanted.    Not being a big egg fan, I was hesitant at trying the Chilaquiles, but the waiter informed me that I could get just one egg if I preferred.  It was actually delicious!  The tomatillo salsa that they pair with the pork creates the right combination of flavors.  The food is a little on the pricier side but that is what you get if you want all fresh local ingredients.  I am definitely willing to pay more for quality, which is exactly what the Herb Box has.  Not to mention the beautiful patio seating which should not be missed out on if the weather is right!"}
{"text":"Great healthy food and very friendly/helpful staff at the downstairs market.  I highly recommend the market sunflower salad!"}
{"text":"Quaint and relaxing with delicious food! The salmon and leeks were excellent. Loved the outside seating area. There was a good, relaxing singer the night we were there. The staff and manager were friendly and accommodating. Delicious desserts too! The fingerling potatoes would be better if they were smashed and fried in a skillet rather than a deep fat fryer. Will be back."}
{"text":"Great choice for a dinner out.  Good menu, not extensive though.  Nice selection of cocktails, beer and wine.  We started with the trout beignets - unique, breaded.  Good choice for a starter.  I had the steak for my entree.  Thought that the sauce it was served with was particularly tasty, as were the crispy onion rings that accompanied it.  My wife enjoyed her salad as well.  Topped it off by taking home a slice of cheesecake.  We were particularly impressed with the friendly and attentive service we received.  Our server was helpful, personable, and conversational.  Overall, we had a very pleasant experience here and would willingly return."}
{"text":"Everthing was wonderful!  Great wraps, sweet potato chips & service.  Loved sitting on the patio, too!"}
{"text":"The food was good and service was great. Nice atmosphere. We came in for brunch, and I ordered the steak and eggs, which was steak and eggs - very good. My husband ordered the street tacos, which had a lot of flavor and were plenty filling. I want to give this place 5 stars, and I think if the food had a touch more... Something... I would be giving it 5/5. I will come back to see if I get that something next time."}
{"text":"Clean and refreshing. All ingredients are fresh and different which makes for a tasty adventure for your pallet. I had the Grapefruit & Sugar seared Salmon and it was just delicious. The chefs just have it."}
{"text":"Organic coffee people! Their little market here is awesome and is totally overlooked as a great little coffee chill spot in old town. It's right off the canal, a short walk to the mall and it has super comfy chairs. Organic coffee with refills - YES! I recommend this as your little coffee shop nook hide-away. Lost a star because their wifi does not work at the market/coffee shop."}
{"text":"Hello Az, went back today to the Herb Box. As usual food was outstanding !!! But what a disappoint in The staff. A smile on faces goes a long way... Dry expressionless faces and attitudes makes this place go from 5 to a 3 !!!! Everyday should be a great experience in a restaurant !!!"}
{"text":"My absolute favorite restaurant in the area.   Great menu that rotates on occasion.   The food is seriously great!"}
{"text":"This place is really nice inside. Great atmosphere, comfy seats, polite staff, and a cool vibe. I really was impressed from the moment I walked in.  I was not super hungry and came in with a group of 12.  We were seated without issue and got right to it.  Nice eclectic menu and a good mix of vegan, gluten free, and regular food options, all clearly marked.  I decided to share the Crispy brussels sprout chips which were amazing, and the Kale corn sweet onion pakora, which I also really liked.  It does have some slight spice to it, which was fine for me, but just FYI.  The staff were great and everyone else who ordered entrees loved what they got.  I'd come back here with more of an appetite and enjoy myself all over again."}
{"text":"New location, same top quality service and food. Veggie enchiladas. Do it. Carlos, the manager, was great and ensured a quality dining experience for my family. I will be back soon."}
{"text":"3 stars because the food is ALWAYS amazing here and the manager tried his best to make up for the awful service. I came in 5 minutes early for my 10:45 reservation and got seated promptly, I put in my drink order and my friend who came at 10:45 put in hers almost immediately as well. This is where it goes down hill.  15 minutes later from my guest siting I still have no drink in front of me. And the table sat next to us waited close to 10 minutes before even being greeted. It wasn't until 30 minutes after being seated that we even put in our order in. We watched as the table next to us got their food RUSHED from the kitchen because they had small kids, a table for 8 come and go, and a table for 2 walk out because they waited to long for their mimosa to come out (another server brought it out 30 minutes later to them not being there, our server even cracked a joke with one table about the wait) Our appetizers came out WITH our entrée nearly 50 minutes past the time we sat down, brought out by the manager who acted as our waiter the rest of the time. We finally closed out our tab at 12:25.  We both work in the industry, my friend even used to work at this location, and so we know how some things can fall through the cracks but this being the second time something has come up in the last few visits (forgetting our app and bringing it out at the end of our meal, 2 times ago) something needs to change otherwise I'm scared to see the fate of this location once season hits. Honestly, if the server, had even come over to apologized for things taking so long and updated us on the status of our food, instead of avoiding our table completely once she realized we weren't happy I probably wouldn't even be writing the review.   TL;DR The food is 5 stars, always management is great. Service needs MAJOR HELP"}
{"text":"Great little spot! Ate here with my husband and 8 year old last night for dinner. Not a \"kids place\" at all..great for a date.  We are gluten free and the kids menu is horrible for that even though the menu has lots of GF options.  The manager was super accommodating for our daughter's gluten allergy and made her a bacon grilled cheese on GF bread with tomato bisque which was a HUGE hit!  Props to them for being crafty and handling the situation well. Brussels sprouts chips are a MUST, even our non veggie eating kid loved them. The salmon was very good and the fig and goat cheese chicken was perfection. Maurice is a fantastic server.  Very concerned about your enjoyment."}
{"text":"Great patio dining! I enjoyed Easter breakfast with mimosas here and had a fabulous breakfast."}
{"text":"We had our Holiday Party here. Every thing was amazing. The restaurant itself was really cute and had excellent atmosphere. On top of that, the food was fresh and amazing and tasted very healthy. I loved the free range chicken I had and the unlimited glasses of Mango Lemonade that they make there at the restaurant was also amazing! Not to mention the service was great :) Just a really great place all around and I'm glad we had our company party there!"}
{"text":"We are never disappointed with the meals we order or the service.  A nice place to show off old Town to guests."}
{"text":"The Herb Box by far makes the best soups in town. If you are soup aficionado like me, then you will enjoy the wide variety of soups Herb Box has to offer.     Keep up the good work Herb Box!"}
{"text":"Overpriced. Unrefined. Disappointment. To me \"Herb Box\" would invoke fresh, clean, seasonal flavors. This reminded me more of that other restaurant with the name \"Box\" in it.  It seems like it has a lot of potential but they need to drop their prices and drop the deep fryer. It's a lot of fluff without much substance.  Started with the Asparagus and Fennel Frites - aka, beer battered and greasy hunks of vegetable served in a basket with fake newspaper.  Husband had the trout. Said it was good, and the side was a cheesey asparagus casserole. Came with spinach, which again was fried.  I had the Halibut special. Fish was amazing  with a little tapenade on top but the fingerling potatoes were essentially home fries. No veggies on this entree unless you count the olives.   Server was friendly but I should have known to ask the price on the halibut before ordering it. Atmosphere was sophisticated, but the giant flat screen detracted from what could be a really elegant dining experience."}
{"text":"A little pricey for lunch but decent food with good service. I had the Bison Enchiladas. The salad was good but needed pepper. The corn tortillas on the enchiladas were the overpowering taste and drowned out everything else."}
{"text":"Vegan heaven! Many options - loved the sweet potato and corn enchiladas. The chocolate caramel tart is an incredible finish to a great meal. The ambiance is classic and enjoyable for a small group."}
{"text":"What a disappointment.   I looked forward to visiting this restaurant during a recent trip to Scottsdale for a meeting.   We had reservations for ten and was seated promptly on arrival.   Our server was bright and cheery doing her best.   Drinks and appetizers were served within an acceptable time.   That is when it all fell apart.   We waited for over an hour before the entrée was served.   This was a very busy Saturday night  yet there were only three chefs in the kitchen.    Our entrees was finally served.   Oh my!  My meal was cold!!   I dared not send it back since who knows when I would have a new meal.   I had the blacked grilled steak (cold with very little resemblance to a blackened steak barely detectable hint of blackening seasoning, ordered medium rare but served medium plus), sriracha onion rings (very cold and chewy, could not palate) and blistered shishito peppers (cold and incredibly salty).   I will not embarrass myself by suggesting this restaurant again to my associates."}
{"text":"The ambiance is very nice, it does have a good location but the food is not all that. My Salmon was on the dry side, the Arugula salad had no flavor, they just put cheese on it and the pork ribs were ok but not the greatest. It wouldnt be my first or second pick if where to eat again. Sorry guys! But the waitresses were very sweet n nice!"}
{"text":"\"Meh\" food and even worse service. We waited 10+ minutes for someone to even come greet us at our table. I could see our waiter standing behind the bar texting and chatting with friends. The patio is dog friendly which is a major plus but the food is not worth the cost and the device does not stand out."}
{"text":"Kayla poured strong drinks, our server Carlos had awesome suggestions and recommendations. The  brunch set up was really cute and well done, couldn't have asked for a better spot."}
{"text":"excellent food with a very creative menu and really nice and efficient service. totally happy and will be back!"}
{"text":"As somebody not used to the desert heat, I needed a light lunch pre-midday nap.   Really cute, spacious restaurant. I got the Avocado Love (avocado + lime on thinly sliced whole-grain toast topped with an arugula & fennel salad with a sweet and spicy Serrano glaze), which hit the spot.  Next time I'm in the area I'll need to temper to come here for brunch!"}
{"text":"There are two types of people; those who can get past lackluster service, and those who can't. 5-stars for those who can, and 1-star for those who can't. I must appease the average, and therefore award 3 stars.  This last weekend I visited The Herb Box for the first time and truly enjoyed the food. I sampled a few different items off of the menu (stole bites from friends) and was impressed with almost everything. My personal favorite was the Brussel Sprout flatbread I had. Very unique and extremely savory. Nobody had any real complaints about the food quality/quantity/taste at our table of 12. Compliments to the chef.  I don't need to bash the service, as there are already plenty of 1-star reviews that take care of that, and I agree with most of them. Quote of the night (40 minutes after we ordered and still hadn't seen food yet)... Friend: \"Excuse me sir, can we place our order\" Waiter: \"You already have ordered\" Friend: \"Oh, that was so long ago, I forgot\"  I genuinely enjoyed the food, and am thankful I had a group of friends with me that helped occupy the time while we waited. I may be back, but I won't expect City Hall attentiveness."}
{"text":"I've had the pleasure of dining several times at The Herb Box in old Scottsdale.  The most recent visit was only for a drink and appetizers, although I've enjoyed amazing entree's in the past.  (They do offer nice Happy Hour specials during the work week.)   I ordered an appetizer of crisp Brussel Sprout leaves and their version of a Moscow Mule; \"Mellon Mule.\"  The drink was so fresh and cold; yum.  The Brussel Sprout appetizer was TO DIE FOR.  Crispy individual leaves with a light crème sauce and amazing seasoning scattered on the dish.  I was in heaven.  Love, love, love their food.......  But...the reason I'm withholding the 5th star for The Herb Box is the condition of their Ladies Restroom.  The sink needs to be replaced and the beautiful tile on the floor needs a good cleaning.  This part of the restraint smells quite musty."}
{"text":"Wow. Amazing food. I got the sweet potato avocado bowl and it rocked my world. Not huge, so you feel just the right amount of full afterwards. The nosh appetizer had 4 different tasty bittles--also unbelievable!"}
{"text":"Been here twice. First visit I had the Thai ribs. They were great. 2nd trip I tried the Kobe burger. Ordered it medium. Got it extra well done with a burnt bun. No hard feelings I'm still a customer for the ribs.   Place is sort of small but set up pretty nice. Staff is great. Great service. Prices are fair for North Scottsdale. Worth a try!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I had a good date night dinner at The Herb Box. We went on a Friday night and were seated immediately. My fiancé got a beer & we got an order of the Kale, Corn, & Sweet Onion Pakora to start. It actually took quite a while for the appetizer to come out, however after only one bite, we were absolutely hooked! The pakora itself was crunchy & flavorful, and the sweet-hot serrano glaze with the yellow pepper aioli made for a delicious bite. I'd honestly just go back just for this appetizer, and I probably wouldn't share next time! .. We were told that this item is on the happy hour menu as well!  For our main entrées, we got the Thai BBQ Baby Back Ribs + Apple Jicama Slaw and the Grapefruit and Sugar Charred Salmon. Both dish were quite large and filling. My fiancé really enjoyed the ribs; the meat was falling off the bone and the sauce had lots of flavor with a bit of kick. The slaw was the perfect compliment since it was light and had a bit of acidity. There was so much food, he was able to bring home the entire side of Gouda Mac & Cheese (tasty as well).  The Salmon dish unfortunately wasn't as impressive, and it felt like there should have been a sauce to bring everything together. The whole plate was also a bit dry with the quinoa, fennel, snap peas, and pieces of fruit, and it didn't have much flavor. I will say that I had asked for the fish to be cooked well done, and it was cooked perfectly with a beautiful sugar glaze on it.  Overall, this was a 3.75 star experience only because of the dish I had ordered. There were some good flavors in the other dishes, so I would return in the future to try other menu items out."}
{"text":"First and foremost a piece of advice for you: get the MANGO LEMONADE!!  After spending a morning at a painting place in Old Town, we walked over to the Herb Box to get a late lunch. It wasn't too busy so we were promptly greeted & were seated at a table right away. Our drink orders were taken; my friend who normally gets the mango lemonade ordered it, and I'm so glad I decided to follow suite. I'll admit that throughout our meal I may or may not have had 3 glasses of it ... It was so good!  For my meal, I ordered the blackened salmon blt sandwich. I'm not sure that I've ever had bacon with salmon before (it was a little bit on the salty side) but it was pretty good. I'd consider asking them to lightly season the salmon next time (or leave the bacon off) as I preferred the taste of the red pepper aioli that was on the sandwich. The best part however, was probably the side of sweet potato chips. They were the perfect crunchy bites to accompany the sandwich.  Unfortunately, the service wasn't that great. We had to flag down our waitress a couple of times to get drink refills & get us our checks, etc. but I've heard some great brunch recommendations such as the red velvet pancakes & the french toast, so for the food I'll be back."}
{"text":"Really slow for brunch.  Food was completely underwhelming for the price. WAY better brunch options in the area"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this restaurant recommended to us by our golf cart cabbie guy.very pretty great location overlooking the waterfront and some cool art installations.lots of vegetarian options and reasonably priced for scottsdale.nice waiter too.we had the veggie nosh and recommend it."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place walking around Sunday morning. Sexy spot, great food, amazing bloody mary and champagne bar. A must."}
{"text":"This was a great choice for us on our group vacation. Making a reservation was easy and then we were able to move outside on request. Our server Kayla was great and manager Steven checked in to make sure our experience was good. Drinks were not the best part of the meal. I had lentil meatballs which were unique and outstanding. Several of the guys ordered the steak and were happy. Chicken with goat cheese and risotto was nice, too. One of our friends ordered bowl, and we were surprised it was served cold. We loved  the Brussels sprouts app, and coconut lemon cake was good, too.  Ambiance and outdoor seating were fantastic!"}
{"text":"This place is great.  I have been here for brunch and dinner four times and have loved it twice and liked it twice.  I generally love their Steak Salad, and overall, their entrees are priced fairly.   The most recent time we went, though, our server wasn't particularly kind, and the Steak Salad actually wasn't that good.    Their patio is dog friendly, they occasionally have live music, and there's a great view of the waterfront.  So outside of Summer, it's terrific.    I'd say this is a great choice for a date night. I would say it's better for lunch and dinner than it is for breakfast.  ENJOY!"}
{"text":"My new favorite place to eat! The food was amazing! Great flavor in every dish and the atmosphere was comfortably sophisticated."}
{"text":"This place is pretty much pure yummy-ness! The location is fun and the food is creative and delicious. The service was good and friendly. This is an AWESOME afternoon spot to pull up some apps and drinks and watch the world go by."}
{"text":"So this is my second review. This is my favorite place in Scottsdale to take out of towners. I've gotta say I'm really disappointed. Presentation of the food was very sloppy and the potatoes (steak and potatoes mea) was not what I usually get...and I would know because I get the same thing EVERY TIME. Come on guys. You are better than this. Eggs were not cooked correctly and the waiter corrected me rather than assisting. Customer service has declined....wow"}
{"text":"If you ask me to go, I will!  I love the Herb box, it was amazing.  We sat at the bar, (forgot the tenders name) but, it was great.  The service was perfect timing, the food was delicious and I can't wait to frequent here this Fall!    Cheers to the season!"}
{"text":"Ok its about time to review this place.  Ive been here several times, breakfast lunch and dinner.   Every meal was delicious and super flavorful.  You will not find another place with FRESHER organic ingredients.  Cmon they have cage-free chicken salads and street tacos! The combinations they come up with here are amazing, very unique. The chef is a genius.  Also see Gary at the bar for happy hour, he knows his food and is very helpful! Great staff.   My favs:   red pepper hummus, Tzatziki, (homemade yum).  Anything on the brunch menu, pancakes, BLT, Chile burrito."}
{"text":"This place has a great atmosphere. I feel the food was a little too complicated Sometimes less is more. I don't know what it is that was missing I just have eaten there twice and never walked away thinking I had a great meal. I would go there again for a cocktail and the atmosphere I'm not a meal.."}
{"text":"Sangria = BOMB. Weekend happy hour  + Sangria + $5 each = Bomb. Food= delicious & wholesome. Pork tenderloin two thumbs up. Love this place."}
{"text":"This has been a place that we have enjoyed in the past. I had a fantastic bowl last weekend with perfect falafels unfortunately today I went with the short rib enchiladas what a mistake. It was a plate that was 70% shredded napa cabbage and pepitas with 2 tiny short rib enchiladas. For 15$ it just made me sad headed to Frys to grocery shop and grab a sandwich"}
{"text":"Cute restaurant at a great location with fresh local ingredients. The dinner menu has a good selections. It took us awhile to decide since everything look delicious. We decided on kale, corn & sweet onion pakora, Thai BBQ baby back ribs and burger. The pakora was sooooo frigging delicious. The flavor is spot on and the kale is crispy. My husband doesn't usually like kale and he almost licked the plate clean. According to our waiter, the pakora is one of the top three appetizers. The ribs are good and it comes with a side of smoked Gouda Mac & cheese...yummm! The burger was paired with green apple jicama slaw, bacon and Brie- the combination is just perfect! We were stuffed by the end of our meal and we had leftovers. However, we decided to check out the dessert menu. Our waiter recommended the crack pie which is an oatmeal cookie crust with butterscotch sauce with whipped cream on top. The crack pie was delish and we totally devoured the pie. It was surprisingly lighter than it sound and it's the perfect amount of sweetness."}
{"text":"I have been here multiple times and received poor service and/ or been ignored while staff stand around chatting. Love the food but we don't go there anymore."}
{"text":"This company LIES about catering. Comes up in all google searches, but they do not return correspondence. As a result, i don't care how good their food is. I'll never eat here."}
{"text":"This wasn't our first time to The Herb Box. We came back figuring our impression of ordinary food may have been an anomaly, plus it's super convenient for us and we like the location. So it was a huge disappointment this weekend to take some visiting family for dinner...service was terrible, and food was (again) just OK. Don't know if everyone was so frazzled from all the sports events and crowds, or what, but our waiter couldn't have been less attentive. Especially considering how much we spent -- apps, entrees and desserts all around, plus two bottles of wine -- you might expect him to pay a little attention...maybe even refill our wine glasses once or twice...but that was beyond him. We won't bother again."}
{"text":"The Herb Box is by far one of my favorite places for a weekend lunch. It's such an eclectic little jewel inside with fresh and well prepared food. I've sampled a good portion of lunch items, and it's all been good, steak salads, enchiladas, a very odd toast/salad/fried shrimp bonanza of weird.  It's is a very Scottsdale locale so I do somewhat worry that my eyebrows are not waxed enough or my nose straight enough to lounge in the patio by the canal. But, the drinks are good, the service is lovely, and beyond the weird shrimp toast, the food is great!"}
{"text":"Had to take this review down a notch. You'd think a nice place like Herb Box, which serves a lot of wine, would know better than to have red wine sitting out in 90+ degree weather and serving it.   On a recent visit for my birthday for lunch this happened. I was approached by a very snooty woman Manager who stated they serve red wine at room temperature. I said is room temperature at 95 degrees? Ridiculous. My friend who ordered white said her wine was warm even as soon as it was served.   I'm sure Herb Box can pony up for 1 wine fridge to store red wine at the appropriate 55-59 degree recommended temperature. Until then I'd stay away from ordering any wine  here."}
{"text":"Brunch at The HerbBox was overall tasty!! Smoked salmon hash was perfect for a great savory dish. The portobello manchego burger was unfortunately burnt/charred around the edges. The bourbon ginger peach brioche French toast was equivalent to a dense bread pudding - a nice brunch dessert! To top it off, l enjoyed outside seating, great weather while listening to live music!"}
{"text":"Outstanding. Great atmosphere inside and out-- but you can't beat the patio this time of year especially on the weekends when they feature a live acoustic act. We are regulars and joke about being on the Herb Box Meal Plan... but it's because the food in phenomenal and the management and waitstaff are so \"on their game\".  We love Mandi, Eric, Vicki!! So warm and welcoming. Try the salmon or Thai baby back ribs entrée... and I can't do without the white bean chicken chili!!  Don't miss it."}
{"text":"Hey fellow IPA beer lovers, The Herb Box serves an IPA!  Oh, and they have really good food, too.  I especially love the Brown Sugar & Jerk Pork Sliders to start.  Sometimes I eat them as my whole meal.  But this place doesn't just have a good menu, it's full of good people and a great vibe.  The best nights to go are when they have live music playing on the patio.  One of my favorite things to do in Arizona is eat outdoors during the fall and spring months, and this is one of my favorites places to do just that."}
{"text":"Very good experience...good food, good service. Menu is a little limited and the prices high. Nice ambiance and very busy at lunch time. Overall, we liked it and may return. I had the pear and Gorgonzola flatbread that tasted excellent, but for $15 it wasn't enough to take any home. Wifey had a salad and said it was also very good. There are just a lot of really good places in Scottsdale so it needs to be really a standout to get 5 stars."}
{"text":"Went with wife and her parents for dinner last night to Herb Box.  The temp is finally coming down in AZ so sitting outside on the cute patio was an amazing treat.  The food could have been mediocre and we would have had a nice night; however, the food was far from mediocre.  Very delicious.  Started out with the beef carpaccio which was really good but just a little bit too salty.  I could not tell if the salt was added on or just due to the meat but tasted like extra salt was added for seasoning.  For dinner we had the trout (cooked perfectly) with this yummy mac and cheese as a side.  We also had the balsamic beet side.  I am a huge fan of beets and they did a great job with this side.  Definitely recommend giving The Herb Box a try if you are in the North Scottsdale area."}
{"text":"Oh jeez, folks, I wanted to be able to give it 5 stars but I just can't.  It wasn't a 5 star meal or experience.  I'm giving it 4 because our server was nice and the space is welcoming but it really may be closer to a 3.5.   The atmosphere reminds me of Palatte except inside and with full table service not half counter/half table.  (I was actually expecting it to be counter service but was pleasantly surprised.)  Its eclectic and warm but unlike Palatte you can't purchase the chair you are sitting in if you like it.  Its very small and cozy but that means that it fills up quickly if you are planning to dine in. The service was attentive although the entire experience was slower than we thought, especially during the lunch hour.  We were there over an hour!  For someone on a lunch break if may not be the best choice.    We started with the hummus which was just ok- its not nearly as good as the hummus at Fez.  The pita chips it was served with were the thickest and hardest pita chips I've ever eaten in my life.  I wouldn't suggest the hummus, you can get better roasted red pepper hummus at TJ's.  (Oh wait, none of the TJ's here carry it...)  My husband selected the \"Brown Sugar Jerk Pork\" which was not jerk pork at all.  It was pulled pork and the gouda was almost non-existent.  He said he thought he tasted it in a few bites, but never actually saw it. (Then bread turned really soggy and the whole thing fell apart)  My sandwich was a similar experience.  Like Megan, I ordered the Grilled Chicken and Sage Pesto.  All it really tasted like was chicken and goat cheese with the occasional taste of apple.  The pesto was not existent and the only time I realized there was bacon in the sandwich was when I crunched down on the random hard pieces of it.  For the amount of ingredients in the sandwich it was no way near as flavorful as it should have been.  I don't think I'm ready to marry this sandwich at all, but I may consider seeing it casually on the side.  Only if we can date other people though."}
{"text":"The Herb Box is my kind of restaurant.  Everything on their menu looked appealing, and fresh, with lots of veggies.  My friend and I split the mezze and the brussel sprout flatbread sans pancetta.  Both were excellent, but the real star was the flatbread, the combination of cheese and roasted garlic was delectable.  We also had mimosas along with our meal, and with mango instead of orange juice, they felt extra special.    The service here was great, and they had a nice outdoor patio to enjoy your meal on.  The location in the middle of Scottsdale can't be beat either."}
{"text":"Been here several times, so quite puzzled how I never got around to writing a review. Maybe I just assumed everyone knew what a wonderful little place this was and reviews weren't needed.  Well, just in case, this is a wonderful little place. I never have the same thing twice because everything is so tasty. This most recent trip I had their sweet potato tacos, which were full of flavor and texture. They have a lot of vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, and other nutty (or nut-free) dietary choices, but that doesn't phase me. I'm a devoted carnivore, but will happily eat a vegetarian dish if it is well done. And The Herb Box does them well.  Stop in for a nice, light lunch out of the heat and away from the bustle of the Scottsdale Mall. Well worth a trip!"}
{"text":"We had a gift card for the Herb Box and so we decided to go for dinner around 8:00pm. We had no problem getting a table on a Friday night. We ordered plaintain chips and hummus for an appetizer, and then I ordered a bunless burger and the partner ordered a ribeye. A few small complaints:  1) They were out of all of the beers my boyfriend tried to order. He tried 5 different beers and they were all out. Granted, after this going on for 10 minutes, they comped his beer so that was great service.  2) I ordered a meal that was gluten-free/dairy-free, and it still came with their fried asparagus (which is a gluten bomb). They were able to give me a side salad instead, which was delicious, but if I had celiac, i wouldn't have been able to eat the burger that was touching this fried side.  Overall, our waitress made up for these things. She was amazing, so friendly, accommodating and gave us honest advice in terms of what to order on the menu. We will be sure to go back for brunch soon! We heard their brunch atmosphere and food is killer! I recommend the Herb Box!"}
{"text":"I had the highly recommended chicken blt sandwich. It was awful. The chicken was dry,  over cooked and flavorless. Pretty much the worst chicken sandwich I've ever had! Way over priced for the quality too..."}
{"text":"Food here is AWESOME!  Brussel sprout chips were heavenly. Creme brulee was outstanding. Everything we ordered was simply delicious. Only four stars because the service was extremely slow - although our server Grace did her best to keep everyone happy. Waited maybe 20 minutes to get our drinks - and the restaurant was not busy that busy at 7:00 PM.  Maybe adding another bartender would help."}
{"text":"I have dined in, eaten at the bar, and gotten take out from Herb Box, and every single time the food has been awesome. I've tried their veggie wrap, pear flatbread, and sweet potato tacos. The latter were my favorite, and I really wish I could recreate them at home. Reading the reviews about brunch, I am kicking myself that I haven't spent a Sunday morning there yet.  I don't remember anything about our server when we dined in so I guess it wasn't bad, but I was very happy with the service I got at the bar. The bartender was quick and friendly. Just a lovely overall experience.  The decor is nice, and I think the bathrooms are especially noteworthy."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in north Scottsdale... The food is always awesome... Have never had a bad experience here."}
{"text":"The Herb Box is by far my most favorite for Brunch! If visiting, I highly recommend the **Chilaquiles Verde, **Smoked Salmon Hash, Korean Fried Cauliflower, Avocado Love, Short Rib Tacos and the Butternut Squash-Corn Enchiladas!"}
{"text":"I've tried The Herb Box in Old Town Scottsdale for dinner with a friend, but had not been to this location so my fiancé and I decided to come here for a late brunch/lunch after our wedding dance lessons nearby. My fiancé had the chilaquiles and I got the sweet potato avocado bowl with blackened shrimp. Both dishes were delicious. We loved the live music on the weekend and the patio out front. It's located near a few other new restaurants and is just down the street from The Yard so lots of options."}
{"text":"My mom and I decided we wanted to eat somewhere healthy after taking a grueling gym class...only made sense. She had heard that this place only used \"Farm Fresh\" food, so I checked Yelp. Sure enough almost everyone seemed to like the quality.   The inside is cute in my opinion- cute booths, couch chairs, bike art, a bar, and outdoor seating. The servers were super friendly and helpful, but I must admit they took forever to serve us our food. It's definitely the kind of place that you need to order drinks first to better deal with the long waiting period.   The food definitely deserved a full 5 stars (but the wait knocked my review down to 4.5).  After many Yelpers raved about the Butternut Squash and Corn Enchiladas, I decided to order that. OMG sooo good! I'm honestly going to say that it was one of the best dinner dishes I've ordered in a while. It also came with a large portion of salad that had a tasty vinaigrette on it. The green sauce on the enchilada was especially good, but there was some super spicy element I couldn't quite put my finger on. Oh well, a little burn is good once in awhile right? We also ordered the Smoked Trout Beignets with at Red Pepper Aioli, which were amazing. I wish it came with about 10 more on the plate haha. My mom wasn't very hungry and just ordered the Balsamic Tangerine Beets (which were super good), and the Chickpeas w/ Red Quinoa.   Next time I get a chance to come here, I want to indulge in their tapas style cheese menu and order some of their delicious looking cocktails...and sit outside if it's not 108 degrees? All in all, a winner in my book!"}
{"text":"Delicious food Pleasant atmosphere Friendly staff  I really like the convenience of the market."}
{"text":"Great addition to old town dining. Great brunch, lunch, and dinner. Their patio is very nice, as it is at the waterfront. Selection for brunch is small, but spanning. Sandwiches for lunch are eclectic and delicious."}
{"text":"The food is good but the last 3 times I've gone the service is sooooooo slow and so bad that I was embarrassed to have suggested it for dinner. 3 strikes you are out. So sad because this used to be my favorite place to eat."}
{"text":"This was an unexpected stop. My Fiancee and I were waiting on a table at the Breakfast Club for over 40 minutes (noticed that the hostess was seating people who obviously checked in after us or was on her VIP list.) Will not be going back there again after finding this place.  The Herb Box is by far one of the best hidden spots in Old Towne Scottsdale, our server (Meghan) was on point with this being our firt time here, her suggestions and attention to details for our every need was exceptionally on point.  The menu has a wide array of options and we'll have to come back again to try new things.  It's away from the hustle of the common places in Old Towne and well worth giving it a shot.  I am very impress with the service and brunch menu.  When in doubt ans you want a change from trendy (you have to know someonebtobget a seat) places set out your box abd give The Herb Box a try, trust me you won't be disappointed.  We will be returning and suggesting this place to everyone."}
{"text":"The butternut squash enchiladas are a must try. The fish isn't fresh and cooked perfectly. Great drinks and wine list."}
{"text":"adorable place with lots of vegan options"}
{"text":"The folks at The Herb Box have decided to bring their own brand of goodness to Old Town Scottsdale, by opening up a new location, and we couldn't be more excited. Located at Southbridge (7134 E. Stetson Drive) The Herb Box is now open for breakfast, lunch and dinner. For those of you who have never been to their DC Ranch location, you are in for a treat. The Herb Box specializes in some of the best appetizers, sandwiches, enchiladas and flatbreads around and puts their own unique twist on these familiar favorites.  Try the Butternut Squash Corn Enchiladas with tomatillo verde fiesta salad covered in red peppers, cotija and sugared pecans, it is a personal favorite. If a sandwich is what you are in the mood for Schmooze recommends Roasted Turkey, Pear and Arugula or the Blackened Chicken Caesar Wrap. Stressful day, need a time-out, be sure to ask for the progressive wine list featuring over 40 wines by the glass to go along with your lunch.  Speaking of wine (okay so we love Happy Hour) Happy Hour is from 3 - 6 pm, Mon - Sat with $2 off appetizers, $5 glass of wine or $3 microbrews. The Happy Hour specials change daily, but your server will be delighted to give you a take-away menu so that you can plan your afternoons accordingly.  Friday is a can't miss day with $9 Sesame Seared Ahi and $6 Blackberry Mojitos.  Can it get any better then this! Yes, yes it can.... Reverse Happy Hour Fri/Sat from 10 am - 12 noon. Happy, happy dance!  The Herb Box is also your destination for breakfast (served 8 -11 am), where you can have a wonderful breakfast on the front patio with a $5 Bloody Mary or Mimosa.  Feeling adventurous, try a strawberry or blueberry Mimosa to go along with some Cinnamon Buckwheat Pancakes! O-tay! The Chilequiles with egg, corn tortilla and pulled pork are also high on our list of recommendations. Sunday Brunch is also served from 8 am - 3pm for the brunch crowd.  In keeping with the DC Ranch arrangement, The Herb Box also has a market that features the same menu as the regular restaurant as well as boxed lunches ready to grab and go if you find yourself in a hurry."}
{"text":"After a great little brunch and coffee, an expected rainstorm put our comfort in jeopardy.  Our hostess fixed us up with an umbrella from the lost and found and we were able to get back to our car without problem.  Thanks for a great experience!"}
{"text":"I had such high hopes for the Herb Box yesterday. I posted a picture of your Kobe Burger on my FB page telling everyone how excited I was to try it. We were there celebrating my sister's 40th birthday party and twelve women were out in honor of their friend. We assumed it was normal that they let us get settled without taking drink orders, but it was quite awhile until someone came over. We ordered our drinks and got them about 15-20 minutes later (not sure how long it takes to make a diet coke, but ok). When we asked the manager where our server was to take our order, he said that we were busy \"gossiping\" and that's why our order wasn't taken. This was the manager, Paul. Gossiping? Seriously? We are a group of 40 and older women, please calm down Paul. If you'd like us to gossip, I'm sure we can gossip about our bad service from this restaurant. We arrived at 10am, got drinks by 10:45am and by 11:30 we were still waiting for food. I had to go up to the bar twice to get a refill of soda and they screwed up one order of food and completely FORGOT another person's order. It's 12 people, I used to work in a restaurant. There were hardly any other patrons and they staff was too busy giving each other massages at the hostess stand to worry about tending to their customers. We spent $20 a meal plus drinks and a $70 cake, I expect far better service. I will tell everyone I know to skip this place and head to a restaurant that is more worried about tending to it's paying customers than trying to act as if they are too cool to care."}
{"text":"We went as a table of four, and everyone loved their meal. There were two steak dinners done perfectly, a salmon dish and the veggie enchiladas. Each time I visit, I don't try anything on the menu because I'm obsessed with the saucy enchiladas!   The cocktails are colourful and delicious. The Ruby Red Slipper with grapefruit juice is a must!   I am a celiac and I can actually eat dessert here. So my table shared the vegan salted caramel tart - fantastic!   Our server was a lovely lady who ensured that we enjoyed our dinner and experience.   I cannot wait to go back for those enchiladas!"}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place very much, made a reservation and showed up on time. We had to wait for about 15 minutes for a table. We requested one outside and were told they were all reserved. We asked again, and were snubbed by the hostess. We were seated and had to wait 10 more minutes before we were greeted by another server who had noticed our hangry stares. We placed orders with him and were still waiting for waters and drinks 30 minutes after our reservation time. He was nice but seemed overwhelmed.  30 Minutes later we were still waiting on food. We had a flight to catch (Which we told them when we ordered) so we were forced to cancel our orders and leave. We were still charged for the drinks. So many mistakes, so little apologies. Unacceptable."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! We have been loyal patrons of the Herb Box since the Scottsdale/Shea days! We do happy hour at DC Ranch location at least once a week when we are in town! The manager Katija is amazing and the staff is exceptional! The FOOD everything is amazing!!  Thai Rib yum!"}
{"text":"Fresh fare!  This eclectic styled restaurant offers cuisine for all. Vegetarian, vegan, and traditional omnivores will enjoy this place right in the center of old town Scottsdale. The service is spectacular as is the butternut squash enchilada. Never thought it would be so wonderful. There is also a market downstairs that offers a quick bite and desserts that are over the top."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere and friendly bartender. We ate at the bar. I had a shrimp salad was just okay and my partner originally ordered the Thai BBQ pork and it was too spicy and the meat was kind of sticky didn't fall off the bones. We also tried the trout served with a side of corn and it was again okay. Not overly impressed. Not sure if we will be back or not. Drinks were good."}
{"text":"If you haven't had Sunday brunch at the Herb Box then you are missing out. Even more than the food, the bartender, Gary, is truly a local treasure. A weekend without Steak and Eggs and a few too many Irish coffees with Gary just doesn't feel complete. Truly the best part of our weekends!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I work at the mall right across from here and were so delighted to have found it! The first time we got the pita chips and hemp hummus, as well as the smoked Gouda macaroni and cheese. DELISH! The second time we got the sweet potato chips and they were perfectly sweet, salty, and crunchy. Great food, and nice staff. Great place for a quick snack or lunch!"}
{"text":"It's time to come back!  If you've taken a break from Herb Box like we have, the coast is clear to return.  katia is back and now the GM, servers have improved , food is exciting and drink list is strong. We came last week after 2 really dismal customer service experiences last year that lead us to a 6 month \"break\" - last week the food and service were spot on and tonight was just as great.  Shout out to Kristen our bartender- she suggested the cauliflower appetizer that is phenomenal and the hummus trio that comes with a generous helping of crisp veggies and pita. We tried the new lentil meatballs that were surprisingly delicious.  Live music starts up again next week on the patio.   Happy to be back."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick muffin to go. Hostess was very friendly and recommended a couple of muffins I chose the sweet potato. Meh, $3.80 and covered in way too much sugar.  Apparently she can't take payment and had to get the bartender to come over. I gave her $4 and the bartender asked if I wanted change. I said yes as I can't justify tipping on something that someone hands you to go. Don't get me wrong, I was a waitress many years ago and I typically tip 20% or more for good service. She was clearly annoyed and took her time getting my change with only one customer who was eating. Btw, she didn't even smile or greet me when she took my money and told the hostess to get it. This was all before she asked if I wanted my change and of course no smile or thank you when she finally gave me the change back. I will be back as I would like to try their breakfast or lunch sometime soon but management would be wise and inform their staff who handles items to go not ask if they want their change. I find it very presumptuous."}
{"text":"After a long hike on Pinnacle peak mountain and getting lost on the way back...all I was craving was something super fresh, cold and crisp. I'm so happy we stumbled upon this place--such a cute and intimate area too. I ordered the SERRANO-AVOCADO SHRIMP SALAD...and it was exactly what I was hoping for. With crispy shrimp, avocado toasts, arugula, fried fennel pancetta, sweet-hot serrano glaze, lemon-honey vinaigrette...it was so flavorful and filling because of the toast. ($15). My friend had the Edamame Chop Chop Bowl and it was lovely, with roasted edamame & corn salsa, edamame hummus, radish, shredded raw beets, avocado, candied pepitas black quinoa, lemon-honey vinaigrette ($14). We didn't feel too heavy after our meals too which is great after a workout! Service was very fast and friendly. I'm definitely going to be back!"}

{"text":"Very good food. Kinda pricey. Worth it. The fried kale appetizer was absolutely delicious. The service was quick and friendly."}
{"text":"Oh, Herb Box... I have been dreaming about you.  Your yogurt parfait is so delectable, that I have visions of swimming in giant pools of your yogurt, rolling around in your homemade granola, and getting drizzled with your orange-blossom honey.  Hmmm. On second thought, that seems a bit sticky.  Perhaps I'd better just return for another weekend brunch.  To be fair, the Herb Box was not our original destination.  We intended to go to another spot... and spied a never-ending line.  Who wants to wait for breakfast when they have a hungry 4-year-old in tow? Not me!  We ventured onwards, and stumbled upon the Herb Box.  No wait?!  On a Saturday morning at 10?  I was a little skeptical that there must be a reason for the slow morning, but hunger won out and we took our seats.    Our table ordered the amazing yogurt parfait, the BLT, and the cinnamon buckwheat pancakes.  Though they were out of their fresh squeezed oj (juicer malfunction?), they were thoughtful and grabbed a bottle of Naked juice from their market for us.  The BLT was something else... crispy pancetta, ricotta, fried egg, arugula, seriously delicious tomatoes, and a spicy aioli, all sandwiched between some of the freshest bread I've ever eaten.  It was just slightly toasted, and all kinds of delicious.  I love when restaurants take a generally boring sandwich and breathe new life into it.  Well done, Herb Box.    The outdoor patio is beautiful and perfect in this Spring weather, so make sure you venture over before it gets too hot out."}
{"text":"Amazing appetizers and entrees!  Get the cilantro, jalapeño, edamame hummus and the super delicious Cauliflower Steak!"}
{"text":"I helped host a wedding shower at the Herb Box. The food was amazing! I had enchaladas with green chile sauce that were amazing. The service was even better. They were very helpful bringing up decorations for us and helping us bring down decorations and presents to our car.   I would recommend doing an event there. You will enjoy every minute of it!"}
{"text":"I should probably disclose one little detail about how I rate my food - I don't like looking at food that has been through several handling processes. I love it when you can look at a plate or bowl and see what's on/in it. What makes up the sauce? What's in the soup? You should be able to know what you're eating!  For this reason, I really enjoy The Herb Box.   Salads, Sandwiches, Wraps, Flatbreads, variations of hummus and always a kickass soup of the day - pick anything off of the menu and you can't go wrong!  I have recently enjoyed lunch and they've changed some things around the physical space since my last visit - and created a dedicated dining room on one side and moved the market over to the kitchen's space. Great idea and what a perfect opportunity to create more seating!   Food: 5 stars Tzatziki and Pita, Zuccini, Tomato and Corn Soup garnished with Feta Cheese and my beverage was an Aranciata San Pelligrino Soda   Service: 3.5 stars (Efficient and definitely warmed up to me as the meal continued)  Atmosphere: 3.5 stars (Please place a top-weight on the slamming door)  = 4 stars"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite restaurant!  Food was so good I even took pictures of the menu so I would not waste any time upon entering the restaurant.  An absolute must try is the Pear and Gorgonzola flat bread.  The wait staff are awesome and really seem to enjoy being there. The manager Craig is superb and his demeanor for his establishment really shines through his personality.  All in all if I were a multi-millionaire I would put this establishment in my home like Richie Rich!  But, I am not, yet, so I will simply drive the 3 miles to dine in.  It is worth it!"}
{"text":"Great ambiance in the heart of Scottsdale.  We started with the Korean Fried Cauliflower, which was quite tasty.  I got the lentil ricotta *meatballs* + lemony kale-basil pesto which were pretty average.  Others at my table got the butternut squash corn enchiladas harissa-honey glazed pork tenderloin + celeriac puree which were better meals.  All in all, no one raved about their meals but it was a nice ambiance."}
{"text":"Had a reservation for 8:45 pm. The place was pretty empty for a late Saturday night. I will say the food was pretty good. We had the kale and brussel sprouts for appetizer and I also ordered the butternut squash enchiladas which we're sooo good! But unfortunately the service sucked! We waited long for our drinks to come out in the beginning we also wanted to order a second round but by the time she came back we we're already done eating. One of us ordered a bottle of wine and that took longer than the drinks from the bar. We originally ordered 3 appetizers the other being the edamame but they we're out. Which wasn't a big deal. It took a while for the waitress to come back after our second drinks. The manager came out to apologise for the wait and that the edamame was accidentally on the bill and will be removed and it will be a little longer. We waited but only to have them still on there. She apologized and returned with the new bill. We didn't look twice and it wasn't until we we're home that we realized we were still charged. It's not even the money that's a big deal but the principle. I don't know and we were pretty patient at this place consider the service. I'd recommend but kinda hard to."}
{"text":"So many good things about this joint!    First and foremost, all the Scottsdale snobs perpetrating a fraud seem to have made their way over to Romper Room Pizza across the way.  This is really great news as their entitled brat kids are with them over there too.  Yeah!  OK now that I got that off my chest...   The food is fantastic!  I love their simple Grow Happy Salad.  It is hard to believe they can get so many different veggies into that bowl and the dressing is honestly one of the best around.  Next ask for the Charcuterie and Cheese board \"score sheet\" and order up!  Be sure to ask for extra cornichons and fried capers on the side... delish!    You will be too full to eat anything else at this point but you need to power through the pain and keep going... I promise you, any of the flatbreads will knock your socks off! But take a leap of faith and go with the Brussel Sprout Pancetta... Once you have brussels this way, you are gonna want to go back to Illinois and smack your Momma for making you eat them boiled when you were a child (oh wait, that is what I wanted to do, you can go to where ever you are from and smack her).  Finally, Sunday brunch is awesome out on the deck and you can get good and s**t faced on $5 bloodies and maomosa's to try and drown your sorrow that you have to go back to work tomorrow!  See you on the patio.. Just leave your kids at the sitter, no chicken nuggets to be seen here.  Oh wait... just remembered one other can't miss, the crispy fingerling potates with red pepper aoili!  SOOOO YUMMY!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were visiting Scottsdale this past weekend and had an amazing lunch at The Herb Box!    I am gluten & dairy free and usually have very few things to choose from on a menu, or I'm offered a piece of very plain, bland chicken or fish with steamed veggies.  This was not the case at The Herb Box!!  Here is a description of what we enjoyed: crisp brussel sprout chips with a vegan yellow pepper aioli (will definitely recreate at home!!), kale, corn & sweet onion pakora with sweet, hot serrano glaze & vegan aioli, grapefruit and sugar charred salmon with snap peas, fennel, blackberries, pistachios, oranges, charred onions, black quinoa & snow pea shoots and a kobe beef burger for my husband with bacon, brie, apple-jicama-watercress slaw & sweet potato chips, $5 mimosas & bloody marys, and fantastic service to boot! And yes, it was all as good as it sounds...I was in Heaven!!    To find a restaurant that has such spectacular & innovative allergy-friendly dishes is very rare and so appreciated!!  If ever in Scottsdale again, we will definitely return!  I highly recommend The Herb Box for anyone who enjoys delicious food with an innovative twist!  *Don't let the unusualness of the pakora deter you from ordering it!  I was on the fence but took the plunge and could have eaten the whole plate myself easily!!"}
{"text":"Stale chicken that was probably yesterday's chicken that was re-heated and placed in my salad. It was as hard as plastic. Could be hit or miss, but definitely miss for me and inconsistent with freshness."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to go here for some time and since my grandmother and aunt were in from out of town, I thought it might be a great place for lunch. Cute place, but service was off and food was \"fine.\" We ordered the chicken sandwich, avocado toast, a salad and the squash enchiladas. The only thing that stood out to any of us were the sweet potato chips that came with the sandwich. They were great.   We actually commented that we were glad we were not working that day...lunch took almost 2 hours. Maybe just a bad day???  Ironically, we headed to the coffee shop downstairs and had a totally different experience...that was awesome. Coffee, sweets and service could not have been better.   Skip the restaurant upstairs and go for coffee and dessert at the cafe."}
{"text":"I got them to sit me and pour my a tea, waited 20 something minutes for someone to come take my order. At which time my lunch break was over...so much for eating. I just walked out. Terrible, terrible customer service...not suitable for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"Great place fresh, creative, Farm to Table but not pretentious! I don't eat red meats/pork. The Butternut squash w cotija cheese enchiladas topped w Tomatilla sauce was so delicious!"}
{"text":"A great dinner today.  I'm not a vegetarian but my dinner was perfect. Such a pleasant atmosphere there. Staff were very courtesy and helpful. Our waitress had to explain to me some of the dishes since they were new to me. My experience was great. Definitely we will be going back to enjoy the food again....soon !!  Thank you to the whole staff especially our waitress."}
{"text":"Great food and great service love the salads and short rib enchiladas! They're salads are so yummy definitely recommend"}
{"text":"I love it anytime I can grab a yummy salad.  And I did right here!  The grilled chicken, with bacon, avacado, gouda cheese with house dressing was to die for!    It's definitely a cool place with cool people."}
{"text":"What a gem.  We stopped in for lunch today and the place is great!  Service, atmosphere and food were all on point.  We tried the hummus (I've had a lot of hummus at a lot of places and this was one of the best), sweet potato bowl (great flavor but tame your expectation on size) and the avocado chicken salad (which was awesome).  Looking forward to visiting this place again."}
{"text":"I love the salmon BLT sandwich, the salmon is so tender and juicy and the sweet potato chips compliment it very well. Great service and great location! I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Came in on a whim on Mother's Day. I was afraid they would be packed but they seated us straight away. The patio is very nice and has the only actually herbs I saw. There were fake plants on the tables. I think it would have been nice if there were real herbs or something. It would be more fitting to the namesake.   The service was spot on.   Bloody Mary's were only $5. They have a great amount of spice and seasoning. Ordered the avocado love (4.5 stars). I thought it was going to be much more avocado forward but the fennel and arugula really elevated the taste. There was something sticky on top so I kind of wish it came with a wipe. The smoked salmon hash (3.5 stars) was just ok. There was a lot of kind of crispy smoked salmon that wasn't my fav. The chilaquiles (4 stars) were not exactly normal chilaquiles. It was kind of a pulled pork stew you put into the tortillas with egg. Good verde sauce!"}
{"text":"YUM!  My husband and I popped in here last minute one evening for dinner.  We didn't know exactly what to expect, but we were pleasantly surprised!  We had a fantastic meal and look forward to going back.  We started with the crab dip appetizer.  It is a cold crab dip and is heavy on cilantro (which we love, I know not everyone does).  Served with plantain chips - delicious! I think my husband would have licked the bowl if we weren't in public. Okay, I would have too.   I ordered the grapefruit and sugar crusted salmon over black quinoa.  Delicious!  My husband had the thai ribs with smoked gouda mac and cheese.  The ribs were FULL of flavor and I kept stealing bites of the mac and cheese.    We finished up with the \"Oh my....crack pie.\"  A tasty oatmeal cookie pie with whipped cream.  We were so full, but kept eating because it was SO good. I think that for two glasses of wine and all of the food mentioned above, the tab was around $85.  Probably a little more than we planned on spending for a last minute stop, but we were so full and happy, it was worth it.   It is worth noting that the menu does have some diverse options.  There are some plates geared towards the vegan/vegetarian crowd.  And there are several tasty options for the gluten free group as well.   Our waitress was great and gave us some good suggestions since it was our first time there.  We hope to be able to stop in a try brunch soon. Really excited to find this option out by the Grayhawk/DC Ranch area."}
{"text":"I get coffee at the Herb Box every day before I start my long day. I will not go anywhere else,I Love Herb Box Coffee. Try the sugar free white chocolate latte."}
{"text":"The Herb Box Scottsdale is now in what was the Estate House Restaurant in Old Town area. The food is casual yet sublime. The ambiance at the Scottsdale location is fantastic and gives competition to Olive and Ivy any day!"}
{"text":"The Herb Box wowed this out-of-towner! Recently I was visiting some old friends in Phoenix and we had happy hour here. We sat outside on the patio and it couldn't have been more gorgeous. Nice comfy seats with umbrellas, picturesque, with a bubbling fountain nearby and plenty of greenery.  The food was sublime for the most part. The waiter - super friendly and helpful - recommended the Avocado Love and we ordered two of those. I almost went back the next day just to get it. It was like an amazing salad bruschetta. My BF, a carnivore who makes it a point of not eating anything green, loved it. We also got the crab and cilantro dip. I loved the combination of cheesy crab and citrus and cilantro, though I would have liked the plaintain chips to be a big larger and more substantial (it was hard to pick up the dip with the flimsy scraps of chips). We also got the brisket sliders - looked awesome, the taste was solid but nothing to write home about - and the tacos (I didn't try those). The drinks were also delicious, especially the berry mojito.  If I could have come back for dinner, I would have tried their vegetarian enchiladas. Next time!"}
{"text":"Rude management. The food is decent but the service unpredictable with waitresses and managers blaming each other for their mistakes."}
{"text":"This was my favorite restaurant during my most recent visit to Phoenix.  It's a cozy restaurant with a relaxing atmosphere.  Our group got there right when they opened so we beat the lunch crowd.    Our server was fantastic.  She was on the ball with everything, very accommodating, and always checked up on us at the right time.   My group ordered a vegan tray as a starter.  It had brussels sprout chips, edamame, deep fried cauliflower w/ quinoa, and something with kale...I didn't try that one.    I ordered a chicken pesto sandwich.  The server said that's a good sandwich, and she was right!  The piece of chicken was pretty thick, a think layer of pesto with tomatoes, greens, and the best part goat cheese!  The goat cheese was so creamy and really made the sandwich pop!  My mouth is watering just thinking about it."}
{"text":"Nicest people ever work here.  Helped us with our luggage. Great service with a smile. The avocado love was piled high with arugala and super yummy with eggs on top. Lovely patio with big trees and umbrellas for coverage. Happening area with lots of people, bikes, segways, events and, of course, dogs."}
{"text":"I love this place! Its my new favorite restaurant! Everything is so fresh and so good..I had the hummus to start with a friend and they had the burger which was awesome and I had the chicken sandwich which was pretty good. Sweet Potato Chips were amazing and the iced green tea was really good! Only downfall was the server could have been nicer but oh well maybe next time."}
{"text":"We tried this restaurant out based on previous Yelp reviews. Wow! This restaurant has fantastic ambiance, outdoor dining options and excellent service! The menu is fabulous and the food was spectacular! The prices and portions were reasonable!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is a great alternative to the usual options in downtown scottsdale.  There is a very extensive menu with some pretty bold options.  The actual meal was very delicious, and the decor was amazing.  With that being said I will deduct a star for mediocre service.  I couldn't help but feel was though our waiter was in a hurry to serve, no smiles were given.  The beautiful people of scottsdale all were packed in, so its a cool place if you are looking to people watch,(my father would love it.)"}
{"text":"Took forever to get service. Finally had to go ask for help.  No one was there except 3 other tables so i don't know how they didn't see us. Anyway, too expensive and didn't think the quality of food was worth it.  I got the pork belly sliders.  Im guessing they covered it with pickled beets because the actual pork belly was non existent. The slaw on the side was so sour,  that I took one bite and couldn't eat any more.  They over cooked my husband's burger. My stepson's mac and cheese looked pretty good though. Our six year old daughter got a cheese quesadilla and it was still $8 and we found out the pricey kids meals didn't even come with a drink when we got the bill. $11.50 for a kids meal. Save your money. So many other good places to go nearby."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar this weekend and had brunch with a friend.. Again the food and service didn't disappoint!! We shared the chilliquiles and a roasted corn pizza.. The bartender, Matthew, was totally awesome, introducing us to their kale mimosa.. SO GOOD!!!   Also I had a bloody mary that had a great smokey flavor, good form. It was my first time sitting up at the bar and I will definitely do that again!  Game was on too which was cool. :)"}
{"text":"Portions. Small!  Haha look at this $7 banana bread. Can you say rip off? Will never eat here, overrated and overpriced ."}
{"text":"This place was ok.  My salad was edible and our waiter was nice and efficient.  I did not like the smell inside of the restaurant.  It kind of smelled like sewage...not sure what that's all about.  I will not be back.  There are tons of great places to eat in central Phoenix and this was just mediocre."}
{"text":"OK, I loved the Herb Box!  The location on Shea had the most wonderful Staff!  But this location?  Meh.  It would be SOOO easy for them to obtain five (5) stars if they gave a damn about the service.  They have great food for an acceptable price, and the atmosphere is absolutely divine.  But the service here sucks, and [looking over my shoulders] they have no excuse."}
{"text":"My mother and I had a lovely lunch here. We started with the crab dip which was accompanied with crispy plantains...so good! I would take those plantains over potato chips any day and don't even need a dip.  I had the Cilantro-Serrano Shrimp served with arugula and avocado cream multi grain toast. It was a little sweet for me, but overall good. The shrimp had a perfect spice and were cooked to perfection.  My mother ordered the butternut squash corn enchiladas and loved them! It's great that they were served with a beautiful salad l.  The atmosphere was perfect. The weather was perfect for sitting outside and who doesn't love live music!?!  My only real critique is that the service was slow. We didn't have our drink order taken for about 5 minutes and then the food order was slow as well.  Overall, yummy food and great atmosphere."}
{"text":"The waiter was great, answers any questions or concerns we had. The food was delicious! Had the lemon dessert and it was amazing!"}
{"text":"First off, love the design of this place, really beautiful, natural decor that matches this farm to table restaurant. The fare is fairly priced and the portions we received were generous. Love places like this that serve high quality food at an affordable price to the masses.   Our waitress, Vera, was extremely helpful, happy to help us with any questions that we had, quite knowledgeable about the menu and healthy food in general.  My bistro steak salad was great!  We didn't love the crab dip, however, it was taken off our bill without us saying a word.   Would highly recommend and we will return when we are back in Scottsdale.  A must eat at restaurant."}
{"text":"Food and drinks were exceptional, but the service was less than stellar. Our server was responsible for 8 tables which means a 60 minute experience became 150 minutes, not reasonable for a Saturday evening."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious and amazing!!! We came here for brunch and the food was fabulous. The service was great and the patio was a great space even in the 110 degree weather. They were accommodating to my vegetarian request, which is always a plus! I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Delicious! This place was so good and had many decently health options. I went for lunch to celebrate a co-workers birthday and will definitely be back. Interested to see what their dinner menu is like.  I also love the looks of this place, super cute and a really nice patio too."}
{"text":"It was okay. The food came late and the drinks were mixed up. It's okay if you want to spend $15 on a salad with mostly greens and not much else. Overly priced and the rib eye us full of fat!"}
{"text":"The worst Christmas decorations. Food ok we go for the beautiful location  on the canal outdoor seating awesome. Indoors cold & dull. Too bad it could be it great."}
{"text":"I came in the Market Place to check out the saturday morning \"farmer's market\" and was starving so I hit up the Herb Box for a little breakfast to go. It is a really pretty restaurant and the display/takeout area was clean and organized but all I needed was food and I needed it in my stomach 20 minutes ago. I didn't even glance at the menu, just pointed at a slice of quiche in the display case and slid $5 across the counter. And yes, I may have pretended that I was going to \"go home and eat it\" thus refusing a fork and napkins, but I ate it cold, with my hands, sitting on a bench and it was just okay.   Yeah I get those aren't the greatest conditions to savor food. it was in fact, an artichoke, sun-dried tomato and goat cheese quiche and it was easily a 4\" wide slice which is huge (for food...). It just didn't really have any flavor and the crust was too thick on the bottom and too crumbly up at the top (and extra buttery).   Now I will say that alongside the quiche in the display case were some of the most outrageously gorgeous cupcakes I have ever seen in my life. A blood red velvet cupcake with thick glossy white frosting that was piled at least 3\" high. And a chocolate cupcake with what looked like creamy chocolate mousse on top. If for some reason I'm ever back in this area I will absolutely sit down and have a meal or 50 cupcakes. But probably not the quiche."}
{"text":"The in-laws, my fiance, and I came here after eating at Barrio Queen. We were originally going to go to Classic Cakes but they were temporarily closed for twenty minutes and we didn't want to wait around. Honestly, we regret we didn't because the dessert selection at The Herb Box just didn't look as appetizing as the lemon bars over at Classic Cakes.  We decided to get a whole bunch of stuff--Red Velvet something, Pink Champagne Cake, Blackberry Pie, and what they called \"Crack Pie.\" The guy who was working there said that it was pretty equivalent to what a \"Sugar Pie\" was down in the south. I'm an original New Yorker, so I had no idea what that meant. He mentioned Pecans so I guess there's that. My fiance also picked up a Blackberry Italian Soda.   Nothing was particularly memorable nor delicious. It seems that I'm the outlier for this place, but it looks like all the good reviews are based off the actual food here, not the desserts. The Blackberry Italian Soda was decently made, but wasn't really that satisfying. The crack pie did indeed have a pecan-y taste to it, but again, it was just really overpoweringly sweet. Crust was A-OK at best. Honestly, the champagne cake was the most disappointing. I thought champagne cakes were supposed to be super airy; am I wrong? Both the cake and icing were quite dense and again, very sweet.   Their saving grace was the guy who was working there. He was very patient with us as we ordered pretty much one of everything and got it all to-go. He was also very helpful in general.  tl;dr really just meh, at least when it comes to desserts. Blackberry Italian Soda was decent. Champagne cake was highly disappointing."}
{"text":"Our waiter was friendly and accommodating and we had great service.  I told the waiter that I'm vegan and asked if they could make their KOREAN FRIED CAULIFLOWER, vegan for me and he said no problem.  I also ordered the CRISP BRUSSELS SPROUT CHIPS which were also amazing!  My hubby ordered the burger & said that he like his meal as well.  He even ate some of my dishes and liked them a lot.  We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Awesome. Great local food. Creative menu. The knosh is a great healthy side dish.   The salmon blt is my favorite lunch dish in the valley."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst service! I don't usually write poor reviews but this was horrible!!!! Sub par food to boot!!! Do not recommend!!! Too many other choices in Scottsdale, do not waste your time or money!!!"}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about the Herb Box. I live really close by so I tried doing some takeout from the little Market... I ordered the Chicken Pesto Sandwich (which was good but a little hard to eat, being so big) and the Tuna Sandwich (both $12 for myself and the Bf). I can see the Chicken Pesto costing that much but wasn't too satisfied with the Tuna. I did like how they had a little selection of wine and the concept of the Market making it an easy one spot stop for dinner or lunch. That being said I have also dined at the restaurant (twice at the DC Ranch location and once off Shea). A few of the items I've had: *Machaca Tacos- were okay, wished the meat would have been a bit more tender *Sunflower salad- I actually really liked and would order again. *Salmon Cakes- again okay and might try and give them another go in the future.  All in all, I really do like the entire concept of The Herb Box and will go again but not crazy about it."}
{"text":"Thanks to Yelp reviews, my hubby and I learned about the Herb Box in advance of our visit to Scottsdale earlier this month and had lunch there one day before visiting the Desert Botanical Garden.  We both loved the Herb Box, although at first my hubby was concerned that he was the only guy except for our remarkably good and friendly server, Christopher, among a sea of \"ladies who lunch\".  We arrived early, about 11:30 and as there was only one other person in the (Shea) Herb Box we seated ourselves at a four top right by the window.  Christopher, who knew what was to follow that we did not which was a nearly full house by 12:10, could have asked us to move to a two top but he didn't.   We apologized to him later as the crowds started to arrive for taking up a table for four and said next time we'd know better.  But he was most gracious saying something like \"no worries, you probably made my job easier\".  Indicative of the friendly service he delivered throughout the meal.  We split an order of remarkably good enchiladas that were filled with butternut squash and corn and cheese (queso anejo) and served with a perfectly spicy tomatillo sauce.  Along with a side order of yummy apple, frisee slaw that included little cubes of swiss cheese, cranberries (or was it pomegranate seeds that day?) and cashew pieces, it was a delightful meal.    We didn't have a means to keep take out cool in our warm car while we went to the Garden or we would have taken out dessert for later as well as other savory dishes for dinner at the resort villa unit where we were staying.  Next time we're in Scottsdale we'll arrange it so we can enjoy several more meals from The Herb Box as there were many items on the menu and being served to the tables around us that looked great!  Note for the wheelchair accessible listing that shows on the Yelp review page, the eating space is accessible through one of the entry doors, but we're very aware of accessibility these days and  if you use a wheelchair be prepared that the bathroom is not accessible."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. I have a gluten intolerance... I get very sick if I eat even traces of gluten. This place does such a good job of not cross contaminating the food. Plus, everything tastes amazing! I never leave feeling bloated and gross. I feel leaving satisfied and happy. It's my go to place for a good healthy meal, without having to worry about gluten!!"}
{"text":"What a great experience we had at the Herb Box. A group of 12 of us recently hiked Pinnacle Peak, I called the Herb Box immediately after our hike and made a lunch reservation. Well deserved after a big hike! The manager and wait staff made us feel so welcome. A lovely table was awaiting us on the patio and they were so accommodating. And the food? Delicious! Don't leave without trying the sweet potato fries. We all decided that next time we needed to save room for dessert. Thank you Herb Box for a wonderful experience. We will be back!"}
{"text":"This place was great. The atmosphere is very open and airy and clean, the food came quickly and the service was friendly. We did get asked twice within a 2 minute period (right after we got our food) if the food was good, but one of the servers was training so it was probably just practice. I ordered the Coconut Shrimp Salad, which was wonderful except the Shrimp were way over cooked (almost burnt) and really not palatable. I would definitely give them another shot though because everything else was so good. My guy ordered a wrap and mowed through half of it there and the other half shortly after we left and had no complaints, I tried the wrap too and it was very tasty and crisp. There is an awesome little market extension to this place that is also definitely worth checking out, and save room after you eat if you do go, because like us, you will be VERY tempted to try one of the delicious treats inside! Unfortunately for us we didn't save room, so I guess we'll just have to go back again soon!"}
{"text":"If I could give the herb box 10 stars I would!! I took a short trip to Phoenix and we stopped by here thanks to then fairly good reviews I saw on Yelp, and I'm SO GLAD I DID!   We actually ate inside the market which I'm not sure if people do because we were not aware there was a whole other seating area but it was great. We made sure to order off the menu not the food they had on display. I ordered soba noodles with broccoli zucchini and a few other veggies (I ordered it without the hard boiled egg). My cousin ordered the avocado love I believe which was avocado toast with arugula piled on top.   When we finally tried our meals we were very disappointed that we didn't live in Phoenix the food was AMAZING! It was all very fresh, home grown ingredients and it was very obvious in the flavors. Im not a fan of avocado but I'd eat that avocado toast all day!  We needed to try more so we shared a bowl of tomato basil and artichoke soup which was also SO GOOD! We even took some sweet potato chips to go and gave them to family as a little something from Phoenix and everyone wanted more!   Be sure to stop by!! You won't regret it!!"}
{"text":"Popped into this new addition to the uptown culinary scene last night with the hubs. What a delightful place with delightful and quirky flavor combos. The skinny margaritas were light and refreshing and had a surprising kick. The butternut squash enchiladas were simply delicious. I'll probably never order anything else when I return....which will be many more times. Hubs had the steak salad. He says it was good but didn't care the lashings of sauce on the meat. It was not crowded and there were a number of happy kids there. Atmosphere was friendly. I highly recommend The Herb Box!"}
{"text":"We played this restaurant smart and booked a 5:30pm dinner reservation on Opentable.com.  Surprisingly there was only 2 other couples in the restaurant. We were immediately seated and given menus. Our waitress Nicole was super nice and cordial. We ordered the pear Gorgonzola flat bread and 2 entree's. As expected the entire meal was fresh tasting, healthy and beautifully presented. My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed this healthy delicious meal. Our bill was $65 before tip. Very reasonable for DC Ranch Scottsdale. I don't understand some of the negative remarks on Yelp. Totally unsubstantiated in my opinion. My recommendation is to make reservations, as they do get busy during peak hours, and be positive with an open mind!  You shouldn't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Definitely a very nice place with good food options, but I think a little too expensive for mediocre portion sizes. It is cute and is in Old Town, so that's probably why the prices go up, but still. I seem to end up here for work lunches.  - Portabella burger with a side salad (an expensive side salad I might add, practically the cost of ordering the house salad but 1/3 of the size). It was fine, not mind blowing, but not terrible either. The mushroom was a little on the chewy side, and I wish they had put more of the flavorful aioli on it because the bun was very thick (and so much less flavorful). - Happy Salad as a Wrap: Definitely one of the better vegetarian entree options on the menu for a reasonable price ($9). It's a basic vegetarian salad (lettuce, tomato, cucumber) dressed and wrapped into a yummy tortilla, served with their sweet potato chips. - Cauliflower Lentil Bowl: Offensively tiny. For $13 you get 4 cauliflower florets and about 1/4 to 1/2 cup of lentils/quinoa. The flavors are extremely good (great mix of salty, savory, and sweet), but it was so tiny and not filling.   If you come and want a reasonably priced meal with meal-sized portions, it's best to stick with the sandwiches."}
{"text":"LOVE this place!!!  Everything I've had is good..from the sunflower market salad w/grilled chicken, to the bbq chicken pizza, to the tortilla soup, to the squash enchiladas.  Their pasty chef makes a mean peanut butter cookie and my favorite are \"usually\" oatmeal raisin...I think I finally found a new cookie!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant, excellent food and terrific atmosphere.  Sitting outside on a beautiful night watching the sun go down with live music and a terrific meal is hard to beat.  The bar is located centrally and allows for you to sit inside or out.  The food is excellent.  My only knock on this restaurant is that it is a bit pricey.  Because of that, we enjoy the Herb Box as a special occasion restaurant."}
{"text":"Delicious sweet potato tacos but the service was awful. We were there for brunch today and our waitress never checked in with us once after taking our order. No butter or jam for toast. Never refilled our coffee. Many servers just walking around doing nothing."}
{"text":"The most disgusting food with a cockroach problem....we had a roach crawl out of our tea pot. As for the food it was sour...we got the runs immediately after eating there"}
{"text":"I came here for a pre dinner drink before going to FnB.  My date and I went in and went straight to the bar.  I'm not going to bitch because I wasn't greeted by anyone, I could care less.  We sat at the bar, and sat, and sat.  Numerous servers walked by with no type of acknowledgment or to even maybe get the bartender.     The bartender finally came and showed no interest in serving us.  After enjoying our drinks I asked to close out my tab.  That took 20 minutes.  It was only my company and myself and two other patrons at the bar.  I gave my card as soon as he brought the check.  It actually took so long that I left my friend at the bar to sign my name so I could run down and go to FnB so they didn't think I was bailing on my reservation.     Now I'm not being overly sensitive, I'm just pointing out that this was piss poor service and exactly opposite of how the hospitality business should be run.  Based on my experience on just trying to get a drink, I have no desire to actually come here and try the food."}
{"text":"The salmon was delicious as was the chefs plate appetizer of hummus & pita, but the waiter left something to be desired. He kept trying to clear our table before we were finished with each course and the wine glass was filthy. Sitting out on the patio was really nice in the evening. I'd give it another try."}
{"text":"Ate a light lunch here one afternoon and ate breakfast on another day.  Both times, we sat outside along the sidewalk.    For lunch, I had their crisp falafel bites.  Several crispy-fried \"bites\" were served with pita bread and a nice salad.  Breakfast a few days later was fantastic.  Good coffee, freshly-squeezed orange juice, and delicious, thickly-sliced and toasted banana bread.  To top that off, a huge bowl of oatmeal with raw sugar and few sliced strawberries.  I would have loved my oatmeal had there been many more sliced strawberries on it because they were the perfect topping.   The service seems rather so-so."}
{"text":"The food at this restaurant is simply delightful in presentation, smells and taste.   I went to this location as part of a UYE hosted by Deb L., went with my best Sara V and was looking forward to trying this place after reading the many five star accolades and reviews of this restaurant. I do not give out five stars often but if I was to base it on the atmosphere, and decoration of this restaurant, it would be five stars BUT five stars are for the food and the food is a five star delight.   Sara V and I decided to share two apps and split an entree. We ordered the Petite Grilled Fromage (capicola, seahive cheddar, salad rouge) and the Proscuitto Wrapped Shrimp (blackberry glaze + spicy soy mustard), followed by a split order of the Thai BBQ Baby Back Ribs and Green Apple Slaw with jicama & watercress + smoked gouda mac-n-cheese. The petite fromage was delicious and the salad rouge had so many flavors with the avocado, and the golden raisins. It was a party of flavors with every chew and the melted cheddar enveloped the brioche bread just right, it was heaven. And the OMG moment came from the Proscuitto Wrapped Shrimp, served on a skewer, the blackberry glaze complemented the salad served with the shrimp, and the glaze provided the sweet with tangy of the spicy soy mustard, there were so many flavors to enjoy that it was a \"as good as it gets\" moment!   Our entree was another winner with BBQ baby back ribs, the flavors derived from the the sauce was just delicious, it complemented well with the apple slaw. I think the disappointment with our entree was the smoked gouda mac-n-cheese because I hardly could taste the gouda, and panko bread crumb topping didn't help the dish or do justice, it was quite bland and out of place for a flavorful dish.   Our party was treated to a dessert sweet board of goodies courtesy of the Herb box, on this confectionary tray was a red velvet cupcake, a fig apple bundt cake, a rootbeer cupcake, a passionfruit type cake and a chocolate type pastry. The Red velvet cupcake topping was yummy but the cupcake itself was moist somewhat but not throughout, the passionfruit had a good outer shell, but my favorite sweet treat was the fig apple cake, it reminded me of strudel.   Overall, i enjoyed my UYE dinner, making new friends. And I did love the food made by Becky (the chef/owner). our appetizers and entree was delicious and I look forward to coming back for lunch/dinner and hopefully Sunday brunch."}
{"text":"What a cute charming place full of good gourmet things we found in Old Scottsdale!  We really wanted beverages, but longingly eyed the fresh scratch-made salads and sandwiches that were on display.    My resolve to not eat something sweet just about dissolved when they brought out a tray of fresh-baked muffins from the back.  Oh, my!  My friend adores Kombucha and on our visit to Phoenix she schooled me.  Loaded with natural probiotics, Kombucha is a fermented beverage that's really good for you and I'm some states is classified as alcoholic due to the fermentation.  She let me try the blue raspberry selection she found here and I didn't think it tasted fermented or alcoholic at all.  It was pretty Good!  This was a great place to sit, relax and people-watch.  We met a lady with a sweet elderly dog who reminded my of a grandma.  Curly white hair and all - LOL! We had a great time, giggling, making friends and enjoying the sunshine!"}
{"text":"Great food and the outside patio was amazing! Tony was our server and he did a great job, he recommended the salmon hash. It was delicious! I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Came in here for lunch with my husband. Friendly quick service and the food is excellent. All items on menu are nitrate free hormone free!  Shared the fried kale chips, husband ordered the steak sandwich & I got the Serrano shrimp salad yummy !!!!!!!"}
{"text":"First of all let me say the service was impeccable. I felt like I was being catered too. We arrived for happy hour and the specials were an awesome bargain. I had a glass of sangria for $5 and then ordered the fried cauliflower with peas and quinoa for $5. Then for my entree ordered the Kobe slider burger for $8. The cauliflower was excellent and the accompaniments were a nice touch.   The burger was good. Overall it was great for the money, the food was healthy, and the view of the canal would be tough to beat. Would definitely recommend the place."}
{"text":"Had lunch there today. Very over priced. Meal came to $60. We had two mains a child's meal chips and a dessert.   We both had the beef short rib enchiladas. Two tiny tiny enchiladas were served with over fessed salad. While I am not a large eater by any means these were really skimpy.  The child's meal was a generous serving. I wanted to eat off their plate to get enough.   The dessert was sad. Plated very nicely but the taste was not there  the pear almond cake was overwhelmed by the spices in the cake. There was absolutely not pear taste or almond taste. Very sad   Won't be going back"}
{"text":"Literally so BOMB. I had the charred salmon and it was life changing. A little pricey but I'd come back for sure. Super cute decor, good cocktails, and delicious food. My husband had the steak and he loved it too."}
{"text":"I was excited to checkout The Herb Box after hearing great things from many friends. Unfortunately the service did not live up to my expectations at the DC ranch location. We were seated promptly but it took a long time for a server to take our drink order and over 45 minutes to get our food. Keep in mind it was 2:30pm and the place was not busy. Our server felt bad and kept apologizing. Thankfully the short rib tacos were great but this won't be a location we will be coming back to anytime soon."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere,  great food but no where near their worth what the charge! I ordered a Baja bowl and one drink and it cost me $30 and I walked out hungry! My food was served in a large bowl but not even near half full. I was starting get to think I had ordered from a kids menu. My drink (mule) was $11 and one of the smallest I have ever had. If you don't mind spending a lot of money and not getting much out of it, good place.  Was good but what a waste of money!"}
{"text":"We stopped in here to meet friends for an appetizer and drink on Saturday because it was gorgeous outside and the Herb Box has a lovely patio!! The bartenders were super friendly and willing to whip up any concoction that wanted.   I started with a lemon and basil martini that was absolutely DELISH. Any drink with basil wins my heart. Next, we nibbled on their Kale, Corn, and Sweet Onion Pakora. Holy heaven! This was a recommendation from their bartender because they were out of my FAVORITE cilantro-lime crab dip {...still sad about this! It is THE best!}. But the Kale appetizer had the most amazing flavors and was crisped to perfection. I would most definitely get it again!  I also have to note their amazing customer service. They were super busy the day we were in and the bartender forgot to place our appetizer order, SO he brought us a round of yummy shots (that were more like the size of drinks). Okay, twist our arms, we aren't hangry anymore. ;) They have a new fresh cocktail menu coming soon that will include exotic spices and fresh juices. You better believe that we'll be back for that! & crossing fingers they have my favorite crab dip next time!"}
{"text":"Trendy, inventive spot in Old Scottsdale serving creative southwestern cuisine.  With patio seating in the front and back, and generous seating indoors there don't appear to be bad places to sit.  Decor is classy and the food yummy.    Lots of options for vegetarians and gluten-free dieters.  I had the butternut squash and corn enchiladas which came with a side salad and were quite tasty.  My husband had the short rib tacos which were also nice.    Our server was a bit odd, but overall did a nice job.  When ordering a beer we asked for suggestions and he said, \"Yeah, it's a good beer.  Convinced me to switch from bud light\"  While not a roaring endorsement for a boutique beer, it was still a good suggestion.  While there might not be lots of child-friendly food items on the menu, the restaurant is child-friendly and appropriate with plenty of room around tables for a high chair and not too quiet to bring well-behaved little ones."}
{"text":"Gosh, Yelp! You give this a two $$ (dollar sign) rating? I would hate to see what a five $ rating would be!  I went here with a friend yesterday and was shocked at the prices. $19 for a burger? Pretty location and pleasant ambiance, but we walked out aghast."}
{"text":"First time in Scottsdale. I walked from the Firesky Resort to the an area full of restaurants, couple of blocks from the hotel. I'm so glad my group pick the Herb Box. We started with the Korean Cauliflower and I order the Thai baby back ribs for my meal. The Korean cauliflower tasted like a traditional Korean fried chicken, but cauliflower. The ribs were great, but I have to admit that the highlight of the meal was the Mac and Cheese. Best Mac and cheese I've eaten. Another plus is the big food portion.   Overall, great restaurant and I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Looking for a healthy option that really does taste outstanding? This is the place.  My husband is the burger/steak eating type. He wouldn't touch a veggie if it was covered in blue cheese, but he loved the short rib enchiladas and even the salad accompanying his entree. I had the butternut squash enchiladas, and before you say, yuck, you have to give it a try. I had almost changed my mind before ordering but was glad I didn't. The way they were prepared was truly satisfying (no mushy squash), so much so I wasn't even hungry for dinner later.  I have to dock the review one star because the place is pricey even for Scottsdale (2 'veggie' enchiladas with a side salad at $15 for lunch is a bit high). That said, the quality of ingredients are obvious, the blend of flavors are like nothing else I've ever had, and I left very happy someone created a restaurant that those of us who don't want heavy, unhealthy portions can actually enjoy the taste and feel good about eating.  One shared hummus appetizer, two orders of enchiladas, two non-alcoholic drinks (w/refills) and an order of chicken chili to go = $70 (incl. tip).  No res req'd when we arrived on a Monday at noon.  P.s. Having the manager or owner strolling by, making sure the guests were satisfied, was also a plus in my book.  Nice touch."}
{"text":"The corn and butternut squash enchiladas are incredible! I love the sweet potato chips too. Basically...you can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"****this review is based on breakfast menu only**************   Since I love the lunch and dinner soo much I thought I would go for Sunday brunch.   First off they had a horrible selection of breakfast, they dont even serve french toast or omelets or breakfast sandwiches.   They had a egg breakfast, which is what I got. Consisted of 2 eggs with cheese and bacon and tomato and avocado slices on the side.  First off I give it 1 star for appearance. It looked worse that what I could have made at home.  The bacon was soggy the eggs were looking like neon yellow and clearly a boxed egg. (which should not be the case with a place like herb box for 9 buck for box eggs and soggy bacon)  I could have made it way better at home   Jamie got the buckwheat pancakes since they didn't have an option to have buttermilk. The pancakes were super super dry and almost gritty. It said it came with strawberries... I'm not kidding you it was a half strawberry cut in 3 small pieces. It also had dried blueberries which were actually soo gross I could not believe they would not use the fresh ones.   Aside from that the only other thing on the menu was   custard donut and hot cocoa for 9 bucks wtf? a 9 dollar donut.   a bowl of oatmeal for 6 bucks   breakfast burrito which the guy next to us got and he took it back. He said it was litterally egg and dry black beans unseasoned  I saw the size and it was like 2 breakfast taquitos.  There where like 2 more things but I cant think of it  If you want the breakfast herbox should have go to arcadia farms."}
{"text":"Loved it!  Fresh, creative, friendly service, great atmosphere.  If I had any negative about this place at it would be that the acoustics cause it to be a bit loud inside."}
{"text":"For some reason, I don't always think of healthy restaurants as having mouthwatering, flavorful choices.  But this place does!  We pondered the menu for a long time since there were so many things to choose from.  Very urban, very trendy little place.  Friendly staff.  The cilantro crab dip had a little zing to it that really complemented the sweetness of the plantain chips.  Our salads were plentiful and tasty.  I can't wait to go back and try all the other things that I couldn't decide on.  Well done!"}
{"text":"The food was okay, the service, ... that was nothing to write home about.  .  And it wasn't that busy.  I would not go back.  The mac & cheese were ok but not for raves, and nothing I'd order again.  It's just a place to hang out if you live or are staying around here, and I don't so I won't--ever."}
{"text":"OM mutha funkin G!!!!!! This place is amazing. The food was spectacular, and the vibe was perfect.  I had the market salad and for some reason I was craving pears so the waiter offered to add and it was utterly phenomenal.   You have to get the sweet potato chips. perfectly crispy and delish.   This place has it right. Good Job Herb Box. You will for sure see my ass there again!!! Guaranteed!!!!"}
{"text":"expectations - reality = disappointment  while i still think the service here is awful 85% of the time, the food and atmosphere are too good to keep us away. i have to update my review to be fair because in all honesty i eat here at least 1 or twice a week for lunch.   food= 5 stars patio= 5 stars service= 0  just lower your expectations on the service so that when you do get someone great you are pleasantly surprised!   things i recommend in the order of how often i order them:  sunflower salad- my fav salad on the planet white bean chili- oh gosh!!!! they need to do like a soup+salad/sandwich combo asap pesto chicken sandwich w sweet potato chips  that's pretty much all i order but i can say that their enchiladas are the bomb and so is the quesdilla.   as for the desserts down in the market, we have yet to try something that wasn't amazing. crack pie, chocolate mousse thing in a mini pie crust, cake slices...seriously whenever we go for dessert it's amazing.   the service in the market is alwas good, too!"}
{"text":"Very good food and would likely return for that reason. Service was inattentive and clearly inexperienced. Servers did not know how to appropriately serve wine (bottle not opened at the table, not poured to taste, recorked at the table). While the server was \"nice\", the level of service could be stepped up."}
{"text":"We were looking for some modern, imaginative Southwestern cuisine for lunch, and we found exactly that at The Herb Box.  Nearly all the menu items are creative, blending ingredients you're not likely to find elsewhere.   Five stars for imagination, for the kitchen's execution of these ideas, and for the well-organized and very attentive service (and this, 15 minutes before closing time.)  The plantain chip and dip appetizer was a nice starter, with the chips themselves as interesting as the dip.    The two entree salads that came to our table were fulfilling and full of fresh leafy, crunchy, and meaty elements in good proportion (i.e enough greens, a generous portion of protein, and just the right amount of seeds and dried fruit).  The dark pepper-based house made dressing on the shrimp salad was notable for being slightly sweet but with a strong kick.    The grilled cheese comes with sweet potato chips, the latter being about the only thing on the table that could be considered just OK.    Portions are generous. For dessert, the strawberry shortcake dessert was enough for 3 or 4 people.  The shortbread was a had a biscuit-like texture but was very moist, a rare and welcome combination.  I only wish I could go back to see what \"lemon meringue unpie\" could be.      Good for kids? I would have guessed  \"no\" except that I've never seen my five-year-old put away a whole grilled-cheese sandwich, especially one on such interesting, \"adult-oriented\" dark and grainy bread.    The ice teas were remarkably good, to the point that I felt sorry for what my Coke-drinking table mates were missing."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a light brunch. Instant fan. The atmosphere was great, very quick and attentive service. The food was great and we almost had no wait.   Overall just a pleasant experience, we aren't from Arizona so it was nice to experience local eateries while down there!"}
{"text":"Happy Hour til 6pm (at least on weekdays)!  I came here with my mom because of course she knows everything in Scottsdale and is the hippest when it comes to where to eat. We wanted to detox a little post-Thanksgiving and The Herb Box did not disappoint. Located in adorable Old Town Scottsdale, while you eat the Trolley drives by and during the holiday there are pretty lights outside too. And of course it's Arizona so it's usually not that cold and you can dine outside. We were able to take advantage of happy hour so we had $5 appetizers. We tried the brussel sprouts chips and the crispy cauliflower with quinoa. Both were OMG delicious.  We also had the butternut squash enchiladas. I added the quinoa from our appetizer to mine. So, so good! Great texture and delicious taste. And then for dessert - chocolate beet cake! Yes beets in the chocolate cake, with a mousse inside and whipped cream on top. YUM to the max!  Not that this is why you should choose a restaurant BUT their restrooms are really really cute. Definitely check that out (to the ladies! don't know what the mens looks like!)"}
{"text":"5 stars for food and 3 for service.  First the good...  Food was fresh, healthy, and delicious.  I had a beautiful sugar glazed salmon served perfectly medium with black quinoa, fennel, snap peas, and blackberries.  We sat outside at a very comfortable table.  Sadly though, our waiter sucked. I asked for no onions - onions all over my plate.  My partner asked for salmon in his bowl- he got shrimp.  Waiter promised a discount - none on the bill.  He did take our picture though."}
{"text":"An excellent restaurant in  charming Old Scottsdale.  Beautiful restaurant with Patio seating.  I went for lunch with a friend and we sat on the patio.  I had the chopped salad with chicken and it was very good.  Ingredients were fresh and tasty.  Overall a good experience and I would recommend it to my friends and will be back."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on a Sunday, and loved their brunch-and-bottomless mimosas deal. So delicious. The salmon hash was amazing!  Also tried the brisket sandwich, which was not as good, but still tasty. Our server Shad was also really friendly, patient and helpful, considering we were a large, needy group of 10 people. Had a great experience and will definitely be coming back here again for brunch!"}
{"text":"Beautiful and lovely brunch on the patio today, 75% of our 4 meals were great...service was pretty good. Great ambiance and location. Prices a little more expensive then they should be, but we'll go again I'm sure."}
{"text":"Was in town for the weekend and grabbed lunch on a Friday with my girlfriend.  Sat outside and service was excellent. We shared the avocado toasts and the butternut squash enchiladas and both had a glass of the Sauvignon Blanc.  Everything was truly amazing.  I almost wanted to go back over the weekend!  Loved it!"}
{"text":"We had a great dinner at the new Herb Box location! The shrimp and avocado salad was really flavorful! It could be a little more filling but the flavors were great! My husband had the blackened steak. The steak was very tender and flavorful. The blistered shishito peppers that came with it were great! Drinks were also great, I had the blackberry mojito and my husband got the Martinez. Both were great! To finish we shared the vegan pot de creme. If I didn't know it was vegan, I would not have been able to tell. It was very rich and delicious. The shortbread cookies that came with it were great but the rosemary was too much for us. The service was great! Our server, Sasha, was awesome! She provided many recommendations and was very friendly. The manager even stopped by to make sure everything was great...it was!"}
{"text":"This is a wonderful place to have lunch with your girlfriends.  My girlfriends took me to lunch there for my birthday a couple of weeks ago.  The place was packed, we were actually surprised to see many gentlemen having lunch too, however it was not surprising because the food is great.  I had the special, salad, tomato soup and grilled cheese with chutney, yummy.  We washed everything down with Sangrias, so good!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I just moved to Phoenix from Denver and were excited to try The Herb Box based on the menu offerings and how many gluten-free dishes they serve (I'm celiac). Went for brunch at 9:30 am on Sunday and was pleased to see many open tables, we're used to having to wait in really long lines in Denver. In Denver we ate at Snooze a lot, hollandaise from scratch and Tenderbelly bacon, yum!  Our server was very polite but we had a few issues with the food, especially for the price. My coffee was undrinkable - it tasted strongly of the very bad tap water here in Phoenix and literally did not taste at all like coffee. It was like drinking hot dirty sea water. I'm the kind of person that covets a morning cup of coffee and could not drink it at all, a grocery store Starbucks kiosk would have been better.  Our food came out, I had ordered the buckwheat pancakes with bacon and a side of eggs, and the eggs had cheese on them. I mentioned it to the food runner and he said they always had cheese on them, I asked if they were on the menu that way and he said yes - they are not. I started scraping all of the cheese off in front of him, any normal place would have offered to remake them, so that was weird. The buckwheat pancakes themselves were delicious. About half the berries on them were old/bruised and the bacon was horrible - like IHOP bacon, but pancake stack was really good and filling.   I won't even go into my boyfriend's meal, it was also a huge disappointment for the price. Considering the low quality ingredients used (farmed salmon, cheap bacon) we cannot for the life of us figure out why they charge so much. For less money, we would have shrugged and probably come back another time and ordered differently. Between our two meals and a juice the bill was about $40 (for breakfast we were both disappointed in), and looking at the menu now we realize we were charged $18 for the salmon hash that is listed on the menu on their site at $15.   All in all, if the place was cheaper we would have had lower expectations. Will not be going back.  EDIT: I got super sick a few hours after eating here. My other meals were definitely gluten-free because I made them myself at home, so I'm going to add getting glutened to my long list of complaints :("}
{"text":"Wonderful salad.  Beautiful space.  Great staff.  Highly recommend this place.  Stop in and grab some Herbs"}
{"text":"Really tasteful decor with an interesting menu. Food was delicious - a little over the top rich but incredivly reasonable. Very nice and affordable wine selection and very sweet, cute server. A real real nice place for a quiet, relaxing dinner."}
{"text":"Love! love! love The Herb Box in DC Ranch. One of my favorite lunch spots to meet with friends. I wish I could get there more often! Wonderful fresh menu and great servers. I have never been disappointed here. Great outside dining too!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice now, once for brunch and once for dinner. Both times I've been pleased with the quality of food. The burger on the dinner menu was excellent and the bun was outstanding. It is pretty pricey, however, and the menu is not very extensive. Overall, I'll definitely be coming back at some point."}
{"text":"Of all the places to eat here, I picked the wrong one! Lol! This place is pretty ritzy. I ordered something light like the avocado salad. Arugula salad on a bed of toasted bread with a spread of avocado. Nothing special, but an unexpected presentation. Since I am still in braces - the slaughter of this salad didn't look too pretty. Toasted, almost nearly burnt - had to be careful with braces.   I sat on the patio since it was a really nice view of the canal. BAD IDEA. Something from the trees above me fell into my salad...like little seeds from the tree.   My waiters weren't really friendly at all. Will not be returning for more..."}
{"text":"Meh. A bit over priced. Food was decent but not my favorite Scottsdale spot. I had the short ribs and hubby had tenderloin both were good but nothing special. Sadly the service was slow as well. The cauliflower app was very yummy though."}
{"text":"Service is terrible! This place needs a lot of love and attention to ensure this operation knows how to properly serve and tend to needs of customers. Just basic customer service and attentive nature is lacking here. Normally I don't leave reviews online for the public to see. But I felt it was needed with this place, since we encountered the manager during the visit and that was also quite mind-blowing.   The place is incredibly cute; great location and awesome atmosphere. However, this is where the good ends. The hostess literally ignored us standing outside by the desk, while she figured out the party set up before us. It's ok if you need to take time for someone else and their needs; we get it! But don't ignore us, avoid eye contact, and not even say hi! Let us know you'll be right with us. The most laughable is then two other people (1 the manager and another server) came over to hostess stand and just checked computer screen. No greeting of any sort. While standing there, we found out that they had also ignored another woman waiting for a table too.   After finally being helped inside to our table, I believed we would walk into an incredibly busy and packed place due to the lack of service. We didn't. There were 3 other tables sat inside. We forgave the first part of our experience and were ready to have a great brunch. However, the server took about 15 min to approach us after they all figured out who would be taking our section.   We ordered the Bloody Mary bar and mimosa. Unfortunately, this was not well done either. I asked the manager who came over to the bar if there were tongs to use for the veggies, or if I should pick them up with my fingers. His response was \"Right?!\" No action was taken after, so I just made a Bloody Mary for myself.   Food was 50%. Their salmon hash is pretty good! I would recommend that. Their Avocado toast is pretty awful in my opinion. Someone might like it though.   To sum this up... very bad experience. I would never recommend or return to this place. I urge you to use your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"After having a mini spa morning, my hubby gave me a call and we decided to have a lunch day.  Since I was in Old Town, I wanted to go back to Herb Box.  It was after the lunch rush, so we thought we might get better service.  We were right.  Eric was our server, he was sensational.  I had a delicious Coconut Shrimp Salad and my hubby had a Steak Sandwich.  His was not that great.  We washed down our meal with a Raspberry Hibiscus Tea, very tasty.   I think the key here is to go when they are not as busy.  I still think the hostess stand could use a little coaching to make guests feel welcomed."}
{"text":"Had a nice brunch today at The Herb Box.  We had a kale,Brie and apple omelette. The bacon could have been cooked more but that's a matter of preference.   We also had a chopped salad but the mac and cheese was the best part.  It was our first time and we will come back soon.  Our waitress Sande did a great job and was very friendly."}
{"text":"Love the new digs! This is a MUST for dining in old town!  Met a friend for a light lunch, and it was a delightful experience from beginning to end!  We chose to sit on the patio, and glad we did because that wont be an option much longer heading into summer. Beautiful patio, lots of low slung chairs with comfy pillows, and plenty of umbrellas for shade.  We had the chilled cilantro-lime crab dip and wow, just wow! It is paired with plantain chips, and per the recommendation of our server, we went half plantain chips, half sweet potato chips, we enjoyed every last bite! It was excellent. We also had a special of the day, flat bread with brussel sprouts, pancetta, and cheese, extremely flavorful. I would order the same lunch again over and over I enjoyed it that much."}
{"text":"It was restaurant week here in Scottsdale when I visited this restaurant. I tried the salmon along with the leek/corn/sweet onion app. Everything was cooked very well and the service was terrific. Since I have gluten issues they were very careful about my choices. The menu was very clear about which foods were GF and which could be modified to be GF. Our server James was great."}
{"text":"As most of you know, I eat at the Herb Box a lot! I can't say enought about how good the food is...I have been served by probably every employee but my Fav is a guy named Eric. I have had bariatric surgery and can't eat most starchy carbs. I have told Eric this. He and the kitchen staff adjust things so I can eat different dishes. Anyone who has had surgery knows just HOW wonderful this is! This week, I wanted to try the hummus appetizer but it comes with pita. Eric had the kitchen cut up all kinds of beautiful veggies in place of the pita. It was soooo good. He has made other changes for me too! I now request only him. I want to thank the Kitchen and Eric for making my dining experience so special! Most places refuse to substitute or charge you an arm and a leg! Well my friends, not at The Herb Box. Go and see Eric and eat their amazing food. I am sure it is made with LOVE!!!  http://spoonfulpersuasion.blogspot.com/"}
{"text":"I have hard of the Her Box or so long I finally decided to give it a shot with the gf for a nice litte dinner. I have to say I was impressed. Great service and the waiter (Andy?) was not only one of the most helpful waiters (in terms of being honest about his favorites on the menu) but also one of the funniest. So much so that I asked him if he thought about being a stand up comedian (which usually doesn't across as a compliment but was one). I had the advocado love which was three slightly toasted servings of advocado with some arugula and a few green jalepenos (which I wasn't aware of until I bit on one...). Only negative about that dish which was delicious is that I wish the bread was slightly more toasted so it would hold the advocado and salad better. I also ordered the smoked gouda mac and cheese. I'm familiar with gouda as it's basically a staple cheese where I grew up similar to cheddar here and it was as close to being perfect as it could be. Served with some bread crumbs and really delicious. The gf had a flatbread,corn and goat cheese which was equally as good. I'm not much for desserts for the most part and the dessert menu did look great, but the gf managed to request one, the smorees creme brulee. I'm not sure it was a complete success...edible yes but most creme brulee comes somewhat warm and the consistency was good but more like a pudding than what I was expecting. I love bread pudding but didn't try it and the serve highly recommended the crack pie which I'll have to come back for and test out. Despite the somewhat pricey menu, I'd say it was a pleasant surprise and well worth all the reviews and high marks."}
{"text":"Service is excellent however the food is marginal.  We stopped in on a Friday evening and there were no lines or waits.  Parking was easy in the back of the building on 7th street.  Wait staff were very friendly and provide very good advice on menu options.  Prices are relatively high.  I got the fried chicken which was ok but not remarkable."}
{"text":"Nipped in for a quick bit of lunch today.   Had to wait about ten minutes which wasn't bad, must say I was a bit confused when the place was half empty inside, but I can imagine they didn't have many tables set up for the five of us.  Had the chicken and arugula wrap which was delicious. Everything was seasoned really well and the homemade sweet potato crisps were fantastic.   The interior of the place is very well done. Tables not too close together and a nice decor all round."}
{"text":"I was in Scottsdale for my bachelorette weekend and this was the place my MOH, bridesmaids and usherettes chose for our first lunch in town.  Being a health nut, this was the perfect choice! The location was ideal, the decor and ambiance inside the restaurant was relaxed and very inviting.  I ordered the sweet potato tacos and tried one of the short rib tacos and they were both amazing!  Everything tasted very fresh, the portions weren't overwhelmingly huge (I'm from Texas, so everything is HUGE!), and the presentation was beautiful.  I also had a sip of the mango lemonade which is made fresh daily and it was delicious!  I forgot our waitress' name but she had a European accent and she was very helpful!  She was very knowledgable about all the menu items and even spent some time talking to us about where she was from while learning a little bit about us.  If I'm ever in town again, I'll definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Welp. The food was pretty good but the small portion sizes weren't worth the price. I went out with a few girlfriends on a Friday night and it was pretty dead, probably because it was raining and crappy weather. But we still sat outside by the heaters underneath the covered patio, it was kind of nice to sit outside while it was raining. But anyway, back to my review...We all shared some appetizers, the Korean fried cauliflower, falafel, Gouda mac and cheese, and the vegetarian nosh board. All were pretty good, cauliflower was pretty awesome but was disappointed with the 3 mini falafels we got; delicious, but why can't you make them at least meatball sized? you can never go wrong with mac n cheese and the veg nosh board was yummy, yet didn't think it was worth the price. I had myself a sexy fizz and fig, mainly cuz the name sounded awesome. It came in a martini glass with a bunch of fig seeds throughout my drink which I found kind of weird. I'd probably head back again, but maybe order one of their main dishes instead. Seems like a great date night place."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying we had one of the best servers I've ever come across while dining. Not only was he super friendly and attentive but had a great sense of humor, made great recommendations on dishes to consider and avoid. The use of his adjectives like \"Narnia\" and other fantasy words made ordering quite fun. His name is Andy.   It's hard to find a restaurant in old town Scottsdale that has decent spirits so much to my surprise this place had old raj gin, so I ordered it on the rocks.   In terms of ordering food I was in between the fried chicken and the Thai baby back ribs. I ended up ordering the ribs because they came with mac & cheese from \"Narnia\" and were highly recommended. The ribs were fall off the bone kind of ribs, and some of the better ones I've had in recent memory. You always know a good rib when no meat sticks to the bone and these were exactly that.  I was also able to try a piece of my friends filet mignon and it was fantastic. I'm pretty sure the group had a memorable meal but mostly due in part to our server. If you find yourself in old town and are looking for a good old American style bistro this is a solid option."}
{"text":"I don't feel I can review the service properly because I have friends who work here.  But the food and drinks are fair game.  I tried the Salmon Hash and the Red Velvet Pancakes. Both where very good.  I do prefer my salmon a little less well done than they are in the hash but I understand it would be difficult considering the way it must have been prepared.  The Red Velvet pancakes where a little rich for my taste but still very good.  After moving out of Scottsdale I try not to venture back too often but friends and places like the Herb Box will keep me going back for awhile."}
{"text":"This place has good food. I was here for sunday brunch and tried the buckwheat pancakes and the french toast. I was surprised at how good the buckwheat pancakes tasted - they are great if you're trying to stay healthy but still want something sweet. The french toast was good as well but not impressive. Breakfast was cheap, but service was very slow and the waitress was very forgetful. It's a good option if you dont want to spend a lot of money or wait 2 hours for a table at breakfast club."}
{"text":"I pass this joint often and wondered if I'd ever give this place a try... Well wonder no more...I tried it! I like the set up of this place. The food wasn't as nearly as 'Berekeley' as I thought it would be. I tried the Chicken BLT -- not fond of the basil garlic may and not a fan of sweet potates so the fries were a freebie fo a friend that had the Noodle Bowl. The bacon was tasty! I would be happy to return and try a few more items from the menu. Great to see so many chic and little spots popping up all over Central Phoenix. Cheers***"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. We called to make a reservation for a large party. No problems making the reservation, were told they could accommodate no problem. When we arrived they put us at two tables. We asked to be seated at one table and were told that they \"can't accommodate large parties\". No one told us over the phone that we'd be separated when we made the reservation. We asked why we couldn't be seated at one long table when the dining room was currently empty and was told that \"all the empty tables were reserved\". This was a lie. We sat at two separate tables for two hours and many of the tables around us remained empty our entire meal. We even saw a large party of 11 people seated together (we had 14). The manager never came over to speak to us, nor to apologize. The food was cold. The hostess was short and dismissive. I was a long-time fan of this place, but you can bet that none of us will ever return and we have told everyone we know about our terrible experience. It's disappointing that an establishment like this would be so rude to local customers and flat out lie to our face. Don't go here if you have a large party or dislike liars."}
{"text":"Every time I have eaten here I have eaten in the restaurant, but I went to the Marketplace hoping to grab a quick lunch to take home.  I ordered my usual-- the Albacore Tuna Pita (a scoop of tuna salad over a bed of arugula/greens/tomatoes, comes with 3 grilled pita triangles), but didn't get it until 30 minutes later!  Good thing I wasn't on a lunch break, because if I was, I wouldn't have had time to eat it.  I think a 30-minute waiting time for a salad is pretty ridiculous...I can't imagine what the wait would have been if I had ordered something that needed to be cooked.  Maybe that was just a fluke that day.    Anyway, I would advise to call ahead and/or just eat inside.  Marketplace to go = 2 stars Herb Box all together= 4 stars"}
{"text":"We stopped by the Herb Box for an early dinner and I was eager to try this healthy spot.  At around 5:30pm, the place was pretty empty.  We were seated outside and checked out the menu and happy hour specials before deciding on Stella (1st choice listed on happy hour menu was OUT?!?!), a chardonnay, and the hummus plate.    The hummus plate was amazing, but one of my pet peeves is a large amount of hummus and clearly not enough pitas.  I don't like to feel like a pig when I want more pitas to go with the half of my hummus that's still left.  Oh well.    We moved on to the BLT flat bread pizza and my Grow Happy salad.  The Grow Happy salad was delicious and a perfect dinner size.  The BF liked the BLT flat bread pizza, which had a cesear salad on top, especially because it was something different.  Now, the not so good part.  The service.  Sloooooow.  Awkwardly, disappointingly slow.  And it wasn't at all busy!    Can't say we'll be back, since we aren't up in that area a lot.  Maybe I'll have to try the other location."}
{"text":"Upon entering we were greeted by a hostess who was on her phone, and a very hurried staff.  We were handed dirty menus and we were seated at a sticky table.  Our waitress was friendly and kind once she got to us, and the food was good, however the enchiladas were dry and a little hard on the bottom.  Not the Herb Box that I remembered."}
{"text":"This is a cool restaurant that reminds me of an Amish restaurant I went to years ago.  Kind of country design, large wooden furniture.  Its nice, but slightly crowded (I don't like it when you hit the chair of the person behind you when you pull out the chair a bit to get out.  The way the furniture is designed you have to pull it out quite a ways to free a limb, even if you're petite.)    The sandwiches are made with good ingredients.  They are assembled with care and the combinations are great.  The side of sweet potato chips that come with the sandwiches are crisp and salty.  A few were soggy, but it happens.  So why the low rating?  Severely overpriced.  They don't seem to be hurting for business though so maybe priced appropriately for them?  However, unless you want to pay 13 for a sandwich, just go to Paradise Bakery (I'm not a huge fan of them either but they also make a decent sandwich for 5 dollars less).    I may go back for hh - their beer and wine selection seems good and well priced between 3-6 and half price shared plates (appetizers)."}
{"text":"We have grown to like this Herb Box, but still miss the one up in DC Ranch.    Don't get me wrong, it's still there.  But when I worked up near DC Ranch, we use to go there all the time.  That location (on Thompson Peak) has a strong Take-out  business mostly because it gets easily crowded with parents with kids.  So on a mild day, the Take-out is the way to go.  Actually, their Take-out  business is called Herb Box Market and it is marketed as a \"food boutique concept that offers customers a worldly and sophisticated retail setting that features an extensive array of freshly prepared meals including the casual catering-to-go line\".  Gabi M has written a glowing Five Star review of their catering business which you can read.  This location in Old Scottsdale also has a Take-out business, but it's downstairs and out of the way and seems less crowded when we've been here for lunch.    As you walk into The Herb Box, I would readily agree with Andy M, it does feel like you're eating in a Crate & Barrel!   But, that's not a bad thing, nor is it reflected in my Four Star rating.    One time, we sat near the old style turn of the last century bicycle, with the large front wheel.   All I could think about during our meal was that 60's TV show, with Patrick McGoohan called \"The Prisoner\".  LOL  We've had most of the items on the menu, but tend to gravitate to the Smoked Turkey Ciabatta ($12.00) with gouda cheese, bacon, sweet tomato and roasted red pepper aioli mayo which was very tasty.  It comes with sweet potato chips which are delicious.  Ask your server for a side of the red pepper aioli sauce for dipping.  It's mildly spicy, but works well with the chips.  We have also tried their Blackened Chicken Caesar Salad ($13.00).  It's slightly different then the other blackened chicken we've tried, but nice.  It comes with romaine lettuce, dried cherries, cotija, tortilla strips and a chipotle-parmesan vinaigrette.  I really believe it's the dried cherries that work best with the dressing that make the salad, but I would skip the tortilla strips.  The other entree we seem to enjoy is their Turkey Apple Swiss Wrap ($13.00) it has Turkey with dried cranberries, smoked bacon, and greens.  It also comes with sweet potato chips.  Remember the aioli mayo!  The wait staff is very good at The Herb Box and they work very hard at anticipating drink refills.  We sat in John's section for our last visit and he was great!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast on the canal. Sat outside on this nice morning. Eclectic but very tasty menu. But they gladly made great omelette with sliced tomatoes and toast. Excellent coffee.  Quiet enough for intense conversation. Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Just had a wonderful lunch at The Herb Box in DC Ranch! The atmosphere is hip, trendy and casual. They had a great looking patio that I'm looking forward to sitting in when it gets a bit cooler. They did have misters out there though so it's tolerable with the heat.   The service was great, no complaints at all.  I had the Turkey Apple Swiss Wrap.  Wow, it was super yummy!   The wrap had bacon bits and cashews in it.  They served the wrap with sweet potato chips.  I'm not a fan of sweet potatoes but, these chips, I loved.  We couldn't stop there, HAD to have a dessert.  We debated over everything they had and decided on the Lemon Meringue Pie it was very good and is the perfect size to share.  Price was good.  I split the bill with another and total came to $25."}
{"text":"Great breakfast and outstanding service.   Had the BLT and the chiliquitos.   Great fresh ingredients (avocado, green chiles)"}
{"text":"Went here on a Sunday for brunch, about 10 a.m., and was seated right away. I've eaten here many times for brunch, lunch and dinner and for some reason they just can't seem to get it together for brunch. Always slow service, even with lots of empty tables. The couple seated at the table next to us gave up and left and just as my husband started our countdown to departure (\"10, 9, 8...\") our server showed up. We had to ask numerous times for coffee refills (which the server said they were brewing - how does a restaurant keep running out of coffee??). It's such a bummer that Herb Box doesn't offer better service. The food is good (not great), it's close to home and the setting makes me feel like I'm on vacation while I'm there."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch today.  First of all,  kudos to the fact that breakfast/brunch is served until 4pm. #WINNING.  I found this place on yelp yesterday and decided to check it out.  Originally I was going to go for the Cubano but when I realized I could still get breakfast...I couldn't pass up the opportunity to get the salmon hash.  The hubby got the brioche peach french toast which he devoured AND THEN we also split the red velvet pancakes.    The hash was soooo good. Best thing I've had thus far in Scottsdale.  It's smoked salmon, crispy fingerling potatoes,  scallions, and fried capers (which I skipped) and topped with an egg (I got mine over easy). It also came with a red pepper aioli which set the dish off just right.  The red velvet pancakes,  mmm. I could eat those all over again. Not too heavy,  didn't taste artificial (like food coloring if that makes sense), and really just overall well prepared and was just the right amount of sweetness to compliment my hash.   Service was great,  the atmosphere was awesome,  and prices reasonable.  I really have no complaints and will probably visit again before my trip is over.  There is outdoor seating available but even indoors is light,  bright,  and open.  I would definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner with my husband and mother-in-law on a Friday night and the restaurant was about half full. This would make a great date spot, as the lighting is dark and there was an an acoustic guitarist playing in the background and he's really good!  I had the braised short ribs with cabbage slaw and grilled cabbage. I actually considered getting something else because I don't like cole slaw but I'm glad I didn't because the cabbage slaw is amazing, and nothing like cole slaw! It tasted more like mashed potatoes. Yummy. The short ribs were very tender, the kind that falls apart as soon as I poke it with a fork. My husband got the Thai BBQ ribs and mac-n-cheese, and he also liked his meal. He said the ribs had a bit of a spicy kick, so I didn't try any. I had a couple bites of the mac-n-cheese and while it had a nice smoky flavor, I thought it was a tad on the salty side. That wouldn't have stopped me from eating the whole skillet of it if I wasn't already filling up though.  Herb Box would be a great place for a girls night or a date. It sounds like they change up their menu pretty frequently, so I look forward to seeing what's new next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"A favorite local spot that has never let me down. Brunch on the patio and pretend you aren't in the desert with the garden ambiance along the canal. I attended a baby shower recently in the private room and it felt so homey with a settee the mom-to-be could sit on while opening presents. When with the kids, I love to grab a quick bite at the market (try the salmon and the hibiscus tea). Last night I tried the Urban Steak Salad and just couldn't get enough of all of the levels of flavor."}
{"text":"My girl friends and I visited Herb Box for Saturday Breakfast. Inside the decor is contemporary, bold yet comfortable. We made a reservation for 9:30am and arrived to an empty restaurant. Not that surprising since Scottsdale rarely rises for meals until closer to 11am. Considering we were one of three patrons I expected some over the top service. Not so much. The servers for the other two tables looked prompt, concerned and courteous. Our server seemed pretty stuck up and dismal. Frankly at 9:30am, I'll take my coffee without a side of pretentiousness thank you.   Regardless of our lack luster server or whoever she was, we ordered our breakfast.  I ordered the simple good morning, served with eggs, bacon, white cheddar, avocado, tomato and toast.  It was \"meh\". Not bad, not great. A good option if you are in the mood for a lighter meal without going sideways and too adventurous.   Note to Box: at least ask your table if they want salt and pepper. Never heard of a restaurant without the basic condiments.   I also ordered a cappuccino (pretty good by the way) and mimosa (for $8, go elsewhere in S-dale for the competitors who understand the value of a cheap mimosa even if its not Sunday brunch.)   Overall Herb Box was OK, no real complaints, no real dazzle."}
{"text":"I'm not a vegetarian, but I love this place...and didn't even opt for a dish with protein! SO f'ing delicious.  The Brussel Sprout \"chips\" weren't crispy, but doesn't matter - flavor was on point. The vegan aioli was a nice surprise at the bottom of the plate. (Not a surprise if you read the description on the menu, but I obviously didn't.)  I had a hard time deciding on my entree as so many of the items seemed interesting. I was torn between a salad or a bowl - went with the sweet potato baja bowl and have no regrets. The combination of textures and flavors was perfect...and I'm not even a fan of black beans.  So, that says something.  I really don't think you can go wrong with anything here.  But, I've only been here once and live 600 miles away, so it may be awhile before I find out which menu items to stay away from.  Herb Box, please open in LA!!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food and superb service.  Server Andrew T clearly enjoyed his work and took pride in the food he served, which made sense given the food's brilliance.  I, the vegan among 4 omnivores, greatly enjoyed the indian-spiced kale + corn and onion pakora and avocado love.  Any place with a vegan dessert gets an extra star, but Yelp only allows 5.  My party enjoyed their meals as well and meals were very affordable ($105 for a party of 5 with entrees and 2 desserts, without alcohol -- another $48 for a round of drinks).  Wish I lived in town to enjoy this restaurant more often but it will be a demand of mine for all future Phoenix trips (corporate office here so hopefully frequent!)."}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars I would. And I hate people who say that. Normally love the herb box. They have some amazing vegan options. One of which I ordered at 6:30 tonight.... we waited til 7:45 and just left. Can't tell you the last time I just left a place.   Not sure who is at fault here. The restaurant wasn't even busy."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a great meal last weekend. Sasha was very helpful with the menu and we both loved our Brussels sprout chips and quinoa bowls. Had a great experience and good, satisfying food."}
{"text":"Love the wait staff. Super friendly vibe and great food. The only thing missing is their amazing and unforgettable lemon meringue icebox cake!! Please bring it back. I initially ate at herb box because this dessert was highly recommended. Now it's gone but hopefully not for long!!"}
{"text":"I had a chance to have a solo lunch here totally impromptu.  The service, food and wine was terrific.  Loved it.  I had one of the yummy bowls for lunch paired with white wine.  Perfect."}
{"text":"Not event the longer than average wait time to get my food could keep me from liking this place. To be fair, we had a very large group and we landed all at once and may have overwhelmed the kitchen a bit. Hopefully that's just a hiccup.  What's to love? Well they had me at Herb Box. Several years ago I actually built a box out of redwood, filled it with soil, and grow herbs in it. So I was destined to eat here, and when we did eat I felt like they had plucked the herbs fresh from my own herb box in the backyard.  The salads were enormous and so very pretty. Because I'm an idiot I went with the heaviest non-herbiest thing on the menu - enchiladas. Don't get me wrong, they were top-notch and I scarfed them up in no time, but next time I'd go with lighter fare and really explore some fresh flavors.  Folks were ordering iced teas and lemonades left and right. Probably the perfect accompaniment to a flavorful salad or sammy.   I loved the decor. Loved how open it was. I remember a bright, airy dining room and by contrast the dark, sexy restroom. Yes, I just called the restroom sexy. Go check it out and tell me it's not sexy.  Sweet potato chips are a must-mention. They're not uber-heavy and have just enough seasoning to make you take notice."}
{"text":"Definitely a wonderful place for Dinner and birthday cupcake was on point.  I chose Makers 46 chilled and we went from there, I chose the pork belly sliders...second time having pork belly and it was the bidniss.  Both of the ladies ordered the brisket enchiladas, I ordered the herb encrusted chicken.    I forced my girlfriend to given me a bite and then she gave me two more, completely uncalled for but so delicious.  I learned something new...when going for a higher end presentation in homecooking, stack it.  Our waiter was attentive, but left us along for most of the evening, yet still able to ask the key questions at the key times.  There was live music which set the mood for our dinner and will definitely bring me back.  Again, Birthday cupcake."}
{"text":"The service was great. We were going to have dinner but since are appetizers was just ok, we walked up the street to Fuego Bistro instead. I really wanted to love the Herb Box since it's within walking distance, but with so many great choices in the neighborhood, there is no reason to settle for just OK food."}
{"text":"Gluten Free offerings get my 5 star vote. the GF lemon dessert was too die for! great patio seating with shade.  good wait staff and worth a wait to get in."}
{"text":"Being unfamiliar with Scottsdale in general, I wasn't sure what to expect when staying in Old Town for work. It was with much delight that I realized my proximity to so many great restaurants.   Take the Herb Box for example: large, open patio with plentiful seating for groups or just two, Christmas lights adorning the space, and the feeling that you are not in the middle of the desert. It being a Monday night, I was able to stay here sipping a notably refreshing cucumber and basil mojito for an extensive period of time whilst relishing the atmosphere. Service was somewhat attentive but they seemed to adapt to the type of evening you were desiring be it a large group with multiple requests or a low key night out.   I tried the vegan nosh board. Yum. It includes shishito peppers, a quinoa spring roll, jalapeno edamame hummus with an edamame salad, and corn and kale pakoras. It was an innovative medley of cuisines and flavors and I truly enjoyed each part. The edamame salad was more mainstream but still spicy and with great texture from the pairing of creamy hummus and roasted corn. The spring roll filled with black quinoa and mango was an ideal vehicle for the accompanying dip, which had hints of nuttiness, perhaps peanut sauce based. The pakoras were crispy and light but all were secondary to the shishito peppers. I'm loving shishito pepper season and these were blistered to perfection with a sweet tamari glaze proving a balance of spicy and sweet. I highly recommend trying the nosh board as you have an array of tastes and spices for a decent price. Overall, a relaxing evening in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I went here for Mother's Day brunch and it was excellent.  This place definitely does not serve up your typical breakfast/lunch fare.  Everything is pretty unique and delicious.  The crowd is always great as is the general vibe of the place especially the patio area when the weather is nice.  Coming from Tempe I just love the DC Ranch area especially Market Street.  Anyway, about the food:  * Egg with salmon hash - I think this was special for Mother's Day.  It sounded weird and I don't know why I ordered it, but I was glad I did.  It was like corned beef hash except with fresh salmon instead of corned beef and little real potatoes instead of the tiny potato things in normal hash.  It was excellent.    * Red Velvet Pancakes - HOLY SH*T!  Best-Pancakes-EVER!  Enough said.  * Sweet Potato Chips - Some of the best I've ever had.  * Low Fat Banana Bread  - Pretty good, but low fat?  Yeah right.   The service was pretty good but was a bit slow at times.  Probably because it was so busy due to the holiday.  They also aren't very happy with custom orders so just stick to what is on the menu."}
{"text":"FANTASTIC SUMMER PATIO!  I typically don't want to give up my favorite summer patio spots because here in AZ a good shaded patio is often hard to come by.  I just love this place so much I felt I was doing an injustice by not writing about it!   The patio is shaded with misters.  The food is really great quick lunch fare (they also serve breakfast but I haven't tried it yet).  What steals the show in the summer along with the patio is the lemonade that I traditionally like to mix with the blackberry jasmine tea.  I am officially addicted!   Taking a large glass out to the over-sized seating on the patio under the misters on a beautiful summer day is the best because their patio is shaded by the building.  It's not a large patio but it really is such a peaceful spot!    The food is very yummy and the big pro is most of it is exceptionally healthy.  They use fresh ingredients, and have unique salads.  The jalapeno avocado hummus is a must try.    Of course I can't help but mention what a wonderful staff they have.  I'm finding on the hot days when most people just want to go home and chill in the comfort of their AC the staff at The Herb Box is friendly, kind and welcoming.  I appreciate this as I know it is hard for businesses to make it through the rough summer months here in AZ.  Thanks guys for doing what you do!"}
{"text":"This place is completely amazing service was great food was even better!! I finally had the red velvet pancakes and let me tell you it was everything I was hoping it would be, if you are wanting a great experience definitely check this place out."}
{"text":"I have been here 4 times over the last few years. I hate to give bad reviews, plus this place needs one. Consistently terrible service. Flaky hosts that ignore people waiting to check in. Long waits at the table to even get water. Orders have always been wrong.  The food is OK, but there are many better restaurants in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"If you have children, DO NOT  bring them here. I asked to sit inside with my baby and was told by our waitress that \"we would clutter\" the area, NO LIE! I would have left but was meeting my best friend and son for lunch. Sat outside, ordered some apps and waited, waited, waited, oh did I mention waited for our waitress to come back to take our lunch order? It was horrible!!!!   We waited so long for her to take our order that when we did get our food, I asked for the bill and a to-go box. Oddly enough, when we were done eating, she brought us the bill and box- again, confirming how long you must wait.   The food was good. Tasted fresh but what really ruined lunch for us was the blonde waitress we had. She needs to learn to smile and actually WORK for her tip. Felt like she was doing us a favor by bringing us our food.   I called my husband and I told him that though I enjoyed my company, I very much disliked the service.  I will not be back."}
{"text":"We stopped in twice last weekend for brunch - the first time because we were excited to check it out and the second time because our friends picked the spot as a surprise.  The atmosphere is nice and we especially enjoyed the live music on Sunday - much more lively than Saturday.  The service was decent, but definitely some kinks still need to be worked out.  The food was solid, but nothing I would crave so much to keep coming back to.  I enjoyed the baby kale, brie and green apple omelette with bacon and wheat toast with a mango lemonade on my first visit and two over easy eggs with bacon and wheat toast on my second visit.  For Sunday brunch we took advantage of the $20 bottles of champagne and a carafe of orange juice, but honestly wasn't that impressed - the twist top bottles of sparkling wine were a bit of a letdown.    Overall, a nice place and probably only worthy of 3 1/2 stars, but I gave them the benefit of the doubt for being so newly opened."}
{"text":"The Herb Box is everything it should be for me. Decent vegan fare (at least for Scottsdale, which is not exactly a veggie/raw/vegan lover's paradise) and great outdoor patio with wonderful foliage/trees. Appears to be the most-popular lunch spot at Market-Steet/DC-Ranch. Friendly, attentive, helpful staff. Recommended."}
{"text":"The Herb Box offers most of what I want for an informal, outdoor lunch/brunch patio. Decent vegan fare (at least for Scottsdale, which is not exactly a veggie/raw/vegan lover's paradise) and great outdoor patio with wonderful foliage/trees. Appears to be the most-popular lunch spot at DC Ranch. Friendly, attentive, helpful staff. Recommended.  Not 5 stars only because I'm a super-veggie/raw food nerd, and I'd like even more healthy (meatless, raw, etc) choices."}
{"text":"Dont you just love it when you get to a restaurant and you really cannot decide because everything looks so good??? Well here it is!! Such great healthy fare - salads, wraps, sandwiches, flat bread do dah's....YUM YUM YUM!! An establishment that shares the USA Slow Food practices: \"Our Mission: Slow Food USA seeks to create dramatic and lasting change in the food system.  We reconnect Americans with the people, traditions, plants, animals, fertile soils and waters that produce our food.  We inspire a transformation in food policy, production practices and market forces so that they ensure equity, sustainability and pleasure in the food we eat.\" NOW DOESNT YOUR FOOD TASTE EVEN BETTER AND HEALTHIER KNOWING THIS??"}
{"text":"I was here with a group of about 12 of us and they sat us perfectly along the wall with booth seating on one side and chairs on the other. The environment was cozy and nice.  There was a lot of great variety on the menu which showed a lot of creativity too. I always admire a place that takes a staple item and puts a new fun creative twist to it!  I shared a couple appetizers with another guest and almost inhaled them all before he could even get a bite. The kale appetizer and Brussels Sprouts were so so good. Like I mentioned before it was a bit of a what would be boring food item and they totally made it creative and delicious.  There were tons of apps and entrees passed around on the table and I remember everyone trying a bit of everyone else's. Everyone said great things about each dish.  The service was great and I would definitely love to come back when in town."}
{"text":"I once was only a fan of their breakfast stuff, but now their other offerings are growing on me more and more.  I went here the other night for dinner:  The Highlights:  * Aesthetics - I just love the look of this place.  I don't know why but it really appeals to my eye. * Assorted breads and chips that come with the tzatziki and hummus platter - Hot, fresh, fluffy, and delicious.  The hummus is just ok though.  The tzatziki is pretty good. * Duck, corn and poblano crepes - The crepe was delicate and tasty.  The filling was equally as special.  The tender pieces of duck combined with corn and poblano was an excellent combination.  I would definitely get these again. * Corn and goat cheese flatbread - Very tasty and enough to share  The Lowlights:  * Smoked gouda mac and cheese - It just wasn't thick and creamy how I like it and gouda is just weird to put in mac n' cheese.  Also, rosemary doesn't belong in food.  I don't like eating potpourri.  * Roasted chicken - Eh.  It was pretty tender and juicy but just needed more flavor. * Ice cream sandwich thing for dessert - Again this was just eh.  It was like eating ice cream in a bun."}
{"text":"Not my first time here, but my first time for Breakfast.  It was great. I had the Bacon and Egg with cheese Sandwich I asked for NO lettuce and Tomato as that seemed awfully lunchy to me, and it was YUM...I called first to see if I could bring my dog with me if we ate outside and I was surprised to hear that we could...  So YAY I found another place to bring Higgins to. They brought him some water and found us a shady spot on the patio. He loves to go out to eat (He is a terrier so he isn't a large dog) and he behaved nicely thank you for asking :)...We went with my daughter who was on Fall Break and she had the Hot Chocolate and doughnuts they looked sinful.  The waitress was quite daffy and messed up our order a few times and kept forgetting things, but with the weather being so perfect and the company being excellent it was hard to notice. My Mom went inside and had a muffin and before I left I had to buy some of their sweet potato chips to bring home...those things are like another part of heaven. I hide them in my home office I know it's wrong, but what can I say I love them :)"}
{"text":"Always a reliable source for delivering the best of flavors and quality to my clients for lunch!   Organic and delish! Can't ask for more!   I am very thankful for their consistent and prompt delivery."}
{"text":"Fantastic all around! Get the Brussels sprout chips and/or the kale appetizer! Our server gave great recommendations and the cocktails were top notch. I will definitely return soon"}
{"text":"We have been residents of the area for some years now. We had never visited the place. Today at approximately 4:15pm, we stopped by for drinks. We wanted to sit by the stools outside, however, the windows were closed. A very nice young man suggested us to ask the manager. We did. She told us that the customers that were sitting inside were cold, therefore, the windows were closed. We had no problem with that and asked her if we could order our drinks at the bar and just sit outside. She was ok with that....so I told the bartender that we were ordering drinks and taking them outside. For some reason, he proceeded to open a window for us and we just walked out and sat by it. The manager comes right away and tells him to close it and repeats to us that the other customers are cold. I told her that I did not ask the bartender to open the window. We left. We felt like an inconvenience to this manager. We were also CUSTOMERS. We decided to take our business elsewhere. And we were treated very nice. We will not come hack to the Herb Box. This manager did not handle the situation in an appropriate way. Customer service applies to all customers. Needless to say, there were customers sitting in the stools outside, doing the exact same thing that we wanted to do."}
{"text":"Beautiful space on the Waterfront!  Good service and delicious red velvet pancakes with grand marnier syrup - yum, yum, yum!"}
{"text":"The Kitchen Manager at Cien Agave recommended The Herb Box as a place to check out while I was on business in Scottsdale. The place did not disappoint. I had a great lunch sitting at the outside bar, and the service was great. I'm a big fan of restaurants that support sustainability, so The Herb Box fit the bill. This is a solid choice."}
{"text":"Brunch was a cluster here today. Orders were wrong, soup came out after the food and the waitress split up our 150 check in a way that added up 180 bucks.  Food was not fantastic."}
{"text":"So we were walking around old town during our weekend visiting Scottsdale and we stumbled upon this place as being one of the few places that was open on a Sunday morning at 9 am. Great stumble on our part! It was a gorgeous day so we sat on the outdoor patio. Our waitress was lovely and she mentioned that they had a brunch special for $24 which included bottomless mimosas and an entree each. Sounds good to me! We got our drink on and couldn't decide on what we wanted to eat because everything on the menu sounded utterly delish! We finally chose the Avocado love and the corn and goat cheese flatbread. The portions are VERY large so we really could have split one of these dishes between the two of us and been fine but I'm glad we were able to try both of them. The avocado love consists of slices of bread slathered with avocado and topped with a fried egg, arugula and yellow pepper aioli.YUM-ME. Everything was ridiculously fresh and tasty. The corn and goat cheese flatbread had tomato, red onion and bacon and was topped with arugula as well. I can never get enough of it so it was all good with me! Again a VERY large portion. We sucked down a few more mimosas and were fat and happy all day long. GREAT place! The only tiny little glitch was the prosecco or whatever the mimosas were made with was very sweet."}
{"text":"I had a private event at this location. The room and service were great. However my issue is with their event coordinator, they need to hire someone courteous.  Event coordinator is not very friendly,  kept messing things up,  I had asked her to set up for 20, room was only set up for 15, we had to change our menu because dietary restrictions were not heard clearly by her even though I was absolutely clear. She did not explain the price well...so PLEASE hire a better event coordinator because this place really good."}
{"text":"I went on a brunch date on a SUN around 1PM. I had a reservation, however I later learned that if you prefer to sit in the outdoor section to specify that clearly when making the reservation.  We were seated quickly and well attended by the waiter, Michael.  He had several suggestions and was helpful and patient as we made up our minds.  The food was good++ to excellent.  And, for me, the sign of a good restaurant is good coffee to close the meal.  I was not disappointed!  Recommended."}
{"text":"Ok came here in a tues night. Kinda empty but service was good. Got the short rib enchilada. Just ok imo. Kinda pricey place but my buddy wanted gluten free, dairy free, everything free options.   Prob never return but it was worth the try"}
{"text":"The Herb Box is a perfect destination for ladies who lunch! It offers fresh, healthy, delicious menu options. My favorite thing to order is the hummus trio. I treat myself to the Scottsdale location once a week."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Arizona. I brought my family here from out of town and they wanted to come back the next day. The salads and wraps are awesome. My mom loved the sweet potato tacos."}
{"text":"We had a reservation for 14 people for Mother's Day and had my elderly grandmother with us. We ended up waiting a half hour for them to have our table ready and by then grandma was getting tired and starving. We were finally seated and our waitress told us we were her ONLY table. YAY! Sadly, she was terrible. We waited 30 min to order food after getting our beverages and waited another 20 minutes to get our food. The food was ok. My husband and son loved their brie burger but it wasn't special, especially for $20. I ordered the green chili pork chilaquiles which were bland I had to keep adding salt and no spice. Sad. Overall, we will not be back mainly because of the service and so-so food. In the end, our big family was at the restaurant for three hours and felt like hostages toward the end. Our server was a sweetheart but just couldn't manage her time. The manager came out after hour 2 to ask us how we were doing but didn't listen to our answer and walked away."}
{"text":"Herb Box has a new dish called \"Vegan Nosh\" and I definitely recommend it.  Very fresh and very tasty.   Our service today was extremely slow even though the restaurant was not too busy.  This will not dissuade me from returning, but it did reduce the tip.  No apologies for being slow, nothing.  This is not the service I usually receive from this establishment."}
{"text":"The Serrano avocado shrimp salad was amazing! The restaurant itself was very nice and inviting! I enjoyed sifting and relaxing on the patio while having dinner. I will definitely come back to this place whenever I visit Phoenix again."}
{"text":"Had a lovely ladies lunch here. Was a crazy hot mid-summer day, only available seating was outside. (yikes!) We were expecting 2 of our ladies with small children and this would not fly. After being notified that it would be a 30 minute wait, we were about to go elsewhere and the waiter told us to sit tight and they were cleaning off a table for us, that was just leaving. Very nice!   Prices are about what you'd expect for DC Ranch so I can't complain. Food was fresh, light, good. Had a yummy salad. Everyone in my group loved their food and 2 are big complainers, so I guess that says a lot!   I did not partake, but my companions had some sort of champagne/mango treat that they raved over. Looked scrumptious too!"}
{"text":"I just moved to Scottsdale from San Diego and Ive got to say I have not been disappointed in the food! The Herb Box was delicious! We went to the DC location for Sunday brunch and the BLT was amazing! We took our puppy and sat outside. Very peaceful and relaxing! Ill be back very soon!"}
{"text":"Their happy hour is amazing, can't get enough!! Would recommend the pear and Gorgonzola flatbread and Thai baby back ribs. Took a little long to get the food but totally worth the wait."}
{"text":"This place is A-MAZ-ING! Our waiter was a little awkward, but that didn't matter once the food showed up. We got two sandwiches (one turkey one pork) and a salad that was a special (with fresh ahi tuna on the top). All three meals were perfect. Would recommend to anyone who's will spend a pretty penny on a great mean."}
{"text":"Maybe my expectations were too high? I'll start with the pros: comfortable atmosphere, cute decor reminiscent of summertime in a lovely cottage near the seashore (this is MY opinion), prompt service, extensive menu of options..  I just thought the food was eh. Went here for breakfast on a rainy Saturday and ordered the simple good morning eggs. Although, from the title, I guess I should have known what I was getting myself into. However, the eggs came out cold and the cheese hardly melted on top. I could have sent it back but I hate being one of those people so I trudged though it. I was looking forward to a hearty meal but was left unsatisfied and still hungry. I don't expect to have to eat the toast to fill me up. If that were the case, I should have stayed home. One caveat, I also don't eat bacon. The coffee was nothing to write home about either.   My boyfriend ordered the cinnamon buckwheat pancakes, which he enjoyed and was more than a decent portion size.   I would return possibly for lunch or dinner and give this place another chance. The other menu options look awesome and if the taste follows suite, I will re-review. The market downstairs also looked really cute with to-go meals or quick bite on the run. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Ended up here for dinner in a Saturday night. Reservations strongly recommended! I think the only reason my party of 4 got a table was that we were there at 5pm! I ended up having the short rib enchiladas. They were yummy. And the slaw it came with added a nice crunch. Since we had time to kill I went for dessert and got the special - a lemon chiffon pie. Nice, lemony taste and a delicious crust, but the texture was a little gelatinous. Winner for dessert at my table was the salted butterscotch creme brûlée. Overall a great looking restaurant with yummy food and good service. I'd go back, but just remember to make a reservation!"}
{"text":"This is a great place for brunch. The brunch menu is more limited than Breakfast Club and Daily Dose but much tastier. The chilaquiles verde, BLT, and the red velvet pancakes were flavorful and delicately prepared. The dishes tasted like they were made with fresh ingredients. I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"I went here only once with a friend and I was blown away by not only the food but also the service. Our waiter was incredibly friendly and definitely made eating lunch a delight.  The location is nice as well as it is situated right next to the canal. You can people watch if you decide to sit outside and not worry about the heat because they have the misters.  I think in general, its a great way to start a weekend. Eat your lunch and then finish it off by walking to the mall or through downtown."}
{"text":"If you had asked me yesterday how I would rate The Herb Box I would have said - 5 stars, period. I have been to both the North Scottsdale and Old Town locations multiple times. The food has never been anything short of perfection. You can, therefore, imagine my excitement when I drove down my block and saw the sign on the corner saying a new location was going in literally a minute from my house.   I made plans with my sister and a couple of girlfriends to meet for a late lunch today. When we arrived the place was hopping but not overwhelmingly so. Our friend had already scored a table and a cocktail. We sat down and waited for someone to take our drink order...that took about twenty minutes and probably another ten before she took our food order. We chit chatted and opened gifts (we were celebrating two birthdays) and our food simply never came.   I stopped someone and asked if they could check on our order. They said yes. We noticed that the people around us had ordered, gotten their food, eaten their food, and even received their checks and we had not even had our drinks refilled. The woman I asked to check on our order didn't return but our waitress did. She gave us an offhanded sorry and did not even offer to refill our drinks.   Another woman came and said that our food would be out in two minutes (it wasn't). I asked to speak to a manager - she said she was one of the managers. When I complained to her that we had literally ordered 45 minutes ago and that noone had even offered to refill our drinks she gave me a quizzical look and then said, \"Do you want refills?\" Um, Hello!!! What do you think??? She then said that she would get someone to refill them and that that round was on the house....uh thanks?   Another 10 or so minutes went by and still nothing...no drink refills, no food. A blonde man who may have been a server, not sure, came over and asked if we were o.k. We flat out told him no and explained what was going on and that we were honestly about to leave. He apologized and said he'd figure it out and get us our drinks. Soon after another young man refilled our waters and apologized and asked if we were having issues with our server - we told him yes, and that she had basically disappeared.   Finally another 10 or so minutes later the food arrived. The good news is ... it was delicious. Hence the 3 stars. It was all incredible. As we were eating the woman manager came over and said she had looked at the time our ticket was put in and that because we waited so long she would comp our meal...apparently my telling her how long we had been waiting had not convinced her. Later another manager stopped by and said the same thing...at that point we were happily eating and just thanked him.  I get the chaos of a new restaurant opening but the way the situation was handled by our server and the woman manager was terrible. I was appreciative of their comping the bill and will of course be back because I find their food totally delicious and addicting but I will probably stick to take out for the time being until they get the kinks worked out of their service."}
{"text":"I adore this restaurant.  The service is excellent. The food is perfection.   I've had the Butternut Squash Enchiladas and the Corn and Goat Cheese Flatbread - both are awesome. I also love the Urban Market Salad and I tweak it a bit - I swap the blue cheese vinaigrette for the dressing that comes on the Fiesta salad that accompanies the enchiladas and ask for no blue cheese crumbles.   Worth your time, worth the money."}
{"text":"I tried Herb Box for lunch with a coworker today, and while it was a little pricey, I enjoyed the meal. The setting on the canal is beautiful, and on a perfect, 80-degree day like today, the outdoor setting was just right! Music was mellow, and if we hadn't had to come back to work, we could have killed hours drinking wine and hanging out.   I had the Sunflower Salad, which came with Cajun chicken, goat cheese, dried blueberries and strawberries, bacon and (of course) sunflower seeds! It was tossed with a light vinaigrette, and very tasty! My only complaint was that the chicken was in four large chunks, which I had a hard time cutting up because the bowls are a bit slanted, and it's hard to cut on greens. My coworker's was nicely cubed, though, so I'm guessing that's how it usually comes. Nothing that couldn't be solved with a small side plate!   The waiter was very kind, and with tip, I think the meal was about $20. (Pretty steep for a lunch salad in my opinion, and I only drank tap water.)  The verdict: Decent place for lunch, but maybe not very frequently... I'd probably be just as happy paying $15 at chop shop and getting a side of Sweet Potato Hash with that price!"}
{"text":"This place has the best salads. Highly recommend the Serrano avocado and shrimp salad."}
{"text":"Stopped by during lunch on a weekday while traveling to Scottsdale for work - this place was awesome! Tons of unique options that I've never seen, with gluten free, vegetarian options as well (always a positive). We started off with the brussel sprout chips which were so delicious, and I ordered the short rib tacos - AMAZING. Would love to try out their other yummy looking options on future visits!"}
{"text":"I really should have wrote a review many years ago. I am hooked on the food at The Herb Box, every time I've been blessed to eat here or enjoy the catering, it is a mouthwatering culinary delight. I am also in the wedding and event business so when I see Herb Box is the caterer, I'm suddenly in the mood to eat. If its some random food like at most resorts, no thanks. So if you are reading this and wondering if you should hire them for your next event do not hesitate they book up fast and add one more plate for me. If you are wondering whether to eat in house, try the soup. It's called 'The Herb Box\" for a reason, its amazing. Five Stars +"}
{"text":"To me it is obvious when a chef is running a restaurant as opposed to a traditional entrepreneur-cook. The herb box is a superior restaurant because of the fine nuances in the dishes which only are created by a chef who has studied flavor and texture.  Their sides can stand on their own. The desserts are lacking, but this is forgivable as I imagine the chef skipped dessert classes to focus on the main course. Overall an excellent restaurant and worthy of five stars."}
{"text":"This was our last stop before heading home to the NW, and it could not have been more perfect.  The garden patio along the canal was  picturesque and relaxing.  I had the BBQ chicken flat bread, which was phenomenal, homemade incredible sweet potato chips, and a drink the name of which escapes me, but was basically a tequila Mojito made perfectly with fresh ingredients.  I will certainly be a repeat customer on my next trip."}
{"text":"Good for an easy and leisurely business lunch or outing with the girls.  The market downstairs is great for takeout and a great selection of bakery treats."}
{"text":"I guess we missed the adjoining little bakery/market right around the corner on Stetson.    FYI, from 4pm-9pm is HH!  Half price for all the delish pastries!!!   I think we cleared out most of their baked goods at one sitting.  I feel bad for the sweet girl working behind the counter.  She was the only one working when a group of us walked in.  That didn't hinder her capability as a barista.  She was AWESOME...so awesome I forgot her name.  I ordered an iced americano with cream.  Hubby got his latte and \"cold\" white chocolate milk.  I don't remember the names of the patries, so I will rename them by ingredients:  blueberry crumb tart, chocolate cake fondant, gluten free coconut chocolate loaf, peanut butter pie...and more.   We all sat in the patio surrounded by a cool mister.  It was a lovely night to hang out and watch all the beautiful people in their club clothes while we stuffed our faces with scrumptious desserts... You won't see me here for awhile.. I'm on a healthy kick to get my cuteness back.  p.s. Just found out the barista's name is Fatima."}
{"text":"This place is great! I work up the street and it's a nice place to come sit after work... I usually get the Steak Salad, it's a perfect size and delicious. Also get the falafel appetizer it's excellent, very filling tho... The place is a bit pricy, but its DC Ranch so i cant blame them. One of their secret things are the Sweet Potato chips, warning: they are addictive, can never eat less than a bag. There's two others that I know of, seems like they got a good little system going on, the one in Old Town is also very nice. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Service and layout of the restaurant are great. I had the bourbon-ginger peach French toast which was GREAT! My dad had the chilaquiles, the meat was good but overall really bland."}
{"text":"Amazing craft cocktail created by craft master Paul! He surprised me with a sensational drink that my friend and I have named The Twilight. Seriously ask him for it, you will LOVE it! Live music by Jon made a perfect HH spot! Enjoy Scottsdale friends!"}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorite brunch spots in old town. They have a decent vegetarian selection and their food is delicious. The decor and atmosphere is also very nice. My only complaint is the slow service, and the somewhat pricey menu. It can take ages to get a cocktail and they often taste watered down. This could be due to it sitting on the bar for 15-20 minutes, instead of being brought over promptly. I will return, but I have been hesitant due to the issues mentioned above."}
{"text":"Service was decent. Food was just okay, a little on the bland side. Probably wouldn't go back unless someone else picked it. Went for a friend's birthday and not one in our group was really hyped about their food either. Not terrible, not wonderful... As evidenced by a fairly empty dining room."}
{"text":"We had an 11:30 AM reservation for 4 on Thursday 4/13. At that time there were only a couple other diners. Food took forever to come. They finally brought 3 of the 4 orders. The last one still took a bit longer (butternut squash enchiladas). A bit awkward waiting since we were all starving.  Our waiter's fingernails were really dirty. Quite a distraction and a health concern. I hope my boss and co-workers didn't notice. Very disappointed considering the price of lunch.   Everyone seemed to like their dishes. I felt my food was bland (Market Steak Salad). I never, ever, ever add salt at a restaurant and very little at home and then only while I am cooking. Yet I found myself looking for the salt/pepper to give the dish flavor (there was none on the table). Was very disappointed in this first visit. I was the one who selected it for a business lunch. Probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Server was very nice to let us order from happy hour menu, with only a few minutes to spare. For my entree I ordered the trout with Brussels sprouts and I really enjoyed  it. The other dishes were good too. Prices are a bit high but what you get is well worth it."}
{"text":"Great food and extremely friendly staff (sit at the bar with James).  Exactly what I was looking for!"}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times before and it's usually a great experience, this time was just not good. To start, our food took over 30-45 minutes to come out. Our waiter didn't even address us during that time, we had to ask for refills. And the cup for the creamer for the coffee had a crack in it, which caused it to leak on our table. Then a woman came up to tell us that they misplaced our food ticket and it will be out shortly (this was around 30min from when we ordered). During this time, I watched 2 people get their food and we were still waiting. Then the bartender kept slamming glass bottles into the trash can right behind us, this was very annoying. I've always enjoyed coming here but this time was just not a good experience. The woman who addressed the situation was very pleasant and she ended up taking care of the bill, which was very kind."}
{"text":"This place is so cute and yet still manages to be trendy? I don't know how they do it, but I'd love to figure it out someday. And then use it for myself so I can be cute and trendy, too!  The food here is really fantastic. I had a gargantuan salad that could have easily fed 2 I bet. It was a great blend of flavors. And of course, Gabi convinced me to start with the sweet potato chips. Those were good, too, but nothing compares to Sputnik's sweet potato fries so far. Everything seemed worth trying though so I wish I could have gone back again and again.  Our server was super nice and extremely friendly. Overall, it was a great experience!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! I big puffy heart the red velvet pancakes and the orange juice was delightful! I've also dined there for lunch in the last week and split the kobe burger and the turkey wrap with my assistant and both dishes were flavorful, well-prepared, and really interesting. The fries are delicious and the service was amazing as well."}
{"text":"I have ordered lunch from here before but never even thought about having dinner at the Herb Box. Last night with #canalconvergence going on, we wandered through the public art and then looked for a place to eat. Everything was super busy but the Herb Box had an acceptable wait time and room at the bar. The drinks menu has a great variety. My husband ordered a super hoppy IPA while I indulged in their lemon basil martini. The pours were generous. After about 30 minutes we were seated at a great table where we could hear dinner conversation. The doors were open to the outdoors and it was a great setting. My husband was really happy with the Thai ribs. I ordered the Cauliflower steak. It is a gorgeous dish. In fact, I should have posted a photo except that I am tired of people taking pictures of their food in restaurants. Trust me, it looks and tastes amazing. Roasted cauliflower on a bed of black lentils garnished with roast brussel leaves and some type of savory mustard sauce. Oh, and pickled grapes! A surprisingly wonderful addition.   We got a couple of sides - everything was very good. The last elusive star is retained because I felt like we could have been seated a lot faster. Table service was very good. We'll go back."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch and liked it so much I came back for dinner the same day.  Lunch was fantastic,  the selection of salads is much larger than dinner and the items available during lunch were much better than the dinner we had.  I will only go back for lunch here.  The dinner was very flat.  The food was under seasoned at dinner. They have live music on the weekend which is nice at dinner.  I and my 3 companions were very underwhelmed by dinner but we all loved our lunch. Go for lunch,  skip the dinner."}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere and wonderful, fresh food! I had the miso salmon in the spicy udon noodle bowl. Omg...amazing!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious and nutritious. Love that everything is local and organic. The prices are very fair and the food is tasty. The atmosphere is nice yet laid back. I will definitely be visiting this place again."}
{"text":"We were looking for something light to eat and saw the small plates at the Herb Box along with many excellent entrees.   We started with the gazpacho which is very good. This is a non-traditional melon gazpacho and the ingredients are excellent. The gazpacho  can be ordered as as a \"sip\" with other small plates or cup, or bowl. Next, we tried the smoked trout beignets. These were excellent and very tasty.   Last, we had the chilled cilantro-lime crab dip house with crisp plantain chips and covered with a chili lime salt. This is \"so so\" with crab flavor, but not great. This was odd as originally, we were going to order the falafel bites, but our server said these \"were not very good\".  The ambiance is casual and the was really good live music, bumping this up a half a star. This is probably a better happy hour/lunch or breakfast spot and is a very average dinner.   I'll try again as the service was good and ambiance really nice."}
{"text":"Great place, thai bbq ribs and green apple slaw to die for!!"}
{"text":"The food and our waitress were great. The manager on duty was another story. But I did contact the corporate office and they were a big help. The Thai ribs were amazing."}
{"text":"Tried the Herb Box for the first time. I've run past this place many times and it's always smelled wonderful so finally made it a priority to come and I'm so glad I did. We ordered the Buckwheat pancakes which came with bacon, blueberries and honey orange whipped butter. What an absolute flavor parade for the tongue. So good AND gluten free. I also had a side of scrambled eggs which were just right. We also ordered the Market Steak Salad. The steak was unbelievably tender and everything else about the salad was delicious.  The portions were big for both of our entrees and the prices I felt were very fair for the quality of food. The service was excellent too. You should definitely make it a point when in Old Town Scottsdale to come for brunch at the Herb Box."}
{"text":"I loved the innovative menu.  Unfortunately my pork belly was 98% solid fat with only one bite of meat.  The waiter took my plate ,which was mostly untouched, and did not even ask me if I enjoyed the meal, much less why I did not eat it.  We did enjoy the crab appetizer with plantains and my husbands trout was excellent.  I would give this dining spot  another chance."}
{"text":"Limited menu but excellent quality food. The environment was relaxing and inviting. Although they do offer a kids menu the staff and patrons are not accommodating to kids and were very rude to my family. Good food, ok service, not for kids."}
{"text":"Not my first visit.  Brought out of town guests.  I was embarrassed ...service was awful..server Also the bartender, they were busy...guess who had trouble getting water refills.  Woman's bathroom was not clean, door on one of the stalls broken.  It's been broken long enough that they have a sign on the door indicating lock is broken, knock....why not fix if? Too many other choices to return to that.  Food very pricey for what you get.  Burger was dry and condiments left off...."}
{"text":"We've had some good experiences here, especially with Sunday brunch. Today was a little off. It's a Saturday and we dropped in for lunch. We ordered the special that the waitress told us about. Fish tacos. They were really more of an appetizer with just two tacos on a plate and a half a lime. I should have asked the price. $15 for two tacos 'on special' is ridiculous. A $40 tab for 4 tacos and 2 iced teas? The food was good but I feel ripped off. I won't be rushing back."}
{"text":"Great food.  Beautiful venue.  Awesome service.  We had our wedding reception dinner on the patio at the Scottsdale location in March 2017.  They went above and beyond.  It was decorated beautifully!!  Fresh flowers candles hanging from the trees.  Large tables to seat all of our guests.  They did a custom menu for us.  Kale, Corn & Sweet Onion Pakora - Thai BBQ baby back ribs - Mac & Cheese Grautin - roasted chicken and filet (medium rare) fork smashed potatoes Swiss chard and asparagus.  Delicious!!!  Chef Gregory made us the most delicious cake and cupcakes for our guests.  Thank you to everyone at The Herb Box especially Rhonda Lintner and Chef Gregory.  You helped make our day Perfect!!!!!"}
{"text":"Nice, clean and friendly atmosphere! Great service and delicious food!  We ordered a blackberry/jasmine green iced tea w a lime wedge-very very good! We shared a black bean, light chicken with goat cheese flatbread and butternut squash/corn enchiladas w green sauce that came a salad- mixed greens, with sugared pecans, red peppers and house dressing! All very fresh, filling and flavorful!  Highly recommend and can see us being future regulars!"}
{"text":"Amazing !! Amazing!! Amazing !!  -- Herb Box is becoming my new found meet for lunch / dinner spot.  Local food made fresh and delicious with savory spot -on flavors..you must try it!  It's been awhile since I have wanted to write a review for anything, but tonight my tastebuds and I want to sing to the world! Hallelujah and Rejoice!   I have always loved the far north Herb Box which is a lovely place and a great place. But now Herb Box is more centrally located in Scottsdale at the  larger Southbridge venue. This promises to be a great place to meet friends for breakfast, lunch or dinner  when anywhere near the  area.  The brand new look and feel says we have thought this out and we want you to be comfortable but feel impressed. Great spacing , lighting and seating make the place very inviting ...it just screams bring your friends over, meet me for a drink or appetizer,  stop in for breakfast after farmers market. Don't miss the girls bathroom .Regal feel with some sweet surprise...yes that is a sink...the mirror felt like I was Alice in Wonderland.... Tonight  for dinner we enjoyed the lovely cilantro and crab dip with fried plantains ,that make me smile and plot how I can steal more...shall I say it accidentally feel on the floor and demand more ? I just might.  Shh don't tell.  Mike and I split the flatbread/ pizza with pear and Gorgonzola that just excites the tongue...It is savory comfort food for sure.  We also split the Thai Ribs..Oh my Gravy !!..wow!! ..ribs with BBQ sauce that is completely thai and spicy and burn  you but   in  a good way ..loved it!  We also had the Gouda mac and cheese,  creamy , rich and make you fell like someone whipped the up just for you.. Mom had a large piece of salmon roasted in honey with guess what?  super tasty parsnips ..yup I said parsnips...I thought they were a joke food but no longer, parsnips are now on my to do list.   We finished off the meal with more mind grabbing tastes. biting into  a chocolate tart that had the right mix of sweet and decadence without feeling like you ate a spoonful of  chocolate frosting ,very cravable and a must for every diner. We also shared a sweet little Crostina with berries ...tasted great, without an over sweetness so common to many restaurants.I  must also mention the great blackberry jasmine green tea , so refreshing.   The Herb Box is full of great tastes , and if that is not enough ,...there is an adjacent market  chocked full of great tastes to go with an emphasis on local fare. ( think CROWS DAIRY and QUEEN CREEK OLIVE MILL ) They have foods to go , cheeses , dairy and great out of this world baked goods.  My plan, next time I need a bite before heading to the mall, is to grab a delicious treat , a small wedge of chees and a piece of fruit , no more mall food for me.   Yes I loved it .Yelpers keep your eyes open for the UYE soon to be announced   by me    ...You are in for a delightful treat."}
{"text":"Oh Herb Box you are so amazing I want to spoon you , kiss you and take you home to meet the family. Back for my second visit , I was amazed on a rainy Saturday afternoon , how crowded you were. All the Stepford wives needed to get their giggle on and they were everywhere.  Women with bridal showers, birthday parties and baby gifts.  Yikes it does get crowded easily. One group was so social they had taken over the entrance to French Bee on the other side of the restaurant. Yikes!  Anywho  Loved your ambiance , vibe and of course food!  My friend Rhonda and I split the plantain  and crab-cilantro dip ....simply amazing..yeah it was lick the plate clean time.  I had the steak salad which was refreshing and tasty  with enough meat to fill me but not heavy.  Rhonda had the flatbread pizza ala Cesar which I will be ordering next time ...very addictive taste.  Could taste bacon, well seasoned chicken and cheeses. Lovely.  Really wanted a dessert to spoil my  good eating but just no room . Darn."}
{"text":"We went for the first time and LOVED it. Both the service & food were top notch. Lots of great vegetarian & gluten free options, everything was very well priced, a bunch of affordable options on the wine list, and the cocktails were creative and delicious.  We had & loved: * Smoked Gouda Mac n Cheese * Urban Market Salad (no bacon) * Butternut Squash Enchiladas (Awesome! huge plate!) * Pear and Gorgonzola Flatbread (delicious) * Basil ice cream (mind blowing)  We'll definitely be back. The food is awesome and it's very affordable, especially for the area. Thanks to the Herb Box!"}
{"text":"Short story -  Very good mostly locally sourced quality food. They offer a mostly healthy vegetable focused menu. The problems I encountered here were all due to POOR Management. They send the food out possibly missing whatever and don't tell you.  Long story- We started with the Vegan Nosh Board. The board was made of four vegetable dishes that were all delicious but one of the dishes called Edamame Hummus didn't actually contain any hummus. If my server was trained correctly she would have told me that they were out of hummus. I was expecting hummus since it was on the menu. It wasn't a deal breaker so I didn't say anything. After I dined there I noticed the board I received is at least 1/2 the size of what other Yelpers have posted. I don't know if they cut back the portions they serve or if someone in the kitchen ripped me?  The Nosh Board was very light and we had room for another appetizer. We picked The Smoked Trout Benegts (spelled this way) At first I didn't like them because they were very strong with smoke but I have to admit with the Roasted Red Pepper Aioli they became delicious....The PROBLEM here is that my plate was MISSING the cornichons that it was suppose to have.  I don't know if the server just took the plate out not caring if it was done or If the restaurant was out of cornichons. Either way my server should have told me so I can make the decision to order something else if I want to.   We also shared the beef salad that was very good and as far as I know contained everything it suppose to have.  I DID contact the restaurant and sent them photos of the food I received and waited 5 days to post this review hoping for a reply to hear their side. Nobody from the restaurant contacted me.   That's how the management rolls."}
{"text":"Best place to have lunch in the NE valley. Never has disappointed. And when the weather is nice and they open up, the patio and bar are so nice.  Food is fresh and great, service is always with a smile, the only downside is the wait sometimes. Try it, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Really cool place.  We didn't get great service, but much to the restaurant's credit, they immediately recognized it and comped our meal.  Great food and desserts."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite happy hour spot!! They have happy hour M - Sat from 3-6pm. Awesome select specialty cocktails, beers and wine for $5. Also select menu items for $5 and $8. I also love their brunch. I've probably eaten here 10 times and never have had a bad meal."}
{"text":"Num, num, num....nummy!  Yay an Herb Box is Finally in the hood!  So excited to have easy access to their Red Velvet Pancakes and multitude of other goodies only they do so well.  Downplayed decor puts the new joints focus on the food....as it should be.  Still, cute digs.  Indoor outdoor seating.  Outdoor is great without making you feel like you are on the street due to greenery and lattices.  Staff is helpful, super friendly.  Gotta go, my cakes are calling!"}
{"text":"The butternut squash enchiladas are very tasty and the salad served with the dish is the perfect side. Fresh and yummy!"}
{"text":"I stopped by the herb box just to grab drinks with a few friends.  The restaurant's decor is nice.  It hasn't changed that much since it was the estate house though.  But I liked it then too!  It looks perfect for outdoor eating.  The bartender was very nice and took pictures of the group for us along with others from the staff.  My friend was very excited at how nice the bathrooms are! LOL."}
{"text":"This place is as good as it gets! We came here for brunch this morning and everything from the service, to the food and the Mango! mimosas was excellent ! The whole restaurant's windows are open so it feels like one giant patio.  This is the ultimate brunch spot ! Cool tunes too !"}
{"text":"What a beautiful location! Outside seating is so relaxing it makes you want to spend the day there. The menu is innovative and modern. Many vegetarian and gluten free options. My husband had the Cuban which he said was the best sandwich he has ever had. I had the butternut squash enchiladas which were rich and flavorful. Even my side salad was exceptional! Can't wait to come back and try more of the menu."}
{"text":"Flippin' delicious.  This place is a foodie's dream come true. I had the blackened salmon plate, with salad greenery, pita and tzatski sauce (or however you spell that)  The blackened salmon was heavenly, nice and spicy, and cooked perfectly.....  combine that with all the other elements on the plate.... YUM.  I'll be back, becuase I really did want to try like 10 other items on the menu."}
{"text":"They have AMAZING teas and food! Mix any of the teas with Mango and it's awesome! The workers are so nice and the vibe inside and out is really cool and relaxing!"}
{"text":"I liked the atmosphere in here and like a few people mentioned before me it does feel like you're in a Crate and Barrel store . Behind me was a series of Pinocchio sketches which made my company remark that perhaps it was indicative of my extensions of reality ! Lol ! The place is very cute and comfy and I really enjoyed the atmosphere of the place.  The waitress ( I think her name may have been Cynthia? ) was very knowledgeable and responsive. We never went more than half way with our waters and out drink requests were always prompt I had a salad of some sort and they were kind enough to accommodate my requests for substitutions and omissions on the salad . The desert was equally scrumptious and was devoured almost instantly ! All in all a very pleasant experience, and I look forward to coming back sooner than later"}
{"text":"Had an outstanding meal: orange-cardamon glazed salmon, sauteed sugar snap peas & carmelized fennel chervil, topped by lemon meringue icebox pie with pecan crust.  All were terrific! The enthusiatic server, Eric, was delightful, and extremely helpful with his suggestions. And being seated outside by the canal, as the sun set next to Camelback Mountain, it was all just great evening."}
{"text":"Nice spot for lunch or dinner. Ryan the manager always goes out of his way for you. Never had a bad meal and I have been here well over 100 times. Some items are just better than others. Ask for the asparagus in your Bloody Mary."}
{"text":"Ughhh. Don't come mid week for lunch. 20 minute wait, 20 minutes to get a drink,  we've been here over an hour now and still haven't gotten out entry. The manager is flying around with a horrific scowl on her face like a lunatic.  I'd let you know how the food is but it still hasn't come."}
{"text":"Loved this place. Small but unique and diverse menu. The restaurant has a really near look to it, the nicest public rest room I have ever seen and the servers bend over backwards to be accommodating. Parking is easy too and there isn't much of a wait.  This one definitely stays on my list of go to brunch spots."}
{"text":"This was a real disappointment after going to the one in old town. The brunch menu is not as good and it lacks a lot of the atmosphere."}
{"text":"It's a very difficult task to stand out along the crowded waterfront. The few times I've been have been great but not quite great enough to take time away from its neighbors.   The concept is there and I will continue to patronize it in search of a fifth star and some more fingerling potatoes."}
{"text":"What a disappointment. Have been on other occasions and I don't ever recall the service being so poor or the meals being so expensive!! Two cocktails, an appetizer, 2 salads and it was $80!!! What!! We just had the same meal the day before at 5th and wine for half the cost with better service! Back to Herb Box...great atmosphere! Liked the flavor of the appetizer Avocado Love but all the stems on the arugula were distracting & unpleasant. We both had salads. My friend had the Shrimp & Avocado salad with similar salad garnishing the appetizer which our distant & unpleasant service fore warned. But on the upside the shrimp was tasty!My Steak salad had a small very tough. The flavor was good but again like the other salad both were filled with Stems!! Arugula on hers and watercress on mine...the photo was only half of the stems I picked out trying to enjoy the salad. Our Bloody Mary's were the best part of the meal! When I mentioned politely about the stems in both salads and showed her our discarded stems she shrugged & walked off! Insult to injury the lunch was the most expensive lunch I have had and a truly disappointing one!! 5th & Wine, Olive & Ivy, Sauce or several others within walking distance cost you less than $80 without tip. I don't mind paying that much if the food & service warrant but we paid a lot for lettuce stems...and it wasn't adjusted off the bill at end/ at least one should have been complimentary"}
{"text":"After recommendations from friends and a review of the menu, The Herb Box was my first stop on my long list when visiting Scottsdale. Downtown area is cute and the restaurant was easy to find on the second floor. I was starving after a long morning traveling and met a few friends at the front door. We walked in, received glances from three different servers, and yet after 7 minutes we still stood there unattended. One more time a waiter walked right past us and without an invite to sit down, we promptly walked out. What's good food without service?   Justin and Adam from the Marketplace, on the first floor, were the two star saving grace. Forget the dine-in experience and just stop in and order from the Marketplace. Service there is sure to be great and the options are just the same with some extra benefits. Perfect stop for lunch or brunch too."}
{"text":"Wow. What an experience! The beginning was a tad bit difficult bc I couldn't find the host desk but it was smooth sailing afterwards. Food and drinks were top drawer! The service from our waiter, Matt, was Excellent! A very good job. Inhad the chiliqules and Damn! They put my mims cooking to shame! Great job! My favorite part was the music amd ambience"}
{"text":"I'd love this place for its relaxing garden ambiance alone. Go to the full dining restaurant and eat indoors or pick up a few dishes from the deli area downstairs.  The downstair area does not have the full menu, but is designed to get a quick take out bite.  There is a nice little patio (complete with comfy chairs and misters), which is perfect for lunch when weather is good.  No matter where you dine--the food is healthy and tasty, plus moderately priced. Check out their Jasmine Green Tea for something refreshing--it is perfect sipping for a hot summer day. The dessert menu is extra tempting, but I have viciously beat back my sugar cravings and declined to give them a try.  If I ever order a dessert, I will revise this review and add my thoughts.    Parking is meh. It's old town Scottsdale, so good luck there. But if you find a spot, this place is near the canal and there is nice walking to be had after eating."}
{"text":"My family tried this eatery for the first time today -- Father's Day. The menu was intriguing, and it didn't disappoint. Others had tasty dishes/salads, but hands down I had the best from the Brunch Menu under Grill, which was the Thai BBQ Ribs with Smoked Gouda Mac and Green Apple-Jicama Slaw. You could split this meal or share as I did! I was pleased with the level of flavors and took the suggestion of a Shared Plate with Korean Fried Cauliflower."}
{"text":"This is my favorite lunch in old town. They have a terrific lunch special where you can get a main entree and then two sides. The ingredients are fresh and results in a lunch that is pretty hard to beat. I'll usually swing by at least a few times each week. The workers are also friendly and help with suggestions. My favorite lunch combo is the blackened salmon, smoked Goss mac and cheese, and the orzo pasta salad. The prices aren't cheap, but they are comparable to the other restaurants in old town."}
{"text":"So disappointed in this place. Been going for years but the food is inferior and the wait staff and others hustled us out quickly. We will not be back. So sad."}
{"text":"Don't miss this place. Amazing vegetarian selection.  The crispy Brussels sprouts are absolutely delicious and a must.  The crispy chicken bacon sandwich is divine."}
{"text":"This is a very tasty place with fresh, local ingredients rather than a super healthy place.  It had far fewer vegetarian/pescetarian options than I expected, but still plenty of tasty choices.  Everything is delicious, and the trendy atmosphere, friendly waitstaff and beautiful patio round out an excellent experience.    I love the Portobello Manchego burger - it's postively bursting with flavor and comes with a giant side of humus.  We've also had the sweet potato tacos (delicious! but a smallish portion size for the price and lack of meat/fish).  The mac and cheese is really lovely and gourmet, and fingerling potato salad is delicious (although, don't expect a \"salad\" - see photo).  Our vegan friend has thoroughly enjoyed the nosh board (note:the pitas at HB aren't vegan and they don't come with the nosh board, but if you're vegan, you can't order some on the side).    I haven't tried the enchiladas and the salmon dish looks fancy (but has a fancy price to match), so there are only a few things that I can order.  As a result, I can't come here very often for dinner.  Looking forward to trying brunch sometime soon.  PS The ladies restroom is worth a visit!"}
{"text":"I want to be clear that I am just reviewing the lunch I had yesterday with my mom. Open Table wasn't working Sat evening for Sunday reservations so I called Sunday morning to reserve a table for 2 at 12:30. We arrived close to 12pm. Our table was empty but we weren't allowed to sit because we were too early. I have a cast on my leg and basically had to beg to get permission to sit down at our table and wait. The host said we would be allowed to order our lunch at 12:15. However even though we asked our waiter for tea at 12:15 he refused to bring it until 12:30. Our meal arrived at 1:20 and was ice cold, like it had been taken out of the fridge. And my eggs cooked improperly. So disappointing. There was only an acting manager on and she said they didn't have enough staff. They still could have let us sit at our table without a problem and brought us some tea. And my meal didn't need to be poorly cooked and ice cold. They offered to comp our meal but that didn't make me feel like I want to go back."}
{"text":"My husband and I returned to The Herb Box for dinner two days after our first visit.  This time I had the gluten-free Butternut Squash and Corn Enchiladas, which were delicious and satisfying, with a perfect tomatillo sauce.  My husband loved his New York Strip with demi-glace, gorgonzola, green bean & fingerling potato salad w/ red onion, celery & fennel.  For dessert we had a very nice gluten-free lemon meringue pie. Yum!  The cocktail menu is inventive, and we both enjoyed deliciously unique drinks.  The wine menu offers a good variety of foreign wines, but it would be nice to see some nice domestic options, as well.  Once again the service was lovely (thank you, Eric H.!), and the ambience was intimate and relaxing.  We  are looking forward to our return to Scottsdale to sample more of the menu."}
{"text":"Make sure Paul is your bartender! Very personable and fun to talk to. He made me an amazing pink drink that wasn't even on the menu. Wish he had a name for it so I could send all my friends in to order it. Great place, good atmosphere and amazing drunk and food. Thanks Paul!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately - our visit to The Herb Box fell short of our expectations.  And that's mainly due to the service that was terribly slow.  We were seated on the patio - which we love - but our server seemingly forgot about us throughout the evening.  It probably took 20 minutes just to get the initial drink order placed, and the service slowed down from there - to the point that I had to go track the server down just to get our check.  At which point the server uttered the words I abhor hearing:  'I'm sorry - but the restaurant just got slammed with customers.'  Which - when translated means - 'I'm sorry - but you're not as important as other customers.'  But even her excuse wasn't true - because as we had a vantage point from the patio - there was no rush of customers to the restaurant.  The food was pretty good - but somewhat overpriced."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. We came for brunch so it wasn't busy. As we were leaving it started to get more crowded (around noon).   We ordered the salmon hash (the salmon was excellent), baby kale omelette which came with the best Brie, the buckwheat pancakes (the maple syrup was so good), and the potato fingerlings with a yummy sauce."}
{"text":"They have short brunch hours on Saturdays, so we missed the mark unfortunately, however, the lunch menu looked devine so we opted to dine nonetheless.   The patio at the DC ranch location is lovely! Lots of greenery, sun, and shade. That said, service was really slow and our server was ragging on their vegan/gluten free food... Like really, do you know what city you're in and what restaurant you work at??? Just set the tone in addition to zero menu knowledge or interest in anything other than their simplilist options. Took about 15 min to place a drink order and another 15 to receive anything other than water.  We started with the vegan nosh board, which we anticipated to be something like a varied bruchetta app, not so! It was a collection of random items that I guess we're vegan. It was pretty good but the kale chips were lightyears ahead of the other \"noshes\".   For entree, I had the spicy shrimp salad. First off, nothing spicy  or salad about it besides the arugala that topped 2 gross crostinis slathered in flavorless mayo avocado mixture and a couple of fried shrimp. Yuck! Def not what I was expecting. In Scottsdale of all places, you def can't just throw something green on a plate and call it a salad. In addition to the incredibly misleading menu description (no mention of the shrimp being fried), the dish was not well thought out because it was impossible to actually eat. Like I literally didn't know where to start. I was embarrassed to be eating it in public.   My friend had a chicken sandwich. She also was not expecting it to be fried, but it was. She asked for an extra side of aioli for her sandwich and the waiter brought a chipotle one instead of the pesto aioli that it was supposed to be served with. I tried the Mac and cheese. It was good but very strong smoke flavor. A little much for a spot of lunch after a morning hike.   Overall, won't come back for anything other than brunch, and definitely won't trust recos from their disjointed and ambivalent waitstaff."}
{"text":"Yes it's a little pricey but definitely worth it for a treat!  We had the avocado toast appetizer which we all enjoyed, and I had the shrimp salad, which was more like an open faced sandwich. It was delicious but a few more shrimp would have been nice!  I also tried bites of the butternut squash enchiladas and fried chicken, and all were very good. We were there on a Sunday evening and there was only one other group in there and the service was very attentive and helpful. Looking forward to our next trip!"}
{"text":"Man, this is place has got some class. Although, I was out there after my hike with dirty boots.  Ordered -  Avocado Love: A shared plate. Avocado, arugula and pickled radish on wheat bread. Tasted so yum and you will die for it. Sweet potato baja bowl : quantity is very low but taste makes up for it.  Okay, I also had a blonde beer. Best \"classy\" brunch  places I ever visited I could say."}
{"text":"What a great place. My family and I reserved the private room in the Old Town Scottsdale location for a family event and it could not have been better.  The decor in the room is great (I loved the paint color!) and it was a nice atmosphere for a family gathering.  They have a great selection of wine, beer, and cocktails. I'm pregnant and they even had a great mango juice for me. The starters would have been a great dinner on their own. The pear and gorgonzola flatbread was my favorite.   Entrees were great. I'm a vegetarian and had the squash and corn enchiladas, which were delicious and the side salad was interesting enough to stand on its own. My very carnivorous family also loved their various entrees.  Most of all, I want to complement the incredible service. We were gathering because of a death in the family and the server could not have been more sensitive and graceful coming into a private room in the midst of sad stories and tears. That guy deserves a medal.  Also, given the huge amount of food and alcohol we ordered, the gratuity that was already in the bill, and the private room, the price was very reasonable. I expected to pay easily double what we ended up paying.  Highly recommend. Will definitely go next time I'm in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Having gone to the now-closed location on Shea, I didn't expect to find myself at the new The Herb Box anytime soon.  My one visit was fine, but didn't leave me wanting more.  However, when Deb L hosted a recent UYE, it was the perfect opportunity for great company at the very least.  Well I'm happy to report I received even more than great company....great food, great service, and comfortable, yet beautiful surroundings were also on the plate.    I began the evening with a glass of their house-made sangria.  I could drink this light and fruity beverage all day.  In fact, I think it would make a fine substitute for my morning OJ.  I did have a hard time choosing an entree.  While I was tempted by the pear and gorgonzola flatbread, I chose the goat-cheese chicken instead.  The shoulder cut chicken was perfectly cooked, but the meat itself was perhaps a little bland, although admittedly I do prefer chicken to be well-seasoned.  The goat cheese stuffing and the fig jam, however, resulted in an overall quite tasty dish.  I loved the mushroom risotto cakes served alongside!!  The Herb Box also graciously offered our table a variety of sweet treats at the end of the meal...a slice of fig bundt cake (my favorite), a couple different cupcakes, a whoopie pie, and a passionfruit cake.  While all were enjoyed, none of these wowed me.  I do think these may have been pastries available at the market, and not their dessert menu items.     So thanks to Deb for giving me a reason to try The Herb Box.  I'm sure I will be back again!  I didn't get a chance to browse the market!"}
{"text":"Herb Box is always a comfortable place to go with nice atmosphere and service. This was the first time having breakfast for me. I went with the scrambled eggs and bacon breakfast. I would know what to say if scrambled eggs are bad, but when they're  good, they're good. These were good. The bacon was crispy good and the toast was great. I'll give credit to the jam. The negative part of my breakfast was when my very friendly and efficient server filled my empty coffee cup with more coffee and I didn't realize it. I pulled it toward me and spilled it all over. No star deduction for customer error."}
{"text":"I've stopped here on numerous occasions after hiking Tom's Thumb area. The patio is gorgeous and it's always great to stop by and get bloody marys and relax. So yes, this is a brunch only review!   The chiliquiles verde was pretty good, and red velvet pancakes with bacon was pretty \"sweet,\" no pun intended. What really stood out to me the last time was the smoked salmon hash. I'm not sure if it's because the dish has pancetta bacon or the fried capers that bring out the flavor but I have cravings for it on Sunday mornings now. I'm always worried ordering fish at restaurants because it tends to come out over cooked but with smoked salmon, it's safe to say it stays tender in this hash and I'd order it again and again.   If you just want an app and not a full dish after working out, the cilantro like crab dip is a treat. Don't worry, it's really crab in this dip and the chips are actually chili lime salted thin crispy plantains. Order this. You will tremendously enjoy it. (Well unless you don't like bananas and or plantains..)"}
{"text":"This is a great healthy option. The baby back ribs are mouthwatering. My husband said \"I'm trying not to lick my fingers...\" my salmon was cooked to perfect and it was a very pretty dish. Too bad we are from out of town...we would definitely be back. Plus our server was hilarious and passion about the food."}
{"text":"Great food and awesome ambience. Portions are small, but their happy hour is worth it. They have happy hour everyday, 365 days of the year! Take advantage of it."}
{"text":"Loved the chicken pesto sandwich!! Everything was so fresh and delicious! Definitely sit outside! The trees have lanterns in them and you can People watch on the river walk."}
{"text":"Whenever we come to Phoenix, where to dine for dinner is a major decision. We are always relying on our friend Ryan to make the choice based on all the best places he has been to since our last trip out and then taking us to his favorite.    Ryan tripped us up a bit this time by providing us a list and making us choose from some that he had been to and some he has been wanting to go to.  After about an hour and a half of careful menu reviewing by the three of us we picked The Herb Box.  Had I gone down the list in 5 minutes it would not have been my first choice and I think the other two of us felt the same.  We made our final decision based on the menu seemingly being able to quench our three very different moods for chicken, steak and something different.   We arrived to an upscale looking place that really surprised us with elegant seating and our table was perfectly positioned near a welcoming fireplace.  The next best surprise, A honest server with a more exotic opinion on taste who was not afraid to add her own commentary, which I appreciate.  We started with shared plates and upon our servers suggestion we had the Korean fried cauliflower dish and the indian kale and corn pakora. I definitely left with a new found love of cauliflower and kale.    Ryan was pretty much bent on the Korean barbeque ribs from the moment we picked the restaurant and was really happy he made that choice.  Michael was talked out of the buttermilk chicken by our server based on her saying it was good but not as expressive as the more flavorful choices on the menu that highlight the chef's choices to mix unique flavors.  He ended up choosing the ribeye along with me, my choice the minute I read thru the menu.  The queso blanco and cilantro lime gave the perfectly cooked ribeye an extra special boost.  We also shared the crisp fingerling potatoes sprinkled with course salt and the skillet corn and leek gratin.  I was excited about the corn and blown away by the potatoes.  I am not a connoisseur of mac n cheese by any means but will never refuse a taste from someone else's plate to make sure that my life doesn't end without having possibly tasted \"The one redeeming recipe\" that actually validates the existence of that dish.  I tasted Ryan's and thought to myself, \"wow, I could eat a dish of that,\" it was very good.  The Herb Box was really enjoyed by all of us and we were very happy we went there.  Definitely one of the weekend highlights!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here on way towards airport for lunch after a nice 5 day vacation back in March. Worth every penny. Beautiful patio. Food was stellar. Some nice, unique items on the menu. Really enjoyed and will return next time we head to AZ."}
{"text":"It's official ... I love The Herb Box. Been here for lunch, been here for brunch, you can't go wrong.  There are still quite a few things on their menu I want to try... Blue cheese stuffed Queen Creek olives? Yes please!  Their smoked gouda mac n cheese is super tasty and I'm not even a mac n cheese fan.  Those crispy fingerling potatoes are to die for!  Their brunch offers red velvet pancakes which are delectable... The Chilequiles were some of the best I've had. Oh! Did I mention you can do bottomless mimosas or bloodies with an entree for $24 at brunch?   It's a yum-yum-yummy option any day!"}
{"text":"Medical Marijuana is a reality in Arizona but you won't need a prescription to get a little \"Herb\" in old Town. As of January 1st 2011, The Herb Box Southbridge is open and serving up signature dishes to satisfy your munchies.  Helmed by Chef Becky Windels and business partner Susan Smederovac-Wilcox, the Southbridge location combines the catering division previously located further North with a new Market serving an extensive selection of farm fresh salads, soups, signature sandwiches and specials all prepared with fresh, local produce. (I even have it on good authority that neighborhood residents will be able to pick up staples like milk, important as there isn't a supermarket or convenience store in the immediate area).  The menu at The Herb Box Southbridge is virtually identical to that at the DC Ranch location I've written about previously, all fresh, all tasty.  Todays meal, pancetta wrapped shrimp served on a bed of mixed greens. This is one of my favorite plates on the menu.  Salty pancetta adds the perfect texture to plump shrimp and the blackberry wasabi reduction drizzled over it is just plain delicious (sweet with just the right amount of bite at the finish).  Next up, Smoked BBQ Chicken flat bread. Though the menu would lead you to believe the chicken is \"smoked,\" I would certainly disagree.  What I will say is that it's perfectly grilled, the crunchy bacon, sweet tomatoes, red onions and Gouda are a perfect compliment, but the organic greens perched atop, though tasty, just don't work for me on this item. (though it should be said, I generally don't love salad greens on anything more than sandwiches).  All in all, I'm excited that Old Town's first Herb dispensary is open for business and would definitely recommend you stopping by the market for a quick grab n go lunch or sitting upstairs in the warm and inviting dining room for a leisurely enjoyed meal.  **Disclaimer:  This visit was pre-opening at a \"mock service\" and was free of charge though this in no way influenced my opinion of the establishment."}
{"text":"I Have a healthy, nearly full term food baby that Chef Becky Windels & The Herb Box restaurant are responsible for!  This quaint little Bistro/cafe' Located on Market Street in Scottsdale's uber chic DC Ranch Area, is a gift to the culinary world.  Having happily enjoyed several of their sweet baked offerings, I decided to give the lunch menu a spin, what followed was a lesson in how to do food right!  Shortly after being seated by a cheerful, smiling hostess our server Maria dropped by to take our drink order and let us know what the day's specials were.  After looking through the menu I settled on the Rosemary Steak Ciabatta sandwich prepared with charred onion, watercress, white cheddar cheese and a Dijon mayonnaise.  A side of the Smoked Gouda Mac N' Cheese with crispy Rosemary breadcrumbs and an order of Crisp Fingerling potatoes sprinkled with sea salt and served with a side of house made red pepper aioli.  While all of this food might be a case of my eyes being bigger than my stomach, I simply couldnt resist trying a little of everything.  After a short wait, the food arrived and I was certain I'd made great choices.  The Steak sandwich was cooked to order, a little short of medium on the softest ciabatta roll I've had, piled high beside it were sweet potato chips dusted with curry powder (why have I never had this before?)  Biting into the sandwich, I experienced the carefully crafted mix of flavors and textures that a great chef strives to achieve.  The steak was juicy and well complimented by the rosemary, crunchy watercress  for added texture and the tanginess of aged white cheddar, all nicely brought together by the Dijon mayo.    The house made sweet potato chips are brightened and brought to life by a deft sprinkling of curry powder making you want to eat more than you should (yes, they sell them to-go and I have a bag atop my fridge for a late night snack!) Let's talk Mac N' Cheese.  I'm going to say it... The Smoked Gouda Mac at The Herb Box is simply the best I've ever had! Creamy cheese and al dente' pasta topped with crunchy rosemary breadcrumbs made this my new favorite dish.  Yes, I know, everyone has a favorite Mac N' Cheese but forget about them!  Try this dish and you will be sold! (I didn't forget to order a portion to-go...I know what's going on at 2 AM when I have the munchies!!)  What's a steak sandwich without potatoes?  Yup, ordered them!  A tasty side of smashed, crisped fingerling potatoes served with a delicious red pepper aioli disappeared just as fast as I could dip and eat! (I can see dropping in for any one of the items I've mentioned so far but together they are DANGEROUS!) okay, clearly I was done eating and in need of both the check and a pillow but enter Maria again who eagerly suggested I try the pistachio ice cream sandwich cookie.  Never one to ignore the recommendation of a foodservice professional, I agreed that I should have one and what came next was wrong in so many ways I'm almost at a loss for words.  Now I've never had pistachio ice cream though I've always heard it was tasty but this was extraordinary.  My mouth and taste buds were assaulted by the flavors of almond, pistachio, strawberries, blackberries and a delicious thick creme', the crunch of the cookies was the perfect counterpoint to the cold soft ice cream and the fruit just completed the sensation.  Think that was the end?  Try again, the dessert case beckons with such a variety of scrumptious looking treats that must be seen to be believed.  If you haven't figured it out by now, I'm a BIG fan of The Herb Box and Chef Becky's Cuisine, if you haven't had the opportunity to visit, make it a point or I assure you, you're missing out!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this location [there's another one in Oldtown] for a few times now. My experience has been vastly different but satisfactory every single time.  I have been served by David or Drew everytime. They are both fantastic!  I was in for a weekday lunch and had the Turkey and Avocado wrap. The peppercinis blended with the lightly seasoned turkey made for a full filling lunch. To top it all off, the sweet potato chips were on point! I still can't figure out if they're baked or fried, because they weren't greasy at all but they weren't burned at all either.  The next time I went after the lunch rush and wanted the wrap again but decided to try the Butternut Squash and Corn Enchiladas since they were so beautifully described by Drew. Best. Decision. EVER. The only bad thing with them is that it was only 2. Please mister, can I have some more? The most recent time, I had a date on a Friday night. The patio is nicely set up and we even had live music. To think of it, the set up inside of the restaurant is just terrible. Was this even built as a restaurant? Some of the tables outside are also crowded, but not as much. I gladly take my chances of getting a crappy table any day in exchange for the food served at the Herb Box. I don't usually take dates out on new places but I wanted to see the HB at night. Best. Decision. Ever. Also.  Once again, I thought I had tried the best thing on the menu until David, our server, made some suggestions upon hearing it was my girl-friend's first time there. I was a little skeptical about the ribs, but I ordered them anyways with David's recommendation. For the lady, she had the Serrano Shrimp Salad. While we waited for the food, we had a bowl of chicken chili and the korean cauliflower. The spicyness due to spices in the chicken were excellent and the korean cauliflower was unique and delightful; who knew you could do that to cauliflower? The bed of white quinoa leveled the spiciness and made it my favorite appetizer.  We could have not gotten better entrees. Every other review on here speaking about the Thai Baby Back Ribs do no justice to how they truly are: A MA ZING. And the Shrimp Salad did not fall behind either, the serrano glaze went great with the shrimp and lemony arugula.  Our meal ended and we were stuffed. David offered some dessert menus and we looked at it 'for fun' or so we thought.. we ordered the Crack Pie and boy is that addicting!  On our way out, we checked out the pastry case inside that David had mentioned. After hearing him describe some of the items we just had to take a few to go! They're gluten free options are unbelievable. I tried a GF brownie and it has been the best brownie I've ever had. The Red Velevet cupcake is great as well, can't go wrong with red velvet! Overall, the restaurant could definitely use some remodeling but it's worth it for the food.  I love this place and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The Worst Experience-EVER Service was extremely slow-over 1 hour to order and get salads.  The lettuce was slightly brown and partially wilted. They left out the bacon, had hardly any cheese and couldn't even taste the dressing. We had to ask for the bacon and more cheese and more dressing. Same for another dish - missing ingredients. We had to ask for the menu back and point out the missing ingredients.  The restrooms were filthy and the restaurant was not even busy.   When we complained to the hostess, she acknowledged the issues and said they had a new chef.   We called the next day to complain to the manager and was told they would call back.  We never received a call back even though we left two additional messages and were told that manager would be notified this has a high priority and would call us \"soon\"  Next step was to send an email to the owner based on their website information. That was a week ago and again, no response.  Until they make a change in management and hire a chef that can prepare the meals correctly, STAY AWAY.    It's sad as this used to be an excellent restaurant."}
{"text":"The Herb Box..  I expected the dishes to have more herbs but nonetheless, it was a great place for a date night with the fiance.   We got the Thai ribs but I would have called it Korean Ribs for it was glazed with some sort of bbq sauces mixed with the Korean pepper taste.   Their cucumber Mojito is very refreshing. I highly recommend it.   Overall, I really liked the place but the food just wasn't as great as I expected. The Butternut Squash and Corn Enchilada was a wasted dish. I couldn't even taste the butternut squash and it was too dry, despite the fact that it was drenched in the sauce.   I think the problem is, the name of the food items are more tasty than the dishes themselves. I personally love true food and vegetables so I might give this place another chance but it was just A-OK.   One positive thing to note is that it really has a romantic ambience and the service is excellent. Seated outside, with the surrounding lights of downtown Scottsdale, I felt like I was in France. So, if you're looking for a good first date place, I would recommend it."}
{"text":"It is just so sad because this place has so much potential. The service IS HORRIBLE. First they told us it was a 20 minute wait when there were literally 12 tables open inside ( we counted), so we decided to sit at the bar- no one greeted us for 10 minutes no menus nothing. Once sat our waitress was not knowledgeable and somewhat rude. Our food took over 25 minutes to come out and it didn't even come out together ( we are a table of five here not a huge party). No water refills, didn't even ask us if we wanted another drink. Food was mediocre at best this time- something going on in the kitchen we were told... soggy toast on the bottom of a salad and no side with the burger.... had to ask another server for the check and then he disappeared. Returned check with all cash gone and credit cards - bill was overpaid and she was not told to keep the change- when we told her said she would look into it and never came back so we left - it left her with a short tip but she didn't even deserve that. I won't be returning here sad to say... used to be one of my favs"}
{"text":"I'm a tad delayed in reviewing as I was there in early December for a work conference. Our group came here for lunch and it was incredible! I can't even remember all the things we sampled. I know we had the vegan app sampler and it was really good. I'm not a huge kale fan, but everything else on it was jammin! The brussels sprout chips, the korean cauliflower, the edamame. So good!!! Almost made me want to be vegan. Ok, not quite, but I did enjoy it.  There were other things people ordered that we all shared. For my entree I ordered the short rib tacos. OMG! They were delicious. And so much food!!! I actually made 4 tacos from the two tacos that were served, and still couldn't eat it all. The ribs were so tender and amazingly delicious. Probably my favorite dish that I ate my whole visit to Scottsdale.  I did also sample someone's butternut squash and corn enchiladas. Again, amazing! Who knew you could make enchiladas out of butternut squash and make them taste sooo good!?!  Our server was really awesome, was able to keep up with all of our requests. I really need to come back here."}
{"text":"My husband & I were one our way to visit my mom at the Honor Health Thompson Peak Medical Center & needed to get a bite to eat.  I Yelped the area & this cute, little bistro popped up.  The menu sounded like a great blend of things we both like, so I made a quick reservation on Open Table.  We were seated promptly upon arrival at a nice table for two on the patio.  It was 1:30 on a Saturday afternoon, so brunch was in full swing.  Our waiter showed up immediately to take our drink orders.  The menu options were so exciting, not just the usual boring brunch items, but healthy & unique offerings.  I LOVED my Serrano-Avocado Shrimp Salad!!  Grilled shrimp nestled in a salad of arugula with grilled fennel & Sweet-hot serrano glazed pancetta tossed with a lemon-honey vinaigrette served on avocado toast. Delish!!  My husband LOVED his Breakfast Steak & Eggs.  A 5 oz tenderloin with an Ancho Bourbon Demi served with Crispy Fingerling Potatoes & a yummy aioli.  His over easy eggs were cooked perfectly.  We thoroughly enjoyed everything about this delightful place & are looking forward to hitting the Old Town Scottsdale location when we come back in town on our annual March vacation!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately I originally judged this book by its cover...  The menu was loaded with all my favorite combinations of flavors, and the sort of creative twists that I look for at brunch spots, plus they boasted using quality/local/organic ingredients. To make it better the decor was modern, the energy seemed high, beautiful outdoor seating, and live music.  However, the food didn't live up. It seems like they scouted a bunch of cool west coast restaurants, crafted a menu using all of their ingredients, but don't really know how to capitalize? Or maybe they are just using buzz words to appeal to people who read healthy food blogs? I dunno... to be fair, maybe I miss-ordered, the sandwiches looked good, anyway...  The \"Market Sunflower Salad\", was literally a huge bowl of the most unappetizing, lifeless, romaine lettuce I have ever seen, with a skimpy handful of seeds and dried fruits--the kind that restaurants in the midwest use during the winter because they are an inexpensive non-perishable way to give their salads a bit of color. The goat cheese was near non-existent. The chicken breast actually looked pretty good... which makes sense, because for $15 you had better get something worth eating.  \"Sweet Potato Avocado Baja Bowl\" ...boasting roasted sweet potatoes, avocado, queso, fried plantains, quinoa, and a creamy jalapeno avocado dressing... a combo of some of my favorite things in a bowl? How could I resist.  Wow... was this depressing. Now to defend the infant sized portion I was given (for $13), I will concede that maybe it is meant for like dieting vegans? However, if that is the case... the waiter should inform people of that. It was literally a spoonful of each ingredient. Luckily I added a fried egg (to make it more breakfasty), either way I had to stop on the way home to get a real meal. Also... don't be fooled by the delicious wording \"rosemary coriander roasted sweet potatoes\" ... I got a dozen tiny sticks of nearly raw sweet potatoes--no flavor to speak of. Also the creamy dressing that sounded so enticing, hardly made the scene.  \"Bourbon-Ginger Peach Brioche French Toast\" ....OH MAN HOW COULD WE NOT GET IT! Especially based on the awesome yelp photos. So we order it, we get the standard 4 piece plate, only we must have gotten there when the kitchen was starting a new budget? We got 4 tiny squares of (canned????) peaches on top, and a helplessly minimal drizzle of the cream (which I can't say for certain, but highly doubt has anything to do with creme fraiche). The \"bourbon ginger\" flavors didn't have much to say... but I will say that the texture and richness of the actual toast was pretty good.  To top things off... the waitstaff seemed like they had been plucked off the streets (obviously I can only speak for a couple). Honestly not a big deal, they were all EXTREMELY nice and helpful, but just clearly had not been waiting tables for long. Which like I said, doesn't bother me normally... but at this sort of price tag, you expect the eatery to be putting a little more effort into curating their team.  Conclusion...  It seems like a spot that has created an atmosphere and menu that capitalizes on as many current trends as possible, with the end goal to make people feel like they are at some edgy eatery where the high price tag is matched with top-notch quality. The problem is that you can't just give your dishes cool names, you need to have the culinary innovativeness to bring the unique flavors/ingredients to life! And I just didn't feel that here...  If your looking for a locally-inspired/inventive/hip/edgy/modern/American-new style meal... take your hard earned cash elsewhere.  If your looking for a good sandwich and are already in the area.. check this place out."}
{"text":"This place is hit or miss. I love the food, the menu has a great selection, however I have had some bad experiences here. I took my mom here one afternoon and the service was horrible, we sat at our table and waited forever before we even got water and when we finally got our food it was cold. I have been here before and usually have good experiences so I'll let this one go and give them a try again"}
{"text":"Herb Box tops my list for one of my favorite locations for lunchtime or dinnertime dining, but just recently I experienced Sunday brunch here for the first time. This is definitely a reasonably priced Sunday brunch option. In fact, it's the same price as it is any other time during the week, but on Sunday, in addition to several lunch items, they also offer breakfast options such as Cinnamon pancakes, Market BLTs, breakfast flat breads, goat cheese omelets. While sitting out on the patio and enjoying the breezy late morning environment (they open at 11 on Sundays), I enjoyed the Market BLT which was a fried egg topped with pancetta, ricotta and served on brioche. I only ate about half of the bread it was served on because it was such a large portion, but the meal was pretty good. I would have liked it to come with some fruit but I'll know to ask for that next time. I noticed a dog sitting on the patio, which made me wonder if they have a dog friendly patio. I will look into this and report back because I know a certain cockapoo in my life named Harley who would have enjoyed this morning meal as well!"}
{"text":"Herb Box is always delicious and meow, I can add a delicious breakfast experience to my repertoire! While in DC Ranch during the breakfast hour, I was happy to learn that the DC Ranch Herb Box location serves breakfast on both Saturday and Sunday (not just Sunday like the Old Town location). I ordered the breakfast burrito with egg whites and avocado. The meal was fresh and filling but not overly heavy. The environment is casual but classy and perfect for any type of diner, whether it be a family or friends. When the weather's nice, they have the perfect patio where you can enjoy a Mimosa with your meal!"}
{"text":"First we are sitting outside in March. Lovely.  I will tell you about the food after we eat.  Oh my how time flies.  It has been awhile since our visit to Scottsdale and I wish I were there right now.  Good thing it is nice and sunny here in Colorado.  My husband and I had a nice meal here.  I had the shrimp salad and a glass of white wine.  He had a sandwich but honestly do not remember which one it was.  The best part of the afternoon was it was a warm day there and I do believe it was snowing in Colorado.    The service was great and there were plenty of choices to choose from.  The building is nice and it is right on the outskirts of Old Towne.  Great shopping close by and one of my favorite malls is just around the corner.  I would say one perfect day in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"The short ribs tacos are amazing. It's a great option for people on GF diets. It was really hard to choose from the menu. It all sounded wonderful. And you've gotta love a place that offers prosecco on the lunch menu."}
{"text":"Great watering hole after five miles of hiking in the McDowells.  Cool breeze on the patio  Oak Creek Honey Nut Brown - tall thin glass  Turkey and avocado wrap - tasty with ripe avocado  Best Part: sweet potato chips - non salty, convoluted shapes, great color"}
{"text":"I normally love this place. The food and service are great. However, today is the time I have ever got take out from here. The salads were less than half the size they are when you order them in the restaurant. It's very disappointing."}
{"text":"first time and not really impressed.  first they were going to stick us in a corner near a large table and we said no.  then we were somewhat in the center of everything and  ok.  the service was poor.  not very attentive.  no reason to be ignored.  food was not as ordered.  eggs over cooked.  may go back"}
{"text":"The food is exquisite. Hostesses are great. Waiters and Waitresses are superb. The manager NOT so much. You can't have bad service and leave your customer unhappy just because you don't want to accommodate them. Basically they didn't want to take out shallots and onions from my dish while they did it several times before.. Unacceptable and Rude. Your supposed to bend over backwards to make your customer happy."}
{"text":"Food was very good.  Loved the cauliflower appetizer dish and the butternut squash and corn enchiladas.   I personally wasn't to crazy about the sweet potato Avocado Baja bowl but my husband enjoyed.  Ordered the blackberry mojoito and it wasn't my fav.  Overall two thumbs up for both good and service!"}
{"text":"I drove up to this part of town to meet a friend from back home for lunch.  At first glance, the exterior and patio are really nice.  We sat at the bar inside with a great open air view of outside.  The food was good and the menu had a wide variety of options.  I look forward to dropping back in on this place again at happy hour in the cooler months."}
{"text":"Food is great and love almost everything I've had.  Ribs to die for.  Service a bit slow as they seem to be understaffed alot"}
{"text":"we have heard so many great things about this place and it lived up to every expectation. even the decor is very cool, with exposed white washed beams and flooring, kind of farm-ish, but not in a country-chickens-haybales-cracker barrel way.   it was super busy and we had to wait about 25 minutes to be seated. everything on the menu looked awesome. i finally settled for the sweet potato tacos and they were just the right texture of soft, sweet, salty, and a tad crunchy. my wife had the veggie hummus pita wrap and it was as well, over the top delicious. i was extremely fond of the sweet potato chips that came with the dish. i also ordered the mac n cheese, and it was nice and stinky and rich and creamy...mmmm.  our server, although busy, spent a minute or two just chatting with us and kept our water glasses filled. we topped it off with a cup of coffee, which surprisingly, was good as well.   i can't wait to come back here. i'm glad we finally checked this place out."}
{"text":"Love this place. I bring a lot of clients here, and the menu always pleases them. I like their chicken salads and wraps. Sitting outside on a nice day is nice. And they have a cool brunch menu on the weekends."}
{"text":"Adequate food but very unpleasant experience . A table of about 10 people was drinking and shouting so loud that it was impossible to carry on a conversation. I have never found noise annoying much less complained about it. The manager asked what she could do, and I suggested asking the table to tone it down might be in order. Response: I'm not allowed to do that (which is nonsense). I got our check and left. If you go, bring a book because you will not be able to talk. It's some consolation that no one was throwing food with the hapless manager on duty.   UPDATE: I later received a demand that I remove this review from what I suspect to be a bogus account, which also posted a counter-review.  The person posted that I was \"really upset,\" and anyone who knows me knows that's just not how I work.  I smiled throughout and even left the server a correct 20% tip.  Moreover, there were no tables next to us, and it was so loud it would have been impossible for anyone to overhear my discussion with the manager, who had to lean down to our table so we could hear each other.  I stand by the accuracy of my review."}
{"text":"While visiting my son in AZ we decided to stop in here for dinner. It wasn't too busy (day after Thanksgiving) and the weather was nice so we sat on the patio. The patio is really nice.  Mgr Eric was very accommodating, making sure they moved a heater over so we could be comfy. I ordered a glass of the Hann Pinot Noir, was smooth & delicious. The waitress was friendly but I didn't get her name. My son ordered the Ribs and she recommended the sweet potatoe enchilada's for me...she said it was her fav vegetarian dish on the menu. It didn't disappoint. My son loved loved loved the Ribs, made asian with sauce he said was amazing. I probably would have licked the plate but I didnt' want to embarrass my son, lol. Will most certainly come back when I'm in town..."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  love the food!!  The general manager is awesome and very attentive!  You can either have a fast casual dining in there market down stairs or have a great fine dining service upstairs!  Grow happy salad is great, they make all the pastries and food from scratch! So good!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite go to restaurants!  The food is always delicious and the service is always excellent!   Today I ordered Avacado love as a take home (cuz it is soooo tasty, I wanted herb box food twice today)! It is a great appetizer with an awesome blend of sweet and spicy!   I ordered the butternut squash corn enchiladas. It was an excellent blend of flavors and came with a nice sized salad. It was all very tasty!   My friend ordered the sweet potato tacos. This was her first visit and she was impressed that healthy food could taste so good.  The manager stopped by when he heard what my friend ordered and told us that they entered the tacos into a contest and got 2nd place...should have been first! They were that good!  The price is very in line with what I would expect to pay for a healthy meal made with fresh ingredients!"}
{"text":"My friends and I stopped here for lunch, and it was not a great experience. The host stand is in a busy area, and my mom was trying to stand out of the way, but the host came by and literally shooed my mom to get out of his way. It was incredibly rude! We tried to get passed it, sat down and ordered. The food took a long time (we all ordered salads and a veggie bowl), and when it arrived it wasn't right. My friend's salad came with no dressing, and no corn, and my sister's corn was replaced with quinoa. We searched and searched for our waiter, and were finally able to flag down a manager who explained that they were out of corn so it was just left off the salad, and brought dressing. Our waiter should have notified us that they were out of something, and you should not just replace it with another option without asking, especially as someone could have a food allergy. The waiter also flew by once to bring my sister the wrong drink. At the end of the meal the waiter finallllly stopped by once we had paid to confront us for not letting him know we had an issue with our food, and to give us advice for eating at restaurants in the future. We told him we tried to let him know, but we couldn't find him the whole time we were eating. At that point we were really upset, and spoke to the manager who apologized. Our check for 4 salads and tea was $70 and soooo not worth it, especially considering the horrible customer service. We will never be back."}
{"text":"I came here today for breakfast after hiking. There was only one other table here when I sat and one other couple came in before I left. To start, the service was not the quickest. The server told me to pick where I wanted to sit and she would find me. She delivered food to another table before even bringing the menu. The breakfast menu is limited, yet I sat for several minutes before she came to take my order.  I chose the chilaquiles. The flavor on them was really great, but they were several things that were off. I ordered it with the eggs over medium, but the eggs came completely cooked through. Surprisingly though, the whites were still very light and fluffy and not rubbery even though the yolks were cooked through. The pork was dry. This dish was non-traditional with strips of tortilla instead of the full chips, which was nice. I wish there were more salsa (which was amazing) on this dish to help out the pork and to soften the tortilla strips.  No surprise again it took some time to get the bill and pay, even though the restaurant was practically deserted. I got a apple strudel muffin to go to eat later. This too was very dry. About a quarter of the way through the muffin, I found a piece of plastic cooked into the muffin.   I would chalk my issues up to an off-day and try this place again and hope for better results."}
{"text":"This restaurant has a very quaint and seemingly quirky atmosphere but that is the only place where it exceeds expectations. The service here was absolutely horrible. Our waiter had a horrible smell of body odor on a Sunday morning and we waited quite some time to even be greeted. Once we were finally able to order our food, it took over an hour to get it. 4 tables came ordered and had their food before me and my girlfriend got our meal and then when it came out it was delivered to the wrong table. We then had to wait another 20 minutes past that for the food to come out. My girlfriends pancakes were dry and the bacon was horribly under cooked. My sandwich was luke warm and the chips were soggy. After waiting what would usually be my entire length of time spent at a restaurant, all that was done to compensate for the atrocious service was comping a few mimosas and not even a visit from the manager to apologize for the horrible service. All in all the food was lack luster and the service was absolutely ridiculous. I can't speak for the other locations but this one desperately needs some help."}
{"text":"Yum Yum Yum!   I went to Herb Box today for lunch with 3 of my girlfriends and had an absolutely delicious meal! We sat inside in a cute little corner of the restaurant and started with tasty tropical iced tea and enjoyed amazing red pepper hummus and pita chips to start. For my meal I had some kind of a \"sunshine\" or \"sunflower\" salad that had chicken, goat cheese, sunflower seeds, dried strawberries and spinach-it was AMAZING! The actual salad came with Bacon but I took mine without. The main thing I noticed about my meal was how fresh everything was! Not to tip my own hat but I make pretty amazing salad's so its hard for me to justify spending money on one that I can make twice as good at home but honestly The Herb Box did it! Unique fresh flavors and all without me having to whip out my cutting board!   I had been wanting to try this place for so long and I am so excited to have finally taken advantage! I would highly recommend this place for a tasty lunch anytime!"}
{"text":"I'm not ordinarily a pancake person. Actually, I guess I'm not an ORDINARY pancake person. They gotta be special to get my attention (a la Orange Table's jalapeno pecan pancakes).   It's true what they say about the red velvet pancakes here! DELICIOUS! Not too sweet, even though they're chocolate. (Quick tip: order a kid's portion)   The breakfast sandwich could easily serve 2, if not 4!   Enjoying a cheese plate at happy hour is a great way to spend an afternoon.   Service is spotty. Food and ambiance are not."}
{"text":"Great food, comfortable atmosphere.  Been back several times...the Vegan Nosh and veggie tacos are awesome.  Their number one dish is the Butternut Squash Enchilada...very good , but a little dry.  And, the specialty drinks are yummy--try the elderberry margherita.  The setting (at Southbridge in Old Town Scottsdale) is trendy, yet casual...the service is always fantastic.  (p.s.  The menu offers a variety of gluten free dishes)."}
{"text":"Loved this adorable little restaurant for Sunday brunch.  Nice patio outside and I'm pretty sure they had live music but it was in full sun and already crowded when we arrived about 11am. We opted for a table inside right by the open front windows (almost like being outside without the sunburn). I had the red velvet pancakes with mascarpone crème, gran marnier syrup & applewood smoked bacon. Pretty tasty but definitely rich. I'd probably have something a little lighter next time.  My husband had chilaquiles, which he actually makes quite well. He enjoyed them but really wanted them spicier and they were lacking for any kind of Mexican hot sauce (tabasco wasn't really what we had in mind).  Yummy cocktails and delicious ice teas. Pretty friendly service too. Bonus points for gluten-free and other restricted diet options!"}
{"text":"Love the take out food.  Pretty amazing to get this kind of quality to go.  We had some great sandwiches and sides, plus fabulous desserts, and took them back to poolside at our resort and gorged.  The people are super nice and warm...the only downside is it takes a while to get your food, as it is made in the restaurant kitchen.  Of course that is why the food is fresh and amazing...  The restaurant looks killer, totally high style and I'd be happy to eat there, too.  I saw a burger go by that I'm pretty sure winked at me and gave me a come-hither.  Next time..."}
{"text":"All of their food was delicious. The service was great as well. The server was a brunette gentleman with a pony tail and had only been there 4 months, but was trained and polite as if he'd been there for years. I would highly recommend this place to anyone. Sunday happy hour was from 2-4 with $5 apps and discounted drinks."}
{"text":"I love coming here for happy hour. Enjoy a delicious healthy meal in a clean relaxing environment. What's not to love?"}
{"text":"Yay for finding another fantastic restaurant with exciting vegetarian options! This place is great, can't wait to come back. Both the service and food were excellent.  Our server was great, I had never been before and she was friendly and attentive. There was a bit of a wait here, took a while to get our food. I was debating between the Butternut Squash Enchiladas or the Sweet Potato Tacos. Our server recommended the Sweet Potato Tacos, so I ordered those. Sweet potatoes are my favorite vegetable, and I was glad I chose to order the tacos. They were very fresh and flavorful. Herb Box is pricey though! I do get it though, since the ingredients are fresh and whatnot.  I would love to come and try the brunch, these reviews make it sound delicious!"}
{"text":"A three and half stars review really.  The down sides?  Well I get really peeved that there isn't some bread or nibbles on the table. I know we are embracing good health and fresh produce, but a little bread couldn't hurt right? The ambiance is very relaxing, bright and airy.  Reminds me a lot of the decor at Wildflower (The Fox restaurant only in Tucson that makes me sad because its only in Tucson). The menu is varied, you can bring carnivores and folks who think salad are wimps. I do think that the price is about $2.00 over priced for everything.  An appetizer (the only so-so tasty blue cheese stuffed olived that were fried came out to $1.00 per olive which seemed excessive), two entrees (street tacos and a flat bread) with a dessert came out to $50.00 which is expensive in my book for lunch even in Scottsdale. The upside is the dessert really is really tasty.  Had the passionfruit cream filled donuts with a side of coconut sorbet that was out of this world.  The entrees included street tacos which were messy to eat, flavorfull but dare I say \"too juicy?!\"  The flat bread consisted of argula, goat cheese and corn which was a great combination.  All in all, solid but I'd only go back if I was expensing it.  It seems a bit pushy to charge that much for food that is good but doesn't taste too much more decadent than what you can get at Tru  Foods.  (Save the dessert of course!) Oh maybe we are paying for the location, the decor and the really really pretty bathrooms.  Some of the best I've seen in a long time.  Even better than the bathrooms at Modern Steak!"}
{"text":"Herb Box- DC Ranch is my new fav eatery for organic, locally grown, tasty lunches!  Yesterday we took to the kids and started off with their mango (or papaya- I get the two confused) lemonade.  REALLY sweet, but a cool exotic flavor.  BTW, it is great to find a place that welcomes kids without being a true \"kids restaurant\".  Couples, singles, families, you name it- you've got the gamut of customers here.  We had the BBQ Chicken Flat-bread Pizza and Free Range chicken-arugula wrap with candied walnuts and cranberries.  Today (yeah it was so good we had to come back a day later) had the Market Street Tacos- with fillet, fresh avocados, and some sort of what I call \"magic sauce\" while the kids split the turkey on a cibata (sp?) sandwich.    Hooooooly cow!!  Imagine an explosion of flavors (all wonderful) sparking in your mouth at once.  it is like a symphony of flavors- each one distinct yet complementary to the other.  Honest to goodness magic to your taste buds.    Of course a restaurant review could never get 5 stars unless it has great service- which it did.  But it also had a little something extra.  Great atmosphere, AMAZING food, and a highly textured (and blended femininity and masculinity) decor.  And the overall vibe was very cool.  Not too snotty (even though some of the customers are), relaxed, and open feeling push the Herb Box over the top to receive a 5 star rating.    I don't know what they serve (or if they are even open for breakfast or dinner), but for lunch, this is a perfect choice.  Now that I've belatedly discovered the location in DC Ranch (their Shea location had catered for us before), you will see me here more often.  Hopefully you will enjoy it as much as my family and I do!  Best wishes.  Warmly,  Kirin :)"}
{"text":"Great food and comfortable atmosphere. Our extended family sat at an outdoor table for lunch and had:  Kobe Burgers - great Steak Salads - good Potato Skins - yum Short Rib Tacos - so,so  Would go back again."}
{"text":"OMG amazing!  I stopped in here for take-out on Friday - I'm so glad I did.  The food is incredible!  I had a salmon BLT - it was insanely delicious!  From what I saw the atmosphere of the restaurant is fantastic too. I'm going to need to stop by sometime with a date :-)"}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with this place! It's one of my favorite places to have brunch with the girls. One They have one of the best  Red Velvet Pancake, and it comes with bacon!! It's also a plus that they have great service. We held a baby shower for one of my friend a while back,  and the staff were very accommodating."}
{"text":"First let me address the decor. Everyone seems to love it, but I felt like I was eating inside of a Crate and Barrel store. One of the people with me said he felt like he was in a renovated Red Lobster. I do have to say the bathroom had some of the best lighting I've ever seen.  FOOD: All of us ordered the red velvet pancakes after seeing them reviewed on Chow Bella. I'm not really a pancake person, but I wanted to try it since it was something I had never had. They were truly great. Very rich, but very good. The Gran Marnier syrup was my favorite part. I had to ask for more. The bacon was tasty and crisp. I ordered a side of poached eggs. They were just a tad shy of done, too much of a runny white for my taste. And I should have ordered some toast or something to sop up the yolk with.   DRINKS: For their Sunday brunch, you can get any entree and bottomless mimosas, bloody marys, or screwdrivers for $24. The most expensive entree is $15 and the drinks stand-alone are $5, so you would need to have at least 3 drinks to make this a worthwhile \"deal\", but it is brunch. Booze it up.  SERVICE: Spotty. It wasn't really very busy and it was difficult to get the attention of the waitress. We asked for separate checks (I know, scandalous in Scottsdale) but were told that would be no problem. Then the check came as a group. No biggie.  Would definitely go back, but will get the steak and eggs next time."}
{"text":"Walked in with no expectations. Figured this would be a good vegetarian/vegan type spot. Upon entering the whole staff was friendly and very welcoming. The ambience of the place is real solid with high roofs and a bar that stands out. I had the fried edemame and Alvarado bowl. Both were made very fresh and very tasty. Must get the passion fruit tea with a meal. Very quenching. I will definitely be returning and spreading the word. One bad thing is because of the nature of the food it doesn't seem very filling(at least what I ordered). Service was fast and on point."}
{"text":"Nice service and fresh offerings.  Comfortable patio and nice place to meet  friend."}
{"text":"We went to the Herb Box to eat lunch over the weekend after doing some par-oozing through old town.  This has been on our list of \"must try places to dine\" after reading so many fellow Yelper reviews.  It was an awesome start with a few drinks listening some fantastic live music on the patio!  Restaurant ~ the patio is the place to eat if available, especially when they have entertainment.  It's a wrap around patio so there are different options to choose from.  The inside is very nice, somewhat of a north eastern coastal design with comfy chairs unless your stuck with one of the plain wooden chairs. (I know these plain chairs provide more balance to the decor but they are they are not comfy!)    Service ~ was very good, not exceptional but good.  They are very attentive to your drinks however they are not as attentive to your meal after it arrives.    Food ~ 5 stars for freshness!  Everything we ordered was extremely fresh from the salads to the veggies.   We order their Flat-bread with smoked BBQ chicken, bacon, Gouda cheese, organic greens, slice cherry tomato and onions.  It was very good.  The greens on top of the flat bread were tossed lightly in oil and were delish!  Everything on the flat bread was very good however it had too many cherry tomato halves, which were picked off half way through.    We also order the gilled Kobe Feta Burger with lots, and I mean lots! of arugula, grilled onion, with a little bit of red pepper aioli with a side of sweet potato chips.  After pulling off some of the arugula so I could see my succulent kobe beef patty we dug in!  This is a very tasty burger but the feta cheese and aioli were very sparse, almost non existent.  We had to ask for more aioli sauce twice.  The sweet potato chips were very delish and became very addictive to everyone at the table.  We should have ordered more...     We also ordered the smoked Gouda Mac and Cheese with bread crumbs.  This was a miss for us since it lacked the creamy cheesy goodness it should of had but rather it was all pasta with some light shavings of gouda cheese and bread crumbs.  It was very bland and we think there was more bread crumbs than cheese...   The Herb Box seems like a very nice place to dine with friends and family, especially on their patio when they have some entertainment.  We plan to come back for more sweet potato chips and to try something else on their menu.  It is A-OK."}
{"text":"It was our last day in Scottsdale and had a long day of travel ahead. We decided to stop in at the Herb Box because it was a beautiful day out, it was walking distance from the office, and the food looked yummy!  Thank you Yelpers, for this place did not disappoint! We shared the cilantro crab dip - creamy, crabby goodness that had just enough acidity to get our palates going. The plantain chips were an excellent touch - the perfect vehicle for all of that crabby yumminess. I had the burger (medium) on ciabatta. It was cooked perfectly, seasoned perfectly, and had the most amazing apple coleslaw to add crunch, bite, and contrast. These came with sweet potato chips which were absolutely addicting! We also shared a side of the gouda mac and cheese - very cheesy, but surprisingly not heavy at all!  Our server was fantastic! Our waters never emptied, our soda/tea stayed full, and he always checked in at appropriate times. This was the best possible way to end our short trip :)"}
{"text":"BEST RESTAURANT IN AZ!   No but seriously, I could eat every meal here. Chef Becky is amazing and breakfast this morning did not disappoint. I decided to try the Organic Oatmeal and my friend ordered the Red Velvet pancakes. Ok, so you're probably saying \"with all that yummy goodness you ordered oatmeal?\" Well, what I really wanted were the chilequiles (eggs, cotija jack, pulled pork, tortillas, tomatillo verde? Yes please!!) but being allergic to eggs I went with the oatmeal, which was delicious. The oatmeal had a vanilla flavor to it and the strawberry and pecan topping gave it some texture. The red velvet pancakes are too intense for words. Rich, fluffy...they'll make you want to get up early on a Saturday morning. I also tried a side order of the banana bread which was slightly toasted....now if you've never toasted banana bread, you need to. This was the perfect buttery flavor combination with the oatmeal.    The service was fast as always--we never had to wait or ask for a coffee/water refill. The decor inside is warm but I think sitting outside on the patio is the way to go.   Love the Herb Box and can't wait to go back and try the cinnamon buckwheat pancakes."}
{"text":"Nice place for leisurely lunch.  My friend took me here for lunch the other day, and I really enjoyed my leisurely lunch here. I think we stayed an hour and a half (and it was just regular work week).  Loved everything about my salmon, nicely cooked and flavored. Portion size is small if you just order the grapefruit and sugar charred salmon. Snap peas, fennel, blackberries, pistachio, orange, charred onion, black quinoa and snow pea shoots... those are on the salmon dish.  I would never thought about blackberries and pistachio for salmon but everything listed here all blended well to enhance the salmon.  Pear almond cake was complimented by vanilla mascarpone cream. I figured since I ate healthy for lunch, I thought I could take that extra calories from mascarpone??? I think I offered him to share my desert but now think back, I ate the whole thing by myself. I was going to share but it was gone quick, (meaning it was that good).  Excellent service, friendly and attentive.  I really enjoyed my lunch, and conversation with my friend at their nice patio section.  They have umbrella to create nice shade for those warm and sunny Phoenix afternoon.  I also like the way their bathroom was decorated. Cute.  By the end of dinner, I was relaxed and felt good.  They have branch on weekend, I would like to come back here for branch someday."}
{"text":"Went to happy hour with a friend.   After checking out the happy hour menu, we ordered the HOISIN GLAZED CHICKEN SATAY and the THAI BBQ BABY BACK RIBS.   I had the twisted manhattan and she had the martinez.   I LOVED my twisted manhattan.   Made to perfection.  My alcohol of choice is usually vodka, but I could change to drinking manhattans if they all tasted this good.  I tried her martinez.  Uhmmm, no.   Not my kind of drink.   Plus, there was a ton of ice in it, which you know meant not much of a drink and would get watered down and drowned.  I LOVED the Thai BBQ baby back ribs.   The flavoring was perfect, so perfect, in fact, that we ordered a second round.   Probably should not have, since I was already full, but what the hey.   The order is not that large.    The meat was succulent and melt in one's mouth, falling off the bone.     I was not impressed with the chicken satay.   I thought it was dry, and I tried to flavor it with the accompanying peanut sauce.   Not enough to overcome the dryness.    Returned the following evening.  Thought I'd try out the dinner menu.   I, again, ordered the twisted manhattan.   Hmmmm.   Was it a different bartender?   I didn't think it was as good this time.   A little too sweet.   I tend to sort of like sweet drinks but not too sweet.    I was disappointed.  I had the MAC and CHEESE GRATIN and he had the SHORT RIB ENCHILADAS + MANCHEGO + ANCHO*.  Since he doesn't eat food with mixed proteins, he asked to have the manchego left off.   He gave me one of his enchiladas, of which it comes with three.   It was good.   I don't know how it would have been if it had the cheese, but I would imagine better.   I must admit, I am sort of selective about the kind of beef I eat.   I have to be in the mood, since I am not a big beef eater.     My mac and cheese, now that was another story.   YUMMMM!!!   Even though it is supposed to be an appetizer, it is definitely large enough to be a full meal.   Lots of cheese, a nice crust with the gratin made it a very flavorful mix to my taste buds and eye.   I LOVE mac and cheese if it's made right, which means it has to have a good cheese mix and flavor.   I would definitely order that again.   In fact, I had eyed it the night before when I was there for happy hour, but since I was told it was a good size, I figured it would be too much food.    We sat on the patio.   It is far enough away from the street as to not have conversations over-powered by the traffic.  It was a bit on the cool side, but there are heaters and that kept me warm.   I would have given this place five stars if I had liked the chicken satay and I had not been disappointed by my manhattan on the second visit, but I would definitely return.   My mouth will be watering for the ribs, and I'd sure have the mac and cheese again.   I'd want to try other items on the menu though; therefore, that makes for more than one future visit, I'd say."}
{"text":"Went here twice - once for lunch, once for brunch.    The GOOD: *The brunch Brussel sprout & pancetta flatbread with an egg!  SOOOOO good.   * Awesome red velvet pancakes!  Between the flatbread and the RV 'cakes, I was stuffed!  Originally, I wasn't too excited about the red velvet pancakes, but once I ate them, I was a fan.  The OKAY: * Chilequiles were just a bowl of pulled pork - not my favorite.   * Breakfast burrito was okay, but after the flatbread, it didn't measure up. * For my lunch there, I had the Brussel sprout & pancetta flatbread.  Tasty, but a little bit oily.  The brunch version was better.  Other Suggestion: I have heard good things about their tzatziki and sweet potato chips, but haven't tried them yet.  Next time..."}
{"text":"My only problem with this place is that it's too far from NJ!!  On our last day in Phoenix we had hours to kill before our flight out. We spent them blissfully getting lost in the happy hour menu here!  $5 appetizers from 4-6, and some drinks $7! We got a seat on the patio and told our waiter we were planning on \"grazing\" our way for a bit- he was super nice and came back to check on us, only when plates were empty.  First the edamame hummus; why have I never thought of this before? Ahhhmazing. Planning making this at home- garnished with corn ask raddishes, just the right amount of fresh. We also had the pesto pizza, fried cauliflower, and drinks of course. Blackberry margarita for me, house special for him- blackberrys were fresh and tasted light without being too sweet!   Everything was clearly fresh and seasoned exceptionally. The vibe of the restaurant was also awesome- definitely recommend for a boozy lunch or an afternoon with time to kill!"}
{"text":"I have been here many times for both brunch and lunch. It's always very good, but is rather crowded. The food is generally light and healthy, but not anything spectacular. I'd give it a 3.5, but rounded up to 4.  I like their lunch menu better than brunch, but unfortunately they don't serve the lunch menu on the weekends. My favorite thing on the menu is the sugar charred salmon. Portion is reasonable, but not huge.   I also get the avocado toast here and have a weird gripe. It seems like half the time it comes with eggs on top and half the time it doesn't. It's weird because it never says there are eggs on it, but a couple times it came out with eggs on top. It is not as good with eggs. /endrant  All in all, I like this place for lunch if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Over the course of the last year we've been here 3 times and each time I lower the rating. Today we came in for lunch and they were super busy but we only waited ~20 minutes. However when got to our table the restaurant was empty inside, literally 3 tables. But I understand it's nice out and people were waiting for the patio... but that doesn't explain why we waited to be seated in an empty restaurant. Then they stuck us in a back corner behind a huge post. Again not a big deal just odd. So we ordered and the appetizer came out but we did have silverware, then our lunch came out just a few minutes later which felt very rushed for an empty restaurant. All that is fine if the food and service are good, but that wasn't the case today. The squash enchiladas were on point but the sweet potato tacos were rushed together and didn't taste like the ingredients belonged together. But the worst part was that we were kind of ignored, which gave me ample time to really look around the restaurant and it's filthy!!!! The chairs, the walls, the ceiling, and to top it off my wine glass had lipstick on it! This is likely our last visit.  I just left from our 2nd visit here and am sad to lower this review to 4 stars but for the 2nd time the bar drinks took forever! Today we finished our appetizer before they came out and the restaurant wasn't busy. The bar staff was standing around and our server had to ask them twice to make our drinks. Then our drinks sat at the bar for more than 5 minutes while several staff looked at them and walked away. There's really no reason that staff shouldn't help out and deliver each other's drinks. But the food was off the charts good again! Today we had brunch and the pancakes and breakfast tacos were both really great!  We did our early Christmas family dinner here and it was on point. Our server was also the bartender and somehow despite being busy behind the bar he gave us great service. We started with melon mule cocktails, Brussels sprout chips, and veggie pakora! All of them we awesome! For entrees we had the trout, risotto, and butternut squash enchiladas. I had the risotto without the pancetta and could tell it was missing something but I don't eat pork. My hubs had the enchiladas and they were great! My in-laws had the trout and ate every last bite, which is unusual for them. For dessert we split the bread pudding and it was meh... Overall this place has a great atmosphere, fun list of cocktails, vegan and meat eater friendly menu. Give it a go! We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"This was my 5th time eating at the new Herb Box on 7th St and in the past it has always been very good.  Something happened last night, it was one of the worse meals I have had in a long time.  My usual favorite the short ribs with polenta was so salty I could not eat most of it.  We were a party of 7 celebrating a Birthday, the other dinners had the same problems and those that had the rib eye were salty and over cooked.  The medium came out well done, the rare came out medium.  Very very disappointing as this was one of our new favorite restaurants.  The service was great, that has not changed and my favorite cocktail was really good as always although they did not fill the glass.  the Twisted Manhattan is wonderful and usually comes full to the top.  Not sure what is happening, if they have a new cook with a salt fetish or new manager or something.  But they have a problem with consistency.  The last four dinners were very good but last night was just awful.  For the Birthday boy they brought a piece of bread pudding that was disgusting, it was so over cooked it had a burnt flavor.  The cream custard was very good.  Bottom line you had 7 guests that may not be back."}
{"text":"Outstanding!! That's the only way I know how to describe an absolutely phenomenal Wedding Shower for my daughter. The food was superb. Service was impeccable. The facilities are top of the line. Thank you to our servers as well as their event coordinator for allowing us to enjoy our time with absolutely no stress."}
{"text":"Went here on a Monday with some friends and it was all but empty. The waiter was super friendly and all of the food was yummy. Be aware that the $5 lunch plates are smallish portions, and that even the larger portions weren't big. They appear to be able to manage some allergies- I did fine with a pistachio/cashew allergy even though pistachios are on half the menu items. The waiter was happy to answer my questions about ingredients, including checking with the kitchen when he wasn't sure. They had a few GF items and a few vegan things as well. Overall this was a great place to hang out, if a bit pricey for what you get."}
{"text":"This place was pleasantly really good. The hubby, and I had lunch on the terrace over looking the art walk that happened to be going on. There was also a musician that was playing in the background ( part of the art walk ) while I'm sure the art walk isn't a regular event, it definitely made my brunch experience very enjoyable. Aside from that the food was yummy, the mimosas were delicious, and the bathrooms are way prettier than they probably should be."}
{"text":"I am usually a big fan of the Herb Box (especially their gouda mac, its usually killer), however the last time we came, the food seemed lackluster and sloppily put together. The gouda mac was overcooked and severely missing seasoning, and the fried chicken was lacking the crispiness that I was craving (the take on  Mexican street corn that accompanied it was gross). Additionally, our crab dip was barren, and while we were expecting a thick, creamy dip, we received a watery soup-like bowl with the occasional chunk of crab. Perhaps this could be because it was their first day open post summer schedule, however for the price tag, the food quality was weak at best. The only thing keeping me from a 1 star review are my previous experiences at Herb Box, which have been pretty delightful.. However after this last experience, it might take me a while before I gain the courage to come back."}
{"text":"Excellent place to eat, grab a drink and people watch. Food is excellent and bar makes good cocktails."}
{"text":"AWESOME food, branch out and try something new, all of ours was amazing. The service was fantastic, he was super attentive and helpful. Will definitely be returning! Try to get a spot on the patio for brunch!"}
{"text":"I'm going to keep this review simple.  The food took a really long time to come out.  We ordered 1 chicken wrap which was supposed to have the walnuts substituted for pecans.  It still came out with pecans.  2 fried chicken sandwiches, which were bland and the super dry.  And then well the salad was supposedly delicious, but guess what?  It came out 15 minutes after the sandwiches and wrap.  Did they have to wait for the lettuce to grow and then go out to the field to pick it?  The only saving grace is the waitress was rather attentive, refilling sodas, teas and waters promptly.  I probably wouldn't go back just cause the food just really was not good."}
{"text":"Great selection. Excellent atmosphere, riverside and outdoor seating. Friendly and efficient service."}
{"text":"I keep trying to give this place a chance and they really just let me down every time. Such a cute restaurant but the service and food always disappoints."}
{"text":"Been to this restaurant for many years.  I have watched them grow from when they were on Shea.  I love the restaurant and new location.  Happy grow salad is one of my favorites."}
{"text":"Came for lunch with clients.  Service was slow and inattentive start to finish. The food was so-so. Some liked their salads, I noticed others just picking at theirs. I had the short rib enchiladas - OK, but the sauce overwhelmed the dish. The space outside and inside is gorgeous. But the service was poor. We waited forever for the server to come with the check, and eventually we just had to find him."}
{"text":"I have to say after seeing all these positive reviews it makes me even more disappointed that I had just an unpleasant experience.   My friends and I came here yesterday to grab a quick bite to eat and a few drinks.  We came around 3 or 4 in the afternoon so it was very quite.  It was our first time so when we walked in we were not sure if it was open seating or what so after being ignored for a few minutes we just decided to have a seat.  When we sat down again no one came to greet us or give us menus so we politely asked what appeared to be a host for some menus.  This woman was soo rude, she didn't even say one word to us all she did was glare back (how dare we bother her for a menu, the nerve!) until another employee offered to get us some menus and waters.  After that my friends and I were already feeling very unwelcomed but still took a look at the menu.  Again the same woman walked by our table looked directly at us, rolled her eyes, shook her head and then darted into some back room. (SERIOUSLY! is that a joke?!)  Now at this point I was so upset and our server also  hadn't been back to check on us after several minutes( I'm not exaggerating, there was one othe so we just got up and left all together.    I can honestly say they have lost my business forever and I will NEVER recommend this place to any of my friends or family.   Super disappointing.  What ever happened to good customer service??"}
{"text":"I met a friend of mine for dinner at The Herb Box this week.   She had tried another location for lunch; this was my first time at the restaurant.    It was a  great place to talk i.e. it was not noisy at all.   We had a very leisurely dinner and the waitress was attentive but not overbearing.  The menu (and the dessert case we sat beside) highlighted  gluten-free  (gf) dishes, and there were a lot of them.   I had the Grapefruit and Sugar Charred Salmon which was nicely grilled, flavorful and light.   My friend had Char-grilled Trout with Skillet Corn and Leek Gratin and she remarked a number of times about how good it was.    I will definitely come back although probably not with my husband since it may be a little too 'healthy' for him."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch. Our table shared a few appetizers and everything was fabulous. The \"avocado love\" was by far my favorite.   Great cocktails and the service was fantastic as well. Will definitely be going back the next time I am in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"First and foremost, very dog friendly!  The food was excellent and we came back a second night.  Shrimp appetizer was outstanding, wife's vegetarian dinner got raves and my enchiladas were perfect. Desserts are great too,  the \"crack\" is addictive.  Staff is very friendly, I would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"I found another winner today on the menu at Herb Box... I changed it up a bit and ordered the Market Veggie Pita; it was really good too!  Inside a light pita wrap was a combo of garden salad & red pepper hummus... it came with my fave sweet potato chips and a side of grapes.  All for $9.  Add an iced tea and it's a wonderful lunch!  I also noticed another new addition to the menu at this location:  the Crisp Coconut Shrimp Salad; i'll have to remember to try that next time!  I also have to remember to try herb box for dinner - I haven't been yet, but the menu looks fantastic!  I sat at the bar with my friend and had attentive service from Joy... We would've had to wait for a table, but the bar worked out well.  Still a huge fan of the Herb Box - if you haven't been, go!"}
{"text":"Time for an Herb Box update... this one is specifically for the catering side of the business.  Read on if you want details on the pre-pre-Wedding celebration we had at our house last Thursday night.  I always knew that when the time was right, I'd have the Herb Box cater a party for me... and the time finally came.  We had about 40 people over at our house on the Thursday night before our wedding.  It was primarily our friends that flew in from out of town early and we really wanted to entertain.  So I reached out to Robert, Director of Catering, and explained what we were thinking about.    He responded in no time at all and he was extremely professional as we went back and forth a few times on pricing, menu, etc... the outcome was perfect.  We had a buffet style dinner including a chef and two buffet attendants.  Robert and Mary came over to the house a few days before to do a walk-through, and go over details.    On the day of our event, the team came early and went above and beyond, even running to the store for us to pick up lemons and limes.  I know you're dying to know what our menu was, aren't you?  Okay - I'll share!  Here you go: -Urban Market Salad with watercress, red pepper, dried corn, sugared pecans, avocado, and blue cheese vinaigrette (dressing on the side) -Citrus & Rum Free-Range Chicken with watercress, pear-gorgonzola salsa -Alaskan Salmon with maple-ginger glaze -Asparagus couscous with feta and mint -Grilled vegetable feast with farmers goat cheese and herbs -and of course my favorite, the Signature Sweet Potato Chips dusted with mild curry  We arrived at the above menu after looking through around eight pages worth of gourmet menu items that are all appealing possibilities if you choose to use the Herb Box to cater your event.  They worked within our budget and made it quite an evening to remember.  I highly recommend using The Herb Box whether you're catering a party for 12 or 100+.  Just trust me on one thing - make sure you get those sweet potato chips!"}
{"text":"A must try when in the area. The creativeness of the chef is incredible. The staff are very pleasant and know the menu and specials very well. Sitting outside allows to casually eat a great meal while enjoying the activity along the riverfront. Inside is a bit loud. The restaurant has a walk in bakery at street level where you can order virtually the same cuisine that the restaurant offers. Seems to be a very popular location with locals and the prices are fair for the portion sizes and quality of food."}
{"text":"I have had a few extraordinary dishes there and a a couple that missed the mark. Skip the hour wait at RnR and go there for bottomless momosas with your Sunday brunch."}
{"text":"So incredibly delicious. I made a reservation for a friend and I, and when her flight was delayed, I called to move the reservation back and they were very helpful. When her luggage then got delayed, I called to tell them we were going to be even later than planned yet again, and the lady informed me that she would most definitely hold onto the table for us no problem. We got the brussel sprout chips with vegan aioli and they were BOMB! I had a roasted cauliflower/quinoa/lentil dish that was stellar (had pickled grapes in it..yum!). The food was tasty, presented lovely, and the staff was helpful and efficient. Outside patio area was lovely. All around, another great meal at Herb Box. This is always my go to for nicer dinners, anniversary dates, etc. Highly recommend. They hit a home run with this place."}
{"text":"wonderful lunch. We had cauliflower bowel and butternut squash enchiladas, both were great as well as great service."}
{"text":"The service was good and attentive. The food was ok. We had the burger and the meat was a little more charred than what I would prefer. We would probably go back to try something else on the menu before I will decide if this is a Yes or No."}
{"text":"The food at Herb Box is excellent. The service is absolutely horrible. It took our server 15 min to greet us. When she took our drink order she brought my husband's beverage and not mine. I eventually got my drink. The dinner came out wrong and so we waited again. The table next to us had even more issues then we did. Their dinner was comped and a couple items were taken off our bill. The timing is simply off at the Herb Box. I don't know if it is new management or a new owner. Please Herb Box give the attention this restaurant deserves."}
{"text":"Have been to this restaurant twice.  First time experience I would have given it more than 5 stars if I could.  Second time was a 2 to 3 star experience.  Both times we had the same appetizer the chef's mezze board.  First time experience with this appetizer was amazing.  The second time the board looked sloppily put together, some of the hummus was overly acidic and the hummus was less creamy (making it appear that it was prepared in haste).  Have not been back since the second experience.  But will probably give them another try since the first meal experience was so wonderful."}
{"text":"I really enjoy my wonderful sweet potato and black bean tacos! My husband got the butternut squash enchiladas they sounded better than they tasted is what he said. As for my tacos unfortunately the server originally brought out the short rib tacos(yucky) since I dont eat meat or dairy. I really love the menu at this restaurant and will continue to return. Hope to see a yelp event here"}
{"text":"Yes yes yes!  I absolutely love the Vegan Nosh board!  The kale Pakora was my favorite thing hands down. The Korean cauliflower was a close second with the Brussel sprouts. The roasted edamame was still delicious and classic. The sweet potato tacos were an amazing entree. I recommend without cheese and creme. Try the gluten free or vegan aioli instead better flavor palate."}
{"text":"The Herb Box is a great alternative to heavier restaurant foods.  While there are decadent choices available - like the mac and cheese gratin - there are many other health options available.  We went for dinner and both had the steak salad.  I additionally had the soup of the day which was a coconut curry.  All were great!  Arrived quickly, fresh and piping hot. Great option for lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"Beautiful place and new!! Try their hummus is the best and the short rib enchiladas to die for!! That dish needs little more sauce that's all the rest are perfectly made!! Will recommend this place to anyone!!!"}
{"text":"Came for lunch today with a friend and loved the decor and vibe. The food was pretty lacking though. My friend had the fried chicken BLT. The portion was a lot smaller than you would expect for $13. For it being \"the herb box\" I was surprised by how little flavor it had. I had the white bean chili which was the best item we had. It was a little too \"soupy\" for me, but it had a good flavor and was a good sized portion. We split the cilantro crab dip... I hate to say it was not good. It was thin and soupy with little crab to no crab and had minimal flavor. Absolutely not worth the $11 they charged. We both had iced tea and a cocktail as well. The lemon basil martini was good but the loosey goosey (which I ordered and then ended up switching with my friend) was lacking. It had no bubble and you could barely taste the elderflower which was why I ordered it. For almost $80 with tip for lunch, we likely won't be back!"}
{"text":"I recently brought my parents to the Herb Box for brunch on a Saturday.  We arrived at 10:45 (with reservations).  The breakdown is as follows:  Ambiance:  The indoor area was quite cute.  The outdoor area was okay - but you are looking out into a parking lot.  Do not come here for the views!  Service:  We had reservations, but I later received an email from Open Table that said we didn't show up.  This is annoying, as I told them we had reservations & the host looked them up in front of me.  I asked if we could be seated outside, but in the shade, and the host acted as if this was an inconvenience.  There was a table in the shade (which we were eventually seated at), so I'm not sure what the problem was!  We had two servers - our main waiter & someone training.  They would leave for significant amounts of time.  We waited a large amount of time for the bill just so that we could leave.  A little bit annoying.  Food:  Okay, onto the important part.  We were given breakfast menus and not given a choice about lunch.  Before we were even served, the table behind us was given lunch menus and I overheard the specials being described.  The lunch menu sounded much better than the breakfast, so I wish we had been given this option (even if we had had to wait).  Note to self, come back for lunch.  I ordered the BLT, but had them substitute avocado for bacon, as I don't eat it.  The waiter was very reluctant to do this, which seemed odd to me because bacon is obviously pricier than an avocado.  Even if you had had to charge me for it, just agree to my order & tell me that it will cost.  Sorry to be annoying, but there aren't many options without meat on the breakfast menu.  My sandwich was okay, but a bit lacking in flavor - probably from the missing bacon.  My fault.  My parents both enjoyed their meals - and were quite pleased with...the bacon!  So if you eat meat, maybe this is the breakfast for you!  Overall, we had an okay to good meal, but nothing special."}
{"text":"Had lunch there yesterday and have been there a few times.  Tried many things and don't have anything negative to say. Love the atmosphere. The staff is always super friendly. Wine is superb. Always one of my top picks."}
{"text":"This is our favorite restaurant in Scottsdale. The menu is awesome and if you make it to brunch on the weekend, try the smoked salmon hash. It is the best!  Katia, the manager is helpful and efficient- her and her staff always make you feel special."}
{"text":"Love this place the food is always great.  Service is great if you get Victoria or Katie.  They have had staff turnover and service can be tough at times.  I wish they would bring back the Caesar wrap back for lunch and the lentils for dinner. We are ready for them change their menu again."}
{"text":"Run, do not walk, to this amazing place!  The food is off-the-chart awesome and I could go back every day for a month and order something different and fantastic.  We don't live nearby but if we did this would definitely be 'our place.'  You'll be doubly blessed if you get served by the one and only Brandon.  She was a delight!"}
{"text":"This is a very hip place on the canal in Old Town, with a lovely patio for very romantic dining or just enjoying an evening with friends (as I did last night).....a little above average in price, but not terribly bad for Scottsdale, where pretty much every restaurant is above average in price.  There were four of us dining - we each had one drink or cocktail, we split the Veggie Nosh Board as an appetizer, and each had one entrée - our bill before tip was $136.   I know others have complained about the service, but we had excellent service - our waiter was wonderful - attentive and made good suggestions, kept our water glasses filled, and was friendly.  Around here Thursday night is generally a busy night, but we never felt like we weren't getting top-notch service.  As for the food, that was hit-or-miss.   I highly recommend the Vegetarian Nosh Board ($19) as an appetizer for a group (it was perfect for the 4 of us) - very tasty, nice presentation, nice variety of goodies.  I would even have that all by myself as an entrée.  The rest was not as good....I had the Kobe Burger, and it was about the worst I've ever had - way overcooked (I asked for medium-well but it was beyond well done), very dry, and very tough - normally one should be able to cut a burger with a fork, I had to struggle to cut mine with a knife.  And yes, the default way of serving it is bun-less but our server asked if I wanted a bun with mine - if they forget to ask, then speak up if you want one.  The apple-jicama slaw was fresh and tasty, but the fingerling potatoes, which the menu described as 'smashed' came fried instead......they weren't bad, but had I known I would have ordered something else as I try to avoid fried foods.  My boyfriend had the butternut squash enchiladas, and said they were okay - not terrible, not great, just meh.  Of the four of us, the only one who enjoyed his entrée was a friend who had the short-rib enchiladas, he did say they were very good.  I would definitely try the Herb Box again, but I doubt it would become a regular go-to restaurant for us, due to the price and the inconsistency in the food.   SO for Ambiance it gets an A+, for Food it gets a B-, and for price it gets a C."}
{"text":"Expectations were low upon walking in. Having reviewed the menu prior to arriving, we were intrigued but not throughly impressed. Our opinion was totally turned around!!! Started with sangria and blackberry mojito. Both tasty. Moved onto the Sun Salutation....holy mosses..awesome! Cayenne/sugar rim made the drink. Avocado Love was a nice light appetizer. Totally recommend the short rib taco, the Kobe burger, as well as the Thai ribs. Don't sleep on the smoked Gouda Mac n  cheese.  We will be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"Food was yummy.. the server however, wasn't too great. Every time we asked him how something was, he would just respond with \"everything is good.\" There was an instance that my friend had asked him that about a certain dish and as I began to ask of vegan options he immediately cut me off and said  \"I already told you everything is good\" extremely rude if you ask me! Over all place was alright, wouldn't go back though."}
{"text":"Food is good.  Restaurant was cold, literally -  as evidenced by other people wearing their coats and the server (Chris)  telling us \"someone else said that\".   Took forever to get service.  Server spilled water on the table when trying to fill a glass then spilled wine on the table when trying to fill a glass..  Water is one thing - I'm paying for the wine he poured  on the table.  I ordered a salad with dinner, it never showed up.  Not worth a second visit."}
{"text":"Love their food, it's nice that they now indicate gluten free. The Mango lemonade is dangerously yummy. The cilantro crab dip with homemade plantain chips is my fav fav"}
{"text":"Like Audrey I would have liked to give this place a 3.5.  I rounded up for a few reasons, including for the company at the time.  I like the layout of the place.  I loved the food.  I think it was a bit pricey, but that may be because I am used to getting stuffed, which I wasn't, for far less money.  While some may say the service was slow I would call it relaxed, nothing came quickly but there was no rush to get us out of there.  I think it is deliberate on their end to create a relaxed atmosphere, however turning tables slowly added to the high rent district they are in has a cost that has to be applied to the food.  Speaking of the food; I had the salmon hash but also tried several other dishes.  My plate was delicious but I would certainly consider the Red Velvet pancakes as they were the true definition of desert for breakfast.  And they serve a decaf which tastes like real coffee!  The true test of any review has to be whether I would return and/or recommend it to my friends.  Yes on both accounts but not often as, for me, it is priced as a special occasion place."}
{"text":"Love their salads and atmosphere! Service is great, too. Stopped in for the first time, being new to Scottsdale, and really felt a lot like a Marin County (CA) casual place. Prices are a little higher than other similar places that serve great salads but the dressings are a lot better. Will definitely make this one of my favorites!"}
{"text":"What a treat! Love this place! Menu was so up my ally that I had to order 3 dishes!  The sweet potato tacos were delicious. I asked  for my meat to be rare for the Market Salad and it arrived perfectly cooked and ever so tender. Not to mention the gluten free brownie...oh my!"}
{"text":"The food here is good and I think is priced very well. The best part of eating here is the patio. There is usually a little arts walk right on the bridge during the summer and its very fun to sit and eat outside."}
{"text":"Ruined my entire Sunday morning! 30 minutes for a cold cappuccino! Service was awful and the food they brought wasn't what we were told. Never ever again."}
{"text":"Usually very good here, the food is yummy, the waitstaff are great and we have enjoyed our lunches and dinners.  I have read other reviews that have had bad experiences..that is too bad, but they do need to make sure the issues are taken care of in a way better manner than perviously reviewed by others."}
{"text":"We visited on Saturday, June 18th at 1:000 p.m.  This was my first time eating at The Herb Box - my lunch companion has eaten at this location a few times.  It was not overly busy - there were empty tables inside and there was no one on the patio.    We ordered the Crisp Brussels Sprout Chips with Vegan Aioli ($9.00).  I'm not normally big on Brussels Sprouts but did enjoy this dish.  The Vegan Aioli was on the bottom of the plate with the chips on top which made it challenging to get any of the dip until you ate most of the chips.  The dip should be served on the side.     We both ordered the Sweet Potato Avocado Baha bowl ($13.00) - I added blackened chicken ($5.00).  The food was fresh and delicious.  Unfortunately, the chicken was not blackened - appeared to be only grilled.  As has been noted by other reviewers, the portion size was very small considering the price.  The chicken was a very small chicken breast.  There were about 4 small wedges of sweet potato, a spoonful of avocado (expect there were would be at least half an avocado), a couple spoonful's of quinoa, etc.  The entrée appeared to be 'lost' in the bowl in which it was served.  I was very disappointed especially considering the total costs - $18.00 for a lunch entrée.  For dessert, we split the Blueberry Peach Cobbler (roasted blueberries & peaches with a house made scone and rosemary anglaise).  Neither of us could find any blueberries in the cobbler - only peaches.  The small scone on top did contain blueberries - the expectation from the menu description created a mental picture of blueberries & peaches in the cobbler; not just in the small scone.  The wait times for food seemed to be a little excessive considering the restaurant was not that busy.  Our table provided a view to the bathroom area and there seemed to be a couple of women in line at all times to use the bathroom - on a busy day, this could be much more of an issue, especially if you have small children.  Our waiter was GREAT! (a tall male, blonde hair shaved on the side, mid-20's).  Overhearing interactions between other staff and guests - the staff were very friendly and accommodating.  The restaurant appeared to be very clean.    The overall service from staff was awesome - just wished the overall food experience was awesome.  I do not feel there was a value (food vs. costs) and don't see returning."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this review as i went the first time for lunch and Loved it, then went back for breakfast and was a little disapoointed.  The lunch menu was fun, interesting and healthy.  Had a wonderful quiona salad and salmon dish and there was plenty of food to fill two of us.  Also had a piece of flourless cheese cake that was great,  Waitress was the best!  Breakfast was good but several items were not available and the food was not exactly hot when it got to the table.  I will go back and try breakfast again and will defintely do lunch and try dinner in the future!"}
{"text":"Great location, good service.   Parking:  Street parking seemed to be nearby.  I walked here from the Starbucks across the street.     Service: Attentive and helpful.   Food:  Rather tasty, though the food I ordered was a bit oily.  I ordered the Lentil Cauliflower Bowl which includes: organic cauliflower, rainbow quinoa, organic black lentils, pickled red grapes, crispy brussels sprouts, honeycup dijon, and aioli.  I could definitely tell the cauli and black lentils were organic!   (j/k)  Atmosphere:  Simple, there is seating indoors and out.   Cost: Moderate.  The dish I ordered was around $13."}
{"text":"We had a company dinner here a couple nights ago, and this was definitely the worst meal that we had while in Scottsdale.   Let's start with the good: the brussel sprouts on the veggie nosh platter were delicious - crunchy, flavorful and light.   At least five of us ordered the glazed salmon for our entrees, and it was incredibly disappointing. We were told that it would be cooked medium - it was incredibly well done. One of my colleagues sent it back and was given another salmon - equally well done. It was bland and, frankly, something that I could have whipped together in my home for $5 and not a lot of effort."}
{"text":"This used to be one of our go-to places in Scottsdale. We met up with some friends from California for lunch recently at the Herb Box, It was a good experience, atmosphere/service but something has changed in the menu.  We ordered salads and enchilada dishes, but the portions seem much smaller than the old menu.  Comically light actually.  Our party left hungry.  The 'less-is-more' trrend seems to be proliferating amongst high-end restaurants, presumably encouraging customers to order more courses.  But I find it insulting to the customer.  We can always choose to eat less than what's on the plate, but undersized portions gives us little option.  This is a fatal flaw IMHO."}
{"text":"Came in here for lunch on weekday.  It was not too crowded.  We sat inside to avoid the heat.  The waiter came promptly and got our drink orders.    I had the Sweet Potato Avacodo Baja Bowl with shrimp.  The shrimp were of average size but had nice flavor.  The rest of the bowl was Ok.  The veggies were not bad but overall the combination was just Ok.  Not sure why they put fried onion rings on there.  Leave those off next time.  Considering the shrimp bowl was ~20 dollars, I think I would pass on this place.  Kinda pricey for what you get."}
{"text":"Delicious had breakfast at the market and have had lunch in the restaurant, the most delicious breakfast I have had in years. Pricey yes but the food is unparalleled. I say go and enjoy do not worry about the calories!"}
{"text":"I've been to the North Scottsdale location and this one is just as nice. Friday night we sat out on the patio overlooking The Scottsdale Canal (sorry, can't quite get into calling it The \"Waterfront\").   White Chicken Chili was fabulous, not too spicy and I ordered a side of toasted ciabatta bread for dipping/sopping up the wet parts. Yum.  One of their signature dishes was The Roasted Chicken--DEElish; so many grilled flavors on one plate; worth the 20 minute prep time!  Not quite a fan of the ciabatta bread used as a hamburger bun for the Kobe Burger (and the burger itself was only \"okay\") and the side for said meal was a bit of a turn-off for my husband and I agree that he should have been offered a different side with it...  Otherwise, great service, great atmosphere.  Yes, we'll be back (again)."}
{"text":"Once again....now a visit for happy hour.  Great prices and the food was delicious and generous quantities.  They have a wonderful patio with pleasant music and a fountain, and live greenery, so nice to sit in a patio that doesn't look at cars....and they have heaters too! .....I love this place."}
{"text":"So many wonderful things from which to choose, but the 4 of us managed to each find something we loved.  I had the Short Rib Tacos...they were off the chain...so tender and tasty.  And we all enjoyed Mimosa's where we got 4 choices for our juice.  Hint: pick the pineapple...it's yummy.  Our waiter was friendly and there when we needed him.  First time at this location...we'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"The Italian Festival next door was providing classic old school Italian music while we enjoyed a fresh lunch on a beautiful Spring day in Old Town Scottsdale. The open air restaurant upstairs had live music and a nice vibe.   Deciding to eat at the downstairs deli, we were pleasingly surprised with the quality of the \"deli\" food.    The Butternut squash enchilada  made with a corn tortilla, fresh corn and perhaps gouda cheese really hit the spot?  Next up was a Turkey-berry -jalepino-brie-arugula sandwich that sounds like a mouthful but was actually quite light and delicate. The Gouda mac and cheese was not good at all, in fact very dry.   We ordered a number of sides: the Szechuan Green Beens had a nice crunchy kick, and the Edamame Salad and Roasted Cauliflower were both fresh and filling.  It was a hot day so having Orange San Pellegrino was a treat. The deli is  not full service but they gladly gave us extra plates and removed our dirty dishes."}
{"text":"Megan and Gabi, the first two reviewers, really said it all.  I will just add another layer of approval to enhance the credibility of everything they said--Herb Box is AMAZING.  In fact, I consciously make efforts at work to not expose too many people to it, because I don't want the entire company discovering my secret lunch place!  Also, it's important to note that this restaurant's title in Yelp is confusing -- they started as a catering company and the food was so amazing that they opened a little takeout marketplace.  The marketplace got so popular that they bought the space next door and opened a little bistro as well--with which I have lot's of experience!  Yes, the sweet potato chips are to die for (and are often the tipping point decision between ordering a wrap or a salad).  My favorite menu item is the turkey/apple/swiss wrap (has cashews and lot's of mixed greens in it, really yum) but highly encourage trying their specials, which are always fantastic.    They offer iced green tea that is really tasty, and have a small beer/wine/drink menu as well.  The DC Ranch location is confirmed, which is awesome--I could definitely see this place expanding throughout the valley:  the fresh, healthy food they offer combined with the charming atmosphere often makes a visit to this bistro the highlight of my day."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying, I LOVE The Herb Box.....in Old Town!!! We walked in here 5 adults and 1 child. We brought a dog in who was wearing a service vest. My friends didn't have his papers because they have never been asked as he is obviously wearing the service vest that you can't just buy in a pet store! 3 separate people came up to us to ask for papers after it had been explained that they left them at home but you can clearly see he is a service dog. The atmosphere in this place was so snobby (I know...its DC ranch)!!!!!! But if these people only knew how much money they lost from today and future visits they would have been kinder. Needless to say we were all very uncomfortable and walked out!!! Shame on you people.....you lost a lot of business today and considering how quiet it was there on a Saturday morning, you should be more gracious!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I have been here many times and as a hotel employee in the neighborhood, I send countless guests there. The food is delicious. My only complaint is that the waitstaff Is a bit slow to get to the table when you first get there. Also, I recently told the manager that I send tons of people to his restaurant. My concierge told me not to do it if they don't do anything for me. But I love the food, so even though he didn't even offer me a free drink, I will continue to send people here since it is amazing food."}
{"text":"Great food and very nice location and layout but terrible service. After being seated we waited 10 minutes for waitress to ask for order. Then we waited another 15 minutes for the food to be delivered. This on an early afternoon on a Sunday."}
{"text":"Went on a \"date night\" with my dear friend. We got caught up on the appetizers and din't make it to an entree. We'll definitely have to go back, as we didn't get to try all of the appetizers . . . and obviously nothing else. We had FOUR appetizers, all of which were amazing. I wish I had tried this place sooner!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch after some shopping and wanted to order everything on the menu. Everything looked/sounded great! All the cocktails looked refreshing as well. Sitting on the patio was a great experience.  I ordered the grilled chicken & sage pesto sandwich and loved it! I wasn't crazy about the sweet potato chips it came with.  I'd definitely come back if I was in the area!"}
{"text":"Nothing special in my book. Service in AZ seems to be very leisurely. It's OK if you're used to that, but where I come from, we don't wait 10 minutes before they even take a drink order. Food was average, nothing special. They did have some interesting garden to table features. Ordered the market sunflower salad, kale cuban and brussels sprouts & pancetta flatbread. The best being the flatbread and the worst the kale cuban. Cute ambiance, but I probably wouldn't visit again."}
{"text":"Almost completely unimpressed. The menu is pretty interesting but doesn't contain nearly as many vegan/vegetarian options as I thought it would. The cocktails are probably the best part about the menu. Every drink is a modern take on a classic.   My girlfriend and I had a vegan platter that game with a couple small dishes of hummus, green beans, and something else that I can't recall. All were fairly good but it was twenty bucks for two people to feel mildly full. I usually don't complain about the size of the dishes (Americans are obviously confused about portion size compared to the rest of the planet, save for Mexico) but these were just...tiny. They were served in sauce cups or something.  The service was fine, but the guys who were working when I came through were the type you'd expect to find at a local bar like Hi-Fi or RnR. Tattooed, heavily-gelled hair and talking to the girls at the bar pretty much constantly.   The decor is easily the coolest thing about the restaurant. It sits on the second floor by that bridge in old town Scottsdale, and at night it was a romantic place to have a fifty-dollar dinner that didn't fill me up."}
{"text":"You know what's pretty rad? When you want the avocado toast, but talk yourself out of it to order a salad instead and then *find* avocado toast *under* your salad. I'd say the rad-u-locity of the phenomenon pretty much felt like a unicorn parade just stomped right on through my life!   If you're looking for a quick, healthy and delicious meal, look no further. You've got options here!  From the delicious starters of Crisp Brussel Sprout Chips and Edamame to the incredible Serrano Shrimp Salad (with avocado toast hiding below the greens) I was at no loss for flavorful and tasty ways to enjoy my veggies. Seriously though, this salad was one of the best I've had in awhile just based on what I enjoy, which were the warm, succulent shrimp, sweet and tangy vinaigrette and of course, the discovery of avocado toast down below the bed of arugula.   Service was prompt and the space felt open and airy with plenty of natural light. If I were to be around this area more often, it would definitely be a go-to spot for me based on my first experience.   Veggies never tasted so good!"}
{"text":"All it took was one visit to get my mom and I hooked. I wish they'd share their recipes!"}
{"text":"This place is adorable I'll absolutely return for a full meal. Happy hour was the worth the visit, as I got a glimpse of all the goodies they have to offer! Even though I'm not a vegetarian, I appreciate the variety on the menu. The happy hour menu offers more options in terms of good. I found the wine options a little limited, but they do have beer, cocktails and red and white Sangria. The sweet potato chips are as delicious as everyone says, the cheese board of the day was a delight and the crisp fried edamame make for the perfect happy hour snack. Service is attentive and the space is lovely as can be. I look forward to another visit sometime soon!"}
{"text":"Had a great experience here. My girlfriend is vegan, and I am not, so we are always searching for the places that accommodate both of us with excellent food. Some of the vegetarian/vegan options here were so good - they were better than some of the meat items. Service was fast, the bartender (a vikings fan) was great. Fast, friendly, efficient, and made great drinks. He could sense when we were ready to leave, ready to order, without hovering. The only suggestion I could make for improvement was the hostess was a bit rude- she asked if we had a reservation and told us to wait with an ENTIRE empty restaurant (which never filled). She made us feel as though she did not want to seat us, and was not friendly about it. On the flip side, sitting at the bar ended up being a blessing as the service was faster and better than what I observed at the tables. I would recommend the corn enchiladas, and the chili cauliflower."}
{"text":"What a nice place to relax and enjoy some great food with great company. My long time friend came into town and recommended this place, and he is a picky eater so I assumed this place had to be good! It's perfectly located in the heart of downtown Scottsdale by all that's going on so you can run multiple errands if you need to. And what a grand entrance with the stairs, love it lol!  I have passed by this place a few times but have never noticed it, surprisingly, because it's pretty big. It was a decent amount of people in there, not too busy but not dead. The interior is very nice, it has a rustic modern look going on; decor is very important in my opinion! The ladies who served us were pleasant and super helpful! Our main server helped me decide what the best vegan dish was there. I originally wanted the vegan enchiladas but apparently they switch out their menu items once in awhile so it was no longer available. I appreciated her taking the time with me to let me know what was in the dishes she was recommending. She also gave my friend and I suggestions on the best appetizers, so glad she did because the pakora was lovely! I got the lentil cauliflower bowl, it was pretty yummy, I loved the different flavors and the crispy kale was sooo good! I just wish it didn't have a sweet sauce in it.  I wouldn't doubt for a second that I will make another trip to this restaurant. Perfect ambiance, great variety of food for any dietary preference, and great customer service is all I need to make me happy (as I'm sure it would for anyone else)!"}
{"text":"I came during weekend brunch and live music was playing. That put me in a good mood right away as I love to be serenaded while I eat. Our server was friendly and I ordered the cilantro lime crab dip with plantain chips and the crispy chicken BLT with sweet potato chips.   The portions are generous and hubby and I were able to split the BLT. Unfortunately, I thought the flavors were alright. Nothing to rave about. Unfortunately, the \"healthy\" food didn't sit well with my tummy. I'm not sure if it was the dip or the sandwich."}
{"text":"Located in Old Town Scottsdale, I've been to this location a few times to meet colleagues for lunch.  It's a trendy spot for people to have lunch as it's always packed no matter what day it is.  My favorite lunch item is the Turkey Ciabatta (Gouda Cheese, Smoked Bacon, Sweet Tomato, Roasted Red Pepper Aioli), $11.  It has a perfect blend of ingredients that has a combination of smoked & sweet flavors with the Turkey.  This is great for lunch because it's satisfying, but does not weigh you down during the afternoon.  One of these days I will have to come back for dinner.  I tell myself that every time I have lunch here, but always seem to forget about it when we're looking for places to eat.  Return Factor - 85%"}
{"text":"My 22-year-old daughter and I thoroughly enjoyed our dinner on the patio on 2/13/14.  Our waitress enthusiastically guided us through the menu options, and we feasted on a wonderful assortment of dishes, including the Korean cauliflower, beet & orange salad, lentil meatballs over spaghetti squash, roasted brussel sprouts and gouda mac'n cheese.  Fortunately, the Thursday evening Art Gallery Walk allowed us to slowly work off our fine meal.  Lovely experience all around!"}
{"text":"Update....still fabulous.  I took my mom here after shopping and our 1st experience was a great experience, so we reminisce and ordered soup of the day - tomato & artichoke soup and  it was so delicious. The food here is always awesome....the service is just just tad slow...and I only think we came between shifts.  I don't mind waiting for the good food, but waters up front or taking our drink orders....sorry we waited quite a bit.  Anyhow. we came for the fabulous food and they did not disappoint.  Service this time around just a little slow."}
{"text":"Delicious food - so many yummy options especially if you are veg or GF. Good drinks too but what gets the 5 star review is customer service - friendly hostess, attentive servers and super apologetic when our appetizer was delayed (which wasn't even a huge deal!). Lovely outdoor patio with love music too!"}
{"text":"I was visiting from out of state with my family & we stop in for dinner. The hours on the sign said they were open till 9:00pm. We were there at 8:45 & the hostess was very rude & snotty. She said they were closed & stared at us to leave, making us feel stupid. My husband who usually never gets mad was fuming! Advice #1 to management if you close at 8:45 or 8:50 you should post that on your sign & on line.  #2 teach your employees better etiquette when dealing with customers.  I have the feeling we didn't miss anything by not dining here, very negative energy."}
{"text":"Not too impressed.   Okay, the food is pretty good, with some excellent entrees like the chicken and goat cheese corn dish and the falafel.  The disappointment begins and ends with service.   Dined there with some friends and they order hummus.  The hummus comes out with no dipping device.  Device requested, and out comes four (yes, that's 4) beet chips.  They are eaten with about 12% of the hummus.  Other 88% remains and more beet chips requested.  The answer was no. \"Why not?\" my friend asks.   \"Chef says no\".   Okay, we'll pay for them.  \"No\".    How strange.  Downhill from there.  I felt like I was on Seinfeld."}
{"text":"The food is great... Just sometimes would be nice to have some more options that aren't fried. Overall, food has been delicious each of the four times that we've come.   This particular visit was a bit tainted, unfortunately, by the brunette waitress who seemed annoyed to be there - and seemed way too rushed in her interaction with us (ie: walking away as she's speaking with us several times).   We'll give the Herb Box another try soon- and hopefully will be more impressed with the service."}
{"text":"First time in and we were impressed. Dylan was our server and he provided excellent service.  We shared the Kobe burger and the chicken salad. Both were great, however, the Kobe won hands down.  The atmosphere was warm, the live music was very enjoyable. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great food and great service! Started with a melon mule and brussel sprout chips. Then the butternut squash enchilada for dinner and chocolate bombe for dessert. Andy was a superb waiter."}
{"text":"Went to lunch with my dad at the Herb Box today.  It was a cool day, and quite breezy, but they had the huge windows over the bar open so it was freezing inside.  We decided to sit outside hoping that the sun would warm us up a little.  The hostess took us outside and said that she was going to sit us at one of the bar top tables on the edge of the patio, but the previous customers had not left yet, so would we mind sitting at a table right next to a large noisy party until they other customers left.  We said fine.  A couple minutes later she said it would be just another minute or two.  The other customers left and someone cleaned off the table.  We got up and walked over to the table and another employee told us it was reserved for another party.  I told her what the hostess had told us and she reluctantly let us have the table.  I ordered the Market Sunflower Salad.  Wow, was it disappointing.  Mostly lettuce with a small amount of chicken.  There were VERY FEW dried berries (could not tell what kind they were) and a couple of sunflower seeds.  You could barely see the cheese, and I think I tasted two bites of bacon.  For $15, this was very expensive lettuce.  Not much taste at all.  My dad ordered a sandwich which came with the house sweet potato chips.  The chips were soggy and chewy.  Pretty disgusting.  We pointed out the condition of the chips to the waitress and she was very apologetic and offered us a fresh bag to take home, but by that time we were pretty much done with this restaurant.  For an over $30 lunch it left much to be desired.  Herb Box used to be good, but the last couple of times we have come, it has been awful.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"Today was the second time I ate at the Herb Box.  Both times, I biked there from my house (about 7 miles).  The ride is completely worth it.  The restaurant is nestled in the sleepy Market Street shopping center near DC Ranch. They have a great patio with large umbrellas and power misters.    Everything we have tried on the menu is best in its class.  Today we had red velvet pancakes.  They were amazing and came with yummy bacon.  We also had the pork and egg chilaquiles.  SOOO GOOD.   This restaurant is reasonably priced.  I plan on going there every Sunday that i have available.  Bravo!"}
{"text":"We split the smoked salmon hash and BLT. Also had a glass of Poppy chardonnay, nice for the price  We sat on the pstio. Relaxing time."}
{"text":"I visited The Herb Box for lunch several weeks ago and thoroughly enjoyed the Coconut Shrimp Salad.  A friend mentioned that if I liked the lunch I would surely love their breakfast.  Don't have to tell me twice!  I suggested The Herb Box for brunch with my gal pals the very next week.  Unfortunately, I was a little let down.  Its not that the food was bad by any means... it just wasn't anything special.  I had the Goat Cheese and Chive Omelet.  I was disappointed by the tiny sprinkling of goat cheese over the top of my largely flavorless omelet.  My gut said \"Red velvet pancakes!  Get the red velvet pancakes!\" -- clearly I should have trusted my instincts.  I will admit that I am moderately at fault here, because apparently Sunday brunch (not Saturday breakfast) is where its at.  I am still giving The Herb Box a well deserved four star rating for my good lunch experience and because I am hopeful that Sunday brunch and maybe some red velvet pancakes will make me forget all about my lackluster omelet."}
{"text":"Yo, okay... This was STUPID good.   I came in around 2:30pm to have some lunch before I had to go into work. They were pretty dead when I got there. The servers/cooks look like they were all having a family meal (which Im all for!).  Melissa, my server, quickly got up and seated me! I look over the menu and everything looked bomb.com. I went with the uhhhh.. Cream corn squash enchiladas? (I forgot what it was called.)   Food came out in a timely manner and melissa was on POINT with giving me water and checking up on me. She's a sweetheart. YALL SHOULD GIVE HER A RAISE.   Everything about my meal was delicious. It came with some arugula salad--which was amazing. I... Ugh... I just felt like I was eating a little piece of heaven. As for the price, yeah its a lil pricey but hey... Im sure you're reading this review prior to going there, so you know what you're getting yourself into. I spent $25 for my $16 meal--its kind of a given for me to tip well from being in the service industry for years.   As for all these other bad reviews, yall need jesus. Or just take the stick out of your asses cuz this place was nothing but wonderful. Food was great, melissa was great. Everything was great!   I will be back *arnold shwarzenegger voice*"}
{"text":"Wow! We really enjoyed our dinner date here at the Herb Box. I've been meaning to try this location every time I'm in Scottsdale but I kept putting it off since we would find other Dining spots more to our liking, or so we thought. The Herb Box is located in Old Town but is anything but old. It's corner location which includes a market, wrap around patio seating and live music ( music was on a Friday not sure if it's avail daily) is a modern and welcoming spot great for breakfast, brunch, lunch or dinner.  We chose to dine inside where the AC kept us comfortably cool. The blackberry jasmine tea was so refreshing and my new favorite! We shared the spicy Thai ribs, few appetizers, and moved on to sangría and wine. There was no rush on our part or our friendly server's ... Much appreciated.  The menu is not overwhelming, just enough options to satisfy the pickiest of eaters. Vegans, vegetarians and Carnivores alike.   The Herb Box is truly a 4 star \"better than most\" dining spots in Scottsdale and we have added this restaurant to our list of favs."}
{"text":"IF you want a waitress that puts you down for complaining that the mac and cheese is cold EAT HERE!  \"Personally I would't eat it, it's too hot for my taste.\" As she sets it down after they re heated the mac.  UMMM....Yeah I LOVE eating cold mac and cheese. ( THE NEXT DAY! as left overs!) My husband ordered the steak salad and  he asked for it to be cooked medium, but it came out raw.  My flat bread was burnt almost black, and crispy, not the way I would or anyone with food sense would eat it.   The only thing good about this is place that the one star gets is the lemonade mango juice."}
{"text":"The Herb Box has always had a great, varied menu, which includes vegetarian, gluten-free and request gluten free options.  The desserts are wonderful.  What I had previously found lacking was the service.  After an absence of a few months, I am pleased to report, that the service at the Herb Box has improved dramatically with the addition of Vera.  She deftly and attentively handled our party of nine on Wednesday, Sept. 17.  We were there to celebrate a friend's birthday.  In addition to the usual tasks of serving and refilling water glasses, etc., Vera made knowledgeable recommendations about entrees and other menu items, along with wine suggestions.  Looking forward to going back and requesting a table in Vera's section."}
{"text":"This a great place to go and relax and have a great cup of coffee! The staff is amazing best iv seen! They are attentive and genuinely care about you the customer. Justin makes the best drinks! Ask him for a yummy drink! This a great place to go and relax and have a great cup of coffee! The staff is amazing best iv seen! They are attentive and genuinely care about you the customer. Justin makes the best drinks! Ask him for a yummy drink!"}
{"text":"This was just...  OK.  After hearing and reading so many great things about The Herb Box I was sure I would really enjoy it.  Well, no.  Not so much.  Especially disappointing because my Mom was with me during an all-too-brief visit to AZ, and I really wanted to take her somewhere great.    We arrived around 1:30, purposefully avoiding the 'lunch rush'.  I thought this would be a good thing.  What we found was a disorganized and distracted staff and a lot of uncleared tables.  Once we were seated and given menus, we were pretty much abandoned for a good 10 minutes.  At last a couple of glasses of water arrived, but the waitress disappeared again before we could place our order.  She came in and out of the dining area, seating others and even taking their orders, but didn't acknowledge us until I was ready to A) fold the menu into a paper airplane and aim it at her head and B) leave.  Helloooooooooo????  At last we were able to order.  Hooray!  Wait, don't get excited yet, she didn't enter the orders into the terminal.  Oops.  When we finally received our food it was not exactly worth waiting that long for, either.  I had the Market Sunflower Salad and my mom had the Blackened Chicken Caesar Wrap.  While good, I don't think either dish warranted the $12 price tags.  It is lettuce and chicken, people.  Really.  Yes, the location is 'cute' and 'quaint'.  Yes the ingredients are fresh.  Perhaps if we had a different waitress I would have been happier."}
{"text":"Favorite restaurant!!! Mmm. White bean chili soup is the best I've ever had, loved the steak, fried chicken, fingerling potatoes and more! Can't go wrong"}
{"text":"Updating my review since I came here for dinner. The vibe and ambiance is really cool but the service is not so great. I had to ask for water refills, ask for plates, ask for silverware, ask for the check... The waitress never asked if we needed anything and didn't even provide the decent and normal service of a restaurant.  There was bits of cork in my $15 wine too that I had to pick out.  Their only vegan option on the menu was not that good... could barely cut through the cauliflower.  Would not come back here because of the service. I'm so thirsty right now ugh!!"}
{"text":"I came here today for lunch with my elderly and handicapped friend.  The food was delicious but I wanted to comment on our wonderful server,  Katie. She was very attentive,  kind and patient.  My friend wanted dessert but walking to the dessert counter was difficult for her.  Katie went above and beyond to assist her in choosing a dessert. Thank you so much,  Katie, for making our dining experience such a pleasurable experience!"}
{"text":"Wow, after my third visit to the Herb Box for lunch today, this one is really teetering between 4 and 5 stars.  I love, love, love this place for lunch (which coincidentally is the only time I've been here, but I suspect that if I went for dinner, brunch, or happy hour, I might love it too as the menu appears to be largely the same.)  I've now tried the Grow Happy salad, the Vegan Nosh, and the Butternut Enchiladas, and all were really delicious, but the Vegan Nosh and Butternut Enchiladas are what I would call...special...above and beyond your usual lunch fare.  Vegan Nosh also has the presentation going for it with 4 different salads in 4 bowls on a wooden slab.  When I order it, people have a tendency to go \"wow, that's a lot of food\" and yeah, it is, but it's probably the same amount of food as a large salad (and twice as delicious).  This is not the cheapest place, but it is pretty, the food is pretty, and the food is delicious.  It's in my rotation for sure."}
{"text":"Casual atmosphere well thought out decor and a nice penny farland hanging on the wall.  Ordered asparagus and fennel frites and brown sugar pork ciabatta.  We'll see how it is but the descriptions of the food make you expect wonderful flavor.  Amazing.  This place better be here for a long time because I will come back every time I am in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"One of my favorite local restaurants - especially on a Saturday night with the live music. Great ambiance, great appetizers, great wine and entrees. Only complaint would be sometimes it is too loud to talk or hear your company at dinner. Great spot on Market Street, too!"}
{"text":"Sophie you were right!  OH! MY! GOD!  That doesn't even begin to cover it!   Very cute place, I sat in the center patio corridor with the market to the left and the dining room to the right.  Everything sounded so delicious! I decided on the Artichoke and White Bean Hummus and the Butternut Squash and Corn Enchiladas which came with a wonderful salad (see pictures)  Every bite was delectable, I couldn't bear the thought of wasting so of course I finished every last bite of it all!  I know I must sound like a cow but unfortunately I'm lacking the 3 extra stomachs to take advantage of the rest of the menu.......those would have come in really handy because I didn't want to leave, I Was in Food Heaven!  Deliciously Fresh and Gourmet!  My 5 stars are for the food experience  The service was actually awful, as I had to get up to retrieve my own silverware and even help my self to the Ice tea pitcher because some one never refilled my glass!  They say Love is Blind right ,and I LOVED the Food so I'll over look the lazy service."}
{"text":"Two words: WOW....with an  'F'! This place was SOOO good!  The eclectic -yet healthy- menu had great choices to choose from.   We started with the ever-popular crab dip with plaintains (YUM!) and a cucumber basil mojito and an Ommegang Red Vos (amber ale) (double Yum)....and then we got to dinner.  Oh man! My wife had the Thai baby-back ribs with Mac-n-cheese. She couldn't stop moaning. And she had the bigger of the meals! Haha  I had a blackened chicken-n-avocado kale salad. Sounds light but it was healthy and very good and filling. And I still hold my man card!   To top it all off, because it was our first time here, the manager treated us to dessert! How can you write something negative about that?? We had the \"Oh My!...Crack Pie!\" Oh my!! Very good but not addictive like crack (so I'm told!)  All this and we'd be remiss not to mention service. Slow initially, then non-stop good, smiling pleasant service by Vicki.   Awesome overall experience!"}
{"text":"I made my first visit at The Herb Box by the canal in the Old Town Scottsdale area today. I do miss the old location at Scottsale & Shea, but I can see why they would want to escape that small hidden corner and make itself more accessible and less inconspicuous to the public. The menu is still modern American, light, healthy, and full of flavor. The inside of the restaurant is very pleasant and the staff was very pleasant and welcoming. It differs from the old Scottsdale & Shea location in that it doesn't have a small grocery store area with offerings of their creations prepackaged to purchase and take home with you, but it does have an exterior seating area with more of a patio feel.   During this visit, I decided to go for something I hadn't tried before. For an appetizer, I had the asparagus and fennel frites, which was breaded asparagus with a dipping sauce. Along with the asparagus was extra breading that appeared to be deep-fried. I believe the fennel in this dish was in the dipping sauce. As a main dish, I had the butternut squash corn enchiladas. It consisted of two enchiladas about 5 or 6 inches long and maybe an 1-1/2 inches wide and high. The other three-quarters of my plate was a salad. I loved it. It was very tasty, but it was a little too light for me. It didn't occur to me prior to selecting it that the dish lacked the protein that I so need to feel satiated so I ended up having the other half of my companion's grilled chicken & sage pesto sandwich, which I've had before. My only complaint is the ciabatta bread in the sandwich wasn't toasted enough.   Anyway, the Herb Box deserves high marks for uniqueness in food and the great location. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place in the entire Arizona Valley (that's a lot of restaurants). The food here is absolutely spectacular and you can easily tell that the people that work her love it just as much. There are so many options for people regardless of dietary restrictions or preferences! Below are a few highlights that have become our regular food items that I order.  Crispy Brussel Sprout Chips - even if you don't like brussel sprouts, you need to try these! Absolutely amazing & the vegan aioli that use with it is like icing on a cake.  Avocado Love - another great shared plate. The dish has a little bit of a heat to it because of the sweet-hot serrano glaze but the flavor is fantastic.  Pear & Gorgonzola Flatbread - amazing, it's a must have. definitely a great shared plate but also good as a main entree depending on how hungry you are.  Vegetarian Sweet Potato Tacos - this dish is great for an entree - as long as everything is prepared well. I have had a couple mishaps with it. One time the sweet potatoes seemed like they weren't cooked all the way and another time it was a little spicier than the time before that. Other than those 2 times, every other time the tacos were delicious!  I would 100% recommend this restaurant for anyone to try. Their happy hour is fantastic and they also have live music on the weekends! Luckily, they have 2 other locations other than this one so regardless of where you live or where you are visiting in the valley, there is one near you!"}
{"text":"Always fresh, tastes healthy and always delish- and beautifully presented in a pretty spot!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner..really nice ambiance for the night.   Thai short ribs were overcooked and dry. Gouda mac was decent.   Crab dip was sub par...very minimal crab. More like a cilantro sauce with a few pieces of crab thrown in.   Brie burger was the best thing we ordered. Quite flavorful and cooked to a perfect medium as requested.    Waiter asked how things were and I mentioned the ribs were overcooked and he said \"oh?\" and walked away. Guess he was just curious..."}
{"text":"I met friends here for Sunday brunch last weekend.  Well, we actually met down the street at Breakfast Club, but the wait was 45 minutes, and we were already ravenous.  Zero wait at the Herb Box.  Yay!  Already off to a great start.  We grabbed a table indoors (patio was full).  I don't think the AC was on; we were all pretty sweaty in our seats.  I ordered the breakfast burrito with \"laura g's award winning salsa\" and a refreshing fruit salad.  It was good, but I've had better salsas.  Also ordered at our table were the breakfast brisket sandwich (impossibly messy but weighed in favorably with those who tried it), red velvet pancakes (good, but got soggy quickly), granola (A+) and coffees (also good).  And maybe something else I'm forgetting.  It was a successful brunch.  Perhaps a little overpriced, but you get some decent and innovative options to choose from."}
{"text":"Lunch was tasty.  The waitress had a bad night or a bad life.  My guest and I went  bottom feeding as I try and keep lunch to forty dollars.  This is not easy at an eatery where every item is ale carte. No bread or desert today.  Bottled water.  No cocktail.  I have lunch once per week at a different  eatery each time.  Try the burrito with pork. The slaw with it was especially good."}
{"text":"What a great place! Our server, Andy was nothing short of awesome, and the food was terrific.   For appetizers, (half off before 6 pm, drinks too) we had short rib tacos, a martini shrimp thing, and the cilantro lime crab dip. The tacos were delicious. The short ribs were done perfectly and the salsa mix was delicious. My friends said the shrimp was great. The dip came with plantain chips which in combo with the dip was apparently, amazing.  For dinner, I had the butternut squash enchiladas. Inside were chopped up pieces of butternut squash, corn, and cotijo cheese. It was served with a big salad. Overall, it was delicious. I had to ask for extra sauce because it was so tasty in combo with each bite of enchilada. My friend also got the enchiladas but wanted meat with it so they added a layer of the short rib meat on top which was great of them and he cleaned his plate. The others got the Thai BBQ ribs and trout. Both were great. Now, I was a bit skeptical of an American place with Thai style BBQ ribs but they did a fairly good job. Were they raditional Thai ribs? No, but good nonetheless.  Sadly, we were all too full to enjoy dessert."}
{"text":"Stopped here with my family awhile back for lunch. It was a gorgeous day out so we asked to sit outside and the hostess sat us immediately. Our server was wonderful and very attentive. My parents had already been to this restaurant so they offered some suggestions.   We started with the Brussel sprouts appetizer. They were cooked perfectly, which some charring and then covered in a light and delicious sauce. These were gone within minutes of them being delivered to our table. I ordered the sweet potato avocado bowl. It comes with quinoa, sweet potatoes, avocado, black beans and more. I added grilled shrimp for some extra protein. The meal was delicious and everything tasted super fresh. My sister ordered the crispy chicken blt, but got the chicken grilled instead of fried. This sandwich came with sweet potato chips that were very delicious. My dad ordered the blackened salmon BLT. I am not a fan of salmon, but he said the sandwich was cooked perfectly and had tons of flavor. His sandwich also came with sweet potato chips. My mom ordered the avocado shrimp salad and loved it. All fresh ingredients and the dressing really added to the flavor of the meal.   Overall this is a wonderful place to have some lunch. Great food, wonderful service and reasonable prices. Definitely worth checking out if you are in the area."}
{"text":"I love the cafe.  It's great if you wanna get a quick lunch.  They have lunch for $11 two sides and a main dish. I love the butternut squash enchiladas and the beat salad yummy!  All organic and fresh."}
{"text":"I was excited to come here for dinner hoping to get gf, vegan options to eat. We started with the veg nosh board which was awesome!! The cauliflower was not gf so I did not have it but my guys loved it. It came on a bed of quinoa which was simple but good. The kale pakoras were excellent and crispy, the Brussels sprout chips were crunchy and flavourful and the edamame was mildly flavoured but delicious. The pakoras and Brussels sprouts had an aioli type sauce with them.  Unfortunately, beyond these apps there was nothing else for me to order. I even went down to their little cafe to see if I could have anything from there but everything else that was vegetarian had dairy in it. Luckily it was still happy hour so I got another order of the pakoras and Brussel sprouts for $5 each. The problem was that all these items were deep fried and I felt nauseous after. Hubby had the ribs but couldn't eat the Mac and cheese with it. My son enjoyed his shrimp. Hubby enjoyed 2 drinks for $6 each during happy hour which ends promptly at 6pm.  For dessert we shared the only gf, vegan dessert...the pumpkin cheesecake. I was not a fan....it was dense and tasted ok, but did not satisfy my sweet tooth. The restaurant is trendy and open, with a nice patio area. The staff are nice and the washrooms are large and clean."}
{"text":"Went here for Sunday brunch with a few girlfriends and it was great! The pakora was fantastic. The crab dip was amazing. The French toast was excellent. I was too full to finish it. Waitress was patient and good about explaining items and recommending things with it being our first time there. Very nice atmosphere. It was very cozy. I will definitely be back for dinner"}
{"text":"The Herb Box is an excellent choice for a fun dining experience. The menu has interesting choices for any palette. Our wait person, Beau, gave us superb service. His food suggestions were spot on, as well as other fun places to visit in the Scottsdale area. It is refreshing to find a unique restaurant where the food is delicious and the staff truly enjoys their customers. I look forward to returning to this restaurant again and again."}
{"text":"Mothers Day...great food. Disappointed with service. Waiters walk by and look the other way. Attention to detail is in the food but not the staff~"}
{"text":"Great food. Interesting, trendy, different. Good with allergies, vegan, vegetarian etc. Really interesting kale chips. Vegan Nosh Board total winner. Friendly."}
{"text":"Went last week and it was warm and uncomfortable inside. Asked to be moved to back and was told they would have to check since they had many reservations. We made reservations too! Got moved back and no one showed up to fill the back area while we were there. Food was good. Server was not around most of the time. Also, one restroom is not enough. There was a line up. Had to come back a second time. Not sure if we'd go for a date here again given all the other nearby restaurants."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time last week. Food was great and so was the service too. My friend and I ordered the cilantro lime crab dip. It was a very refreshing dip. Not a warm one like most dips are so this would definitely be an excellent choice during the summer for an appetizer.   I ordered the blackened BLT and my friend ordered the short rib enchiladas. I really enjoyed my sandwich. I was worried that the fish would come out dry since most salmon in sandwiches are thin and over cooked. This was actually a nice thick moist piece and it was cooked perfectly. I had a side of sweet potato chips that were lightly sprinkled with salt. It was a nice addition to the sandwich.  This is a great place to take your girlfriends to if you happen to be in the DC Ranch area.   There are plenty of tables outside and they keep all the windows open for inside seating. I imagine it would be quite crowded in the summertime there with people choosing to sit indoors.   Average price for meals and appetizers was around $15 each. Well worth it."}
{"text":"Jasmin(i believe that was her name) was very sweet and made sure my coffee was to my liking even when i didnt want to inconvenience her. I had a migrane and was going to drink the coffee as it was. But she was lovely and insisted on making sure it was perfect for me. Thank you for my raspberry latte it helped ease my migrane i look forward to the next time I visit my mother here in AZ, to have another latte and great customer service"}
{"text":"Poor service for blacks. We waited a full 20 minutes before we were asked for drinks. Another black family came in and they waited 30 minutes before their drinks were served. It's 2018, this kind of childish behavior is absolutely unacceptable and inexcusable. I was really excited to try this place. Very shameful."}
{"text":"Simple one of the best options anywhere in the valley. If your party includes a vegetarian it may be the best option. Vegetarian nosh is superb and the meat options were seasoned perfectly and delicious. Bravo Herb box! we'll be back and we'll be hungry"}
{"text":"My friend got the achiote turkey torta (turkey sub) and I got the chicken BLT. Mine was incredibly salty and nearly inedible. It was soggy and tasted so bad. Definitely over priced. My friend's looked like an old, soggy deli sandwich from the grocery store. Tasted okay at best. Service was slow, pushy and hard to flag down."}
{"text":"The food was very fresh and juicy. My fiancé and I ordered a shrimp salad and a 3 course dinner which was not on the menu. All of the dishes were good but it was not a 'wow' type of dishes. I brought my dog and sat out on the patio, they were very nice and gave him a water bowl."}
{"text":"Good service but the food I ordered was sub par. The highlight was the tomato soup but the brisket tacos weren't very good. They were very soggy leading them to break before you could even eat them (I ended up treating them like a salad) and the brisket was not cooked well, it was over cooked and chewy. :( I really wanted to be WOW'd but unfortunately the Herb Box fell short."}
{"text":"Sunday brunch was so good.... crispy shrimp salad with arugula on top of avocado toast and the flash fried Brussel Sprouts - those were to die for!!! The new location was nice had a great bartender. Can't wait to go back !"}
{"text":"The Herb Box is quite possibly my favorite lunch spot in Old Town.  It's definitely the first place to pop in my mind when someone asks where they/we should go to lunch.  The atmosphere is my second favorite part, next to the brown sugar pork ciabatta, which I'll get to in a minute.  The Herb Box offers a rustic/nautical feel, with white and blue wood throughout along with circular mirrors, resembling a sea-side eatery back home.  The inside is a funky combination of homey and trendy, providing a comfort that the food is going to be just as good.  It's always a toss-up to sit inside or out on the patio, no matter the time of year.  The dining room is hard to beat, but the outdoor patio is equally as great with the perfect amount of shade + misters for hot summer days.  Wherever you chose to sit, somehow find your way to the ladie's/men's room as the restrooms are probably my third favorite part of HB - never thought the bathrooms would make it into my reviews, but HB puts a touch of class on every aspect of their café.  Now on to the food: I have tasted a solid third of HB's menu.  Everything is good, I haven't had one thing that I was disappointed in.  As with many of my favorite restaurants, there is a reason it's a favorite because one item stands out above the rest.  The pork ciabatta does it for me.  I should start by describing how large the portion is - be prepared to take part of your lunch home unless you're super hungry.  The pulled pork is served with an interesting complement of jicama and red pepper slaw.  The flavors are so, so good.  Of course served on ciabatta, which who doesn't love ciabatta?  All of their sandwiches come with a side of their homemade sweet potato chips, which are definitely worth the carbs.  If you're feel frisky, order a side of their red pepper aioli to give your sweet potato chips a little zing.  My order isn't complete with one of their many flavors of iced teas.  I have recently become obsessed with their mango and green tea combo.  If you're making an event out of lunch or plan to stay longer, go for the cheeseboard of the moment as a starter.  My fiance and I are cheese-aholics, and their cheeseboard is delectable, accompanied with fruit, jam, honey and nuts - yum.  If you're wondering where to go on your tour of Old Town either as a tourist or a local, I hope you make a smart decision and go to the Herb Box, you will be so happy you did."}
{"text":"this location is much cozier than the old town counterpart. Service is friendly, food is excellent.... Great place to go for lunch, brunch, or dinner. Though for dinner it may get kind of cramped. For breakfast, I recommend the manchego omlette."}
{"text":"My boyfriend brought me and some friends here for my birthday in January. I don't recall what everyone got, but everyone LOVED what they got. The atmosphere was really great, I thought it was a low key beautiful place. Really great drinks and highly suggested for a night out with some friends to their delicious appetizers. We shared a bunch of appetizers and hands down my favorite was the Buffalo Cauliflower! YUMMMMM! I recently started eating vegetarian within the last 7 months (or at least trying) and my favorite thing to eat is boneless buffalo wings. Our extremely friendly waiter suggested the buffalo cauliflower appetizer and I loved them so much that I ordered a second round just for myself! I would definitely go again, and I would definitely order 2 of these again!!!"}
{"text":"Had lunch in the downstairs walk-up deli.  The panini and the smoked gouda mac & cheese were second to none.  Loved it!"}
{"text":"The Herb Box is our go-to restaurant when we visit Scottsdale. Our favorites to order are the Brussel sprout chips and the Thai BBQ ribs with Gouda Mac and Cheese. Our friends tried the steak and said it was awesome. Service is always friendly and we like the ambience."}
{"text":"Ate take-out from the Herb Box two days in a row and really liked everything we had...we really did a tour de menu.  The highlights were the Korean Cauliflower, the Brussels Sprouts flatbread, the Salmon BLT, and the Salmon Hash. All were interesting, fresh, unique, and tasty. We also liked the Date Cake and Avocado Toast.  Lovely atmosphere, nice servers, great locations...I'd go back any time."}
{"text":"Excellent vegetarian gluten free entree. Wonderful service and wine. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Food OK. For lunch. Found it a little odd though when manager comes by asking if everything was OK and stated you didn't get poisoned. Who says that it's your own employer/restaurant. And I'd give it in a one and a half if I could cut a half a star. Won't be back in case they're serving poison"}
{"text":"I recently had lunch at The Herb Box on Pima road in Scottsdale. My boss and I stopped in to get something \"healthy\" as he put it. As I had never been there before and not really a fan of trying new things I reluctantly agreed to go with reservations.  The restaurant itself was open and airy and very comfortable. The staff was engaging and extremely helpful. My boss ordered the Serrano Avocado Shrimp Salad and I ordered the Chicken Arugula Wrap with house sweet chips, we also ordered Kale, Corn & Sweet Onion Pakora. I was skeptical of the Kale dish not a big fan of Kale - It came out first and I placed some on my plate - My initial reaction was eh but when I took my first bite - WOW -it was light and delicately flakey and crumpled as I ate it. I was sold from the very first bite - we devoured this dish and I wanted more but the other dishes were arriving so I started in with my Chicken Arugula Wrap. All I can say is it was superb! The flavors were wonderful and the chips were fantastic. As you can tell from previous posts of mine I don't tend to gush but I could eat that same meal every day! I highly recommend The Herb Box!"}
{"text":"Sit at the bar - ask for Brooks(what a great bartender) - order any of the great cocktails or ask what the have for liquor (some amazing Bourbons!)  Then, order the brussel sprout/pancetta flatbread with the thai bbq ribs (which comes with a side of gouda mac n' cheese), and you're in heaven!  Loved it.  Been twice, and will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"The decor was really nice!  I kept commenting to my brother how I liked the chairs.  But we weren't there for furniture.  If I was asked about the Herb Box, my first reaction would be - it's expensive!  We went for breakfast recently and while it was a larger party of 10 people, I still think it was a very expensive breakfast.  In all fairness to the Herb Box, we did order appetizers, but even factoring that in, it was still a much more expensive breakfast than I'm used to. My breakfast tab is usually around $50-$60 in more trendier restaurants and certainly much less for more basic stops.  Split 3 ways and with tip, my portion was $85!  In any event, with 10 people, there were plenty of different orders to share around the table.  I got the chilaquiles verde, while my wife got the simple good morning eggs & bacon.  My dish included pulled pork which I found to be largely flavorless.  Substantial doses of salt and pepper finally added some flavor to the dish.  However, I was only able to power through about half the dish before abandoning it.  My wife's dish was as simple as you can get, thus the name of it.  However, they got the egg order incorrect.  She asked for sunny side up, but got eggs over easy.  No big deal, but if you're going to ask how you want your eggs to be cooked, it should be done correctly.  My wife (and I) are not one to say anything, particularly if it's not a big deal - but worth mentioning here per my previous point.  My brother ordered the market street blt and his reaction was one of indifference.  My sister-in-law got the smoked salmon hash and seemed to enjoy it, but also didn't give any rave reviews.  My sister ordered the kobe burger and thought it was fine.  However, the fingerling potatoes were phenomenal!  Not all was lost though, as noted, we ordered a couple appetizers.  The crisp brussels sprout chips were just out of this world!  I could eat a whole bowl of that stuff.  We also ordered the avocado love.  My wife loved it because she could eat avocados all day long!  Service was excellent.  Very attentive group of folks - we were served by no less than 3 different people.  We had 4 small children with us and they were very patient with our multiple asks.  As such, they deserved and got a very good tip.  Great vibe, just wished the food stood up a little better - particularly given the price."}
{"text":"Erin had a very confusing Sunday yesterday. To set the mood off, I was SOOO excited to meet some GFs for Sunday fare at Geisha A-Go-Go. Didn't realize they didn't open until late afternoon (it was 1pm). Any true sushi fanatic can tell you, when the heart wants sushi, it wants sushi.  But we made our \"Plan B\" option as The Herb Box. Okay, great! Still want sushi, but am excited to try this new place.  Well, as it turns out - I thought the little place on the corner was The Herb Box - it's not. That's the Herb Box Market! Not a lot of seating outside either. This was all let out in the open when I couldn't find my damn friends at the hostess station.   Thought the girl who took my order was rather aloof, but did learn she was pretty new on the job so I cut her major slack.   Ordered their Breakfast Burrito - it was good, but nothing to write home about. My GFs had buckwheat pancakes and pulled pork street tacos.   I'll go back - but this time - to the real McCoy, as their patio furniture was a bit stained and weathered."}
{"text":"Every time I come here the food is amazing. The Serrano-Avocado Shrimp Salad was soooo good. It's toast with an avocado smear, topped with shrimp, arugula, and a honey-lime vinaigrette. To die for! I want another one right now!  The cucumber basil mojito was very tasty and refreshing.   This particular time at the restaurant stood out because of our server, Drew. He had the best personality and was so bubbly and helpful. Happy to answer any and all questions and provided great customer service. Logan was his trainee and he was just as pleasant and helpful as Drew.   The Herb Box is quickly becoming my new favorite spot :-)"}
{"text":"After having a bad experience with the service a few months ago, I decided to give the Herb Box a shot at redemption. The service was much better this time, and food  was great once again.  Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"We were visiting from So Cal & went here on a co-workers recommendation. It was a perfect experience from start to finish. Our server Andy was both charming & helpful. On his suggestion, we ordered the Avocado Love & the Butternut Squash Enchiladas & they were both amazing!!! We will definitely be back on our next visit to Scottsdale - hopefully on a night Andy is working!"}
{"text":"Marvelous outdoor patio. Service was friendly and attentive. I had salmon blt sandwich on ciabatta which was quite nice. My bride asked for chicken, rather than turkey on her wrap. They were happy to accommodate. It came with arugula, bacon and cashews.   Very good sweet potato chips. Highly recommend as to all facets of a great lunch!"}
{"text":"I loved this place! Great food. Inspiring cuisine. Fantastic service. The patio was a beautiful place to chill and find some shade. Thanks for a very enjoyable experience!!!"}
{"text":"The hostess was a bit standoff but the other staff were friendly. Service was slow, even though it wasn't busy. The atmosphere is nice. Menu was interesting. I really liked the fried plantains. My steak salad was good. My husbands salmon was good but portion a little small."}
{"text":"I get to Scottsdale a couple of times a year, so I've been lucky enough to hit the Herb Box a couple of times since it opened in downtown Scottsdale.   My first visit was for brunch..I had the famous red velvet pancakes. Oh laaarwd...honey. Those pancakes are a religious experience. I don't remember what else we ordered because the pancakes were stupid-good. As if it wasn't enough, I had a couple of mimosas too. I'd say it was um....better than...most breakfasts I've had.   The second time was a laaazy lunch with a girlfriend. We each has a flatbread she Brussel sprout and pancetta on the recommendation of our server,  I had pear and gorgonzola. Let me begin by saying that pear and gorgonzola is one of my favorite flavor combinations..and brussel sprouts, decidedly not. BUT, here, the sprouts are grilled and that pancetta is that salty goodness. OHHHHHHHH-MY. That flatbreat blew my pear and gorgonzola out of the water.   We also had a couple of drinks off their drink menu, I had a cucumber water-mint number with vodka that was perfectly refreshing for a summer day in Scottsdale. My girlfriend had a raspberry mojioto (if I remember correctly) and it was pretty fabulous as well. Don't tell anyone..but we didn't stop at one.   Out server was a pro. She has us at \"go\". She was funny and attentive and patient with our endless requests for more water and limes. I can not NOT for the life of me remember her..but she was fantastic and a pro.  If you go, get those red velvet pancakes..and listen when your server makes a recommendation..they know their stuff there."}
{"text":"I have been to this location quite a few times for lunch as I work right down the street, and I have got to say that I have mixed feelings about it. The food is 4 star worthy, however, the service is always a 2. I love the variety of the menu and the fact that they have many gluten free options. The cilantro-jalapeno edamame hummus with pistachio-rosemary crisps is amazing! Regrettably, I did not enjoy the market street short rib tacos the last time I dined at The Herb Box. They were so incredibly bland and greasy! There was literally grease dripping out of each end of the taco! The tacos were my first bad food experience though. Everything else I have ever gotten has been great!   Now, onto the service. I have NEVER had a decent waiter/waitress or bartender! EVER! Everyone always seems to be too busy with their own lives, and talking with the hostess to pay any attention to customers. Everyone seems to have the same \"don't care attitude\". It is a struggle to put a drink order in at the bar with any of the bartenders as they speak about themselves at great length, or sit in the corner and watch TV. If you are not a regular at the bar forget it, you will have to fight for acknowledgment!  You have to go out of your way to get anyone's attention that's for sure. Make sure you ask for everything that you want when you first place your order because asking for a side of something after your food has come out will guarantee an eye roll and massive sigh.  Go here for the food, not the service!"}
{"text":"Went there for Sunday brunch. Great menu with a nice variety of eclectic dishes. $5 Bloody Mary's. Gary is a friendly host and bartender that puts a smile on everyone's face. Great food and friendly atmosphere. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The Herb Box is my go to in Old Town Scottsdale.  Go for the sweet potato tacos... they will never let you down.  For a quick bite on the go you can always stop by the marketplace which is always stocked with wraps, salads, and the like.  Always fresh and always good."}
{"text":"Took our youngest daughter here for a quick breakfast but she has some allergy issues. She was able to order the gluten-free cinnamon pancakes and absolutely LOVED them. Quaint atmosphere and reasonably priced. Friendly service. The mango lemonade was a hit too. Overall, a good experience. I look forward to bringing the rest of our family up here. Nice morning at the Herb Box!"}
{"text":"Sadly, my two stars are simply because the service and attitude of the staff at this location is ridiculous.  The food is delicious and because of that I tried to only get takeout, to avoid the snobby, aloof, and horrible service workers.  But sadly, even takeout leaves me feeling unappreciated as customer.   I really have no idea why these employees are so terrible.  Rude and inattentive.  I will never go back to this location."}
{"text":"My husband and I love eating at The Herb Box and especially love the Thai Ribs.  You are probably thinking to yourself, ribs at a non-BBQ establishment, but let me tell you, these are the fall off the bones, melt in your mouth, piece of heaven I have tasted in a long time!  I also love the weekend brunch with flavored mimosas...yummy!!!  I wish I could frequent every week =)"}
{"text":"This wil get upgraded to four stars I hope.. The Food, and the atmosphere  are fantastic, and all of the food we had was very good. The Butternut squash enchiladas are good, but paired with the salad, they were amazing. The service was not good at all, You could totally tell that our server did not want to be there, and she was quite annoyed with something, and it came across to all of her tables.. Did I really pay 12 bucks for a creme brulee? Some of their pricing is Way out of whack.. Dc Ranch or not...Food 4.5, Atmoshphere 4, service 1.5"}
{"text":"Food and service were amazing.  We had the panchetta and brussel sprout flat bread and the smoked salmon scramble.  Service was right on with the check-ups and ensuring that we had everything we needed without bothering our conversation or meal.  I love the decor and open feel to the restaurant.  Definately a return for a brunch service!"}
{"text":"LOVE your brunch. the patio is so relaxing and I love being here for brunch when the market is going on and a little live music is playing. What could make you love living in Scottsdale more than the fact that places like Herb Box exist for your enjoyment? Food was excellent, service is always great and the décor makes me wish I had enough money to hire their decorator for my house one day. This is the perfect place for ladies who lunch and the patio is pet friendly too!"}
{"text":"Excellent service! Thanks you John, for taking such good care of me and my friends.  The food however, needs tweaking, bread pudding and coffee urns need to be hot, salads on plates would be easier to eat instead of bowls. And maybe a little anchovie in the caesar and less bing cherries? Beautiful patio though."}
{"text":"I am a regular at Herb Box and I think the food is great! However, I was there on Saturday, when there wasn't much of a wait, and the service was quiet slow. I sat at a table for awhile before a server greeted me, so it wasn't off to a great start. However, once we got our food, it was back to what I know and love from Herb Box. The Sunflower Salad is my favorite dish and it never disappoints. The iced green tea is also delicious, especially on a hot AZ day.  I will continue to come to Herb Box because the food is great. Hopefully, the slow service on Saturday was just a fluke and I can update my review the next time I visit, which I am sure won't be too long away."}
{"text":"Very loud inside, not a lot of thought in the space with voices bouncing off the walls.  Creme Brulee was awful, undercooked and was basically lemon pudding.  Blackberry Mojito is awful, tasted like redbull.  For a high priced joint the experience left a lot to be desired.  This place is not competitive with other restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Good little place in old town across from Cowboy Ciao. Had the turkey apple swiss wrap w/ dried cranberries,local greens, smoked bacon, and cashews. Very good and great size. The lady had the grilled chicken & sage pesto sandwich w/ goat cheese, gala apple, and smoked bacon. She liked it as well. The sweet potato chips were very good too. will be back for sure."}
{"text":"We enjoyed the Serrano Shrimp salad and the exceptionally tasty Salmon BLT. The flash fried fingerling potatoes were amazing. Great seats on the patio for Sunday brunch. One of the best meals of our Scottsdale trip!!!"}
{"text":"Came back to give second try. As bad as first time. Went to Living Room in same plaza and had 5 star service and meal."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here a few times now. We've enjoyed their bread pudding and s'mores crème brulee on a previous trip. The bread pudding was decadent with ice cream smothering it. The s'mores crème brulee came with chocolate crème brulee, house-made graham crackers, and dipped marshmallows. It was good but excessive. Definitely a dessert to share.  My recent trip was to try the cronuts (or doissants or whatever) that everyone has been raving about. When I arrived, the bakery case only had one butterscotch cronut left. I asked the employee behind the counter about some of the other pastries (they had a delicious looking blueberry tart) and decided I might as well get the cronut. She told me it was the last one of the day - once they run out they are gone for the day. I took it to go and enjoyed it later that night. (It tasted like a regular donut with cream filling. I don't get what the craze is!)  Overall, the Herb Box is a great place for lunch and desserts. (Either location.) This particular location has become more of a dessert spot for me. I love that they have a large patio for both the restaurant and take-away spot."}
{"text":"My sister-in-law (Shannon) was in town so we wanted to treat her to breakfast. We were going to another breakfast place in the DC Marketplace but the wait was over 30 minutes, so we decided to head over to Herb Box.  I have heard so many good things about Herb Box's brunch and I am so glad we went because it was the best brunch I have had in a long time!   Luckily, there was no wait to be seated and we were seated inside the restaurant. Our waitress was friendly and quick to take our drink orders. I ordered a vanilla latte, Shannon ordered freshly squeezed orange juice and my husband ordered mango lemonade. For brunch, Shannon ordered the Red Velvet Pancakes and my husband ordered an omelet. I couldn't decide between the cinnamon pancakes or the bourbon peach French toast and asked our waitress which was better. She told me that the French toast was definitely a favorite and was almost sold out for the day. I jumped on that and was so glad I did.   Our drinks arrived shortly and I really liked my latte. It came in a tall clear glass, reminiscent of what you'd normally serve an Irish Coffee in. My latte was both sweet and bitter at the same time which was delicious. Shannon enjoyed her orange juice since it was freshly squeezed and sweet. My husband enjoyed his mango lemonade but I thought it was a little watered down.  Next, our food arrived. Upon first bite of my French toast, I was in heaven. My husband described it like eating bread pudding for breakfast and he was right. It was both heavy and light at the same time and the flavors were outstanding. I didn't even need the maple syrup they serve alongside it - the bourbon did an excellent job. It came with bacon and the bacon was crispy and delicious. Shannon enjoyed her pancakes and I tried a bite. It was truly like eating cake - super moist and chocolaty. My husband enjoyed his omelet and I agreed it was delicious. The Brussels, manchego and pancetta really blended well together.   Overall, it was a fantastic brunch. It was so delicious and decadent. I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"This place has amazing food! WHAT TO GET: appetizer: \"Avocado Love\" it's trademarked! For dinner I got the candied grapefruit salmon. I was tempted to lick the plate! Drinks were good. My group got the margaritas-didn't hear any complaints. Atmosphere is very airy and intimate. Not too loud. I recommend this place if you're looking for food that's healthy and an environment that's unique and sophisticated. Get the salmon for me! ;)"}
{"text":"Herb box is one of my favorite places! The restaurant is super cute and the food is really good. They use quality ingredients and their dishes are creative. Highly recommend the sweet potato tacos. It's also one of my go-to places for brunch. They're brunch is pretty popular. I recommend making reservations for brunch, but you can generally get in pretty quick for dinner. They also have a little market where you get delicious food to go."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place.  The concept is wonderful, everything is farm fresh, organic, and/or vegetarian.  My mouth watered at the words on the menu.  But, alas, my love never came to be.  We started with the mezza platter, which is basically a board with two giant scoops of hummus and a few olives for pizazz.  They are crazy stingy with the pita bread.  They seriously give you enough hummus to feed a country, and then one slice of pita cut into four small triangles.  You are left with a gallon of hummus and nothing to eat it with.  The kicker is that they charge you 3 bucks to get another small dish of pita bread so you can continue to eat your bland hummus.  On the bright side, we found a weird plastic nozzle in the middle of our hummus, so that got comped.  (If you consider finding a weird plastic thing in your food a bright side, that is)  The Gouda mac n' cheese was OK.  The butternut squash enchiladas were... you guessed it... OK.  Neither were bad, but they weren't great either.  It didn't make much impact.    My stars are bumped up to three because the atmosphere is to die for.  We sat on the patio, surrounded by beautiful trees and herbs like rosemary and lavender wafting in the air.  We had a view of the canal and it was a beautiful day.  The lovely decor gives this place an edge, but the food itself was really just.... meh."}
{"text":"I am one for fresh and healthy food options when it comes to restaurants. The Herb Box definitely came through on those aspects. I came to this restaurant with my husband and a few friends, we were all first timers here. I ordered the Sweet Potato Avocado Baha bowl with the blackened shrimp added, which was both fresh and excellent in flavor. The reason for the 3 stars lies in the portion sizing. When our food finally came out I was honestly upset. I looked over to my husband and his friends who spent around $15 for a large plate of steak, fingerling potatoes, & eggs and was bothered that I was about to spend  about $20 for a bowl with food probably filling a third of the bowl. I finished my meal within 7 minutes and waited for the others to get through their meals. Mind you I am not a large eater. I am 5'7\" & 119 pounds but even I was left hungry after my meal. Long story short, if you come here ask your server about the meal sizings before you order."}
{"text":"They have some creative vegan options on the menu, but even the vegan nosh board, which combines all of the meal options, isn't filling. The décor is modern and comfortable (including the bathrooms), but needs some love or an update. The service is good 90% of the time.  They also have live, relaxing music.  The sangria was good (and they kindly subbed soda for sprite in the recipe).  During my last visit I ordered the Vegan Nosh Board - I think it used to be enough food for two people, but now (maybe because they made it the token gluten-free/vegan menu option) it's a small amount of food.  Asparagus and peppers cooked crispy in heavy oil, kale cooked crispy in heavy oil, hummus with artichoke heart, and a small sweet potato cake with corn and pomegranate topping. It was all good, but could have used less oil (the veggies tasted like they were fried in it). Extra star for the word \"vegan\" on the menu so that I didn't have to ask about dairy/egg.  Pricier than average, but normal for Scottsdale.  They didn't have any creative vegan dessert options. Our server said that they weren't very popular when they had them (let me guess...token gluten-free/vegan option? Yuck.)."}
{"text":"I have lived here for over a year and haven't eaten at the Herb Box until last night. Didn't realize what I've been missing out on! This place was amazing! Ashton our server was awesome and gave us excellent recommendations (ahem Thai Ribs...) Not only was the service great the whole ambiance topped it off. The Art Festival and Live Music. Love it."}
{"text":"Appetizers and dinner for 4. Only 1 person liked their food (the burger). Not sure why the reviews were so high but we will not be giving it a second chance. However, our waitress and hostess were very nice."}
{"text":"Great ambiance and location.  The sweet potato Baja bowl fit the style of food sought but the execution was inadequate.  The added blackened shrimp was way too salty, just one small piece of plantain was in the bowl, and the sweet potatoes and avocado were a bit too raw.  The short rib enchiladas were very tasty but there was too much white space on the plate for the price."}
{"text":"It's Saturday, it's rainy day... and all I want to to do... is eat. My Dad, boyfriend and I decide to try the new Herb Box location in DC Ranch, even though we've been to the original locations hundreds of times.   Upon first walking in, I loved the intimate setting and decor. I will affectionately call this the \"Arcadia Farms of North Scottsdale\" because of the ladies-lunch like atmosphere. Lucky for the two men that I'm with, we spotted about 3 other guys over time!   We ordered the Cilantro-Lime Crab Dip with Plantain Chips. At first, I was startled that the dip was cold, but really got into the bold flavors by the second or third chip. I would have eaten more, but my Dad proceeded to dump half the bowl on his plate and hoover it down! It must have been good!   Entrees included the Flatbread with heirloom tomato's, goat cheese and roasted corn, Butternut Squash Enchiladas with a tomatillo salsa, and a boring Tuna Sandwich.   I loved the flat bread! It was crispy, and the corn was perfectly sweet to balance out the goat cheese. The enchilada's were very different, light and fresh tasting.   The tuna sandwich was boring (Go to Taylor's Cafe for the best Tuna!!) but like Gabi said... the sweet potato chips are amazing and I had to beg the server to take them away from me so I would stop eating!   Overall, I really liked this place for a weekend lunch joint! The way I see it, go big or go home.. stuff your face at a place like this maybe once a month, because the price is not something you want to spend every day. But then again... maybe most people don't order like we do :)"}
{"text":"This place was excellent! It's something unique, and definitely nailed the way to please everyone's palette. There were choices for the picky vegans to the pork lovers. Unique pairing of flavors to leave your tongue desiring more. There was freshness and a lack of guilt when I left. Will definitely visit next time I'm in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Packed flavor with every bite! So surprisingly delicious and fun. Bowls easily were made vegan and our waiter was accommodating and awesome, too. Would definitely come back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Damn you Scottsdale for taking all the best restaurants away from the rest of the valley!! This is yet another one of Scotty's finest: the freshest ingredients with the awesomest service.  After reading some funtastic reviews from my main man Yelp, swung by here a little after the lunch rush on fine Tuesday afternoon. Had the smoked turkey on ciabatta, rosemary steak ciabatta, with the yummus/tzaziki/olives appetizer. WARNING do not get an appetizer unless you are hungry as a hippo!! The sandwiches and wraps come with these deelicious sweet potato chipperoos, both of which will fill you up like a cactus on a rainy day.   The tab came up to ~$35, an eency bit steep for me for lunch as I probably could have had the same quality of food/service at the Jungle (of Pita, that is), but nonetheless just as excellent and well worth another visit the next time I stop by Scott's and Dale's hood!"}
{"text":"Not pleased with them at all! I ordered two Steak salads to go and both of them  were missing the steak glaze and also the blue cheese! I basically got lettuce and dried up steak for $20. I called them to let them know that my salads were both missing key ingredients and the guy that took my call said \"oh I'm sorry\" \"would you like my manager to call you back?\" So with a response like that, he clearly has no sense of customer service! I'd also like to mention that this was a salad my friend was raving about that I had to try...so I picked one up for her and what a disappointment! Moving forward a few days later...my friend decided to order enchiladas from here and her salad was missing the dressing! Ok so what's going on in their kitchen?!? This shouldn't be happening!"}
{"text":"Great place for brunch, especially during the nicer months!  I have been here twice.  The first time I was unimpressed with the service (similar to some other reviewers) but the second time changed my mind.    I had mango mimosas both times (which I didn't see on the menu, but apparently they are $5 on Sundays) and they were delicious!  The first time I had the Bourbon-Ginger Peach Brioche French Toast.  Ohhhh my gosh was that good.  Definitely very sweet, as some other reviewers have said, but if you like sweet breakfast items you would like these.  My friend had the red velvet pancakes and said they were really good but also very very rich.    The second time I had the smoked salmon hash and it was absolutely delicious.  Definitely a change from the french toast...savory and delicious.  I will have a hard time departing from either of those the next time I go, and an even harder time deciding between the two.  My husband had the Kobe Burger and he loved it, and he is super picky about burgers.  The house made sweet potato chips were really good too.  I will definitely bring visitors here - the location is nice (I love DC Ranch) and the food was excellent."}
{"text":"Such a pleasant experience I must say. I had brunch at this charming eatery while visiting Scottsdale over the weekend. It is located on the banks of the Arizona Canal offering fantastic menu with amazing selection for meat lovers as well as Veggie lovers.  I loved the interior decoration which remind me of a relaxing beach cottage.   Our server was fantastic and very passionate and knowledgeable with the menu.   The food was yummy and flavorful we ordered the following options:   Urban market steak salad which was so good. Steak was done medium just as requested served with watercress, avocado, sweet red pepper, sugared pecans, bacon, sweet dried corn and house blue cheese vinaigrette.   MY favorite: Serrano Garlic shrimp salad which was mouth watering and perfect amount of spice (not over powering) with Serrano chili, you can request the sauce to be on the side if you are afraid of spice. Shrimp were served over avocado toasts and wild arugula, crisp fennel, pancetta and lemon honey vinaigrette.   We also had the breakfast steak and eggs, Stead was done to perfection and was served with potatoes.   I will return when I am back in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch, haven't had their dinner.  Great outdoor patio, bartender super friendly.  A little bit of everything in the menu.  We tried the fried edamame and guacamole toast appetizers both were great.   Chicken wrap with solid as well. But the star of this menu is the sugared salmon.  It's outstanding and not a dish you're going to get most anywhere else I highly recommend it.  See the pic"}
{"text":"Okay, worst service I have experienced in a while. Bartender was rude... we were a group of 20-30 year olds and he treated us like we were a pain in the ass and made obnoxious comments suggesting we were poor and wouldn't be able to afford our choices.... like WTF, do your job and get over the fact we didn't order a soda and you actually have to do something.   Once we were sat, (after being told by the hostess that we wouldn't be able to sit outside on the patio for over an hour.. which remained empty for the entire hour we were there) we sat down and still hadn't received our drinks from the bartender.... we probably sat there for 10 minutes waiting for any member of staff to acknowledge us and then had to go and grab ourselves glasses of the service table. 30 minutes later he takes our food order... food came in a relatively prompt fashion, but was mediocre. I love the effort, the menu is enticing and healthy but was no way wow, or mouth watering. Maybe try dinner.   To sum this experience up.... disappointing. There are MUCH better places to eat in the Scottsdale area."}
{"text":"Me and the manfriend came to Scottsdale to visit a friend.  We all came here for Sunday brunch.  Long story short: LOVED IT.     The casual chic decor was lovely, causal chic with a sophisticated and nautical flair. The drinks were tasty (and strong), after 1 mimosa I was gooooood. And the food: WOW, let's just say I wish The Herb Box would open up out here in Los Angeles!  I ordered the crispy falafel balls as an appetizer and the urban market salad as my entree.  Both were delicious.  Not sure when I'll be going back to Scottsdale, but eating here will be on my to-do list."}
{"text":"Ate here twice while on vacation. It's been a really long time since I gave a 5-star rating. I can't say enough good things, but I will say this - excellent food, staff, value. Very well thought out, and unique too! I'm very pleased to have found this place."}
{"text":"The Herb Box is a great place to go for food in Old Town. I usually go in the market for a sandwich during lunch, but have also had dinner there too. The food is consistently very good and the employees are friendly. It is a bit on the pricey side for sandwiches and a la carte items, but I have not been let down there yet!"}
{"text":"This is THE place to go if you're a celiac! Everything on the menu is labeled - and a big portion of the menu is actually gluten free! The servers are friendly and knowledgeable, and the food - well, the food is amazing. However, it's VERY pricey - especially with all of those amazing cocktails (muddled strawberrys, c'mon!). I have only dined here for dinner, but I loved every bite of it. I would choose to go here for ANY special occasion. They even brought out a free birthday GF dessert! They're great, go here as soon as you can!"}
{"text":"The Herb Box is now officially my favorite place for brunch/lunch.  The service is great, everyone from the hostess to the waiter to the busser who filled my water was friendly and helpful.  The food is fresh and delicious.  I had the Market Street BLT which has egg, prosciutto, arugala, tomato and ricotta on brioche.  It was amazing!  My friend ordered the Cinnamon Buckwheat pancakes with honey butter and they were really good too.  Can't wait to come back and try something else!"}
{"text":"I want to love this restaurant.  It is in a great location.  The decor and atmosphere are excellent.  The food was even mostly impressive (two out of our four meals were stellar; one was awful; the other was passable).  There are so few inventive, original restaurants with vegetarian/vegan options, so please fix your problems and thrive!  The service was absolutely lousy.  I think we got the same male waiter listed by another reviewer.  He would disappear for 15 minute blocks of time.  It took him multiple promptings to refill a wine glass (this is a huge missed revenue opportunity for both the server and restaurant).  I'm sure it was not all his fault.  The food took forever to come out and there where few people in the restaurant.  I wonder if the kitchen was struggling.  It took 20 minutes for a cheese plate!    The owner came out at one point but didn't seem to notice or care that one of us had not touched his \"medium\" burger that was raw.  She didn't ask if everything was okay or question the uneaten food.  Good restaurants notice these things and ask why.  Otherwise you can guarantee you've got a table that will not return.    I will come back and try again.  I hope these problems are resolved and I can simply enjoy what should be an exemplary restaurant."}
{"text":"Drew, our server,  was simply outstanding. He recommended dishes I would never consider trying. They were all absolutely amazing even the desert. He is truly one-of-a-kind. Avocado love Yum!"}
{"text":"Dined here on Thursday evening. It was very loud due to a band playing out front. We had the falafel as an appetizer, which was average, & not too flavorful. CAPICOLA HAM & HERB TOMATO FLATBREAD & the PEAR and GORGONZOLA FLATBREAD. Those were simple and exciting to the taste buds. For dessert, we  had the Expresso chocolate martini. It was yummy!"}
{"text":"Now that the previously reviewed Scottsdale/Shea location is closed, I'm exuberant that the Southbridge/Old Town Scottsdale location is here, as it's much closer to me.  Which I'm trying to take advantage as often as possible.  It's fantastic that I can go somewhere with great vegetarian options and carnivore options, a healthy and fresh focus, and with the stellar ambiance the patio offers.  I've never been disappointed with anything I've ordered, and always look forward to going again.  And while it may be a weird quirk of mine, but I truly love when I have options for iced tea! Last time I was there, our server rattled off about 5, and it made me giddy on the inside.  A few visits ago was dinner with girlfriends, to which Amy D. insisted we each go home with a \"crack pie\", and per the check-in tips on FourSquare from both her and Noelle K., it's a must.  I'm not too proud to say I ate 3/4 of it at home that night, and the rest in the morning for breakfast.  And yes, I did consider stopping there on the way home that next day for more. What? It's CRACK PIE!!!"}
{"text":"Oh Herb Box, how I love thee. Your patio is fantastic, your inside is cute and you have the coolest bathrooms in all of Old Town. (Really, go see the awesome ladies room)  I frequent this place often and it's my go to lunch spot for out of town visitors.  And right now I have visitors every flipping weekend it seems, so I'm always here.    I've never had dinner there, just brunch and lunch and I love both.  For apps, my go choices:  falafel bites, Avacado love, white bean chicken chili (although you can eat this as a meal).    Fav lunch options:  any of the wraps but especially the chicken arugala  or the turkey avocado.  I absolutely love the flatbreads as well.  The brussel sprout flatbread sounds weird, but it works. I mean, it has pancetta on it.  Yum. I also love the black bean chicken and goat cheese.    Recently I had a high maintenance friend in town who suddenly can't eat gluten (bandwagon person) and HB has gluten free options. So there's that as well.    Happy Hours are offered and the specialty drinks are delicious."}
{"text":"Amazingly fresh and flavorful food. Everything on menu is perfect. Wait staff extremely friendly. Well priced. Cool mid century modern atmosphere. One of my new favorite places!"}
{"text":"Was great the first time, but we went on Mothers Day 2014 and the service and the food was not up top par. The more we asked for the correct order seems as they intentionally made it worse."}
{"text":"I don't usually write too many Yelp reviews but the Herb Box is one of my favorite dining spots in the valley.  Usually dine here for lunch and get the Chicken Avocado Chop Salad.  The simplicity of the salad with the flavorful dressing is a perfect choice for lunch if you're not into taking naps at the office but yet want to feel full.    Our server Kristy was a delight, overall great attitude and had an awesome recommendation for a light glass of white wine to pair with the meal.  She was also quick and efficient with bringing our food and checking on us without making us feel rushed.  Food, ambiance and great service make this place a 5 star establishment in my opinion."}
{"text":"We ate at The Herb Box after walking by and noticing the cute patio by the canal.  The experience was wonderful!  We had an attentive waiter, Howie, who dealt with my food allergies.  We started out with a wonderful cocktail with meyer lemons.  We had the beet salad and the roast grapes bruschetta for small plates.  A great start followed by the sublime roasted chicken with tomato/gorgonzola butter, green bean/fingerling potato salad and roasted brussels sprouts.  We finished with beetroot chocolate cake. Yumm!  Just writing it makes me want to eat it all over again."}
{"text":"So far so good. Been here 3 times and always happy. Good food and good service. I'm not a huge sweet person but their bakery things all sound great.  Came with 2 friends and we all shared the following: peach French toast, chiliquiles, sweet potatoe/butternut enchiladas, crab dip and the crack pie. All were good. The French toast may be good to share as it got to be a little too much if you only had that. The bacon was really crispy which I loved. Crab dip was very good. Not a thick as we expected though. My friend thought it would make a good salad dressing. Tastes like the Trader Joes cilantro dressing. The crack pie was also yummy. You gotta eat that one there as they warm it up and it just melts. Very good but very sweet.  Now that it's summer, you might have to wait a little since not as many people want to be outside so that's limiting but if you're willing to be outside, you could sit pretty quickly."}
{"text":"Updated.  Talk about going from hero to zero.   I came by to visit and we were a few minutes before closing time. Which means we should have been able to do business at this location because it was within normal store hours. I called the number on the door and asked to speak to a manager who seemed extremely bothered by my call and was not very pleasant to deal with. I explained I I rush from the other side of town in order to get there before they closed and someone had closed the market early. I did not expect anything for it, but I did want to make the manager aware of it. His attitude was so disturbing that I will not return and I was made to feel that this business is very inconsistent.  Feel free to read my glowing review from a previous visit. Things have obviously changed here.  Past review.   We planned on having dinner at the restaurant however due to the event happening that closed off all the entrances we found it easier to just order from the little downstairs counter.  Firstly, the blonde (sorry I didn't get her name) behind the counter was awesome. Just to show you that great customer service can make up some imperfections. She knew the menu, was happy to accommodate us on her little patio seats, recommended some awesome items for a gluten free diet and was extremely genuine and cordial.  That said, we opted for the oatmeal cream filled cookie while we waited for takeout. It was awesome and highly recommended. Our takeout consisted of the plantain appetizer and two different enchilada entrees. The beef was much better than the chicken.  There was no to go silverware, the enchilada containers leaked a bit and did not seem to seal correctly (lost a star on that).  I would come back. This time I will come earlier and just order a panini from the nice lady downstairs. :)"}
{"text":"Wed-Sat, sit at the bar and ask for bartender JOY. She's a GAS! Great spot for a late-afternoon glass of wine with an appetizer. Mostly poor execution from kitchen, excellent service.  --hummus appetizer with sample of olives is great choice --crispy plantains with pepper are tasty and fun, crab dipping sauce, not enough crab --tuna salad with arugula, uninteresting --side salad for ciabatta \"sandwich\" typical Dole bag mix (first visit) was WILTED and nasty. Shame! --chicken salad with dried tomatoes and goat cheese; way too much cheese  Now, to Joy. She's a keeper. First visit, we struggled with the proper preparation of a Sapphire martini, but it was primarily the fault of our server's communication skills. Working with machine-made ice (you know, the stuff with all the flecks and shards that water down a proper martini), she primed the ice with a squeeze of lemon, drained, then prepped the glass with vermouth, in and out, then pour the STIRRED Sapphire in, drop twist! Congrats, my lady.  If you can get past the chick-chosen wallpaper (wrong) and perfect-sphere fake tabletop plants from restoration, the different-height tables mix up the room just right and make it feels shabby chic without the white.  Say hi to Joy. =)"}
{"text":"Snooty hostess with short dark hair put a party of six at a 4 top, when a large table stayed empty nearby and we were packed in like sardines. Did not like the attitude of the staff, it's not warm and welcoming, but very snobbish like they are doing you a favor. It used to be a good place to go but I would not go back after our last visit as the nice atmosphere of the restaurant is eclipsed by the elitist vibe of the  hostess and the staff."}
{"text":"I'd keep going back just for the sweet potato chips and the patio dining.  It's a perfect place for lunch.  Two can share many of the menu items.  We loved the pear and gorgonzola flatbread.  The service and the orange blossom iced tea helped provide an upbeat atmosphere.    I'm eager to try some of the other flat breads, as well as the smoked trout beignets, the white bean chili and some of the salads.  Don't pass this up if you are in downtown Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I have a confession to make. When I found out that I'd be visiting Scottsdale for work, I secretly thought that the places where we'd be eating and drinking for the week wouldn't hold a candle to my favorite spots in other cities I've visited, like San Francisco, LA, Chicago or NYC. Well, I was wrong and I will happily eat my slice of humble pie, especially if it's from The Herb Box.   The first thing I noticed about the spot was how open and stylish the space was. I loved the old timey bicycle decorating the back wall, I loved the funky upholstery, I loved the classy bathrooms even.   My preconceived notions continued to break down as I perused the menu. For lunch, the offered row after row of amazing options, from fresh made sweet potato chips to a lunch plat du fromage to a whole array of salads and sandwiches. I went with the coconut shrimp salad and when it came out I practically dove head first into the bowl, devouring the ridiculously fresh veiggies and freshly fried shrimp. I think at one point I cried out, \"It feels like a garden is blooming in my mouth!!\" The meal was complete with a nibble of some of those famous sweet potato chips and a gulp of their mango lemonade.   Then why not five stars, you ask? Well, the service was slow. Very slow. They warned us that it might be as we had a large party, but 40 minutes for your dishes to come out just doesn't cut it, I'm sorry. When we asked about the progress our waiter said that it was due to all of our special requests, \"like asking for steak on your salad.\" This confused me, as getting steak on your salad was an option listed on the menu, so it didn't seem so special to me.   Nevertheless, our waiter was a nice guy and I didn't begrudge him too much, or the ktichen staff, especially when the chef/owner checked in on us a couple of times to see how we were doing. Unfortunately for the first time we didn't have much to tell her as we had yet to receive any food.   I think they may have felt bad because they sent out an amazing array of desserts. Everyone loved the cream cheese frosting on the red velvet cupcake but I found the cake very dry and tough. People also loved their dessert which was basically a giant Reese's peanut butter cup. We took their orange cream cupcake to our next destination as a gift and the recipient was one happy lady.   So, while in good conscience I can't give a place five stars when it takes forever for lunch, everyone else had received their food, and we were late to our next appointment because of it, but everything else was on par so I'm going to hope that it was a one-time fluke and give them the props that they deserve!"}
{"text":"The daily special was an excellent option for a vegetarian like me, and an ok value for the downtown Scottsdale area. I got a (smallish) grilled cheese/caramelized onion/apple sandwich, cup of potato leek soup, and side salad for $15, but more to the point, it was all great. We sat on the very nice patio and they didn't give us any attitude for being all scruffy and probably a bit smelly post-Camelback Mt. hike. Don't miss the absurdly fancy bathroom. (Warning about the patio - the table next to us was being dive-bombed by aggro birds. Apparently it has something to do with ordering Diet Coke and saccharin?) My husband said his grilled chicken sandwich was great too, and his crispy potatoes were AWESOME. VERY close to five stars overall. I guess I'm holding back on that 5th star because service was a bit slow (a lot of \"I'll be right back with that\"... and 10 minutes go by), but we were at the end of the lunch rush and luckily not in a hurry. Very pleasant meal and a highlight of our trip to AZ."}
{"text":"Went for a very nice midweek lunch.  The location can't be beat...  right on the waterfront in Old Town Scottsdale.  You can sit outside on the patio and enjoy a water view.    We started with a Bloody Mary (pretty good) and a specialty cocktail (can't remember which one and their online menu isn't current).  For lunch we got the Korean fried cauliflower, the mac n cheese and the pear and Gorgonzola flat-bread.   Everything was good - especially the smoked Gouda mac n cheese, which is delicious...  with a nice crisped top and tons of cheesy goodness.  My pear and Gorgonzola flat-bread was also a highlight, with a nice crisp crust.    The menu is interesting and just borders on the verge of being a little too vegan/healthy for me.  Non health nuts will find some things to eat, but your choices are a little limited.    Service was friendly and efficient.  Bathrooms are over designed (you'll get soaked attempting to use their modern concept sink - which is pretty but completely nonfunctional) and too small and dark.    I would recommend if you're visiting Old Town Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Food was defiantly three stars both my boys friends eggs in his tacos and my over easy eggs were cold but the forth star is for the service alone they will go above and beyond to make sure you are comfortable. Also this restaurant is beautiful! I will be back just not for the eggs"}
{"text":"Located in downtown Old Scottsdale, this restaurant is really nice. It's a great date night spot with a rustic romantic feel. We were meeting an old friend from HS and it was Valentine's Day so we made reservations. Parking was not an issue because we opted for valet parking. You could park and walk, but honestly it was not expensive to use their valet service. The Herb Box is gluten free and vegan friendly.  We sat outside at a patio table ~ which was great...except for the music. There was a speaker located at the base of a tree across from our table. In the middle of our conversation, this crazy music starts playing. But that wasn't the \"crazy\" part. While that was playing, the restaurant also had a guitarist playing outside ~ at the same time! Talk about craz-y!! It was driving us nuts! Several times I ask our waiter to put one or the other on ~ not both! It was absolutely nutty.  Now to the food...it took FOREVER to get our food! Our waiter kept apologizing profusely for the delay. Had we not enjoyed the company we would have certainly walked out. I ordered the Urban Market Steak Salad ~ It looked amazing when it (finally) came to the table. Mixed greens, arugula, grilled beef tenderloin, ancho-bourbon demi, watercress, avocado, sweet red pepper, sugared pecans, sweet dried corn, gorgonzola cheese ~ and grit. Gross! I also requested no bacon on my salad. It came with bacon. Reluctantly, I asked our waiter to please bring me another salad without the grit and bacon. When it came it was missing a few more of the ingredients ~ no avocado or demi. It still had pieces of bacon but the grit was minimal. Sigh. I also ordered the Citrus Quinoa Salad. Certainly nothing to write about this dish :( The hubster ordered the Kobe Burger. Surprise! When you order a burger for dinner it comes without the bun. Say what?  One would have thought a restaurant like The Herb Box would be prepared for a full house. It was definitely a Valentine's epic fail."}
{"text":"Amazing place, food is awesome, atmosphere is great!  I loved the kobe burger, and drinks on Sundays are priced great!  Highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"I just got to town for vacation and walked to the Fashion Square area. I was headed to a different restaurant, and passed this place on my way. There were tons of people outside enjoying the lunchtime gorgeous weather, and all the plates looked amazing. I got to the other place and turned right around.  All of my expectations were surpassed! The service, friendly staff, delicious food, and beautiful outdoor, shady ambiance was amazing!  I had the market sunflower salad (but switched to the lemon-honey vinaigrette) and it was sooooo good! Can I please have dried strawberries every day???   If I lived here or would be in the area longer, this place would definitely be a regular spot for me!"}
{"text":"We tried to get into the Herb Box two weeks ago but the wait for a table was about an hour. This time we got smart and made reservations. It was worth the wait! Started off with a legit Mango Mimosa. Service was excellent, they made an exception and gave me one breakfast taco as a side to the Simple Breakfast with extra bacon. Seriously, can't turn down a chance to sample a breakfast taco.   The ambiance is perfect for Sunday brunch, we sat outside beneath big shade trees and right next to the river (or canal depending on your definition).  Bottom line: best brunch we have had in quite some time."}
{"text":"Amazing dessert selection, wish they had more menu options, but overall great little spot for lunch or brunch.  Love their Gouda macaroni and cheese with breadcrumbs!"}
{"text":"Great little catering place that also has a small restaurant. Worth the trip and priced fairly!! Good Time"}
{"text":"I have been here twice, once last August (2015) and recently about two weeks ago. The first time I was really impressed. The vegetable sampler platter had amazing and delicious dishes, the cocktails were tasty and strong, and my steak was one of the best I could remember. The service was good too. That's why I chose it to go to on my birthday earlier this month (May 2016)  I really wish I had gone somewhere else. I don't eat out that often, so the price of this meal was a serious splurge for me. We shared two of the vegetable dishes, one was the kale pakoras I'd so enjoyed last August, and one was the brussel sprout chips, and we also got the crab dip with plantain chips. Bonus was that they were there during happy hour, and were inexpensive and the platters were large. Unfortunately, they were so heavy and salty that we could barely eat any of them. I took the rest home, not wanting to waste it, but dumped it on the compost the next day. I understand that pakoras are deep fried, but really, they were shiny with oil, pooled in oil, not like the light-as-a-cloud vegetable puffs I remembered. And so, so salty. You know when you have to stop eating before you've had enough to eat because your body can't handle the salt anymore? Yeah, exactly like that.   Our entrees were the  braised rib and the steak. The steak was pretty good, but not spectacular. We enjoyed it, but it was no better than what an average-talented cook could make at home. The ribs were again, extremely heavy and oily. They'd cut the cabbage thin and grilled it, a novelty as I've never seen cabbage cooked that way. Don't cook cabbage that way. I took a bite and spit it out. It was (you may be detecting a theme here) greasy and heavy.   The one saving grace was the creme brulee, which was passion fruit flavored. Two of the three of us found it delightfully tart and fruity, with a nice sugar crust.   The service was adequate, but nothing spectacular, especially considering there were only two or three tables in the whole place.   I'd been super excited about going out to a nice restaurant on my birthday, but my experience really disappointed me. I'd hoped that for about half of my weekly grocery bill, three light eaters could have an expertly  made delicious meal. Instead we got heavy, oily, salty, and mediocre (except for the dessert.)  I don't know if the chef changed, or if maybe you should just never ever come here on a Monday. Honestly, the whole experience made me a little sad. I tried to splurge on a special treat, and ended up wishing I'd just stayed home and cooked my own food."}
{"text":"Ah. Wanted to love this place but my meal was really horrible.  Rubbery roasted chicken breast :(. The two stars are for the market, which is actually great and fairly priced. The herb box restaurant was very slow on service (even though it wasn't busy...telling tale for 7pm on a Friday) and ridiculously over priced. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Great patio and nice healthy menu, host was accommodating and we had a nice seat on the pAtio.  Service was slow and unfriendly! I had to go up to the host to ask if our waitress was still working as we had not seen her in 15 minutes.  When she did return she was cold and put out.  I would not rush back to spend my money there when there are so many other amazing places right across the street!"}
{"text":"I love The Herb Box.  I\"ve been to both locations and the food is just terrific!    I brought my co-workers here before heading to a meeting.  They could not thank me enough about this place!   We did not encounter some of the slow service with other Yelp reviews but it was a Tuesday.  Lots of customers but the flow was manageable."}
{"text":"Very good accident Frank Lloyd Wrights home  this was a drive by accident. Really tasted great"}
{"text":"Enjoyed this late lunch. Art fair nearby so very busy today. White bean chicken chile soup good. My cup was very small Frank's bowl was very large for two dollar difference. Pear, Gorgonzola flatbread good but we would have preferred crust a bit crisper. We would go there again."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite happy hour spots... Nice seating outside across from the river... Great happy hour menu.. the Thai ribs are a must & the pear gorgonzola cheese pizza is also a winner.. sum of their drink special can be a hit or miss but the skinny margarita was delicious... At times service can be slow but the food is worth the wait"}
{"text":"july 8, 2012  For my birthday brunch, I ordered four menu items to share amongst everyone, which included the red velvet pancakes (but of course!), the Herb Tomato, goat cheese, and chive omelet, the Market BLT (I've tried it before, and it was fantastic!), and a new addition to the menu, one I'd wanted to try for two years now, but I keep missing the opportunity-- the Bourbon-ginger peach brioche French toast!  I also ordered two mango mimosas for my cousin and me (Mom and aunt did not want any)...  What more can I say about the red velvet pancakes that I haven't said before? http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0gXYLVPNWz0WT8wXQVpS0g?select=25P_k0Ot6qR9aV5IYzGTVQ#25P_k0Ot6qR9aV5IYzGTVQ  Just order them when you go, and thank me later.  I skipped on the omelet this time http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0gXYLVPNWz0WT8wXQVpS0g?select=YO8Ft30ml8XwNW4K2Drq3Q#YO8Ft30ml8XwNW4K2Drq3Q, since I had only one thing on my mind, and it was the French toast... OMG! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0gXYLVPNWz0WT8wXQVpS0g?select=pC5n1Ejy5dpyvZQlY1uTBQ#pC5n1Ejy5dpyvZQlY1uTBQ  This is how French toast should be prepared-- crispy, yet not greasy, on the outside and tender, not fluffy, on the inside.  The ratio of custard batter to bread was spot-on.  Nothin'  soggy 'bout it.  Oh, and the bourbon-ginger peach compote that was the crux of the entree?  Superb!  Yeah, I had to ask for another pot of this.  Hey, I'll take a couple of jars home, if you got some to sell!  I seriously hope I never have to choose between the red velvet pancakes and the French toast, because I wouldn't, COULDN'T begin to contemplate.  The only disappointment during the whole meal was the Street Market BLT. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0gXYLVPNWz0WT8wXQVpS0g?select=L03fNbFT9uWaiI69ELoUFw#L03fNbFT9uWaiI69ELoUFw  While the ingredients- pancetta, wild arugula, tomato, ricotta, and a fried egg (mmm... there's something about arugula and fried egg together...) tasted fantastic, the bread was over-charred, and it just almost ruined the dish.  I just peeled the bread back and ate the goodness in between.  Hmm... yeah.  'Tis best not to go there.  Mango mimosas for $5 a pop?  I see many more Sundays off from work in my future!  p.s.  Thank you Shad, and THB, for my glorious red velvet birthday cupcake! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0gXYLVPNWz0WT8wXQVpS0g?select=dk-G0E6bgC4JoZOQBPaqfQ#dk-G0E6bgC4JoZOQBPaqfQ  Three of us kept going back to the plate for more, and there were still leftovers... You were so right-- the cream cheese frosting was spectacular!"}
{"text":"6/9/13  My first visit at this Herb Box location- didn't know it was so much closer to where I live than that one at Southbridge!  Decided to sit outside since it was so noisy indoors** and especially when the misters were on full blast outside.  [The misters were both a blessing and a curse- while they did cool the area, the water did have a certain odor to them (a manager at another resto previously warned me not to park my car close to their misters, since the water contained erosive compounds), and I didn't want whatever was added to the water to contaminate my food and drinks.)  Ordered water and green tea with blackberry and jasmine essences http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-herb-box-scottsdale-6?select=ACjM4QrTvrI6Og5q-cQNSg#ACjM4QrTvrI6Og5q-cQNSg and the Blackened salmon BLT.   The unsweetened tea was clean-tasting and refreshing, and was a welcome palate cleanser after I had my fill of the terrific salmon BLT, which came with two juicy filets of wild-caught salmon, wild arugula, tomato, smoked applewood bacon, and red pepper aioli on toasted ciabatta, plus a side of house-made sweet potato chips. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-herb-box-scottsdale-6?select=MQz07Ic5tPQfAjnVVqnurg#MQz07Ic5tPQfAjnVVqnurg  It took a lot of willpower not to eat more than half of the sandwich (I actually sliced a tiny portion off of the second-half- tsk, tsk!), but in hindsight, a half-portion plus some SPC satisfied until late happy hour/early dinner.  Afterwards, I asked my server if it would be safe to leave my Kindle on the table while I go wash my hands, and she said yes.  When I went back outside to do a bit of reading, I noticed the umbrella over my table was removed and my boxed leftovers, beverages, and e-reader were on another table- what the - ?  Were they in such a rush to see me off?  I could understand the busser mistakenly thinking I'd forgotten the food, but seeing the e-reader would've clued him/her of the possibility that I was returning, so one would think that the items would still be on the original table when I returned, so why were they moved to another AND the umbrella taken away?  The other tables still had umbrellas overhead... Very strange.  I also realized that I didn't have time to read after glancing at my watch, and with bill on hand, I tried to pay at the register by the pastry case, since my server was busy taking care of other customers outside, but the bartender (whom I asked if I could get some assistance at the register) and manager (?), whom the bartender motioned to come over, became confused, until my server rushed indoors to ask me what was going on.  I said I didn't know it was so late, that I needed to make it to an appointment in Tempe in 20 minutes, so I was trying to find someone else to help me with the bill.  She said only she could take care of it, and that it needed to be done at the bar.  OK, whatever you need to do, I just had to get going!  (I started to wonder if they thought I was going to rush out without paying?!)  Besides these few glitches in service, I'd otherwise give four stars.  Maybe next visit will be better...  **It was lunchtime, but by no means packed with people, so I wondered why it was so noisy?"}
{"text":"Late lunch with my 12 yo daughter, Friday 2  pm. Place is deadish. Pretentious hostess. Server nice but forgets about us after serving drinks.   20 minutes later, no waitress. No food order.  Expletives (F-bombs) on the audio music systems. Stand up key hostess know. She's still too cool for school. Ask her to please change music and send server over. 5 mins still no server.   Leave a buck for the ice teas, walk out. Manager says thank you (clueless). I tell him about experience. He says thank you.   Sad because this was once a great place for lunch and desert. Never again."}
{"text":"The Herb Box has continued to wow from the time they were merely a small catering service way back when to today. The help is always friendly and attentive while the food is well above average.  The chicken pesto sandwich is a delight and is accompanied by a side of warmed sweet potato chips. A tropical iced tea and some chick in skin tight yoga pants sporting a camel toe bigger than an adult female rhino rounded out my lunch visit.   Ya gotta love DC Ranch Market street with its eccentric a-holes. Camel toe's kid was a major brat.   Bill was forty plus bucks with tip. I'm as full as a fat blue tick right now.  ."}
{"text":"I like this place! Not only was our waitress super nice, but its got a great, low-key atmosphere and really good food.   We went for the shared plates and the market short rib tacos and Shrimp in Smoked Jalapeno Rioja Butter are amazing. The latter is on the spicy side, so don't order it if you can't eat a jalapeno. It comes with dipping bread to go into the sauce and I didn't care how unhealthy it may have been. It was good.   The crab dip with fried bananas was good, and the fried green tomatillos were okay. Some were sliced a bit too thick for my liking. But that's not going to stop me. Next time I'm in Scottsdale, you can count on me visiting the Herb Box."}
{"text":"Love the food here. I've been to two of the locations, the one in North Scottsdale for lunch, and the one in Old Town Scottsdale for dinner.  Impressed with both.  The food is outstanding (especially the gouda macaroni and cheese!) and the servers are friendly.  The atmosphere for dinner at the location in Old Town is great.  My only complaint is that during our last meal, our server forgot about our appetizer, but was very apologetic and helpful nonetheless.  Sometimes you end up waiting a little longer than you'd want to get your food, but thats how it is at any restaurant, and once your food arrives, it is well worth it anyways.  Very impressed, and will be sure to come back soon!  Try: The open faced Kobe Burger (if available)         The Gouda Mac N Cheese!         The Ribs!          The Apple-slaw"}
{"text":"Cute place. I came here for lunch with a friend. The food is good there are a lot of healthy options and gf options. I would say the only downside is that it's kind of pricey. I have a grilled chicken and avocado salad and it was I believe $15-$17. I would go back but probably try something different."}
{"text":"Super cool spot for enjoying a lazy Scotsdale morning. Outdoor setting is the best! Lots of lovely items on the menu to enjoy. We have a \"salted caramel almond gluten free vegan cheese cake.\" It was amazing. Love this place and will come back next time in Scotsdale Arizona. A+  Staff was super nice, especially Macy:-)"}
{"text":"Delicious. Their Thai BBQ Ribs were phenomenal. Their smoke gouda mac n cheese was the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"The upstairs restaurant is super.  Delicious food.. and the coffee is STELLAR!  We have been going to the more casual downstairs dining area for a simple breakfast. They can get all the stuff on the upstairs menu... but casual seating outside. Great people watching. Fantastic staff."}
{"text":"I love the scenery at the Herb Box along the canal. It's really nice and relaxing.  I don't normally like plantains, but I liked the plantain crab dip. Salty and not sweet. I also loved the butternut squash enchiladas. The green chile sauce was spicy and delicious.  Only downside was that the service was really slow, and my friend and I were on lunch break, and it took over an hour and a half to get our food and check out."}
{"text":"As always, this place delivers on food quality and service;  Had a yummy short-rib enchilada and the server was very nice!  Only complaint is that the enchilada was tough on the bottom ..maybe overcooked?  Still, it was delicous and nicely presented with a side salad.  HB is still one of my favorite places to dine....interesting menu choices."}
{"text":"Nice little place for breakfast. Small menu but hits the spot. Nice touches. Avocado on egg platter with toast and tomatoes. Great friendly service and atmosphere was very relaxing."}
{"text":"This is a very cute place to grab lunch. Their food was delicious. A tad on the expensive side but delish! Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"YUM! I love this place! This restaurant is perfect for some fun with friends and scrumptious food. You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu, from my experience. My favorite section of the menu is the breakfast/brunch where there's lots of yummy items to choose from (also great for a super yummy lunch, too!) The breakfast burrito, is on point! They recently took it off the menu, but if you ask for it -- they'll probably make it ;) If you like spicy stuff, ask for some side peppers to give it a little kick!  And we always eat a side order of the breakfast potatoes, just make sure you are sharing because it's a heaping portion! (More than enough for 3 people).   Besides the food, there's a full bar as well. Anyone up for some Sunday brunch mimosas? They have all the flavors, too. Regular, mango, cranberry, you name it. There's sometimes a bit of a wait if you go during peak hours 10-11ish) but you can ask to sit at the bar and they'll serve you really fast. The bartenders there are on point, and have great recommendations. Thats actually how I discovered their SANGRIA  It's full of fruit and just a delight on a warm weekend brunch date with friends or family.  Some other hot items on the menu?! Smoke salmon hash (yowwww-on point!), RED VELVET PANCAKES, and another favorite of mine - breakfast tacos! OH and we recently tried the chilled cilantro crab dip for starters and OMG! Amazing.   Location is great, right in the center of DC ranch, North Scottsdale where you can't go wrong with restaurant and great ambiance :) Get a table in the sun on the patio and enjoy!"}
{"text":"This was one of the easiest 5 stars I've given. The place is simply amazing and they know what they are doing here in all ways!  The outdoor patio is terrific and the heaters for this WNYer were a bit too much, but the locals must enjoy them a lot!   Inside and out the place was clean - perfectly clean maybe not, but clean enough not to remove a star for it and some folks don't even care about that sort of thing!  Food choicers were fantastic and they had GF and Vegan and trust me - they were the best GF and Vegan things I've ever tasted - even if you aren't a Vegan and even if you can eat things with gluten - I'd recommend the chocolate peanut butter tart and YES right after you get done with the tart take a mint leaf and chew it - awesome flavor. There really is something for everyone at this place!  Service if that matters to you was also spot on - no issues at all and the staff is friendly and makes you feel like you are a king at home! Even the manager came and chatted with us - so a shout out to Eric here!  Parking not an issue - pricing was not out of the normal and I believe it was less expensive than what it could be - this food isn't thrown together - their chef is AMAZING AND all bakery items made there - not purchased elsewhere - this always makes me feel good about the place.  It is NOT a chain, but there are two locations!   I urge you to check this place out - it's a real gem to the area!"}
{"text":"Hubs & I were in town from Boston (me on business, him for golf) and I got a tip from a coworker to try this place. I am so glad we did because it was awesome. I got the lentil ricotta *meatballs* + lemony kale-basil pesto. It was delicious. Hubs got butternut squash corn enchiladas. They were out of this world. The location is fabulous, the food was amazing & not your same-old same-old. Very inventive, very creative & just downright great."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The salmon was the best salmon I have every had. The avocado toast was just as good. Matt, our server, provided these suggestions to us. He was fast, efficient and very knowledgeable about the menu. I will be returning soon and requesting Matt!"}
{"text":"I was very pleasantly surprised.  Top notch food.  VERY well constructed. Nice patio and a sophisticated modern bar and cuisine."}
{"text":"A great meal made from fresh ingredients that will leave you full and satisfied. We enjoyed a seat outside while eating our sandwiches. The service was pretty good. Definitely a nice place to enjoy lunch while soaking up some sun."}
{"text":"Everything is good! The roasted red pepper hummus is amazing! good place for a business lunch....patio seating during cooler weather is unbeatable.....  Try the specials, they aren't the leftovers from the day before...there's a lot of thought put into them....."}
{"text":"We ate here for Sunday brunch, lured by the idea of red velvet and cinnamon buckwheat pancakes.  We managed to find parking close by and headed over.  We saw a large sign that said \"Herb Box\" up some stairs, with an inviting door, so we ventured inside.  Upon entering, we were confused because we couldn't see a check in area.  Eventually, the hostess came by, gave us a dirty look, and said tersely \"You didn't enter the right way.  This is the back way\".  We were shown to a table after she bitchily asked us how many people we wanted a table for, but I was miffed that she was so annoyed at the fact we accidentally went in through the wrong entrance.  Looking at the sign when we left, there wasn't any indication that it was the back entrance, nor were there any instructions to enter through the front.  How were we supposed to know it wasn't the right way to enter?  Maybe they should put up a sign or some indication that this isn't the correct entrance (or lock the back door), wouldn't that clarify things a bit? (Or maybe the hostess shouldn't be so bitchy to customers?  Just a thought.)  Despite being treated rudely by the hostess, our server was very friendly.  The red velvet pancakes were moist, chocolatey, and covered with a mild tasting mascarpone cheese.  The Gran Marnier sauce was delicious, and I could definitely taste the liquor in it!  I tried some of the cinnamon buckwheat pancakes, which were also very good.  The pancakes were very filling and a good portion size; I could only finish half of them because I got full halfway through my meal.  In general, despite getting the cold shoulder initially, it was an enjoyable meal.  Since there are a plethora of breakfast places around this area though, I'd like to try some other restaurants here before maybe venturing to Herb Box again."}
{"text":"My wife loves this restaurant and the food. It has a chic, earthy atmosphere with lots of vegetarian choices (she's not vegetarian but likes the option). She's always meeting her friends for lunch here.  What \"I\" think is great about it is the full bar which you can eat at, and a comfortable patio that's perfect on a cool, sunny day. We like to dine in for dinner, then take the walk down market street to the wine bar...great date evening. Amazing short rib tacos, and jerk pork sliders. Service has always been good, even when busy.  Tried the kids here one Sunday morning for breakfast, but it wasn't a hit. Then again all they want is chocolate chip pancakes...oh well. I'll be back with the wife though."}
{"text":"The service is awful. We have a group of people dining here. And the server didn't care about the dining experience and only showed us smile when we signing the tip."}
{"text":"Really wanted to live this place. We had been keeping an eye on this testing and decided to try for family brunch last weekend. Table was good live music a nice touch. We started with the pastry board. Just ok. Pastry was coined well but was largely without flavor other than sugar. As a group we had the breakfast burrito an omelette and a bacon and eggs breakfast. Omelette was by far the best of the three. The burrito was scrambled eggs rolled up with a bean or two. Too many eggs and runny at that. Gastric distress was noted after consuming this. Over attentive over the the top service was confusing. Nothing really wrong with the place other than the after effects of the burrito but given the choices of brunch restos in our area lint wi not return."}
{"text":"Andy is an amazing waiter. For him alone, stop by. If that doesn't sell you, go with their honey fig Fizz cocktail -- perfectly balanced and an excellent summer drink. The other cocktails are also yummy and well mixed. The food ranges from good to awesome -- the fried chicken is a little dry and could be better seasoned, along with a yummy macque-choux side and a kale side that could be more tender. The thai spare ribs are a home run, delicately spicy and rich, with a fabulous gouda mac and a disappointingly bland jicama slaw.  The fried cauliflower app disappears far too quickly (the quinoa is a genius add).  The setting is comfortably upscale and quiet."}
{"text":"We really want to like the herb box, but too many brunches gone bad has me throwing in the towel.   Food is pretty good, but overpriced. And inconsistent. I expect more from a restaurant that presents itself as higher class.   Service is friendly, but bad. Overall very slow and the servers are aloof.  I would expect my server to check in on coffee and water refills without having to flag them down. The little things matter to me. Like bringing a bowl of oatmeal without a spoon, now twice in a row...  Like I said,  really want to like this place. Our dinner experience here has been better than brunches, but not THAT much better. I would hope they become more consistent and work on their service. Honestly that seems pretty basic, don't know why they aren't listening to other Yelp reviews.   I think they have lost me as a customer after having tried to give them the benefit of the doubt the last few times coming here."}
{"text":"Their brunch here is DELICIOUS! I didn't want to expect too much out of the red velvet pancakes, but they are really as good as people say they are. We also ate the brussel sprout & pancetta flatbread, and that was equally as delectable. With a mango lemonade, that was the perfect brunch meal for us. I wish I would have tried this place earlier than the last weekend before I moved! Really cute place and good service."}
{"text":"Came here as a first time guest while on vacation. Went for a late lunch so it wasn't too busy. I ordered a turkey sandwich and my friend ordered a turkey wrap, both were delicious! However, I ordered a side of mac n cheese and it was just blahhhhhhhhhh. Took 3 bites out of it and was NOT impressed. Our server came back over and we told him it didn't meet our expectations,  he then took it out of the way. Here's the problem when I received the bill the Mac n Cheese was still on there!  I understand if we ate the whole thing and then decided we didn't like it, but we couldn't even eat it. Piece of advice: if the guest doesn't enjoy the dish offer something else or don't charge. It's a shame because this place has potential, but I won't be returning.  Also, they don't have ranch!!"}
{"text":"Had the avocado love this morning for breakfast- on the menu as an appetizer but is multi-grain wheat toast covered in chunky avocado and a bed of greens, dressed with lemon vinegarette. If you're an avocado toast fan, you will really enjoy the taste, but I warn you- it is MESSY! Don't order if you're trying to impress the person you're with or if you're mildly self conscious of other people starring as you oddly get the food down. Three half pieces of toast served, enough to make a light meal for one or a good appetizer for 2-3. The coffee is local and great- and they serve it just as I prefer, with every sugar possibility and personal sized cream. My neighbor highly suggested the salmon hash, and I will be trying that my next go around. Love the atmosphere here! Great outdoor seating and 2 TVs at the inside bar."}
{"text":"I've been to the Herb Box a few times for lunch but this was the first time I've gone here for dinner. A friend of mine invited a group to come out for her husband's 40th B-day and it was a great experience. I look for both exceptional service and good food and this place met both criteria.  We had ordered wine for the dinner and the waiter noted they change their wine list on a regular basis. We had a bottle of the riesling, which was $35 and it was from the Mosel region in Germany, one of my favorite places, and literally, one of the best I've tried, delicious. I believe the bottle of red was a Merlot and it was also exceptional, super tasty. i also had, earlier at the bar, a glass of the Prosecco and it was perfect4 for the summer, light, sparkling, and a great way to start a meal and, because I'm a bit of a lush, I also tried a cocktail, some sort of mint julip made with rainwater vodka and cucumber juice, and loads of fresh mint. Even at $9 it was worth and the Prosecco I had on happy hour and it was only $5 - basically, the prices a re reasonable and well selected. A big shout out to Rico who was a great bartender and even laughed at my majorly lame Rico Suave joke.  Once at the table, the waiter was great. One of those people who keeps things on track and was helpful without coming to the table and asking how we liked the food every five minutes. My water glass was always full and the food was to the table in a timely manner, and the food, oh my god! I ordered the flash fried edemame with sea salt and have to say, good. Though they may want to look at the edemame with sea salt and truffle oil like they serve at the mint, it would go well here as well.  For dinner I had the vegan option, which is a number of vegetable dishes and they were all...amazing! The herb hummus came with cucumber slices and I loved the chickpea salad and the best part, the roasted beats with grapefruit, so amazingly good. I even tried some of a friends flank steak and it was quite tasty.   Oh, and they had a live blue grass band playing, which was wonderful. I ended up tipping them like $20 I liked them so much (and yes, that also meant I had a few drinks in me).  Bottom line though, one of the best dining experiences I've had in Scottsdale.  Only recommendation, expand the bar out, it feels rather small for the size of the place but I think they have the space they have so such is life. I rarely give out six starts so check this place out. I'm probably going to go back tomorrow and have brunch, which runs from 8 am to 11 am - looks like they have some great breakfast food and I can't wait to try it!"}
{"text":"Excellent new location in my neighborhood. Been a few times now for brunch and lunch.  Everything seems quite fresh.  Esp like the red velvet pancakes and French toast, and the steak salad.  Only negative is the limited bathrooms, which lead to long waits when busy."}
{"text":"This was so good! I honestly was afraid to drag my family here when we were in town for a wedding this weekend because of varying tastes, but so glad I was given the task of choosing! Child ordered the kids mac and cheese, which was surprisingly gourmet, and all the adults were happy she didn't finish it so we could share it. I opted for a vegan sweet potato bowl ($13) that I didn't shut up about for the whole day! I'm not a vegan, but it sounded so good and absolutely delivered on taste and satiated me. Husband got the BLT ($14) off of the breakfast menu and really enjoyed it, and was able to get sweet potato chips instead of fruit, no problem. My meat and potatoes father shocked all of us by ordering pumpkin soup (!) and pronouncing it delicious and surprisingly filling. Two things that missed the mark for me, but I won't let affect my review were the sangria and brussel sprout chips. The red sangria was a little underwhelming for me, and tasted mostly of marashino cherries. The brussels sprout chips were amazing but at $11, I probably won't order again just out of guilt. I also found the way they were served, on top of the dip, rather than alongside, it sort of strange. I don't think we will find ourselves in Scottsdale Arizona again, but if we did, I would race back to The Herb Box in a second!"}
{"text":"I ordered the hamburger it was awesome and the potato fries that they do were so good it was really quick didn't have to wait very long for the order and the atmosphere is really nice."}
{"text":"Just had lunch at the old Scottsdale location.  We had skinny margaritas, short rib tacos and the Serrano shrimp Salad.  The food was outstanding and the service was Very good.   Highly recommend This spot for lunch.  We will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"After eating here a few times, we've been able to get a good sense of the menu and it is quite tasty. The service is spectacular with servers who are both knowledgeable and attentive, but not pushy. Their patio is also dog friendly."}
{"text":"My blt was good I added some salt and hot sauce. My son loved his red velvet pancakes and bacon. My wife had chile verde said it was ok. The coffee tasted the same as Denny's coffee."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised to find this fun and organic foodie establishment! The Serrano-Avocado Shrimp Salad was a good choice amongst others from Mathias, our server. Entertainment this beautiful Saturday night by the sultry 18-yr old singer Carly and Gil on the acoustic guitar...made the night  perfect! Looking forward to future visits to this fine establish. Thank you!"}
{"text":"I will start out with saying I love love love their food. Absolutely fantastic. But the 3 stars come from their lack of service.   I've been to the Herb Box 3 times for lunch. I eat out for lunch almost every day of the week, either with vendors, my co-workers, or clients. Places open for lunch need to be on top of their game for the professional crowd, and the Herb Box falls short. There were times I would look around the restaurant and would not see a waiter for a good 10 minutes. If you head there for lunch, expect a minimum of 2 hours. Granted, a very delicious 2 hours, but none the less, 2 hours of unbillable time.  If you do have 2 hours to spare for lunch or you head out for dinner (I cannot speak of their dinner service), I highly recommend their burger with the brie cheese and green apple/jicama relish. To die for."}
{"text":"Very fresh and well prepared food. The salmon is always great.  Interesting sides, and nice main dishes, things you don't see every day.  Oh and the lemon meringue pie is the best."}
{"text":"Great food and somewhat slow service at times but such a cute place it was worth the wait. We've been a couple times and the food was always stellar."}
{"text":"The Herb Box will not disappoint you at all.  If it does then I really don't think you know how food should taste.  Seriously, the food here is something anyone should look forward to in there day. The ambiance is very nice and quaint which adds to a very intimate experience as well.  The wraps here are all works of creativity.  Using fresh and/or organic ingredients making a delightful meal.  There are many wraps to choose from and I think you can't go wrong with any of them.  As and added treat your order includes a side of sweet potato chips...and yes they are wonderful!  This place surely knows what they are doing and without a doubt has a bright future.  I'll be back many times and I'm sure it will be busy every time!"}
{"text":"I like the idea of fresh food and like the menu. We had the butternut enchalidas and were very good. Friend got the short rib and was good too. I like the patio and cocktails.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Food was ok, service was awful. I would not go back after my disappointing experience today. There are way better places to eat nearby! I was an Herb Box fan for years, but last visit was a 3 star and today was a 2 star to be generous. The service was flat out terrible!"}
{"text":"Good food and drink, attentive, friendly service, and great entertainment (d'Averill & Derek)!  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Had Andy as our server and his description of every item on the menu was amazingly accurate in his own unique hilarious way lol.  Was a great experience and a very enjoyable dinner for our entire dinner party.  If you want a good meal and great service I highly recommend going to see Andy here."}
{"text":"What a great place for brunch! I met my friend here on a Friday afternoon and luckily we made it JUST in time to beat the lunch crowd. I got the Market Street Short Rib Tacos and they were tastyyyyy. A bit messy since short rib juices was kinda leaky but it is definitely a must try! The menu here is incredibly extensive and there are so many other items to choose from! I want to try the Chicken Arugula goat cheese wrap, the Korean Cauliflower Quinoa Bowl, and Pear & Gorgonzola Flatbread. If I lived in the area, I would probably be here all the time stuffing my face until I popped. The ambiance of The Herb Box is amazing and the bathrooms are pretty awesome. Definitely a place to try out if you've never been and a place I will return to. =]  PS. If you enter from the first floor, I believe that is their mini cafe. If you want to eat at the actual restaurant you'll have to go up to the second floor!"}
{"text":"I absolutely loved this place and my entire experience.  My ZenJen cocktail was one of the best I've had recently- perfect combination of sweetness and tang.  For shared plates we had the Avocado Love and the Cilantro-lime crab dip.  The Avocado Love comes with a mulitgrain toast under a sea of arugula and avocado. Initially the plantain chips that came with the crab dip were a bit soft, but the waiter promptly and graciously replaced with with crispier ones. The cilantro-lime crab dip itself was impressive. It is entirely pureed with an exquisite combination of flavors that were well-complimented by the plantain chips. The bf had to keep telling me \"you've already said that\" every time I gushed about how much I loved both dishes. The portions of the small plates were actually so large that we almost wanted to cancel our main entree of Baby back ribs. The ribs were so tasty though that I somehow made room for them. They come with a bowl of gouda mac and cheese, with a crumbly top just the way I like it. I wish I had room for dessert since the dessert menu seemed very interesting.  Overall, swanky ambience, with a good crowd of people without being overly loud. I loved everything we had and wanted to explore even more on the menu. Compliments to the chef for a very fresh, creative, delicious menu. This is one of the best dining experiences I've had in a while. Excellent, friendly service. Better to make a reservation if coming on a Friday/Saturday night."}
{"text":"We were lucky to find a restaurant that took us during Sunday brunch rush. Herb Box was a short 10-15 minute wait.   I asked who did the decor and the hostess said the owner did.  I loved her decoration in the women's toilet so much I included a photo.   By waitress recommendation Our group ordered the Korean Cauliflower w/ quinoa  (it was interesting). Then we had the pear and Gorgonzola flatbread.  It was ok.   The Chilequiles was something I'd recommend. This was a hearty meal that if you ordered any starters you could share this cause it's filling.   I like to add a kick to my food so the busboy brought the tabasco sauce. When I did a shake, someone took out the top portion to control the flow of tabasco so my food was douced with tabasco sauce.   I actually didn't mind however, something didn't agree with my tummy so I had to use the restroom.  I have a feeling it could have been the tabasco sauce.   Anyway, my son loved the steak and eggs.   Overall I would give a Yay to try the Herb Box."}
{"text":"I have been here twice now- once for dinner and once for brunch.  I love the space- the outside is cozy, warm and inviting.  My wife and I had a drink at a small table by the bar with our own fireplace. It was very relaxing. We followed this with dinner on the patio. I had the ribs and they were surprisingly EXCELLENT.  They fell off the bone and were super tasty.  In addition, I have a dairy allergy and the waiter went the extra mile to ensure everything I had was dairy free. Brunch was also excellent.  I had the egg sandwich and it was also very tasty.  It is a great location, great atmosphere and I have had 2 great experiences."}
{"text":"So three stars for good drinks, but the food in my opinion is only so-so. Been here a few times. The staff is friendly albeit a bit slow at times, drinks are tasty and unique (i'm talking to you basil and cucumber mojito...I want you inside me) but the food has disappointed a few times; tried the cuban pork sandwich most recently and the meat was dry and had very little flavor. The short rib tacos aren't bad, but definitely places n Phoenix that do it better. Good atmosphere, cool little spot in DC ranch, but nothing spectacular for the price."}
{"text":"The atmosphere and food at this place was pretty good. I had the butternut and corn tortilla enchiladas. I was pretty disappointed with service though. We had to wait for quite some time although there were many tables open. Other people waiting to be seated were also complaining about the wait and how much money they must be losing out on! Wasn't the worst place, but definitely not my favorite."}
{"text":"The food was decent but not very hot. There were only 2 other people in the restaurant and after 15 minutes I had to get up and ask a waiter if we could order. He came later and said your waitress will be out. Took 15 minutes to get a refill on a drink.  Not sure why the customer service here sucks. If it was busy then I would completely understand.  They are way overstaffed and super slow. They need to learn better customer service skills. It is Scottsdale so I was not expecting too much."}
{"text":"Ick!  Everything about my first experience here was terrible. Our server never smiled, our food took 45 minutes to come out (they weren't busy at all) and worst of all...everything was lukewarm or cold. I served when I was in college so I get it, it's a tough job. But when you clearly forgot to put our order in and then left it sitting...you should probably be pleasant. Our server also dropped our food looking pissed off...but no silverware. It took another 5 minutes to get someone to get us cutlery.   I'll never be back."}
{"text":"I've been here several times for business lunches and find that they have reliably good food and service.  It is not unusually pricey for downtown Scottsdale with $13-$15 salads. I love the Market Sunflower with berries, goat cheese and blackened chicken and the Steak Salad with cooked-to-order meat, corn, peppers and blue cheese vinaigrette, . Both have lots of yummy ingredients and have really great flavor.  Portions are nice size and have a good serving of protein. The patio is pleasant on the \"waterfront\" (it's a canal, but in the desert we all pretend its a river), as is the dining room."}
{"text":"Maybe I don't have fancy pants taste buds, but then neither do my mom or wife. We walked in and found out you need a reservation. The place was 1/2 empty and remained 1/2 empty, but they sat us in the hallway at small table meant for 2 for 3 people. Service was slow and underwhelming as well. Also, one of there \"reservations\" showed up, they were sat at their table, then they asked to move and they were able to. So, if the place wasn't ever full, why couldn't we get a table? The patio was also empty, we would've sat there!  Nothing we ate was all that good. Edible, but I wouldn't pay this price for this food. We've had so much better food around the area it's hard to justify this place. The place looks nice and the waitresses were all dressed in \"cute\" dresses, but the decor and fashion won't make the food taste better.  My wife enjoyed this place, but not the food. She wanted to keep ordering mimosas, but at $7 a pop in tiny glasses, hardly seems worth it. To be honest, this feels like a restuarant started by someone who had a dream of designing a cute restaurant and fancy food, but couldn't connect the dots. Not sure if that makes sense, but I just don't get this place.  If you have too much money, you'll probably like this place. That seemed to be the crowd here anyway."}
{"text":"Had a lovely brunch on the patio of The Herb Box today.  Beautiful weather and ambiance.    Ordered the Market Street BLT from the brunch menu, substituting the bacon for avocado instead.  There was a $2.00 extra charge fee.  It was delicious!  The arugula was very fresh.  The entire sandwich was simply perfect.    Our waitress was so-so.  My friend tried to change the goat cheese and chive omelet to a scramble instead and she rudely stated no-no substitutions, but when I asked to substitute bacon for avocado, it wasn't a problem.  I could have done without her snotty attitude.    Would loved to have tried the red velvet cupcake, but it was $6.00!  Holy cow!  More expensive than Sprinkles!  No thanks!    Can't wait to come back and try more items off the menu.  Think I'll visit the Old Town Scottsdale location instead though to avoid that waitress."}
{"text":"This is Liz from the threefitsisters.com blog.   Herb Box is good, not knock your socks off good, but definitely satisfies and I love that it is local and semi-healthy (depending on what you order).  The food itself would have been 4 stars, but I knocked down half a star for the service and half a star for the price (too expensive for what you get).  I went with a party of 3 at 4:15, so it was an awkward time but I still expect to be served well, especially since it was't so busy. There seemed to be a lot of staff walking around, but for some reason there was only one waiter serving the entire inside of the restaurant (about 4 other parties). So, we flagged down another waitress and she took our order and sent it to the kitchen, which was nice.  We ordered the mac & cheese, the korean cauliflower, the market salad, beef short rib enchiladas, and the corn and goat cheese flat bread. My sister got a green flash beer, also.  The entrees were all great! I would have preferred if my chicken was cut up and tossed into my salad instead of having huge chunks on top, but it was moist and well seasoned. I appreciate the fact that they respected my wishes for EXTREMELY light dressing on my salad--overdressed salads are disgusting.The flat bread was great, and my sister said the enchiladas were also good.  I didn't particularly care for the mac & cheese. The portion was pretty small, the noodles were a little over cooked, and it wasn't the cheesy. The cauliflower, however, was spectacular! Need to learn how to make that at home.  I love the ambiance of the herb box! The decor is very modern-anthropologie-ish and the bathrooms are gorgeous. I noticed that theres a large room in the back for parties, also. Their outdoor seating looked nice too, but it was too cold the day I went.  Overall, a great spot! I would love to come here for breakfast or brunch. I'm sure the service is usually better, but the prices are definitely a little steep."}
{"text":"Hmmm.. Well this place is pretty damn good.  I mean it's freaking nice inside and out and they have a lil' market 'down stairs' where you can buy some of their pre-made food items (and cheese! and snacks! like they're freaking awesome sweet potatoe chips!) :D  I was all smiles with my turkey wrap (I fucking hate wraps, but my doctor suggested less bready options cause I'm ::cough::  :: cough:: ::over weight:: ::cough::)  As Arnold would say \"Ahl be bock\""}
{"text":"Of course I read the reviews before heading over to The Herb Box so I knew that the plates were pricey and I prepared myself for the potentially healthy dining experience that would be ruined by cheeses, charring, and frying (oh my!), but I really want to try this place because of the creative menu that I haven't seen at other restaurants. And that is worth paying for.  First impression: it looks bigger from the outside, but I liked the baked goods display case in plain view upon entering so I could see what sweets I might want to order. Service was on point. There was a lot of bustling and we got all the food together. No long wait times. Glasses never empty.   The plates are pretty, colorfully enticing, and it was not at all difficult to get a dose of greens. But I feel like some of the choices over compensated where they didn't need to. It's almost as if they wanted to charge not less than a certain price for each plate so they add in a slice of this and a cube of that to justify the price point.  For example - my sweet potato avocado baja bowl consisted of a small slice of poblano, few cubes of sweet potatoes, charred onion, heap of black beans, two and a half thinly sliced caramelized plantains, kaniwa, tobasco flavoured shallots, spoonful of avocado, queso fresco, and jalapeno-avocado dressing for $13. The plantains had a cinnamon flavor and were totally out of character. There's already sweet potato as the starch. Onion AND shallots? Separately the ingredients were good, but they didn't harmonize very well the way a good bowl should.   Before I get to the dishes I liked, I will briefly mention the three red velvet pancakes with mascarpone creme and a side of gran marnier syrup for $12. How do I politely say the word \"Yuck\"? There was a hint of chocolate flavoring in the pancakes, I don't remember the mascarpone creme, and the syrup tasted like baby food to me. I know you're thinking there's something wrong with me. How could I not like a dish with the words red velvet attached? Well, there's a first time for everything.  Now about the stuff I liked:  Korean fried cauliflower came with quinoa and crisp sweet sliced sugar snap peas for $13. The cauliflower was tasty and cooked just right and I really wished there were more florets. Averaging $2.20 per floret I would have rather they left out the quinoa and given more cauliflower. More cauliflower! More cauliflower! More cauliflower!  Avocado love was a shared plate of three thin slices of hearty toast under a mound of arugula mixed with a few shavings of fennel, sweet serrano glaze, and lemon-honey vinaigrette for $12. Who decided to name this avocado love? I hate them. You would think something named avocado love would be full of avocado. Well, there was hardly any avocado on my dish so I wasn't feeling much love. But - I did love the mound of greens I got and thought it was tasty. Nice sweet n' spicy sauce gave it a kick. My preference though, would be for less sauce and more avocado.  Butternut squash corn enchilada came with a decent sized side kale salad with edamame, corn, pickled onion, and cheese for $15. If you like cheese the enchiladas will not disappoint. They were the skinniest pair of enchiladas I've ever seen, but the flavor really pulled through. Also they were covered in green sauce and moist to the last bite.   Sweet potato tacos with onion, cheese, micro greens, corn, avocado, and a mini side of bean salsa was $15. Potato tacos? Shut up! They tasted good. Stop lying! No seriously, I never pictured myself ordering a potato taco. Even as a vegetarian, that sounds ridiculous. But I stepped outside of my box and really enjoyed them. There were only two of average size (with no side) and even at that price I enjoyed them.   I should mention that these plates are from the weekend brunch menu which they serve until late in the afternoon. I would definitely go again, but not often and not for dinner. If they changed a few things such as giving three tacos instead of two The Herb Box would be a spot that I would stop at more often. I love the creativity and hope new dishes and/or improved dishes are offered soon."}
{"text":"Beautiful experience!  Must have the Brussels sprouts chips!! Salmon glazed in honey and orange was amazing. Spare rib enchiladas melted away at the first bite. Excellent wine list and super friendly staff.  This is a restaurant you want to visit while in Scottsdale!!"}
{"text":"Having frequented the Herb Box DC Ranch for many years, along with spending part of my wedding there celebrating with the staff that is no longer working there,  today was a massive disappointment.  We went for lunch with our new puppy (Old town location is dog friendly) and told the hostess we had our dog with us and could she please seat us outside.  We were the ONLY ones on the patio as it was almost 2 pm.   We were given water and when the waitress came out, she looked at us almost as if she smelled something horrible.  The first words out of her mouth were \"Do you have a service dog badge?\" When I said we didn't she told us she couldn't serve us and they didn't have a permit for dogs.  When I told her the other location was dog friendly, she told me, \"they must have different rules\", when I told her the hostess sat us down, she said, \"she's a busser\".  She was probably the rudest waitress I have ever encountered.  I immediately called the manager, Eric and relayed the conversation and asked for the waitresses name.  He said he couldn't give it out.  Apparently she is either in the witness protection program, or part of the Harry Potter series as a very close relative of  \"he who must not be named\".    Eric did offer a gift card, but the Herb Box DC Ranch has left such a nasty taste in my mouth not even the offer of free food can take it away.    It's okay to be dog unfriendly, but to be people unfriendly is unacceptable."}
{"text":"What a great menu.  I love Herb Box' menu, and haven't eaten a bad thing there.  I just can't bring myself to go back, though.  The Stetson location is so poorly designed.  The entrance is hard to find, the greeter station is a huge dangerous bottleneck screaming for a patron to server pile-up, and I don't think they incorporated anything in the decor to absorb noise.  The place is so noisy our server couldn't hear us.  The live music was a nice thought, but ended up just adding to the insanity.    Too bad, because I loved my food and the service seemed very good once she heard us correctly.  I'll rush back if I hear they've redecorated.  In the meantime, there are just too many places in the neighborhood with good food, good flow and good acoustics."}
{"text":"Great pick for my wife's birthday dinner.  We've always wanted to try the Herb Box and found a great occasion.  The menu offers a wide range of foodie friendly comfort food that will satisfy the vegetarian and omnivore alike.  There was also a good list of mixed drinks.  I would recommend the sangria over the mojito.  I had the ribs and macaroni and cheese with bread crumbs.  The bread crumbs make it fancy.  There is some great outdoor seating when the weather is accommodating.  The restaurant is on the Scottsdale waterfront.  I don't quite get the fake herbs as a center piece of each table, but the restaurant does seem to be surrounded by an herb garden.  There's a bakery down stairs that makes some of the menu items.  I'm sure we'll be back, and may even take the parents next time they are in town, if you get my drift."}
{"text":"Worst Service ever! Went during 2 o clock hour on a Wednesday. Got seated right away but the waiter was completely out of it or just felt some kind of way towards me and my party. Off to a good start by bringing water immediately but asked for my partners drink and didn't ask for mine. Came back with his, still didn't ask. Finally 5 mins later we get our order in. Mine consisting of just appetizers and my drink. 15 mins later..still nothing! I even saw him pour someone else the same drink right at the bar. Ridiculous"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere and fresh-seasonal food concept here - make sure to request a seat on the patio if the weather is nice!   Went here for lunch this week - the service was quick and friendly and the food was great. The lunch menu has lots of great salads, sandwiches, flatbreads and wraps. I had the Market Sunflower Salad and added avocado. It was delicious and had chicken, goat cheese, bacon, dried strawberries and blueberries, sunflower seeds and balsamic.   I'm an avocado nut and have tried their 'avocado love' during a different visit and I would definitely recommend that to follow avocado fanatics! And if you're a mac & cheese lover, try their smoked gouda mac & cheese with rosemary garlic and breadcrumbs - it's amazing.  Have also been here for breakfast - lots of great breakfast menu items - including red velvet pancakes! Very rich and delicious - a good order to share with a few people if you just want a taste.   It looks like they also have some great happy hour specials. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Came into The Herb Box about a month ago with my family while visiting Scottsdale.   We started with the brussel sprouts appetizer. Wow. That was outstanding. It was absolutely amazing. We had a fork battle to see who could get the last bite off of the plate. Wow.   Then, I had the crispy chicken blt. But instead of having fried chicken, I had them grill it instead. They were really nice about doing that sub for me. The sandwich was exactly what I needed. The basil-garlic mayo was SO good. MM.. I wish I could have taken that home with me. The sandwich could have stood alone, but it came with sweet potato chips. The chips were also really good but because the sandwich was so big, I didn't really need the chips.   I would give this place a five star rating, but I felt like the service was slightly lacking. It was a bit cold outside, and instead of turning on the heater right by us for US, they dragged it across the patio for another table to use. I was bummed by this because I was cold and hungry. Thankfully, they ended the hungry part but I was still cold!"}
{"text":"Been stopping here all the time for a coffee on the weekends.  Stopped today for an Iced Coffee, small ....$4.56!!!! Are you kidding me? A 16 oz cup half filled with iced and 8 oz of coffee poured over it. I got hosed. Last time here. Word of caution....ask how much before you buy!"}
{"text":"I love this for seasonal farm to table style food. It can be a bit pricy but it's very tasty. They have all the dishes very clearly labeled if you have dietary restrictions and they don't hesitate to change things for you...and let you know if those changes aren't a good idea. (Not a common thing).  I've been for brunch, lunch, happy hour, and dinner. Never anything less than good. The live music outside is wonderful. I think this is a great date spot. It's where I met my inlaws. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Still dreaming about the pakora I had for dinner at Herb Box! Really solid food overall; small entree portions (the salmon, at least) but the quality is definitely there. The only gripe I had about the place is that they classify themselves as \"healthy\" - I wouldn't really necessarily consider deep fried kale and sugar-crusted salmon that healthy, but I definitely didn't leave with a heavy, bloated feeling even after such a large meal. I'd love to come back again with more people; the menu lends itself to sharing multiple dishes!"}
{"text":"For Sunday brunch:  Issues mostly related to poor service and it was not crowded yet. One of our orders was incorrect and the waitress never checked to see if things were ok. The temp and texture of our food led us to believe it had been sitting out a while. I was never asked if I wanted more coffee and it was never offered. Even when waitress came to give us the bill she never inquired about the meal and at that point we just wanted to get on with our day. All in all pretty lousy experience that was not worth the $$. We don't plan on returning."}
{"text":"Located in the charming old town of Scottsdale, this restaurant has a fun, hipster vibe with trendy decor and an adventurous menu. I made reservations and was seated outside in the courtyard. The waiter was friendly and helpful, so I anticipated a great evening.  First of all, don't be fooled by the name--the dishes are far from healthy and fresh. It took me quite some time to settle on the steak salad. Most of the dishes were smothered in sauces, and quite unappealing.  The salad came out (thankfully I ordered the sauce and dressing on the side) and I was pleasantly surprised by its appearance. All of that went downhill as soon as I took a bite. The meat tastes like it had been marinating for days. The flavor was muddled and flat. I ate the salad and half way through, felt very sick. When I went to the bathroom, I was horrified by what I found. Dirty, old fixtures and and unkept space. I usually judge the cleanliness of a restaurant by its bathrooms, so this was highly disappointing.  If they put so little effort into keeping the visible spaces clean, how are they up keeping the kitchen? My suspicions were further heightened when I spent most of the night sick from the odd meat that graced my salad. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Lots of amazing gluten free options.  I had a hard time choosing!  I ordered the crab dip with plantains and the trout.  OMG!!  So tasty.  Definitely will return."}
{"text":"We came here for brunch on vacation, and I think \"brunch on vacation\" means that everything tastes 10% better. Even without the 10% rose-colored-glasses boost, however, this place rocks. I got a Bloody Mary (spicy and peppery, as it should be!) and the short rib tacos and oh my god. Put the short rib tacos in your face as soon as you can, and as often as you can. My boyfriend got the chilaquiles and they looked good, but I was too busy in the midst of my love affair with the short rib tacos to sample any.  We sat outside, and the ambiance was great. Old Town (I think that's where this is? #tourist) is adorable and walking around near the restaurant was interesting. It also doesn't hurt to be eating brunch outside in 80-degree weather in October."}
{"text":"Had lunch with a friend. A superb experience. Wonderful fresh ingredients and pretty large - took home half of my sandwich and salad and had it for dinner! Good service and pleasant all round. Will definitely be back with hubby this time!"}
{"text":"My sister and I decided to check out The Herb Box when she was in town visiting. We loved  everything about it! The ambiance was great, there was even live music on the patio. The food was fantastic and the service was the best I have had in the valley hands-down."}
{"text":"This review is now based upon two experiences.  The first time here I gave Herb Box five stars despite a service issue thanks to very good food.  After my second experience, it loses a star.  In fact, if yesterday's dinner had been my first here, the Herb Box would have struggled to get even three.  The big problem here, I think, is that management (especially front of the house) is very poor, if it exists at all.  I'll start with what went wrong this time.  Although we had a nice table, and our server was very pleasant, she was not very effective.  It took over an hour to get our main courses, a glass had green matter stuck on it, a knife had a broken tip, and the server disappeared for 10 or 15 minutes at a time.  The food also was not as good - maybe I was lucky the first time, but today the pakora was served cold (I think a cold dressing was poured over luke warm food).  Other dishes we tried were unimaginative or outright misses.  Now on to the first review which originally earned The Herb Box five stars.  First, the issue.  This location of the Herb Box is in a space that is not ideal for a restaurant, or else it was poorly designed.  Some of the tables are fine, but there are so many angles and nooks that a fair number of them are very inconvenient.  This is especially true of their tables for two -- in fact, I would recommend not coming here unless you have a party of three or more because you will be seated at one of these problems.  Our table was stuck in a corner so tight that we had trouble getting to it.  The table top was marred by digs and scratches (as was the one next to us), and both the table and chair wobbled due to an uneven floor.  When we asked for something else, we were shown even worse options.  For the food to make me forget this inconvenience would be a near impossibility - but it did.  I would particularly like to mention the pakora appetiser, which epitomizes the Herb Box's ability to marry flavors and textures into a creative and thoroughly enjoyable taste treat.  The Thai ribs, mac and cheese side dish, and even the trout continue this theme.  How can grilled trout be tasty?  Try adding pickled condiments and a scallion-based creamy side.  It really worked.  Will the real Herb Box please stand up?"}
{"text":"Excellent Food.  Poor Service.  I will come back in the future.  Took 1 hour and 50 minutes to complete lunch.  This was after waiting about 11 minutes to be seated.  We needed to ask another server to find our server so we could order things we wanted.  Our server was very nice and very accurate with the order, but kept forgetting about us while busy on the other side of the restaurant.  For the cost of lunch ($99.31), including 4 glasses of their least expensive wine, the service was not up to snuff.  We ordered the Brussel spout chips (we recommend them, great), the steak salad - very good, it had a nice salad that was diverse in it's make-up, and we ordered the cauliflower lentil bowl, again, very good.  Generally we are very generous with our tips and patience, but something was not right here. The time interval between service was too long.  Again - great food.  Definitely a great place to get a wonderful lunch, priced on the high side, but not too high for the area."}
{"text":"I came here for my sister's 21st. We ordered the cilantro jalapeño hummus, smoked Ancho chili goat cheese eggplant dip, thai peanut black quinoa summer rolls,  and smoked gouda mac and cheese.  Everything was amazing! !!!!!!! Our server Heather was really nice too!! I definitely want to come back soon!"}
{"text":"Had a great vegan lunch here. I was super impressed and pleased with everything. Staff was fantastic, food was delicious. Our waitress, Allison, was wonderful, funny, knowledgeable, and attentive. 4 stars instead of 5 for being a bit pricey for what we got. Will be back, but probably for a special occasion rather than casual lunch."}
{"text":"First time. Brunch was amazing! We had the peach french toast, so good but bread is very dense, not light and fluffy (in case that's what you're looking for), Butternut squash enchiladas which has won local awards (served with a big green salad), and I had the chilaquiles (best I've ever tasted). Got the sweet potato muffin and blueberry/peach scone to go for bkfst tomorrow."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved finally getting to The Herb Box, after seeing it so many times of going to ArtBridge Thursdays in the Fall.  Four of us went, for an anniversary dinner.  Looking forward to it for days, and it was well worth going.  As said by others, the ambiance is beautiful... a perfect compliment for Scottsdale weather and surroundings.    We chose early dinner service on a Saturday, happily avoiding rushes or crowds.  The background music was just right too.   In 115 degrees, we only ever consider Inside seating!  So, we were very comfortable, especially with the chairs being wide and nicely cushioned.    Our service was good... very very good when he was at our table.  A few times, he was not around, so we had to ask another server for an extra aioli for the fingerlings, for extra napkins and waited a bit for refills on the raspberry hibiscus iced tea (a really nice tea).   We do not recall the server asking if we wanted refills on the two alcohol beverages.   The water service was on top of things though.    The server was very helpful with letting us know all about the menu... very very helpful with it being our first time.  Every time he was at our table, he was so nice and helpful.  At our table, we had: Fingerling Potatoes with aioli---  Perfectly cooked... But, it was the first sign that I, personally, needed to ask the server to bring salt to the table.  (I always taste my food before adding salt... always hoping I don't need to.)    Cilantro-jalapeno edamame hummus, with grilled naan---  Very tasty!  Butternut Squash Corn Enchiladas--- Good, would like to try something else next time, the server really really pushed it.  Portobello manchego 'burger'--- Delicious  Coffee molasses glazed grilled pork chop--- Good but for about $24, it should have been more than 1 pork chop, coleslaw and two thin slices of sweet potato.  Thai BBQ Baby Back Ribs--- Delicious especially the BBQ sauce on the ribs... it went well with the green apple slaw slices... the Smoked Gouda Mac & Cheese was very very light on the cheese and thank goodness for the panko, that made it worth eating... otherwise, I kinda kept looking for some aspect of it looking cheesy...  it did have a thin cheese sauce,(and it makes sense that this restaurant  does work hard at healthier options... so no blame to them.) I added salt, so that made it better, too.  We all shared a dessert of Tres Leches cake with strawberries.  Very nice and they did make it seem like a lighter option.  A tasty ending.     All in all, very happy with going to The Herb Box... It seems picky to point out the details, but that's where the difference is between Great and WOW I CAN'T WAIT to go back.  This was a very very nice experience, wondering what it would be like to go again.   Oh, yes, it was SUPER GREAT to have such GREAT choices for our vegetarian friends.   That's a huge reason why we picked going there."}
{"text":"Had lunch there yesterday, the menu is extensive in meeting the needs of most diets! I have the veggie bowl with quinoa, lentils and amazing chips which were actually Brussels sprout leaves. My friend had the chicken and bean chili, which she enjoyed. The building was hard to find coming from the direction of the canal, and no visible signage! It was a week day lunch, and not crowded. It will be my go to place when in Old Town for sure. Only comment on not five stars...they didn't have any Presecco in stock...oh dear what's a girl to do!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this location since the one in Scottsdale is far from me so I headed over there after school but to say how disappointed I was is an understatement! I am highly, highly upset that 1. When I first arrived no one greeted me immediately, 2. When I inquired about my pick up order they had no idea what I was talking about, when the girl that took my order finally came around, they informed me that it'll be a little while longer (no problem) 3. I'm on my home now, already on my side of town when I decide to taste a bit of the meal (I ordered the Korean Fried Cauliflower and the Korean Soba Noodle Bowl BTW) the cauliflower tasted really bad, it had a chalky flour flavor to it and the \"noodle bowl\".... was just sad. None of it was worth $13 and since I was near my home and had to go to work soon I could not return it. I am highly upset and disappointed. I will not go there again and I will be calling the manager."}
{"text":"I have always loved both locations of The Herb Box, but after two back-to-back negative customer service experiences at the Old Town location, I am going to have to reconsider.   The first instance was a Friday at lunch time. I had made a reservation (for a party of three) and I checked in at the host stand a few minutes early. I was still waiting for the other two guests so they confirmed my name and reservation and said to just let them know when I wanted to be seated. As I was standing there one of my guests arrived. The other was having trouble finding parking (old town during spring training... yikes), so I walked down to the street to see if I could help her find a spot. My dining companion asked to be seated on the reservation under my name and the host (who might have been the manager and had literally just checked me in) proceeded to ARGUE with her that there was no reservation under my name. So she asked to be seated inside with or without the reservation- mind you, the restaurant was probably only a quarter full. He said fine, but again that I didn't have a reservation. I did, he had checked me in, and why would it even matter at that point, just seat your customer in your nearly empty restaurant! She got seated, we all got inside, then the service was unmemorable and the waitress forgot our drinks.   The next day I was back again for a friend's birthday party brunch. He had called the restaurant to make a reservation for 14. Great, they don't do split checks he was told, so we all made sure to bring cash. The party arrived and we were seated at two different tables of 7, not even next to each other. He was told WHEN HE ARRIVED that they can't accommodate large groups. Completely inexcusable that he wasn't told that when he made the reservation, or that a follow up call wasn't made to clarify the seating arrangement. My friend spoke with a host that day and asked if they could rearrange a couple of the empty tables nearby to fit a few more people (again the restaurant was less than half full), and she was told no, that every single table in the restaurant was reserved. No one was seated at those tables through our entire brunch. It was ridiculous. It is one thing to not be able to accommodate large crowds, but that needs to be made completely known at the time of reservation, and also don't blatantly lie to customers about why you can't go out of your way to insure that they have a good experience. Our waiter was great and attentive, but the food has seriously gone downhill recently. I ordered the same brunch dish I always do (smoked salmon hash), and my over-medium egg was hard as a rock and the dish was not nearly as good as it has been in the past.   I don't know what had happened to this place, but it is really unfortunate. It really was the perfect brunch, lunch, or dinner spot but unless they stop this downward spiral, I won't be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"My husband and I came in early on a week day, after lunch not quite dinner. We were one of I think 3 table in the joint.  Fine by me, again, weird time of day,  but I needed a drink. It was happy hour, sweet.  Drink wise their happy hour is OK, but when you look at their specialty cocktails you will have a hard time sticking to the happy hour menu.  The Shrinking Violet was awesome!  Pricey, but oh so yum. We split a couple of appetizers.  We were not at all disappointed by any of them. I could have stuck a straw in the broth of the Shrimp and Smoked Jalapeno Rioja Butter and just sucked it all up, really.  That good. The hype on here about the Market Street Short Rib Tacos, not a lie.  So good.   And finally the Brown Sugar Jerk Pork Sliders.  Tasty.  Really really really tasty. With how much we enjoyed the starters I look forward to going back more the main event.  Oh, and the service was great too, very friendly."}
{"text":"Delicious food, good wine, and a beautiful location are all expectations of a nice Scottsdale restaurant and Herb Box delivers on all 3 criteria. Spacious with an every evolving seasonal menu, I enjoy each visit as it is different from the last. Salads are wonderfully fresh and desserts are also tasty.  With so many good restaurants in the area to choose from, this is my go to for New American seasonal food when my friends and relatives want a taste of Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I think I could eat here on a daily basis. My best friend and I went for brunch. We went around 9am and there were only two other tables. We were given a choice as to where to sit and were promptly seated. I will admit that the table was quite uncomfortable. The chairs were a bit higher than usual and left no room to cross your legs under the table. Oh well.   We shared the brussel sprout chips which we both agreed were perfectly executed. They were just barely crispy, making them fork friendly, and the vegan aioli on the bottom of the plate was delicious. The seasoning was on point too. I could eat these all day.   We also shared the baby kale, Brie, and apple omelette and the short rib tacos. I did love the omelette, but the short rib tacos were most definitely the star dish. They were more than accommodating to my dislike of cilantro by putting the toppings on the side for me. (I know, I wish I liked it, I've tried numerous times to like it, but it's gross!). Anyway, the only thing I really didn't love was the glaze on the bacon. Which is crazy, because who doesn't love bacon, ever?  It had a little too much kick to it for my liking.   I'll definitely be back. I can hardly wait to try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"Love the breakfast here!!! Don't forget to go downstairs to the market find Adrian he helped me place a large order and made sure everything was perfect. Everything is made in house and fresh. Gotta check them out."}
{"text":"Cute place, but haven't been impressed with the food the past couple times we've been. The first time we went the breakfast was amazing but since then it's been mediocre at best. Ordered the orange chicken pancakes or something and it straight up tasted like my pancakes were drowning in orange peel juice. Ew!! RIP perfectly good pancakes. Gave it another shot and our server forgot our order of red velvet pancakes. He obviously rushed the order and promptly served us uncooked, yet burnt?, blobs of red batter. Sadly, I love everything... but the food."}
{"text":"I went to drop my car off for service and since it was so close to Old Town Scottsdale, me and my son decided to catch some breakfast. Only had an hour and half. My son wanted to take me to Herb Box so it sounded alright to me.   We got there right when they opened at 9am. Lots of open parking but after 10am forget it.  We decided to eat outside. What a great idea. Right next to the River Walk with a cool breeze and shaded the whole time. Excellent. Very relaxing.   Our server came pretty quickly for our drink orders and I got the cappuccino and my son got the Mango Ice Tea. Both were really good. My Cappuccino was a little small but well worth it.    I got the Smoked Salmon hash. Oh my goodness. So good. Really nice portion of smoked salmon with grilled potatoes, eggs, bacon, capers, and green onions. You get a small side of red pepper aioli. I poured that aioli all over and boom. So good. The aioli sauce gave it a nice kick. It's a good portion and really filled me up. Loved it. I would have no problem ordering this again.   My son got the breakfast burrito. All I know is it had egg and bacon but I know there was other stuff in it too. I got a bite and it was so good. Looked good. Tasted good and my son just loved it.   The service was really good. They really didn't rush you but let you just enjoy the outdoors. They filled up our water cups and checked on us to make sure everything was ok.   I just loved it at Herb Box. Really good food. Really good service. Great ambiance. Right by the river walk with a nice breeze today. As you can tell I really enjoyed it. I will definitely be back. Enjoy."}
{"text":"I can't believe this place has practically been in my backyard and I just discovered it. The food was OUT OF THIS WORLD. We had the crispy Korean cauliflower for a starter along with the chilled car dip and plantains. For dinner we sampled the Thai ribs, salmon, and Grilled steak salad. All of which was excellently prepared and tasted outrageous. Dessert was a warm mixed berry bread pudding and was the perfect way to end the meal. Not too sweet, just right. Atmosphere is great, service is excellent, staff is very friendly. We didn't have a reservation and day out on the patio and it was perfect, watching the sunset and drinking their skinny super fruit margaritas. Definitely would recommend this place and will be back very soon!"}
{"text":"The food was good and what little staff was there worked very hard and were polite.  It was so SEVERELY understaffed that I felt bad for the servers that were there and applaud them for having such a great attitude.   I saved some money because I drank a beer while waiting for the appetizer and was never approached by my server until after dinner was finished.   Not necessarily the fault of the server, there just weren't enough of them there.  At $8 a pop for a draft beer, they left a lot of money on the table"}
{"text":"I was excited to walk into this restaurant because of how lovely it looked from the outside. The inside of the restaurant is very home-like, with booths that have pillows and varying tables filling the dining area. Came during happy hour and was happy to find that appetizers were half off and specialty drinks, $5.  The waiter was slow in approaching us and the menu was initially very unsatisfactory. A group of us were actually contemplating getting up to try a different restaurant. The waitress somehow knew what we were planning, came to us just in time to recommend some of the most delicious dishes I've tried in a long time.   Our table shared the falafel appetizers that my friend described by saying \"there is no meat but they make it taste like it is.\" ... more simplistically put...it's good falafel!   brother got the thai ribs which comes with a side of mac and cheese and apple salad. DELICIOUS. supposedly the best ribs he ever had.  i shared the serrano-avocado shrimp salad which has the perfect amount of spice and crunch. The shrimp IS fried and the salad is topping two slices of bread though. The shrimp was cooked to perfection and eating half was more than sufficient.   Would love to come back and eat on their patio!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat lunch in old town. The food is so amazing and the atmosphere is perfect. I have never had a bad meal here or bad service. Vira the server is a superstar. She is so friendly, I would go back just to talk to her! The butternut squash enchiladas dish is a must have !!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here, restaurant was a little quiet because I got there before noon. Ordered the lentil cauliflower bowl with chicken. Full of flavor and fresh ingredients. Awesome portion. Pretty pricey menu.  Sat on the patio, had to deal with a pest of a fly, so if you don't want to keep waving a fly away, sit inside.   I would have given 5 out of 5 stars but the blonde lady who sat me had zero personality, my server however was awesome. Isn't it funny how one person's attitude can make you think twice about going back to a restaurant?  If customers come to your establishment, treat them well, start to finish."}
{"text":"Kobe Burger - excellent, seasoned, flavorfull and plentiful. Chips - cardboard. Cokes - perfect flavor and fizz. Deserts - too dry.  Use the calories at Lamar's. Hostess - a ditzy airhead who has smoked one too many bowls.  Love her. Fat Waitress - doesn't write down the orders so she is prone to \"forget\" several things.  She can't take care of herself she certainly isn't going to be able to take care of you.  Avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, super friendly staff. Beautiful outdoor patio. Quiet but still lively environment. The menu is varied and includes a healthy mix for pretty much anyone in the group or your family.   Selection of local bears which I appreciate for supporting economy of the state. Tonight I'm having the the Thai BBQ which, when inquiring about get an exuberant YES from anyone nearby that works here!   The Thai ribs were absolutely incredible, as recommended. The slaw was 90% there but needed a different green to compliment the apples, cranberries and cashews.  Mac & Cheese came cold, so needed to go back for a refire. I'm easy going to I only asked to heat. They chose to remake it. This means I didn't get a chance to let the spice of the Mac & cheese compliment the sweet of the Thai bbq. Nonetheless was fantastic.   Eric (I presume the manager) took the time to visit and make sure our meal and visit was pleasant. Nice touches make a visit that much more enjoyable. Our server, Brandyn was great, super sweet very attentive."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday for a quick bite to eat and got a great sandwich! I ordered the smoked turkey on ciabatta. The bread was VERY good and the turkey had a lot of flavor. The red pepper aioli spread had the perfect amount of spice to it. The smoked bacon and gouda was not over powering at all.   I was very impressed with how all ingredients in the sandwich went together. I would love to come back and try some other things like their wraps."}
{"text":"The sweet potatoes tacos are very tasty, I also tried their corn enchiladas and it's also a really good vegetarian option. Cute place too"}
{"text":"Service was great I believe his name was BO?? Love your new location I think you will be very successful there. I love \"I said Love the Tomato artichoke soup this should be a staple of Herb box. I did also visit your market place and I am sad you are stopped the tuna can you please bring this to the restaurant. I have been the Duke of the Herb box for a long time and plan to continue keeping this title."}
{"text":"Lovely little restaurant, terrific food. I had the soup/salad combo with Chipotle Chocolate Soup and the Sunflower Salad. The Soup was divine, with a blissful mini corn-muffin as garnish. The salad was pretty and just the right size. I splurged and got dessert, caramelized bananas over rice pudding which had luscious burnt-sugar bits floating in a buttery, sugary sauce poured over a not-overly-sweet rice pudding.  Mmmmmmmmmmm."}
{"text":"WOW......This place is great my boyfriend and I had lunch here today and it was our 1st time here. We will for sure come back to try brunch and dinner. We tried a Chilled Cilantro Lime crab dip it was excellent for sure recommend to try. The Service was OUTSTANDING here at the DC Ranch."}
{"text":"Herb box is one of our favorite places for breakfast/lunch. Their food is very unique and they use extremely fresh ingredients. Have never had a bad meal. The pita/hummus app, market sunflower salad, chilaquiles, pancakes and banana bread are our favorites. Also try one of their fresh juices, or our favorite, grab a bottle of sparkling wine/champagne with a creamer of mango puree on the side for a nice twist on mimosas. The atmosphere is relaxed yet eclectic. The flat screen tv at the bar is a plus too.  Highly suggest enjoying an afternoon beverage on the patio or at the outside part of the bar. The only criticism is that sometimes the staff appears a bit inexperienced, although always friendly. In particular, we were there today and waited for 20 minutes while a handful of tables sat empty on the patio with plenty of room for the couple reservations that were on the books. After your meal, set aside a few minutes to walk around the Market Street shops and check out the small park behind Grimaldi's."}
{"text":"The Herb Box was extremely accommodating to our large group of authors as we socialized before an event at Poisoned Pen. The atmosphere, the service, the food: everything was top notch. I enjoyed my drink, a sexy fizz and fig. The urban market salad was so pretty I had to share a picture on Twitter! Really, it had a perfect mix of flavors and textures.  This place has a good reputation for a reason. I'd gladly dine here again!"}
{"text":"Delicious!!!  I came here with some friends, and I ordered the Kobe burger. My, it was so fantastic. It had a ciabatta bun, I think, and the burger was cooked to perfection. In addition, it was pleasantly paired with these fingerling potatoes. They were so well prepared, like mini baked potatoes. And the there were so many, I shared with the whole table. My friend ordered the cauliflower appetizer and it was so savory and delicious, and I just wish I knew how to prepare vegetables to become like these. My friend also ordered the braised beef which was so soft and buttery. My friends also raved about the corn and goat cheese pizza and the Gorgonzola pizza, which I intend to try next. The server was also the bartender and was very knowledgeable with wine. She recommended this cab wine and it was so delicious.   We also sat outside, which was doable because of the surrounding misters, and we we're entertained by the lice music. Great time!"}
{"text":"Very cool atmosphere.  We went on a Saturday without a reservation and were seated quickly   which was nice.   We sat outside,  very nice setting.  Had tomato and avocado soup,  wonderful.   My daughter had a salad.  Both were very good.  Would suggest."}
{"text":"Consistent HORRIBLE service makes this restaurant less than mediocre.  I don't know why I came back the 3rd time but it confirmed my opinion.   The place was almost empty with waiters standing around.  I waiting an hour for even getting a menu.  The service is consistently poor and I will not return."}
{"text":"Chicken and apple sandwich sounds strange but is amazing. My favorite salmon , pineapples and rice. Sounds strange together but will leave you happy. The cocktails are great and they do amazing pairings with them."}
{"text":"Well the food is really fantastic. Great wine and beer list. Great ambience and close to my house. Occasional live music is a nice way to enjoy drinks on the patio and the small takeout/dessert counter is a sweet touch. However....the waitresses are bad. Really really bad. I feel like they always have very rough, not polite and not what I would except for the prices I pay and service I would expect."}
{"text":"LOVED this place!   This is hands down the best service I have ever gotten at a restaurant.  Now granted it was the middle of a weekday, but the waiter was nice, attentive, and he even gave us directions to a bar we were trying to find (not for that day, but for another time).  I had an amazing cocktail.  It was basically a mojito but used tequila  instead.  Which was perfect.  It took away some of the sweetness of a mojito and gave it a bit more body.    I was there with a family member and we split Asparagus and Fennel Frites and the Butternut Squash Corn Enchiladas.  Both I thought were pretty good.   I really liked the fennel, just because it was something a little bit different.  The enchiladas had a little spice to them but not a ton.  They were very flavorful though."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful meal with first class service. Appetizers were excellent - be sure to try to the kale, corn and sweet onion pakora. The Inline image chocolate espresso bombe was the \"bombe\"."}
{"text":"We tried the cilantro crab dip, gorgonzola flatbread, ans korean fried cauliflower appetizers. They were all tasty.  Atmosphere was very appealing and upscale."}
{"text":"This place is SO good... we live down the road, and finally walked to this great spot. The wine, appetizers, dinner AND cheesecake dessert was so out of this world!!! The waiter was beyond nice as well. We will DEFINITELY be back here"}
{"text":"Great healthy food, great atmosphere! Nice place for a casual date night. I'm a vegetarian and their menu offered a decent amount of options for me to choose from. Everything my husband and I ordered was beyond  our expectations."}
{"text":"Went yesterday for Mother's Day brunch.  Booked the reservation over a month ago and was told they were doing their regular menu, but was called a few weeks later to let me know it would be a buffet.  I said fine, and kept the reservation.  Little did I know this place is not conducive to a buffet.  It was not comfortable or easy to get to.  When a few people were in line, no one could get in the front door.  It was cramped into a little spot with some of the food being outside around the corner.  I would think some people wouldn't have even known there was any more food outside.   There was not a big selection and many of the items were dry and overcooked and the others were cold.  I usually like this place, but after this visit, I won't be rushing back.  We did love our waiter tho, and at least that part was pleasant.  I was surprised that it wasn't busy at all.  Many many empty tables.  I wish mine had been one of them.  :-) It gets 3 stars because we loved our waiter and it wasn't awful, just not up to par."}
{"text":"I attended a baby shower that was catered by the Herb Box. I knew it was going to be good - when we pulled up and saw the Herb Box vehicle, all my friends in the car started oohing and ahhing about the food we were about to eat.   The food was displayed so beautifully - it looked like a feast for kings and queens. So so pretty!  There were two different kinds of wraps, plantain chips w/ this amazing creamy crab dip, the most wonderful sundried tomato spread on crispy crostinis, and yummy mixed green salad. Everything tasted amazing. I am not a fan of sundried tomatoes, but that spread was so good - I wish I had the recipe!  If I ever need catering, I will definitely use this company!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed this last Sunday. Took out of state guest to try delicious brunch and we arrived at 2:18 pm and they refused to assist us. They seated us then everyone ignored us until one of the bartenders said they all wanted to close and leave at 3 pm. They turned away a family before us and one after us. The hours here should be 2 pm instead of 3 pm so their employees can leave by 3 pm. It was a nice day so I'm sure they didn't want to work. How we were treated was worse. Last weekend it took forever to pay out bill . Lunch took 1.5 hours. Very disappointed! We went to Market Street Kitchen and were served right away and greeted with smiling faces instead of scowl faces."}
{"text":"I'm going 3.75 stars here.  I really like the decor.  It struck me as somewhere between Cape Cod beach house and something you might pick up in Arcadia for 1.5 million.  The service was great.  I went with buckwheat pancakes for my brunch meal although I did get to sample several other meals as well.  My buckwheat pancakes were hearty and delicious.  The red velvet pancakes I tried were great as well.  I also tried the salmon hash (good but not my thing..)  I found the prices top be slightly high but I'm sure that any restaurant in this vicinity has to tack on a bit to cover the real estate.  Thanks to Aileen B for setting this brunch up!"}
{"text":"Service was so-so, less attentive than other restaurants that have the same type of atmosphere but the server was friendly.    I tried the shrimp arugula salad and it was pretty delicious :) just wish the shrimp wasn't battered because I like to be more health conscious!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place while exploring Scottsdale, and man where we glad that we did! Both me and my dining companion had enchiladas. Mine had better not squash and his were pulled pork. All of the food was great, fresh, and unique. I would love to return for breakfast or brunch sometime as well."}
{"text":"The first time I went we had a big group and plenty of conversation so we didn't really mind the slow service.  The flat breads were all great as were the tacos.  The pulled pork sliders were a little weak, but the food was very good overall.  The second time the horrible service reared its ugly head.  My girlfriend and I sat down and just under 20 minutes went by and no waiter came to see us.  The one guy I saw was absurdly overworked.  The poor kid seemed to have 10 tables and was bussing his own tables as well.  When we left the manager seemed genuinely apologetic and tried to offer us an appetizer.  I just can't give my business to a place like this when there are plenty of restaurants in the city that are hustling to earn our business.  I like the food, but the atrociously slow service is too much to bear."}
{"text":"And the Herb Box does it again... I knew not to go back after the terrible service, but my girlfriend said she really wanted to try it.  So what happens? I check my bank statement and they charged me twice!  Once for my meal and an additional charge for 137 bucks!  I'll change this review if they handle it well, but I'm not holding my breath."}
{"text":"The food is delish! Brunch, lunch and dinner, you cannot go wrong with the Herb Box. It is all good!"}
{"text":"Very cute and quaint little spot in old town. I've only come here for brunch, but my experiences have been really great each time. Service was great except for the last time I was there my food took exceptionally longer than anyone else's which was a bit frustrating. All the mimosas are fantastic. Love the look of this place. I want to try their bakery and coffee section at some point, but the restaurant is awesome overall."}
{"text":"I give this place a solid 3.75 stars. We had the Korean cauliflower, veg nosh board, falafel, and the mac/cheese. Mac/cheese never disappoints - we've had that plenty of times at their small shop in old town. Falafel was extremely underwhelming...you only get three itty bitty pieces. If you're gonna charge $9, at least make it 3 DELICIOUS itty bitty pieces. Cauliflower was on point, but again, portions:price ratio is not what I was expecting. Nosh board was good. Loved the kale pakora. The avo could have used some pita. We had cocktails and beer. $11 for cocktails...$8 for a local draft beer?! I was surprised to see that on my bill. I opted for draft cause I thought it'd save me a few bucks. I understand we ordered mostly apps, but I'm sure my feelings would be the same regarding their entrees. Sure, I understand the finesse and art of food...but I definitely felt a bit ripped off at the end of the night. I don't regret my decision coming here, because its been on my list of places to try, but I think I'll stick to getting herb box goodness at their small shop in old town.   Service was great, btw."}
{"text":"Very cute restaurant. We sat at the cafe but had food from the restaurant. Everything was fresh and delicious. It is a bit pricey - a bowl of sweet potato/beans/avocado was $15, though it was very good."}
{"text":"A couple weeks back I drove down to AZ to visit my pledge sister from my college sorority days.  She has been on a quest to find some of the best restaurants in AZ before she moves back home at the end of the school year. The Herb Box popped onto her list after yelping and hearing other talk about it.  She didn't have to twist my arm to go here for Sunday Brunch, especially when she mentioned Red Velvet Pancakes (funny thing is I didn't even order them once I saw their yummy menu)  My other friend and I decided to share two dishes, because it isn't every day that we find ourselves in Arizona and there were just too many things to choose just one.  We decided one sweet and one savory to be well balanced!   For the sweet: Cinnamon buckwheat pancakes (9) served with wild blueberries and strawberries, smoked applewood bacon, and whipped honey butter.  I am definitely a fan!  As intrigued as I was by the Red Velvet Pancakes, I'm happy that my friend went with these pancakes instead.  They were the perfect balance of sweet and not too sweet.  Also the buckwheat made me feel like I was being a little healthier without it tasting healthier.  Now I'm not a bacon fan, (*gasp* yes not everyone loves bacon) but everyone else who does like bacon loved theirs.  For the savory: I picked the smoked salmon hash (14) that came with crisp fingerlings, pancetta bacon, scallions, fried capers, aioli, and soft egg.  I know, that I just said I didn't like bacon but I picked a dish with pancetta bacon...but I love smoked salmon so I couldn't resist.  I could definitely taste the bacon but I thought it went well with everything else so I didn't mind.  I really enjoyed this dish and if you likely hearty salty goodness in the morning or for brunch would recommend trying this out  Not only was the food great their decor was also really fun and stylish.  There was several vintage pieces with a twist that gave it a very modern feel.  Also their bathrooms had some of the most interesting sinks that I'm having a hard time describing ...I wish I took a picture.  Overall, a great find by my friend.  If I lived in Scottsdale, I would go back without a doubt."}
{"text":"We went here this morning for Sunday brunch this morning. We called ahead for seating and we were seated promptly upon arrival. (Note- the old town location does not do call ahead seating).   My husband ordered the chilequiles verde and our friend and I both ordered the bourbon peach brioche French toast. The food was served super quick. The chilequiles were good, but the bite I had could have been spicier. The French toast, however, was amazing. The middle was soft like bread pudding, and the edges were crunchy and caramelized.   The dessert menu had so many choices that  sounded delicious so it was hard to choose, but we settled on the honey spiced cheesecake. It had a salted cashew crushed and was served with a beer nut ice cream, which was really good.   Service was good. The waitress didn't hover, but our drinks didn't go dry and she checked in on us from time to time.   We will definitely go here again."}
{"text":"This is a really good restaurant in Scottsdale. It has a nice open layout and you feel like you have plenty of room. The decor is a fun modern. The servers are good and know the menu well.  It can be hard to decide what to get because everything on the menu sounds good. You can taste how fresh the ingredients are and the homemade sweet potato chips are great. You can't go wrong with anything you order. The bar could use a couple more beer options, but that isn't really their focus.   We'll be going here again."}
{"text":"Worst service, good was not cooked all the way through, flies inside, and they let animals in & they were not service animals.People smoking outside & it is against the law, too many crying babies, place not for kids"}
{"text":"Great Lunch place! Great food! Cheerful service! Sit in the courtyard.....this is definitely the Scottsdale Ladies lunch place to go..."}
{"text":"Every time I eat at this restaurant I get great service and food! I love their brussel sprouts, asian ribs with apple coleslaw. Even better yet, get it during happy hour!  The service is always incredible!"}
{"text":"This review is way overdue. I love everything about this place. I often just go solo after work and sit at the bar where I get to enjoy a yummy glass or two of Viognier and the chicken chile white bean soup. The soup comes out piping hot and certainly does not skimp on the tender chicken. The soup has a nice kick to it because of the green chiles but I love a kick! The soup is topped off with tortilla strips and creme fraiche. They also have great desserts. Other items on the menu are great as well and I try to order something different each time I come back, but I just can't get enough of that soup!!!"}
{"text":"Looking for a place to impress your date? Well look no further because your date will be like putty in your hands after this snazzy joint. You will def get a \"awww this place is cute\" from your date, certain guys and all girls. I sat outside so while I enjoyed the outdoor band, my bf enjoyed the basketball game on the many flat screens. Everything was great. Our waiter was hilarious and didn't mind we changed our opinion on how we wanted our steak down 3 times. Rare to well done to finally, at his suggestion, medium. The chairs are comfy, the food is fresh, and even the bathroom is nice. Really, there were people talking about the interior design of the bathroom while I was waiting in line. I got the stuffed chicken with goat cheese and my date got an open faced kobe. The meat not the Laker. They were both delicious. He loved the kobe. Now if only he felt the same way about the Laker version."}
{"text":"Stopped in with kids on a Sunday when they opened. All kinds of tables were open but we got turned away? Maybe not enough servers showed up? Or since we had a group of six with little kids? Turned away business."}
{"text":"The Herb Box is one of my favorite restaurants in Scottsdale.  The decor is nice and calming and so well applied. The location on the Scottsdale canal is really nice and there's a large patio that takes advantage of this. The menu has so many different options and tastes that a variety of people will enjoy. There is also a take out area, that has a small markets selling some of the favorites (hummus, salads, etc) Servers are always helpful, professional and attentive.  Here are some of the menu items I have enjoyed and notes about them. I am disappointed that they took off their Falafel dinner option. It came with two dips, falafel, and a salad. They took it off the menu a little while ago!  Iced Teas- They always have a variety of flavors and they're all well balanced and delicious.  Tzatziki+Hummus+Olives+Pita- Their Red Pepper Hummus has a  nice subtle spice to it, and the white bean artichoke is out of this world awesome. It's not as creamy as most Middle Eastern hummus' I enjoy, but it is a different breed and done so well. The olives are a great variety and the pita is good.  Crisp Falafel with Tahini Yogurt Sauce and Greek Salsa- The falafel aren't heavy or overly spiced, they are very light and so perfect. I actually don't put them in the same vein as other Falafel because they are so different. Same as I wrote about for the hummus. They are some of my favorite falafel though. The Tahini has a subtle lemon flavor and it's incredible. I could eat it with a spoon. I always as for extra Greek Salsa because it's yummy as well.   Butternut Squash Corn Enchiladas- These are light but filling with incredible ingredients then blend well together (Cojita, Spiced Pecans, Tomatillo- it works)  The Grow Happy Salad- Not your everyday salad. Pepitas, Pepperoncinis. Feta. Just awesome and filling in it's own right.  I want to try Brunch soon. The Red Velvet Pancakes are calling to me."}
{"text":"Coming here for happy hour was a great decision!! I was rushing to make it to an event, and decided to stop here beforehand. It took about 20 minutes to get the food, and then I was just about to cancel my order. However, the food came out and I was very impressed! I even got the food to go, which was a surprise because most places do not do this. The two dishes I was very impressed with was the Market Street Short Rib Tacos ($6.50) and sweet potato chips ($2). The Tzatziki + Hummus + Olives + PIta was OK. I'd probably pass on that the next time I come here. Overall, the place is very nice. Looks like you can come here for a birthday party or come on a date. It has a nice ambiance, which was surprising since the name of the place \"The Herb Box\" sounds like it has a casual setting. Good pick for lunch or happy hour!"}
{"text":"Four of us dined. The restaurant is very clean with great decor. Mom and my Aunt had tomato soup and Chibatta bread. Sister had Pear and Gorgonzola Flatbread and I had cold cauliflower steak, vegan aioli sauce, fried brussel sprout leaves, and quinoa. A poll of our Jolly Diners was that it was a 4.5 rating out of 5.  it was very good and we would recommend it for a good meal."}
{"text":"Herb Box in DC Ranch is awesome A must if visiting Scottsdale or if you are a local.  Great atmosphere   Awesome staff and the food is always perfect.  Say Hi to Katia or Shantel  Both incredible managers You will not be disappointed"}
{"text":"This place is nice for dining. The staff is nice, however I felt rushed with eating my meal. This was not necessary as the restaurant was not crowded nor busy. I always wanted to check out this place because it appeared cool. Advice to staff: let customers dine without rushing them. Service and food was nice as well."}
{"text":"Please come to Vegas. Yes, I am sending out a call for all charming, indie American eateries with creative, fresh-focused chefs to come to my city. My husband says it just gives me something to look forward to when we travel, but I think it couldn't hurt to have at least two places like the Herb Box in my town!  I adore the sun-filled dining area and the delicious Arnold Palmer. You can even get it made with decaf tea, and I did!   The menu had no shortage of delicious sandwiches, flatbreads and perfect lunch items (short rib tacos anyone?), but I decided to go green with the Grow Happy Salad. However, I did add steak. The salad with steak was perfect- a big heaping pile of mixed greens, a delicious red wine vinaigrette, and toasted pepitas! I have to love a salad with nuts.   We also had a platter of baked goods for dessert, and I will say that for the most part, I thought they were a little dry, so perhaps save room for something sweet down the street.   Our party was huge, and the service was painfully slow as a result. If you head there with a large party, I recommend splitting up into smaller groups perhaps."}
{"text":"Once seated on the charming patio for lunch, you know it's a good start when the server hands you a simple yet concise menu. We ordered the Market Street Short Rib Tacos and the Beef Short Rib Enchiladas + Manchego + Ancho - both tasted sublime and were a good, filling size. We both left satisfied with a desire to return.  UPDATE: Went to dinner here and was still impressed by the food. We ordered the Beef Short Rib Enchiladas + Manchego + Ancho and the White Bean Chicken Chili. The Enchiladas do not skimp on the meat or the flavour with the contrast of savory and the sweet of the Napa cabbage slaw. The White Bean Chicken Chili was a broth based chili with a slight unexpected kick to it and is just delightful with chunks of chicken, tortilla chips and a cilantro creme."}
{"text":"I don't understand the fuss about this place. I found the menu very limited. We ordered shrimp salad and it was full of shrimp skin. The shrimp was tempura and still had tail and some skin on! Our sandwiches were average. What really bothered me was the waiter pretty much redecorating the space by dragging chairs all around us. I'm a patient person but I finally had to let the hostess know and I guess the two of them found it funny! The door leading outside also kept opening as they kept bringing in more chairs from outside!"}
{"text":"Roberto our server was wonderful. He had great suggestions and took the time to answer any questions we had. We highly suggest you ask for him if you dine in.  The food was creative and love they use locally sourced organic produce for their dishes. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Ate there twice while visiting friends and both the service and the food was amazing. The fingerling potatoes at brunch were delicious as were my red velvet pancakes. The chicken BLT I had for lunch was just perfect!"}
{"text":"Great place. We came here as a 9 top and they were able to sit us after 30-45 minutes (reasonable for no reservation in Old town on a Saturday night).  It can get a little crowded in the bar area up front.    The decor of this place is trendy/classy.  Looks like they took a bunch of props from Anthropologie and threw them in the restaurant and somehow managed to pull of a great rustic yet elegant look.  Go see for yourself!  There was also a live act playing that night - everything from Clapton to Christmas music and while it was great, sometimes it was hard to hear/talk over the music.  Service was great as well - our waitress was able to get us out the door in an hour and a half and that was with check splitting and multiple recurring drink orders!  Now for the food... I was able to try the sliders, thai bbq ribs w/ mac n cheese, and the capicola ham flatbread.  All of it was delicious.  The meat just falls right off the bone on the ribs, and the sauce was fantastic.  Most things are in the 16 - 30 price range.    A+!"}
{"text":"Great food: The vegetarian tacos and korean cauliflower fries were amazing.  Great service   Good ambience and live music"}
{"text":"Great food!  Service was excellent as well even despite the fact that my waiter was blatantly on his first day--lol many times coming back to do things he could've done on his first visit because he forgot.   I ordered the cilantro-crab dip with plantain chips to start. I should've been less greedy as the menu clearly stated apps to SHARE. Nonetheless, it was delicious with lumps of crab swirled in throughout. Definitely recommend!  My main was the goat cheese? And capicola (sp) flatbread topped with crispy kale. My kale was burnt beyond recognition but I just threw it to the side a munched away. Very crunchy flatbread, which is a must, and great ingredients. WAs really tasty!    Would definitely eat here again if I were visiting again. Would love to try brunch."}
{"text":"Fantastic place for lunch - The food here is ultra-fresh (a lot of it is local too). The menu is fun and original. I LOVED the fried edamame (rice oil). The turkey wrap had a pile of fresh roasted turkey which was tender and juicy."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch the other day and was impressed. This place is expensive, and the menu and design look like this place was meant to cater to upscale scottsdale women who don't work and have the time and money to shop all day and eat at places like this. The clientle also reflected this. Given this fact, I assumed that the portions would be small, unfilling and overpriced. I was wrong. Everything was delicious even the sweet potato chips which I normally don't like. Good burgers, salads and tacos. I need to come back for the even pricier dinnner menu one time."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise it was to have lunch at the Herb Box.  My partner and I wanted to try something new last weekend and headed over to DC Ranch. I'd heard of the Herb Box and read some good reviews so we decided to try it. Upon entering the restaurant I was having second thoughts, it was a little upscale for what we were looking for and it \"looked\" like the type of place where you wouldn't get much food, but the bill would be huge. Goes to show you shouldn't judge a book by it's cover.  We both ordered sandwiches which come with some of the best sweet potato chips I've ever had. My sandwich was a chicken, pesto, goat cheese combo that was out of this world. We both stuck with Ice Tea which was brewed to perfection.   Yes, it was a little pricey for lunch, but the food was great."}
{"text":"I stumbled into this place while waiting for another local restaurant to open for breakfast.  Me and a friend sat at the bar for a quick mimosa and bloody mary.  The bartender was trying to get us to stay but after one look at the menu we promised we would be back the next weekend!  I think I have found my new favorite brunch location.  Their Sunday Brunch special is the best in town.  An entree, a little crustini, and all the bloody marys/mimosas you can drink....great deal!!!  RED VELVET PANCAKES....Amazing!  These were the best pancakes I've had in a long time.  These cakes are topped with marscarpone creme and a side of bacon is a great breakfast combo!  A friend tried the Chilequiles.  This is the prefect combination of shredded pork, eggs, and chili....yum!  The Breakfast Steak and Eggs were another great treat.  The fingerling potatoes were a great side.    I highly recommend a Sunday stop at the Herb Box.  Its a great local place on the Waterfront and be a great place for Sunday Funday!"}
{"text":"Knowing I was going to be in Scottsdale today around lunch . . . I decided to find something different for lunch . . . and The Herb Box looked like it would . . . and it did not disappoint.  We first ordered our drinks and the Crisp Falafel Bites . . . they were to die for . . . crisp and warm . . . with herb roasted tomatoes and a variety of olives . . . to be honest . . . I could have eaten the whole order myself . . . and the passion fruit black iced tea . . . clear crisp and cold . . . the perfect pair.  For my entrée . . . the butternut squash corn enchiladas . . . it came with a roasted tomato verde salad . . . which perfectly offset the richness of the enchiladas.  They were warm and the corn mixed with the butternut squash wrapped in a corn tortilla . . . was so rich and creamy and delightfully packed with flavors.  The atmosphere was relaxing . . . so much so . . . that I almost forgot that it was a work day . . . I will definitely be back . . . and I might even surprise my wife, and bring her back here for dinner."}
{"text":"I'm vegan, and my family is decidedly NOT (one family member notoriously announced a sincere need for \"real food\" at a vegan-friendly establishment we once dined at together).  However, the Herb Box married herbivore and omnivore seamlessly, and everyone enjoyed their meals.  My husband and mother-in-law both had Thai ribs with smoked Gouda macaroni and cheese. My father-in-law had a ribeye, which was appropriately cooked to medium-rare.  Both of those dishes received rave reviews from the omnivores.   I had wanted to try the vegan enchiladas, but they contain mushrooms, and I'm allergic, so I used my momentary disappointment as justification to order the entire Vegan Nosh menu. It didn't disappoint.   Oh, our drinks were also awesome. We tried the ginger pear martini, rosemary mojito, and mango whiskey lemonade.   The Herb Box does it right, with attentive service, fantastic setting, and great food."}
{"text":"I love the Herb Box on 7th street- for both dine in and take out.  I'm obsessed... literally obsessed with their Brussel sprout chips. A weekly obsession.   Pankora (kale, onion, corn) is also a delightful appetizer- and on a rainy cold winter day- their baked macaroni cheese stands out as one of the top Mac and cheese dishes in Phoenix.  For dinner: their grapefruit glazed salmon is lovely and their butternut squash enchilada's have been endlessly reviewed and raved about.  Highly recommend you give the Herb Box love- I would love to keep them in north central Phoenix."}
{"text":"A third day, a third bakery, but this time the goods actually made it back to the hotel and served as breakfast on the day of my departure...well, okay, I had to try a bite of each while they were fresh but I promise the rest made it through both refrigeration and rewarming without further consumption until the next day.  For my third and last pastry stop on this tour of the Valley I just so happened to be wandering the Scottsdale Fashion Square before lunch at Cowboy Ciao and opted to stop into The Herb Box based on the recommendation of a friend.  First approaching the upstairs restaurant, at this point thriving with Saturday brunchers, the space is admittedly gorgeous looking out on the river and after browsing the menu (note to self, red velvet pancakes and a divine sounding BLT with ricotta) I subsequently made my way down to the basement bakery, café, coffee shop, and wine store.  Greeted on entering by a young lady behind the counter who asked if she could get a beverage ready for me while I waited I agreed to a large iced coffee while I weighed my options; a bevy  of muffins, scones, pastries, and desserts totaling at least forty - some standard and some entirely unique but all but a few desirable.  Deciding once again to choose one for myself and to rely on my server for the second choice my options were boxed, then bagged, and paying the $13 tab with tax and tip I made my way back to the street.  Beginning first with my selection, a tossup between the Red Velvet Cake and Bread Pudding, the pudding always wins and in this case my selection of Vanilla Bean Bread Pudding with Peach and Peaches n' Cream Glaze would prove to be the best bread pudding of the trip not only in its present cool state, but even more so the following day after reheating.  Dense and packed with notes of cinnamon, nutmeg, and most of all vanilla juxtaposing studs of sliced peaches this \"pudding\" was nearly cakelike in its texture and when topped with the glaze - a dense anglaise with more cinnamon and the fructose sweetness of peaches serving as top notes - it was simply outstanding.  Moving next to my server's suggestion, another dish billed as \"best thing ever,\" this is one circumstance where I can actually say that at that very moment I felt like she may have been right because as good as my Bread Pudding had been, the adult Ding Dong was all the better.  Beginning first with a dense chocolate cake made with dark Dutch processed cocoa, the base of this dessert was clearly sour cream based and all the better for it as the slight flavors melded perfectly.  Moving next to the \"cream filling\" in this case replaced with a nearly liquid white chocolate marshmallow cream the sweetness was a perfect balance to the cake while the entirety of the dessert was encased in a dense dark chocolate shell flecked with blue edible glitter.  A masterpiece both visually, texturally, and in terms of flavor I'd not hesitate to call this one of the best \"upscale\" takes on American Retail comfort food I've ever had (notwithstanding Cathal Armstrong's Foie Gras Twinkie, of course.)  Doing my best to restrain myself from eating the entirety of both before the following day while carrying the bag from store to store in order to prevent melting in the hot Arizona Sun all I know now is that my next visit to Phoenix/Scottsdale will see me with breakfast or brunch at The Herb Box and desserts from the café below (that may or may not make it out the door, but certainly not to the following day.)"}
{"text":"We stumbled upon The Herb Box while walking around in old town, the patio space looked amazing and the menu was good so we stopped in. It was about 7:30 on a Saturday but they sat us right away. Off the bat it seemed like we were in for a great night, but once seated the night took a turn.  First, we waited for at least 15 minutes for our waiter to even come over and take our drink order. It was clear he was overwhelmed because he asked to take our drink and food order at the same time. Not my favorite way to start what is suppose to be a romantic dinner. It took another 10 or 15 minutes to get the drinks we ordered and then we didn't see our sever again until half an hour after that when we got our food. It seemed like an exceptionally long wait to not be offered another drink. The my food was delicious, I had the enchiladas the large salad that came on the side was a great compliment. My husband had the ribeye, he ordered it medium rare and it came out pretty much bloody, it took the waiter about 10 minutes to come back and check in us, at that point my husband sent the steak back in to the grill. The server was really kind about this but then brought the steak back without a fork to eat it with, having learned by this point, I asked for a fork before he left our table and it still took 5 minutes to get it.  Toward the end of the night our server chatted us up about beer and pot and chochella. We were down to talk, but him steering the convo toward pot because we are from CO was slightly unprofessional.  Overall it seems like this place could be great if they polished the customer service and the attention to detail. I get that you are busy but as a customer I never want to feel your stress."}
{"text":"Noooo!!!  What happened?  We sat down for lunch and the place wasn't packed at all.  It took almost twenty minutes for anyone to come by!  They also didn't bring out waters until after our appetizers had come out.  What a bummer because I do think the food is good.  The chilled crab dip, burger and short rib tacos were all delicious."}
{"text":"We had the PERFECT Sunday brunch here. Beautiful outside patio + great weather + no wait = I liked this place within the first 3 minutes of arriving. And the food? The red velvet pancakes were magical- why hasn't anybody every thought of this fantastic idea before? Fluffy, sweet (but not overwhelming) and the perfect serving size- the lemon buttery syrup it comes with just makes them melt in your mouth.   The biggest surprise with how reasonable the prices were for North Scottsdale- 2 entrees + mimosas for right around $30.   Great job Herb Box! We're looking forward to checking out your Old Town location."}
{"text":"The food was exceptionally good.  The service was exceptionally bad.  My wife and I have gone here three times and the service is always atrocious, so be prepared.  But we think that its worth it, cause our food is always excellent."}
{"text":"It was quite refreshing to walk into the Herb Box and not have to wait to be seated for an hour in old town Scottdale on a Sunday.  The ambiance is one thay feels fancy but yet its like the comfort of your home.  The service received was exceptional, not only did the waitress knowledgable about the menu items she was able to make a recommendation so that I could try both of the items that I was debating.  Our water glasses were never empty. There was just the right amount of checking to ensure our meal was going well without being too intrusive.  The food was more than what was expected.  Having heard great reviews from friends, I was not disappointed.  I tried the pork green chili dish. And I have to say that it actually has become my new favorite, which given its comparison is a huge compliment. I also got to sample the red velvet pancakes with both regular syrup and their special blend.  Wile being delicious by themselves they were phenomenal with the special blend syrup. Adding mango to the traditional orange juice mimosa was very tasty and was a fabulous compliment to the brunch."}
{"text":"Another delightful meal this evening. This was a great lead into the festivities for tomorrow night.   The quality of service and food is always consistent and wonderful.   See you next year guys :)"}
{"text":"We had catered, Good! Not only was the sandwich great, we got desert to and it was amazing! Totally loved!"}
{"text":"I  am blown away with the unique and explosive flavor of the food here. I can't wait to go back. We had the avocado love, smoked salmon BLT and butternut squash enchiladas. Five star in every way! Also, our server Sarah was great!"}
{"text":"Went for brunch.  BLT is insane.  The simple good egg breakfast...excellent.  The coffee is worth the trip alone.  It's roasted in Cave Creek and is tasty.  Lots of outdoor seats.  Give it a shot."}
{"text":"Very interesting mix of ingredients.   The menu is quite interesting.   I went with a friend after a hike.  I was expecting bland, and this was nothing like that.  The mingling of flavors was perfect.  Unusual combinations.  We each had a bowl, and tasted both.  The crispy Brussels sprouts are delicious and I want to figure out how to make these!  We dined mid afternoon, so there were only a few other tables occupied.  Love the detail in the decor.  Will have to come back in an evening to check out the lovely lighting."}
{"text":"The menu looked great and the ambiance was nice, but food was subpar for $20 entrees.  I tried the trout, which came with corn and leek gratin and a beet/bean salad.  The trout itself was fine, the pesto didn't add much for me.  The corn gratin was disappointing, bland, and mushy.  It came out very cold in the middle so I had to send it back.    Husband had the rib entree.  They were fine, slathered with a spicy BBQ sauce.    The waiter forgot to place order for our appetizer, but was very apologetic and took it off the bill.  The -2 stars is for the quality of food only. The waiter handled his mistake well."}
{"text":"It's gone downhill. And I am so sad to report it. This use to be my go-to when I was in Old Town it had people in town.   Service was good (and some of the cocktails) which is why I gave two stars. The food was boarder line inedible. Mac and cheese sides were ice cold, ribs were tough. Baha shrimp was far too spicy for very spice tolerant people, my lentil meatballs tasted like an entire salt shaker dumped on it -- and I love salt! The butternut squash enchiladas were blah...and those used to be my favorite. It seemed as though the kitchen is taste deficient, because nothing tasted right.  The only ok part of the meal was the Korean cauliflower and the Brussels sprout chips.   I sadly won't be back...looking for a new Scottsdale staple in the area."}
{"text":"Meh the service was pretty good and the food was well decent but I wasn't overly impressed. The enchiladas were overcooked Luke warm the salad was okay not amazing though."}
{"text":"Went here with a friend the other night and our food was excellent!  However, the service was the worst I've had in a long time.  The waiter took 20 minutes to bring us water and take our order.  The manager came over to fill both of our water AND wine glasses that had run dry because the service sucked so bad.  When we mentioned how we had been abandoned, she offered to take our order which turned out to be the wrong food being brought out. And our original waiter came over to apologize for his service being so bad because he had \"big parties to wait on.\"  As if our little table of two was not important."}
{"text":"This won't be closed for much longer! My friends are buying it right now! I too, miss the great food! So unique!"}
{"text":"I was there last night and a gentleman at a 2 top was very upset with the staff because a table of 14 women was too loud ( REALLY C'MON).  The staff tried to do everything to accommodate the 2, but he was still not happy.  The food is always excellent and the staff is superior.  Don't let one bad apple ruin a great place for dinner.  Bravo Bravo"}

{"text":"OoOoOoOh how I love the herb box & team :)  The menu is packed with amazing healthy dishes that include; huge market salads a mixture of medium rare steak with watercress, avocado, bacon and sweet dried corn with a tangy blue cheese vinaigrette.  There are shared plates, wraps, sandwiches, flat breads and The Herb Box's signature butternut squash corn enchiladas. Most meals can be ordered vegetarian or gluten free. One of my favorite sides is the to die for mac & cheese! It's a must! :) Also I recommend trying there new soup flavor each week! ($5cup | $7 bowl | $12 quart)  Parking is free underground. Everything on the menu is amazing, so don't worry it looks intimidating but you wont be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The Herb Box provided us one of the best restaurant experiences we've had in a very long time. The Herb Box on Pima in DC Market Ranch is really beautiful, warm and comfortable. It has a smaller deli kind of section, a larger dining room and outdoor patio area. We sat outside under the heaters and were treated to a great experience.   First, our waiter was really great. He had a great personality, was very attentive, and had lots of great recommendations for us. I started with a blackberry mojito- it had a very distinctive and strong flavor, but I liked it quite a bit. I am not a big fan of mint but found that the blackberry mellowed the mint. It went down easy!  Hubby got the steak and gorgonzola salad, and listened to him talk about how great it was with every bite! I also got to try the trout which was seasoned and cooked to perfection. I ordered some appetizers for my dinner including the brown sugar and jerk pulled pork sliders, cheesed stuffed fried olives and the falafel plate. I enjoyed all of it, seriously I ate until I couldn't anymore. The fried olive were frickin incredible, I've never had anything like them. The green olives were a bit tart and full of rich creamy cheese, and finished off with a light crunchy fried batter.   I am totally thrilled with this place, it is one of my new faves and will be added to the regular rotation."}
{"text":"I work down the street from the Herb Box and was working a triple (yes, three separate shifts back to back) and needed some healthy, filling food in between my last two shifts. When I called they sent me to the Market downstairs and the girl at the counter was SO helpful, sweet and even gave me a discount bec I work down the road. This company has by far the nicest restaurant staff I've encountered in Scottsdale. I came in COVERED in paint (I'm a painting teacher) with my apron still on and the girl at the counter was never once judgmental.  thank you Herb Box. The food never falters and your staff always surprise me with warm greeting smiles."}
{"text":"I dined here on Wednesday 3/26 with my mom and friend, and we had a wonderful experience. Our server, Karen, was kind and engaging and provided us with great suggestions, as this was our first time dining here. We started with the grape and brie crostini, which was absolutely delicious. I ordered the lentil ricotta meatballs, which came with spaghetti squash and a pesto sauce, my mom ordered the salmon, and my friend ordered the kobe beef burger. Everything seemed to be made with fresh ingredients and had a beautiful presentation, and tasted amazing. There are plenty of options for both people who like meat and those who are vegetarians. We couldn't decide on just one dessert, so we had both the bread pudding and the \"crack pie,\" and we could not even decide which we liked better. I can't wait to come back here when I come back to Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"The food we tried was really good -- we shared three appetizers.  One was some kind of cheesy corn au gratin thing...can't remember but it was amazing.  We had a flatbread little pizza thing that was pretty off the hook too.  And some Korean fried cauliflower.  Very good.  3 Friends:  2 cosmos 2 glasses of house wine 1 Bloody Mary 3 appetizers  Just barely under $100.   I thought it was a bit steep, but maybe I'm just old and out of touch?  My friends seemed a little shocked too though.   The waiter was a doll.  He took care of us and laughed at all of my stupid jokes -- and he managed to look like he wasn't annoyed by having to fake it.  Tip: $30.  I appreciate a man who can fake it well."}
{"text":"Just had brunch there today. First of all I have eaten at the location in DC a few times, food is excellent. So this time for my Mothers birthday we decided to try the Scottsdale one. First thing we asked our server \"are there any specials\" she said No, so we placed our orders & ordered a bottle of Prosecco as we all wanted a glass of champagne! She brought wine glasses, so we asked for champagne glasses, she said they were all out of them because of the Mimosa $5.00 brunch special? Um didn't we ask if they had any specials?? So We did try to talk to her about this & she said it wouldn't have made a difference as they were out of champagne? Well, we then see people served MIMOSAS. No apologies, were made to us. Service was not good."}
{"text":"The Vegan Nosh Board and Avocado Love appetizer are both delicious! The Nosh Board changes with seasons, which is cool and makes sense. I believe they try to use fresh, local produce whenever possible in their dishes. The sangria is amazing-the apricot brandy and dash of cinnamon was genius! Great ambiance and service has always been outstanding."}
{"text":"The Herb Box off of Shea Blvd in Scottsdale never dissapoints.  Where as I am told the staff up at the DC Ranch venue are a bit green and wet behind the ears, the staff at Shea are AND have always been on their \"A\" games.  The food (i typicaly get a chicken sage pesto sandwich or the steak sandwich) is also great.  I agree with my girl friend regarding the SWEET POTATO CHIPS.   They are awesome.  A friend of mine over dinner the other night (completely different restaurant) explained to me a great way to review any eating establishment.  There is an unwritten agreement between Restaurant and patron.  It says, the establishment agrees to provide reasonable service, reasonable atmosphere, and reasonable food.  In return, the patron agress to pay the bill and tip.  of course if the ambiance, food and service are beyond just reasonable, the hope is that the patron will return.  In this here case of the HERB BOX, I continue to return and i am ALWAYS greeted by a  friendly staff.  Most of the girls i recognize as having been there f0r quite some time.  Which to me, also says alot about the establishment, and it's owners.  Can't wait to stop by again for lunch...."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of The Herb Box. I realize I'd been there once before and really enjoyed it then as well.  Today the family came by to meet for lunch and I happened to have an email in my inbox with the new lunch menu at Shea. Talk about good timing. I'm trying to be a bit better at eating healthy and looking at the menu, there seemed to be a number of selections that would let me do that & still enjoy the food.  From looking at the menu, it was nice to see that they buy local where possible and are part of the Slow Food movement.  We started with the housemade sweet potato chips with sea salt and curry. These are ridiculously addictive. My 2  year old kept telling us \"don't eat them all\" and putting her hand over the basket. We all couldn't stop. While they might not really be, they even seemed healthy-ish (for chips anyway). I'd love to see if they had an extra curry version.  For lunch, we ordered the market sunflower salad (with chicken, bacon, goat cheese, dried berries, sunflower seeds & balsamic vinaigrette), the blackened chicken caesar salad (with crisp romaine, cotija cheese, tortilla strips and a chipotle-parmesan caesar dressing), and the kids split the brown sugar pork sandwich (with watercress-jicama slaw).  As our little ones have dairy and egg allergies, they were great about working around that and giving us suggestions. They were super nice with the kids too.  The food was excellent all the way around. I'm not by nature a big salad guy but I went that way as I'm trying to lay off the carbs a bit. I really liked both and will be eager to order either of them again.   I'm also eager to try some of the more carb-y items on the menu when I can. They had a couple of soups that sounded wonderful.   The service was great. Our server was quite knowledgeable, super personable and very engaging. He also put up with our 2 girls flirting with him non-stop.  As far as drinks, we did green tea and blackberry jasimine tea. Both were quite nice.  As I'm committed to staying on this healthy train, I think there will be many, many more visits to The Herb Box in my future. At present, I'm hard pressed to think a better healthy/tasty lunch option."}
{"text":"Had a very  bad experience here.  First off, many of the photos posted on Yelp don't actually exist on the menu. They are from some catering company which you will not be able to order from.  We ended up getting a wrap, Thai ribs and  a chicken salad.  The food was all tasteless and bland. I wanted to ask for my money back and walk out. However the group that I was with felt very awkward doing that but they agreed.   I will never be back to this place. Very disappointed in this place because I wanted to try for such a long time."}
{"text":"I don't understand it people I will pay the price just provide me with the portions and the taste that's all I ask.   I had a couple drinks appetizer, salad and a hair in my girlfriends sandwich.  This place claims to be American, that serves Mediterranean style dishes. Definitely not Mediterranean tried the Mezza sampler tasted like paste and chickpeas blended. Their organic salad was nothing special definitely way overpriced, lacking taste, for the price they better have used sea salt organic olive oil's and free range chicken that is non-GMO fed and I highly doubt they do that. Whatever, 72 dollors down the drain. On to the next place."}
{"text":"Not my favorite experience. The guy thought we wanted to split one burger on a six person company dinner party, uhm no, we wanted one meal each please, thanks. Then he never came back to refill our drinks, uhm, it's a holiday party. Three, he brought the check before asking if we wanted desert, uhm, still a holiday party. Four, we asked for coffee, it was lukewarm, and he didn't want \"to bother\" the other server refilling the sweetener holders, so let's bring it after everyone is done with dessert?  So considerate to your fellow worker, throw us under the bus instead.  Uggh. Not such a great impression for our company dinner. Maybe we go somewhere where the $300 plus bill actually gets you service on a very slow night for them."}
{"text":"Perfect light meal, accommodating to carnivores and veggies.  Excellent service on the patio - great place to dine 8 months a year.  Really nothing you can say wrong about the place.  Dessert menu looked incredible, perhaps a touch pricey.  4 visits here - all of great value and similar service."}
{"text":"Here's the honest to goodness truth:  Hit or miss.  I've been to both locations and each time, it hasn't been consistent.  One time it's good and the next...not so good.  Consider my score a 2.5 and I will go back, because I'm due for good experience.  Just to make my self clear, it's not the service.  The service has always been good and there's a gal there that's super sweet (she's at the N. scottsdale location).  I remember her, because she has a two year little girl, too."}
{"text":"The Herb Box always seemed like a place I should love, it had all the elements of a restaurant I'd love. I've been there for lunch a handful of times and it was always a nice lunch, but that was all it was... nice.   I recently came across their brunch menu and it looked so good I wanted to try again. I had brunch there Sunday and really enjoyed it. First, I've always liked the decor and atmosphere at the DC Ranch location. We sat outside cooled by their large umbrellas and misters.   We ordered the Strawberry Lassi: blended plain yogurt, fresh strawberries, and ice- not quite like the lassis I've had at Indian restaurants, but like a very good not-too-sweet smoothie.    Market Street BLT: Grilled bread with an over-easy egg (mine came out over medium, but I was fine with that), crisp pancetta (better than bacon in my opinion), arugula, and tomato. It was a very good sandwich.   Urban Market Steak Salad. Great steak and a good combo of salad toppings: red peppers, corn, avocado, candied pecans, and gorgonzola.   Some of the other brunch menu items looked great, so I think I'll be going back for breakfast/bruch with a new sense of appreciation for the Herb Box."}
{"text":"I went there for brunch with a friend around 1:30PM today. They said there would be a 25 minute wait and that they'd text me (which I love for these sorts of things) when our table was ready, so we decided to head to their downstairs cafe (same herb box) to grab some chai tea while we waited. The poor girl working downstairs had about 15 people in line, y'all really need to have more people down there! That said, she made my chai tea with coconut milk very well and it was about $5.50. Then we headed upstairs and I decided to order the avocado toast. I'm a picky eater so I'm just going to be honest and say that I REALLY did not like it at all, and for the price I was disappointed. It wasn't Herb's fault, I just should've looked closer to see that there was jalapeño and honey on top - they were so busy that I didn't want to ask them to remake it either. That said, for being very busy the same day as the PF Chang marathon, our server was very pleasant. My avo toast ended up being $12.50, which really made me wish I just popped into ChopShop but hey - at least I tried something new? I think I'd come back here for dinner again, but probably not brunch."}
{"text":"I had an \"herb box\" in college I remember. Kept it under my bed. Or in the back of the closet. Or in a shoe. Gee, that was some herb I can't even remember...  This Herb Box however, I shan't ever forget!!!  Butternut Squash Enchiladas. White Bean Chicken Chili. Crab Cilantro Dip. The Zucchini soup of the day...ALL...outstanding!!!  Now that I've moved back to DC Ranch I'm so glad to see the Herb Box and even more excited that this is my new \"Cheers\". Sorry Gallo Blanco, though I miss you madly...I've found another relationship. And no it's not complicated!  Quite simple in fact. Delicious, fresh ingredients. Delightful, warm staff and a cozy and bright spot on Market Street.  I've been here with family. With friends. And even a date. Herb Box, if I stick around AZ long enough, I just may ask you to marry me!  So step outside of your \"box\" and head to The Herb Box. But call me first and I will meet you there!!!"}
{"text":"Great break fast went there on a Saturday morning during breakfast I loved the salmon hash I ordered never had anything like it. Great dish very filling but not heavy. My girlfriend ordered the  Chilaquiles. Had alot of flavor very large dish there twist on this traditional dish is great. Definitely will come back when we're in Arizona again."}
{"text":"Delicious food and great service! The crispy Brussel sprouts are so wonderful. The BLT with chicken is one of my favorites and also the short rib enchiladas."}
{"text":"Holy moly.  This place is amazing.  The red velvet pancakes + bacon were mind blowingly delicious.  Plus, I was short on time and the staff was super accommodating.  I will definitely be back and will probably be a regular!"}
{"text":"Fresh food, excellent and unique flavors. Dishes are a bit small.. Excellent vegetarian options!"}
{"text":"Such a beautiful location!! Created our own cheese and meat board..,. Made for a great evening sitting outside enjoying the company of friends.., definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Fantastic! We went for Easter Brunch and could not be happier with the choice. Everything from the flavored cold water waiting at the hostess desk to the dessert was perfect. I was concerned initially when I read bad reviews on the service. One of the best waiters I have every had. Kendal! You were wonderful! My daughter is a waitress and she can be hard to please. She was very impressed. We started with the brussel sprout chips. They were good. I have to be gluten free so my options can be limited. These were a good choice. For our main courses we had the sweet potato bowl and the smoked salmon hash. We were both pleased. I have to admit it took a long time to decide because they had so many drool worthy options to choose from. I also had the melon mule. Very refreshing! Sit outside if you can. Great people watching and umbrellas shade you. Once again Kendal was great but so was everyone else. His is the only name we got. Go! Great service and great food!"}
{"text":"Best organic restaurant  in arizona. They had a fun live band when I went and the food was incredible."}
{"text":"I have gone here during peak times, and mid afternoon when it's dead. The service has been consistent and prompt. Servers are knowledgeable about menu items and ingredients. I wasn't super impressed with the margarita, but I'm not a big drinker so it takes a well crafted cocktail to get me pumped on a drink. Ive had the butternut squash enchiladas 4-5 times now and they blow my mind every single time. The smokiness of the pepitas with the tomatillo sauce is an amazing flavor combo. I end up scraping the plate clean every time. I've also had brunch items and theyve been just as fresh and delivious as the enchiladas. The location is perfect for walking around after your meal!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious, and we had good service. The only reason this place got 2 stars is because they were out of several items on the menu. On the weekend. This is ridiculous.  When we tried to talk to the general manager about it he got defensive instead of listening & using this input to improve.  Evidently managing a restaurant & customer service are not his forte."}
{"text":"There's a hair in my arugula. A long, straight hair. I know what you're thinking ... 'well, that's better than a short and curly hair.' Although true, I'm just not in need of the extra protein. Plenty of that provided by the grilled tenderloin sitting atop of said arugula and beside aforementioned hair.  I chose not to make a scene as the place - early afternoon on a Tuesday - was fairly full of fine female patrons. I removed the hair with surgical precision and proceeded to enjoy my lunch. And enjoy, I did.  I saw many many savory items on the menu, but I can only speak to the Arugula-Gorgonzola Steak. Tasty. Oh ... and the sweet potato chips were the truth as well. The place is kinda' unique in that it shares two different suites - a \"market\" on one side and an \"eatery\" on the other - joined by a breezeway in the middle. One could enjoy their meal, or a glass of wine outside if one so desired.   Four stars. I'm not deducting anything for the hair, but the 'Box is awfully proud of their prices and the service leaves much to be desired. I mean, the gal that occasionally tended to me was friendly ... just not necessarily well-versed in the art of prompt, accommodation of customer requests. Like the one I made for silverware and a napkin. Twice.   That said, the Herb Box was a cute little joint and I'm sure I'll be stopping in again for lunch when I find myself hocking fenestrations mid-day in north Scottsdale.   Next time I'll try a twelve-dollar sandwich. Brown Sugar Pork Ciabatta. Sans follicle, if I may."}
{"text":"If you can mentally stomach paying $19 for a 'Vegan Nosh' plate, by all means, go for it... you're a better (wealthier) (wo)man than I. The salmon plate was good, but again, not worthy of the cost, or a sexier adjective than simply \"good.\" In general, I don't think The Herb Box lives up to its prices.  However, it has a few exceptions. The falafel appetizer was absolutely magnificent. Who the hell uses  \"magnificent\" to describe a fried chickpea ball? Just try it, you'll understand. They also have $6 salads that are big enough to be a light meal. The one that caught my eye had avocado and candied pecans in it...  and bacon and blue cheese dressing. I swapped out the animal products for another salad's toppings: lemon poppy seed vinaigrette and dried corn. I would order that made up salad again in a heartbeat, and more importantly, I'd pay for it.  I'm still skeptical of the price tags, but after this visit, I must admit: my interest is piqued. Herb Box, I shall return. But not for dinner. Because I'm usually kind of broke.  Lunch or brunch. Probably lunch. Yeah. (I doubt MacArthur tacked on all those conditions when he said \"I shall return\".... but, oh well.)"}
{"text":"Consistent, high quality, wholesome food both at the restaurant and for catering."}
{"text":"So sad to change this review because we now live down the street and so wanted to love this place and frequent it but we have struck out the last 2 times we were here (both within a week of each other!) and struck out in a bad way. (Think insects and hairs )  So the reason for the 1 star instead of zero stars (even though that's not an option) is because the food does not taste bad. I will say this place has a LOT of work to do on the sanitation and the customer service though. A LOT. Last week when we were there, I ordered the steak salad, and I was quite enjoying it until a ladybug crawled out of it. It was shocking but even more shocking was Alex's response! He told me that \"it happens sometimes\" and there was no apology, just an offer to make me a new salad. I was seriously so grossed out. And BTW-I payed for that salad.   Then we were naive enough to try again tonight (was really hoping the bug and the customer service were a fluke.) I figured the salad was organic and at least it wasn't a roach and our options are limited in our neighborhood so why not give it another shot? BIG mistake.  Tonight my son and I both ordered the ribs. Mine were tasty but 2 bites in, my son pointed out a giant hair imbedded in his ribs. He pulled it out in what felt like slow motion. Sooo nasty. We politely let Nicole know about this (when she finally got around to checking on us) and she too wasn't phased (but did apologize) and she said she would let the manager know. (We even left the long hair on his plate for their viewing pleasure). When she came back, she nonchalantly told us that the manager was gracious enough to not bill us for the hairy ribs  However, the manager in both instances NEVER made contact with us which says a lot about this place and how much they value their customers .   I feel like we handled both situations very well. We even just ran it by a few neighbors and they all said they would have flipped out and not been as gracious as us.   Long story short, choices are limited in DC Ranch but we will NEVER be back and we will spread the word. I suggest Fleming's (fantastic Happy Hour), Living Room, Market Street Kitchen, Koi Poke Bowl or even Grimaldi's if you like to eat food without insects and hairs. (And even though I know this stuff happens on occasion, I would hope that these other establishments would not blow you off if your are served things that have no business being on your plate!!!)  Hope my review helps you to make a wise choice in the DC Ranch area!     Cute restaurant with a nice patio in DC Ranch on Market Street. We were here a few years back and we did not have good food or service but we decided to give it another shot. We been back twice in the last couple of months and it seems like they have improved their food and service. My husband and I both had the chicken avocado chop salad. We both thought it was very tasty and a nice portion.  Our waiter was very pleasant and attentive. The restaurant is definitely a bit pricey but aside from that, I would recommend giving it a try especially during the time of year where you can enjoy patio dining."}
{"text":"I'm so sad I didn't discover the Herb Box sooner. I went for a girl's lunch and was blown away - by the decor, the vibe, the view and the food - and this was during the winter. I can't wait for patio weather because this will become a weekend go-to spot for me. The salads and sandwiches are delicious and the fries and chips - holy moly! They're amazing and you'll get tons of them. The decor is perfectly shabby chic with a traditional twist and I could seriously move in.   If you and your mom and girlfriends love the quaint feel of Arcadia Farms, give Herb Box a whirl. It's got the same feel, but more modern. Love love love it."}
{"text":"I was a lucky girl the other night. Rico, B's husband has moved from Z Tejas to the Herb Box so I got to tag along to the \"practice night\", I'm sure there's technical term for if for those in the business but for me it meant free dinner at one of my favorite places.   First, the decor. You can't work in interior design for six years and not notice design. They've done it up in a cozy Cape Cod feel with exposed beams, wide plank floors, lots of blue and sea colors. Not so much you feel like you're in a sea food restaurant, but in a chic way. It has a little bit of a contemporary feel and the bathrooms are very cool. Check out the sinks. Go on. You need to go just for that.   B and I got there first, another friend was meeting us but was running a little late so we started with the cilantro crab dip, one of my favorites. There are nice, big chunks of crab in it and the plantain chips it comes with are thin, crisp and salty. For the main course B decided on the goat cheese chicken and enjoyed it. Our other friend got her old standby the Market Sunflower Salad and added salmon. I debated between the trout and the short ribs and ultimately decided on the short ribs but think next time I'll go with the trout. I have to say the short ribs were the second best I've had, in line right behind Chelsea's Kitchens. For dessert our waiter brought us a slice of the stout cake with espresso frosting, pure heaven, and a piece of the blackberry bread pudding. The bread pudding was more like a steamed dumpling and was lacking in flavor though the creme anglais it came with was creamy and unctuous. The espresso frosting on the cake reminded me of penuche candy.  I wasn't too excited to get a piece of cake but it really was a nice treat.  I just ate the frosting off the back I was so full by this time.   The Herb Box also has a beautiful patio with big windows opening to the bar and comfortable, intimate fireplaces. This is such a convenient location right in old town and steps away from the mall, I know it will become a regular place for me."}
{"text":"Every single thing that I put in my mouth was sublime.  No, seriously. Every single thing.  Is that not all you need to know? I'd stop reading here and just *go* already.  Still reading? Fine, it's my duty to back up such proclamations, isn't it.  Specifics:  First we have an *exquisite* lunch special. You won't hear me saying such things too often, as lunchtime for others is usually my breakfast time. When y'all are scarfing down soup and sandwiches, I'm on my second cup of coffee and a biscotti. But since the day I visited Herb Box it was, in fact, lunchtime, you can trust.  The special I chose (there are several) was the soup/salad/sandwich special, which varies from day to day I believe. On this day it was a potato leek soup, a grilled sandwich with gorgonzola and vegetables and a salad of fresh greens, candied pecans and gorgonzola.  My mouth dropped when it came out, for I expected a small offering of each, but received a large sandwich, a cup of soup and a generous salad.  Vegetarian options? You bet. Several. I wanted to sample things, so I opted for the triple threat plate. Otherwise, if you're looking for something on the lighter side, you cannot go wrong with one of the bountiful salads.  Speaking of healthy and light options, they have deep fried olives stuffed with bleu cheese. And amazing sweet potato chips (I'm not even a fan of sweet potatoes) Heh. Seriously, need I go on about the virtues of such things? Order a salad, splurge on an app. I do it all the time...  But I didn't do it on the day I lunched at Herb Box. Come on, I couldn't! Remember, I don't lunch very often. I tend to treat my work trips as mini vacations, so all intentions of eating light are out the window. And, and...fried olives! I don't even think Rachel Zoe is going to pass up a fried olive.  Herb Box boasts a glorious environs. You feel like you're sitting outside even when you're not. It made me forget, for a few moments, that it was January (perhaps I forgot until my plane landed in snow-ridden Kansas City). They've got the sophisticated, yet relaxed vibe going on, which I noticed is common in Scottsdale. I really love this.  So, I think Herb Box wins as one of the best lunches I've had. Ever! If all places were like this, I'd so be on my way to becoming a Lady Who Lunches instead of a lady who coffees."}
{"text":"I went for dinner on a Monday night, and the restaurant was dead! No sign yet out in fron so I don't think anyone would ever know that the herb box moved into the Estate House space.   Being that it was 40 degrees outside that night, my family and I were looking to quickly walk in from out of the cold and eat in a nice warm restaurant....that definitetly was NOT the experience we had!!!  We were the only table in there being served, and they had ALL the doors opened and it was BEYOND freezing!!!  Besides the cold atmosphere, the service was slow, and we were 1 one 2 tables in the restaurant, and the menu was disapointing for dinner.  I love the herb box as a place to lunch, but for dinner, this is not the place you want to be! VERY disapointing!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Crispy Brussels Sprouts Chips, Crisp Fried Edamame, and the Kale, Corn, &  Sweet Onion Pakora appetizer dishes.  They sound amazing, but fell short in the wow factors.  The Brussels Sprouts Chips are just that... Chips.  So if you're wanting or expecting a roasted Brussels Sprouts dish, you'll be disappointed.  The vegan aioli sauce that came with it was good, but the dish was too greasy for me.  I guess I just prefer a full crispy sprout.  The Crisp Fried Edamame dish was pretty tasty. It had a good amount of salt, but they weren't crispy, as the name suggests.   I was particularly excited about the Kale, Corn, and Sweet Onion Pakora dish.  The flavor was pretty good, but it was missing something.  I think with a different sauce it'd be a better dish.  I do wish they had more vegan main entree options."}
{"text":"I want to love this place... I love the concept, I love the ingredients, I love the flavors. However, I'm not as much of a fan as I'd like to be.   Was meeting a foodie friend to try Herb Box out for dinner and the hostess seated me at a table smack dab in the center of the room by myself. She then set down a clipboard with several pages and a pencil, and stacked even more pages on top of that; no explanation and no courtesy. My friend showed up and asked \"so what looks good?\". I gave her a perplexed look in return and said \"god knows, I'm not even sure what part of this is the menu!\" We funneled through the pages to find the clipboard was 2-3 pages of fromage and charcuterie that I can only guess you were supposed to check off what you wanted? Over both our heads. Then we found a wine list... but wait, there was another page buried in the stack that said wine list with some of the same wines and some different? Then we look over a very tempting prix fixe page that had maybe 5 options but decided we weren't sold on all courses in any of the offerings. And FINALLY, a menu... wouldn't you know it as soon as we found the menu the waitress came around wanting to take our order.  The menu all sounded delicious and we pondered for a very long time. We were also approached by a woman from the market with a cheese platter to try some of their gourmet fromage (we can only assume this was an attempt to encourage to order something off the clipboard, but I wasn't going to push my luck after finally understanding the menu!), the rosemary cheddar was PACKED with flavor. We got the cilantro-lime crab dip which was nothing like I expected (runny), but very tasty. The super-thin and crispy plantain chips it came with were VERY impressive and light in flavor.  I ordered the open-faced kobe burger that, again, had a ton of flavor. I had ordered it medium rare and it came quite charred on the outside, but I can't mark that against them as I didn't give them the opportunity to correct (meat is meat, I'm not picky enough to return a kobe burger). It was a strange combo on the plate, though... between the feta on the burger patty, the lack of a bun (some toast pieces on the side), the scoop of hummus under the patty, and a scoop of artichoke cous-cous on the other side, I had no idea how I was supposed to eat the damn thing. The bill was also quite steep.  Let me repeat, the flavors were terrific! The ingredients were fresh and fun! The market was cute and cool! And I will go there again to try something else and get a bag of those plantain chips from the market. It just reminded me of those high school kids that always had the perfect clothes and cool cars, but just never really found their groove... I walked out of there saying \"they're trying too hard.\""}
{"text":"After trying the DC Ranch location for dinner, my co-workers were ticked I hadn't invited them along. To make amends, I offered to pick up lunch from the Shea location. Anne ordered the Ahi sandwich special, blackened with a TON of seasoning... she absolutely loved it. I ordered the Smoked Turkey chiabatta that had a great smokey flavor between the turkey and the bacon, but was lacking much of the red-pepper aoli and completely missing the gouda that read on the menu. We were disappointed that the plantain chips promised with the special turned out to be sweet-potato chips, but they were tasty all the same.   Poor Sonya ordered the beef tacos that sounded wonderful, but came to fruition as 2 bite-sized soft tacos with no side. And I quote \"for 14 bucks, you'd think they could throw in a cup of beans or something!\" I had to agree, and gave her my sweet-potato chips. I think we all finished a little unsatisfied. Just as with the other location, all-in-all it's great flavors and good ingredients, but trying way too hard (and charging for it)!"}
{"text":"Lovely setting and good food. Mango lemonade is to die for....service is a little slow for lunch time but I enjoy eating here!"}
{"text":"The Herb Box is darling!  With a fantastic location canal-side, it's both romantic and quaint. It's a wonderful spot for brunch, lunch, and a romantic dinner date.   We came with a group of 12 and were seated quickly. The waitress was super attentive and kind and very knowledgeable about the menu - how refreshing!  She recommended a few house favorites including the Butternut Squash & Corn Enchiladas.   I was sold.   Completely Gluten Free, this entree comprised of kale, arugula, avocado, edamame, corn, pickled red onion, pepitas (candied pumpkin seeds) and cheese was a complete winner. SO MUCH FLAVOR! I couldn't believe I was eating something both vegetarian AND Gluten Free. Absolutely try this dish if you're game!   The selection of ice tea was also nice - the blackberry green tea was super refreshing. She even offered us to-go cups after our meal!  I'd definitely make it a point to return to the Herb Box.   PS - Their bathroom is ultra cool!"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite restaurant in Old Town: great environment and great food. I highly recommend the Thai ribs with gouda mac n' cheese--oh yes, you heard me right. Gouda mac n' cheese. All dishes are full of flavor, and I really like that they work to source from local and sustainable suppliers.  A bit on the pricey side, so make sure you do it right."}
{"text":"Love the pesto chicken sandwich and the short rib tacos. Salads are always fresh and the sweet potato chips crisp. Nice selection of fun cocktails. Service is usually very good. Stunning patio when the weather is mild.  Husband loves the Siracha  fried chicken that makes an occasional appearance on the menu. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I first walked in the door and was confused, apparently there's a bakery and then the restaurant is above. Met a friend for lunch there and we split the Chicken Arugula wrap. It was delicious as were the sweet potato chips it came with.  My lunch companion asked about nutrition information and the waitress went to ask someone but nobody could answer the question unfortunately."}
{"text":"So good. Everything about it from the decor and ambiance to the food and drinks. Definitely recommend for brunch. My friends and I shared the \"Avocado Love\" to start and had mango mimosas. Delicious. I had the red velvet pancakes and my friend had the French toast. Everything was so good and the service was excellent. I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"I love the food here but the service leaves a bit to be desired. Each time I'm there I find myself looking for my waitress.  My last visit I waited 20 minutes and had to find the manager to get a server to come to our table and the restaurant was busy but not to the point that my party could be easily overlooked. In the managements defense they did do their best to make the situation right and I appreciated the effort. Bottom line is  this place has great food but slow  service."}
{"text":"Cute little place with eclectic decor and a nice patio. The chicken pesto sandwich is so so good. You'll find lots of flavorful fresh ingredients here. The sweet potato chips are also good but wish they'd been served hot. Also they offered us a to-go cup for iced tea/lemonade which was appreciated.  Sunday Brunch has a great little assortment of dishes to fit both the breakfast or lunch crowd. Be sure you don't miss $5 glasses of prosecco ;)"}
{"text":"Normally the food and wait staff are on point. This morning not so much. Our waiter was barely around and the food was average. Bacon was very greasy and the smoked salmon hash was cold. Just hoping it was an off day."}
{"text":"Both service and food gets a B in my book   The food was good but honestly nothing out of this world. I had the beet and goat cheese salad and my father had the short ribs.   It took someone 10 minutes from when we were seated by the hostess to ask us what we wanted to drink. Throughout dinner I saw the same thing happen to two other tables and one for up and left."}
{"text":"This venue is so incredibly cute, especially at night! Its right next to the Grayhawk golf course and has quite the \"upscale\" feel to it, even though it is a smaller location and very affordable.  This is the perfect place for date night, yet, if youre coming in on the weekend, I would suggest making a reservation.   I like the menu style with the \"farm to table\" feel. The menu has a \"healthier\" look to it, but you dont sacrifice flavor thats forsure. When I went... I ordered the  Smoked Gouda Mac and cheese with garlic breadcrumbs...(NEED I SAY MORE!?) and Thai style ribs that just fell off the bone. These really were the best ribs I've ever had, with a different flavor which was refreshing. I've had good BBQ ribs before, but this was a whole different twist. I would definitely recommend it.   They have an outdoor patio and sometimes play live acoustic music... not quite sure when though, I forgot which weekdays.   I've only been here for the dinners, but I would love to come back for their breakfast... also heard they have an amazing brunch on sundays."}
{"text":"Go here for food, not for the service.   3 stars as a result.  Maybe I just happened to have a server (Samantha) who was having an off day, but the service was non-existent. I arrived at 2:35pm on a Sunday and waited ten minutes to be seated. No, not because there was a line but because the hostess was not up front. I received a menu and ordered a glass of wine. When Samatha returned with the wine I was informed, and I quote,\" You know we close in 5 minutes, right?\"   This was somewhat confusing as the brunch menu clearly stated 9am-4pm. Anyway, I quickly made a selection and off she went. My food arrived in quick fashion and was better than I ever imagined eggs, arugula and bacon could taste on toasted white bread.   Had I been asked I would have been interested in enjoying another glass of the riesling. That, or a first glass of water, but as there was no one to ask I finished my food sans beverage. After reading through a chunk of a guidebook I got tired of waiting so I ventured inside. While inside I decided to stop at the restroom. I waited a few minutes for a powder room to open up. When I came out Samantha was outside waiting with my check. Funny how that works.   Disappointing as the venue is in a wonderful location and the food is stellar."}
{"text":"Food tastes great! Fresh and well seasoned. We had the sweet potatoes tacos and enchilada with salad. A+ but IMHO priced about $5 more than they should be. Two small tacos and a teeny side of black beans for $15. A bit pricey!"}
{"text":"I have nothing but wonderful things to say. The food was absolutely amazing, service was impeccable. We had a nice view of the canal. This is by far my favorite new place to eat since moving to AZ. We will definitely be back. Thank you Madalyn for the wonderful service and wonderful dessert suggestion"}
{"text":"I've been coming to Herb Box for years, but my last dinner there was a horrible experience. I arrived a few minutes before the rest of our party of 7, checked in with the hostess but decided to wait while the rest of the party arrived. We had requested the patio, and even spoken to the restaurant during the day to confirm, since it was a nice night and we were celebrating a birthday. Another party of 7 arrived shortly after me and complained that they weren't on the patio. Once more of my party showed up, we decided to be seated and what do you know, we've been seated inside and the other party was seated outside. It was incredibly rude, but we decided to go with the flow and make the best of it.  Once seated, it was immediately evident the service would be poor. We ordered a bottle of wine that took 15-20 minutes to receive. The server poured a sip to taste and then walked away before my friend could give him the \"tastes great\" nod. When he returned a few minutes later it was as if he wasn't going to pour the rest of our table a glass of wine until we passed our glasses down to him. After we finished the first, we ordered another which took another 15 minutes before we received a single glass. We corrected the order, but then again it took far too long to receive the bottle.   Throughout the 2 1/2 hour dinner, service was slow, the restaurant was out of 3 different things we wanted, plates were not cleared, and 3 empty wine bottles sat on our table at the end of the night. When we received our check, the table was still not cleared. Inside, there were at least 5 empty tables throughout the time we were there so it's not as if it was just a busy night. For a restaurant like this one, I would expect much better service. When this was all mentioned to the manager, she was only slightly apologetic, but took off 3 appetizers.   The whole night left such a bad taste in my mouth that it's unlikely I'll return. I was chatting with my sister after the dinner, and she mentioned having a similar experience the last time she was there. Such a bummer to hear!"}
{"text":"I've been going here long enough to have ordered most things on their menu. Other than a couple items in the soup or salad category pretty much all of their appetizers and main dishes are swimming in oil. Their Brussels sprouts chips, Korean cauliflower, and even their edamame are deep fried. I ordered their trout and it was completely drowning in a pool of oil. So, sadly, we have to stop going until they clean up their menu and realize that food doesn't have to be greasy to taste good."}
{"text":"The service was painstakingly slow. Seriously, everything happened at a snail's pace: getting drinks, taking the order, getting our food, and then the checkout process (where our group was pressured not to split the bill at the threat of making what should have been a quick lunch even longer).  The food was okay. I would say the best item was the mac & cheese. I had the turkey + manchego sandwich which was a whole lot of bread and not a lot of flavor. My counterparts who had the chicken sandwich also complained that the bread to meat ratio was not ideal. The sweet potato chips that came with the meal were a bit tasteless as well.  It is unfortunate because the space is so beautiful. The food + service leave a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"Great location, great food, and nice ambiance.  The menu isn't huge, but this is a nice French cafe type setting if that's what you're into."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my experience here.  They have a great happy hour with fair prices and a  large outdoor patio.  I love that they have music on Friday and Saturday nights for free.  When we came it was a guy with an acoustic guitar.  He was really good.  Food was very tasty.  I love that they use local and organic as much as possible.  Also, they have gluten-free and vegetarian options which is nice.  Our service was good too.  It's a newer building and very clean and upscale inside.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't reviewed this place yet! I've been to this location of the herb box twice now, once for drinks/snacks and once for brunch. The brunch here is on the pricier side, but the food is tasty and the portions are large. I had the chilaquiles, which were rich and flavorful. The chips in the bowl stayed crispy as I ate the egg and pork. It was a solid breakfast option, though a little pricey at 13$.  The drinks here are incredible! I had their fig based drink, and it was one of the most delicious cocktails I have had in a long time. It was sweet without being too sweet. My friend got the 'woo woo' cocktail, which was also tasty. The drinks were fairly priced at 11$. I do wish they had a hh. While getting cocktails, we decided to try a side of their mac and cheese..... oh em gee. This may be the best mac and cheese in town. It was on the small side, but super rich. It was perfectly creamy with an amazing crunchy topping.... ridiculously delicious. Not badly priced at 8$. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went here today with my dad for lunch. The place is very cute and has good service. We sat on the patio and it was a nice day outside. We shared the steak sandwich and the corn and goat cheese flatbread. The sandwich was very good, the steak was tender and it had a lot of flavor. It came with some sweet potato chips that were ok, but not amazing. The flatbread was really tasty, it had corn, goat cheese, bacon, arugula, and red onion... it had tons of flavor. I felt like it was a bit overpriced with lunch costing about 30$, but I would come back again to try dinner or breakfast sometime."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try this place for months and I'm so glad that the temperature has finally dropped to less than 100 degrees so I could take advantage of the outdoor patio for lunch!   The service was kind of slow..not sure if it was on purpose so I won't knock any stars off for that cause the food was delicious! Got the chicken, goat cheese, bacon, apple, pesto foccacia and would def recommend it. Everything tasted really fresh! A perfect lunch spot :)"}
{"text":"The Herb Box has the perfect setting for a quaint little out to lunch atmosphere. Set in the heart of DC Ranch, the patio is perfect for a glass of wine and a salad at lunchtime, whether you're at the bar or seated under the shade of the umbrellas. This place is perfect for a couple's lunch as well as a great place to eat with the girls! The food is a variety of salads, wraps and flat bread pizzas that are all made with organic and locally grown foods, my favorite out of all being the Market Sunflower Salad, with goat cheese and chicken!   This place does tend to get a little crowded in the lunch rush, but there's always the option to order food to go in the market area. If you make it over to the market, there are a bunch of dessert made in-house, and the cupcakes are to die for!! Definitely something to check out.   They're also doing a new cheese board thing that I just tried, really fun and different!! You order cheese off a paper menu and they \"customize\" your cheese board for you. If you're going to try this, do the Barely Buzzed cheese, it has this lavender and coffee rind, it's my absolute favorite cheese!"}
{"text":"This was my favorite restaurant when I lived in Scottsdale! I've been many times and have loved everything I ever had there, but the pear and Gorgonzola flatbread was my favorite! I also loved the butternut squash enchiladas. All the appetizers are delicious-- especially the avocado toasts! This place has a very nice ambiance and nice, modern decor. It is sure to please both vegetarians and meat-eaters, alike! The food is high quality and generally much healthier than other restaurants. The service has always been great as well! Do yourself a favor and get to the restaurant ASAP!"}
{"text":"Fantastic place right on the canal. Perfect shaded patio with umbrellas and greenery everywhere you look. Service was good, food was amazing - (the pear Gorgonzola flatbread and Korean cauliflower are must tries -  skip the avocado love) phenomenal ambiance and decor. Make sure to check out the market downstairs before you leave and pick up a pastry or coffee before you tackle a waterfront stroll. This place really announces \"hey - I'm in Old Town - let's check out a segway tour.\" Can't wait to come back and try the sweet potato tacos."}
{"text":"Fantastic happy hour. Excellent selection of food and alcohol options. Lots of parking, great patio. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"My mom and I tried this place out for the first time and loved it! I drive by it every day on my way home from work and finally made it in the door. We went for lunch on a Saturday and they weren't too busy and we're able to seat us right away. I swear they have the friendliest staff in uptown. Everyone was smiling and genuinely seemed happy to be there. My mom got their turkey torta which was light and super flavorful (I had to try a bite of course). And I got the sweet potato avocado Baja bowel, the names mouthful and the dish was amazing. It had a little bit of everything and all the flavors complimented each other well. The portions were perfect not too small, not too big. Can't wait to go back and try more! Thanks herb box"}
{"text":"We actually started at another restaurant nearby but were surprised when they didn't offer brunch.  So we left and walked over to The Herb Box.  My friend had been there before and was happy to be back.. Apparently she doesn't make it to this area often enough, and it was my first time.  I absolutely love the decor!  It was like a little farmhouse and very shabby chic.  We were seated in the corner at a small table, which was fine.    I am not usually in to healthy breakfast options, and that is pretty much what is offered here.  However, I made do with the steak and eggs, which were delicious.  My friend had the salmon hash and loved it.  My only criticism is that the potatoes were not my favorite.  I would prefer regular hash browns or home fries.  The bloody mary was only meh.  It really didn't have any flavor, although I ordered it spicy.  It pretty much just tasted like watered down tomato juice, and it look at least 15 minutes to get.  Our server was very nice, and seemed to be training a newbie, but they were pretty slow.  Our food came out without a long delay though, so whatever.  I would definitely go back again, since it's a really cute little place and the food was pretty delicious.  It was fairly busy the day we went, so maybe on a slower day would be best."}
{"text":"I had a really good experience at this place.  Started with the chilled cilantro lime crab dip.  I wasn't sure about fried plantain dippers but they worked.  If you go here you have to get the Thai bbq baby back ribs.  They were awesome!  Next best thing I had was the mac & cheese and also the spinach & parsnip gratin - good stuff.  Ended with the guinness chocolate cake which was pretty good but next time I think I will go for the s'mores creme brulee.  All in all a good time and would recommend."}
{"text":"Outstanding lunch! Literally one of the best salads I have ever had. Serrano shrimp and avocado. Spicy. Sweet. Fresh and creative. Sat us next to a lovely little fire outside. Server was very attentive. We just may come back here!"}
{"text":"This is one of those meals that was made all the better by an incredible server. In our case his name was Andy and his personality, knowledge of the menu and dry wit kept our group entertained while we enjoyed their incredible dining options. Her Box management, take note: Andy is someone you're going to want to hold on to on your staff.   Beyond the friendly back-and-forth with the server, our meal was exquisite. I mulled over a couple menu items like the fried chicken but quickly decided that the filet mignon was what I needed. I couldn't have been happier with that decision after slicing off and biting into a piece of the tender,  melt-in-your-mouth meat. The seasoning was just amazing and almost worth making another trip to AZ for. I tried my friends Thai-style ribs and found them equally delicious. The two together made a heavenly sweet and savory combo.   The entrees weren't the only impressive edibles. The mac n' cheese, with a unique, herby creaminess and the signature cocktails were also winners in my book. I'd easily bring back a large party for another fantastic dinner. Especially if Andy entertains!"}
{"text":"I would come to Herb Box again for decent (but not memorable), somewhat healthy farm to table fare, but I would get it to go next time. When we came for dinner, service was incredibly slow and our server seemed incredibly scattered and flustered. It may have been an off night for him, but we have had similarly slow dinner experiences here and I don't think the food justifies such a long wait.  As for the food, the edamame hummus and Korean fried cauliflower are pretty good. We also liked the short rib enchiladas, but probably would not get the trout again.  It was also odd to me that while they have vegetarian and gluten free options, salad was pretty much the only vegan AND gluten free entree type option on the dinner menu one night, which made it tough for one person in the party - just something to be aware of if you have multiple dietary restrictions."}
{"text":"We are visiting from the NYC area. All I can say is this place is great. Butternut Squash enchiladas, Beef Tenderloin, Salmon, Thai ribs, BBQ cauliflower. It was all delicious. Adding to a great time was our waiter Andy who knows the menu inside and out, made great recommendations and is both smart and funny. A great combination. Thank you Andy for making our dining experience so pleasurable."}
{"text":"I just went for the 1st time and was literally blown away! Every item I tried was better than the last. It literally was a food orgasm! It is healthy, delicious food that leaves you completely satisfied. I can't believe it wasn't busier in there. I hope people give it a try because it is worth it."}
{"text":"I'm updating my previous review, which was only one star. The lesson from that one is if you want food from the restaurant, don't order from the market or you'll be waiting all day.   The restaurant itself is nice and they have a small patio that's pleasant this time of year. I had the chicken-avocado chopped salad. The flavors were nice, but there weren't enough of them. The chicken had a bit of spice and was quite good. There was also supposed to be corn, cheese and bacon, though, and there was hardly any of that. The salad was mostly just lettuce. Overall I am just not impressed with this place and with so many other options close by I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Just found out from a friend that you closed your Colony location this week (and since you already shut down that page, I'm posting this here). I have a reservation for a party of 14 for May 7 ... and you didn't bother to let me know that you've closed your doors?! I've always been a big fan of your brand, but you blew this. Clearly you didn't get any help from a PR agency on how to close a location gracefully (especially since you still have locations in this city). You should have called me, apologized for the inconvenience and then offered me a 25% discount to move my party of 14 to your Stetson location. Too bad you handled this so poorly."}
{"text":"So delicious!  Do not pass up the Crisp Brussels Sprout Chips!  We ordered 5 servings for 3 of us.  I could have eaten more.  The patio is wonderful.  We were there through sundown and into the evening and the view is just beautiful.  Two of us commented, at the same time, that we felt like we were at Disneyland.  Our server, Madeline, was great.  She knew the menu and was very helpful in accommodating dietary needs with alternative suggestions.  Two of us had the Goat Cheese Free Range Chicken, (Note, the chicken is on the bone which I personally do not care for), one with the risotto cakes and one with quinoa.  I loved the cakes but I did overhear another table who indicated they did not like the breading.  Neither of us cared for the grilled Belgian endive that came with our dinner so that was a waste.  Our third party member ordered Pear & Gorgonzola Flatbread and added chicken.  It was a little too oily for her as she has digestive issues but she did say the flavor was great.  Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Big disappointment.  I made a reservation 24 hours ahead asking for a \"nice table on the patio\" for a special occasion.  They acknowledged my reservation when I arrived but had not reserved a table for me.  My choice was a table in the sun or one in the shade.  Shade please.  One seat faced a concrete pillar and the other faced the service bar. The hostess was rude, insisting that this was a patio table.  The appetizer I wanted to order? They ran out.  Last night. Waiter hard-sold a substitute, which we declined.  We ordered and that was the last we saw of the waiter.  After 35 minutes I saw him behind the bar and went to speak to him. Wonder why food was taking so lonng.  He said they were busy.  Guests who arrived after me were already served. He said it would be right out, and he came back with it so quickly that I knew without having to taste that my short rib enchiladas had been sitting under a light too long.  The tortilla was hard on the bottom. The slaw was delicious and the bloody Mary a $5 bargain.  This is not the venue for a special occasion.  I can't recommend it for any occasion."}
{"text":"Ok, so I rarely get to Old Town to eat.  RARELY.  I'm a CenPho grrrl.  But, when Chef Bec invites you out to try stuff, you go.  Pronto!!!! Sat at the bar, since it was a Friday and I guess that's where people sit.  Went with Kirti for happy hour & just to chill.  Not only was the service great (I rarely had to ask for a refill), but the chef even came out to introduce herself.  The place wasn't too crowded yet, which was good, because that's another reason for all the attention.  Had to keep the worker bees busy!   First thing we tried was the ribs appetizer.  They were falling off the bone and had an amazingly sticky-spicy-sweet sauce on them.  Also had the crab dip, which came with plantain chips.  I loooooooooove plantain chips.  Love.   The pork tacos?  OMG.  O. M. G.  I took a couple home as leftovers and my mouth watered all night, thinking about those tacos. For dessert, we had \"crack pie.\"  I don't even know what was in it, but the crust was nutty, there was whipped cream, and it stuck to my teeth when I ate it.  And it was made from crack.  It HAD to be!!!!!!  The red velvet cupcake was also divine, but that crack pie...*sigh* Parking is a bitch in Old Town, but there is a garage right near The Herb Box."}
{"text":"Hanging out in old town Scottsdale and trusting Yelp reviews to guide us to the perfect lunch spot. Yelp delivered us here.  Great place and we will come back! Nice outdoor seating, amazing menu and great wines by the glass and beer selection.  If I lived here I would be here every week! The service was a little slow, but we were not in a hurry so it did not matter.  Steak salad and chicken blt were so good!!! Gorgeous menu!!"}
{"text":"One of the best spots to eat or grab a drink in old town. Fun atmosphere, beautiful outdoor seating, and friendly staff! The food is all delicious and they have unique cocktails. The bartender, Paul, is my favorite. Super nice guy whose extremely knowledgeable and makes the best drinks!"}
{"text":"I do not get to go to the Herb Box often enough, I love it! I think it is the perfect place to meet friends as the atmosphere is laid back and cute. Their lunch menu is great though I only order one thing every time, the veggie and hummus wrap without cheese, which is their happy something or other salad in a wrap form with hummus so surely that salad must be fantastic, too. I don't know how they do it but it is exceptional, even with seemingly simple ingredients. Their sweet potato chips are amazing and so are their crispy edamame. I love their variety of iced teas and could quite likely eat there every day. It is a bit pricier than my typical lunch but for Scottsdale and for the quality of food it is a great deal."}
{"text":"I'd been here before but never for happy hour and not in a WHILE. Every single thing we ordered was excellent and we considered ordering seconds of each but the unfortunate problem of stomach space came up. We tried the kale, corn pakora and my carnivorous boyfriend said he'd order that over meat. I mean, it's deep fried... Hello. Korean cauliflower was great too. Also had the veggie board and adored the brussels sprouts w/ vegan yellow pepper aioli and the edamame hummus and sweet potato chips. Cocktails were unique and refreshing. And who doesn't love happy hour pricing??"}
{"text":"Nice spot in old town scottsdale.  Salad was good sandwich also very good.  Service was great.   Not cheap but a good spot"}
{"text":"We came in for a late breakfast and were really pleased.  Pleasing attributes: 1. Great organic and fresh selections on the menu 2. Outdoor Patio (around the time we sat down on the patio, it was very pleasant.) 3. Vegetarian and a variety of plates (something for everyone) 4. Service was on point, plenty of refills and took an ice tea to go. 5. Cool for kids, laid back and a coloring sheet is always a plus.  I had the avacado love because the name says it all.  Fresh and tasty was really happy with my selection.  Only down side are the bathrooms...I was waiting for quite a bit because there is only one for each gender."}
{"text":"I was with a group of family members and we initially planned to go to Montagu's, but they were serving only appetizers on Sunday at the time we went (2 pm).  So I found this place nearby on Yelp and we walked there.  We were provided the Sunday brunch menu which had a choice of breakfast or lunch options.  When we first looked at the menu we thought we had made a mistake coming here.  But once we got our food, everything we ended up ordering was absolutely delicious!  Things we ordered:  -Eggs, bacon and toast (my dad is a basic kind of guy)  -Kobe Burger bacon + brie + apple-jicama-watercress slaw + smashed fingerlings + crisp fired sage + smoky blue cheese (My husband ordered this on toasted wheat bread since he doesn't like ciabatta or other fluffy breads. He didn't care for the fingerling potatoes served with it because he prefers regular fries. But the burger was nice and fresh)  -Grapefruit and sugar charred salmon: snap peas + fennel + blackberries + pistachio + orange + charred onion + black quinoa + snow pea shoots  -Lentil cauliflower bowl: organic cauliflower + rainbow quinoa + organic black lentils + pickled red grapes + crispy brussels sprouts + honeycup dijon + aioli   (I know this doesn't sound great, but it was -  I added the grapefruit and sugar charred salmon with it, delicious!)  -Sangria - it was mixed with a drier red wine, with just enough sweetness (my mom and I liked it)  We were only in town for a limited time and I'm glad we decided to come here.  I didn't end up eating another meal for the rest of the day."}
{"text":"Update to my 2015 review -- we tried again to enjoy the Herb Box over 2016 July 4 weekend, only to be turned away due to early closing. Others were still being served. Maybe it's me? Did I do something wrong to the Herb Box in a past life?"}
{"text":"Amazing makes a meat girl wanna go vegetarian must order the sweet potato tacos...and the cauliflower app rocks with a kick! Kiley is the best with her wine recommendations and pairings!"}
{"text":"Brunch at a Herb Box was good - innovative mixture of foods. Would love a availability of calorie count on prepared dishes.  Atmosphere and service pleasant, not too noisy."}
{"text":"What a gem of a restaurant! I knew something was up when there was a wait for a table for lunch after 1 pm!!-sat at the bar and tried the flatbread pizza(capicola and artichoke) which was amazingly good. Returned the next day for dinner with 5 others-loved the grilled salmon with curried chickpeas and cauliflower. The hummus/tzatziki appetizer with olives was delicious and large enough to share with all! My friends meals included roasted chicken, Thai BBQ ribs, pork chops and squash enchiladas which were all excellent. Friendly service and great atmosphere-one of my new favorites...I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Nom nom nom. In my belly. More Risotto Cakes please!  I'm very happy to have an Herb Box closer to my casa. I was delighted with my first visit to DC Ranch, but the drive is less and less likely to happen at $4 a guzzle. The Southbridge location did not disappoint. Our table on the patio facing the Waterfront was relaxing, beautiful, and perfect for a quiet Monday evening out. The interior was impressive and the bathrooms! A thorough review of the bathroom facilities is always an important part of my dining experience - these banos are sahweet!   Our server was one of the best I've ever had, and I come from a serving background. Very good knowledge and description of the food, perfect timing of table visits and a stellar attitude towards our preference for a snail paced meal.  The best part - those damn risotto cakes that I'm now dreaming about. We tried the pear and gorg pizza as well which was scrumptious and the market salad was so-so. I cannot wait to continue my way down the list of fresh and delicious items on the menu. Lovely, lovely place."}
{"text":"Redeemed!!  I am so happy to report that after my earlier 2-star review, we decided to try the Herb Box again before leaving Scottsdale.  It was SO delicious that we squeezed in two visits for dinner before we left.  I have to rave about THE. BEST. SALMON.  EVER.   I am not kidding.  The salmon entree was so astounding, I can't stop thinking about it.  I am sure the salmon sandwich was delicious but if you like salmon, please do not deny yourself this remarkable dish that you will not forget.  My friend (not a seafood fan) got the fried chicken both times and she was very happy with it.  The second night it was a bit overdone but nonetheless very tasty.  It is important to note that on both nights the service was quite good.  It was not, however, like our past outstanding visits, since we still had to ask for things, but at least both servers were accommodating and pleasant even if they were absent from view for a considerable amount of time.  Happy to vote in The Herb Box DC Ranch as a solid four stars!"}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try the Herb Box based on its positive review in the Phoenix magazine as well as the positive reviews on yelp. I am sad to say that we were GREATLY disappointed.:(  The outside patio looked great, so we opted to sit outside...turned out to be a bad idea: the seats were all stained and dirty, and the music outside was extremely loud. (this was a Wed. night) I don't care to have Leeann rimes blasting in my ears while I am trying to eat! We decided to start with the falafel bites and the short rib tacos (based on our server and Phx magazines recommendations).The falafel bites were very bland and tasted like they had been sitting around--they were cold and unappetizing. The tacos didn't taste horrible, but there was no depth whatsoever to the flavor-again very boring.  So, we decided to cut our losses and asked for our check...there was no way we were going to spend any more money on ok food!! So disappointed that the Herb box didn't deliver. It's a good thing that Citizen Public House was nearby!! Citizen Public house rescued us and saved our date night!!!"}
{"text":"I came here looking for something fresh.  I found it tastily packaged in an easygoing ambience for a couple extra bucks.  The menu is simple but interesting.  Of the items I tried -- salads and the enchiladas -- they were ample portions and well-executed.  There are other items on the menu that would make me want to go back to try.  No complaints."}
{"text":"I ate here for first time for free in a month I forgot, 2017, as incentive to hear a business talk about health management.  There were about 25 people in attendance, so we had several servers, who did a pretty good job.  I ordered the butternut squash and corn enchiladas.  It came with a mixed baby greens salad that did not have enough dressing on it.    Second time I ate here was at 5:30 May 22, 2018, is when a friend said Herb Box is going to move to another location where you cannot sit by the canal, and my friend wanted to experience sitting by the canal, one last time for happy hour.  I called about 2 hours earlier and made reservations for a table for 2 closest to the canal.  He got my name and said there was a large party, but they still had room for 2 people.  I don't know his name but when I arrived, my name was not on the list of reservations.  I think that guy got distracted and forgot to write our reservation down, but they still had a couple of tables for us to choose from.    My fnend who asked me to come to this, talked about how good the flatbread was.  So we ordered the corn and cheese flatbread topped with arugula for $5 HH price, to share.  When it arrived, my friend told me last time she was here ordering the same thing only 2 weeks ago, the toppings were much more generous.  She found the picture on her phone that she took, and yes, the toppings were piled much higher!  She was disappointed, so I said \"You can send it back!\"  She said \"I was thinking of that.\"  I said let's do it.  We asked a female server to get our server.  She asked if she could help us, so we told her about the skimpy flatbread, showed her the photo, and she offered to take it back and have them add more toppings.  When they brought it back, they piled it high with arugula, the cheese seemed to be the same, but we were much happier.  The flatbread overall was good, I'd give it 4 stars.  My friend also ordered  an alcoholic drink for $6.  Our server was Daniel E.  He came as soon we sat down and brought us the water we asked for.  He came many times to ask if we needed anything, while we were first eating.  But after a while it seemed like he was coming to interrupt our intense conversation every 5 minutes, asking if we needed anything!  It got downright annoying, because it always interrupted our conversation.  My friend did not like him one bit either, and said \"he doesn't seem to notice that we are engrossed in our conversation and he is interrupting us each time!\".  I got more and more resentful, and his repetitive interrupting with such short time periods between his visits, bordered on harrassment !  When me came to ask again, I very affirmatively told him \"We will come get you if we need anything\".  He said, \"I just want to give good service!\"    Well he STILL didn't get the hint.  He kept interrupting us even when we already paid our check.  I am a senior Foodie who eats out almost every day, and I cannot remember a server coming every 5 - 10 minutes to ask us if we needed anything in my entire long memory.  There comes a point where such repeated visits implies to ME that he wants us to leave, so the table could turn over more and he could make more tips.  Or since we ordered only 1 flatbread which we shared, and one drink, he wanted us to order MORE so he could get MORE tip.  There were still vacant tables beside us, so I told my friend it isn't as if there was a long line of people waiting for our table.  Our bill was only $11 plus tax.  My friend still left him a 15% tip, but my friend was not happy with his service for other reasons.    I guess being a server is hard, damnned if you don't make enough visits to a table to check on people, and damned if you make too many vists in the name of \"good service\".  But I really feel that the number of his visits in the 2 hours we were there for HH, is extreme, borderline harrassment and at the very least, \"lack of sense and respect of people's privacy\".  That is why I am giving 2 stars, not the skimpy flatbread and they forgot to write down our reservations. To ME, his profuse visits insinuated an ulterior motive than \"good service\".  Another eyebrow-raising experience in this visit, is when I called to make reservations, I asked why they had to move.  The employee said he did not know, only the owner knew.  I found it odd that the owner didn't tell the employees.  When I arrived, I asked the person who could not find my name on their reservation list, why they were moving.   He said he was not privy to that information, but maybe a manager would know.  I asked to speak to a manager.  When he came to our table, he said he didn't know either, he was \"only the manager, not the owner\".  I had already told my friend before the manager came, they probably are moving for an unpleasant reason, due to \"no one would say\"."}
{"text":"The food is so bomb! Try the Korean soba noodles with miso salmon. The service is great too. I never had to wait for water refills and our server was very attentive. Loved the hostess Mimi! She is friendly and professional. Great for lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"This Is Food And Atmosphere Heaven!  I took a friend here on Monday for his birthday lunch. He had been to the Herb Box before and when I suggested it, he had nothing but great things to say about it. This was a perfect place to take someone who had chosen to focus their diet on staying healthy. Then menu is extensive enough so that there is something for everyone.   We had not made a reservation, but were promptly seated out on the upstairs patio in the shade where we could enjoy the perfect weather. The overall feel of the place was just right from the moment we walked into the market downstairs throughout the entire meal. The atmosphere was calm, and everyone was friendly and attentive.   Within a minute of our being seated, our server arrived to take beverage orders and to ask if we had questions about the menu so far. We ordered Mango Lemonade and settled in to make our lunch selections. Our beverages came out in a matter of minutes.  It was SO HARD for each of us to pick just one menu item. I really wanted to try the Korean Fried Cauliflower, and the Grow Happy Garden Salad was seriously calling my name, perhaps with some salmon. The only way I managed to choose was by promising myself I would come back again soon to try them. Because I was starving, I settled on the Urban Market Steak Salad. My friend settled on the Serrano-Avocado Shrimp Salad and a side of Smoked Gouda Mac & Cheese. We considered ordering the Korean Fried Cauliflower as an appetizer, but I just don't have a large enough appetite to eat that much. We had barely decided on our selections when our server returned to refill our lemonade and take our orders.   We settled in to chat and enjoy the environment while we waited for our food. The weather was lovely, and it was quiet enough that we could talk comfortably.   Our food came out quickly and looked wonderful. The steak on my salad was perfectly medium rare as I had requested it, and the rest of the salad was fresh and flavorful with lots of wonderful ingredients in each bite. We both stopped talking and gave our attention entirely to our food for several minutes before relaxing back into our conversation again. Mango Lemonade refills continued to appear on a regular basis.  Our lunch experience was so relaxing and palate pleasing that we completely lost track of time as we finished our food and soaked up the atmosphere. We could have been in and out in under an hour, but we lingered for two.  I had expected to experience service issues based on many of the reviews I read before selecting the Herb Box for lunch, but our service was excellent. Perhaps lunchtime on Monday afternoons is the perfect time. I know I'll be there again next Monday. I'll be having the Grow Happy Garden Salad with salmon!"}
{"text":"I ate lunch here 2 days in a row because it was so delish!! The 1st day, Deanna was our server. We loved her! She had a great knowledge of the menu, told us specials and even helped us order. We had the goat cheese and chicken sandwich and the corn and goat cheese flatbread.   She told us to go check out the rest of the place and when we did we ran into Robert, the manager and he said right away, \"welcome to our home\". How cute is that?  So, I decided to bring some different friends there today. The food was awesome again...we tried a BLT flatbread and a turkey apple wrap and a veggie wrap as well. All very good! The service however wasnt exactly poor, just wasnt Deanna. We heard no specials, no name..well, no personality!  Why didnt I just ask for Deanna, you say? I did, her station was full, (shes on the patio and its gorgeous outside) and we were on a time crunch. Ill know better next time. The server actually touched the lip of the pitcher of iced-t to the lip of my glass. Now if she does that to everyones glass, well, you get the picture and I get a cold sore! YUCK! Needless to say, I asked for my tea to go. All that said, Ill come back here time and time again!!"}
{"text":"Went with our daughter for Father's Day brunch. Must say we really enjoyed eating here, it has a cozy feel with comfortable seating, good service and great food. My daughter and I had the cinnamon buckwheat pancakes with honey butter , comes with fresh blueberries and crispy bacon. Perfect size, moist and delicious. My husband had the eggs and bacon and his fried eggs were cooked perfectly. My mother had the red velvet pancakes topped with marscapone, she loved it but I tried it and to me it tasted too much like dessert. Not that it wasn't delicious; just too sweet for me.  All-on-all we were very pleased and will return again."}
{"text":"My husband and I went for brunch on Sunday and the place was very busy. Great menu lots of items to choose from. I had the kale, brie, bacon omelet which was very tasty but small for most restaurant omelets, the only side it came with was 1 slice of dry whole wheat toast but luckily had some type of current jelly which was wonderful to top it with. My husband had the burger which was hearty on ciabatta bread, it came with their sweet potato chips which are delicious. The waiter told us they have really great organic coffee but my husband, who I call a coffee connoisseur, only certain beans, french press and black for him, thought it was acidic and bitter as did I.  The waiter was very nice and did deduct it from our bill. All -in-all I'm sure we will return again."}
{"text":"The food here is decent but nothing spectacular for the price. The service, on the other hand, leaves much to be desired, in our experience. We went here for my wife's birthday, on a weeknight. We were seated quickly as it wasn't too busy, but it was 20 minutes before we had a server. We felt abandoned the entire evening, finally having to walk around the restaurant to try and find someone to bring us a check. Not a special evening at all. I actually took the time to send an email to them about our disappointing experience. They haven't bothered to respond in any way. Doesn't seem like a place that values its customers."}
{"text":"The cauliflower lentil bowl is absolute perfection.  Love sitting on the patio.  The servers have always been super sweet."}
{"text":"What a surprise to find this delightful restaurant in North Scottsdale! Lovely outdoor patio to eat al fresco when the weather is nice.   The Brie, green apple and spinach omelet is an interesting and delicious option. The serving is pretty small, though. They have many gluten-free options here - ask for fruit instead of toast as a side of you are gf. My daughter loves their red velvet pancakes- available on weekends only. Get the Pakora appetizer - one of the best things I've ever eaten.  Service is friendly but very slow/inattentive. They always leave dirty plates sitting on the table for too long. A little over-priced. Still, we love the food, so it's a fun treat."}
{"text":"Food was good but took 45 min after order to get food. Loud inside. Hoping service slow because new."}
{"text":"Adorable little lunch spot for flavorful appetizers, salads, sandwiches, and a few full entrees.      Homemade sweet potato chips were tasty but not too heavy, and we both loved my butternut squash corn enchiladas - the tomatillo verde sauce really made it stand out, and I love how the tortillas were baked until the ends were slightly crispy.  Side salad was a perfect complement with those cute little crispy tortilla strips that I can't find in grocery stores.    The falafel with pita was fairly good but was almost too small for anyone with a normal appetite (only 3 small falafel croquettes).  Although we did not have beer/wine there were a handful of choices, and I was pleased to see Hoegaarden, Anchor Steam, and a few other craft beer choices.    Restaurant is divided into two areas, one with small seating & kitchen/bar that leads to a covered hallway with outdoor seating, followed by the main dining area with numerous tables.  Decor somewhat suggested a homestyle European feel but I could be off on that.  Location is actually a good couple of tenths of a mile west of Shea inside a small shopping area just off Shea, and it's on the eastern side of this shopping area.  Parking is excellent, and this is an underappreciated feature of restaurants today.  I was hoping for breakfast like the other location, and it was disappointing to note that they're only open for lunch as well.  Portion sizes could have been larger, especially for the entree prices, or conversely the prices could have been more modest given the size of the orders.  I'm not sure what the norm is way up north of the 101 on Pima, but around Shea/Scottsdale there are a lot of delicious choices for less.    Nonetheless, I'll be back to try several other items and will probably go here as a top choice whenever I crave butternut squash/corn enchiladas."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch and sat at the table for 30 minutes. No one ever even came to ask if we wanted water. The food looked and sounded good, but I'm not really interested in staying at a place where they don't give two craps about the customers. Oh well. ¯\_(?)_/¯"}
{"text":"My BFF and I had been wanting to eat here so we decided to stop in for lunch after a dress fitting at Destiny's Bride across the way.  This place is super cute inside (even the bathrooms were impressive), the perfect atmosphere for a ladies lunch.  We were immediately seated and our drink order was taken. However, I was a little disappointed at how long it took the server to visit our table again. I made eye contact with him and managed to say \"come on man,we're ready to order\" without using any words at all. He acknowledged me and explained that he would be right over (I think he was carrying a tray of drinks for another table at the time). While he offered to share the specials (which I had been very interested in hearing about when we first sat down), my friend and I had both settled on a choice from the regular menu and were ready to get the show on the road.  I ordered the butternut squash enchiladas. The server had mentioned that it was one of the best things on the menu, but if that's the case -- bummer. My thoughts? The squash was undercooked, the tomatillo sauce was delicious but lukewarm at best (as was the filling). The mixed greens on the plate were sprinkled  with cotija cheese and dressed with some multicolored bell peppers, fresh and delicious. Maybe I should've ordered a salad instead?  BFF got the grilled chicken and sage pesto sandwich.Of course I had a bite... DELICIOUS! She was expecting the chicken to be warm; it was cold, but still a tasty sandwich. I'm pretty sure it was on ciabatta bread (love it) and was dressed with goat cheese, gala apples, and bacon. YUM! It came with sweet potato chips too and I couldn't keep myself from stealing another and another from her plate. I would definitely order this next time.   The server was always friendly, but I get the feeling that maybe he was taking care of too many tables at once. I've seen other comments on yelp addressing the service so perhaps this is an issue that needs to be addressed (ATTN: Management). I was, however, impressed that the server noticed a birthday gift sitting on our table and offered to bring a birthday treat. It was a chocolate cupcake with white frosting and a chocolate shell on top. DELICIOUS!! Reminded me of a chocolate hostess cupcake (I'm a sucker for those things).   Overall impressions? Cute. Pricey. So-so service.. Hit or miss food. I might try it again...still thinking about it."}
{"text":"Cute semi elegant restaurant tucked away inside old town Scottsdale. All their food is very fresh and presented well. Service was top notch, drinks always filled and servers very knowledgeable. Food was good! Nothing you won't find at any of the other organic cafes in the area but still worth a try! Definitely a place to take your date for a quick bite to eat and still want some class."}
{"text":"Great food and aunday brunch. We come here all the time and the food and service are always great."}
{"text":"Likely the Best Brunch in North Scottsdale.   Lots of options with an inventive and flavorful twist."}
{"text":"I love the Herb Box. My company previously ordered catering from the North Scottsdale location and that's when the addiction began. You would have to fight off coworkers for left over's. The food is always fresh and delish!  The ingredients are perfectly placed and you know what your getting is prepared with love . There isn't anything on the menu I don't like.  I am here at least 2 times a week for lunch, I keep checking the desserts for the peach and cream tart . Peach season is coming soon , so expect me lurking the whole month of May."}
{"text":"Love this place; and really love the bartenders.  Love to sit at the bar and enjoy food and great conversation with the bartenders.  Late night dining is always so enjoyable here."}
{"text":"Ugh.  If their food and outdoor seating was not so great, I would give them 1 star.  I do not understand if they are always constantly under new management or what.  I have been several times a year for years.  Glutton for punishment I suppose.  Last time I went with my mother, NOT during a busy time, early afternoon weekday, and do you know we sat for 22 minutes and NO ONE came to wait on us?  We were quite obviously sitting there, too.  We walked out.  And guess what?  Never going back.    Their north Scottsdale spot, however, has always been superb."}
{"text":"I totally take my mom here when she is in town.  LOVES it.  The food is great.  The atmosphere is great, and I actually expect the bill to be higher than it is when it comes.  Great.  I would give them 5 stars, but I have experienced some lesser service levels.  Went for sunday brunch, made the fatal error of arriving at 9 instead of 10, so we couldn't order bloody's...what a newby....  We were still there at 10.  The server, if he was good, would have had those bloody's ready.  But he didn't, he forgot.....oh, and they were on the bill.  So that did cost a star, I'm afraid.  Otherwise. go and enjoy an excellent dining experience."}
{"text":"I stopped in for a few drinks and was very well taken care of by a bartender by the name of James...service amazing and quick, drinks were good and a very social James made it an enjoyable stay...well done herb box, well done"}
{"text":"Our group had a wonderful experience at The Herb Box. It was our favorite restaurant in the Scottsdale area. We had a nice view seated outside below flowering trees. The service and food were outstanding. Our server Andy took fabulous care of us. Our large group had personal service and I had several people comment to me how delicious the food was or how amazing the staff were. We'll be back again!"}
{"text":"Oh, Herb Box - your name conjures up visions of a fast-food sandwich spot (or in Denver, the newest MMJ shop), but in reality you're keepin' it classy.   -Simple, beautifully-decorated interior? Check. -Unique, eye-catching chandeliers? Check. -Groovy bathroom with oversized doors, tons of mirrors and the flattest sink in the west? Check. - But the pièce de résistance? Fried green olives stuffed with blue cheese. Please, commence with the drooling.  The menu at Herb Box is filled with lots of options for salads, sandwiches, wraps, flatbreads (why can't we just call them pizzas?), and shared plates to start. I sampled the petite fromage - soft bread with capicola, honey cheddar and sea salt with a lovely little sweet salad. Caution: this is a very rich sandwich which is probably best eaten with a fork. Good luck picking it up!   Our party of 14-ish must have wrecked the kitchen, because our service was painfully slow. Our drinks came out quickly (try the Arnold Palmer) but orders of sweet potato chips didn't arrive for half an hour, and our meals about 10 minutes after that. Desserts were beautifully presented, and my bite of the red velvet cupcake was sweet and satisfying, as expected.  P.S. No surprise, there are actual herbs in the flower boxes out front."}
{"text":"We stopped in here for lunch. Despite the crappy weather that we had experienced the whole time of our visit, this place made me smile, the service made me smile and the food as well! I am very picky about service and food, may I just say it felt so nice not to have any complaints and the waitress was so sweet and accommodating.  The potatoes with aioli are wonderful and I recommended getting the avocado and bread with fennel! Had a wonderful brunch!"}
{"text":"The Herb Box, including the one in Old Town and the one in North Scottsdale, has always been one of my favorite places to eat. It is a great, go-to place where the food and drinks never disappoint. I usually have the salmon and replace the side with fingerling potatoes. Always delicious! And the Brussel sprouts are by far the best out of any place I've ordered them. Also, I've never had an issue with service. I took away a star because when I last went in, the hostesses ignored us for a bit and even with a lot of open tables, more than a handful throughout the restaurant, we still had to wait around 10-15 minutes and weren't given any explanation. The hostesses just kind of walked around in a confused way while we just looked at them just wondering what was up. Anyways, that definitely won't stop me from coming in. Love this place"}
{"text":"We had dinner there last night and the food was amazing! Our server Andy was great very knowledgeable and friendly. We talked with Paul the manager and he was a really nice guy. We ate the ribs, Kobe burger and enchiladas all excellent choices! Will go back for sure."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong w this place. Great location, nice set up. Service is super friendly and fantastic. If you ever get Carlos give the guy a high five, he is great and knows his menu. Never steers me wrong. Definitely my new favorite spot!"}
{"text":"Gracious service, ridiculously delicious food, and attention to every last detail are the hallmarks of a fabulous restaurant. The Herb Box has all this going very strong. Thank you so much for the beautiful Rehearsal Dinner last week. Our server, Andy and his associate Carlos (I hope I am correct) provided our party with 'above and beyond' care and service. From start to finish, or from exceptional cocktails to sweet desserts, we dined and enjoyed our evening. I can wholeheartedly recommend the crispy brussel sprouts, the flatbreads, the grilled steak, the short ribs with potato cake, and every single dessert served. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I have not yet had the pleasure of dining at the restaurant but I have stopped by the little market (south side, entrance facing the street not the bridge) for grab-and-go lunch. There are a few small bistro tables but it is just too hot right now to sit and hang out.   The food is really amazing. Great sandwiches and salads. They also have a quiche of the day. But the really cool part is that a lot of the side dishes from their menu are available for purchase by the pound deli-style. I have tried the roasted sweet potatoes and the balsalmic beets. Both were really amazing! And I mean that a-ma-zing! I can't believe that I can get a gourmet, healthy and filling lunch with a fresh brewed iced tea for around $10. This is really a great lunch option.   The people working the counter are very friendly and you can tell that they take pride in their work. They also offer samples of the plethora of baked goods they have available. There is also a little section of the market that has some wines, sauces, and olive oils for sale. All of that makes for fun browsing while you wait."}
{"text":"This was a great place! Thanks to all you Yelpers for giving it such a good rating. I arranged for a business lunch there and was wonderfully surprised. Great waiter, Brooks, took really good care of my colleague and I and the food was perfectly cooked. We ate outside next to the canal on a Patio that was covered. It was beautiful spring day and I will go back with family and friends anytime.  Cheers and Bon Appetite!"}
{"text":"Brunch!!  The Brussel Sprout chips are the best and you can't go wrong with brunch here.  I'm always happy and full leaving herb box!"}
{"text":"Came here with a large group for lunch, and the place was packed. Our service was attentive throughout our meal and everything came out in good time. Everything I tasted was great, from our appetizer of sweet potato chips to my main the short rib tacos and black bean mango salad. The decor inside the restaurant was appealing as well. I'll be returning soon."}
{"text":"Went to Herb Box this morning for Mother's Day brunch...amazing!!  This place is so consistently awesome....great food, service and drinks.  The patio was perfect, great atmosphere.  I really liked that they took their popular menu items and made a brunch format for Mother's Day to make it a little less hectic...great idea!!  Everything was excellent, but I particularly love the salmon hash w/ fingerling potato, chilaquile and kale pakora.  The drinks were great too...mimosa, Bloody Mary and the Lemon Martini were all enjoyed at our table."}
{"text":"I love the vibe here! Feels very upscale with out upscale prices. We opted to wait and sit outside because the weather was perfect. Was in AZ for a vacation and met up with a college friend and his wife for brunch. I had a BLT... no complaints! The pancetta and ricotta were a nice gourmet addition. The blood Mary's were just right. You could make your own but we chose the bartender to make them."}
{"text":"The Brussel sprouts and short ribs were amazing. Unfortunately, the service was terrible. We sat at the bar, ordered drinks and appetizers. Our waiter there was great. When it was time to get seated we got the side eye by the host because we asked to move inside versus outside. It was chilly outside and we never requested outdoor seating. A waiter was never assigned to our table, so after tracking down an employee we asked for someone. Our waiter from the bar area took over...thank goodness. It took a long time to get the food and check. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast at 12:00 noon and found out they stop serving breakfast at 11:00 am, bummer.  Ordered sandwiches instead, had the chicken blt and the steak tartine sandwich. The sandwiches were on a Chibatta bread and came with sweet potato Salted Curry Chips which had great presentation and good tasting.  The steak tartine sandwich is messy and a little heavy on the Roasted garlic mayo which I love mayo, it actually made the Chibatta bread soggy which I have never seen a Ciabatta bread not hold up.  I would like to try the breakfast or dinner menu next time, was not wanting to do  lunch this day but the food, atmosphere and service was very good.  Looking forward to coming back, a nice high end restaurant."}
{"text":"So I yelped up this place and looked at their website and had to take my honey to this restaurant! Wow it was wonderful. The Salmon cake with corn pablano was a feast for the eyes and for the palate. The Thai ribs with fingerling potatoes had a sauce with just the right amount of spice. The meat was fall off the bone perfect and juicy. Perfect is perfect! With a good cocktail,  Pama vodka and a nice simple single malt. What more can you say! I will tell you - Chocolate desserts that are chocoholic quality. Park the car and come on in!"}
{"text":"This is a tough review. It could have gone 4 stars, but the service was, as others have mentioned , spotty. We waited 10-15 minutes for drinks- having to flag a waiter down.... but the food was really good. The \"avocado love\" was unlike what you would expect- more chunks than smears of avocado but was fresh and good. All in all for a Wednesday night that wasn't busy? I expected more from the service- hence why only 3 stars. I'd like to try the D.C. ranch location."}
{"text":"What a nightmare this place. Horrible service, our server didn't give a crap. My wife ordered gluten free toast, they brought out 9 grain and told us it was gluten free. . They didn't do anything to remedy that situation. Carlos just grabbed the toast off her plate and never brought the gluten free toast. WOW!!! Food was meh...."}
{"text":"I'm writing this review as a vegan.  I went here with three friends (2 vegetarians, one gluten free, and one omnivore) and we picked it because of the dietary options....  I was disappointed.  There was a grand total of ONE vegan entree on the menu, which was good but pricey and overall disappointing for a restaurant that seems to claim it has good vegan options.  At the time I dined there, there was no vegan dessert option and all of my friends got dessert while I sat and watched them.  It seems they have added a vegan option since that time, so that's some progress, I guess.  I will not consider going back there unless the vegan options are better."}
{"text":"Fresh and healthy. That's what comes to mind when I think of the Herb Box. I've been here a few times now, and haven't been dissappointed. Their vegetarian plates are very creative (I'm not vegetarian, but I dabble....) The Vegan Nosh is super good! I almost crave those beets with mandarin oranges....and the fried shallots are to die for!    The other day I tried the sweet potato tacos....they were good, but i'm having a hard time remembering them, so maybe they weren't THAT good. Actually, our waiter mixed up our order and brought out the thai ribs on accident, we got to keep it free of charge.....I ended up picking more on those then I did my sweet potato tacos, haha.....they were pretty good! (the ribs) A little on the sweet side, but a nice amount of kick! Yum!   I've always recieved decent enough service, never over the top though. I suppose a little snootiness is sometimes to be expected in this part of town. But at least it's civil, lol.   Bottom line: I'll be back....and maybe I'll order those ribs for real next time.......   P.S. be sure to check out their patio.....so cute! looks like it's straight out of Europe or something!"}
{"text":"The Herb Box has a prime location right on the canal in Scottsdale. I love their outdoor patio, cute lights, and the fact that there is usually a live musician right there by the canal so if you sit outside you can listen to the live music.  Every time I have been here I have had some tasty, quality drinks. I love their wine selection, a nice glass of white wine or prosecco while sitting outside truly can't be beat at this place.   Now, let me tell you about their flatbread. First off, on Happy Hour, it is a TOTAL steal. You have to try it! It is bursting with flavor and has just the amount of toppings to match texture with taste.   Now, if you have some veg-friends, they have a GREAT vegetarian nosh board. It is perfect for grabbing a few glasses of wine and munching while enjoying the beautiful location.   I recommend this for a date-night spot!"}
{"text":"Overall really good food, though there are a few mediocre sides. I've only been for dinners, and the trout and brussel sprout chips are so so good. Really good. Nice place, good service, and nice setting by the canal in Old Town."}
{"text":"This was recommended by a local here to have good healthy options. Pretty empty on a Saturday afternoon so the server was able to accommodate us as we really didn't want the sun hitting us directly but still wanted to enjoy this cool AZ weather. Let me get to the food! Yummmm! Ranging from the turkey avocado wrap to the lentil bowl and ending with my red velvet pancakes. Every plate of food had us satisfied to say the least. Great drink specials as well! Will be back if in the area again."}
{"text":"Our party of four had a great lunch yesterday eating very fresh , healthy and fun salads.   Three of us started with a great Italian wine, a Pinot Grigio from Scarpetta, Italy.  It was very special.  One person had lemonade.  Two had chopped salads with everything in it, very fresh and tasty.  One person had salmon on his salad.     I had The Mexican BAJA BOWL with many vegetables and extra black beans,  I thought it was outstanding.   Our server STEPHEN was quick to our every request and need.  He was sharp.   I was impressed with how inexpensive this restaurant was.  We had lots of drinks and food for four people; and it was only about $100.00!  Great food and service; and very reasonable in price.  sincerely,  Ed Altman  Jr"}
