{"text":"I had a Saskatoon pie from here when they were at the Crossroads Market. The pie crust was hard like a rock and the filling just so-so. The berries were really small. I like big juicy Saskatoons that are full of flavor. You won't find that here. Pie is really pretty simple. Not sure how Simon screwed it up but he did."}
{"text":"Not all pies are equal - my favourite include: Swiss chicken and mushroom, Sheppard's pie (both chicken and beef), and various quiches.However, I didn't care for the shrimp pie as it tasted bland and had a mushy texture. I sampled the dessert pies (cherry and apple), the crust was flaky but the filling didn't impress me. The latest batch I bought seemed like it was an improved recipe - it just tasted fresher and made with better quality product. The price is right - paired with grilled vegetables or a salad, Simple Simon pies makes a easy peasy dinner. However, those little suckers take forever to bake in the oven."}
{"text":"Simple Simon Pies has been a staple in Calgary for many, many years.  I was astonished to see that nobody has written a review on the Crossroads location!

The lure is irresistable when you walk by their kiosk and they offer you samples to try.  I remember when I first tried a Simple Simon Pie, I was not expecting to be as pleased as I was!  When I think of Pies, I think of desserts, but in my mind, the hidden gem is their savoury pies.

My favorite is their Jamaican Beef Curry, which is flavorful, and medium spicy to me (very spicy to some).  

These pies can be purchased frozen and brought home to reheat.  I take advantage of the Simple Simon charity events, where local groups will sell these pies and take a portion of the profits, and then I load up my freezer."}
{"text":"I bought the butter chicken meal.  DON'T DO IT!  I have eaten a lot of frozen butter chicken meals in moments of bad judgement (i.e. from grocery stores or whatever), but this was inedible.  And it isn't that cheap for being inedible.  The sauce was the worst.  It bore no resemblance whatsoever to butter chicken sauce.  But the worst part was the texture.  It was gritty and glue-like.  Just typing this grosses me out.  DON'T EAT IT!"}
