{"text":"Best place for fries! Breakfast sandwiches! Hot Meals! I didn't realize everything is made in house from scratch!!!!!! From the hummus, salads, pasta and pasta sauce!!!! The Chicken Shawarma  sandwich is like nothing you have had before! It's juicy, fresh and huge!!! Also! Ladies it doesn't fall apart!!!! Great lunch place!!!! I personally am a fan of the falafel sandwich! They stick French fries in it for me!!! Also, the people that work there are very sweet, humble and down right good! 

This place is more like family! They know everyone by name!  You walk in and instantly greeted with great service. They give you time to decide and help you customize if needed. 

On several occasions I have gone into the restaurant in a rush between meetings and they are fast!!!! Which I appreciate. I have brought in a few clients with me and they never disappointed with the food. Always consistent. 

If you are in the area.. Give them a try!!!! They ROCK!!!!!!"}
