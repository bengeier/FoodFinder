{"text":"Good service, tasty food.  Didn't enjoy the music, nothing Celtic about it at all, little disappointed with that."}
{"text":"The magical Unicorn has re-appeared from it's dark dungeon and is now a . . . Superpub!   The menu is still pretty mediocre, nothing jumps out at you but it's probably because they're trying to reclaim their fame as downtown's best known watering hole. (I had the Chicken Bacon Ranch pizza - very garlicky but flavorful and filling!)  Their patio is pretty decent. It's roomy, nicely shaded and perfect for people watching down Stephen Ave.  Although I don't love it here, I like it a lot more than their previous location!"}
{"text":"Nice sports pub on two levels.  They have a ground level patio.  Daily specials.  Staff were very friendly and accommodating.  Many TVs.  The hummus plate was great and had cherry tomatoes on it.  Didn't like the quesadilla as the peppers were fried in grease.  Note to cooks: If you have cheese in a quesadilla you already have  enough grease so just put in raw or dry pan fried peppers.  Good place to people watch."}
{"text":"Stopped in after a music gig for a quick bite to eat. Had the boneless riblets and the fried pepperoni, both were tasty and came out quickly. There was a live band playing. It was a great way to end the night."}
{"text":"Stopped in there for a quick bite and a couple beers while in town last week for the Rangere vs Flames game .  Place was good, manager at the bar was friendly & the customers there were super friendly"}
{"text":"The food was great but the servers were terrible.   I was here for a company's stampede function.  They had ordered a pig roast along with a buffet style assortments of other meats to make your own sliders and sides.  The buffet consists of beef and pork roast, baked beans, potato salad, veggies and ranch dip, assortment of cookies and the pig roast.  Though the food and drinks were decent, the waitresses will only bring you drinks on the menu.  If you asked for water, you're expected and are told to go get your own from a pitcher near the buffet spread.    Overall, the food was good. The service was bad and ultimately left a bad taste in the overall experience."}
{"text":"I booked the space for a gathering for 30 people. Service was great. We just ordered munchies but they were tasty. It was a little loud as it was hockey playoffs."}
{"text":"If you thought the legendary Unicorn had vanished into nothing but a myth, let me happily inform you that you're wrong! The Unicorn has been in hiding and it's been breeding! Oh yeah - there are now 3 Unicorns in the same building- Tricorn power!!!  While they've got the original signage, the new Unicorn has gone in quite a different direction. Let's face it - we're not gonna find that old, dingy pub vibe with a new space - they made a good call in owning it's changes.  Pub 1: Kitchen Party has got that good ol' east coast underground pub vibe. Of the three, this one most captures the delightfully divey spirit of what the Unicorn once was. Those of you who were fans of The Below Deck tavern, fear not!  I'm told they're keeping some of the favourites on the menu including the Halifax Donair. I tried one right before the switch over to it becoming The Unicorn- so good. That's sweet sauce... They've also recently changed the beer selection up a bit and definitely not for the better. The Grizzly Paw became Coors Banquet? What the hell is up with that? I hope it's some sort rotating tap thing and not a leap in the wrong direction.  Pub 2: Classic Calgary - Big windows, space for a Stephen Ave patio in summer - it will be a good space for daytime eatin' and drinking. We hit up this level for the half price pizza which is definitely worth it for $8. Not sure if go the Pizza route if it was $16, but the bacon wrapped sirloin with truffle aioli for $14 is a sizeable serving of protein I'd order again. I also had one of their suped up beers that have a shot in them. I love this concept and you can come up with some exciting combos. They she'd away from using craft beers for this which left the selection a little weak. Still, I opted for a steam whistle with a shot of Long Island. It definitely gives your Pilsner a nice pick me up. Along the wall they've got a bunch of tap handles from all sort of tasty beers. Unfortunately they seem to be moving away from serving any of them. I really hope this is not the case. I like how they have TVs visible for people sitting at the bar, but not all over the place so it doesn't interrupt your conversations.  This level really is the most vanilla of the three and while its renovated nicely and I dig the wooden canoe on the ceiling and the beer keg lighting, it somehow seems to lack that Infectious personality. If you're feeling exceptionally corporate today, this might be your floor. I think I may have also been thrown off by the music. It's the first day, of course I'll let it slide - I just don't want to listen to Britney Spears and other expired top 40 pop at the pub, you know? It's the kind of music people play when they're trying to do what they think the people want instead of doing what they want to do. For me, pubs really need that authentic personality, and right now I think this level is discovering itself. But let me reiterate - it was the first day!   Pub 3: don't remember the name, but SPORTS! TBC..."}
{"text":"Fries, Wings, Bulldog drinks are my favourite! Always packed especially during play offs!"}
{"text":"Poor service. The bartenders actually come across the street to Local for their own drinks. Poor. Lol"}
{"text":"Food is good for pub food, but service if it's busy it's terrible. Had to Repeatedly tell the waitress our order and thing had been forgotten and then she stood at the table and blackly ignored us and and faded off in to Lala land...   I think they need more people booked for busy nights"}
{"text":"Went on a very busy Saturday night. Server would not bring a glass of water with our order, said it was too busy. Asked again for a water for our DD and told we have to wait. Water came same time as our bill."}
{"text":"Heard the old unicorn was really good. What happened here. So came here on a Wednesday night after work. Guess what... it was wings night for $0.29 each with a purchase of a drink. I got ice tea with my honey garlic wings. The wings are smaller but they were not that flavorful. Skin was crispy... somewhat. The taste was lacking but for $0.29... well it was cheap.  The place wasn't pack on a Wednesday night. So that tells you there cheap wings were not that attractive.   Service was ok. Their d√©cor was pretty cool. There are two parts of this bar.   Parking can be a pain because its located downtown. But again, its good to come here after work with colleagues."}
{"text":"I asked for a reservation to seat 12 ....well we got something that would seat maybe 10 Adults comfortably. The tables were also unstable and despite requests to get a new one nobody did anything.  The menu on the main floor was limited and would have been nice to have the options from the lower floor.  Atmosphere is dark dingy and dusty, I can understand if they were trying to keep the original style from the old location, but if your going to have 3 distinct floors then use some imagination and make them somewhat distinct.  The food tasted good and came out fresh and hot.  Overall i would say that there needs to be some work done on the ambiance.  Nothing from my experience is making me want to return."}
{"text":"So first off our server Jenna was phenomenal.  Funny, engaging,  and just an overall delight. Made the whole trip worth it because she was funny, engaging, and accepting of our drunk comments. 2nd: other bars around didn't matchup compared to the comments of Jenna but she didn't speak bad of the surrounding area. Going back for Jenna because she made the whole experience better. Staying because the beer was pretty good....not as dark as I like but stilll very good."}
{"text":"We had lunch here today. The soup was very tasty. We also shared taco chips and dip - just average. There are s lot of DT locations with much better food at better prices."}
{"text":"Friends and I stopped there for a drink. A couple came in literally less than a minute ahead of us and got served. Instead, our group of friends got rejected and was told they had done last call. On our way out, we drove back to the McDonalds and the couple right ahead of us had a fresh glass of drinks.   I really do not appreciate this sort of service, especially since we were just visiting Calgary."}
{"text":"Yikes. I remember going here to the old location and the food and ambiance was great. The new one, not so much. The service was very quick and friendly so no complaints there, but the food was ridiculously bad and the rules make no sense. They advertised a drink deal online but it only applied to certain floors not including the one where the hostess sat us, even though cheap wing night was also advertised online and applied to all floors. There's no obvious indication of there being separate rules for separate floors.  The food was a disaster. The wine was super cheap tasting, the water tasted strongly of disinfectant to the point that I was afraid to drink it, and the wrap I ordered had clearly been sitting there for hours as I asked for one of the listed ingredients to be not included in the wrap and was told it was not possible. The consistency of the wrap confirmed it was indeed not fresh - it was like mush and had water and grease oozing out of it to the point where it was almost impossible to eat. I miss the old Unicorn :("}
{"text":"The servers are aggressive with awful attitudes. Our group was yelled at to get out of their way many times (plenty of room to maneuver around, plus if they didn't have Reserved signs on half the bar's tables at 11pm at night, maybe so many people wouldn't be in their way).  At a certain point, I was roughly shoved from behind by a server. We moved upstairs for a bite to eat. Our server refused to bring us water, telling us she was too busy and there might be someone else around who could bring some. Water showed up 45 minutes later. The server would let one of us speak and order and then run away before anyone else could order or add anything.  Finally, friend bit into her sandwich and got a tasty mouthful of plastic twist tie. Mortified, she called the server over to show her, to which the server replied \"well I didn't make the sandwich!\"  By far, the absolute worst experience I have had in this city. Overrated bar with entitled 20 somethings riding on some bizarre good reputation, with zero interest in being decent human beings to the people who keep them employed. The abundance of other reviews complaining about the server's crap attitudes should be enough to keep you away.  I will forever tell this story to anyone who will listen. Working downtown in O & G, with people constantly asking me for dining recommendations, should be easy peasy to keep a few people from this nasty experience."}
{"text":"This new Unicorn location is huge - taking up the old Libertine space (sadface).   It is a great place to grab a drink or dinner before a concert or sports event.   3 stars because the service was just okay, and the food was nothing memorable.  It is definitely a go-to due to its location but has nothing food or drink wise that stands out and makes me WANT to go here all the time."}
{"text":"Stopped here before the Bruins/Flames game.  It was like the closest place from the Saddledome, which seems kinda crazy.  Nice place, great bars up and downstairs.  Lots of seats at the bars.  TV's everywhere and some cool stuff on the walls.    Had a great teriyaki salad, you have to try it.  The only knock, our bartender was an ok guy but looked like he hadn't seen water or a change of clothes for some time.  I'm not usually that picky, but this was over the top.    They did have some great beers on draft, so we were able to drink our way through the negative stuff."}
