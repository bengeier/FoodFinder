{"text":"Great new restaurant on Monkland! Welcome to the neighborhood. Amazing chinese dumplings - we loved the beef curry dumplings, the chicken and mushroom dumplings, and the shrimp dumplings. (We asked our server to order for us - and it was divine!) And, 4 of us ate for about $60 - which is pretty great!

Try it out!"}
{"text":"Appetizers were good however, one of the three dumpling plates came and then we had to wait 45 mins for the other one which was fried on the outside and gooey on the inside. The third plate (mine) they served to another table.
We received a 10% discount in the end but overall it was a horrible experience.
Will never go back."}
{"text":"I love dumplings so I was excited to find out a Dumpling restaurant opened on Monkland. I have walked by many times and the location is casual and clean (not huge but there is space to sit down inside). I ordered for delivery from them. They offer Steamed, Fried and the option to have them in a clear broth. I was turned off by the fact that they charge you almost 2$ extra just to have your dumplings fried instead of steamed or in broth. We had Pork+Green onion (Steamed), Beef&Curry (Fried) and Shrimp+Egg+Leek(Steamed).  The dumplings themselves were okay , The Beef&Curry were the best ones but some of the bites of meat inside were a bit too rubbery, the Pork&Green onion lacked flavor and the Shrimp,Egg&Leek were really not enjoyable. They were sooooo bitter  and barely had any shrimp inside (One of my dumplings actually had no shrimp inside).  Definitely not coming back here , especially with so many other great dumpling options in Montreal."}
{"text":"De passage j'ai juste pris une bonne petite soupe miso et un thé , le local manque d'aeration mais bien decoré."}
