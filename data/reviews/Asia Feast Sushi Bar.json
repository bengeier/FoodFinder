{"text":"First time visitor and this venue doesn't really please me. As you eat they play really sleepy drowsy music in the background.   We're party of 5, ordered our food and 1hr later still haven't seen our order. Staff was not friendly nor helpful and it's under staffed.  The menu isn't all the good and every item on the menu that includes rice is all rice and no ingredients.  We've been here for a total of 2 hours and at the end of the night, they just pretty much made us the remainders.  Overall I would not recommend this place for get together.  THE OTHER THING I DONT LIKE IS THEY HAVE ADDED A 10% SERVICE CHARGE ALTHOUGH THE SERVICE WAS HORRIBLE!!!!"}
{"text":"We went on a Sunday night around 8:15.  Very quite, there were 4 tables seated and 3 servers.  Our server took our order with hot sake, after about 5 minutes - our sake came, no food yet.  When finally the sushi and Sashimi arrived (very warm) and the saki is now cold.  We asked the waitress for a bowl of hot water to warm up the saki -  I don't think it was understood.    We ordered tuna twice - only available on weekend , the first time we'd thought was overlooked, the second time we were told it was not available - (shame, 'cause not having something that was only available on weekend seems to me they are cutting food cost at the expense of clients).  I can't say the food was anything special... that's because about 1/3 of our orders was either forgotten or neglected.  I did say it was a slow night with 3 servers, but it took as 3-4 minutes to flag down a server every time.  At about 9, we asked what time the restaurant closes cause we were the second last table there.  We were told 10PM.  We ordered another Sake and by 9:15 we were the last table and they promptly handed us our bill and started cleaning off our table.  Feeling unwelcome, my out of town guest asked for a comment card - our waitress smiled and left.    This was actually our second time at this establishment, the first time was when they newly opened and as I recalled, it wasn't this bad...but how times has changed.  For 3 people, a $130 bill - it was not worth it - both in service and food.  I know we won't be going back and we won't recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"EDITed to shorter:  POsiTives: - Aesthetically nice interior -enjoyed sweet honey roll  Negatives: -1st time when i went, ordered food..took long..when it came..WTF...SMALL PORTIONS!! -The sweet honey roll was made different 2nd time i came (not so great) -2nd time i came, they made their sushi with too much RICE (ew) -their desserts suck...nothing special  1st and 2nd time i ordered something and it never came.  CONCLUSION: Not bother going there again.     *they have a buffet table  now, but still it's not all that"}
{"text":"Went for the first time for dinner. The decor of the restaurant is very nice. The music is a bit unusual for an Asian restaurant, Cold Play, wasn't the best fit. I suggest some traditional Chinese music or Japanese. The service was excellent. The were constantly keeping an eye on us to see if we needed anything else. We ordered off the Japanese menu and it was all well presented. I had noodle soup, it wasn't what I expected. However, the sushi was great! I used a Groupon and it was well received. I would definitely go again, even without a Groupon."}
{"text":"First time here. Came with expectations 50% deal would include Chinese portion for AYCE but it was not. This was my birthday celebration one day earlier breaking the tradition of dinning at Masa. Bill came out 130 for 2 Snr. 3 adults and 2 children. The beer was a bit expensive at 7 for Sapporo and wine and draft brought our bill up.  They also includes 10% service/tip in the bill. The food was great making it my 3rd favourite place in GTA only if it is at 50% off. Only negative thing I could think is the price is not like that everyday. It was not busy at all when we arrived at 6:30pm though it became busy when we were leaving at 8:30pm. Everyone enjoyed their food. We will definitely come back again probably in 2 wks."}
{"text":"First lower your expectations, you're for one in Thornhill for Sushi, and secondly it's all you can eat.    Stepping inside it's a beautifully designed restaurant, open high ceiling airy feel, nice neutral tones, array of seating options available, cherry blossom decored walls.  In the center the sushi chefs prepare foods and at dinner time from what I can tell this area has hot foods available.  We were here for lunch and the atmosphere was nice. Big windows bring in natural light. The sushi grade was not the greatest however all the  fried food we ordered was awesome. The tempura shrimp, chicken terriyaki, and fried chicken were excellent tasting.   Reasonable lunch cost at 12.99 decent choice in the area."}
{"text":"Asia Feast has gone through several \"transformations\" since it's inception. Sadly to say, it's only taken a turn for the worse. It started as a great restaurant true to it's name serving several dishes from different regions of Asia. Few years later with a new management they've become centered on sushi primarily. Like pretty much every.other.restaurant. in the area.  Overall, their food isn't horrible, but the quality has definitely gone down. Sushi with avocados being delivered with a blackish colour. Meh.   For those buying a package with groupon it really isn't a bad deal at all, especially with the AYCE buffet.   Personally, I won't be visiting here any time soon, but a quick sushi run once in a while when my cravings run high is possibility."}
{"text":"I used to live very close to Asia Feast, so came here when I had emergency sushi cravings, but really, the food is really MEH.   The buffet area in the center, is available to those eating from the AYCE menu. I advise you  not to try any of the dishes in the middle. It's been out there for a long time. Fried dishes were no longer crispy, but soggy and stir fried items were laden with grease and stale.   Okay, so maybe the sushi would be better. Nope, I ordered some salmon sashimi, and there was fish bone in it! I almost choked on it because never have I had sashimi expecting there to be any fish bone.. The only things that were okay in this restaurant is the rolls/makis. Don't even order the \"cooked\" food, as everything is microwaved.   As for the service, it's hard to flag down a waitress when they're busy, and mind you, they're only busy because of recent Groupon deal otherwise the place was relatively empty before.   They're still in business because the owner also owns Go For Tea, Destiny, Wasabi...etc. But, seriously, if I had any business sense, I would close down this place.   Tip:  1.) They have free WiFi, you just need to ask the waitress for the password.  2.) They ALWAYS have the AYCE deal - four people can eat at the price of three."}
{"text":"Best sushi ever. Very very nice wait staff. Beautiful atmosphere and layout. Great for bigger parties or just a small get together. I had an awesome time."}
{"text":"If you read my reviews, you'll find that aside from taste, I care about value. If the food is not amazing, but the price is good, I can overlook that. But it probably won't get 5 stars. This explanation is like the perfect lead into my review of Asia Feast Sushi Bar. It's a good place to fill your AYCE sushi cravings but it's not really remarkable in any way.   First of all, if you're going to an AYCE place, you shouldn't be expecting super high quality food. It's like going to McDonalds and complaining that their burgers aren't filled with steaks. With AYCE places, you generally get what you paid for. If you don't get what you paid for, that's when you have a legitimate reason to deduct stars. More expensive places have greater selection and may display their food better. Cheaper places often stuff their rolls/sushi with tons of rice and give you very little material. Asia Feast is neither terribly pricey, nor are they terrible in quality. And for this reason, I'm able to recommend this place. You WILL get what you paid for, provided that your expectations are realistic. You're in GTA. You're not going to get super fresh fish, especially at an AYCE place.  Second of all, all this talk about service is mostly stemming from CULTURE. Asian people in general are NOT picky about service. There's no tip in Asia. They care mostly about the food first, and ambiance second. I don't find their service that bad. Sure, they don't really speak English very well. But they have yet to screw up my orders. I've been here 5 times because it's fairly close to my house.   In terms of selection, my only complaint is that they don't actually have Red Tuna fish, despite some of their menu items claiming they use it, and their poster outside has red tuna in it. I ordered rainbow dragon roll and clearly there's no red tuna fish in it. I'm impressed that they have scallop sashimi but it's not that delicious so it's not a big deal to me. All I really need are staples like salmon, mackerel, and white tuna. Anything else is really just a bonus to me.   The only noticeable flaw with this restaurant is that they auto charge 15% tip on your bill. I accidentally over tipped them once but I blamed myself....still...I don't like places that do this. Another flaw is that google maps seems to screw up the location for this place. Not the restaurant's fault...but the first time I came, I got lost.   The reason I keep coming back here is because it's close to my house. That's all. I've tried tons of AYCE sushi places and most of them are very similar so I have little reason to choose one over another."}
{"text":"This place is garbage, don't waste your money. The half price days is even way too much money.  The food is awful, slapped together and the poorest quality.  Service is terrible and the sushi chef horked a loud spit in the garbage can in the middle of the dining room.  Totally gross.   Will never go back not even if it is free.  So bad. I can't see this place being in business too much longer."}
{"text":"1st visit: Good Food; service-mediocre.  The first time I came here, it was a Wed afternoon, at around 430pm. I came with two of my girlfriends and we were the only customers on that day. Our food came promptly at first, but then all the servers disappeared and only one girl walked in and out occasionally to see if we had left yet. When we were ready to pay, a manager suddenly appeared and  gave us our discount and told us it HAD to be paid in cash (because we paid with a coupon that they had put in flier form around town). We each put in a $20, he came back and then disappeared with our money. We waited for 20mins and then asked for our change. The girl was again the only one on the floor and after another 10mins, she came back, said sorry and gave us our change.  2nd visit: Food was good; service-good.  The second time I came here, it was a Sunday evening, at around 8pm. It was kind of busy that day. I came with 10 other people and we were celebrating my friend's birthday. The food came quickly, servers were attentive and everything seemed to be going smoothly. The food also tasted good. When we saw the table beside us get their dessert order, we wanted what they got. It was a bowl of watermelon pieces and then some jello. So, we ordered that but the waitress said that they ran out of watermelon and there was only one bowl of jello left. So we ordered ice-cream instead. We asked for the bill and was given the deal (4 people = only pay for 3 people deal) so 2 of our friends got to eat for free. It was great to split the cost down that way and overall, we said the main courses made up for not having what we wanted for dessert and price wise, we were satisfied for a weekend dinner.  3rd visit: Food sucked; service? AWFUL.  The third time I came here, it was a Sunday evening, at around 730pm. I came with my family (6 people in total) There were many empty tables, so I'm thinking it wasn't busy. I also assumed that I knew how this restaurant worked. I mean, I had been here 3 times; not too much could have changed during that time, right? WRONG.   Everything we ordered came out in tiny tiny tiny tiny TINY pieces. If we ordered anything that involved a bit of heating, it would take an extra 20mins to come out (we didn't know this; after 15mins of having no food, we would ask if something we ordered was coming out, and that's when they said it would take another 20mins). We didn't get a few things that we ordered, and a few times, the same waitress would bring things that we didn't order at all. What made it even more fun was that none of the waitresses who served us (3 in total) spoke English or Cantonese (which is the dialect that my grandmother speaks)  Dessert, let me tell you, WAS A FARCE. The table beside us had warm, sweet tofu cups (a very nice dessert that is usually served at dim sum restaurants too) so when we noticed that their server spoke a bit of English, we asked the girl if we could get it as well, since it wasn't on the menu. She tells us \"Oh, no. That is going to take a VERY very long time to make and we're about to close.\" First off, it's an AYCE restaurant, don't BS diners into thinking your desserts are made-to-order, I mean, you have jello on there, for goodness sakes -_-ll that's just soooo stupid. Secondly, the website AND the menu both have the time of closing on it. It said that they were open until 10pm on Sundays and holidays blahblahblah. We asked her about the tofu at 830pm.   Whatever. We decided on some ice cream instead and then asked for the bill. The manager (I recognized him because of my first visit) comes out and gives the bill to my dad. He had written in red pen \"CASH ONLY\" because he had given us a \"senior's discount\" since he saw my grandmother sitting at our table. The bill also indicated that the manager had already added in 13% gratuity when the menu distinctly put that they would include a 10% gratuity on top. My dad said it's fine, since it's customary nowadays to tip the same amount as tax. The manager hovered over my dad until he put the money into the black case and ran off.   The final amount was $132 and my dad put in $140. It may have been petty, but there was still change to be given back. I mean, the guy already added everything on top of our total on the bill, right? After 20mins of waiting, we were dressed and ready to leave. Our waitress asked us if we were still waiting for the fried rice that never came (yah, that's also depressing) We said, we were waiting for our change. She runs to find the manager, comes back with the black case; our change was inside it. She said the manager went to eat and forgot to give it to us.  Needless to say, we're not coming back. My suggestion? If you want to eat exactly what you ordered, DON'T COME HERE!"}
{"text":"My first attempt to visit was 40min before closing and the owner/manager was closing up saying it was already passed the closing time, which was not. The tone and volume of his voice was not welcoming at all.  I've eaten here twice, after my first visit with awful and rude service (food was mediocre at best). I decided to go back since it's so close to my house to give it another shot.    The heavy set manager/owner was rude (again!) demanding any coupons while we were eating and dropping the bill on the table before we even finished our food. It wasn't even busy!  I ordered the fried udon the first time it was decent but nothing to praise about and the second visit I had the ramen which a little bland.   The restaurant itself seems modern enough, clean and overall speediness of service was a little slow and requests for extra tea were very slow or did not come at all."}
{"text":"Came here last night with my family as we had a Groupon and they love Sushi, especially if it is AYCE  I give high marks for honesty and quality in my food   Location: i have never been to this part of Vaughan so was a bit surprised to see a strip mall here.   Decor: i loved the airy and modern decor.  Service: we had two servers and they were just fantastic and also took some time to practice their english with us. The place was not full but then it was a tuesday night  Menu: what has become the normal for these restaurants is a really weak sushi and sashimi selection. It is the cost vs revenue factor. So do not expect to find Tuna , Eel or other expensive cuts  Creativity and Food presentation: i like to see the chefs take some pride and WOW it up and surprise us a bit. They did do this on a couple of dishes.  Food Quality: we worked our way around the menu with selections from each area.  Generous rice bowl was more than enough with a pile of unexpected baby shrimps  Surf clam sashimi was bigger pieces than normal and was served teepee style  Specialty rolls were good and a smaller size roll. I actually prefer this as you can try other items. I have never seen a roll with yams in it and it was good.  Avocado salad was a fresh lettuce salad with sliced avocado on top.   Grilled Korean beef was awesome. Definately had been marinated.  Chicken Yakitori didnt come grilled on skewers for some odd reason  Fried Bananas were small portions but should be as at the end of a AYCE marathon this could be easily left on the plate  Ice cream was a huge portion  Udon Soup was good with generous toppings  Tempura choices were good and had a crisp coating as expected  Except for the korean beef that i enjoyed the rest was relatively decent ho hum middle of the road food that you would expect at these places. This is where we get into a price play and some consumers want lowest price and others want highest quality. In the Japanese AYCE experience you cannot have both or if so i havent found it.  Their dinner price is $19.95 and they add a 10% service charge automatically.   I found the service, decor, food quality and menu creativity to have made for a good dining experience."}
{"text":"The sushi/maki is poor (avocado was all brown for example) the hot food is not very good (even edamame tasted weird) and the service is mediocre. The way you order is different than other restaurants and very annoying.  Only decent thing was the sashimi which tasted pretty much normal. The restaurant itself looks nice and seemed clean."}
{"text":"DO NOT COME HERE. Don't let the mixed reviews fool you. I decided to try this place because of a Groupon.  Honestly,the food itself is decent for an all-you-can-eat sushi place......but the service is absolutely horrid.  Our food took forever to arrive. What kind of sushi buffet place has ONE sushi chef and ONE waitress on a Saturday night?!?! That just makes absolutely no business sense.  The place wasn't even busy. The we're a decent number of tables,  but to make customers wait an hour for an order is just ridiculous! Try this place at your own risk. My meal has currently lasted more than 2 hours and I'm not even 50% full. We ran out of tea and they took our teapot and never brought it back until I asked 30 minutes later.  We have been without soy sauce for a good 45 minutes.....Not that it matters since we have been without food for the same amount of time.  Come at your own risk."}
{"text":"Went on a weekend, where the menu says they offer butter shrimp.  Well, we were there on a Sunday, which in Cananda is considered a weekend, but we were told it is only available on weekends.  Sounded like an Abbott and Costello movie.  Not availablethis weekend   For an AYCE, there weren't enough choices to fill a cavity. Too many other p,aces to go to that offer great food.  Stay away from this one and save your money."}
