{"text":"Please do not make the mistake of coming here if you are looking for vegan food options, even though the menu has a section vegan.  Lunch time offers that are vegan on the buffet only include iceberg lettuce and white rice.  So I asked if I could order from the menu, he said I could but the chef was very busy with a catering order, so it would be an hour wait.  I over heard the chef telling the server that \"he could not remember what items on the food bar did not have gee\" or were made without animal products.  BTW the server did not know what Ghee was, so if you have any food allergies stay away!"}

{"text":"I am giving one star because of the comedy show last night.  First of all, the show didn't start at 9 PM sharp as advertised. It was more like 9:40.  I was drinking a diet soda, asked for another and never got it.  Most importantly, when Ricky Byrne finally started, he was distinctly unfunny and offensive.  We left before the real comics came on because we couldn't tolerate his \"humor\" anymore.  There was an uncomfortable feeling in the room and not a single laugh.  We have never walked out of a show before and are not easily offended but that was just painful.  Ricky is a cute, like able guy off stage but on stage, he was awful.  We won't be back.  We are fans of stand up comedy - I don't know what his act was supposed to be, but it wasn't comedy."}
