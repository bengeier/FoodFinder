{"text":"I love Sugar N' Spices deserts, especially their waffles. The cooks there do a great job at giving you a big crafty plate.
On the other hand, the customer service given by the servers is not that great. I remember coming in with my girlfriend 30 minutes before closing and the waitress and other staff mumbling profanities. It didn't really bother us, we still enjoyed our crepe and waffle:)"}
{"text":"I came here looking for Demetres but since I'm not from the area and since Yelp listing was out of date, I had to circle around a couple of times before realizing that there was no longer a Demetres and instead a Sugar N Spice.  I ordered a Belgian waffle and my boyfriend ordered a crepe.  We both came to the consensus that the batter was bland and had no taste.  Also, the ice cream did not taste creamy and fresh.  Overall, I've had better."}
{"text":"I came here looking for Caffe Demetre, but I found Sugar n Spice. I guess that means Caffe Demetre is gone. You can still get crepes, waffles, ice cream sundaes and etc like at demetres, but the menu isn't as extensive (nor colorful). My friend and I opted for the first menu item... which was MAKE YOUR OWN CREPE. You get to choose an ice cream flavor, 3 toppings (Fruits, cookies, brownies etc) and sauces (or whatever they're called, I forgot). I think it was about $10 (+ 85 cents for a waffle)  

Service was slow. My server probably was the host as well so getting his attention and then asking him to come over took well over 25 minutes, after he gave me the \"one second\" gesture twice. Once we placed our orders, the desserts came pretty quickly. Presentation wasn't as good as Demetres, not that it really made a difference. I did, however, care that the utensils were sticky to the touch and evidently not clean.

The crepe and waffles were just meh. The cookies and creme ice cream was overly sweet while the chocolate hazelnut ice cream was ... kind of bitter actually... how is that even possible?? Bananas were overly ripe and strawberries were much too sour. 

Overall my experience was very unpleasant and I would never return"}
{"text":"I love this place and have eaten here ever since they opened it. The waffles and crepes are delicious and the ice cream is super creamy! Now they added sandwiches to the menu so it got even better. The staff is very good and always treat nicely every time I come here."}
{"text":"I use to work very near the Sugar N Spice Cafe so after work me and my coworkers would sometimes head here once in a while for a treat once our shifts were over. We were going here when the place use to be called Demetres, but for some reason they switched to Sugar N Spice. That wasn't a problem for us since we would only go there for desserts which they didn't change (same recipe & price!). I'd always get the Belgian waffle with vanilla ice cream, strawberries, whip cream, and strawberry sauce drizzled which is around $14 but worth it, the portion is HUGE! We'd work 8 hour shifts and be starving by the end, come here, be full, and still have a bit left over. Inside is pretty nice, the wait staff is always super nice and a good chunk of the waiters are gorgeous! Service can be slow sometimes but they are pretty busy so I don't really expect any different, just be sure to ask for the check a little earlier than when you actually want to leave so you won't be waiting for 20 minutes."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my lunch quite a bit, My daughter and I shared a tuna sandwich, and she had a Cesar salad, tomato-garlic soup and we both shared a mango milk shake..
we are from the states, and was there on vacation to visit my husband's friends and family.  My daughter and I were extremely hungry!  But that aside our trip was very pleasurable and if we lived in the area would definitely return.  The restaurant is not a gourmet experience but simple and enjoyable.

3 and 1/2 half stars!"}
{"text":"A great little cafe with a great vibe. Went here with two dear friends for a bit of dessert. You can customize your waffles or crepes with generous servings of ice cream, fruit or other baked foods. Cake slices are plentiful. I had a slice of red velvet cake. The cream cheese frosting was delightful. 
The wait staff is great - we sat there for a few hours and weren't rudely interrupted by staff. 
Great atmosphere. Will definitely visit again."}
