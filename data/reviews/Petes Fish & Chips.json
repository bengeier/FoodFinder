{"text":"Good food but don't expect sea food for the price. All fried food, new location. Is much nicer than the old one.

I give it 3 stars.....

Best location in town for quick chicken or shrimp , drive through takes forever at dinner time!"}
{"text":"Just had lunch there today, first time. Good service. Sat outdoors with misters, felt great. I ordered the 2 piece fish with the 7 shrimps. While the fish was OK, it did not come with tartar sauce. The shrimps were over breaded and dry. I will pass and try someplace else for fish and chips. Sorry"}
{"text":"Pre-made frozen products. Cash only is a little questionable. The price of the food is high for cafeteria quality. I'd say it's comparable to hospital food but fried."}
{"text":"To call this fish and chips is SOOO wrong.  Its nothing like fish and chips should be.  Go to George and Dragon in Phoenix if you want real fish and chips.  Greasy squares of fish is disgusting."}
{"text":"Save yourself the drive and just buy some Mrs. Paul's fish squares. This is not my idea of fish and chips. No fish filet here just a deep fried square of processed fish."}
{"text":"Only 1star cause u have to give it to leave a comment lol!!!!!!!!
It's all fake food...u have To pay extra for all condiments they don't give u anything with your fake fish they set themselves up for failure WOW DONT Believe the hype 
I do need to say that the 2$ Walmart burrito is hilarious & at least you get to laugh after you get screwed"}
{"text":"Ok.  It is Arizona, but the fish in my fish and chips were frozen patties (about the size of a deck of cards).  And no ketchup!  I mean my fries cried out for ketchup, but alas, the cries went unheaded.  What I got was Pete sauce.  Which is a watery ketchup  concoction. It didn't  taste bad, but was disconcerting nonetheless."}
{"text":"This place is crap ! Why are they still open all these year? Service sucks food sucks! Only eat here if you want to get sick."}
{"text":"My all time favorite fast food place to eat while visiting Phoenix. You don't think of fish when you think of the desert but believe me, it's good! My Kids & I order the shrimp & chips with extra sauce and my Husband orders the burger and fries. Everything on the menu is tasty especially with the Pete's secret spicy sauce.
 I love Pete's Fish & Chips!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Very affordable, I always get the shrimp with extra sauce. It looks much better than before, a lot bigger. The only downside is they don't take credit cards but they do have an ATM inside."}
{"text":"Good fish fry place. I've also had there Monster Burger- delish."}
{"text":"Hoping I do not get sick after that meal... Absolutely the worst fish and chips I have ever had! Literally was the most awful, bland, under cooked meal! Avoid! I should have pulled up the reviews before coming here! How is everyone saying this place is the best food ever??? Will never go back!"}
{"text":"Used to come here as a kid when they served fresh chucks of cod with a flaky crust wrapped in newspaper. Yum! Nothing resembling that now. I understand the absence of newspaper, but now it is a thin square of processed mystery crap with lots of awful breading. I tried a bite and threw the rest away. Yuck!"}
{"text":"This place is truly a common component in your diet if you grew up in the vicinity of a Pete's Fish n' Chips. 

I've always ordered the fish n' chips, recently adding shrimp to the mix. The fish is in a rectangular shape and the breading is always a nice golden color. Pete's isn't doing anything fancy here and yet it has remained to be a local favorite since 1947! L-O-V-E the Pete's sauce (its pato sauce and ketchup.) and it's a great spicy ketchup kinda deal. Way better than any cocktail sauce. The fish and fries have a good amount of salt on them and I think that's all they use for seasoning. It's simple and good. The fish and shrimp can be a bit greasy, but it is to be expected when you are eating fried food. But I don't think it is nowhere near as greasy as its competitor Long John Silver.


Way back I know I've had the burritos and monster burgers, but given the name of a place you might wanna guess what is best to stick with. 


I'll take Pete's over any other fish n' chip place!

Ps, It's CASH ONLY."}
{"text":"Pete's has always have the wrost service, especially the one in Tolleson due to it being a bunch of kids missing around in the kitchen. The food is pretty much all fired and is always missing salt. The burger are good and is actually the only good thing there except for their ketchup. All locals know that it is cash only and no refills."}
{"text":"My husband and I went expecting real hand battered fish, not a frozen patty from Costco and bland fries. A real let down. And they'd don't have any malt vinegar or even ketchup and their cup of sauce is just watered down cheap cocktail sauce. Not what we remember Pete's being like, the owners are clearly more interested in making a large profit than serving a quality product, which will eventually hurt their business by driving customers away. In addition, that only accept cash and the ATM on site charges $3 for a transaction. We will no go back."}
{"text":"Pete's is seriously addicting! The fish is crunchy and hot, but the fry's are a little lackluster. You can tell they fry the fish to order because everytime it takes about 10-15 minutes to get your food even in the drive thru. Hate that they don't take credit cards though!"}
{"text":"I really don't know what all the hype is about this place. I was psyched to eat here because of the good reviews on Yelp and everyone at my job seems to be pretty crazy about it. I paid almost $10 for some fish, shrimp, fries and a drink. Blech. The fish is a square patty that seems to be breaded with panko or something. I was hoping for real batter dipped fish strips. Nope. The shrimp were alright, probably the best thing I had there. The fries were overcooked, brown and flavorless. Long John Silvers' seafood is better than this, and that is NOT saying much at all. The only thing I can give them is that the food was very hot/freshly cooked. Maybe I'm underwhelmed because I'm from Florida and am used to fresh seafood??? I'm glad I tried it but won't be back again."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed in the fish. Being from the south I expected something different especially when they had a line around the building. It was not worth the wait or the money. I could definitely show them a thing or two about how to fry good fish!"}
{"text":"I know they all have Pete's sauce, but this joint's is best, SPICY.... You can order burgers, fish and chips, chicken tenders, corn dogs, the menu is huge. This place has been \"upgraded\" from the old stand style shop to a bigger building with more covered outdoor seating. Pete's isn't a gourmet style shop, so if that's your ticket, punch it elsewhere. If you want some deep fried crispy fish and chips, or a great burger this place is certainly good for that."}
{"text":"Most of the servers don't wear proper protection when handling food. Disgusting server s."}
{"text":"Woe is me. I have been coming to Pete's since I was a wee one and always got a burrito and fries. I have recently revisited and...the burritos have changed for the worse. The burritos are completely different, they now have a really crappy cheese and a whole hecka lot of beef. I never quite knew what was inside the burritos, I suspected beef, but now it is almost pure beef. The sauce is still the same, the fries are still the same, but the burritos are sheer disappointment."}
{"text":"I think most people give this place more stars because they grew up going here, but let's be real, their fish is barely a step above a McDonald's fish filet. This place is getting 2 stars for atmosphere and service. I liked their setup and service was pretty fast and accurate, even with a line.  Definitely the only redeemable thing going for this place. For food, I would give it zero. Awful fish...I was dumbfounded to pay $20 for something I could have bought in the frozen fish section at Fry's for $7. Nostalgia would not be enough to bring me back to this place. Horrible."}
{"text":"I use to LOVE this place but one thing has really pushed me away from going to petes anymore... The chicken tenders. They use to be fantastic. Then they changed them.. Now the chicken tenders are horrible. The batter that they use on the chicken tenders is just gross. So that being said I still absolutely love their shrimp still.  Me being the fatty, I use to get half shrimp, half chicken tenders and fries. It was sooo good. But now I just don't bother to go anymore.  I literally miss those tenders so bad. This was one of the only places I went to when I went on my food runs, or after the movies with my buds. Now its like the dark ages for me, lol. Now I have since fallen into a deep depression because of my o so precious tenders. Le sigh...WHY PETES DID U GET RID OF YOUR Old TENDERS!!!!!!! Wwwhhhyyyyyy :( /sadface"}
{"text":"This is not real fish and chips. More like fried fish sticks from Wal Mart. Come on now... Gross nice set up thou"}
{"text":"Cash only, so that way you have to use their ATM and pay the fee if you are a first timer. That would be OK if the food is good, but it's not. Ordered the monster burger one time and it was overcooked and dry. Onion rings are greasy. Fish was OK. But real fish fillets are not square, so you know it was processed. Fries were average and they are generous with the Quantities. Prices are cheap.  I guess they think their spicy ketchup is great (it's not, and they charge more for extra) but no tarter sauce and Heinz ketchup. Comes down to you get what you pay for. The Friday fish fry at the church during lent is way better than this."}
{"text":"Think school lunch fish sticks. Shrimp was unrecognizable in the clumpy batter.  The fish was minced cod or haddock and looked like something out of the freezer section at your local grocer.  Tatar sauce (extra 30 cents for a 2 Oz serving) was tasty, but nothing could save the meals we ordered from being disappointing.  I don't know why so many people seem to eat there regularly unless they miss school cafeteria fish sticks.  Definitely a place to skip."}
{"text":"Frozen fish patty, mystery fish perhaps.  I was expecting a batter dipped fish filet but it was more like a square of processed something that may have been fish. If you truly enjoy \"fish and chips\" just pass on this place. Had to put a star rating but it did not rate a star."}
{"text":"The sauce makes this review 3 stars. It was the only good thing about this place. Fish was okay, not much flavor and it was a fried fish square. Shrimp was not good, they take a small piece of shrimp slice it down the middle and batter it long ways 10 times. So you end up with batter and a little shrimp. 

Good price though. Everything is cheap."}
{"text":"The food is horrible.  Fish is a flat square that was overcooked and too hard to eat. Shrimp had no taste except for the mud vein. I guess if you want nasty food, this is the place to go. By the way, my cats wouldn't eat the shrimp when I tried to feed it to them"}
{"text":"Oh wow ! I hear about this place a lot.... I went to get some burgers and shrimp. Well , what can I say ... I try to look for something positive on places I go eat, this place it was disappointing .... I go Order ,they tell me cash only... then I go drive to a bank teller for $$ , so I order, then Kids are playing around the kitchen ,I was like what the... few minutes later my order is ready. OK, lets see here , Oh Man! my Burger is so dry and one side is kinda burnt, the Shrimp !! all I had is the breading ..where is the Shrimp !! .... Sorry Pete if you still around , It really SUCK !  This place stands out by it's name only and the food it's like not the best ........ not coming back, for Pete's sake do something about it."}
{"text":"Consistant yummy deep fried goodness every time. This place for me is for the days my stress levels are super high. I like Petes for take out at this location. Not so much to eat at but for take out. They are making a new Pete's next door to the current location on Van Buren. So I'm hoping they level the current location & have some actual parking. That would just rock. This place is so busy at meal times it's hard to find a spot that the dirve thru doesn't block you in. Not that this would be a bad place to be stuck per say but... you'd have to roll me out if you left me there too long The burgers, fish, shrimp & sauce are all good. Now stop reading & get to eating your deep fried goodness."}
{"text":"Good stuff! Especially love their sauce, goes with everything - only bummer they don't accept credit cards, cash only....they need to fix that. We're living in the 21st century for goodness sakes!"}
{"text":"The only reason I put one star is because I had to rate something.  We tried to eat here a couple months ago but quickly realized it was \"cash only.\"  I'm curious as to how much business they are losing. Anyway we finally tried it out today and oh my it was horrible.  The fish looked and tasted like they have been frozen and the shrimp were so tasteless.  We paid $30 plus tax for three meals and I was so disgusted that I contemplated taking the food back. Also the no lettuce and tomato?  What is up with that?  We absolutely hated it and won't be back...something just sounds too fishy."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for some fish and chips and this place had some decent reviews and had been around for 30 years so I decided to give it a try.  The place was clean and the staff was friendly.  That ends the good portion of the review.  Going to a fish and chip place I expected more, much more.  I watched as they put my square frozen fish in the fryer.  Yes, it is square. The fish looked and tasted similar to the ones called filet of fish at the golden arches.  They just costed a bit more.  Maybe they thought it was a step up since they added a small cup of their special red sauce.  What bothered me most is that they seem to nickel and dime you for everything.  Drink refills and even tartar sauce. They charge you for \"extra sauce\".  I never got tarter sauce in the first place so it should not have been extra sauce.  They think because I got their red sauce any sauce after that was extra I guess.  I never asked for red sauce, as a matter of fact the sauce would be better for shrimp, fish needs tartar.  Should have been asked when the order was placed what sauce I wanted.  If one wants real fish and chips in the local area I would head over to Ava's.  This visit was disappointing and barely a step up from McDonalds."}
{"text":"Family has been going to Petes for YEARS! . Big portions. Decent prices. Very clean patio. Cash only kind of sucks but doesn't hurt to stop at a ATM which they have onsite. Everyone was nice. In AZ summers it does suck to eat outside but they have fans and you can feel a slight breeze from inside. I always get the chicken tenders but my husband does the seafood. Both always good. *no ketchup * would be nice to have it for the kids as the sauce is a bit spicy for the little ones but that's just Petes!!! We will be back!"}
{"text":"finally got a chance to try this place out, and I'm pleased to say that it is pretty darn good. 

while spending an evening with the in-laws, we ordered from Pete's. I had the scallops & chips(but with onion rings), which was good--the scallops were tender and juicy, but with a perfect breading; on the other hand, the breading on the onion rings was not what I was looking for--WAY too crunchy, and a bit difficult to eat.

the special sauce was alright, but a bit of a let-down. it was more of a spicy ketchup than anything truly special(I would have preferred some sort of sweet-spicy remoulade).

the big plus for Pete's is the COST. super cheap, quality seafood; super cheap burgers; super cheap everything. 

their fries were also pretty darn good(though they could have used a bit more salt, which I didn't hesitate to add).

we'll definitely be ordering from Pete's again; we're dying to try the Dixie Dog, and I'll likely have a hankering for oysters soon."}
{"text":"Not sure why anyone is leaving anything more than a one star. Paid 19$ for 2 meals.  Prison food is better than this. Rather drive 20 miles and go to long john silvers. Then to boot cash only and u have to pay even more if u want tarter sauce. Really I ordered fish should come with it.  Go to Fry's and get fish TV dinner u will be more satisfied."}
{"text":"I will come to this place even when I'm 90 years old. I grew up eating Pete's Fish and Chips and nothing has changed as far as my love for it. I love the fish, crabettes, scallops, shrimp, onion rings, and fries. Even though this is a fish and chips restaurant, their monster burgers are superb!! My husband gets the chicken strips every time we go and he LOVES them. Something about their jalapenos too. They are always better than the ones I have at home. Don't even get me started on their Pete's sauce. It is the BEST!!
This location usually has had nice people working there, unlike the other Pete's restaurants.  
Pete's is so dang good though that I'll always go back, regardless of the awful service at the other locations. That says a lot about their food."}
{"text":"Excellent food, not as good as fish and chips from Australia but excellent none the less. Wish they had pineapple fritters or potatoes scallops..
I did Sri e though girls are pleaaant, but while waiting for my food I hear the 'F' word, thankfully 4 year old was not on the car. Talk about boyfriends, substitute teachers and so on. If it were my business or I was the manager I'd have the girls engage with the cuatomers, how is your day going is this your first time, no up selling nothing. ."}
{"text":"I like pete's fish and chip. I really do. I go to other locations and enjoy it. I come to this one because it's close to my work and I usually like to be quick so drive thru. This time around I decided to eat in and that was a terrible idea. The person taking my order was just awful. I get trying to sale me more but you gotta be at least engaging. His idea of selling me a brownie and me politely declining is to insult me by asking me if I'm on a diet and smirk right after. I love the food but forget coming to this location is my recommendation. I won't be eating here again."}
{"text":"I love this place.. That's all I can say.. My family and I have been coming here for years. DO NOT ASK FOR KETCHUP because they don't have it, the Petes sauce is all you need! I always get two burritos and a regular fry. The service does need work but I'm there for the food so I tend to ignore they're bland attitudes. I'm glad to see a local business grow, love the new expansion. I will always recommend and go back."}
{"text":"I never been to a Fish, and Chips place because where I'm from they didn't have them. Someone told me that if I want to try them, I must come here. So I did, and I loved it! it was bomb. The fish was real good, and the fries were bomb too. They also have this special sauce. It is so addictive, you have to come and try this place out. 

Other cool thing is that this place is sorta retro, and reminds you of the 1950's. They only except cash just like the ol days too! They need to change this though for us people living in the 21st century."}
{"text":"ATTENTION PHONECIANS: If you live in AZ and don't like Pete's than you might be a looser. Been eating here before I was born, my mom said she ate here almost daily while pregers with me......thanks again mom! It must be why I love this place! Pete's is an Arizona Institution, been around for 70 years. There are a ton of copy cats......I won't name names but they are listed in the same catagory and they will NEVER come close to this one of a kind golden gem.....so don't waste your time with the copy cats, just head to Pete's!

I live in PHX so I go to the Buckeye location on the wknd with the kiddos, best place to bring kids! But I work in Mesa so I usually go to the Mesa Location, which is sometimes super crazy busy, the parking and lines of people are cut throat, but if you happen to go at an off time like 3:00 or right before closing, you'll be in and out real quick. I suggest getting the shrimp or the messy fish sandwich with frings! My kids love the chicken tenders and burritos.

Hands down, Pete's is the best! ps, they don't take credit cards but pretty sure they have atm's, so bring cash if you don't want to pay the dumb atm fee."}
{"text":"So disgusting. Everyrhing is fried. The greese is so old and dirty that the taste of it will stay with you for hours. So yuk and also no katsup, no service , there is no posted sign but they only take cash. The fried chicken strips were half cartilage and fat. The fried shrimp doesnt look like shrimp, maybe ground shrimp. Such a horrible experience, there are no words."}
{"text":"Like another reviewer here, I was very excited to try this place out. I travel to Phoenix several times a year and I always saw the place on my way to the rental car return. There are always lots of cars going through and while I waited for my order I noticed tons of cars rolling through. These are usually good signs for an eating establishment.

Imagine my disappointment when I realized that folks in Phoenix don't know what fish and chips are. I was expecting real fish and chips, not some odd square facsimile of fish. Fish filets are NOT square. If i had wanted this I could have just gone to Long J. Silvers or Captian D's. I'm not saying I'm a fish and chips aficionado but I've eaten fish and chips all over the country and this is NOT fish and chips. Go have some fish and chips in New England (anywhere in NE) and you'll find out what fish and chips should be.

 I'll admit that the sauce is good and if I had some real fish and chips to dip it in, I'd enjoy it even more. I can only chalk this up to a regional thing but I'll definitely give this place a pass the next time I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I love Pete's Fish n Chips. They have great food. Always the same quality no matter how long it takes u to get back to this Pete's in Tolleson."}
{"text":"I used to live in England.  For fear of disappointment, I hadn't tried any local (west side) fish and chip places until I recently started craving it big time.

My first stop was Ada's Fish Fry in Goodyear.  I gave them 4 out of 5 last week (perfect except for a lack of flavor in the batter) but had to be fair to other local competitors so I stopped in today at Pete's in Tolleson because my wife tells me some of her friends really like Pete's.

I hit the Pete's drive thru at about 12:40 pm today (Tuesday).  Ordered a 3-piece Fish and Chips with large Dr Pepper.  Drove around to the window, paid (cash only at Pete's), and my food was immediately handed to me.  Clearly it's made ahead of time and sits waiting for customers to pick up, which is a big no-no if you're looking for decent fish and chips.  You can't fry something and have it waiting for customers.  Since nobody was in the drive-thru when I got there, there's no telling how long it may have been sitting before I got there.

Took it home (10 minute drive) and opened the bag to a major disappointment.  The fish were rectangles, much like you'd buy in the frozen section of Albertson's.  The fries were typical frozen, fast-food variety and were cooked okay.  The food was all hot and the fish was certainly crispy, but it all reminded me of something a school lunchroom might serve on Fridays.  The fish \"fillet\" was maybe half an inch thick and pretty dry with heavy, crispy breading.

The price was reasonable for regular fish and chips, but $8+ was way too much for frozen fish and frozen fries.

I'll not be eating at Pete's again, and if you want decent fish and chips I'd recommend you look elsewhere.  Looks like Ada's still reigns as the best on the west side.  I'll keep looking and if I find someplace better I'll update this review."}
{"text":"What the hell IS this? I feel like Im in a school  cafeteria! Square frozen fish fillets? I dont even buy this crap in grocery stores! Captin D's has better fish than this! THEN tarter sauce is extra? GTFOH...

I added a star because the food cane out hot, and Pete's sauce is pretty good...still not enough though."}
{"text":"It's sad I love going to Pete's  but this location is the worst I've had enough finally tired of never getting my order correct I usually just blow it off but I finally actually called them about it  then they wanna argue about making it right, it's nice they worked on the remodel but maybe they should of spent the effort on taking time to make orders right the first time and improve the employees customer service. If I could give them a 0 star I would!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"It's Pete's yo!  If you don't know, you should.  No frills, fried food.  I usually get my combo's with Frings, fries and onion rings, and top off my Pete's sauce with a few dashes of Tapatio."}
{"text":"I liked it but def not for the price at allllll. When I went there during a busy night (before it was remodeled) I waited with a friend for about an hour in the drive thru! It was insane and the parking lot at the time was so small once you were in the line there was no getting out... And thank the Lord I had cash on me  - No cards accepted. I understand it's been around for awhile but def over rated for the price.."}
{"text":"Cash only, no drink refills, no phone orders, no ketchup, 90% breading 10% shrimp, and frozen fish. No thanks. Hey Pete, can I get my money back?"}
{"text":"Highly dissapointed. Had the shrimp, and all it is is a little piece of shrimp covered with a ton of breading. No taste. Honestly taste like frozen breaded dinasaur shrip from walmart. I'm not kidding. Not as advertised."}
{"text":"I've eaten a Pete's off and on over the years and always thought they had pretty good food.  If you're looking for traditional \"fish and chips\", they way they serve it back East, you might be disappointed; however, if you're open to trying something new, you might be pleasantly surprised.  

The real action at Pete's is in the fish and shrimp.  I'm not a big fan of their fries because I like  more McDonald's like crispy fry.  The key to their success has got to be the sauce, which I think is the best in the business.

One last thing, if you go to Pete's understand that Pete likes cash and doesn't take credit cards.  Yes, it's a pain, but the non-greasy food is going to be worth the hassle."}
{"text":"I've grown up eating at Pete's Fish and Chips with family and friends, so it holds a special place in my memory and heart. I live in Mesa Az so typically if I do decide to eat there it's at the Mesa Dr location. Every time I go there the cashier taking my order is almost always disrespectful and rude. I don't ever get chicken tenders but my friends who do always complain about how if we happen to be there on a Friday they Do Not sell them. (Is it really that hard to deep fry some chicken tenders.) All in all that Pete's location is a disappointment... The location on Buckeye Rd in  Phoenix Az is not. I happened to be in the area when I stopped by to have lunch and was expecting the same treatment that I receive from the other Pete's. I was shocked from the results... It seemed like everyone there was upbeat and happy. The cashier was so kind it was almost shocking. One of my best experiences at a FAST FOOD restaurant not just a fish and chips spot, EVER! I encourage anyone around the Sky Harbor Airport area who wants some excellent fish and chips and an excellent friendly atmosphere to swing by. Next time I'm in the mood I am actually gonna make the mission over to this location rather than go down the street to the sub par Pete's on Mesa Dr. Pete's on Buckeye Rd turned a bad day I was having into a great one and for that I thank them... Oh yea... They also serve chicken tenders on Friday. I salute you Pete's, peace."}
{"text":"I was told that Pete's was a good fish place by a co-worker that I haven't known for a very long time so today I went there for lunch I ordered a number one which is for shrimp and fish to my surprise I opened my bag and I thought that it was chicken strips so I took it back they stated that no that's how they do their shrimp their butterfly it I get back to work to eat my food and to my dismay the \"shrimp\" it's completely Bland there's barely any shrimp in nreading and the fish tasted like a packed fish patty. No seasoning , thick breading..not good at all. This was a waste of my lunch hour and $7"}
{"text":"Monster burgers are really good, make sure you have cash though, credit not accepted."}
{"text":"This \"Use\" to be my old hang out in high school. Use to love coming here and getting a monster burger wth extra pickle! Not no more. To be honest I'd rather take my money to a restaurant that's doesn't treat woman with such disrespect!
We were the \"ONLY\" family eating at 10am on a Monday morning and the kid taking our order was not pleasant and frankly spiteful. My two sons 4 yrs and 5 yrs and my 15 year old daughter got a table by the fans, he calls out our order we walk to pick it up, mind you the same kid took our order, he makes us go back to our table to get our ticket!! My comment to him was, \"was that really necessary we are the only people here!\" He comes back with a smart ass remark. Well guess what you can keep your ticket and your fried food! We won't ever be back! Ever!"}
{"text":"I love Pete's. I know, I know - you eat outside, you have to order tartar sauce and they only take cash. I love the food anyway. I've gone to Pete's since I was born. I love the red sauce that comes with the fish - it has a little bite to it. 

I only wish they would expand north. 

I'm addicted to Pete's."}
{"text":"Probably on of the best fish and chips I have ever had. My bf got me a to go order and it was soooooo yummy. The fish is cooked just right (not overdone) and the fries were well seasoned. Can't wait to go back to AZ and try them again."}
{"text":"The food is hot and the fish was crispy...that's about it. The fish lacked flavor. We decided to try the basics and if that was good we would try other items on the menu. The basics were fine, just didn't live up to the hype."}
{"text":"We came here back in June. I saw a random post about this place on Instagram and knew we'd be passing through, so we gave it a try! We loved it even though I'm such a wuss with the 110 degree heat! Here we are again, passing through with my mom and told her she had to try it! We got here after 3 and there wasn't really anybody here. We took a minute to order and the lady at the register was so patient with us. We all got fish and chips with extra sauce. Our food was fresh and hot, probably because we missed a rush. It was so good! I got horchata and it was a welcome icy treat from the spice from the sauce. I love the seating with picnic tables, as I like to people watch everyone walking by. I'm sad there isn't one closer to my house!"}
{"text":"Pete's, when you're just too lazy to heat up the fishsticks in your freezer. 
I was really expecting something more..."}
{"text":"As a child my mom would come after work and we would order either if it was drive in or eating outside on the patio. I give Petes Fish and Chips a high although we usually go to the one in old town Glendale. My husband is not from here so he doesnt enjoy it quite as much as I did as a kid. Lately I have noticed that they have really changed as far as the food quality. But there are good days and bad days for how the food is presented."}
{"text":"Pete's is more about the institution of Pete's than the food. As other reviewers mention, it's a breaded, fried, rectangular patty-o-fish. That's just fine if it's what you're after. It's cheap, quick, and atmospheric. We were satisfied with our snack. Watch out for the lunch and after work rushes. Busy!"}
{"text":"Sorry but Petes USE to be a place of choice for my family and me. Hadn't been here in a while. Seems like we won't be going back again. Unless they bring back the flavor and value that put Petes fish and chips on the map. WE WANT THE ORIGINAL PETES BACK! Why change a great thing and become anything but the best."}
{"text":"Great food!!! Fish, shrimp, burgers, burritos, etc! I've gone here since I was a little kid and need seemed to disappoint me! Introduced my boyfriend to Pete's and he loves it too! can't go wrong with shrimp and chips (fries) ! Got to try it!"}
{"text":"Tried this place out for date night with the husband and it was garbage. Ordered the seafood platter meal for  little over $9.  The fish was a  processed prefrozen square patty that tasted like it was out of a box. The French fries were cold  and the shrimp was plain weird. It was all batter with  shrimp particle in it. It looked like they took a piece of shrimp, cut it in four pieces and deep fried each with extensive batter to save money.  They advertised fried oysters and said they don't serve it. We asked for lemon, napkins and ketchup and they said they didn't have any.  The service was just as bad. Girl was rude and non accommodating at all.  Would not recommend place to anyone. Better off going to mcdonalds for the fish filet or long john silver for the money because this place was way too over rated and over priced for what it serves. Also the place was beyond filthy with crack heads hanging around. This place doesnt deserve any stars. That's how bad it was."}
{"text":"If your looking for a fine dining seafood experience this isn't it, but that's not what they claim to be. It's just one of those guilty pleasure experiences. Food is hot and fresh, processed and deep fried. Outdoor seating is a little uncomfortable and hot so eat fast or get it to go!"}
{"text":"I love this place have been going here since high school. I have tried almost everything on their menu. By accident got a chicken sandwich and now it has become our favorite. No skimpy chicken pattie. The shrimp, fish and monster burgers are great. No trans fats. We go to the one in glendale az."}
{"text":"Loved it!  That sauce is pretty awesome.  

Crispy coating on my shrimp stayed crispy and crunchy.  

I was a bit disappointed that they were out of oysters...but there's always next time.  I'm a bit embarrassed to say that even having lived in the valley for over 10 years, this was my first trip to Pete's.  I don't know why I waited so long!"}
{"text":"Always a great place to stop if not too busy. Food today was awesome. Not greasy at all. scallops were good size too. Still one of my favorite places for lunch!!!"}
{"text":"If you don't live in Tolleson, Pete's is pretty much the only reason to come here. But, it's a damn good reason. The fish is tender and tasty, the shrimp strip things are addictive, the chips have that perfect combination of crisp and soggy, the sauce has a delightful tang. The only place I've had better fish and chips is Ireland."}
{"text":"Petes is petes. I mean how can you really screw up already battered shrimp and fries. Just keep in mind that you will have more batter then shrimp. Their red sauce is good taste like a mixture of ketchup and pato sauce even though they say they don't carry ketchup. Just remember they only accept cash and have an atm there on site if needed. Clever idea I suppose."}
{"text":"First let me say, if you don't have cash, don't even bother coming here. They do not accept cards at all! They do however have an atm on site which charges you $2.50 per withdraw. Which I think is a bunch of BS. This is 2015. I don't understand what business does not accept cards.  On top of that, they do not carry lemons or limes which is a huge disappointment. What kind of place that sells fish does not have lemon or limes. Plus the food is not all that great. Do not recommend eating here at all."}
{"text":"I had ordered the number 1 with a raspberry tea.  4 shrimps,  1 fish,  and plenty of fries. I enjoyed myself.  Food came out hot and fresh and ready to be devoured"}
{"text":"Grease lovers unite!  I was there with my work team.  Food was hot, a little slower than expected but because we ordered more than $60 of food together we got a free t shirt!  How kitschy.   I'm assuming it was all fried in the same oil vat.  I had the #2 combo.  The fish and shrimp tasted the same.  2 hours after eating CRASH I was ready to pass out.  Fried foods are not my thing but for you Fry Daddies, rejoice.  Last pet peeve.  They don't take cards for payment."}
{"text":"So this place had great reviews when I first came here. I noticed their starts have now dropped which is good. People made this place sounds amazing but if I wanted a frozen fish patty I would just have gone to the store and bought a bag of my own for cheaper."}
{"text":"It's all in the sauce!  My friend and I have been talking about trying this place for years. Tonight was the night as it was convenient for both of us. 

This location is actually very clean. There is only outdoor seating available, comfortable picnic tables. They are well maintained and they were just fine to eat at. There is also a drive thru and you can order ahead of time by telephone. 

Cash only!  Pete's only accepts cash, but if you forget to bring some, there is an ATM on the premises. 

I ordered the fish, shrimp and chips (fries) combination. It was decent but by no means did it blow me away. The fries were the best thing, hot and fresh. Fish was basically a frozen fillet, but the breading was good and the fish tasted pretty good. The shrimp were my least favorite, breaded with some type of corn meal that overpowered any trace of shrimp flavor whatsoever. 

The sauces are the big winners here. All meals come with a red spicy cocktail sauce. It's really good. They do have tarter sauce, but there is a minimal charge for it. The tarter sauce was really good as well. Both of the sauces were the only thing to save those shrimp!

Worth a try? Yes! Who doesn't love fried fish! 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Horrible, what a let down!! I have been going to Petes since i was a kid, 8pc shrimp and chips. Use to be worth the drive, now I live next to the one in tolleson and you cant pay me to eat there! What the heck happened to the shrimp!! So disgusting now. Dont waste your time here, go across the street to Filibertos."}
{"text":"good and cheep for 50 years
if you go from pete' s to pete's east to west or west to east you will see what phoenix loked like in 1955"}
{"text":"It was fine. My husband and I went so he could reminisce about going when he was a child. Food was fine, atmosphere was sort of nice (it was a nice day)."}
{"text":"I was really excited when I saw this place one morning while I was on my way to a near by appointment. I Love fish and chips and the fact that this place specializes in this must mean its good right? Like any good little Yelper I checked out the reviews. Only 3, but a couple were really favorable. When I stopped by on my way out the parking lot was packed. Another good sign right? I walked up to the window to check out the menu posted above where you place your order. I was pleasantly surprised that the prices weren't that bad. I ordered the fish (1) piece, & shrimp (4) combo which came with fries and a drink. Plus for only 95 cents more I ordered something ala carte called a crabby. My total was about $8. I waited only about 5 minutes for the not so friendly lady at the window to call my number then took my bag of goodies to sit down and eat at one of the outside cement tables. I wish I could say it was good or bad but it wasn't. It really had no flavor at all. Not the fish, not the shrimp, not the fries and not the crabby which turns out to be a stick of imitation crab fried in the same breading as the fish and shrimp. One thing I can say is that it is very crispy and not greasy, although maybe that would have added a little more flavor. They don't serve tarter sauce either but instead the food comes with a spicy thinner than cocktail sauce sauce but it was a little too spicy for me to really enjoy. On a plus note they do offer real brewed iced tea."}
{"text":"Growing up in Mesa, we used to go to the old school, original Pete's. I was THRILLED when I found out about this location, since I now live out on the westsiiiiiiiiiiiiiide. (Sorry, had to do that.)
I love Pete's! The only thing that bums me out is the \"cash only\" deal. Wtf is this \"cash\" that people talk about anyway? :)"}
{"text":"I enjoyed my visit. I stopped by and placed about 8 orders to go . I waited a reasonable time . I was given a shirt for orders over $60,if I am not mistaken .I was taken by surprise but thought that it was pretty cool. Not sure if shirt gets you anything .Over all  I liked my service and food."}
{"text":"I just want to say the food is OK I honestly prefer Ed's Fish and Chips but my issue is the bad customer service I received when I called in to complain that they forgot to include my 2pc fish well the manager  Marco\"s answered the phone when I called in and he pretty much blamed me for not looking at my receipt when clearly the cashier never read me my order over the intercom or even at the window when I paid but it was still my fault he said !!! Oh well I will drive to Ed\"s next time for the great food but as well for the great service !"}
{"text":"Who couldn't like Petes Fish and Chips?

Sure they only take cash - you can use the ATM they have. 

They don't have a dining room but a covered eating area.

It's different, but a good different. 

Give them a try and you won't be disappointed.

I like the monster burger, their burritos, and fish sandwiches."}
{"text":"Best place ever! I moved away about 15 years ago but every time I come to Phoenix I make sure I eat at Petes. This place should be a national franchise. Thanks petes !"}
{"text":"The food was alright. For the price it's definitely NOT worth it. The fish looked like a hash brown from McDonalds and it looked frozen. Every piece of fish is exactly the same size. I definitely DO NOT recommend this for the price. Long John Silver's is cheaper and way better"}
{"text":"This location does not serve lettuce or tomato.  So when I asked for a monsterburger deluxe w/ cheese.  The guy taking my order was like...uhh what's deluxe?  So I told him that at the Indian School location, they have the deluxe option with lettuce and tomato.  He then told me that they do not serve tomato or lettuce.  

Get on the lettuce tomato bandwagon Tolleson Pete's!!  

This location is crazy busy on Saturdays nights (probably on Fridays too, but I went with my mom on a Saturday night).  Highly suggest not parking on the west side of the building and the line of cars in the drive-thru can stretch all the way to the street...and you may have to wait for a few minutes to back out of your parking spot.  Best place is to park on the south side of the building."}
{"text":"You order fish and chips and you got to pay extra to get tartar sauce makes no fucking sense. Bad customer service.
The food looks like fucking Gordon's fish sticks from the frozen food box.
 call slaw has no taste no seasoning and I'll blah blah blah...
I give them one star further cashier saying you got to pay extra for the fucking tartar sauce and keeping a straight face when you go to a Fishplace they should give you the tartar sauce and their menu says it comes with one sauce."}
{"text":"What has happened to Pete's? The breading on the shrimp is different, has a rubbery texture, shrimp? where its all breading now and the mound of salt the toss on top? The sauce it not the same to watery and not much kick to it anymore. Used to love Pete's but something has changed and not for the better, not sure we will be back..sad and disappointing."}
{"text":"Nothing like the quality at the 44th St. Location. Fish was flakey and over fried. Not sure i'll go back to this location. Also no lettuce or tomato? What? 

A second thing.. Cash only? Is this a money laundering scheme or do they not have anyone on their payroll that knows enough about IT to install and manage a POS system that can handle a CC? If this is the case I would be glad to render my services just because I know you can do better than this. Also.. Cash only just screams \"ROB ME!\" 

Not too bad, but you have catching up to do!"}
{"text":"thought the burgers were going to be better...don't get me wrong the burgers did fill me up...it just didn't taste so great...I guess I'm going to have to try there fish there...since I'm assuming that there specialty"}
{"text":"I grew up on Pete's, and raised my kids to love it just as much. Long family history of Pete's, my older sisters used to work there peeling potatoes long before I was born. I hear some people say it's all batter....I love batter apparently. I went to try a different place last night and find myself here at Pete's today. Nothing compares!"}
{"text":"Every now and then you've got to get your Omega-3 fatty acids, so there's your rationalization for chowin' down on some righteous deep-fried fish and chips at Pete's! I'm not a huge french fry nut, but there are some things that just go together... like peanut butter & jelly, gin & tonic, Tigger & Pooh.

I started my descent into addiction for Pete's Fish & Chips by ordering the Combo #2: Super Seafood Combo, and I have not deviated from it since. It's perfect... 2 pieces of fish (square), 7 pieces of shrimp (and these appear to be butterflied longitudinally, so they make an impressive fried shrimp \"stick\" perfect for dipping), 3 cups of Pete's Sauce and a 32-oz. fountain drink. You don't think you will need three 2-oz. cups of the red sauce, but once you start dippin', you will understand the dark appeal of Pete's sauce chemical dependence. My best guess is that Pete's sauce is ketchup + vinegar + sriracha, but what I indeed know is that it is addictive. I actually like to double-dip in tartar sauce and then Pete's sauce (tartar costs extra). I don't know if that makes me a double-dippin' freak or if I am the member of an as-yet unidentified Pete's patron subculture.

If you haven't gotten your fishy-fish on at Pete's and you want to know what all of the underground hype is all about, you gots to get over here and sample the goods. The batter is crispy and delicious every time, and you will be surprised at how much traffic pours through this side-of-the-road parking lot/food court. Judging from the sheer volume of customers (and at a cash-only place, at that) they must be doing something right!"}
{"text":"I have driven by this Pete's for years, and decided to stop by with my family on a Sat. Afternoon. I ordered the fish/shrimp combo. It was mediocre square fish with minimal flavor. Shrimp were weird processed shrimp nuggets. Fries were barely hot when they came out. Husband had monster burger and it was similar to a McDonalds cheeseburger. Cheap prices, but low value."}
{"text":"The fish seemed to be those pre-formed square frozen patties that are sold in the frozen section of the grocery store. Not good as I was expecting real fish filets for the price charged.  The fries were ok, but I suspect also frozen. Also, join the 21st century and start accepting ATM cards. I won't be back. :("}
{"text":"My wife and I were debating where to go for lunch.  Finally I suggested this place since we had driven past it a few times.  She informed me that it's a Valley staple and she couldn't believe that I had never been there.

I asked if it was like a Long John Silver, and she wasn't sure.  I asked her to confirm online that there were things on the menu that weren't fried.  Sure enough, they had hamburgers.

The verdict is that the burger was alright.  I got to try some of the famous Pete Sauce.  It reminds me of a watered-down sweet & sour sauce.

I did get to try a bite of my wife's fried fish and liked it.

We did the drive-thru so in all fairness I can't comment on the decor.  They folded the bag special and use recyclable plates."}
{"text":"I think we keep going here because of tradition, cause the food ain't the same from back in the day? This location needs desert and check orders better"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try Pete's for several years and the synchronicity had never been in play, until tonight, so off I went!  I was fairly excited.

I had checked out the menu online so I had a fairly good idea of what I wanted to order.  I got there and was very pleased to see that there was a drive through (which I wasn't anticipating).  I got up to the speaker, the person who took my order was very nice and polite.  She repeated my order back to me and said she would have my total when I got to the window.  I paid and drove away.

Once home, I found my order to be correct.  Very good!  I took one of the plates out of the bag and found that their fish portions strongly resemble McDonald's hash browns in size.  Okay, sure, the proof's in the eating anyway.  I took a bite and was instantly disappointed.  The breading was so dry that it scraped the roof of my mouth.....and there wasn't much what you would call flavor.  They provided a dipping sauce that was NOT tartar, much to my pleasure, and I gave it a shot.  At first I thought it was cocktail sauce with a little zip to it but after several bites, determined it was more likely watered down ketchup with red pepper flakes added.  Couldn't get enough of it!  It was the fish's only redeeming quality.  I ate 1 of the 3 fish portions.

I eagerly moved on to the second plate....shrimp...hoping that it would be better.  I was pleased to find seven nice big portions.  Without the sauce to mask it's flavor, I took a big bite (about half of the portion).  I became puzzled.  Was there any shrimp in here?  I ate the other half.  Couldn't really tell there either.  I took another portion and bit down in about the middle.  Surely there must be some semblance of shrimp in the middle.  And there was.  It was so small though.  Imagine the shrimp they sell at the grocery store where there are 36-40 shrimp per pound.  Imagine one of those cut in half.  That's about what this amounted to.  The rest of these nice big portions were breading.  Lotta breading, not much shrimp.  I ate 3 and gave the rest to the dog.  He didn't get too excited about them either.

The bottom line here is that the best part of my visit was the sauce, and I can't give more than 1 star if the best part of the meal is a condiment."}
{"text":"Pete's has been a favorite in my family since my dad was attending Tolleson Union High School. I'm not much of a sea food person, but it's hard to resist their shrimp and chips combos. Their Monster Burger stands up to any other fast food burger as well. Don't get me started on their sauce! You could put that stuff in an IV and inject me with it and I still wouldn't be satisfied!

But I never leave Pete's with out ordering at least one of their burritos. The perfect blend of beef, beans, and cheese! Weird right!? Burritos at a fish place!? Trust me... You won't be disappointed. Love this place!"}
{"text":"This was our first time eating here and we were amazed how good the food was.  The crisp of the chicken sandwich and fish sandwiche with the spicy tomato base sauce was very delicious. The onion rings was a hit,  great size portion. We will be back to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Hey Pete's fans! You can look forward to a SUPER PETE'S! they just broke ground on construction. YAY!"}
{"text":"Great fried fish and crispy onion rings....yum!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff and consistency makes this Pete's Location a score for me.  Since 1947 Pete's has been a staple within the valley.   I've only been frequenting this location for the past year but they've never done me wrong.  Every time I taste that red sauce it brings me back years to when I used to enjoy the same meals as a kid.  Cash Only"}
{"text":"The food is ok for what you pay. But the service is HORRIBLE!! I've been there twice and both times I've been \"helped\" by different kids who by judging by the look on their face wish I would've gone somewhere else."}
{"text":"growing up this place was always a treat. i was excited 2 years ago when my shop was moved to 1 mile from this location. we had it for lunch a couple times and it was ok. not neer as good as it use to be. the shrimp use to be much bigger and pretty sure they were hand battered back then. after the initial couple times, it got even worse. the shrimp is prepackaged, over breaded, and hard would be the best way i could describe it. the shrimp is mushy but batter is hard. i was going to give up on it, but tried it 2 more times, and gross both times. what a shame. use to be soooo good, and now it is just gross. to top it all off, yesterdays lunch has me sick as a dog with food poisoning, and luckily i was only able to choke down half of it. had it tasted good, i would probably be even sicker. i am done with petes. no longer addicted. i can only assume that the original owners passed the company to their kids and they are running it without the same passion?"}
{"text":"Please ignore anyone who gave this place anything more than 1 star, they clearly have never had a good meal in their lives! Frozen, and awful \"fish\" patties, still hoping I don't get sick. The girl working the window was truly one of the dumbest human beings I have ever encountered. I had to tell this girl the prices of the drinks, she had no idea what to tell me when I asked what the Pete's sauce was, she looked at me like I spoke in a foreign language and said, it's the Pete's sauce. Really ??? You don't say??  No S%$^ kid, but what's in it? Also, who serves fish and doesn't automatically serve tartar sauce???!! The fries were soggy, the drink had 2, yes 2 ice cubes in it. How has this place survived?? Please just shut your doors."}
{"text":"This place was recommended to me from several people. I tried it for the first time today. I'm sorry to say that I'm not a fan. I ordered the seafood combo which was a combo of fish and shrimp. 
The fish was like deep fried Van De Kamps fish squares. What really grossed me out were the fried shrimp. When I  pulled it out of the bag, I didn't recognize it as shrimp. At first I thought they gave me chicken strips. But no. It was several of those teeny tiny shrimps molded into a shrimp nugget. Yuck. The flavor was briney and very fishy tasting. I could not even finish one of them. 
Out of the whole meal. I enjoyed the fries but that is all. Sorry but I will not be returning"}
{"text":"Soooo disappointed. My friends raved about Pete's. Today was the day I finally check out Pete's. I order the 3 piece fish meal (w/fries). I guess it would be tood if you enjoyed greasy, oily, deep fried fish. The fish was not even seasoned well. I think the local grocery freezer could have done a better job.

PROS: cheap eats, prepared quickly
CONS: oily, not well seasoned, cash only

I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Came back again on Mon. around noon with my 2 daughters and grand daughter in tow for our Pete's fix. Nothing much has changed from my previous reviews and updates save two! The shrimp are now a little smaller overall but larger pieces of shrimp inside the batter and the prices have gone up! Our order of fish combo (2 fish, 5 shrimp and fries), 7 piece shrimp and fries and 8 piece chicken nuggets came to $21.80 not counting $2  ATM charge for cash. Got our food quickly and piping hot even during lunch rush! Be careful if you go, lots of road work on Van Buren in front of Pete's and other businesses! Prob be awhile for our next fix!"}
