{"text":"Worst gyro I ever had. 

No way the meat is made fresh on a rotisserie like they say on the menu. Tastes like frozen cardboard that was defrosted in a microwave. The platters contain very little meat if you are lucky to get it. Once they forgot the kebabs on my delivery platter, refused to refund the order and told me I'm a delusional liar. Delivery was on time tho.

Lots of great places to eat in Oakland, but this ain't one of them."}
{"text":"Everyone that works there is so nice and friendly, and they're sympathetic to students, both through pre-set specials and if you just ask for a discount.

Their gyros are always piping hot, and the meat's always tender and moist. Also, they actually put effort into their fries, which is refreshing.

They serve good pizza too, and you get a lot for the money. That combined with the comfortable environment of the place and their customer service has caused me to choose their pizza over more traditional Oakland pizza places on more than one occasion.

As far as eating in, you can either eat at one of the tables or at their sidebar. I'm not sure how the design on the tables ties into the overall theme of the place, but it's interesting to look at, anyways.

The place is clean, has good gyros, is relatively cheap, and is right on Forbes. That's good enough to keep me coming back."}
{"text":"I'M NEVER GOING BACK!

Quite literally the most AWFUL falafel I've ever had! I love falafel and having many good Lebanese and Middle Eastern friends, I've had some very good homemade falafel. The falafel mix most have come out of a box then prepared and left to spoil for a couple of days, because it was gross. The falafel was under-cooked and still gooey in the center of at least 3. The tahini sauce it came with tasted like baby vomit smells and was completely inedible. I never throw food away, but I finished one and threw my platter away (I didn't want to risk getting sick).

I would rather grind up $4 in a mortar and pestle and swallow it!!!"}
{"text":"Tender grilled lamb with perfect rice pilaf and fresh side salad and pita; major improvement over a fast food bag of whatever."}
{"text":"Went there yesterday for the first time with my friends and the gyro's were decent even though they got my order wrong; not as good as Lesvos in Southside though. After sitting there for about a half hour the owners family walked in and stared me and friends down for a good 10 minutes so that we would leave. Not the friendliest atmosphere."}
{"text":"I've been here twice so far, and I enjoyed my experience both times. Although this isn't the least expensive place to eat around campus, I'll definitely be back for more.

The cashier is friendly. After you order your food, they bring it out to you, but they do not wait on you, which is completely fine by me. The food does take about 10 to 15 minutes, so you may want to call ahead.

The first time I went, I  tried a \"wedgie,\" which is basically a pizza sandwich--lettuce, tomato, onions, cheese, tomato sauce, and meat folded in a pizza crust and baked. I got the steak wedgie. Delicious! The small size ($9.99) was enough to last me for two meals. 

The second time, I ordered the lamb shish kabob ($8.49), which came with rice, half a pita, and salad. All the food was delicious. The lamb was tender, flavorful, and most; the rice was fluffy; and the pita was warm. The salad seemed like the same mix of lettuce, tomato, onion, and dressing in their sandwiches. My only complaint is that there was a lot of rice (more than half the Styrofoam box) and only a few chunks of lamb. Also, I wish there was more salad.

My boyfriend got the gyro wrap, which he enjoyed. I took a bite and liked it, too. We also shared an order of pistachio baklava (around $4.00 for a small box with 4 small pieces). We had to go ask for it after we finished our entr√©es, but they promptly gave it to us. The baklava was cold, but we both enjoyed it. Considering that they also sell \"homemade baklava,\" this may have been something they pulled from the refrigerator.

All in all, great food and shop that I'll go to again!"}
{"text":"Great lamb Gyros and Chicken gyros (usually within 10 minutes and great on the go), If you plan on eating while driving just mention to go light on the sauce. In my opinion their Gyros are as good as they get. I've only had Gyros in NYC, Chicago, Miami to name a few cities.

I've lost count on how many times I've been here for their Lamb Adana Kebab Platter. They are cooked fresh and take 10-15 minutes, usually when I'm trying to get some good dinner and get a good nights sleep, this dish has yet to fail me! Very friendly staff and super clean place,"}
{"text":"Food was ok gyro meat was dry. Seemed as if it was reheated in microwave humus was good"}
{"text":"I love the food. Great selection, very good prices and the food is really good. The people are nice and the place is fairly well kept up for being in a college town. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Order from this place via foodler last night. It wasn't very good, the meat was really dry and over cooked plus they didn't even get the order right. Their tziblahblah sauce wasn't very good either. My experience with this place was mediocre at best."}
{"text":"I stopped by to pick up a gyro on my way home from work, takeout style. It was LITERALLY the worst gyro I've ever had. The meat tastes funny. There was minimal sauce, and it was really greasy. The gyros were so greasy, my takeout bag was sopping wet on the bottom, and leaked all over my car seat. Do yourself a favor and go to Mike & Tony's or ANY other gyro place in town."}
{"text":"To be honest I think this is my favorite restaurant in all of Pittsburgh. The service is incredible, the food is always delicious, they're open way more hours than anybody else in Pittsburgh, and some of the things are really good deal like the calzones. I'd recommend the gyro or Adana Kebab though because that's what's really special here.  Also they have Hershey's ice cream which is pretty good. They're not over friendly but they have really good service. 

Don't expect somewhere nice and fancy. Expect a delicious, affordable, hidden gem."}
{"text":"We ordered a gyro salad, and a gyro hoagie. 

The salad was great! However the hoagie didn't come with the vegetables as advertised which was very disappointing. I ended up sharing veggies out of my salad, but it was just really disappointing, especially because it was delivery and we couldn't do much about it! We also ordered a 20 oz diet fountain soda and were given a can of caffeine free diet coke. There was an option to buy canned soda and we chose the fountain soda and paid more for it, so we were disappointed to receive a can."}
{"text":"I rarely give 5 stars but this place is so well balanced. The student deals make the food super cheap. And their food is delicious. Their pizza is loaded with cheese. Their gyros are loaded with meat. I have no idea how this place is making money with how big their portions are (don't get too high of expectations, I still sometimes need 2 gyros, but considering most places hate giving more meat...) and how cheap it is. I agree with some of the reviews here that the cashiers often have an accent and so there's sometimes miscommunication, but other than that, it's really underrated."}
{"text":"The doner gyro kebab is fairly decent and a reasonable price at $9."}
{"text":"VERY BAD SERVICE FOR DELIVERY!!!
I ordered chicken shish kabab from them last night from a online website. After 10 mins of ordering, they call me and tell me they dont have chicken shish kabab available and I agree to switch the order. After that they took one hour to deliver and when the guy came, he forgot to bring one order and starts to argue with me that I paid for just one order. Then I had to call the manager and then again they took another half an hour. So basically I had to wait for just two plates of kababs for TWO HOURS!! The kababs were actually good and are always good but NEVER GET DELIVERY! GO AND PICKUP IF YOU WANT TO EAT HERE."}
{"text":"Great milkshake. Ordered the cranberry flavor no whipped cream. It is so good. And the service is good."}
{"text":"This place was awesome!!! The first day we went we got accommodating service from the management! The hoagies are like soft pillows with tender goodness inside! It's all halal! The lamb is too good! The only recommendation I'd make is make sure all the people that work every day give same deals/prices. The second day, the management was kinda rough/mean with any requests. I do recommend going there to anyone in the Pittsburg area! It's worth every penny!"}
{"text":"Hate to be critical of a joint near a college campus, but landed at PIT and needed something halal late so I went there. They supposedly close at 12AM I called and asked if I could come over and eat there since I had a 2+ hour drive after. They said make it before 11:50pm. Got there by 11:15ish and they weren't glad I showed up. I ordered and sat down. The older guy cooking in the back came out and turned off the 'open' sign and said 'closed', I asked if I should get it to go and eat in the car? He said to have a seat... then he turned off the lights... then the kid came out and started spraying cleaners on the tables around me... idk man, just don't take the order if you gonna do that.

The food: order chicken kababs (mediocre and overcooked), with salad (horrible, wash the onions), and hummus (cold, like out of the refrigerator cold). Pita bread was soft and good. Won't go there again."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp, was Christmas Day and starving, only place open in all of Pittsburgh (well, not really but it seemed like it). I had the Gyro special #1, came with fries and a pop. The Gyro had plenty of meat, tzatziki sauce, lettuce and tomato, delicious. I shall drop by again next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to stop for lunch. The service is quick and efficient. The food is tasty and prepared super quick. If you're near Pitt's campus and need something quick and delicious, Gyros on Forbes is definitely worth the try. It opened relatively recently and I've quickly become a regular. 

I am completely satisfied with special 1 or special 2, but I'm planning on expanding on the menu soon. Their homemade pastries and sweets are totally worth trying!"}
{"text":"Not impressed at all.  I ordered the baba ganoush, falafel pita, and the tabuli, and was first surprised when the woman asked me whether I was vegetarian.  I said that no, I wasn't, but when I later inquired as to why she had asked (nothing that I ordered should've not been vegetarian anyway), she responded by saying that it was because the baba ganoush was made with mayo.  Therefore, I'm not sure if it was all just psychological and I just thought it tasted bad b/c of the mayo (which is something I can't stand), but it was pretty gross: the flavor was bad, and the texture was gross (and I normally love baba ganoush!).  Moving on, the falafel was very dry and overcooked, and the tabouli had WAAAAY too much green onion to be enjoyable.  Also, I ordered my food to go from here using Tapingo, but it was quite some time before it was supposed to be ready.  Rarely am I this harsh of a critic, but considering that the service wasn't fantastic either, there's no way that I can rate this place anything higher than 1 star (and this is coming from someone who normally LOVES this sort of cuisine!)"}
{"text":"I was in the mood for a sandwich and saw that Forbes Gyros was one of the restaurants on Grub Hub that delivered.  So I ordered the 2-8\"  hoagie special (ten bucks) and an order of fries.

This is a two meal deal, and two hardy meals at that.  I ordered chicken parm sandwiches (I don't know if you can order 2 kinds of hoagies for the special, Grub Hub would not allow me to do that) and they were fantastic.  Each hoagie was individually wrapped in foil, so the second one went straight into the fridge, along with half the fries.

The bread was super fresh (it may have been Mancini's but not positive) and was brushed with oil and then very lightly toasted.  No chicken patties made of pressed chicken on these sandwiches.  It was all white meat, big chucks of it breaded and deep fried, and a very generous amount of these chunks were spread on one side of the bread.  The chicken was slathered with a very good marinara sauce, then topped with slices of provolone, then put under a broiler.

I liked my bread a tiny bit crisper/crunchier, so I opened up the sandwich, put a drizzle of olive oil on the \"just bread\" side, and popped in the broiler for a few minutes.  Perfect!

French fries were delivered in a large, square styrofoam go containers (like what you would get a large sandwich and fries in).  Fries do not travel well, once you close the container, all the steam is trapped in the box, making the fries limp.  But I again did a light drizzle of olive oil and broiled them in the toaster oven and they were fine.  They were frozen fries, not fresh, but for $3.50 for an enormous portion, you can't really complain.

I'm not a gyro fan, but I do like falafel and hummus so the next time I will probably go that route.  But if you like a good chicken parm sandwich, you'd be hard pressed to find something better."}
{"text":"I'm on a gyro kick right now and while in the area decided to stop by. The girl at the counter was friendly but communication was a bit of an issue. She asked me 4x to confirm that all I wanted was a gyro on pita. 

The gyro itself was ok and It was served piping hot. I do have a couple complaints though. The lettuce and tomato weren't the freshest. Also the tzatziki sauce just didn't hold up to the rest of the gyro. It just wasn't as creamy as I would have liked. I prob won't be back there are several other options in the area for gyros."}
{"text":"I've had food delivered from here using Grubhub and thought that the food was pretty decent! Just based on the food - I would give it a 3-star. However, the most recent time I stopped by the store in-person, I tried their raspberry ice cream in a sugar cone and it was DELICIOUS! It was only $2.13 and they are pretty generous with the portion! I am a big fan of Dave and Andy's across the street but in terms of affordability and flavor, I will probably find myself coming here more often for ice cream. They also accept credit/debit cards here which makes it more convenient. Kind of weird to be supporting this place mostly because of their ice cream but if you want some good dessert, then definitely give this place a try!"}
{"text":"I was really, really craving a falafel sandwich after working late at Dunkin Donuts about a block away, and was so happy to stumble across this place. I didn't look at a menu and just asked for falafel in pita with everything on it. It was pretty delicious despite the fact that it was in a tortilla and not a pita. It was very filling though, and satisfied my craving but I probably would make the trek to a more reputable falafel establishment had it not been 11:30 at night."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now. While not spectacular, I think the food is generally good here, better at least than some of the reviews may suggest (though it's possible that the staff have changed). I may be biased, though, as this is one of the few places that serve halal meat in Oakland. I'm pleased with the menu variety too. The food can take a little long, but the service is friendly. Overall, I'm thankful that I can get a decent gyro or pizza for a fair price."}
{"text":"Best 11$ spent ever the lamb is fantastic. This is not a far walk from the hospital and it's open Christmas. Thank you"}
{"text":"So underrated! I get a lamb gyro here pretty often. They're fast, delicious, and open late -- so it's a great late night food option when you don't feel like eating pizza or American food when you get hungry on the late night. They have a wide variety of items and the prices are reasonable. I go about once a month and I'll definitely be going more often."}
{"text":"Hands down, my favorite place in Oakland for a quick bite.  I usually get the lamb kebab, and the lamb strips are always hot and fresh without any warmed-over taste.  The rice has really amazing flavor without being too buttery or salty, as well. Sometimes on a busy night there is long wait for an order to be filled, but it's well worth it. Definitely worth a look if you're in Oakland and are looking for a reasonably priced meal but don't want to settle for McDonald's."}
{"text":"I ordered the tandoori platter with a can of soda. I got the meal but not the drink. They had poured hot sauce over the chicken and rice (the latter tasted like minute rice anyways).

Then I get a call that the guy is there with my drink, 15 minutes later. Wtf?"}
{"text":"I love that place their food is amazing and very punctual when it comes to delivery, great mix grills however they might need to have better English speaking people to pick up the phone , other than that it's  an amazing place"}
{"text":"Gross pizza and even worse gyros.  Also, the place is dirty and the service sucks.  Would highly NOT RECOMMEND especially when there are so many restaurants around it that are better."}
{"text":"We needed to get out of our tiny apartment and also wanted ice cream, so we headed into central Oakland. We never had tried Forbes Gyro and they had a sign advertising their Hersheys ice cream, so we headed inside. 

I honestly thought they only had gyros and Mediterranean food, but they actually offer everything that a pizza shop would: pizza, calzones, salads ect. 

They had cool options for their ice cream such as the ever so popular birthday cake, butter pecan, cappuccino crunch (yum, we sampled that) & moose tracks. There are other flavors i didnt mention. I went with a medium cup with moose tracks and chocolate. You can also make any flavor into a shake. 

The counter-guy was extremely nice & friendly. I was thinking of 3 stars since i only tried the ice cream, but his customer service added on an extra star. Sometimes businesses lack in the customer service area. We'll have to head back to try food next time."}
{"text":"Lots of mixed reviews on here, but I guess it comes down to what you order and what you expect. For me, I'm very happy that there's a late night joint in Oakland that doesn't involve a loud bar atmosphere but also isn't McDonalds (though Love Yogurt is a nice option that opens until 11pm). Had the gyro here once and there was room for improvement, specifically on being a bit too dry. But their chicken is surprisingly delicious and tender, and now we just always get the chicken, rice, and salad special, which also comes with a warm pita all for just $8. The portions are huge and you really can't beat it for the price. Probably could be a bit less oily, but it at least feels healthier than Primanti's or McD's. So skip the gyro if you're skeptical, and try something else."}
{"text":"So, I have been going to this place for the past 2 months, the food is overpriced, but I go there because it serves Halal. Recently, my friend and I ordered a hoagie each to go and asked the guy at the counter if we could have some hot sauce. The guy gave a small packet of hot sauce to my friend, I asked him for 1 more since we had ordered 2 hoagies, he said that he would charge me. I told him that we had just ordered 2 sandwiches and a packet of hot sauce shouldn't be a problem. He said that I didn't charge you for the first one, and implied it was a favor. Also saying that it doesn't matter if you order separately or not, you have to pay.
The packet was 5 cents, which in all honesty is petty and I wouldn't mind paying, considering I just bought an $8 meal. It's a shame, I was warming up to the place. Pathetic customer care."}
{"text":"Got Yelp take out tonight.   Average delivery time (an hour from order to getting at my door).  Food was good.  Had a traditional gyro,  Sweetie got a chicken gyro.  We also had the cigars (4 in the container) so good,  sooooo good.   Falafel was good,  probably a better thing to order at the location,  was not hot by the time I got it.  Got pistachio and walnut baklava (4 little chunks in each container.   The were both very good.  Will be ordering there again."}
{"text":"Pros: delicious gyros, pizza, fries, ice cream and more! If you're not terribly adventurous the only thing I'd suggest is staying away from the Turkish pizza, but I've never tried it. I've heard it's good! You can call in an order or use GrubHub for delivery too. They're very quick. Fries are crispy, but they sometimes don't have enough salt. Ice cream is fantastic if you're there and want something delicious and refreshing. Nice and cool inside during the summer and warm and cozy in the winter. 

Cons: communication is a little difficult since some of the cashiers don't speak English as their first language. If you want to modify an order, clearly describe it. They sometimes forget to modify it. It's not the cheapest place to eat for broke college students, but if you go every so often it's not breaking the bank. A gyro runs for 7.49 for a wrap, but it's pretty huge."}
{"text":"I almost feel guilty giving anyone 2 stars, but I have to be honest. I had the worst gyro of my life here. That is dry and bland. The \"feta\" is of the lowest quality, also bland. Amd the tzatziki or yogurt sauce was runny and surprise....flavorless. I am greek. But even if I werent, I would say this is the worst gyro ever. And having had so many at different places,  it's pretty hard to make a bad gyro. I'm giving 2 stars because the spring mix was of good quality and the service was nothing soeciak, but not deserving of less than 2 stars. Please, address your bland food. I've read it in other reviews."}
{"text":"We ordered the gyro special for pickup, which came with fries...until pickup, when they tried to charge us for the fries again, saying that they were already paying a 15 percent commission to Yelp's eat24, so they couldn't actually afford to do the special. I wish I could say that the gyro was worth the trouble, or even decent, but it was meh."}
{"text":"Awesome food. Simple ingredients and very healthy. The ladies in the kitchen are very sweet."}
{"text":"The food at Forbes Gyro has drastically improved since opening a few months ago. I ordered a doner plate with a spinach pinwheel pastry. The doner was more flavorful and had a nice crisp texture. The rice had bits of a small brown ingredient which made the rice very tasteful too. I was unable to identify it, but my friend suspected it was a type of nut. The pastry was good too! I liked how flakey it was, but it was a tad too greasy.

Also, they have now expanded their menu to include American and Turkish pizza."}
{"text":"It was yummy and I liked it! Got the gyro sandwich. Fresh veggies, decent cucumber sauce, and plenty of meat. Fries were crispy. Nom nom. Kinda sparse on the seating and there's only a counter. But I can see it getting better with time."}
{"text":"Good gyros at a good price.

After passing by this place everyday, I finally decided to go in and try it with a friend. We were surprised to find that the food tasted much better than the restaurant's decor suggested. I had the chicken gyro with pita. The meat was tasty, lettuce crunchy, and sauce was dripping on the table (sorry). The portions are also quite large (especially for the price) and I was VERY full by the time we finished."}
{"text":"Picked up some takeout from here. The College Special is reasonably priced ($7 and change) for a gyro wrap, a large helping of fries, and a drink. Gyro was delicious, meat wasn't dry (which is a major bonus). Fries were crispy, which is rare from many of these places. 

I will definitely add this place to my lunch repertoire."}
{"text":"Not the best gyros, but they are quick and open late on Saturday nights! I would recommend asking for extra cucumber sauce."}
