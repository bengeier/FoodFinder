{"text":"I have been to this place twice now and have been disappointed twice. The food is not bad quality but the service is very slow. For lunch today I had to wait for 20 minutes before any diimsum appeared and a reorder took another 20 minutes. Do not go here if you are in a hurry. The quality of the food is not worth the wait. Its just another mismanaged restaurant that has the potential of being good provided the owners make an effort."}
{"text":"Sat next to a table with some teenagers having dim sum today. From what I could tell overhearing their conversation, they paid their bill, but didn't have enough cash for a tip. They got up looking very guilty when the waitress came to clean the table and noticed the lack of tip money. On their way out, the waitress called over another waiter. He personally stomped up to one of them and demanded the reason of why there was no tip. After they meekly explained that they didn't have enough money and that they were very sorry,  he then told them very loudly to leave and never return."}
{"text":"Shrimp and chicken Singapore noodles with vermicelli type noodles was great. It can be ordered extra spicy, but regular was flavorful and plenty for two."}
{"text":"Hello everyone, damn woo, is one restaurant I will step food in ever again. Service terrible, although I've giving this place many chances to redeem itself but they failed evey single time.   One of the few incident was, me ordering lunch take out there for the past week and I ask for 1 extra container so we could use them as bowl to eat from and they want to charge me for it. I was fooriuos.  The one that got me was one morning I went there with my gf fire the dim sum special. The bill came up to 16$ and I gave them 20$ including tip. On my way out the waiter stop me holding the small tray with the change in it asking for more tips. Right in front of other customer. That Did it for me so I reply loudly (tip for what???  Take 30mins for 1 item to come out or tip for Ignoring or request for extra hot sauce, or for your shitty service. ) so I took back all my change and left."}
{"text":"The customer services are very efficient.  The waiters and waitress are friendly and nice. As well, the Dim Sum is delicious."}
{"text":"We came in on Saturday at 1:30pm for dim sum. We ordered 7 dishes and were quickly disappointed when one of our deep fried dish was served to us cold and soggy - clearly not freshly made. We told the waiter of this and he simply microwaved the dish and served it back to us. We didn't wait for all the dishes we ordered to be served, paid the ones we did eat and got out of there.   In addition, I noticed the waiters serving the dishes had their shirt sleeve in the dishes they were serving - can you say extra flavoring free of charge? I also saw one of the staff dropping a clean table onto the dirty floor, picked it up and set up the next table with the same cloth. There were also two other servers, one walking around with a toothpick in her mouth and the other was chewing food while serving customers.   Will not be coming back."}
{"text":"This is probably the best BBQ restaurant in Mississauga.  I have been a customer for years and the quality of their dishes are consistently good.  Their BBQ duck is awesome and BBQ pork is always tender.  Service is above average (serving staffs don't throw the dishes on your table like those in Chinatown) and very friendly.  Although price of their dishes remain relatively unchanged in the past few years, their food portion has shrunken by approximately 25-30%.  I guess it is easier to reduce the portion size than increase prices.  Despite the smaller portions, Sam Woo is still my favorite place for BBQ and Dim Sum in Mississauga."}
{"text":"Worst Chinese restaurant in Mississauga.    Not only is the service terrible, Food is mediocre at best.   There was once a cockroach in a dim sum dish. Depending on how you look at it, either nasty or more flavor.   I do not recommend this place.  If i were wasted, i honestly believe id eat crap off the streets then to dine at Sam Woo.   Last but not least,  if you preorder for pickup in advance, don't expect to get your food right away when you go do the pick up.  You will find yourself caught behind their \"BBQ\" lineup that moves in intervals of 15mins.  I have tried to counter this by asking the front desk if I could pay there, taking into considering my food is ready, and there should be no reason I line up for 45 minutes.  Lady working the front desk gave me a sly look, and pointed to the back of the BBQ lineup.  I promptly left after that gesture.  3 hours after the fact, they decided to call me and ask why I haven't picked up my order.  I have added this restaurant to my permanent ban list."}
{"text":"We have tried at least 6 Chinese restaurants in this area. My Sweetie is from Hong Kong (which means she speaks Cantonese), and is University educated in Canada. Me? I am just a white guy, so I am not an expert on Chinese food, but I am slowly learning. I have been to Hong Kong though, so I do have a little authority.   Of the Chinese restaurants we have tried in the Mavis/Eglinton area, we like this one the best.  As far as Cantonese restaurants go, the food is good and their service is excellent. Many times we have arrived with a senior in tow, and they were always respectful and patient with us. Of course, as a white guy I like anything barbecued, and my Sweetie insists on veggies, like the stir fried Bok Choy in garlic sauce.  In a 5 km radius, this is your best choice!"}
{"text":"I visited Sam Woo with my family for the first time today and was looking forward to the experience, but have to say that I am disappointed with the customer service here. While the dim sum was quite good, the service itself is pretty terrible. We were not really greeted when we walked in and had to wait several minutes before we were even acknowledged. My mother had to ask for hot sauce 3 times before our request was granted. At least two of the items we had ordered did not come out. Servers were not very friendly. The place was crowded at the time we went, but we have been treated better at other dim sum restaurants even when it was busy. The woman sitting at the cash register had no warmth and did not thank us as we left. All I can say is, too bad. I will not be returning to this establishment and would not recommend it to others."}
{"text":"\"They have the best bbq duck and bbq pork. Good cheap Chinese food in the heart of Mississauga, The best freakin' place ever. As close to dining in Hong Kong as it gets. Cheap, fast, nothing fancy or high-brow. Food is always great."}
{"text":"horrible customer service. We ordered some food and told them dine in. I don't think they heard me because when I asked to sit down the waiter told me to sit by the window by the door. I was with my fiance. So we sat and waited and when our food was brought to us they had packed it up for take out. We told them it was dine in and the waiter looked at us and said \"you know it's going to be more for table service.\" I felt so insulted and embarrassed. He said it in a way that would be a financial problem for us. I felt like he was trying to rush us out the restaurant even though there were some asian families having dinner in the restaurant. Maybe it was because I am Indian idk. Food was off. The soups were fine but we ordered noodles and they gave us a container of these dry uncooked noodles which we threw out. Maybe a bad day for them?"}
{"text":"Went here with my fiance after hearing good things about their BBQ. At first glance, this seemed like a good choice because the place did seem pretty popular at dinner time, but the food was pretty meh.  We decided to order peking duck, the lettuce wrap (rainbow chop), and beef in HP sauce (I think that's the english name)?  The peking duck was probably the worst I've had. The pancakes were sticky, thick and cold.The duck was OK. The rainbow chop was terrible though. The duck legs weren't included and the meat/veggies was super watery. That was the first time I had peking duck I didn't like.  The beef in HP sauce was ok. Beef was super tender but the sauce was only OK.  Overall service was not bad. (Which is a good thing for Chinese restaurants)  I wouldn't recommend this place. There's plenty of Chinese restaurants in Mississauga that are much better and have similar if not better prices."}
{"text":"Parking accessible, not much from the outside, decor is dated inside, staff extremely helpful and attentive and friendly, food was good! Little pricey in parts but otherwise good.. kind of felt like we were just eating in a big PE hall with bright lights which wasn't comforting.. cosier feel and lighting adjustment would have set the scene a little better.."}
{"text":"I've been on this planet for nearly 30 years, and I didn't even know there was a Sam Woo in the city until now. I am ashamed of myself.  Sam Woo could be considered the de facto Chinese/dim sum restaurant in the city. Coming here last night was like walking into another era. It evokes the 90s in its decor, but the food is fantastic and the experience was overall very enjoyable.  There are certain things you just come to expect from a Chinese restaurant. Unlike other Yelpers, I won't judge a mainstay for poor decor if the food is great. After all, I've been to Chinese restaurants with much worse seating and cleanliness that had absolutely incredible food. That's a dime-a-dozen in Chinatown. Likewise, the staff comes across as a bit \"gangster-ish\" (the manager/owner looks like he stepped right out of a John Woo film, and some of the servers are abrupt and to-the-point).  We came here for the express purpose of getting peking duck, although I ended up ordering vermicelli instead because I wasn't feeling like too much meat. The portion size they gave me was huge, and easily enough to share with two people. Like most pho/dim sum restaurants I've been to, the selection for a regular weekday is overwhelming. I'd suggest that you bring someone along who's visited the restaurant multiple times before and can help guide you to make certain choices.  The a la carte menu items are priced quite reasonably for the amount of food you get. though one of the options for the duck (shaved pieces w/ lettuce wraps) is a ripoff. With that option, they give you a few shaved pieces of duck with crepe-like pancakes and lettuce wraps, while the other option (have them cut up pieces in the back) nets you a lot more meat at the expense of having to deal with bones. It's worth choosing the latter option. I did try a couple small pieces of the duck, and it was melt-in-your-mouth delicious. Very fatty and almost having a butter-like texture.  The service is a bit dodgy, but then again, I expect that whenever I come out to a busy restaurant like this. All things considering, the dishes we ordered were served promptly and the staff were reasonably attentive. We did have a bit of a problem at the end when our server failed to split the bills separately, but we managed to smooth things out easily and get the matter sorted out. There was a review down the page that mentioned you had to pay for take-out containers - not sure what happened to you, but they gave me several for free. You probably just didn't turn on the charm like I did.  They also engage in what I like to call \"diet racism\". Apparently, if none of the guests are Chinese in the group, they don't actually serve you dessert. My friend (who had been to this restaurant multiple times recently and knew the servers) ended up telling us this, because we wouldn't have received it otherwise.  Overall, Sam Woo is a restaurant I enjoyed visiting and will be back soon in the near future. Great atmosphere, great food and reasonable service made me a very happy eater."}
{"text":"Sam Woo is one of my regular stops in Mississauga for Chinese, especially for Chinese BBQ.  I love their BBQ Pork and Roast Pork!  One of the reasons I love Sam Woo is the consistency of their food and service.  Whether the restaurant to packed or relatively empty, I have always received the same reliable service.  Whether I've just ordered take out to go, grabbed a quick meal of won ton noodle soup or joined a large party with friends, the quality of the food has been great.  This is why I keep coming back!  While many other Chinese restaurants in Mississauga have come and gone, Sam Woo still remains as busy as ever.  It is my belief that this is a result of staying true to their roots as a traditional Hong-Kong-style Cantonese eatery."}
{"text":"Been here a few times before but will base my review on my most recent visit.   Had to pick up my parents on a Wednesday night from the airport and of course they were hungry! Sooo we ended up at Sam Woo at 9pm. Surprisingly they closed at 12:30 so it was nice not feeling the pressure to eat fast! It wasn't busy considering what time it was so we got seated right away. My parents come here often enough that a few employees know them so we were greeted kindly by someone that recognized them   They were very pleasant and reassured us not to rush since they close late anyway! We ordered 5 dishes (see pics). Everything came out at a reasonable time, it was hot, made fresh and delicious! They came back a couple times to see if everything was ok and even made small talk which was kinda nice.   We decided to order noodles (Cantonese chow mein) to-go. And without even asking they packed the sauce and noodle separately to avoid sogginess! Most restaurants I've been to would just put it together.   By the end, they served us warm sweet tofu for dessert 'on the house'. But let's be honest...they were probably just trying to get rid of it cuz it probably won't be good for the next day but hey! It was good and free!"}
{"text":"Dim sum specials are $2.90 on weekdays, which is a little expensive given its not much more than on a weekend in some locations. The dim sum isn't too bad by Mississauga standards, but the staff can be rather irritating. My mom was paying at the counter when one of the male staff (the one who likes to talk and joke around while customers are eating) was gawking at how much she is tipping. Staff should not be allowed to nosy around wondering how much customers tip."}
{"text":"Worst customer experience one can have, I order fried rice and bbq pork side dish.  At first the fried rice look nice, but when I bite into the shrimp it tasted funky. Believe me, I usually cook at home, and I can tell what is fresh and what is not, I paid almost 15 with tax, for one dish, please do not give me ingredient that is not fresh, come on. The bbq pork was the most disappointing part of the dish, this restaurant puts all the old meat at the bottom to make it look good on the top, and after you eat into it, you later find out that all the old meat is in the bottom, and they tried to hide it too, by adding soya sauce to it so you can't tell that it has been a long time, and they are still serving old meat, come on. And to top it all off the bill was not cheap, came to around 60 with tax for 2 dish, with old meat and funky shrimp..."}
{"text":"One of the best Chinese restaurant in Mississauga. Good foods with good price. Been there couple of times. Service is fast than before. Food is as good as usual. One lady waitress is very nice.  Tried their BBQ duck,my favourite."}
{"text":"I go here every weekend for dimsum and it's always packed!   It's a bit on the pricer side but I personally think it's worth it.   The service isn't that great but isn't that how it is for all Chinese dimsum places tho?"}
{"text":"Very good dim-sum at a typical Chinese restaurant (on the brink to grossness). It's cash only by the way."}
{"text":"Moving away from the Richmond Hill/Markham border area, I had concerns... Those being that there would not be a decent place of which one could acquire a duck of the Chinese BBQ persuasion...  So I turned to Yelp! and found that there was this place called Sam Woo. Now, if you've seen my review of Emerald Chinese Restaurant, the prospect was very enticing and so I went, in search of this golden (brown) waterfowl.  When you walk in, there's two ways to go, left for the takeout counter and right for dining. Went with takeout, since it was late and because I have no friends or special someone (story of my life).  One thing that scared me was the waitstaff as they were wearing black bowties and white dress shirts. I felt like I was in a Hong Kong cop movie and guns were about to go ablaze! Wait, that's actually kinda cool.  The duck was great, and a whole duck ran me a little over $20 bucks. But, it was definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Sam Woo dishes up the best BBQ meats in Mississauga. From the crunchy skin of roasted pigs, to the crispy caramelized skin of fresh roasted duck, Sam Woo does Chinese barbeque justice!   Their Dim Sum is OK, but you can't be too picky around Mississauga. The soy sauce infused fried squid is absolutely delicious!  Their other dishes are sometimes a hit or miss... But are never terrible. All in all, Sam Woo is a decent place!"}
{"text":"I love the food in this place, really delicious and quite affordable. I'm a regular of his restaurant however the service has always been not so good here. The waiting time isinglass, reduce customer waiting time has not impotence here. The servers can't of impatient too. Last time I went there, I ordered two combination BBQ, the sever came back and told me that they are out of one type of BBQ,  I agreed to only have one type of meat in my dish, but when my order came, there were only half size of what I ordered, then I asked can u give me more meat, I still pay he same, they said no. It's very unreasonable and make who sense. It wasn't my fault that only one type of meat available.....I tried to communicate with the sever, but all they answer is not it's not allowed...."}
{"text":"Great Chinese BBQ selection. Good Roasted Pork and BBQ Pork. Dim Sum after 2pm is cheap and the selection is great. Always busy during peak hours but fast service and good food."}
{"text":"Sam Woo is a very reliable restaurant with rock solid cooking. Decor is dated and needs updating. I've been coming here for decades."}
{"text":"This place is good for dim sum if you were too hungover to wake up early. You can catch Happy Hour Dim Sum prices from 2:30 - 4:30 and save a little money. The food is consistent and comes out quickly after you order from the paper menu. There is usually a line up but it moves quickly because Dim Sum is about getting full and then going back home to sleep it off.  The service is nothing special as with most Asian Restaurants. Just make sure you ask for everything you need right at the beginning of your meal so you do not have to rely on the servers coming back except to bring you food.  The dim sum is always fresh, hot, and ready to eat. Perfect hangover cure."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since I was a child, and I can honestly say I've never had any bad experiences with anything.   The BBQ pork and roasted pork is the best I've ever had, another noteworthy dish is the spicy fried squid which is an excellent choice. Something I've noticed however is that for some reason they tend to bring the white rice out close to the end of our meal.   The food quality is similar to Emerald's (which is good), but at a more affordable price. Overall great place, best Chinese restaurant in the Mississauga area!"}
{"text":"Good food, good service. Barbecue pork was good. I would recommend for people who want authentic Chinese with clean environment."}
{"text":"We came out to the west end in search of a Chinese restaurant to celebrate my brother's girlfriend's granny's bday!  (Yes, a little distant but we did value her and this special occasion) We order the pepper salt lobster, I thought it was a little small in terms of the size.  The pea shoot with crab meat tasted a bit bland.  The egg with shrimp tasted pretty good, my bro and I kept digging at that plate.   The oyster casserole was nothing to write home about. The BBQ pork and duck, I aaa expecting more meaty and flavourful. But the Birthday buns were tasty. Service was very attentive and upbeat. Will come back if I am in this area again!"}
{"text":"Put it this way. I don't normally travel the west side of Toronto. When I do, I need to save them to my GPS. This place will be removed from my GPS favourite list."}
{"text":"This use to be one of my favourite Chinese restaurants in the west end. They need to clean up this place a bit and refresh their menu. Only thing that keeps going up are their ridiculous prices. Food is mediocre. Service is average.  Even Chiu Chow Man has recently completed a reno. I would love to see Asian Legend or Congee Queen open up in the west end. We so deserve better Chinese restaurants here."}
{"text":"I went to sam woo for dim sum during there morning happy hour. Some dishes were good, some were meh. The dishes were hot though. Service was standard for a chinese restaurant. I was surprised they charged 25 cents per take out container.. overall i wouldnt come back."}
{"text":"This place was a huge disappointment.  The shrimp dumplings were balls of shrimp, like a minced paste.  The spicy squid was rubbery and the cheung fun was also rubbery.  The peanut dumplings were fantastic however, but that was it.  I won't be returning"}
{"text":"Sam woo is like a lot of Chinese restaurants. Terrible service but good food.  I've been coming to Sam woo for years now and it's always bittersweet because the food is great, lots of variety and fast. But the service is god awful.   I don't know what it is but generally if a restaurant has a reoccurring customer then they would be more inclined to serve a familiar face. But at Sam woo they think the opposite way. It feels as if they are so comfortable with me that they don't need to \"please\" me anymore so they give me terrible service. When I try to order they purposely turn away, or if I call their names I have to really shout before they actually look at me.   It's tough to come to Sam woo if it feels like you've been dating someone for a long time that doesn't put effort into the relationship."}
{"text":"This place has pretty good service and decent food.  The waiter was patient and even smiled a lot, which I don't expect from a Chinese restaurant.  The place was relatively empty with four other tables for dinner time, but it quickly filled up around 7pm.  Ordered the beef chow mien, cod with soy sauce and roasted duck.  The noodles were fantastic! Loved the sauce and the crispy noodles. The duck was  a little above average. It came out quite cold and we sent it back to get warmed up. The duck is less fatty than other Chinese restaurants, which I guess is good, depending if you want lean or fatty duck. The cod was so-so. I found it to be small servings and not so good, definitely had better. Overall, food ranged from average to great and the service was above average."}
{"text":"Sam woo.. what can I say the service is very slow.. took at least 20mins before anyone paid attention to take our order and most of their servers don't speak English which is very hard of you do not speak their language.  Heres what we ordered:  Chicken corn soup.. very heavy on the corn starch not really chicken and corn, it's more like corn soup with little strips of what seems to be chicken.. make sure to ask for soy sauce or hot sauce as it doesn't have much taste.  Crispy beef chowmein.. came with few pieces of Chinese broccoli and slices of beef.. doesn't have much flavor again like the soup make sure to have soy sauce and hot sauce. Very sad to experience a crispy beef chowmein that lacks flavor since every Chinese place we go it's what we order since it's our favorite.  Beef with mixed vegetables.. so far this had the best taste vegetables were not over cook and the first dish I saw that didn't have a bunch of cornstarch. I would recommend ordering this dish compared to the others.  Here's where they completely lost all points with me we found a piece of hair in our crispy chowmein and the thing that bugs me we saw it when we were almost done.. I did inform their manager and he gave 10% which isn't really anything and he can't say that it was our piece of hair cause none of us has black hair so.. would I go back there again most likely not.."}
{"text":"Very authentic Chinese food. We enjoyed the food. Fresh fish, you pick him out in the tank and eat him."}
{"text":"Their service is crap, crappier than everywhere else I go to for dimsum, but they are consistent with their food most of the time. Plus the have happy hours from 2:30-4pm on Sat and Sundays so that why people keep going back. I still go cause it is so cheap only for dim sum.   tip- cash only during happy hours"}
{"text":"Went back. Ordered  Fukien Fried rice and BBQ pork and Duck. Deliciousness.  Cool waiters. Did not go into washrooms this time. Lol. My buddy who went with me also found the food quite good. This would be my second trip and the BBQ pork is consistent with the last time I was here. Good!"}
{"text":"A lot of really rude waiters/waitresses - - I asked for hot sauce 3x, and when I went up to the cash register to ask the women behind the counter for it, she completely ignored me and did not even look at me, even though I was speaking to her. You have to be Cantonese in order to get some respect there. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"Sam Woo is arguably the best chinese Dim Sum restaurant in Mississauga.  The dim sum and atmosphere is very authentic, and food quality is above average.  I have had comparable quality dim sum in high Chinese population density areas like downtown, Scarborough and Markham, but I think Sam Woo is the best dim sum in Mississauga.  My group went during their Sunday Happy Hour (2:30pm-3:45pm), so we paid the discounted dim sum price.  We ordered the shrimp dumplings (har gow), steamed pork buns (siu mai), chinese noodle soup with bbq pork, fried chinese dough and shrimp wrapped in a white, clear shell, and a couple other dishes.   All the dishes were good and I am a big fan of the shrimp dumplings.  Poor service at the restaurant weighs down their score.  The servers are all rushing around and the manager always seems to be shouting and it is a picture of Chinese restauraunt chaos.  I would definitely recommend the food, but Sam Woo lacks the quality service of a 4 star restaurant.    Overall:  3.4 / 5.0"}
{"text":"This place was good that we had to come back twice on our visit. The first day we did take out BBQ, duck and crispy pork. The duck was amazing, so juicy and tasty. We came back the next day and dined. Service was attentive. Had honey beef short ribs, Cantonese noodles, snow peas tips, and beef with Chinese broccoli. There was no complaint with any of the dishes. Will definitely be back on our next trip to TDot"}
{"text":"Our favourite Chinese restaurant. That says it all.   Fried rice, pork chops, half a chicken and gai lan (veggies), more than enough to satisfy."}
{"text":"This place reminds me of I use when I used to live near Chinatown in the heart of downtown Toronto. The dim sum which is ordered to the table was decent but not great. The specialty is the BBQ. For me the best is the pork and I found the duck quite fatty. Watch out as mentioned before about question about billing practices. I thought my bill was more than I expected but I was in a rush and did not have time to question them."}
{"text":"We got some of almost everything. Very fresh and tasty versions of dim sum favorites. The rice noodles are better than anywhere else I've had them (BBQ pork and I think one was chicken skin? Very crispy). Not a lot of sweet buns. But the sesame balls were great. Will come back for sure. Come early, avoid waiting in line."}
{"text":"Authentic Chinese food (not the Americanized version). The roast pork is amazing with its crispy skin and hoisin sauce. The BBQ pork is tender and delicious, but can occasionally be a little dry if too lean. Also incredible is the soy chicken and BBQ duck. From the kitchen consider ordering pork spring rolls. Crispy and flavorful.  The place is usually extremely busy and the overly cramped takeout area is a hectic mess, but they'll get you through there without much trouble."}
{"text":"Best soup ever, great customer service but need to learn a little more English so don't have to compete repeating drink orders"}
{"text":"Good service today with delicious dim sum.  The price is fair 2.4 between 2-4pm Monday to Friday cash only."}
{"text":"Came here for late dim sum with 2 friends. Total price worked out to about $22.50, so split it's just over $8 each with tip. Dim Sum is between $2.50 to $3.45 per dish, and there's a decent variety of items. We ordered: - Curried squid (recommend) - Har Gow/Shrimp Balls (recommend) - Deep fried squid  - Siomai/Pork & Shrimp Balls (recommend) - Egg Tarts  - Douhua/Tofu Pudding   Service is sub-par, but fairly quick. Decor/dining experience isn't that great. Overall it's not bad for lunch with friends, but don't expect to wow your date."}
{"text":"Hongkong style. Not the best dim sum place I've been to, but in Mississauga is okish. Go there at the weekend after 3pm you will get 2.80 dollars for each order. I like the smell of their sticky rice chicken, which reminds me of some childhood menories, however, the stuffing is pork other than chicken..that disappoints me a lot!"}
{"text":"From what I have noticed, Mississauga is definately lacking good chinese restos. This place is still in business in part because Mississauga has slim pickings when it comes to chinese restaurants.  We came here on time during mothers day and found out that many chinese restuarants do not let you order off the regular menu on Mother's day because they assume they will be \"SO BUSY\" serving customers that they make set menus for you to choose from.  In a nutshell, the food wasn't that great based on what we were limited to.  We went back a few times for dinner and service is really indifferent.  Our last visit here the service was typical as many people have noted, indifferent service, not very helpful staff and food isn't really that great.    Case in point, we had a question and brought it up to one of the ladies at the cash (the owners) and the lady was really unhelpful in making any suggestions or recommendations of food to order.  Make the trip to Richmond Hill or Markham, it'll be more worthwhile"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I am a regular weekly visitor for work lunches.  I understand some of the criticisms I've read.  The decor is not appealing, the washrooms are used as storage rooms, and the fish tanks are off putting as they are in need of either cleaning or replacing.  So my 4 star review may seem weird.  The food always comes piping hot, and the quality is average to slightly above average.  The service is really good, you just need to catch someones eye.  Because we're regulars I guess we get taken care of pretty well.  Joe is amazing.  The prices are really good, as we end up splitting our dim sum several ways and only end up pay 7 or 8 bucks each.  Their bbq dishes are really where this place rises.  Their bbq pork is delicious and so is their duck.  There will always be a special place in my heart for Sam Woo!"}
{"text":"I really would like to give this place 4 stars, but the numerous encounters with the terrible service here is not deserving of my generosity. I don't think the importance of \"customer sevice\" has ever crossed the minds of the cantonese ladies that work here because they clearly do not care. What bothers me most is that they do not even utter a word when you request for condiments or ask a question, they simply walk away wearing a pissed-off expression on their faces. I don't understand why they feel the need to disrespect customers like that and I can only come to the conclusion that they are very unhappy people.  Don't get me wrong, Sam Woo (in my opinion) offers the best dim sum in Mississauga and the quality of each item is superb and flavoured really well. Dim Sum items are checked off of an ordering sheet but there are carts that circulate the restaurant occasionally. My favourites include: Chicken Feet, Short Ribs, Pig Stomach, Chinese Fritters with Congee.   Tip to eat by: arrive at the restaurant before 11:00am and discounts are applied to each item ordered!"}
{"text":"I have been to this fantastic restaurant many times and every time is better than the next. The dim sum is amazing and always good. Some dim sum dishes that I had are Lo mai gai, Shumai(my favourite) and Hargow. With this amazing food, I had some bolay tea. The service is friendly and welcoming. The restaurant is clean and the restaurant is big so you can move around easily. I recommend this restaurant to anyone who loves Chinese food."}
{"text":"I love this place, but can be quite crowded and long waiting time depending what time you are going. The service is super quick. The food so far are great. Really tasty asian food. Too bad they don't have congee after some time.   I really appreciate the team spirit that they have. A server will come and clean the table and if another server is free they put the utensils on the table. Great jobs guys"}
{"text":"It's not often I venture out to a new restaurant, but too often I pass by this restaurant and wondered why it was so busy.  So my girlfriend and I gave it a go for a late dinner. Our expectations weren't very high and just hope for a decent food that we can both enjoy.  Our first impression of the restaurant was that it was outdated. Shaggy carpet, dirty fish tanks, sketchy kitchen visible right at the entrance. This restaurant definitely needs an interior and furniture update. This didn't faze us very much, since we've been to many sketchy places but came out with food crave for.  The menu offered a fair amount of meal choices; however the prices are pricier than a regular Chinese restaurant. For an extra 3 dollar on a meal, my expectations were brought higher for the kitchen to provide me with more quantity or better quality food. An average meal will cost about 12 - 15 CND dollars, It's definitely more than the usual regular.  Our first choice was the fried squid, and it was mediocre at best. Although, it looked very good, the food was tasteless and lacked seasoning. Second was the beef short rib with black pepper sauce. It was a little better than the calamari, but again not worth the 12.75 we paid for. On the plus side, the meal was saucy and good amount of meat was served.  Third is the Beef fried noodle, it was tasty with good size, although it is not good enough that I would crave the same meal. Lastly and probably the best meal is the minced beef fried rice, seasoned well and it was a good amount.  One reason this place has a 2 star is the friendliness of staff is topnotch. However, the place needs some cleaning touch. I saw a spider come out the bottom of my plate, I killed it, I'm just glad it didn't come out the meal. I will never be back here again, in terms of food Tremendous is a lot better for with cheaper on price."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time in many years. Sad to say the place has gone to sh*ts. They served us spoiled chicken. When I called the manager over he said it's fine , and no one told you guys to order the chicken, don't come here again and order this chicken cause you're wasting our time to cook it.... really ?!?!! After I went to cash out I went to make sure we weren't charged for the chicken, he got upset and started speaking in Cantonese , not knowing that I understood every rude word he said. I got very upset and let him know clearly in Cantonese that this is just terrible and he should never disrespect paying customers in any language. The cashier tried to defuse the situation saying he didn't mean to say it blah blah blah.... I still left a tip for the staff as the servers at least were on point .... don't eat here ever - we were a party of 15 . The food is way over priced and of course we got served a rotten chicken!"}
{"text":"Food is good. Service is not too bad. Just another edible Chinese restaurant. Nothing too special about it."}
{"text":"Great food, great price and they're open late. This place is always super busy especially in the morning, they specialize in dim sum. I ordered chicken fried rice, the hot and sour soup, Singapore noodles and cashew chicken.  The hot and sour soup is the best I've ever had! It had shrimp, egg, Tofu and pork it was super delicious and the small bowl is pretty generous and enough to serve two. The Singapore noodles are awesome! I had them with chicken they were well flavoured and different from other noodle dishes I've had. Lastly I had cashew chicken, I've always been a fan of cashew nut chicken the chicken and cashews were good and the celery was perfectly cooked.  I took home leftovers and they still tasted great the next day! I will be returning!"}
{"text":"Tip:  Happy Hour - either $2.60/$2.80/plate - is weekdays before 11am.  So get there early!  CASH ONLY for Happy Hour.  Dim Sum-wise, food is passable for the city.  No carts, just ordering off a chart menu.  My 'beef' about this place is that there are some questionable billing practices here.  Non-Chinese friends have said that they've been charged for \"condiments\", re:  hot sauce, mustard.  I've never heard of this.    Also, today when I went with a somewhat large group - ~7ppl - they didn't even charge us the special \"Happy Hour\" prices.  They charged the regular prices, so the bill worked out to be $107+, and when we pointed out the mistake, it went down to like $86.  Sorry, but that is a HUGE difference!  Service isn't the best.  They provide what is asked, but in an indifferent/rushy way."}
{"text":"Great place for dimsum but also for dinners.  If you are going for dimsum, there are discounts if you go after 2:30p. But this is also when it is most crowded.  Good prices. Also try to sweet beancurd dessert.  So good."}
{"text":"Went there for dim sum.  The dim sum was pretty good and sizes were pretty decent.  It is one of the better places for dim sum in Mississauga.  However the service was horrible with the wait staff taking their time to do everything.  That reflected in their tip in which our server lashed out at us and said we did not give enough tip.  I asked her if she knew what a tip was.  I have an issue with people who think they are entitled to certain amounts of gratuity regardless of how well they provide service.  It resulted in a small argument which interrupted other people's dining experience.  Won't come back here from that experience."}
{"text":"went here with my cousins for a late dinner.   it pretty much is your regular Chinese restaurant, very similar to other ones I have been too.  The food was good but again nothing out of the ordinary.  What was good was the Chinese rotisserie in the front, showcase their BBQ duck and roasted pork of the day. It is a pretty pricey Chinese restaurant but it is good food, but again nothing with a shock factor. Seafood also very fresh as they have the tanks with the fish crab and lobsters, so if u fancy that I suggest you try them out."}
{"text":"Went here for dim sum happy hour on Sunday, was pretty packed, had to wait around 15mins to get a table.   Ordered a variety of dishes, my favourite dish was the chicken feet, however the skin for the har gow was stale. All the other dishes were quite good.   Overall the dim sum was good and I would come back again."}
{"text":"We go to Sam Woo for dim sum when we don't want to drive down to Chinatown and pay for parking.  Arrived around 11:30am on a rainy Sunday and the place wasn't as busy as we were expecting.  But now that I have read about the special after 2:30pm in the reviews below, I see why it wasn't busy!  Food came out relatively fast and hot.  Server brought us one item we didn't order and charged it to our bill.  We were so hungry that we ate it without noticing so keep an eye on extra items being brought to the table.  Ordered 13 items ranging in size (S, M, L), cost came out to $50 before tip which is average for dim sum."}
{"text":"Good food and great attitude of waiters! We go there atleast once every 2 weeks! Best to go between 2.30pm-3.45pm for happy hour Dim Sums"}
{"text":"you either love it here or hate it. As you can see from my stars im not a fan. my opinion's really based on the service aspect of it. the food is actually average i think, the bbq pork is pretty sick.  it's the service that really bugs me. waiters always seem grumpy. but i sympathize with the people that work here. ever see that movie horrible bosses? i think this may be a case of that experience. the woman that sits behind the desk that does nothing but collect $$ could be the boss. i once came here one evening and had forgotten my wallet but luckily kept a credit card outside my wallet. i paid by cc and the woman behind the counter gave me serious attitude and charged me some sort of \"service fee\" along with auto grad. She's like Bill Lumbergh from office space   horrible bosses what a great movie."}
{"text":"I tried this by accident.. lol. My friend showed up with chinese and brought the flyer with it. I wasn't hungry but he shared his cantonese chow mein with me (it came with really crispy noodles) instead of the soft soggy noodles, I'm use to. I really like that they used crispy noodles, it was flavorful but not overly, it had the right balance of taste.. I'd order this again. I only gave then 3 stars because it was literally the only thing I tried.. I felt teased, might have to go back for more. I cannot say if I recommend it or not, I haven't tried enough items on the menu to safely say but if you do come here and you don't mind crispy, get the Cantonese chow mein.. The mushrooms theg put in it are chunky and tasty. I love mushrooms."}
{"text":"2.5 star rounded up to 3 for old time sake  I remembered years ago Sam Woo Restaurant is the place to go for Chinese food when one in Mississauga.   Those were the days but when I stepped in Sam Woo a decade and more later, everything looks the same...menu the same... deco the same...I feel like I got stuck in a twilight zone.................................  How's the food? Good Generous Portion, Reasonable Priced. Though the flavour definitely lacking unless you start putting in so much hot sauce that it won't matter much anymore.   Sam Woo being in business for so long may not feel the need to change anything at all. I can see myself coming back 10 years later and would find everything still remains the same.. Good for people that like the good old days.."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I have to strike this restaurant off my recommended list...even though the BBQ meats are great.  You would think a customer with over 250 check-ins in 4 years would get good service but not even us are immune to the poor customer service here!  And considering that we have been patronizing the restaurant for almost 20 years means that we have eaten here easily over 1000 times!   After all these years, the one time that we had a situation with them regarding the order, all of a sudden, the service went downhill from there.  We put in our order of 3 dishes, including a Cantonese Chow Mein.  We received 2 of the dishes but not the Chow Mein.  As we were waiting, we noticed that many of the other tables who also ordered the same dish received their's before we did.  In the meantime while waiting for the last dish, we had already finished both the other 2 dishes and we were full by then, so we decided to cancel the Chow Mein.  Lo and behold, just when we cancelled it, the owner came up to us and said, \"We've already got your dish ready!\"  We explained to them that we had already waited 45mins for that dish and clearly they forgot about us, so by now, since we had already been waiting for so long, we no longer wanted that last dish as we were ready to leave.  It would have been different if it had arrived together with the other 2 dishes.    After this incident, their service went all the way downhill.  They were no longer friendly to us!   We even reminded them that we were regular customers and the owner replied \"So what? We have many regular customers!!!\"   Not any more from us.   I am boycotting this place for now.   On the plus side, we have discovered some nice new restaurants to spend our money at that offer great food with great service!"}
{"text":"A Mississauga staple.  No frills Chinese food at a decent price.  Good service."}
{"text":"My only memory of this place is one waiter who was making metal music with plates and cutleries. He must have had some suppressed issues he needed to release."}
{"text":"The dim sum here remains mediocre. Their dinner is very hit and miss. The bbq pork and roasted pork is amazing sometimes as it should be because that's what they're known for. Other times it's so fatty and greasy. The Yeung chow fried rice is consistently good. The noodle soup with duck and pickled veggies as well, but it's not available from 630pm to 9pm."}
{"text":"I came here again to try the other dishes. This time I had the Peking duck, eel in black bean sauce and fried crab. Again I enjoyed my time here.   I especially recommend the fried crab because it was fried to be really tasty and I couldn't really taste the grease. The roasted meats whether it be duck, pork or Cha Siu are usually good because they have a roasted department right in house.    The eel was presented nicely but it was slightly overcooked so it didn't taste as great as eels are suppose to taste like.   If you like Peking duck, you would definitely like it here too. The duck was presented nicely and the skin of the duck tasted juicy and crispy. So you would definitely enjoy the duck!"}
{"text":"In my own little world, I didn't know Sam Woo existed outside the confines of Bamburgh Circle.  However,  fellow Yelpers and I went there after a Yelp Event for the after party.  The review may be a bit biased as we were with a couple of regulars to this branch of Sam Woo so we may have gotten slightly better than normal service and food.  If I do go there on my own I will update the review.  The food we got was quite plentiful.  Though some of them I didn't like to eat just because it wasn't my type of food, the ones I did eat I was just wolfing down.  I had to stop myself from finishing up the food as well since I already ate so much.  The cost per person with tip was quite low for the amount of food and quality of food you get.  Since the food, service and price were all good.  I gave this a 5-star.  However, like I said, it may be biased due to the regulars in our party.  At the very least, there's I finally found an acceptable Chinese restaurant in the Mississauga area.  My previous experience with Chinese food in Mississauga had been dreadful."}
{"text":"My favorite go to place in Mississauga for CHINESE style BBQ pork and roast pork.  BBQ pork is tender, juicy and succulent.   Roast pork is crispy and tender. You won't be disappointed.  Thinking of sam woo's BBQ makes my mouth water with anticipation. This is not a fancy decor restaurant but still my fav for comfort food"}
{"text":"Dim sum specials are until 2:30pm everyday, at $2.80 per dish.  They do not apply on public holidays or even Mother's Day.  (Which I think is a rip off) No other Chinese restaurant operates like that.  They also charge you for extra take away boxes for unfinished food if it is during the happy hour.  (Another petty thing)  However, their roast duck and roast pig is really well done.  That is what draws us back every now and again.  We used to go very often but when their service dropped and all these unnecessary additional charges appeared, we started going less.  Too bad for them as we used to have lots of lunches and dinners there and especially with big groups of friends.    Some of the good dishes there during dim sum are the spicy fried tentacles, chicken feet, sesame balls, Bbq pork buns, beef tripe, pork ribs, har gow and spinach and shrimp dumpling.    If you go for dinner, Cantonese chow mein, garlic snow pea sprouts, honey spare ribs, roast chicken and salted fish and chicken fried rice are good dishes.  Surprisingly their chicken wings are really good!  They are all reasonably priced.    One other convenient thing is they are open late until 1am, so late night suppers or just when you feel peckish, you have them as an option."}
{"text":"Best Cantonese bbq restaurant in this area. Both bbq dishes and dim sum are worth a try. Bbq pork and chicken wings are recommended. Service is fair, so is the dinning environment."}
