{"text":"took Forever to get my order, the cashier was rude, and the food is not good at all...the noodles taste like spaghetti noodles....go to lotus next door"}
{"text":"Teriyaki grill is really bad. Took a long time to get my order. Terrible hibachi.  Not seasoned at all. Very greasy. Nasty.  

Entree combo is better."}
{"text":"Stay away. Don't go. Poor quality and taste. Not fresh even on a busy day. Save yourself money and disgust"}
{"text":"Terrible food was cold.  Egg roll was old. Shrimp sauce was straight mayonnaise.  Save your money.. yuck!! Even terrible for mall food standards!"}
{"text":"The food here is decent and I WAS going fairly often. However, what has turned me off to this place is the inconsistency of the staff. I discovered this place in July 2017 and was prob going 1-2x a month. I get the exact same thing every time: bourbon chicken, green beans and crab rangoon. Toward the end of last year I started having probs. One day I try to order my usual and the lady tells me I cannot get the crab rangoon with the chicken and veggies, it had to be either rice/noodles? WHY??? Supposedly because the crab rangoon, egg/spring roll, etc are speciality items, not side items. I asked her if this was a new rule because I had previously been getting the crab rangoon without a problem. She claims it wasn't and we bickered for a bit (petty, I know), but I ended up getting my crab rangoon (instead of rice/noodles) that day so whatever...

Fast forward to about a month ago (and yes I had been going regularly between now and the last incident, ordering my usual without a problem). So again a staff person tells me I cannot get crab rangoon with the chicken and veggies, has to be rice or noodles. WHY? She states because those are side items, not choices and I had to choose a side items when ordering the combo (or maybe it was vice versa, but who cares). WTF??? I tell her I have been getting the crab rangoon. She shrugs and  says whoever has been fixing my order has been doing it wrong. So I ask what do I have to do to get the crab rangoon (since they act like it's such a coveted item and no one has ever told me what meal combo I had to select to get it). She says I have to pay extra and  would still have to include either rice/noodles in my order. I tell her never mind then I don't want the effing crab rangoon, just give me rice...She sighs and says \"ok I'll give it to you\". She then gives me 2 crab rangoon with my order (which still also had rice in it) free of charge! Like what is the deal, did she just want to argue?! On top of that the crab rangoon turned out to be stale thay day! I would have been pissed had I paid for it. Another thing is, on the many occasions that I did get crab rangoon with my order (without incident) it was always inconsistency with how many they gave me! It could be anywhere between 1-3. 

I know this is super petty, but I was going because the price is decent for the amount of food. Also,  I actually liked the food! I  have not been back since the last incident a month ago and if I happen to be at the mall I may or may not visit, but definitely won't be going at the frequency that I was or recommend going due to the staff..."}
{"text":"Came for lunch and was expecting at least as good as the last time I came, but was not satisfied with any of it. I got the Thai spicy chicken. They only gave me 4 tiny pieces of chicken and all the rest were big chunks of jalape√±os and onions. Was in a very salty sauce, which made it impossible for me to eat! Next, I got their noodles. They were below average in taste and were super greasy. Half of the noodles were sitting in oil. Disappointing again. Lastly I got the bourbon chicken, which was just average. A few of the pieces were really dry, but the taste overall was okay. I guess the thing I enjoyed the most was the lemonade. Will not be back."}
{"text":"The service was \"eh\" and the food was \"meh.\" Not planning on returning any time soon."}
{"text":"Wow, it was pretty bad even for food court Asian food? I ordered a spring roll and a side order of noodle...The spring roll was pretty standard spring roll. But the noodle was terrible. The flavor, well I don't even know how to capture the essence of it, it tasted just like soy sauce? The noodle was very hard, I've never had lo-mein noodle SO HARD in my life, I felt like I was eating straws. The noodle was paired with cabbage and carrots. Ugh...both of those vegetables would have probably tasted better before they were stir fired by Maki. The noodle was suuper greasy, I know traditional Americanized Chinese food is greasy but this is VERY greasy, I can still feel the grease in my system and it's been 12 hours. I've had Maki at the south park location and I don't remember it tasting this bad...

Also, if you ask for a water, they pre-fill the cups and give it to you...I dislike this as the water do not taste as fresh from getting it immediately from the fountain machine. 
I usually choose the Curro Burrito place in Northlake but apparently as of today they are closed and is opening a taco bell in place of the location...bummer, who needs another taco bell seriously? The next time I am here, I will try Yeung's Chinese which is across the other side at the food court. I compared the price, they looked pretty similar to Maki. 

Whatever you do, DON\"T GET THE LO-MEIN, and I really like pasta/noodle!"}
{"text":"It isn't often that I get a chance to have a meal in a food court.  Frankly, it isn't often that I want to have a meal in a food court.  But I happened to be in a mall, and I happened to be in the food court, and the guy was handing out samples.  In fact, he was handing out a lot of samples.  Plus, it was about the time that the food was coming out, so it was really fresh, rather than sitting on the steam table for hours on end and just be turned over and over again.  I'll say that was the reason.

Whatever the case, I decided to go for a plate and you know, it wasn't bad.  I'm not often in the Northlake area, but if I am, and if I happen to be in the food court at opening time, I might give them another shot.  At least if I can get some samples to go with it again."}
{"text":"The Teriyaki Beef was EXCELLENT. Took a few minutes, but it was extremely fresh and worth the wait.  The meat was seasoned to perfection. Honestly, not just the best \"mall Japanese\" I've had, but some of the best ever. Really."}
{"text":"Don't do it!!! The lo mein tasted like boiled noodles with no flavor at all. The mixed vegetables where mostly celery. The bourbon chicken was ok but not great. I don't recommend this place. Sorry, the people are nice but the food isn't."}
{"text":"The Fried Plantains were not fresh, they had dried out from being in one of those food warming trays too long. They claim to be a Sushi Restaurant, but are always sold out because it's premade."}
{"text":"The food was excellent.  Veggies were fresh along with the bourbon chicken.  The chicken  was of good quality without all the fat."}
