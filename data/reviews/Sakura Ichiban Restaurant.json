{"text":"I came here for lunch .  The waitress was very slow, the miso soup was very salty, so we had to ask to change it and got the same bowls with added water. Green tea was cold. The meals were not delivered at the same time. Which extended the lunch time. Finally paying for the meal took more than 5 minutes .  It feels the the service priority was given to the takeout customers and not to the seating customers. Wrong !  Set a second cook for take out and arrange additional paying terminal."}
{"text":"Delicious sushi. Fast, fresh, great friendly service. I'd recommend the green dragon roll, or just about any of their lunch specials. Most are under 10$ and include rice, salad, and miso soup. The bulgogi is delicious, the tempura is perfection, and really, you can't go wrong with just about anything on the menu."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I can never compare any other sushi with theirs. Neat, clean and cosy place, perfect for professionals. Very fresh sushi, and when I say fresh, it means the type of fresh you barely get anywhere else. I go to this place often, and every time I leave with a big smile on my face and my tummy feels the happiest!! :-)"}
{"text":"Awful service. Messed up on my order when I made it clear as to what I wanted and didn't. All I wanted was a roll but they brought out udon noodles (which I originally cancelled) AND tampura which I never ordered. So I had to send it back but said I can eat the tampura. But little did they tell me that a few pieces of deep fried vegetables cost $10+tax. They still expected me to pay the full price of a mistaken order. Food was very mediocre. Spicy salmon roll was not spicy or crispy. Very bland in flavour. I left unsatisfied and with 3 times more out of my pocket than I was supposed to. I will never come back."}
{"text":"Had the veggie udon and came piping hot. Food quality was great and service was impeccable. Will come back!"}
{"text":"Toronto. We probably should have thought twice when we saw a tv playing Korean music in a Japanese restaurant.  But, no one seemed to care.  Then some of the menu items were listed with both Japanese and Korean names .  Though this restaurant has a Japanese name I think the restaurant category should have been \"Japanese, Korean\".  I LOVE Korean food,  but I wasn't expecting to find it in a Japanese restaurant.  There was no Kirin beer, though it was on the menu.  I was disappointed.  Everyone had to individually ask for water.  I began to wonder if I was going to be charged for my tap water that I finally had to ask for.   Our server was polite and she brought another shrimp tempura when one fell from the plate to the table as the dish was being served.  We ordered the yosenabe, which did not have much flavor (lots of fish cake, not much quality seafood in it).    We also ordered the chirashi, but other than the salmon, the other fish didn't have a lot of flavor.  As for the tempura, the shrimp was somewhat soft, probably frozen. There was a good selection of vegetables, though. The sauces were too sweet for what we were used to.  There was no grated daikon (radish) in the tempura sauce.  As for our side order of ikura nigiri sushi,  the ikura was shriveled, not fresh, and the nori was tough. Stay away from the teriyaki vegetable stir fry-- lots of bell peppers and onions.  Had the food been really good, the infusion of Korean elements would not have mattered to us."}
{"text":"Good food, good service, reasonable price. Didn't not finish my dinner sashimi sushi combo. Only thing next time don't try to seat a lone customer when there are lots of open tables in a corner smallest table. I asked to sit at the bar. Didn't not like the idea of being tucked away in a big empty space."}
{"text":"Classic Japanese restaurant. Great deals for food and combo options. Layout is very nice where you're able to sit in more private sections if needing intimacy or you can choose to sit at Counter or  open tables. Service is pretty good, everyone is nice and friendly, sometimes takes awhile but everyone is always polite and fills you in on everything. No complaints here! I like how it borders st james park great location!"}
{"text":"Used to frequent this place for takout meals for my executives. On more than one occasion the order was incomplete and there was one teriyaki that came as veggie but should have been chicken. It happens with large orders, no big deal.   However, when I called back to let them know that I am missing things from my order, they insisted that I must be wrong. (Tell that to my one executive who is without lunch while the others are eating around him,)  After some back and forth it is decided that she will place another order with the kitchen and that I will have to run back out to pick it up since they don't deliver.   When I arrive to pick up the food, a lady comes from the kitchen, says something to the server and now I am again questioned on my honesty of the missing items from my order. I assure them that I had checked it over.  They bring the bag of food and hand me a bill. Um. I am now being charged for the new teriyaki because I failed to bring back the veggie one with me to the restaurant as proof. Not wanting to argue any further, I paid the bill and went back to office to deliver the remaining items to my execs.   Needless to say, with so many sushi options in the area, I will think twice about ordering here again.   It's just bad business practice to argue with a customer who gives you regular business."}
{"text":"This is a pretty average Japanese restaurant in a good location near downtown Toronto. If you have a hankering for sushi rolls or gyoza, you will probably be satisfied."}
{"text":"i live across the street so im bias but consistent good quality food, yes higher prices but im willing to pay for convenience, service is always good since im a regular"}
{"text":"I used to really like this restaurant, but have noticed it go slightly downhill.  They have 11.95 lunch specials which come with a lot of food - a miso soup, salad and a bento box.  You can get a choice of two items in the bento box such as a California roll/chicken terriyaki.  The quality is average, but I think everything is overly salted - especially the miso soup.  It's salt on salt.  The food comes out within 15 minutes, so no complaints there. It's difficult to flag down a waitress even though the place is so small.  There's nothing more irritating than having to chase down the waitresses to pay.  I don't think I will come back.  Kirei is just down the street, and it's so much better at a comparable price."}
{"text":"A good sushi place in my neighbourhood. The sweet patato special role was amazing. Everything else was good.  Overall a 3.5.  I would come back here as it's a decent sushi place very close to my house."}
{"text":"I'm in Toronto for 15 years and this place is 3 blocks away from me. The only reason I have never tried it is because I have an (ex) friends that said it sucked...  This could not be further from the truth!  This is one of the best sushi joints in the neighbourhood HANDS DOWN."}
{"text":"I come to Sakura Ichiban relatively often for lunch, whenever I feel a hankering for sushi. In all honesty, it's one of the better choices in the area, in terms of value and quality of food.  I typically order the Maki Combo A, which is california rolls, spicy salmon rolls, and shrimp tempura rolls. You get about 6 pieces per type of roll. All of this for about 12-13 dollars.  The quality of the rolls is decent, the ingredients used are quite fresh and taste good. Getting a soup and salad with your meal, as well as an orange at the end if you eat in, is pretty good value for lunch.  Service is always attentive and friendly, which is the same regardless of eating in or doing take out. Overall, nice little place to get a quick and cheap bite of sushi, but don't expect too much."}
{"text":"I went here with the wife yesterday and I must admit I was surprisingly pleased with this place even though we had been years earlier. It's not that I was blown away (it's a pretty typical looking sushi restaurant; Bamboo plants, rice paper booth walls that look like you could jump through them, etc), however there were a few small things that stood out.  1. The service as fairly prompt. 2. With the sushi dinner ($17.50-19.50) there are a couple of extra starters other than the miso and salad most places give. a. a cube of giggly tofu with sauteed onions (1st) b. a little bowl with small fork full sized amount of noodles in broth (like those cup-a-noodles type noodle only not junky) (2nd)  (...and this is the one that got me thinking.)  3. the shrimp sashimi wasn't rubbery and ghetto. Usually this is the worst part of any sushi dinner I've had, but this shrimp was still fresh and crisp. I was surprised.  The only thing I noticed was that the sushi wasn't really \"cold\" when it arrived. It was room temperature and I'm not used to that. It was however pretty fresh, and the pieces were larger than normal.  We walked in on a Tuesday around 7pm and there were lots of empty tables. I suspect you could stroll in here most weeknights without a reservation and get a seat. Its not really busy."}
{"text":"I've ordered the same Chirashi for lunch from this restaurant for the last 3 years. lol. So you know I love this place. It comes to $12.37 with taxes and for some reason the waitress always seems to make it .47 one day and .37 the next. Anyways I digress.   The meal comes with the usual side order of salad and miso soup. First thing is the salad - looks great and fresh, never had a problem with their preparation or freshness. They don't cut the lettuce but tear it with their hands so to preserve the freshness, since cutting it usually browns the edges and you can see it. Nice and cold lettuce, taste crisp and fresh, I do find that they do tend to have more water than the other places.   Second, was the miso soup, which was hot and nice. The broth was good and tasty, you can definitely taste the benito fishy taste in there. You got to be careful and not burn yourself because it's so hot. I usually open the lid and start on the salad before the soup. Nice little tofu and seaweeds in the broth, nothing special or spectacular here, on par with everyone else and a good starter to my lunch.  Next up is the Chirashi, which is the best part of the meal. The bed of rice is fresh and room temperature, I would like to have a warm bed of rice but that's kinda hard to ask when you have to do take out and walk back to your office and eat. The sashimi are moist and fresh most of the time I order, they some times put octopus and munk fish and other types in my Chirashi, but not always which is the only bad part.   The usual Salmon, fake crab, tuna and that other white fish I can't remember what they call it, were good. I rarely see them mess-up this part of the meal, but on occasions like Mondays where they start to dethaw their fish I can smell that refrigerator odour consistent with fish that stayed overnight in their freezer.  They store their vegetables in ice cold water to keep the freshness, which is very smart and keep the freshness through out the day. I definitely like their choice of decoration which are carrots and dicons that they shred into thin strings that place in the meal.  The decor is quite nice, with Japanese motifs throughout, and the waitresses do wear kimonos and are cute as well. They recently undergone some renovation and the place seemed a little updated but the looks and feel is the same.   Would given it a 5 stars if it weren't for the inconsistent sashimi I get. But hey it's the best Chirashi I've had so far."}
{"text":"Had the Sushi Dinner Special which included tempura and spicy salmon rolls along with the Bulgogi.  Taste (4/5): The bulgogi was soft and easy to eat, you could easily taste each component of the sushi roll, and the rice on the sushi was moist. The orange dessert was juicy and exploded with flavour with each bite  Service (4/5): Food was served very quickly and the waiter visited frequently to check on how we were doing  Value (5/5): Each dish is about $15-$20, but you also get a piece of tofu, along with a small bowl of ramen noodles, salad, miso soup, and rice with your dish and an orange dessert. Tons of food to satisfy my craving  I've been to this restaurant a number of times now where I've tried different sushi rolls as well as the Gal-Bi. I highly recommend visiting this location if you like sushi."}
{"text":"Ordered take out from them, very enjoyable experience. Strong recommend the party tray with sashimi and sushi. Their sushi rice is nicely cooked, not very sticky or stiff. And their sashimi is very fresh and nicely cut. The raw fish is nicely attached to the rice and they don't fell off when you pick it up with chopsticks. Their bulgogi is also very delicious and I never get tired of it."}
{"text":"It's as good as I remember it being 15 plus years ago.  Glad I found the place again and was able to have my husband enjoy it for the first time.   Service Dog friendly"}
{"text":"Great quality and customer service, but a little pricy and smallish portions. Our server was really polite and the speed of service was solid. The sushi was very fresh but the rice wasn't as \"tight\" as typical sushi rice and fell apart quite quick once dipped in the soy sauce and wasabe.   My friend and I tried the Sushi Boat for 2 with an order of Gyoza and Tempura. Came to about $46 with Tax.   The atmosphere is alright, there are a few private areas that are walled off from the rest of the dining room, and that is a luxury that most restaurants do not have. It would make a good place for business meetings and dates.   I don't think I'll go back unless it is for a business lunch somewhere in that area and someone else chooses this location."}
{"text":"Big fan of sushi; I could have sushi for breakfast lunch and dinner. I would give this place a solid 3 star for the food quality, and a 3.5 for their service. It's a good place to have lunch at, with their lunch specials (decent list of 10-20 options and allows substitutions) ranging from $9-$16, where most of the combos include a miso soup and small house salad.   Funny thing, I came here for dinner too because my girlfriend was craving sushi. It was a Monday night and the restaurant was empty. We had a few special rolls and their yaki udon and assorted sashimi. Again, the food was mediocre and service was alright."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I live right near the Sakura Ichiban Restaurant - it has become our go-to sushi stop, especially for lunch time. The prices are reasonable and the sushi and sashimi are always fresh. The staff are also friendly. No complaints."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch today with a friend and was so disappointed. It was about 1pm and there weren't many people seated, but they did have a fair amount of take-out traffic.   I ordered the beef udon and an East roll, and my friend got a couple of their basic sushi rolls. It took about half an hour for the food to come out, which was not ideal because I was absolutely starving. The udon noodles were much longer and thicker than I've ever seen, and it was next to impossible to eat them. The broth was decent but the beef was an off-putting texture. My sushi roll was pretty good, but you can't really mess up a tempura shrimp roll with avocado.   We had to flag down another server to get soy sauce and dipping bowls, and nobody ever asked us if we wanted a refill on our drinks. The service was frustratingly slow and impersonal, and I definitely did not feel that I received a good value for the price."}
{"text":"Great food and generous portions with very reasonable prices especially in downtown Toronto. Quick service and authentic food"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch. I go there for sushi lunches quite regularly and love their sushi/sashimi/rolls boats. Service is always friendly and fast. I never waited more than 15 minutes, even for bigger orders. The prices are decent and the sushi is fresh. Parking situation can be complicated so beware if you're driving here."}
{"text":"I ordered the sashimi appetizer as my main along with one order of the uni sushi (nigiri). If you're not dying of hunger, the sashimi appetizer is your alternative to the sashimi dinner, which comes with a larger selection and portion of sashimis. There types of fish that come with was decent for a $$ Japanese restaurant. Quality was above average, which is surprising - there are way too many bad quality + cheap Japanese restaurants in Toronto.   I was not expecting them to have Uni, but I asked anyway. Our server asked the chef and came back with the good news. Uni isn't remotely as good as other places that I usually have uni from (Jabistro, Japango, Miku, etc.).  Food comes pretty fast, servers are super nice. Cute Japanese atmosphre. Good place to go if you don't want to spend big bucks but decent food."}
{"text":"A great little Sushi restaurant. Had the Torched Fish Dragon Roll (opps). Nice heat but not burning hot. The fish has a great light grill taste and plate was drizzled with a kicker sauce. The Tuna maki was like a tartar texture. Really good app sushi"}
{"text":"This spot really surprised me. It's no Japango or JaBistro, but it's an incredibly affordable place with just enough variety to get your sushi fix. Dinner sets costs around ~$15 and includes miso soup, salad, a small block of tofu and noodle to taste. I like the booth seating so it gives an intimate vibe for your party.  I was debating around the sushi combos and chirashi and noticed that on the side of the table they had a small stand listing dynamite and spicy tuna/salmon roll combo set for only $15! If you look at the picture, it's almost 3 rolls + apps for $15! There was more food than I could finish. At the end they also give you pieces of orange to finish off the meal.   Overall it was yummy, sushi was packed full of flavour from the sauces and just hit the spot."}
{"text":"We were the only customer there when we went. The service was great. They even offered us appetizers like a Korean restaurant would. The food were delicious. Sashimi were fresh, and the unagi don was great too. The presentation of the dishes amazed me, since the atmosphere of the restaursnt did not make me think that they would have such pleasant presentation of the dishes. Overall I would say a 7.7/10, since the outfit of the restaurant could take some improvement."}
{"text":"Awesome service - beautiful quiet Japanese atmosphere - romantic and private - DELICIOUS!  It's also really cool to be in a sushi restaurant that's actually Japanese, not Korean."}
