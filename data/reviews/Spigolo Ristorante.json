{"text":"The issue with smaller restaurants whose locations do not lend themselves to heavy foot traffic is that it's hard for anyone other than regulars to find out about them. I found it hard to believe that only 3 people have reviewed Spigolo in over 4+ years of existence. That said, upon arriving, I could see how their small sign and the aforementioned hidden location could be something that's affecting them.  This all to say that if you enjoy a treasure hunt, then Spigolo is the treasure chest that awaits you about 40 paces off of Hwy 7 in Woodbridge - it's an absolute delight!  Savour York Region was the draw, as Spigolo had easily one of the best value for money offerings available. $25 for a 3-course prix fixe menu which went far and about anything I've ever seen before. Most restaurants cheap out and cheap out HARD for restaurant weeks, providing meager portion sizes and limited options for appetizer, mains, and desserts. Spigolo rolls out the red carpet offering top shelf choices like Gorgonzola Gnocchi, Veal Steaks, and the absolutely incredible grilled tuna steak - which absolutely floored members of our group last night, and does not skimp on portion size.  They truly get that a restaurant week is the best way to draw customers IN and impress the pants off of them to earn their patronage from then off. My pants are still off as dinner last night blew me away.  To start they offered roasted hot peppers and garlicky black olives with focaccia style pizzas. For my appetizer course, I had a regional Italian specialty that I haven't had in almost 20 years - lumache (or snails). Done in a white wine sauce it was mouth watering, different than I remembered but cooked to a beautiful texture and flavour (I licked my plate when no one was looking).  For my main course, I went with the gorgonzola gnocchi. The sauce was so thick and so creamy it coated my mouth. I asked for a little hot pepper oil and it was stellar and worked so well to cut the creamy cheesy sauce - and burned so good! I'm usually a red sauce gnocchi guy but this was so amazing I couldn't stop myself and ate nearly every last bite.  To conclude, there were 3 dessert options, being in an Italian restaurant it went without saying that I had the Tiramisu option which came served in a stemless martini glass adorned with cookie/chocolate cigar.  Service was excellent as one server managed to deal with our table of 8, and 4 other large tables with grace and poise.  If you're looking for a pleasant dinner surprise in an intimate environment, look no further than Spigolo, you won't be disappointed.  Eatcrest OUT"}
{"text":"Fantastic boutique restaurant catering mostly to events. I was there for an event and really enjoyed  the food.  Really enjoyed the pasta with rapini and sausage ."}
{"text":"Tonight my experience here was NOT what it should have been, past visits have been good. I ordered the Butternut Squash Ravioli and what came out was ravioli filled with ricotta instead. I am Lactose intolerant and explained this to the waiter who promptly apologized and went back to the kitchen only to tell me they ran out of the squash and that the kitchen should have made him aware of this instead of knowingly replacing with ricotta and trying to serve it to me. FINE, I was asked what I would like instead  so I ordered Penne a la vodka which was promptly made and served. It was no more than red cream - not a hint of Vodka, barely any tomato sauce . The waiter acknowledged this, as did the owner whom I explained, again, that I was lactose intolerant - they both understood, left my plate in front of me and quickly left, off to the kitchen?  For a second I thought they were firing up a proper Penne a la Vodka, I waited, and waited... I mean what would you do as the owner?? WRONG, they did not, and as I suspected they left the plate of red creme and penne in front of me in hopes that I would just give in and eat it. Everyone else was finished eating and I was simply IGNORED. I did not complain, I did not make a fuss.....Maybe I should have."}
{"text":"Four of us dropped in for dinner last night and were very underwhelmed (disappointed) with the food. The evening would have been a complete write off if it had not been for our waiter. He was warm, friendly and a pleasure to deal with.  One small issue....one of the people dining with us was on a tight budget so she wanted to spend her money on food, rather than drinks. She ordered a water and was asked if she wanted sparkling or flat. She asked for flat...and was brought a large bottle of Fiji water (which was the cost of a mixed drink). Not cool.  We ordered:  1 Fagioli al Forno (Kidney beans in garlic and olive oil) - 2 Insalata alla Cesare (Caesar Salads) (very good) 1 Penne a la Vodka - I tasted this and thought \"meh...I've had better\". It was very al dante 1 Salsiccic in Padella - Sausage with potatoes - sausage was the kind you can get at No Frills...it was pretty tasteless 1 Vitello ai Funghi - Veal scaloppini in brandy sauce - the person who ordered this said it was too sweet 1 Agnolotti - Ricotta filled Agnolotti in a red pasta sauce (which tasted like Chef Boyarde sauce from a can - it was pretty bad)  We all agreed the best part of the meal was the pizza which was brought out instead of bread. It was lightly brushed with olive oil, garlic and some herbs. It was very good.  All in all it was a disappointing meal. We will not be returning.  Cost for dinner for 4, including a Diet Coke, and half litre of Pinot Grigio (tax in) was $145."}
{"text":"Definitely NOT a 2.5* as per the reviews, which most of them are old, more like  3.5*.  Disclosure:  Came here for a UYE with other Yelpers as part of Savour York Region, a.k.a. Summer/Winterlicious in the York area.  It was $25 for a 3-course menu, so it was definitely very good value!  I had Polenta con Funghi (w/ mushrooms in a tomato-based sauce), Gnocchi w/ Rosé sauce (Savour menu was offering it with Gorgonzola cream sauce, but I'm not huge on white sauce), & capped off my meal with Tiramisu.  Polenta - tasted like what my mom used to make me for breakfast...when she ran out of oatmeal.  The cormeal part was bland, but the tomato-based sauce with mushrooms really made up for that.    Gnocchi - similar to the Polenta dish in that the carb portion of the meal was bland.  Gnocchi was from a package, but the server said that the restaurant usually makes it from scratch.  I really wish that I would've gotten a taste of the from-scratch version!  The rosé sauce really stood out on this dish.  Tiramisu - Not made from scratch, not my fav.  Out of the 3 courses, this was my least favourite.  The other options weren't made in-house either and were cheesecake & pumpkin pie, which I assumed was seasonal.  Overall, I think Spigolo's previous Yelp rating was undeserved.  Attentive service, intimate atmosphere, good portions for price, good sauces, and definitely not a 2.5* place!"}
{"text":"Spigolo Ristorante is a small and intimate neighbourhood restaurant. Located in a small strip plaza so it might be a little hard to find in the dark.. trust your GPS!  Nice and quiet when we dropped by for lunch. With my Groupon deals in my smart phone, we got to order 1 app, 2 mains and 2 desserts to share.  Polenta Funghi ($12) -Surprising light and flavoured  - generous portion of oyster mushroom   Veal Funghi ($18) - Veal scaloppini with mushrooms In a brandy sauce - veal was really tender and the sauce has just a light lemony taste well complimented the veal, light yet rich in flavour   Linguine Frutta di Mare aka Seafood Linguine ($19) - Pro Tip: skip the pasta -  White wine tomato sauce was way too salty - pasta is not made in house - seafood though plentiful: clams, scallop, shrimp, calamari and mussels  Tiramisu ($8) and Tartufo ($7) - quite standard quality, didn't make me go wow.. might just skip dessert and have that somewhere else next time  Services is excellent once we warmed up our waitress.   Spiolgo is a cozy and intimate restaurant. I might be back when I am in the area.. but there are so many similar restaurants that serving similar items in the area."}
