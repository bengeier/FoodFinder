{"text":"This is the place to find the most authentic Mexican food in all of Toronto & GTA! The food is fresh and the service is friendly. They have a taco bar where you can pick and choose the sauces and garnishes to customize your tacos and nachos. Prices are very reasonable as well (ex. ~$7.99 for 3 tacos). They also have a drinks menu! Definitely worth the trip to Vaughan for this place!"}
{"text":"How can I give this place more than 1 star if I left the place after 10 min. Nobody greeted us as we came in (me, my wife and 6 yrs old son). The restaurant was half empty so we occupied table in the corner which was not clean. So we sat there for 5 min and none of the waitresses bothered to clean the table or even say hi. No menu, not a smile or even basic attitude. At last waiter told us that it will take much more time to serve this table(!!!) than other (close to kitchen). We've just left the place. By the way the place does not look like a real Mexican court or tavern. My chair was shaky and squeaky.  Advice: do not always trust 5 star ratings and too positive reviews. And I don't understand why yelp put my review as unverified! Strange but lots of negative reviews for this plays are also in the unverified section! I'm the real person and my review is correct!!!  It's a shame that it considered as not recommended review by yelp!"}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant last week after having heard many great things, however, I was extremely disappointed.   I waited...and I am not exaggerating when I say this...40 minutes for three tacos.  After asking the waitress why I had been waiting so long, she informed me that the chef ran short of pineapples for one of my tacos. I quickly switched my order and to my dismay, the entire order was incorrect.   The food was bland, the chicken was not juicy (the white, stringy kind) and overall, the ingredients were sub-par. Do yourself a favour and head to Made in Mexico in Newmarket where I assure you, you will receive excellent food as well as prompt service."}
{"text":"Great service and great food.  The server went to great lengths to explain that it wasn't the type of Mexican food we're all used to but is authentic home quality food.  Menus are very clear and explain the food quite well.  Completely happy with the experience."}
{"text":"First of, the interior and the ambiance is quite cool. The server was very nice and accommodating considering she's manning all the tables alone! We ordered the elotes a la parilla (grilled corn cobs), choriqueso (cheese dip with mexican sausage) for starters. The corn is sweet and tastes okay although the portion is quite small (they cut a whole corn in three) for the price ($9.75). I liked the choriqueso although my friend didn't enjoy it as much. For the main dish, I ordered chicken burrito and my friend got the chilaquiles con pollo. Both dishes are okay, taste wise. Although I would've preferred more flavour, sauce and filling with my burrito. All in all, a pleasant Mexican experience but is not included in my favorites."}
{"text":"I love authentic Mexican food and it's really hard to find in TO, especially in the 905. Maybe you'll find a good tacos al asador, but it'll be in a flour tortilla... or a great burrito, but it'll come with store bought salsa and guacamole...  La Taquiza is like a sit down taqueria because they specialize in authentic tacos. Their pico de gallo is freshly made as well as their other salsas at their walk up salsa bar.  The owner is super friendly and couldn't stop talking about how he imported the tiles from Mexico, how he designed the restaurant by himself, the slow cooking process for his tacos al pastor, how it's so hard to find poblano peppers in TO...  The place is kind of tacky, but hey, I've never been to a restaurant in Mexico that wasn't! The food is what you're here for and it's authentic Mexican. Not bad by TO standards where most people expect their tacos to come with ground beef, sour cream, shredded cheese, and hard tortilla shells!"}
{"text":"The best part of this place? The Salsa! They've got an awesome self-serve salsa bar but when they say it's spicy, it's SPICY. The service isn't the best service I've ever had but it's not bad either. I also tried their Mango Margarita and it was great! I didn't get to try their churros but I saw other people having it when I was there. I'm definitely going back to try it."}
{"text":"We were in the mood for Mexican so we checked out the reviews for this place and thought not so bad, would be a toss up. The only negative thing we had heard was that the food came cold and the service was so-so.  The decor and atmosphere of this place is pretty nice. When they said they had a salsa bar I was expecting more, the salsa cups are very small and the bar was disheveled (and we were there on a Friday night where everything should look tip top shape). There weren't so many salsa options, looked like they had run out of some. And the mild salsa was spicier than the medium, so either they were mismarked...  The food wasn't great. I had the hard tacos, they did actually come out cold I was super surprised about that because it didn't take so long for the food to come. But for the food to come out cold?! Very bad news for a restaurant. The side of rice was a small shot glass with probably about 2 forkfuls of rice.   The service wasn't awful but we've experienced better. If you are just in the mood for whatever mexican food then go for it, but if you are looking for great food then I'd recommend somewhere else.   The other odd thing- some dishes came in a tin foil plate, it was an awful presentation for them."}
{"text":"Food was far too salty.  There was a salsa bar but they did not provide chips.  If you wanted chips you had to pay for them.  I was disappointed with the overall experience.  My friends were very dissatisfied with their food and overall a really poor experience.  We were really excited to eat here and we were really disappointed.  We ordered fajitas and two different kinds of enchiladas and all three of us did not enjoy the food.  Our bill was just under $100 for three people and my friend did complain to the owner.  He was kind and wanted to refund our money but also wasn't open to commentary on the food.  He basically said that this is how the food is made and its too bad that you don't like it.  We all eat authentic Mexican food regularly and I don't really know how anyone could enjoy the food.  It was truly disappointing."}
{"text":"Nice house-made chips, unlimited sauces and good tacos! It is authentic but healthy version. Service was lovely."}
{"text":"I really didn't want to believe the bad reviews so we tried it anyway. the waitress was fantastic but the food is boring and bland. The margaritas tasted like a premix, one of the worst I've tasted, and we tried two different flavours. not sure if nachos come to the table complimentary but we didn't get them. The steak fajitas were terrible. Simply terrible. the steak too rubbery, the veggies too sour, just bad. the steak tacos were better but not worth going to a restaurant for. The soup was nice. the salsas were all crazy spicy so I couldn't even enjoy them to flavour up my boring food. honestly any bar type restaurant makes way better fajitas!"}
{"text":"Went: 12:00 pm Sat Apr 25 2015 Ordered: do not recall Cost: incl. tax and tip $30-35 Comments: I am reviewing restaurants that I've been into in the last 3 months, but I'm forgetting the details. My apologies. The food felt very authentic though I really would not know. Sometimes if cuisine is too authentic, it might be an acquired taste and not to everyone's liking, but I really enjoyed the food here. Bottom line: I would come back again though I like to try new things, so it might not be soon."}
{"text":"Closest thing I've found to LA-style (non-tex-mex) Mexican food in the GTA. Really authentic. Very enjoyable meal."}
{"text":"Don't let the sign deter you away from trying authentic Mexican food!!  Got here at 7pm for dinner with a friend. The server kindly told us that we could sit anywhere without a reservation tag on the table.. which was about half the restaurant, haha, but we got a good spot! I'm guessing this place is so good that people book ahead of time to ensure a table?   For first timers, the server will describe the owner's history and inspiration behind the menu as well as point out their complimentary salsa bar for you to top your own food with.   Honestly everything looks so delicious on the menu and my go to is usually tacos al pastor but they were sold out. I got tacos de pescado ($13.45/3). The fish was grilled instead of fried and it came with a side of black beans. We also got guacamole and chips to share ($7.74). All the food was very filling, hearty and full of flavour! If you like your guac on the chunky side, it definitely comes smooth but their homemade tortilla chips make up for that! The salsa bar is a nice touch but we didn't utilize it as much as I thought - great on our chips though!  Overall, I know I will definitely be back because there is so much more I want to try! Cute decor, spacious seating, lots of variety on the menu and tastes delicious!   Our server was also able to split the bill with no problem including the guac and chips which we found to be very convenient for larger groups."}
{"text":"food here is authentic and tastes good it is also prepared with care.  my friend and i had tortilla chips and guacamole to start. perfect chips except for the liberal sprinkling of salt the guacamole was perfect.  (will ask next time to have the chips to be unsalted)  decor is very nice, a quaint restaurant, the pale yellow walls have real texture giving you that rustic feel. the environment is good for any occassion, and there is some nice Mexican music playing in the background when you dine.   For the food:  i had ordered the Flautas - flour tortilla with beef fillling wrapped rolled and fried. on top of the flautas there was lettuce, tomato, and sourcream. it looked like the flag colours of Mexico cute.. so delicious these flautas were.. I looked forward to each crunch  :)  my friend ordered a dish called the Mole - not too sure how it tastes.. we guys don't share dishes..  :) but I can tell he was pleased with this incarnation. He's ordered this mole dish before before at Mariachi's (Mexican restaurant in Yonge & Eglinton) and it's comparable..    Unique is the dish uses chocolate as an ingredient. the plate looks very unusual. half of your plate is pooled with this brown sauce. will have to try it on my own sometime.  La Taquizza delivers an authentic Mexican experience in the GTA with it's warm rustic atmosphere, friendly service, we will be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"Went here for a group dinner of about 14 guests, including 3 children.  The food is delicious.  And you must try the guac and various salsas.  The salsas are self-serve, so you can indulge as you wish.  And there are tonnes of veggie dishes to choose from, which is great for vegetarians.  Sooo yummy!  The only downside is that the service is a bit on the slow side, although very friendly."}
{"text":"The food here is great... my wife and I come here a couple times a month..lots of food at a fair price. . Best Mexican I've had"}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican, a bit bland for some veggie options but adding Salsa makes it delicious."}
{"text":"Would not recommend and don't plan to return.  Service was slow. They only have one waiter. Tables that required clearing when we arrived have not been cleared even when we had left. The waiter was friendly but she could only do so much. The place was about 1/3 full and she was having a hard time keeping up. The food was all cool when it arrived and it was pretty poor. We ordered the fish tacos (worst I have ever had), enchiladas (edible), guacamole (average). For two people the bill came in over $40. Not worth it at all. Had an upset stomach after the meal.  Had better food at fast food mexican places. Very disappointed and would not give this another try."}
{"text":"Only reason it's not a five, is the atmosphere can use a little livening up. Food is fantastic, service is a little slow, but extremely friendly."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I only have been here the one time and I must say it offered a great authentic taste. I had the chicken enchiladas in the spicy cream sauce. I was worried because I am not a cream sauce fan but the sauce offered so much flavour and spice I absolutely loved it! They give you a generous portion with refried black beans. The salsa bar is a cute and tasty touch as well.  My boyfriend and I split a pitcher of lime margarita and it was delicious (not too sweet). Only let down was my boyfriends burrito was not very good but rather below average. It was cold on the inside and offered no flavour so he pretty much drowned it in a spicy hot salsa. We will definitely return but just not for the burrito."}
{"text":"I found the food bland and the service lackluster. The enchiladas with mole could have used some....spice or something, but I found the salsa was all very forgettable. I went with my husband and my 13 year old son, and none of us were impressed. Although I am used to Southern California style Mexican food (which, from what I understand is not truly authentic), I expected this to at least have some flavor. Especially with all the raves. Meh.   They do, however, have great tortilla chips."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying that I absolutely \"LOVED THIS PLACE.\" A big thank you goes to Ariel G and Jim B for their excellent reviews which led me and my fave Toronto CM gal pal Evelyn W to grab an early dinner here on her last trip up to the 'burbs!  Walking in, La Taquizza is set up to look like you are sitting in a Mexican courtyard (villa?). I liked the vibe quite a bit from the moment we walked in. It was before traditional dinner-time so the restaurant was less busy which meant we got seated right away.  Thirsty on arrival we got what most people order at a Mexican resto - a shaken Margarita! It took time but I attribute that to the servers attention to detail and age. This older gentleman was a master of his craft and served up a fabulous margarita!  Once we'd had time to look over the menu I knew (based on reading other reviews) what I was getting without question: sopa azteca to start, followed by chicken enchiladas with mole. The Aztec soup was, as Ariel G had described but the flavour was unlike anything I'd had before, full of flavour and if not too hungry this soup could easily eat like a meal. The enchiladas that soon followed were excellent as well, and the accompanying mole sauce was excellent. It had the slightest bit of heat on it which helped detract from the sweetness of the dark chocolate used to make the mole.  A great space all around and a great addition was having a fresh self serve salsa bar on hand so you could sauce up your meals with as much or as little mild to hot as you want. I'd recommend (for those who like a bit of heat) go for the Habanero!  Arriiiibbaaaaa Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"Little update to this place.  I came here wanting to give them another try and still craving Mexican food.  This time I had some spicy pork tacos.  They were quite a bit better than the burrito from last time.  Actually, they were quite good and I wouldn't mind having them again some time.  Guess I simply don't like their cornitas burrito."}
{"text":"I have not been to Vaughan Mills in some time, and when  I am in the area, I would typically come and eat at captain nemo fish and chips here beside the Plaza. Same seems to have closed under mysterious circumstances sometime in 2015, I decided to give this place a try. I had the fish tacos and a mango drink for lunch. Everything, including the sauces are hand made in house. The food was good. Place was clean. Hot sauces are hot! The fish tacos comes with a white hot sauce that has some kick to it. My only complaint is that the portions could have been bigger, especially the sides of rice, etc. Hence the 4/5 stars. The waitress, a tall blonde girl, was polite, helpful, and incredibly good looking- almost felt like I was at an earl's location. Overall, I will be back here again."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night after making a reservation. Restaurant was about 75% full when we arrived at 7 but seemed there was only one server working. We got the choriqueso appetizer which came out quickly but was sweeter and greasier than expected. Our entrees and drinks took forever. The pitcher of margaritas came at the same time as the main course, about 30-45 minutes from when we were sat. Steak fajitas were decent but the vegetables were very soggy and overcooked.   Food was too expensive for it's mediocre nature and the poor service. Unfortunately the combination of bad service and below average food will mean I probably won't go back there any time soon."}
{"text":"My sister and I were shopping at Vaughan Mills on Sunday and went to La Taquizza for lunch. Thanks to Yelp's Kris U and others for recommending this place, it is a great find indeed. The restaurant is quite small and nicely decorated. We shared chorizo quesadillas and steak burrito, they were delicious. My sis had black bean soup and she really liked it too. The service was friendly, but they brought us wrong food twice - the second time we were ready to take it as it looked really good :-)  Somebody here on Yelp mentioned mango margaritas, I tried one but didn't like it that much. It was too sweet for my taste.  Anyway, I highly recommend trying out this little place, it is a great value for money."}
{"text":"La Taquiza is a truely authentic Mexican restaurant oddly located in a strip mall next to Vaughan Mills in Vaughan.  I came here with my brother and his wife who is Mexican. They couldn't believe the authentic dishes they had in the menu. I heard a few \"Oh my abuela used to make these!\".   We started off by getting a variety of salsas from the salsa bar. They go from the very mild to the mind blowingly hot. My sister-in-law ordered the cactus salad, made with real cactus, which was apparently delicious.  My brother and I both immediately gravitated towards the Sopa Azteca, which is a delicious, thick spicy soup with slivers of cooked tortilla with a bit of cream.  For our entrees, we went with the taco trio, which allowed us to pick three different types of meat. These tacos are the real mexican style, small, double tortillas, served open faced. You then add your own lime, cilantro and salsa.  We finished it off with wonderful Café de Olla (cinamon flavoured coffee) served in hand-made clay coffee mugs.  The service was quick and friendly and the decor is very much a reminder of Mexico."}
{"text":"Went here with a couple of friends during the holidays because the other Mexican place we wanted to go to was closed. This was the best first Mexican experience for me. They had really tasty food, great options for people that like spicy and non-spicy foods. Their Guacamole and chips were to die for! Highly recommend to try it."}
{"text":"Went to La Taquiza today for lunch.  There was an old guy (perhaps the owner) waiting tables.  He could have used/hired some help.  Fortunately, there weren't many people there at 1 pm.  I had the burrito.  Nothing spectacular.  You can get a better one at Burrito Boys.  Two in our party got the tacos (one beef, one chicken, and one pork).  Perhaps it is authentic to just have the meat in the tortillas, but we were expecting some lettuce, tomato, and shredded cheese.  Ths salsa bar consisted of:  four types of salsa, cilantro, chopped onions, jalapeno peppers, and something else.   If not on the taco, they should have lettuce, tomato, and shredded cheese at the salsa bar.  They don't have beer on tap, but do serve bottled beer.  A Sol is $5.90.  My son got the Huaraches w/Chicken.  He liked it very much.  With the tacos my wife got the rice.  It was good, but not very much.  My son got the beans with his tacos.  They are black beans.  Good, but not a lot.  No sign of refried beans.  I had the soup of the day.  Not sure what it was.  It was tasty, I added some tortilla chips to it.  It was a small amount of soup.  The fact that it was served in a giant bowl did not help with the perceived portion.  Oh yea...concerning tortilla chips.  They are not complimentary.  If you want chips and guac it costs $6.25.  They did not offer nachos as an appetizer.    Sodas are $2.45 with free refills.  Most entrées are around $8-9.   I noticed a patron discussing his bill with the waiter when we walked in.  Upon review, we found multiple errors on our bill....so you might want to double check the bill when it comes.    Overall, the place was clean.  The bathrooms were very clean.    Portions could be bigger.  Salsa bar was a disappointment.    Perhaps I was looking for a little more Tex-Mex rather than authentic Mexican."}
{"text":"Went for second time this evening. Service was sub par. The server made several mistakes and didn't clarify she understood the order.  Food was awful. My burrito had no taste and was really dry. It was supposed to have cheese and sour cream but there was no way it had either. Normally burritos are saucy but thus was just bland and had no flavor. Even adding salsa from the salsa bar did nothing to help it out.  Speaking of the salsa bar, they offer all you can eat salsa but you have to order the chips separate. $7.50 for the chips and mediocre guacamole is quite steep. Chip should be unlimited if the salsa is.  Definitely won't be coming back. And to add insult to injury I am suffering severe indigestion from the 1/2 burrito I managed to eat."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here on a whim and were not disappointed. The lovely lady who works there was super friendly, helpful and knowledgeable. We ordered the nachos with the verde salsa and were  Blown away by the flavour of the fresh Salsas at the salsa bar (included when dining in). We also both ordered enchiladas and they were amazing as well. Next time I hope we have a DD so we can try some Of the cool drinks they have !"}
{"text":"Wasn't a huge fan.  Ordered the chicken flour tacos.. they had absolutely no flavor (but were double shelled-- authentic!).  When asked if they had hot sauce, they said no?  Found that to be odd for a Mexican restaurant... On a positive note, this restaurant is nicely decorated, with traditional Mexican touches and accents.  The staff is friendly and attentive.  All you can eat salsa.  Prices were slightly high... not quite sure I'll be back."}
{"text":"Excellent authentic, fresh Mexican. Corn tortillas perfectly soft but still hold together. Well balanced guacamole. Decor nothing special, it's in a strip mall for gosh sake. Way better than expected."}
{"text":"A true little gem in Vaughan! There's not many Mexican restaurants in Vaughan to begin with (with the exception of the fast food kind ie: Much Burrito, burrito burrito etc), but Im so happy that the one place we know of turned out to be great! Sometimes I get a bit skeptical on trying out new places that I never heard of (because I don't want to be disappointed), but this place was definitely one of the place that didn't disappoint.  This place serves all kinds of authentic Mexican food and prices were very fair. I had the shrimp tacos and my husband had the steak dinner with rice and baked beans, they were both tasty! Theres also a salsa bar that had a variety of salsas/dressings that you can add to your food which was a nice touch to our meals. It was quite fresh and flavourful.   The service is awesome! We were greeted right away when we got in, and  our server was the most friendliest woman ever! She was very attentive, personable, and made us feel very welcomed. She made us feel like we were a guest in her own home. We also had our 1 and a half year old child with us, and she was super sweet to him.  Awesome food and service! Already told a few people about this place. Will definitely be coming back here."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of authentic Mexican food ( I travel extensively through out US ) and I have to say that most Mexican restaurants in the GTA are mediocre to bad compared to the Mexican food I eat in California/ Florida/ Texas. I have to say that Taquizza is as good as I've experienced in the Toronto area. Most of the food is made in house and you can taste the difference.  The tacos really are authentic street tacos with double soft shells made in house and the ability to dress them at the self service condiment bar ( pico de gallo , onion, cilantro, fresh lime, hot sauce ) . Reading some of the lower scoring reviews I think some people prefer the \" gringo\" style ..i.e.  cheese, sour cream and other non- traditional ingredients . I also think their tortilla chips are fantastic, unlike the mass produced one's that most restaurants serve. They are much thicker and have a wonderful corn flavour that I can't find anywhere else in the GTA. I have to give La Taquizza 5 stars compared to all the other mediocre Mexican restaurants in the city. ( It would be 3 stars compared to my favorite  place's  in Carlsbad CA and San Diego) But when I factor everything in, this is my go to place to placate my need for authentic Mexican food and the prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"I went here after a full day of Black Friday shopping this year (2017). I was searching for restaurants close by and it popped up.   The restaurant is so close to Vaughn Mills mall so it was very convenient.   When we arrived, the first thing I noticed was that it had a very mom & pop feel to it. It is a smaller restaurant (40-50 seats). We were seated and got the guac and tortilla which was amazing. The chips were like the ones you get in Mexico and the DR - they are made in house.   They were very accommodating to food allergies as I was there with someone who had a dairy allergy.   The servers were very friendly. They were busy but you never felt like you weren't be treated well. It was only two people but they were lovely.   I ordered the enchiladas. They were yum. Portion size was good. I was stuffed after I left and the food was hot and fresh when I got it.   If you're in the area and looking for a place to grab a quick bite and not interested in going to the regular spots, give it a try. It's a very chill place so you don't feel rushed at all.   I'll be back. :)"}
{"text":"This is my second time visiting this restaurant. Ambience could be better. It feels more like a fast-food restaurant than an actual dine-in restaurant. The guacamole is very good. Chips are freshly fried. I had the shrimp tacos which had great flavour. My friend had the chicken burrito and she liked it a lot too. Service was a bit lacking. The restaurant was full (Sunday afternoon) and they had one server. She was a good server unfortunately she was overworked which caused her to forget a few things. Overall, it was satisfactory."}
{"text":"HOLY MOLE!!!  This homesick California girl has spent a lonnngggg nine months in this beautiful city without some \"real\" Mexican food. Alas my search ended here. We started with a cold Negro Modelo, chips, cilantro, and salsa from the bar. From there, I ventured into the pork with mole sauce and a lime margarita..... All around the table were satisfied bellies!! Ohhhhh baby, we'll be back for more delicious and authentic food that is served up by a very friendly staff. Ole'!!!!! Viva el mole!!!!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly busy place with one waiter.  I tried fish taco and Rhe Maxican nacho plate with homemade Tortila/guacamole.  The nacho was very good. Crunchy warm deliciousness.   But my main meal was disappointing.  The taco didn't come with the typical condiments like tomato, lettuce, sour cream. Unable to enjoy, ended up asking for them and it took a while to get.  Only one waiter was serving about 6-7 tables.   And most importantly, the fish was tough like it has been over cooked in a microwave.  The supposedly grilled basa fish had cotton like texture and chewy, and the soft shell was also chewy and tasteless."}
{"text":"I've bee here since it opened, which at the time I was so excited for a local Mexican joint.  Since I have been half a dozen times, never a great experience but never bad.  I like the serve yourself condiments.  Biggest compliance last time was the lamb stew ( I forget the Mexican name).  It had such potential but was sooo overly salted."}
{"text":"Ordered take out from here last week because I needed something to take on the road. I definitely want to come back and dine in because I feel like although everything tasted great, it would of tasted even better eating it in the restaurant.   I also say this because I think if you are able to dine in, you can take full advantage of the salsa bar that they have here! They still give you containers to put salsa in for your take out, but if you're trying something out for the first time at a new place it would probably be better if you experienced it there. We had some great salsa to take out but not enough of it, so we ran out when we were eating our food.   Overall I would come back to eat in but probably not take out again!"}
{"text":"This is hands down the best Mexican place I have been to in GTA. Maybe living in Detroit for years within a short driving distance of Mexican town has spoiled me, but I find most Mexican food in the GTA to SUCK. I'm not sure why. However this place was really good. I enjoyed the food, they had dos equis, the chips and salsa was good. I definitely would go back, the only downside is it's in Concord, which is like.. middle of nowhere IMO. Oh well."}
{"text":"I have never had to deny food from anyone, I eat everything, the rice was old al pastor tacos taste like sweet and sour sauce mixed with pork and when a server was asked for a recommendation she said \"I don't know I don't like Tacos\". Worst Mexican place I've ever been to."}
{"text":"3-Star considering that I've never had AUTHENTIC Mexican and basically have nothing Mexican to compare to except Taco Bell, I'm sorry to say.  I stepped in the DOOR seeing a couple ladies coming out holding a piece of CAKE in a take-out container.  YUP, I did hold the doors for the ladies.  My Pleasure!  We found ourselves here with a Mexican-theme decor that began from the uneven Mexican-ly orange tiles all the way to the top of the windows where a few CLAY statues and heads/masks.  Everything inbetween made this place as Mexican as a long-time Torontonian can imagine without ever been to Mexico.  Greeted by an elderly man with a couple of menus, which i made out some items such as Quesadilla, Taco, Burritos where others were foreign to me which was great.  We ordered Taco AL PASTOR which came with either side of Rice or Beans.    Inside of the Soft Double Wrapped Taco I noticed a mixture of Onions and Pork much like Pulled Pork.  Here's where the Salsa Bar came in to play.  I tried the more MELLOW flavours of Pico de Gallo and Medium Green Tomatillo Salso.    Pico de Gallo was a FRESH contrast to the Pork mixture inside the Taco.  The Tomatillo Salsa was nicely spiced as well and that was as far as I went knowing I'm going back to work right after and didn't want any unintended accidents.  The Bar also had Limes, Onions, Cilantros for your pleasure.  Prices are reasonable but it wasn't a meal that I felted FULLY stuffed, but I guess I have been over stuffing myself lately.  The Tacos were served laided on top of one another and because of the mixture inside, the side laying down got a bit too SOGGY which made it hard to hold as it almost fell apart.  Triple Wrapping required???  Tres Leches Cake($5.00) was actually a nice finish for the Mains.  The Sponge Cake looked soaked from Milk while the top had some Whip Cream and the plate was full of Evaporated Milk.  I HEART this cake, simple & delicious. Soaked but NOT soggy Tres Leches Cake, awesome stuff Mexico!  We also had a couple Soda Juices(Mango, Mandarin) (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarritos) which were made in Mexico that helped to complete this Mexican vacation of mine.  I could SMELL the Mango while drinking it."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and always leave well fed and satisfied. Great authentic food, service is great always coming by to ask about refills on drinks or tortilla chips. The home made salsa & guacamole are great!"}
{"text":"Sometimes going out the way pays off in a big way. I have always been an aficionado of real Mexican food. In North America we are invariably offered \"Mexican food\" which is nothing but....  This is a gem of place in one of the 'satellites' of Vaughan Mills. You are initially greeted by a simple Mexican decor that is not overdone.  The menu is varied but not overwhelming. They do not try to be everything to everybody, but their offerings are interesting and HOME MADE. This includes the salsa bar where a variety of salsas in varying degrees of heat are presented. The only slight reservation that I had about this place is that they use a lot of flour tortillas. Corn would be a whole lot better.  I began my lunch with a Sopa Azteca. This rich soup is tomato and chili based and provides a thick warm and full blown taste. It contains Tortillas strips, avocado and cheese and has been thickened with sour cream and sprinkled with a bit of queso. It was totally delicious. The ladies shared a Sopa de Frijoles (Black bean soup), which was much easier on the tomato but had a nice lightly spiced taste.  I then ordered an Enchilada de Mole Poblano which consists of 3 well sized enchiladas in a Mole (Sauce) of Poblano peppers finished with Chocolate. This is served with Rice and black beans. The sauce is absolutely terrific and would not be out of place in a \"name\" restaurant. It is that awesome. You can have this dish as a vegetarian dish, but I chose to have it with chicken. I was keeping as close to tradition as possible since chocolate mole is usually served for festive occasions with turkey.  The ladies shared the classic quesadillas which extremely good and then shared a carnitas burrito. Now that was a burrito....not the designer items that pass in other restaurants for Burritos. The salsas complemented all our meals which was accompanied by Sol Beer. Unfortunately we all were too full for dessert.  I was so sure that this restaurant would feature Menudo (my favorite Mexican soup/meal), and it does! It is made for special occasion and is featured on their web site. I will be going there again soon.   Throw off your corporate restaurant Mexican food blahs and treat yourself to the real thing!"}
{"text":"Nothing much to brag about here.  The fajitas are terrible.  I am surprised that a Mexican restaurant would make them this poor.  The salsa bar has since diminished in size and quality since they opened their doors.  Expensive and lacks Mexican taste.  I will never return.  Save your money....you will be disappointed."}
{"text":"I thought I would try again, seeing as I was in the area. $30 for lunch and I left still hungry. I had a ceviche as an appetizer, which looks much better on the menu. It was good, not for $9.75. For the main I had the Chirizo Hueracha, which is about the size of a bruschetta appetizer. Again, another $9.75. It was thin in both substance and taste. I kept adding the ceviche to beef up the flavour. Add a coke and a small side of guac and I was just south of $30.   Nope..."}
{"text":"I'm giving it 4 stars because of their salsa bar, which is ok and nothing great but at least you get to take all you want and can choose between 3-4 different types. The food was average, as I've had much better and authentic Mexican food; however this is the most authentic Mexican I've found in Vaughan so far. It's run by some Irish women, which is why it's their interpretation of what is authentic Mexican. Nevertheless, good food. Their michelada, however, was horrendous, as they made it with some prepackaged liquid and just poured beer into it. Best ones are made from scratch"}
{"text":"This is very average.  The steak tacos come bare with nothing in them but steak.  The fish tacos are pretty bland.  Burrito is also bland and not filling.   In terms of authenticity, I've eaten in Mexico many times and this place is as authentic as a Gucci purse purchased at pacific mall.   Ingredients are fresh.  Tacos need major face lift.  There's a Salsa bar? For what reason I don't know.  There is three types of salsa.  Mild medium and hot.  Why not just give us a frigen bowl of each instead of these tiny little cups that literally holds 10 drops.   Why should I have to keep going up to this stupid salsa bar to refill my tiny cup with contaminated hepatitis A salsa."}
{"text":"Me and a friend were craving some Mexican and usually head downtown to grab some tacos at Wilbur, but thought we should give this place a shot. Should have known better when we walked in and saw no customers and flies around the salsa bar. We ordered cause we were hungry had the corn, guacamole and tacos. Corn wasn't the best but edible, guacamole tasted like it was on the top shelf of the fridge had a couple ice chunks and tacos were by far the worst nothing in it just some meat and old tortillas."}
{"text":"This review is based on my very first visit here.  All I can tell is I like this place and I will just come back again for their homemade corn chips.  I will make sure I order more to take-out next time.  Their fish taco is certainly on my list to try next time too.  We ordered Fajitas for 2.  It was not a wow but sizzling hot and tasted just right.  It was a big portion and I ended up packed it for my lunch next day.  A good value!  The mango margarita I ordered was so refreshing.  I will not hesitate to order this drink again.  Our very friendly server asked if we wanted their homemade Totopas to start with.  I thought, at first, it would be a complimentary snack size for the drinks.  Ended up, it was a huge portion and was charged for $7.75.  Well, it was well worth it.  Trust me, the corn chips were even better the next day after reheating from the oven.  The guacamole might be a little bland in taste when comparing to those at other Mexican restaurants.  However, I find it was just good enough for my taste.  I guess their homemade salsa could help adjust the taste as you wish.  The restaurant has a nice patio on the side with lots of sun.  Yeah, Summer patio here I come :)"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere.  Very friendly staff. We ordered the pablano and black bean soup. Black bean was great. The chicken in the pablano soup was definitely old/frozen.  For dinner we ordered the veggi fajitas as we were put off the meat. Extremely salty. We couldn't even finish it. Don't think we will return."}
{"text":"Let's start with what catches everyone's eye: the funky decor! I love how fun and open the vibe is! The service was hard to compete with; our server was sweet, friendly and funny to boot! We had a lot of fun talking to her and she was very quick to help us with our questions which we really appreciated.   The food was pretty good. What was surprising to me was that the most delicious thing that caught me off guard was the rice that was a side dish! Oh my goodness it stole the show for me!! *Drool-worthy!* If you have a chance to go, try it out :)"}
{"text":"Not the typical fast food burrito place. They have a nice range of different options you won't find at most other Mexicans restaurants.  All of it is very tasty and good value.  Very good choice."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in the city! I just recently discovered this place and I wish I had known about it years ago! The service is pretty good and the ambience is very nice and cozy. I've only been here a couple times, but each time the food was amazing and the prices are very fair. A must try!"}
{"text":"I must say for the location the food is fantastic. It's authentic and true to what Mexican home cooking should taste like.  That being said, I find the prices high for few reasons You're in a strip mall around Vaughan Mills. I know your rent isn't high You require guests to get their own salsa. Sure it's an experience but I have to get up midst my meal just to get sauce. Why am I at a sit down? App, 2 mains, 1 dessert and 1margarita cost $70? That doesn't include tip.... Again steep in my opinion..  So in short if the pricing was more reasonable of I'd go here more. But given what we paid for 2 adult dinners I'd rather go downtown with better ambience and view....  Food is good though.. Just pricey for what you get."}
{"text":"Fish taco, it is the only thing I remember from La Taquizza.  Because the fish fillet was grilled/pan fried, the way I enjoy it.  The fish fillet, lightly seasoned and grilled without breading, was fresh and chunky.  It was served naked on double soft corn tortilla with a slice of avocado, some pickled onion stripes and a bit of cheese.  There was an open salsa bar.  Patrons put whatever sauces, salsa (spicy or not), diced onion, diced tomato, cilantro, chili that they want.  Hurt yourself if you desire to.  The fish filet was a little bit oilier than I like, but the taco was delicious.  La Taquizza is the only restaurant I can find in York region that serves it grilled, so I know I will return.  Lastly, just in case you wonder, the fish taco here is authentic and old fashioned.  If I cannot possibly find another Mexican restaurant in York Region that serves grilled fish tacos, I will no doubt increase the rating to 5 stars."}
{"text":"Pleasant ambience and friendly but slightly too ingratiating service.  The food wasn't bad but on the whole, nothing to write home about and prices were high.  Homemade chips were actually first rate, but I am used to Mexican restaurants in Chicago which (at least in 2008 when I left) provide these for free.  I ordered the chicken mole as I have not had it for a long time and had a craving for it.  The mole had too much chocolate and needed a little more spice and the chicken, in a rather small amount of filling, was dry.  A burrito and another dish were just so-so, and a margarita was way too stingy with the tequila given its price.  If you have had Mexican food in the States or in Mexico this will probably be a disappointment."}
{"text":"I'd call this place a safe option: everything is decent, nothing knocked my socks off.  I eat here semi-regularly because it's really hard to get decent Mexican food in Toronto, other than burritos.  The food is authentic enough.  Portions are slightly on the small side.  The menu does a good job of explaining what you're going to get, and even what the origin of each dish is.  The place is clean and I like the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday afternoon and there were only a few tables being served. Inside was decorated just like if you were in Mexico. It reminded me of when I was in Cancun.   I liked how there was a buffet style cart where you get your own sauce/salsas which ranged from mild to spicy. I tried the spiciest one and it had some kick to it but nothing too serious.   Classic cheese quesadillas $8.95 - A very simple dish but done right. Tons of cheese inside the three quesadillas. I was surprised it didn't come with a side like rice or beans.   Tacos de pescado (Fish tacos) $13.45 - large chunks of fish inside the tacos. All the veggies and the avocado were so fresh. Combined with one of the spicy salsas made the tacos taste even better and it was simply delicious. It came with three tacos and a side of beans. The meal was filling and tasted great.  Service was very friendly and quick."}
{"text":"We were pleased to be seated around 6pm on Cinqo de Mayo for dinner. People kept streaming in after us and it was clear they were inappropriately staffed and getting slammed.  It took 10 minutes to get our order taken and then drinks and our guacamole came over fast. The only other thing that happened fast in the close to *two hours* we were there, was them clearing and giving away our table while we were in the washroom!  We had asked our server to pack up our substantial leftovers and bring the bill while we quickly went to the washroom. We came back to a family sitting at our table - not their fault as they had been seated there.  So we stood, holding up the wall in the middle of the restaurant, while they printed up our bill and had us pay at the cash register. They offered to cook us both entire fresh meals to take home and so I said only my kid's. We then continued to hold up the wall waiting while they made it. Why they did not offer to comp an item, which would have been faster, I don't know.  As we were leaving my kid was lamenting her poor tacos all alone in the garbage. At that point we both started laughing. Ridiculous.   We had been to the restaurant before and it was fine, but tonight was our last visit. The food was good, but irrelevant given the circumstances."}
{"text":"I met a friend for lunch here last week since it was close to Vaughan Mills. I remember coming here about 3 or 4 years ago and back then, would have easily given it 4 stars for their salsa bar, fajitas, chips and tacos. After dining here again though, I would go with more of a 3 star rating since overall, the food we ordered was good but not as amazing as I remembered.   We shared the fish tacos, as well as cantina style tortilla chips with guacamole. The chips were really good (great corn flavour!) and the guacamole tasted very fresh. It was a good portion for two. The three fish tacos we got were filled with fresh veggie toppings but the fish itself tasted bland. It definitely could have used more seasoning since it tasted just okay. Then, the salsa bar had a few choices depending on the amount of heat that you want (mild, medium, hot) - just as I remembered. Overall, a good meal but it didn't wow me like the other time... not sure if it's because I ordered some type of meat fajitas and enchiladas that time. Anyway, not bad at all for the prices, nice service and the ambience is a fun villa type of setting. I would give it another chance in the future by ordering something different and getting drinks too."}
{"text":"Amazing service.  Great hot sauces that is self serve.  Quick and hot.   Unfortunately my friends and I didn't love the steak tacos and shrimp tacos were virtually tasteless.    The guacamole was too mashed like it came from a bag.   I was disappointed with the food considering the amount of positive reviews.   I won't be back unless they make some changes in their food."}
{"text":"PRO: A salsa counter allows you to take as much pico de gallo or salsa verde as you want. The vegetarian potato tosadas are nice and the enchiladas de mole poblanos were awesome!  CON: Small staff and sloooow service. Wait times will increase considerably when you come in a large group. Food could have been kept under heat lamps, as most of our dishes came luke-warm.  CONCLUSION: Definitely authentic and definitely worth revisiting!  4.5/5 stars"}
{"text":"We lived in Mexico for several years so are always looking for authentic restaurants. La taquizza does a good job.  Their menu is diverse and includes many of our favourite dishes you don't typically find in Canada.  The food is much better in house than as take out.  We have ordered many dishes off the menu and love anything carnitas and the fact that they have decent corn tortillas. The huraches are great too. I am a bit biased about the tacos al pastor since I lived in Puebla, but they are still ok. Can't miss the mandatory churros though. They are amazing!"}
{"text":"La Taquizza could be the best Mexican restaurant in Canada.    I say \"could be\" because my sample size includes Taco Bell, Taco Time, Taco Delmar, and a place in Prince George better than the others I mentioned (despite the bar being set pretty low).  But I dare any place to be better.    Full disclosure, I was in Toronto for a tech symposium.  Two hundred of us rode in antique school busses like refugees from Kosovo, eventually finding ourselves near Vaughn Mills.  The organizers found it appropriate to pile us into a bowling alley and hand us alcohol.  It had a buffet, but after perusing its depressing selection, I found every excuse to leave and locate an alternative.  After only a few minutes, I found this jewel, and despite finding other I`m sure worthwhile alternatives, I couldn't keep that one out of my head...more because of a misunderstanding I had with the name.    You see, the full name on the sign read, \"La Taquizza - Mexican Flavour at its Best\".  Here`s the thing: the name \"La Taquizza\" is obscured within a funky logo which, from fifty feet away, resembles oddly enough laundry, and the words ``at its Best`` are not only in a different, smaller font, they're blocked behind pillars built with the intent of mimicking a more ethnic fascia.  The result, I thought the actual name of the restaurant was \"Mexican Flavour\".  ...there`s nothing I can add that will make that sound funnier.    \"Well, when you're in the mood for flavour, it better be Mexican.\"  You see, I added eleven words to that joke and it still didn`t get any funnier.  No matter what other options I had, nothing had a leg up on \"Mexican Flavour\" (I even use air quotes when saying that aloud), even that Chinese place called Szechuan Szechuan--the place so obviously mediocre, they named its boring cuisine twice.  Every time I say \"Mexican Flavor\", I want to put a flourish on it, like waving my hand slowly across the sky like a marque.  Try it, \"Mexican...Flavour.\"    But it's called La Taquizza, so let`s move on.  This restaurant is gorgeous.  It's not what a Mexican restaurant looks like in Mexico.  It's not what a Mexican restaurant looks like in Southern California.  It's what a Mexican restaurant looks like in a Fast and the Furious film.  I kept expecting Toretto and a Paul Walker body double to walk in (oh, I made myself feel bad).  I can`t help but tap my feet to the new age Latino music drumming from the speakers.  The cute waitress made a point to \"warn\" me about the cuisine, claiming that La Taquizza was owned by a Mexican family and as such, offers more authentic cuisine, and that I should read the entries in full so I know what I'm getting into.   It was like a salesman warning me about buying a Ferrari because they have a tendency of getting their driver's laid--that's how awesome this conversation was.  She had no idea how much I fell in love with this place based on what she said.  And I have never been more swept up in a menu either.  The dishes were all described in exquisite detail.  I was getting hungrier each page I turned.  My stomach was going crazy and I was about five minutes from just ingesting the menu.  Untranslated Mexican names loomed over color descriptions embellished with words of tradition and historical origins.  I'd order the entire damned menu if I could.  Eventually I settled into sopes de chorizo (\"little cravings served with refried beans, our home made chorizo, fresh cheese and onions\") and tacos de chilorio (\"slow-roasted pork marinated with onion and chili sauce\").  If I was to make one suggestion before returning to the acclaim, it would be to offer half portions.  Everything on this menu appears designed for sharing.  There were three tortillas and three tacos, and if there were three of me, we would've ordered three more.  If there were half orders (two or even one per serving), I'd have kept ordering and maybe even topped the whole thing with a dessert.  It could be the closest thing to Mexican tapas (hey, there's an idea!).  Alas, despite it being, as said, the best Mexican food I've had in my short life, I couldn't handle more than two dishes.  That, along with the sangria I ordered, came to a reasonable $30 with tip.  I wanted to fit in the tres leches cake.  The waitress actually said, \"Cake of 3 milks,\" but I knew what she was talking about.  I even tried to go for a walk and squeeze in some room, maybe visit the bathroom for a bowel movement--maybe that would help.  No luck.  If I could, I would have gone back the next day just for the cake.  They didn't offer a half-order for that either.  I asked.    I returned to the bowling alley and quietly gloated over the empty buffet platters that once held dried hot wings and flat pizza.  Then I found the complimentary ice cream...so I had three scoops.    I'm sorry!  I'm weak!!  Food:  4/5 Service:  4/5 Presentation:  3/5 Value:  5/5  Recommendation:  4/5"}
{"text":"Amazing food. This is the best carne asada tacos that I've been able to find. Simple ingredients, and cooked perfectly every time. The chips and guacamole is incredible. The chicken flautas are also amazing. The customer service has been excellent every time I've been here. We love the self serve salsa bar that also has cilantro and lime if you want to add to your taco which just comes with meat. The salsa verde is perfectly spicy. I can't say enough good things about this restaurant."}
{"text":"Great place. Good home made food. I really enjoyed the Chicken Mole.   Very nice taste. Good service.   What I will say though is sometimes the lineups are out the door so be cautious with your time. If youre in a rush on a saturday night, dont bother."}
{"text":"I went to La Taquizza with my mother one winter night because we wanted Mexican and that was the closest place to where she lives. The reviews on Urbanspoon and Yelp seemed favourable for the most part, so we figured we'd give it a shot.  The service was good, they actually moved tables just to get us a seat (there was very little seating available) and the waitresses and host/owner(?) seemed very welcoming. Food came quite fast as well.  Unfortunately, that is where the good ends. My mom got the enchiladas sauzas (in tomato cream sauce) with chicken filling. I got the mole poblano pork. I have to say, I've been to 4-5 Mexican restaurants in Toronto and this by far was the worst and most disappointing.  The pork was inedible. The sauce, which reeked and tasted strongly of some Asian flavouring I couldn't put my finger on, was oversalted to the point of me trying to wipe it off just to get through some of the actual meat. The meat... it was so chewy my jaw actually hurt after a few pieces. I've tasted good mole in Toronto, despite our sad lack of Mexican places, and this was not even close to what mole should be like. Terrible.  My mother's enchiladas were sadly no better. The sauce lacked all flavour, the chicken inside was scarce and the pieces she did find were dry and flavourless. The corn tortillas themselves were gummy and too thick and the ratio of filling to tortilla was completely off (very little filling).  I don't like complaining to the staff and/or managers about food but perhaps I should start because that meal was the worst one I've had in a long time. We got through some of the food and made our way out, politely declining to take the remainders of that disgrace to Mexican food with us.  Very disappointing. If you want proper Mexican food, please go to Dos Amigos on Bathurst (north of Dupont). Their food is amazing and their mole sauce is to die for, in my honest opinion. Save your stomach, if not money."}
{"text":"The burrito carnitas was pretty good, and not filled with refried beans. The salsa bar is a nice touch. However, as mentioned above, nothing is given away for free. I ordered guacamole for my burrito, and there may have been a teaspoons' worth inside ( at .90 ?! extra). The tables outside are made with unglazed tiles, and are therefore kinda gross with all kinds of stains and mystery marks. If you are in the area or have the time, try La Mexicanada in Bradford."}
{"text":"So, I went here last night for dinner with my parents and my 2 kids. I grew up in Texas, and really appreciate authentic Mexican food, and this place definitely delivered!  Everything from the decor to the wait-staff really added to the experience. I had the chicken enchilada, and it's flavors were really good. Their home made guacamole also was pretty good (not as good as my wife's, but a close 2nd.) The one criticism I have is that because the place is small, and they take reservations, you could be waiting a while even though  half the tables are empty (with reserved signs on them). The fact is, they probably shouldn't take reservations, or they should get a consultant in to create a system so that at least half the place isn't reserved at any given time (but that's just my opinion). All in All, this is one of the BEST Mexican places I've eaten at north of the border!"}
{"text":"We have been trying to try this place for quite some time now, about a year maybe, as it was recommended to us by a friend. Well, today is the day, we finally got to La Taquizza, as we were craving some good authentic mexican cuisine.  Now first thing first, the place is okay-is looking, looks kinda more like a take out casual restaurant rather than a casual dine-in, and it's fairly small, maybe 40-50 seats tops, so they can really upgrade the place upside down.  Food is okay, not the best Mexican I have tried, and I haven't tried that many to start with. It definitely has all the authentic dishes, but the quality is not the bestest, in terms of both flavours and presentation.  We ordered many things as we like to try new things, and nothing really stood out in any of the things we ordered.  Service is not the best neither, considering that the place had only 2 tables (including us), with 2 servers where one of them was on training, you would expect a top notch best service cuz you're basically half of the restaurant traffic at this point, and this new server should shadow a 100% top class server.  Empty plates sit around, no ones comes to take your orders, things take forever, and so on and so forth. I was excited about this place but unfortunately i don't think we will come back."}
{"text":"We went over today for lunch and shared the Azeca soup as well as the Chalupas. The soup was really good and the chalupas were great when paired with the salsas from the free salsa bar. I really liked that they let you dress the food up your way when it came to the salsas. Will definitely go back again to try some of the meat options."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I love Mexican Food. LOVE . When this restaurant opened we were one of the first to try it. The owners were uber friendly and walked us through their menu (as everything is authentic Mexican...not that Tex Mex stuff you find at Chili's , etc). Since our initial visit we've been back at least 10 times, trying different fares as the menu has vastly expanded.The mole sauce is incredible. enchillada great, etc. As I said earlier, this is NOT Tex Mex food....it is authentic Mexican, so do not go expecting the same fare you would find elsewhere...be adventuresome and try something out of the norm ! I would score higher, but the last couple of visits have been disappointing. Food arrived cold, service was slower than normal. Other than those two small complaints...excellent food and I continue to go back"}
{"text":"This place was a poor excuse for authentic Mexican food. The burrito was soggy and the fajita was sub par at most. My burrito was served with steamed broccoli....at a Mexican restaurant??!!  I would never return to this restaurant again. We were genuinely confused with the reviews after eating our meal and leaving most of it on our plate."}
{"text":"Shame on me for trusting you yelpers! Very expensive for sub par food.. I feel cheated!  Cold tasteless mole enchiladas  and the fajitas were just a soggy stew of beef peppers and onions.   The dishes were made from food sitting in a steam table.  It is so sad that the rice was made with frozen vegetables for the price you pay.  I was shocked that I got this low level of food... based on how the pictures looked. . But buyer beware. . Looks can be deceiving. .  I will not be going back here again.  I did however like the salsa bar.."}
{"text":"Reading all reviews made me so excited , but ... I liked the place and the food was ok although I think it was a bit pricey compared to other Mexican restaurants with the same vibe .  But it wasn't what I was hoping for , I don't know maybe I'm more used to the Americanized version of Mexican food ."}
{"text":"Toronto isn't known for it's Mexican food, so when my partner in crime to the north, Kris U, suggested we go to Vaughan for Mexican, I was more than skeptical.   When we pulled into a strip mall, skepticism turned to food poisoning fear. What in the world is he thinking? \"Is it good?\" \"I don't know... I haven't been.\" Christ on a cracker, this does not seem like a good idea, I thought to myself, but I went with the flow.   OK. Here it is. I, Evelyn W, was wrong*. This place is delicious.  The front of house guy is older and slower, but he's taking his time to get it right. He and his wife own the place and are actually Mexican. We each had a margarita (can't go wrong). shared the chalupitas (delicious) and I had the beef tacos. As far as this little Nova Scotian knows, everything was really authentic and it all had a nice kick. I'm obviously not an expert on Mexican food, but I've been to Mexico and I eat Old Elpaso Kits, and this meal was much closer to Meh-hee-co than my fave yellow taco boxes.   The decor was bright, and there was a little hut inside the restaurant over the bar. Adorable.   PEPPER POINTS: For the all you can eat salsa bar. Try 'em all!   *It shan't happen again!"}
{"text":"Excellent Family run restaurant. Loved the Salsa bar and my Sopa Asteca and main course tasted amazing. Everything here is home made and high quality, the salsas are simply the best I have had. I read mixed reviews, but decided to try it for myself. I am very glad I came I highly recommend you try it."}
{"text":"We went there at 7pm on a Sunday night. Given the limited availability and quality of Mexican food in Toronto, I would say the food was quite good but the poor rating is mainly for the service. That is not to say that the one server that night was not good. He was trying extremely hard, but he was the only one staffing this place including the bar. Obviously the service was painfully slow. Even the hyped self serve salsa bar was a mess and reminders were needed to replenish it. I wouldn't go back in a hurry and certainly not on a weekend."}
