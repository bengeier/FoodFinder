{"text":"Terrible terrible service. Food is mediocre at best. And when we placed an order today they sent us the wrong order. When trying to sort this out they would not accept responsibility, and did not even apologize. Don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"There beef donair is top notch very juicy. Sweet sauce they use is money! Great staff, nice clean shop!"}
{"text":"Awesome spot. Just opened a month ago. Owners are very friendly and the food is exactly what you hope for when you're in the mood for authentic shawarma. Don't forget to add a couple of pieces of baklava to your order. Two thumbs up"}
{"text":"Found this place by mistake as it opened up in June 2017. And it's my favorite South Calgary Chinook mall area shawarma/donair.   Price - 9/10 Food - 8.5/10  Service - 8/10 Space/seating - 9/10  AL madina is the perfect place to itch your shawarma/donair craving. Prices are are very reasonable and portions are similar to what you get elsewhere.  The food quality is very good and veggies taste fresh. The shop was clean, the staff are straightforward and the music was authentic.   The best part is there is lots of room to sit with a friend or if you want to get some work done.   Can't go wrong with this one. Will upgrade to 5 stars after my 3rd visit if it's this consistent"}
{"text":"The people were nice, but I didn't like the food at all! I ordered the chicken skewer plate. Everything in the dish seemed off, even the hummus, the chicken was bland and I didn't like having fries with it. Roasted potatoes would be a better option. I was excited to try this place out too, only to be so disappointed.  I won't be back. :( I've had waaayyy better!"}
