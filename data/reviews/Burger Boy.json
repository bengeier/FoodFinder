{"text":"Good burgers for out of the freezer patties, nothing too special, just decent greasy spoon stuff,"}
{"text":"This place will meet expectations and deliver value, if your expectations are tempered. 

This is not artisinal hamburgers. It's country style dirty burgers with may and burger juice dripping down your hand.

Utilitarian setup which meets the owners' needs. A nice throwback in time to the mid eighties.

Best giant lunch I've had for under $10 in a long time."}
{"text":"Usually reviews are a good sign but honestly it's not the first time where the reviews have been misleading. but this place take the cake.

Burger boy has that homestyle, comfort food feel to it. Honesly it wasnt that great of burger.

Meat was bland, no seasoning, no juicy, no nothing, even topping were non exisient. Only good thing they had going for them was price. Thou I question their food preparation method, I didn't see anyone wash their hands or use gloves 

If I want cheap, decent burger. I'll go else where, it's wasnt worth the trip or time."}
{"text":"Burger Boy Restaurant
In Etobicoke, a few minutes drive to Burger Boy Restaurant where time slows down amidst nicety with regulars and strangers alike. The cooks are courteous and friendly.
 
After picking up my wife from work we ended up there for her favourite dish. Customers sipping their beers, keeping in touch texting on their cell phone all the while observing those who enter through the doors. There's a humdrum of quiet chatter with sizzling of fries in the background.
 
The aroma of greasy burgers and fries in the air brings some sort of comfort to a fine ending on a cold day."}
{"text":"NASTY Place they never wash their hands. Handling raw fries with bare hands, using he same tongs to handle beef and pork products"}
{"text":"Local dives can be the best way to enjoy a meal and a cold one. When you walk into burger boy their is now corporate formality to how they greet you, but just and honest hello. These are neighborhood folks and they treat you as such. The menu ranges how you would expect: slouvaki, burgers, steak, etc. pretty much whatever they can throw on a grill. Fries are always really great here. Over the years they unfortunately got rid of the back room pool table in favor of more seating and added a big flat screen to the room. I really enjoyed my steak on a bun and my friend enjoyed her veggie burger."}
