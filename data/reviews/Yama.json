{"text":"We had dinner at Yama last night. Because this location is new and that we didn't have reservations it was a fairly long wait. However, they made up for it in the food and service. I've never seen a more attentive staff all working together to give you a great experience. Our server was Jennifer and she was great. The food was excellent. All high quality Asian food without breaking the bank. I had the Udon noodles with shrimp while hubby and daughter had the teriyaki steak. We loved the atmosphere. Great place for drinks too. Will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"We visited at 9:15pm on a Tuesday during the soft opening. It was a quiet night and we were seated and served promptly. Brandon had excellent recommendations for both drinks and sushi. Our rolls were extraordinary, and we would venture to say they might be our current favorite in Charlotte. We ordered the Snow, Niigata (sp?), and Ballantyne rolls. We had a hard time determining which was our top choice of the three, and we would absolutely order all three again. It's very obvious their ingredients are fresh and quality driven. Along with the amazing sushi, the atmosphere is cozy and chic.   We will absolutely be back!"}
{"text":"Best sushi in South Charlotte. Upscale atmosphere without feeling stuffy, indoor/outdoor seating along with a bar and sushi bar. We needed a place like this in Waverly-don't you guys agree?"}
{"text":"This is gonna be my go-to sushi in the South Charlotte area. The service is absolutely amazing & the environment is relaxing and friendly. Everyone is super attentive. I got the chance to try a little bit of everything but here are some of my favorites: Crunchy roll (shrimp tempura w/ crab layer on top) & Morrison roll (shrimp tempura w/ seared filet on top), Teriyaki Chicken (chicken is cooked almost crispy and it's absolutely perfect) w/ fried rice, and their Brussels sprouts, which are to die for! Even if you don't like Brussels sprouts, I recommend them. Absolutely delicious! I'll be back again to try some new dishes for sure."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in for lunch on Saturday and we had a very nice meal.  Everything was fresh and there waverly roll was fantastic.  My wife had miso soup and she said it was one of the best she ever had.  We will definitely return."}
{"text":"Yama waverly always the best ! Their sushi/sashimi & special fish making them at a different level than others"}
{"text":"I have been here a couple of times but never sat at the bar. Our bartender was not attentive and was almost rude when answering a question we had. Some of our food came on time and some I had to get to go. Only then did the bartender show any concern for the delay. I know it was not her fault (I'm assuming slow kitchen), but the others were done with dinner before I finally asked for it to go. She did offer to comp that entree but we paid anyway. I mean I did get the food. Although, it was not great leftover. Oh well. $100 lesson learned."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed Yama. The food was very good and the atmosphere was fun. The bar is also fully stocked so you can get fun cocktails."}
{"text":"Sushi was just ok and very overpriced for the quality. Service was slow and poor. Their other location is better. Trying too hard to be a trendy restaurant and fail to get the basics right. Co around the corner, Asian fusion, is a better option.  PS - note the 5 star ratings are all spiked from a \"soft opening\" likely for friends and family."}
{"text":"The fish was very fresh, however the rolls that we ordered were literally about an inch in diameter, with a sliver of fish inside. At $12 and $14 a piece, I expected a bit more. That in itself will prevent me from coming back."}
{"text":"Waitress service was good. Hostess service was terrible. Went there and asked for a different table was not accommodated and the hostess said this table was it. We are so busy on weekends. Btw, there are other tables open.  Five minutes later, a different hostess said they have a different table. Everything is about message delivery. You don't say this table was our only option. If you are in the service business you need to be at least make it sound like you are trying to work with you and accommodate.  Will not go back. There are other Japanese restaurants better than this."}
{"text":"Two stars for service. It took them at least 3 minutes to acknowledge me at the hostess stand. When they finally sat me I was never greeted. I left after 7 minutes.  It seems that a new restaurant would really be trying to impress. But not these folks."}
{"text":"Ate there twice...first time sushi was very good, seaweed salad portion very very small.  Yesterday ate Teriyaki salmon, portion was ridiculously small less than 2 oz of fish including skin for $16.  Normal restaurant portions anywhere else are minimum 4-6 oz. cooked food just ok. Service could be much improved."}
{"text":"This place is ok. Ambience is very nice and upscale. Stopped for lunch today, ordered sushi. Disappointed on how tiny the sushi sizes were. You have to order at least 2-3 for a normal adult to feel pretty satisfied.  I think there are better sushi places to go to if you are hungry."}
{"text":"Congratulations a fusion restaurant that gets it.  Sushi (it has a side of pickled ginger- yum!)is a work of tasty art.  Generous portions priced right even for South Charlotte.  Treat yourself to a bowl of onion soup.  Very busy make sure you make a reservation."}
{"text":"Finally a great Japanese restaurant in the area!!  The atmosphere was great, good service and delicious food.  I got the tempura bento box for lunch and couldn't finish it all.  The miso soup had these yummy mushrooms in it.  My DH did a chicken rice dish and enjoyed it too.  We will be back!!"}
{"text":"So excited that the Yama Waverly finally opened.   The only take thing I could think to complain about is the parking. It is not great but once inside you'll quickly forget that as you indulge yourself in their delicious food.  I tried the Miso Soul and crunchy roll both were delicious. The miso soup had sea weed, tofu, mushrooms and onions . It was so good and the crunchy roll featured shrimp tempura and crab, both made this roll so delicious.  It is everything I knew it would be.  Be warned. I will no doubt be \"checking in \" here a lot .   Love Yama . Two thumbs way up"}
{"text":"Yet another amazing, art filled delicious meal at Yama......The staff is great, the music is perfect and the attention to detail is second to none."}
{"text":"The sushi was amazing. I asked for salmon belly which I didn't see on the menu (so I don't know if it on there but they sure did cut me a great couple of pieces) yes the parking is bad but it's a huge parking with like 8 other restaurants, so expect a crowd. The wait wasn't bad but I went crazy early (like K&W cafeteria early). We got a sushi for 2 platter and everything was fresh and presentation was on point."}
{"text":"Our sushi was SUPER fresh - like melt in your mouth fresh. We really enjoyed date night here a few weeks ago sans baby!  It was casual enough to bring baby along if we need to - highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Sushi was good but not the best we've had in the area. Especially considering the price point.  We sat at the sushi bar and honestly staring at the fish cut up in takeout trays with saturated paper towels on the bottom was a little unappetizing. It looked like a mess. My biggest complaint was the noise. Felt more like a crowded bar than a nice restaurant."}
{"text":"It's a bit over prized but the food and service are Amazing I've been there 3 times and I love it"}
{"text":"Must come place.  Great atmosphere, friendly staff. Fresh sashimi. One of my favorite japanese restaurant?"}
{"text":"YAMA has become our favorite spot in Charlotte.  I have never written a review before, but they are worth it.  The wait staff are friendly and service is as good the food.  I go fairly often and have had all of their wait staff at one time or another.  They almost always come by and greet us whether we are their table or not.  The chefs are just as attentive.       The sashimi is always fresh and has no fishy smell or taste.  They are sure to let you know if they have any specials.  Try the fatty tuna.  It will melt in your mouth.  Be sure to ask for recommendations.  They have a large selection of sashimi and quite a few that others may not.       Give them a shot and you will not be disappointed.  Your service will be spectacular, the food fresh and well prepared.  You will want reservations on Friday and Saturday nights."}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant. I tried their famous Waverly roll with their fried rice and tempura shrimp appetizer and I was very delighted. I was full for the rest of the night and the taste was amazing. The service was outstanding, the owner even took the time to explain the menu for me and recommended the best things I should order. Cant wait to come back for a second round."}
{"text":"This is the story of the best sushi I've ever had. Firstly, what a beautiful restaurant. We were seated at the sushi bar at our request.. to oogle the amazing visions of fish. There we could see everything coming out- each more beautiful than the next! We saw the avacado piled with tuna and had to try it. That is when we realized, the tuna and avacado had the same texture. We went for a full plate of sashimi.. this is how to do it. I've never had better fish in all my travels. It all the most beautiful consistency, like butter. I can only hope to go back as soon as possible. Who wants to join me???"}
{"text":"This is a beautiful restaurant. Had lunch there today and the sushi was extremely fresh. Some tables around us ordered their lunchtime bento box which looked yummy. The wait staff was terrific. I will go back again for lunch and dinner"}
{"text":"Tonight was their soft opening ... They over achieved with the service and quality of food... The atmosphere was fun and trendy it is a fun place to eat.  A little noisy."}
{"text":"We opted for Yama on a Friday night at 6pm!  There was no seating available except at the sushi bar. Was great! We watched the sushi being prepared. We ordered the crunchy roll, the Morrison roll, spider roll, and the Ballantine roll.  All were so delicious and we topped it all off with a Sapporo beer.  This is now my favorite sushi place!  Got the Mochi for dessert! Awesome!"}
{"text":"Finally there is a decent sushi restaurant in this area. It's not often I find a place with amazing rolls and food that my kids can eat. We got the magic, lobster and naughty rolls and they were amazing! My kids had udon noodles and teriyaki chicken. The servers were so helpful and friendly. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Best meal and service that we have had in Waverly so far! Food was as exceptional as the service!!"}
{"text":"So excited that Yama has a location closer to home! Visited during their soft opening and love the new space! Excellent service, food tastes delicious (just like all of their other locations). We sampled a sweet, bubbly Sake called Mio that was awesome. And I honestly have tried Sake and it was always too strong. This was perfect. All of staff worked together to make us feel welcome and at home. The kids loved the chicken and salmon teriyaki dishes, so it is a great place for families. Beautiful presentation for the dishes. Great Friday night in Waverly."}
{"text":"Decided to try Yama for date night and definitely was a great choice! The restaurant was alittle packed and had a wait time of 45 mins. but they got us a table in about 20 mins. The server was awesome, he was able to recommend certain dishes and give his opinion on others. All in all we received great service and definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"We visited on a busier night and still the wait staff was excellent, we got food quickly after ordering, management was kind enough to stop by our table and make sure we were enjoying our food. Most importantly food was made perfectly and was delicious."}
{"text":"Great quality! I hang out with friends had dinner in here. We ordered different kind of sushi. All the taste are good. The service is not familiar with that, this is the only thing i think they have to approve. Overall, it's a good sushi place."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, modern, clean. Food was really good. Taste fresh.  Friendly staff. Greeted with smiles."}
{"text":"I use to go to the one in south park pretty often. So glad this location opened up just recently.  The quality is consistent like the one in south park. Since is a Restaurant, is beautiful and very open.  I love the whole restaurant is all windows basically.  Nice place to have dinner"}
{"text":"Compared to the South Park location, this space is brighter and more contemporary and frankly, much more fun.  I love the open concept and all the textures on the floor, walls, seating, etc.    The Teriyaki chicken dish that I had was a generous portion and tasty. Our server was very attentive and we liked his personality.  The only thing that was frustrating was when my dish came out about ten minutes before my lunch companion's did. This is always awkward.  Even though she said, \"ah go ahead and don't wait for me\", it still feels really weird and rude being the only one eating.  At the same time, you realize that your food is getting COLD.  It's the restaurant's job to make sure dishes are better timed and come out together.   Otherwise, a good experience."}
{"text":"OMG!!!!!  This place puts Nobu to shame.  Amazing sushi, just amazing.  Excellent service.  By far, top sushi restaurant I've ever been to in the US"}
{"text":"Found this place late at night when we were craving for sushi. Got sat immediately for a big party in the PDR, and we got the best service! SERIOUSLY!! We tried many dishes and I was surprised this place served duck! It's phenomenal! They are also doing limited rare fishes and the live uni is urching-good(sea-urchin)! Will definitely come back here!"}
{"text":"We recently went here for dinner and sat at the sushi bar. The sushi was really good and some of the best I've had in Charlotte in quite awhile. I will definitely be back in the near future!"}
{"text":"Back to one of my favs: Yama, Waverly. My friends first time.  As always, started with the cold appies: seaweed salad & James Island tuna & avocado \"salad\". Yum! He loved each, but combined it's heaven. Sweet & tart lemon drop martini livened my palate! Dinner: He had the Yaki Udon with chicken. Stirred fried udon noodles, napa cabbage, shiitake mushroom, onion, carrot & spring onion. Generous portion with good ratio of protein, ingredients were very fresh & flavorful. I had the Grilled maple leaf farm duck breast w. steamed white rice. A beautiful display, however ... I forgot to order it medium & it came well done. Which made it tough and dry. Thankfully there was some seaweed salad to moisten it up a bit. Our server, Jennifer, was peppy and accommodating. Just wish she asked how I'd like my duck prepared. But the fact she brought extra silverware & laid it on napkins not the table made huge points w.this semi-germaphobe!"}
{"text":"Ordered sushi platter for 2, great value for money. Included Chu toro. Great ambiance as well."}
{"text":"As with their family of other restaurants, this restaurant is a welcome addition to the Restaurant Scene in the Ballantyne market. Speciality rolls and food usually only found in larger cities.  Thank you for opening up close to home!"}
{"text":"Called in today Tuesday March 20th for a reservation this coming Saturday for a party of 12.  A very nice young lady said sure no problem, what time? I asked for 7:30 and she said not a problem. I then asked if they had a private room. She confirmed they do but wasn't sure it could hold 12. She put me on hold to find out. Then a very rude guy got on the line and with attitude said that room only hold 10 plus it's already taken. I said no worries we will just take a table. He then replied not at 7:30 that is prime time and we would have to move tables for your group. He asked if we could just come in on Sunday. What a jerk. He then replied well if your group would come in at 6 and could be done for prime time around 7:30 he might be able to assist our group. I will never be back and hopefully management lets him go on Sunday. Yama in Waverly- Charlotte NC"}
{"text":"We went to YAMA for the first time today for lunch and really loved it!  The atmosphere is great, the service was very nice and the food was delicious!  I had the chicken teriyaki bento box(A) with fried rice, and my husband had a sushi bento box (B).  They both came with miso soup to start, and it was so delicate and flavorful, with the teeeeniest cute mushrooms in it. Our waitress (pronounced \"Hat\") offered to refill our bowls, and I was tempted, but knew I had plenty of food coming. Both boxes had a salad with ginger dressing, and mine had two gyoza and sauce and sauteed veggies under the chicken.  The fried rice tasted a little different from any I've had - in a good way!  We look forward to going back and trying more interesting things!"}
{"text":"Ordered a couple of sushi rolls over the phone, was told that it would be 25 minutes... walked in 35 minutes later and waited 20 minutes for me food to be ready. Really? For a couple of sushi rolls? I asked for a discount because of the inconvience, they wouldn't give me one. Terrible service. I live right near this place and was planning to go a bunch because of the convinence- will not be going back."}
{"text":"My new favorite spot for sushi and delicious Japanese cuisine, fresh and tasty food I really enjoyed the Catsu Chicken, simple breaded chicken with a tasty Curry sauce to dip and white rice, the shrimp tempura was also very good. This place is new in Waverly, I will definitely go back and try more of their menu. Service was attentive and quick, expect long waits on Friday & Saturday and congested parking, Waverly Park it's crazy packed almost every day. You can order take out and the portions are pretty decent, I was informed by the hostess that they will add pick up parking spaces.   I personally think the bar attendant could be a bit more attentive, we waited for a while just to make some eye contact for an order and the bar wasn't busy at at all, we did get to order but we never made eye contact ha ha, too busy cleaning and multitasking no big deal really. Man  I want to be a bar attendant just to talk to people and have a good time  people tip well when they feel welcomed, just saying."}
{"text":"Great sushi! Very fresh. Loved the tempura items as well. Parking is an issue, but that's true for most of Waverly complex."}
{"text":"The best sushi in Sourh Charlotte!  Great prompt service. Charlie was the best!!  Kiddos!  We'll be back!  Thanks for making my birthday special!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here twice a week for lunch since they opened in December. They have so many awesome options from sushi to teriyaki dishes to bento boxes...there isn't any other high quality Asian fusion/sushi restaurant in the ballantyne area, so it's really nice to have this place open nearby. The bar and sushi bar are awesome for when I go to lunch by myself too. 10/10 recommend!"}
{"text":"Attended the soft opening (not friend or family-as stated by another yelper)  on Sat.  night and was more than pleasantly surprised by the quality of the offerings, the cleanliness and wonderful service. The food presentations here are the best in the area for sushi, sashimi, urchin, etc. The sushi was so fresh and compares to some of the best sushi places.   Yes, it is in the new busy Waverly location on Providence but the wait and parking were not bad at all. Small bar area to spend time and get a bowl of their yummy edamame to share.   Casual, trendy, and takes reservations."}
{"text":"This is a great location and the interior design is aesthetic and amazing. The floors are really nicely done and the table spacing and layout is wonderful. Add to this, some nice windows and lots of light.  We found the prices to be on the high side. Selection was modest, certainly not extensive. Portions are average, perhaps on the small side. The miso soup was so-so. The gyoza was perfect (but half-size portion).  Main course, sushi - disappointing. Fake crab and rice tasted stale. Definitely not mouth watering. I thought maybe we found \"the place\" for sushi...nope, another let-down.  Will repeat, but expect the bill to be higher to get normal dinner-size portions."}
{"text":"Seriously good spot for sushi. Would recommend the Shumi on the app menu. Really good"}
{"text":"So me and my family went to this yama at waverly place because its a brand new open and we really wanna try it and we did. We use to went to their other location at south park but we still wanna go and try at the waverly location anyway. The food was amazing as usual. I love the sea bass.The taste was beyond amazing. My family actually order of 3 orders of those, ofcourse! The bento box was a good price yet it can actually fill you up especially on the straving day from work. I love everything about their taste. They got their own difference taste but when you combine them all together, it become super delicious.! Yummm!"}
{"text":"Our family loved Yuma at south park location and always wish they could open another one close to my house. NOW IT COMES to Waverly. My family and I are so excited. We went there during the family and friend soft opening. The décor, colors, setup and ambience are all light and refreshing. They offer a full selection of Japanese delicacies at very reasonable prices. LOVE their outstanding fresh sushi here, they are the freshest sushi we could find in Charlotte. We were also ordered a beef dish (Appetizer) Kalbi it was so tender and bursting with flavor, it had us understanding why not everyone in the place was ordering sushi. The service is great from the moment of entrance to the moment of exit. Everyone is friendly. Our favorite sushi place, highly recommend YUMA to my families and friends."}
{"text":"Way to expensive. About $70 for a couple rolls and some sashimi. The quality is a hit or miss. The lobster roll is good."}
{"text":"My wife and I have a real love for sushi and have eaten it in some wonderful places.  So we know what is good and what is not.  The sushi (that I had) and sashimi that she had was quite good.  Not the best that we have ever had though.  But when the bill came and it was almost $200 for the two of us... I was shocked!  That's more than we have ever spent for Japanese food; and to top it off, I walked out still hungry!!!  We won't be going back"}
{"text":"Fantastic sushi selection.  We've been back many times.  Finally a great place that has fresh fish selections.  Very knowledgeable staff as well."}
{"text":"Overall, Yama has very mediocre food for a steep price. The sushi rolls are tiny, and the quality is just on par with any other typical sushi bar. This restaurant seems to be significantly more focused on aesthetics and ambience than the actual food. Service is also painfully slow - I received my meal a full 15 minutes before my friend received hers (and this is after waiting for nearly 30 minutes for a single sushi roll and three pieces of sashimi). The food wasn't bad, but it's not worth the price in my opinion."}
{"text":"We were here during their soft opening, and overall we did not feel the food warranted the price. We primarily ordered hot, cooked foods because we had sashimi the previous night. Items ordered: Gyoza, edamame, calamari, popcorn chicken, Brussels sprouts, miso soup, clam soup, yaki udon and snow roll. The udon was very bland and reminded me of Chinese takeout. The miso soup also bordered on bland, but would prefer that over being overly salty which many restaurants tend to do. My husband said the roll was okay and noted the sashimi we had the previous night was much fresher (clean catch's sashimi grade fish). However, my husband is pretty critical when it comes to sushi and sashimi! The calamari was cooked tempura style and it was a little too much of the fried/grease taste and too little of the calamari. Our favorites of the meal were the edamame (kids loved), Brussels sprouts and clam soup.  Service: our server was attentive, friendly and knew the menu well. The food came out quickly and was warm on arrival.  Verdict: We probably won't be back and will opt for Musashi for Japanese food."}
{"text":"Excellent food in a new development outside of Charlotte ... the sushi is top shelf and the service is wonderful - great job yama - I will be back... especially for the Morrison and magic roles!"}
{"text":"Great sushi, great drinks, and the staff was great! This will be my new place to get sushi, it was really fresh! I also loved the ambience and the decor. I am so glad I decided to try an different sushi place!"}
{"text":"Excellent service.   Specialty roll options were varied but not too overwhelming you can't decide.   We tried a Naughty Akami and Morrison rolls.  Both were excellent.  Akami has a little bit of spice and was my favorite.  The Morrison I always like the mix of filet and was my friends favorite.   Service was excellent and menu described well. The rolls were on the small side however.  Noticeably smaller than most sushi restaurants.  Great addition to neighborhood."}
{"text":"This place is our local go to for Asian food. My husband loves the sushi.  Nice for a date night.  It's not a huge restaurant but had a cute bar area and seating area.  Our food is always cooked to perfection and presented well. Thank you Yama!"}
{"text":"Just finished dinner there and I'm very impressed with this new place ! The decorations inside are very contemporary and well designed. Super busy tonight when we got there due to their new opening and i guess also cause it's weekend! We started with tempura vegetables, calamari and shumai and an eel hand roll! they are all super yummy ! For entree we had teriyaki salmon and chicken Yaki udon! The food all nicely plated and prepared ! Even they are really busy but food still come out in reasonable time ! Our server is Brandon he is super accommodating and nice! We finish with an ice cream sandwich dessert ! Will definitely recommend to friends and family to come try this nice new place !"}
{"text":"This is the Best Sushi in town if not anywhere.  Q runs a great place.  Awesome sushi 5 star service in a cool hip atmosphere.  Great outdoor seating area and great place to chill, have a drink relax with great food. Favorite place to eat and hang out with friends or family."}
{"text":"Great restaurant in Waverly! Amazing service, food is awesome! We had he salmon teriyaki, the snow roll, and the grilled duck. Everything was outstanding! Overall atmosphere is great. Would highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"We frequent Yama and love the fresh offerings along with the wonderful staff!   We usually start with a ginger salad, miso soup or Brussel sprouts.  Sashimi selections are always super fresh and interesting.  Especially if you let them know your palate preferences and allow them to be creative.  We like The Waverly,  the Morrison,  the Ballantyne rolls- we've tried them all!  You can also ask them to fix a few specialty rolls that are not on the menu.   Enjoy!"}
