{"text":"Great, friendly, quick service.... The Red , yellow and green curries are great  creamy and has a nice flavour 

Red - personal favorite we get this all the time. 

Green - little spicier so not recommended for those who do not like spice 

Yellow - good .. not spicy"}
{"text":"I think this is probably my favorite Thai place.  
Their pad thai is great, their mango salad gets a big thumbs up, as does the cashew chicken, and their fresh rolls.  So so good.
i just wish their delivering zone was larger"}
{"text":"I really love Thai Princess, it is hands down the best delivery thai food in the city, and I have tried quite a few places. 

Recommend the Green Curry chicken, Spicy Coconut Curry beef, and the classic pad thai. Vegetable spring rolls are delicious too (better than the Princess spring rolls).

Prices are fair, delivery is always on time. Unfortunately I've recently moved out of their delivery zone but I'll still be getting take out when I'm at work just up Spadina.

Only reason they don't get full 5 stars is perhaps could be a bit more veggies in the curry dishes (I like some bok choy or carrots in my curries). Otherwise it's a delicious, filling meal every time. 

One last thing, I have eaten in the restaurant as well and it's much nicer than it seems from the outside. Noise level isn't bad and the service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Really great appetizers--the chicken coconut soup is really great here."}
{"text":"The food was okay, but doesn't make up for the not very nice and rushed service. 

We were there for dinner last night, the place is small but not busy.  We were not even there an hour and the servers were constantly trying to clear our table before we even finished our food.  Each time we had to tell them we were still eating.  They finally presented our bill without us even having a chance to look at the dessert menu.  What an unpleasant atmosphere being forced out of the place and can't even enjoy the meal.  

It looks like a nice dining restaurant but really they are a dine and dash place.  Will not be going back."}
{"text":"Great restaurant, good food, good service.  Often go there during the lunch hour and I really like the lunch specials.  Have tried several of them over many years and continue to enjoy their food. My Favourites:
Red curry 
Green Curry
Beef/ Chicken Chilly
Green Curry seafood
Basil chicken/ beef
Red chilly beef/ chicken
Basil Tofu"}
{"text":"I walked into the restaurant at 930 pm on Saturday and was greeted my a man at the front who told us they were closing and could only offer take out. I then asked \"oh I thought you were opened till 11pm like your sign said\" to which he shook his head and said no and offered no explanatio so I decided to take my business elsewhere. this is no way to run a business."}
{"text":"Lengthy menu like most Asian restaurants, but of the 10 dishes I've tried so far, I have yet to find one I haven't liked. Their Pad Thai is tasty, and their curries are well made. I love that they have steamed brown rice and I'm especially fond of their minced pork dish. Definitely check this place out, as their prices are also reasonable."}
{"text":"I've been eating here for years. I love the curry pad Thai - it's flavourful with a little bit of a bite without the greasy feel that other places tend to have. The green curry is tasty - creamy without it being too oily. Beef salad is a good option if you're looking for a light, low carb dish. Soups are ok, but I've had better soup at other restaurants. The service is good and I feel like they really care about the quality of their food."}
{"text":"Looking for food that's good come here. Prices are low and good size servings. Staff are attentive. Restrooms are clean."}
{"text":"This place is deceiving...in the good way.  From the outside, walking or driving along King W, it looks like a cheap takeout joint.  But inside is a quite warm and classy sitdown restaurant (though they do takeout as well) with an extensive menu.  Every time I eat here I try something new and find three other things I just HAVE to try next time...all have been delicious and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I love love their princess chicken dish. The curry here is perfect and their takeout is always super fast. It's my go to spot when I have a Thai curry craving."}
{"text":"What a gem! Had delicious basil chicken with coconut rice. Service was very friendly, courteous and fast."}
{"text":"My coworker recommended this Thai restaurant for lunch and spoke highly of it so was excited to try this place out. We had reservations for noon which was a clever idea as this place gets packed at lunch hour. 

There were a number of lunch specials to choose from, all ranging from $8 - $12. I wanted a bit of everything and ordered Choice A (2 chicken spring rolls, 1 Chicken Satay, mixed green salad, and steamed vermicelli.)- $8. At first, I wasn't sure if that was going to be enough food as it didn't sound like a lot of food, but it turned out just to be the perfect amount. 

The food did take a little bit of time to arrive as all dishes arrived at once, but it was definitely worth the wait. The service was great as well as our server constantly filled our waters and didn't rush us for the bill.

Definitely did not disappoint and will be back again."}
{"text":"This place looks \"meh\" from the outside but it's deceiving because the interior is quite done up lol. The food is not expensive and it's really tasty. They don't deliver that I know of, but I've called ahead and have had them make me food to be ready for pick-up before. They also have Singha beer! Their desserts are really great too."}
{"text":"Well, there was no way I was going to wait outside in the cold for 30 minutes for a 2-person table at Khao San on a late Thursday evening, so this place was the backup option. 

And I must say, I was very happy with it! We were seated immediately, had a very attentive waiter who refilled our water and took our orders/brought our orders promptly. I had the shrimp paid thai and my friend had the chicken pad thai. We both liked them a lot. Mine had 5 or 6 big pieces of shrimp -- so good! It was very filling, but we both ended up cleaning our plates. 

Would come back here again if I was in the area :)"}
{"text":"Thai princess was very good.  I'm a fan of thai food to begin with, specifically red/green curry.  I stopped by this place because it was close to my hotel while being in town for business.  Very good, fresh food.  The cold spring rolls were refreshing and excellent!  I would recommend this place if you are looking for reasonably priced food that is fresh and nicely prepared."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner to celebrate my mom's birthday, it was a beautiful day and the patio was comfortable. The cold spring rolls were delicious, we both had the pad thai with shrimp and chicken which was great. The portions were generous for a decent price. We got the mango sticky rice for desert, and since my mom made a note that it was her birthday, it came out with a candle and everyone sang to her. 

The service was quick and pleasant, all the servers were very friendly. I will definitely be coming back when I'm craving thai food!"}
{"text":"Four of us came here for lunch on a Monday.  It was busy, but we were able to be seated right away (1PM).
The lunch menu is mostly $11.  I had the beef green curry, which came with steam rice, spring roll and a little bit of plain green salad.
It was tasty.
Service is very basic.
I would come here again for lunch if I was in the area."}
{"text":"one of the best thai rice, you can either pack or eat in. they dont disappoint you..."}
{"text":"Thai Princess is a great option for Thai food in the downtown area. This spot offers affordable lunch specials that are in big portions - average cost is approximately $10 for a lunch dish. 

Every time I come back to Toronto, I find myself stopping here by myself for lunch on a Friday. I must say, it gets completely packed very quickly during the lunch rush (12pm-2pm). The best time to go is after 2pm to ensure you get a spot and less time spent waiting for your food to come out. 

The service is always friendly and great. Always making sure you are enjoying your meal and re-filling your water. The only issue that made me take a star away is the feeling that they want to get you out of there AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. Every time that I've gone there (busy or not), they would put the bill on my table right after I take my first bite. Not a big bothersome for me, but still not the most pleasant feeling of being rushed. 

Overall, great location (easy TTC access), great service, and absolutely amazing food."}
{"text":"I come here ALOT for lunch. My \"go-to\" place.
Usually I will call ahead for pick up all the time (usually 10-15minutes)

Like all the good places in the area it's packed for lunch.
My favorites are the pad thai and peanut chicken.
Friendly service, great food and HUGE portions."}
{"text":"Great food, great location, and decently price. I have been going here with my coworker and girlfriend for the last few years. There authentic pad thai is one of the best I had in Toronto. The food taste fresh and I would recommend most people to come."}
{"text":"I've only ever been at lunch and it's always packed. While there's nothing overly great about the ambiance, the food is consistently delicious & affordable. Definitely a good option if you're looking for a lunch spot in the area but expect to wait a bit for a party bigger than 2."}
{"text":"Good service and food tasted fresh. Red curry veggie dish good but very spicy. Pad Thai good but not the best; almost too sweet. Tofu/broccoli stir fry good (kids liked) but also not super flavorful. Went here because of yelp reviews and happy we did but we can get better Thai food at home (California)."}
{"text":"I come here sometimes with family before a night at the symphony. I know, I am one classy dame. As for the food: there are incredibly yummy morsels to be found here. The chicken skewers with peanut sauce are great. My favorite thing is the red curry with rice! It is fabulous. It is a good looking place with nice tablescapes. And the servers are present but not in yo face. Yay!"}
{"text":"Although I have taken people here, I do have to say that I've experienced better.

food taste: 6/10
environment: 8/10
service: 4/10
portion size: 5/10
price: $10-$20

The part that really kills it for me is that kao san road is just down the street."}
{"text":"I love this little place - from the outside it looks sketchy, but once you're in, the atmosphere is warm, the food is well priced and tasty. We often went for business lunch because the service in generally quick. I love the curry."}
{"text":"I stopped in on a walkby as I had a hankering for some panang beef and a bowl of rice. It was 9pm on a thursday night. It was very tasty though the beef was a little tough. The service was good. Only 6 other diners though. I felt the portion was a little small... no leftovers"}
{"text":"Conveniently located on the SE corner of Spadina and King, I'm happy to  declare Thai Princess as my new favourite Thai restaurant.  

Decor: Simple and classy, tables nicely spaced apart, definitely a date-worthy place.

Food: Delicious with lots of flavour.
Thus far I've tried: chicken wings (yum), chicken coconut soup (yum), Thai spring rolls (yum), sweet and sour shrimp (yum), thai hot & sour soup (so-so), green curry chicken (yum), stir fried glass noodle (yum). I especially like the Spicy Thai Princess curry.

But, you must save room for the best part: the mango sticky rice - the mango is sweet and fresh, and the sticky rice is coated with coconut milk, but not heavy or overly sweet.  

Price: Very good value for the price. 

Service: Average.

Can't wait to return and sample other dishes on their extensive menu."}
{"text":"Highly recommended authentic Thai cuisine. The servers are friendly and the pad thai is delicious! This hidden gem has been our go-to."}
{"text":"I've ate at most of the Thai places in downtown Toronto (and been to Thailand myself), and this place is pretty good overall.   The Green Curry here is one of the better dishes but prices are a bit higher than average (Lunch for 2 was $40) but its King West, so expect to pay more for this area.  Great atmosphere and the white table clothes makes it feel a little more upscale."}
{"text":"Went for lunch. Had the green curry shrimp and was great. I was reluctant to order shrimp because restaurants usually give you 2 or 3 small tasteless shrimps, but this one had 5 huge tasty ones. Curry was really good and rice was cooked to the right point. Portion could have been a little bigger and service a little faster, but not enough to downgrade it to 4*."}
{"text":"Went in for a quick bite to eat, and had a very tasty dinner of spring rolls and green curry shrimp. The curry itself was very well done; spicy, rich and a hint of sweetness somehow that I couldn't figure out, that balanced things nicely. Service was very fast and friendly. Only concern was that the rice that came with the curry was in a pretty bowl separate to the rest of the (also pretty) dish, making it very hard to mix the two without making a mess all over the place. I'll go again but maybe I'll ask for larger plates next time!"}
{"text":"I know Thai fairly well.  I've spent a while in Thailand and cook Thai a few nights a week.  This is not Thai food.  It's not fresh, not all that flavourful, and just not worthwhile.  The worst was the cashew chicken which was deep fried and tastes like generic ginger beef or something you get when you sugar dip breaded deep fried meat.  I can't say to food was shockingly bad, but it lacks any of what makes Thai food so wonderful.  You could make a better Panang curry with a store bought sauce."}
{"text":"Overall a very good Thai resto! They offer all your standard Thai plates (curries, pad Thai, etc.) and prepare them quite quickly (only waited 15min). The staff is very friendly and helpful. The decor inside is nice but nothing special; it's a little old fashioned."}
{"text":"My fav thai restaurant in toronto! 
I love the phad thai, phad sew, curry phad thai, pineapple fried rice, and curry dishes. 

Food is always mad fresh and service is fantastic. 
I usually go here 1 a week. 

would definitely recommend this!"}
{"text":"Until recently Thai Princess was one of my regular spots where I'd try to eat at least 3-4 times per month. being a resident of Richmond Hill, and not working anywhere near downtown, i would say that's quite a display of loyalty and favouritism . 

a few weeks ago my friend and I came in for our regular doze of #97. Dinner was served in tolerable 20 mins but as soon as we began to eat, my friend found a long black hair in her soup. we alerted the waiter and as she waited for her replacement i couldn't help but nibble on mine. some 25 mins pass by and my companion gets her new hair free dish, which she seems sceptical of. by this time i can see the bottom of my bowl. needless to say it was a bit of an awkward experience eating one at a time. as i waited for my friend to finish her meal i wondered if there are other restaurants in Toronto that prepare this dish so well.

we asked for the bill and when presented with it we saw no consideration what so ever. when argued that the whole dynamic of the meal was ruined since we weren't able to actually eat together and should at least get her meal taken off the bill (just for the record we didn't come for free soup, we visit this place on a regular basis and always leave a min 20% tip. not to mention that most establishments will deduct the \"bad\" dish of your bill without even asking) we were told that our meal was replaced free of charged and we are not owed any considerational compensation. 

the soup is to die for, but i will never give my business to this establishment again. 
now the search for the next best spicy coconut red curry lobster ball and chicken soup (or #97 for short) continues.

as a side note, the service has never been the greatest. it's not that it was bad, the staff just seemed like they couldn't be less enthused to see you."}
{"text":"Great place for a quick bite. I had the pad thai, it was very good and came out fast. Excellent prices and friendly staff."}
{"text":"I don't know why they think sugar should be the number one ingredient but it's like eating horrible candy. We ordered chicken cashew,which had 2 nuts by the way. And it has at least 3 tbsp of sugar. Tom Yum soup which has too much sugar and some liquorice ingredient like fennel or fenugreek which it should never have. No happy."}
{"text":"This restaurant is one of my favourite Thai places! My experience at this restaurant is always amazing. The staff are knowledgeable about their menu and can guide you to make that decision between dishes. It's my second time being here and I have nothing but good things to say. 
In regards to the food, it's just delicious. I would have to say that it's nothing in comparable to Salad King. My friends and I ordered the Pad Thai - one with chicken and two orders with shrimp. We all loved our dishes. It's one of those places where you want to continue eating more and more but you're so full. It's definitely worth the price! 
If you're hungry and around the area, definitely check it out. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"We decided to give Thai Princess a try after having walked past it so many times before. We went during one of the busy TIFF nights but we were able to get seated right away (thankfully, we were pretty hungry)! I ordered the green curry with chicken with a side of white rice - their curries do not come with rice so you will have to order that separately. The curry was decent but a little on the watery side. There are definitely better options in the area if you're craving green curry and willing to wait longer for a table (Pai, Khao San Road). My fiancé got this fried rice dish with chicken that tasted good but we probably wouldn't come back just for it."}
{"text":"Ok food, conveniently close and delivers in a timely fashion."}
{"text":"Decent food, but the portions are not big and the price is rather high for the quality in my opinion. The environment is pretty nice for a date or meal with friends."}
{"text":"On a night out to Second City, I decided I'd give Thai a second round, after being a pretty big fan the first time. I'd heard great things about Khao San Road in the area, but I'd also heard about long wait times, so I decided against it, and went with another Thai place right around the corner, Thai Princess.

Other reviews describe it as very deceiving on the outside. This couldn't be more true. My girlfriend give me the \"Gwah?\" look when she saw the very drab sign, as it really does seem like it's strictly a take-out joint. She was also a little wary, as she'd never sampled Thai cuisine before. After a quick peek at the menu on the door, we went forward, to find no wait time whatsoever. Score!

Inside, it's gorgeous. Fairly small, but very intimate. It's one of those places that even if the food sucks, you're happy you went just based on how relaxing of an atmosphere it had...before you bitch about the shitty food of course. 

Our waitress was very kind and helpful with us, a newcomer and someone still pretty green as well. My girl ordered some kind of curry thing (I can't remember what it was exactly), and I couldn't help myself after my last Thai experience, and ordered another pad thai with chicken. Also like last time, I had it in mind to also get the mango and coconut sticky rice again.

After ordering, I went to go wash my hands in the washroom. One thing worth noting is that you should be very careful when you open the door to go downstairs, there's no landing. You open the door and you're already on the steps, and the design is ridiculous enough that it would be incredibly easy to do a swan dive if you're not paying attention. It should also be noted that the waitress was very quick to point this out upon our arrival, so if we still fell, we'd have no one to blame but ourselves, right?
The bathroom area was hilarious. It was very clearly constructed by an...ahem...little person? I felt like I was walking through one of those little houses you buy for children, hunched over like Mr. Burns. Once in the mens room, I got a wonderful view of my boobies when looking in the mirror, and had to (omg...) squat slightly to use the urinal. Hilarious, and yet immaculate in there.

Anyway, the food was delivered very quickly, and the pad thai was just as delicious as I remembered from the other place. My girl had issues with the spicyness of her meal, but I suspect that was just something she wasn't used to, and not a problem with how they prepared it. She did say it was very tasty though. Unfortunately, I could barely finish my very filling pad thai, and therefore skipped the dessert.

Wonderful restaurant, great prices, friendly staff, comical bathroom. I wanted to 5-star this place, but for one flaw: We were seated near the back of the place, and unfortunately, that's where everyone getting take out walks through, so we were treated to douchey hipsters talking about dumb crap really loudly while they were waiting for their food. Not really TP's fault, but I just wish the order-pick-up section was farther away from where people are trying to have an enjoyable dinner date."}
{"text":"Pretty good pad see ew. kinda expensive for lunch takeout though- $12 (with tax)
Not a go-to place more than 1x a week"}
{"text":"Finally after so many years of wondering what's behind the doors of this restaurant I went here for a dinner. 

The place looks cheap on the outside (which totally doesn't fit into the King street hi end restaurants atmosphere) but wait for the moment you step inside. Inside it's a good looking restaurant with white table sheets and all that=) 

the dinner prices are ok. but the portions for a thai restaurant are tiny. we had to go for desserts to fill us up. the desserts are delicious though (deep fried banana and mango sticky rice!ummm)

the waiter was very attentive and joked around with us. 

nice place overall=)"}
{"text":"Curry taste like watery jam and my dog could cook better pineapple rice. Lovely ambiance though.."}
{"text":"This is a good, dependable Thai restaurant. Not impressive, but consistent in quality and in value. Their lunch menu is definitely their best value. Definitely a good option if you're looking for Thai food in the Wellington Place / Fashion District area.

Had their Chicken Red Curry and it was good, pretty mild on spice but you knew it was there. Came with a spring roll, some salad and rice. All for under $12. Pretty good value and very fast in regard to service. Always good service, could almost make this a 4-star rating."}
{"text":"My friend loves the Thai Princess, so we were meeting there for dinner. Walking up to the restaurant I was thinking, this looks a little sketchy but do not be deceived!

I had the hot squid salad and cold spring rolls. The spring rolls and and chilli sip were really good, lovely and fresh. The salad, crisp, tasty but unfortunately not hot enough for my liking, some like it hot - I like it hotter!

The restaurant was very quite, also they do Gluten Free Pad Thai!! Which one of my friends had and said was pretty tasty. My other friend had thai green curry which is her Thai Princess staple. 

Food was hot and served quickly, I will definitely try there again...I didn't spot the GF Pad Thai until after I had ordered...I need to try this!"}
{"text":"Great place for a decent lunch for a reasonable price. They have lunch specials. I tried the basil chicken which had a bit of a kick!  It came with a serving of rice, a spring roll (piping hot and good) and a side salad (just some spring mix with no dressing) - all for $10."}
{"text":"I went here on a friend recommendation, and my honest opinion of this place is that it's an average Thai restuarant. The food stood out as neither bad, or amazing. It was simply decent. Note that the basic pad thai might be a little on the sweet side compared to other that places, but depending on you mood that can be a good thing.

Prices seems fairly reasonable too. About $8-10 depending on what kind of pad thai you get. You can probably use that as a base from which to judge the rest of the menu pricing."}
{"text":"One of my fav places to grab take out. The price is competitive. The wings are absolutely awesome! The service is good here. Take out staff are friendly. I've eaten in once and it was also great. I've had consistently good food here."}
{"text":"Great pad Thai here. The servings are VERY generous and I would recommend splitting an order between two people. Spring rolls are also very tasty. I think as far as Thai food goes, this place is a little pricier than the average restaurant - but the quality is great! I find Thai food can be pretty hit or miss but this place is consistently tasty. 

Also, the place gets really busy during the work week at lunch - so get there early or order out!"}
{"text":"Tried the lemongrass chicken lunch special and it was underwhelming. Although the portion was substantial, the dish lacked flavour."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night for dinner. The place was busy but still the staff was great. Very aware of every time we needed water and overall just great service. 

Ordered the green curry and it was a little more expensive than usual. The small bowl of rice to accompany it cost an extra $2 which was a little pricey, as rice usually comes included. 

Also ordered the mango shake which was amazing. Well worth the value of $4 and came in a huge fish bowl cup. 

Overall great experience and would definitely return."}
{"text":"I was there once with my co-workers during lunch time. It was super busy but we got a place after little waiting for our group of five. Nice interior, ok price for the quantity and quality of food! 

I had ordered Crab Fried Rice. I had specifically asked to make it spicy but  it was not spicy at all, though the server apparently took a note of it, and the taste was just flat. The service was just ok, the server never asked if we would like to drink something. The final vote - two 5 stars and three 3 stars from our group of five. ."}
{"text":"So I finally tried Thai Princess ...
All I have to say is WoW !!!
Amazing service and the food ...WoW the food !!
So tasty I'm kinda speechless to be honest .
One of the best curry chickens in the city for sure 
I do have my favourite place for curry but this place is definitely a runner up .
Also tried the calamari and it was amazing aswell ! 
If your on king street give this place a try ! 
Fair prices for downtown and Great Food !"}
{"text":"We stopped in for dinner here a few weeks ago, mostly because there was traffic everywhere, and we were getting impatient.  
Anyways, it was tasty.  I had the pad-sew-ee, which was pretty big portion wise.  I was happy to share.  My hubby ordered peanut chicken or something, which seemed like a peanut flavoured curry concoction.  Also quite tasty.  We had the veggie spring rolls to start.  I loved those, because they were super duper crispy.
I would come back here.  Yum."}
{"text":"This place was close to my hotel and we were starving and wanted Thai, so Thai Princess was an obvious choice.  Luckily, it was a good choice, too.

My Pad Thai was great, and had tons of vegetables in it...which I was uneasy about at first, but ended up loving by the end.  The service was great and the outdoor seating was nice.  We got to watch tons of people heading out for nights on the town and make fun of the name of the \"Charlie\" building going up across the street.  Good times."}
{"text":"Their coconut soup with chicken is EXCELLENT (quite red).

Sometimes I get a huge vacuum in my stomach that only their coconut soup can fill.

Staff are pleasant and food is very good with some excellent dishes."}
{"text":"The sign outside the joint looks like it's about 25 years old, but the inside of the place is nicely appointed and the food is good. people are right when describing this place as 'middle of the road'. I don't know the term for it, but the food here tastes great, but looks pretty average. is there a term for that?

I've had about half the Pad Thai's on the menu here, and all are good. Favorites are the curry Pad Thai and the regular chicken Pad Thai. Both good. Not too sweet or saucy. Decent portions. Spring rolls are tasty and arrive in 4's, a nice touch. Not overly greasy. Also tried what their version of Pad Sew is, and it was also good. sauce is not as dark in color as most other places I've had Pad Sew so I wasn't sure if I'd ordered the right thing, but regardless of the reason why, it was good.

Service here is also good. The restaurant is located off the beaten path as far as Asian restaurants go, being on King St., so perhaps servicing a slightly more demanding clientele has made this place stay sharp. Servers are attentive, but don't bother you. Just the way it's supposed to be.

Being on King St., the prices are a bit higher but in line with what Thai typically goes for and fair for the quality of the food you're getting.

I still prefer Suko Thai, and have heard better things about Kao San Rd., but this is a good place to stop in for some good food if you're craving Thai and don't want to travel too far.

Worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Probably one of the better Thai placed I have tried in Toronto.  But compared to all of the other Thai food I've had, this definitely falls in the middle.

Very cute and intimate place inside.  I like the wait staff here as well.  Very pleasant to be around.

As far as the food goes:
Pad thai - pretty good!  I would order it again. 
Sweet and Sour - it's good for the first few bites but after a while something tasted a little...creamy (?) about it.  Would not order again.
Vegetables - decent and tofu was meh as well.
Spring Rolls - tasty but sauce was just ok.

As a vegetarian, the tofu here is not really my favorite tofu I have had.  

Close to the SoHo house and is a pretty solid choice, but nothing super special."}
{"text":"Last time I came here, the food had really fantastic flavors, every bit as good as PAI. 

I had the pad thai and red curry last time. The pad thai was well seasoned, tart, salty and a bit sweet. Nice and saucy, really really savoury. Red curry was fragrant and came with rice.

Ambiance-wise, the interior is a bit outdated and ambiance was lacking. But I thoroughly enjoyed sitting on their outdoors patio, and would definitely return."}
{"text":"Spicy calamari and chicken dishes. It was spicy. Pretty standard for Thai food. Pretty bland decor, could use an update and wasn't a first choice but was quick and easy and didn't need a reservation or had a wait. 

Quick service and nice staff. But very average."}
{"text":"Meh. Just OK. I ordered from the lunch menu. For $12 (Basil Chicken + Rice + Salad + Springroll) it sounded like a good deal. The portions would fill up a 6 yr old child, maybe?  A tablespoon of rice, a Springroll the size of my Thumb...so in short, not happy. Won't be going back. Food itself was average at best, forgettable at worst."}
{"text":"Foodie log. This is the number 1 Thai place out of the 22 I have been to. Everything is fresh and fantastic. Basil yes! Som Tam papaya salad!!! You need to try this."}
{"text":"Great Thai restaurant decent price and the food is so delicious. I got the curry and it was the right balance of taste."}
{"text":"I've had some decent lunches here, but it holds no candle to Khao San Road.
Also one time I came and there wasn't any free tables, and they didn't even tell us \"it will be 15 minutes\". Just that they didn't have a table for us. I guess they don't like having people wait inside their doors. I would recommend one of the pad thais... their lunch specials aren't very filling, so watch out!"}
{"text":"My cousin was really craving for some thai food, and mostly the mango and sweet rice dessert that you can get here, so she dragged me out here with her. 

We ordered duck curry, crab fried rice, and the pad thai. All of these dishes were pretty good, but I've had better elsewhere. They were all fairly spicy, and I absolutely loved it! 

I'd give this place another half a star for their dessert because it was absolutely delicious! Fresh fruit, perfect amount of coconut, and the sticky rice was cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"Your average Thai restaurant. I always walked passed it but never actually went in. As me and a friend were deciding on something close by to eat that would be a \"safe\" option, we chose this one. The service was great though! My food was way too spicy and they changed it with no complaints. The price is also not bad. With so many Thai places around is hard to stand out, but I have no major complaints about this one. A good safe option."}
{"text":"I came here just before a Jay's game for Dinner.

Amazing service, so attentive.
Constantly filling our water and asking if everything's OK.

The food was well presented and the best tasting Thia I have had.
Mind you only been to a few Thia places, just getting into Thia food.
But the food was ridiculously amazing.

I had the Spicy princess chicken with a bowl of rice.
I laid the rice out on a plate and then spooned the Spicy Princess chicken over the rice and OMG.
The spice was so perfect, it gave me a nice hotness enough to back off the food and when I did back off the heat the heat went away to carry on eating. :D

For desert we had the Deep fried banana, it came with pineapple pieces and a scoop of vanilla ice cream with caramel drizzle (or wait did my girlfriend ask for the scoop?)
Can't remember, but presentation and the taste was soooo good.

And chocolate syrup across the plate, pretty fancy stuff like the melon desert in the pictures others have posted.
OHH, and we wanted the Melon desert but they said they can't server us it cause the melons were not in good shape, appreciate the honesty and not make us a desert that would have been not so good to to make a sale. :D

The seating was great, Lights dimmed a tad and the setting looks beautiful.
Great atmosphere.

Super great place, highly recommend."}
{"text":"Weak curry, their spicy is NOT spicy, weak service seems they are desperate for customers..charging extra $3 and extra $2 for coconut rice and spring rolls...soooo disappointed...they have a prime location on King West one would assume food would be prime as well...Nottttttttttt!"}
{"text":"The food tasted good, portions for take out were on the smaller side but certainly was enough for dinner."}
{"text":"Really good service. Good peanut dish for lunch. Good was a 7/10 but it's was fresh, fast and great value."}
{"text":"Pretty quiet and cozy though. Home like atmosphere. Quiet on a Friday.

Had the pad see ew, as recomended by my gf and her co-worker as the BEST ever. It was pretty good I guess but smaller portion than what I am used to. Its nice it has three types of meat I believe even though my gf is vegetarian and always gets the veggie one.

I've had my share of thai food in San Diego and even ones around here. Its pretty good but nothing to wow about in my opinion."}
{"text":"Does this place qualify as a hidden-gem?  It's kinda out of the way, and not too many people know about... 

Anyways, this place was my first experience with Thai food and I was sold ever since.  Great place, great food.  Not the nicest looking place, or area.  Not the best service in the world.  But the food quality and pricing are excellent.  And it's definitely worth a look if you like Thai food.

{"text":"I'd never had lamb in my green curry but this place got it right!  It was cooked perfectly and meshed well with the curry that was just the right blend of spicy. I also had a \"fun\" beer called Hoptical Illusion that was tasty but a little overpowering for the curry."}
{"text":"One of the first places where I discovered Thai food.  I love the Tom Yum soup and the satays.  Just so delicious.  I wish the portions were even bigger because I became addicted to the flavours.  I have been back here with friends and we have always had a pleasant experience.  Good service and good food.  I have travelled to other countries and was disappointed with the Thai food.  This restaurant was terrific and I am glad we have it in Toronto."}
{"text":"Loved everything I ate here. They're very accommodating to things you don't want ex. Mushrooms which I've found is difficult to do in many Asian restaurants. Initially, I was looking for another Thai place and found this one on the way (I think, I was lost). I will be coming back here for sure especially since  I couldn't decide what I wanted to eat. Everything sounded so tasty."}
{"text":"They were quick and the staff was nice, but I didn't like the food at all. I asked for the pineapple fried rice, that comes with chicken and shrimp. I swear, there was two shrimps in all my plate. The chicken was super white, no color, no flavor.  But the worst part was the rice, no thai flavour, only a white rice mixed with eggs. There was a lot of cashew nuts though. :("}
{"text":"A little bit past the main part of the Entertainment District, I would never have thought to come into this place because it looks a little bit run-down on the outside. To be honest, I only came here because I tried to get a table at Pai without a reservation, and was told the wait would be 20 minutes. This place was pretty full, but they had a few empty tables so I didn't have to wait to be seated. They have a lunch menu where pretty much everything is $10. I ordered the mango chicken, and it came with a little side salad and rice. Food was not bad, and I would say the value is pretty good for the amount of food you get, considering it is a sit-down restaurant. It didn't blow me away though, and to be quite honest I didn't think it was that much different from something you could just grab at a food court. Just pretty standard. No complaints about the service though, which was prompt and attentive.

I would not be opposed to coming to this place again, especially for dinner to try some of their other stuff. The pictures of their desserts look amazing! I think this place is a pretty decent alternative to Khao San Road and Pai, although it's not quite as flashy or exciting. Then again, you also won't have to wait for like hours to get in, so that is a plus."}
{"text":"My love of Thai food and close proximity to work led me to this restaurant today.

The place is nothing fancy and there were plenty of open tables when we got here at lunch. They do have lunch specials that are advertised to come with a spring roll and a salad - the spring roll was tiny (I've never seen one so small) and the\"salad\" was a few pieces of green at the edge of my plate...a salad this does not make. That was pretty disappointing. I ordered the green curry chicken, which had three small pieces of chicken in the entire bowl. The curry itself was not bad, but not the greatest.

My lunch special cost me $11.50 plus tax. For this I'd rather go to Pai and spend two bucks more and get a dish that won't disappoint. Our server was nice, so she gets a star for that. 

Meh."}
{"text":"Southern Thai tasty. Mid range prices and great quality service. Decor is comfortable and give a high class dining feel. To go place for Thai!"}
{"text":"Thai Princess is one of those restaurants I'd walked by countless times over the years and yet I had somehow never stepped inside. It's difficult to work up much interest in a clearly old-school Thai place when next-level places like Khao San Road and Pai are nearby.

And indeed, the food is exactly what you'd expect. It's fine and quite edible, but it undoubtedly pales in comparison to those two top-tier joints.

I placed an order of chicken Pad Thai (\"rice noodles stir-fried with tofu, egg, green onion, bean sprout. Served with raw bean sprouts, a wedge of lime and ground peanuts\") using the Ritual app and taking advantage of the King Street promotion. (Total cost was less than two bucks, ultimately!)

It's fine. The first thing I noticed was that it was completely lacking in spice, although the restaurant did include a small container of generic Asian hot sauce. The problem is, this sauce infuses its own flavor into the Pad Thai, which is why the spice should have been cooked into the dish. I'm not sure why spice level isn't an option when ordering.

Otherwise this is exactly the sort of run-of-the-mill Pad Thai one might expect from such an establishment. It doesn't contain any mind-blowing flavors or surprises, and it is, admittedly, quite edible in its way. But it's also no better than something you might get from a food court, and that's disappointing."}
{"text":"We found this place by chance when we were walking around the neighborhood, and we're so glad we did! The food was delicious, and the staff were very friendly and welcoming. We would definitely return to try their signature dish-- the Curry Pad Thai."}
{"text":"Ordered Thai Golden Baskets and Crispy Deep-Fried Tofu. Thai Golden Baskets was nice. I really liked it. The Crispy Deep-Fried Tofu,  I would not recommend unless you have vegetarian friend, it is just really normal, nothing special.

And Cashew Nut Chicken for entree. Yumm.. Also, was cold that day, so ordered some ginger tea. Expensive but really nice for the cold day."}
{"text":"really good and fast service! 
not too busy on a friday night, and cozy little atmosphere."}
{"text":"Surprised my boyfriend at his work by taking him out to lunch here since I let him decide. I'm so nice =P.

Thai Princess is a small restaurant that has indoor and patio dining. It was pretty busy around noon since many Toronto workers are out looking for lunch. However, we were able to get a table.

I ordered the shrimp pad thai and he got the curry chicken lunch special. Food doesn't take that long to arrive and it comes out hot and fresh. There's nothing special about the pad thai to talk about. I got to try the curry chicken...well, more of the curry then the chicken. I can't tolerate spicy foods but this wasn't super spicy so I was able to actually taste it and it was good.

Would I go here again? If he wanted to go here I would but I would try something different."}
