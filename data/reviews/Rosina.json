{"text":"Wow. Nothing short of wow. This is coming from an American who grew up with the best of the best Italian cuisine on Long Island in New York and has dined at the likes of Raos and Umbertos of New Hyde Park, buying groceries often at Iavorone Bros. 

Back to Rosina on King Street... Wow for the service and management and style of this awesome dining establishment. Even more wow for the food! I don't write reviews too often, but as an American looking for some comfort food while traveling for work in Toronto, I have never felt so welcome and close to home. From the bread and olive oil to the superb wine and beer selection to the Arancini risotto balls to the Penne Alla Calabrese, that sauce, bada bing ;) 

Plenty to choose from, truly authentic, and truly felt like family with manager Helder and server Swag. 

Will be coming back every time I get to visit this great city aka 6 !"}
{"text":"Had dinner with friends here last night. Can't say enough good things about this place. They've done a great job redecorating the interior and it's nice but not too uppity. Food is wicked good! Pizzas are amazing! The meatballs are amazing too. Staff were friendly, welcoming and helpful. Eat here. You won't regret it one bit. I like!"}
{"text":"Gord and I had supper this evening at Ristorante Rosina.  They just opened a couple months ago.  We sat at the table by the window.

I ordered a Menabrea Bionda and it was good.

Jelena was our server and she started us off with some bread.

I love love love pizza and ordered a Pepperoni Di Parma.  It was a good pizza.  The crust was thin and crispy.  It was really cheesy.  I ate half and will have the other half for lunch tomorrow.

Gord ordered Spaghetti Alla Carbona.  He said it was good and he'd get it again.

Jelena was friendly and took good care of us.  We'll be back!"}
