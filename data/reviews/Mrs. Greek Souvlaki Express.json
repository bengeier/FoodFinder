{"text":"Excellent food taste and excellent customer service. We ordered a nice lunch plate of Chicken Souvlaki. It was great."}
{"text":"Food isn't bad for takeout. Souvlaki pretty decent. Usually if you come at lunch time it can get busy, but they do a good job moving the line along."}
{"text":"Total regret. Good days of this place are officially over, because it is nothing like before. Only Oriental people work there now, and quality of food has significantly worsened since a few years ago. The complete meal take-out looks way sloppier, fatty, loaded with salt, does not have that famous light healthy Greek food quality anymore. Rice is now soaking in fat, taste of it is different. Potato is not Greek anymore, the lazy cook does not keep the original recipe, he just tosses it with Ketchup. Salad has less of olives, less pieces of tomato, less cucumber. I had to throw out almost all meat - it was all fat and too chewy, too sinewy, far from Souvlaki idea. Freshness of pita is replaced with just frying pita in lots of oil. I am disappointed and not going there anymore."}
{"text":"Needed a quick lunch and large portions.  Quick service and great hot sauce.    Thanks."}
{"text":"This is one of the best places for simple Greek food in Vaughan. The chicken is very juicy and flavourful, salad tastes fresh and the potatoes are pretty good too. A friend introduced me to this place and I became a regular after that. I've then shown it to other people and no one was disappointed. The prices are pretty good too. I highly recommend."}
