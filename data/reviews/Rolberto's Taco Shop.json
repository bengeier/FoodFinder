{"text":"Literally no competition. Rolled tacos are awesome, California burritos are to die for...with shoes string fries as the potatoes, and the breakfast burritos with eggs, bacon, and cheese (add potatoes)....are the BEST. Don't judge a book by its cover, as you will miss out. Family owned."}
{"text":"The food is always good. The California burrito is by far the best and I love their rolled tacos covered in guacamole and sour cream. The inside is always very clean. Don't let the worn out sign deter you the food is amazing and don't forget their hot sauce. They also finally accept credit cards for a 30 cent fee."}
{"text":"Best food and service ever. I live in Laveen but so worth the drive! Their carne asada fries are the best of the best. And the red salsa uffffffff to die for!!"}
{"text":"Delicious food!  Love this place!  I use the drive through.  The chimichangas are great.  I also love the deep fried beef tacos.  Fast service.  Affordable for a family of 5. Looks like a hole in the wall but the food is as good as a sit down restaurant!"}
{"text":"So, this place may look scary, but it's so delicious! I may be biased (I've been eating here for over 14 years!) but it's one of my three \"go-to\" Mexican spots. My normal dish is the four rolled taco special and I just LOVE it! Take your taquito, dip it in the beans, dip it in the rice, dunk it into your salsa of choice and, YUM. I've also had their super nachos, super fries, breakfast burritos, and horchata. All lovely and tasty, and I've never had a bad experience. Try them!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best!!! I have been going here for the past twelve years and I would guesstimate that I've eaten more than 1000 chicken burritos from this place. 
Always clean inside, the food is always fresh.  I have know people that have gotten sick (food poisoning) from other taco shops like this, but in twelve years I have never heard of anyone getting sick from Rolbertos at Cave Creek & Sweetwater."}
{"text":"Pros: good food (the best Churros, I, have tasted, OK service, mostly clean restaurant (and by clean, they are practically sloshing bleach across the floor every time I go there) and they also have a pinball machine/claw machines for when your bored while waiting a long time for your food.

Cons: the Clorox smell in the restaurant is really strong, and having a picture of the world trade centers up in a Mexican restaurant is untasteful. Although most of the food is fresh, the wait time for a small order is really long whether you are inside or through the drive thru.  They are no longer 24hrs so when you randomly get hungry at 3am like me, their extremely convenient location is crossed off the list of possible options of places to go."}
{"text":"Our GPS lead us here--quite literally--after we picked a non-chain Mexican place at random from the list of nearby sites. Thank you, fabulous little unit!  Remember that night when I was running late, and you took me to an abandoned parking lot instead of the Hartford airport?  All's forgiven.

Rolberto's was exactly what we were looking for: a cheap, filling, delicious, total hole-in-the-wall.  We ended up visiting this place twice in 3 days, both times for breakfast.  I got the egg, pico de gallo, and cheese breakfast burrito ($3.70) and hubs got the carnitas, which had him swooning in delight.  

I wish Rolberto's was in our neighborhood."}
{"text":"Smells nasty looks dirty they gave bad customer service and they do not have bathrooms Do not eat here"}
{"text":"Great, inexpensive Mexican fare. The guys that work there are always super nice. It doesn't look like much, but the good ones rarely do! They invest in quality food, not aesthetics. Drive-thru and you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"You don't want to eat here, just hit the drive thru...rockin burritos de carne asada"}
{"text":"By far the best taco shop in the valley. Their rolled tacos are delicious. I've had them dozens of time and they never disappoint. The restaurant is older and what you'd expect of a normal \"taco shop\", but it is very clean and the staff is always very friendly. They also have the best red hot sauce I've tasted yet. Yuuuuuuum."}
{"text":"Fantastic tacos. Best in Phoenix. Beef was the winner. Red sauce on point . big menue, drive thru"}
{"text":"This place has the absolute best bean and cheese burrito the mixture is amazing it is it!"}
{"text":"This may look like a little hole in the wall restaurant but this place is actually pretty decent. Every single table was wiped down clean. The place looked spotless and the lady who took my order has a great sense of humor. I enjoyed the food it tasted great especially the salsa boy did it have a kick. I'll be back again. ....gracias!!!!"}
{"text":"One of the better 'tos i have been to in the valley. Sausage burrito was great. Service very friendly. Will try again."}
{"text":"So tonight I ordered carne asada tacos I got home and I got carnitas. Whenever restaurant messes up my order I will never allow them to remake my food I just return it and get my money back. So when I went to go return my order the little young lady that took my order have the audacity to tell me no. you ordered the carnitas. I'm okay with people messing up my order but I'm not okay with an attitude from someone who's trying to tell me what I ordered. Horrible customer service. I'm sure they won't miss our business and that's fine but me and my family will never return to this location."}
{"text":"Friendly business with great food. Always satisfied when I come here. Try the carne Asada fries!"}
{"text":"Decided to check this place out after a friend had recommended us to eat here. He told us to try their burritos, but we tried their rolled tacos and the carne asada fries. 

Multiple reviews said this spot was the best place to get carne asada fries, but I thought it was nothing special and 2/5 stars. I was debating between a California burrito or regular tacos, but I ended up buying the rolled tacos. With multiple yelpers praising their rolled tacos, I had high expectations only to find out they're taquitos! 

The meat inside was so dry that the added guacamole and sour cream on top didn't even help. Honestly, you're better off buying a pack of frozen taquitos from target or something. 

I would never return and I'm sure you can find a better place to get your Mexican food fix."}
{"text":"Love this place!  One of my favorite Mexican restaurants in PHX.  Their California burrito is out of this world.  Also love their breakfast burritos.  Must try, you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"When I lived in North Phx I went here  ALOT , its Cash only but open 24 hours- fabulous burritos and tacos when you have the munchies any time of day. I love their California burrito with a large Horchata nomnomnom"}
{"text":"This place makes solid food. Looks like a dumpy building because it is but the food is delicious and hot. I like the drive thru. Breakfast burritos are all I seem to get. But I can extrapolate that the non breakfast items are good from the beans, machaca, Assad, and great tortillas"}
{"text":"I love their carne asada French fries and the rolled tacos. I can't eat both in the same meal though. The fries could be split between two people. Good food and good prices."}
{"text":"Great true Mexican food! Go through the drive food and they will have your food out quick! I recommend their California burrito or their ham,eggs, and cheese breakfast burrito!"}
{"text":"I was in the area getting a wheel alignment done so I went for a stroll to find a place to eat. Came across Rolberto's so I stopped in. Its a typical roadside taco shop so I wasn't expecting too much. I ordered a breakfast burrito. The thing was huge and full of egg, cheese, and bacon (my meat choice). It was tasty and filling to say the least."}
{"text":"We always get the 5mini taco combo for $6.99 super delicious and well worth it!! Service is fast and friendly !!"}
{"text":"Not a fan at all. I was looking for a late night Taco stop that would surprise me, in a good way.  The food (Taco and enchilada) had a funky taste, slightly chemical. I threw it out after a few bites. Scottsdale rules for Mexican. You would have to be wasted to think this place was a gem."}
{"text":"Rolberto's Taco Shop does a magnificent job at providing genuine and superior customer service. They make delicious food and it's home made. It's a family owned business and they take time to prepare the meals. Keep up the fantastic work. Thank you."}
{"text":"I often drive past several 'bertos to go to this one specifically. I've been coming here for years and it's always the same few folks in the kitchen. That's important. Super friendly too. Never had any problem with the food in any way. The quality of the food just seems to be better than you usually get at these places (the salsas, the tortillas, the cuts of meat, etc.)
Huge bean/cheese burrito for under $3, Carne Asada can't be beat (almost never get fatty pieces or gristle), and I'd absolutely recommend the Adobada. So good. Good place with good people."}
{"text":"All the berto's restaurants have been a little lacking it but for food to go it is so worth the stop. The beans were really good and perfectly salted (a lot of other similar resturants really over salt their beans but wow really good). The outside was not the best, defintely take it to go as I said but their prices are great. The number 17 - two carne asada burritos and rice and beans could feed two, the meat was really good. Enchildas are amazing and they give a lot of lettuce which was awesome. People are super friendly, really liked it."}
{"text":"Very good taco shop. Carne asada is awesome and so is chicken.this is real mexican taco shop stuff.  If you like Taco Bell stay away, if you like the real deal go here.  Get yourself a carne asada burrito and you will not be sorry."}
{"text":"I work next door...
I enjoy Rolberto's for my typical Cheese Enchiladas dish...
But that is nothing that requires work.

Cheese not always fully melted :(
But restaurant always clean in dining area & staff always friendly."}
{"text":"HAPPY CINCO DE MAYO!

Here is where I celebrated my Cinco.  With 5 rolled tacos, how could you go wrong?  The 5 beauties were lined up in a row with quacamole, cheese and shredded lettuce all plopped on top, it was delish!

Not that any of these place  can boast cleanliness, neither can this place BUT- you get it to go.  Eat it at home and you are A-OK."}
{"text":"I come here a lot for breakfast. Forget Taco Bell! This is where it's at (at least for breakfast.) The burritos are filled with meat/eggs. I almost want to ask for less meat and cheese and replace a little with some beans but I don't want them thinking I don't like the food. It's just a ton of meat (and cheese)...and I'm really not complaining. 

I've never been inside. So glad they have a drive through. I am downgrading because they don't always respond to their drive thru customers. I'm not sure if the mechanism just doesn't work but it's really not very consistent. I sometimes just leave because I don't want to go inside.  It's not 'fast food' at all.  You do have to wait a bit and It's always hot and fresh...WHEN I can get it."}
{"text":"I'm not really sure if this is the right ROLBERTO'S that we ate at but it was really really good so if they are a chain and all related you really can't go wrong. It was funny because I really like a place called ROBERTO'S  and one of our friends we were with was a local and she said oh we have ROBERTO'S here and I was sold right then and there, and then when we pulled up I said \"hey this isn't ROBERTO'S it's ROLBERTO'S\"  this was entirely too funny to us and I hope you can appreciate the humor. 
The story aside the food delivered and we enjoyed it!"}
