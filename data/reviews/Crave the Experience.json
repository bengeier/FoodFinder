{"text":"Crave: The Experience is a new restaurant located in Cornelius, in the space formerly occupied by Stormy's.  Crave is aiming to promote the theme of \"food, fun and fame\" by offering customers, twice an hour, to get on-stage and perform, well, whatever they want to: sing acapella, recite poetry, offer up a shout-out, etc.  Karaoke and live music performances are also on the schedule, making Crave an interesting entertainment venue.  The restaurant is not big, but there is an outdoor patio area that is actually pretty nice and spacious, especially compared to the inside.  As far as food goes, Crave offers up tapas dishes to provide an interactive, sharing dining atmosphere.  There are also sandwiches, if you prefer not to share your food with everyone around the table.   You can get out for under $20 if you try, depending on the drinks your order of course, which is nice.  The lack of space notwithstanding, Crave is a nice addition to the varied restaurant/bars along Catawba Ave."}
{"text":"We visited again last night, and it was another nice meal.  For his meal, my husband ordered the lettuce wraps (offered with 3 different levels of spice.  He chose super hot).  I ordered a special, which was penne in a creamy roasted pepper sauce, topped with chicken.  After ordering, I started worrying that I had made a mistake, because it sounded like it would be bland.  It was not!  The chicken was very moist and flavorful, even a tad crispy.  The pasta and sauce were nice backup players to the chicken's yumminess.  When dh's lettuce wrap plate came out, it was seriously a presentation train wreck.  The meat and sauces are in nice little white bowls, but you couldn't even SEE them because the lettuce (Romaine) were just dumped in a pile over the top of the whole plate.  Weird.  He really seemed to enjoy the wraps though, and when he asked for more lettuce, it was brought promptly.  Service was very prompt (although the place was pretty empty), and our drinks never got completely empty.  The cake wasn't nearly as moist this time, but still had a good flavor.  We used a www.restaurant.com coupon again, and after that, ended up paying about $32 for 2 teas, 1 beer, 2 entrees, 2 side salads, 1 cake, and the tip.  WH!  On a down note, the waitress told us that they are only open for dinner now, from 5-10, Tuesday-Saturday.  That's only 25 hours a week.  I hope they survive!"}
