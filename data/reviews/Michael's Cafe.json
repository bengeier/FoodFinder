{"text":"So, after hearing about this place through one of my friends, my roomie and I decided to go and check it out on a Friday night.  I walked in and was impressed by how pretty and jazzy it looked inside and the musicians playing at the time were amazing and welcoming.  As everyone probably knows, during their happy hour it is 2-4-1.  So, we headed to the bar and were greeted by this rough and rather abrasive female bartender.  I felt as if I was in a ghetto hole in the wall at the bar, because her customer service skills were a negative 10.  Even at the hole in the walls on the East Coast where I am from, the bartenders were much nicer and attentive.  I may not be back just because of her.  Oh and they give you your two for one at the same time, instead of letting you sip on one and then come back for your other one later, like other bars, or restaurants do.  I do not like that system!!  Lastly, once again, the soul food out here is not very appealing and I think that I should just discontinue with trying to find it here in the Arizona area and just go back and visit friends in Los Angeles or family on the East Coast when I need an amazing soul food fix.  I had the cat fish nuggets, which were pretty tasty but nothing to write home about. I also had the mac-n-cheese which seemed to lack cheese, warmth (it was luke warm when it came out), and flavor.  Even the color was rather pale and not filled with gooey clumps of various cheeses.  I am not sure I will go back, maybe on Thursday for Ladies' Night if that rude and rough bartender with the pony tail is not there!  SMH"}
{"text":"We came to dance on Saturday night and the DJ did not disappoint. The bartender made me a stiff cuba libre, no watered down drinks here!  Beautiful people and wonderful atmosphere.  I will most def be back.  :-)"}
{"text":"Love having a place where the vibe is positive and everyone shows love.  From the moment you walk in, you feel comfortable and welcome. Latest no-cover entry for a Friday, even when you do have to pay the cover, I am not going to regret investing that $10.  Great drink specials, attentive owners, some stellar wait-staff.   If you're new in town or visiting, definitely check them out.   Thank-you Michael & Ricky for bringing us the kind of lounge we deserve!"}
{"text":"Attended a fundraising event there on Sunday, June 10th. It began at about 2 p.m. Didn't have a good experience. Was less than impressed with the service and food. Seems they were unprepared to accomodate their customers. They were VERY uncoordinated.   After being given an option of ordering from the menu or buffet, my entire table chose the buffet. We really wanted to check out the chicken, cat fish, ribs, black eyed peas, etc. Very much looking forward to the soul food prepared.   Once we stood in line for the buffet, we were told to go to our seats so that we could place our orders. (Something that I've NEVER experienced for a \"buffet\".) Once we returned to our seats, we began to order items from the buffet (and NOT the menu). We were very confused, as were the attendees of this event from surrounding tables. Got so bad, that people began to leave. Our server was very nice; however, she, too, expressed a great amount of frustration regarding our on-again off-again \"buffet\".   Once the food did come (it only came for four of six of us), the chicken was overcooked, greens and mac and cheese were lukewarm. Friends at the same table had the same complaints. A couple at our table (who DID NOT order anything special) received their food when we'd finished ours.   Needless to say, I am not going to be returning.  The background music was good, though. :-("}
{"text":"I have been there a few times and I absolutely love it. The food is great, the staff is wonderful, the music is always good and the atmosphere is pleasant.  Michael knows how to do Ladies Night :)."}
{"text":"After hearing abut this place from a friend and reading the reviews, I finally decided to give Michael's a try. I must admit I was pleasantly surprised by the classy atmosphere when I walked in.  It was Friday so we had 2-4-1 drinks and the food was good, love the fish.Definitely have to get there early to get a table, but I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Coming from someone who doesn't really enjoy nightclub's, this one is an exception, I really enjoyed this nightclub. You can enjoy live music from 5-8pm and awesome drink specials of buy one get one free during that time. After 8pm the place becomes packed and plan to dance the night away with a live DJ.     Also, I can't forget to mention the comfortable seating and tables. Here you have a waitress so you don't end up standing at the bar waiting for one or maybe two if you're lucky, bartender(s) to serve you a drink. In addition to that, Their food is great, I recommend the Fried Catfish Nuggets and fries. It's the best Catfish I've tasted in years!     I would definitely return here."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were looking for a place to have a few drinks on a weekend, and after driving by Michael's Cafe a few times, I figured it was time for us to check out this local spot.    First off, there was a cover of $10 to get in since there was a band playing.  This was not a big deal to us, and was even seen as a bonus, until the band stopped playing for the night one minute after we walked through the door.    We decided to order some drinks from the bartender who was very short with us.  The bartender proceeded to inform me that my order of a \"whiskey and soda\" and \"vodka and soda\" was $16.  This may have been one of the fancy nights that another reviewer was referring to and therefore drinks may have been more expensive but I am questionable about this.  I feel if a customer is ordering drinks by the generic name then that automatically means \"well\" drinks.  According to the price, these were not \"well\" drinks.  Whether the bartender took the initiative and decided I needed top shelf liquor in my drink or just decided to give me the shaft is up for debate.  I can tell you that I didn't taste Crown or even Jack Daniels in my drink.  We finished our drinks, paid our tab and left after feeling ripped off and not appreciated in all of about 15 minutes.  Pretty impressive, Michael's Cafe.    I expressed my disappointment with the employees that were taking money at the door about not even getting to see the band perform a full song.  I also told them how I felt they should let customers know if the band is about to quit before allowing them to pay the cover.  I asked if they could relay my disappointment to the owner; it seemed to fall on deaf ears.  As for the food, we obviously didn't try it, and unfortunately for them, probably never will.  The one picture of their food does look good.  Since we did not try the food, I decided to give them 2 stars instead of 1.  Hopefully things will start to get better."}
{"text":"Came here on ladies night for an event, service was great, food was delicious. The staff are very friendly and accommodating and the chicken tenders were great! There was a live band too. Fun environment."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and happy to see how well it has grown.  I was very impressed with the enhancements to ladies night on Thursdays.  I was greeted by a nice gentlemen host who presented me with a rose and showed me to a table of yummy hors d'oeuvres that included fresh fruit, pretzels, chocolate fountain and shish kabobs.  He also told me they were doing manicures for five dollars at the back of restaurant as well as massages!  I joined my group of friends and we enjoyed appetizers, drink specials and the awesome live band and as if that wasn't enough they had the gentlemen host come around with complimentary specialty shots throughout the evening.  Only thing I could suggest is getting the word out to the handsome gentleman who would appreciate ladies night, especially since Michael's Cafe is doing an exceptional job putting the ladies in great spirits.  I also think its a great date night for the lovely couples.  All in all another fun night at Michaels Cafe:)"}
{"text":"We have been looking for a good dance/night club for too long.  So many in the valley are dirty, run down and crammed with inadequate seating that going to those clubs is just not fun.  The \"exclusive\" clubs in Scottsdale have ridiculous parking, horrible DJs and too many twenty-somethings who think that standing on the dance floor, drink in one hand and raising their other hand in some sign or gesture is cool.  (it's not - listen to the old school hit - \"no parkin', baby, no parkin' on the dance floor!\") Michael's is clean and nicely decorated.  The seating is not crammed together and the place has a great, friendly vibe.  I haven't seen a men's bathroom as hip and clean as the one in Michael's EVER!  The servers and staff are friendly, helpful and quick.  The band last night was excellent, started on time and took short breaks.  The DJ who played during the breaks spun a sweet variety of dance tunes that keeps the groove movin'.  The catfish was piping hot and the fries were done to perfection.  Michael's Cafe is the best nightclub in the Phoenix Valley. Period."}
{"text":"The staff went out of their way to accommodate us, even when our party grew from 6 to 11.  Everyone was nice...everyone except the bartender (who I believe used to work at Club Central). She came to my table to let me know that the drink combination I ordered from my server was not allowed (...shrug). It would have been more appropriate to tell my server instead of me.   Otherwise, it was a good time and my Aunt visiting from Mississippi really enjoyed the live music.  Kenya, our server kept the food and drinks coming in a timely manner and was attentive to our rather 'hyper\" party.  Fred and the MC/DJ were exceptional. They were quite instrumental in making our night memorable."}
{"text":"I'm from MD originally.  Our nightlife scene is drastically different from Phoenix's nightlife scene obviously.  Michael's is one of the best places to cut a rug in Phoenix.  Back East we like to start our weekends off with partying on Thursday night so Michael's ladies night event is right up my alley!    I must say I've never seen a DJ play music videos to get the party started though, I'm used to actually DJs playing hits and scratching ... but ... when in Rome ....  I've been to Michael's on Thursday nights more times than I can count and enjoy myself every single time.  My boyfriends and I finally gave Michael's a shot a couple Saturdays ago and enjoyed it as much as a Thursday night!"}
{"text":"The drinks are good.  The food was flavorful as expected.  I can't remember my server's name, but she was AWESOME!!  The music was great, as always!  I will continue to go back.  HOWEVER....get rid of the double standard for dress code.  Drove 35 minutes to get to your establishment.  Spent $55 on a new pair of shoes, because I wasn't allowed in.  And then a $5 entry fee after having the \"appropriate\" shoes.  All so I can have dinner....really??!!  If men can't wear a nice pair of  sandals, then neither should the women.  And by the way....this is Arizona and 115 degrees!!"}
{"text":"I've been to Michael's Cafe before and after it relocated to former Club Central (3rd St. and Central Ave) and I think it remains the only and best place that Phoenix has to offer for African American night life. Casa Blanca in Scottsdale is ok (better crowd on Friday nights) however the only other place to experience black life in Phoenix is Micheal's Cafe. I would recommend to all who are new to Phoenix."}
{"text":"I checked this place out on Octocber 3rd and i believe this was first friday and my first time there, and i really enjoy myself i went with a lady friend who has been there and wanted to get me out the house so i was very impress with the music and the drinks. I can tell you one thing they dont cheat you on the drinks, a nice size vodka and oj glass for $5 isnt bad. Didnt try the food but i heard it was okay!! Other than that the music was on point from The Dells to the Ojays and they even play some Drake towards the end of the night i was impress with everything to be honest and honestly next time i go i will bring the guys because it was more ladies then men in that place... The only reason why i didnt rate this a 5 star is because they seem not to let you in with Aldo's are Steve Maddens, if it has a white sole on the bottom and even though its consider casual shoes on the website, They consider it tennis shoes so be wary and cautious. Dress shoes is ther model, But it just depends who is at the door. And also the security team was cool but i think they went overboard with the suit and ties and the earpiece's. Im law enforcement and really its not that serious you know. I guess coming from Atlanta im use to seeing police outside the bldg or walking inside so this was different for me. But overall i liked it lay back and older 30+ crowd with older people as well..   dress code is enforce which is always a good thing.....     Overall A.........."}
{"text":"Without a doubt, the best catfish and greens in town. The catfish is clean-tasting and moist, the cornmeal coating is crispy and delicious. The greens are tender, but not soggy and cooked to death, there's still some \"tooth\" to them. Plus they have a little heat in the background."}
{"text":"Great music , dark bar slow R&B , can't help but move ur body . Bartender is sweet w generous pours of ur fav beverage .  I'm coming back on live music nights ."}
{"text":"This is a special invitation for you to be a part of \"Michael's Café. A new casual dining restaurant smothered with southern hospitality. What Phoenix has been missing, \"Quality, Respect, and Chivalry!\" Please join us for some Great Food and Great Music."}
{"text":"Liked the Bar downstairs . Gets really crowded upstairs on the dance floor . Had a fun"}
{"text":"Love the mature, upscale and sexy atmosphere. Deliciously smooth jazz tunes and homegirl cookin is off-the-hook. Crowd reminds me of Mr. Pepper days 20 years ago but all grown up.  ;-)  Decor could use some hipster enhancements."}
{"text":"I love the vibe!! Way better than sky lounge. It's a little cafe with different reggae, hip hop, r&b music! Bartender was too packed though. Took a while to order our drinks. But the vibe and the music was amazing tonight. One of our friends dad was DJng tonight and he did a superb job!"}
{"text":"Packed!! That is the best way to describe this place on a Friday night. PACKED!!! Plus it was early too. By 7pm it was already standing room only. It was first Friday so I expected it to be busy, and boy was it. I can say that it was people watching at is finest and some of the patrons were down right RUDE however, I still had a good time. The drinks were good and strong ( 2 for 1 making my di'sarrono and orange juice the cheapest and strongest I have had EVER and the price was perfect! Win in my book)  The band that was playing was jamming out however the DJ was not the best. It did not stop us from having a good time nonetheless. Please note that once you leave, you can't just walk back in if there is a line. You will have to stand outside like everyone else and wait. I will give the owner made props as there were people who appeared to be his friends trying to give him money to enter and he turned them away and said they had to stand in line like everyone else. Kudos in my book. The place is a little small so like I said before, get there early! I am sure at this rate, he will be finding a new location soon to accommodate his growing clientele. I will have to come back on a not so busy day to try the amazing food I have heard about."}
{"text":"I was looking for a Friday casual dinner spot and was referred to Michael's. The crowd here is older/very mature, but since we came here to dine and not dance, that wasn't an issue for us.  Let me begin with service:  Upon entrance, we waited for a host to greet and seat us. No one ever showed up. We ended up walking to the bar and had to wait even longer for someone to assist us. There was not a large crowd, it was about 6pm. Our server for the night was very nice. However, service was very slow.  Now for the good part: The food. Our food was amazing. I can't remember the name of our dish, but there is a pic below. Besides everything tasting great, the price was unbeatable. We split our dish between two, but 3-4 people could easily be satisfied from the meats. You do get your money's worth.   I definitely recommend coming here for the food."}
{"text":"Great New Year's Party! Live music, DJ, dinner, breakfast and GREAT SERVICE! Thanks for a perfect New Years Eve to bring in 2015."}
{"text":"I have been to this place on each day that it is open.  It is of course packed on Fri and Sat's but also a nice place to go on the other days it is open.  Thurs is the day for the ladies to get pampered as they offer $5 manicures, martinis and massages in a separate section.  Can't beat that if you did it at home!  But before you even get past the front door, you are greeted by handsome gentlemen that escort you to the baby grand piano that is beautifully decorated in various fruits, chocolate fountains, hot dishes and desserts, as well as a long stem single rose for each lady.  Beautiful ice sculptures.  Who else does that???  And once you get past all that you aren't just abandoned, you are greeted by very sincere and nice wait staff who have tasters of new drinks they are trying out for you to sample.  The same gentlemen come to you and ask you if you need any other already chocolate covered strawberries with coconut, shaved nuts and other things that would give Sherrie's Berries a run for their money so you don't even have to get up!  It isn't very crowded.  Live band and DJ that gets you engaged in the music being played.  Extremely pleasurable experience I look forward to every Thurs.  The restrooms are clean all the time.  Hard to come by in an establishment that serves alcohol as some don't know how to hold their liquor.  Wonderful ambiance that gets better and better with each upgrade made from one visit to the next.  Owner, Michael, has a great eye for decor.  And they haven't been open that long!  As for some of the other comments I read about the food, I guess I've just been lucky every time I've been and never had any complaints and I've been thru the whole menu a couple times.  Definite place to consider when you don't want to be around the young kids, thugs, worry about getting shot or any fights.  I highly recommend getting there early on weekends because this new hidden gem is getting the advertisement it deserves.    Lastly, Wed night band and Karaoke nights are a blast!  Also laid back and not too crowded.  Wish I lived/worked closer and I would be there daily!  Really, its just that much of a grown up, sexy chill spot. Owner and staff sincerely want its guests to have a good time and make sure you are pleased with your visit or figure out what they need to do to make it right. I dare you to find some place better!"}
{"text":"Ok, so my husband and I are from the good ole Philadelphia, and we were looking for a little bit of nightlife.  He heard about Michael's  and we decided to take a trip over to Check it out...   The good:  Good ole school mix, drink specials and the food is tasty. It's always a nice crowd, We've been there at least 3 times and it's always pretty full. The waitress are super sweet.  The bad:  My husband and I are in our early to mid 30's; we are also from a strictly urban area so our music choice is a little different. so some of the music is a little dated or just different than what we vibe too!   Overall:  The prices are not bad especially on nights they have drink specials. We like that it's close to another bar (chars has the blues) that we can hop between the two. The food is tasty I do think it's a little overpriced but again, it's not anything that will stop me from returning again occasionally.  The crowd is nice and ful"}
{"text":"5 stars mean void of fault, so I give Michael's 5 stars. Each star represents one facet: Atmosphere: very relaxed, clean, low lighting, I felt like I was on a film set for a juke joint--a cool one.  Service: polite, smiling, SINCERELY nice servers. We only ordered cokes and one appetizer to share between two, and we were treated just as attentitively and pleasantly as if we were spending a lot.  Food: Exactly as I remember and taste from brisket/BBQ/catfish places in Houston TX, nothing EXTRAORDINARY but just what you expect, crave, and admire---good ole BBQ brisket n catfish nuggets! This isn't Le Cordon Bleu, it's Michael's Cafe, and the food is just FINE!   OK that makes up 3 stars, the next two are for providing excellent music (we got in without paying cover last night on account of we just wanted food, but we got to enjoy the fantastic band! Great band, singer, musicians.. just great) the owner(?) came out and greeted us when we came in, what a nice touch! A very classy place, no you don't need high dollar furnishings or lighting in the thousands to make a place, Michael's did a fine job, no I do NOT know the owners or anything--just a customer--PS I was the lady who ordered a brisket n fries for lunch today and almost got lost on my way out the door ;/"}
{"text":"Oh Michael's where do I even begin...What my friends and I remember about  ladies night was not what we experienced this past Thursday night (see the fixes below). I will admit we did not get there until a little bit before 8pm, so there was not a lot of food left at the free buffet, but the server was nice enough to give us the last of the food. The cucumber/cream cheese appetizer and macaroni and cheese were amazing--I wish that there would have been more of this. Also, because we got there later all of the tables were filled up and we ended up standing for about 30 minutes until a table opened up--so I definitely recommend getting there at 7 or earlier.   Positives: The music--until 10pm they have a live R&B band which is amazing! They play a great mix of classic and new R&B. They encourage you to dance and it is a lot of fun! The live DJ played more Chicago stepping music this past Thursday, so if you did not know how to step you pretty much kept bumping into people on the dance floor. Ladies night is awesome because ladies get in for free, they give you a rose, they have a free buffet, and they give away prizes--I won a pair of Diamondbacks tickets--smile!  Fixes: The service was horrendous. Michael's is not that big and maybe has 15 tables and there were 4-5 wait staff, so why did our waitress never come back to check on us, refill our water, or ask how our food was? I ended up taking our water cups to the bar and asking the bartender to refill them.Also, my guy friend ended up getting our wine at the bar as I our waitress never returned. She came a total of four times--to get our menu, to get our order, and to drop off/pick up our check. If we did not go get beverages ourselves we would have never gotten them and spent the rest of the evening thirsty.   The food---oh gosh, were do I start? On Thursday nights they have a smaller menu, so there are only a few items to choose from ranging from $7-$15. My friends and I decided to order the nachos with fried chicken added and the sampler platter with catfish, waffle fries, and chicken wings. We were surprised by the lack of food that was on the plates when they were brought out. After getting over that we started to taste the food and it left a lot to be desired. The cheese on the nachos was cold, runny, and tasteless; the chips were the same kind you see at the movies when you order nachos; and there was no salsa, sour cream, beans, etc.--just fried chicken, cheese, and chips--it was such a disappointment that we sent it back. The sampler platter food was not any better as it was cold as well. The best thing on the platter was the waffle fries as you could tell they used some good seasoning . But, isn't that sad that the best thing on a sampler platter is the fries?!? And they have the nerve to put on the bottom of their menu \"We specialize in quality over quantity\"--my answer to that is you all specialize in neither one as the food needs a major upgrade.  I am unsure of what has happened to Michael's Café in the span of just a few months, but they need to make some major changes before I return again--if I ever return. The food and service is a joke and I expected a lot more from a restaurant that I enjoyed so much--now that is in the past. I wish that I could recommend another spot instead of this to go where you can get live R&B music and food, but many of them have closed."}
{"text":"Great place sit down seating and food. It would be 5 starts if I was 50! Great place for your mom and dad my group was 30-40 and we felt the music was to slow and old school."}
{"text":"$$$$-FOR-FAKERS!! Except there ain't no $30,000 boob-slash-nose jobs or BMW-drivin', MK-totin', Prada-wearin' scottsdale-plastic here! it's just a bizarre parallel-universe, bermuda-triangle zone of dress code, fried food and a ridiculous $250 table reservation fee in the middle of the ghetto!  In summary: SEVERE cultural differences and whacked understandings of service standards. I'm not sure how it happened, but i am out of place here. And i used to live a thousand feet from this goddam club!  . i'm the first to shake my head when i see a lengthy and heated exchange between a yelper and an owner. so when I saw the volleys between 3-year-Elite Asina G. and owner Rick, I wanted to look closer. Hell, this is my hood! Don't forget, people: Amy's Baking Company was making Yelp Eliters' blacklists for *years* before Chef Ramsey's visit a few months ago!  let. me. be. clear. This neighborhood is GHETTO! And i mean that in a Margaret Cho way! And I can say that because I lived a thousand feet from this club for -- count 'em -- 11 years! With the arrival of the light rail across camelback I *watched* the homeowners flee and businesses decline. But it was never that great before light rail anyway! On one corner you had a strip club, on another a mattress store, and behind it a hotel that rents rooms by the hour! i watched 3 iterations of ownership try to make this drycleaner's storage room into a restaurant. God bless them!  . To wit: The driveway features a tent sign that says \"FIX YOUR CLOTH HERE\" with grease pencil \"ES\" at the end of CLOTH! Another sign is taped to the driveway's brick pillar and says \"FIX SUIT HERE FAST!\" Another one is taped to the window: \"FAST TAILOR HERE DAYS\". Don't believe me? I took pictures! Check them out!  WHAT DO YOU MEAN A PAIR OF *CLEAN* PLAID VANS IS NOT ALLOWED? The dress code sign is leaned up against a card table leg and the letters spelling \"No Tennis Shoes\" are the cheapest-ass bingo-hall snack-bar menu letters I've ever seen in my goddam life!!!  I wonder. Is this a resurrection of the jockey club of former fame just a quarter mile east? That club closed 25 years ago after multiple gang shootings and deaths. My G*D, I hope and pray not!  . The story. i intended to celebrate with business partners, colleagues and friends for a CD release party. after walking past the signage mentioned above, we approached the cashier sitting beneath an awning outside the door. A black man sitting nearby got up from his stool, stepped out from underneath the awning, an then looking at me, bent back over his waist, tilted his head sideways and began moving his head up and down LOOKING me over. He was mumbling to himself in slang and posturing as if he was looking for an escalation. Oh dear. This is the doorman. Still contorted, he threw his arm at me, pointing and saying, \"This one's OK, but THAT one can't come in!\" Now pointing at my guest's shoes, the man said, \"No tennis shoes!\"  Dress code violation. WHAT? Where the F*&# do you people think you are?! this is 7th avenue and camelback, goddamit!   I asked for Ricky. The man said, \"He *might* be here\" but refused to find him or take further action. When I insisted, he began repeating \"concerning?\" He was now sitting back in his chair, slumped over, crossing his arms at me and giving me an indignant, disgusted look.  After he berated me and humiliated me, repeating \"concerning?\" over and over, I explained that I intended to inform a manager about how he was treating me. He shooed at me with the back of his hand and slumped further in his chair, guffawing.  Incredulous, I called the club and someone told me that Ricky was not working. I insisted that a manager come out and speak with me and one did. The manager supported the behavior of his employee and told me he was doing his job. When I began to point at the surrounding buildings and businesses and attempted to remind him where we were, he interrupted me, saying he was insulted and refused to speak with me further. He refused to give me his name and then stood with the doorman talking about us, laughing and pointing.  Horrified, I called our friends inside to explain that we would not be joining them, and watched as four separate black couples approached and were greeted cordially and gracefully by the manager and the doorman. No contorted posturing, mumbling or pointing treatment for them. And they were dressed as casually as we.   . Ricky B. -- Make no mistake. My and my fellow yelp-eliter Asina G.'s impressions are our own, and you are free to treat your customers as you will. Yelp even allows you to make a public response to our impressions and it will be placed below.

{"text":"Being from KC, I am used to a dark, smoky, loud, fun place and this hit the spot (although the smoke was from the kitchen vs cigs). Last night we went to Michael's café. Luckily we were told to get there early (6:30) so we got the last table. They had a great band that started about 7 and played for a few hours. Nice size dance floor and we took advantage of it. The band left a few hours later and the DJ started. Lots of great music. Not for the young crowd (so we fit right in).  It's like a blast from the past - 80s, 90s, 00s music and outfits from every decade you can imagine. Would go again  We didn't have any food, but people seemed to be enjoying it."}
{"text":"1st time here... Ladies Night on Thursdays with the law school crew... No cover before 10pm. We made it... Upon entering, Dude Deon tells us drinks specials with \"M's\" Margaritas, Martinis, Mimosas.. etc...so we're ready to have a good time. Mature \"lite\" crowd. Ambiance, cool. However, bait and switch on the drinks... smh! $10 Martini's (told after we ordered a few). No comps. Ordered food... wings and fish (batter on both- lite to no seasoning). Music- Slight \"ratchet\" and old school with minimal Top hiphop 40's. Ironically, we were warned before entering... 2 stars for potential... Food-NO, Drinks-NO, Customer Service- NO, Music- ehh... NO. Photographer gave us a nice keepsake though... Will we return. Probably not! Step it up, Michaels... Your promoter, Deon made you lose our business."}

{"text":"I really want to like this place; but it just does not give my that fuzzy feeling that I get when I go to other lounges in the valley.First of all...the place is small, and its croweded on Friday to the point where you cant enjoy yourself. Being able to have space to two step or people watch is impossible. Next...there is a cover after 8. C'mon son...really. Most spots in Phoenix you can get on for free. I am not cheap in any way..but this is not an exclusive club for heavens sake!! I really want to support the local African American businesses; but they always want to charge you a ridiculously high cover when I can keep it moving to Scottsdale .for free. The music is the only reason why I gave it 2 stars. I know I can hear some great tunes from the 90's , current tunes and even some reggae, which is uncommon out here. I dont know if I will be back..."}
{"text":"I went for the first time to Michael's Cafe two weeks ago on a Saturday night.  My friends and usually hit up Scottsdale but decided to try something different.  Of course when my friend recommended we try Michael's I went on Yelp to see the reviews.  Reviews were good, and I really liked the fact that Ricki (Ricky) not sure of the spelling, responded to all reviews, that is definitely good management!  Saturday night my girls and I arrived, the music was nice, the small crowd seemed to be geared towards couples and it wasn't packed at all. The men all dressed sharp but the woman not so much.  We somewhat felt over dressed.  We ordered a round of drinks and some catfish and fries, and the catfish was delicious.  I was really craving some greens but we were told by the waitress they stopped serving them after 10pm.  We decided we'd eat and then head to Scottsdale.  Right before leaving Ricky introduced himself and chatted us up, very pleasant handsome man.  He gave us some information about other nights at Michael's.  It definitely seems like it would be a great place to be at on Thursday Ladies night or on Friday (he mentioned it is wall to wall packed on that night).  Grown and sexy place, looking forward to checking it out on a different night.  Thanks Ricky!"}
{"text":"This is in response to the owner's comments to me.  Yelp doesn't provide a tool where I can respond to his comments directly (without sending a private message), so I have to write an update.   To your first comment, we didn't have a party of 8, we had a party of about 13 (hence my earlier comment that we didn't even fit at two tables), so we wouldn't fit in one of your booths that fits 8. And in fact, once we all got there, we were offered a booth (as there 2 booths right by us that were empty the whole night), which we declined because we didn't want to be all scrunched up in a little booth.  The bigger area that accommodates more people is ridiculously priced, and I know this because we checked.   Second, as I stated in my review, ONE OF YOUR EMPLOYEES told me that this is just your policy, not a liquor license rule, so if you have employees giving out misinformation, then that's something you might want to get under control.  Had I been told it was a liquor license violation to bring in (and not consume) a bottle of wine as a gift, I would have understood.  However, that's not what I was told.  He affirmatively told me that it was just your rule.    Third, as I said in my earlier review, the place was EMPTY at 5pm.  And also as I said earlier, we all had agreed to get there early, so we were all there between 6 and 6:30, so us \"saving tables\" was never an issue.  We were there to spend money, and had invited 11 other people to your establishment -- people who would not have normally gone to your establishment on their own -- to come and spend their money.  So to be hassled by one of your employees while the place was empty was very annoying and offensive.    Fourth, unfortunately, this is the trend with black-owned businesses, which is why most of them fail at some point (e.g., Club Central, Warren's, Bobby C's).  Instead of focusing on making their customers happy, they make their customers feel like they're doing us some kind of favor by letting us patron their establishments.  That's not the way to keep customers happy.  Majority establishments go out of their way to accommodate their customers, especially when it's a big group.  I have never experienced that at a black-owned restaurant/bar.  Fifth, it's nice that you're on site to deal with issues.  However, my choice to post my reviews on Yelp is exactly that, my choice.  The evening of our outing was not the appropriate time for that, as the focus was my girl's achievement, not fussing with management about their policies.  That is the whole purpose behind Yelp and any other site where you can post reviews.  I'm sure you don't tell your customers who had good experiences to just tell you about them instead of posting them on Yelp, so you shouldn't do that with customers who had bad experiences.   And I'm sorry, but Michael's Café is not what I would call an \"upscale\" establishment, as you keep referring to it.  It can be a cool place to go and be around other black folks, but \"upscale\" it is not.  I appreciate that you're trying to provide a venue for black people in the Valley, but let's keep it real."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a down to earth place that offers good food, good drinks and friendly (but sometimes slow) service AND you also want to see some great local talent peform while you eat, this is the place to go.  I live in the East Valley and I do travel to Phoenix to enjoy their fried chicken wings and fried cabbage.  Please go on a Saturday night as you will be able to listen to one of Phoenix BEST musical talents, Vaughn Wills, AKA SWIF (sing what I feel)."}
{"text":"First thing's first- if you're a single woman under 40 and looking to mingle with attractive fellas below baby boomer age, this is not the place for you!!!!! My girlfriends and I were very, very disappointed at the lack of 30ish guys both times we went.  Secondly- this is an adults only nightclub that bleeps the curse words out of the songs they play. Additionally, most of the music is lamestream R&B from the 90's.  Thirdly- the only wine they serve seems to be \"Sutter Home\" and the champagne they serve is subpar. We asked if we could bring our own champage on NYE (even offered to pay a corkage fee) and were told no.  For Superbowl Saturday they had TWO bartenders for what looked like a crowd of 200+ people. It took almost 30 minutes standing at the bar to get a drink. Atrociously understaffed. Awful service.  I really don't think much more needs to be said. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to eat at Michael's Cafe for a couple of months now, I tonight I finally made it in. My neighbor, James, and I took a walk here tonight and I couldn't be happier to call Michael's my next best neighbor.  We started out with the wings. James wanted the sauce on the side. I don't think he really understands the concept of buffalo wings, but that's another story. The wings were perfectly cooked, but the sauce tasted like Frank's Red Hot. Which is fine; I love Frank's Red Hot. Then our entrees arrived: the fried chicken for James and the catfish for myself. Our sides were fried cabbage, dirty rice, greens and mac & cheese. My catfish was perfectly cooked and the breading was wonderful. James enjoyed his chicken. The sides, though, were simply divine. The fried cabbage with pieces of bacon was out of this world. I plan to go back with this side in mine, and eventually schmooze up to the staff and get this recipe. The dirty rice was great. the greens were served with green beans and were great and the mac & cheese was great. Plus we took advantage of the two-for-one drink special.  Michael's Cafe was definitely worth waiting for, but something to consider is it can get expensive. Our dinner, with drinks, costs around $30 and it was very much worth it. But it isn't something I could swing every day. Nonetheless, this is going to be a place I'll return too soon and put in my regular rotation."}
{"text":"I have been to Michael's at least 9 times in the past 12 months.  I started going in Nov 2011 for 1st Friday's.   There's a lot I can say about this establishment!    The club: My girlfriends and I usually end up here on first Friday's for what we call, \"Girl's Night Out.\"  We, well I do, always arrive before 8 pm before there is a cover charge at the door.  Since I like cocktails, I usually order one right away because they have 2-4-1 before 8pm each Friday.  I\"ve never been disappointed by the bartenders at Michael's.  I think their bartenders are overworked and are excellent at what they do!  You have to get there earlier than I do in order to get a table right away.  Otherwise, you're left standing around waiting for a table.  We've never really had an awful time with waiting for folks to leave and free up tables.  A lot of folks that come right after work are leaving between 8pm and 9pm because the live band that plays wraps up around that time and they've been there for 3 or 4 hours at this point.  Oh yeah, speaking of live bands... yes, there is a live band that plays before 8pm.    Back to 1st Friday... Every time I've gone for 1st Friday, this place was packed to the HILT!!!!  You certainly won't miss out on people watching here!   I guess I'm too old to relate to table/bottle service, but I attempted to get a table during a weekend when several of my friends were in town, but the table was a staggering $200.  Now, I am cheap, that's why I have never arrived after 8pm, so when I heard $200, I scoffed at the thought of paying that for a bottle of liquor and some juice.  HOWEVER, having said that, I respect these folks way of  conducting business.  I just can't participate in that.  The food: The food gets a 4 Star from me.  I love their wings.  I was there for 1st Friday this month and I think they changed their formula/receipe for the wings.  WHOA, the wings were exceptionally good this month.  I've also had the catfish, and that was decent.  The fries are standard and par for the course.      I would love to give Michael's a 4 or 5, but it lacks the HIP, Trendy feel I truly long for in Phoenix.  But then again, perhaps Michael's is not supposed to be HIP, Trendy, but more an around-the-way kinda feeling club and my expectations are in the wrong place."}
