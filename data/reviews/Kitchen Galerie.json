{"text":"Absolument fantastique!"}
{"text":"This is the best restaurant I have ever ate at... That's big coming from someone who lives in San Francisco AKA the city of food! I had to stop after ever bite just to remember the flavor of all the different froix gras. The steak tartar was perfectly spiced and the oysters were amazing. I was only visiting Montreal for a few days for my birthday and my friends thought KG was right up my alley and boy were they right. I will have to fly to Montreal once a year now just to eat at KG because It's just that irresistible."}
{"text":"one of the best steaks in city ,the food is always fresh ,the menu change but the steak stay !!"}
{"text":"The staff was awesome! Very friendly and knowledgeable. Fantastic cocktails! They have daily specials and a great menu. Very satisfied overall. If I could change something I would add more veggies on the plate and use a tad less salt! But it was good enough that I would go back happily!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the food in that restaurant. The atmosphere is casual and fun. The fact that you're served by the chefs is cool and you can tell they love and care about food.  The seared foie gras was perfectly prepared (which is definitely not that common). The fish I had was very good.   Overall I really liked the place.  Also the price was much better than what the 4 $ signs suggest. I recommend it."}
{"text":"This a must-reserve restaurant. It's small but the experience is well worth the tight space. There's no waiters. Well to be precise, the chefs are also your waiters.  The chefs here are pros. They get all their produce from Jean-Talon Market and the menu changes constantly. It's all about what's in season. You probably will never get the same meal twice. Though they have the  The meal was truly an experience and well worth the infinite attempts to get in. Though, I've head some people get lucky and are able to get a same day reservation for two people.  The most memorable dish was the stingray dish. My first time. I was surprised at the texture but was happy I ordered it."}
{"text":"TRÈS décevant - menu trop limité, prix très élevés et on trouve un cheveu dans un des plats... :((( On le mentionne au serveur, il nous promet de ne pas mettre ce plat sur notre facture, qui apparaît finalement quand même dans le total comptabilisé !! Et comble de bonheur, toilette compissée par une bande de gars hyper bruyants qui fêtaient un \"bachelor\" - apétissant... On n'y retournera jamais"}
{"text":"Ce restaurant est fabuleux! Les prix sont plus que raisonnables et comprennent au minimum une entrée et un désert. Le personnel est incroyable, autant en fonction qu'en pause, nous pouvons prendre une pause cigarette et jaser avec eux, ils vous demanderons comment est le plat qu'il vous a cuisiné! S'asseoir au bar est un \"must\" on y voit toutes les préparations car la cuisine est juste devant vous! En prime, vous jasez avec lui cuisiniers pendant qu'ils préparent les plats! Je le recommande toute fois pour les grandes faims, le gaspillage est proscrit quand c'est aussi bon!"}
{"text":"I would recommend making reservations and checking out this delicious restaurant.  Ingredients are fresh from the Jean Talon market close by and do not disappoint.  The cool thing is that while there is no prix fixe menu, you can tell your waiter how much you want to spend and they'll make a menu for you.  For $40 each, we dined on this delicious corn dog concoction, beef tartare, seared skate fish, braised short rib, and an amazing foie gras/apple dessert.  While on this particular evening service was a little slow, everyone was very nice and accommodating.  Check it out."}
{"text":"I went to this adorable cozy resto recently with a group of Foodies and totally loved the experience. The resto itself is small but big enough to hold tables of 12 people. They have a lovely open kitchen concept where you can see the chefs cooking away! Interior decor is quite lovely with its red and black concept. The service is very friendly which added to the overall great experience! I have heard so much about this restaurant that I had to try it for the mtlatable event. I now know why this resto tucked away steps from the marche jean-talon has become super popular. Now for the food, I must say their dishes are super creative and full of plenty of taste and flavor. I tried their calamari salad which was packed with flavor and taste. Their home made gnocchi with their garlic butter spinach sauce blew my mind away every bite was so delicious and the portion was just right. Gnocchi were super light tasting and yummy. We ended off our supper with their heavenly tasting chocolate mousse covered with toasted almonds!  Simply delicious and worth leaving room for it! It definately lived up to its reputation and will go back to try other dishes!"}
{"text":"If I had to choose a last meal this would make the list. Had a great bottle of wine, had the most expensive thing on the menu the steak for 2 with truffles and fois Gras, worth every penny.   Had the dishwasher cooked pate (it's salty be warned must eat with the jelly and ask for extra bread) and the cheese ball appetizer = yum.   Had the dessert to go the cheesecake and brownie were awesome. Ate it the next morning soo good wish we had room to eat it at night.   Word to the wise wear layers so you can peel them off when the open kitchen heat goes from nice to over the top."}
{"text":"Eight foodies (and drinkies?) visiting from NYC. I think we ate and drank everything. It all was fabulous. Joannie (sp?) was one of the best servers we have had anywhere, and everyone in the restaurant was so wonderful. The food was fantastic, and the drinks were tasty, generous and inventive. Absolutely worth a visit. Thank you for the wonderful service, and fantastic food and drinks!! We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"I have no words to describe this place. I was taken here by a friend of one of the owners tonight. We never ordered a thing but were served one stunning dish after another. I haven't got a clue what some of this amazing food was, but every bite was an explosion of goodness from beginning to end. I've come to Montreal for decades and I've got to say, this place is going into my bookmarks. I travel more than 100k a year all over NA and some Europe. This place conquered a spot in my top 5 in one visit!!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! Thanks to some of the other reviews, we knew to ask a about the personalized menu.  We told the waiter our budget ($50 CAD = $38), our preferences, things we don't eat and things we really enjoy.  Based on this we got a surprise 5 course meal catered to our liking.  This meal was phenomenal!  We had shrimp sliders, beef tartar, tuna tataki, steak and potatoes and chocolate mousse.  Each course was soo good.  I wish I took pictures to show the food, but we basically devoured it all.  My favorite course was the steak over a bed of veggies and mashed potatoes.  The portion was insane, we ended up taking it home.  All in all, one of the best dining experiences.  Thank you Kitchen Galerie."}
{"text":"Un des meilleurs restaurants à Montréal. A essayer absolument. Apparemment le foie gras est à l'honneur et tout goûtait divin."}
{"text":"My sister invited me there a couple months ago and I can't say nothing bad. The concept is fun. There is no \"menu\" to this restaurant. The chef decide each day what they will serve. They go in their backyard (marché Jean Talon) and choose everything fresh and exotic. We had meat with sweet potatoes and some asparagus. It looks basic, but it's the quality of the food the makes the difference. You taste the freshness of everything. It's almost if it's prepared in front of you and served right away... The chef was also the waiter, that'S pretty cool.   The place is tiny, so book in advance if you don't want to be disappointed. Parking is easy too.   Only good things to say about this one! Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"This can be short because the offense is egregious and obvious.  The device I'll use is a timeline.  Tuesday:  we research great places to eat for a special occasion dinner Wednesday:  we make the reservation at Kitchen Galerie Friday:  we fly from San Francisco to Montreal Sunday:  we show up for our reservation, excited to eat a great meal, and arrive to a closed restaurant.  No lights.  No people.  just a sign.  Closed for a couple of days,  That's right.  They took a reservation from out of towners and chose to shut down the restaurant less than 96 hours later, and not call us to let us know.  To make matters worse, it's not like this restaurant is in a hopping neighborhood.  We wasted maybe 90 minutes on the round trip and had to scramble to find a place to eat with zero notice.    I hope the people who made this possible may someday travel to San Francisco and find themselves in a strange, dead neighborhood in front of a closed restaurant with their wife and wonder how to recover the evening in a different language on a moment's notice."}
{"text":"I don't know where to start with this one- it was absolutely amazing. I visited the location in the Old Port and I had this idea in my head that this was going to be another pretentious, overpriced place with snobby service and mediocre food.  It was completely the opposite. The meal isn't cheap. Main courses run from $25-$35 and it's one of those places where it's impossible not to have an appetizer. Go for the oysters, you will thank me later. NIce selection of wines with most bottles in the $50 range. You have the choice of ordering from the board (list of fresh fish) or from the menu. Don't underestimate the standard menu! I had scallops, shrimp and blood sausage on mashed potatoes with crispy onions and i would order the same way next time too! The guys that work there know their stuff and are so happy to sit down and chat about the menu.  Do yourself a favour and go here. It's worth every penny. Your palette deserves this hug."}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me to Kitchen Galerie last week for my birthday. What an incredible dining experience. The atmosphere is very welcoming while still being edgy (our waiter/chef/sommelier was handsome, charming and quirky who had a large mop of unkempt dark brown hair); the rock band The Pixies (circa 1992) was played loudly in the background to our delighted surprise. The wine was incredible. The food, oh the food was divine! We ordered the side of beef which we super-sized with an option of a large piece of foie gras and gosh, we are so glad we did! How happy we are to have dined at Kitchen Galerie. How happy I am to have celebrated my birthday at such a lovely and memorable restaurant. I fell in love with my boyfriend all over again while sipping French wine, nibbling on buttery côté de buf and savoring truffled mashed potatoes. We are making plans to come back again soon! Be sure to call ahead for a reservation."}
{"text":"Best meal I've ever had in my life. Granted, I haven't eaten at any of those fancy Michelin-starred restaurants, so those might be better, but I can't possible imagine how. Kitchen Galerie is out-of-this world fantastic, and was the dining highlight of our honeymoon trip to Montreal.  So here's the deal. The restaurant is located a stone's throw away from Montreal's largest market. The menu changes every day based on what the chefs buy that morning. Oh, and the two chefs (and one sous-chef, at least the night we were there) are the only guys that work there. They're the maitre d's, waiters, sommeliers, bussers, and dishwashers. There's an open kitchen so you can actually see how they manage to do all of this themselves -- it's quite the sight!  Neither of us had used our French in almost a decade, so we struggled a bit with the menu. One of the chefs actually sat next to the table for a good ten minutes, explaining every detail about every dish on the menu... the origin of each ingredient, how it was prepared, etc. (He also bought us a couple of nice glasses of moscato with dessert when it found out it was our honeymoon!)  Getting into the details of of dinner won't help you much, since the menu changes so frequently. They do always have the foie gras atop a tarte tatin (goose liver on a caramel-apple tart, for the Anglophiles),  which my wife just swooned over... even I liked it, and I don't like foie gras. Our main courses, a pork chop and a seafood pot-au-feu, were simply fantastic. Our desserts, a hazelnut chocolate tarte and a creme brulee, where the perfect finale to a great meal.  I don't remember exactly how much dinner for the two of us cost. It was expensive, but not shockingly so, and I think a great value for the money. It's definitely a \"splurge\" kind of place, but well worth it.  The restaurant is a short walk from either the Jean Talon Metro station (blue and orange lines) or De Castelnau station (blue line); otherwise, it's street parking.  Any time I hear someone mention even thinking about taking a trip to Montreal, I tell them about Kitchen Galerie. While I don't usually like to repeat my vacation destinations, I might just have to head back across the border to dine here again."}
{"text":"Ça fait plusieurs fois que je viens manger au Kitchen Galerie (Le comptoir). La bouffe est délicieuse, pas chère et toujours, une belle place pour la création quand on demande un truc au hasard. J'aime beaucoup le staff  de cet endroit chaleureux et honnête. J'aime les Sandwicheries mais ça dépasse le concept et surtout leur sandwich sont créatif et j'irais même jusqu'à dire gastronomique. Très bien placé, à deux pas du Métro dans le Mile-Ex."}
{"text":"Wow.  All that I can think of is wow - what a dining experience like no other that I have ever had! We went to the Kitchen Galerie with a group of 10 for a business dinner.  To understand what it is to eat here, you have to understand the concept which is unique in my experience.  The venue is a small nondescript  store front about 6 blocks south of the Jean-Talon Metro station and holds approximately 40 people (so make a reservation!). The chefs, who are also your waiters and someliers in this open kitchen environment and who my wife referred to as \"the band of brothers\" head out every morning to the Jean-Talon farmers market to see what is available fresh that day.  From what is available, the evening's menu - which differs daily based on what is fresh - is planned. There are a few menu staples that last from night to night like the spectacular foie gras with half a dozen or more different preps - each of which are taste bud elation! One of the foie gras preps involved cooking it in a dishwasher! No joke! Between the 10 of us, we sampled virtually every menu item for the night. Not a single member of our party was disappointed. Everything was exceptionally prepared from the pan fried scallops, the filet of dore to the 1.5kg filet of beef for two (sit across from your sharing partner - the plate is huge!). You must save a bit of room for dessert which shouldn't be difficult as I am convinced that there is a separate stomach for desserts when they are as good as those at the Kitchen Galerie! The wine list is second to none and the service was spectacular, being friendly and informative. Our chef/waiter/somelier Matt made everyone feel like a very honored guest.  After reading this you might think that you would have to break the bank to eat here but that is not the case. Every item was very fairly priced including the wine. Whether you live in Montreal or are just visiting the Kitchen Galerie should be on your list of the finer places to dine!"}
{"text":"I came here on a Wednesday night with my boyfriend and two cousins. The restaurant was packed. We came for the MTL a table menu ($31).    I had the bloody Caesar which was just a regular boring Caesar. I wouldn't recommend it.   My boyfriend and cousins had the beef tataki starter with sour cream, basil, spicy honey and marinated vegetables. It was not that great. The crunchy stuff on it surprisingly made it worse. I personally didn't like the combined taste of the carrots with the beef tataki.  I had the foie gras starter which was an additional $7.I enjoyed this dish but I am obsessed with anything foie gras. It came with bread and caramelized onions.  As a main, my boyfriend had the homemade gnocchi with confit garlic cream, spinach, and mozzarella Di Buffala. It was very rich and very flavourful. That was my favorite main of the night. My cousin and I both had the salmon tartare with caviar, candied lemon, and arugula salad. The tartare was good and a bit creamy. My other cousin had the braised pork shoulder from with brussels sprouts and bacon, and homemade mashed potatoes. I liked that they separated the leaves of the brussel sprouts. The portions of the gnocchi and the pork shoulder were huge!! My cousin had trouble finishing the pork. The pork was good and my cousin fully enjoyed it. I felt like it really needed to be eaten wit the sauce and the sides because I had a piece of the pork on its own and I felt it was a bit dry.   My cousin and I had the chocolate crémeux with white chocolate mousse and roasted almonds. I enjoyed this dessert and thought it was the better one out of the two. My boyfriend and my other cousin had the organic apple pie and caramel mousse and they felt that was the better one of the two. To each their own.   Went to Kitchen Galerie because my cousins went for the MTL en lumiere menu which consisted of seafood and foie gras and they absolutely loved it!! I felt the MTL a table was just ok. The portions were good though. I think I would give this restaurant another chance and I would go back for the MTL en lumiere menu if they have it again."}
{"text":"We had pan seared foie gras in half shelf oyster, foie gras over braised ribs, sea bass with wild mushroom. It was delicious and we could even choose our price. I couldn't remember the rest of the menu because our seating area was in the corner and just too hot. The noise in the enclosed corner was so amplified and loud. I just wanted to get out.  I gave 4 stars just because of the heat. The derive was great and the staffs were energetic."}
{"text":"Il s'agit définitivement de mon restaurant préféré à Montreal, j'appelle chacune de mes visites un orgasme gustatif !!! Si vous aussi vous en voulez un, courrez vite au Kitchen !!!"}
{"text":"In my fish dish that came with asparagus, I loved that they peeled the asparagus, which made it extremely tender. The overall taste for both our dishes were spot on. The food was fantastic and the service was wonderful.We found that the specials of the day appeared much more interesting than what was on the menu. They've catered for our yearly convention and I always found their food creative and tasty. I'm happy to discover the restaurant itself and would be happy to return again for various occasions."}
{"text":"Excellent service, suggestion de vin pour accompagner le repas qui était parfait. Qualité de la nourriture et de la présentation super. Le choix de plats est par contre un peu court... Portions généreuses à un prix raisonnable. Réservez: la salle est petite."}
