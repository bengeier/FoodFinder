{"text":"Excellent! Shadyside's been needing a good coffee shop, and Adda fits the bill. This place is super inviting, nice tables and intriguing books and stuff, and the baristas (a knowledgeable crew from some of the city's other great places incl. Commonplace) are both skilled and kind. Had a delicious Verve-roasted Ethiopian espresso, and they do Chemex as well which I'll try next time I'm there. They do have wifi and ~8 tables, so I'd try working there too; not sure if it will start to fill up."}
{"text":"My matcha latte and vegan protein muffin were both excellent. Definitely will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Awesome espresso, coffee, and tea selection.  The cold brew is also fantastic.  Great aesthetic.  I have yet to find a single thing wrong with the place!"}
{"text":"Went to Adda on a Saturday afternoon for their high tea. They had a nice variety of teas and the food that was served was exquisite. I tried three different types of tea and enjoyed them all. For the food we were served scones with cream, vegan pea puree on toast (turkey sandwiches for non-veg), quiche, apple turnovers, pecan nut bar, and lemon shortbread. 

The quiche was absolutely amazing, it had just the right consistency of light and savory. The sweet items paired as really nice finger foods to go along with the tea. I did not have a single item that I didn't enjoy. The pea puree on toast was nice because it was something different.

Overall wonderful experience, only thing that was slightly odd was that the high tea was overbooked so we had to share our table (reservation of two) with another reservation of two so it wasn't exactly a private experience. I wished I had been notified of this policy while booking just so it wasn't sprung upon us after arrival."}
{"text":"Very great atmosphere to sit and enjoy a cup of coffee. The windows are large and the daylight coming in makes you feel happy to be there. Great menu options, I like the matcha green tea latte. 

However, it is kind of difficult to find a place to park, and sometimes seating is all full. I think there is space for a few more tables, I wish they would add some more tables to work at. If it is all full, there is usually space to sit on a cushioned bench by the window, but it is a hassle to hold your coffee cup/plate while sitting there. Other than that, this is a special place to get some specialty coffee drinks!"}
{"text":"Stopped in this week during soft opening. Got a drip coffee, it was an excellent brew from Verve.  Excited to try their tea.  

Love the decor and vibe, a welcomed addition to the community!"}
{"text":"We came here on a Saturday afternoon. The atmosphere was good; however there were not too many seats in the shop so we had to take the sofa area beside the wall.
We ordered the mojito green tea and the matcha latte. The flavor was not impressed, but I'm willing to try other drinks if we get a chance to come next time.
Service was good and the baristas were nice too."}
{"text":"Great little coffee shop to stop at in Pittsburgh. Ginger tumeric latte (with soy milk!) and ricotta honey toast were both amazing! I was surprised how well frothed the soy milk was, and the flavor of the spices was powerful. The toast was a simple flavor pairing that was exactly what I wanted at the time, especially with my flavorful beverage. Will stop by here again next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"We had a matcha latte, a chai latte, a machiato and a shortbread. The cafe has great aesthetic appeal and has some darling ideas revolving around community, +100 for that. Those details and the name (because I'm Bengali) attracted me here. Even though we were all craving caffeine really bad, our drinks were disappointing. You'll like the macchiato if you're a coffee snob like me. The chai latte was too milky, the shortbread was too sugary and some baristas were more inviting than others."}
{"text":"I love the vibe of this place, the coffee is great and the food is good too. The decor is bright, friendly and relaxing. The seating situation, however, is a disaster! There are not enough seats or tables and the fact that people can make seating reservations online means that people who are already seated get kicked out! I wouldn't recommend coming here if you need to spend some time doing work, the chances of not getting a seat are pretty high."}
{"text":"A neat, bright, and cozy place. The baristas are friendly. I had an Americano as I always have for my first visit to a new coffee shop, and Adda has a good one. It's also a good place for working, reading, and hanging out with friends. I am interested in their high-tea, will plan my second visit then."}
{"text":"Corky staff & overall feel. I'd feel comfortable spending lots of time at this place, and wish I could do just that. Prices are a little steep, but man, I love everything I order!"}
{"text":"Spiced mocha latte is fantastic, beautiful latte art too. Lots of good seating, bright and airy space, and free Wi-Fi."}
{"text":"Super! I only ordered a latte, but they have a full espresso bar and tea menu as well as some baked goods, chocolate bars, and the like. They also have some creative 'house specialty' espresso and tea drinks (see the pics of the menu - that will do a much better job of describing that.)

The latte was great! The shot was pulled perfectly ... not bitter or 'burn-y' at all. The froth/foam was great also; it was enough to notice and enjoy (that happens to be my favorite part of lattes). Note that I had regular milk, not almond, soy, or coconut; YMMV with those. 

The atmosphere is nice. It has a \"lived in\" feeling and somewhat eclectic decor without looking junky or cluttered. There were plenty of folks of all ages socializing and working on laptops, etc. 

The staff was very friendly, however I didn't ask for anything out of the ordinary. 

All-in-all, 5 stars. If you've been thinking of checking it out, you won't be disappointed. I will be returning."}
{"text":"This coffeeshop is for true coffee connoisseurs. My first time here, I got the street level espresso. They served the coffee on a wooden tray with a cup of sparkling water to cleanse your pallette and a tiny biscotti for afterwards. Definitely don't feel intimidated by getting espresso. The atmosphere of the place is really nice too. I brought my work and stayed until closing time. When I went, it was pretty quiet and the music in the background was soothing.

I know I'll be coming back!"}
{"text":"I visited this shop for the first time today; for so long I drove or walked by always noticing it's charm. Equipped with my laptop, I was able to secure a bar seat with a nearby outlet around 11am. I ordered the cold brew with cream and an apple cinnamon scone. Both were delicious; the scone was very soft and the cold brew was nice and bold. By time 11:30am hit, there was a rush of people and a line. I later discovered that a group was meeting in the back. You can book a table for 2-4 people or the back of the cafe for a larger group up to 40. I love this! My one piece of dissatisfaction comes from the inability to connect to the wifi. There were 3 potential networks; none of which seemed to work so I ended up using my phone as a personal hotspot. It's almost an expectation by patrons to have reliable wifi that's easy to connect to at a coffee shop. Will I come back? Yea, I really enjoyed my coffee and the vibe. Hopefully, the wifi is having a better day when I do."}
{"text":"Quickly visited this past Friday before visiting the Phipps garden. Luckily found street parking nearby. Went in at about 3:00pm and it was still pretty busy, the only seats to be found were on the couch area. 

Note: Every table seemed to be occupied by customers using laptop's which is fine but then many occupied many 2 person or larger tables with only one person which is a huge coffee shop pet peeve of mine. Maybe limit laptop customers of 1 to the stool area? 

Regardless, only ordered two cappuccino's for there and they were very pretty. I believe they use Verve coffee and the taste was to be expected for the quality beans used. If anything they were a tad more on the warm than hot side but that usually happens quickly when coffee is poured into the cold ceramic cups. 

Would highly recommend if in the Pittsburgh area, they had a couple baked goods which looked quite appetizing and a decent amount of space for a city coffee shop."}
{"text":"Trendy, fun coffee shop and a perfect place to study or catch up with friends! Try the cold brew!"}
{"text":"I like this place. They're a little pretentious in general, but without the baristas who judge and glare at you regardless of what you do like in some other places. Instead the baristas are consistently friendly and down to earth, the coffee is wonderful (especially the cappuccinos - they have real cappuccinos with correct proportions), and the food, particularly the scones with the clotted cream, are to die for."}
{"text":"I stopped in randomly and stayed for a coffee and a scone. Both were delicious. I found the decor a little strange... almost felt like I was attending a baby shower. I also think they could use the space a little more wisely to fit more seats. 

Overall, the staff was friendly and it's a great addition to the South Highland line-up of businesses, but unfortunately I can't be a regular. 7 bucks for a coffee and a scone (no bigger than the palm of my hand) is just too much."}
{"text":"Tasty coffee, kind staff, nice view by the window, vintage design inside the coffee.. too many good reasons to love this cute coffee house.."}
{"text":"This place with a baby's crib room color scheme is a great relaxing place to hang out. Super friendly staff and smooth coffee, plus close to Steel City Improv's theater, and in the middle of a busy stretch of Shadyside. If I lived in Pittsburgh I'd probably drink coffee and hang out here a lot."}
{"text":"I love Adda!!! I feel so \"city\" when I have coffee here. I used to live in the city and now I don't, so I like to come here to study and have a cup of coffee/tea, scone, and clotted cream. My husband and I have never had clotted cream before. It is so refreshing and brings out the flavors in the scone. It's my new thing! The coffee itself is okay. Maybe it's the type of bean that I picked. However, the matcha chai latte was delicous!

I love that they have events, featured artists, and things that get the community involved. The featured drink of the month, I think is super cool! This month (November) the featured drink is Sermon con Panna! OMG, it reminds me of Italy! I cannot wait to go back and try!"}
{"text":"Nice addition to the Highland Ave. scene in Shadyside, and very conveniently located close to my current digs as well as my gym. It's definitely moreso on the \"quiet worker bee\" end of things than the \"chat over coffee,\" but both are acceptable. Drip coffee and cold brew are pretty good ($1 refills in store on the hot stuff), and I usually grab one of their protein muffins to go along with my drink, which are delicious and can tide me over during several hours of working. The best drink I've had here was the turmeric ginger tea--I loved that the tea came in a loose leaf diffuser with a little timer provided that the barista set, which resulted in the most lovely and perfectly steeped cup of spicy yet sweet tea that I've had in a long time. Free Wifi and lots of outlets, though space can sometimes be at a premium."}
{"text":"I went for the opening weekend of High Tea and I could not say more good things about Adda, my experience was above and beyond.  They had a wide range of unlimited teas, both hot and iced with one specialty. My personal favorites were the peach and mojito. They prepared an all vegan tea tower with lettuce wraps, toast with a perfect pea spread, and their signature power muffins.

Update:
Having a good server makes all the difference. Our 2nd visit was not as fantastic as the first."}
{"text":"One of my favorite coffee shops. The house coffee is very rich in flavor and at $2.09 (w/ tax) it's an awesome everyday fix. The tumeric latte is also super yummy, as well as the clotted cream for the scones. Great place to meet up with friends or spend a few hours catching up on work. The baristas are friendly and passionate about their work. Would recommend without reservation"}
{"text":"Awesome new coffee shop! Man did S Highland need a coffee shop, badly. Well these people nailed it. Drip coffee was bold and satisfying. The tea is loose leaf so it takes a minute to steep but my gf sipped it to the last drop so I'm assuming it's bomb. They also have small bites and treats which we sampled and enjoyed every morsel. Last, Adda is Bengali for intellectual exchange among members and this place is perfect for it! Totally recommend!!! Owner is super nice as well and staff is knowledgeable."}
{"text":"Used to be my favorite Coffee shop in Pittsburgh but I think recently it not so good as used to be in terms of food (beverages are still the same) and the price is a little high in my opinion but I still like to spend a time because their atmosphere and decoration."}
{"text":"Great place over all. Lots of light, great ambiance. The mojito iced tea is so refreshing. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We had a very pleasant visit to Adda. They served the absolute best cup of tea. The food was excellent and the service was attentive. I like that our servers focused on customers, rather than cell phones. 

The tea room was beautiful and it's a great space to read, talk or write. 

I was surprised at some of the negative reviews by friends I trust, so I hope management will try to resolve these issues quickly and fairly.

I was impressed they carried locally produced chocolate, that's a real plus."}
{"text":"I most recently visited Adda when I was looking for a quiet spot to study for a final, while enjoying a hot drink. Adda was the perfect spot. Although it's not super quiet (no coffee shops are), I was able to find a table easily (hard to come across in Shadyside during finals week) and was super cozy while I got work done & enjoyed my tea. They have tons of tea flavors and lots of great coffee drinks. They also have juice from Pittsburgh Juice Co., chocolate, pastries, and lots of other goodies. I chose the chocolate cinnamon Rishi tea- wow, was it amazing. I loved that they served it in a little mug with a timer, so that I knew when my tea was perfectly steeped. I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this coffee and tea house. They have a very unique style that I appreciated. There is a surprising amount of seating for a small independent coffee spot, however, I would imagine that it can fill up. You can also reserve a working table on their website for business meetings etc. 

I ordered an Italian macchiato. It was pretty good, not great. That being said, their plating is definitely something to rave about! They served my macchiato with a mini biscotti and a small glass of water. I was pretty impressed with how cute they made my order look. 

I will definitely be stopping by again!"}
{"text":"I've only been here once, but that was enough for them to make a great impression. Sometimes I find these types of coffee shops to be a little pretentious, but the barista here was so friendly and kind that even though we interacted for the few minutes it took him to make my drink, that was all it took to make me really like this place. I've had so many mediocre experiences at other locally owned shops when it comes to interaction with customers that Adda Coffee & Tea House really stood out to me. And of course, the coffee was also very good!"}
{"text":"Came into Adda today and it did not disappoint! The staff was very welcoming and the cappuccino and rosemary quiche was delicious. Will definitely come back for a quiet study session or morning brew."}
{"text":"Adda is adorable and the service is really friendly. This is a bright and happy coffee spot that seems like it could be a great place to study or go on a coffee date. Whenever I go to little cafes like this, I always expect to pay more for an overpriced coffee/tea/whatever and I go in knowing that. However, Adda was much less expensive than I had thought it would be! I paid a little less than $3 (with tax) for a chilled apple cider which was delicious. Prices hovered around this much for a lot of the drinks on the menu. They had a great selection of teas and coffees of all kinds, and even served Indian food! If I were in the area more often, I would love to try a lot more of the options here. Overall had a great experience and I would be back if I was looking for a tea/coffee in the area again!"}
{"text":"A nice coffee shop with a super hip vibe, which comes from both the interior decor as well as the customers who inhabit it (seriously, every time I pass by the window the people inside look so friggin' stylish). It ain't cheap, but eh, what do you expect from this kind of place.

I'm personally a tea latte person, so I can't really comment on their coffee. One thing to be aware of is that their \"matcha chai latte\" is really just a matcha latte, not some kind of chai latte/matcha latte hybrid. It was very tasty and beautifully green and foamy, but not what I thought I was paying for based on the title :P.

Also, their ginger tumeric latte comes from a carton instead of being homemade, which is disappointing. I haven't tried their chai latte yet, but I suspect it's probably the same deal. If you're getting it hot, then it might be worth it, but if you like it iced you might as well just buy a carton of the concentrate yourself, add milk, and make it at home to save a ton of money."}
{"text":"Amazing coffee, wonderful tea selection, and fantastic service. This place has it all. Their whole aesthetic is beautiful and super chill and there always seems to be plenty of seating when I'm there. Their cold brew contraption is mesmerizing as well. And maybe I'm just a coffee snob, but I like that they only put out cream if you need it (or at least they do when I'm there in the afternoon). I feel like it speaks to the quality of their coffee that not everyone feels the need to drown it in cream and sugar. The baristas are always extremely nice and obviously know their stuff."}
{"text":"This place is great! I have gone consecutive days because it offers a great place to study. It has free-wifi, a GREAT ambience, and boasts a great menu. I've gotten their scones two days in a row with the clotted cream. Delicious! 

The workers have also been very nice and keep the place very clean!"}
{"text":"I was super excited to try Adda, as Shadyside could really use more non-chain coffee/tea places.  However, in my opinion, it didn't quite measure up to the hype.

In the case of my order, I could perhaps chock this up to bad luck or just a bad match.  I ordered the blueberry iced tea, which sounded deliciously refreshing on a very warm fall day, but the flavor was just kind of flat--watered down, perhaps.  I added some Stevia and wished that they had Splenda instead, as I feel that I can very much taste Stevia in raw uses such as sweetening tea.  I chatted with my friend for almost 3 hours and left 90% of my drink behind.  However, she seemed to find her iced chai perfectly adequate or, at least, she finished it.

As for the vibe, Adda was cute, per se, but it just lacked the comfort or coziness I look for in coffee houses I like to hang out in.  There are rickety tables and chairs rather than sofas and couches or even those solid wooden chairs that characterize Starbucks (I know, I know, chain hate, blah blah, but hey, they're certainly doing something right.)  The few hours I sat at a table, I was constantly shifting and trying to get comfortable.  It never happened.  There were also quite a few flies inside, which I'm sure isn't because it's unclean or anything, but was just kind of alarming to find buzzing around my face in an eating establishment.

I'd definitely be willing to give Adda another try but I've ruled it out as a place I'd set myself up to chill with my laptop.  Still a nice addition to Shadyside, but for me, the magic is dead.  I'll bring my own Splenda next time."}
{"text":"Shadyside desperately needed a coffee shop like this.  It is a great atmosphere, staff are extremely friendly and helpful, and the coffee is delicious.  I got a cinnamon/honey latte and it was amazing.  Not too sweet, bold flavor, and the perfect temperature.  My only negative on this place is that you can only order a drink in one size and I wanted more!"}
{"text":"Although I have had yelp for over five years, this is the first place I have felt compelled enough to review. After moving on to the same street as Adda, I set out to find my new go-to iced matcha spot. This is it, and more. Serving the best iced matcha, I have had, and keep in mind my hobby is trying out every place, I decided this was going to be my favorite place. The staff and environment are very welcoming and refreshing. Getting work done, or scrolling through my phone avoiding work, this is the place for it. I enjoy this place a lot. Pictured is the \"Shadyside Sunrise- espresso, pineapple juice, on ice.\""}
{"text":"This was the first time I was here. I always drink iced lattes (whatever flavor I happen to be in the mood for).  I purchased an iced mocha. It was delicious!  It was rich with a really nice chocolate flavor. It looked like the had a wide variety of baked goods and specialty chocolates. I will definitely try something to eat my next visit. Check it out!"}
{"text":"There is a major problem here. I came in for a coffee and scone with my dad and I am left feeling extremely insulted by today's experience. Before, I knew that the baristas were not the most welcoming, but today it hit an all new level.

It was totally packed with people and one  barista was training a new girl. We ordered a coffee for my father and an orange scone for me. They were sold out of the butter, which was fine. We paid and left. Pretty normal, semi-lame, overpriced experience that I put up with for the product. I walked down the street and looked in my bag to find it was the espresso scone, so we walked back in to switch them out. The trainee was nice and switched out the scones, apologizing. But when the \"experienced\" barista saw my father come back in, she made a mean joke about him that she believed only the other barista was supposed to hear. 

I am disappointed because I went to a really wonderful event here only last month. I met the owner and he explained how the name of his coffee shop meant community gathering. He desperately wanted it to be a place where people could hang out and mingle and have a nice experience. I feel awful that my experience is pretty much the exact opposite of the feeling he is trying to convey. The drinks and food are good, but he went to great lengths to explain that he cares less about the drinks than he does about the atmosphere. He very much needs to hire nicer, warmer people. I am never coming back here again."}
{"text":"Adda had some really interesting latte options (like a ginger tumeric latte, matcha chai latte), so I would love to go back when I am feeling adventurous.  (Their pastries and cookies looked tempting as well.)  This time, I got their cinnamon latte, which was really good.

It's a relatively large coffeeshop.  I went there to chat with a friend, but there were people by themselves with computers or books, so it seems like a good place to get some work done as well."}
{"text":"Coffee was alright. Ordered a Matcha latte that didn't compare to ones I'd had previously. Was a little disappointed that there wasn't much seating and that the high tea tables in the back were sectioned off when no one was using them. I'd go back for a quick coffee with a friend but wouldn't recommend for a working space."}
{"text":"I started coming to Adda since its opening last year, and have visited multiple times per week ever since. It's my go-to place to get some work done, since it's usually pretty quiet during the weekdays and has really good WiFi. Their drip coffee is *the best* in Pittsburgh - I've been to all the coffee shops around Pittsburgh and this is not a misrepresentation. The baristas are all very nice and good at what they do, and would eventually remember who you are if you are a frequent customer.

Adda gets quite busy during the weekends, so if you are looking for a spot to get work done over the weekend, you might want to head there early or go somewhere else. Otherwise, it's the perfect neighborhood coffee shop with the best cup of coffee in town.

Other notes: try the quiche and the scones (with clotted cream)! They're nice little snacks that are quite filling."}
{"text":"Adda is a wonderful place to get a quick coffee or do some work. When I stopped in on a Wednesday around 9am, there were plenty of people quietly working on their computers. I was happy to hear Sufjan Stevens' new album playing softly in the background.

I was immediately greeted by a very friendly and unassuming barista. I got a drip coffee to go. Could this be one of the most delicious cups of drip coffee I've ever had? I think so! It's that good!

Keep an eye on their Facebook page for upcoming events. They've recently hosted a bonsai tree exhibition, an Ethiopian coffee ceremony, and sushi pop up."}
{"text":"Delightful! Clean, bright, modern and yet casual. The vegan snacks (pea purée on toast; chia pudding w/cherries & coconut) were inspiring such that I will try to replicate them at home! (And I'm not even vegetarian, but certainly vegan-friendly.) the coffee & tea specialty drinks are inventive & interesting if you want to try something different, but pure simple coffee & tea are well presented too.  Glad we stopped in before heading home on a long drive."}
{"text":"I've been to so many good coffee shops as of late, that I can't tell if Adda even impressed me. Ok, it did. Intellectually, I was very impressed. But emotionally, Adda is just another very nice coffee getting place. But then again, this is Pittsburgh, not LA, and the quality that it is puts it in the top 3 or 5 in the city. So cheers, you guys. 

They use Verve coffee, which is nice, in case you needed someone to tell you. They even do like Verve and have lots of supplies and chocolates and quality knickknacks (really? Yes, really) and such like for sale. Tell you the truth, Adda actually reminded me a lot of Verve itself, more than just the fact that they used the same coffee. So anyways, the place is bright and airy with blue and white abounding and -get this- polished OSB plywood. A twist on standard good design, and a welcome one. 

And for drinking; I decided to try a specialty drank this time, since I almost never try such. Ginger Turmeric Latte. It tasted like ginger. It tasted like turmeric. And it was kind of a nasty, greenish yellow color. So it was a win. I will try real coffee next time, which I can assure you won't be too long in the future. 

So Addaboys!! (I can't believe that joke hasn't been made here already. Maybe it has. I didn't check.)"}
{"text":"I received a gift card for here for Christmas. It was on my way to work so I stopped to get an iced latte. The barista was very friendly and helpful. He was attentive and quick to make my coffee. The iced latte was delicious.
I would love to go again when I'm not running late for work and rushing."}
{"text":"Lovely little place!!! So bright and airy, with a little bit of ambient noise but not too much. The barista/cashier I ordered from, Liz, answered my questions about the establishment-she helpfully told me that the charities they serve are very loosely based on what I presume the owner is interested in helping at the moment-today, it was ConPrometidos, I believe, a charity focused on encouraging development in Puerto Rico (so important considering what hell PR is undergoing). 

I'm looking at the menu, I noticed a delightful variety of type of drinks served, with the exception of coffee blends- I believe only two different bean varieties featured. Truth is, I prefer coffee in small amounts and tea over coffee-so I was delighted to see four different types of tea lattes as well as a few interesting coffee drinks (the Shadyside Sunrise-espresso, pineapple juice and sugar, served over ice). In their cooler, they sell fresh pressed juice from the Pittsburgh Juice company, which looks WONDERFUL. 

Their featured special was fascinating-a BEETROOT  latte, of all things. Hilariously enough, it had no espresso-just a mixture of beetroot powder and the milk of your choice. Of course I had to have it, with almond milk, of course. 

With the first creamy sip, I felt the subtle notes of beet and almond mix together quite well on my tongue. It had an almost calming feel, and had the slightest sweet smell to it. Unless you strongly dislike beet, I highly suggest that you try it if you enjoy trying specials, less sweet beverages, or aren't looking for a heavy coffee taste. Considering it was beet flavored, the beet taste itself was pleasantly subtle-soft, not overpowering, like you're munching on actual canned beets or beetroot. 

For now, I'll stick to this latte. I'll probably try that Shadyside Sunrise for when I need liquid energy another time! If you're ever in the area, give this place a try. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Where was this place last year?! I used to live close by, and I would've easily been a regular at this adorable, bright coffeehouse. The baristas are friendly and happy to explain the offerings - which unfortunately can't be said about all Pittsburgh cafes. Even though Adda's awfully new, you can tell they have a solid regular crowd, which speaks to the great coffee, customer service, and location. It's a tiny shop, but very quiet so it's great for getting some work done. My latte and biscotti were fantastic! I'll definitely be back here often"}
{"text":"I frequent this cafe most weekends, and the environment always puts me in a good mood by the time I leave. The presentation of the hot tea is perfect - loose leaf and the steeping is timed depending on the tea and in a big round mug. Same goes for the hot coffee drinks. They have their techniques down - great foam on the cappuccinos. 

Their scones are worth trying even if you're not a fan of scones (I'm not but I always try the interesting flavors here). They come with a side of sweet creamy/buttery spread (clotted cream I believe it is). 

This cafe hosts cool events frequently that are also educational. I attended a chocolate and coffee tasting event here where the woman who produces their chocolates (S.K. Frey - really good chocolate too! Buy a bar) talked about her chocolatier business and how chocolate is produced, and we got to try to the different coffee flavors paired with her chocolates.  Also - Adda's coffee is brewed perfectly and has distinct flavors. You won't have the problem of the coffee smelling better than it tastes here, and you'll actually tell the difference between blends. 
I hope to attend more of these in the future! 

The space isn't huge, but there are a variety of seating types (group tables, bar tables by windows, cushioned benches by the windows) for whatever you're there for. Space can be at a premium, but the times I've shared tables with people I end up engaging in conversations and having such a pleasant experience. 

The baristas are friendly and humorous and will definitely engage in conversation."}
{"text":"Adda is a contender for one of the best coffee shops in the Burgh. It's location in East Liberty is a plus because of the whole scene of the town and access to excellent food. And if you're like me, inspiration comes from the movement of the city. You get that inspiration in this coffee shop as its front windows gets you looking at S Highland Ave and it's back side windows draws you to train tracks and urban art. The ambiance is fantastic. The wood floors, white walls, and pops of teal make the inside of this shop wildly attractive. 

Ambiance is a big deal to me with coffee shops. I will gladly withstand a lack of quality of beverage if the ambiance is good enough. Luckily, with Adda you get ambiance AND quality. Their mocha is legit. Trust me. Get a mocha. You won't be sorry. 

I also have always had great experiences with the baristas here. They are conversational and you don't get any err of snootiness like you might get with other coffee shops of this quality. They're down to earth, friendly people. Thanks guys! 

I'm kind of weird in also wanting things like a little cup of water with my coffee drinks. They have that self-serve water reservoir ready for anyone who would want to partake. Excellent. 

Free wifi. Sometimes hard to connect. Can be annoying and unreliable. Be aware. 

The only couple downsides are the seating, the bathroom, and the hours of operation. There is limited seating. If you get a seat you will be perfectly happy and in pure bliss of coffee drinking/work working experience. The bathrooms aren't dirty but they are basically in the middle of the shop, which poses 2 problems . . .  

1. Depending on what happens in there you may or may not smell the aftermath (you don't want that mixing with your mocha). 

2. Depending on what happens in there and how long you take, you may or may not feel the \"all eyes are on me\" kind of feeling. 

*In a perfect world you would use the restroom and feel as though no one in the world ever noticed. 

The hours of operation are so confusing to me. Most days this shop closes at 6pm. That's just crazy, and for how good of a shop this is I almost deducted a star. But I didn't. Just please extend your hours. I don't think you'll be sorry. 

Don't let these few downsides take too much away from this place as a whole. Adda is great and I would go out of my way to go there. In fact, I have. I will. I must!"}
{"text":"Ok, folks, here is a rare 2-star review from me.  I don't usually wind up with poor reviews as I almost always check places out on Yelp first or otherwise evaluate them before trying (eg I don't often go to places I don't think I'll like).  Usually my research matches what I find, but in this case I didn't.  However, I wouldn't be quite as harsh about Adda if it weren't for the high reviews and high prices.  Both of those allow for one to be pickier and hold an establishment to high standards.

We went on a weekday morning.  At first glance it was a pretty space and the barista was friendly.  They had biriyani on the menu but didn't have any.  Instead we got this little curry roll (I forget the exact name of it) that was hard & dried out.  We also got the pea toast, which was OK.

For drinks, we got a pourover that was bitter and a special tea drink that tasted weak.  I did not take pictures of the menu that day and it's not listed on their menu online so I can't say for sure what it was.  

What I expect when I go into a coffee shop that purports to be artisan is to be wowed by the drink.  We found both to be underwhelming.  I almost never consider food to be inedible, but the pastry was.  My husband found the whole concept and set up of Adda to be pretentious.

When we walked in, we were thinking 4 stars.  While we were there, we were thinking 3 stars.  Things degraded down to just the 2 stars as we left because we just felt unsatisfied with our experience.  The more we thought about it, the more we were sure Adda had disapointed us."}
{"text":"Decent coffee and treats, but some members of the staff are rude and offensive. I overheard one of the baristas offending and making fun of a customer that'd just left the store.  The same idiot then carried on a conversation about baseball, offending Cubs fans. Obnoxious."}
{"text":"Really cute place with friendly staff. I really liked the protein muffin and ginger tumeric tea I ordered. Thank you Adda staff!"}
{"text":"I saw a lot of articles about this shop and finally had the opportunity to visit. I love the decor and ambiance. I ordered a hot lemon verbena herbal tea. It's very refreshing. I like the fact that your hot tea comes with a timer so the tea is properly steeped. I will visit again."}
{"text":"Adda is a very lovely place to meet with friends and/or hold a group meeting.  I've also learned that you are able to hold events as such as, baby showers - and this place is in my humble opinion would be a lovely spot for a baby shower. I wish one of my friends were expecting. Anywho!!!!! I enjoyed the very well lit by natural light atmosphere. The baristas are wonderful, knowledgeable, and coffee/tee enthusiasts. And that is so important when going to a coffee and teahouse. I tried a few options on the menu, the peppermint tea was the most relaxing and soothing and my most fave along with the Peppermint Tea, was the Matcha Tea. I looooove Matcha Tea and they nailed it! Also, the quiche from Bar Marc was amazing as well. FYI, they have their food menu from Bar Marco, and it is totally delicious as well. I don't get out to Shadyside often, but when I do....this will be my go to spot to get some work done, sip on tea, and enjoy the ambience."}
{"text":"Phenomenal location, friendly and welcoming baristas, good food but horrible hours. 

Ambiance: As casual and relaxed the atmosphere is, is about how causal their hours are. I leave for work before seven every morning and drink all my coffee for the day before 9 on Sundays. I'm assuming they are wanting the casual workers and college students not the early risers. Super convenient ability to save tables online if you need a study group. I genuinely would have killed for that in college. Would love to frequent, but doesn't work with my schedule. 

Food: We got their quiche (ricotta and rosemary that day) and it was phenomenal. They have rotating toast specials and I was hoping for avocado but they didn't have it. 

Coffee: Three selections of pour over coffee and I went with the Santa Clara (a Guatemalan blend) and it was unique and delicious. My boyfriends cappuccino was solid, but super interested to try their house-made flavors next time. They sell Verve Coffee but would love for that to be someplace more local."}
{"text":"I'm giving 4 stars as opposed to 3 because of the great atmosphere and nice staff. 
My drink was tasty, but definitely have had better lattes elsewhere in the city. The thing that spoiled the experience for me was the price. I ordered a soy vanilla latte. Due to lactose intolerance, I'm used to paying extra for soy milk, but a medium soy latte was almost $7.  I get the up-charge, but the prices seemed a tad too high..."}
{"text":"The atmosphere : beach house tea party
The bar seating at the front : amazingly comfortable chairs and exactly the right height leg rests conjoined to the front window. 

I worked here at times throughout 2017. For laptop use, posting up on the chairs at the window is very comfortable. Countertop available for coffee; I recommend posting the laptop on the lap.

Coffee is good; asked for decaf, got decaf pour-over or decaf americanos at the price of a standard coffee due to the rarity of the request for straight decaf drip. Friendly staff. 

Quiet atmosphere, bring headphones and work away."}
{"text":"What a delightful space. The coffee shop was open, airy, and bright. You just wanted to get tucked or settled in and work. The atmosphere just screams productivity to me. The light baby blue walls are inviting and make you want to sit down, sigh, and contemplate life. You do not feel this type of warm atmosphere in a lot of places so it was nice to feel it here. 

They have conference space in the back, and tables up front. I would say that I would wish for more table space because I can imagine that it can get crowded. The cupboards are all rough    and really interesting in the space, I liked the look of it. 

The staff is also really welcoming and educated about the products that they serve. Sometimes coffee shops can get busy and the staff just kinda shuffle you by, not here. Everyone was more than willing to stop and talk about the products and how their part in Adda is played. 

Now, a little about Adda from their website: 

Adda is a Bengali word; it means to indulge in informal or friendly conversation with a group of people, such as friends, family, or colleagues.  It also refers to the place to have that conversation.

Our aim at ADDA is to create a community space for our neighbors, local artists and innovators for relaxation, conversation, peaceful working, and warm company.

Our mission is to share a slice of the world with our community.  ADDA features and spotlights a particular region of the world every month.  Through the drinks and food we serve and the help of local artists we showcase, we aim to share the rich culture of various US regions and the rest of the world through our space.  As part of this spotlight program, we serve special coffees or teas from the region and host other cultural or educational events a few times each month.

We are also paying it forward by donating a percentage of our proceeds each month to two charities -- one local Pittsburgh-based and a second tied to the current chosen spotlight region.

Seriously, how AWESOME is that. Not only are they serving up awesome drinks but they are engaging the Pittsburgh community and the global community. I love it. Please go here if you can, this is good stuff!

Menu:

Scone: This comes with clotted cream and is really amazing. I asked for a little extra of the cream and it was no issue at all. I would get this again for sure!

Quiche Bar: YUM. I mean, I love quiche. This was really well done with a nice crispy crust and a lovely fluffy center. I would get this and not share with anyone. 

Tea:

Summer Lemon Black: This is iced tea. It was cool and refreshing I love iced tea and this was just really good tea. I liked that it was available to go or I could sit there and enjoy the cup. 

This was a fun place, I would suggest people go here! The space is open an inviting and people should try them out."}
{"text":"Such a nice little spot to enjoy a nice cup of tea or coffee! A little pricey for my liking, but still good! In the way of food I have had the quiche bar which had a great flavor (really good), scones (with the amazing clotted cream), and the toast with the ricotta and honey. 

I have tried multiple different teas here, cold and hot. I have tried the Masala Chai (an Indian tea brewed with different spices and herbs). The Peach Nectar (it's sweeter than what I am used too but still good). In the way of Iced I have tried the Summer Lemon and the Blueberry Herbal. If you know me I am obsessed with lemon iced tea so this is the one I order the most when I visit. 

Service can be spotty. Sometimes they can be super busy to the point you have to wait a while for a table and sometimes you can get your order pretty quickly."}
{"text":"Got here on a Sunday around noon to get some work done with a friend. Had to wait a bit (about 10 minutes) for two spots to open up. It's a cute coffeeshop with a light blue theme going on. 

I was intrigued by the grown up chocolate ($3) on the menu and asked what was in it. Chocolate, espresso, and sea salt. That sounded great to me and turns out it was. Note that it is not hot chocolate; it's a mostly cold drink that is also very rich in flavor. Really loved it! I had my friend try it and she loved it too. 

I also had the quiche bar ($5)--rosemary, ricotta, parmesan. The quiche was so tasty and absolutely amazing. I had to wait a while for it, but it was worth it. It was served warm and had a fluffy texture, which was great, but I think the rosemary really made the quiche what it was. I would go as far as saying it's the best quiche I've ever had probably. I wanted to devour it because it was so delicious but made myself take small bites at a time so I could savor every moment. Can't wait to come back and reorder this and the grown up chocolate! 

We were also lucky enough to come on a day where a monthly hour-long wine and cheese class took place in the back of the restaurant. That meant four free samples of wine and cheese each! The pairings were great and we got to learn a little bit from an expert.

{"text":"This place is so adorable! I love the fresh rustic decor. It smells great: bare wood and coffee. The baristas are so friendly. I had an iced tea, and it was delicious. Everything is served in real glassware (unless you're taking it to go). 

There's only one size of everything that looks to be about 12oz. The prices are approximately the same as a Starbucks small perhaps a little more. 

One caution: It's tiny! There are four tables in the front and two in the back. It was completely full at 10am on a Monday. There are a few bar stools at the window and a window bench if you don't need a table."}
{"text":"Came here in the late afternoon on a Thursday. It was a gloomy day perfect for some coffee. The store is adorable and beautifully decorated. I ordered a latte with vanilla flavoring. My friends ordered the grown up chocolate and the ginger turmeric latte. 

I was disappointed to see no latte art after seeing all the great pictures on Yelp. The latte was fine nothing special. Had to add some sugar due to it being very bitter. My friends grown up chocolate was cold which she was expecting to be warm. The ginger turmeric latte was unique but the lemon ginger flavor was very overpowering. 

Overall, we were not too impressed. Maybe I will come back when there is a different barista."}
{"text":"I'm giving this 5 stars because the concept of the place really puts it over the top.  I was able to attend a high tea with other yelp elites and am very glad I got to go.  I will say, I do not drink coffee, so I'll never be able to update you on their coffee skills, but their tea is good.  They had plenty of options to choose from, including a matcha latte that I'm bummed I didn't try (too much caffeine for me at 4 pm).  I'm hoping to make it back for a noon high tea to try some of the higher caffeine teas.  
But, like I said - the concept really gives Adda the 5 stars.  I love the idea of small, local businesses helping out other small, local businesses, and that's exactly what Adda does.  Each month, they feature a different country chosen by the owner/manager/baristas that holds significance to them.  This country is then featured in a special coffee.  It is also featured through a ceramicist that makes mugs to highlight the country and a chocolatier who makes a unique chocolate bar to highlight the country.  If that's not enough, they also feature a local artist's work in the back half of the cafe.  AND, on top of all that, they offer a meeting space for local small business owners. 
They really are doing wonderful things here for the Pittsburgh community AND they have a great selection of teas and coffees.  
You should definitely check them out."}
{"text":"I finally got to swing by Adda Coffee & Tea House and am a fan! I came a little before 9am and was able to get street parking on a Thursday, can be problematic during peak times I imagine. I was greeted immediately upon entering and ordered a drip coffee \"for here\" - there is only one size. I was asked if I wanted cream and was given a small portion on the side plus a cute metal stirrer. The coffee was VERY delicious (granted I put cream and sugar) that I'll have to bring my husband here who loves just a great cup of coffee like I do and even more so. When I was done I put my glassware into the bin they have on the side where you pick up your coffee.

It feels spacious inside esp with the white and light blue decor. It wasn't too busy - maybe less than a handful of people on laptops tho the weather was dreary - when I popped in but there was a constant stream of people getting coffee to go.

Will be back for sure and glad I do not have to trek very far for awesome coffee!!"}
{"text":"I love the fact that they focus on monthly themes and also have a good collection of books at the back. Their scones are also so good! However, their beverages and service seems to be a hit or miss. I've had mixed experiences but in general, I think you can't go wrong with their teas. The quality of their more specialty beverages on the other hand might depend on who's making it. I once had a coconut milk-based tea that was served not hot enough. My recommendation is to go for the teas- they get that right!"}
{"text":"Adda boy!!! This place rocks! Everything in Adda is unique and very healthy. From Matcha tea lattes to spicy tumeric lattes the drinks and food are all new age with a health and wellness tilt! I especially appreciated the baristas product knowledge and coffee/tea making skills. The whole place works for me!"}
{"text":"Stopped over here after a brief stop at Millie's to have another scoop of their delicious ice cream. They are located right on the cusp of the bridge road which will lead you into East Liberty. The place is very small and offers free WiFi. Today for some reason there was a problem using the \"square\" system for credit transactions. I normally carry cash in that event so I was okay.

They have desserts, espressos, lattes, coffees, and of course tea. I ordered a cup of the peach nectar tea which has a fruity taste to it. My tea is served in a glass teapot and you are given a timer to let you know when to pour it into your cup. I like that idea because there's no second guessing here. Along the walls they have artwork by a featured artist and a gender neutral bathroom.

Once the timer went off I poured my cup and it was exactly the amount if not a little more left in the pot. It was delicious but will get cold after about 10 minutes which is the norm. Still I enjoyed all of it. I was also somewhat pleased when I used the bathroom to see a shelf to put my purse. I'm glad they thought of that option because that can be a nightmare if there is no hook or any place you can put whatever you have on you to avoid the floor.

After I was done I saw their cold brew drip tower. The man behind the counter explained to me that it is used all day today in order to prepare tomorrow's coffee. In addition I asked about that lovely milk design I've seen in some of the coffees. He explained it in mathematical terms but basically that design would only work if you order a latte or equivalent.

I also asked about parking since it is very difficult to find parking in this area. He advised me against parking across the street which is a tiny strip mall because they do tow. I was parked on Alder St again in one of those limited residential permit areas. He told me that even though that sign on Alder says \"except Sundays\" if I happen to snag a spot there I would be okay. In addition metered parking is free on Sundays. Definitely want to try their coffee on a future visit."}
{"text":"Really disappointed with my experience because I've been wanting to try this place for a while. The inside is very nice, but they didn't have their special advertised drink, only have one size drink size (at least if you're trying to get it to go), and only have one roast coffee (again, at least if you're trying to get it to go). No need to go back again"}
{"text":"Aw, Adda. You are Adda-orable. The interior of this place makes me feel like I'm walking the streets of Santorini or Marrakech. The coloring of it is so calming, tranquil, and inviting! I had the matcha chai latte which I've never tried before and it was delicious. My friend had the cold brew and enjoyed it as well. We sat at the window and had a delightful visit. I'll be back here soon!"}
{"text":"I'll preface my review by saying that this review is only for the tea portion of Adda - I haven't had a chance to try the coffee yet!

I am so excited to have discovered such a lovely little tea house in Pittsburgh! The atmosphere is perfect for relaxing with a good book, enjoying a piping hot cup of tea, and just watching the world go by outside. The space is very warm and inviting. I love that all of snacks are made at Bar Marco; it's always nice to see local businesses team up! When it comes to the tea, there are plenty of options. It's presented to you on a handsome little wooden platter with a timer so that you know how long to let it steep. I tried the hibiscus herbal tea, and my friend tried the peppermint. We were both very happy with our choices! 

Another great thing about Adda is that they do a high tea, which I think would be so fun for a birthday or even just a girl's day out. I haven't had a chance to try the high tea, but I've heard great things about it and I think it's pretty unique for the city of Pittsburgh. If you enjoy a good cup of tea, you definitely need to check Adda out soon!"}
{"text":"This is a cute little coffee shop on Highland! It was a nice place to study on a weekday, but I'd imagine it getting pretty crowded on weekends since there isn't very much seating. They had a large drink menu with plenty of interesting bites to eat as well. I've only had a latte, but definitely want to come back to try to matcha latte at some point. I also tried the toast with mashed peas on top but was not a fan. However, I still enjoyed my overall experience and would still stop back in!"}
{"text":"Adda is a neat little coffee and tea shop with a good selection of teas, as well as creative speciality drinks and snacks. I tried a merlot caramel cappuccino ($3.45, 8 oz) which was just the thing to warm up with after a walk. Adda is probably a little pricier for Pittsburgh, but not as expensive as similar shops I've seen in Portland with $6-7 lattes - plus the baristas here today were very friendly and helpful. It might not be the best place for working since there aren't too many tables, but it's worth stopping by to grab drink to go."}
{"text":"Adorable and absolutely charming new coffee shop in the heart of Shadyside! Debuting only a few weeks ago, the cafe already seems to be a hit with locals. To test out new waters, I ordered the simple drip coffee. Such a bold, rich flavor paired with the right amount of bitterness. I was pleasantly surprised because it was one of the best tasting coffees I've experienced in Pittsburgh! I also fell in love with the cool yet relaxing ambiance of the shop. I don't know about you but sitting in a coffee shop is slightly therapeutic to me. All I need is a good book with a cup of Adda coffee and I might never leave!"}
{"text":"Pleasant, small coffeeshop. I wasn't particularly wowed by the matcha latte, which they describe as their specialty--not bad, just not the best I've had. The other drinks seem to be a bit better. They keep the music fairly quiet so it is nice for socializing or studying."}
{"text":"What a great addition to the area. I loved everything about this place! I had a grown up chocolate milk, which was delicious chocolate milk with a shot of espresso on top. mmm mmm. They even have a dessert coffee drink made with Millie's ice cream, so I'll be back to try that for sure. 

The inside is clean and welcoming and would definitely be a place I'd choose to meet a friend, or do some work Independently. It's not huge inside, maybe 4 tables in the front and 2 in the back. But they have stools and benches along the window areas for additional seating as well. The staff was so friendly and knowledgable too."}
