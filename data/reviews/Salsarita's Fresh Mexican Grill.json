{"text":"Sitting here as I write. Nachos were great as usual and the service  sucked as usual also. Suddenly the employees are required to leave their personalities elsewhere. Not a single person showed any interest in being there. Profits are bound to be on the rise due to the minuscule portion and it was like having teeth pulled to get extras, which we made clear paying isn't a problem. Lucky for them the dish was great and this will not be a deterrent against us returning. Hopefully someone in their management team will at least take a serious look at making smiling and interactive service part of the routine as it was a few years ago."}
{"text":"The steak was ridiculously bad. Chicken was OK. The salsa was so cold it made my whole taco seem like they pulled it out of the fridge. My 7 year old summed it up saying \"This tastes like poop!\""}
{"text":"Love this Salsaritas. Yes it is a chain, the food is the same, but the management is wonderful and they do what they can to make you happy. Quality is always very good!  Love their outdoor patio. We have brought our dogs many times when we have house showings because they are always welcome. Located near a Petsmart so it makes sense!   We also like getting to go chips, queso, and salsa as easy sides for parties."}
{"text":"I love Salsaritas and have eaten at different ones around Charlotte (and the airport!) but the one at Steele Creek never fails to disappoint. Every time I leave I vow to never return. My beef: the portions are so small and it is not exactly cheap for fast food Mexican. Today's steak serving on my taco salad was about 1-2 ounces - about 7 small pieces. Two salads (ordered without shells). Extra charge for adding guacamole. Spent $25 for two salads, two ice teas and a side of chips and salsa and my husband left still hungry. We are done...will go somewhere else for our Mexican fix."}
{"text":"Worse place ever! These are college kids that burn the food or do not cook it right. They don't pay attention to your order either. It is gross! If I could give them less then one star I would!"}
{"text":"Fresh ingrediants, good quality, good value and fast,  friendly service. Is it the most authentic? No, for that go elsewhere. But if you want fast, good quality, Mexican flavors then this is your spot. Ben, who I assume is a manager or supervisor, was fantastic to deal with!"}
{"text":"Very delicious. The lines are super long if it's during. My favorite was the burrito bowl. They have some variety As well which is a good thing."}
{"text":"Disappointed. I've eaten here 3 times and every time I've experienced the same; monotone employees and food not prepared."}
{"text":"Had a sloppy egg/bacon breakfast with what they called 'guacamole'. I have not had the chance to eat their main dishes."}
{"text":"Food quality review only:  I heard form a few coworkers that this place was pretty good so I decided I would give it a try. On this past Tuesday I ordered the 2 taco combo with Queso for my chips. I had chicken, cheese, guacamole, and corn salsa on my soft shell tacos. I ordered it to go and when I got back to work which is only like 5 mins away I sat down to take m 1st bite.   The chicken was not good. No seasoning and it was very very burned and pretty much blackened. It's was in eatable by all means. The the corn salsa was nothing to be excited about either. The guacamole what perfect on its own and the Queso was fantastic. So all in all I guess I should had order chips with a side of guacamole and Queso as my meal because the rest was pretty gross.   I won't be eating here again."}
{"text":"Salsarita's is a great option for great tasting tacos, burritos, quesadillas, and enchiladas. The atmosphere is a lot of fun, too!"}
{"text":"This is a typical Salsarita's. Very, very busy at lunch but they are fast. It's convenient to a large office park with few close food options. The problem with this location is I'm always overcharged and my guess is many others are as well. It's only .30- $1.00 each time but that adds up when they are serving hundreds of guests each lunch. They are so busy and they keep the line moving well. The problem is the cashier has already added a beverage and entered your order in the register by the time you arrive. With your order already in the register you can't verify the add-ons that were entered. Every time I get my receipt, I've been overcharged for something. Again not much but I'm annoyed today cause I'm sure this happens to a lot of customers that don't pay attention. This location is busy enough at lunchtime that the few cents per customer really adds to their bottom line."}
{"text":"Yuck. Yuck. I've been craving quesadillas but these were not good. I got shrimp and chicken. Food was not seasoned and tastes old. Employees were friendly. Chips are gross and un salty. They just throw them in the bag. Salsa tasted like water \"/ Disappointed. Next time I'll have to take the drive to Charlotte for decent quesadillas!"}
{"text":"I've visited this location many times with friends. I'm not a huge fan of their food to begin with, but this location is convenient. Recently, I went in wishing to purchase a kids quesadilla. No I'm not a child, but their small quesadilla was more money than I wanted to spend and more food than I wanted to eat. I was told since I was not 12 or under, I could not purchase this meal. I think this is absolutely stupid. I'm giving you money for food why does it matter how old I am? How do you know I wasn't buying it for a child? I also find this a lie because 2 days prior when I was eating at this location with friends, my friend ordered and received a kids quesadilla...and she is older than me. I will not be purchasing anything for this location in the future due to these \"rules\" and clearly lies told by the staff. Not only did they lose my sale that day, they lost my business for life.  A friend of mine just ate at this location today and ordered a kids quesadilla. This place needs to get their policies straight."}
{"text":"Service is always good.   Staff is usually always friendly.   Today the chips are stale.    Restaurant ran out of ice tea one hour and 15 minutes before closing and the manager REFUSED to make more.   Guests were not able to get refills.   VERY VERY DISSAPPOINTED"}
{"text":"Das Restaurant ist im Atrium des Flughafens von Charlotte gelegen. Es gibt genügend Sitzmöglichkeiten. Die Preise sind in Ordnung.   Mein bestellter Hähnchen-Burrito war gut belegt und durch das freundliche Personal schnell zubereitet. Von einem normal großen Burrito kann man durchaus satt werden."}
{"text":"Very disappointed that they stopped giving the $2.00 off meal if you filled out the customer servey online.  That was one of the reasons why we would choose this palce to begin with!  Other than that, they have great food, and the service is always great!"}
{"text":"This place is a quick, simple and easy place for lunch or dinner. It isn't comparable to a true Mexican sit down restaurant, as it's just a quick place to have a taco, burrito, or salad so you have to go in with those expectations. The food is pretty good for the type of place it is. I love the queso dip and chips, and typically get a chicken burrito which is always ridiculously big and full of great toppings. The employees are always very friendly also, which makes the place even more enjoyable."}
{"text":"Showed up and told the manager that I would like to request my order be \"to-go\" .. He was extremely rude and started saying no you have to eat it here... As a manager or whatever this older gentlemen 40-50.. He should know that in customer service you treat everyone with respect.. Whether he was trying to be funny or not .. It was not a pleasant experience. Very disappointed and will avoid this location at all costs due to his lack of professionalism and the food was below average. Ordered three tacos and a burrito. The shrimp sitting in the displayed looked like it had been there for days."}
{"text":"I've been to other locations and ALWAYS had a decent experience.  I went to this location three times and all three were terrible.  I finally contacted someone at the company and got the scoop.  This place WAS a franchise but was so poorly run with so many complaints that it was taken over by the mothership.  If you go, note the business cards as you check out.  Both are from parent company executives.  There's a reason.  They are STILL not getting it right.  Employees and management there are more concerned with getting you through the line quickly (even when they are not busy) than in listening to what you want or don't want on your order, or making sure you have a good experience.  Food was excessively greasy, salty and lacking in other flavor.  Very disappointed all three visits and won't be going back to this location."}
{"text":"I realize this is a new location for Salsarita's so I will try to overlook some of the disappointments we had at our first visit about a week ago. The staff was friendly, but sadly, most were not trained properly and had no idea what they were doing. Our order was taken by the nice girl at the first station, but the 2 gentlemen that followed her (that were supposed to fill the orders) were poorly trained. My dish and chips were given to the customer ahead of me and I was skipped entirely. The 1st girl saw the problem and did her best to explain to her fellow employee, but he didn't get it. Finally at the register, we reiterated what we had ordered so she could collect the missing items and we were still given the wrong things. Anyway, we were hungry so we sat down to eat and the food was COLD. Very cold. There were kids running through the place, bumping loudly into unused chairs and generally making a lot of disturbance. Nothing was said to the parents by anyone. It was clearly bothersome to us and several other customers in the dining room. I will give them a few more weeks to get some training and experience and I will go back and let you know if it's improved any.   Also didn't like the fact that they wanted to charge us an extra $1 for cheese sauce for the burrito. I declined after I was told that. It seems excessive."}
{"text":"I bought a large cheese dip today and it tastes terrible. It's a light brown color and tastes like it's been reheated, maybe several times. Yuck, my daughter was really looking forward to it. What a waste if money! It's not cheap either. I'd take it back if it wasn't so far away."}
{"text":"I love this particular Salsaritas location. They have recently renovated this shopping center, and this Salsaritas is in a new space in it. Great layout, burritos are delicious and the ingredients seem fresh, staff is super friendly and welcoming. The have one of those new Coke machines where you can mix your own flavors of soda. And best, for those of us with kids, it is very kid- friendly.   Best burritos in Charlotte are Phat Burrito in South End, but for a small chain and if you're in South Charlotte and don't want to head to South End, this is great. Plus easier with kids than Phat Burrito and cleaner."}
{"text":"Yummy Mexican. I had a burrito bowl with chicken, black beans, pick, cheese, cilantro, and jalapeños. It was a ton of food. I also ordered the chips and queso. I like how thing the chips are but I didn't love their queso. They have good sweet tea and coke machine that gives a bunch of options. Easy to access from the parking lot."}
{"text":"Just a note about the WORST service I have ever had at any of your locations and why I will NEVER go to Salsarita's again:   I am a vegan so I loved the fact that I could always get something fresh and good at Salsarita's. Whether I was by myself or with my family, I most generally get the same thing every time. Tonight I went to the Rivergate Location, was immediately happy to see that it wasn't busy. In fact, there was just one couple in front of me.  I ordered my food, then proceeded to the register. I was going to the movie tonight so I made sure I had plenty of time. I stood at the register for literally a minute to two minutes before the guy acknowledged me standing in front of him. He stood there throwing paper balls on the floor, telling one of the other associates that he was going to make him sweep it up.  I read his badge, it said \"Mr. Long\". I remember thinking to myself, \"Really? What is going on with this guy? I know he sees me standing here.\" Then he finally rings me up. I paid, but asked him if the prices had gone up. The price he gave me was two dollars more than it is normally. It was just two dollars, but I still wanted to know. He began to speak in a condensing manner, adding it all up as if I were five years old. I waited him to finish and said to him that was the issue. Everyone else, including management usually rang my meal up as a combo. \"They are not supposed to! he yelled at me.  Again, I found myself wondering what the deal was. I told him, \"ok ok...no problem, I will just talk to the manager about it.\" Then his face changed and he said \"Who did you talk to?!?!\" (At this point, it really seemed as if he was insinuating that I was lying.)  I walked over to the drink machine to get my drink. Turned to him, \"Sir, you guys are out of ice.\" No reply. I repeated myself, \"Sir, you guys are out of ice.\" This time I could see that he was pretty much ignoring me due to fact that his was busy with what appeared to be reading and replying to text messages on this cell phone.\" Third time I slightly raised my voice, \"SIR!, you guys are out of ice.\" This time he acknowledged me and yelled for someone else to get the ice.  As a former retail manager....and as a former restaurant manager as well....this is completely unacceptable as customer service.  It is not a matter policy. Again I could care less about the two dollar difference. It is about the service and the experience. The first strike was him playing with the paper balls at the register and ignoring me. The second strike was the condensing manner in which he spoke to me and the insinuation (whether perceived accurately or not)that I was lying. Lastly, the third strike having to darn near beg for ice. It was almost as if it was too much of a hassle to service me.  Salsarita's will never EVER have to worry about me, my family, or any of my friends returning to Salsarita's at any location"}
{"text":"Fast Fresh healthy Mexican food. Atmosphere is themed well. A great place for a quick bite."}
{"text":"Under new management and it's not the same.  Very slow service at lunch today and they weren't even busy.  Quality not as good and the staff isn't  very friendly.  I imagine they changed the old staff and management for a reason but it doesn't seem to be for the better from a customer stand-point."}
{"text":"Mitch Osborne and his staff are so friendly and make you feel so welcomed.  Very polite and great service.  Cotswold was not the closest location to me but wanted a change.  So glad I decided to give them a try.  I will be back.  Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"I definitely recommend this place. It's as close to authentic that you can get. The salsas/sauces and Queso are really good. You get so much for a reasonable price!!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has gone downhill in recent months. Rice has hard pieces in burritos. This happened in 3 recent visits. My kids and I don't like that. Salsa is still pretty good."}
{"text":"I LOVE Salsarita's...but this location is falling into disrepair. The tables are filthy, our last trip there both stalls in the woman's bathroom were broken, there were flies swarming the food bar. All the employee's seemed miserable and inconvenienced. And we had to ask for...and then wait 20min for the poquito that comes with the kids meal for our son. This is not acceptable for Rivergate and I'll gladly drive somewhere else or go to another location before consuming food in that filth."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Salsaritas location in South Charlotte because of its location and parking.  I find myself making regular stops for takeout on my way home from work, especially on Saturdays.  I think that Salsaritas beats similar competitors by leaps and bounds.    The food is always fresh and colorful and flour tortillas are always steamy and soft, never dry and hard.  They have the best seasoned corn chips, the perfect companion to the best guac and pico de gallo. Portions are always generous without being too much.  Have fun custom blending Coca-Cola products from the new beverage dispensers that I have found in the stores!  I am partial to raspberry lemonade!"}
{"text":"I was informed recently that there was a change in ownership. Salasarita's USE to be good, customer service was great and the food portions were actually worth the money. Now, the portions got smaller as the prices went up, floors and tables are incredibly dirty. Not to mention they are extremely over staffed."}
{"text":"For a Mexican restaurant it's amazing how much salt they use on their chips and most of their meats that they prepare. The parking is just okay at this establishment it may take you I will find a spot. I recommend the chicken nachos loaded up with a bunch of good stuff."}
{"text":"New, clean, and fresh.  Located in a strip mall right by the airport.  If you are staying by the airport it is a great spot to grab some Mexican.  I went with the 3 Taco combo.  I like all the options for the different meat choices.  You aren't limited to just beef or chicken.  I went with the pulled pork and ground beef.  It is comparable to a Chipotle with all the options and fresh ingredients.  The frozen margaritas are a nice touch!  One thing I'm huge on is cleanliness.   You could probably eat off the floor at Salsaritas.  They close a bit early during the week (8 oclock).  We were the last people for the night and they let us hang out while they were closing up.  I watched the worker take off each fountain faucet and clean it off.  Excellent!  To many businesses neglect fountain stations and the mildew they can grow.  A+."}
{"text":"Their service is always friendly no matter what time or day of the week I go.  Chicken is just ok. Pork is juicy. Haven't tried the shrimp or steak. Want to try shrimp next."}
{"text":"WHO IS IN CHARGE!!!!! I just got back from vacation and thought I was having lunch at my favorite Mexi spot today AND boy was I WRONG. New management....  what is wrong.. there was a black man talking too aggressive to the worker and after too long I just left. I'll have to find another spot...  I hope the lady is OK I felt so,bad for her."}
{"text":"This place blows!! Food tasted like pure shit in a bowl. Would rather starve all day then eat at this shitty joint."}
{"text":"Our office wanted a Mexican buffet, but for an 11:00 am lunch.  I called this location and talked to Jeff several times about the menu and the need to have it ready by 10:15 so I could bring it back and setup for the early lunch.  Jeff was very accommodating and worked with me to make it happen.  Our team enjoyed the good food.  Many thanks to Jeff and the team at this location."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in the quality of service and the quality of food. My wife ordered the shrimp bowl and there was no shrimp. We had to ask them to make shrimp and they acted like it was a bother. They brought the bowl out with no rice or beans. Food was dry and The staff seemed to not care"}
{"text":"Had to eat here in a pinch - the place was filthy and the options are very limited. Would not go back!"}
{"text":"I have reviewed Salsarita on Yelp before, I didn't want to review this location again but I have to share this experience. Today I fell flat on my bum in Salsarita, other patrons had to help me up because I hit my back on the concrete ground. The floor was extremely slick and no member of the staff helped me. I went to the counter to tell the staff it was slick and I had just fell and they told me thanks and turned away to check out the next patron. I couldn't believe they did not ask if I was ok or send someone to clean the area. I'm disappointed in the management and training of this location."}
{"text":"The Charlotte airport is awesome so I definitely didn't want to just grab Burger King or Sbarros during my layover but I didn't have enough time to try a restaurant.  I quickly whipped out my yelp app and found Salsitas.    The line was excruciatingly slow because the woman making the burritos had no idea what she was doing.  While on line, I had to painstakingly watch her make burrito after burrito because she kept overstuffing them until the tortilla broke & she had to start over again.  OMG was that frustrating.  Being optimistic, I thought she would get the hang of it for my burrito but NOPE.  I sadly watched my giant burrito break but luckily she got it the second time.  Having wasted 40 minutes watching her break burritos, I raced over to my terminal & my hangry self attacked the burrito.  Super disappointing!  It was not good and for the reviewers who said it was similar to Chipotle -- you are dead wrong.  In fact, you need to check your tastebuds.   It didn't taste fresh, chicken wasn't flavorful, wasn't warm, and was pretty much a huge faux-Mexican mess in a fragile tortilla.    Honestly, I wish I just went to Burger King.  Also if you're looking for seating just walk down to the next section of fast food stalls.  They're the less popular options & the seating areas aren't as crowded."}
{"text":"This place used to be good until I noticed how gross it is, let me explain my self. I'm not sure if the employees here are trained well, if they were then they  should know that when they are preparing food they should not touch their clothes or face or cleaning products and so on. Their prep station is messy the employees do not change gloves between customers.  I have seen an employee grabbed a day and cleaned an area with the gloves she is wearing and went back to the line prepping for the next customer, gross. The rag they use is the rag used your clean tables and prep  area  ,you can literally smell  the table that smells like a dried wet dirty rag, gross almost armpity scent. They sweep the floor while you are eating ,omgosh  I hate that so much. You do know when they sweep they are moving all kinds of dust allergens pathogens  etc. That's why when one sneeze you think they are sick ,no way, that's just being dirty. This is why I give this place and a bunch other chain food joints in town. So people everything you go to a good chain joint  watch out. The gloves ,the sweeping, the prep area the bathroom omgosh  the bathroom  and the eating area. If I could give this place  half a star like I did at Wendy's  in Clover,  gross."}
{"text":"I'm totally biased towards Salsarita's, but I just love it!  I used to go once a week when I lived around the corner.  I just love the chicken they use in their tacos.   Also, I love their chips and queso.  Their queso is creamy and not too spicy, and they put a special seasoning on their chips that is very tasty!  Definitely pick it over Qdoba, Tijuana Flats, or any of those other places!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Salsaritas since it first opened. The service is not the same anymore. The manager (a Caucasian man) is very rude. He does not care about the customer at all.   Food doesn't even taste the same anymore.  The only good thing they still have to offer is there queso"}
{"text":"Normally I have not had a problem with Salsarita's. However this time I ordered two beef soft shell tacos and apparently I ordered them with two helpings of grease! The amount of grease that came out of my first taco was more than enough to slick back Danny Zuko's hair from the movie Grease! It was so bad that I couldn't even eat my 2nd taco. Very disappointed and still hungry!"}
{"text":"I love salsaritas but not this one !! Friendly but the food at this one is not even close to any of the other ones I've been to including the ones in the mall !! I don't know what the difference could possibly be in a chain restaurant other than preparing it properly the queso was terrible it tasted old like it had been in the hot table to long .. Or to hot .. There's not much in the area but this place needs a tune up"}
{"text":"This place is a joke. Sometimes I'll go there and I won't be charged for certain things then I'll go later in the week and they say there's a additional charge for that. I ordered 3 kids quesadillas and food for my wife for pick up. When I got their the manger told me I couldn't get kids meals if I didn't have my children with me to prove their age. What kind of bs is this. Literally took everything in me not to slap him upside the head. Place has poor management and the staff aren't friendly at all. Truly never had a manager argue with me before until coming to this location. Wouldn't recommend to anyone. By the response below clearly they didn't read the entire message or care to address the other issues. Exactly why my experience has been posted to many blogs and I will no longer patronize Salsarita's."}
{"text":"The service here was awful!!  The rude girl making our food started with \"what do you want?\" She was unpleasant until some friends came to the counter, then she smiled and laughed and talked with them while making our food. She put things on my daughter's burrito that she didn't want. I love Salsaritas but will avoid this particular location in the future!"}
{"text":"I just want to say that the manager is so friendly and helpful at this location.  Even if there is an occassional issue, he makes the experience worthwhile!  I get the same thing every time, but it (steak nachos) is always good.  Most of the employees are friendly as well."}
{"text":"Just okay.   For some reason I can never understand/hear the staff at this location. I don't know if the music is too loud or there is too much background noise, but have to ask them to repeat themselves all the way down the line.   Regardless of what I've ordered it always seems cold by the time I pay, get my drink and sit down to eat. Between not using foil, the air conditioning and the ceiling fans, it just makes for cold food.   The chips and queso are tasty and are the only reason I let myself get talked into coming here from time to time."}
{"text":"Ate here 6/1/14 at 5:00pm. Second time here and the staff have been very nice both times. Chop salad is good and the outdoor seating is great."}
{"text":"Located in a popular apartment complex, so parking can become tricky. Their  chips and nachos are good, but the rest of the food can be bland. Unlike Chipotle, they offer free guacamole with any entree.   This location doesn't have the fancy Coke machine like the Cotswold location, so beverage options are limited. They have a full bar, but I've never seen a person with alcoholic beverages in here."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Salsaritas quest and that is what keeps me coming back. Other than that everything is subpar. I ordered the two taco combo and they barely put any meat in there. The employees were nice though. I was disappointed that they took away there freestyle drink machine. I was really looking forward to my diet root beer with a shot of vanilla."}
{"text":"Not a single employee spoke to me (just grunted). The place was a mess behind the counter. I got shredded lettuce (which I didn't ask for) for my taco salad??? Threw the food in the trAsh because it looked terrible. Won't be returning. Dirty restaurant and unfriendly staff."}
{"text":"I am giving it the lowest ratings possible because they royally screwed my order and insisted that the shells were wheat/gluten free when they are not.  I do not fault the employees as they were not aware that gluten is the same thing as wheat when they tried earnestly to help me.    The employees knew that the shells were made out of corn but were not aware that they also have gluten in them.  I took one bite and knew immediately.  Tried to call the corporate number on their website and of course they don't have a contact number.  First and the last time that I will eat here because they don't have an option for Celiacs like me beyond the chips.  Can't mess around with people's health, and please train/educate the employees as they were really trying to help.    FYI couldn't access the website to get allergen info at the time of purchase due to phone issue."}
{"text":"Absolutely God awful food and service!!! 12$ for a cheese burrito with cold chips add 1$ for salsa wow! Service was beyond terrible never asked chicken or steak just started putting stuff on my burrito! They were out of chips so they got some from the back that were freezing cold! Absolutely do not recommend this place to anyone! The food was so bad and I was so frustrated with the service that I couldn't even eat! No stars!!!!!! This place will close down soon and for good reason!!"}
{"text":"Note: This venue is inside the airport.  2.5/5 solid stars I wished I did more research on where to eat before settle down here.   eh, the food was just OK. I was not very impressed.   Ordered:  Grilled Steak Nacho- 3/5 Wow, it looks tasty, but overall it was just OK. The chips were very thin.  Grilled Chicken Quesadilla-3/5 eh, it was just okay--nothing special."}
{"text":"Since the renovation, I have had two poor experiences there.  I got turned onto their seasoned chips by a coworker which are wonderful.    When they were freestanding in front of Quail Corners the service was excellent.  I could pass up a $5 bag of Lay's Tostito's at Harris Teeter for a huge bag of theirs for less than $3 being in and out before my groceries started defrosted.  With the new layout, there is no way to \"jump the line\" if all you're getting is chips.  I have spent upwards of 15 to 20 minutes shuffling down the line after saying all I wanted was a bag of chips to go behind other customers having their order assembled.  Bottom line, love the chips but hate being subjected to a cafeteria line just to get them and pay."}
{"text":"My Take out Order was ready when I walked in the Door , the staff was friendly. Then it all went down hill.     If something is wrong with FOOD or a DRINK ,, my body lets me know very quickly, Well 30 Minutes after eating the takeout  I had Stomach Grumblings and then HAD SEVERE DIARRHEA, then it came back 3 hrs later for me some more DIARRHEA...  More spouse  had a Bout of DIARRHEA herself but with her it took longer for her body to say NO WAY, 2hrs after eating she had her issues.  I lived in New Mexico for 14 years and ate hot spicy Chili Peppers all the time, this food was not spicy or hot for that to have been the issue. We Both had the same CHICKEN BURRITO.  What a waste of time and  $19.77 for a Meal that didn't last and got us SICK."}
{"text":"Quick, fast and fairly cheap (should be under $10). Very similar to other Tex-Mex places like Qdoba or Moe's, but there are not any of those near this location that I know of. An excellent choice if you want a good lunch in about 30 minutes."}
{"text":"First off, this place is not fresh. It is disgusting and such bad quality. The queso is water, the flavor is bland, and it all around makes you just feel disgusting after you consume it. Me and my husband feel like crap now, and I didn't even eat my whole burrito. The lady who made my burrito was also rude and was talking about me in front of me."}
{"text":"Wow, not a lot of one stars in my review history so here we go......Salsarita's was the first \"Mexican\" place I tried when I moved to Charlotte....from Phoenix. Needless to say, I had high expectations, even if it was a step above Taco Bell. My first experience was absolutely horrible--I ordered a burrito which was cold, wet and dripping some kind of funky juice. Gross.  I went there a number of times after my initial bad experience and all I can think is no. I went there solely because for awhile were no other Mexican food options Uptown close to me and they offer a number of coupons in the Citpass book. But I've always been disappointed there, even up to last wk when I went there for the last time ever. Maybe it's the fact that the food had no flavor (seriously how does spicy salsa have no flavor?) or the fact that any time I used my check card there and didn't give them a tip (you know since they prepared my food), they would add a $1 or $2 in the tip line.....every....single....time. No bueno, sorry Salsarita's, you are officially Salsash***ty's in my book."}
{"text":"I like Salsarita's but I have to agree with the others. Their customer service is terrible. I went to get the good ol' Quesarito and she never asked me that I wanted my order to go. When I mentioned that I wanted to the order to go, the lady taking my order decided to give me attitude about it. How about you just do your job? I used to work in fast food; I understand it's stressful. Don't take it out on other people.   I was the only person in line."}
{"text":"What has happened to the Rivergate location?  Dirty floors that needed to be swept and tables not cleaned. Staff just standing around talking to one another. Hope they get the problems fixed soon."}
{"text":"Usually good here except for tonight. I can tell Salsarita's chops the romaine in-house they use in the taco salad. I got a big mouthful of dirt and grit in mine tonight. I work in the food service industry and I know if they were buying pre-cut romaine it is triple washed at the processor or the grower's cut house. C'mon Salsarita's, spend the extra $$$ on your ingredients instead of trusting the part time high school kid in the back to get the grit out of the lettuce before it is put out on the line."}
{"text":"Decent mexi-style food. The burritos or burrito bowls are probably your best bet. I've tried the Mexican pizzas a couple of times and they're impossible to eat pizza style....more like a soggy tostada. The meats are good and the salsa is fresh. Good thin chips. Clean dining are and Spartan but nice ambience. In my opinion Chipotle has the edge in taste but this is a nice alternative."}
{"text":"Pretty good for a an airport Mexican place. Was here for breakfast, I initially intended to hit Chick Fil A but due a tad of a hangover, I couldn't deal with the double wrapped line, so opted for no waiting at Salsarita instead. I was pleasantly surprised with the breakfast burrito. Choice of meats, eggs, potatoes, and veggies, tasted good and held me over for the flight. That being said, don't expect authentico Tijuana here."}
{"text":"Salsarita's is such a rip off! I went for the first time in a long time because they sent me a free chips & queso offer. They've just gotten so expensive. Regular sized entrees are now $7.49 and the small entrees are $6.49. It's just a dollar difference and the small vs regular sized burrito bowl has a significant size difference so worth the extra dollar for regular size. I got a regular sized veggie burrito bowl for $8.10 after tax. $7.49 is expensive for fast casual assembly style Mexican considering competitors Moe's, Chipotle, & Qdoba are either cheaper or the same price but offer more than Salsarita's. At all three of those other places they give you free guacamole if you get a vegetarian entree. Not at Salsarita's! It's ridiculous. Guac should be free on vegetarian entrees. I'd be more willing to pay the $7.49 if I get free guac in that price. Salsarita's prices used to be slightly cheaper and I do remember I used to get free guac on my veggie entree. I only went today because of that free chips & queso offer I had. I won't ever go there without an offer and pay regular price, especially since there are a couple other cheaper lunch spots in the area including Anita's Mexican Grill and Hibachi Express. Anita's down the street has a great Speedy Gonzalez combo (taco, enchilada, & rice) for $5.25. Filling and cheaper than Salsarita's! I believe Salsarita's is only getting good business because there aren't a whole lot of lunch options in this business park area. I hope they're aware that people aren't actually paying these high regular prices for lunch because they think it's a good deal. It's just because they don't have many other options. We'll see what happens with their prices once the Chipotle, Firehouse Subs, & Panera open up down the street. I'll only go back to Salsarita's for their $6 burrito or burrito bowl special on Mondays, which is a special I just found out about today. $6 is reasonable, not $7.49. $7.49 is getting into sit down Mexican restaurant price point territory. Salsarita's, please remember that you're a fast casual restaurant, not sit down. A price of $6.99 for regular entrees would be a lot better."}
{"text":"This place is like Qdoba, Moe's, and Chipotle. I would say that the food might beat Qdoba in my opinion, but not the other two.  This place is overpriced. You can go to an actual Mexican restaurant and order off a lunch menu and come out cheaper and with a better quality of food that tastes better. Here, an entre, a side of chips and dip (queso, quacamole, or salsa), and a drink cost around $10.00 or more.    It is convenient if you don't have a lot of time and want something to go. It is better than Taco Bell.  Lots of people love this place. I'm not the biggest fan.   This particular establishment has overcharged me.  I have sent an email to their headquarters on 2/18/15. I can update this review if called for.  UPDATE: 3/9/15 It has been a few weeks and I never received a single response. This plays blows. Make sure you watch what they ring up, as for me, it did not even come close to matching the menu price.  A small burrito was listed as $5.49 from the menu I took from there that same day. It was a veggie burrito, so it shows to subtract $.50. That's $4.99 for a small veggie burrito. They charged $6.99 and I didn't notice until I got back to work. They did not return my email about this. I will not go back. It was a bunch of apathetic kids working there anyway who looked like it was an inconvenience to serve my food.   I'm normally laid back about places to eat, always try a place twice, and am easy to please. This place is a bad experience even for me. I'll just stick to Chipotle, they taste much better anyway.  UPDATE: (June 2016).  A few coworkers have twice dragged me here despite my protest (since my review) and it's been way better. I will bump it from one star to three."}
{"text":"Our visit was phenomenal. Went with a medium sized group during lunch hours. Customer service was on point and one worked of the went above and beyond for us. Even a very hard to please colleague was very impressed. The food was delicious, as always. We will return!"}
{"text":"Salsarita's is by far my favorite of the \"fast food, prepare it in front of you Mexican chains\" (Chipotle, Qdoba, Moes, Taco Bell (if that one even counts)).  The Cotswold location is the closet to me so that's where I'll go if I get a hankering for their amazing chips and some tacos.   The food is always good and consistent.  I like the soft tacos (one chicken, one pork) and I love that they give free guacamole (lookin at you, Chipotle...).  The service is always pleasant and friendly.  I've had their catering at church events and it is on par with their fresh preparation.    Also, the new vinaigrette they have is INCREDIBLE!  I can't remember the title of it, but some sort of honey lime or something?? It's so good and adds so much to the tacos.   Overall, I would pick Salsarita's over any of those other chains any day."}
{"text":"As hard as it is to give Salsarita's a bad review My experience today just topped it.  First let me say that this bad review is for this location.  I have never had bad experiences at the other locations, but this isn't the first time I've had a bad experience here.  First, I arrived at 1:30 PM which I would think would be after the lunch crowd, but the line was almost out the door.  At first there were only three people working the line, but eventually it got to five.  Also, when I ordered the taco salad (the Thursday special) they were almost out of romaine lettuce.  If this was my first experience at Salsarita's I probably wouldn't come back.  I think I'll be done with this location, cannot wait until the Quail Corners location reopens."}
{"text":"t's back!  They have moved to the old Blockbuster Space in Quail Corners at 8400-A Park Road..  By far the best Salsarita's location in Charlotte.  (I thought that about the old location as well).  Ingredients are fresh, and the quality is impeccable."}
{"text":"First time at this location. Ordered a small chicken quesadilla which cost about $6 fill with about $3 bucks worth of fillings. Not worth it.  Go to Chipotle same chicken quesadilla cost $4 with a lot more."}
{"text":"This place reminds me of Qdoba, Chipolte and Moe's Southwest Grill: they're just fancier versions of everyone's favorite go to spot when they're broke: Taco Bell. Nothing spectacular or memorable. The nacho chips they serve are too salty. Prices are ok. Best time to come is lunchtime. This location closes at 8pm."}
{"text":"Another great visit!  Fast and courteous staff. Walk in to a line but moved quickly. Everything tasted great and so much couldn't finish it all! Well done, see you again soon!"}
{"text":"3 stars due to cleanliness! First this is a chain Mexican restaurant no bells and whistles, which is fine, but for only having 4-5 patrons in the restaurant and several employees the place is gross by my standards.   Unclean areas: the tray they put my food on was at sticky, register counter area dirty, the coke machine was awful, black sticky stuff spattered where the spout it, table and the wall next to our table were not clean. I felt the urge to triple wash our hands when we left and couldn't enjoy my food to the fullest thinking how dirty the table was.  Food was ok, nothing to shout about like Chipotle (yum!!!) but not bad for a quick taco.  Only issue....clean the place!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised by the food. However, the customer service was not awesome.  I seriously was pleasantly surprised by the food, not expecting too much my bowl, chips and queso really hit the spot and wasn't greasy or dried out (as I saw in other reviews). However the customer service was definitely lacking. The girl who took the order seemed to be irritated that I (or anyone was there), the guy and girl finishing the order also appeared to not want to be there. They put the queso in the chips, the cup opened and spilled all through the chips and they were still going to serve that to me!  There was another girl at the cash register who saw it and remedied the issue and got me new ones.  So good... not bad!  Customer service... not really great."}
{"text":"Dissapointed. I love Salsarita's Mexican Grill don't get me wrong, but I was very disappointed in the presentation and the quality of the food that was served to me. When I got there, there was no line which was great. I decided I wanted some tacos for a late lunch I had with my family. I ordered three hard shells, but before I could even tell the server what cold items I wanted on my tacos, he had already over flown the shells with beans, rice, and meat. Not good. By the time we did get to the cold toppings he had to put very small amounts to make it look like he had made it all fit which he didn't. The tacos did not look very well put together and I hope that with more experience they can become better taco assemblers. And to top it all off I received the bottom of the barrel chips as my side which are not a very good salsa dippers. Oh and the coca cola machine that had the millions of flavors was removed from the store which was something I was excited about using. But, of course the food was delicious as always and I will be returning in he future."}
{"text":"Love this chain,  not this location.  Gentleman that i assume is the owner is unfriendly and stingy when it comes to toppings. We come because the food is always good but if there was another closer we'd go there."}
{"text":"There are so many choices for fast-food burrito/tex-mex restaurants.  In fact there are about 5 different restaurants within 5 miles of my house!  But my favorite is absolutely Salsarita's.  It has the freshest ingredients and and a healthier menu than the others...granted you can throw some of that queso on anything to up the calorie intake (and delicious-factor)!  The chicken is more flavorful and their veggies are crispier.  I always order the burrito in a bowl with chicken, black beans, their hottest salsa and extra cilantro.  Something else that adds to their awesomeness, there are no extra charges for sour cream or guac--which I think all their direct competitors do.  The service is good and fast making it easy to zip in and out.  Sometimes parking is a problem because of all the other stores around, but I don't mind walking across the parking lot for some awesome tex-mex.  Check out the great lunch deals they have.  There is a different special featured every day of the week."}
{"text":"This place has seriously hit the gutter. At one time this was some of the best fake Mexican food in town. Now their staff wears that hat backwards, have their Bluetooth headset in when talking to me and then they hand out soggy nasty food.  Time to close up shop salsaritas, chipotle has you whipped!"}
{"text":"Great spot for lunch...Nothing too fancy, but for the price it's a decent meal.  I had the pizza today with queso for the base and lots of cilantro, red onions and cheese...very good choice and a full serving for lunchtime!  Chipas and queso seemed to be pretty popular around us and service was good for an order at the counter kind of place.  Great go to for a quick bite...check it out if you are close by!"}
{"text":"Clean, upbeat and good food.  The menu selection is better than that other burrito chain and the salsa and guac are better tasting. The team manning the prep line were friendly and generous with the portions. The manager offered us a small container of the queso (for free) since we had already purchased the chips and guac. We will go back for another family meal.  Everyone enjoyed our first try."}
{"text":"This place is definitely good with me!   I stopped in Friday for their 2 taco daily special with chips, queso and a drink.   Yum!   The staff was super friendly and the place was very clean. I ordered one steak and one pulled pork taco on crispy shells with lettuce, cheese, fresh jalapenos, sour cream and corn salsa.   Simply delish!    The steak and pulled pork were both seasoned very well. And they are plentiful with the toppings here, which is a huge win!   Best part...the queso! OMG! Seriously, whenever you can...get it! It's worth it!   There you have it, short and sweet. They have GOOD stuff here!! Plus it's a very convenient location for me, so I'm sure to be a regular!"}
{"text":"Mmmmmm...HOT chips and queso!!!  Salsarita's is becoming one of my favorite quick Mexican lunch and dinner spots!   This location was super clean, and the staff were all very friendly! I was greeted right when I walked in he door...with a smile! How awesome!   I ordered the daily special two tacos, I chose chicken with chips, queso and a drink. The tacos were delicious, chicken had great seasoning and tons if toppings to chose from including lettuce, cheese, sour cream, jalapeños (yes!) tomatoes, onions, guacamole and three different salsas depending on you heat preference!   The chips were STELLAR....freshly made and piping hot! I fell absolutely in love after the first bite! It so rare you can walk in and see hot fresh chips being made right in front of you!   And for less than $10 it's a total win in my book! Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Love Salsarita's! 2-taco combo every time I go ... 2 tacos, chips & salsa and a drink for $6.50. Their queso is delicious ... and they have shrimp as an option for your tacos. Shrimp & Queso?!? TAKE THAT CHIPOTLE!"}
{"text":"it would be nice if they had some sort of protein that wasn't either a bean or a dead factory-farmed animal, though it works when you're hungry and you don't eat death and you find yourself stuck in the charlotte airport"}
{"text":"I'm maybe I'm missing something here because I found the place to be really underwhelming. The service was excellent friendly and fast but the food was . . . eh. I kept getting a 'chemical taste' off of the food and I'm not normally someone who is sensitive to that kind of thing, I got the brisket tacos and they ended up being 1) kind of chemical artificial tasting and 2) watery from the salsa. Not really a good combination. Maybe I chose poorly but I wasn't impressed at all."}
{"text":"Personally, I enjoy Salsarita's.  I don't know where these other reviews are coming from.  I only gave them 3 stars because I like Chipotle , Qdoba, California Tortilla, and Cafe Rio better (this is better than Moe's). They really do need to make cleanliness a priority.  Not filthy, but considering they aren't usually slammed, the tables should be wiped down.  I think the food is good though. Queso is pretty good too. Decent option."}
{"text":"This place is now a dump.  Time for renovation.  Food cold.  Service poor.  Quality not even close to Chipolte.  They Got rid of the cool coke machine which kids loved.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"Since I'm from CA and married to a Mexican woman, I would have to say this place is pretty good for Charlotte.  I love my local burritos and there was actual flavors at this place.  The carne asada had a lot of flavor and the salsa/guacamole definitely helped add flavor.  In CA this place would get 3 stars, but because I'm in Charlotte it's definitely 4 star worthy.  Good job bringing the flavor to the South!"}
{"text":"So I'm in charlotte working this week and staying with a friend that lives by this place. He goes almost every day the food is good but it taste like moe's but with a bar. I didn't see the big deal about it but he walks by it every day to go home so maybe that's it"}
{"text":"Don't let the lunch line trailing out the front door discourage you, this is the A team and they get you in and out fast.  I would recommend the chicken topping over the other meats and it helps to request a dash of seasoning when you order nachos.  Make sure to get to know Steve \"the Legend Maker\".  Seriously, his business card says \"Legend Maker\" as his title lol."}
{"text":"In general, I prefer Chipotle for a quick Tex-Mex burrito fix, but from time-to-time, I found myself at Salarita's instead.  This location generally offers fresh ingredients and friendly service.  This place is a-ok for a quick, casual meal."}
{"text":"I'm usually a fan of Salsaritas, but this location is awful. I stopped in tonight and there was a small line at the counter. For how few people were in line it somehow managed to take more than 10 minutes from order to checkout. They loaded my small burrito with so much meat, rice and beans that there was barely room to add anything else. I'm assuming that's why the condiment guy literally put only a small pinch of cheese. I laughed given the small amount and asked for more which was followed by another tiny pinch. He then proceeded to destroy my burrito in an attempt to roll it and  had to transfer the contents into a large shell. I ended up with a cold doughy pile of mush. The queso was thick and coagulated, mainly because I had to wait 5 minutes to pay after my order was done as the checkout process was also a disaster. The manager was at the counter helping and could tell how frustrated the customers were but didn't offer any apologies or explanations. The prep area was a mess, I had to have them scoop a bunch of corn and beans out of the salsa that apparently spilled in there and we're just being left to sit. All in all it was truly a horrible experience and even though we don't have many options in Indian Land I won't be back. You're likely to have a more satisfying customer and culinary experience if you decide to get a hot dog at the Gate station across the street."}
{"text":"I wondered why there was no one in the place when I walked in today at 12:30. After what was possibly the WORST meal I've had in years, I no longer wonder. Salsarita's has nose-dived in the last 2 years. While it's never been known for great food, up until about a year or so ago, it was pretty reliable fast-food Tex-Mex. Not great but not bad. Now...it's just bad. I got the quesadilla and EVERYTHING about it tasted stale and bad-flavored. The queso was just awful. And most insulting was the price. $10+ for one lousy meal. Shame on this sham of a chain. I hope to hear that Salsarita's goes out of business. Soon."}
{"text":"Not very fresh. Rice was hard. Beans crusted over. Taste was ok. Maybe it was a bad nite but the service was also uninspired. With many other burrito options no reason to come here."}
{"text":"Salsarita's is a great dinner or lunch option if you are looking for something quick and reasonably priced in the University Area.  The giant, monster burritos are great.  I usually run the chicken with refried beans along with the other fresh and tasty fillings you'd expect to have at a burrito joint. I LOVE THE FACT THAT THERE ISN'T AN ADDITIONAL CHARGE FOR GUACAMOLE!  The chips are well, chips, although sometimes I feel they can be a bit salty at times.  Compared to the other burrito joints in Charlotte, Salsarita's falls somewhere in the middle.  For my money, its a better option than Qdoba's, and there isn't an additional charge for guacamole.  On the other hand, I wouldn't say Salsarita's is better than Johnny Burrito or even Chipolte.  The fillings options are better at Johnny Burrito and the meats at Chipolte seem to be full of more flavor and tenderness.  The staff at Salsarita's is always friendly, welcoming and gets you in and out without any problems.  Prices are always reasonable.  Parking is always plentiful.    I've no complaints with Salsarita's and will continue to frequent Salsarita's when looking for a practical lunch or dinner option in the north Charlotte area."}
{"text":"Told them my order three times and they still asked what I wanted. Then laughed and talked crap because I couldn't hear them. Very lazy and rude workers"}
{"text":"Old dry chicken burrito. Made with no love, nor customer service in mind. Find another place..."}
{"text":"Stayed at a nearby hotel for business and tried to order food to go - the menu online is really confusing; it does not say what toppings options for the tacos/burritos/bowls are other than the meat or veggie option. It made it impossible to order over the phone so instead of doing that and having one person run over to get everything, our entire group had to go."}
{"text":"Another Charlotte favorite is Salsarita's... specifically for the shrimp burrito. I don't know of another fast food/quick food burrito place that offers shrimp. Do you? If so, post a reply and let me know asap! Although the line was crazy long and slow... granted it was a weekday around lunchtime, the food was good and inexpensive. I'm a Chipotle girl all day but again... for a shrimp burrito... two thumbs up for Salsarita's."}
{"text":"Attention Yelpers....Please read the reviews as it will save you true dissatisfaction and possibly your life.  This location use to be be really special and enjoyable to eat at but over the past several months it has fallen apart. I honestly try and give each place we visit a fair shake but the event that compounded while my wife stopped in to eat make me never ever...ever want to eat at any of their locations again. To start the man in front of use was ordering two items steak and chicken. The manager told him steak was not available and it would be 20 min for fresh steak. He then asked do you have shrimp again the manager replied 20 min. The man then walked out saying I will come back later. While we were waiting in line to the right of us while we waited in line was trash not just a few items but a large pile like it was just swept and forgot about. Now I know they may have been cleaning but they were in the back after we ordered signing and talking about that they were drinking this weekend.  We order chicken and ground beef burritos and as they put the sour cream on our orders the bottle was empty and made that empty bottle sound flinging sour cream sloppy all over the plate. The manager then took his bare hands and while the rim of the plate with his hand to attempt to remove the splatter smearing more everywhere. Being patient and trying to understand we then we to the register to be rung out and was told our computers are down and could not print a receipt. Come to find out the total we were charged was not what we were told from our order, but since I did not get a receipt I can't prove it with my bank. The food tasted like it had been sitting in a hot well for hours as ground beef should not be crunchy. I did want to take a picture of the trash to ruin anyone's appetite but did want to show you show the outside looks so I can imagine what the kitchen condition is. Bottom line is buyer beware and read the reviews. The Franchise needs a true wake up call for this location fast."}
{"text":"This location is easy to forget about because it's tucked away in Cotswold behind the new Panara and in front of a Yoga studio. I've never been at this location while it's been busy and that's probably because of how tucked away it is and probably because I don't go over there during lunch breaks. While I can't rate the food here because I can't eat it, I can remark on the experiences my companions have had. Anyone I've gone with has always enjoyed their food and had decent service. On tonight's visit, we discovered that they have one of the Coke flavor machines where you can select from a ridiculous amount of Coke flavors. Our only complaint from tonight was that there was water dripping from the ceiling, possibly from the exposed duct work. At any time, four people would be splattered by falling water drops. If you enjoy Salsarita's this appears to be a decent location."}
{"text":"Gotta love Salsarita's, one of my favorite lunch spots.  Fresh food, great salsa, great prices!  My only suggestion would be to add grilled fish taco's to the menu."}
{"text":"Huge line at lunch - but it moves fast.  Check in on foursquare to get a free drink upgrade, and be sure to join their loyalty club.  After you spend $100, you get a $10 on your card, and $10 on your birthday - I've been eating for free since September.  They offer the typical, tacos, burritos, nachos, taco salads.  I always go with a two taco combo, soft taco, to go."}
{"text":"I usually come to his location since uptown & tyvola salsaritas is usually closed when I want it.  This one is ok. It's kinda hidden behind the already hidden panera. Salsaritas is usually nothing spectacular but I always believe you get the most bang for your buck. I always get he nachos which always ends up piled high so that's good. Meat is not as flavorful as chipotle or Moes. One thing I always loved is that they don't charge for guacamole......until now. I went yesterday and they now charge $1 for guacamole ."}
{"text":"Great place ... I have been there 3 times in the last 2 weeks for lunch.  Loving the Pineapple salsa and the Mangos."}
{"text":"Me and my friends love this place but maybe everybody that worked there was having a bad day. I felt rushed and the girl that made my burrito keep saying that she \"should've locked the doors\" and \"she was tired\". I just didn't feel welcomed at all. Someone needs to do something about the night staff or we will not return. Also my chips were old and the rice was cold smh!!!"}
{"text":"Good option for airport fresh mex. Good was hot and fresh despite being almost 9pm. Service was friendly and efficient despite it being busy."}
{"text":"Very poor service, staff was unfriendly and not trained.  Food was cold and lacked flavor.  Chipotle is better.  Actually Taco Bell is better."}
{"text":"Stopped here on a layover trying to find food that was somewhat healthy which can be a challenge at the airport. I got the small chicken bowl with beans and veggies. Several toppings to customize your order are available. Food was OK (for airport food- hence the 3 stars). Would eat there again if in CLT."}
{"text":"This is a great lunch option! Quick and reasonably priced. I really like their tacos and the guacamole is delicious!! Lots of fresh toppings!!  For meat, definitely recommend the pulled pork and steak!  Chicken was so-so...kind of bland. Service is fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Food quality is decent, but not even close to authentic. Portion size will fill you up, so theres that.  Staffing is ATROCIOUS. No one seems to know what they're doing and it's very cringy watching them slowly try and roll your food up...sometimes requiring them to start over as they're always tearing the wraps.  The dining area is surprisingly spacious but has that \"Subway style\" veneer to the furnishings, so it isnt a great sit-in option for families."}
{"text":"GF and I shared the chicken Nacho's! !BOMB! Would def recommend! This place is set up like subway, or chapotle where what ever you order goes down the assembly line as you tell them what to put on it.  Sour cream and guac were no extra charge :)  Check this place out, I Liked it"}
{"text":"Located at Blakeney Crossing, across Rea from the big Blakeney shopping center, I enjoyed my first meal at Salsarita's (I am beginning to think I am Yelp-stalking Candyce B. - I keep checking out places on my side of town that she has reviewed).  Nice sized place without being too big, but another LOUD stop because of the uncarpeted floors and the exposed ceiling.  On a Thursday around 5:45, it was busy without being packed.  Parents with screaming crumb snatchers in tow were streaming in.  A nice size seating area with booths and tables/chairs, with a couple of high top tables.  They also had an outdoor seating area, but it was a little too windy/cloudy this evening to enjoy that.  Salsarita's is another Chipotle/Qdoba/Moe's place where you walk down the line adding ingredients to your bowl/burrito/quesadilla/taco.    The food: A small steak burrito:  Their small is pretty large to me, if I had gotten the large I would not have been able to finish it.  I had a steamed tortilla stuffed with steak, beans, rice, sour cream, lettuce and cheese.  They had many ingredients and several types of protein including chicken, ground beef, shredded brisket and shrimp.  Several kinds of salsa.  Flavored sour cream, onions - lots of choices.  I found everything to be well flavored and fresh tasting - no brown lettuce in my burrito. Chips and queso - Warm crispy white tortilla chips with white queso.  Mild, creamy and yummy.   And my favorite - a Coke Freestyle machine (YAY COKE!), so I had a cherry Seagram's ginger ale - yummy!  Because they have started the countdown to Cinco de Mayo, the chips and queso were free (YAY!).  Friendly employees, clean restaurant, tasty food - I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I am wavering between a 2 and a 3.  Meh.  It was... meh - but nothing really wrong or offensive - just meh.  I like Salsarita's for fast casual Mexican, though I typically go to the Blakeney location.  This location, at Quail Corners, was recently renovated (moved from a standalone that was demolished to make room for a McDonald's to inline with the rest of the shopping center).  Clean, bright space - bring on the cheese dip.  The food: My typical order of a small steak burrito with chips/queso was called out to the friendly, efficient staff.  My toppings for my burrito were steak, rice, pinto beans, lettuce, sour cream and cheese.  I would have gotten more toppings (ingredients?  additions?), but after seeing the wet scoop of steak go on the burrito (yuck - what is the meat soaking in?) I didn't want a tortilla filled with mush.  Sadly, that is exactly what I got.  The overstuffed burrito was loosely rolled and after about three bites, I had a mess - in between my fingers, under my rings... I hate that.  I ate the rest with a fork.  The meat tasted different to me than the Blakeney location, though since Salsarita's is a chain, I doubt that it was different.  It just tasted not quite right and not the normal yummmm that I experience.    Some of the chips were a little overdone, though good.  Not overly salted and a good weight to hold up to the queso.  The queso, as usual, was yummy.  And they have a Coke Freestyle machine (YAY!), so I was able to have my cherry ginger ale.    There was plenty of seating and the drink and napkins/utensil stations were clean.  Though nice and quiet when I arrived, a little after 6:00 it started to fill up with the typical ill-behaved children and the parents who ignore them.  (Your child's ass and feet on the surface where other people would like to eat isn't acceptable behavior and stop the damn screaming!)   Maybe it was just an off night - but I won't be rushing back."}
{"text":"Similar to Chipotle, but cleaner.  You order at the counter to choose your meat/veggie filling, type of tortilla or bowl, style like taco, burrito or bowl and then it goes down the line to receive further fillings. There are also salads available using their variety of toppings over a lettuce bowl.  Mostly rice or beans and they offer black and pinto beans.  A number of salsas (like in SALSArita's), cheese and other goodies.  Guacamole is also an additional cost add-on.  I tried the shrimp tacos and wife had a two taco selection of pork and steak.  We liked them both at will return on occasion for other selections.  The big advantage here is that you can get what you want, tailored to how you want it.  Prices are reasonable and seating is plentiful.  So also are condiments.  A beverage bar has soft drinks, iced tea and water.  And there is a hot sauce central area with a good selection of bottled hot sauces.  If you have small children go with someone to help as you will need both your hands to carry your tray, take it to a table, then go to get drinks, etc.  You will have a back-and-forth after receiving your order."}
{"text":"Finally some restaurants have opened within walking distance from the office.  One of the first was Salsarita's, a Charlotte based chain.  Salsarita's set up is similar to the other customizable assembly style fast \"Mexican\" style places.  This places gets very crowded for lunch but they are always very fast.  They have a different special every day, and even offer a 10% discount to us.  Most of the food is made fresh as you can often see the meat being cooked.  It's also a good place for vegetarians too, as you can get grilled vegetables instead of meat (no tofu though).  For the price, the convenience, and the quickness of the service here, it's a great lunch spot.  Don't go here expecting authentic Mexican style cuisine, but the food is high quality for the price."}
{"text":"If you need a fix for Mexican this is much better than Chipotle in my opinion. Although it is a little pricey for an everyday meal situation is is incredibly feeling. The only reason I give it three stars and not four is because its not a sit down casual dining restaurant.   All the items are pretty much the same ingredients just in different combinations.    There is a wide choice of proteins that range from seafood to pork and this particular location offers margaritas although I've never had them before so I can't attest to their flavor.  The staff is down to earth and makes great conversation especially since I'm a relatively new repeat customer.     In the world of generic Mexican/Southwest cuisine this difinitely the top of the barrel."}
{"text":"Great staff, clean and yummy!  My kids love it!"}
{"text":"Always fresh ingredients !  This restaurant is close to home and has a friendly environment. Fast service and the best chips around!  We get the two taco special. It isn't advertised but comes with salsa chips and a drink. Great value!"}
{"text":"A good option for quick service at the airport.  As such it's your typical chain Mexican food.  The most distinguishing aspect was their chips and salsa.  Their mild was a very chunky Pico and their chips did seem light and freshly fried."}
{"text":"I have lived in this area for a very long time. I have also eaten at this restaurant frequently throughout a minimum of 10 years. Up until recently it has been great! Until the past few months, the food was always fresh and the people who work there were friendly and helpful. Now, I walk in and it is made very clear that the three people behind the counter are mad about something. The man at the beginning of the line was mumbling and asking me questions I couldn't hear while he was turned around. I guess this made him even more upset that he had to repeat himself. The next woman in the line was clearly mad and made that clear with the way she spoke to the other worker at the end of the line. All of this, and they couldn't give me the correct size drink. Then proceeded to make me pay for something they hadn't added to my order after the transaction had gone through. Not my fault you forgot extra queso and the fact that my drink was a large. I said it loudly at least 4 times. After the worst experience ever, the food was cold and flavorless. No amount of hot sauce could cover up the poor preparation. This has been someone of a pattern with this Salsaritas as they have changed they way they heat/maintain their food many times I have noticed. All in all, this is a corporate restaurant and I feel they should be consistent, not only with food, but a staff that doesn't make you feel like crap for spending your money there. The cherry on top would be the long hair I found in my tightly wrapped burrito. No, it was not mine. Ew."}
{"text":"This site is lacking allot. We were the only people in line at 12:00pm. The staff didn't even great us. I gave my order and was promptly told there was no rice for the burrito.  Couldn't believe you opened at lunch with no rice. As my tortilla was handed to the next staff member, she laughed that there was no rice. I had to tell her twice what beans I wanted. She had no initiative at all.   Constantly repeated myself to every staff member. We paid and sit down.  When I bit into the burrito, it split in half. The tortilla was stale.    This was the worst service I have ever received at a Salsaritas.  Do see us ever visiting it again at this point."}
{"text":"It's good for vegans/vegetarians.  You get a bag filled up with chips with salsa if you order them for $3.39.  The vegetable fajitas were not fresh, but beans and rice were decent and the rest of their veggies were good and fresh.  There were a few pilots in line as well as local airport staff arriving as we sat and ate our meal.. A Good sign I suppose."}
{"text":"Uber-licious chips....no other place can compare.  When they closed my Ballantyne location I went into withdrawals until I found this location.   A little bit out of my way but if I combine all my errands to this area, worth it...."}
{"text":"Great location, fresh food, service with a smile! I like hot food hot and cold food cold. Today I got the perfect burrito bowl at Salsarita's. All of the staff is very friendly and the dining room is clean, spacious and bright. Finally the ingredients are fresh and blended together for a tasty lunch."}
{"text":"I like Salsarita's but unfortunately this location seems to have gone downhill recently. We generally get take-out but lately we get home to find burnt quesadillas, quesadillas with no cheese on half of it, or a bag of broken \"bottom of the barrel\" chips. We usually go there because our kids like the place but even they don't like it anymore. Most of our order last night went straight in the trash can."}
{"text":"I've been here about 4x's in the last month and the last 3x's, the Mexican rice has been undercooked, and COLD!!  I'll admit it may be because I get lunch before 11 am to try and avoid long lines but cold! Not acceptable.  Most of the items in my bowl that are supposed to be hot are warm at best.  I also think the price of a small burrito bowl with Mexi rice, pork, queso, corn relish and guac is WAY too much, the darn bowl wasn't even half full!!!  Loved the taste...when it was hot but the price for the small cold portion for my particular item is too much.   No more Salsarita's for this gal."}
{"text":"Staff at night is always friendly and they make good food.   I went in very late once and they were understandable almost out of the type of rice I wanted.  So they gave me extra queso for free.  They are very accommodating"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good... Clean restaurant with friendly people working here... A good place for a quick bite for lunch."}
{"text":"Good for breakfast or lunch. Breakfast burrito is particularly good, spicy if you want it to be, & not skimpy. For lunch by favorite is the nachos as I can get just what I want on them! Guacamole is a must on anything."}
{"text":"We were needing lunch while in the area for an appointment. It was lunch hour and the place was very noisy. We told the servers it was our first time there but they seemed only to care about moving us along in the line quickly.  Ordered a veggie burrito and a veggie quesadilla. Was asked several times what meat we wanted and had to reply \"veggie\". We paid $23 for soggy flour tortillas with beans and bell peppers, and greasy chips on the side. Didn't enjoy it for the money."}
{"text":"I can tell you right now that I am thoroughly pissed off.  My girlfriend currently works here and she is getting death threats from her coworkers.  Saying things like, \"we know what your car looks like\" and I'll get my people on you\".  Honestly she is the hardest working person I know and she was almost in tears the last few times she has worked.  I was tempted to go over there myself but she told me not to thus I am writing this.  I am begging her to quit and as soon as she finds another job she told me she is.  I am tempted to call the police or possibly go the dirty route, have no idea how concrete these threats are.  Regardless of what is going on I am pissed and if I hear of one more incident I am going over there and taking care of this myself, this is absurd and I am fed up.  Fuck you Salsarita's, FUCK YOU!!!"}
{"text":"The food is good but overpriced. I got a burrito and chips with cheese no drink, over $13. I said, is this a large, I ordered the regular, they said it was because I got steak in my burrito. Regardless I won't be Back."}
{"text":"One of our go-to places for a quick, healthy meal. Their grilled chicken (which we get on a salad) is addictive and with salsa, you don't need any kind of dressing. I wish the serving size was a little bigger, because the salads are $7, but I know margins are really tight for restaurants and I don't begrudge them making a living."}
{"text":"Though the food IS decent,  the portions are quite small compared to their competitors. I would also have to comment that though the food is decent,  the staff isn't the kindest. They act as if you are hindering their time."}
{"text":"Floor was sticky... AC wasnt working it was hot and uncomfortable in the restaurant. Food was bland.. coke freestyle was out of alot of options including lemonade. Too expensive for a crappy experience.. i used to work at a salsaritas too and it wasnt like this."}
{"text":"Head for QDoba instead. Everything is extremely salty...not flavorful, just salty. Other ingredients seemed lower quality than QDoba. Customer service was good though. But no matter how friendly your staff are, doesn't compensate for poor food. Maybe the cooks aren't flowing the menus???"}
{"text":"Similar to a Moe's but you have to pay for the chips on the side.  Actually, their chips are lightly seasoned and taste better than Moe's.  The chicken on my burrito and my daughter's taco was a little dry but the rest of the ingredients were fresh and tastey.  Clean and friendly atmosophere.  I noticed they also do catering for parties and such."}
{"text":"This Salsarita's is hit-or-miss. The most recent time I went here, the counter was over-staffed, yet nobody seemed to take initiative in filling orders. I had trouble getting anyone to look me in the eye and watched as they mixed-up the orders of those around me. That said, I think their soft tacos are really good and the pineapple salsa, which is specific to Salsarita's, is also worthwhile. I'd skip the chips, however, as they are thin and overly greasy."}
{"text":"Terrible terrible terrible experience. Stood there, no eye contact, no greeting. After WE greeted the obviously irritated worker, we asked for burritos. Literally threw the burritos together, while rice and beans cross contaminated the meats. More ingredients flew into other things than the actual burrito. I watched as a huge chunk of pork fell into the shrimp, which I'm sure is a major health code violation. It was disgusting and unpleasant experience. Don't waste your time here, go to chipotle."}
{"text":"Comprable to Chipotle, but good nonetheless.  I did like that I had more food options than Chipotle, though. I would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"I am deeply annoyed to pay $3 for included salsa and guac because I requested on the side. They were stingy on the chips in the nachos, too. We will be going back to Moe's."}
{"text":"Save your money and just go to Chipotle. The rice wasn't fresh at all and it didn't taste good"}
{"text":"I am a regular since I work in the Plaza. Since the new manager and his team have been in place, I have been disappointed time and time again. The previous manager and his team never served me food that was soggy or undercooked.  I usually order potatoes and bacon for breakfast. The bacon is cooked the way I like it or else I would be a regular at Showmar's for breakfast by now.  Now, the potatoes are a gamble at best; sometimes dry, sometimes burned, sometimes undercooked. When I order the exact same order, I get different amounts of food each time for different prices.  I almost got to the point where I only want 2 people to help me as opposed to the blessed assembly line that everyone praises so highly. It is fast and I did enjoy the pizza when one guy made it. the next 2 times, it was soggy or had more red onions than meat and my toast hasn't been toasted in months. It's just warm bread.  Everyone is very courteous and wonderful but I can't eat courtesy. I've thrown away my hard earned money too many times for that to be enough."}
{"text":"Verdict: Maybe the best place to go in this airport.  Airport food is all relative and relatively unhealthy.  The Burrito Bowl is actually good and one of the healthier options for airport food. Plenty of protein and not a crazy amount of calories. There's still more than enough salt for anyone but that's how eating out often goes.  The regular (larger) bowl was a fair bit of food and it the spot because I was hungry. Got the chicken, black beans, Spanish rice, and all the veggies. To their credit, you get a good amount of guacamole art no upcharge. That's unusual these days.  This will probably be my new go-to place in CLT. It's more food and notably better for you than even the Quiznos next door."}
{"text":"A burrito bowl with extra meat, chips, queso and drink combo upgrade is about $15 bucks. But considering a whopper combo next door at BK is $11 I think it's reasonable. Plus my bowl o could easily share and I'm a big guy.  Prices without a combo and no extras hovers around $9. They have ground beef as an option. I know it's not as healthy as chicken but I love myself some ground beef. chips are light and make it hard for dipping except in the queso.  I think it's the service that probably gets a lower score but it's quick when you need to grab and go."}
{"text":"I've grabbed lunch here on a couple of occasions and enjoyed it both times.  This is essentially another flavor of Chipotle or Qdoba with the food being just as good as the last.  If you enjoy halfway decent fast-food Mexican, several steps above Taco Bell, then you'll enjoy this place.  This particular restaurant was very clean with great, polite staff.  One difference I felt this did have against a Chipotle was price.  This placed 'seemed' to be cheaper; however, I didn't actually compare prices.  I'm looking forward to eating here again."}
{"text":"My first time at a Salsarita's and it was delicious! Quick service, great staff, and someone even came and took our trash for us. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"The food was very good but the women behind the counter were not courteous and nice. They looked like they were not happy serving people and not happy with their jobs. They need further training on how to treat customers and at least not show it on their faces and rather help customers and greet them with a smile. This is one of the most important traits for a good customer service."}
{"text":"Ordered a quesadilla, somehow they forgot the cheese. I'll never try salsaritas, anywhere, again"}
{"text":"Never had a bad experience here. They are always friendly and the line always moves quickly during the lunch rush."}
{"text":"I just had lunch at Salsaritas.  They were busy!  But they had plenty of staff and the line moved well.  Juan runs a great place.  The staff is friendly and the food is good and very fresh.  They also have one of those \"digital\" Coke machines now.  The kids will love it.   Way better than Moe's."}
{"text":"I ordered a rice bowl that basically had all of the toppings but the bowl was completely BLAND, the rice was hard and the shrimp was mushy.. I'm trying to figure out how shrimp comes out mushy. I don't eat here often and probably won't return."}
{"text":"Had money left on my loyalty card but when I got to the cashier he didn't bother to check it out I had to tell him that I had money left on it Everyone else that ever checked the card told me that I had money on it I found this odd Food was good the ground beef had a different flavor a little spicy hopefully not to hide something  Will go back always believe in giving a second chance when I have a problem  Management should check on the guy who helped me didn't seem too happy at his job!!"}
{"text":"This new Salaritas is in a very convenient location if you live in Prosperity Church road area. There is lots of space inside and out . The team was very friendly and the food was pretty good.  This visit I had a shrimp bowl with rice and veggies. You have a choice of brown or Mexican rice. There are a ton of toppings, and at least 3 different heat levels of salsa. My favorite thing about Salsarita is the queso, theirs is not to hot or too mild and it goes well with their seasoned warmed chips ."}
{"text":"In town for business and hotel was across the street, if your from the south you may know Moe's and this place has the same concept. It was clean and about an hour from closing they were still busy and the food tasted fresh. I had the large steak quesadilla and did a combo with queso and chips. Everything was yummy and while a bit pricey at $11 for everything I would do it again over a greasy hamburger."}
{"text":"Always SUPER friendly and fast. They remember us when we come in, even though we are not regulars. They are all polite and the food is great. My toddler loves it- and on Tuesdays he eats free"}
{"text":"IMHO Salsarita's chicken is nothing compared to Chipotle's.  That aside though I do love the fact that I can get fresh cilantro at Salsaritas!  The breakfasts here are my favorite since I hate normal breakfast food.  We do a lot of work breakfasts here and it is the one place everyone can agree on.  They have a breakfast quesadilla with eggs and potatoes and you can get whatever you want on it - great prices and super friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Visited again tonight.  Planned to order a salad, but they ran out of lettuce?  Also, ordered chips and salsa, had to remind them three times.  Cashier tried to give me the meal which belonged to the person behind me in line.  Overall, poorly run."}
{"text":"Good food! Fast and friendly! Food was great! Service was fast and friendly! They have one of those mix your flavor coke machines that my wife loves too!"}
{"text":"Flavors are ok. But the rice was dry and crunchy. Unsatisfying crunchy texture was just awful!  Wouldn't come here again."}
{"text":"This place is always packed at lunch time, but the line moves fast!  The food is fresh, the staff courteous and the restaurant is always clean. I had the shrimp bowl this time around and was pleased with the portions and the selections for toppings, especially the chunky guacamole.  This a a quick and affordable option for lunch!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately the food is just OK. not great.  My child ordered the kids plate and we had to wrestle the counter staff to get each of the \"extras\" that come with tho kid's plate, like salsa and a tiny cinnamon donut. The staff did not apologize for forgetting these items and just gruffly handed them over.  I wish I could support this Charlotte chain restaurant, but this location is not worth a return visit. The uptown Salsaritas in the Bank of America is clean, friendly, and tasty. In South Charlotte, better to go to Chipotle."}
{"text":"Terrible place, stale taco nachos and stale shell .. my 3 Years old child who had never fallen ill . Had stomach ache and indigestion after eating here he was throwing up the next day. Also all of us had upset stomach.."}
{"text":"I used to come here often since my office was in uptown and its a perfect place to get a TOGO lunch for me. It's a good place to dine-in as well but it can be crowded depending upon what time you get here. They usually have a huge line which can be scary however the employee do a good job and keeping it moving so that you can be in and out with-in 15 minutes tops if you are taking it TOGO.   I usually do a dining in or should I say dine out on a patio when the weather is nice to get a break from office and sometime it can be entertaining to people watch while have a great food :D   The only reason they didn't get a 5 star is because I didn't see a wow factor in food or service."}
{"text":"Great service, great food! Traveling through & picked here at the last minute, not disappointed!"}
{"text":"Great lunch spot in Uptown and despite sometimes very long lines, they are very quick and you never wait too long.  They have great daily specials and employees are always friendly even on the busy days.  Great guacamole and their nachos and taco salads are solid picks."}
{"text":"Meh is right.  Seems like the quality at this location has really gone down, as each time we have been there it has gotten progressively worse..  They asked over and over what we wanted on our items, despite us having JUST told them.  They no longer carried several items that were being advertised right on the menu boards.   Meats were extra greasy.  Beans were not hot.  Cilantro was very wilted.  Tea tasted OFF.  The one bright spot was the guy who was bussing the dining area.  He seemed very friendly and helpful, and did not bat an eye when one of my children spilled some water (truly an accident).  There are too many other options, though,  for me to bother giving them yet another chance."}
{"text":"This place did have good food for a \"Mexican Subway\" style resturant at one time.  However they must be feeling some kind of money crunch because the prices keep going up, the extras keep costing more, and the size of the portions keep getting smaller.  Today when I ordered the regular nachos, an 8 dollar meal for lunch, it came in a 4 oz thimble.  I don't really pay 8 bucks for 4 ounces, it's like they are stealing at that point.  I might as well just walk in and hand them money for nothing, or get a gas station got dog."}
{"text":"Used to be a pretty decent spot for quick bite but the quality of the food has diminished considerably and the service is even worse   I would discourage anyone from eating here."}
{"text":"The food is not fresh (anymore).  This used to be one of my favorite places.  I stopped by after a year had gone by and the food quality has significantly declined.  Mushy tomatoes, undercooked rice hard as a rock..  At least the guac was good.  I won't be returning though."}
{"text":"Another Uptown location that understands foot traffic. (I mention that because there are some that never seem to have enough workers. I guess trying to save a penny.)    There's always a lunch rush line and this visit no exception. However, I was able to get in and pay in less than 15 min. Plus you food is ready as you go along.  Tasty options, and large dining room space. I would go again."}
{"text":"Didn't like the food or the big large lady wearing a cross on her neck. Don't know her name so I am describing her. She fixed my food and got the order wrong. She had a bad attitude and was on Facebook. Her instant messenger was calling her while taking my order. The owner Eddie was very nice and apologized for any I inconvenient  I had. I order grilled shrimp tacos but the shrimp was just boiled. The tortilla was cold even they she put it in the warmer. I will NEVER eat her again. Sorry too many good restaurants to get bad food and bad service."}
{"text":"I've eaten at the chain many times but stopped in quickly to this location yesterday with my mother the chips were fresh servers were nice I ordered chicken nachos like I always do I added jalapeños for the first which end up being so awesome my only complaint here would be that some of the tables were dirty and the rating was low for me personally"}
{"text":"I used to enjoy the nachos here I really did however the rating has gone way down so I stop eating here for awhile also my chips were stale last time i came here"}
{"text":"Good food. Good service. Also, they have that new soda dispensing machine. Already have a planned return."}
{"text":"Salsarita's is located in the main atrium, between the B and C concourses. There's also an \"Express\" location elsewhere in the airport.  This is a \"full\" Salsaritas with the usual burritos, nachos and such. There was a short line to get started, but it's the same service as you've seen at other burrito joints where you order and go down the assembly line of protein (meats and veggies available), toppings and cheese. At the end, it's wrapped up and ready to go.  My chicken burrito was decently stuffed with chicken and the guacamole was a bit more loose than I prefer but still tasty. It needed hot sauce.  Still, easy to grab and go, easy to eat on the plane!  ONCE AGAIN, YELP HAS MERGED TWO BUSINESSES THAT ARE SEPARATE BUSINESSES. Charlotte has two Salsarita's. One is an \"Express\" and it's in Concourse E. And then there's the regular Salsarita's and it's in the Atrium. I complained to Yelp and heard SQUAT. But here we are."}
{"text":"We needed a quick place to eat, near by our hotel. And this was it! It was on the order of chipotle.  Very clean. Nice decor.  We had shrimp bowls, steak tacos, and a chicken bowl. They ran out of shrimp after mine, so they said wait a few minutes, they'd make more, and they did."}
{"text":"It pains me to have to submit this review since Salsarita's used to be my family's fast casual option for Mexican food. We have even had a few events catered from Salsarita's. Admittedly, it has been about three months since we last dined here because we had been out of town for the summer. It appears a lot has changed and not for the better.  First, the service. I was with my two daughters and they ordered first. My oldest daughter ordered a taco kid's meal. The male server then repeated, \"a kid's nacho?\" I said, no, a kid's taco meal. Then, as he was preparing to make that, a female server said, \"she wants a kid's nacho.\" I said, no, she asked for a kid's taco meal. While the first server was finishing up preparing the taco(s), the female server said, we'll just ring her up for another taco. I inquired about the quantity of tacos in a kid's meal, and they said, \"one.\" I responded that all she wanted was a kid's taco meal and she didn't want two tacos.   Then, it was my turn to order. I asked for a regular chicken burrito. The order was prepared accurately, albeit with sparse fillings. When I asked for guacamole, I was told it would be $1 extra. This was a new change since I was last in the store, but I know that the prices of avocados has increased, so I was fine with that. However, when the server put a small dollop on the burrito with the spoon, I asked for a little more. We asked for the order to go and got to our destination to eat it.  Second, the food. As I bit into to burrito, I had to spit out my first bite as the chicken was char-burned. Luckily, the badly chard meat was only in that bite, but I was contending with flecks of charred meat in my mouth in the subsequent bites. After a couple more bites, I was surprised that the burrito completely lacked flavor. I had medium spice salsa on the burrito and that didn't even add a flavor pop. I was also thinking the guac would add nice flavor, but somehow it had very little taste at all, just large chunks of tomatoes to act as filler.  This experience has dampened any desire to return to Salsarita's again. There are other options that we can pursue where the food has more flavor and we get accurate service. The value for the quality of the product doesn't align. This is a sad day for me since we really had good experiences with the food and service leading up to this moment."}
{"text":"I've had better, but who hasn't? If you're in the mood for Mexican, give it a try, these places are a dime a dozen, experiences with everyone will vary due to the fast pace environment.   Food Review:  The chips, it's unfortunate, the are way to thin, you can't even dip into salsa with out it breaking into pieces, not to mention the Guac, which had no seasoning, borderline flavorless. And to rant on the chips again, no seasoning there as well, bland, bland, bland.  Arriving at 11:30 am, 30 minutes after they've opened. The ground beef was depressingly dry, looking from the line. I had to go with chicken due to the rest of the options appearance. It seemed like those items were sitting out there for hours.   Staff?  Friendly and welcoming, A+  Overall, quick meal, go for it, just don't expect much."}
{"text":"I went to Salsaritas to support our Church which was holding a fundraiser at this location. I arrived at 5:10pm and there were about 5 workers not doing much and zero customers. I actually wasn't sure it was opened as there were no cars in the parking lot. When I asked what time the fundraiser started they said 5:30pm.  Again, I'm the only person here but instead of crediting the fundraiser they preferred to lose a customer. I walked out and will not return."}
{"text":"Apparently this is a $3 queso and an appropriate way to send a taco home with someone.  If I could give less stars I would.  Never again Salsarita's"}
{"text":"The food is really great. However, go to Chipotle if you want better service. The young woman who helped me, totally overcharged me and seemed like she was in a bad mood.   Dear Salsaritas team (on the night shift): fix your attitudes - I know it sucks selling burritos in a airport, however, don't take it out on your hungry, paying customers."}
{"text":"Always great food and service.  Lunch grabbed Fixed and out in under 20 minutes.  Fast speedy line to work the lunch crowd.  Always order the lunch specials.  My favorite. \" Two Taco Special\".  One soft and one hard, one shrimp one chicken, shrimp on the soft one, all the way, all the fixins that are included, chips salsa and a 20 oz drink all for $6.99..Great buy!!!#"}
{"text":"The last time I ate at a Salsarita's I absolutely hated it because it seemed like they had a ton of cilantro to get rid of, and it ended up on my plate. Since then, I have boycotted Salsarita's in fear of getting more cilantro. I have been proven wrong (thankfully) and found a new lunch time haunt.   Like Moe's, and other assembly line American type Mexican food, Salsarita's has more options that most in my opinion. I've been to this location twice and both times I got nachos, with different meats. The 1st trip was grilled chicken. I liked how even though it was grilled, it didn't taste burnt. The chicken was fresh and hot and didn't taste like it was sitting under warming lamps for hours. The 2nd trip I got their shredded pork, which I found that I like better than the chicken. I will probably stay away from the ground meat, it looks like taco bells meat and I think dog food every time I see it. I will suggest, if you get the nachos, get both refried and black beans with their \"pink\" sour cream, those 3 things really bring out the flavor in the meat you put on your plate (not sure how that is, but who cares as long as it tastes good right?). Their drinks are fountain Coke products (I know I know, it sucks being a Pepsi fan in Charlotte...)"}
{"text":"This was my first time at salsaritas. I figured I would try something new for lunch. It didn't necessarily taste bad, it was more of the end result that bothered me. I ordered a chicken quesadilla, and they didn't put hardly any cheese, so went I went to eat it all the chicken fell out of the tortilla. I must have asked for sour cream 4 times before I paid, did I get it? No. How do you make a quesadilla with basically no cheese? I know it was during the lunch rush, but they need to pay attention to the quality. Most likely won't be back to this location."}
{"text":"I wish I would have checked yelp before coming for lunch today.  After we ordered I noticed they were out of sweet tea. We were the only customers in there and we asked if they had any more. An employee starts brewing the tea because obviously since we asked if they had more we wanted some. 15 minutes later I figure the tea is ready because since we are the only customers there they couldn't be busy. After I taste it I realize there is no sugar in it, and at the counter a employee was just standing there on his phone. I call that lazy and very rude because they knew we wanted sweet tea. Food wasn't very good. Ill make the drive to qdoba or chipotle next time!!! Who's running this place???"}
{"text":"I was working in the area and needed something fast for lunch and this was perfect.  It is located in a plaza near several office parks so it does get busy for lunch but the service was fast.  I love the queso, so a chicken quesorito was a definite choice for me.  Added the chips, queso, and a drink.  Was definitely a queso kind of day.    Similar to Chipotle you can pick what ingredients you want in your burrito.  All the ingredients seemed very fresh and I really like that they have fresh cilantro, adds the perfect touch.  The chips were warm and fresh and I thought the queso was great.  Great place to come for a quick fresh meal."}
{"text":"Cute restaurant.  Honestly Ochos Mexican Grill in Los Angeles had better burrito bowl.  Their Chips were a tad bit salty.  Man my ankle swole up."}
{"text":"Everything around my office seems to be a chain.  It's still good though and it won't stop me from coming here.  The staff is very friendly and they line moves fast... Try to get there around 11:30 and you can beat the lunch crowd (that comes from the IBM and Wachovia business offices).  I usually get the grilled chicken quesadilla and make it a combo with chips and queso.    The manager is really friendly and he remembers you when you stop by... great place for a break during the workday."}
{"text":"I've had to lower my expectations of Salsaritas after several disappointing meals. One look at the rice and meat is all you need to see that food quality is not a priority. Rice should not be crunchy and the meat should be fresh, not crusted and dry. Salsaritas simply isn't in the same class as the other well-known Mexican restaurants. I've had similar experiences at the Indian Land location, so this isn't an isolated issue. There are much better options if you're looking for good, fast Mexican fare."}
{"text":"This place is great and ever since Starbucks moved there is ample parking. Plus kids eat free Sunday and Tuesday nights currently."}
{"text":"Well this seems to be a growing trend in the \"fresh, fast food\" arena, quick Tex-Mex. Salsarita's is much like Subway with a Mexican twist. But I think there are plenty of other places that do what Salsarita's does much better.  I would say both Moe's & Qdoba are the big boys that are better, but Phat Burrito beats them all. Anyways, Salsarita's is a quick stop for lunch with a fairly good meal at a good price. They have plenty of options, all being your typical Mexican foods, with burritos being the main hit.  There are plenty of other better quick Tex Mex places than Salsaritas, but if you're close by then this could be a quick meal for a good price."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place and was pleasantly surprised. I ordered a steak bowl and my boyfriend ordered a taco salad and both were very tasty. The steak had some really nice flavor to it. The ingredients all looked very fresh and we had a lot more options than at other chains that sell similar food (Qdoba, Chipotle, Moe's). For the two of us it cost $17 for two entrees and two drinks."}
{"text":"My children give this 5 stars.  Love the drink machine, chips and if you use the loyalty card - they'll discount your meals by quite a bit!"}
{"text":"Here's the thing. If I were to write solely on the food, My review would be much higher. I could even go with four stars. The food isn't bad, especially for airport food. My burrito with chips and queso tasted just fine and hit the spot, the but customer service here it truly terrible.  While I waited for my connecting flight home, I stopped here. While I waited in line I watch the employees make fun of customers under their breath, give numerous customers attitude, and crack unnecessary jokes behind the counter. It was kind of uncomfortable to be around honestly. One employee was laughing so hard (at a customers expense) that she couldn't wait on anyone because she was buckled over from laughter.  I would have left honestly but I had already ordered to be honest I was starving. It was bad, very bad. I fly through there somewhat regularly and will never stop there again because of that."}
{"text":"My order which screwed up three times took 35 minutes to get to me. My credit card was shut down due to the employees not paying attention what they were doing and then mischarging me twice then retracting the purchases. The employees were extreme rude and unaccomodating. I originally ordered a combo with a quesadilla and just gave up by the end because they wouldn't let me purcase the combo by the time my order was complete.  I hate giving negative reviews but this place needs to do better and re-evaluate their process and treatment of customers. Please do not eat here."}
{"text":"This is a chipotle type copy.   Fairly good one at that (although I'm not the biggest chipotle fan).  The taco salad was pretty good.  The chips were very good as well as the questo.  Very fast service and clean fairly spacious dining room.   I would not hesitate to return for a quick lunch"}
{"text":"The employees aren't the friendliest. They are All ways out of items and the proteins are never hot !! I gave them two chances and I'm no done . Back to mallard Creek location."}
{"text":"The concept is typical - fast Mexican with a build your own food walk akin to Qdoba, Chipotle, Panchero's... But Salsarita's just tastes a million times better to me. I think it's the pinto beans. They're a mixture of cooked beans and smooth refried beans. Or perhaps it was the marinated chicken that almost had a smoked flavor. Whatever it was, my burrito bowl was out of this world. A madhouse of Mexican flavors for a smart price.   My stomach wasn't remotely tore up after."}
{"text":"This place is tucked into a tight, one way in & out corner that's attached to a building that's under construction... so if you don't know where you're going, you'll never find this location despite it being right on South Tryon.  Terrible signage, terrible location for food that's just not that memorable.  I'm not sure if this location will be here for long with these issues stacked up against them.    Once inside, the first thing I noticed is that the \"cantina\" (think small bar) area was woefully underutilized.  It's designed to sit in tall bar type seats and have an alcoholic drink while watching the game (which sparks my interest), but there's nothing behind the bar- it looks like a complete afterthought and frankly, a waste of valuable space.  It's also very difficult to figure out where the \"start\" space is... again, no signage.  Signage is a cheap fix guys, this isn't the place to cut corners.  The people are friendly and helpful, but the entire place flows from right to left, so it just never feels correct.  Zero flow here.  Then you have to hunt for the napkins and plastic utensils.?.  AGAIN - SIGNAGE GUYS!  We don't all work at Salsaritas, we don't all come in there daily, and we don't like feeling confused.  SIGNAGE ALL AROUND would really be appreciated!!  The food was blah- nothing better or worse than Qdoba or Chipoltle or Viva Chicken...  it's all thrown in a bowl and handed to you.  I will say my chips and pico de gallo were tasty and not over salted and that the sweet tea was better than I'd anticipated."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick snack before boarding our connecting flight. Ordered a small chicken quesadilla with corns, beans, onions, and diced tomatoes. The small was beyond satisfying - in fact enough to be shared as a snack.   They were generous in the amount of chicken and various fixings. The tortilla was crispy, the chicken was juicy, and the cheese was stringy. Pat on my back for choosing a quesadilla from Salsarita's (for only $6!) over soggy fries from Burger King."}
{"text":"Kids do not eat free, unless you dine in:( So I was committed to getting dinner Togo, but was not able to take advantage of the kids eat free policy.       When I got home and we started to eat our meal, the steak burrito meat was burnt, so I had to pick it out to enjoy a veggie like burrito. My wife's pork hard tacos was terrible and did not stay together. So she had to eat it with a fork.       Bottom line, I will not be back any time soon, they drop the ball on my meal."}
{"text":"Salsarita's got me hooked on burritos. You got to give it to a place that serves SHRIMP burritos! I checked the menus of ALL the leading burrito places (fast to go places, not including restaurants) in NYC and have yet to find one that serves shrimp.  My regular fix would comprise of the following: - Burrito - Shrimp - Rice - Corn - Peppers - Guac - Salsa (med and mild) - Onions and peppers - Lettuce (lotsa lettuce)  NO CHEESE, NO BEANS. Oh and a plate plus fork and knife pls. Thank you."}
{"text":"Coming in I was turned off because my sandal kept getting stuck to the floor but they had a 98 health score so I proceeded. I ordered a veggie salad and chips and guacamole. They were supper slow on the line!!!!! They are pricey compared to moe's/qudoba and everything is extra $. As I started to eat I realized my rice was burnt and hard to the point that I couldn't even chew it. Overall fail."}
{"text":"Service here is always fast. This time I tried something new, Quesorito. I added extra queso so it was deliciously cheesy. It's so large that half filled me up. The sweet tea they had was just the right sweetness for me. I had the combo with drink and chip but didn't even get to eat the chips and queso since I was so full from the burrito. It's a little pricey but worth it every now and again. My girlfriend had the chicken nacho which she loves with all the spiciness."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick meal while shopping in the Cotswold Shopping Center. It seemed as though the entire staff had just a shift changeover and no one really knew where they were supposed to be or what was going on. My rice was hard and none of the food was very hot or fresh tasting. $9 for a burrito bowl and I was unimpressed with the portion size and taste compared to Moes or Chipotle. Ate it because I was starving but probably would not return."}
{"text":"Food is good. Location is in a shopping center with several other restaurants so parking can be a pain sometimes. Service was quick and easy to find a table. Hot salsa is awesome! My favorite is the chicken quesadilla."}
{"text":"Salsarita's had a great atmosphere and friendly staff. The manager Mitch greeted me and made suggestions because it was my first time. He was a very friendly and professional. He was even leading by example by cleaning the dining area and making sure it was presentable. You could see the reflection of his positive energy in the staff. I ordered the burrito bowl and was a fan of how I got to choose my own ingredients while moving down the assembly line. Fast, fresh, and delicious! I will be back to this location."}
{"text":"A lot like Tijuana Flats, but much better. Very fresh and fast. The meats are all well seasoned and tender, the Pico comes in regular, medium and spicy- mix them for a great flavor on your burrito bowl or taco salad. They do a good take out business, but there's adequate seating. Now, when we came before they had beer, but this trip none, and there's still an issue getting their margarita bar going."}
{"text":"Quickly because I don't have much time. I ordered a veggie nacho, the attendant starts making it without telling me he has no veggies. Another guy asks what else I want and then tells me it will be 5 to 7 minutes before the main part of my request is even ready. I can see why their rating is so low.  I am disappointed and I expected more."}
{"text":"Not impressed with this place. The food was flavorless and bland. Save your money and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Day one!   This place just opened today and I'm fortunate enough to be one of the first few patrons.   This place is a chain and the menu is the same throughout - very similar to Chipotle or Qdoba.   What makes Salsaritas stand apart though is their chips. It's fried and covered with a delicious seasoning Tex-Mex like blend.   I came with a friend during lunch and see myself coming back several more times as it's close to both my house and my job. How lovely!"}
{"text":"Salsarita's is a great place to grab a quick lunch while in a hurry. They've got tasty tacos, burritos and enchiladas, among the other Mexican staples. Fast and Fresh is a good way to describe the food here. It's not 5 star dining, but if there could be a quick way to get Mexican, this is it. You choose your own ingredients, which is even better, and your order is prepared right in front of you which is always good. There always seems to be a line here for lunch, which is a good sign, and the line moves quickly which is even better."}
{"text":"Have been going every week after our Wednesday bike ride.  Recently the service has been slow and the staff seems improperly trained.  Drink machine hadn't been cleaned.  Not sure what's happened but we're not regulars anymore!"}
{"text":"My first ... and prolly my LAST visit.  Thought I would try something new and different for dinner tonight.... (never been to a Salsaritas).  Went to the line to order. As i went down the line I ordered Steak.  The guy said \"That's gonna be a little extra\".  I said, \" that's OK\".   Then i asked for peppers and onions..... \"That's gonna be a little extra\".   Um,  \"OK\".  ......\" I would also like Chips and Guac please\".   He says....\"OK, that's gonna be a little extra\".   I said, \"well, of course it is.  I would expect nothing less.\"    I get to the register and ran up a $15 bill.  Looked at the small portion i got for $15 and thought to myself....\"i hope this is at least somewhat good.\"  It was less than mediocre.  The steak was dry, the queso tasted like sanitizer, the chips were way over salted.  About the only thing that tasted good was the Sweet Tea.  Also, how can they justify $1.50 more for 1 small scoop of Sautéed peppers and onions.  I mean hell, you can get 1 green Pepper and 2 onions for that price at the grocery.  Basically, this is an overpriced fast food Mexican joint lacking a lot of taste to be desired.  Sorry Salsaritas. ....you better up your game for the price."}
{"text":"I've been to this location several times with my employer and the rest of our office staff. It's usually pretty crowded but the employees do the best they can to make sure you are served quickly. Today we were there for Friday lunch and I had a slight problem with my food. I brought it to the attention of an individual cleaning (he may have been a manager, but I'm not sure and I did not catch his name). He was WONDERFUL! He took care of the problem immediately, my food was re-made, I was given a refund and a giftcard (without my asking at all as I did not expect this - I was fine with just having my food re-made). I wish I had seen his name tag so I could recommend that everyone go to this location and be served by this individual, but in the midst of my issue, I failed to see his name tag. In any case, it was a great experience given the situation and I will definitely not be afraid to go back. The food was particularly fresh today too!"}
{"text":"Salsarita's is a semi healthy fast option in the Charlotte airport food court in between the C and D concourses. The menu is pretty limited but it suited my needs.  I got the regular grilled veggie bowl which includes: rice, choice of beans, grilled veggies (unfortunately that consists of only grilled onions and green peppers), choices of salsas, tomato, onions, cheese if you wish, and jalapeños.   The bowl was fresh and pretty tasty although I was disappointed by the \"grilled veggies\" which the name led me to believe there would be a variety of veggies grilled, but nope. Just onions and green peppers. The spicy salsa was however tasty and indeed spicy.   Ordering is quick and the service is ok. It's nothing special but it is a semi decent plant based option."}
{"text":"Long layover & I wanted to eat something that required a fork. Got a small chicken bowl which hit the spot. The chicken was seasoned good. The service was ok. They pushed folks through the line but as a result my bowl had to be made over b/c they added black beans instead of the pinto I requested & then added guacamole without even asking. Me no do guac."}
{"text":"Been here several times and always had good food for good price.  Young staff is always helpful. Tonight's visit signaled that things may be changing - ordered a large burrito, and the amount of meat they put on was not enough to feed a baby, just one small scoop.  In the past they put plenty of meat on so that it seemed the ingredients may bust out of the burrito!  When I questioned the guy making it, he said he could give more only if I paid for double meat.  I did pay for double meat, and got what I used to get everytime.  Looks like somebody is trying to up the profit - however this will assuredly drive away customers."}
{"text":"Overpriced.  If you've been to Chipotle or Qdoba, then you know that this place isn't quite as good.  Maybe I was unlucky or maybe this co. needs to change their training procedure, but my bowl was a little on the skimpy side.  The person that helped me was clearly new since they asked the people around how much of veggies, beans, rice, meat, etc.  Because of that, mine was a little weak.  The chips are ultra-thin so feel especially oily.  I'll avoid Salsarita in the future--no need to tarnish the sterling brand that is Chipotle.  dmo out."}
{"text":"Is 1 star the lowest rating? ICK! Food was gross! Got a chicken quesadilla and it was way too salty, got asked if I want cheese on a quesadilla ..?, and got charged the wrong price! Def NOT a place I'll be eating at again!"}
{"text":"This is a great Salsaritas.  Always clean and the staff is always nice. 3/4 of them always remember my order.  I get the veggie burrito with the flavored sour cream.  The flavored sour cream is delish."}
{"text":"Great fresh food and veggies. First time eating at Sasarita's. Foood has a bit of a kick yet still good."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised with the taste factor from salsaritas,  I've worked near here for 6 years and this is my 2nd visit. Both times I've had the food catered for  work meetings, and the options for the rice bowl are great! Since my diet is pescatarian,  I love the option for shrimp and an ample amount of veggie toppings . Fresh cilantro to top it all off was my icing on my massive bowl , I looooooove fresh herbs !   The line is long during peak lunch hours but I found it moved pretty fast and steady, we arrived at 12:20 and all 5 of us were out by 12:30 . No orders were mixed up or neglected,  and thank you to the employee opening doors for customers with large orders , now that's customer service .   I'll definitely be back , healthy , fresh , and fast,  can't beat that !"}
{"text":"Hello friends,  I think I'm spoiled a little bit with my visits to the \"Uptown\"/\"Downtown\" Salsarita's. I ordered my usual. Nacho's with the nacho's on the side. This keeps my nachos from getting soggy. Well I'm used to getting a BAG full of chips, and a To-Go box full of toppings for the nachos. Welllll, to my dismay I got a Decent amount of nachos & a BOWL full of toppings. As in a BOWL. So I really had to ration my nachos to topping. Very disappointing. BUT, everything was good and nicely prepared.   They moved 1 door down. So now they are not sandwiched between other stores. Now this location. Has the END SPOT. Which is cool because now they have the Outside seating on the side of the building.   Everyone greeted with a smile and seemed eager to help. The manager rushed to change the lemon aid, once he was informed by another patron that it was empty.   I'll try em out again, but I'll try something else.   TTFN"}
{"text":"Overall was hoping for fresher food. Ran here to grab some to go food and even though I was the only person in line to start a few people came behind me and it got disorganized, they kept stopping my order to get others started. Don't know why I had to wait when I was there first, I only ordered for two people, but that had a hard time with that. I got tacos ground beef and the pork. My husband got a chicken burrito. None of the ingredients looked fresh sitting in the pans. The pork had good flavor but was dry, the beef was super salty. I asked for a tub of queso instead of the small sides, they charged me like $12 for the queso ms chips? You mean chips don't come with it? Also, it's hard to mess up cheese dip but theirs really had no flavor at all to it. The only thing that was fresh was the chips."}
{"text":"This place is always delicious.  The staff is friendly and helpful.  I have never had to wait in line long.  I really love the crunchy ground beef tacos!! And the chips are always fresh and delicious!!!"}
{"text":"About every 3-4 weeks I get a burrito here. I have no complaints at all. The food is good quality, and the price is just right for the big burrito with fresh queso and chips! Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"It's always a challenge to find healthy food at the airport. Though the food is average, there are lots of options to customize. Small size is a huge portion. The medium salsa adds a nice kick and really brings up the flavor (regular salsa is bland). A little on the pricey side depending what you get, but overall a great option compared to Cinnabon or Burger King."}
{"text":"We ate here about 1 pm on Sunday, 7.27.14. The food was good - I had the Quesarita... the queso was a bit cold but it was otherwise good.  The young guy who took our order had a great attitude and suggested menu items.  The guy who took our money (looked to be a manager because of shirt) had zero personality - not friendly.  The dining room was busy and pretty dirty.  There were splashes of drink or something on the wall/pictures beside of the booth we ate in; I will go back, but probably for take out."}
{"text":"Fresh, tasty, fast, and cheap!  The staff was awesome. My kid's show fell off (I hadn't noticed) and they brought it out to us in the parking lot!"}
{"text":"Typical fast food Mexican.  Limited menu. Big portions tho. Food was good. I'd go if I had a craving and wanted to keep it on the cheap. They have margheritas, big plus. Manager nice and accomodating. Will go back."}
{"text":"This is yet another location that publicly asks you to contact them about your experience yet never follows up. This is just a front to seem as though management cares. Just a quick note in case you value customer service and quality management."}
{"text":"This place rocks!  It is fast, and yes fresh, and the food is really good and cheap!  i went here with the grandparents and kids, and there is something for everyone!  2 thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Love fresh food? Mexican? and good sized meals? Check this place out then. They even serve beer too and have daily specials."}
{"text":"It's a chain...most of you should have run into one by now. I like their burrito bowl (think naked burrito, i.e. burrito minus the tortilla), their salads, and they've got some pretty bangin quesadillas. Their steak is good (have yet to try any of the rest but I'm told chicken is good as well). I recommend."}
{"text":"Usually have a decent experience here, but not tonight. I went there around dinner time, so you would think they would be ready with everything made right? Nope. We had to wait for many toppings to be re-stocked/ made. I.T took forever for them to make our food and we were the only ones in there. The workers seemed even annoyed that we were there. Also, I didn't even finish my burrito because the chicken looked and tasted weird."}
{"text":"I was a bit hesitant about this place. It was pretty full of preppy kids all out getting drunk. But then, every other place nearby was the same thing due to the NCAA Play Offs down the street.  Well, I ended up in a secluded corner on the second floor. Despite the crowds and the fact that she had a twelve person table next door, the server was actually quite attentive.   Drinks were reasonably priced. And the food, while not even close to authentic Mexican, was enjoyable. There were a lot of enjoyable flavor combinations that went down quite well.   I will visit again when I'm in town."}
{"text":"Meh... Food is ok, amount for money is good, service is ok. I'm not a fan of dirty tables, front glass doors & the men's bathroom. That tells me this place could be better and might not take care of the food I'm eating. (RED flag)"}
{"text":"This place is a fine example of terrible management, there were two women working their butts off trying to be as nice as possible while they clearly needed assistance because the line was about 12-15 deep. They were both working past their scheduled time as the manager walked in and stood there with 4 half made burritos while one girl went and refilled sour cream and the other girl was on the register. I stood there waiting while my burrito got cold and wondered how long the manager would stand in the front and NOT help out. He never did, even after the girls expressed their need for assistance. Another employee who just got in shift put his drawer down to help and the manager said \"no, you cant leave your drawer out here\"... Look.. Just help your staff and help the customer. You might be in 'charge' but theres nothing admirable about a manager who gives orders without lending a helping hand... Especially at a busy airport. You will mever build a strong business or team with that kind of work ethic, youre lucky your staff didn't walk out on you."}
{"text":"The staff was very helpful and I relied on them for suggestions since I hardly ever make my way here... They set me up with some delicious lunch, too... I ordered the brisket tacos when I saw them on the screen behind the ordering bar...   The tortillas tasted fresh, the brisket was well seasoned and even though I took the tacos to go (and they had a \"superhot\" sauce, grilled onions, cilantro and cheese), they were not all wet and icky which was incredibly impressive... I ordered the hottest sauce they have and it barely had a kick to it in my opinion... Don't get me wrong, it was good, but I was expecting a lot more spice...  Candyce B was right, guys... Do not skip the queso... The chips were pretty run of the mill, though...   Lastly, the price was a bit high...  Over $8 for two tacos, a drink and queso?  Maybe I'm crazy, but that's a little steep for lunch... At least for me, so I definitely wouldn't do this frequently, but it hit the spot today... And it's good to know that tasty food is waiting for you whenever you need it..."}
{"text":"attitude the employees have makes you lose your appetite portions are extremely tiny for the price they are charging its total ripoff and it's this particular location never going back"}
{"text":"Honestly I really can't say if I will ever return to this location or not.  Today was my first experience at this location,  I came here for two reasons:  1. I was in the area and said to myself \"Why Not\" 2.  I signed up for their eClub and received an offer for a free order of Chips and Queso(My favorite) which my offer was due to expire today.  I placed my order and walked over to the register to show the employee my email and she didn't seem pleased.  I understand some companies do not like to give away free items.  If that's case with Salsarits's than why offer free food when you sign up for the eClub!?  Or maybe the employee just had an attitude. Needless to say, I'm not sure if I will return to this location especially when there is one located near my house and Salsarita's are one of the vendors at my job on Tuesdays so I do have other options."}
{"text":"**Graphic TMI Alert**  OK, so basically this is a Chipotle type restaurant.  If you aren't familiar with Chipotle, where have you been for the past ten years because it is the greatest place on Earth?!  Burritos/tacos/taco salads.  S.R. is basically the same besides the fact that the food is much worse.  Bad guacamole, bad queso, and gross meats.  The only good things about this place were that it was clean, relatively cheap, and you don't have fiery \"aftermath\"  (Think about that one).   Honestly, I will pay the \"Montezuma's Revenge\" price for the deliciousness of Chipotle rather than going back here again.    All that being said, I still ate my whole burrito and chips & guac.  It was only good because I was starving.  All I'm saying is... Use your cool new smart phone device thingy and type in C-H-I-P-O-T-L-E and drive to that dot instead.  Trust me!   Enjoy :)  -Ian M."}
{"text":"The food was fresh & good, unfortunately the service was lacking. Also when we returned to get refills we were rudely told there would be an additional charge. In a food court full of other options I will take my business next door to Firehouse."}
{"text":"I enjoy this place because it's always clean, the staff is friendly, and the food is always great. I enjoy the quesorita. So delicious! Perfect when I need a queso fix!"}
{"text":"I've been to Salsarita's many times. It is your standard American/Mexican interpretation as seen at Moe's, Johnny Burritos, Qudoba, etc...   I went to Salsarita's for lunch after yoga for a meal. What I like about Salsarita's offering is simply as follows:  1. They use good non-iceberg lettuce 2. They have black olives 3. They have shrimp and it's good!! Weird to get shrimp at one of these places perhaps, but not for me. 4. Fresh cilantro, guac and accoutrements 5. Good salad bowls with lots of healthy options   The one not-so-good there is the queso and not sure if this has changed over time. It is the yellow kind that used to be given to you when you ordered nachos at the movie theatre as a kid."}
{"text":"Eh, Chiptole is way better. I had somewhat avoided this place from the Charlotte airport and seeing it around Charlotte.  This location was \"factory like\" just like Chipotle, but something made me feel like it wasn't fresh and that it was contributing to obesity in America. Ugh, I don't know...just didn't love it.  This location seems legit, minus the tables are SUPER close to each other. This is the South, not NYC."}
{"text":"I've been to this place over 100 times over the years of working uptown and just checked in for the first time. The staff here is great and friendly, the service is quick and its not very pricey. I love the chips and salsa and Mexican pizza and come quiet often for the breakfast."}
{"text":"Best fast food nachos... I enjoy the pork or their ground beef. They have a lot of salsa choices, black beans and refried beans... their queso beats out other comparable places like Qdoba (chipotle has chips but doesnt serve nachos, go figure). The staff is friendly and there usually it not a wait. Good value for the money."}
{"text":"If you are taking the food to go, check it first! My husband got us two orders of chips and queso. You can see from the picture that one bag has very little and the other bag barely has anything. You can see my table through the bottom of the bag! I took that picture before we ate anything out of it. What a ripoff. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"I really like the food here but they lose a star for their staff. I always get take out so the staff won't keep me from coming back when I need a Mexican fix. I love that I can choose all the ingredients to create my own dish.   Management does need to do something about their unprofessional employees. They are always playing and talking back and forth instead of 100% focusing on the customer in front of them."}
{"text":"Knowing my love for Salsarita's on Rea Road, a coworker and I decided to head there for lunch. We arrived shortly after 12 and, like others have mentioned, the line was out the entryway.  However, even though the line was long it moves smoothly and didn't take too long.  Salsarita's has a rhytmn that seems to work, like an assembly line. I ordered the two taco combo with chips and queso, and a side of salsa.  I chose two soft tacos, which are steamed and topped with a meat, of which I chose chicken and pulled pork. Onto the toppings, lettuce, jalepeno, sour cream, guacamole and cheese to complete my order.  The chicken, just like the other location was great and the pulled pork was awesome, I wil definitely try that again.  The chips were fresh, some with a little extra seasoning that I love.  The queso was a little cold, but overall good.  A definite great spot for lunch, but may need to think about getting there a few minutes before 12, just to get ahead the large crowd."}
{"text":"After reading Candyce & Amy's reviews, I had to check it out. And, all I can say is they were right. The staff was very friendly & the line moved quickly. I ordered the 2 taco special with queso and salsa. I chose chicken tacos & the chicken was grilled to perfection, and they are not skimpy with the servings! The taco shell was heated to perfection and the additions I chose made it great. The chips had a great seasoning and matched perfectly with the salsa and queso. Although I usually do not enjoy fast food Mexican, Salsaritas does not fit in that category. It was much better & I will be back!"}
{"text":"Given the fact that this is airport food,  they actually did the brand justice. I ordered a small chicken burrito and it was tasty. I also got chips and hot salsa. The salsa had the spice and was flavorful. The chicken in the burrito was flavorful as well. I was impressed!"}
{"text":"Decent Mexican fast food and reasonably priced for airport food. I got a tasty steak taco salad in an edible bowl for about what a Qdoba burrito costs in most places. Service was a bit inattentive and could've been faster, plus they were out of napkins and to-go boxes, but overall one of the better airport restaurant experiences I've had."}
{"text":"Quick Casual Mexican food might be the best way to challenge your intestines during your 2pm meeting.  Salsaritas consistently delivers decent quality offerings.  The most surprising thing about this particular location is their ability to turn over the sheer volume that they do.  You walk by the line out the door at the lunch time rush and think 'no way am I waiting in line for that...' but low and behold, the line moves remarkably quick, and you're in and out with your taco salad in just a few minutes.  It's not a wow-factory, but sure does bring to mind the massive innovations Henry Ford brought to the assembly line."}
{"text":"First time ever eating salaritas so I didn't really know what to get/eat or how it's made.... The lady who made my food was sooo rude, rolled her eyes at me because I changed up my order... it was bad! I had this page pulled up before I left the restaurant because I HAD to share my experience"}
{"text":"My wife and I had boats, mine had chicken and hers was vegetarian. Both were really good and fresh. But more importantly the service was great and the two behind the counter were super nice and helpful."}
{"text":"Stopped in at the Salsarita off of S Tryon to grab a quick bite to eat.  I haven't been in here in awhile but I remembered that they charged extra to get sauteed vegetable on my chicken nachos, which is what I usually order.  O-kay so first off it's kinda a full house. The line is long but it's moving.  First thing is first, please do not try to take my order if I'm not up there to actually see you apply it to my food.  Salsarita is like Subway and you tell them what you would like to go on you tacos/nachos/or whatever it is that you order.  So how am I suppose to tell you what I want when I'm at laest three people behind and not even up there to look at the choices.  I had to repeat myself so many times that I was starting to forget if I had actually told them to add this or that.  Then they charge for every little thing now.  It was extra for my vegetables, extra for the queso, extra for the black beans...I don't want plain nachos! When you get up there to pay that was also a nightmare.  They started off by trying to give your food to other people, because like I said you're taking people's order who aren't even up to the glass yet so once they do get up to the right spot, their food is at the cash register...not feeling it.  I don't like my food just sitting there so strangers can breathe all over it after you keep trying to hand them the wrong thing.  Once it was my turn to pay; for me and my bf (who also got a chicken nacho) and one soda, we were looking at a little over $20.00 dollars!  WTH I paid took my food to a table and then noticed that one of the servers, the one who kept asking me if I wanted \"Queso?\" and me telling her that she has already put some on mine, had litterally drenched the chips with queso cheese so they were soggy...not one dry chip anywhere.  Needless to say it will be awhile before I come back here...IF I ever do.  I can make better nachos at home n e way :("}
{"text":"I haven't been to a Salsaritas in a while, so I thought I would renew my experience. This is one of those places where they assemble it in front of you, sort of like a Subway of burrtos. They also offer quesadillas, tacos and salads. The Mexican pizza is something I've not seen at other places.  Otherwise, it's the same as other places. Chicken, beef, pork, etc. Guacamole, salsa, other veggies and the same.  The seating area in this one is interesting. It's more cantina-like with the usual booths and tables, but also a small bar area with a half-dozen seats there. Plus some seats outside.  It's okay, but I prefer the salsa bar that they have at Moe's.  Warning: The chips and salsa/queso are extra. It's a clever upsell, since they ask if you want salsa or queso and you might not be aware that it's a combo. But the chips I had were good. Nice and crispy with the right amount of salt."}
{"text":"Spicy or not spicy, Salsarita's is a great and quick place for lunch. Typical of this food style (like Moe's and Qdoba), it's an assembly line of meat, veggies and then salsa in a burrito or a salad. It's nice to be able to see your food prepared right in front of you so you can see exactly what's going on and ask for more (or less) of any particular item.  I'm a big fan of the grilled chicken burrito, which has an excellent spicy taste, especially when you go with the medium or spicy salsa and add some of the made-in-the-store guacamole. Rolled up, it's always just barely big enough to fit inside the soft tortilla shell. My wife prefers the fresh grilled chicken quesadilla with the corn salsa and a zesty cheese.  The soda fountain has Coke products (including Coke Zero) but I usually end up with the 5 calorie Lemonade which I refill to go.  Unfortunately, they are not open on Sundays (possibly because they're surrounded by mostly office parks?).  Very friendly staff and the place is always clean and tidy. A couple of TV's are usually tuned into CNN or Fox News. There is more than enough seating and I think there's some outdoor seating in the back overlooking the Tyvola and Yorkmont intersection. Sadly, the angle isn't very good for seeing anything flying into or out of CLT."}
{"text":"Salsarita's is a regular stop for me and the kids.  We all get the kids meals.  For me, that is all the food I can eat (or rather, that I need to eat).  The meal comes with a hard or soft taco with chicken or beef and fixin's of your choice, chips, a cookie, and a small drink.  All for less than $5!  Service is fast so if you're starving, you won't have a long wait to fill your tummy.  Salsarita's also has food to go for large parties - great for when unexpected guests arrive."}
{"text":"This is supposed to be a fast food but I waited 25 minutes in line.  Employees were moving in slow motion.  Need to get some energy drinks there people!!!"}
{"text":"Starting with Eddy, the very friendly general manager, and on to the efficient staff it only gets better from there with the consistently great food.  Yes, this is Mexican fast food but it is always tasty and well-presented in a pleasant, clean atmosphere."}
{"text":"we had salasritas catered for a meeting recently for lunch and it was extremely salty. the chips and avocado and liquid cheese was good. everything else was overly seasoned - chicken/beef for the tacos. they helped us set up and kept the food warm for us, it was tasty for the most part but also unbearably salty so we kept drinking water."}
{"text":"I went to this Salsaritas for the first and most likely last time tonight. Like the previous reviews state, the service was awful. Much different experience than I have had at other locations. Wait was long, staff was unfriendly and clearly did not pay attention."}
{"text":"Super nice staff, awesome burrito, and great price! This was a nice surprise to find at the airport because I was starving and didn't feel like paying a million dollars for half of a crappy sandwich with very little meat on it. I'd highly recommend for a guy who is looking for a high protein meal that's under ten bucks at the airport."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with my best friend and was horribly disappointed.  Aside from the floor being hella sticky, the food was cold and bland as hell( I got a chicken burrito bowl with everything on it) Idk how many packets of salt I went though just to make it palatable.  The guacamole was GROSS. I never thought I'd EVER say that about guacamole because I LIVE for guac, but I mean...as a \"Mexican\" food chain how the hell do you mess up guacamole? It had no flavor. No lime, no salt, no pepper....nothing. Smh. If we had eaten the food there I would've given it back and gotten my money back, but unfortunately we had to get on the road. With as many people as we usually see in there, I would've expected for the food to be a whole lot better. Too bad. Should've went to Panera."}
{"text":"First visit tonight. I, know. Fast food, chain and all that. But food was fantastic as was the service. A great place to get a quick Mexican meal."}
{"text":"Yikes... as much as I frequent this place, I am puzzled as to why I haven't reviewed it - or maybe I reviewed another location by accident.  Anyways....  This location at Overstreet is super convenient to my office so I do get breakfast AND lunch here often.  During the lunch rush, this place can be a mad-house with the line that stretches from the start of the counter out into the Overstreet mall main drag.  There is a dividing wall to keep it all together and make sure no one jumps the line and they recently added some extra pony walls for the dine-in guests to have more privacy and more crowd control (my bet).  The folks working the line are always nice and the line moves fast (if customers know what they want and how the system works).  This location also does breakfasts and lunches for offices so sometimes you can see the booths on the side of the restaurant are occupied by items for catering."}
{"text":"Good food but staff is very stingy when it comes to the ingredients. Been there 3 times now and only once did I have a good experience with a friendly staff member who actually seemed to want you to have a great dining experience. Otherwise good food and nice, clean restaurant."}
{"text":"It costs too much, the food sits all day, and they charge for anything.  You ask for one more olive...that's 25 cents.  I could go to Chipotle and receive a better product.  TV's in the resturant shouldn't constitute for higher prices with the sub par food that is being served. They skimp on everything so you have to ensure that they make your food correctly.  The taco bowls just sit in the open subjected to flies or any other pests that may be around.  The chips are not crunchy and the queso is very over priced.  The only positive thing about this spot is the nicely chopped lettuce and Tabasco (which was used to cover up the taste of the food).  Overall, there are better choices if your looking for a quick tex-mex fix...hit Chipotle and get more bang for your buck!  If you do take a chance...don't say I didn't warn you."}
{"text":"Fresh food, customer service is ok.  Parking can be congested at times.  There is a small bar area and outside eating area.  Employees always eating and drinking behind the counter every time I come.  They should eat in the back or sit in dining area.  Not professional seeing someone stuff their face before they serve you.  Daily specials, We'd. is nacho day!  An ok place for lunch."}
