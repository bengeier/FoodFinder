{"text":"I went for the Smelt Fry after being told it is a must to do. I have to say it was a great deal of fun and the food was great. Go early and relax. You will wait but there is a reason for that.   Sometimes it might be wise to not worry about having to wait for a table an wiser to wonder why you are not having to wait at another place?"}
