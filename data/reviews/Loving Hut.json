{"text":"I have been coming here for almost 20 years. I followed them from 7th ave. I still, and always will, know them as \"Supreme Master.\" These people are the best, the first, the only true vegetarian Chinese/Vietnamese place in the valley (please let me know, yelpers, if there are more!).
I've staged breakups here, and first dates. I had my 18 year old birthday party here. And my 30th. I didn't tell my relatives it was Vegan. They never asked.

In all of the cases, DO NOT UNDERORDER!

Through tears and heirs, order the extra mu shu. Don't forget the lemongrass chicken (an order per person), sizzling rice soup, and the New York charm.
I have one rule here: always leave with leftovers. They usually don't make it to the fridge, let alone the next day.
Oh, and take kick of religion in stride.
Chopsticks optional."}
{"text":"pretty good vegetarian food, though I wish they'd expand their menu to more natural foods as that goes hand it hand for me in regard to eating healthy.

overall though, I'd recommend em"}
{"text":"This place is a great vegan (Asian inspired) place to avoid the insanity and wait times of Fresh next door. It's not too expensive and the food was quite good! It's kind of a \"no frills\" vegan place but you can eat for 10-15$. Don't expect nice decor or presentation, but the great prices, no wait and good food make up for that.  It weirded me out that no one was in it, so maybe that's because Fresh is next door?"}
{"text":"Love, Love, Love this placee!!!  I would give it more stars if that was possible.

My meat-eating family loves it just as much as me.  We have eaten off the menu and from the buffet.  The menu has almost too many wonderful things to choose from and the buffet is stocked with lots of great dishes, soup, salad, fruit, and cake.  Other than the perfectly-seasoned, creative, and delicious food, the restaurant, and most imprtantly, the bathroom, is spotless.  Great job!"}
{"text":"I'm not a vegetarian and I thought it was good. I wouldn't do it everyday though. Defeats being a vegetarian if  ordering imitation chicken."}
{"text":"Like an adopted child caught between two parents, I am still undecided whether I really like this place or if it's just \"alright\".

One thing that has my briefs in a twist is that it is HELLA FAR. It is near the airport, which for some would be convenient but considering most vegheads in the PGH (more like 99%) live in the city or Braddock, it's a little inconvenient.

Additionally, I am going to address the white elephant in the room, the restaurant is a franchise and is a part of the Supreme Master Ching Hai International Association, thus constant sensory bombardment of \"go veg\" informercials and semi-eschatological warnings of our impending doom. But personally it's better than Steely Dan or some New Age crystal healing tune that makes you think you're in a spa.

Despite this, it is possibly the only 100% Viet-veg restaurant in Pittsburgh or Western Pennsylvania for that matter, meaning that if you want meat, this place ain't your jams. 
However, if you're down for some new grub or want to support a local veg restaurant, this place is where its at. They also have weekly (monthly?) buffets, which are a little \"hit or miss\", but I commend them for their effort."}
{"text":"Fast, friendly and attentive service, hot and tasty food. What more could you want? Would definitely recommend for vegan/vegetarians, and for people who might need convincing that vegan food can taste good. The fries are really good"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised at how good the food tasted. Asian flavors were spot on with the pad thai and bun. Next time will have to try a burger, it looked real good. Will come back for sure. Lose one star for slow service, not the sole servers fault, i think they only had one cook. Worth the wait though."}
{"text":"I am super disappointed with Loving Hut these days. Oh, when the shine comes off the newness... Actually, I think there's been a change of ownership. This place has been consistently really good for the past few years and then, Bam! One day I walk in and yup, something's wrong, no warm, strong aroma of blended spices. I pick up the menu and it's abbreviated, turned into an acronym of its former self. Worst yet, what's still left on offer has lost its flavour. Once again, food assembly, speed and the bottom line has become the goal. Less for more, sorry Loving Hut, I'm breaking up with you."}
{"text":"I go there every time I'm in town and have the time. I love the spring rolls and usually get the lemon grass chicken. It is some of my favorite vegan food I have ever had. Try the desert as well, it is delicious."}
{"text":"You need to go to Loving Hut. Stop what you are doing right now and go! Seriously, this is one of my top restaurants, ever. The food here is for the most part healthy, but SO flavorful. If you are unsure of meat substitutes, try the Saturday buffet where you can sample the different types and styles, and the vegan cake.

I thought tofu couldn't get any better than Mad Mex's and I was b*tch-slapped by LH for this thought. I lied, LH would not do that. They are as hippy as can be infused into Asain-style food in a super-clean, minimalistic white decor Austin Powers would love.

The staff and owner are very nice people and I'm thrilled they opened LH in Pittsburgh area. 

If I HAD to give a suggestion it would be to add more lighting over the sink in the ladie's room."}
{"text":"As someone not very familiar with vegan food, I absolutely love this place.  Its very clean inside, the food is REALLY flavorful and the owners seem very nice.  They could probably improve slightly on their service and recognize that most people want a knife to eat with - but other than that.....SOOOOOO Good and its pretty cheap at about $9.95 per plate.  They give plenty of food to eat - and I am a big eater.  This is actually one of my two favorite restaurants.  I have been there twice in the past two weeks.  The Chow Mein is FULL of veggies and tofu (which I had for the first time and loved).  VERY YUM!  I had a BBQ type dish called \"Grilled Sensation\"  the first time I went and it was absolutely fabulous as well :).  My husband got it when I took him and he loved it as well.

The decor is minimalistic - but pretty.  Kinda of modern with Ikea type white chairs and white tables with yellow walls and daisies and a candle at each table :)  Even my husband complimented that it was pretty...LOL

I do need to mention that they do seem to have some weird religious channel showing at all times - but I wasn't there to watch T.V. so it didn't bother me."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch and dinner if you are vegetarian and vegan! Amazing organic food options and wonderful taste. Ample dining space and perfection service. Visit once and I bet you will be regular."}
{"text":"I am a vegetarian. I also have severe nut allergies. Never in my life have I been able to pick up a menu and safely order ANYTHING from it. Needless to say, I was more than a little excited to check this place out after learning everything was vegan and nut-free.

Thanks to the Loving Hut, I had Pad Thai for the first time in my life! Granted, I've never had ACTUAL Pad Thai, so I can't compare it in terms of authenticity... but the dish I had, truly similar or not, was absolutely delicious. There were three or four different kinds of veggie protein in there, tons of different textures, some crunch and some flavor, and it was supremely satisfying (though not spicy at all.)

I was supposed to be sharing with my boyfriend, but I ate the whole thing myself (whoops) - he got a dish that I can't quite recall the name of, cold and spicy soy protein over marinated chopped veggies like celery, peppers, etc. It was decent, but it paled in comparison to the Pad Thai. We got the summer rolls too, and they were good, although somewhat bland.

We'll definitely be back here... at least for some more Pad Thai, and to give me the comfort of knowing the food I order won't inadvertently kill me. Yum!"}
{"text":"Winner.

You want healthy?  You got it.
You want vegetarian/vegan?  You got it.
You want your food to taste amazing?  You got it.
Service?  You guessed it.

A spicy cha cha might sound like something you might want to avoid, but don't look over this menu item at Loving Hut.  I don't even remember what was in it, and frankly I don't care... it was simply amazing.

Start with a variety of the spring/summer/egg rolls and get a few different dishes, because you're going to want to try as many as possible.

Next time I will definitely start with dessert.  I could see how you'd always end up too full after dinner, but they look too amazing to miss."}
{"text":"Our server was quite rude. It was our first time visiting the restaurant and it was during their Saturday buffet. She brought out waters and said we could head up to the buffet. The food was gross. My friend who has tried a lot of vegan restaurants said this was probably some of the worst vegan food she has tried. When we left, we realized there was a full menu that we could have ordered from - which would have been nice to have a choice, considering that my friend would have ordered an entree that wasn't available on the buffet. Plus, they had smoothies and we both would have ordered one of those. I feel like if our server didn't make us feel like a burden we would have enjoyed the experience, and possibly the food (from menu), better than we did."}
{"text":"I am so torn about this place. On one hand, as a vegetarian, do I want a little place serving all vegan food in the middle of the culinary wasteland that is Robinson to succeed? Absolutely. But on the other, I'm rather scared of cults. And there is definitely a creepy vibe here.

We ordered the crispy rolls and the summer rolls. The crispy rolls didn't seem all that different to me than regular veggie spring rolls (they just taste fried). The summer rolls, however, were excellent-- really fresh, and served with great peanut sauce. My entree was on the specials list, and I've forgotten the exact name but it's something like Sweet and Sour Divine. That was great-- very fresh veggies and soy \"meat\" in a sweet pineapple-y sauce. My husband got something called Guru Curry, which was good, but spicy as all hell. I couldn't have eaten very much of it.

But as everyone else has mentioned, they have two giant TVs showing a very cult-ish TV channel. It has subtitles in about 17 languages (not kidding). It reminds me of something from Idiocracy. Fortunately the sound is off, but still, you're watching something called \"Supreme Master TV\" while you're eating dinner, and that kind of ruined it for me. The all-white color scheme didn't bug me-- it just looked clean, which is always a plus in my book. But yeah, mega cult vibe... not going back."}
{"text":"The service can be slow but the food is worth the wait!! The Spicy ChaCha should not be missed!!"}
{"text":"I love this place, from the cult, to the eerie 80s decor, to the interesting conversations I overheard...it all just makes me laugh...but the food is good and it's cheap. I mean I don't see myself following Supreme Master Ching Hai anytime soon, but I appreciate a good vegetarian restaurant."}
{"text":"Loving Hut is an excellent addition to the few vegan dining options in Pittsburgh.  Hooray!  The dishes at Loving Hut are Asian/Vietnamese inspired.  My wife and I started with the drumstick appetizer (a crispy panko coated big thin wrapper roll filled with sprouts and mushrooms) and fresh summer rolls.  I ordered the drumstick because it looked like nothing I've seen before.  It was awesome--crisp on the outside and filled with yummy veg inside.  We opted to try entrees with mock meats and were not disappointed.  The menu also has many tofu and fresh vegetable options.  She ordered the Loving Hut Special Noodle w/rolls which is basically a vegan version of  vietnamese rice noodle w/mixed meats and crispy spring rolls (Bun).  I've had the meat version of this at other places and the flavors were on target.  Their soy BBQ meat had great texture.  The rolls were awesome and the nuoc cham sauce was just right.  I had the Lucky Lemongrass which was a crispy soy chicken with spicy chilis.  This was excellent and full flavored although I think they should include a dipping sauce (suggest soy/vinegar) with it since it was a bit dry (nonetheless I ate it all because it tasted great).  They also have vegan desserts like soy cheesecake which I will be sure to get when we visit again."}
{"text":"I always get the pad thi and it is truly delicious. You can also call in ahead of time and pick up your order. They have really good lunch specials and the soups are wonderful. The portions are generous and you won't leave feeling hungry. I feel the price is fair for what you get."}
{"text":"Amazing food!  This is a great place for everyone--vegans, vegetarians, and meat-eaters. I'm vegan, and my boyfriend is an omnivore. We both love eating here. My favorite entree is the Lucky Lemon Grass which has soy chicken with lots of flavor and a crispy coating. I've also had these items, and they were also very good: Loving Hut Special Rolls and Fresh Summer Rolls. My boyfriend loves the Spicy Cha Cha which has vegan shrimp. The vegan shrimp is battered and fried. He's allergic to shrimp, but he loves the taste and he said this is very similar to the real deal. For dessert I LOVE the vegan cheesecake. It is so creamy and rich. I love this place! And I love being able to order anything I want from the menu without having to ask if it's vegan!"}
{"text":"Today was another first for me, vegan food. I have a few friends that went through a vegetarian phase for a few years so meals without meat aren't completely foreign to me. I actually quite like tofu dogs and Boca burgers. However I have never had a completely vegan meal, so when I saw there was a pretty highly rated all vegan place close to my house I thought it would be worth a try.

The restaurant was called The Loving Hut, located in Robinson, an area full of many different places to eat. I dragged Kandace along with me because she hasn't ever had anything close to vegan so I figured it would be a big change for her. Upon looking at the menu we were both slightly worried. There was a lot of soy chicken, and soy pork. As a rule of thumb I generally try to stay away from anything soy trying to impersonate meat. It's normally a let down, but since this lunch was all about trying new things we both went with soy chicken meals. She got the Tangy Orange and I got the Lucky Lemon Grass. One thing on the menu we both felt was a pretty safe bet was the rolls they had for appetizers. We both agreed that the Loving Hut Special Roll sounded the best out of the ones they had available. 

One thing I do have to say first is that the Loving Hut is extremely quick. It took no more then five minutes for us to get our appetizers and our meals came out less then five minutes after that. It was a nice change from most places I eat. Now on to the reviews.

The Loving Hut Special Roll:


The roll was pretty good. There was a large piece of tofu in the middle of each which kind of threw off Kandace. It was her first experience with tofu and the texture takes a little bit to get used to, but she seemed to adjust. There was a pretty leafy taste; at first it reminded me of just plain lettuce but it also had a slight mint taste to it. Dunking them in the sauce was a must as it added a lot of taste. The sauce was really delicious. It was obviously soy sauce based but had a nice peanut flavor as well as a good bit of sweet and spice. I enjoyed them.

Lucky Lemon Grass:


My first thought when I saw my meal was \"God that looks dry\", and I was right in that assumption. It was also nearly impossible to cut with just a fork. I ended up ripping apart pieces with my hands most of the time. There was a lot of flavors but it was all spice. I'm a fan of proper spice but I don't like when all I can taste is spice. That's how this \"chicken\" was. It really didn't do much for me. I figured dipping in the sauce would help with the dryness and the spice but it really didn't. The sauce was pretty sweet but the spice completely voided any taste of it. The soy also did not suck up any of the sauce at all so it was still dry. At least the rice was good. 

The Rating:

Was it filling?: I almost stopped for a double cheeseburger on the way home, so no.

Did I feel gross afterwards?: No, I honestly just felt tired.  

Would I eat it again?: The rolls: Yes. The \"chicken\": No

Would I go there again?: No, it just really wasn't my sort of thing."}
{"text":"This place is awesome  whether you are vegan or not. Great food and is a favorite  in an area known for  great restaurants."}
{"text":"This place is great for vegans and those who really care about what you're putting into your body.  Quite and quaint, great prices and a friendly staff make this a regular spot for me!"}
{"text":"Food here is always very very good. I am In love with the Lemon Grass Chicken. So good, the wait for food can be very long, sometimes that's ok, but sometimes you have to go back to work or have other things todo. it's really a hit or miss for me because of the time thing. I will most likely be back, but will gripe about the service, if it's bad."}
{"text":"Great vegan cuisine !!!!!
Everybody is nice prompt and courteous"}
{"text":"Loving Hut, I love you. I have been enjoying this restaurant for over 15 years (formerly the Vegetarian House). Years later I see familiar faces still working there, smiling and hospitable. This is probably the original vegan restaurant in the valley, and has never disappointed me!"}
{"text":"Good food -  loved the drumsticks. Pho was not my taste re the flavor,  and not as chock full as I'd like,  but wow -  to get off the plane hungry and find a perfectly good vegan place 10m away? Amazing!"}
{"text":"Not wheelchair accessible and no handicap parking spaces. Fail! We have contacted this business twice, beginning July 2014, and still no w/c parking."}
{"text":"This restraunt had the most Delitious deserts i have ever tasted vegan or non vegan! Their german chocolate icecream was the best out of the five different cake i tried there, even though all the othe cakes were delicious too! The drumsticks were also wonderful, and their sauces for all their dishes are the best! I am going back for on my birthday, that just how good it is!"}
{"text":"Probably the best place I've gone to for vegan food. Absolutely delicious. Great service too. Just wish they weren't an hour away!"}
{"text":"Of course this place gets all stars from me.

Lemongrass chicken is probably my idea of Grand Master Flash Heaven. Speaking of Heaven, also try the Seventh Heaven Salad rolls thingies.

Service is slow but by the time I think about it I'm too busy concentrating on the infomercial/yoga session video of the Supreme Goddess Master on the big screen, who never seems to age. Maybe they just switch her out when the last one dies.... Plus there are ALWAYS weird-looking people sitting nearby who order it up something ferocious, and it's fun to discuss what they could possibly do for a J.O.B. with those white-people dreads.

That is not to say that service isn't good, because it is.

I couldn't believe it, but someone who went to the Veg House with me actually decided right then and there that he liked tofu. He had never had it before that day, save for a few nightmares, which is just unfair.

I do wish it were open more, though. Kind of a PITA to drive up only to find the place locked."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place.  Though the menu does vary quite a bit in tastiness, if you get any dish they say is popular, you'll be happy."}
{"text":"Pretty awesome little vegan restaurant in Robinson. 

Not very busy when my lady and I went, so our food came promptly. For an appetizer, we got the Loving Hut Special Rolls which were a yummy way to start the meal. You get a decent amount for your money as well. 

The entree I selected was the Lucky Lemongrass. IT WAS SO GOOD. A big portion as well! I could barely finish. 

The decor is pretty neat as well. It kept me motivated to maintain my vegan lifestyle. 

Check out this joint if you're in Robinson and are looking for some great eats!"}
{"text":"Deeelicious food!  I make it a habit to try out the local vegan restaurant options, and this place was a winner with everything we ordered.  My 6 year old absolutely loved the veggie burger, which is always a plus.  My only complaint is that the waitress seemed a little pushy to get us to order more food and dessert, and service was a bit slow considering there were not many patrons at the time we were there."}
{"text":"On a recent visit to Phoenix, my vegetarian boyfriend and I were told that this was the place to go.  At first he was excited to have an entire menu to order from.  We ordered spring rolls, hot and sour soup, general tsos and....I can't even remember what I got.  All of the flavors were bland and even though he asked for his general tsos to be extra spicy, it didn't make a dent in the scoville scale.

The tea was good and the staff were helpful and quick.  The atmosphere very relaxing.  We really wanted to like this place, but left extremely let down.  Hope your experience is much more satisfying."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times and I love it!
The service is amazing. (I love those girls!) They're very knowledgeable about the menu, and they're always really sweet. 
The atmosphere is cool too....if you can get over the weird religious/cult offerings on the tv... (or the Asian version of the home shopping channel) that runs steady on their televisions. (It's either or ...)

The only time I have not LOVED my Loving Hut experience, was when I ordered the BBQ & Spring Roll Noodles. On the website, it looks delicious! But, when I got it, it only had 2 (really small) spring rolls, NO SAUCE, and only a bit of the TVP BBQ strips. The salad was drenched in cilantro (blech)... and I couldn't even eat it.

I ended up eating off of my boyfriends plate, which was GREAT :) (He ordered the Club Sandwich and Fries). Sooooooooooooooo good. I will definitely get that next time.

Oh ... and the Pad Thai and Onion Rings are delicious too. 

Wish they had a liquor license, but but it seems as though people think that Vegan's don't drink.

Believe me, they do! 

Awesome place though. Just don't get the BBQ plate ;)"}
{"text":"While in Pittsburgh I found this place typing in vegetarian restaurants near the hotel i was staying at.  I dont like to get lost when I'm in another state or town so i read the review on how to find it.  Traveling on toward 60 North, i turned left on Campbells Run Rd (Sheetz on the corner), then left on the 1st light and right into the hilly plaza.  Came here on Monday for dinner and it was closed.  That was fine because i had a backup restaurant in Robinson area so went to Olive Garden instead.  Came back Tuesday evening.


I was the only one in there but when i left a couple came in.  I ordered for take-out the lucky lemongrass, loving hut spring rolls and pandan cake.  The lady said it would take 10 min.  While waiting she let me taste a scrape (the bottom of another cake that was taken out already) of the pandan cake,  because i couldnt decide between that or carrot.  


I got the pandan because of the sample i tried the flavor was good and the color was interesting.  It was a good choice =)  The vegan frosting had good flavor.  

The soy chicken was tasty, perfectly fried, light and crisp and went well with the lemongrass spice rub.  The brown rice was light and fluffy.  Fresh cut tomatos and cucmbers come with the dish and i asked for extra (to have some vegetables for the meal) which i got no problem.  I could tell they made their food with love! =)  

I forgot to look at the ceiling because another review i read said they have a design with blue lights!  

When i get back to california, i'll probably try another dish at one of their locations there"}
{"text":"Me and my lady's favorite spot.  The food has flavor, and surprisingly Vegan.  You can easily have a great experience here if you're not vegan.  Recommend the Pad Thai, Curry Fried white rice, Sweet and Sour Divine, and the Chow Fun.  Manager is very nice and friendly.  Positive atmosphere."}
{"text":"In love with Loving Hut. Best coconut curry on the scene. Large portions & not stingy with the rice. Finally a place that serves food piping hot like it should be. Not many vegan choices in Phoenix so I'm grateful for this delicious option."}
{"text":"ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS FOOD!! And it's all vegan! My goal is try everything on the menu. I've only had 4 dishes and one dessert so far but they've all been crazy tasty! Would recommend to everyone, not just vegans and vegetarians."}
{"text":"A lot of very good vegan Asian options. Very cozy atmosphere. The veggie steak and potatoes is my favorite."}
{"text":"The food here is really good, and it's all vegan too!

I had the Thai Curry with steamed rice, as well as the spring rolls to start. Both were delicious. 

One thing that's so helpful, is that they have pictures of all of the meals on the menu, and all of it looks so good! I really want to try the Lucky Chow Mein and the Club Sandwich."}
{"text":"Ahhh, Loving Hut. 

This restaurant is good for \"I want goodness in my temple of a body\" or \"I'm hungover as hell\"

I have tried a lot of their menu items and have never been disappointed. I work right around the corner so everyday I am tempted by the Loving Hut fumes that only exist in my head....

GET THE LENTIL SOUP. So nice and warm and good for the soul.  Medium is around $6.00 and definitely hits the spot. 

SUMMER ROLLS. If you are a fan of cilantro and freshness-they are HUGE too

SIZZLING TOFU. Get the Pad Thai and eat it with the Sizzling Tofu. 

Service is friendly and nice and all around LOVING..ahahaha"}
{"text":"Quick vegan lunch with friendly service. Kept the food fresh. A tad pricy in my opinion and not my favorite cuisine (a bit greasy) But I'd go back to anyplace vegan!"}
{"text":"Food was ok. A bit over priced and the side options are boring. I had the lemongrass chicken which was good. Brown rice as a side wasn't enough."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! The Saturday buffet is awesome because you can try a little bit of everything. The fabulous Mongolian tastes exactly like real beef; the spicy cha cha is indistinguishable from popcorn shrimp. The place looks a bit dinky, but don't let that fool you, the food is beyond delicious!"}
{"text":"I've really grown to like Loving Hut over the last year. They have a really nice assortment of dishes -- some wholesome, and some delicious but unhealthy. I'm particularly fond of the Lucky Chow Mein, the Deluxe Pho, and the Shish Kebab. (The salad that comes with the Shish Kebab isn't great, but they'll allow you to substitute fries in place of the salad.) It's a great option for take-out or dine-in.

The only real problem is that the atmosphere is a little sterile and awkward, and sometimes it is a little too bright. But it's a small complaint. Overall, the place is great."}
{"text":"I was delighted to stumble across this place while I was headed to Moe's next door.  I diverted course and tried the \"special noodles.\"  Everything was fresh and came very quickly.  The dish was not quite as described but I enjoyed it. I also chose some Pandan cake from the wide variety of vegan desserts and I would have had no idea that it was vegan had I not been told.

I noticed the TV screens but the volume was very low and I did not even notice what was playing.  I actually liked the all-white decor-- everything seemed very clean and crisp."}
{"text":"We were pleasantly surprised to find out that Robinson Township in  Pittsburgh, PA (which has many restaurants geared towards meat-lovers) now has a vegan restaurant!  I am a pescatarian (fish only vegetarian) and my spouse is a part-time vegetarian.  Although both of us are starting to eat more and more vegan dishes and have a general interest in eating healthy.  

They had a ton of options on the menu, the environment was very nice (for a plaza-based restaurant) and the prices were decent.

We started with the Special Rolls appetizer and a mango smoothie.  Not only do you get a lot (10 I think) but both the sauce and the rolls were very tasty.  The Summer Rolls  looked very similar.  The mango smoothie (with soy milk) was very tasty and came with tapioca balls.  We'd ask for little or no ice next time.

For dinner, I had the quinoa salad with strips of tempeh.  It was probably one of THE best salads I've ever had.  The dressing was lime honey mustard based I believe and it was loaded with good, healthy toppings.  This dish was on the local specials menu but I hope they keep it around!

My spouse also had a dish on the specials menu (can't remember the name) that was a stir fry dish with orange zest, onions, carrots, peanuts with soy chicken protein (similar to the popcorn chicken protein that Whole Foods sells) served in a sizzling hot pot.  It was served with brown rice topped with sesame seeds.  We both were blown away at how good it tasted.  The only thing I'd recommend would be to add more vegetables.  In my opinion, there's no way a meat eater wouldn't like a dish like this.   

We finished with a slice of vegan carrot cake.  Our first choice was the vegan cheesecake but they were sold out (guess we'll have to come back!).  Again, we were very pleased.

We would HIGHLY recommend this restaurant to anyone whether you're a vegan or meat eater!  We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"This place is wonderful and totally quirky.  I always get the lobster (which is the only \"seafood\" dish i'll eat there). It doesn't taste anything like lobster, but it's so delicious regardless.  Their spring rolls are ridiculously good and I think the spicy mustard might just be the cure for the common cold.  Try to get them to serve you the new york strip steak because it's unbelievable (this is usually difficult because half the staff doesn't believe it exists! but i swear it does). I've never had much luck with the lemon grass chicken (it usually tastes like cigarette ash!).  The staff is kind of strange but they all seem genuine and caring. 

Also, I completely agree with Misty T. when she says don't try the desserts. They taste like glue and spit."}
{"text":"One star for the massive headache I got after I ate the food... MSG?  Not sure."}
{"text":"Honestly the best vegan restaurant I've been to. I'm not even vegetarian but the \"beef\" in the Mongolian tasted like beef and the sauce was fantastic. Also, the \"lucky lemon-grass\" is quite delicious as well. 

They do a buffet on Saturday from noon to 830. They will \"randomly\" select a variety of dishes, some being on their regular menu. It's all very delicious and many are very healthy. 

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The food wasn't good, mostly fried tofu options instead of healthy vegan options. Atmosphere: felt like being recruited for a cult. The video playing on the tv was a very strange homage to the Supreme Master, a woman who runs a big tv/internet religion that also runs this chain of restaurants. If the food was good, maybe it'd be easier to tune out but nothing was good about this experience."}
{"text":"If you are vegetarian or vegan this place is heaven!  So many choices!  Everything was good, too.  Great salads and stir fry.  I wish there were more people there, as it always seems empty when we go and I don't want this place to go out of business.  If you don't eat tofu or vegetarian protein, this place is probably not for you."}
{"text":"What a truly horrible experience I had tonight. I had not ordered from this place in a few years and I thought I would give it a try. When I ordered I was asked if I mind waiting 40 minutes because they were busy. I thought that was a long time for a carry out but ok I did. I got there after 50 minutes and I was asked to pay for my meal. I asked if my food was ready. I was told it was not. I asked how long until it would be ready, 20 minutes, 30? The woman behind the counter shook her head yes and just said \" I don't know what's wrong with the kitchen tonight\"? She said it with a smile on her face. No apology, no nothing. I walked out. Not nice at all. So at 7 pm I had to search for something to eat already waiting 50 minutes. I will not go back. 
Oh and the inside looks like a bowling alley form the 70's. The only thing missing was someone smoking."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness! I can't believe I waited this long to try Loving Hut. The decor is eclectic but looks a little busy. I must say I got the Lucky Noodles for lunch and they rate seriously high on the \"yumm factor\". Fresh crisp carrots, broccoli, tender zucchini, soy protien and perfectly seasoned tofu tossed in lo-mein style noodles. Being a bit of a noodle addict, I'm very picky when it comes to grading my noodle dishes. This one easily gets a 9.5 out of 10. I plan to be a regular here in future - highly recommend at least trying this place out!"}
{"text":"My husband and I make it a point to eat here whenever we are in Robinson. I am a vegetarian and he is a vegan. The last time we stopped by, he ordered a spicy pho soup and I had the lemongrass soy chicken. We were both really happy with our orders. Also, the atmosphere is great. It's in a weird strip-mall location and is kind of hard to find with a GPS -- it would be great if there was a Loving Hut in the city."}
{"text":"Consistently went to LH for the entire time it was open. It was delicious and the service was consistent. Very unique in terms of vegan options in Toronto. Hope it returns!"}
{"text":"Just visited and waited over 30 minutes before being acknowledged by any of the waitstaff. Left before ordering and won't return. A shame as I was excited to try the food."}
{"text":"Always great!  I drive from South Chandler just to eat there.  The best Vegan food.  Yes, they are under staffed and have odd hours, but the food is quite good! And are very friendly... Makes any shortcomings worth it.  Wish there was one in South East Valley."}
{"text":"One of the best vegetarian, vegan restaurants I have ever experienced.  I go here at least twice a week. Meals include gluten free items as well. A must try is their curry but I have many more favorites. Their tofu dishes are delicious and full of flavor. I have loved  everything I have had here. You should know that I am not always a vegetarian or vegan, but know where to go when I need a good healthy meal."}
{"text":"First off, this is a vegan joint. If you are expecting meat, dairy, etc, you will be let down. With that being said, this is the only all vegan institution in Pittsburgh and with the combination of eclectic Vietnamese and Western cuisine, it is a rare gem.

Going beyond the typical Loving Hut menu, they do a great job expanding the choices by adding a few Pittsburgh specific dishes (sorry, no pierogies). In addition, they have an amazing bimonthly buffet! 

This place has great customer service and treat all patrons (that I have encountered) really well. I do wish the place was in the city but it gives me an excuse to shop around Robinson. I do not understand why people did not pick this place as the best veg restaurant in the Pittsburgh City Paper and instead chose the WORST restaurant in Pittsburgh (I will be Quiet not to raise a Storm) but I will have to say for the price, service, and selection, it is a no brainer that Loving Hut takes the cake.

Support this place!"}
{"text":"Loving hut scores 4 stars for two reasons,

1. The food was full of flavour and filling.
2. They made me something that wasn't on the menu because what I asked for isn't being offered in both locations just yet. I was told they will offer the full menu at both locations soon. They're just working the kinks out. On a side note, the spring rolls tasted a little like frozen pizza crust. It was odd as hell.

I don't often find myself in vegan places these days because my vegan days were firmly placed behind me a long time ago. I like meat. Meat likes me. We're a good team. Having said that, I do enjoy a good vegan meal but don't know many vegans these days and the ones I do know do not eat well at all. Needless to say, I've had a difficult time finding the desire for good vegan vittles. When they fall in my lap, I'd be a fool to ignore them.

Loving Hut has an original location at 953 Eglington Ave and from my understanding they've been there for a while now. This location is brand spankin' new (I mean days old as I write this) and it looks it. Everything is bright and shiny including the staff. I swear I saw one of their smiles sparkle.

If they hadn't been so quick to help me out with a custom order this place would still be a solid 3.5/3. I think the restaurant falls down in a few places, the first of which being giant TVs glued to the walls. I find it kind of off putting when restaurants put TV in the dining space because it's a great way to kill conversation, even if you don't know what you're watching. The second odd bit is a small display of books and pamphlets about living well. I didn't have time to ask but I'll have to next time I'm there because one of them was called, \"The birds in my life\" or something to that effect. It just seemed out of place but I'm sure there's a reason for it.

You'll find seating for around twenty-five people or so. It's not a large place but is big enough to accommodate the lunch crowd. I'll be interested to see how they do in this neighbourhood jammed in between a high end casual clothing store for men and an expensive salad bar."}
{"text":"More like 3.5 stars. Food was good as was service. You' need to eat it hot though because the vegan chicken doesn't reheat well and is not good once it gets cold"}
{"text":"I ordered a slice of italian baguette as a starter, and was puzzled when I was brought two slices of what seemed like two day stale brick hard bread warmed up in a toaster oven.

However, the the eggplant with bean sauce and brown rice almost erased the memory of the bread, and was superb. As a dessert the super friendly waitress recommended the vegan cheesecake which was indeed fantastic. I couldn't believe it wasn't dairy based cheese. 

Overall a very nice little place, and some very affordable lunch specials worth checking out."}
{"text":"I love this place. I come here a couple of times a month and I've been to the one in Russia. I love this chain. 

I always get the wonton soup, but I add a LOT of salt because I think it's low-salt and I get the shanghai noodle. It has such great flavour! The noodles and veg in it are delicious!

Their staff has been the same for a while which is great!"}
{"text":"For all of the things this place gets wrong, they get a lot right.

Do you want to take a date here for a romantic evening? Probably not; Large TV's (though notably down from 3 to only 2) play a looping DVD that is slightly less offensive than the old Supreme Master Television. The walls are bright yellow. The whole thing feels \"cafeteria-y\". They have all kinds of vegan propaganda near the front door. 

But there is some really good stuff to be found. At first I balked a little at the prices; 13 bucks for a plate of Pad Thai? But the stuff is all organic, non GMO and prepared from actual scratch. They have really reasonably priced lunch specials and daily specials which change all the time. 

That being said some things on the menu aren't the greatest (The aforementioned Pad Thai is NOT good) but isn't that the norm with restaurants? Here's a hint! ASK THE SERVERS. The girls who work here are knowledgeable and friendly and will give it to you straight; they'll tell you their fav's and tell you what to stay away from. 

Thai Curry, Singapore Star, Udon Noodles, Eggplant with Black Bean Sauce, BBQ Spring Roll Noodle. All really good. Their TVP is yummy. 

Shocker; their fries and onion rings are so good. Seriously, the fries are some of the best I have ever had and they're vegan and organic. Just don't ruin them by leaving them in a container for 30 minutes to get all soggy. Gotta eat 'em right away.

On the topic of containers; they use all biodegradable products, which is nice. BUT, the square/rectangle containers are basically made of paper and will get soggy from the steamy food. Ask for one of the cylindrical containers instead. 

PS: Live Green and Toronto Vegetarian Association members get 10% off!"}
{"text":"Definitely a must-try! The building itself isn't much to look at but the parking lot is always full and that's a great indication of yummy-ness. It caters to both meat and veggie eaters with fake chicken, duck, and beef plates. They also have mock seafood plates as well. 

My friend and I went to check this place out because we had heard so much about it. She ordered the lemon grass chicken and I tried the ginger duck. Both were so tasty and we were kinda freaked out because they tasted just like the real thing. The service was excellent and kudos for the waitress who kept filling up our waters...even AFTER we paid the bill. It's reasonably priced and the food portions are perfect. We even had leftovers."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places! AMAZING FOOD, healthy and reasonably priced!"}
{"text":"Lately I've been quoting Spaceballs a lot with \"Assholes! I'm surrounded by ASSHOLES!\" I think its because of my meal at Loving Hut.

This place has the worst service of anywhere I've ever been, and I've been all over the world. 

Just a hint, don't go as a group of more than two people, they are unable to handle anything larger.

We ordered dinner after sitting for about 1/2 hour. Mind you, we were a group of 4 in a room with a total of 9 people. This is not rocket science. I'm borderline retarded and I can still wait tables, and have made a good living doing so. But the attitude we got was \"well, you're lucky I am doing anything for you.\"

Like I said, surrounded by assholes. 
But like Onyx said in Slam \"but but but wait, it gets worse!\"

Rule 1 in food service: bring everyone's meal at the table together. 
This rule, however, was ignored.

4 people, 40 minutes of waiting for food to finally all come out. My girlfriend's mom and I got our entrees first. Count 40 minutes later, and finally my GF's dad's dinner came out. 

Portions were tiny. \"Vegan\" fries were Orieda crinkle fries (I know them anywhere, grew up on them since mom can't cook) and it took all damn night to get our food. I think this was intentional so they could let us sit with their propaganda from Grand Master what's her name for a longer amount of time. It didn't work, now I just hate hippies, vegans and cult members even more. 

Solid work on dispelling stereotypes Loving Hut! I won't ever be gracing your little cult compound again."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, but....
First of all there was an unpleasant odor in the restaurant.  The service was not good at all. It took an hour (no exaggeration) before I got my food. My dish was just mediocre.  I wont be returning."}
{"text":"A little different, and quite healthy.  Plus open until 9 p.m., so I am a fan.  My favorite is the fake beef.  I liked the BBQ beef, and the Mongolian sounds good too. The curry was mild, but tasty.  The service is warm and friendly, and she even pointed out the favorites on the menu.  I like when waitstaff has an opinion about the food, especially when the food is unfamiliar.  The veggies are crunchy and the sauces are not too glooey,  too sweet or salty, as some Chinese sauces can be.  It would be nice if they turned down the lights a bit so it feels less like a school cafeteria.  The video promoting veganism and a supreme leader are heavy handed and well, frankly, weird. But hey, the sounds is low enough, and you can sit with your back to the screen and forget about it."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love Loving Hut! Maybe I didn't have the best choice on the menu? 
I'm vegan and I do appreciate that this is another good option for food in the city but it just didn't do it for me. I felt weird about the atmosphere - it does feel a little sad, but also it's trying to be cute so it's kind of strange. I wouldn't take a friend there. 

I went in during the afternoon for take out and the person who took my order was pretty dismissive of me! Which sucked, and I'm usually pretty understanding but it made me want to leave immediately. I wanted help deciding what to get and she didn't even respond, yikes. Anyway, I ordered a curry and rice was $2 extra so I just took it home and made rice to go with it... underwhelming. Oh well. 

Points for vegan food though, and organicness I suppose is bonus."}
{"text":"This used to be the Suma Ching Hai restaurants many years ago, and the food remains similar. The chow fun was tasty, fried rice was nothing special, the lemongrass mock meat dish was just like how we remember it back when it was Suma Ching Hai. The clay pot sensation was like severely salted tofu. It was so salty it's hard to swallow. The food was ok, nothing exciting. The ambiance was really quiet. We were pretty much the first party there that evening. The first thing my toddler said was \"where is everybody\". We told her the evening just started. What we did not anticipate was that they intend to keep it that quiet. Half way through dinner, my 8 weeks old baby started crying. He is not even the loud type, and he only cries in discomfort. While I was busy grabbing a bite so that I could take over the baby, and my husband was trying to sooth our baby, the waitress came over to my ear and told me to take the baby away to a corner to not disturb the other diners. I was furious. My quiet, good natured husband was so pissed that he dropped his dinner, paid up and we left. All the time, the big screen tv was playing and advertising about Supreme Master Ching Hai and her kindness. Wow! Talking about hypocrisy. Her restaurant cannot tolerate a less than 2 months old baby's primal and innocent cry. I was so excited about Loving Hut for months and that was our first visit. It is also our last. We are vegans for compassionate reasons. This establishment preaches kindness but has zero substance. We will not return."}
{"text":"I really felt bad that I had to write this one but I need to (don't know why I feel bad?).

Every once in a while my son and I go to dinner, I say \"find us a restaurant\" and the rules are it has to be something different and no matter the choice I have to go, I Love these dinner surprises. So he chose the Loving Hut vegan and dairy free restaurant. I thought cool, not sure what to expect but I'm in (remember the rules). 

Well I have to say that this was an experience I will not let happen again. The decor was pretty white, very white but okay I have eaten in dives and always loved the food. My son ordered tea, one of only two choices and we ordered an appetizer but only after the owner told us it was too late to make 3 out of the 6 choices, obviously one of the ones we wanted so we had to order one of the 3 fried ones. It was fine but I was not really interested in anything fried. On to the main course, I ordered Lemon Grass which was a spicy soy chicken on a bed of lettuce surrounded by cucumbers and tomatoes with a peanut sauce to dip into. My son ordered a Orange something dish that has cucumbers and tomatoes as a side with the dish. Needless to say that when the meals finally came out we less than impressed. While looking over my son's and my meal I noticed that the sides of cucumbers and tomatoes were no where to be found. I requested the sides which were brought out on one plate for us to share, no worries. Remember back at the beginning, my son ordered 1 of the 2 teas available, we were still waiting for it and when they did deliver it the tea was so hot that we finished our meals and had to wait for the tea to cool before we could leave. Back to the meal, the brown rice was like eating a mouthful of clay, not sure what it was but brown rice it didn't taste like. The spice was nowhere to be found and I like my spice. I always like my sweets after dinner but was hesitant so I had to pass based on the entire experience. So much for vegan because after that meal I wanted to go have a burger!"}
{"text":"The food was awesome, the desserts were decine. I took my wife and son and had a great time with an appezer, three main courses and three desserts. The cost was what you would expect from a completely vegan restaurant of this caliber. The only con was the low lighting."}
{"text":"The Loving Hut is by far one of the better options for a vegan and \"organic\" food experience within Toronto. By no means am I an organic aficionado nor do I regularly maintain a vegan diet, yet compared to other restaurants in the city the food quality and price point are irresistible.

Both times I've visited Loving Hut I ordered the Soy Burger with their vegan fries and I must say the consistency of the food was a pleasure to see. The burger was done perfectly, not over-salted, and was accompanied by a plate of fries that weren't greasy at all (which I typically expect from most vegan options). Further, the staff was highly friendly and knowledgeable of the ingredients and cooking process which put our minds at ease while dining. As previously mentioned, the price point is perhaps the best part of all as other restaurants tend to fall victim to the \"healthy eating\" fad and overcharge for their healthy options. The Soy Burger meal is priced quite fairly at a manageable $10.95 (compared to other restaurants I've seen which fall anywhere from $15-$25).

I would recommend this restaurant to anyone whose skeptical of the vegan world of food - I am quite certain that you will not be disappointed with any of the flavour from their diverse menu."}
{"text":"The food is excellent!!!! Lemongrass chicken is by far my favorite dish. The fried rice is also delicious. I'd give it 5 stars but here are the drawbacks: odd hours (sometimes they're not even open when they should be by their own hours) and long service times despite an empty restaurant. The TVs are always playing bizarre stuff but interesting. All that is well worth the quality of the food though."}
{"text":"Great vegan food, the lemon grass chicken has AMAZING flavor and good texture. The wonton soup was also spicy and delicious. Can't wait to go back.
They do not serve alcohol. The boba drinks looked great but didn't try any.
The dishes are about $10 or more each, so probably more like $$ to $$$, which is standard for most 100% vegan (fake meat) places."}
{"text":"This place is so cute and small. My girlfriend and I shared a burger that was more than enough to fill us both. We are definitely going back and trying the ice cream for dessert."}
{"text":"Food, service , dessert, and water is excellent! I wish we had this in Virginia beach."}
{"text":"I'm not a vegetarian, but this food was really excellent. We order a ton of food! I'll start with the things we didnt like so much or found odd. I didn't really like the spring rolls which tasted bitter for some reason and the fried rice tasted like it was drowned in soy sauce. It was so salty none of us could eat it but I talk to the waitress and they brought out some more that was just excellent. Also, the Sweet & Sour \"Pork\" w/ Pineapple had really, really nice flavor but a strange chewy texture. I would order it again because the flavor was good.

We also order the Family Tofu, steamed broccoli, steamed rice, some kind of \"chicken\" and noodles, and wonton soup. Also, we tried the cheesecake and YUM!!!  All of these were soooo freaking good... OMG! I totally crave this place now!"}
{"text":"I have driven by this place a hundred times and didn't want to go in because it looks a little run down from the outside.  I finally got take out last night and the food was AMAZING.  I'm not kidding- so yummy!  I got pan seared dumplings, bbq noodles, and a slice of raw, raspberry cheesecake.  It was so very good- they are clearly expert in the area of vegan foods.  So much better than going to a non-vegan restaurant and having them try to accommodate you.  I would have given 5 stars but the wait time was crazy.  She told me on the phone that it would be one hour.  What?!  Ok fine.  We waited the hour and my husband went to go grab my food.  They still weren't done and it took another 30 minutes.  I feel that 1.5 hours is waaaay too long to wait for one meal.  This is why I gave 4 stars.  I will try it again due to the food being so good- and hope that they were just having a rough night."}
{"text":"I've been searching ev-er-y-where for veggie potstickers, so I was SO happy to find this place. They were delicious! (Unfortunately, I ate them all before thinking about taking a photo lol) 
I also ordered the Pad Thai. It was very creamy and flavorful. I'm not a big fan of ginger & there's LOTS of it in this dish. For that reason, it wasn't my favorite, but it was still pretty good. 
I'll definitely be back. 

My only complaint is that a couple that walked in 15-20 minutes after me were served their entrees before we received any food... even before we received our appetizers :/"}
{"text":"I went in there for my birthday a couple months ago, and I LOVED IT! I went back a few other times as well. Amazing food and staff, they lady who had served me was so sweet, even brought me out a \"birthday rice cake\" made from rice. It was adorable. Waited about 45 minutes though for my food, but other than that. AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Loving Hut actually makes me crave vegetarian from time to time which is an amazing feat, as I love my meat more than my veggies.  I like their creativity in their dishes as well as the names that accompany each dish.  I only wish that they had kept the vegetarian chow mein as that was my favourite item on their menu (I was told the noodles weren't organic and hence no longer served).  

You should also give the Eglinton location a try since it's the original one.

My recommendations:
crispy tofu
heaven on earth
sweet sour fireball"}
{"text":"Excellent vegan food. Very accommodating waitress Linda who adjusted the meal to our allergies and other requests. Loved the fried tofu. Quiet and pleasing atmosphere. May try their Thanksgiving meal"}
{"text":"I think vegan means pricey in Vietnamese. 15 bucks for a buffet for a chick that eats like three skittles and is full? My meal was a ramen noodle bowl with BBQ protein chunks.... what is the protein from, who knows. I can honestly say I ate it, but if you dip a shoe in BBQ Terriyaki sauce I would probably eat it. The price of meals and waiting around is the reason for 3 stars. Maybe some bacon bits in my salad would have helped...oh they don't serve meat? OK gotcha."}
{"text":"Lovely little restaurant. Enjoyed it many times with my wife and kids. Great staff. Very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Consistently Good Food & Great Service...Sometimes get cravings for their Thai Spicy Soup & Absolutely Love the Veggie Curry.  Usually pickup a Lentil soup for the next day...a meal in it's own. Thank goodness for their Eglinton location in this vegan wasteland!!"}
{"text":"Service is so friendly :) my favorites are the wonton soup, lucky lemon grass, and grilled sensation. All the appetizers are good. I've eaten here probably about 40 times by now. The bubble tea drinks here are superb! Don't be discouraged by the fact that it's all vegan. Vegan and vegetarian meals are often more delicious than ones with meat!! :)"}
{"text":"Love Love this place have been going for years very affordable healthy food 
My ultimate favorites are the Coconut Curry and the Au Lac soup
if you're feeling a little under the weather or just want something warm, grab one of their soups. You can eat healthy, Green and not  have to break the bank!!"}
{"text":"Still great. Fantastic vegan buffet every Saturday. Wonderful menu ordering other days. I still frequent this place often."}
{"text":"I've ate from this International chain so many times. I live in Tempe, so I frequent that location. My friend lives near this one, and wanted to try some vegan food so we went here. It started out okay, our waitress had impeccable service the whole time. We ordered the fried won-tons and they were great, and so was the specialty orange drink we got (can't remember the name). She got a dish that was the one I always get at the Tempe location but it had a different name, and I ordered something I'd never gotten, the New Yorker. Our food took a little while but nothing crazy. She liked her dish, which I tried and it was not nearly as good as the Tempe one. Really bland. My food was awful. It tasted like undercooked cat food. I was like, oh man this sucks. I've never had a dish from this chain I didn't like. So I politely asked our waitress if she'd mind taking it back to the kitchen and removing it from our bill, since I only tried a single bite and the rest was untouched because it was nasty. She seemed hesitant, but was really kind and said she'd talk to the manager. The manager comes out and is literally arguing that we have to pay for it because they made it and she didn't care that I didn't like it or eat it. That I should take it home. Why would I take it home? To throw it away there? She literally interrupts my friend and I trying to nicely explain it just wasn't good and we didn't think it would be fair to pay since we didn't eat it, it tasted terrible! On top of interrupting us, she scoffs, and just walks away. We are sitting there like what the hell.. she comes back and literally throws the check onto the table knocking off a fork. She removed it from the bill. This whole thing was insane. I've never had a dish from here i didn't like until that moment, and the rest of the food was great. The waitress had to apologize for her, and let us know that she keeps all the tips that are made unless its cash on the table. if you're going to eat loving hut, eat at literally any other location."}
{"text":"One of our all time favorites for over 20 years (before it had the name Loving Hut). Such a great variety of options and always satisfying."}
{"text":"My husband and I were visiting family in PA and my mom in law found The Loving Hut.  We tried it when we first arrived and we loved it so much, we came back on our way back to the airport.  We ordered the egg roll, the wonton app, the lemon grass chicken, the bbq rice dish and the mix veggie dish.  It was so good, there was no food left over!  I'm so happy to know they are a chain and could be found world wide and they have one not too far from my house in CA."}
{"text":"The singapore star noodle dish was great!  The curry was a good dry curry that singapore noodles are delish for, and whereas the usual singapore noodles I'm use to has the pork and shrimp, I did not miss this since the tofu was so great!  The textures were fantastic and the flavour delish. The only comment is I prefer the yellow curry, and they used red."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here today for the first time and the food was out of this world. Incredibly delicious. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Took a bit to find this place as I had always known it as the Vegetarian House. Same idea, smaller menu. The service is slow and a bit confusing at times, but friendly. I thought it was a bit overpriced and between an appetizer, and two entrees the Lemongrass chicken was the only thing worthwhile. I'd go back for the lemongrass chicken but I'll probably do take-out next time."}
{"text":"This place sucks!!! It's so expensive for so-so quality of food... We ordered \"spicy\" but there was not a single chili in our dish. Every dish was salty and didn't taste very good (not good enough for the price for sure). 

But we are most upset about the horrible customer service. We complained to them that the price was wrong (that they charged us too much) but they said it was actually too little (can you believe it?) and they made the price even higher!!!!! They said it was their mistake they had forgotten to charge us for the rice. 

When we ordered the entrees, the waitress asked us which kind of rice we wanted, brown or white, so we assumed all dishes came with rice. They didn't inform us that we had to pay extra for rice. It was so confusing. 

We are vegan and always go to many locations of Loving Hut in many cities around the world and I have to say that this has been the worst experience dining at Loving Hut ever! Not a chance we will go back there. 

It was their mistake to start with and they still dared to change the price to even higher after we had complained about being charged wrong. It was such an incredibly rude service. Who would do this to a customer? These guys should learn the art of customer service from Starbucks. If I could give it zero star, I would.

If you have a car, go to Loving Hut in Tempe (near ASU). It's just a bit down the south. I love all the staff members there including the owner. They are all \"extremely\" nice. We were very very impressed with their service. They changed the orders according to our requests (replaced soy protein with tofu, cooked without onions etc.) and really made the food spicy. They also let us use their private bathroom etc. Customer service is a huge factor to a great dining experience. If you care to have a good experience, choose the Tempe location. Just so much better!!!"}
{"text":"I recently placed a large takeout order from Loving Hut and I could not have been more disappointed. The dreadful experience began when I arrived at the restaurant. After being promised that the food would be ready by 7 PM, I was left waiting until 740. When I got home and distributed the food amongst my family, we were appalled by what we found. The wonton soup might as well have been boiling water with wontons. The chow mein was soggy and bland. The golden burst fried rice was absolutely tasteless. The mango in the mango salad was not ripe. The two rainbows salads we ordered were, in fact, a mixture of cabbage and other assorted cheap vegetables when it was advertised as containing lettuce, cashews, sunflower seeds, almonds and pumpkin. The one redeeming dish, the pho, could not save this awful meal. Stay away from this place. You could make tastier food randomly tossing ingredients into a pan."}
{"text":"Good food and good service.  This is the restaurant I go when I don't want any surprises.  My favorte is their \"stuffed tomatoes\" - yummy."}
{"text":"Excellent food! Very interesting items and of course an awesome place for vegetarians. The ambience is as per the name of the restaurant, very loving and peaceful."}
{"text":"Freaking out a little. Just got finished eating there. Hairs in the food and I saw a cockroach crawl across the kitchen floor. At least if I get sick tonight I will know why!"}
{"text":"I find this quirky little place adorable.

It's one of those rare vegetarian restaurants that offers meatless meat. You veggies out there know what I'm talking about: the spongy soy-based \"meat\" that both fascinates and repulses us.

My husband and preschooler, omnivores both, really enjoyed their meals.

Definitely one of those spots one must try at least once."}
{"text":"Love this place! Which is hard for me to say of most of the vegan/vegetarian restaurants my mom has dragged me into.

The sizzling rice soup is my favorite! I can't believe how amazing it tastes being vegan and how good it make you feel.

We always get the summer rolls, sweet and sour pork, and the lemon grass chicken.

I haven't been since it changed names but before service was always a little weird. The guy servers there seem like they are so aloof.

It's always really clean and the bathrooms are nice too."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVED IT! The service there is good and so is the environment. A very lovely restaurant. I had the new york charm. It was DELICIOUS :)"}
{"text":"As a committed carnivore, I was tricked into coming to this restaurant by a well-meaning relative who I think wanted to convert me. I ordered things like spring rolls and a noodle dish and other things that were vegan, but that I might have ordered anyway at a non-vegan restaurant. The spring rolls were mediocre and the noodle dish was stodge. The blandest thing I ever ate. The texture on the fake chicken was hideous, like biting into bland mush. The carrots were fresh and not overcooked. That's pretty much the only positive thing I can say about the meal. Even my vegan friend was disappointed with the food. Oh yeah, and the cult TV they play in the background is creepy. If this was supposed to convert me to vegan cuisine, all I can say is EPIC FAIL."}
{"text":"If you're looking for vegan, this is NOT the best in town.  Sure, everything is vegan, but it's lots of fake meats, some odd flavors, and horrific videos playing on the wall of vegan propaganda.  

As a vegan, I choose to eat my lunch without a side of animal-slaughtering videos.  The best thing on the menu: Mu Shu Vegetable appetizer (so good!).  If you're willing to spend a little more, venture over to True Food or even Whole Foods which have lots of vegan options."}
{"text":"My son and I come in here at least once a month for their incredible pad thai and a slice of the strawberry cheesecake. Bringing a two year old anywhere is a recipe for disaster but the ladies here always remember us and tell me how cute my son is when he is being less than an angel. Like other reviewers mentioned, yes, the service can be slow at times, especially busy ones, but they are so nice to me and my unsavory sidekick that I don't even care. That and the food make up for it in spades. We almost always order the pad thai, it's glorious. Not a traditional pad thai flavor but even more delicious. We just love this spot and the wonderful people that run it."}
{"text":"We were a little skeptical at first, because the parking lot wasn't very full. When we walked in, it was sterile and dated and I would've turned around had the server not smiled warmly and invited us to have a seat.

So glad we didn't ditch it based on looks. The food was delicious! 

Two must haves: Rainbow Salad and the Stuffed Tomatoes."}
{"text":"Amaze balls! Our entire family (1 vegan, 1 vegetarian & 2 omnivores) were all able to pig out happily. I'm eating strictly gluten free, ordering from their menu was NO problem! 

My absolute favorite was the coconut curry soup. The eggplant with tofu was also delicious. 

Lastly the desserts were awesome. Vegan oatmeal chocolate chip cookies were my favorite. Really loved the raw GF vegan cheesecake and our kids loved the cake.

Do yourself and all animal kind a favor and eat here!"}
{"text":"Seriously everything on the menu is delicious. I haven't tried one thing that didn't let me down. I'm amazed at how they substitute meat in a lot of these dishes because it not just tofu but a good veg protein. My all time favorite is the Guru Fried rice, they don't list it on the menu with this title anymore but if you order it they'll know exactly what you are talking about. Also my new favorite is the Wonton Soup, it's perfectly satisfying!"}
{"text":"I'm new to being gluten-free, and I was looking for restaurants around my office to eat lunch at. A few coworkers raved about Loving Hut, and I was surprised I hadn't been there before. 
Anyway, my first experience there didn't disappoint. The atmosphere is great-- really laid back and good staff. I ordered the Lunch Special, which that week included the DELICIOUS Tofu Delight (I'm obsessed-- my fav dish from there for sure) and a mushroom soup which was probably the best mushroom soup ever. AND it was only $10 for everything! Honestly, the fact that all these foods were vegan, organic, and gluten-free was simply a bonus. I would order Loving Hut regardless of my personal diet preferences. 

I've been back about 7 times in the past 2 weeks, and each time has been just as good as the first, with a few exceptions-- a few items forgotten on larger take out orders, and I've been in a couple times where one of the staff members was clearly stressed (it wasn't even that busy in the restaurant at these times) and was super snappy with me. However, the rest of the staff is always incredible so I didn't allow it to bother me as much as I would've at other places. 

Bottom line: The Loving Hut is awesome. Great food, great atmosphere, great service. ENJOY."}
{"text":"Its always good times to find an all vegetarian spot in the valley of the sun and Vegetarian House is a supremely awesome spot indeed. I was a little worried when I first opened the menu and there were Chicken, Seafood, and Meat entrees. Then I was assured that they were all meatless.

I had the Ginger Duck and it was like eating duck! Unreal!

The decor needs some help but the food is why I am there."}
{"text":"If you insist on living the meatless life, this might be the cookie dough Quest Bar to your Ketogains.

My experience of Loving hut was a homemade Morningstar Farms taste test. It felt like whoever designed the buffet was trying to convince me that I didn't need to eat animals to be happy, because look at all this \"chicken!\" It just strikes me as lazy cuisine.

I'm not vegan or vegetarian (anymore), but I can still appreciate creative vegan dishes. When I do eat plant matter, it's not a political or ethical statement; fiber and micro nutrients are good for you, and can be delicious. Proficient chefs can make the humble beet blow your mind (e.g. The Twisted Frenchmen).  

With that in mind, I was surprised to find so many meat substitutions here. Something that always confused me about many vegans/vegetarians is their reliance on meat-like substances. I was a strict vegetarian for many years, but I quickly weaned myself of of the soy-based \"chicken\" type things. It came crashing down with bison sausage dipped in home-milled almond butter, but I digress. The point is this: if I want lemongrass chicken or beef stir fry, I don't go to a vegan restaurant. 

Pros:
- The meat subsitutes are well executed. They were shockingly good. 
- Service was pleasantly minimalist.
- Clean space
- Pleasant enough atmosphere

Cons:
- Most dishes were pseudo-meat, which I find strange
- Overcooked veggies
- The desserts were lackadaisical. 
- The price was high, as the staple of the spread was steamed rice."}
{"text":"Being a vegan and working downtown, I was excited about the launch of The Loving Hut on Spadina. I went for the first time last week and was a little under-whlemed. There service was slow but i'm assuming it's because it just opened and a lot of the employees had no clue how to operate the cash register. Everyone just seemed 'frazzled', if you will. I don't mind waiting if the food is worth the wait - but i found it to be a little flavourless. I got the lunch special - the green curry with tofu and vegetable with rice and soup on the side. The soup was delicious. The rice was plain (i think they should add coco rice to the menu). The curry sauce was too watery for what i'm used to. The overall flavour of the green curry dish was decent but like I said, coco rice and a thicker sauce would have made it that much better. 

I would like to give them a higher rating but will have to try a few more dishes before i can do that."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Loving Hut in the greater Phoenix/Scottsdale area.  Be prepared to wait, it is not fast food in any sense of the word, it is fresh and delicious and not made ahead of time. One time, when it was crowded it took a half and hour from the time of ordering until the time the food was received.  I had time, but others did not.  The server gave us (the customers waiting) free boxed cookies to take home.  Honestly, I never would have thought about buying their cookies before she did that, but they were so delicious that I do buy them on my own now."}
{"text":"Not impressed. My Pad Thai was exactly that - padded together. I think it was fresh yesterday. You know how when you reheat noodles they get clumped together? Well that was my dish."}
{"text":"I ate here recently with a friend.  It was pretty dead at lunch hour. Just us and 2 other tables. I had the lemongrass soy chicken, which was tasty. Also had the crispy rolls and the coco tofu (shared with a coworker). Everything was yummy, I just wish there was a bit more vegetable variety in the dish than just a pile of tofu/soy protein and some brown rice. Other dishes have more variety so I will have to try those.

I was a bit worried that the cult feeling would be overwhelming, but the workers were friendly and it was easy enough to ignore the TVs on the walls."}
{"text":"Really like the look of the menu but the item I got (delux pho) was super bland. The hot sauce they had was tasty and made it better. Will give this a try again as a vegetarian living in this Neighbourgood it's great to have a vegan option!"}
{"text":"Some dishes are good, some taste like they came out of a can from the Ranch Market at the Chinese Cultural Center.

The heaven rice rolls might be my favorite in town, and the lobster dish is fantastic (definitely agree with kate - doesn't taste like lobster, but is delicious nonetheless).

Free tea is always a really nice way to start a meal, too."}
{"text":"Very delicious vegan food with wonderful customer service to go along with it."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan. This has become my go-to lunch place. Admittedly I haven't tried anything other than the Salty Spicy Tango, but I found a dish that consistently hits a home run and haven't ventured past it. This low carb dish is legitimately spicy and features grilled soy protein on a bed of stir-fried celery, onion and green pepper. 

As a meat eater, I was surprised and how great it tastes and filling it is. Beyond that, the staff are super nice and turn around a quick take out dish at lunch. A must try."}
{"text":"The Saturday buffet is now EVERY Saturday, 12pm - 8pm, instead of once a month.

Everything was amazing and I could barely stand the excitement of a vegan buffet.

I have been to 5 or 6 Loving Huts but none of them have a buffet. It was everything I hoped it would be and more. There were fake meat dishes, tofu, Thai, Chinese, broccoli cheddar soup, carrot cake, the most delicious salad dressing, fresh fruit, and just so many dishes. The lemon grass chicken nuggets were incredible.

While there, I briefly contemplated driving to Pittsburgh for lunch every Saturday.

While I wish they sold frozen Loving Hut products, they still get 5 stars because they have a buffet. With tax, is come to $16 but is well worth it. I couldn't believe there were people coming and ordering off the menu instead!

As for the cultishness, on my last visit, the TV was all about Christianity's message about animals and vegetarianism, which was a first for me. Usually it's just news about world animal deaths and messages from the Supreme Master. There was no Supreme Master shown on my last visit, just Jesus."}
{"text":"Every time I go to this place, my taste buds thank me. I have tried many different meals, and each one has its own great flavor. I have also tried some of their desserts and drinks, totally tasty. People are super friendly there and it has a nice clean fresh atmosphere. Even my meat-eating husband complimented the faux-meat dish he got. I wish they got more business though, the parking lot is almost always empty when I go. The hours are a bit weird but I can understand it if they don't get customers all day long. If I could afford to eat out every day, I'd go to this place for sure. There are so many things still on the menu that I want to try."}
{"text":"I have been to two other loving huts but this one was the best. The restaurant is beautiful and the staff are friendly and helpful. I ate from the Saturday buffet and had no complaints. The food was amazing and best of all- it's all vegan. Wish I had one of these near where I live!"}
{"text":"Had the wonton soup. Can't say I loved the wontons because the inside of them were just mush, rather than having any kind of heft. Some mushrooms would do the trick to replace meat, if anyone is interested in my opinion.

The broth however, was heavenly. SERIOUSLY GOOD.

I'd come back here if I was starving and had no place to go. I can't really say I could order stuff on the menu to eat however as the good things seem very greasy (curries), and a lot of oil is not my thing.

I may try the burger next time or something else, but I didn't quite see anything I'd come back and HAVE TO EAT."}
{"text":"Visiting from the San Franciso Bay Area, very impressed to have this veg oasis not far from our hotel.  We arrived only 10 minutes before they stopped serving lunch, and they had everything ready really quickly - about 10 minutes:  rice paper rolls, lemongrass faux chicken, a vegetable curry chow mein, and brown rice to go.  The lemongrass dish, while a bit meager  -- 13 bite-sized pieces of deep-fried yumminess on a piece of lettuce -- was really tasty.  The rice paper rolls were uninspiring.  The chow mein was okay.  The brown rice was exceptionally good."}
{"text":"Great food! Nothing like this in the area, if you enjoy vegetarian/vegan cuisine, you have to try this place!"}
{"text":"I've walked by this place literally every day for the past 2 years and never went in due to the bubble tea/cult/sex massage vibe. 

Yesterday, I had a close brush with death and thought, what the hell, it's time to do something opposite.

My inaugural meal was a small Wonton soup and BBQ \"meat\" and vermicelli - the faux vietnamese special. While vegetarian meat substitutes never quite mimic the taste and flavour of real meat, I was pleasantly surprised at the rich and satisfying flavours. Portions were large and food was quick.

Not fine dining, but healthy and clean with a large menu, friendly staff and affordable. I went back today for the same meal and had the vegan chocolate cake as well. It was delicious. As huts go, there was certainly a little bit of love in this one."}
{"text":"Wonderful food! Not plant based, but very delicious vegan food. Try the heaven rolls!"}
{"text":"The Loving Hut is exploding all over North America. From San Francisco to Chicago to now 2 set up in Toronto, I'm sure this place will expand and succeed. This particular locale is just across the street from $50 vegan meals at Fresh, so for $10 I took my money across the street to give the 'Hut a whirl.  
Atmosphere: Lacking that granola feel of other sustainably-floored places and the furniture is white leather- so different from the mismatched chairs and wobbly tables seen at the Kensington veggie places. 

Service: Still working out the kinks, I got take out, but they were nice and helpful-ish. 

Food: I took the black bean eggplant and tofu that came with brown rice- huge portion- and a soup. It was a lunch special. At first I was surprised that the soup (vegetable and tomato) was quite fresh and flavorful. The eggplant and tofu, of which there was a good amount of both, were also quite good. Just enough sauce to keep the rice swimming! 

Cost: It's not $50 like Fresh, but this location has two prices on the menu- Regular and Organic. They state, \"We are the organic prices.\" 
So the lunch special marked at $8.95 is actually $10.95 + tax. 
Is organic now a euphamism for \"Downtown Elite\" and therefore because of the higher rent on Spadina and Richmond, they charge \"Organic\" prices? Is everything really organic and if so, the people at the other location wouldn't also like organic vegan food? 

Anyway- I'm sure the downtown elite pinkos will be riding their bikes down here a lot. I just hope they expand the menu to include SF treasures like Philly Cheese-\"steak\". Let's go to the 'Hut."}
{"text":"So I drove by this place for years, kinda poking fun at the name. On a whim a couple years ago, the wife and I decided to check it out, and I was blown away by the great service and outstanding food! I am not vegan by any means- I love meat, but I appreciate all food, and we regularly have a meal here! The food is of the highest quality, and while all of their dishes that have meat substitutes are very good, I still prefer the ones that are not trying to be something else most. seriously- try their EVERYTHING! It is all so good!"}
{"text":"Been to a couple loving hut locations and each one is different. Like this one, it's super cozy but not a lot of seating so may or may not want to eat there depending on how crowded it is. I've tried their bahn mis and carrot cake and loved both. Wasn't feeling too well this weekend and ran in for some bread. I made an amazing discovery, didn't see it on their menu but when I asked for a baguette or just some bread they asked if I wanted naan. I got really excited, naan usually has milk and eggs bakes in and is topped with butter so not vegan but they sell vegan naan and it's really good. Other than the bahn mis and app rolls haven't tried too much else on their menu. Everything sounds really good though. Will come back here to try their other dishes and really like their staff, super friendly."}
{"text":"I've now tried the Scottsdale, Tempe, and Glendale locations. The winner? Scottsdale. The portion sizes are huge, the flavor is fabulous, and the meat substitutions can fool any carnivore. I have not ordered something that I haven't loved. The pho, pad thai, banh mi, mongolion wok, bbq noodles, and all the appetizers are all equivalent in texture and taste to their meaty versions. If you're looking for a vegan restaurant this location is the one to choose. I'll be a regular here!"}
{"text":"I went here yesterday with my boyfriend and loved all of the food. I got spicy noodle soup and he got lemongrass tofu. Everything was delicious, especially the tofu. We'll definitely be back to try the buffet."}
{"text":"This place was GREAT and I am not even a vegetarian, let alone a vegan!  Amazing meat substitutions and the flavors were delicious!  We got the Heaven rice rolls as a starter, then BBQ Noodles, Pho, and Sweet and sour Divine to split, and everything was spectacular!!  We also got a smoothie and a vanilla shake, AND a piece of chocolate cake!  YUM!  And, the best part, it is affordable!!     I guess there was a decent wait for the food, but we hardly noticed because we were too busy visiting.  Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food - I got the wonton soup, summer rolls and the sweet and sour dish

Small place and took a while for carry out but worth it!!"}
{"text":"5/5 for food and 3/5 for service. I enjoyed the new age decor and videos playing, as well as the message of compassion and kindness that was perpetuated on the walls, in the music, etc. This place is not just for vegans!

Food: Yum! We didn't miss the meat/animal products at all. I got the famous Pad Thai (gluten free!), which did not disappoint. It was flavorful, aromatic, and delicious. I also had enough to take home! My husband got the Sweet & Sour Divine, and really enjoyed the veg protein. He ate his all in one sitting, but had a hard time doing so (: We were told that other favorite picks were the Spicy Cha Cha (it's supposed to taste just like shrimp), Royal Noodle Soup, and Ocean Sandwich.

Service: The staff all give off somewhat strange vibes (as mentioned in other reviews). They're not unfriendly, but they're definitely not any friendlier than they have to be, and it seems like they don't want you to be there. They'll offer suggestions if asked, and our drinks were refilled regularly, but no one asks how your food is or if you need anything else. They also pretty clearly wanted to kick us out when it got close to closing time, even though we didn't stay after hours.

Of note: They have kind of weird hours, as some other reviewers have mentioned, so make sure you check that they're open before you go. Also, they sell vegan cookies and other bakery goods at the cash register, if that's your jam!"}
{"text":"I am not a vegan but love vegetables and would prefer to not eat meat most of the time. This place has the best spring rolls I have ever tasted. My sister-in-law is vegan and I went with her and she liked it too!"}
{"text":"So glad I finally tried this place. We ended up having the spring rolls which were amazing. We had sweet and sour \"chicken\" and pad thai per the waitresses recommendation. The pad thai was okay... I was honestly not very impressed by it. It was a bit soggy and meh. However, the sweet and sour was incredible. I wish we had ordered two plates of that!  I do not normally find myself a fan of faux meats but the flavour was spot on and was absolutely delicious. 

The only real complaint I have was that it took FOREVER. Our drinks took at least 15 minutes to get, while our food another 45 minutes after waiting 30 for appetizers. They servers were incredibly kind and apologetic as they had two cooks and a restaurant FULL of people. We were starving so it was little annoying as we just wanted to eat when we arrived. But that all being said, the wait was well worth it. 

I would love to go back and try something else. Also, the chai matcha type drink was so good!!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to go if you work in the area, you have some food allergies (gluten, dairy) and you want to have a super benign lunch. I've had the lemongrass soup and the pho (really difficult to eat with the metal chopsticks they give you, BTW - noodles are usually overcooked) as well as the lunch red curry.

I haven't loved' anything so far - they've all been tasty enough but not quite legit, if you like real asian cuisine.  The portions are huge which is great too, but the variety of ingredients is lacking. Still tasty though!"}
{"text":"Tasty Vegan food that didn't make me visit the \"facilities\" for extended stretches. I'd go back - only hungrier this time."}
{"text":"I am definitely not vegan but this restaurant was very flavorful and tasty. We started out with the summer rolls and they were served piping hot and delicious. I also had their coconut curry soup which was just amazing. It was thick and very spicy with lots of vegetables. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to others. Their service was very good as well.  They also had a small grocery store and frozen food to purchase. It was a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Love love love love love this place! I was so impressed with their BBQ Baguette yesterday that I had to go back and see if it was a fluke since I usually can't stand faux meats. Today I had their house fried rice and it was also delicious. The best thing about LH is the fact that they sell their veg meats in the stores (along with some of their sauces and an interesting looking seasoning). So the BBQ veg protein I love so much, I now have a bag of it in my kitchen and my waitress even explained how to prepare it (it's a TVP kind of protein so you just rehydrate it)."}
{"text":"Yay wonton soup!  I stopped here for lunch today and ordered wonton soup, and also the banh mi with fries.  They also gave me a complimentary cup of lentil soup because they do that during lunch.  The lentil soup tasted fine too and it was nice that it came out first because I was cold.  The wonton soup was good, especially the wonton filling.  The fries were good standard fast food type fries, but not too greasy.  The banh mi, while not the best I ever had, was all right, although it tasted more like French dip.  The bread did go really well with the soup, though.  I am excited to go back and try more dishes."}
{"text":"I was excited to hear that a downtown location of Loving Hut had opened - i've been enjoying the food at the Eglinton location for many months now without disappointment.

You will find the same inoffensive decor here, as well as the same TVs showing the 'Supreme Master' TV station, plus the little table of info pamphlets on vegetarianism. I don't think this detracts so much from this little restaurant to be a detriment however, as it's all easy to push into the background.

I cannot fault the quality or taste of this location's food - it's really very good! Nice to see them keeping the lunch specials, too. However there isn't as much variety on the menu here, and everything's about $1 - 2 more expensive. Expand the menu and I could forgive the downtown pricing & bump this up to a very solid 4 stars.

Still, there's nothing wrong with having another great tasting vegan option right downtown, and I hope they thrive!"}
{"text":"Loving Hut!!!

Favourites: Tasty on the Green, BLT, and Asian Noodle Soup.

Staff are friendly, the place is spacious and clean, and the wait for food is short. I enjoy their weekend lunch specials. 

It's a little pricey but worth it considering they're a specialty vegan, organic, and nut free restaurant. Some of the food could use some salt or hot sauce, but other than that it's delicious. Also they play an interesting but very strange channel on their TVs. 

I'm a returning customer and one of the waitresses knows to bring me hot sauce with my order!"}
{"text":"I really like their food, it's yummy vegan Thai.
As a vegan person it's hard to find good places in this town, I'm giving only 4 stars since they can do a bit better on the service. But overall you will enjoy the food, their raw cheesecake is extremely yummy probably the best I've ever eaten. I definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I've been back to Loving Hut a number of times since my initial review, tried a few new things and enjoyed it all. I have repeated the Pho experience, and it's well worth it - one of the best noodle soups i've had anywhere.

I even had enough room to fit in dessert one visit and tried a slice of cake - Mochachino, a chocolate cake with a delicately flavoured creamy coffee frosting. Mmm! I need to remember to leave room more often.

I've now also added a number of photos to Loving Hut's entry of some of my culinary samples."}
{"text":"Stopped by this location today on my way back to Columbus from Pittsburgh and am very glad that I did. As a vegan I'm always looking for places during my travels so there was no way I was leaving town without stopping in. 

 The staff here is very friendly and welcoming right upon walking into the door. After asking if this was out first time there and receiving a yes they went out if their way to provide a menu and answer all of our questions and requests with a smile. 

I took full advantage of the Saturday buffet and tried everything available. I particularly enjoyed the curry, chow mein, Mongolian \"beef\" and the fried tofu wedges. Also tried the piña colada and it was delicious. The chocolate cake for dessert was one of the richest desserts I've had and I could barely finish it. So if you have a super sweet tooth you would love it!

I will definitely be stopping in next time I am in the area."}
{"text":"I've been to the Loving Hut twice and it's a great restaurant.  I'm vegetarian but I avoid large amounts of dairy and eggs and any other animal product (although I'm not actually vegan).  It's really nice to go to a restaurant and not have to worry about picking through \"oh does this have meat hidden it it\".  In a typical restaurant, the only non-meat items are ridiculously cheesy pasta which I won't eat either.  It also has a lot of gluten free options which are great for people who don't eat gluten!  Amazing how they can do that.

First time I went, I had the Lucky ChowMein and my boyfriend had the Pad Thai.  Both were delicious.  I had so much left over that I took about half home ... I added some more veggies and tofu to it at home and made it into two more lunches!!  Second time I went, I had the Shanghai Noodle and my boyfriend had the Thai Curry.  The curry was a bit spicy for me.  The Shangai Noodle was very good as well.  It had a \"spicy\" label on it but it was NOT spicy at all so I'm not sure why it had that label.  It had flavour yes, but it wasn't spicy.  We also got the spring rolls appetizer both times which is delicious.  Another thing is that I've never gone to any place that makes tofu even close to how we make it at home.  It's usually plain and boring.  However, the Loving Hut makes pretty good tofu!!

My favourite was the Lucky ChowMein.  I'd like to try the tofu appetizer and one of their burgers sometime.  I'd also like to try the dessert sometime.  I definitely plan to go back.  Very good pricing on the amount of food that you get as well.  A really nice environment inside as well.  Very friendly staff.  Love this place."}
{"text":"I have to admit, I'm a bit surprised to see such rave reviews on this joint. I went there yesterday to get some Wonton soup and I was left with this feeling I don't often get... Disappointment. The soup itself had 1.5 wontons in the whole bowl and it couldn't have been more bland.

What's even worse is that this bland food item was expensive! I understand that a vegan restaurant is imperative with our ever growing vegan population but just because it's vegan doesn't mean it has to lack in taste and come at a cost.

The restaurant itself is ok.. Just ok. I am just not impressed with the cheesy television programs going on while you eat and the atmosphere reminds of a stuffy cafeteria. Not the ideal please to enjoy a meal.

I will say on the positive, the staff at the Loving Hut are wonderful. So friendly and charismatic and helpful. I think they are the best part about this joint.

To sum up this review.. There's not so much love from this gal for the loving hut."}
{"text":"I found this place back in the day when I was eating vegetarian only and I still frequent it. It's absurd how great the food tastes! There are some dishes that mess with your head because they taste exactly like its meat counterpart, even texture! 
My top recommendations are to try the veggie spring rolls ( may go by a different name), the spicy cha cha shrimp (you will be amazed at how similar it tastes to real shrimp) and the sweat and sour divine (my favorite orange chicken tasting dish ever!)"}
{"text":"Decor is NOT fancy, but the food was SO good. Only one person seemed to be working (at least I only saw one person)."}
{"text":"The service is incredible. People are so nice and friendly. The menu is pretty simple but tasty. Great vegan restaurant."}
{"text":"Not-so-good:
Food was not tasty; Pad Thai did not have taste, fried tofu was extra crispy on outside and extra soft on inside, but sushi was okay
Price was not bad but not worth the food quality

Good:
Friendly service
All vegetarian is a plus

For my other reviews, I used to give an extra star for a place being all-vegetarian.  No more.  I expected a lot more out of Loving Hut having heard so much about it.  After excitedly awaiting a mouth-watering menu, my guest and I were disappointed by tasteless dishes without spice or flavor.  We almost felt inclined to NOT give the standard answer to the waitresses', \"Is all of the food all right?\"

The place was clean, the waitress was nice, the desserts were decent, so that was a plus for Loving Hut.

Ultimately, unless this location dramatically improves, I won't be going here again."}
{"text":"I love this place! My favorite is the Banh Mi Philly, and I've never been disappointed!"}
{"text":"I wasn't sure how to feel about this place when we first walked in... the decor is pretty awful, and they must not believe in \"atmosphere\".  They might consider doing some kind of HGTV make-over show... it is seriously that bland.

On the other hand, the service was super sweet and friendly.  The waitress walked us through the menu (our first time there), chatted with our 4-year-old, and even brought him out a free apple juice... just to be nice :)  She even praised us for raising our son as a vegan... we didn't have the heart to tell her that he eats meat - and so do I!

I was a little weirded out when I saw the menu and EVERYTHING looked like meat.  When I'm ordering a vegetarian dish, it just seems strange to make it look like a cow.  Even though it wasn't what I had expected, it was still really delicious.  We had the spicy \"shrimp\", \"beef\" and broccoli, crispy wontons, and the \"hamburger\".  Everything was great, and I doubt most meat-eaters could even tell that these were vegan items.  

We're looking forward to a return visit... and perhaps take-out on April Fool's Day, to trick my carnivore father into eating something \"veggie\" ;)"}
{"text":"What an odd little restaurant. Nestled in an unassuming plaza in Robinson, you might even miss it. Sitting next to what used to be a CiCi's and across from Moe's, Loving Hut is kind of at odds with its location.

The menu is all vegan and personalized by the chef of each location. They do a great job with their dishes, everything is light and the core ingredients really shine through.

Our spring rolls were crunchy and full of fresh veggies, the peanut sauce was light and balanced its sweet and savoriness perfectly.

It's an odd location, I feel it would be better suited closer to the city but I hope it works for them.

Check out my longer review: http://eatinginpittsburgh.com/2011/02/23/loving-veganism/"}
{"text":"Love it here. I love the desserts and the food and how clean it is.  Just remember to bring cash."}
{"text":"With respect to some of the reviewers who have come before me, most of the descriptions of Loving Hut simply don't do justice to the atmosphere in this place.  It is so warm, and so full of good energy that it puts me in a good mood just walking in.  The very white ambiance gives the place such a good, clean feeling.  It's like its mom just told it to wash behind the ears.

The food here is delicious and cheap (we spent $28 for three dishes and rice).  Far from tasteless, my experience of the food is that it is packed with flavour and very home-style asian, as opposed to delicate and refined.  The rainbow salad is a yummy, citrusy combo of cabbage, carrots, cilantro, fried tofu, and crispy shallots that elevate the dish.  

Thai curry is heavier than you might expect, with lots of different veggies (including perfectly cooked eggplant) and generous (maybe too generous) with curry paste.

Pad Thai has a great lemongrassy flavour and is served with tasty mock shrimp, generous tofu and delicious noodles that are perfectly cooked.

The fresh rolls are also terrific.

The service is also awesome.  When we walked in tonight, it was on the late side, so the waitress was clearly bored because the restaurant was quiet.  She flashed us a huge smile and said, \"Thank goodness you came in!  It's been so quiet tonight!\"  One of the cooks was also out front, by the register and she gave us a big smile and started singing along (with a very beautiful voice) to the music playing.  Service was warm, fast and super friendly - even when other people came in.

All in all, I love this place.  It's not super elegant food, but it's yummy and served with love.

Vegetarian Score: 10/10.  You don't get better than a huge menu of vegan deliciousness."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places. The buffet is amazing and you can try a bunch of different vegan meats. I am vegetarian and get so excited when I get a TON of options. I have not eaten a single thing there I did not like."}
{"text":"So amazing! I'm vegetarian so of course I love it! I took my meat eating boyfriend and he enjoyed it to! I especially like the orange chicken!!"}
{"text":"So delicious! The menu here is pretty big. There are so many options, I had a really hard time choosing just one entree. Everything is vegan and it was nice and quiet on a Sunday evening. The waitress kind of rushed me (because I was taking so long choosing a meal) but otherwise everyone was very friendly. I got the golden spring rolls appetizer. They're so good but very greasy. They came with a spicy mustard that tastes like wasabi or maybe horseradish. They also came with a sweet chili sauce. I also had the spicy cha cha for my entree. It is like a faux shrimp, which wasn't what I expected. It wasn't as spicy as I expected either. I wasn't crazy about it so I traded dinners with my boyfriend and ate his coconut curry instead, which was AMAZING. I'll definitely be back to try everything else on the menu. Before we left, we picked up a couple bags of spicy TVP jerky to take home."}
{"text":"Friendly owner.  I hope they attract more business.

Need to know what dishes to order.  Some are better than others."}
{"text":"A typical outing to the Veggie House with my girlfriend  looks like this:

-Start with hot tea and vegetable soup
-A small order of absolutely delicious spring rolls
-Two entrees...usually the House Special Chicken and Broccoli Chicken

Have you ever gone to a restaurant repeatedly and ordered the same thing every time?  Seriously, if I had the eat and drink the above for the rest of my life, I'd totally be cool with it.  This place is golden in my book.

One time, my friend ordered the House Special Dinosaur.  When the waiter gave a confused and funny look, my friend explained that since it isn't really meat anyway, it shouldn't matter what you call it.  Try it sometime."}
{"text":"This place has amazing food, but the service is SO SLOW. Make sure to double check your bill because they tend to \"accidentally\" overcharge."}
{"text":"I would definitely recommend this place for vegans and vegetarians.  In town for business and tried it for the first time.  Lentil soup was the best I've ever had.  Sweet and Sour Devine was devine."}
{"text":"My partner and I eat here on a pretty regular basis (we are both vegan).  We had the buffet once-it was delicious, so delicious in fact that we both ate way more than we should have (that's on us though) so we haven't been back for that.  Otherwise we order our meals: sometimes getting an appetizer, always an entree, sometimes dessert or bubble tea in addition.  We try to order something different each time but we each have our set of favorites we fall back on in rotation.  I love everything here.  Seriously.  I always leave very full if not with leftovers.

I had my birthday dinner here with three omnivores in addition to my partner and me.  My dad generally doesn't like food other than american and italian - he thought the burger was really good.  My mom loved her dish (lucky lemongrass), my skeptical niece had the orange chicken and was surprisingly pleased and would like to eat there again.  My younger niece was simply disappointed there wasn't a kids menu.  She took her left over burger home though saying it was much better than those sandwiches her mom makes her eat.  All would eat there again. 

No they don't make the cakes themselves, but who cares, they are delicious."}
{"text":"I love the fried rice and spring rolls and I'm not even vegan. The food is amazing. The speed of service and level of hospitality leaves A LOT to be desired.  I've never had an even a mediocre experience in terms of service. 

Pregnancy Cravings are the only reason I come back.

Update: soy sauce lid wasn't properly placed on the container and now my front seat is soaked in soy sauce."}
{"text":"This was the venue of the March get-together of the vegetarian UYE group, which gave me an opportunity to finally try it. Since I love fried shrimp, I followed Tigra C's advice and ordered the spicy cha cha; it was delicious, and that fact that it was made of yam protein was a plus for me as I try to avoid wheat-based vegetable proteins such as seitan. I asked for onion rings instead of fries as a side and those were very good as well: firm, crunchy exterior and the onion interior was tender and not stringy. For dessert I ordered the strawberry cheesecake because I was intrigued ... does a raw vegan 'cheesecake' actually taste good and creamy? I'm happy to report that it definitely does! The staff is very friendly though for this visit the service was slow, probably because we were a relatively sizable dinner group. But the quality and flavors of the food have made me decide that I am definitely coming back to try other dishes, including the amazing guru rice that Tigra let me have a taste of."}
{"text":"Recently turned vegetarian thanks to places like this that showed me delicious healthy food.  Their yam protein Tastes and felt like shrimp.  Even had that tail which was Edible."}
{"text":"This was my first time dining here.  The food was delicious.  I got the friend rice and the cha cha shrimp dish.  The French fries were fresh and crispy.  Fried wontons were good.  Red velvet cake for dessert.  Yum!"}
{"text":"Just had a lovely meal here. It seems practically everything is organic in addition to being vegan. The fries were out of this world. Singapore star was also good. Chocolate ice cream and carrot cake were fantastic. Yes, we ate a lot and we will be back."}
{"text":"Yummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm!!!! Can't say enough good things - great experience, stuffed our faces and actually felt good afterwards"}
{"text":"I've up-ed my rating to 5-star, after coming here repeatedly for the Saturday buffet.  I love the buffet.  It is amazing the things they do with Tofu.  Really delicious, and the textures are different and mostly match the foods that are being mimicked.

Old review:
Their orange chicken is really good, and the way that the tofu was cooked, it really had a tender meat-like consistency that surprised me a lot.

I only got to eat here twice so far, so I'm giving 4 stars.  If their other dishes are as good as what I've eaten so far, I may up it to 5."}
{"text":"I am so thrilled that this restaurant is here! The food at the loving hut is absolutely delicious.  You'd never know it's entirely vegan!  My absolute favorite is the Golden noodle soup with Wontons.  I order it every time I am in Pittsburgh.  It's just so flavorful yet delicate and the portion size is huge.  The other thing I tend to order are the Golden Wontons with Plum Sauce.  My mom always orders the Ginger vegetables, and I am so pleased to say that they even offer vegan Pho, something I cannot find often elsewhere.  I definitely need to try to Clay Pot with Mushrooms next time I am in town.  
Another thing about this lovely spot is that it is always extremely tranquil and clean.  The simple decor with positive messages makes for a very calming dining experience.  Also, the owner and his family are always so genuinely nice and happy to see us!  I always leave with a smile on my face.
Additionally, they offer a buffet once in awhile if you're into that sort of thing.  And the deserts are pretty delish if you have any room left.  I can't say enough good things about  the Loving Hut!  Go there and enjoy!"}
{"text":"I preface this review by saying that I love meat and was skeptical about going to a vegan place for dinner.

Nevertheless, I came here with 3 friends one evening. They have a nice selection of items to choose from, so even for carnivores like myself, there's something that should appeal to everyone. 

I had a stir-fried noodle dish with tofu and mixed veggies. It tasted good and was filling enough, although it was a bit on the greasy/salty side. ( I just assume to make vegan food taste good you need to go heavy on the oil/salt!) My friends enjoyed their meals as well, although no one left raving about the food. 

I think if you're actually a vegan, this would be a great place. But for an average guy who likes meat, I don't think there's enough of a reason for me to come back here anytime soon."}
{"text":"Cult vibes + delicious lemongrass mock chicken. I try to avoid meat substitutes in general these days but Veggie House holds a special place in my heart."}
{"text":"I'm a vegetarian and am always on the lookout for new veggie places opening.  Loving Hut opened last month in Toronto and apparently is a franchise with many different international locations.  This restaurant is all vegan and tasty.  We tried the summer rolls, Thai Green Curry, lentil soup and the Golden Burst Fried rice, which were all very good. No room for dessert, although I would have loved to have tried a cupcake!"}
{"text":"The service was good, but the food was terrible. I prefer healthy green vegan food rather than soy protein product and meat substitutes. The atmosphere is WEIRD! I'll never go back here."}
{"text":"Ok. I love the concept.  The recommendations were high.  Unfortunately we went there on the first Sunday of the month, which is apparently  a Buffet only day.   the food was very good.   Service was slow and spoke broken English.  ( it was hard to understand that it was buffet only Sunday.  I learned that from a friend later)
The price of the buffet was not posted nor communicated.    It was about $15 per person.    Not worth the selection you were given.  So based on that I disagree with the single $ rating.   Didn't get a chance to look at the regular menu pricing.     If the food wasn't as good as it was, the rating would have been a single star.  We will try this place again on a regular day."}
{"text":"The Loving Hut gets alot of love from the likes of me.  I am dating a vegan, but I knew about it before she told me.  As of late it has become one of my favorite Asian gourmet restaurants.  The quality of the food is very high and the price is exceptionally low.  All the different ways that they make mock meat is very impressive.  Where others have tried to replicate the taste and texture of meat and failed miserably, they succeed gracefully.  The mock meats are full of wonderful, unexpected surprises.  The vegetables are always cooked nicely and the staff are kind and efficient."}
{"text":"My first all vegan restaurant!  It was good.  I am giving only 4 stars because most of the dishes have soy in it, which I avoid even more than meat, based on research done by Westin A Price.  However Loving Hut was more than accommodating for my abnormal soy aversion and informed me they had Yam protein, which I ordered and gladly devoured.  The yam protein mimicked or at least looked like shrimp.  The Pad Thai tasted as I expected Pad Thai would taste in any restaurant. 

The clientele there seem to be abnormally friend and conversation tend to move toward how everyone became vegan, which seems to be brought on first by a bout of bad health issues.  It is a bit odd to overhear so many conversations on the same subject matter, which are almost like small testimonials for the vegan concept.  

I say to eat and know you can live without animal protein....!"}
{"text":"Tak about a bummer of a meal. My hubby and I were in Scottsdale from CA for a weekend getaway and we're on a plant based diet right now (not usually vegetarian / vegan), and the good reviews for the Loving Hut drew us in for Valentine's Day dinner. 

Food was actually delicious. Like I said, we are not even vegan but it was good. I had the Spicy Cha Cha (super breaded, which I didn't realize, but it was good). Hubby had the Clay Pot, and we also started with the wontons. 

Service is why I can't give this place more than two stars. It took FOREVER to get our food. I'm not exaggerating when I say it took more than an hour from when we ordered to when hubby's food came out. And another 15 min for mine! He was done before mine came out. And yeah, it was crowded, but not the typical crazy you see at other places on Valentine's Day. 

I'm not giving it one star because at least one waitress - not ours mind you, a different one - noticed me sitting there with no food as hubby finished, so she inquired with us. When we told her mine never came out, she checked on it, eventually bringing it out and also taking it off the bill. 

Anyway, that was our experience. Good food, very very very slow, subpar service, with the exception of one nice waitress who went out of her way to check on us. We wouldn't return, even if we did live in the area."}
{"text":"Love this spot for great vegan food! I've tried almost everything on the menu and it never disappoints! I will say the spicy cha cha, sweet and sour diving, and loving hut burger are some of my favorites! Even if your not vegan you will love it!!"}
{"text":"Tons of options on the menu. I had the rainbow salad which was pretty good.
The food isn't oily which is great, and I think all if not most of the items are organic.
The desserts are from sweets from the earth company which makes amazing cakes."}
{"text":"My meat loving husband not only tolerates this place, he actually likes it! Neither of us are vegetarians, but Loving Hut produces filling and satisfying meals. \"Fake\" meat can sometimes taste weird, but they do a great job with it. No weird textures or flavors. They do go pretty heavy on the \"vegans will save the world\" sort of thing, but the quality of the food makes up for it. If meat eaters feel guilty with the decor, you can always get it to go!"}
{"text":"Great service, decent food.

Loved the deep fried wontons and enjoyed the royal noodle soup. The broth itself was a little lacking in flavour, but quite nice. It was enough for two whole meals (literally, I had the other half of the noodles for lunch the next day and was quite full). The takeout containers are compostable paper, which was a nice touch.

The only crappy thing about the place is the bright, harsh fluorescent lighting and the flat TVs showing \"Supreme Master TV\", which appears to be some kind of religious channel which was a little annoying and garish to look at.  Also, I caught the word \"vivisection\" on the subtitle in front of some cute animals. Not something I want to look at when I'm eating."}
{"text":"I was traveling on business in Pittsburgh and when I travel. ..I look for vegan restaurants!  This wonderful little restaurant was perfect. The entire week of my trip in Pittsburgh. ..myself and my colleague ate dinner at Loving Hut every night.
The owner was lovely,  charming and because I'm allergic to soy and tofu he accommodated my needs with various substitute veggies. 
Also...As a side note..I don't care for sweets however I tried the vegan cake and it was DIVINE!!"}
{"text":"I live this place . I been a client since day 1 , when Arthur and Lana used to work there .. the owner it's always very welcoming and they have the best drinks and food .. now with there tiki bar it makes it even better .. reservations for the tiki bar it's a must"}
{"text":"Yummy food and nice people. The Hawaiian burger is divine. Great choice for vegans and vegetarians, as well as carnivores wanting to try something new."}
{"text":"OK, so it's a little weird. But kind of sweet and weird, like your little great aunt who collects figurines and has a plastic cover on her couch, but still makes you fresh-baked cookies when you come over. Let me tell you guys I am generally a meat fan. But I'm also an omnivore, so if you can do something fantabulous with vegetables, I'm all in. I do takeout because the interior decor is a little too 80's blinding white-tile kitchen for me, but everything I've ordered has been amazing. Spicy fake-shrimp thing? YUM. All those light, refreshing, tofu-and-veggie-riffic rice-paper rolls? Yup. Going home and grilling a steak for dinner? Sure. That's just how I roll."}
{"text":"My husband and I finally made it to the Saturday buffet and all I can say is...What took us so long?? This is a vegetarian's dream (meat eaters will love it as well, as my husband did), and a great opportunity to try many of they featured dishes on their menu. My favorite was the soup, served piping hot in a slow cooker (#10 on their menu). My only complaint is that the food on the buffet could have been hotter (there seem to be heat lamps but most of the items were served luke-warm). Great selection, great service, and reasonably-priced. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"First time at the hut an I'm really impressed with the food! I had the summer roll to start and it blew me away with the flavors and textures it contained. Next came the Mongolian beef (minus the beef!) but it looked and tasted alot like beef. It was scrumptious! I can't wait to come back and try more things! It isnt much to look at inside or out, but they have some great food at good prices. And it's good for you!"}
{"text":"Great food, creepy cult atmosphere. Ministry tape is on ALL THE TIME...it's just weird. 
The food is really good though order ahead and pick it up to go."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place. The girl at the counter was really sweet. My only complaint is it was a little too salty."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place five stars, I really do. I've been to all vegan (this place is no, but is close) Chinese restaurants in NY, Philly and Boulder, and was hoping that this would be similar.

It took us three tries to even get to eat here, as they have odd hours to start with, and seemed to be closed sometimes when their sign said that they should be open.

The first time, we were the ONLY people in the whole place, and it still took us 45 minutes to get served, and another 20 from when we were done until we could get our check. The second visit, there were other people there, but there were more servers, and it took, no kidding, over an hour to even get our soup. AN HOUR.  Our tea pot and water glasses were empty long before that.

The food? It's ok.  It's not amazing, but as a vegetarian, it's nice to know that you can eat anything on a menu. The Mushroom Hot Pot was ok but a little bland. I liked the steamed dumplings, but the sauce was a bit odd.

Don't forget the odd TVs all around the place playing interesting cult-like clips about Supreme Master Ching Hai and his biddings. Which is kinda cool to begin with, but when you're sitting there for an hour or two, it gets a bit old.

I really wanted to like this place, but I can't. We won't be going back unless they get a big overhaul."}
{"text":"I went looking for this place once about three weeks ago and had trouble finding it. When we did find it, we realized it was because it is now Loving Hut. We called last weekend and they told us that they were re-opening this past Tuesday (7/20/2010). We went back yesterday for dinner.

The place is nice and quiet and very white--white walls, white chairs, white tables, white dishes, white everything! I'm not sure if this is intentional, so whatever. The lady who sat us was nice, but we only saw her for about two seconds before a grumpy waitress came over. It may have been the language barrier or that she kept giving us what looked like Stink Eye the whole time we ordered. She also kept asking me if I was sure I wanted the Royal Noodle Soup because it was supposedly \"real spicy.\" It wasn't, in case you're wondering. 

They have a TV going with all kinds of Vegan/Religious propaganda, but it didn't really bother me. I can see where others might be turned off from the place though. Our food came out eventually and it was okay. I've had better Vegan Chinese food in Tucson (see, Guilins) with a friendlier staff and better portions and prices. 

Some of the other reviewers mentioned they have free tea, but they don't any more. As we were finishing up, someone who must have been a regular was flipping their menu over and over looking for items that are no longer served, I'm guessing. She was asking the waitress if they still had ____ because couldn't find it on their menu (which was already very limited).

It was an interesting experience, but I doubt I'll go back any time soon."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and awesome vegan food. Lucky lemongrass and spicy mambo are my fave. They offer white or brown rice. Buffets every saturday"}
{"text":"A nice, quiet little place with vegan fare. I enjoyed my entree, though I wish it had been a little less salty. The staff was very nice. They're part of a weird religious movement, so they play the videos of their \"supreme master\" quietly on the TV in the background. A little weird, but apart from that, they offer a nice selection of vegan Asian-style food."}
{"text":"We were taken up by their Vegan offering, as we are vegetarians. Although the service was good, but food was ok. We would recommend anyone this restaurant out of their commitment for  compassion for animals, as according to them, they should not be slaughtered for food."}
{"text":"This is my first official Yelp review so that alone speaks volumes of this place. This place definitely deserves a review at the very least as more people should know about it!

The atmosphere is awesome (as it is with most all-vegan food restaurants) with mellow music playing throughout. Frames on the walls with amazing quotes and even one with celebrity vegans is also displayed. They embrace veganism here, which to me, is a plus as they understand the reasoning behind it.

Minh is excellent human being. He brought me the Summer Rolls when I had ordered the Special Rolls because he knew those would be a little harsh and more traditional Vietnamese with a strong scent. Boy, did I appreciate that greatly! 

Appetizer - The Summer Rolls set the standards high! Filled with jicama, carrots and other deliciousness wrapped around rice paper. The hoisin sauce was sweet and the peanuts were a nice touch! Everyone must try these!!!

Entree - Next, I ordered the Phò (#12 on the menu) which is a traditional Vietnamese noodle soup. I was excited since I haven't had Phò since I had become vegan. It was a good dish and the meats looked very real! If you've never had Phò, I would recommend you try it at least once. 

Dessert - The final and most delectable, by far, was the Oreo cake! I don't need to say anything about this other then: BUY IT. Buy it now! I mean, stop what you're doing, drive to Loving Hut, and get yourself a slice or 10.

Overall probably the best tasting, and truest vegan restaurant I have been to. They also mentioned that they have a buffet on Saturdays for brunch which I will definitely try and check out before I leave this city. Pittsburgh, you are one very fortunate place to own Loving Hut. 5/5"}
{"text":"I don't expect much when going to a vegan buffet, but this was a nice surprise! I'm not vegan myself, but am a supporter of all lifestyle choices :)One of our companions didn't even know it was vegan until he was told, so that says a lot. 

As much as I like the restaurant, I will probably opt for the regular menu next time. While the buffet is good, the flavors are all quite similar. The staff is warm and inviting, and the restaurant is a quirky little place. Pricing is a little high for Pittsburgh, but I suppose vegan food is generally more expensive. 

Next time I'm in the mood for a meatless meals I will visit again!"}
{"text":"I live in Manhattan. I am in love with this place. Every time I make the road trip down to Indy I will stop here for some vegan awesomeness! I read they have a buffet at Saturday. I want to make a road trip just for that... Just kidding... Not!"}
{"text":"It is hard to find a vegan restaurant in the Pittsburgh area but this is one I visit each time I am in town. Food is consistently good, the restaurant is clean and service is great. Although they are a chain the menu is different from location to location. In some cases I just ask for a slight revision to the menu item which they honor."}
{"text":"They have an all you can eat buffet that runs every Saturday. Some of my favorites are 'Lucky Lemongrass' and 'Lucky Chow Mein'. They also offer soup and salad. I love the cake squares and watermelon and canteloupe fruit for dessert, too. Walking in and being able to eat immediately is great. Nice staff. I think family run. Water is good here. It doesn't taste chlorinated at all. I should make a plan to go more often. They prefer cash.

Buffet prices:

Adult $14.99 
Children under 12 $9.99 
Children under 5 $4.99"}
{"text":"We love this place! This is gonna be a long review, so read on if you dare :-) My hubby and I are vegan due to health reasons for over four years now, but very rarely eat out, no vegan restaurants near our home, plus we have usually been disappointed by the food or service when we have tried eating out in the past, so we gave up trying. While in Phoenix two weeks ago (28 mile drive from where we live) we found this Loving Hut on Indian School Rd and decided to give vegan eating out one more go...Thankfully we arrived in time for the lunch menu, as they close at 2:30 pm and reopen at 5:00 pm. We were greeted by smiling faces and sat where we wanted in the open seating area. We were tickled to see all the options on the menu, especially heavy on the veggies and Vietnamese leaning, as i think the owners are two Vietnamese ladies, who are there in the forefront greeting and serving. We found all of the people there to be friendly and gracious. The young lady that took our order was very knowledgeable of the menu, helping us choose items, and explained that everything would be brought out as it is ready, whereas an entree may arrive before an appetizer.  We were fine with that and happily ordered away.  Appetizers we chose were the Summer Rolls and Mu Shu Vegetables...for main courses we ordered the Wonton Soup and the Loving Hut burger...wanting extra veggies we also ordered the Veggie Delight entree. We were enjoying the atmosphere and the pleasant staff so much that we didn't even notice how long it took to start receiving our food, but it was not too long and the feasting began! Everything looked beautiful and tasted fantastic!  We thoroughly enjoyed every bite and savored the flavor and obvious care and thoughtfulness in preparation by the cooks. Maybe we appreciated it more because we rarely eat meals away from home, but we were in vegan heaven! :-)  The servers were attentive and laid back, taking time to chat with us, which we appreciated. Some reviews on here are so negative, that is a shame, we had a totally happy experience, and no leftovers, we devoured everything! We loved it so much so that we drove 35 minutes again yesterday and returned with my Hubby's 81 year old carnivorous Mom, and she loved everything as well. We ordered almost all the same food as last week, but got the Heaven Rice Rolls instead of Mu Shu Vegetables, and TWO orders of Summer Rolls (delish!) plus Sizzling Rice Soup in addition to Wonton, and the  Love of Family entree. I asked for water sautéing for the Love of Family veggies as well as the tofu instead of oil, and the lovely server Diana (pronounced \"Dee-onna\") happily saw to it that that is what I got...Yum, yum! Also, my hubby subbed steamed veggies for the fries this time (with my more healthy minded nagging) with his Loving Hut Burger, while Mom went for the fries with her L.H burger. It was awesome seeing our mom happily eating plant based food and not missing the meat and dairy she so dearly loves...maybe we can convert her to our side with enough Saturday excursions to Phoenix! Ok, we won't be coming every week, but we now know we have a place where we can thoroughly enjoy delicious,  plant based food prepared and served with thoughtfulness, graciousness and deliciousness :-) infusing flavor in every bite...oh, and did I mention very reasonably priced too? We had all that food, plenty for three people, plus hot tea and coffee for only 67 dollars...plus we left what we hope was a generous tip...and took leftovers this time too! We would have happily paid more, but of course we are older and eating out is a rare event, so we splurged! Thank you everyone at Loving Hut Phoenix, see you next month!"}
{"text":"I've driven by this place hundreds of times and never stopped in. Now that I have, I'll be back. Helpful staff, good menu and excellent flavors. I had  the \"Frank's Veggie Steak and Potatoes\" and my friend had the \"Spicy Cha Cha.\" Even if you're not into vegetarian food, this is a worthwhile place to eat healthy."}
{"text":"It was a busy Friday evening. The place was packed, and they were short-handed.

They always make us feel like family when we come here - and we really haven't been here for several months. After a mild scolding for dissing them, they apologized in advance for what was to be a backlogged kitchen.

We missed their food, and we also wanted to try some of their newer dishes. We had a little hesitant seeing as that they only had one chef in the back today. But we wanted to try and give it a whirl anyway.

Therefore, we ordered the Pan Fried Dumplings, Wonton Soup, Veggie Delight, Save Our Oceans, and Frank's Veggie Steak and Potatoes. To close it all out, we also ordered the mint chocolate cake, and the Raspebrry Ice Cream.

To sum in all up, every one of these dishes turned out to be scrumptious and fresh! Not a single one of them disappointed us. Even if dinner did take longer than normal, the prompt and consistent check-in from Linda, Diane, and Jenny just kept informed as to their progress.

It may have bothered others, but it certainly wasn't an issue for us. 

It really is one of the best Vegan places in town, and their continued efforts to improve on the variety of their dishes just keeps us coming back time and time again - even if there are time lapses in between.

We trust that you will enjoy this place as much as we do!"}
{"text":"All Hail The Supreme Master

I've always been a meat eater. Love, love, rending cooked or raw flesh from bones or bite size bits from the tips of forks.

Was totally amazed that soy protein cooked properly can be just as good,  if not more tasty than meat. If I could eat like this every day I would be a vegetarian; no BFD!

The Food at Loving Hut is delicious, the atmosphere intriguing; WTF is the supreme master? She's this righteous chick that loves baby animals and thinks vegan lifestyle rocks, and that you should drive a hybrid.  Call it a cult, then call Mormonism a cult...oh you do?  Well it's not that culty, and it's more personality than anything, along with great healthy food!"}
{"text":"DON'T LET THE OUTSIDE SCARE YOU AWAY! This place is GREAT! It took a few mins to get seated/acknowledged, but I was in no rush. I got vegan Pho and it was the best I've ever had. If you want to leave off on a lightly sweet note, \"Peaceful Pink\" is what I recommend. (cranberry juice + soymilk topped with rose buds, SO GOOD!)"}
{"text":"We go out to dinner before our shows at Phoenix Theatre with another couple who are vegan. The Loving Hut came up and we were there just Saturday night. For appetizers we had the golden spring rolls, heaven ricer rolls and fried dumplings. All were tasty but my favorite was the rice rolls. For our entrees we ordered Spicy Cha Cha which was very delicious (I only tasted it) Mongolian Wok (my dish and it was ok as long as you had a bite with the veggies) , Save Our Ocean (was told it was Ok but wouldn't order it again) and the fourth dish was mixed veggies. Over all the best dish at the table was the Spicy Cha Cha. Desert I had a piece of the red velvet cake which was awesome also. Not much of an atmosphere but it's all about making Vegan meat substitute taste great or at least palatable."}
{"text":"The restaurant itself is oddly yet plainly decorated, which always makes me want to come in and give it a makeover whenever I eat there. The service is also slow but the workers are always friendly.

With that said, the food is great. I had the broccoli chicken and the texture and taste was so close to real meat that it was unbelievable. The flavor was great and authentic as well. The ginger chicken is also really delicious and has a nice potent taste. The cheesecake is incredible, it's almost my favorite part of eating here. Even if you're not normally a dessert person, I recommend trying it.

I wish this place wasn't as high priced as it is but the food is definitely cravable and worth it."}
{"text":"My son took me for Mothers Day and it was awesome. First time ever at a Vegan Restaurant so as you can expect I couldn't decide what to order, everything looked so good. I could choose anything on the menu versus having to sort through a menu when eating at regular restaurants. I had a cup of soup, orange chicken and sweet potato fries. There was so much food I had lunch the following day. Hostess/waitress was extremely polite, friendly and helpful. While waiting for our orders she checked back with us frequently. As for my son (the meat eater) he really enjoyed the food as well. Great job \"Loving Hut\"!"}
{"text":"I honestly have no idea how this place has a 4 star review. Though to be fair I've only been there once and perhaps it was just a really bad off-day for them. 

I work in the area and have tried most of the restaurants nearby, but have always avoided Loving Hut just based on the hideous signage and the menu. One day I decided to go for lunch because I have been wrong about places before that appear \"bad\" and thought this might be the case as well - nope. 

I do have to commend them for their service. The staff was super nice and welcoming and always checking in to ensure we were satisfied, but that's about the only plus I can give them. 

The food is just horrible. There are a lot of Asian dishes on the menu and honestly they were just plain bad. Like, worse than Manchu Wok bad. I can tolerate Manchu Wok - I absolutely cannot recommend the food here. 

If you like bad food/can't tell the difference then by all means support this business - they have a lot of heart. But if you care, or have working tastebuds, just do yourself a favour and go to Chinatown or something."}
{"text":"Just tried this place last weekend, it's DELICIOUS!!!!!! I had their pad thai it was so darn good :) I'm definitely coming back to this spot."}
{"text":"I really would love to give a better rating to a vegan restaurant. Unfortunately, I was disappointed with EVERYTHING. 
1. I waited 40 min for a take out (with only 2 occupied tables at that time)
2. A guy who ordered after me got a free piece of cake for the long wait. (it wasn't offered to me) 
3. Terrible service 
4. The decor is something you see in senior houses in Sun City
5. Almost all items on the menu have soy protein.. TVP? Is it really something healthy or it's some sort of cardboard pretending to be food?
6. They packed my to go order in such a way that the soup turned before I got to my car, soaking thru the paper bag, landing on my pants, and on the sidewalk...  I went inside to tell them that- NO apology, NO money back. 

I wonder why they are not closed yet."}
{"text":"SO delicious and love that everything is organic and many gluten-free options! Had the lunch special and will definitely return."}
{"text":"Food was excellent. We tried the mushroom wontons and the spring rolls along with the soy chicken (my boyfriend isn't vegan and loved it) I had to wonton soup. For desert we had the vegan death by chocolate cake and it was amazing, you can't even tell it was vegan."}
{"text":"As my wife and I explore the vegan lifestyle we have found this place to be exceptional. The garlic sensation is absolutely amazing. Highly recommend this place to people considering going vegan, or even just to try something different!"}
{"text":"I used to crush this place when I was veg. It's run by a cult, but if you can get past that it's in the house.

The lemon grass chicken almost had me convinced they were lying about it being vegetarian.  Service is relaxed not slow to clarify on other reviews.

It is especially good to hit up during lunch... really cheap then.  They also sell a lot of their faux meat products if you want to do some home cooking.

Rock the lemon grass chicken and the house chicken they are spot on and safe for non adventurous eaters.

PSA- they're closed from 2:30-5pm between lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place, I really did. But it just wasn't meant to be. From entering to leaving it just was not a good experience. 

The service was absolutely terrible. When we arrived we were not greeted, and it took quite a few minutes before anyone showed themselves to seat us. Once we put in our order it took 30 minutes to be served. In that time we saw people come in and be seated not by the staff, but by people waiting to pick up to go orders. This is simply unacceptable. 

The food is just okay. The flavor mostly comes from the sauces they use, not from the actual food.  So they can use the same protein sources in multiple dishes and just put a new sauce on it. The drinks however are pretty delish, but clearly not a reason to go out of your way or put up with terrible service. 

There are better choices for vegetarian food in the valley, and I would highly recommend going to one of them."}
{"text":"The food was great.  My husband, the carnivore, and my daughter, the vegan, both really liked the beefless Bahn Mi sandwich.  I had a pretty tasty plant based chili dog.  

We were the only ones there as it was late afternoon and so the service was excellent.  We ended up buying a bag of the vegetable protein meat substitute and were given directions on how to cook it."}
{"text":"Amazing healthy food. The curry was fantastic. Save the oceans was a wonderful day especially with the ginger sauce. One of my favorite places."}
{"text":"Love going anywhere vegan solely because I know I can order anything off of the menu. And Loving Hut did not disappoint. It's pretty much all Asian food, which I can totally jive with, and it was really yummy. I had an avocado fluffy quinoa salad that was super delicious, and my mum had noodles. The salad was very large and flavorful and very refreshing."}
{"text":"A full five stars--simply outstanding food, and all cruelty-free/environmentally friendly too!

Negatives:  so-so decor and overwhelmed service staff on occasion.  Water glasses weren't filled up simply because they were so busy.

Go--you'll like it!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place. I found it through Yelp and have been going there ever since. I love the PHO and the Heaven rolls with Avocado. The Padi Thai and BBQ noodles are yummy too. I also enjoy the lentil soup they serve free at lunch. It's delicious!! I am a customer for life.."}
{"text":"Great option for vegans and vegetarians. Priced well. The service can be lacking, as it was on the occasion I visited, but the food has me coming back for more. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Everything I have tried here has been awesome . They also sell vegan dog food and goodies like vegan jerky which I love."}
{"text":"Really like it. Haven't try some of the \"meat\" before I never liked it but it was good I had to double check it wasn't meat lol got the golden spring roll it was okay. Really like the Mongolian plate! Over all great service. 

**Went to try the other loving hut in Tempe but it close from 3-5  I didn't check the time."}
{"text":"Solid asian fusion,  vegan, vegetarian resto, but nothing remarkable from my two visits so far.  

I've had their mango salad and thai curry.  I loved the mango salad the first time, but had it again and didn't love it as much.  They use ripe mangoes and cube it, so it's different from their typical julienned green mango salads.  It's topped with some fried garlic, which lends it a sweet-salty flavour.  I think the mangoes weren't sweet enough the second time around making it a tad salty. 

The thai curry is good.  Lots of tofu, cauliflower, carrots, potatoes.  It's not too spicy and is served with white rice (brown rice is an extra buck).  It's pretty standard, imo.

The space here is nice.  It wasn't too busy at lunch time, which was nice.  It's spacious and clean.  The service is super pleasant. 

I was sad that they didn't have the Save the World burger, which is served on an organic bun.  I'll probably come back to try it!  

Small piece of advice: what's up with the name?  It sounds like a massage parlour, no?"}
{"text":"I'm really new to all this, but always like to try new things.  Makes life more exciting. But I digress...

Went with a friend and we both ordered Thai Curry, which consists of veggies and tofu in the curry paste I believe.  I was in the mood for rice noodles and had that added and replaced the tofu with textured vegetable protein (TVP), along with extra spicy.  Like, hot hot. :) 

The TVP takes some getting used to.  For me personally, I liked it at the beginning but not as much at the end.  It was very different for me but the dish itself was yummy and had a light curry flavour.  Fresh peppers, onion, cabbage, etc.  The spicy was light for my taste.  It might have been the fact that I asked for them to add more stuff to the dish to make it spicy, but it kept leaking over the side onto the table.  Had to keep mopping it up with a napkin.  

For dessert I ordered vanilla bean ice cream made from coconut milk. Couldn't go without a double chocolate chip vegan cookie.  Kind of funny but I envisioned the ice cream sitting on top of the cookie and never mentioned it, but that's how it was brought to the table.  Crazy.  Like they read my mind.  

Staff were really friendly and attentive as well.  Cute little place to visit."}
{"text":"This place is a vegetarian mecca and a lot of the soy meat is gluten free which is a huge perk for people like me. The atmosphere could use some work but the food is good and it is priced well. They have fresh juices and a very healthy vibe. The service is always good and it is never super packed. If you have veggie friends that haven't discovered this place it is a gem."}
{"text":"The food in this place is clean and yummy, havent had a bad meal there.  The summer roll is always our starter, and it comes with a yummy sauce for dipping.  Perfect portion size for sharing but not filling you up so you can enjoy your dinner.  I change my entree each time I go there - my hubby loves the Lemongrass Chicken for its many flavors.  Brown rice is cooked perfect, nutty with a great texture.  Price is reasonable for a vegan restaurant and the staff/family owned are very friendly and nice.

Only cons are the drink selection is minimal - and expensive ($3.99 per juice).  And that the staff may be a bit over attentive... coming over to fill water and clear plates and interupting conversation.

DEFINITELY will eat here on a regular basis.  Always concerned that they wont be there when we go as not sure how busy they are in the location.  Fingers crossed that they stay for a good long time as I enjoy the clean, healthy food option."}
{"text":"This is mine and my husband's favorite vegan restaurant in Phoenix. The portions are big and its affordable. I like everything from here and my favorite desert is the raw vegan cheesecake!"}
{"text":"Not as good as the SFO locations, but still a tasty Vegan option when you're craving Thai.
Tofu shrimps are creepy yet delicious, the REALLY look, taste and \"feel\" like shrimp and the curry is delicious.

The restaurant is clean, so if strange Vegan cults are your thing you may wish to stay and order a glass of  \"Kool-Aid\" with your fake shrimp. But I'm not going to lie, The weird Supreme Being cult stuff is a bit off-putting, so you may want to take your food to go and avoid the sudden urge to become a Breatharian."}
{"text":"Yummmmmmm!!!! :) Best vegetarian restaurant in Phoenix!! Awesome, delicious, flavorful , hearty and vegan!! Definitely a restaurant for food lovers. I thought Green was happening and prior to that I was Fresh Mint addict but this place takes the cake! I haven't eaten in yet because the decor is a bit dated but takeout is fast and fantastic only ever takes 10-15 min to get your order made so perfect spot to grab dinner on the way home. Great prices and large portion sizes! Best vegetarian restaurant in Phoenix!!"}
{"text":"I drive by this place every day...and I was honestly scared to go in until I got a tip from a very reliable source that this place was delicious. I tried simple, sweet and sour chick'n...it was SO GOOD. I told myself I wouldn't become a vegan fast food junkie but this place makes it hard to keep that promise. I came back today to try the Hawaiian burger and it was good. I might do without the pineapple next time...I know that's what's so Hawaiian about it! I just don't like baked fruit...freaks me out...  So with that said, go try it, even if you're not Vegan; a healthy cruelty free meal will do you some good :D"}
{"text":"This place is pretty cool, love the eggplant!  Stuffed tomatoes were yuck, but it was a texture thing...and taste thing;).  I also tried the carrot cake, maybe I'm used to the amazing desserts that vegan bakeries have/ the cake was dry with hardly ang frosting; gave it to my dog:(. The feel of this place is like a cafeteria... The people are friendly, the food all vegan (that gets a star). I go there when I'm hungry and by myself- usually see a few people having a meal alone in there... Worth checking out if your vegan or at least foood conscience;) try the eggplant!  I subtracted a star because of the huge tv, it's really annoying."}
{"text":"I'm giving 4 stars for your presence in the community, but I thought the food was below average.

I went for the Saturday buffet. I ordered wontons and crispy spring rolls but they were tasteless and awful

The buffet items needed flavor!! Or sauce, the fried soy nuggets were tasteless except the awesome lemongrass covered nuggets.
The skewered soy nuggets were bland and too dense.


Kale soup was good but needed salt, pepper

Green beans needed garlic and salt and cooked longer

The banana and chocolate cakes were awesome. Moist and perfect

The pink fruit drink I ordered was awesome

Lo Mein was bland and tasteless"}
{"text":"Thank you for Awesome Vegan Food!!! All the soups are great! The fried rice is heavenly! I just wish they were open in the evenings too!"}
{"text":"Don't be mislead by the vegan label. Whether you're a carnivore or not Loving Hut is a restaurant worth your time. They take great time and care to make Asian/Vietnamese dishes that are healthy and great tasting. Best in all of Arcadia hands down. 

Try the pad Thai it's a home run, any way you slice it!"}
{"text":"I have been to several vegan places to eat. The food here was exceptionally good. One thing I take issues with at most vegan places, is that they shove veganism down your throat. As an omnivore and a foodie I appreciate how this place has just a slight essence of pro vegan and what they have on the walls is very positive. Awesome food and great people. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"The service was great and everyone was so nice! The food is amazing! the best vegetables I've ever had in the area, fresh and well cooked. The ambience is a bit stark and cafe like, but the food makes up for it. 

I will be here again! Fantastic! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Mmmmmm! I'm having the Spice Coconut Pad Thai as I write this. It's a bit too much for me but that's because I'm abstemious.
Just the right amount of spicy. Vegetables cooked to perfection.
Great job, Loving Hut!"}
{"text":"I went there twice and ordered the Savoury Crips both times and it was one of the most amazing thing I have ever eaten. The Soy protein was great, the sauce was great and the organic potato fries were the best. I am certainly going back for more and trying other food on the menu. I am so glad I found this place!"}
{"text":"This is an amazing place! 5 stars 
Pros: 
Very clean place, very comfortable, spacious even the bathroom was clean 

Vegan, Fresh and it tastes good I felt healthy after eating here I didn't regret it like how you do after other buffets or restaurants 

quality food, even the fruit was pretty fresh. I was surprised it was all vegan I'm a meat eater trying to turn vegan and the food really wow'ed me!

good service: not like other places that rush you the bill after an half hour, and stop serving you water. we hung around for like an hour and we didn't feel rushed and they kept refilling us.

Cons

small menu there weren't many options but the ones they had satisfied me. 

I will definitely be coming back here to eat again! I recommend this place to anyone not just vegans"}
{"text":"Love this place like crazy!!!!! The restaurant is huge and its generally not very packed. The special and summer rolls are a must every time! My husband loves their crispy rolls. Their soups( wonton and pho) are amazing! The BBQ noodles are one of my favorites as well as their smoothies! And you have to try the cheesecake (with cherries on top) for dessert! The buffet is good, but I definitely prefer their menu items better! Expect to spend $20 per person to get appetizer, dinner and desert."}
{"text":"Their food is mediocre. And I know processed proteins are not cheap, but the small portion should already compensated it. However they don't tell you the Asian dishes you ordered do NOT come with rice! You have to order rice to eat with the dishes! They told me it's because some people like to just eat it without rice. I seriously have NO idea how anyone could eat such a salty dish alone!!! I have never seen any Asian restaurant that charges their customer for rice (extra ones maybe), even western style Asian fusion places. But they do and not a sign on their menu. This is ridiculous. Just a heads up for anyone wanna eat there. And for the restaurant, if you really want to get more money raise the price of your food. This feels like cheating. I really think Loving Hut is overrated."}
{"text":"I ordered the crispy wontons and they were awesome! 

I ordered the Mongolian beef and it was really really really good!!!

Awesome food for vegans vegetarians or carnivores. 

A beautiful place to enjoy a meal"}
{"text":"I live in San Diego, am a daily organic juicer at home and would love to see more of these delicious organic places in the world, well they're evolving and spreading:) yay!
Cute tasteful place, love the white clean look inside and friendly service.
Her recommendations were spot on and I was surprised how well flavored the cup of wonton soup came out. I also ordered a carrot celery juice, little tiny bit too heavy on the celery but still plenty of delicious carrot flavor. Also ordered a half plate (thanks again for 100% great service in allowing me to order  a snack sice!) of veggies, not just a bunch of cheap ones but the good stuff, broccoli, coliflour, bokchoy etc.
Also superbly prepared and well seasoned. I will definitely be back again for a bigger meal while I am here in Toronto! Excellent:) Thank you!"}
{"text":"Sooooo good!!! I'm disappointed in myself for waiting so long to try this place out. The food is amazing and the service was great! What more could you ask for? I had the Heaven Rice Rolls and the Pad Thai. Both were beautifully presented and SO delicious. The tofu on my Pad Thai was much more flavorful than tofu usually is elsewhere. 

Most importantly, I got a chocolate milkshake to go on my way out, and OH MY GOSH. I've been vegan for a year now, and I don't think I've had a milkshake the entire time. It was amazing. I thought I was full from dinner but I definitely finished the whole thing within 10 minutes. Amazing.

Can't wait to come back and try more of what they have to offer!"}
{"text":"Its a good place to eat if your looking at an simple meal. The menu is asian inspired and they offer other varities as well so its quite okay (not as extensive as the ones I saw in other vegan restaurants). As for the place, its clean and quiet whenever we come in so its a nice place to dine in. 

I would come back for sure and recommend it to anyone who wants to try vegan food for the first time."}
{"text":"Amazing! The rose lemonade is a must, hands down the best lemonade I've ever had. I tried the rice paper appetizer rolls which were pretty good. For lunch I had the ocean sandwich which was a great pick. My boyfriend had the loving burger and also said that was pretty good. I'd definitely come back if ever back in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"We loved this place when we first found it. We went several times, but were often disappointed because the food was inconsistent.  It was wonderful on one visit and mediocre the next. We were not surprised when we discovered that they had closed. The last time we were there it was last winter and the dining room was so cold that diners were wearing their winter coats indoors."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant, I enjoy the one on Union Hills more often as it is closer to where I am staying here!
The food is always perfect, service is good and it is a relaxing atmosphere!
the \"fish\" is to die for, almost scary how real it looks and tastes!
Always take my out of town guests here!"}
{"text":"Best meat that is made from plants in town. I took a friend of mine who had lived in Thailand for eight years and married a woman from Thailand.  He was impressed with their beef noodles.  He said that he would not have guessed. The cuisine is Oriental and pretty darn tasty at an honest price.  Their cheeseburger is a cheeseburger - except it is vegan. Try it. Your mouth will love it. I like the clay pot too."}
{"text":"As a vegan for over 10 years, i hate to NOT support a tried and true vegan restaurant in phoenix. But i have to be honest and say that this place did not live up to my expectations. In fact, it fell quite short. I ate at the Glendale Loving Hut location and had a FAR better experience there, so my review here is only for the Phoenix location. By all means, DO go to the Glendale one! It has a different menu and completely different atmosphere.

The phoenix location on Indian School Road has a very drab interior, and very outdated. White metal chairs that looked like they were from the '80s. My first impression walking in was not a good one, and that is important to me. Definitely not a soothing relaxing atmosphere by any means. Also, there was a bad odor in the air. Almost smelled fishy to me. It almost made me lose my appetite to be perfectly honest. 

Ok, now on to the food. I got the Grilled Teryaki dish. By the way, did i mention prices are also higher at this location? $9.00 was the cost of this dish -- for lunch! Prices are a couple dollars less at the Glendale spot. Anyways, the faux meat in this dish was fine -- nothing to write home about, but it was \"good\". However, my complaint is that is ALL it was. Just a big pile of fake meat, and a small portion of lukewarm steamed vegetables on the side with no sauce or marinades on them. Just plain vegetables, and they were getting colder by the minute. Not really what i had in mind for lunch and certainly not worth the $9.00 plus the tip. I guess i should have gotten the rice to go with it all, but that was extra money!

The complimentary lentil soup was a nice touch, but i've had better lentil soup that i've made myself. The soup too was only lukewarm, and very small cup size portion.

The only positive i can say is that the waitress was wonderful and very friendly. I feel bad writing a bad review, but honesty is my policy."}
{"text":"\"I partake not in the meat, nor the breastmilk, nor the ovum, of any creature, with a face.\" --Todd Ingram from \"Scott Pilgrim vs. the World\"

Okay...if you're a vegan...my apologies.  Probably you don't have a lot of awesome \"dining out\" experiences that aren't in Tibet, and unfortunately I suspect this is one more venue to get more of the same not awesomeness.  But I need to preface this review with a couple caveats.  

1)  I don't know what \"good\" tofu tastes like.  I suppose it is hypothetically possible that the tofu I had was good, or even great and that gross texture and vaguely egg-like taste is considered fine tofu dining.
2)  I've never had Jasmine tea.  

Okay...so the good:

The place is new (ish), nicely decorated, and clean as a whistle.  The tables are these polished white lacquer affairs that are so shiny clean you feel like you can eat directly off of them.  

The service was very friendly.

The crispy rolls were great.  I don't know what was in them...as a non-vegan, it wasn't important, because I just wanted to try them, but if there is something that is typically IN a spring roll/egg roll that deveganizes it...they should just eliminate it in all of them because these were just as good as any \"normal\" egg roll/spring rolls.

Okay, so I ordered tea with my meal.  The little old man asked me if I wanted Green tea or Jaasdfdfasdafadsf tea.  I spell it that way because the two or three times I asked him to repeat I couldn't figure out what he was saying, and only after he brought it to the table did I put it together that he was saying jasmine.  He said it would have more flavor and it did.

It also had a lovely floral aroma, except that after inhaling near it, I stopped short and offered a whiff across the table to my lunch companions.

\"Smell this.\" 

One girl took it and inhaled.  \"Oh!  That is flowery..., but....\"

\"Say it,\" I said.

She looked vaguely uneasy.

\"SAY IT!\" I repeated.

\"It sorta smells like a bathroom air freshener.\"

\"Yeah,\" I said, \"It DOES\".  

So this is where my inexperience with Jasmine tea comes in.  MAYBE...maybe jasmine tea is SUPPOSED to smell like a men's room urinal cake.  I don't know.  Maybe it's just an unfortunate Pavlovian association that when I smell jasmine, I think of urinal cakes because so many urinal cakes come standard with \"jasmine scent\".  So the image that the commercial portray about the woman enjoying the early morning hours with closed eyes, her cup of tea raised gently to her lips, her face enwreathed in aromatic steam...the camera switches over to a summer rain falling softly in a green meadow???  Well when I closed my eyes and put the cup to my lips...the vision that popped into my mind was sitting in the men's room drinking tea from the crapper.  So that was sorta an appetite killer.

The other girl bought a sweet and sour chicken that she said she liked.  The 'soy protein' chicken LOOKED like chicken.  She said it more or less tasted like chicken too, but \"Maybe a little gummier.\"  Okay...I could have dealt with that.  My 'soy protein' was brown...and had an odd texture.  I think it was intended to resemble beef, but if we can return for a moment to my previous men's room analogy...it more resembled something found THERE.  It was a little tough, and I didn't love the taste.

The broth in my soup though?  Spicy and tasted pretty good! 

Okay...so some mistakes were made on MY part.  Jasmine tea = NO.  Bon Hue (what I ordered) = NO.  BUT...I would go again.  I like to try new things, and I feel like there were other things on the menu that offered more promise than the selections I made.  

I give it two stars, but reserve the right to change my mind if at some point (maybe six months from now or so) I return and try something that I like even a LITTLE more than what I selected."}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place! The decor of the restaurant is definitely casual...very simplistic. Great for grabbing a quick bite. Everything was served extremely fast! Wonderful menu with mostly Asian influence. Huge portions, and the veggie meat was quite tasty. We ordered the spring rolls, the pad thai and the NY charm. I absolutely loved the ny charm, and the pad thai was ok. 
I WILL be back to try some more of their meatless creations!"}
{"text":"I've been to several Loving Huts of the world, and this one is not quite up to par. Output of menu items is terribly inconsistent, and the orders often do not quite match the description - usually lacking vegetables listed. I have ordered the same thing several times, and have received something different on each occasion. My favorite thing about this Loving Hut, is that they carry some desserts from Vegan Treats (based in Bethlehem, PA), however they are typically stale! I don't even think they are worshiping the Supreme Master as devoutly, for the TV is rarely on and the propaganda area is sparse. I do admire the Cult as business model approach and would consider Buddhist-derivitive fascism as a potentially viable idea for future world harmony."}
{"text":"I'm not a vegetarian or vegan... and I made a slip to ask \"what kind of meat is in the burger?\"

The service is wonderful. The girls working there were very nice and quite attentive.

My favourite dishes
- Rainbow salad - the dressing was good, and the vegetables were fresh and it has a nice crisp to each bite.
- Lentil soup - flavour in every bite.
- Save the World! \"Burger\" - oh so juicy! It taste like a burger. The side of fries were crispy on the outside, soft on the inside. 

Other dishes I ordered...
- Carrot soup - meh...
- Eggplant Black bean Sauce - meh... 

The best part, is that all their food is Organic, Vegan, Non-GMO, and Peanut & Nut Free!"}
{"text":"I adore Loving Hut there's one over on 35th and Union Hills that I absolutely adore so we figured this location would be similar when we decided to eat here. We were very. Very disappointed. 
We sat down and the atmosphere was nice and we had out orders taken and our drinks came out very quickly which was nice. It's kind of a crowded Saturday night so we weren't too impatient about it taking a little while. 

We waited about 30 minutes and the first dish came out. 
Then another 15 minutes and the second dish came out. 
And THEN another 10 minutes finally our last dish came out only after asking the server about it because it had been a full 50 minutes since we ordered and I had noticed that guests who came in long after us were getting their dishes. They apologized, but my other friends had already completely finished their meals before mine even arrived and then we paid the ridiculous prices for it all. I'm so disappointed with the service even though the food was great. I will not be returning to this location at all."}
{"text":"My favorite vegan places of all time! The service is quick and food is always seasoned to perfection and consistent. The owners, they are very sweet. The wife makes you feel like family. She's always happy go lucky and is very prompt. The Au Lac Soup here is amazinggggg!!! My fiancé loves the Bun Hue! Always perfect!!"}
{"text":"I am neither a vegan or vegetarian, but due to dietary restrictions I *do* need to eat gluten-free. 

It seems like their menu has contracted recently, though I quite like the fact that gluten-free items are very clearly labelled.  Gluten-free offerings include most dishes and one dessert, though the waiter indicated that with some modifications (essentially subbing wheat noodles for rice noodles) virtually any item other than desserts and avocado tacos could be made gluten-free. They use potato starch in place of flour where possible which means items like soups, which are usually off-limits for Celiacs at restaurants, are safe.

The food was freshly prepared and very tasty.  Portion sizes were quite large for the price and service was both prompt and friendly. 

All in all the experience was fantastic.  I'd honestly give it 5 stars were it not for the questionable backing of the chain itself, but the operators of this specific franchise were extremely helpful and friendly... but I guess that's how they get 'ya."}
{"text":"Very rarely am I so excited about a place that I have to run right home and write a review. Our lunch experience today at Loving Hut warrants such a response. My wife and I had obviously looked at the menu prior to our visit and were excited to try the vegan goodies. Imagine our delight when we arrived during the Saturday buffet, so we had the opportunity to try EVERYTHING. And I sure did. 
We absolutely loved the food. I went back to the buffet three times and I'm not ashamed to admit it. I adored the sweet and sour tofu, with mixed veggies and pineapple and a crazy tasty sauce. The fabulous Mongolian was a really great texture and reminded me more of beef than anything I've eaten since I stopped eating meat. And the sauce was killer! The crispy tofu delivered on it's promise of being, well, crispy. The guru fried rice was very flavorful, with traces of cilantro with a yummy curry taste. As other Yelpers have mentioned, the best thing on the menu (and perhaps in the world) was the lucky lemongrass chicken nuggets. Between the two of us we devoured soooooo many of these I thought I was going to have to loosen my belt. Wowwwwww these are remarkable. Crunchy and juicy and tasty, oh my! I will be talking and thinking about these until our next trip to Loving Hut. The pandan cake and vegan chocolate cake were the perfect finish to a very indulgent meal. The strip mall location is a bit unassuming. But the interior was clean and modern and the overall experience was divine. It's nice to have an all vegan option near the city (though not near enough now that we've discovered it) and it's wonderful to have such an amazing variety of vegan dishes to obsess over. Can't wait to return!!"}
{"text":"Tasty, even if you are not a vegetarian, you will like this place. The food is great, it is inexpensive. The atmosphere is a bit lacking, but two out of three ain't bad."}
{"text":"We went and were really surprised at how good the food was. J got a \"seafood clay pot\" and I got the \"Ginger Duck\". We also got the \"Shreded Pork roll\". The Pork rolls were amazing - hands down one of the tastiest things i've had in a while. Turns out that my husband could not eat them due to the peanuts hiding in there, (note to Allergy people) but he got a good taste of it and agreed that it was good. His dinner was the best - the \"seafood\" having the right consistancy (something that felt like squid, a \"shrimp\" that was very close to shrimp flavor, and something that I swear tasted like the chinese sasuage from my youth - yummm!) and the sauce tasty and not too salty. My Ginger duck was too salty - the consistancy was ok, but the salt was just too much. After dinner, we ordered the Flan (which was the main reason that we came here in the first place). Sadly, like many veg/vegan restaurants, the dessert was awful. I think the \"flan\" was agar agar with some applejuice and some brown rice syrup. It was WAY TOO SWEET and looked (and felt) just like snot. Totally non appetising - icky jellowish texture. Service was a bit slow..but I think they view it as \"laid back\". The atmosphere was lacking as well - bright lights, cafeteria feel. I'd higly suggest for them to bring in more plants, paint the walls something other than pale pink, and tone down those overhead lights. This is not a date spot - just a good place for tasty food."}
{"text":"Very very good veggie/vegan option in phoenix. Amazing fake shrimp made from yam protein."}
{"text":"Unbelievable yummy food, a vegan paradise! And you don't have to be vegan to enjoy their food. I only wish there was locations around the city of Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I went into this place weirdly expecting Pauly Shore to pop out exclaiming, \"Welcome tuu the LUuving HuUt\"  Please God no. When this was Supreme Master I knew I was in for a long wait and this is still the case, a party had to get their own menus they grew too impatient. Don't expect to be out of here in 45 minutes or under an hour for that matter.

Vegetarian meals shouldn't be this hard to find and they are not, this is just another option to consider if you are on this side of town. I have found some items on the menu I can cross off, and some I will always make my regular rotation. Service is friendly but be sure to snatch your desserts before you hit the table, otherwise they will be gone by the time you finish your meal. Cheesecake is very popular and is frequently sold out. Just thought you should know that, before the vultures swarm.

The Heaven Rice Rolls $4.00 are okay if you are a fan of the rice paper wrapping, although I did not like the cold, rubbery, not too flavorful texture. The peanut sauce was a compliment to every dish however, and could go on anything (it is supposed to come with a hoisin sauce). The Moo Shu Vegetables $6.95 came differently than how they are supposed to on the menu, it came wrapped tightly again with a rice paper instead of in a wheat Moo Shu skin. Not acceptable.

The Sweet and Sour Divine $8.50 (rice separately white $1.00, brown $1.25) was delicious, a true vegan \"junk food\" delight. Soy protein, pineapple, carrots, and homemade S&S sauce which I thought they gave me a little too much of but that's okay. It looked like real chicken, tasted like real chicken, and although I have been a vegetarian for 8 years, it was reminiscent of the real thing and recreated that memory for me of eating some S&S Chicken. My mom who is not in anyway shape or form a vegan, was shocked by the taste of the dish (she was a butcher for many years).

The Guru Curry $7.50 is made like a thin Thai curry so don't expect a thick Indian or Chinese curry. It is soupy but it is very good and is served with a crusty loaf of bread. It is composed of: curry, taro, carrots, potatoes, gluten, tofu.

The small trick she offered us about their water is that they cut up a bunch of oranges and put it in the ice water. The Macadamia Carrot Cake $3.95 could have been better if it wasn't so dried out by the refrigerator. It was a delicious cake but they need to throw those out and replace them. With: coconut, carrots, turbinado, sugar, macadamia nuts, spices, coconut cream topping.

Please men in the back who kept farting; I know vegans have a lot of fiber running through the digestive tract at an astronomical rate but farting in a full restaurant is in poor taste. Please excuse yourself and go to the bathroom and fart to your heart's content or take it outside. *Disclaimer-none of the people pictured were the purveyors of the gas.

All items are 100% vegan, all entrees are under $10, all of their delicious organic juices, milks and teas are $3.50-5.00.  It gets busy on weekends and with the already long wait, prepare to wait or come early.
Might be hard to pass up but it is right across from Chuy's, and right in the same parking lot as Desert Jade."}
{"text":"We are so happy to have recently discovered Loving Hut...a real treasure!   The selections -which are many- are full of flavor and so very tasty!  Our server Linda was a true sweet heart and was very hospitable and welcoming.  The light and bright atmosphere of the place added to the wonderful experience we had.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I am glad this location is just a stone throw away from me. The food and service here is great but could improve. Ordered pad thai which comes with Tofu but wasn't included, so I informed them and they doubled my protein on my next order. Some people love their spicy cha cha but it is a little too oily for me. Overall, I'll come back over and over again. I do enjoy their BBQ noodles and heaven rice rolls and oh boy, I can go to town on those!"}
{"text":"Should be renamed The Tofu Hut.  Went here with \"mostly-vegan\" relatives who recommended it highly.  Restaurant itself feels like a converted fast-food joint.  Service was very prompt and friendly (one star for food, one star for ambience, four stars for service) -- server took time to explain a number of items to my wife.  Biggest disappointment was that almost every dish included (or centered around) some sort of soy protein or tofu.  Hello!  There are tons of ways to be delicious vegan dishes that don't include the abomination (to me) that tofu is from a taste and mouthfeel standpoint.  Wife did not like her faux fish entree, the wonton soup was o.k., as was my veggie Mu Shu.  Next time, it's off to Cafe Lalibela, or any good italian or middle eastern place."}
{"text":"My husband and I had lunch here today. The service was very slow, which was unfortunate, because it was not that close to work or home for us. They did offer us a complimentary lentil soup, which was delicious. The water was lemon-and-lime-infused, and the tea was surprisingly strong for the delicate color. 

I ordered the \"Spicy Cha Cha\" (Yam-based protein, red & green bell peppers, green onions, celery, spicy seasoning, lettuce; $7.95). I had no idea what Cha Cha was, or what yam-based protien is, but what I was served looked and tasted exactly like fried shrimp. It was salty and I'm sure it was a few more grams of fat than I'd prefer, but my, it was delicious.

My husband had the Hawaiian Burger (Soy patty, vegan butter, pineapple, teriyaki sauce, mushroom, lettuce, tomato, vegenaise, French fries; $7.95)He said he'd definitely like to come back.

I'll echo what others have said about the stark white decor and the flat-screen monitors with the propaganda, although I didn't really see anything offensive. The annoyance factor just increased because of the long time we had to wait for our entrees."}
{"text":"My roomie and I picked up some food to go a week or so ago. Loving Hut was open on Sundays so we decided to give it a try. Ugh! So gross! How does a place like this make vegan food so unhealthy?! Every item was just drenched in oil and fried... I could have gotten food like this from Panda Express or worse. 
We ordered the sweet and sour \"chicken\", pad thai, and spring rolls based off of Yelp recommendations. They completely forgot our rice (even though they asked us white or brown on the phone) for the sweet and sour \"chicken\" so it was basically fried balls of batter in an overly sweet orange sauce. The pad thai had formed itself into one giant ball of noodles and yet still was drenched in oil. The spring rolls were so greasy they left oil on your lips. We actually both got SICK from the food here. We threw away the rest of the leftovers and vowed to never go back....

If you are looking to try great vegan food, try Green New American Vegetarian. Loving Hut is definitely not a good representation of how tasty vegetarian food can be. Don't waste your money!"}
{"text":"Don't come here if you expect fast service.   The food is good but to get waited on and actually served your food will take time. 

I would give more stars but the service has a lot to be desired.   

We have been sitting here long enough to write this Yelp review, even asking if we are gonna service and I was ignored.  

20 minutes later we waited on when they close for lunch in 36 minutes. Usually the food takes 30 minutes to get to you from the time you order. 

Good food but this place needs to be only for take out if you don't mind waiting an hour to get your order.

There 3 tables seated with at most 3 people at each. A group of 3 left as we walked in."}
{"text":"I'm a pescetarian but enjoy vegetarian dishes. When it comes to vegan, I not only appreciate it but a good vegan dish is hard to find, so I'm always looking around. 

We parked out front and we noticed that the entrance looked like a doctors office you see in plazas. Simple main entry with big windows and white vertical blinds. Inside the place has a sterilize feel to it; white tables and chairs, clean with a set of small dishes and utensils on every table along with a bottle of Bragg Amino (yum!) as well as a Sriracha hot sauce bottle. The walls have script spiritual messages neatly written on them. And the feel you get is good. The service is simple and super fast. I think we received our dishes within 7 minutes!

We both had stir fry dishes with a side of brown rice. Both dishes were the same style but the sauces were different. The protein used was seitan; crunchy on the outside and soft/chewy on the inside. Very well marinated and delicious to say the least. My husband is an omnivore and he left the plate clean. 

For this chain restaurant fairly new to Pittsburgh I only give it four stars. The location is undesirable, the traffic to and from Robinson Twp can be a nightmare. But the food is incredible, wishing and hoping they open more locations in the Pittsburgh area. 

Saturdays they serve buffet all day, so this may be a good time for us to try other flavors."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time today! What can I say?! INCREDIBLE! You just have to try it to find out how great it is!"}
{"text":"So I am struggling between 3 and 4 stars. But I don't want to give it a 4. Why? Because my flavor expectations were met but not exceeded. I got the large dish of fried rice because I didn't want meat imposters. Tofu stop pretending and be yourself! My rice tasted like i would expected any fried rice would expect is was a never ending rush for my tiny taste buds. The only bonus I would add is the sriracha hot sauce. That is the king of all hot sauces and mixed in with my rice added the kick i needed. The vegan desserts were phenomenal and would bump this place to 4 stars BUT they didn't make the desserts I tried. They had bought them from another vegan bakery near by. Despite this, that dessert tasted like a HoHo and I was happy. 

The only negative I would give this place is they attention to you. They are either blind, deaf, or both. Which ever one, you don't exist until you make a loud noise or get real close to them. Maybe this is their way of giving you your privacy, but at least check up on us once every 10 minutes or so! 

Having said all this, I will return here when I feel fat which is probably every day."}
{"text":"I gave it two stars for the propaganda featured on the tv set and the other one for the heaven rice rolls.  I found it very entertaining...you can get  a good wash for your brain and eat at the same time.  Did you know...Jesus is vegan? and Albert Einstein and Leonardo da Vinci???  Come to Loving Hut and you'll find out more and more famous people are vegan...even politicians.

The Supreme Master Ching Hai might be upset with my review....but here goes...

The menu was very nice and colorful.  My coworker ordered the appetizers, Golden Rolls and Heaven Rice Rolls.  The Golden Rolls has this tofu stench to it, maybe it was the oil they used to deep fried it in but I had to cover the taste with a lot of sweet and sour sauce.  The Heaven Rice Rolls however, was very good, I didn't expect to like it, but I really really did.  The peatnut sauce dip complement the rolls very well.

For the main course I had Au Lac noodle which is a fancy name they gave for vegan Pho.  It was soooo soooo bad, I can not imagine how someone can swallow this. The broth was very bland and the \"meat\" has a stench to it.  I brought it home (without the broth) and let my sister- who is a seasonal vegan, tried it and she did not like it one bit. 

If yelp let me give it a half star I would for the logo.   I must say, the logo of the restaurant......is cute."}
{"text":"Great food, love the taste but expensive. The quantity is small for the price. For me o have to other 2 items from their menu befit i am satisfied."}
{"text":"I wanna preface this review by saying that my friend and I both work at a vegan restaurant and are super patient people/customers when it comes to food service. 

We ordered the Summer Rolls, which were insanely overpriced upon trying them and realizing how bland they were. They came with an \"organic sauce\" that tasted just like very watered down apple cider vinegar and didn't help the case at all. Also, the picture of the item on the menu contained a completely different sauce. 

While waiting for our entrees (I ordered the Sweet and Sour Spicy Strip, my friend ordered the Veggie Garden Stir Fry), our server came over and told me that there had been a miscommunication with the chef, and an entirely different dish had been prepared for me, the Salty Spicy Tango. She at first offered me a refund or I could try the new dish, to which I said that I didn't care about a refund, but I wanted the dish that I had actually ordered. At this, she started to argue with me, and after a back and forth where I was politely asking for the dish I ordered, she basically insisted that I have the dish that they had prepared, saying that it would be a \"hassle\" for them to change it. 

With no choice but to eat the other dish, our meals came over with incredibly skimpy portions, especially for the $10.75 that they each cost. On top of this, the server had offered us sides of rice, which she lead us to believe were included, but actually each cost $2.25. $2.25 for a single scoop of rice!!!

When we got our bills and saw that we each owed about $20 for about $8 worth of food, we asked the manager for a refund for my wrong dish, and she also then continued to argue until she had no point left to argue. 

Bottom line is, absolutely the worst restaurant experience I have ever had with quality of the food and service both included. Never go here."}
{"text":"First time trying vegan, omg the best. I'm hooked the good was amazing and plentiful! I will be back"}
{"text":"I love this place! Not sure why there would be any negative reviews on here. I am a vegan and have tried many vegan restaurants and I have to say that Loving Hut ranks with some of the best!! Great quality, variety of great dishes, and delicious definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"First off, I love Loving Hut! I usually go to the location at Union Hills but was closer to this location so decided to stop by. I was surprised to find that the food was completely different. I always order the chow mein and there wasn't anything similar to the other location except that there were noodles. It was still pretty good but you'd assume the same company would have similar ingredients. Bummer but I still like you guys."}
{"text":"Living in Biltmore/Arcadia, it's nice to have some local spots to enjoy vegan munchies. Loving Hut has nice staff and the menu is great. It's definitely an orient-vegan style restaurant, so if you're not a fan of Asian food, then there's less options. The prices aren't bad, though, and they have some vegan desserts, too."}
{"text":"Overall clean simple food to the point of being unsurprising. I'm not big on the use of processed vegetarian \"meat\" unless they are made in house; which I believe theirs are not. Also I'm not a fan of tofu as a protein source unless it's GMO free and organic. This place tries but the lighting and cultish videos of the \"Supreme\" leader take away from what might be a better dining experience. I've been a vegetarian for 2.5 decades and do t mind the food but feel like I can do better with my own cooking at times. They could try using stronger and better spicing of the food and I don't mean adding more chilies but even that could help."}
{"text":"It's cool that this place is vegan- I appreciate what they do- I am sure they have critics but - making meat imitation tasty is definitely a challenge- loving hut did great! I couldn't tell you what I ordered but I tell you this- I wanted more! It was like lemon peppered imitation chicken. 

This food is more than likely real good for you! It's low calorie and delicious which I love!  

The inside is tidy clean, nice place for a date and some coffee- I love Vietnamese coffee! 

Hear they have a buffet on Saturday! 

Good experience."}
{"text":"Teetering between 3-4 stars.  Been wanting to try this place out and finally got a chance this weekend with the bf.  I opted for the buffet since I wasn't sure what I'd like and was in the mood to sample a few items.  Most of the dishes were purely veggies or had tofu incorporated in to them.  I enjoyed the fried tofu (how can anything be bad fried?!?!) and there was a garlic tofu dish which was tasty.  They had garlic kale which was surprisingly delish...kale can be iffy.  I also liked the Asian vegetables and helped myself to 2 servings.  I wasn't too fond of this fried chickpea concotion or the \"supreme\" rice which ended up being curried rice.  There was a carrot/cinnamon cake which was good but the green cake was dry and not good at all.  

Bf got a bbq dish with a ton of noodles - he said it was decent.  He was a good sport since he is mainly carnivorous and I'm more of the herbavore so I appreciated that he took me here!

I felt the decor was a bit odd - all white seating, seemed very modern.  I guess I was expecting more of a hippie, carefree vibe but it seemed a bit sterile in terms of decor.  There was also some Romanesque looking columns near the entryway...maybe the place was a Mediterranea joint before.  

Also there was some bizzarre incidences with the staff.  We were told to sit wherever we wanted but didn't get waited on until quite some time later.  Water was provided and we saw the buffet but would have appreciated some wait service to see what exactly we wanted to order.  Especially since the bf wanted to order off the menu.  

Maybe they assume everyone wants the buffet, but that type of thinking is what annoys me about places that offer buffets.  Also another wait staff (who at first didn't seem as if he worked there) came over to our tables and was asking to take our straws...since we didn't know he worked there we thought it was some random stranger trying to swipe our straws!  He never explained what the heck he was doing and we finally figured out he was an employee a few minutes later.  Then we were given 2 smoothie drinks we never ordered, but the waiter who dropped them off didn't even make eye contact with us to see if they were indeed our drinks...I walked up to the front desk area to let them know.  

When we got the bill, I saw that the bufffet was $14.99!  Talk about sticker shock...seemed a bit steep...espeically for a VEGAN buffet.  While I thought it was good, I wouldn't go with the buffet again at that price - all the dishes in the menu seemed to be about $10 under which made me think the buffet was comprable.  Definitely didn't feel like I got our $ worth from the buffet."}
{"text":"Definitely try the Western burger!! Much better burger than even the Big Wac at Green...I know that's practically vegan sacrilege, but it's true! The Western is a bbq'd gardein patty topped with pineapple, fried onion rings, lettuce and mayo. Yum!

Our other favorite dish here is the Rainbow Salad. Like a vinegar slaw, but sweet and with peanuts and a veg meaty protein that tastes similar to ham imo. Delicious!

The fried shrimp, actually fried yam protein, is so amazing too...perfect texture and taste.

The milkshakes are very rich and either soy milk based or coconut milk based depending on the flavor. They have cakes and pies for dessert too but my favorite is a slice of the raw vegan cheesecake!"}
{"text":"Hands down best vegan food I have ever had. The noodles and curry rice were amazing. The mango shake was very good as well."}
{"text":"I love this place - amazing service and  high quality food for the price. The staff genuinely try to get to know you."}
{"text":"So yummy! Most of the stuff is asian influence, but they do have veggie burgers, salads and soups too. I always bring non vegans there and they always love the food! Everything I've ever ordered has been so tasty!"}
{"text":"Loving Hut is great for vegans, vegetarians and veg curious people. The food is fresh and flavorful. Some days I go just for the won ton soup and golden spring rolls. (Warning - the hot mustard is hot!) It's the perfect comfort food. The Pad Thai is the best I've had in town - the peanut sauce is spicy and not greasy. Beyond the wide variety of Asian food, their burgers and Ban Mi Philly are great too. Don't forget to get their tasty fries."}
{"text":"I don't have much to add, but this is a great restaurant.  Like other reviewers, the only reason that I am giving it 4 instead of 5 stars is because the atmosphere is a bit lacking. The food is very good. 

The one thing that I might be able to add is that the cheesecake dessert is  very tasty. I recommend it.  Oh, and one more thing, you can phone in your order and they do a good job with takeout service if you are ever in the mood for takeout."}
{"text":"Really good,  too much sugar for me,  but I would return and would recommend.  
Wish there were more places like this."}
{"text":"The adage that a bad experience is more likely to spread than a good one holds ever true.  Having had good experiences with other Loving Hut locations before, my wife and I decided to try this one and meet a friend for dinner on a Friday night.  There were about 8 other parties seated.  The first thing to notice was that it seemed like there was only one server on staff.  Not sure if this was a unique situation, but reading the other review of poor service it seems this is commonplace.  She took our orders, and brought out the Thai Iced Tea I ordered pretty quickly.

Then we proceeded to wait about 50 minutes for her to come out with my wife's entree, and to tell me that the kitchen staff couldn't make my order because of a lack of ingredients.  50 minutes...and all we have to show is 1 out of 3 entrees and they clearly hadn't even started on ours if she was telling me they couldn't make it.  I ordered something else...then she comes out 10 minutes later telling me they could make it after all.

I ordered something called the Royal Noodle Soup, and not only was it lacking in flavor, but it seemed like someone just chopped up pieces of lemongrass and left it in the soup and called it a day.  My wife and her friend's entree were nothing to write home about either.

Needless to say we won't be back."}
{"text":"This is one of our old favorite standards, and I'm constantly amazed at how many meat-eaters enjoy it too!  

We usually try to go for lunch because we love the lentil soup they serve that only comes with the lunch combo.  We usually order something of the same...springrolls and either lemon grass chicken (excellent!), sweet and sour pork, or New York chicken.  Today we were adventurous and tried one of their new menu items, the garlic chicken....wow...it was awesome!  I think it just replaced the lemon grass chicken on my favorites list!  We also checked out their chow mein so we could have some veggies and it was very good as well....a great combo.

They have recently changed the names of their menu items, which I think might be confusing to people because some of the names don't have anything to do with what the actual dish is!  But don't be afraid to ask, the staff is very friendly and they won't be afraid to recommend a dish to you.

The only thing I hate about veggie house is that they are closed on Sunday and Monday!!! =("}
{"text":"I actually found their sister restaurant in Arizona. Though the menu is different here in Elk Grove, the quality is top notch and the staff are very friendly. If you're looking to vegan faire in Elk Grove, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"I ate here this past Saturday night with my girlfriend for a later dinner.  We had tried coming here previously about a half a year ago only to find that it was closed for that random Sunday.  Whenever we walked into the restaurant it was fairly full with all of the booths except for one being filled while some of the tables were also empty.  It has an interesting look as both the booths and the tables and chairs are white while the ceiling and floors are also neutral colors.  It is almost like you are in a laptop clean room but then in the center of the whole dining room on the ceiling surrounded by some blue light is what seems to be a mural/sculpture in the shape of the a cursive L with a heart and the words \"BE VEG, GO GREEN, Loving Hut\".

My girlfriend and I decided to look at the menus even though they had a buffet there that night.  We had a tough time deciding whether to order from the buffet or from the menu but ultimately opted for the buffet since it had many of the items from the menu on it including the dish I was thinking about ordering, a lemongrass soy chicken dish.  The only thing that really concerned me about the buffet was the lack of normal vegetables on it as it only really seemed to have a single natural vegetable dish which was comprised of kale, broccoli and carrots.  Everything else seemed to mainly comprised of soy protein: chicken, shrimp, beef and tofu.  That's not to say that the items were not good as I enjoyed just about everything that I had with the exception being the soy sauce tofu.  My favorite had to the fabulous Mongolian which resembled a beef with bell peppers and tasted exactly like some meatless beef jerky that I buy in Whole Foods while my second favorite was spicy cha cha which had some soy shrimp with some spices on it.  Since we arrived pretty late a lot of the buffet was half empty but our server came around and informed us that they would make a table sized portion of whatever we wanted.  Our server even followed up on that by asking us later if there was anything that the buffet had run out of that they cook for us.

The bottom line for me is that I would definitely head back here again in the future.  Although I was a bit leery about the buffet at the start, I ended up really enjoying it and thought it was fair for the $14.99 price.  I loved that they put many of their actual dishes on it and I now know what I will order the next time that I go in if the buffet is not available."}
{"text":"The food here is freaking amazing. I'm not a vegetarian myself, but this restaurant truly opened my eyes. I was under the misguided impression that vegetarian food lacked lustre (sorry) but this restaurant proved me wrong. An absolute gem in the city."}
{"text":"Mmmmm. Boyfriend took me here after work. I got the pad Thai. So yummy. Highly recommend. Staff is sweet, restaurant clean, and great service."}
{"text":"plain and simple, this is some tasty vegan Chinese food! the location is a little out of place, but the staff are super friendly and food is good. just make sure to check their hours before heading over. CLOSED ON MONDAYS"}
{"text":"So, I'm not a vegan or even a vegetarian, but my boyfriend and I were fasting for 12 days. We were without meat or dairy, and although I felt prepared at first, I was not as prepared as I thought. By day 5, we were both craving a wholesome, filling meal. What a better place to go than to a vegan buffet!

One of my friends had told me that Loving Hut was pretty delicious, so I had high expectations coming into the restaurant. The appearance is nice and modern, although it doesn't look much like a restaurant from the exterior. We walked in and were seated by a busy woman tending to some chores around the restaurant, but we helped ourselves to the buffet. I had never been here so I really didn't know whether to wait for a menu, or to just go for the buffet. I'm still not sure, to be honest! 

We went to the buffet and filled our plates with chili tofu, pineapple seitan, lemongrass \"chicken,\" and all kinds of plant-based love.   The lemongrass \"chicken\" was by far my favorite. The texture of plant-based protiens can be kind of strange at times for me but this one tasted great and almost had the texture of real chicken. We took a piece of vegan cookies and cream cake to go and our total was a little less than $40, which I don't think is too bad for as full as we were!"}
{"text":"Solid 3.5 Stars. 

The loving hut is a bit odd. 

I fully agree with everyone who mentioned how off the decor is. We felt like we were in the Sappranos or something with all the 80's white chairs. Also when we first walked in we were slapped in the face by a very off putting smell. 

The service was pretty decent. She came to our table often. The citrus infused water and the hot tea were terrific! 

We ordered some spring rolls and wontons to start. They were both ok. 

I ordered the Hawaiian burger and it was beyond messy, also they put the worlds smallest piece of pineapple on it and it didn't taste fresh at all. 

Hubs order the Philly steak sandwich and our friend got the spicy cha cha, both said they liked it. 

We will probably go back again and try some different dishes. I wasn't a total fan of what I ordered."}
{"text":"What is this place doing all the way out in Robinson Town Center? We stumbled upon this place after an airport pickup and were super excited to find a vegan restaurant tucked away from all the fast food places.

We were there for lunch on a Friday and were 1 of 3 tables.  We started off with the jumbo drumsticks which were just okay, as there was lots of breading.  I had the coco tofu, which was amazing.  The portion was huge with tons of tofu, which made me super happy.  The fiancee got the pad thai special, which was also packed with tofu.  Yum.

They have tons of cakes and pies at the counter, and I got a piece of vegan cheesecake to go.  The cheesecake crust was nothing special, but somehow they managed to get the texture right, and it tasted great.  I wish they were located closer to the city...I know we'd go there all the time!"}
{"text":"I really like the server with long brown hair in a ponytail. She is nonchalant and very nice. Perfect serving style. Both times I've eaten here were well priced, nutritious and yummy!"}
{"text":"Loving Hut is great! I heard about these family vegan restaurants forever ago and finally made it out to one of their locations, all thanks to Tigra. 

I checked out the menu online in advance so I could see what dishes they have and what I'd want to order. I appreciate that they accompany their list of items with pictures, it helped a lot. I zoned in on the BBQ noodles plate that comes with golden spring rolls cut on top and it was a great choice. The only thing I didn't like was the pickled topping of carrots and daikon but everything else was tasty. The fake beef (veg protein) was seasoned well and the rolls were crunchy and flavorful. Everyone else at the table enjoyed their picks and I got to try the spicy cha cha and the guru rice (DEFINITELY getting this next time!). 

1 star off because our food took a long time, although mine somehow came out before everyone else's but after the appetizers. I'd come back for sure! They've got three other locations, one of which is in Tempe."}
{"text":"The food is so good. The water they serve is refreshing. The service is quick and nice. I love this place... but please turn on the AC and ceiling fans!"}
{"text":"We have been preferred vegan for years now. Always when going to eat out it at restaurants, it is a choice between 1-2 \"vegetarian\" options which still need to be tweaked to get the health part right. 

How surprised we were walking into Loving Hut tonight! The restaurant was clean, attractive, and painted white to reflect the light. Menus were full of pictures and colors, descriptive of every item. It took us nearly 5-10 minutes of looking over each item before doing our best to select just 2-3 items. If possible, we would have ordered everything. And all this knowing that nothing is cooked with diary, meat or eggs! No changes to any dishes, just pick and relax-or rather anticipate how good it will taste. 

Ended up getting the Tamari tea-good but mild and the chai tea-delicious! Best ever had out in town. 

curry soup-somehow this was served at the perfect temperature. It was delicious. 

and the curry rice-very good. 

Service was excellent, very homely, nice and polite. 

Bathrooms were extremely tidy. 

Food did take several extra minutes compared to average restaurant, but that is due to everything being made from scratch. If you want fast food, go to McDonald's. If you want quality, go to this place!"}
{"text":"Really, really awesome service - very accommodating and helpful, let us linger after dinner as long as we liked and went to great lengths to help me find a missing hat :)
Food was good, big portions - my only complaint being that it's not spicy enough for someone who is used to legitimately spicy food.  Otherwise a very pleasant experience - clean restaurant, good music, lovely staff."}
{"text":"This place was hands down awful when I went. I ended up going a little on a whim & wish I hadn't. Atmosphere was kinda run down & the food was just horridness. Service was totally fine, only good thing about the place. The food was just gross, it was slimy & bad tasting. I love asian food, I've never once had an issue with the texture of it but for what ever reason here it got to me. The actual taste if the food wasn't good either. I was starving when I started eating, anything I thought would taste amazing but sadly not. Long story short don't eat here."}
{"text":"We went for the first time in several years and they have renovated since they changed the name - it's clean and bright and wasn't as awkward as it was in the past.  The service was more professional, quick, and friendly and the dishes were well presented.  They weren't that busy for late on a Saturday night so there was no wait.  We got a kick out of the celebrity celebration ceremony on a wall-mounted flat screen honoring the Supreme Master who called into the show versus showing up in person or via video.  The volume was very low and we were a table away so it was hard to hear, but still slightly entertaining.

It's 100% vegan.  I can order anything off the menu without fearing that they will accidentally fling bits of meat into my dish.  Our only complaint about the food is that it is greasy and most of the dishes are based on meat substitutes rather than creative, non-processed, plant-based options.  I read in a forum online that the Supreme Master owns the company that makes the meat substitute products they use (sorry, I don't have more info on that).  We ordered the Summer Roll, which was good, but the tofu is fried.  The Spicy Cha Cha has chunks of breaded and fried meat substitute that tasted so much like imitation crab meat we couldn't believe it was vegan - our server saw us inspecting it and came over and told us the vegan ingredients (must happen often).  The tofu in the Chow Mein was fried too.  Also, the Chow Mein didn't have bean sprouts - they are the reason I crave it.  Next time we go we will try to order healthier options, or non-fried options.  If you are the type of vegetarian/vegan that misses meat-based dishes or you are trying to transition for ethical reasons, this place is perfect.  There are a lot of choices on the menu and they even have vegan desserts."}
{"text":"Other reviewers are pretty much spot on.  When we first entered, there was a pretty bad smell to the place.  It almost smelled like a sewer... they should look into that.  However, by the end of the meal, we couldn't really even smell it anymore.

The decor is also strange.  I really didn't like the TV's with the vegan propaganda running.... having been a vegan myself, and also a vegetarian for some years, I've seen it all - but definitely not while I'm eating.  It doesn't matter if it's vegan food, who wants to watch that while they eat???

But!- the saving grace might actually be the food.  It is pretty delicious.  The service was not too bad either.  The server was a pleasant lady who gave me recommendations on the menu.  My boyfriend ordered two of their specialty drinks and they were really yummy.  

Overall, the food is good but the atmosphere is lacking.  Service is ok too.  Would I go back?  Probably.

However, I've been to much nicer and better vegan/vegetarian restaurants (in Las Vegas, where I'm from)."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible and slow service. They are not even busy and they take forever to do everything and extremely forgetful. I wanted to walk out but stayed because I was so hungry and haven't eaten all day.

I ordered a dish and drink, dish came out unappetizing and wrong while the drink never got made. The server dropped off my food and never gave me utensils. No one was around and I had to wait for 10 minutes until she came around and asked me about the food and I told her she never gave me anything to eat with.

The protein was too salty and I still was very unhappy and the server took my water away. It took forever to get their attention to get me another water. They even took forever to bring me back change and this is when the restaurant is empty. Bill was $10.29 and I paid 20.35. They even have issues with simple math asking me what I gave them. They gave me back dollar bills as if I should tip them. I fucking hate this place and the incompetent people who run it.

I should have walked away without paying. The airheads ruined my one Sunday off I got in over month. I work in a restaurant and I know when service is completely shitty. This place has no redeeming qualities whatsoever."}
{"text":"A few things have stopped me from going vegan in my life and dining out options is one of them. Another is parting with food items I'd miss dearly. I don't eat meat and I hadn't really found any vegetarian restaurant that did fake meat well, until I went to The Loving Hut.

It seems like every time we go there our eyes widen and we're asking, \"how the hell did they do that?\"

Last night, they made yams taste like shrimp--not just taste like it, but have the same texture. WTF!?

Though this restaurant isn't quite as good as Green, (I'm biased toward American-style food anyway), its food is unique, tasty, and inexpensive.

If you're not a vegan, you may feel bombarded with propaganda upon entrance; fair warning."}
{"text":"I'm in turmoil on who I should rate this place. The decor and atmosphere is two stars. It smelled disgusting when we walked in, like sulfur or rotten eggs. Then the decor is like 1980's, with the white chairs. Oy - then there's the service. I'm gluten-free, and I had some trouble getting that across. She said that all of the soy protein has wheat in it, so she recommended the tofu dishes. I ended up getting the tofu dish with rice noodles and vegetables. I have no idea if there was wheat in the sauce, but at that point in the meal, I really didn't care. I just wanted to order and get the experience over with. 

The food came out pretty quickly though. My friend got the spicy cha cha (that looks like shrimp but is actually yam) and it was SUPER spicy and I think it tasted like Long John Silver's fried shrimp basket. BUT she really liked it. My dish was pretty okay, although a little bland. The veggies weren't really great either, but for a vegan dish that's less than $10, I guess it was okay.

I had planned on getting dessert, but we were given the check even before she asked if we wanted dessert. After I made some statement about it she asked if we wanted any, and told us they only had two out of the four desserts on the menu anyways. We went without it.

And yes, they do have the TV running strange vegan propaganda. Very strange, and I don't really want to look at baby pigs while I dine, but it could have been weirder. I guess. 

SO - for the price, I guess it is decent vegan cuisine. I guess I wouldn't really know seeing as how I LOVE MEAT, but hey, I'm up for trying everything once. I think if the atmosphere and service was better I would have actually liked the dining experience and the food more. If it was better inside, I'd be tempted to go to this place again. Eventually, I'd like to try the dessert. If they offer it to me."}
{"text":"I think the little vegan place with the weird tv propaganda should at least get two stars for setting up shop across from McDonalds.

Then allot one more star for the drinks, especially the rose lemonade. It has rose petals sprinkled on top!

But i can't justify even a half star for the  food. I guess it qualifies as being vegan, but I'm not sure if it qualifies as food."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of the Loving Hut. Not only are they serving up tasty dishes, but they actually seem to care about animals, the environment and people too. Serving only Organic, Vegan, Non-GMO, Peanut & Nut Free with a number of Gluten Free options as well, you can see they've put some thought into this.

I've enjoyed many a meals at their Eglington West location and was overjoyed to see them opening up this new place near my work. One neat thing about this location is that it's 100% Organic. I like eating Organic and it shows how they're actively trying to do something for the environment. Unfortunately this made the prices go up a few dollars for each of my favourite meals, which I am not impressed by, hence the missing fifth star. 

I highly recommend trying the Chow-Mein. It's a large helping of fried noodles, veggies, tofu and soy protein thingamajigs. Definitely my favourite dish, and sometimes it's even enough for 2 meals. You can ask for it sans \"fried\" noodles as well, and just have the noodles soft, if you're not a fan of the crispier noodles. The Sweet and Sour fireballs are really good as well and I'm also a big fan of the Savoury Crisp.

The lunch special is great. It's $8.95, and comes with a decent sized meal plus a soup. There are 3 meal choices available, the Chow-Mein (which if I haven't mentioned yet, is my favourite), a Thai curry (also quite good), and Eggplant with Black bean Sauce (I haven't tried this yet, but give me a break! They've only be open for a couple weeks! Ok, you're right, I'm sorry. I'll go tomorrow). The soup is usually a simple vegetable soup but it's super tasty.

Ok, yes the place is run by some sort of Vegan cult (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ching_Hai, note the big screen tv in the restaurant playing the \"supreme master channel\"), but honestly, if religious establishments concentrated more on opening tasty restaurants then on bigotry, I think I could get behind them. Don't let that discourage you though, you probably won't even notice it and the food is definitely worth it."}
{"text":"This place wasn't quite what I expected.... I was delighted to be going to a vegan restaurant. Vegans unite! But I didn't really dig the cult undertone going on here. Something was very uncomfortable... 

The food was pretty good! My fiance, who is by no means anything resembling a vegan, liked his meal too! The service was a little uncomfortable and at the end we waited for a long time for our waiter to come pick up our check only to discover we had to pay at the register. It didn't seem like that kind of place and no one told us. Whatever. 

Truthfully, I'll probably be back sometime. And I would definitely be a lot more inclined to go back if the vibe wasn't so...weird."}
{"text":"I've been hearing about this place for the longest time and was keeping the date free. They didn't offer a lot of selection and the tofu dishes all tasted the same...(I'm also a complete sweet tooth so I'm bias to say that they didn't have a great selection of food...) This would have been more justified if the buffet was a decent price, instead it was a bit pricey. 

It was also lacking in flavor (maybe because it wasn't steeped in lard) so on the bright side the food is a lot better for you than say, Golden Palace. 

However, the saving grace of the meal was the smoothie! The smoothie itself was pretty impressive and I don't usually like juice/smoothies/milkshake (not a liquid kind of gal)"}
{"text":"I never made it to The Vegetarian House and decided to try this location again once Loving Hut took over the space. 

We went on a Friday night, the space was clean and white if not a bit to stark (adjusting the lighting would work). The food was similar to the other dishes I have had at other Loving Hut locations so at least it was consistent.

The only problem I saw was the service. Everyone seemed to be trying hard and remained friendly while at the same time appearing very scatter brained. We noticed people flagging down waitresses as soon as we sat down so we knew something was aloof. It just seemed to be that they didn't have everything together, like it was opening week or something. Things took awhile and you could see the frantic pace to which everyone was trying to get things done, yet the restaurant was a 1/4 full.

Maybe they will iron out some of they service issues, the food is still good although the menu is a bit tired - or I may just be tired of it. I should be thrilled with another vegan restaurant in the valley, but the more I sample vegan cuisine outside of Phoenix the more I crave more of that here."}
{"text":"delicious !! blissful fried rice is amazing!! and the pandan cake is life!! vegan or not you need to go here!!!"}
{"text":"Good Vegan Asian food!

We just stumbled on this place and we were really hungry.  We tried multiple appetizers and shared a main dish - all where really good.   

They had something that was like a drumstick made of mushrooms, onions and a bunch of other things.   The taste was really good, the breading was a little heavy but an interesting flavor.    The main dish was tried was a barbecue rice vermicelli bowl - they don't call it that specifically, but it was really good. 

When we are in the area again, we will be back to this place."}
{"text":"The food here is kind of hit or miss. Some of the dishes are better than others; you kind of just have to try things to figure out if you like them or not. I have generally found it to be tasty though.

Not related to the food itself but I looked up this restaurant online and it's owned/run by this weird organization called Supreme Master Television, or something. The leader of it is this Asian woman named Supreme Master Ching Hai. I'm not even making this up: http://www.suprememastertv.com/loving-hut... it's all really weird and confusing.

At the restaurant there is even a painting on the wall that was made by Ching Hai (her signature is on it). You will also find a some paraphernalia about this organization. The waitress that served me today was eerily friendly and calm, but maybe I'm just creeped out by her because I can't stop thinking about that Supreme Master stuff."}
{"text":"While visiting in Phoenix, we stumbled upon this place and the lady who must have been the owner was great and even e-mailed up websites to check out being vegan.  This was while the food was being made. We even got some free digs out of the situation. I would recommend if you are in the Phoenix area and if you are a vegetarian or not to try it out.The food wasn't too bad and I went back for the BBQ beef.

The food was quite yummy I should say!"}
{"text":"I went to the Loving Hut for the first time and really enjoyed the whole experience! The dining area was clean and well lit. The service was prompt and polite. They even ran my girlfriend's purse out to us in the parking lot after she forgot it at the table (I told her she was going to forget it..).  They had a variety of Asian dishes and a few interesting American-inspired entrees for those looking for something different.  

I ordered the Heaven Rice Rolls as an appetizer and the BBQ Noodles entrée.  Both dishes infused fresh, uncooked veggies into the meal in a way that didn't compromise taste, but didn't leave you feeling regretful afterwards as some oily or fatty meals can.  And the entrée, as well as everything on the menu, was under $10! Great quality, healthy vegan food, served by a polite staff, for a reasonable price; that is what you can expect."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum! !!! It would be pretty easy to drive past this place as it's not your typical \"trendy\" neighborhood spot but WOW the food is great! I just finished my first dinner there and I already can't wait to go back. Moo shoo vegetables. Order them."}
{"text":"Great option for vegetarians although meat eaters might not like the mock meats available....Many mock meat options; I had garlic \"chicken\" and the GF got spicy chachas, a yam based mock meat dish that looked like breaded shrimp.  It was very good!  Also got wonton soup which was just like the real thing...I recommend this place if you want a more Asian alternative to green!  Just ignore the strange videos of the guru playing...."}
{"text":"I had been to the buffet a few times. Delicious food. I also enjoy \"The New York Charm\". It's so good. However I was there on Saturday Dec  15th and ordered the jumbo drumsticks as appetizer(was ok) and was so anxious to get to my favorite dish \"The New York Charm\". It came out quickly and was tasty as usual. However I did not have a drink and could not finish the food without a drink.

They were not busy, I was by myself and there was one couple sitting at a table. After 20 minutes without a drink my food was cold and I noticed my server sitting behind the counter?

So I walk up to check out and she says \"How was everything\"?
I said, I did not have a drink the whole dinner and couldn't finish.

She said, oh, sorry that'll be $21.99 
I paid and left. Was very unpleasant. Ruined my meal!
I keep saying I won't be back but the food is very good here and I'll most likely return when I can try and forget about this. 

Oh yeah, I drove 60 miles to eat here and go to a store in Robinson."}
{"text":"I've eaten here three times since last year's first visit, and everytime I do, I promise I won't wait longer next time.  Yet, it's been months since my last meal here.  I wonder why?  Maybe it's bec. Phoenix has so many good finds!  A coworker of mine constantly speaks of the lack of good eats in the valley.  I tell him \"Nonsense.  You just have to be willing to look!\"  

The 7th Heaven (?) salad is delicious, and I love the lemon grass chicken.  Mom wouldn't believe that the \"lobster\" leftover she raided was vegan.  

Wished management would improve the atmosphere, though."}
{"text":"How refreshing to have a Loving Hut in Pittsburgh! It's in a desolate plaza, so you have to hunt it out to know about it. I was super pumped to come here, and if you have directions, it's an easy drive. The restaurant has a very clean, bright feeling to it and there are vegan quotes decorating the walls. When I opened the menu I could NOT make a decision because everything sounded so good. Most restaurants offer only 2-3 veg options on the menu, so I am not used to this decision making! The service was good and fast. We started out with the special rolls (kinda like summer rolls) with a very good dipping sauce. Very generous appetizer portion. I finally decided on the Ginger Tofu, which also came out in a huge portion, over mixed greens and a big serving of brown rice. The tofu was good but it actually tasted like french toast. It must have been the sweet ginger sauce. Weird, but I didn't hate it. I had regrets that I didn't try the special quinoa salad, but there is always next time! Oh, and the prices are very good - one app, 2 dinners and iced green teas came to under $30."}
{"text":"I love loving hut, i'm so glad i don't have to deal with meat or dairy being in my food i'm able to just eat everything on my plate with ease, the price is worth the food."}
{"text":"I give the Loving Hut 5 stars mostly because of their Sweet and Sour Divine entree. It's like a mock sweet and sour chicken meal. I've visited the hut twice and although planned on trying something different on my second visit, ordered the Sweet and Sour once again. My matey enjoyed the Royal Noodle soup which was spicy, lemongrassy, and topped with plenty of cilantro. The service is friendly and the atmosphere is relaxing with a wall of windows spreading soft light throughout the interior. I noticed that a few people have complained about the religious video (possibly Buddhism? Didn't pay much attention) playing on the widescreen. I say who cares, no one is forcing you to convert to anything. From my experience throughout my lifetime almost everyone preaches something that they believe in one way or another. For me this was about the food, nothing else. Unless they are poisoning the food with some mind controlling substance, who cares!"}
{"text":"Recommendation: know what you like and order off of the menu.

The buffet, while offering several different options, turned out to be 90% inedible variations of tofu stir fry. Two of the vegan options on the buffet were delicious, the other dozen or so were really, really bad."}
{"text":"As a 10 year vegetarian, I have never, ever, ever found a restaurant with such vast vegetarian/vegan selection. I was so excited to be able to order a garden salad with 'chicken' on top! The savory strips are to die for. My boyfriend (a strict carnivore) ordered the burger and he LOVED it (!!!). This is my new favourite restaurant of all time. I loved it so much that as I was eating there, I said 'i'm going to give this place SUCH an amazing yelp review!\" (I rarely/never review). 

Try this place! You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"5 stars for infusing my food with positive energy.  I ate here years ago when it was the Veggie House. I need to go back and try this place again."}
{"text":"This is such an interesting restaurant. Vegan Vietnamese food. They prepared very fresh and tasty beautiful food . Very close to my home. I really enjoyed my experience at the loving hut and will continue to eat there."}
{"text":"It was nice to have a vegetarian restaurant relatively close to where I was staying!

I started off with the Assorted Platter appetizer, which came with three different kinds of mock meats served on a bed of shredded cabbage - I think it was ham (or duck?), chicken and deep fried eel. All were good and it actually creeped me out for a second thinking that it was real meat (well, at least the texture did).

For an entree, I had the New York Veggie Chicken - it was poured onto a hot plate at my table before being served, which produced a sizzle sizzle effect. It was okay - the mock chicken was good, but the dish itself was average.

I ordered the tofu cheesecake for dessert - very tasty!

I'd go back again for sure, there were so many delicious looking options on their menu..."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying the food is delicious and their hearts are in the right place. 

But there was so much wrong with our visit, I can't justifiably rate them higher than a 2, as much as it pains me to give a vegan restaurant a low rating. 

Firstly, we waited 5 minutes before anyone acknowledged us at the front door. After we were seated, we waited 30 minutes before our order was taken.
20 minutes later we were told they were out of rice for our dinners. No rice. Let that sink in for a moment. 

After selecting our rice substitutions, my dish came out ahead of all the others; looking great, but my husband and children were still without food, so I waited to eat, assuming theirs would be along quickly. 
My husband's dish came out TEN minutes later. 
My children still were waiting and my dish was rapidly cooling. 
The children's dishes came out five minutes later. 15 minutes after mine. 
Our wonton soup appetizer never arrived at all.  

Once we were all able to eat, unfortunately nothing was particularly hot,  though the flavors were all delicious. 

They comped our hot tea, but it arrived midway through the meal.  

I had to ask for soy sauce and chopsticks as they weren't on the table. 

The manager, while pleasant and friendly, let us know the reason for the delay was that the dishes all cook at different rates and they don't have heat lamps. 

That may be a truthful excuse, however, if that's the choice they are going to make as a restaurant, they need to manage the kitchen better and start cooking the more complicated/lengthily dishes first so everything comes out at once. Serving one dish to a table of 4 while everyone else sits and waits for 15 minutes isn't acceptable. As for the rice, I can't think of a reason for being out of rice. It's a staple in the kitchen. And with 45 minutes prep time (plus another 30 before taking orders), a batch of rice easily could have been prepared. 

Finally, there was a couple seated with a dog in a dog bed under the table (not a service dog), which is disgusting, and a doorbell that sounded throughout the dining room every time someone arrived or left; it was a jarring and unpleasant addition to the atmosphere. 

I'm sure as a take out restaurant, they'd do well, but as a sit down restaurant, they made far too many mistakes to have a 4-star rating on Yelp."}
{"text":"Tonight I tested out the new Loving Hut. I grabbed some To Go, and honestly it wasn't as good as it had been previous times. : (
While I didn't see any of the slaughter videos mentioned in more recent review than my last one, I did notice the extra tv running the normal Supreme Master info. 
The new layout is nice, but I liked the food from before, my sweet and sour faux pork is now labeled \"sweet and sour divine\" and has bell peppers that it never had before. Three strip soup has been taken off the menu completely (they did make it for me though :) I'm hoping it'll be better if I dine in next time, but for now I'm fairly disappointed with the new Loving Hut and left missing the Vege house."}
{"text":"As a vegetarian any place that caters to me is worth a look! And a repeated one at that. I find this place pricey but tasty. Its a great lunch option and I've had most of the dishes on the menu. I can only comment on the RIchmond St location so can't comment on their sushi which is only offered at the Eglinton location.

My favourites are the Mexican wrap (easy on the onions!), the savoury crisp (mostly for the coated fries that come with and that sauce for the meat substitute (I know...mmmm, meat substitute but it actually is really tasty!), the bbq and spring rolls noodle, and when I have someone to share it with, the sweet and sour fireballs with say a shish-kabob reminds me of the good old chinese food red sauce that I've missed since going veggie. 

Disappointing dishes are the veggie burger, pad thai and club sandwich - how strange that a vegan place has a lacklustre veggie burger and pad thai. I do enjoy the soups, the wanton and the thai spicy soup with spring rolls (although the sauce is bland), it makes a nice lunch. 

The decor is strange - very white and clinical with all sorts of vegan propaganda all over - including 2 (or 3?!) HUGE flatscreens showing more vegan propaganda - staring into the eye of the supreme master has its charms but is a bit heavy handed. If I'm there, I'm probably already food conscious, I don't need to see the cow death count across the world. 

All in all, i go here frequently - the dishes I like, I really like and crave. Any place that can give me 3-4 tasty lunch options is A-OK with me."}
{"text":"Went back recently. I normally avoid this place when thinking of where to go, and my friends convince me that I should come. Why do I avoid this place? Because I love meat. 

Every time I come I regret not coming more often. EVERY TIME. 

If you are trying to convince your friends that vegan food is not awful, this is the place to show them. 

This time I had the tofu eggplant and my friend had the fluffy quinoa salad  - both excellent. 

We also got the fresh spring rolls that come with the peanut dip. That dish is to die for. 

As an added bonus, this place is great for groups, as there is always plenty of seating!"}
{"text":"I'll have to admit. When I hear the words \"Loving Hut,\" I think of perhaps some primitive version of the song \"Love Shack\": 

** If you see a faded sign by the side of the road that says
15 miles to the, Loving Hut! Loving Hut yeah
I'm headin' down the Phoenix highway, lookin' for the vegan getaway
Heading for the vegan getaway, vegan getaway,
I got me a car, it's as big as a whale and we're headin' on down
To the Loving Hut... **

The song coursed through my head a few times as I ventured in and browsed through the menu (**Loving Hut baby! Loving Hut bay-bee...**). I was on a limited time schedule so I got the lemongrass chicken ($9.50) and a slice of carrot cake ($4.50) to go. Although prices seemed a bit high and that I could get lemongrass chicken made with real chicken for cheaper somewhere else, I was hopeful for a good quality meal. It took maybe 10-15 minutes for it to be made and packaged, and the cake was already prepackaged in their dessert counter. The packaging itself is paper-based and thus eco-friendly, as are their to-go bags. 

The lemongrass chicken was a generous portion of soy chunks, deep-fried, and then covered in a pungent lemongrass mixture. The texture of the \"chicken\" was kind of like a mix between fish and chicken, and was tender on the inside. The pieces were nicely seasoned and had a nice outer crunch from the deep-frying. The \"chicken\" nuggets were placed on a bed of romaine, with a slice of carrot and cucumber. As for the carrot cake, it was also a generous serving, filled with freshly grated carrot and large chunks of nuts. I loved the light, whipped topping. The ingredients themselves were great, however, it did taste slightly dry to me.

One thing to note, is that rice is not automatically included with the entrees, and will cost you $1. 

Off to the side of the cash register, there's a small section of vegetarian goods, such as fake beef and chicken. They even sell a vegan dog food!

So, even if you're an omnivore, it's a good place to get a flavorful meal. I doubt you will miss the meat! And remember,

**The Loving Hut is a little old place where we can get together
Loving Hut baby, Loving Hut bay-bee!**"}
{"text":"I only went because the person I was with wanted too. 
I will not go back. The food is vegan but not health at all
I asked multiple times about ingredients and received little information. Especially about whether the dessert had nuts. I'm allergic to nuts. I was told \" no nuts\" only to be warned by a lady sitting next to me, \" don't eat that there are definitely walnuts in the cake. \"
Ugh. Few of the staff spoke English and I was told this by her 3 times. 
It's basically fried tofu to taste like chicken. 
How many different sauces can you put on tofu?
I choose not to eat meat. 
I'm not looking for a meat substitute. Especially when you can do so many things with vegetables. 
There was a small salad. Some fruit. That was just ok. Nothing I would eat again. 
Come on Pittsburgh step up and get some good, healthy, organic, homemade food. Please."}
{"text":"The customer service was great and our waiter was friendly!

The food was okay, but not great.  With all the choices in Toronto for vegetarian, I likely won't be back unless I'm in the area and it's super convenient.

We didn't like the pad thai at all, if you eat at thai restaurants, you won't be too impressed.  The sweet & sour spicy strip dish we had was pretty good and the best thing we ordered.  I was really disappointed with the appetizer plate we got.  I usually love, love, love appetizers, but there was nothing really to rave about on the plate and I think a more suitable dipping sauce might have been some kind of a sweet & sour sauce or something different than the creamy sauce provided. 

A previous visit I tried their dish with the vermicelli and bbq mock meat.  I was excited to see something which resembled a dish from White Lotus (which has closed), but it didn't compare at all.  

It's not a bad choice if you're in the area, I'd go back if it was convenient, but we drove from the east end, found parking, etc and it wasn't worth a special trip there."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I love it. The wait staff is very casual about everything (don't go if you are in a rush). The hot tea that they serve you is my favorite! The \"meat\" and \"seafood\" dishes could really make you worry that you are eating meat. The stuffed tomatoes are delicious as well as the sweet and sour pork, I also really liked the lemon grass fish. I took a friend who was a Janeist (VERY strict diet!), and he wouldn't believe that it wasn't meat, lol."}
{"text":"Sure the service sucks and it is pretty creepy (it is run by a cult) but that vegan lemon pepper chicken and those spring rolls keep my coming back. Superb!

By the way if you like their mock chicken or shrimp (its made of yam and really good) you can find it in a package at LeiLei in Chandler."}
{"text":"I love this place.  I find it's good to change it up once in a while and this is a great alternative.  It's located in a lonely little strip mall.  Don't be fooled, they are there in all it's goodness.  Try not to pass up dessert .  They're just as yummy."}
{"text":"I really like it here! The people are nice, and the items that I like--I *really* like. The pad thai is really good, the sweet and sour spicy strip is super tasty, and I love the fries.  And the dollar value is awesome. The prices are super reasonable, but the portions are huge! 

While the menu is pretty broad, I do wish there were more new additions sometimes. It seems like things are pretty much in stone. 

Overall, I always enjoy coming to Loving Hut and I will definitely keep it up!"}
{"text":"despite a packed restaurant, the food and service was excellent. six of us ordering three appetizers and six entrees. Mongolian delight was delicious, juicy and very flavorful. Aulac Special Salad was easily the favorite of the table. fresh, flavorful and healthy. the fried rice wasn't bad but nothing special. Summer rolls and pan fried dumplings were good. Sage Lemongrass was too chewy and fried tasting, but not bad. looking forward to trying out the other dishes and supporting a friendly humble establishment!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place zero, or negative stars, I 100% would. I used to love this place, but after my last experience, I will never, EVER EVER EVER step foot in this establishment EVER again. 
My mom and I went to have lunch here a couple weeks ago. We were eating, everything was fine, and these two men (who happened to be black) came in to dine. They sat at a table and ordered their food. Then the waitress came back out moments later and asked them to pay before they received their food. They were very confused and one of the men politely stated that he didn't really want to pay before receiving his food, and she continued to tell him \"you can pay now.\" She finally walked away from them after they stated they'd prefer to eat their meal before paying. I was truly blown away. Why would you ask anyone to pay before they've received their meal if they're dining in?? 
I finally had to get up and go to the front to ASK for my check, and I asked the two men if what I saw was really what happened. He said \"yes, they didn't ask you to pay first did they?\" I said \"nope. I'm so sorry this has happened. That's incredibly rude, and so unacceptable.\" We had a short conversation, and I made my way back to my table to gather my things so we could leave. As we were boxing the rest of our food up, another couple came in and sat down. The server immediately brought the new table waters and two bowls of soup, while the two men who had been sitting there for some time, STILL didn't have waters or soup!!! They both got up after witnessing this, and confirming the prejudice that truly was occurring, politely told the cashier to cancel their order. They said thank you to me for noticing what was happening, and they left. 
I was truly blown away, and heartbroken at the overt racism I had just witnessed. That is completely unacceptable, ignorant behavior, and I truly hope people read this and they lose business. They should truly be ashamed of themselves. There is absolutely NO excuse for racism!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The food here tastes absolutely horrible. At least what my girlfriend and I had. We ordered two burgers. Mine was cold in the center, I couldn't even finish it. My girlfriend didn't even like hers. They tasted nothing like burgers. I complained to the waiter about our food and nothing was done. I do not reccomend this place. It gives vegan restaurants a bad name. You should go to the green or the Coronado, way better food and better service."}
{"text":"The service is great at this location. Out of the different entrees ordered in my group, my favorite was the Spicy Cha Cha. Usually I can't handle hot spicy, but this one was manageable and DELICIOUS! It goes well with brown rice or the House Fried Rice. If you have time and room for dessert, definitely get the Strawberry Cheesecake. It's organic, vegan, and gluten free! It is definitely hands-down the best cheesecake I have had at any vegan restaurant."}
{"text":"The food is delish. Service can be a little slow so I recommend picking up and eating at home instead. Great selection and quality, plus a very educated staff if vegan is the way you're looking to go."}
{"text":"I didn't hate it, it was okay. If you have a lot of time to piss away, go ahead and check this out. The service is super slow. There was no one to greet my fiancé and myself when we walked in.

When someone did come out about 5 minutes later, she greeted the first party and invited them to sit where they liked, so we followed suit. Then she brought out water about 10-15 minutes or so later. The water was refreshing! They have freshly sliced oranges in it!

Then about 10 minutes after that we ordered. If you're keeping track, we has been here about 25-30 mins at this point. We shared the dumplings, I had the sweet and sour divine, and he had the Garlic sensation.

The lentil soup they serve with the meal was yummy! And the dumplings can satisfy in insatiable appetite for all things dumpling. I have an unhealthy obsession with dumplings. Mmm, dumpling. 

They serve Stash jasmine green tea, which I loved. The soy chicken could be tastier but the dish was pretty good, nonetheless. I could make a tastier meat sub, myself

And holy hell, they do not know what a sense of urgency is! We had to leave and said, \"we're running late, can you go ahead and run our bill?\" Note, we has already finished eating and had not even been visited for a check. She went off, did a couple of other things, adjusted a menu on her way to the register, and finally checked us out. 

If you go, do not expect great service. Expect alright food, aloofness, and a strange ambiance."}
{"text":"I have been to better vegetarian Chinese restaurants, but the lunch specials that I tried were good (and cheap).  The faux meats suffer from what the squishy sponge like texture that plague many asian vegan places.  The sweet and sour was drowning in sauce, that didn't have enough flavor.  The chow mein though was really good, though being a carb-lover, I think the noodle to veggie ratio needed to be bumped up a lot.  Service was efficient."}
{"text":"5 Stars! just because it's the only place I know downtown that caters to us vegetarians in such a creative way. The menu alone will really impress anyone that enters. They have over 60 vegetarian items with fake meat or tofu. It's crazy to imagine what you can try next. 

My favs are the eel, sweet and sour pork and lobster...

You must try it to believe it! I take all my friends vegetarian and meat eaters."}
{"text":"How do they get the lemongrass chicken to taste and look so much like chicken?! The world will never know. 

My husband and I ventured over here on a Saturday to sample the buffet. Neither of us are vegan, but we try our best to incorporate vegan meals into our meal planning. 

The decor is bright and modern and the staff was friendly. Mostly everything I tried was delicious. I was really loving up on their fried tofu, veggie lo mein, and aforementioned lemongrass chicken. Even the salad dressing was great-- I wanted to lick my salad bowl, but refrained due to other people being in the dining room. 

The dessert cakes tasted stale, so that was a letdown. Also, I thought the price was a little steep considering the somewhat limited options. But I guess meat substitutes and fresh veggies ain't cheap, am I right?

If I head back here, I'll probably order off the main menu. All in all, a pretty good first experience at Loving Hut."}
{"text":"So much YES!! This place is a slam dunk for vegan yumminess and seating is available without a horrible wait too. The burgers are great and we adore the curries too. Definitely a winner for veg cuisine in Phoenix"}
{"text":"I could see myself becoming a vegan with the options they have to offer here. 
Started with spring rolls, those were quite good. 
I had the mongolian dish, it looks like actual beef. Tasted yummy. 
My sis had pad thai, lots of peanut flavor and maybe hints of lemongrass. I don't know exactly. 
Very flavorful I must say. The thai tea is amazing, I think they used coconut milk..so good. 
Would love to try other dishes in the future, maybe takeout next time."}
{"text":"As a first timer checking the vegan scene, I figured I'd give this spot a try. The previous reviews sounded very encouraging, and I have to admit, my experience was on par with all the positives. I honestly didn't expect to like the food as much as I did. It was fresh, very tasty, and knowing it was GMO and MSG-free made it even more appealing. It's a bit pricey, but seems worth it for what you get."}
{"text":"I love this Loving Hut location!  The food is yummy and the waiters are always very polite and attentive without being overbearing.  I live right down the street and I love to stop in for a meal every once in a while.  The only downside is that the wait on to go orders is often long, but the food is always fresh and delicious.  Their cakes are awesome and they have different varieties every day!"}
{"text":"Average vegan Asian food. Not bad, not terribly tasty. If you like processed protein, you will love this place, because just about every dish serves tofu or veggie protein or yam protein (say wha?). You can however make requests for soy-free and gluten-free. 

It's a nice quiet restaurant painted white inside with several tables set for three or four people. The servers are very lax and friendly. Also the menu is colorful with pictures.

Appetizers:

Rainbow salad - Very light dressing covering a mound of exceptionally thin sliced cabbage and veggies. It's topped with slices of veggie protein but I ate around those. Otherwise, a very good salad.

Spring Rolls - Veggie protein is chopped up and mixed in well enough so that it would take too long to pick out. They looked good, but I avoided them. Tasted the accompanying house made peanut sauce and found it to be very weak.

Dumplings - Also looked very good but the veggie protein was blended in so I avoided them. The accompanying house made sauce was very weak.

French fries - Thinly sliced, fried right, and served with basic ketchup.

Entree:

In order to avoid soy and the processed stuffs, I ordered the broccoli-mushroom dish and made special request for a plain eggplant dish. Either brown or white rice could be requested as an addition to the meal, but I opted for a side of noodles. Glad I did. 

Also, glad I ordered two dishes because ended up combining them into one, just to get a full meal. The mushrooms were awfully rubbery; they went to waste. So I paired the broccoli florets with my eggplant and stirred in the noodles. That was good. 

Beverage:

Orange juice with mint flavor and topped with flowers. I thought the orange was going to be fresh, but it tasted like it was straight from a carton. (That is the last time I believe a server who says the restaurant sells fresh juice.) The mint was an artificially dark green colored overly sweet syrup at the bottom of the glass. Not worth it.

Dessert:

Slice of maple cinnamon cake. A-Okay. Not too thick and not overly sweet. A trained tongue can tell that it's vegan."}
{"text":"I found this place right after they moved to the current location, which is a true shame, as that address had neater doors (if I was at the right place), which probably led to a more comfortable eating space than the current General Hospital Cafeteria feel. 

I started taking my orders to go, and have been much happier for it. The staff are friendly, if a bit cold. I don't mean to be offensive or impolite, but I find the looping spiritual lectures on the television in the \"bar\" (waiter station) to be off-putting, along with the waiters' intent concentration. I think they might have paintings by her on the walls, too. And a portrait. I hate the 1987 dining sets, and I don't like the plastic table coverings. I wish they served wine, but I guess it's probably against their beliefs, so I feel weird about complaining. 

The food is so good, though. I love the stuffed tomatoes, nice texture, and the hot and sour soup is both hot and sour. Sizzling rice soup is also quite good. If you eat in, they deliver the fried rice and you can put it in and hear it sizzle. The tea they serve in the dining room is also missed by taking my food to go. The lemon chicken and sweet and sour pork are my favorite entrees, but I also like the duck and eel selections. The shrimp are so realistic, if not a spot on imitation. I do not particularly care for the juices they serve, but no entree has been unsatisfactory in the years I've been going in. 

I just wish they delivered and had better hours, but I guess it isn't their thing."}
{"text":"The \"Supreme Master\" is one of my favorite restaurants in town.  The menu is entirely vegetarian with many vegan options.  

My favorite meal:
three-striped vegetable soup, a spring roll with sweet and sour sauce and kung-pow beef with brown rice.   Mmm, mmm good!

My only complaint is the the restaurant is often very quiet and the wait staff is VERY quiet and reserved.  Still, it's a great place to bring a group of friends and have a good time."}
{"text":"I used to dine at this restaurant every Saturday for the buffet.  I have not been there in a couple of months and the interest of my wife and I to dine there is waning.  With the exception of the usually-poor buffet desserts, the food offerings are good, but the lack of effective, customer-oriented management always leaves me with a sour taste in my mouth.  I secured great publicity for the restaurant through an article published in the major local newspaper, yet despite that and dozens of visits to the restaurant, I am generally \"greeted\" as if the staff has not seen me before.  It can be next to impossible to have water glasses refilled, to place a beverage order, or to have used plates cleared from the table.  On many occasions, the young lady who is \"managing\" the dining room has sat at the cash register reading, oblivious to the needs of customers in the dining room.  I look at restaurant favorites of mine like Red Tea House, Mount Lebanon, Atria's Peters Township, Scoglio Greentree, and Primanti Brothers, Mount Lebanon, and note that all of these are successful due to offering top-notch service and because of active and gracious management which makes the customer feel welcome and appreciated.  No one fills that role at Loving Hut.  I would add a note on price:  $14.99 for the buffet is pricey, especially for lunch.  The restaurant reduced the price to $12.99 some weeks ago, a wise move, but it returned the price to $14.99 the following week and for future weeks.   The restaurant has a prominent sign posted at the register area which discourages the customer from using a credit card: \"Cash is Preferable\".  As one who always uses a credit card for a charge of close to $40, this makes me uncomfortable.  The Loving Hut demonstrates that there is more to a great dining experience than simply dishing out out good food.  The diner tends to frequent establishments where he or she is made to feel that they are valued.  I would emphasize that if one would like to have a beer or glass of wine with their meal, that not only is there no alcoholic beverage service here, but that consuming alcohol is not permitted.  This is the only adult restaurant of which I am aware which imposes its moral code on customers."}
{"text":"This place is a less expensive but just as tasty Green. (But no tsoynamis.)

Great service, enjoyed the Noble Broccoli, chocolate cake! All vegan, but I went with a non-vegan and he also loved it.

Weird white atmosphere, but quiet and clean!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing!  Everything at this location was bursting with flavor, and very well executed.  However, when it comes to service, the restaurant was severely understaffed.  Our sweet waitress kept apologizing the whole time, as our food came out late, and it took around 15 minutes for us to get drinks.  Other than that, everything was great!"}
{"text":"This place is only ok because they have fewer menu options than the Eglinton location. 

But don't get me wrong they still have a ton of menu choices, just not as many as the other location!! And I love the food. yum! And it's decently priced, yay!

The only minus (and this goes for all Loving Hut locations) is the weird vegan/religion cult stuff that plays on a big tv non-stop. (???) why! Yes I'll have my soup with a side of wacko propaganda please. Exactly, just weird.

Staff are friendly and for the most part are not members of the wacko cult. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Definitely a fan of this place! This place is not fancy but has decent reasonably priced food and lots of choices. I've liked everything I've tried so far. I have not tried the sushi or any soups; I stick to their 'main dishes and have not been disappointed yet."}
{"text":"Since The Veggie House turned into Loving Hut, I have been twice, and am very delighted at some of the positive changes that have occurred.

The space itself is much lighter, and I feel more welcome by the staff. I also like that their food selection is WAY less greasy and has more of a focus on health.

I have tried the spicy cha cha twice (it is actually yam protein breaded to look like shrimp) and it is FANTASTIC. I have also had the raw salad, sweet and sour pork, fried rice, one of the noodle soups, and the stuffed tomatoes. All were good, but the stuffed tomatoes could have used a little more flavor. Great portion sizes.

They do not serve alcohol, but have some really fun concoctions to drink. Try the \"Pink Lady\" or the delightful \"Sunny Forest.\""}
{"text":"Here's the honest truth on this place: Good food, nice service, somewhat odd decor. 

I typically order for pick-up, so I haven't had too much experience eating in this restaurant. On the few occasions that I have been there I have found the servers to be polite and obliging, the food to be hot & tasty, and the restaurant to be clean. Yes, the restaurant does have a religious affiliation that it makes very clear - TV is playing a video on loop, posters of the \"Supreme Master\" - but, I honestly didn't find it to be as \"creepy\" or intense as other posters have claimed. I think of it like a family owned Italian or Mexican joint - sometimes there are cultural or religious icons there, too. 

Anywho - back to the food. If you are vegan or vegetarian you MUST try this place at least once. After living in NY for a while I mourned Phoenix's lack of vegetarian/vegan food, but then I found Loving Hut. While I can't vouch for everything on the menu - I have tried quite a bit and I swear - it gets better every time I eat it! I am a huge fan of the Sage Lemongrass, Mongolian Delight, and Sweet & Sour Divine. YUM.

One word of warning - If you are familiar with other Loving Huts: The menu is completely different. I have been to three of these restaurants now and have seen the menu range from Asian inspired to a more Mexican Vibe. This particular restaurant rocks an Asian/American feel. Additionally, some of the names of the dishes are different from venue to venue, so be aware when ordering."}
{"text":"If you're looking for vegan food, this is probably the best in town.  They used to be called the Vegetarian House, but they recently changed the name.  For those of you who really enjoyed the Vegetarian House of old, don't worry.  This is still the same place run by Supreme Master Ching Hai--it's just that the chain has changed names.  The food has changed very little.

The dishes here still have the same high quality and wonderful taste that they always had.  Their lemongrass vegan \"chicken\" and fried rice are just incredible.

And yes, expect to be bombarded as usual by the normal Ching Hai tracts on her publications and on video.  For more about Ching Hai and her \"Quan Yin\" method, see here:  http://www.godsdirectcontact.org/ .  For other viewpoints on Supreme Master Ching Hai, see here:  http://www.rickross.com/groups/suma_ching.html .

Regardless of your viewpoints on the Supreme Master, the food here can't be beaten for freshness or for taste.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I love this place. From the complimentary appetizer soup to their pan-fried dumplings to their many entrée options to their iced Mumbai Tea, everything is tasty and 100% Vegan. I highly recommend giving it a try if you have not, especially if you've had a hard time finding Vegan joints in the Phx Metro area."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Loving Hut, and I've been to Loving Huts around the country. (See my other reviews) The Pittsburgh location is just as delicious and affordable as every other Loving Hut. 

To start off, this location is a bit out of the way for me. It makes me sad, but whenever I visit my Dad and Grandma, we make sure to stop here on the way home or before. He lives pretty close, so it's a win-win situation. I wish it were closer to the city because I think they would get much more traffic that way. 

The menu is extensive and delicious. If you aren't familiar with Loving Hut, then it's important to note that all Loving Huts are a bit different. Each menu is unique, though you may see some similar items. The Sweet & Sour is one of those items. It's a lot different from the Sweet & Sour in San Francisco, though. 

I've tasted just about every item on the menu in some shape or form, and everything is absolutely delicious. It's hard to tell it's vegan! My favorite is currently the veggie burger. It's one of the best veggie burgers there is. 

Dessert is a must when you come to Loving Hut. Their dessert menu is small but phenomenal! I want to eat all of the cakes. It's hard to savor each tiny bite when you just want to eat the entire thing. It's hard to choose a favorite, but their dark chocolate cake is to die for. 

Portion sizes are perfect. You get a generous helping. Prices are on target for what you get. The staff is always pleasant, but it can be hard to get their attention and understand them. 

I've never had a bad experience at Loving Hut, and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to try something new and VEGAN!"}
{"text":"I ended up at Loving Hut randomly one day upon discovering that Freshii (it's neighbour) was closed. While it took a bit of convincing to get my friend into a \"vegan restaurant\" we both ended up happy that we went - because everything was delicious! 

Loving Hut is a strange vegan Asian-fusion restaurant. I say strange mainly because of TVs, which are constantly streaming the teachings of most world religions (well, I assume it goes through them all, I made it through Buddhism, Christianity and Islam). Their menu is absolutely HUGE - I mean this not only because of all their options, but because the size of the menu is absolutely GIANT - probably the biggest menu I've ever encountered! 

I had the avocado smoothie ($5.95 - did not look at the price before I ordered it, and wish I had because it was not worth it!) and the BBQ and Spring Rolls Noodle ($9.45), which was basically my favourite Vietnamese dish, except for soy protein instead of skewers of beef and pork. Both of these were delicious, though I have to admit, I definitely prefer the real meat version. My friend had the Mexican Wrap ($8.95) which was also quite good.

The service here was prompt; the food came quickly but was obviously made just for us (hot and fresh!). The prices were definitely decent, except of course the smoothie (why didn't I look at the price before ordering!!).

While the restaurant lacks a bit in décor (don't take anyone here on a first date), it really does make up for it with deliciousness! I will definitely be back - and I'm not even a vegetarian!"}
{"text":"Visiting from Pa and trying local vegan spots.  Loving hut came up and we wanted to try it out.  Lots of available seating at 2pm and definitely nothing fancy, but clean, however the service and smells make up for that.  They start you off with complimentary lentil soup which was fantastic! I had the loving hut burger and my wife had the sizzling veggies.  She asked for extra spice... there was none.  She said it was good but a little bland.  I recommend this place."}
{"text":"Their chow mein is my favorite!!!! But also anyone know what the use for their Vegan ham or if it's made in house? So good!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place but the service was terrible.   We were the only ones there when we arrived, sat down and glasses of water were brought to the table. About that time another couple arrived.  We got out appetizer, which was quite tasty, and ordered our dinners.  I wanted vermicelli but it was only in the appetizers so I ordered two dishes off the appetizer menu and my husband ordered a Tofu dish.

The food came out quickly but only my husband's main dish and one of the thing I ordered came out.  The server said something to me that I couldn't really understand but I assumed it meant the rest of my food would be out soon.  He left and we really didn't see him again.  The people who came in after us got their food and were paying while I was still waiting for my second dish.  My water glass was empty and I had been drinking most of my husband's by the time he brought more water.

We waited for a LONG time and finally got his attention to get a to-go box for my husband's leftovers.  He brought the box and was off again... no where to be seen.  We waited, again, for a very long time to finally ask for the check.

He did not charge us for my second dish so I am pretty sure he either didn't hear me or he forgot.  I may have been able to let that go if the service wasn't so bad because the food really was well prepared and the atmosphere of the place was nice."}
{"text":"This is one of the only true vegan restaurants in Phoenix - other than Green - and luckily it is so good! I was pleasantly surprised with all the yummy choices they had on their menu that would make any meat lover believe it's possible to live a long, healthy life of veganism;) Most of their food is Asian influenced, although they have some western favorites too- including burgers:). I ordered the spring rolls, Lemongrass (vegan chicken) Delight (A must try!), broccoli and mushroom dish, and Mongolian (vegan beef) Delight (SO GOOD!), and Fried Rice. The food was so delicious! You seriously can't tell the difference between real meat and vegan \"meat\". Go try it for yourself and see. No need to kill animals anymore to get the same tastes and foods we love.  - Still thinking about it and how good it was! - Especially the lemongrass and mongollian  delight. The sauces were soooo good!

      The place was spic and span clean and the service was great too. Best part was when they brought us ketchup and mustard bottles with our food though- I was like \"what the..??\" - as we had ordered Asian food. Apparently they use those old school diner bottles to put in Asian sauces- haha! Confusing, but it works;) ... All in all it was great and I will definitely be back very, very soon!


FYI: Beware, they have funky hours and holidays so make sure they're open before you head over."}
{"text":"These places are abundant in Vancouver where I am originally from (Canada) so the menu items and decor are not a surprise. 

It's been dead each time we've gone in and we've ordered off of the menu and the buffet. The Buffet is meh, and I would not return during that time...the menu items are hot, fresh and tasty...buffet not so much. 

Staff is friendly, it's pretty clean and very quick. 

Great option if you're on your way to the airport etc...it's also close to a lot of shopping centres which make it an efficient trip if you bundle a few things together (if coming from the city). 

The soups are great....I try to avoid deep fried foods so it's a little tough here when you want super fresh..but there are options and of course, it's all Vegan."}
{"text":"I have visited four different Loving Huts and they all have their stand-out dishes. Here in Robinson, the dish that made me stop, collaborate and listen is their Pittsburgh clay pot with mushroom and assorted funghi.

This savory pot was mind-blowingly delicious, flavor to the tenth power. I love the mushroom richness of this dish. We started with the heavenly salad and the summer rolls. I suggested the lemongrass chicken to a newcomer to both Loving Hut and vegan food and he LOVED it, scraped his plate clean.

Since our friend assumed we were in full piggy-mode, he ordered three desserts for the table. We shared (well sort of, my sister moved the coconut cream pie right in front of her face and out of my reach) the peanut butter/chocolate cake, coconut cream pie and cheesecake. The first two were very rich, but the cheesecake tasted a bit weird, not entirely unpleasant but not nearly as succulent and indulgent as the others.

Keep in mind service isn't the best, it's slow and often non-existent, but when they do serve you they are very, very kind, and super helpful. It just requires a bit of effort on your part to flag them down. This is a bit of a theme at the huts I've been to, but never deters me from enjoying this incredible, animal-saving, delectable Asian fare.

When you come be patient, the wait and effort are worth it."}
{"text":"This is an odd place... 

It's an Asian vegetarian place that promotes a plant based diet AND the Supreme Master Ching Hai (you'll see her pictures on the wall). If you like Asian vegetarian food maybe you'll like this place just fine. If you're not interested in tofu disguised as shrimp then maybe you'll not like it at all.

But, I say this is an odd place because I have also heard stories and seen articles that claim that the organization promoted by the Supreme Master is a cult. 

Now, I have no idea whether this is true, but it definitely gives you something to think about when you eat your Tofurkey chow mein."}
{"text":"OMG...Walking in you feel like your \"in the (t)WhiteLight zone\".  Is this a movie set or what?  So white with yellow...so cold feeling.... and only one customer.....

What's the deal with the two TV's broadcasting messages from the Supreme Master Ching Hai - founder of the Loving Hut cold concept?

The Pho was very flavorful and Crispy Rolls were very good.  Service was good but only few other tables came in after we were seated.

Not everything available on the menu, about 5 items have been cover over because those items are not available anymore, so if you look at the website, not everything is available."}
{"text":"Vegan joint! I always love a good vegan place. Although the Loving Hut is a franchise, they are all locally owned and the menus are different at each location. This particular location has wonderful dishes and desserts. The service is a little slow, so plan ahead. But all of the items are cooked to serve. Good cooking takes time, people. Enjoy the conversations. The staff is always pleasant and very knowledgeable about the menu items. Also, don't be put off by the building. It looks like a dive, but it is a magical experience."}
{"text":"Love this place.  My favorite is the vegan lemongrass chicken and strawberry shake.  FYI - Just pulled up and they are only open 4pm-8pm on Sundays (this Yelp page needs to be updated)."}
{"text":"I've been going here for years and sadly will not return. My favorite dish is the Pad Thai, but I have been noticing it lacks the consistency in flavor it used to have. Sometimes it's too sweet, tart, not spicy enough, not creamy enough, not the same. Today me and my friend ordered it and the flavors and colors were different. I preferred hers, but that isn't how a restaurant is supposed to work. That sucked. What a horrible feeling to be salivating at your dining mate's plate and you ordered the same thing! But to add insult to injury was the service. I ordered one of my favorite cakes, the pandan. I prefer the desserts at the Glendale location, but theirs aren't too bad and they happened to have my favorite cake. I excitedly took a bite and begrudgingly swallowed a sweet, soapy, gross tasting confectionery disaster. I had to send it back.  I told the server the problem, she took it away, and I figured it was resolved. Nope. She informs someone who appears to be a manager and they proceed to try to give me an education about Pandan cake, a cake I have had countless times before. Clearly they were insulted that I said it tasted soapy, but did I really need to see google images of the pandan leaf? Or a long story about how it is a special cake that was homemade? A simple apology would have sufficed. A few minutes after my pandan education, a small woman came peeking out at me. It was clear they were talking about me. I suspect it was the baker of the cake. Once again a simple apology would have sufficed. Instead they stood out near the kitchen and possibly attempted to curse me in Vietnamese for THEIR ill tasting cake. My dining mate still had a sweet tooth and decided to order their carrot cake. All was kind of normal until the check came. On the check I was charged $6.50 for the carrot cake. No where on the menu or their specials board is there a cake for $6.50. They do have an overpriced raw cheesecake for $7, but that's another matter. Their menu clearly states all of their cakes are $5. Tell me why I had to bring this to their attention and when they still tried to play me I actually had to read it for them. Eventually they took off the $1.50, but why was it there in the first place? Bitterness and the worst customer service is the answer. I used to really enjoy the food and service at this Loving Hut location, but now I won't return. I will never forget how nasty their attitudes were, almost like that awful cake. I added a star for Nostalgia."}

that's all i need to say.  i will fly to arizona just to eat any one of those things.

and to see david.  he's the next best thing about veg house."}
{"text":"Always clean with a large variety of vegan food. It's nice to go to a restaurant that I don't have to pick from 2 menu items. The Saturday buffet will stuff you!"}
{"text":"My god, paint the freakin place... It's incredible how many places don't get atmosphere... I don't want to eat at K-mart (nor do i want to shop at K-mart). What does a few gallons of paint and some decent lighting cost anyway? And update the bar! It is sad when a business owner loses that spark.

Alright, had a few pills... mellowed now...

The food is good - not great - but certainly a paradise of selection for all the vegetarians out there (must be 100 items on the menu). The pricing is amazingly cheap (maybe they could add 10 cents to each dish for paint). The menu threw me at first, as each dish is described as chicken, beef, shrimp, etc.. with a small disclaimer on the front of the menu that they are meat-substitutes.

Anyone else want to donate some time to help spruce this place up (yes, it bugs me that much)."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness. That was one amazing dinner that I had here. I was torn between a couple of different dishes that had gluten-free options but I ended up going with the Royal Noodle Soup and I am SO GLAD that I did because that was perhaps one of the best noodle soups I have ever had in my life. Made with a mildly spicy lemongrass broth (I actually expected it to be more spicy since it was indicated to be so on the menu, but that was fine), there were plenty of rice noodles, oyster mushrooms, and tofu to more than fill me up. 

Seriously, that broth was so freaking delicious that I wanted to keep sipping on it forever, and I pretty much did until every drop was gone. I was so full that there was no room for dessert and I was glad I didn't order any appetizers because I either wouldn't have been able to finish the soup (which would have been very sad) or I would been so full that I would have been sick.

Yum yum yum yum yum.

Service was also great. I was seated immediately and my server was great with helping me to decide what to get. Definitely on my list to go back to next time I'm in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Great food and great prices.. if you want plant based diet you have to try here.. full meals for what other charge for a la cart. Thank loving hut"}
{"text":"The Loving Hut is among my favorite restaurants in Phoenix. My boyfriend and I like to go there as much as we can. The staff are friendly and helpful, the decor is unique and the Supreme Master TV is interesting, and if you don't like it, it's never too loud and you can get a table away from the television.

For appetizers, my favorite are the Summer Rolls, but the Spring Rolls and the Moo Shu Vegetables are delicious as well.

My favorite entree is the Sweet and Sour Divine, but I'm also a fan of the Philly Dream sandwich, the Stuffed Tomatoes, the Sage Lemongrass, the Noble Broccoli and the Clay Pot Sensation. My boyfriend is also big fan of the Ginger Seaweed Ocean, but it's not really my thing.

The cheesecake is pretty good, my boyfriend really goes nuts over it. Also, the pink lady is pretty good, but I usually get water because I'm poor and water is pretty delicious, though tragically underrated."}
{"text":"Really friendly service, clean place, delicious. I was soooooooo pleased!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"My favorite place in downtown!! 

Food at this restaurant is prepared from organic vegetables and/or natural ingredients which I prefer. I found most of their dishes that I have tried to be healthy, delicious, and very reasonably priced (most dishes under $10) which came in as a shock to me given that their dishes are organic. 

I will always end with their vegan vanilla ice-cream which they make it at the restaurant from coconut milk."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out on a Sunday night around 6:30. The restaurant was kind of busy but the two servers working should have been able to handle it. We stood at the host stand about 5 minutes before the cook told us to sit anywhere and handed us menus. 

It took over 30 minutes for a server to come over and give us water. We put our order in because we were obviously ready( drinks, an appetizer, and entrée's). The sever never came back while we were waiting for the food. However, all the food came out at a reasonable time for being down a cook (about 40 minutes). At this time we asked about our drink and the other server who brought the food said they were in process. 

Half way through the food we finally got the drinks. So what about an hour and a half though the total time sitting down. 

Now the food. 

We got the heaven rolls of something and they didn't have much flavor. It came with a peanut sauce and the tofu in the rolls were breaded in peanuts. So just too much peanuts not even other complimentary flavors. 

Boyfriend got the western burger with vegetables. The burger looked store bought and the sauce tasted store bought. The vegetables were steamed but did not have any flavor or seasoning on it at all. 

I got the steak and potatoes. Steak was store bought and the potatoes were simple like morning potatoes with peppers and onions. Anyone could make it. 

I've been a vegetarian for over six years and this is the worst place I have ever been. I literally made a yelp account to give this place a bad review. Now that I actually have an account I will review more places. Usually I amforgiving when it comes to local places but I will never eat here again."}
{"text":"This place is closed!!!  I drove here to try it and walked in to find painters and construction workers.  Wanted to try it"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a spot that can conquer the 'looks like meat, tastes like meat, BUT it's not meat?!' shock factor, definitely come here. Vegan cuisine continues to surprise me! A group of us went to Loving Hut for our UYE for Veg-Curious night, and while I'm not vegan, I was really excited to try the food because it was highly recommended by our vegan friends.
I ordered a Banh Mi Philly. I was completely shocked that the \"meat\" tasted like meat! In terms of texture, it was closer to sirloin than rib eye, but I wouldn't have guessed that any of it was plant based! 
In addition I ordered the Peaceful Pink, a delicious mixture of soy milk, cranberry juice, and rose petals. It sounds so simple, but it was another surprisingly good mix!
I was lucky enough to sample some other bites, including the shrimp made from yams, that tasted just like shrimp! 
My only complaint with Loving Hut was that it took some time to prepare the food, but in my experience that's to be expected with vegetarian/vegan places. We did have a rather large group with us, and I'll definitely be going back to try more dishes!"}
{"text":"I had been to the Loving Hut once before, but it was at a time when I was trying to avoid tofu. That left very few options on the menu. I had the Rainbow Salad before they added the soy ham to it. To be honest, it was pretty bland. Perhaps now that they've added the soy ham it's more flavorful.

On my second visit, I tried the Mongolian Wonder with a side of brown rice and it was delicious. I also got the Delectable Eggplant with a side of brown rice for my husband and although the flavors were nice, it was a little mushy. We wished there were other veggies added in the dish, to balance out the flavors and textures.

Overall, the service is what really stood out as excellent. I am a teacher and was fighting my first cold of the school year, and the gal who helped me offered  her own Throat Coat tea for free and added fresh ginger and candied ginger on the side since it's soothing for a sore throat. Everyone who works at Loving Hut is friendly and quick to get you anything you may need. I love all the vegan options and definitely want to try the Hawaiian veg Burger when I return."}
{"text":"WOW!  Everything here is vegan and delicious!  I am a carnivore and came here with my vegan girlfriend on a Sunday when they have an all you can eat buffett which includes chocolate chip cookies!

The food was constantly being made and brought out so no worries about getting stuff that was made hours earlier.  I left so stuffed and sad I couldn't eat more.  I recommend trying this place especially on a Sunday (1st and 3rd of the month) for the buffett.  This way you can try a little bit of everything and see what you like.  My favorite was the lemon grass.  Not sure what that is exactly but I went back another time just for this item.

Next time I'm back in Robinson I will be eating here (with or without a vegan)!"}
{"text":"Here's the deal - the food here is incredible. As someone who is not vegan, I thoroughly enjoyed the vegan pad Thai that I ordered. It was the perfect amount of spicy, full of veggies, and filled me up just fine. My friend had the pho and as a new vegan, was pleasantly surprised with how it turned out. On top of it all, we got our food super fast which was great because of how hangry the both of us were getting

So why the three stars instead of five? Our waitress. 

She wasn't wearing a name tag and she never introduced herself, but she has shorter brown/black hair parted off to the side. She was attentive but holy crap, was she rude. Barely spoke a word to us, was pretty blunt when she did, and overall lacks customer service (or maybe social skills in general). She never checked in on us to see how we were doing or how everything tasted. Before we were even halfway done with our meal, she comes over to ask, \"Are you guys going to need anything else?\" Sorry? Way to make your guests feel like an inconvenience. Each time we said thank you, all we got was silence in return. My third graders have better manners and are far more polite. 

Not a very personable person by any means, and because of it I just might have to go to a different Loving Hut location."}
{"text":"I am not a vegetarian, and I was reluctant to try this place. So much wasted time, this restaurant is fantastic!   I told the waiter that I'd never eaten vegan food before, and he recommended several dishes for first - timers. I followed his advice, and ordered the barbecue, made with some sort of soy product. It was great, really great. I also ordered the special rolls, similar to Vietnamese summer rolls, but made with jicama and tofu in place of meat. I actually think I liked the vegan version better, and I love summer rolls. Very tasty food, very polite service; I'll be back here. I can eat a burger any time, this place is a gem!"}
{"text":"I went here for the first time last night (New Year's Eve) with one of my friends. We were seated right away and they let us pick any table that we wanted so that was nice. Inside the restaurant is minimalistic and pretty clean throughout. All the employees looked happy to be there and not dreading working which was nice to see, our waitress was nice, always filling and asking if we needed water. The wait was quite long though. I understand it was New Years Eve but there wasn't a whole lot of people in the restaurant for the amount of time we had to wait which was around 30 minutes for two dishes of the curry. We each got the curry with rice and it was delicious! Probably the best curry I've had. It was worth the wait though which in the end I would definitely come back here just for the curry!"}
{"text":"We live in Wyoming but get to Phoenix on a regular basis and the Loving Hut has become our favorite Vegan restaurant, after trying about every Vegan restaurant there.  The food & service is always great, although you may have to wait a bit longer then you would like.  We have tried the other Loving Hut Phoenix locations, but the Indian School location is clearly the best!  Make sure you try the Stuffed Tomatoes if they have them on the menu."}
{"text":"The strawberry cheesecake pushed this to 5 stars, so fluffy, so light, so tasty like a whipped cream cheesecake.  Each meal we had here was delicious, they completely accommodated all of our needs - GF, no garlic, no onions - made suggestions, etc.  Best meal I have had on such a restricted diet in a long time.  Loved the spring rolls, wish we had more time in AZ, we enjoyed walking back to the hotel every night after a delicious dinner."}
{"text":"This place may claim to be \"vegan,\" but not the vermin that we saw running in and out of the kitchen.  This place is not only rude bad customer service, their unsanitary and quite honestly, dangerous for people's health!  Never been before but tried and boy am I glad we had time to gaze around while waiting forever for the food.  I told one of the owners, but they only got upset and after I canceled our order, they made us pay for it anyway!  That's ok because at least I know not to eat there and I didn't!!! Thank God!"}
{"text":"This place is good for people who are not vegans as well and, of course, vegans will especially enjoy it!! It has a very nice menu with tons of delicious options.
I recommend it to anyone who is looking for a healthy alternative to an every day menu."}
{"text":"This is, hands-down, the most uncomfortably stark, awkward,1980's hospital-esque diner I've ever stumbled upon in my life. 

The food was tasty and the menu is more varied than any other vegan restaurant in town... but somehow, that doesn't cut it. I thought I knew what I was going to try next time, but in retrospect, I'd rather not subject myself to that atmosphere much more than I'd like to try the soy protein fish.. which is somewhat disappointing, because I really did want to try that fish."}
{"text":"If you are a vegan and love Chinese food this is the place to be! I love the orange chicken and it's amazing!!!  Amazing vegan cookies! The staff is great but this is my to go place for a great vegan dish"}
{"text":"Loving Hut is part of a chain of vegan restaurants scattered throughout the world. Each restaurant is family owned and operated. They're usually pretty decent. This one is no exception. I've gone here three times during the Saturday lunch buffet and have left stuffed every time. 

My only complaint is that the little cake squares are usually dry. My guess is that it's due to the \"buffet dynamic.\" (People gorge themselves on buffet victuals; people don't want dessert because they're too full; poor cake squares sit abandoned and sulking while hot lights and the elements sap their youth away.)

When you go be sure to flip through some of the \"Supreme Master's\" books kept up front. There are tons of choice pictures of the Supreme Master posing with her menagerie while looking deep in thought. It's prime fodder for a game of \"make up your own caption.\" Very enjoyable..."}
{"text":"For my visit, I walked in on Sunday night at 7:32. No one greeted me for 14 minutes. Not exaggerating. I was surprised since I assumed I would at least see a worker around. One appeared around 7:39 to give some people their take away food, but no one approached me. Maybe their staff quit today and they only had one worker?

Not great since I had driven 20 minutes to get here. I have been eating vegan for about 16 years and was curious to try their fare.

When I was approached, and I told the gal that I had been waiting for so long, she apologized. But she did not offer any compensation for my troubles. I would expect her to comp the meal at least. At least.

Plus some guy had his dog inside the restaurant and it was not a seeing eye dog. Gross. Trying to be \"cool\"? Keep your dang dogs away from my food. Maybe I should contact the health department?

I left without ordering/eating because of the terrible service here. However I am sure they were relieved...it meant they would not have to stay late. Whew! Oh well, it's only one bad Yelp review. Maybe it won't get noticed!

Vegans, I suggest staying away from here until it gets sold to new owners who care more about service.

You know what they say: a good experience means you tell on average, 1 person, but a bad experience means you tell on average, 11 people. Yikes. Is that worth a free meal? Uh, I think so. Plus the lifetime value of a new customer could easily add up to $500+ a year. If that worth a free burger? Uhm, yeah."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of the Loving Hut chain. Each is individually owned & operated, so when visiting a Loving Hut in a new city, for the first time, I try to go in with no real expectations as far as the menu is concerned.  When I moved to PHX last year I tried this location.  I ordered the Hawaiian Burger & the golden wontons to go. To my dismay, the \"burger\" wasn't a burger at all. It was a weird white-looking soy substance, which I couldn't identify, & my golden wontons were more like blackened. I was put off & did not return for a long while. 

For some reason, maybe it was the sweet little ladies who work there, I felt compelled to give them another try. I am SO glad I did. Major improvements across the board, & they have recently revamped their menu.   

My fav appetizers:
- Golden Wontons have been consistently fried to golden perfection. 
- Pan-fried Dumplings are yummy & the sauce is delicious. 

Fav entrees:
- Guru Fried Rice is so addictively (not a real word) delicious. Something about that curry spice on the brown rice (you can choose white or brown rice); I can't go a week without it!

- Noble Broccoli, is a vegan \"beef\" & broccoli dish. The soy beef is savory, and the broccoli, though crunchy, is soaked in a mouth-watering brown sauce. My non-veg*n friends really love this dish. 

- Sweet & Sour Divine is their vegan sweet & sour chicken. It's simply perfect. The \"chicken\" is encased in perfectly battered & fried balls, dressed in a classic sweet & sour sauce, with pineapples, red & green peppers, & onions. So yummy!

- Spicy Cha Cha, which reminds me of shrimp, less the fleshy, fishy taste. It is very flavorful, and the menu now offers tartar sauce as an option. I tried it this way last week & went back 3 more times afterwards! Some of the best vegan tartar sauce around! Also with the new menu, this dish is now offered with your choice of fries or steamed veggies. Get it with fries for a \"fish & chips\" type meal.
This dish is yam based, as opposed to soy, so it's also a good option for those who avoid soy. 

- Loving Lemongrass is hard to describe. Thin slices of lightly breaded faux chicken deliciously seasoned. Muy sabrosa! Kinda like Pringles; once you pop, you can't stop! 

The entree portions are plentiful and I always have left overs (unless I'm sharing my dish).

If you're in the mood for a sandwich, try the new Ocean Sandwich. I was a little skeptical at first but it was so good! That amazing tartar sauce really compliments this sandwich; I asked for extra sauce. Yum! 

Speaking of that tartar sauce (again)... The menu offers a side of yam protein, which is basically a plain version of the Spicy ChaCha pieces. Be sure to ask for it fried, with a side of fries and Voilà: a fried shrimp & fries basket. Don't forget the tartar sauce!!

The Hawaiian burger is one of my favorites from the LH chain. At this location you have to ask for a \"burger\" patty, otherwise you'll get that funky white soy patty, which I've just learned is supposed to be a \"chicken\" patty. (Get the burger patty instead & leave happy.)

Is it dessert time? Good, because Loving Hut has one of the BEST vegan cheesecakes on earth. Seriously. Been around the world and I-I-I, I can't find a vegan cheesecake this good! That's all I'll say. Try it! Yummy ice cream flavors too: chocolate, cherry chocolate chip, vanilla. If you avoid soy, ask for the ice cream made with coconut milk. 

When you dine in you get a yummy bowl of hot lentil soup. The drinking water is fruit-infused, usually with oranges; it's very refreshing. Service is not fast, so if you have a set or timed lunch break, you'll want to call ahead for a carry out order.  (They have Eco-friendly to-go containers.) My food is always hot & fresh, and I'm typically in no hurry so I have no complaints regarding the wait. 

The owners are so sweet and friendly; they always greet you with smiling faces. The decor is simple and elegant; it has a very peaceful ambiance. 

So to sum it up, this Loving Hut has become one of my all time favorite dining spots. Awesome vegan food that will please & satisfy veg*ns & omnivores alike."}
{"text":"Oneness Fountain Heart in Flushing, Queens is one of the weirdest places I have been. There is a vibe of serenity and peace within the restaurant that can only be matched by Loving Hut or marijuana. The vegan buffet is a great deal. I sampled all things except for the mushroom dish. Mushroom is a perfect word to describe the fungus. They are mushy. The service is excellent. Don't absorb dark death energy by eating animals. Be loving to them in the hut."}
{"text":"Tonight not only did I have my first vegan meal out of the friendly confides of my kitchen, I had my first taste of Viet Nam cooking. First, if using a GPS to find this place, put it away, it sends you to a car dealership and Loving Hut is about 500 yards away behind the Sheetz off Stuebenville pike.

Once inside the place looks very sterile, almost \"OPERATING ROOM\" sterile. White booths, tables, chairs, napkins, dishes, and teapots. I was very uncomfortable, too much white....everywhere!

A very nice waitress came to our table, Jamie, (Fellow vegan friend of Joe or FVFoJ if you will) ordered green tea, and I the same, then she explained the specials, asked if either of us had food allergies or special diets. I told her I didn't eat fried foods or nuts and avacados. She pointed out the spring rolls were very low fat except for tofu and the dipping sauce was peanut free. This appitizer was huge, 10 perfect spring rolls stuffed with all of nature's goodness, thai basil, carrot, tofu, and mint. 

For dinner I ordered Pho, a rice noodle dish with textured soy protein, celery balls, thai basil, crisp onion, a ton of rice noodles and celantro in a very delicate asian broth. FVFoJ ordered the same. We slurped noodles, talked about how the teaparty couldn't hold a candle to the people of Egypt, and just in general had a great time! I even forgot the place was way too sterile and white. Me and Jamie will be back to try other delicious things at Loving Hut."}
{"text":"Deliciously flavorful food.  The soy meat had nice texture and flavor, and the sauce on my dish was perfect.  This place is a gem if you're vegetarian, but is also worth a try if you simply enjoy flavorful asian cuisine."}
{"text":"Yelp needs to allow 1/2 stars like Netflix. I give Loving Hut 3 1/2 stars. My carnivore friend invited me out for birthday lunch and let me choose the spot sooo I decided to try the new Indian School location. She was a bit hesitant, but it was my birthday so she agreed. 
The interior cracked my up a bit, it looked like what a dining hall in a state institution in NJ in the 80's might have looked like. New but outdated furniture and LOTS of white. Our waitress was really sweet and helpful and especially patient with my friend who looked like a dear in headlights looking over the menu. 
We settled on spring rolls, veggie moo shu and the guru fried rice. The spring rolls were small, but perfect appetizer size. I hate when appetizers are so big that I am too full for the main course. They were good, but nothing extraordinary. I really enjoyed the moo shu veggies, we each at two. Then the soup (which came with the entree) tasty lentil and veggie soup. A nice little treat before the man course. We both liked the guru fried rice as well, it had a strong curry taste and was much more flavorful than typical fried rice. We had plenty leftover, which i was sad to see go to waste, but I have a weird aversion to take out or take home food. It grosses me out. 
I was really pleasantly surprised with how much my friend really enjoyed the meal, we both got a giggle out of the decor, but would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Really good vegetarian dishes. Prices are really great. I really love the angel rolls."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars here. I'm pretty stingy with the 4 and 5-star ratings, mind you. I've been to LH twice and have enjoyed my lunch both times. I am by no means vegan or even vegetarian, but I do enjoy good food. 

My first experience was lunch with a co-worker, so we decided to eat in. Agreed that the decor is rather stark and minimalistic - which would be perfectly fine but it looks as though they painted old fast food restaurant booths with white paint. So it has that grunge-y sorta vibe. 

I ordered the Deluxe Vegetables which was a medley of veggies, soy protiens like tofu and seitan, with brown sauce. The sauce was fantasic! Savory with a hint of sweetness and plenty of it! 

My second experience was for take-out and Pad Thai was the special that day. Believe it or not, it's probably the best Pad Thai I've had here in Pittsburgh. The sauce was spot on and reminded me of my favorite Thai restaurant in Kentucky (yes, Kentucky). They used a wider, flat noodle which was unexpected, but it held the flavor well. This dish also had tofu and seitan, and also some vegetarian shrimp. I highly recommend LH to anyone, vegan or not!"}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS AMAZING!!! Hands down, definitely one of my favorite spots in Pittsburgh. I can't recommend Loving Hut enough, especially to the vegetarians/vegans out there. I've been to the Saturday buffet ($15) multiple times, and I can't get enough. Though it is a small buffet, the variety of different vegan entrees (tofu, seitan, veggies) and desserts is fantastic. It is a challenge to make vegan food flavorful and appealing, but I was in love with everything they offered. As a Vietnamese American, it's hard enough to find good Vietnamese food in Pittsburgh, so to find a great vegan Vietnamese restaurant is heaven! I could eat here everyday for the rest of my life."}
{"text":"Oh Boy!  Vegan?  Delicious?  Close to my house?  Whoo Hoo!  Yes, it's true, the wait is very long for your food so plan accordingly. Come a half hour before you get too hungry, and  bring a book, a kindle, or something to occupy your time--like maybe a friend to talk to? 

My friend had the Hawaiian Burger and raved about it for two days.  I had the Pad Thai and am currently fantasizing about it.

We wanted the Red Velvet cake since it looked amazing, but it sold out before I could get my hands on a slice.

Never mind, we tried the banana cake with coconut icing.  That was pretty fantastic, but had more crumbly texture than a cake-it was more muffin-ey maybe.  Still freaking great though!"}
{"text":"The food is fantastic.. who knew you could have so many crazy vegan substitutes for weird meats..  the atmosphere leaves a bit to be desired (the last time I was there there was a tv showing some sort of religious figure speaking for about an hour) but the food totally makes up for it."}
{"text":"We visited the Loving Hut for the first time today, during lunch. The service was prompt, the location was clean & peaceful, and the food was pretty good. We got the spring rolls, the sweet/sour divine, and the coconut curry soup. Everything was tasty. Our only issue was with payment, when the server overcharged us by $12. We had to call her back and show her, then she refunded my boyfriends' card for the $12. We still left a good tip since it appeared to be just a mistake."}
{"text":"FYI: I just passed this place Saturday, May 15, 2010 and it is now a LOVING HUT chain restaurant.

I used to looooooooooove the Vegetarian House's Lemongrass chicken. Salty but absolutely hard to tell it wasn't meat. Great stuff. Hopefully, they don't change the recipe but I'm guessing they will."}
{"text":"I had the purplicous eggplant and my bf had the western burger.  Flavors were amazing but I wish the eggplant was cut smaller and wish there was more tofu to even out the ratio.  My bf didn't like the fries that came with the burger since it was on the chewy side, maybe because we ordered to go??"}
{"text":"I have going to this rest. for about 15 years, since they were on 7th Ave. It is family owned by the sweetest people, and it is my family's favorite place to eat out in Phoenix. We have a family of 5, and The Loving Hut makes every one of us happy!"}
{"text":"I have been vegan for over 2 years now and i have never been to a vegan restaurant before. This place is a nice little restaurant tucked away from the main road. I was pleasantly surprised by how friendly the staff is. The menu isnt anything spectacular but everything was delicious. Ive been here twice now. I will say the food is kind of bland and there's nothing really to choose from besides soy dishes. But i did enjoy it. The 2 times i have been there our table was the only one in the restaurant. I dont know what kind of business they do. If your in the area and want vegan food give it a try."}
{"text":"I was at this location about two weeks ago. This location decoration is really great and bright.

Let talk about food in here: my favorite is Bun Hue. I love lemongrass chicken and boba drinks. You should try their boba drinks. It is really tasty and healthy. 

Staffs are great. They helped you to choose the right food for your taste. 

You could bring the big group here for any occasion you want: birthday, baby shower, bridal shower, a night out... Let them know and your party will be perfectly served well. 

I can't wait to come back again to this place."}
{"text":"Wonderful vegan place. They have a ton of vegan dishes. Very good varieties. I tried their all day buffet which is on Saturdays.

Ambience is good & fast service. Also got a bakery in the front"}
{"text":"So good.....so, so good. Even though I didn't like the dish I chose, everything else was delicious. My niece is a vegetarian and so I took her here and we both loved it. We got the veggie crepes...omg...yum! That hoisin sauce....I got what I thought was a sweet potato dish but I vaguely remember her telling us it was kind of fishy tasting. Niece loved it tho. She got bbq noodles and those were pretty good as well. Oh...and they start you with a delicious lentil soup. We took vegan carrot cake home for later and who knew??? It was great! Go...now...get there! Try the crepes."}
{"text":"When you give up meat, you don't have to give up buffets! The all day Saturday buffet will even satisfy your meat-loving friends. I always go hungry and leave stuffed to the gills. My fave is the lemon grass \"chicken\", crunchy and fried to a golden perfection, you can't go wrong with pilling it on your plate.

The buffet also offers two kinds of rice, brown and jasmine, soup, salad, fruit, and desserts. Loving Hut just started carrying fresh-baked vegan pastries. The buffet is not usually offered during the slower winter months, however, the buffet entrees can be ordered off of their regular menu.

Robinson is a hike for me, but my husband and I make a monthly trip out there to enjoy the vegan delight that is Loving Hut."}
{"text":"Loving Hut has a new fan!

I've read comments from fellow Yelpers regarding slow service but can happily say we didn't experience this during our visit. We were seated quickly, ordered our food quickly, and had it brought out very expeditiously. Granted we went on a slow Sunday afternoon. 

My friend and I ordered some great appetizers to start- she had the summer rolls and I had the spring rolls. Both were uber tasty. The tofu in the summer rolls was excellent and I honestly can say that these spring rolls were the best I've ever had. Really scrumptious!

For our entrees, my friend had the \"steak\" and potatoes (she seemed to really enjoy it) and I had the BBQ Noodles. 

I thoroughly enjoyed the golden rolls that came atop the rice noodles and the noodles themselves, but wasn't a fan of the vegetable protein \"meat\" slices. Unfortunately, Fresh Mint in Scottsdale does a similar dish and their faux beef is head and shoulders above Loving Hut. It's seriously unparallelled. Perhaps had I not had anything to unfavorably compare it to, I would have loved it though?

I also thought it was weird to include lettuce in a hot noodle dish. They were a totally unnecessary addition.

I ate a few bites and didn't ask for a box which I think offended the woman who waited on us. Sorry ma'am- it just wasn't good, no offense intended. I loved everything else I promise! ;-)

Anyway, for dessert we ordered the raspberry cake and it was so friggin delish...yum, yummity, yummers! It was sweet, super moist and just incredible. Being the sugar fanatic I am, I cannot wait to go back to try their other desserts!

Overall, despite not liking my entrée, I was impressed with the majority of the food and their wildly extensive menu and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I guess for a Vegan this is heaven, but I am not a vegan. lol 
Regardless of that, I actually don't mind tofu or meat substitutes, but my issue was not with the \"meat\". I ordered the pad thai, that came in a spicy thai sauce but it was more like a curry. I am not a fan of masaman curry as it has made me sick multiple times, and this time was no exception. 

There is an overwhelming flavor of nut that just tastes like curry noodles, so just be aware of that. the other thing was that a thai tea as $3.50 and it was very small. I have had larger portions for less money and it was just okay. 

Overall, not happy with my experience but for the right person, I'm sure this is a great place!"}
{"text":"1st time visitor.  This place is awesome . It is super clean, well lit ,nicely decorated and has a feeling of calmness. The hostess was very sweet to us . It was buffet Saturday and the choices were plenty for a vegan buffet. Rice was cooked perfectly and the soup looked tasty as well. A few desserts for something to satisfy your sweet tooth. The price was worth it. I would definitely go there again. Great place."}
{"text":"I go enjoy a nice Loving Hut meal from time to time, I just find that the service is at times a little slow and the prices can get a little high for what I would consider to be a fast type of meal, but still worth a semi regular visit especially if you live close to it as I do.
The summer rolls and the Thai curry are where its at"}
{"text":"We were visiting from California. We searched for vegan restaurants. The service and the food and the atmosphere were fantastic. 
The prices were extremely fair. We wish there were one near us."}
{"text":"I'm not a vegetarian, but I enjoy vegetarian and vegan cuisine.

Service was A+.   The pretty waitress (tall, blonde, very friendly) was superb.  I love her!

The fusion food was awesome.  Great service.  There's nothing not to love here.

Carrot Soup: B+
A tad bland, but very nice flavor.

Sizzling tofu: A-
Great flavor, nicely fried, great spicy flavor.  It could benefit from a dipping sauce, but otherwise simply spectacular.

Thai Spicy Vermicelli: A
Again, FANTASTIC flavor.  Nice and spicy.  It's huge, so make sure you're hungry.  I loved this and would definitely order it again."}

{"text":"From the outside, a strange looking place with a cryptic name. But inside it's a different story. 

Vegans should be enamored by Loving Hut (I'm not vegan, but occasionally enjoy a vegan meal). The menu is as vast and diverse as a Chinese vegan menu can be. The \"proteins,\" a.k.a. soy chicken, soy beef, and soy shrimp, should win oscars for best actor. Their consistencies and flavorings were great. I started with the fresh garden rolls and had a the New York stir-fry chicken entree. Both were fantastic.

The service was also a highlight -- our server took the time to explain the entire menu, and even offered her own recommendations based on our preferences.

It's a family-owned place, and I was proud to support them. Even though there was a TV streaming vegan propaganda in six languages, I thoroughly enjoyed my meal and highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Not open when they say they are. Lock the doors and shut down kitchen before closing time. Don't pick up the phone.

Wish I could leave a decent review for a vegan place, food is good, but can't say how many times I've come and they aren't open without notice. Annoying."}
{"text":"I'm not a vegetarian, but who can honestly resist any manner of hash slung by a CULT? A cult right around the corner!!!  You dont even have to travel to California.  I came in with a good attitude, ready to acknowledge ( if not worship outright) all appropriate deities - but left a bewildered non believer.  

We endured baffling service, and it pains me to say it, because there was not a hint of rudeness. Just communication obstacles that I suspect involved more than language. To make a long story short, we had no idea what we ordered, despite numerous attempts to probe our waitress for such rudimentary information.  It was comic, really, until the food arrived. 

My mother's Vietnamese entree was more a Greek tragedy of inedibly chewy mock chicken (she had asked several times for something easy to chew). Mine was better, but I've forgotten what it was.  The Seventh Heaven Salad was ok (more like third or fourth heaven) and we both liked the cup of complimentary chicken soup. That was a nice touch, and something we could all understand. 

It took several minutes to communicate that we wanted a knife. I ordered  Thai iced tea, which unbeknownst to me was 'code' for ice water. It's hard to get too mad though.  Despite the confusion, it's about the cheapest sit down restaurant around.  People seemed nice, in an interplanetary way. We had what amounted to a disappointing pot luck, and the service was extraordinarily weird. 

Bon appetit !!"}
