{"text":"This is my go-to sushi place, not just because it's close to my place, but because it's actually good quality, authentic and Japanese owned.

I've been there several of times and the service has always been exceptional. From what I can tell it's run by a couple; one serves while the other preparing the order.  They are always attentive and polite even when business picks up and orders pile on.

The sushi rice is always perfect; not too sticky and just the right temperature. The fillings are always proportionate and fresh. Their sashimi plate is delicious and well priced too.

It is overall an excellent price for the value."}
{"text":"Tres bon sushi a Verdun. Decor simple mais joli. Intime. Service impeccable. Prix tres abordable. Poisson tres frais."}
{"text":"Really very good by Montreal standards, good even by Vancouver standards. Pricing is a bit peculiar, some things are crazy expensive and others seem under priced.  It has become my go-to sushi place."}
{"text":"having moved from vancouver, we've often been disappointed at the asian food here. this was not one of those places.

the sushi here is well priced, and excellently made. other than the elusive karaage, which does not seem to exist in its real form anywhere in this city due to what restaurant owners attribute to \"local taste\"*, everything else is quite authentic as well. authenticity aside, we really like the taste, and at the end of the day, thats probably more important (unless you're one of *those* people...;-)

*this happened at a taiwanese places as well where we tried to order salt and pepper chicken... haha"}
{"text":"We live in Verdun and love sushi! The restaurant is small and narrow though nicely decorated with soft ambient music playing in the background. The Japanese couple behind the counter are super nice and friendly and the food is fresh and moderately priced! We usually order for take-away and have never been disappointed. The portions are generous and if you like eel (even if the thought of it makes you wince) try the nigiri version - delicious! We are so happy that there is such a remarkable sushi spot so close to us!"}
{"text":"Great value, best sushi in Verdun and for the price best value in Mtl. Went 3 times and each time was AAA quality. If you takeout the combo sushi the cheapest one is so affordable around 35$ for 2, though comes with a large % of goberge sushis but still overall quality and confection is excellent."}
{"text":"BEWARE FOOD POISONING! Ordered from here last night. Waited an hour for the sushi. My girlfriend and I ate it and it was good at the time. Woke up this morning feeling awful! Sick to our stomachs. Stay away. Their service is crap as well. The guy making the sushi was really rude to me when I questioned having to wait an hour when he only had a table of 5 in house. Don't do it!"}
{"text":"Despite being ran by a Japanese couple this spot feels kitsch and middle-of-the-road. The $15 sashimi plate for example sometimes features tasty albacore tuna next to extremely chewy barely thawed octopus. You can definitely find better value at Park or Kazu if you don't mind taking the metro."}
{"text":"Le sushis frais et gouteux, l'essentiel quoi"}
{"text":"Food is certainly four stars, especially for Sud-Ouest MTL. And the service seems quite attentive. BUT, the restaurant is very small and they are understaffed for peak times. So go early or on off days. 

NOTE: No take out after 6PM on weekends. See my comment above about being understaffed. I uploaded the menu to make phone ordering easier."}
{"text":"Very nice, cosy small restaurant, good and fresh sushi... and not even expensive."}
{"text":"I can't believe there's an authentic Japanese place 30 seconds from my apartment! I should be ashamed of myself as a Japanese lmao. I have walked by this place so many times for the past year and I never entered because I thought it was a shady place owned by a non-Japanese person. However, I was still really curious, so I decided to take it to Yelp (like I do with every restaurant), and I found out the owners were Japanese! Also, by authentic, I don't mean authentic as in it's completely the same as how they make it in Japan. This restaurant adapted well, kept the essence of Japanese food and culture while adding in some Canadian/Montrealer elements. It also isn't fancy Japanese food like many restaurants here, it's very casual and has a lot of foods that Japanese families would make (which might not be appreciated by people who aren't too familiar with Japanese culture). I personally really liked that a lot though!

My family and I went there for a weekday dinner. It was not crowded at all, there was only another table taken by 2 people and that was it. The place is small, only has a few tables, which gave a nice homey vibe but seemed difficult if it was super crowded. We ordered a sushi plate and many appetizers because we were very excited. We got Japanese croquettes, ebi tempura (shrimp tempura), aji furai (fried horse makarel), agedashi tofu (fried tofu with dashi or broth), then we got some matcha ice cream as dessert. They were all delicious and being deprived of Japanese food, my sister and I were just in heaven.

The only letdown was the service, the owners had a somewhat cold attitude and didn't have a lot of \"will\" to serve, unlike the usual customer service in Japan. But I personally don't mind that too much, since I care more about the food than the service. But if you do mind the atmosphere and the all-around vibe of the place, you might want to take that into consideration. 

Overall, I would recommend this place to smaller groups on non-peak hours. They're only operated by a couple, so it will be understaffed when it's a full house. Our food came super quick when there was only one other group, but I don't really know how bad it'll be when there are more people. The food brought me back to my childhood so I'll definitely be visiting when I feel like some comfort food again, especially when it's so close by!"}
{"text":"Great service, good food (very Japanese), and very reasonable price. We had the spicy octopus and cucumber, and vegetable tempura to start, with sashimi and tatami to follow. With two beers, it came to $65, inc tax before tip. Will be back."}
{"text":"I love the couple that work here. They work really hard and their sushi is AMAZING. I generally don't eat in here, I usually order the take out. 

The quality of the fish is amazing and they usually take the freshness of the fish seriously. I would not go their with your children, there are no high chairs, and its a pretty small place. Its quiet and quaint!

I love their handrolls! As well, it is decently priced."}
{"text":"This place is very small but do not judge a book by it cover. The menu is very good selection. We started off with tempura vegetables which were very hot crispy and fresh. We order 7 different types of sushi. The sushi rolls were fresh and tightly rolled. The service was great and recommend the place as one of the five top places in Montreal. The prices are very reasonable and we will be back."}
{"text":"Very cozy restaurant. Nice service, but make sure you tip. Try wellington rolls!"}
{"text":"Absolute let down. 

  What a disaster, where to begin? This was my second attempt at eating here, the first time my wife an I were shooed out after asking if they did take out. They do not. We would have been willing to sit but after such a great start we decided to pass. 
  Round two: this time we ordered to pick up. Upon arrival (within the timeframe we were told) we pick up two boxes. 

  One, my own, where the warm spider roll was stored with the cold rolls. The spider roll was almost flavourless besides that burnt flavour that comes from a dirty fryer. The Boston rolls were warm,  making the would be refreshing roll rather distasteful as well. Lastly the unagi nigiri, I saved for last because it is my favourite, did not taste fresh at all. Half of my order went into the bin. 
  The second, my wife's, looked like they didn't clean the surface that they prepared it on. There were bits of smelt row on various pieces, this often uses preservatives that contains gluten which is problematic as my wife told the person that we ordered with that she is a celiac.

  It's pretty safe to assume that we will not be going back."}
{"text":"Another jewel on Wellington street, Aka-Fuji is tiny Japanese restaurant that can hardly accommodate up to 30 people. One of the reasons the service feels so personal and attentive. The place is decorated with numerous views of mount Fuji and quiet Japanese music flows in the background.
The menu is pure joy for sushi lovers and has extensive choices, including vegetarian options. Every sushi roll was absolutely delicious, the best is there were no overwhelming tastes and spices, the sushi just tastes natural and fresh.
The choice of spirits is limited to beer, house wine and sake. Nice touch was to be offered to choose your own sake cup from a little basket."}
{"text":"This place is Legit Japanese. 

Having lived in Japan, restaurants which bill themselves as Japanese but then serve up something deep-fried beyond recognition as \"tempura,\" or a mayonnaise-covered monstrosity wrapped in rice and seaweed and try to tell me it's \"sushi\" make me angry. Like green-skin-and-purple-pants angry.

I went here last week with the gf, and it was much better than I expected for a Japanese restaurant on the east coast, let along for one on Wellington St in Verdun! 

The place has a very Japanese (but still causal) feel to it, which is obvious as soon as you walk in. The space isn't big, and it wasn't too busy when we went there on a Friday night. You could see from the back-log of takeaway containers that the place is popular (there was a constant stream of people coming in to place and pickup orders). I always feel like any popular sushi restaurant must be pretty good - there's not a huge room for error when you're serving raw fish.

The tempura batter was light, and dipping sauce spot-on (not too much soy sauce). The sushi was good, and I'll definitely be going back there. I wasn't a fan of the signature Wellington Roll (it's deep-fried, see above), but that's more because of my sushi-snobbery than anything else. I'm sure it's great for you sushi-heathens. 

The prices were good value for money (not the cheapest place in town, but then again I wouldn't want to eat sushi from the cheapest place in town).

We didn't get sake, but there's a few of them on the menu so you can indulge if you want to get your samurai on. They also have wine and beer, but you can't bring your own."}
{"text":"Pendant un an, j'ai été chanceuse de vivre en Australie où les bons sushis se retrouvent en abondance. Même ceux vendus au magasin du coin à côté du McDo sont bons là-bas. Ici, à Montréal, ça n'est vraiment pas toujours le cas. Disons que les poissons du fleuve Saint-Laurent ne se portent pas tous très bien à la confection de sushis.

Je suis donc allée à Aka Fuji en me disant que si je me fiais aux avis des autres, c'était pour être bon, mais pas nécessairement extraordinaire. J'ai été très satisfaite de mon repas et je vais y retourner avec plaisir. À voir les chefs aller, ils reçoivent quand même beaucoup de commandes pour emporter donc peut-être que c'est ce que je vais essayer un autre bon jour. Ça n'a pas été le meilleur sushi de ma vie, mais il est définitivement dans mon top 5 des meilleurs de Montréal.

À chaque fois que je vais essayer un nouveau resto à sushi, je me commande la même chose: edemame, tempura, rouleaux variés. Les edemames étaient bons et sont venu chaud comme je les aime quoi que ce soit une entrée assez difficile à manquer. Le tempura était très joli (oui, oui...joli) et les légumes et crevettes étaient pannés légèrement. Pour les rouleaux, on a partagé l'assiette épicée et un rouleau Wellington. J'ai bien aimé les rouleaux épicés. Ils étaient frais et goûteux. Le rouleau Wellington était différent (il est frit et servi avec une mayo épicée) et bien qu'il est bon, c'est simplement moins mon genre. Je préfère les sushis frais et les sashimis à ceux qui sont frits.

Considérant qu'on est aux abords du Saint-Laurent et non de l'océan Pacifique, j'ai bien aimé l'endroit. Les prix sont justes, les sushis sont faits frais sur commande, l'endroit est petit, simple et chaleureux et le service est délivré avec sourire."}
{"text":"SO GOOD! Serious must-try. It took me months to review because I want to keep it to myself and the already-regulars. I can't say what the perfect authentic sushi is but I'd say this is the most authentic and fresh I've had in town, and we have some pretty amazing spots. Very very affordable too! They have large platters and amazing appetizers (chicken dumplings and their simple salad & miso soup) and it's usually like 40-50 for 2 people for appetizers and lots of sushi only!"}
{"text":"Very good sushi for a great price. Everything was fresh and tasted on point. We also ordered tempura vegetables which were only ok, would honestly go just for the sushi!"}
