{"text":"Let's just say I found a new favorite breakfast spot in Charlotte. The Southern Scramble was amazing and I'm not big on cheesy but they were delicious! Normally when I eat out I have leftovers, but today I cleaned my plate. The atmosphere is fun and the customer service was great. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We've been here at least five times since moving to Charlotte...and it never disappoints. Worth the wait if there's a line, with two or four people the waits never more than 10-20 min. I've had the high flyer, the benny, veggie scrambles, chocolate chip pancakes. Any breakfast we've had has been excellent. I always want to try the lunch/dinners but am a sucker for breakfast foods. The biscuits are huge. Service is fast and generally solid."}
{"text":"We went for breakfast on a Tuesday morning. I got the Southern Scramble and it was wonderful.  So incredibly tasty and fabulous.  The grits were also very good, but my goodness, there was so much butter in them they should call them \"Butter Grits\".  My dad got the biscuits and chicken sausage gravy and here is where things went wrong.  I also got a side of the chicken sausage gravy to go with the biscuit that came on my plate.   The outside of the biscuit was hard and the inside seemed undone.  The top of the biscuit had SUGAR.  Bleh.  While I liked the flavor of the chicken sausage gravy, my dad didn't and then complained of the taste \"revisiting\" until lunchtime.  Neither one of us liked the biscuits at all, which is odd since the name of the joint is Biscuit Café.  They state you can order toast instead of the biscuit ... so will do that next time.  The apple butter in a squeeze bottle is very good.  Will try that on the toast next time."}
{"text":"I have always had good experiences here. Food great staff friendly and helpful. Healthy food! It's nice to go to a restaurant with so many tasty but healthy food options."}
{"text":"Great place to have a very filling breakfast.  Being from NJ, I never had grits so when I tried their Creamy Dreamy Grits-- I became a fan of grits..haha  Good food, good service  usually has a line and wait!"}
{"text":"The food tasted ok, but that was about the only thing It had going for it. Well, everything except for the biscuit, which was hard. If a place with Biscuit in the name can't get Biscuits right, there's a problem.   Service was incredibly bad. I'd expect better service at a Waffle House or a Truck Stop. Took forever to get anything from the Waitress.  The atmosphere was pretty much 100% pure hipster. I was expecting to see the wait staff roll up on a Segway wearing a Fedora.  The prices were a LOT higher than I would expect for what you get."}
{"text":"After a night of sickness from Mexican cuisine, my mother suggested I keep it organic and simple. In walks The Flying Biscuit Café suggestion.  The spot is trendy and cute with a sliding garage door to merge inside and outside seating. My mom and I dinned outside on the inexpensive chrome table and chair set.  It was adorable and reminded me of my Barbie set as a child.  Chicken Biscuit Pot Pie was my order and my mother went with eggs, sausage, and pasta.  My food wasn't bad, but it is not the pot pie your mother makes.  The food on my mom's plate was screaming try me, so I did and was surprised.  Everything was blended so well on her plate, but the taste was separate.  I tasted the eggs, pasta, sausage, and greens all separately even though it was on my fork and in my mouth at the same time.  Talk about an inability to marry ingredients. I sucked down two oversized cups of cherry soda, paid the bill and tip to the friendly server, and we left.  If you are looking for super-tasty food, I would not make this place your top pick.  But if you are looking for food that is organic, filling, and has a very different taste, I would pull out a chair and prepare yourself for a healthy meal courtesy of The Flying Biscuit Café."}
{"text":"Fantastic grits! I've worked my way through more than half of this menu, and I haven't been disappointed once.   Favorites: Southern Benedict, chicken pot pie, turkey hash, black bean cakes w/egg (perfect eggs I think it's called).   The wait can be rough on weekends, but it is completely worth it."}
{"text":"I have a friend who loves this place... My third visit, I just don't understand it. The chicken in my wrap was just terrible, I couldn't eat it. I wonder if it comes in pre-cooked? The only redeeming factor would have been the biscuit , however I never got my promised biscuit. Tried to flag down server, but it did not work. I hope I don't have to return."}
{"text":"The Flying Biscuit Cafe does what it does well.  My main objection is to what it does.  They put sugar on top of perfectly good biscuits, they put sugar in otherwise delicious grits, and then they serve only turkey bacon and chicken sausage.  Pork is the State Vice, for goodness sake, why serve breakfast meat that does not have pork in it?  The array of omelet and egg dishes is quite impressive.  I enjoyed the Piedmont omelet despite the pointless pork substitutes.  OTOH my wife's potatoes were lukewarm to cold, and her eggs definitely were not cooked as she ordered them.  The service was impeccable and the decor is adorable.  I can see why the place is so popular.  But their choices are not for me."}
{"text":"Since moving here, I've been on a mission to find the best breakfast/brunch spot.   The results:  Flying Biscuit is winning.  Everything I've had has been deeeelicious.  They have large portions, the service has always been fast and very friendly, and the price is perfect.  So, the food.  The biscuits (served with everything) are just an extra little bit of happiness to go along with your already perfect breakfast.  They go splendidly with whatever that delicious cranberry apple butter concoction is... oh, and the creamy, dreamy grits!  They really are creamy and I have had many dreams about them.    My favorite breakfast dishes are the egg-ceptional eggs (black bean cakes, verde salsa, feta, and sour cream with eggs) and the piedmont omelet (the goat cheese is just right)."}
{"text":"Great brunch. Waited in line to eat, but moved quickly. Biscuits and apple cranberry butter lived up to the hype. Prompt service, friendly staff and wonderful food. The original is the best."}
{"text":"AMAZING!!!!! The service was great, the food was sooooo good and it came out very fast. I had the chicken sausage gravy and biscuits with the potatoes. The food for the price is perfect!!!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this restaurant during our trip to Charlotte while looking for breakfast place.   We absolutely loved this place and were here twice on our 4 days trip. Staff was fantastic and we experienced some good southern hospitality. Our trip was 3 months ago and I'm already drooling thinking about how the food was. It was good.   Will defineltly will be back on our next trip back to Charlotte. Wish we had something similar in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Disappointed was how we felt this past Saturday morning after breakfast at the Flying Biscuit in Charlotte. Having frequented the original in mid-town Atlanta when we lived there and eaten my send-off breakfast at the Roswell location when I started my AT thru-hike I am a veteran of the establishment and the Charlotte location does not do the name justice. The biscuit was a heavy lump of dough - no 'flying' to it. The omelette was also flat - totally deflated. The pancake my husband was served was almost burnt on one side (the down side of course), it was replaced but honestly wasn't much better - dense and not very tasty. The grits were okay. Sorry, this is one place I would avoid."}
{"text":"I can't say enough about this awesome spot. I've been here a few times, but today was by far the best. Our server was Mike I believe. He had dark hair. He was absolutely amazing! So incredibly friendly, patient, and accommodating. I never felt rushed to order, eat my meal or leave. It was such a wonderful experience to just relax and not feel rushed. Thank you so much for the awesome service! This is about 40 minutes from my house but worth the trip! We will be back!"}
{"text":"I come here pretty often. The staff is very friendly and the breakfast is great. I'd give 5 stars but I've been disappointed with lunch and dinner.   If you are looking for a reliable and delicious breakfast place, this is a great option. If you want lunch of dinner, I'd recommend looking elsewhere."}
{"text":"Food and service were both good. We are from out of town and this was a better option then ihop or any of the chain restaurants. We came in from breakfast. The grits were amazing."}
{"text":"Slamming.  Definite satisfaction.  9.2-10 stars.  Waitstaff was great, biscuits with the apple butter.....  Classic.  Then a lot of options without the pig."}
{"text":"Disgusting. Southern eggs Benedict. Cold hard biscuit topped with ice cream size scoop of pimento cheese. Ice cold pimento cheese. Poached egg and A teaspoonful of hollandaise sauce. Asked for pork bacon received turkey bacon. Turkey bacon yuck. I would rather have strips of cardboard soaked in liquid smoke then turkey bacon."}
{"text":"My oatmeal Soysage and mimosa was excellent I come for the biscuits and was shocked to find out I had to pay for them at this location"}
{"text":"Amazing food!  I think they have the best grits that I have had. Creamy and smooth grits with just the right amount of seasoning. The biscuits just melt in your mouth. Awesome service and no wait on a Saturday morning."}
{"text":"The Shrimp and Grits is nowhere near an Award-winning Shrimp and Grits...it's liquid like Gerber baby food...the shrimp was good but over cooked...then the greens wasn't completely cooked...they where hard and crunchy...the water was amazing"}
{"text":"I am drafting this review as I sit at a table of six, enjoying fresh O.J. and the Awake blend of Tazo tea.  The atmosphere is perfect for a hungover Saturday, but we had been sitting for 20 minutes before we were asked for our order.  Forty-five minutes later, no sign of our food.  And the waitress is oddly quiet."}
{"text":"The only way these biscuits are going to fly is with a solid rocket booster. They were dense, gooey, and room temperature.  Not being mean here, but honest. I've had better frozen and canned biscuits.  The gravy had so much sage I felt like Thanksgiving had exploded in my mouth. I had hoped that other menu offerings lived up to the hype, but I got a resounding \"NO\" from my table mates. On the upside, the service was lightning fast. Our food appeared almost instantly, which tells me it was sitting in a chaffing dish waiting for us to walk in. I've heard wonderful things about this place for years, and we were SOOOOO disappointed. You'll get a better breakfast at McDonald's for fraction of the price."}
{"text":"Server Monique was awesome! I tried the Cola Barbeque Collard Green burrito. Much better than it sounds. The squished up macaroni and cheese baked into squares was strange. The biscuits were flavorless. My husband didn't care for the fried green tomato appetizer. The décor was colorful and fun. I am not sure that my children would eat here."}
{"text":"This was our first time at flying biscuit... and this is what I found mid-bite...hair embedded in my biscuit. Yuck."}
{"text":"Flying Biscuit is the best breakfast in Charlotte! The food is simple but really well prepared.  The ingredients are really high quality - super fresh eggs,  tasty local chicken sausage,  tender steak,  fluffy biscuits,  and the gold standard in grits.  I can't say enough good things about the Flying B! There is often a wait, but it is always worth it!"}
{"text":"Maybe I'm the anomaly, but I found the breakfast here to be ok at best. Everyone I asked about breakfast in Charlotte kept referring me here, so it had to be amazing, right? wrong.  The egg-ceptional eggs were... ok. There was nothing eggceptional about them. The highlight was the black bean cake with the tomatillo sauce. I found myself enjoying that more than the eggs. Even the coffee was just ok.   Sadly, just nothing wowed me like I was expecting this place to. Oh well."}
{"text":"Food was really good and they had vegetarian and vegan options. I had the tofu scramble and it was really good. The service was excellent and I'll definitely be back. A great day off treat."}
{"text":"Always quick, friendly, and providing quality dishes.   Service is usually on point in regards to refills, menu knowledge, speed, and overall attentiveness.   Food is consistently good. Especially as a vegetarian or vegan it's great to have quality options."}
{"text":"Who would have thought that you could serve such awful food and get away with it. We had the green tomato BLT - day old bacon and a greasy tomato on dry bread; the quesadilla wasn't any better, dry and poorly presented. But worst of all was the server had such long nails she could put the plates down properly, guess she was scared of breaking a nail - very unhygienic me thinks. Maybe breakfasts are better but avoid all else."}
{"text":"My first excellent experience with Flying Biscuit was in ATL. I was so excited when they came to Charlotte, and they didn't disappoint! The staff here is always friendly and the food is delicious.   The shrimp and grits are among my favorite anywhere! The grits are, in fact, creamy dreamy and the roasted red pepper and tomato sauce is delectable. YUM.  Awesome omelets. The turkey hash is amazing...the slow-roasted turkey pot roast melts in yer mouth! The biscuits (served with everything) are pretty good, but the Apple Butter will keep you coming back!"}
{"text":"Being from California, we were looking for something prominent to the region. This didn't disappoint. We tried out a variety of the menu from eggs, sausage gravy, the biscuits, potatoes, waffles, grits, and sausage. Very delicious and we look forward to trying it again in other areas!"}
{"text":"1. Definitely recommend trying if you haven't been there before. 2. The biscuit was not as good as I expected. Not really that fluffy. 3. Oatmeal pancake is good, just a little bit dry. 4. The portion is HUGE. If you have a small stomach the $11 you spend will give you three meals."}
{"text":"Super fun and relaxing setting! It was a nice little brunch spot, so many options on the menu that you couldn't go wrong with. The biscuits were good (a little too doughy for my liking), the potatoes were excellent along with the pumpkin spice mimosa (very sweet!). All around a great spot to grab some good food and relax"}
{"text":"Outstanding!! Came here for brunch, left a very happy person! The grits are incredible...a must have."}
{"text":"oh my. this place reminded me of our favorite brunch spot in San Fran. Let's start with the truly delicious cranberry apple butter and biscuit. The biscuit was big, fluffy and so good! The spread was fruity, a bit tangy and also surprising.  I ordered the Turkey Hash. (i just had to take a moment when remembering how life-changing this was). It was melted cheese over scrambled eggs over turkey roast over rosemary potatoes. holy kanoli - I want to go back. I maybe might have a new goal to find something equivalent in Houston.  The service was good, the environment was very laid back and the prices were great. My turkey hash was $9. My friend ordered the eggseptional eggs on black bean cakes. Hers was also very tasty. very, very impressed with this find and so glad my friend took me here."}
{"text":"We went here because the reviews, it seemed like a great spot. Went there once and will never go back. The service was fine, but the food... it was not good at all. They have a unique menu, but out of three of us, all ordering completely different stuff, nothing was good, at all. Food was very salty, greasy and heavy, yet not as tasty as you'd expect. Very dissappointing!"}
{"text":"After reading all the good reviews, my niece and I decided to try the location of Park Road. The service was very good and the place is happy and upbeat, but the food, especially the biscuits, which is their namesake, left a lot to be desired.  I ordered the biscuits eggs and gravy and it was unlike any biscuits and gravy I've ever had. The gravy was over powered with an onion powder or maybe actual onions or whatever.  I couldn't get past it. it was very thick, almost to the consistency of stuffing, and it tasted as Bad as it looked. The biscuits were hard and crumbly.  I'm not sure if that's how they're supposed to be, but I can't imagine that this place gets such rave reviews with those kind of biscuits.  It was just all so odd. They do have a very large and varied menu, so if I ever find myself there again, I'll certainly try a sandwich and skip the breakfast altogether.  My niece did not eat her biscuit at all after trying a bite of it, but did enjoy the rest of her meal."}
{"text":"Food was delicious! Grits were amazing and I'm not even a fan of grits.  The pancakes and french today had an amazing flavor!  Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I had th piedmont omelet at the flying biscuit, with grits, a biscuit, and apple butter.  It was very tasty. Service was very good, seeing that we were a party of almost thirty.  I will eat there again."}
{"text":"Literally waited over 30 mins for a salad. Disappointed because this place has a lot of good reviews from the friends."}
{"text":"I ordered the Mexican breakfast burrito and it was delicious! Could have passed on the side of moon dusted potatoes though, not sure what the hype was about there..."}
{"text":"I'm a Northerner.  We don't eat grits where I'm from, but Flying Biscuit changed that.  Their grits are phenomenal.  Breakfast all day.   It's my favorite meal and I can never figure out why more places don't offer this sort of thing.  Reasonably healthy menu options (even their bacon is turkey bacon).  Eclectic decor.  Fast and friendly service.  Moon dusted potatoes are OK, but not great.  They serve these or grits with just about everything on their menu.  Have some inventive menu options:  Coca-Cola BBQ salmon, various black bean dishes, BBQ chicken burritos, etc.  I visit this location or the one off of Rea Rd about once per month.  It's always good but never \"pick up the phone and call a friend\" good."}
{"text":"Had their Benny.  It was amazing! My husband had the French toast.  It was also really good.  The raspberry compote made the dish.  Biggest surprise...the fantastically creamy grits!  I chose to add syrup.  Great experience!"}
{"text":"Service was very good! She was super sweet. The food is almost excessively rich- it's the South! Go with the shrimp and grits! Wow! Clean and comfortable place. So much better than stopping of at a chain breakfast place."}
{"text":"Yes, it's a chain. You wouldn't know it, though, except that the ceiling tiles are screen printed instead of hand painted with winged biscuits and other such culinary literalisms. For some reason, that element makes the Charlotte locations smell of franchise. Otherwise, the interiors do a decent job pushing the pretense that the restaurant is in a converted bungalow near those of the original Biscuit in Atlanta's Candler Park, or that it is a hometown diner that has been there for years instead of doing business in Charlotte's newer and oldest shopping centers.  Lines form on weekend mornings with people salivating over the breakfast served all day on Fiestaware, especially the biscuits sprinkled with sugar and served with homemade cranberry apple butter. And those grits. Those creamy, dreamy grits that made this lifelong grits detester see the light at the end of the hominyless tunnel. Grits can and should be made with heavy cream. If they aren't, they aren't worth eating.  Lunch and dinner options are as tasty as those from the breakfast all day menu; many are altered with eggs or the lack thereof to make them appropriate for the time of day. Case in point: Egg-Ceptional Eggs and Love Cakes, both of which are in the Top Five Favorites dishes of this writer. Daily specials are posted on the boards outside, and are usually worth a try. Menu substitutions are easy, and so is the staff, which in general is pleasantly attentive.  Though it is not a Charlotte original, we'll claim it as our own, if only for those devilishly alluring grits.  Flying Biscuit has two Charlotte locations; one in Stonecrest Shopping Center at 7930-A Rea Road and the other in Park Road Shopping Center at 4241 Park Road."}
{"text":"While the food was respectable, the service was almost non-existent.  We were told we would be seating within 5 minutes and found ourselves sitting down 45 minutes later.  And, only when we complained.  Waited for ever to get waited on and good luck finding someone who would take our bill.  Nothing really great to say about this experience.  Two stars for just showing up!"}
{"text":"The French toast is dry, the greens were not good.  The biscuits are dry.  Also you get the feel the plates and silverware are not clean.  Sorry looks like a  hip place to eat but they need to work on the food."}
{"text":"The food was ok, the menu had nothing but turkey/chicken sausage on it, no beef or pork to be found. Our server was horrible and rude, he impatiently tried to rush us to order then rolled his eyes when we told him it was our first visit. By boyfriend had the grilled chicken wrap, and the tortilla was super hard. My biscuit was cold, and collard greens still had some unchewable stems on them. I wanted so badly to like this place, the place looked great, really laid back and fun. Due to the horrible service and mediocre food, I am sad to say I will not be returning."}
{"text":"When I moved from ATL to CLT in 2006, Flying Biscuit breakfast was one of the things I missed most about Atlanta.  This location on Park Road is, in my opinion, even better than the originals in Atlanta (perhaps I am simply desperate for a good Flying Biscuit here).  Great biscuits and gravy, super omelets.  Very easygoing host and waitresses.  These days, one of my primary considerations is whether the place is kid friendly.  This Flying Biscuit is very good with kids.  And you can take them to Park Road Books after you eat to let them pick out a book.  However, keep in mind that the wait can be long at peak breakfast time.  So if you have kids, come early!  (Or there are other breakfast places in this strip mall, like Cafe Charlotte - not that great but will do if your kids are freaking out and the line here is too long - or Caribou - at least you can get a coffee and some juice for your kids)."}
{"text":"Great breakfast, long wait but totally worth it. Down-home southern but organic options are awesome."}
{"text":"Although the menu advertises \"southern\" food there is no way these recipes are southern. If you like your biscuits really really dense with sugar on top and chicken gravy spread over them then you'll enjoy this oxymoron mix. Have never experienced in the south such a mixture of sugar and gravy. The chicken gravy was delicious but wasted on those biscuits. Also pay CLOSE attention to descriptions of their food. When they state creamy dreamy grits they really meant cream of wheat. So NOT southern. Guess their overall national success is based on the claim of southern and not the reality.   Service was good and friendly. No wait on a Friday evening. Eclectic environment. Prices are reasonable based on serving size if you enjoy their idea of southern.   Overall ashamed that people from other areas of the nation will consider this menu southern.  Before submitting this review did some research and found that Delia Champion founder and creator of those recipes grew up in New Jersey. If you want to try authentic southern food, visit Jestine's Kitchen in Charleston. So good there are no words."}
{"text":"I am a fan of Flying Biscuit! I have been here several times and have ordered both breakfast and dinner. I love the creamy grits served with breakfast. They are light, fluffy and full of buttery yumminess. I also love their tomato stoup (a cross between a soup and a stew). It has chopped onion pieces in it and lots of seasoning. It is by far the best tomato soup I've had in Charlotte. If I am feeling hungry but not sure what I'm in the mood for, I come here. It hits the spot every time."}
{"text":"Nothing special. I went for lunch on a weekday and the place was only half full yet they seemed short-staffed because 1) no one was at the front, so I wanted awhile before someone came and seated us, 2) all the waiters/waitresses were scrambling around with stoic looks on their faces with apparently no time to be friendly, 3) it took awhile for a waiter to come to our table. There was no friendly greeting, just a curt acknowledgement of my order and off she went. I think we exchanged less than 5 words the entire time.  Service was definitely lacking, and the food was equally disappointing. I miss the southern hospitality and delicious food of the Flying Biscuit in Atlanta.. At this Charlotte location, one side of my pancake was completely tough like cardboard. I tried, but I could only finish half my plate. Other reviewers seem to have had different experiences. Maybe they were having an off-day?"}
{"text":"The food was just okay, everything I ordered for breakfast came out room temperature, from the eggs to the biscuits. Although the butter for the biscuits was good, but the actual biscuit was cold, as a result, the butter did not melt. The candied bacon was also cold so all of the grease penetrated into the bacon causing it to taste like grease and maple syrup. More than likely I will not return here during my next visit to Charlotte."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service.  I have ordered take out for breakfast 6 times from this place and was always satisfied until today.  I ordered their biscuit benedict.  Instead of receiving the poached eggs, bacon, hollandaise, and pimento cheese like the menu describes.... I got scrambled eggs, gravy, and jam.  When I called Foodie Call (the delivery service I used for the take out order) to let them know I got the wrong order he was very helpful and said he would get the right order delivered to me.  He then calls back to tell me the manager said she checked the order herself and that I got the right thing.  I explained again what I received and how it was different from what I ordered!  2 hours after I originally ordered my breakfast I got what I ordered! And the flying biscuit cafe had the nerve to ask for the wrong order back!!!! We will never be patrons of the flying biscuit again.  I don't mind a mistake but to go back and forth with a customer when the restaurant is wrong is inexcusable!"}
{"text":"The flying biscuit is one of those places that you go to when you are in the mood for good southern food.  I have being to this restaurant a few times but it had always being for breakfast/brunch so this time my husband and I decided to go for dinner on a lazy Thursday night.  This day I was definitely in a comfort food mood, so I ordered the shrimp and grits and they were fantastic!  I love how creamy and luscious their grits are.  If you decide to order them, you won't be disappointed.  My husband ordered their version of a pot pie and it was very good.  Their biscuits are definitely to die for!"}
{"text":"I created this account to post my first ever Yelp review because that's how good The Flying Biscuit is! A friend and I were hungry and trying to decide what to have for lunch today. On a whim, we stumbled across The Flying Biscuit. It was almost empty aside from a handful of customers. I knew right away just from the eclectic decor that we were in for a treat. Our server's name was Claudia. She was very nice and friendly and had our orders out in less than ten minutes. Granted, we went early on a Friday afternoon but for what it's worth, our food was so good I wouldn't have minded having to wait during their busy hours. My friend ordered the Turkey Hash and I ordered Pasta, Sausage and Eggs. We fell in love with our food! Rarely am I ever able to find a place on my very first visit where everything is delicious. The portions are more than generous and reasonably priced. We both took home half of everything. I tried some of her hash. The turkey was tender and perfectly seasoned. I've already decided it's what I'm going to order on my next visit. I was initially wary of a dish that mixes penne pasta and scrambled eggs but oddly enough, the combination works. The flavors of the spinach and chicken sausage and cheese and mushrooms were well-balanced to where not one ingredient overpowered the others. But far and away the best part of my meal: the creamy dreamy grits. Oh my gosh the grits! I'm not exaggerating when I say they are THE best grits I've ever had in my entire life. They're like crack in a bowl! I don't eat grits that often but when I do order them, I usually have to add salt, pepper, and butter to taste. Not this time. They were incredible! It would be worth it just to order a big bowl of creamy dreamy grits. They were so smooth and they melt in your mouth. One other component of the meal: the biscuits of course were great...light and fluffy. I'm convinced they've kidnapped someone's grandmother and is holding her hostage in the kitchen and the only thing she's allowed to do is make biscuits all day. Claudia directed us to a squeeze bottle of apple butter on our table for our biscuits. I usually cannot stand apple butter. It's gross and I hate the taste of it. I feel like something with the word apple in the name should at least taste like apples. I guess because everything else was so delicious, I thought \"Why not?\" and decided to try it anyway. I can now say the only apple butter I will ever eat is The Flying Biscuit's. I got a small cup of it to go with the other half of my biscuit that I took home. I love going to restaurants with inventive menus that don't serve the typical fare that you can get anywhere else. The Flying Biscuit is now one of my new favorite places to eat, hands down. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The biscuits are okay, but everything else is phenomenal! I'm not even a huge grits person but they are amazing. I have no idea what they do to the grits to make them so good, but they are seriously the real deal. Service is fast (once you're seated) and breakfast is solid. But seriously, get the grits."}
{"text":"You are a breakfast restraunt. Learn how to cook an egg for gooness sakes. My eggs were brown and burned."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was great, the biscuits with the jam (I'm not a bread lover) was pretty good BUT do you know what turned me off...this dish I ordered that was supposed to be...I don't know what it was but it was eggs on the bottom with shredded beef on top. Least, to say complete turn off and I haven't been back since. The grits tasted like they were cooked in milk...wasn't a fan. I've had better brunch."}
{"text":"Great food as always. Sit in Travis' section! He's so nice and a great server."}
{"text":"The food made my mouth water like the Niagra Falls. The service was great!! I ordered half of their menu one time, and like a wild vulture from the African Plains, I devoured it all! After a while I took a 3pound crap at work and the bathroom was off limits  for  awhile. All in all, it was worth the brown volcano. Come here and try out all their great selections!!! This place is great!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times. This time I had the Southern scramble.  It was pretty good. But I think the biscuit was a little too large and a little less tasty than I had hoped.  The grits were wonderful.  The place has a nice atmosphere for casual dining, and the wait staff tonight was excellent.  By comparison, their are better places for eggs. The flying biscuit will probably not be a place I will frequent for breakfast food fir supper very often  But they are unique and when I want to have good grits it's where I would go."}
{"text":"Great restaurant love the atmosphere and the food. We go here every year and hope that can continue for awhile. Love the quirky decor and cannot forget the delicious apple butter and biscuits. Best time of the year is when you can get the pineapple upside down pancakes :) so yummy!"}
{"text":"Awesome!!! Yummy!!! Great variety and nice twist on Southern favorite!"}
{"text":"This is an awesome place for all things breakfast. Sat outside the last time I went and for Sunday brunch didn't have to wait too long. Nice patio seating and extremely friendly host. Our server was attentive and friendly as well. Had what I consider the best thing on the menu called eggceptional eggs. Delicious over medium eggs over scrumptious black bean cakes. Comes with a side of really tasty and creamy grits. Definitely a go to spot for breakfast/brunch. I always get a side of their Applewood smoked pork bacon, which is delicious. Pretty reasonable prices as well."}
{"text":"So my husband and I are vegetarian; my parents are not.  We are always on the lookout for places we can all eat together and be happy.  Flying Biscuit, with one location near my house and my dad's office (Park Rd.) and one location near my parents' house (Ballantyne), has thus far fit the bill.  It gets two stars just for achieving that feat alone.  It gets another star for the wide variety of its menu, which includes all-day breakfast foods (all of which look pretty great) and plenty of veg-friendly options.  It gets a fourth star because when I ate there, I was served pretty decent food.  I ordered the black bean quesadilla, which was gigantic and melty and beany and covered with a really delicious chipotle sauce.  I'm eager to dive into their breakfast menu next time I visit; the range of options alone gives me great hope.  I do not, however, believe that I'll be a regular here, maybe because it's a little too... commercial-y?  It tries desperately to affect a whimsical, authentic decor, but it's all a little too shiny for my taste, and underneath the whimsy, I detect the movements of a business desperate for more franchises.  Not that that's always bad.  But, you know."}
{"text":"Service is usually great! Guillermo is the best server----fast, pleasant and totally ok with your special orders! Although its a chain you are treated like you are at a local place. Everything is so delicious! Creamy dreamy grits, cranberry apple butter and the Meggxican wrap are my favs!"}
{"text":"The turkey sausage with grits, eggs, and biscuit are TDF!!! I get this almost once a week and the portion is so big I have plenty left over. My husband and kids fight over the leftovers!! Everything is delicious; even leftover. Sometimes I get two orders so I can bring more home. Still, they fight over every last morsel."}
{"text":"wow we did not know you could mess up pancakes.  The biscuits must have been made by Ellie Mae Clampett.  We have renamed this place now on our not to go ever list The Flying Brick.  The sweet tea was good."}
{"text":"Breakfast for dinner is always the right idea. Unfortunately tonight that proved to be the wrong decision. We have been to the Flying Biscuit many times before and have always enjoyed it. However, for a place that advertises \"breakfast served all day\" we were highly disappointed. Biscuits tasted as if they were held under a heat-lamp since the morning as did the moon dusted potatoes. Overall it just didn't taste fresh. Bummer.   On the way out we noticed they had an 88.5 score on their health inspection last week. Fare thee well Flying Biscuit. We'll be going to other fine establishments for our breakfast fix."}
{"text":"Simply put, my favorite place to eat breakfast in Charlotte. I always get the same thing, and that's the High Flyer. The eggs are perfectly cooked each time, and the oatmeal pancake with peaches and syrup? Yes.   My wife loves their grits, and we of course both enjoy the high rise biscuits (I, with copious amounts of the apple/cranberry butter). Recommended for a great breakfast spot."}
{"text":"Great place! Un restau super sympa. Proche de l'aéroport! Menu de petits déjeuners copieux, variés.  Une bonne adresse!"}
{"text":"Family is from around these parts and are just back visiting. Everyone raved about the grits (a little salty for my taste) but good. Food good and service very friendly. Would recommend."}
{"text":"I'm not sure where the biscuit is flying to but mine landed in my tummy.  It was good with the apple butter sauce.  The grits are the best ever.  I'll be back to this cafe for certain."}
{"text":"Sometimes I wish we could rate in 1/2 star increments, because the food and overall experience was a 3, while the server we had made it a 4.   Flying Biscuit is a chain, but has a nice homey feel with the murals on the walls and purple, and bright colored decor. It just screams \"neighborhood and family\".  When you have a restaurant with the word BISCUIT in the name, I'd expect a big flaky, moist biscuit with a buttery golden outside.  Instead, their biscuits are white and dense like Bisquick dollop biscuits. It's fine...but the redeeming factor is the cranberry-apple butter that comes in a squeeze bottle on your table.   I had the grits since THREE people recommended it to me-- and yes, it indeed buttery and cheesy and super seasoned and bursting with flavor.  Though it was so rich, I felt bloated and gross afterward.  I suggest using willpower to stop eating after your full...but it's hard since this dish is so mouth watering.  My husband got the fried green tomato sandwich which was delicious, but INSANELY rich with bacon and I believe cheese too.  It was too greasy for his taste, and too made him feel too bloated.   Our server was really great about keeping our ice teas coming, and any condiments we needed.  Overall, I'd come back again, but probably would order different items."}
{"text":"Service is friendly and attentive. The BBQ tofu burrito is the F'n Bomb! I'll def be back to try out their other vegan options. The bar is HIGH!"}
{"text":"The grits are worth the trip. Everything else is quality, but the grits are the real treat. We usually go there every other Sunday morning."}
{"text":"Great food, and the service is quick and attentive. I love the Biscuit Eggs and Gravy, but the biscuits by themselves are just ok. They aren't a traditional kind of southern biscuit, but still kind of good. The rest of the breakfast menu is amazing. And, a surprise menu option that's great is the fish tacos. Who would have thought this place would kill it wish some fish tacos!! The shrimp and Grits is also worth a try. Hell, it's all worth a try."}
{"text":"I think this place is overrated. Yes, the biscuits are to die for. They do have a lot of nice menu options and are considerate of different diets. But I think there is a lot of hype over this place because there aren't enough \"alternative\" diet restaurants in the area. If you have ever lived in Boone or Asheville, then you know that there are loads of \"alternative\" restaurants, constantly having to strive to be their best in order to compete. My family has gone to the flying biscuit every once in a while for years, and I don't think the menu has ever changed. Also, the place is way too small, the wait is generally way too long, the tables are cramped, and it is usually very noisy.   Also, either last year or the year before an employee was murdered by another employee in the kitchen. It made my stomach turn that they didn't move locations. It was also revealed that they hadn't bothered to run a background check on the murderer (who had a criminal record), so that didn't sit well with me either."}
{"text":"Underwhelmed. While the menu options were extensive, husband and I agreed our kid's chocolate chip pancakes were the best-tasting of our meals. Service was sub-par. Our waitress wasn't warm or welcoming, and the kid's food took a long time and was the last to come out (had to send our meals back to keep them warm while we waited).  Despite the long wait, the kid's order was wrong and our waitress was quick to blame the kitchen. Meh..."}
{"text":"So good! I had the black bean quesadilla and it was bomb! Great service and super cute environment. Good prices too!"}
{"text":"Our server was excellent. She explained the items and substitutions options perfectly. The southern eggs biscuit Benedict with chicken sausage was amazing. Eggs poached perfectly. The pimento cheese had just  hint of spice. I highly recommend it.  The grits were the best I have ever had. The were seasoned just right. This was the first time I've had grits out and didn't have to add something to them."}
{"text":"We came in a Friday afternoon , we didn't had lunch so we were starving. We had the Blackened Shrimp and Grits and Southern Benedict eggs on biscuit and potatoes. The cheese on the eggs Benedict was not melted all the way through. The potatoes came out cold and old , and we hate to think they were leftovers from breakfast ! The biscuits were cold and hard ..worst biscuits ever. You think when you name your restaurant biscuit they would be great! Totally disappointed with this place."}
{"text":"Excellent service and grits were super creamy.  I am not an expert in grits but I did like them. Had the southern scramble eggs. were not very fluffy nor did they have much collards. Biscuits were tasty and not too heavy."}
{"text":"Great food!  Their menu offers your good ole country food and also a lot of healthy food!  It's a win-win for everyone!  I went for lunch and had their Devils Burger (veggie burger with spicy stuff) and it was delish!  Also, their biscuits are comparable to the famous LoveLess Cafe in Nashville, TN!"}
{"text":"I am Australian and on the adventure of a lifetime in the Northern Hemisphere and have always been intrigued by southern cuisine. So during my stay in Charlotte I have been on a mission to sample everything southern I can get my hands on. Biscuits and Gravy oh my did I come to understand what all the fuss is about and grits too. I explained my southern food desire to the waiter who was more than happy to guide me in the right direction and serve me up a meal to remember. Highly highly highly recommended."}
{"text":"Very bland food and terrible service. Everything had a terrible after taste and tasted like it was sitting awhile. The waitress only checked in twice, to get my order and serve my food. Not the best breakfast place."}
{"text":"I'm into flying biscuit.  The tasty breakfast I had hit the spot and I can't wait to go back.  I enjoyed the Meggsxican wrap and a side of grits.  The meal also came with a fluffy biscuit and same cranberry apple butter.  Service was good, even though we had a large party.  The decor is very bright and cheery.  They have a nice patio out back which I highly recommend.  For most of the breakfast dishes you'll end up paying about $8-10.  Pretty reasonable for deliciousness."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with this place. Definitely worth the wait. I wish there were more locations around the city. :)"}
{"text":"We are visiting from out of town and stumbled across the Flying Biscuit Cafe. The food was reasonably priced and original. From the vegan love cakes to the shrimp and grits, from the salmon scramble to the gravy biscuit, it was all delicious. This place has a little something for everyone and is build on loads of personality!!"}
{"text":"Loved this place! The shrimp and grits were delicious. The service was speedy and very polite. The location was nice; surrounded by other nice shops and eateries and near the airport. Would definitely go again."}
{"text":"First off, the grits get an A+!!! Now, I also enjoyed the turkey hash. It was a flavorfest!!! And who'd have thunk it - it was tender, juicy and melt in your mouth good!"}
{"text":"This edition of Excited about Eating takes us to a \"Southern-inspired\" comfort food restaurant, The Flying Biscuit Cafe. Located in the Park Road area of Charlotte, this popular meeting spot features breakfast all day plus salads, sandwiches, and plate meals.  Dora here. Unlike last week's choice, I knew The Flying Biscuit Cafe would be a great experience. A couple weeks ago, we stopped here, but the crowd outside and the corresponding long wait deterred us. This week we strategically timed our visit, hoping to fall sometime after the breakfast crowd and before lunch. And, also unlike last week, our server seemed to really love her job. She was knowledgeable, helpful with suggestions, and stopped by our table several times to check on us and refill our drinks, always with a smile even though they were obviously super busy. Don't let the skinny exterior deceive you. This cafe goes a long ways back with another outdoor patio in the rear.  For a starter, we ordered a side of Grilled Macaroni and Cheese that Yelpers rave about. This mac and cheese is nothing like I have ever tasted. Rectangle blocks of mac and cheese grilled to perfection, somewhat crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Dora here. This alone was worth the drive. Fluffy, light, you don't really even taste the pasta. The texture comes off more like a souffle. HEAVENLY!  For my lunch (breakfast), I chose the Egg-Stravaganza. Two poached eggs, chicken sausage, turkey bacon, grits and whole wheat French toast topped with raspberry sauce and a honey cream. This dish was outstanding, eggs cooked to the exact time and consistency, grits were creamy and cheesy. The French toast wasn't overly egg-y or thick, almost tasted like pumpernickel bread, so I was surprised to find out it was actually wheat bread. Whatever the type, the sauce and cream were a great accompaniment.  Dora here. Y'all, check out the Very Berry Chicken Wrap. Doesn't it look refreshing? It was!! Great texture from the candied walnuts, fresh flavors, light on the raspberry vinaigrette, loaded with chunky chicken, delish! The perfect choice for a hot summer afternoon, I would definitely order this again. Maybe not the Garlic and Basil Mashed Potatoes because I prefer my taters a bit creamier.  What about you? How do you prefer your French Toast? Or not a fan at all? We'd love to know! Ernie and Dora Hiers, Fiction Faith & Foodies http://bit.ly/2sGP7Jj"}
{"text":"The service was great but unfortunatley me nor my husband liked the food. I got the egg-stravaganza. The grits were good but the french toast was dry and hard, the biscut was more like a scone. My husband had the meal that had the bean patty, sour cream, feta cheese and eggs over easy. With biscut and gravy(cant remember the name). The gravy tasted like stuffing and the main course had alot of flavor but they didnt complement eachother. The coffee was good. I will give this place another try. Ill just get somthing different."}
{"text":"Great breakfast! Biscuits with apple butter were delicious!!!! Smoked Salmon scramble was terrific."}
{"text":"After a tiny wait, we were seated in the back. This place might look small but it's huge! Adorably fun, kitschy decor with friendly service. I made a totally random plate of egg whites, fruit, potatoes and an oatmeal pancake. My mother got sausage gravy biscuits w/ eggs an grits. We need to talk about the grits. I mean, wow these things are fantastic! The biscuits are dusted with sugar that compliments them perfectly. The egg was perfect, fruit was fresh and th potatoes were delicious. My favorite part was the oatmeal pancake. The warm peach compote it came with was delicious as well. The cake is dense and chewy, sweet and filling. For it being extremely busy, our order came out quickly and without any error. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I just love this place. I'll wait 20 minutes I'm the cold to get a table inside and eat a good breakfast. I'm a simple girl - eggs, potatoes, grits, fruit. They ALWAYS deliver the best food with great flavor. I'm basically licking the plate when I'm done. The potatoes have herbs on them and it's so yummy! Of course, the food comes with a biscuit which is very unique to this restaurant. Very fresh and doughy. Mm-mm.  Staff is friendly and efficient so the wait moves quick."}
{"text":"This is my go to breakfast in Charlotte. I love the menu and I try to try something new all the time. My latest visit was lunch (Yay me, I tried something new!) and I got a sandwich with lettuce, bacon, cheese, tomato, delicious white sauce and egg on a whole wheat bun with a side of 3 grilled mac and cheese bites. Huge sandwich! Grilled Mac and cheese bites were so creamy, greasy and totally delicious.   Staff is always on point and food is consistent.  It's always packed, especially weekend mornings but the wait doesn't last long and there are a few tables outside that are sometimes available to sit at or watch other people eat their food.  I also recommend the Creamy grits, eggs, pancakes, and of course the famous biscuit!"}
{"text":"Made the weekly visit to the Biscuit. It seldom disappoints, but would have to say the sandwich special this evening just a C+. The \"California Chicken\" sandwich was good, just not special. It was as advertised... chicken with Swiss cheese, avocado, lettuce and tomato on a wheat bun... and that was it. Good, just not great. Had to add some Cholula to give it a little flavor. With all sauces to be had at such a culinary workshop, I expected a little more. Oh well, it won't stop us from going back."}
{"text":"My family and I went there .....several times. My husband had the sausage gravy over biscuits with grits and it was awesome!  Love the side of love dish too.  And our son is a big, big fan of the french toast sticks."}
{"text":"I can't believe I've been in Charlotte for two years and hadn't been here yet. I had the combo with the raspberry French toast. I was little skeptical when it came out looking like thinly sliced wheat toast with jam, but man was that amazing. The honey-vanilla glaze added a little extra oomph without being overly sweet.   I wasn't a fan of the biscuits. I think part of it was because they were so dense and everything else on my plate was so delicious.  I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This place does breakfast right. I haven't had a better biscuits and gravy and their grits were on point.  I really liked the different grits bowl options too."}
{"text":"Food was fantastic, server was great too. We ordered the fried green tomatoes and I wasn't horribly impressed with those, but my veggie omelet was great even after it was reheated! I'm surprised the biscuit I got wasn't good since that is their name, but overall cute place and I will be going back. Seriously though do not eat a biscuit without a drink... It's desert city."}
{"text":"Parking was easy and no wait for a table on a weekday morning. The decor is fun, and the employees were pleasant and attentive. My husband and I loved our omelets, great menu options for vegetarians. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I arrived at The Flying Biscuit Cafe at 7:30 to check out their breakfast. This place is so freaking cute. It is very colorful and it has just the right amount of things on the wall too look at. The interior is tastefully offbeat and a great way to start your morning.   I ordered the Egg-Stravaganza which included \"two eggs served with our chicken sausage, crisp turkey bacon, creamy dreamy grits, plus whole wheat French toast topped with homemade raspberry sauce and honey creme anglaise.\" So freaking good. My food came out very fast. Less than 5 minutes and everything was sitting in front of me. The creamy dreamy grits are no joke! They have a great amount of cheese in them and are truly creamy. There wasn't a single lump. French toast was very good and I loved the raspberry and honey creme sauce.  Don't forget to try the apple butter that is already set on the table. It goes great with the hot biscuits. Really great place. Can't wait to come back on my next visit to Charlotte."}
{"text":"Today's server wasn't observant or friendly. Instead of asking to take our order, he just said ok ladies first. First for what?   I ordered one of the specials for the week and it comes with a side. He didn't ask me what I wanted. After he took my bf order, I asked him doesn't my order come with a side? I guess he remembered it did so he named 3 I could have. This is not how FB rolls. My dish also came in wrap form that I didn't like so i just scooped it out and ate it. Our server made no mention of any specials, didn't refill our drinks,  and didn't ask us how was our food...even with the big wrap bread empty on the plate."}
{"text":"The menu is fun and creative. Service was horrible! My boyfriend and I went in for lunch. We were greeted with a disgruntled hostess/server. She showed us to a table, slammed the menus down and walked off. Five minutes later she came back to take our drink order. Mumbling and acting as if we were an inconvenience to her day. I have waited tables over the years. I couldn't believe her body language and attitude. I ordered the Southern Style Biscuit Benedict. It was delicious! The combination of pimento cheese, poached eggs, and hollandaise sauce was perfection. Much to my surprise, considering their name, the biscuit was very dry and hard. I was very hesitant to send it back considering our server's foul mood.The decor is fun and the location is great. I'm not sure if I would go back. There are just too many places in Charlotte that offers up similar fare with much better service."}
{"text":"Well, we have been here quite a few times and have liked it in the past. It's a cool place with great atmosphere and we have liked the food. However, we have noticed a decline in quality. You risk getting a biscuit that was made yesterday and hard as a rock. Today we got pancakes from who knows when. They were definitely not fresh, barely warm and stale...and 3 stale pancakes, 1 biscuit.... no sides $9.00!!!..where's the fun in that. On a plus side, they have the best grits."}
{"text":"One of the best breakfasts on the road I've ever had; hands down. Full dining room, but managed to squeeze into a seat at the breakfast bar. Ordered the shrimp scramble special, with the dreamy grits and biscuit.   I eat bug for breakfast, and this filled me up, along with the the speedy refills on coffee. Guillermo was working the bar like a top notch pro, and everyone was quickly tended to. My food was served in under 10 minutes. 3 eggs, shrimp, feta, turkey bacon, tomatoes, some kind of awesome salsa; yeah, this breakfast was the bomb.   Creamy dreamy grits and a biscuit are standard sides, but buy an extra dozen to take home for breakfast the next day. Apple butter in squeeze bottles on the bar...eat that stuff with a spoon if I had to.   If you are within 10 miles of this place and need breakfast, drive past the IHOP's and Denny's, and cruise on into the Flying Biscuit. Lots of parking, great atmosphere, attentive and well trained staff, oh....and the food is all that and then some."}
{"text":"Hands down best grits I've ever had in my entire life. Words can't even do them justice. Their biscuits are delicious as well- make sure to enjoy them with the apple butter spread on each table. A great brunch spot in Charlotte I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Been here about 4 times with friends out of their choosing. I've tried something different every time and have never been impressed. The salad was the best thing I had there and some of the spinach was wilted and old in it.  Like others said, the biscuits are awful. There are so many better breakfast spots in charlotte, and just go to bojangles for a good biscuit."}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Clean establishment.  French toast wheat is... strange. Chicken Sausage is made for pepper lovers.  Next time I'll try something else..."}
{"text":"This is a cute place, kitschy almost. That diner/down on the farm decor.  We came at an odd time, like 3 in the afternoon, and there were quite a few people there.  I was craving pancakes, so yay for breakfast all day!   The coffee was decent, nothing to write home about but not sludge.  My blueberry pancakes were on the sweet side as pancakes go.  Another nice thing was the advertised availability of local and natural offerings. Biscuits were... kind of hard.  That spoiled the mood a bit.  Considering the place is named for them.  Guess at an off time, we got off biscuits."}
{"text":"Would have given this place five stars if not for the biscuits. We visited on a busy Sunday but the service was quick and friendly. This was our first visit, based on a friend's recommendation, and we really liked the diverse choices on the breakfast menu. Eggs were cooked perfectly, I loved the moon dusted potatoes which I substituted for the creamy dreamy grits. My hubby had those and said they were as heavenly as described. I really enjoyed the eggs over black bean cakes with feta, tomatillo and sour cream. Would def order that again! Coffee was hot, fresh and good. Love the funky decor, it seemed like a popular local hangout. So...the biscuits? Well, we love us some good southern biscuits, and for a place with biscuit in the name, we were just disappointed. They were kinda sweet, and a little dry. Don't let that stop you though, overall a great breakfast find."}
{"text":"They should seriously market the sausage and gravy. You may hear chicken sausage but - good Lord this is some amazing sausage biscuits and gravy."}
{"text":"This place has great food and a nice atmosphere. Everything is very vibrant and colorful... And don't worry, there aren't really biscuits flying towards your head! I had the bacon and cheddar chicken sandwich. It had a good flavor and texture. The potatoes that came with it had a good combo of spices, but they could have been crispier. Tilapia was flaky and well cooked, and the shrimp had a nice zingy spice to it. Didn't try the grits as I don't care for them (it's a textural thing), but family members liked them- said they had a fair about of salt and garlic. Now for one of my favorite parts. One of their specialities is grilled mac& cheese, and it was really good! Had a good crisp with plenty of traditional mac&cheese flavor- you have to try it! Finally, what you've all been waiting for, THE  BISCUITS!  So , let's start with the inside. Fluffy, airy, soft, other various synonyms.. just pull off little pieces and let them melt in your mouth. Now the outside- crispy and crunch with the tops dusted with sugar! Yum! The sugar goes perfect with savory other foods like grits and potatoes. They offer apple butter which my family members liked, but I thought they were good as is. Next time I want to try their breakfast selection, but diffidently good for anytime of day! I'd give them 4 1/2 stars, only problem is that the seats were dirty and we had to wait for a little bit to be seated even though we got there early and they weren't busy."}
{"text":"AMAZING FOOD!!! The biscuits are melt in your mouth good and the service is great. I would highly recommend breakfast here!"}
{"text":"Great food, good prices, fast service. Everything was perfect. Always super busy on weekends, but not weekdays."}
{"text":"This place was somehow off my radar for a long time. I think maybe I assumed they were a breakfast only place, but they are breakfast and much more! The menu is quite expansive but not expensive, and everything sounded delicious. I ended up ordering their turkey meatloaf with mashed potatoes (real) and some of the best green beans I have ever had! Oh, and the meal comes with a biscuit with delicious pineapple jelly!  Service was excellent from Monique, and she was always there at just the right time with a drink refill and to check on me. I can't wait to go back and sample more of the menu."}
{"text":"I look forward coming to the Flying Biscuit while visiting Charlotte.  Their food is great and the service friendly.   Their specials are worth a try.  I was here for breakfast and ordered the Flying Biscuit breakfast.  Check out the breakfast menu as there is a variety of choices.   I have heard that the Fried Green Tomato BLT is very good and I plan on ordering it next time when in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Good for families and kids, but the whole wheat French Toast was like cardboard. I prefer biscuits that are more moist, and potatoes that are pan roasted so they are hot and crispy."}
{"text":"I LOVE breakfast food and thanks to yelpers posting pictures from this place, I knew I had to try it. I was in the mood for some biscuits and gravy so I ordered this, Got my eggs over easy and sub'd the grits for potatoes. An awesome portion of food and great presentation. I forked my first bite, watching the yolk spill over the biscuits and under the gravy. :) I'm a fan!  We went around 10am on a Sunday and they Just started a waiting list. I was the second but got seated in a minute. They have PLENTY of room. We sat in their back patio which I didn't even know they had. Very nice. Our service was wonderful. I can't wait to pay another visit."}
{"text":"Flying Biscuit Cafe is a favorite of my wife's, who goes there for lunch with work friends. We happened to be at the movies this afternoon and decided to stop over for an early dinner.  FBC is a great, feel-good meal spot - any meal! They serve some of the best biscuits in Charlotte - and that is really saying something. The salads are awesome - I had the BLT with goat cheese. The tomato basil soup was very hearty.   But the star here is the biscuit and apple butter. We were given more than enough to take a few home, thanks to the manager who waited on us.   High marks, across the board."}
{"text":"We had heard so many great things about Flying Biscuit, so when we got a Groupon for it, we had to try it.  Boy were we dissapointed.  We didn't have 1 good thing.  The fried green tomatoes were soggy and bland.  The Biscuits were by far the worst i've had at a commercial restaurant.  It was embarrasing, especially given the name of the place.  I had a dish (forgot the name) with potatoes, roast and eggs.  The potatoes were stale, and moderately cold.    We were so dissapointed since the place was very kid friendly and should have been a home run."}
{"text":"YUM YUM YUM! Came here during our visit to Charlotte and some fellow yelpers recommended it.... I am SO glad they did. We did have to wait 30 minutes because we went during Sunday brunch time, but it was totally worth the wait. I ordered the southern style biscuit benedict and it was perfect. It was a biscuit topped with pimento cheese, two poached eggs and bacon (they let you choose between regular or turkey). They top it with hollandaise sauce and garnish with fresh basil. FANTASTIC. Kind of wish they opened a location closer to me. The staff is also super friendly. Also, try their coffee porter, its really good."}
{"text":"Definitely my favorite breakfast spot in Charlotte! The Grits are AMAZING!"}
{"text":"What a fantastic place! Service is excellent and I tried the grits which I thought I would not like but O M G those dreamy and creamy grits are everything! Now i'm second guessing my life choices about grits.. do I like grits?? lol.. Amaze!!"}
{"text":"An awesome experience while visiting family.  80's music, tofu scramble, great coffee, and super efficient service and fun vibe.  My daughter got the EggStravaganza which is a great dish with a little bit of everything.  pro-tip: they sell their t-shirts."}
{"text":"Stopped by this morning for breakfast. Place was very slow, but considering it was after the weekday breakfast rush, it's understandable. I'm sure it's packed on the weekend. Ordered the High Flyer, which came with eggs, chicken sausage, grits and a biscuit. Also came with an oatmeal pancake on the side. Was surprised by the food. All this for $8.75...great price I thought. Grits were AWESOME and the biscuit was warm and soft. The pancake was a little dense for me, but had a good flavor in the couple bites I had. Service was attentive and cheerful. All and all a great meal and I recommend the joint."}
{"text":"Having never been to Flying Biscuit for anything other than breakfast, we decided to go for dinner this past weekend to see what else was on the organic/vegetarian menu.  It wasn't very crowded, and by the end of the meal, we could tell why.    The food was okay, but nothing to write home about.  I ordered the Fried Green Tomato BLT sandwich.  It sounded yummy!  What it was was three thin half dollar-sized slices of tomato on a rather bland hamburger bun.  I really didn't taste much of anything other than the bun and a smidge of goat cheese.  The cashew-jalapeno relish was delicious, but it all fell off.  It really should have featured at least a couple of big chunky tomato slices.  My partner's \"flat iron steak grilled to medium rare\"  included with his Steak and Eggs was pretty small and pretty medium well.    I guess we'll stick to breakfast time only at Flying Biscuit.  Maybe that's why they serve breakfast all day?"}
{"text":"Great place to take the family. Also, they have Kids Eat Free on Wednesday nights. We are happy to add this restaurant to our breakfast rotations. You have to get there early on Sunday in order to decrease your wait time.   My son ordered the French Toast and  when it came, I wasn't sure if he would eat it since it was clearly very whole grain. He scarfed it down in no time. The kids loved the hot chocolate too.  Nice addition to Charlotte. Glad they are here but wish they were a little closer!"}
{"text":"The Flying Biscuit is very much worth the wait (because waiting in line is the norm for this place). I have not met a plate that wasn't outstanding.  The staff is really good and the atmosphere is easy going. The Biscuit has great hotcakes, various egg dishes and killer sausage gravy. Run,jump, or fly to get there."}
{"text":"AMAZING! We came for Mothers Day and surprisingly didn't have to wait for a table. The atmosphere was cool and the food was delicious! I got the veggie scramble with fruit and it also comes with the classic biscuit (which is amazing with the apple butter). I got a side of the moon dusted potatoes as well which were seasoned so well! Other people at my table got the eggs Benedict which were apparently amazing. It was all amazing."}
{"text":"Very good breakfast but host asking people waiting in the cold to tell their server if they had coffee while waiting is a bit much - come on 5 cent coffee while you wait in the cold should be on the house - a big turn-off"}
{"text":"I was bringing my daughter to the airport from Durham. We met  my other daughter who lives in Charlotte for breakfast. The menu and the service was awesome! Very tasty!"}
{"text":"NOMnomNOMnomNOM.  This place is really popular and for good reason, so expect to wait for a table upon arrival.  It's really one of the few hipster places to get good quality breakfast food after sleeping in.  You'll have a hard time choosing what to eat cause everything sounds so good. To no surprise, it tastes even better than it sounds because you're very very hungry :)"}
{"text":"I come from a long line of breakfast lovers and inkeepers, so I am always on the hunt for a fulfilling, delicious, fresh breakfast. Honestly I'm always trying to find a replacement for my beloved Hobee's  in the SF Bay Area, with no avail.  Well Flying Biscuit is certainly popular in the QC and has a large number of tables.  As someone else put, it has a colorful and fun interior.   The menu has several egg options but for some reason or another I really only saw 1 or 2 I would eat. One time the veggie scramble was awesome, the last time it had a funky taste. Their Shrimp & Grits was 5/5 awesome because their \"creamy dreamy grits\" are appropriately named. I ate myself sick in fact. The first time I went I was so excited to see organic oatmeal pancakes with peaches, as I always make it a tradition to have Cracker Barrel's freestone peach pancakes after triathlons and I always try and eat organic. Alas, they were such a disappointment and I had to scrape off the nasty peaches. The Stud didn't believe me until he tried it.   That said, they totally redeemed themselves with their chocolate chip pancakes that are to DIE for- 5/5 perfectly fluffy but with a nice hard edge to them (trust me). Wow.  Their \"signature\" chicken sausage is really disappointing. We have Aidell's Chicken Apple sausage from Costco every weekend and Flying Biscuits' sausage can't even come close to comparing. Dry and meh.  Here's the confusing part- the biscuits, after which the restaurant is named is not the best part of the meal. They are indeed a bit hard (even at peak times) and they have a nice flavor but are definitely not soaked in lard so they tend to be a bit dry. They seem NOT to be southern style which is odd.   Eh?  Coffee is OK, OJ is OK, peach nectar is delish.  Service is average.  So as you can see, some things are GREAT, and some things are meh.  To people that don't have such high breakfast standards, it's probably great. To me, the search continues...  Tip: Check in on Foursquare and get free OJ or dessert."}
{"text":"A must for brunch in Charlotte. They are always good about gluten-free items. Only downside is there can be a wait on the weekends. The creamy dreamy grits are a must!  Favorite meal: Hollywood omelette."}
{"text":"Delicious brunch or lunch spot and I always love their featured cocktail, but don't come here if you're in a hurry. They are always packed on weekends and the service is slow."}
{"text":"The food is ok at best and extremely heavy don't waste your time hare and go to little spoon instead which is very close"}
{"text":"I recently discovered The Flying Biscuit Cafe through the ordering and food delivery service Foodie Call. I love trying new restaurants, and anybody that serves breakfast from morning til night is a winner in my book! That said however, just as a disclaimer: I've never actually been directly on location so I can't comment about their whereabouts, staff or service in general. I can however say anytime I've called ahead of ordering through Foodie to ask about any ingredients used, they have been more than willing to go look up anything I asked about, due to family food allergies.  As for their food though, everything I've had so far has been absolutely delicious! If you're looking for details on individual items, continue reading, otherwise, just stop here and know that The Flying Biscuit is great place to grab a good hot plate of food.   1) Their \"Spicy Shrimp Quesadilla\" is exactly as described, sauteed shrimp, white cheddar cheese, and lots of serrano peppers sandwiched in a flower tortilla. They don't scrimp on the shrimp or the peppers either, and when they say spicy they mean business!  2) The \"Blackened Tilapia\" is fresh tasting and seasoned well. It's usually served over their \"Creamy Dreamy Grits\" and topped with spicy herb marinara sauce. It comes with a side of spicy southern collard greens, which I've also ordered as a singular side dish. They're good, but not as spicy as I had expected, and not quite how I remember traditional greens being served, (a few too many stems) but a nice flavor just the same.  3) Their \"Egg-Stravaganza\" plate is great. You get two eggs any way you could enjoy them, chicken sausage, two slices of turkey bacon and their creamy dreamy grits. It also comes with a side of toast, and their homemade raspberry and honey creme anglaise sauces. The raspberry sauce is to die for, I mean really, it's that good! The eggs are always fresh, the chicken sausage while a bit of a different texture from the pork sausage that I'm used to is still spiced to perfection. They offer an option to substitute sides in and out on most of their menu items, so if turkey bacon isn't your thing you can always get pork bacon. Either way, it's a lot of food for one plate, and it's very filling.  4) The \"Pasta, Sausage and Eggs\" plate is probably an acquired taste, but I enjoyed it. You get three eggs, scrambled up with chicken sausage, spinach, mushrooms, penne pasta, covered in cheddar cheese and it's served with a side of their grits. The flavors of everything worked well together, but the texture was odd due to I'm assuming the grain of the penne pasta alongside the chicken sausage.  5) Their biscuits are always fluffy, and the apple butter they serve with it has a nice spice to it. 6) Their grits have a wonderful flavor and consistency, probably some of the best I've ever had from a restaurant. 7) Their seasonal fruit has always been fresh. 8) Their yogurt parfait with granola and strawberries is always a light and yummy treat.  9) The grilled macaroni and cheese is a favorite of everybody in my family, especially my daughter. I won't lie, those little crispy cheese edges are scrumptious. 10) Their blueberry pancakes are delicious, very fresh tasting, always fluffy. 11) Their \"Love Cakes\" were a little dry for my taste, but overall still pretty tasty.  12) Their Organic Oatmeal Pancakes are exactly what you think, oatmeal pancakes and it's our favorite item on the menu. They're topped with peach compote but we actually use the previously mentioned raspberry sauce on ours (or even the apple butter on occasion) and ask for the compote on the side, it makes for an amazing breakfast (or breakfast for dinner) and coupled with any of their various sides listed above, you seriously can't go wrong.  I look forward to trying more of their dishes, and continuing to enjoy all that I've had thus far. I was made aware about a month ago (May/June 2014) that they've been making some menu changes, so there are probably even more goodies at their actual locale to try, devour and deem delicious. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Best grits I've had at an establishment EVER. Omg...I can't even describe them. The biscuits are absolutely delicious and as far as entrees, trust me, get the Southern Scramble!"}
{"text":"I am breakfast and brunch super fan, and make sure to stop by anywhere that has excellent offerings. I stumbled upon flying biscuit years ago when I attended UF and they had a location over there. Through the years I have attended several locations in their home state of Georgia. I have had pleasurable dining experiences for the most part.  The location is Charlotte is conveniently in a nicer strip mall with plenty of parking. I came here just when they opened for a nice hot breakfast instead of paying for the hotel's ludicrous breakfast buffet. I had a coffee, which I did not enjoy. The roast is not great  I ordered the southern scramble with a whole wheat biscuit. As others have said, the biscuit had an overly flour taste that ruined my biscuit experience. The eggs were tasty but a bit salty. The best part of my breakfast were the grits.  Will return but may try something else."}
{"text":"A great add for Park Road Shopping Center. Free coffee on Sunday while you wait in the brunch line. Pretty good service. There is a patio for nice days, though not much of a view. The food is great... still not sure why the biscuits are the signature 'thing' but otherwise the menu is solid. Now they need to take one Uptown!"}
{"text":"Great place for brunch! I have been to the ones in Atlanta and loved it there too. I am not a fan of grits but the people I was with proclaimed them as \"the best damn grits\", so that must mean they're tasty! The biscuits were flaky and the apple butter on the table was delicious. Food came out quick and service was great! Would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Flying Biscuit is synonymous with brunch in queen city and for a good reason. Both times I have been here we've been lucky enough to not have to wait and have always been greeted with great service. One huge downside in my opinion, they don't have a liquor license. No Bloody's, Mimosas or spiked espressos here, folk. Unfortunately, I've forgotten this tidbit and have been disappointed upon arrival twice.  Moving on, the food is great and they have a menu that caters to those looking to indulge in an artery-clogging 3000 calorie meal and for those that are looking for something a little lighter. I love this mix of traditional and a little more out-of-box options.  Oatmeal pancakes were scrumptious. Fluffy and hearty but light enough that I didn't feel like I needed to be rolled out of the place. The creamy dreamy grits are appropriately named and the whole wheat french toast was impressive as well. The only thing I wasn't excited about were the moon dusted potatoes which are cubed too large and not crispy enough for my subjective taste.  Personally, I prefer the biscuits at Tupelo Honey.... yes, yes I know. But overall this place is A-Ok. Need to return and get the fried green tomato BLT soon!"}
{"text":"Woke up the afternoon after a road trip adventure craving brunch - late evening brunch... okay, hungover breakfast for dinner at 7:30 pm, whatever. Found the space deserted, but this was probably attributed to the dismal and chilly rain.   Our server was kind and attentive, but that wasn't enough to erase some of the not so cool cons: although the fried green tomato appetizer was delicious, it was ridiculously overpriced - 7 bones for 4 tomato slices? come again?; the Southern Scramble was more of a Southern trainwreck... soggy, slightly bitter and the turkey bacon bits looked suspiciously like, well, bacon bits; above all though, the \"Orange Scented French Toast\" was the ultimate abomination - forget that jive on the menu, this was two pieces of soggy wheat bread drizzled with raspberry preserves and vanilla syrup. Yum?  Everything tasted decent and it's always nice to be able to get breakfast day or night, I love the apple butter and the fact that I never leave Flying Biscuit feeling bloated or overstuffed. I can only hope the presentation and quality is a little smoother the next time I stop in. And that they won't be playing Nickelback this time either."}
{"text":"The food was great and the prices were reasonable! The wait staff was very friendly and efficient. The atmosphere is exciting and charming.  Looking forward to dining here again."}
{"text":"As far as a breakfast place can go this place reaches the peak of service and quality.   I came here with a friend to grab lunch at somewhere new because we normally go to Chick Fil A across the street. Being limited on time we need somewhere we can be in an out in half an hour.   I got there first after unsuccessfully navigating the parking lot (it can be confusing), and was seated in a booth near the back. The waitress came up and asked what I would like to drink. Knowing what we both wanted to eat I ordered our food as well.   I don't think it took 5 minutes to get our food. Right as my friend sat down it was coming out of the kitchen and being placed on the table. It was wonderful. I got the biscuits and gravy. It's chicken gravy, so I was a little hesitant, but the texture is that of sausage and it was very good! The biscuit is dense and you only really need one biscuit. I couldn't even finish that. You can get just the biscuit or you can get it with eggs and grits. The waitress kindly told me that they were big biscuits, so I just went with that and I'm glad she did.   Since I didn't see the biscuits and gravy on the menu I didn't know how much they cost, but I wasn't worried because they are not usually expensive. When I got the bill, I was surprised. Only $2.99! What a deal! Not only was it cheaper than Chick Fil A it was faster too! We will definitely be back here, I think this is our new lunch spot."}
{"text":"WHAT in the world was I thinking?!?!? And why did it take me so long to have their brunch?!?  My friend and I stopped in for a late brunch Sunday afternoon, we had a small wait for a table but I got VIP parking right on front of the restaurant so we just chatted and waited in the car until they called us in.   Not long after we were seated our waiter arrived, very pleasant smile and attitude it was like we were old friends. He took our drink orders and offered tons of suggestions. Based on previous reviews, I already knew what I wanted to try...the Pasta, Sausage, and Eggs which is three eggs with chicken sausage, penne pasta, spinach, and cheese...(thanks JJ! ) I decided to skip the mushrooms this visit but they normally come with this dish as well.  As I my side I decided to change the grits for the hash browns. My friend ordered the salmon scramble with grits and a side of bacon.  Even though, it was packed it took no time me my food was awesome!!!!   My food was delicious!!! The mix of pasta, chicken sausage and eggs was so unique I just loved it! Just an overall hearty and tasty dish. The hash browns were very tasty but my friend let me try her grits and I could have kicked myself for not ordering them!!! They really were creamy and dreamy!!! Sooo much better than I expected. I tried to keep my spoon out of her dish but I couldn't...next time TRUST that I will be getting the grits!!!  Fabulous meal, great service and just overall excellent experience! Loved it and can't wait to come back!!!"}
{"text":"I initially wanted to try out this restaurant because I thought the name of it was fun and I like biscuits. So I tried it out with my family. After enduring a very long wait, I thought that the wait must have been because the food was just that good. The restaurant is pretty cramped and while there is outdoor seating, it felt like it was understaffed. Rushing around and trying to keep up, created a very brisk and unfriendly service. As for the food, it was plain and predictable for a breakfast place. Nothing memorable and most disappointing of all, the biscuits were not that good. We have not gone back."}
{"text":"Came here with a girlfriend for brunch one Saturday.   Service = Friendly and quick. Hostess and waitress extremely friendly especially for 9:30 in the AM. Not crowded yet, but I hear at 10:30 it's packed so plan ahead. Decor = The place is fun and bright and a great way to start off your day.  Food = It was hard to pick from the menu since everything looked so scumpcious. I decided on Egg-straorindary breakfast with Eggs, potatoes, and Grits.   Grits = wow wow wow. Too good to be true. Never seem them like this, they are thick, but creamy, full of flavor. I would take any yankee who's hates on grits here to change their mind.  Eggs & potatoes = need more flavor.  Bisquit = An unexpected raspberry taste, quite interesting!  I'd come back and try another entree that included grits...yummm."}
{"text":"This place was packed on a Sunday morning before the Panthers game, but we were seated and got coffee right away! Our waiter was friendly and our food was quick and tasty! I always feel like a good sign at a restaurant is when you see regulars, and there were a ton here! I got a basic breakfast with eggs and their chicken sausage and I'd definitely have it again. I also got a big biscuit with my meal that was amazing.  They even offer you a to go drink which was a nice perk"}
{"text":"Can you say siriously delicious. I am new to the Charlotte area and I simply Googled best breakfasts is in Charlotte. This restaurant pop up and my experience there was unmatched to any other I encountered in Charlotte thus far. I had the Flying Biscuit Meal which included grits comma chicken sausage, and something from Heaven called oatmeal pancakes. At first glance it sounded questionable. I could not believe how good this was it was fantastic. The oatmeal pancakes tasted as if it had fruit or something in it it was more of a dessert then breakfast but actually made of oatmeal so you don't feel so guilty. The Great's were the best I had in Charlotte so far that includes every restaurant Uptown and in Midtown the warm Peaches on top of the pancakes made me want to cry. And the biscuits were just sick. Topped with an apple butter you could not believe it was this good. Of course bring an appetite and prepare to have a take-home box because the portions are huge. I could not possibly eat it all in one sitting but, I enjoyed eating it all the next day. This will be a go-to place for me as long as I reside in Charlotte. Best breakfast ever. The Grits are out of this world they won't tell me what's in it though."}
{"text":"This is a great little place in a great shopping center. We were seated on the back porch it was a little cold outside but the heaters on the porch kept things nice and toasty. My group had a variety of breakfast entrees from a vegetarian omelette to my eggs and sausage everything was delicious. Do NOT miss the biscuits there's a reason the place is named after them. The service is exceptional and they are very kid friendly. My niece and nephew love eating there. When you're done feeding your body walk down to the Park Road Bookstore and feed your mind (review coming)."}
{"text":"This was the best meal I've ever had on the road. I came in, was seated and had my food all within 15 minutes. Coffee was good and the staff was friendly and very well trained.   The grits. Oh my god the grits! No words just amazing.   The biscuits and gravy were perfect. I'm stuffed but cannot stop eating.   I'll be back next time (and every-time) I'm within an hours drive of this place."}
{"text":"Really cool little place. We've lived around the corner for 11 months now and just ate there for the first time this past weekend. Previous attempts falied due to the long wait, but this weekend we were up early enough to beat the crowd. The grits are the best I've ever had. Eggs and chicken sausage were also great, service was really friendly and the atmosphere is inviting. The only negative I will say is the starches are not their strength. I would stay away from items like french toast and the oatmeal pancakes. Those are really heavy and not what you expect. But I very much recommend the place stressing the grits, eggs and breakfast meats as their strengths."}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast! The Egg-Celtional eggs were so good, grits and biscuit were truly dreamy. Best breakfast in town."}
{"text":"I love going here for breakfast. I hate morning but sometimes my boyfriend will take me here to eat and it always is a great way to start my day. Quick service and delicious food. There is nothing you can go wrong with by ordering! Great place!"}
{"text":"We walked by this place and decided to pop in for some lunch. This place has a LOT of vegetarian options! I was kind of overwhelmed with all the options, so I just chose this: Vegan BBQ Burrito: BBQ tofu, collard greens, and mushrooms folded in a sun-dried tomato tortilla topped with salsa verde (for those not so vegan, sour cream available upon request). This was good, but dang, it was really spicy. I could barely eat it, it was so spicy. I got my 2 year old some fried mac-n-cheese, but she was in a bad mood and wouldn't eat it. I tried it, and it was good! I have to say, though, for a place that has \"biscuit\" in their name, the biscuit I tried was not that good. I would give this place another try, though."}
{"text":"Customer service at its best. The line was long but well worth the wait. When I got inside the bartender served me an awesome Bloody Mary and a wonderful buscuitsbenadict. To say the least I will be coming back it was quite the venture and I will gladly add this to my 2nd visit list with the family.   A+"}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place for brunch!  I got the steak and eggs with potatoes and I truly felt that I got the portion worth my money.  I appreciate how fast the food came and it tasted all so good.  The potatoes are to die for. I love potatoes and Flying Biscuits potatoes have the perfect seasoning and everything.  Definitely would go back for brunch next time!"}
{"text":"Some friends from out of town were visiting for the weekend and one of their special requests was a good breakfast place, so we brought them here.  At first glance over the menu I was a little nervous there wouldn't be enough variety for our group but I was relieved when everyone found something that appealed to them.  I ordered the sausage gravy and eggs and it was amazing!  The sausage gravy was just right, not too runny but not too thick, and packed with flavor.  It was served over an egg (cooked however you like) on top of a split biscuit.  Yum!  The meal comes with a side of grits but I got potatoes instead which weren't all that great.  The hubby ordered the cajun chicken omelet which was also quite tasty.  The service was a little on the slow side but it was extremely busy when we were there.  This might be my new favorite breakfast place in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Honestly who knew the Flying Biscuit had booze?  Awesome, what a bonus! The grits at Flying Biscuit are fantastic, they are creamy, dreamy delciousness, perfectly salted and loaded with fat. What more could a girl ask for? A great little neighborhood spot with an outdoor patio too!"}
{"text":"Some of the best breakfast food in Charlotte.  Absolutely love the Grits....  A must order even if you think you don't like grits.   You will once you have had these!"}
{"text":"Not my favorite in the world but I would go back and try something different. I was up for the challenge of going out of my element and ordered the Shrimp n grits. Not my fave but they didn't disappoint. Think I want to try the fried green tomatoes next time."}
{"text":"Great for brunch. I had the chicken sandwich and it was quite good. Biscuits are awesome. Others were raving about the Mexican wrap. After repeated visits, the Chicken Club wrap is really tasty.  Good for takeout, too."}
{"text":"Get the grits. You will have your socks blown off. Everything is good really loved the seasonal lemon poppy seed pancake but all is good"}
{"text":"Just left this restaurant  for the 1st time,on a rainy busy Saturday morning and I was impressed at the customer service and the quality of the food. My waiter was  really friendly and attentive. I ordered the piedmont omelet it was great. I love that this restaurant serves turkey bacon and chicken patties because I don't eat pork neither beef.  The restrooms were clean as well. I will return again whenever I'm in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Cozy little cafe in Park Road Shopping Plaza. Our waitress was awesome with our 16 month old... Even though he threw most of his food on the floor. The turkey meatloaf is loaded with flavor and the green beans were tasty. Ironically, the only thing that i found to be sub-par was the namesake... The biscuits. They were bland and didn't seem to be fresh made. Planning on going back again, especially on Wednesday nights for kid's night!"}
{"text":"I was sort of disappointed in this restaurant. Our food was ok but their biscuits were not as good as I remember they were at the original location in Atlanta. The oatmeal pancakes were not as delicious as the picture made them out to be but the sausage pasta was delicious. For that alone I shall give this place another try!"}
{"text":"no guys..... you don't have creamy dreamy grits! The benchmark is at Midnight Diner.  The omlet is weak, wt#! Compare yourself to The Original Pancake House......Biscuit is ok, I guess if you are carb monster.  With the mass invasion of Charlotte , all u have is location. Good luck with that."}
{"text":"Wow. This place must've been great at some point to get these reviews. However, it is not doing well now. The food was over cooked, they were out of biscuits (Ummm they're called flying biscuit) and gave my boyfriend old biscuits with his gravy. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"What's better than having breakfast served all day?? Maybe their apple cranberry butter smothered all over your fresh Flying Biscuit biscuit. Maybe. But that's a tough one.  Not only is this place great for their food, but the service is fast and friendly, and the prices are very affordable. I always have to make a stop here least once when I'm in town."}
{"text":"I'd been here once before with my dad when the place first opened. It was good then and just as good today. My wife and I stopped in at noon on a Tuesday and sat outside to enjoy the cool spring air. We were helped right away by our cheerful waitress and got started with beverages, etc.   I settled on the breakfast bowl but subbed the turkey bacon for the housemade chicken sausage. My wife ordered the high flyer breakfast. About 5 minutes later we were staring at some attractive looking breakfast dishes.   The bowl was a real knockout, the grits have been raved about and they are quite good. I enjoy grits made with milk and cheese that still retain the great corn flavor, Flying Biscuit does a nice job with these. The sausage comes buried under the fried green tomatoes and eggs so don't worry, it's in there. Speaking of which was very nice as well, good flavor, not greasy, maybe a bit salty for some. The tomatoes were actually my favorite part of the dish, cooked perfectly and the tartness helping to bite through the grits and sausage. Two over mediums on top were perfect as well. The red sauce was the only part of the dish I didn't jump up and down about, had a bit of a canned tomato sauce kind of thing going on. It was sparingly applied so no biggie. The biscuit was perfect for sopping up the grit, grease and yolk concoction at the bottom of the bowl!   My wife scarfed her entire meal down without much more than the occasional \"mmmm\" or \"good grits\" so I'll leave the review of that dish right there.   Quality food, good service, maybe slightly, slightly overpriced. We will be back to try lunch!"}
{"text":"This started out really good.  Me and my husband are visiting the Charlotte area for the weekend, our neice wanted to take us to one of her favorite resturants.  We had a really short wait, and our food came out fast, and was really good.  The biscuits were amazing.  The server was really nice and friendly.  Here is were the problem started.....my husband had watery grits, and sent them back, the 2nd bowl came out even more watery.  When the check came he asked them to remove the grits.  Well a few minutes later here comes the MOST RUDEST MANAGER EVER!!!!She proceeds to ask my husband \"What happened to the grits.\" My husband explained in a very nice way, that the grits were watery.  Erin the manager, starts to tell us there is no way those grits came out of there kitchen like that, and proceeds to tell us that he poured water into the grits.  My niece and husband explained again, that they came out this way, and furthermore what satisfaction would we get out of pouring water in grits.  She goes in on my husband, and he went back in on her, and things got WAY out of line, all over GRITS, AND her poor way of handling this.  I have worked in Customer Service, and the resturant business, for over 20 years, if she was a Manager at my store, she would be FIRED ASAP.  Lucky you don't work for me.  To the manager of this resturant Erin...if that's your real name...always Remember the 1st rule of customer service...\"The Customer is always Right.\" Sorry for the low rating, wanted to give a 5, but your \"Manager\" ruined that."}
{"text":"Wow! Did you read the name of this place? I mean, seriously? Why would you not come here? Yelp led me to this awesome place and it did not disappoint. The grits literally were \"creamy and dreamy\". Aaaaaaaand we won't even get started on them biscuits...... that I HAD to get a second order of once Guillermo told me about the cran-apple butter that I totally forgot to put on my first biscuit. So now you see why I HAD to order another one. I mean, it was my civic duty! Soooooooo, when in Charlotte, you must, must, MUST try The Flying Biscuit Cafe! It's your duty to save the biscuits!"}
{"text":"Ordered Southern Scramble... delicious!! Who'd a thunk collards, eggs and cheese go together? Grits were wonderful. Consider myself a connoisseur of grits. These are the \"slow cooked w milk\" variety. Yummm! My wife got the Egg-Stravaganza. French toast was out of this world good. Cooked perfectly w exactly the right amount of rasperry compote. Only knock on the whole experience was the service. Took forever to get our order taken, my ice tea was never refilled and the butter for my biscuit never showed up. Overall, still a \"do over\"!"}
{"text":"Great for a chain restaurant. The grits are creamy The biscuits are huge  Try the Southern Scramble and The Turkey hash and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"A Breakfast Perfect Storm...  Though there appeared to be a long wait, in actuality the wait was not bad at all, as my 2 peeps and I were able to get seated within 5min.  We sat outside at a table, the fans were def crucial due to the heat.  There also was a faint rotting garbage smell coming from somewhere nearby as well.    FOOD: Everything was EXCELLENT! Grits:  Yea, I know what you're thinking.  I've had grits before.  They're not that good.  How good can a bowl of grits be?  I had those same exact questions going through my mind as I was trying to place my order.  I'm gonna come right out and say it, do yourself a favor and get the grits -  these are the best grits I've ever had.  PERIOD.    Meggxican Wrap:  It contained, \"A spicy scramble of eggs, cheddar cheese, onions & Serrano peppers wrapped in a flour tortilla, topped with a warm tomato salsa and a dollup of sour cream served with creamy dreamy grits.\" (http://www.flyingbiscuit.com/Menus.aspx)  I added bacon to it, which I highly recommend.  The  Meggxican Wrap come together perfectly.  All of the ingredients perfectly complemented each other - the cheese complemented the eggs.  The bacon complemented the onions and peppers, and the warm tomato salsa spread across the top complemented the entire the dish. (see pics)  Biscuit:  Being from NY, I must admit, I am not a big Biscuit guy at all.  I prefer bagels and crouissants .  To me, biscuits are too doughy, dry out your mouth and are hard to swallow (that's what she said, lol).  But the biscuit was phenomenal!  It was baked perfectly, doughy but lite enough to swallow.  I can't comment on the apple butter - didn't try it; didn't need to.  The Biscuit was perfect with a little butter and jam.    My overall food experience here was AMAZING!  Everything was prefect.  I cannot shower the food with enough praises!  Everything tasted freshly cooked and prepared.  Everyone I was with also enjoyed their respective meals.  My friend got the Southern Scramble, which I sampled and can also offer my stamp of approval for.    Service:  Service was excellent.  Waitress was very polite & friendly but not intrusive.   She refilled our waters two or three times (hey, it was hot outside remember).  Food was not exactly lightening fast in arriving, but sometimes you don't mind waiting if you know the food is being freshly prepared.      Price:  VERY AFFORDABLE for the amount of food that you get.  You can also add extras and sides for minimal costs.   This place is definitely here to stay... ..and I'll def be Flying with the Biscuit again soon!"}
{"text":"Oh my yum. We checked out The Flying Biscuit during our latest trip to Charlotte. This place gets slammed- our group of 5 had to wait about 30 minutes for a table, but it was well worth the wait! The food was ahhhmazing. The menu is extensive and serves everything from healthy to hardy. I had biscuits and gravy, and I also tried the eggs Benedict. Both were absolutely delicious! The biscuits are huge, and all of the sides were really tasty. It was nap time after eating there! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times and I've never had a bad meal. Service is always quick, polite, and prompt. My go-to favorites are the salmon scramble and the Piedmont omelet. The Flying Biscuit uses chicken sausage & Turkey bacon in dishes. I don't feel that the lack of pork takes away from the taste. In fact, other flavors shine through without it. I always recommend this restaurant to people who have never been there."}
{"text":"This morning I decided to stop by the Flying Biscuit in the Park Rd shopping plaza for some brunch.  When entering, I immediately loved the decor...bright colors, some nice displays, old style pottery with sugar cubes at each table.  The waitress was extremely friendly and was extremely efficient.   The menu options were diverse and simple at the same time.  I ordered a grilled chicken wrap with 'moon dusted' potatoes.  Both items were delicious-- the rosemary and spices on the potatoes gave them a very unique and wonderful flavor.  Overall I was very pleased with the amount of food for the price, the atmosphere, and the taste of my brunch.  I would definitely go back to sample some of the other dishes!"}
{"text":"What a find, forgot about it being Mother's Day when we headed out to breakfast. Huge line but wait was much less than expected.  However the service was excellent only exceeded by the food. My cardiologist wouldn't approve but the best biscuits and gravy I've ever had and the grits were a 10 also.  Wish you were closer to California."}
{"text":"Lived in Atlanta for many years (home of Flying Biscuit) so we are very familiar with the restaurant. This location is exceptional. Service was extremely good. Food was prepared as requested and that was with a couple of requests (well done, add this etc). Best grits ever. Anyone who says the don't like grits needs to try these grits...if you don't like these grits then - fine you don't like grits. Chicken sausage is better than pork sausage. The biscuits are beautiful and so delish. I suggest adding serranos to your eggs!  I don't give 5 stars easily!"}
{"text":"I love this place since I'm not a fan of bacon but love breakfast.  Most places have no non-pork breakfast meats or probably cook them right after the bacon and sausage on the same equipment, but here pork is an afterthought that has to be specially requested.  My favorites are the Southern Scramble, the Turkeyloaf, Shrimp and Grits, and of course the biscuit itself (smothered in the apple butter)  Service has been a bit off the past couple times I've been and I pretty much had to blurt out my food order.  If it takes you several minutes to get my drink order I assume I won't see you for several more minutes for my food order."}
{"text":"The food is great, let me repeat... food is great. You just have to be prepared for the wait. If you go there on a Sunday morning, after a night of fun, don't expect to sit quickly or have service right away. However, the biscuits make up for the time spent in the parking lot of the Park Road Shopping Center -I could never work there because I would eat my weight in biscuits daily."}
{"text":"Best breakfast place in Charlotte hands down. Some favorites include- Flying biscuit breakfast- eggs any way, meat, creamy dreamy grits Turkey hash and gravy Eggs-strordinary breakfast with creamy dreamy grits.  Whatever you order get the creamy dreamy grits!!!!"}
{"text":"What a disappointing visit I had this morning. I had high hopes for this place as it was recommended to me by a co-worker. We arrived around 9:45 am, had about a 30 min wait for a table (which is to be expected for a Sunday morning). After being seated our waitress quickly took our drink orders but after that we didn't receive our drinks for another 15 mins. After waiting an hour for a food it was served to us cold and I was given the wrong order. Normally I would not make a fuss about a wrong order but the food given to me contained items I was allergic too. Now having to get my meal replaced I had to wait another 30 mins for my meal. By this time it's 12:00pm and I am starving. Overall I did not have a good experience at this establishment and probably will not be returning. The only reason I am giving them 3 stars instead of 2 is because our waitress was extremely helpful, informative, and tried her hardest to make sure the meal was right the second time."}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast place.  The French toast is my favorite.  I am now gluten free and still go for breakfast.  Great menu."}
{"text":"This place has the best grits! My boyfriend gets the sausage gravy whenever we go and I like to mix it up. He is obsessed and he's from Mississippi, he knows his grits and sausage and gravy ha. Everything has been awesome and the waiters are so nice! I don't think I have ever ordered lunch here but I think I'm going to do that next time!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places. Their Shrimp & Grits are to die for. Definitely my last meal if I had to choose one. Their biscuits are fluffy and have sugar on top which adds a slight sweetness that is great. Breakfast is amazing here too."}
{"text":"Why are the biscuits here so hard? I have never met a biscuit I didn't like until eating at this flying biscuits. Other flying biscuits I have been too didn't have this problem, but this location puts something on their biscuits that makes the outside really hard. I always just pick out the middle like a squirrel. The other food options are ok but I just can't get past the fact that at a place called flying biscuit most tables I see them bus the customers have not eaten their biscuits. The grits are very good though."}
{"text":"During a weekend with the girls in charlotte, we found ourselves starving and craving breakfast at 2PM. Thanks to Yelp we found The Flying Biscuit Café and we agreed we had to go! We arrived to a packed house but the patio was open and there was a table wide open. We sat down quickly and we all had one thing on our mind... biscuits!  I wasn't long before our fabulous waitress Marissa eagerly greeted us. She put in our waters and coffee all around. Good friends, good weather, good waitress, we were definitely winning the day at this point.   I ordered the The High Flyer Breakfast. This was a huge meal and came with two eggs, chicken sausage (I got vegetarian!!), grits, and an oatmeal pancake with peaches... oh and a biscuit! I'm not kidding, this was so much freakin' food. While I tried, I did not succeed at cleaning my plate. I started with the biscuit and I must say, it was great. Fluffy, soft on the inside a little crust on the outside, everything you think of when you imagine a great biscuit. I added a little butter and this house made jam that was on the table. I always expect a lot out of a menu item that's I the name of the business and in this case, I approve! My eggs were also cooked perfectly, the vegetarian sausages were great, and I was surprised by the grits. I'm not a huge grits person but they were pretty damn tasty. I dove into the pancake last and I gotta say that I was not a fan. It was very tough and instead of enjoying it, I was caught red handed nibbling on my friend's original pancake. Now, that was a good pancake!   Overall, my party had a great time here and I would recommend it to anyone visiting or living near by. If you're lucky you'll snag Marissa as your waitress.!"}
{"text":"Enough cannot be said about this place. The crowd says it all. Well worth a little wait. The grits are by far the best I have ever eaten. The staff, the service , the atmosphere, and food are all 5 star and perfectly priced. Next time we are in town we will be back."}
{"text":"I needed a good breakfast place to take my folks when they were in town - one that's not too pricey, so I settled on Flying Biscuit early on a Sunday hoping we'd miss the line.  We showed up at 9am and were easily able to get a table for 6.  I ordered the French Toast however, and it was ... different.  When I imagine French Toast, I think big, fluffy, flavorful bread with some hints of cinnamon, maybe some nutmeg.  The French Toast that I got was soggy wheat bread with some delicious raspberry glaze over it - which was the saving grace.  Without the raspberry sauce,  I would have been a very unhappy camper.    When we left around 10am, there was a long line and they won't sit you unless your entire party is there.  I'm not sure that I'll be back anytime soon - too many other breakfast/brunch places to try."}
{"text":"Southern style breakfast all day? What more could you want? I had the pleasure of having breakfast for dinner here. The atmosphere feels cozy and a homey feel to it.  Now the menu. Filled with lots of yummy options! I love a menu with lots of choices! Pimento cheese and fried green tomatoes were our appetizers and they did not upset. Somehow I went my whole life with trying fried green tomatoes and now I'm craving Flying Biscuit's tomatoes!  For my main dish I ordered the Cajun chicken scramble. Mmmm it was so good with the right amount of spice! Ofcourse i had their famous grits and it did not disappoint, creamy and made perfectly.  Can't wait to come back to try some dinner items!"}
{"text":"The oatmeal pancakes with the peach capote are wonderful. My grandmother use to make oatmeal pancakes with peach capote (and strawberry capote & plum capote). That dear lady died 25 years ago, but eating the oatmeal pancakes here took me back to my childhood in east Texas.  The grits are fantastic and the biscuits may be the best I've ever tasted. I live in Dallas but occasionally travel to CLT for business, and every trip has at least one meal here."}
{"text":"Simply put: THE FOOD WAS AMAZING! The Black Bean Cakes were surprisingly delicious and HEALTHY (I assume) I immensely enjoyed the southern atmosphere! Great Food and People  Great Sunday Brunch destination"}
{"text":"We went to the Biscuit Cafe at 8 pm on a Saturday night. They were welcoming and more than happy to serve a family of six. We had two adults and four kids. It was completely empty but super yummy so don't let that fool you!   We had the Lemon Poppyseed pancakes (special), a full size French toast, the Breakfast bowl, a Chorizo wrap, and chocolate chip pancakes.   All the pancakes were really good. Crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. Flavor was so good.   The French toast was a bit small. Only two pieces of toast cut in half for the full size. And not as good as the pancakes.  Definitely not enough for a full size teen or adult.   The breakfast bowl was so good. The grits were the best I have ever had. (I'm from Arizona, but I am a big fan of grits.)   And don't get me started on the biscuits. The best biscuits ever. Huge and fluffy and great with the apple butter."}
{"text":"I'm mad...mad at myself for not coming here sooner. Living about 5 minutes away, I come to Park Road shopping center a lot. This is arguably overall, the best restaurant in the entire complex. The breakfast is awesome and the biscuits while not truly a traditional, southern style biscuit, are f'ing great. Every single traditional breakfast item is so so so so good. Turkey bacon...yep, chicken sausage...don't sleep on it, grits...some of the best I've ever had, which means a lot coming from an SC native. 5/5 because service was awesome, mimosas were great, and of course the meal was outstanding."}
{"text":"I rarely give chain restaurants 5 stars (FB was founded in ATL in 1993); however, this location continually  serves a hearty breakfast with warm smiles, hot coffee, and excellent service.  Kudos to Markisha for her joy of life, and to Bob (the hostess outside with the mustache) for his happiness even when slammed.  I know others might ding them on certain entrees, which I cannot comment since I eat only breakfast here, but the variety of their morning menu has never let me down.  Should I get the Southern Scramble, or the Smoked Salmon scramble, or The Piedmont omelet?  Hmmmm.  They're all so good."}
{"text":"What a great find!!!!  Everything was delicious.  Best grits I've ever had, turkey gravy amazing!!!!  Pot roast and eggs fantastic.  Yes we tried a little of everything!!! We will definitely be regulars!!!!"}
{"text":"Went back on 10/26/12....still a great place for breakfast.    However, I was a little surprised that at 10AM there was a small group drinking beer and at times being a little loud and using profanity.  They appeared to be from a local hospital or medical center that just worked mids.  I expect this type of crowd at your local bar, not a breakfast place.   Next time I'm in the area I'll go back for some more great tasting biscuits, and hope the medical crowd has moved along."}
{"text":"I have had breakfast at a Flying Biscuit before, but this was my first time for dinner. I had UberEATS deliver a chicken pot pie and salad. OMG! The chicken was tender and plentiful! The gravy was a tad spicy and delicious! The veggies were crisp, and the biscuit topping the pot pie was flaky, crusty, and tender on the inside! Best cold-weather food EVER!"}
{"text":"This place has a really great hot chocolate. Sweet and creamy with a smooth finish. Really a great place to meet a new friend or catch up with someone. I didn't try any of the food."}
{"text":"Meh.   I had to waive down someone to take my drink order. She informed me that she would go get my actual server, and when someone came over it was a different girl that informed us that she was not our server but she would take my drink order anyway.  She brought our drinks and took our order.  Someone else brought the food too.  Our \"server\" didn't show up until it was time for the check. -_-  We came because a friend recommended it, said the grits were amazing. They were good, but not as good as the Leroy Fox! The biscuit was good, I would've like to have been offered something to slather on it, like a jelly or jam. I just ended up putting my eggs on it."}
{"text":"Awesome apple butter & biscuits!!!! Service is a tad unorganized compared to pancake house. But again, the Apple butter and biscuits are phenom!!"}
{"text":"I went for lunch and had a pleasant experience.  Although this is a small, regional chain the eclectic interior makes you feel like you are in an independent cafe.  Odd location deep inline in the shopping center with a very small sign so keep your eyes open.  I ordered the 3b grilled chicken sandwich with roasted potatoes and was very happy.  The aioli and blue cheese mixed well, although I think there could have been a little more blue cheese.  The turkey bacon had a nice flavor (for turkey bacon) and added some crunch to the sandwich.  The chicken was done well and still moist.  The bun, lettuce, and tomato were good compliments.  Service and atmosphere were average.  If you are close by, Flying Biscuit is worth a chance."}
{"text":"This place is always packed on the weekends. I've heard the buzz, passed up a few opportunities to try it until last weekend.   In the mood to stand in line, we waited only 15 minutes - not too bad with the amount of people gathered out front. Got a table on the back porch and loved the breeze.   Whether it was the amount of people in the restaurant or poor service, our waitress was running all over the place and not paying much attention to us.   Food was decent at best. Grits were creamy as advertised and were the bright spot of an otherwise forgettable meal.   Don't understand the hype, Still on the lookout for a great breakfast place in CLT."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!! The service was great too! There was nothing that anyone at my table didn't enjoy. The mocha is beautiful, sweet & addictive. My meggixican burrito served with creamy dreamy grits and a biscuit was DELICIOUS!  The biscuits are huge and the grits are out of this world! Wish I could make my own grits just like that! This is definitely a place to enjoy, but be ready to wait... For an amazing breakfast experience!"}
{"text":"I was not impressed by the food; however, I was very impressed with the fun decor. They have done a great job with the ceiling tiles! Lots of color, lots of fun scenes of utensils or animals and clouds...fun table settings and accessories. The atmosphere is very colorful and will possibly overload your senses.   The food was less than good and frankly, disappointed us. I had heard good things about this place and was eager to see how vegetarian-friendly it was. They do offer veggie friendly entrees, but it is by no means a vegetarian establishment. They LOVE their sausages and bacon! I wanted to try something Southern, so I tried the grits and biscuits (thinking they are their signature items). Coming from the West, grits are very foreign to me. Their grits were thick and tasted like they were made with sour cream. I was not a fan. When I think biscuits, I think \"plain, nothing fancy.\" Their biscuits have crystallized sugar on top. I know I highlighted two items, but we ordered more. I'm not going to review everything, since it was so disappointing and didn't make us feel good (not that we felt bad, but when I eat, I like to feel good about it).   Since it was the opening weekend, I expected high energy and enthusiasm. The server was great, but the manager or whoever that stopped by to check on us wasn't what I had expected for a grand opening. Not friendly, but not not friendly...just checking on us.   So, sad to say, this is not a stop we'll be making again."}
{"text":"This is a great place and one of my favorites. Food is wonderful. But, after last Thursday breakfast with my husband I don't know what to think. The music was inappropriate with all the sexual content and comment. I have never been so offended by something and its probably okay in a club. Not a eatery."}
{"text":"Not as outstanding as reviews led me to believe but so much better for breakfast than something like iHop or Denny's."}
{"text":"This is a brunch stand by. The interior & offerings are similar to a joint in SoMa or in the Castro district in San Francisco - hippie chic.    I love the white cheddar grits.  The other fare provides twists on standards like chocolate chip or buckwheat pancakes.  There are the standards like the 2 or 3 egg plate w/potatoes & fruit or grits. How can you go wrong w/brunch all day!  Need gluten free or vegetarian w/ease - the Flying Biscuit is the place."}
{"text":"SERVICE excellent FOOD Excellent  Will be coming back Kelly was the server and I really enjoyed  her.."}
{"text":"I very much enjoyed my meal here, the food was quite good, and the friendly, funny staff made it even better.  Located at Park Road Shopping Center (if you look towards the middle of the strip, it will be slightly to the right of center, in close proximity to Suarez Bakery), what a fun, cute place for a meal.  Park Road SC is currently redoing their signage, so it's a little more difficult to spot a new-to-me place, but the banner signs are readable.   There is parallel parking just in front of the stores, or there is plenty of angled parking in the lot.  The place:  Cute space with both booths and tables/chairs, along with a small bar.  Brightly colored Hawaiianish table cloths make for a happy environment.  The staff:  Ridiculously friendly and knowledgeable of the menu.  When I asked the waitress for what her favorites were, as I had never been to a Flying Biscuit before, she gave me some suggestions with explanations.  Awesome!  The food:  I took the waitress's suggestion and ordered the High Flyer, which offers a sampling of everything - 2 eggs, grits, chicken sausage and a pancake.  I substituted a blueberry pancake for the oatmeal pancake, which I ate with only the light dusting of powdered sugar that it was served with, and it was delicious - light and full of blueberry flavor.  The eggs were cooked to my over-well request and were very good, not greasy at all, with the perfect crispness that I like.  The grits were indeed creamy and dreamy and probably the best grits I have ever eaten.  The chicken sausage was well flavored and cooked to perfection (I wasn't a huge fan of it, but I think that is my personal taste and not a reflection of the sausage).  And the biscuit... well... again, I wasn't a fan.  For the type of biscuit that it was, it was well flavored and structured, with a little sugar baked on top for a sweet, slightly crunchy finish, but I like lighter, biscuitier biscuits (Cracker Barrel, Poogan's Porch in Charleston), but they were good.  The accompaniment of the cranberry apple butter in a squeeze bottle was amazing - that was delicious and I could have eaten that right from the bottle - YUM!!  We also tried the grilled mac and cheese which are molded rectangles of mac and cheese.  $3 for 3 rectangles - it was mac and cheesy (good to cure a macheese craving, nothing spectacular).  Wednesday, as the cute young man told me when I entered, is kid's night.  I don't know what kid's night entails, but there will be squealing children and wincing mommies getting glass after glass of wine.  The food was a solid 4 and with the addition of the awesome staff, I am rounding up to a 5."}
{"text":"Great service! I love coming here for breakfast and eating outside on the patio with my dog."}
{"text":"This is a great spot to meet a friend for breakfast or brunch and I mean A (one) friend. The restaurant works hard to pack larger parties into the tight space but that's really not their target market. Cafes are typically quaint, smaller tables, intimate atmospheres... The Flying Biscuit, somewhat, desired that feel but didn't quite hit it. Their biscuits became to popular.  Now, by biscuits, I don't mean the kind you want to grab with grease covered chicken fingers. These biscuits are sweeter, a little more dense and have a dusting of sugar on top. Almost more sourdough in texture but not exactly. Delicious, paired with the right breakfast accompaniments but don't expect Bojangles.  The service is fairly quick considering the small space, large groups, issue. I think my friend were in and out within 30 minutes, maybe less. Honestly, we would have sat around a while but we didn't want to hold up a table.  If I could pick a home town for this cafe, it would be Asheville. If you haven't been to Asheville, it's a smallish city with some hippie vibe but surrounded by money. Kind of an odd collection of people but totally unique. That is somewhat how I feel about the menu at Flying Biscuit, too. Some, not so traditional, breakfast items mixed with some more common ones. More expensive than an IHOP but the restaurant wanted a different, unique vibe. Peas in a pod, really."}
{"text":"There are so many good things on the menu here but I keep getting my standard (even for dinner): eggs, biscuit and gravy."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I visited this place for breakfast based on Yelp reviews.  Bad idea.  Our waiter offered drinks and took our orders shortly aftee.While waiting for our food I was on my phone and the clock said 12:08 pm.Our food came to our table at 12:12 pm.It took 4 minutes to make 1 order of bacon,eggs,grits and a biscuit plus 1 order of French toast,bacon,eggs,grits and a biscuit.Needless to say we were incredibly surprised (and suspicious) by how quick our food was ready.  Once we started eating we were left disappointed by how bland the food was.The bacon reminded me of bacon at a hospital cafeteria and the grits were ok at best.His French toast was two very,very thin and extremely soggy pieces of toast with raspberry sauce drizzled on top.The eggs were also tasteless.Oh,and our waiter never checked in with us once our food arrived at our table.My fiancé said theirs better breakfast at McDonald's.I know it's hard to believe that last statement but honestly,this place is nothing special.What a waste of time and money..  If you want a good plate of food,go elsewhere.I only give this place one star because the biscuit was pretty good.However,we won't be visiting again."}
{"text":"The hunt for the best brunch in Charlotte led me to the Flying Biscuit Cafe. I've heard of their legendary biscuits and needed to give this place a try. My experience was unfortunately not the best. This is probably due to getting take-out instead of actually eating at the cafe. I had the biscuit, eggs and gravy. By the time I got home, the biscuit was a bit on the hard side which is contrary to the warm, soft, flaky goodness I was expecting. I have to give this place 3 stars for now. The $10 didn't really seem to be a good value in my opinion. I'll give The Flying Biscuit another try in a couple of weeks however and see how it measures up for dine-in."}
{"text":"Good place for the health conscious.  The male host was a little rude to my mother when she walked into the establishment to wait. (It was hot outside). He abruptly told her they do not allow anyone to wait inside. Other than that the place has cool atmosphere and good food."}
{"text":"First visit to Flying Biscuit Cafe. Did not notice this eatery, so easy to walk by this place if it were not for the tables outside and a menu board. We walked in and a guy sat us in a booth which was near revolving doors-so we heard everything coming in and out of these doors.   It was not busy here at all. The waitress came by gave us menus and asked us what we wanted to drink. When she returned with drinks, she asked what we wanted to order. You would imagine she would give us a clue as to the specials or other items of interest on the menu. Nothing.   Asked here what kind of steak was the flat iron, and she was able to answer the question. So we placed our order. When the food came, we felt rushed. She came by to see if we wanted to package our food. I said okay for a container. She came back with a container. I was still eating the steak n eggs. The biscuit was hard and the grits was salty. Waitress then came back asked if this was going to be together or separate checks.  We did not leave until I finished the egg and a piece of the steak. Ignored the waitress as she walked by looking at the checks and spent time catching up with my friend.  There were patrons before us when we sat down and they were all still there. We were rushed. This place was not busy at all. Lots of empty tables and chairs.   Waitress never refilled our drinks. Bad customer service.  Will not be back."}
{"text":"The Flying Biscuit is by far one of my favorite and \"go-to\" places in Charlotte.  Whether you are interested in breakfast, lunch, dinner, girl's night, or date night - the Flying B is your place!  The food is different and delicious.  It's got that home-style feel with a funky twist.    Mind Blowers: * Anything with the word BLT in it. * Fried Green Tomatoes with Goat Cheese * Brie * The Veggie Scramble * The Sausage Gravy - get it.  Don't ask questions * orange-infused whole wheat French toast * Grits (I've heard people would give up their children for the Flying B's grits!) * ....and pretty much everything else  Other Important pieces of Information: * The staff rocks * Yes, they have a full espresso bar for you coffee addicts, nom nom nom * Yes, they serve alcohol * Yes, they have wireless * This place is a zoo on the weekends.  If you are planning on going for breakfast on Saturday or Sunday get there in time to wait for 10-20 minutes.  Don't be put off by the line outside, it moves fast! * The Flying B is family friendly - so if babies or children freak you out, better find somewhere else to eat (On that note, babies and children freak me out and I still go here as much as humanly possible).  Point being - if you live in Charlotte and you don't go to Flying Biscuit you probably aren't an American."}
{"text":"LOVE this place! Food is great especially the grits. Creamy and buttery. I've been here several times and each time there was always at least a 20 minute wait. Crowded entry way so you'll find yourself either crammed in there like sardines or outside hanging out. I highly recommend the sausage gravy with eggs over biscuits."}
{"text":"I do think Flying Biscuit is a bit expensive, but they serve mostly organic and gluten free products.  So in that sense, its a steal. I would rather pay more for simple ingredients.  Their portions are also huge! So you can get the High Flyer for 6 or 8 bucks- but split it with someone else.   Being from Wilmington, NC- Breakfast places are a staple.  It has been hard to find good eclectic breakfast places in Charlotte.  So if that is what you're looking for, come here!  I've been for both breakfast and dinner and out of all the times I have been here, not once have I been disappointed."}
{"text":"Definitely one of our favorite brunch spots in Charlotte! Food is always quick, coffee is great, and the staff is so nice! It's a great atmosphere inside, with good music and fun art on the walls and the ceilings. The menu is also on the healthier side while still getting a great tasting traditional breakfast. I always get the Eggstravaganza!   This is one of our favorite brunch places to bring out of town guests. Always a big hit! There is usually a little wait, but there's a Hallmark right down the way that is a fun place to pass the time. Always worth that wait!"}
{"text":"I've been to the Flying Biscuit on several occasions, and have never had a bad meal. The service is always great, and the selection of food is outstanding! It will definitely be in my breakfast rotation. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"One word: WOW. I don't even know where to begin the description of the awesomeness, because it was ALL that good. The inside looks interesting, but still inviting with the colorful tabletops. I followed what some other yelpers suggested and got the Cajun Eggs - did not disappoint. Fried green tomatoes were an appetizer, and they were gooey without being too crispy. These were my first fried green tomatoes since I'm not a N. Carolina native, but still great. My boyfriend had the blueberry pancakes and we basically shared. You could actually taste the lightly sweetened pancake and the fresh blueberries. So good. So filling. If I lived around here, I would definitely come back. Multiple times."}
{"text":"Great food and fun atmosphere! Don't go for Sunday brunch unless you are willing to walk around the shopping center for a little while while you wait to be seated. The biscuits are HUGE and fluffy and the eggs are delicious!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. I had the egg scrambled with salomon. My husband who never wants to try anything new loved it as well. We will return soon."}
{"text":"A nice little place for breakfast and brunch.   The chocolate biscuit pudding was really tasty."}
{"text":"Amazing! The grits are ridiculously delicious, as is the Apple butter on every table. Our server was really sunny and cheerful on a rainy day, and took great care of us. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Only checked out the Flying Biscuit recently but it is outstanding. A word of warning that if you plan for Saturday or Sunday breakfast, get there EARLY. They have plentiful seating move tables fast but the people pile in even faster.  Best breakfast dish on the menu is the flatiron steak and eggs. I know what most of you are thinking, breakfast steak you are probably going to get a flimsy select-grade sad excuse for a steak. Not here! I got a thick portion of steak (somewhere in the 6-8oz range) that was better than some steakhouses I've been to, definitely the best I've ever had for breakfast! It was served with eggs cooked however you like (even poached!), grits seasoned to perfection, and a funny looking biscuit so good I ordered a half dozen to go (ask for the apple butter if you get it to-go).  Our server Teala was a gem as well. Bold on personality, grand on service!  Thanks to everyone at the Flying Biscuit for making the Park Road Shopping Center a regular destination!"}
{"text":"5 stars! My boyfriend and I brought my parents and dog here for Saturday brunch. We were seated immediately outside. Both the host and waitress were incredibly friendly. My parents and I really enjoyed the french toast, while my boyfriend enjoyed the southern style benedict. All was delicious!"}
{"text":"They had great service and were prompt on taking my order and bring out the food. I particularly didn't find the food anydifferent from any other breakfast spot. The only dish that stuck out to me was the fried green tomatoes.  It was served with cream cheese and was new. I would go there again to give them a second chance to wow."}
{"text":"This place is great. Food is always good and the service is excellent. There is generally a little bit of a wait, but if you come in anticipating that you should be fine. Generally avg of 15 mins or so."}
{"text":"Park Road shopping center location is filthy and rude wait staff."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a nice breakfast this morning.  A 30 minute wait was passed in a nice chair on the sidewalk. Many comings and goings. Once inside, we were greeted by a handsome waiter, very efficient service, plenty of refills, very attentive service. Biscuit was huge. A little lackluster on the oatmeal pancake but the peach compote was yummy. Love the grits. I have enjoyed my visit. Between Peace and Hominy and Flying Biscuit in Charlotte and the Plucked Up Chicken in Columbus, Georgia,  I have eaten well in some Zany named food spots. Love a catchy name and the foods met their mark each place."}
{"text":"Y'all!!! This is sooo good! We were here on vacation and it was a four star on Yelp and said there was a wait on weekends...we stopped in on a Friday and small wait but not bad probably 10 minutes. I had the biscuits egg and gravy with grits my husband had an omelette with a side of gravy it was excellent! I have had tons of grits being from the south and these were creamy and GREAT I was skeptical about chicken gravy but it was some of the best white gravy as good as momma used to make!! You won't be disappointed I promise if I could give 6 stars I would"}
{"text":"Everything about this place is good, the atmosphere, the lively weekend crowds, and the food is great. However, they are not Second Amendment supporters. They have a NO HANDGUN sign on the front door. Criminals, by their very nature of breaking the law, will not let a sticker on a door stop them from perpetrating their acts. Law-abiding Second Amendment supporters have been shown time and time again to be responsible citizens. We take the responsibility of carrying a firearm very seriously, and we are not about to break the law to go to jail and to lose our precious God-given right to self-defense. Over and over again, these so-called gun free zones are simply shooting galleries for criminals. For this reason I cannot recommend this restaurant, even though they have gone out of their way to craft custom breakfast meals for me that are not on the menu."}
{"text":"Grits where fantastic eggs an sausage but a little over priced nice place very friendly service i will return to try the hotcakes"}
{"text":"This is the Charlotte version of Asheville's Early Girl.  Vegetarian and GF choices clearly marked.  Modifications made without fuss.    Everything was delicious.  Grits needed no additions.  Coffee was excellent.  We ate on the back deck, overlooking a parking lot and gardening store."}
{"text":"I was REALLY excited to try flying biscuit after friends raving about it. I came here on Sunday morning around 10. There was a wait, but I didn't mind because I knew it was going to be worth the wait..... Ugh I was wrong.   I ordered the southern style eggs Benedict and I'm not kidding it took over an hour. As we waited for our food I think our server refilled our coffee once and we had to ask for silverware after our food came. That's such a pet peeve of mine. Anyways I think they forgot to cook my meal fully because I had shredded cheese on my eggs and it was still shredded. It was not cooked. I was starving so I just ate it. The food was cold and the biscuit, which I was most excited for, was over cooked and hard. Plus we had to track our server down to get or check.   I would love to give the flying biscuit another try, but my first time left a bad taste in my mouth..."}
{"text":"This is one of my absolute favourite spots in Charlotte! I have certain dietary restrictions but can always find something here. They have a diverse selection of unique entree options and of course the biscuits are fantastic, dusted with the slightest bit of sugar, paired with their apple butter, will absolutely have you coming back."}
{"text":"When I walked in for yelpy hour the first thing that popped up in my head was how unique the decor was! The place looks like someone couldn't decide on a color scheme and just mash in as many colors that would fit into a space.     I only tried the shrimp and grits, and biscuits with apple cranberry butter. On the first spoon of grits I was in love, such creamy grits with a perfect amount of seasoning! As for the biscuit I was not much of a fan as it was very hard and unappetizing. I ended up using it to scoop up the delicious apple cranberry butter.     Hopefully next time I try this place the biscuits will be better, which they should be since they're in the name."}
{"text":"First time and we will be back  This has been one of those places that I wanted to visit for a number of years because of the name, my wife thought it served only biscuits. Finally got her to take a look at a very large and eclectic menu and she changed here mind.  Drove down from Cornelius this morning which was a rather cool April Sunday Morning.  Arrived around 11:45am and there was a line but we were told that the wait was only about 15 minutes which proved to be fairly correct.  Granted it was chilly and was still in the high 30's the wait was tolerable.  Looking around while we waited, we could tell that this place was dog friendly because of the number of water bowls around. I would assume that if you have a dog, you can sit at one of the sidewalk tables with your furry friend. A bit cool for that today.  Our name was called and we were promptly seated.  First order of business was two cups of coffee, as much to wrap our hands around as to sip. Coffee was of excellent quality and nice and robust and served to warm up both inside and out.  While we waited, my wife went ahead and ordered a Coffee White Russian and while I may be missing something, a Black Russian is made with Kahlua which is a Coffee Liqueur so what's the difference. In any case, she enjoyed it and that is all that matters.  For her entree, she ordered the Turkey Meatloaf with Mashed Potatoes, Green Beans and a Rolls. For my entree, I ordered the 3B ( Bacon, Basil and Bleu Cheese) on a grilled Chicken Breast , Bread, Romaine and Tomato.  Both proved to be excellent choices, The server gave me option of regular bacon as opposed to the turkey bacon which is standard on this sandwich which I did.  All in all, the food was outstanding and there are many more items on this rather creative menu I wish to explore at a later visit.  Service is very good and the decor is very light and reminiscent of Haight Asbury from the 60's.  Love the decor.  We will definitely be back. A bit cool today and they do have a rear patio with gas heaters but still a bit warmer on the inside."}
{"text":"We wait 30mins to be seated as they were super busy. But the man upfront with the super cool mustache was friendly so I didn't mind the wait with my girlfriends.  Finally we were seated and it took a while for our waitress Kelly to come over but when she did she took our order. Since it took so long to get our food she bought us free biscuits so we wouldn't starve to dead but I must say the biscuit reminded me of store bought bisquick mix with a brush of cinnamon and sugar.   At last the food arrives...i had the flat iron steak with cheese eggs and a strawberry crepe. My girls had omelets and again we both got the huge bisquick biscuits again.   The food was good and filling but the star of the show was the grits!!! I had never had grits so creamy in my life that alone would make me want to go back and they had a delicious blood Mary."}
{"text":"The Flying Biscuit is an interesting cafe. I came here with my wife to have breakfast and I left enlightened. Charlotte has a really special breakfast place worth going to if your in town. We dined in and I ordered a spinach omelet with a side of applewood smoked bacon, The spinach omelet was made with egg whites and came with a bowl of mixed fruit which was good. I'm not a vegan by any means but this meal had me leaving this fine establishment feeling like Popeye. The waiter was attentive to request and the food was delish! That earns 5 stars in my book. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Summary: Original menu, over-the-top friendly service, and hands-down the best grits I've ever had.   Atmosphere: After a 20-minute wait, our party of 34 (yes, 34) was seated on their back patio. The interior was fun, but the patio more than accommodated our large group, and was equally enjoyable (if not more so; who doesn't love the fresh air?). Our servers were sharp and yet relaxed. Didn't miss a beat, and everything was prompt.   Food:  Get the Sledgehammer for your drink (5 shots of espresso and steamed cream). I got the Smoked Salmon Scrambler for brunch. Great ratio of dill cream cheese to smoked salmon; good stuff. The biscuit was flavorful (topped with a pinch of salt).   But the coup de grace was the grits.   My momma's from the south, but I was raised in NY; this means finding grits in any restaurant is a disappointment. But going on the word of my sister (who lived in Charlotte for a few years), I got the grits. And I ate them. And everyone else's who didn't want their side. Seriously, the best grits I've ever had next to my own momma's.   Negative: They only had XL \"OMG\" tshirts. We wanted 2 smalls and 1 medium. Bummer. Looks like we'll just need to go back."}
{"text":"I went here for breakfast and loved every second of it- only wish there was a Flying Biscuit in Boston!  I got the High Flyer breakfast which was way too much food, but a great mix of everything.  The grits were probably the best I've ever had, and I didn't leave one bite behind- they were creamy & delicious. The oatmeal pancake with peach compote & the biscuit which had just a little bit of sugar on top, were equally good.  Knowing I wouldn't be able to eat all of that food, I left the eggs behind since I figured I could get those anywhere!  Cute space, open floor plan, friendly service, reasonable prices.  If I had to dock points for anything it would be that they're located in a strip mall which is a little less appealing, but for food this good who gives a flying biscuit?!"}
{"text":"Mmmm flying biscuits. Ok, the biscuits didn't actually fly here, but they were really good. The wife and I came here looking for a simple breakfast to go.  Flying Biscuit did not disappoint. I ordered for takeout over the phone and opted for some pancakes, a bacon/egg/cheese biscuit, some of the creamy dreamy grits, and grilled mac and cheese sticks.  Because who can say no to grilled mac and cheese sticks.  The place was a bit packed when we arrived so did have to wait quite a while for our food to come up, but I liked the prices here.  Nothing was overpriced, the range was very easy on the pockets.  When the food came up we decided to eat it at the bar.  I will say it disappeared very quickly.  The pancakes were pretty decent; but not anything special.  Surprisingly, the same goes for the grilled mac.  It was cool to get mac and cheese that looked like French toast sticks, but they were only \"pretty good.\"  If you get them, you want be disappointed, but you won't be pleasantly surprised either.  The biscuit on the breakfast sandwich was warm, buttery and good. But the star was the dreamy grits.  Everybody has grits, but it's hard to do them right - Flying Biscuit does them very right, lol.  I would recommend coming here if you're looking for your basic breakfast choices and want something decent; but I would recommend them even moreso if you had a craving for some good grits."}
{"text":"Friendly service, good food, using some healthy alternative ingredients."}
{"text":"First time eating breakfast in Charlotte, don't want to eat anywhere without Claudia serving me.  a+"}
{"text":"Love this place! Service is always great and the food is amazing! Get the grits! I usually order the Piedmont Omelette as it comes. It this time I asked for egg whites instead and 10x better. Will order it like that from now on. And oh em gee the Lemon Poppyseed Pancakes are EVERYTHING!  Also it's usually a wait but well worth it."}
{"text":"This is my favorite of the two Charlotte locations.  The food is great, the sevice is great, and the atmosphere is nice.  I eat here about once a month and always enjoy it!"}
{"text":"This place was a big disappointment. They have two vegan options but the one I tried (Tofu Scramble) was alright, I guess. My boyfriend was also not incredibly happy about his meal (garden scramble) and he said that the biscuit (the thing that they're named after) was pretty bland and his potatoes were cold. The service was also really bad. Our waitress took our order, while doing so I asked a simple vegan question (Are your moon dust potatoes vegan?) and she just said \"I don't know.\" without offering to check. Well, that was the last time we saw her until it was time to give us the check. She passed our table like every three minutes and never thought to ask us how our meal was going.   I wouldn't mind not returning."}
{"text":"Everything was fantastic. I had French Toast with raspberry sauce , applewood smoked bacon and a biscuit with amazing apple butter .  They were busy , but they served quickly and efficiently and I was in and out in less than 20 min. I will be going back ."}
{"text":"I love the feel of the restaurant. Nobody can take that look away from them. This is what a Southern diner should look like. It's done right and not over the top. That's what gives it that character you expect to see in a chain restaurant. Then again, I just said it was a chain. And like most chains, the food is a hit and a miss, depending on the day and the employee on duty. This is \"family owned,\" but it's a chain, folks.  I've been here three times for lunch. The prices are decent for the food I'm getting, but nothing really urged me to come back. And that's something I won't be doing for a good while. Now, before I continue, I went here for lunch, but wanted to try their all day menu items. It should be safe, right? Hmm...no.   We went in and had great service from the start. There is NOTHING wrong with their service. Our server was probably one of the BEST I've seen in a long time. Ordered our food and got some biscuits while we waited. Love the biscuits though. Not too flaky or doughy. Just the right mixture for my tastes.   I ordered the Bacon and Egg combo with potatoes as my side. When it came out, I thought it was joke. It was literally two eggs fried, burnt bacon that had the consistency of an icicle, and a scoop of seasoned potatoes. Nothing special at all. What was worse? I paid nearly $8.50 for this! Are you kidding me. I would've gone to Waffle House and got twice as much and just the same quality if not BETTER. The other meals that I've gotten here aren't too bad, but still run along the lines of mediocre Southern dining to me. And it seems overpriced for the quality of food you expect to deserve.  I'm disappointed. If this is what \"Southern dining\" is, then you can keep it until you prove me otherwise."}
{"text":"I get board and go on what my friends and family call \"Adventures\". So I came across Flying Biscuit when I was suppose to be going to class one day. I so happy I deceided to be late that day. I had the Southern Scramble. It was freaking awesome. Collard greens, turkey bacon, cheese and a side of their Dreamy Grits. I was so stuff I didn't eat again until dinner. The food is so fresh and they use organic ingredients. There whole menu is full of great meals. Just writing this review make want to leave work and go there now. So go have breakfast or brunch or even dinner there you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"The breakfast is amazing (with the exception of the coffee which is never good), but service is sub-par. During breakfast, waiting for a table is a free-for-all and they're super inconsistent. We were once skipped on their wait list for no reason. Another time the waiter forgot to put our order in. Other times we waited a super long time for the check. When they make mistakes, they don't offer anything beyond an apology.  Could be so much better if they got their queuing and table service in order."}
{"text":"Not impressed, probably won't go back and can't recommend it based on our visit. The service was fine--restaurant was empty except for one other table. I think they must get a lot of lunch traffic, but we were there on Friday for supper. Only half of my meal (a breakfast plate) was good--the grits were indeed creamy and delicious, but I suspect they had been microwaved, because there was a sticky film rimmed around the bowl. The pork bacon was crispy and not greasy. But my scrambled eggs were overcooked and rubbery, and the biscuit (the signature item) was the size, shape and consistency of a baseball. It was also cold. My companion had biscuit topped chicken pot pie, which was like chicken stew served on top of a biscuit, topped with a biscuit, and served with--you guessed it--a biscuit. The chicken filling had a good flavor with plenty of chicken and vegetables, but all the juice was absorbed into the dry biscuits. I would rather eat canned biscuits than the ones they serve. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Had early breakfast here on Sunday and was actually disappointed.  This restaurant is a chain, and I had tried a branch before in Houston.  I had fond memories, but the Park Road location didn't live up to them.  My girlfriend ordered steak and eggs while I tried a half order of the French toast. Her steak was the best part of the meal.  Grits were OK, but nothing spectacular.  Biscuit was large and flavorful, but the French toast was lacking.  The cook tried to make up for the weak flavor by smothering it in raspberry sauce and condensed milk, but much was still lacking.  And prices were high for quality of food - disappointing overall!"}
{"text":"Really wanted to rate this two stars, but the excellent service won me over.  So full disclosure I love brunch, but hate eggs.  So I was SOL at flying biscuit.  Just about everything included eggs.  Usually I can work around this, and I did - but the food was just mediocre.  Facts are I prefer Tupelo Honey a lot more.  Tupelo wins on hashbrowns, on bacon and on french toast...it's a tie for biscuits.  I'll give them this  Flying Biscuit does a really good biscuit.  It'd be criminal if the biscuit sucked.  Our waiter was charming and attentive.  He saved my dining experience.    This place is a far trek from Concord and there are far better options - hell waffle house is better IMO."}
{"text":"The Flying Biscuit was just pure amazing. I love that they offer non pork breakfast meats. The turkey bacon was great, the grits were some of the best I've ever had, and the oatmeal pancakes were like nothing I've had before. It seemed like a great crowd of people that frequent the place, the staff were top notch and we enjoyed the artwork. Sadly, I have to admit, the only thing I wasn't thrilled about was the biscuits, everything else though gets an A+ in my book."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went on a Sunday during brunch time. Worth the 15 minute wait. I had the oatmeal pancakes with peach compote. The compote was too sweet for my taste, but the pancakes were thick and amazing with the oatmeal in them. I had a side of moon dusted potatoes and they were delicious, not greasy or heavy on the stomach. I tried my boyfriends southern Benedict sandwich and it was very flavorful. The grits were delicious and creamy, almost like my grandmother used to make, southern style and such. They definitely didn't clump up and get nasty like most grits do. Also, the flying biscuits are amazing!!! They have some sort of sugar on top and it makes them irresistible. Definitely will come back for the awesome monthly specials and the drink menu!!!"}
{"text":"My BF ordered the shrimp  and grits - devoured it! He enjoyed his meal and he doesn't like to venture much.   I ordered the egg Benedict with pimento cheese . The combination with the biscuit was really tasty!   We went early on a Monday morning, no wait time, quick service, friendly staff.  Total cost of $38 (including 2x coffee  )"}
{"text":"The Flying Biscuit never lets us down! My fiance and I are almost happy we moved to this area just because of this restaurant alone. We tried swaying from our favorite Sunday brunch spot to try Harper's in South Park but realized what a mistake we made, so back to Flying Biscuit we went!   Although the line can be extremely long on weekends, the staff always gets everyone sat in a very timely manner. Then the service is always very quick too! Whether you want a quick brunch or one where you relax and enjoy, this is the place. We took family here when they came in town and it was their favorite experience of all the restaurants we visited that weekend.   You can't go wrong with biscuits and gravy, I've had several of their omelettes which are all wonderful and the biscuits are great too!   This place will definitely continue to be a regular spot."}
{"text":"The service was great and the food was amazing. I had the chicken pot pie. The biscuits and apple butter are to die for. They serve breakfast lunch and dinner all day. You can't go wrong with this place. I will certainly be back!"}
{"text":"Good breakfast, service good had Eggs Benedict with pimento cheese(a little hot) but good, creamy grits. Portions are large."}
{"text":"Adorable little cafe with great breakfast. It's so much better than those big chain restaurants. Prices are good too. Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"I could see this becoming a Sunday morning staple if I lived nearby. Service was efficient and everything was served hot and fresh. I personally prefer buttermilk biscuits but their soda biscuits are exceptional in their class. This isn't your cookie cutter \"IHOP\" breakfast. Their OJ is a bit over priced at $3.49 for a 12 oz glass. Otherwise the food is reasonably priced."}
{"text":"The sever was great along with the food. It was a friendly and welcoming atmosphere! Great choice for a brunch place here in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Excellent food!   Omlette was awesome except they used diced chicken and it was a bit overcooked but the CokaCola glazed salmon salad was absolutely amazing and enough for a full lunch."}
{"text":"Staff is super friendly and quick. Perfect place if you want to grab breakfast before work. Kitschy diner theme interior. Food was ok, not the best, but it fills you up. Portions on eggs are on the small side. Biscuits are dry, but are made up with apple butter. French toast on the dry side as well that cannot be fixed with syrup or butter bc of the type of bread being used. Grits are creamy and buttery.  Good place for a fast early am fix."}
{"text":"Biscuits Gravy Grits are a must IF... you are from the South. And this place is plating them up perfectly. I mean I don't even really like grits and I loved their shrimp and grits. I got a biscuit too with their homemade strawberry jam which was not bad either lol. Come here for your southern fix!"}
{"text":"What can I say?  Moving to the South there are a few things I had to get used to.   #1 Sweet tea is EVERYWHERE... #2 Grits And the place to find the best creamy dreamy grits in Charlotte?  Flying Biscuit! I am in love with them and they have so many amazing items on their menu.  I went vegetarian about a year ago and they have things to accomodate me, and before that, their Turkey Hash was AMAZING!   I stick with the French toast because that glaze they use is so sweet and good, I love it.  I recommend this place to everyone.  They also have two seperate outdoor seating areas, booze, and different coffee drinks."}
{"text":"Great brunch spot! If you are craving for some creamy grits and the most perfectly baked buttery biscuit this is the place to come. The service is fast and on point. I tried the salmon as well and it was delicious. Good portion sizes as well. You will keep coming for those creamy heavenly grits :)"}
{"text":"Really good food and selections.  The mimosas are the best! Depending on the day, the wait can sometimes be lengthy but the food is well worth the wait."}
{"text":"I'm in charlotte for Family and for ciaa, so I'm like why not do a breakfast with the family? I turn to my trusty advisor yelp to find suitable options! Great I see the flying biscuit!  I've been to the one in Atlanta so I can vouch for their food! Let's start with the good...  The good the mimosas, and food was good. Everyone's fav was the grits. The buttermilk pancakes are cool not the best I've had, also tried the oatmeal pancakes. They were pretty good.  The bad which takes it to 3 instead of 4/5 was the extremely slow service! The waitress was nice but the service was slow. The pancakes weren't hot when they came out and neither was the chicken sausage.  Maybe because it was a busy day for them. I'd come back if I'm the area but it's not as great as the one I went to in Atl"}
{"text":"Teala was an amazing waitress. She knew the menu inside and out! The spot was totally clean! All of the selections were delicious. I ordered the pasta, sausage and eggs strangely amazing! The biscuits are huge and yummy!"}
{"text":"Visited for the first time last Sunday with one of my Brunch Buddies.  The place was a little hard to find, tucked away in a big shopping center, but the long line of people waiting outside clued me in.  The line moved quickly though, and my friend and I had a table within 15 minutes.  My only real complaint was the table we were seated at.  They have a huge back patio that I am sure is amazing when the weather is nice, but that day it was rainy and chilly.  My chair was right next to the back rail of the patio and the plastic wall cover thingy didn't do the best job of keeping the cold wind and rain out.  The food, however, was amazing and the waitress was very friendly and attentive.  The salmon scramble and rosemary potatoes are to die for!  Despite being a GRIT, I have never cared much for grits, but I may have to rethink that.  Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Love their Hollywood omlit and turkey hash...... Getting hungry just thinking about it.  I always ask for extray cheese, place is clean and staff are always nice and accommodating."}
{"text":"We LOVE coming here for breakfast. It's definitely a place to come for some unique tasty breakfast."}
{"text":"We were looking for a handy family dinner place after swimming and the kids wanted \"breakfast food\" so we thought, why not Flying Biscuit for dinner?  We usually go to the one in Stonecrest but decided to go here since it was closer. Easy parking, no wait, place was about 1/2 full early Saturday evening. Vibe is similar to the other one, bright colors, diner-like atmosphere. However, this one has really bright lighting.   Kids all ordered choco milk and chocolate chip pancakes (more on this later). Both the wife and I ordered variations on the green tomato BLT - I had the sandwich, she had the salad. We also ordered the soup of the day - tomato basil bisque.   Soup was rock star good - not sure if it was the soup, the cold day, swimming or all of the above, but we devoured it! In fact, it was so good our younger son got his own bowl! Of course, the soup comes with the trademark biscuits with apple butter (which makes them for me!). When the chocolate chip pancakes arrived they were HUGE portions! These were not the kid size but the full adult size portions. We figured it was a mistake but figured it would make for a good dogie bag for tomorrow. The green tomato BLTs were very tasty, in particular the jalepeno-cashew relish that comes on top! The combo of turkey bacon, the relish, fried green tomato and goat cheese is very unusual but balanced.   While we were eating the manager came by and asked about us, mentioned the pancake thing, which we said was no big deal. We then got to talking to Brandon, who also works there. Very friendly, nice guy and we mentioned our daughter had just had her birthday. . . before you know it Brandon had ordered us a birthday brownie sunday for our table! It was also very good - dark chocolate and cream cheese brownie with ice cream, whipped cream, the whole nine yards. . . We were pleasantly surprised to say the least!  When the check arrived not only was the brownie comped, but all of our pancake orders had been reduced to kids orders!! So basically we got free desert and breakfast for three for the next day on the house. Pretty exceptional service by any standard!  Overall, we already liked Flying Biscuit but this sold us as devoted customers!"}
{"text":"Never disappointed here! I am not sure I have had grits like these anywhere else. I certainly don't want to know the ingredients. All, I can say is that I hope you get at least 3 miles in either before or after you eat them;). Nonetheless, they are worth the sacrifice. I am NOT a breakfast fan, but I will eat it here everyday! If it was all lite of course:)"}
{"text":"I always come here I would say 2x a month the customer service is good never had a problem before. Today was a little different so today visit only get 3 our waitress didn't come and check up on us only to give the check, didn't ask if I wanted a refill like I was literally trying to get tea from the ice in the corner of my cup lol. We were seated under the air vent so water was dripping down hitting my arm/hand so we had to move to a different table. The food was good as always, I ordered the biscuit eggs and gravy. I love the biscuits with the Apple butter. I really want the review to be 4 or 5 but we'll see what happens next time."}
{"text":"Not really sure how this place is still open, the flavorless breakfast is the reason I won't return. I tried it once and never again. It doesn't have a lot of normal breakfast items. I guess some people like that. 100% not the place to take your kids."}
{"text":"No airborne breaded goods here! (although I would be 100% behind the idea)  I met my best friend for Sunday brunch around 1:00 and was informed that there was a 10-15 minute wait. The guy who was manning the host desk had an awesome mustache and was super friendly. The wait time ended up being less than that and we were led inside.   Our sweet waitress Monique greeted us, gave us menus and took our drink orders. I had browsed the menu online beforehand but seeing all of the options in-person slightly overwhelmed me (everything sounded and looked delicious!) but I stuck with what I originally planned on ordering: the Piedmont omelet with oven roasted potatoes. I don't care how \"dreamy\" their grits are, this girl does not eat them.   The interior reminded me of a bright, cheery country kitchen. I was also surprised to learn that they have somewhat of a coffee bar serving up chai tea (iced or hot), mochas, cappuccinos, lattes, etc. I just stuck with plain ol' coffee.  After our orders were taken, our food arrived pretty soon afterward. I was pleased by the size of the biscuit. Even though they go by 'Flying Biscuit' I was half expecting them to serve biscuits that were pretty small. Not the case here. Thick, fluffy, carby goodness. On the table, you have the choice to dress your biscuit with standard butter or apple butter (or both, you rebel). I went the apple butter route and it tasted just like Fall to me.   My omelet was delicious. Packed with chicken sausage and turkey bacon, cheese, and onions. So so so so good and would order it again. Mentally, I've already added this place to my rotation of breakfast/brunch spots and cannot wait to go as often as I can get the chance."}
{"text":"We came for breakfast on Memorial Day and made it in just in time. The line can get really long but the food is definitely worth it.  I got the breakfast bowl and my wife got the southern style biscuit benedict. Both were absolutely delicious!!!!! Both of us were weary of getting the grits (which comes with every item) but they really are award winning like they say. The biscuits are HUGE. And I do mean huge!!  The inside is nice and cozy with a really cool big front door that is a garage door with a big screen over it. Really cool place with awesome service. You should definitely give it a try.  Oh...food was so good I didn't get to take a picture because I ate it too fast"}
{"text":"So, so, so, so, so delicious and super duper friendly staff! I know I sound cheesy and like I am exaggerating, but seriously, I'm not.   The Flying Biscuit Cafe is such a warm and inviting cafe. Not only is the dining area welcoming with it's bright colors and natural light, the staff are extremely friendly, making you feel genuinely happy to be there.  I guess I should get to the most important part, right? THE FOOD! Surprise, surprise... IT'S AWESOME! If I can remember correctly, I ordered the vegetarian sausage, eggs and a biscuit with a side of fresh fruit. Also no surprise was that the biscuit was one of the best I have ever had. SO FLUFFY!   Overall, I had an awesome experience at The Flying Biscuit Cafe! Cool name, great food, friendly staff and great dining area. What more can I ask for?"}
{"text":"Reading the other reviews for this Flying Biscuit locations, I see words. In fact, I see many words, such as decor, biscuits, service, grits, etc. These are all good words, and you can certainly use them to talk about the Flying Biscuit. However, when I talk about the flying biscuit, I really only need to use two words:  Turkey. Meatloaf.  Hey you guys, I am so in love with the Flying Biscuit's turkey meatloaf. I know, if you're a meatloaf lover, you'll wrinkle your nose at the idea that turkey could take the place of ground beef and pork. Well, here's some news for you: in this instance, turkey does not substitute. It surpasses.  OK, OK, I don't want to write a simplistic review, so here are some other facts: the decor is interesting, the clientele is even more interesting, and the service is sometimes good, sometimes iffy.  But oh, turkey meatloaf. Those are the words you need to note."}
{"text":"If you're starving then I suppose you could eat here otherwise I'd steer clear you'll spend $32 on essentially food that is bland Coffee is disgusting in all the meals on the menu are either really weird or don't offer the right combination of items for a good brunch"}
{"text":"One of my fave breakfast spots in the city! Staff is always friendly, and food is ALWAYS good! Food always taste fresh, like they actually care about the quality. They also have quite a bit of healthy options as well. Their grits are so freaking Goooood!! LOL!! Love this spot! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"New favorite breakfast spot. I love the park plaza in general and coming here makes it even better. Considering how busy it was on a Sunday we got seated really quickly. Teala our amazing waitress was so fast and so amazing. She ROCKED!!!!! The two tables next to us also loved her. Our food was AMAZING. Just overall an amazing place.  The two tables around us and our table got our food so fast. The food is also super amazing."}
{"text":"I thought the shrimp quesadilla was fabulous. However, the meal was surprisingly disappointing. I had the blackened tilapia on grits which was not very flavorful.  However, the fish was very fresh. The unsweetened ice tea was very good and the service was wonderful. Prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"BREAKFAST ALL DAY.  I've only had breakfast items here and quality and service are always phenomenal.  Those biscuits are lovely, yes, but DO NOT miss the grits. The 'loaded' grits at this place are crazy-good!  I like that they offer turkey sausage and veggie items (tofu is on the menu), if you're vegetarian or just in the mood for a meatless meal.  Bring an appetite.  Portions are generous, and the food is very flavorful.  Sure, this isn't your run-of-the-mill standard bargain breakfast (most brek entrees with tax are around ten bucks), but it's worth it.  I keep saying I'm going to try some of the other menu items, but breakfast is just TOO good..."}
{"text":"They have the best grits in town, in my opinion. However, there other menu items are often flavorless or overcooked. My biscuit was dry and bland, very dense and not fluffy like a good biscuit should be. Also the service tends to be hit or miss. But for the price, it's ok and they do offer a good bit of healthy fare."}
{"text":"We've been to another Flying Biscuit and weren't that impressed.  However, after trying the Shrimp & Grits at a Yelp event, we decided to give it another go at this other location.  We stopped in to get a small bowl but wait, what?  The ONLY way to order the Shrimp & Grits is as a $12.99 dinner entree? Oh, you get a side and a biscuit.  Fine.  Ordered the Tomato Basil soup, which was meh, way too thick and obviously reheated since when I tried it, it was cold, and when daughter tried it, it was too hot.  We ended up sharing the giant bowl of Shrimp & Grits, but we both agreed they were not nearly as good as what we remembered from the Yelp Event.   We brought home what we didn't eat there, but neither one of us was that interested in eating anymore."}
{"text":"The food was GREAT here! Loved the biscuits, grits on point waffles everything good... our waiter was fast and attentive!"}
{"text":"Used to LOVE this place as they offer great tofu options and fabulous biscuits, but my husband and I began noticing how salty the food is. We mentioned it to our servers over a few months, but our food continued to taste over-salted. We'll still stop by occasionally, but it's no longer a favorite spot."}
{"text":"Delicious food. I work crazy hours, from 3am-1pm, so I've tried many different breakfast places in the Charlotte area. This is one of my favorite restaurants for breakfast. Biscuits are incredible, especially w/ their apple butter sauce. My only (small) gripe is their price. Expect to pay about $9-10 per plate for breakfast. But that's the cost of having fresh, non-greasy food!"}
{"text":"I know this is going to be wildly unpopular, but I don't understand the hype of this place. It's a cute breakfast/lunch/brunch spot that's located in the Park Road Shopping center -- so there's plenty of parking (that's a plus!). Another plus, was despite it being a beautiful fall day there was no wait! We walked right in and were seated in the back covered area.  I came with my husband and parents when they were in town during the fall. I ordered the seasonal soup. It was a squash soup with actually really delicious croutons. The soup was creamy without being too heavy, but it was a little on the sweet side.   What totally miffed me ... the biscuits. They were hard as a rock on the outside and crumbled easily. I didn't think they were flavorful. I've read other reviews that were positive so maybe I was there on an of day.  Service was OK, not great, not awful.   I'll have to try it again and see if it was just an off day for the restaurant, but I was truly disappointed by the biscuit."}
{"text":"The Flying Biscuit is a nice breakfast joint mired in horrible quality control and poor customer service.  We came in around 10:30a on a weekday to find a nice atmosphere and a half full dining area. Their menu has a good spread of healthier options like chicken sausages and turkey bacon, and listed many items as gluten free. I ordered the turkey hash, excited to try both their \"famous\" biscuit and moon dusted potatoes. My mother ordered the buttermilk blueberry pancakes.  After a short while, our food was delivered. The turkey hash was different, although it made for a good breakfast option with the savory turkey and gravy over the potatoes. The famous biscuit was fresh, but really just a good biscuit, nothing that would inspire you to order a dozen. The potatoes were also just well done potatoes. They had good seasoning without being salty, but didn't really blow me away. I did think that overall, the dish could have benefited from not having cheddar cheese melted on top of the eggs. It didn't add to the overall flavor of the dish and served only to make the dish unnecessarily \"heavier\" and overcook my requested over-easy eggs (which I was warned might happen from the waitress).   Now, from this review so far you're asking me \"why only 1 star if everything was ok?\" Well, when my mother's food came out the problems unfolded.  First, the waitress mistakenly ordered plain buttermilk pancakes instead of the blueberry pancakes. Fine, mistakes happen. But when asked about it, she first responded by saying \"you said just buttermilk\" in an accusatory and annoyed tone. When we all corrected her, she gave a halfhearted apology and attitude and asked if she could exchange it. Not wanting to be a hassle, my mother said it was ok, but just to get her some fresh blueberries to put on top.   Now... drum roll please, for the moment you've all been waiting for. After a little while, our server came by with the blueberries. Just when my mother was about to pour them over her pancakes, she noticed something; some little white spots dotted around the bowl. Weird, so she picked out one blueberry, and then another and then another until it became painfully clear that all of the blueberries in the bowl had MOLD on them (pic attached). And I don't just mean a little mold on one or two blueberries, I mean A WHOLE BOWL OF MOLDY BLUEBERRIES. I can see it now, Gordon Ramsey taking that bowl of living fungi and once living fruit, mushing his fingers into it and screaming \"YOU'RE GONNA KILL SOMEBODY!\" Likewise, at the same time, I wanted to warn everyone in the restaurant that the blueberries had been contaminated not only with visibly growing mold, but also the spores of all that mold (trust me, I've worked in a lab and mold spores are no joke).  As if I need to justify my problem with this even more, imagine being served that mess, cooked inside your pancakes unknowingly. This was a complete and blatant lack of quality control. The kitchen staff and manager had those rotting blueberries stocked, and then sent them out in a bowl where the waitress, without looking, served it to a customer for consumption. Again, in the words of Gordon Ramsey himself: YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED.   ITS EVEN BLUEBERRY SEASON! WE LITERALLY JUST PICKED SOME FRESH!  When pointed out to the waitress that the blueberries were moldy and rotting, she gave a simple apology filled with her typical bad attitude and whisked the bowl away. Another lady came by after and simply offered another apology about the \"mistake\". No offer to comp the plate of a mere $6 short stack of pancakes, no further apology or explanation offered. No attempt was made to make this right. At that point, we were discarded as valued customers. The bill came and we were charged full price for our \"wonderful\" meal. Wow. I'm surprised they didn't charge us extra for the mold."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot in the Park Road Shopping Center.  We first came here by accident and were very pleased with the vegan options!  I can't seem to deviate from my order because it's was good the first time... tofu scramble with a side of the black bean cakes.  They go so well together!  My husband likes the vegan bbq wrap or veganizes the mexican wrap."}
{"text":"This place is great for breakfast. The grits here is almost as good as the grits that my mother made. I had the Piedmont omelette with potatoes and it was awesome. The service from our server, Tesla, was wonderful and the rest of the staff seem to like working here. It gets packed on the weekends so get here early."}
{"text":"Shrimp and grits was very good. Salad was not over dressed. Good service. Overall, one of the better Biscuits I've been to."}
{"text":"So who doesn't like delicious fresh made biscuits? No one? That's what I thought. I adore this place. The food is wonderful and probably my favorite place to come for breakfast - not brunch although they do brunch the crowd the mimosas all of it - but breakfast for me this is the spot.  The turkey hash breakfast and the  eggs-stroidinary eggs (gosh spelling cannot be right on this item but I am too lazy to google it at the moment) are my faves for sure.  I love the funky décor on the inside and the fact that they have a few tables for outside seating as well. The portions are huge and every item I have had thus far is full of flavor. The coffee is ok but not the best ive had but hey its coffee and pretty much all coffee makes me happy.  I always bring my mom here when she comes in town its one of her favorites as well. The service is good and by good I mean they come they get your order and they don't mess it up. No frills and at times it seems I cant tell who the server is per say since we always get waited on by multiple people every time we come. I like it and we all leave happy. Kudos Flying Biscuit! Its always amazing and cant wait to return!"}
{"text":"OMG....those damn biscuits are phenomenal. A small piece fell off when I was cutting it in half so I got to sample it before I really got into it. I mean, it was to die for. I made the ugly face. I decided to wrap some up in a tissue and stick in my purse. No, I'm joking. I took two in a to-go container and ate one for breakfast the next morning. I mean, what place sells biscuits dense enough to eat for breakfast with a cup of coffee and be good??? I mean, I was good! With ONE biscuit!   I had the shrimp and grits and they weren't really all that. It was just shrimp, grits (which were amazing) and a whole bunch of stewed tomatoes. I'm used to shrimp and grits with onions, peppers and sausage. There were more tomatoes than there were grits and shrimp. I pushed most of them to the side of my plate  and, by the end of my meal, it looked like I still had half a plate of food left. Nope...it was just tomatoes.   Anyway, this seems like just a regular a** breakfast spot with good a** biscuits."}
{"text":"Just as great as the one in Ballantyn, but much closer to where I live. Can't help myself to grab a half dozen biscuits to go.....LOVE IT!!"}
{"text":"Three words: try the grits. Even if you don't like grits, try them anyway. This is the second time I've got the Southern Style Biscuit Benedict and it has not disappointed either time, even for a critical food lover. Biscuit, amazing homemade pimento cheese, bacon, poached eggs, hollandaise sauce with fresh basil. So much going on and it all works! Whether you're from the south or just visiting, get an accurate taste of southern comfort food with love and get it. Also, as everyone else says, the apple butter is amazing."}
{"text":"Loved it!  Stopped by to pick up lunch to go with my daughter.  While I was perusing the menu through the window, a busboy stepped outside to hand me a takeout menu.  How nice!  I settled on the chicken club wrap.  It was served with the most amazing diced potatoes and a huge biscuit.  All for $8.  I shared it with my daughter and still had half a sandwich left to eat today for leftovers.  I also ordered an iced chai.  It was not so good... a little watered down, but not so bad that I had them make me another.  Next time I will just stick with a sweet tea.    I plan to bring all the kiddos here for breakfast - the breakfast menu looked amazing.  So excited to have this fun, fast, yummy restaurant close by!"}
{"text":"\"Oooooo, I wanna come back,\" I said to myself as I read through the menu. There was so much good-sounding stuff I wanted to try, and I felt away about not being able to sample it this one time.   Nevertheless, I settled on the Hollywood omelet. This healthier option is a veggie omelet with cheese. It comes with fruit (but I substituted the fruit for grits) and a biscuit. I also ordered the 'creamiest dreamiest grits'.  The omelet was rather large, I couldn't finish it all. It was a little watery, but I blame the spinach inside of it. It wasn't bad , at all and the tomato coulis went VERY well with the omelet...I kind of want that on all my omelets now.  The grits were creamy, delicious, and maybe had a little bit of cheese mixed in, which was good. I wish the portion of grits was bigger. The biscuit was good as well, it was definitely fluffy. Not the greasy, super salty Bojangles biscuit that leaves your fingertips glistening. These are drier, for lack of a better term and I was getting a flour-like aftertaste...and yet it didn't stop me from spreading the signature cranberry apple butter on top and eating it.   Very much looking forward to coming and back and trying the dishes with chicken sausage, and maybe some of the French toast."}
{"text":"My family and I love The Flying Biscuit. It is suitable for diners of all ages and palates. The menu is extremely diverse and offers everything from light and healthy fare to hearty comfort food. Many breakfast joints serve dishes that are dripping in oil and heavily salted while The Flying Biscuit delivers flavorful and quality food that is not too heavy or greasy. Portion sizes are generous AND delicious. Love this place and can't wait to come back next time I am in town."}
{"text":"This place is really delicious! Food was fresh and very yummy. Staff was great.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"Food was okay, but my review may be biased since I've been to other flying biscuits that taste better. But, more importantly, the customer service was not the best. When I ordered just the single stack pancake(the lowest costing item on the menu), she waitress seemed pretty upset and kept encouraging my friend and I to purchase more. After that, she didn't come back and check up on us at all. She then gave us our bill while we were not even half way done with our food, and didn't show up again until much later (keep in mind, it was not busy). She tossed the bill back and just left after we paid. She was not given a tip."}
{"text":"This is the first review I have done on yelp. I could resist to let everyone else know how amazing this place is! I went with 3 other people and we all got something different. With that being said all 4 dishes were great! There was a wait on a Sunday morning but it wasn't too long. I highly recommend the southern style eggs Benedict!"}
{"text":"I had the best breakfast while i was at North Carolina. I loved the mocha i had it was amazing ."}
{"text":"We have been here twice, Solid good Comfort food for Breakfast. Great Service and good selection on the menu. We will definitely be back again, hopefully when it's not quite as busy!"}
{"text":"I saw turkey bacon on the menu and was so excited because very few places offer turkey bacon! I order the turkey burger w/ a side of dusted moon potatoes (yuck) very cold and dry! back to the dusty burger, I was so disappointed never in my life have I ever eaten a frozen turkey burger until the flying biscuit eewww the meat was shaped funny and tasted really rancid the lettuce was so big an wet I didn't notice the barely there grey tb patty there was some kind of splash of sauce on the humongous wheat bun I instantly scrapped it off with the napkin! I said a prayer and proceeded... Since I'd scrapped off the evil sauce I thought I'd use what I thought was H57 ketchup ... ... All I'm gonna say is idk what they used to refill those ketchup bottles but that was not H57 or ketchup for that matter it was uber rancid never tasted anything like it  the flying biscuit really let me down guys I was excited 3,000 miles before I arrived mission unsatisfactory"}
{"text":"Mmm Vegan BBQ Tofu burrito. Grits are freaking delicious. Biscuit did not fly, but was very soft and sweet. Typically packed on a weekend late morning/afternoon. Waiters are quick and friendly. Decorations are amusing. Large portions, omelettes are pretty large.  Maybe I'll make a biscuit fly next time."}
{"text":"The food here was great. This was my first time coming here. I ordered the salmon scramble with their grits and it was great! The grits were creamy and delicious. Our server was Mason and he was wonderful.  He was very attentive to us and other tables as well. I appreciated the great customer service.  I will definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"Omg the food was so good!! I got the breakfast bowl and it was yummy!! The grits were so great!! I also got a Sid of collar greens and I was prefect!! Will definitely go again and try something else"}
{"text":"4.5 stars!  This was one of my favorite places to eat.  My manager and I stopped in for breakfast.  I opted for the Smoked Salmon Scramble with Dill Cream Cheese and Creamy Grits.  YUM!    The biscuit was \"AHHHH-MAZING\".  I ate the biscuit LAYER by LAYER.  Delicious!"}
{"text":"Went there Sunday for breakfast at 10:30AM and there was a line for a table but we went straight to the counter and got seating there immediately.  The two of us shared a fantastic crazy breakfast (I hate normal breakfast food) of the spinach pasta dish.  It was a crazy mix of penne pasta, cooked fresh spinach, cheese and spicy sausage - SOOOO GOOD!!!  Came with huge biscuit with applebutter and fab grits.  We shared and were charged a small splitting fee (I think it was two dollars) and they gave us an extra biscuit so we didnt have to split that.  More than enough food - we could barely finish our meals.  The waitstaff is young and unattentive (had to ask for refills on coffee and the check).  But the food is worth it!!!"}
{"text":"Honestly the food is somewhat edible compared to other restaurants in Charlotte but definitely leaning towards the lower end of things. On top of that the customer service was horrible, there were three other people that received their food before us. Then for some strange reason we kept getting stared at by several people that worked there. The whole experience was very uncomfortable. Also I saw one of the waiters laughing at me once I voiced my concerns to management.."}
{"text":"We were looking for a quick bite before a long road trip and discovered The Flying Biscuit. One of my friends in our party of 3 is vegetarian/almost vegan and she was thrilled to find a place that had a menu where she had a lot of choices. They offer soysage and lots of other health food options. I don't know much about grits being from the North, but these grits were amazing. So amazing, that my friend ordered a side of them after trying mine. The server was super fast and super friendly, we had no issues even with our special requests and substitutions.  The biscuit itself wasn't super buttery/greasy like most biscuits; it was real good.  All-in-all this place was a win, especially if you're looking for healthier/vegetarian options!"}
{"text":"Come with an empty stomach, because probs here are large (too large in my opinion, as 3 of our 4 person party threw away half of our meals with nowhere to keep leftovers on vacation). As far as menu choices, there is something for everyone. If you come often enough and venture out of your comfort zone, you'll discover a new favorite during every visit. The French toast with raspberry drizzle is a family favorite. I always ask for extra raspberry sauce on the side and split it between my French toast and biscuit. It's delicious on the biscuit! The chicken sausage has a bit of a kick, as a warning to all who aren't fans of somewhat fiery food. There is a lot of salt and butter in the grits, which is likely why it tastes so amazing. My husband likes to drizzle a little maple syrup on his grits, but I prefer it as is. I was with a party of 10, and everyone enjoyed their breakfast. When you top off the excellent food with exemplary service and a nice ambiance, you simply can't go wrong."}
{"text":"My, My, My....we need one of these in my local area. We went around 10 on a Saturday morning and were seated really fast. Everything we tried here was GREAT. I went with high flyer breakfast, which consist of eggs, grits, an oatmeal pancake, chicken sausage, and a biscuit. The grits were unlike any I have had before, and we're delicious. I see why call them creamy dreamy. The oatmeal pancake was different and tasted good as well. The grilled mac and cheese was also really good also when I sampled. The service was good, nothing spectacular but no complaints. The prices are very reasonable here for the amount of food and quality that you get. The Flying Biscuit hit the spot!"}
{"text":"I have tried the Flying Biscuit at different locations and I usually enjoy the food very much. However, my recent experience at this location was below average. The french toast was very dry and I almost wondered if it was just toast versus french toast. The potatoes that came with the omelette entree were very salty and I was unable to finish it. Not impressed with this location."}
{"text":"Do not go during lunch. The waitress spent all of her time on one table and left the other ones out to dry. The food was room temperature and the potatoes were cold. The services was the worst service that I have had in a long time. I will not eat there again."}
{"text":"An absolutely awesome breakfast experience. I met a few friends here and I was amazed at the food and service. I don't want to say it too loud but this breakfast is kicking moms old fashion Saturday mornings from the past to a close second. Keep up the great work."}
{"text":"Three cheers for another brunch food place!!!  I have been to other Flying Biscuit Cafes before and there is a reason for the wait.  This location in Park Road Shopping Center was just as yummy!  I arrived late Sunday morning.  The massive amount of people standing outside was a bit deceiving, since the wait was only 20 minutes...but the inside was deceivingly large!  You would never be able to tell from the small outside entrance.  The host and waitress were both very pleasant.  Service in getting our food was really slow, but the waitress kept the coffee flowing and was checking in on us.  She tried and I'm sure they were backed up in the kitchen, but a 30 minute wait for food after our order was placed was a bit much.  Once we got the food, it was great.  My eggs, sausage and potatoes were cooked perfectly.  I also got a short stack of chocolate chip pancakes, which came with two large pancakes.  Yeah, so I may have gone a bit overboard...don't judge.  With all that being said (and all that food being consumed), the winner was certainly the biscuit.  There is a reason this word is in their name.  Biscuits were CLEARLY made from scratch, super huge and were slightly sweet with sugar dusted on top.  I could probably just come back for the biscuit, but I'm definitely going to eat my way through the menu on Saturday and Sunday mornings.  Word to the wise...GO EARLY!!!"}
{"text":"Maybe it was the time of the day (2:00p) or the reviews were so awesome but I can't say I fell in love.  The food came out really, really quickly but that meant my appetizers, biscuits, salad and entree all came within 3 minutes of each other.  The black bean cakes tasted like black beans mashed into cakes.  I had such high anticipation for the biscuit was it was more doughy than flaky and buttery.  The apple butter that came with it was unremarkable.  My oven fried chicken was dry.  My mac and cheese kinda tasted like it came from a cafeteria and the collards were tasteless.  My friend's shrimp and grits were okay but can't say she finished much of her plate.  Must say, I've had much better brunch!"}
{"text":"Flying Biscuit is huge and the place is packed.  The popularity is deserved.  Flying Biscuit ain't perfect, but there is a lot to like.  It is a new wave cool \"light\" approach to Southern basics.  Out with the pork. In with the chicken and turkey.  More salads. Cappucino if you want it.  But this is still Southern food, through and through.   Everything comes with a biscuit, and it is one big fat filling biscuit.  You will waddle out of there just from the biscuit, never mind the ton of other stuff that is on your plate.  It is not my favorite biscuit on the planet - but it is in the top half definitely.  Crumbles more than I like, and not meant to have that much taste.  (It is for your gravy, your poached egg or for the apple butter that is on every table).  I scarfed mine down plenty fast, so my objections could not have been that serious.  My main dish was a fried egg salad.  (Yup, this is the new light cuisine, not Grama's southern).  The salad had two huge slices of turkey bacon, two fried eggs, moondusted potatoes, chipotle aioli AND balsamic vinaigrette on my greens.  Salad? You betcha. Italian supermodel wisp food? No way!  I loved the combo.   Fried egg salads? Their time has come. You can give those to me anytime.  The ingredients themselves? They ranged from A to B+.  Turkey bacon may be lighter than bacon bacon - but this is North Carolina.  Legendary food comes from pigs. It does not come from turkeys.  Moondusted potatoes were pleasant and there was some sort of spice to them. I am still not sure what moondust is, but the sauteing was nice.  The fried eggs? Perfect for a salad. Stayed firm on top of the salad but the yolk covered all the salad leaves nicely. Thumbs up here.  My wife's salmon and eggs were perfectly fine.  This place is not for vegans or for people trying to lose weight.  Everything has cheese, or butter, or gravy with milk.  Servings are massive; food is hearty.  Chicken sausage is still sausage   (and if you are doing sausage anyway, pork sausage is oh-so-good).  But I rolled out of Flying Biscuit pretty happy.   I was too full to walk, so my wife had to roll me out like a barrel.  (Okay, I just lied, but I was both full - and full of calories - no doubt about that.)   When I am back in Carolina, I will continue my search for the perfect breakfast -   and the perfect biscuit.   That breakfast will involve actual pork, no question on that front.   But I would not object to another meal or six at the Flying Biscuit.  The place has its charms."}
{"text":"I had been dying to try this place and finally did when I needed to kill some time before work one Friday morning. After all of the stellar reviews I have read, I have to say I was a little underwhelmed and slightly disappointed at my experience.  It was definitely busy, but I did not have to wait for a table as it sounds like it's much busier on the weekends then during the week.    The service was not great by any means, as it took at least 10 minutes for someone to even notice I had sat down and was waiting for any kind of service... a water and wait would have been fine, but not so much the case.  Once I finally got someone's attention to come to my table, I went ahead and ordered drinks and food as I didn't want to be sitting there who knows how long till they came back.  My food did come quickly, but my table didn't have butter or jam like every other table did so it took me a good 5 minutes to get someone's attention to tell them, the lady looked at me and said ok (fairly annoyed)... she never came back.  She actually went behind the bar area and started talking to another waiter.  I got so annoyed that I got up and walked to a table several tables away and snagged some jam and butter off of there.  To be honest if this review was based off of service they would get a one star.  Ok enough about the service you're really worried about the food, so here. we. go.... I went with the traditional flying biscuit breakfast (I think it's the first choice on the menu). Eggs, sausage, grits and biscuit.  Eggs were made as requested and hot when they came out. The chicken sausage was ok, it was in patty form and was a bit chewy. The biscuit was more on the sweet side with the colored sugar sprinkled on top. I'm more a fan of the savory/buttery biscuits, opposed to sweet ones; however with that being said it was perfectly baked, the texture, the flakey layers, etc... it was baked to perfection, I will give them that! Finally the cheesy grits that are a big ta da around these parts... they were very yummy, I enjoyed them. Can't say they were my favorite but I can see why people enjoy them. Overall I'm going to say it was just OK.  I liked the atmosphere good music and open floor space brought a lively feel to the restaurant.  Seemed like there was some limited but additional seating towards the back.  There is a bar so you can enjoy your adult beverages for brunch with your meal!  They had so many other options, like scrambles and such that were pretty unique so I think I'll go a little more off the beaten path next time I come back on the food side!"}
{"text":"Omg!! Was I lucky to have a cancelled flight that resulted in my staying overnight in Charlotte! I needed to find breakfast and I found love! The flying biscuit was a vegetarian dream for breakfast! The place was packed, though. It was bright and colorful and the tables are arranged to get the most out of the space so don't try to take a really big group there because you'll need to wait. I ordered the pancake of the day; had nuts and bananas, along with the tofu scramble, creamy grits and of course a fluffy biscuit with a side of apple butter! I was so upset I was on a time crunch and didn't have time to eat everything but baby... it was all so good! The grits were thick enough to hold on your spoon and creamy and rich. The tofu scramble had fresh peppers and onions and some kind of seasoning or marinade that tied it all together, perfectly! The biscuit?? The biscuit was about four or five inches high! The apple butter was the perfect condiment for it, too! How did they know?? I barely finished the pancake, as it was as big as the plate it came on! I have no friends or family in Charlotte, so I don't know when I'll be back, but whenever I am fortunate enough to be near this place, I plan to fill up, Flying Biscuit style!"}
{"text":"The coffee was hot. All coffee drinkers know what I mean. The food was seasoned to perfection. The service is great, very attentive. If you are a breakfast person yu will love this place."}
{"text":"Always extremely friendly! My girlfriend and I go here every Sunday before church. They have THE best biscuits you'll ever have and they are vegetarian and vegan friendly :)"}
{"text":"This was my first time here, but definitely not my last!!!! Went there on a Sunday - so prime-time for brunch crowd. The wait for a table of two was not long. I don't even think it was 20mins.   Atmosphere: Very eclectic decor and fast pace. Lots of people talking, staff moving around. Quirky art-work on the walls. I like!  Food. Went there with a friend and we couldn't decide what to get for the longest time. Well, while waiting to be seated I had my mind set on something, which I totally didn't order.  I had the Biscuits, Eggs and Gravy. Oh boy! My friend raved about their homemade chicken sausage, but I was craving savory gravy at first didn't realize it had bits of chicken sausage in it until it came out....yes it does state on the menu *facepalm*. Total win, when my plate arrived! Those biscuits are worth all the hype! I was thinking of perhaps ordering a side to bring home, but nooo, got to lay low on the carbs! Maybe i'll bring some home now for thanksgiving :) I'm new to the world of \"Grits\", I liked their grits, wouldn't know what \"bad\" ones would taste like though.   I ordered water and coffee. The staff were attentive and refilled before I even noticed it was getting low. Plus points! Our waiter was super friendly and told us not to forget their homemade butter! Delish!  My friend ordered the Egg-stravaganza. My original pick was to try their french toast, but yah! didn't order, so my friend was nice enough to have me taste hers. The french toast topped with  homemade raspberry sauce and honey crème anglaise was good. They used whole-wheat toast. As a spoiled new yorker who loves diners, I was hoping for thick challah bread for the french-toast, but the whole wheat made this tasty dish sound healthy...even just a little.  Loved our whole brunch experience and will definitely come back! only star deduction because parking sucks a little - acknowledging it was brunch rush-hour, still...come early - park safer, none of those crazies that zoom through the lot."}
{"text":"Not only is the service always on point but our food never ever disappoints. A definite go to is the customary biscuit and Applebutter which I could swim in a pool of, it is THAT good. The macaroni and cheese here is among the best I have ever had, home cooked or restaurant quality and nothing beats their breakfast food. Our food is always served hot and with minimal wait. The staff is very accommodating even during busy times. You've got to try the Eggstravaganza, the creamy dreamy grits & moon dusted potatoes are truly out of this world."}
{"text":"I love the Flying Biscuit.  It has a great Neighborhood Joint feel to it and it is consistent.  My wife and I have been in groups of 5+ and I've been by myself for a quick lunch.  We have been there for an early breakfast, late lunch or with the serious weekend rush at 10am on a Saturday morning.   The staff is always polite and the kitchen turns the food around quickly.  I tend to order the same thing every time and it's like they have a Xerox machine back there... the dish comes out the same every time.  The food is pretty standard diner fare, with a few signature items.  The biscuits, of course, are special.  They are HUGE and lean more towards a shortcake to me (add some macerated strawberries and fresh cream... serious desert opportunity here, FBC!) but they are very tasty and always fresh.  There is a delicious cranberry apple butter (made in-house) on the table that goes perfectly w/ the biscuits.  Their grits are also outstanding... one of the few places where I enjoy grits."}
{"text":"Our waiter, James, totally ignored us. We were a group of seven - after getting us water, we were basically forgotten. We got coffee - eventually. We got cream - eventually. We had to ask him after 30-45 minutes if we could order. He brought us our order, but didn't return to ask how anything was. My friend was out of coffee for almost the entire meal. The foodrunners and host did a better job than this waiter.  I had the pumpkin french toast with biscuits - oh, and James didn't bring us any jam for our biscuits, either (guess this should be renamed The PLAIN Biscuit) - and while the food was all right, it absolutely did not warrant the huge line outside when we left. All in all, we sat there for almost two hours - this was not due to any extra chatting on our part, it just took that long for James to get his act together.  I won't be suggesting this when my friends and I go out for brunch... and we LOVE brunch!"}
{"text":"I would definitely come back here. The food is great, I had there pumpkin pancakes and a biscuit with gravy and both were awesome. There service decent but they forgot my silverware and there wasn't enough sugar on the table. Both fixable things. There coffee is medium  in strength which is better then most. They will also cook to order which is great. I don't eat much and I hate wasting food so I was able to order a single pancake and a single biscuit.  Over all I do recommend it."}
{"text":"This would be my only breakfast spot if I lived in Charlotte!  The food, service, atmosphere, attentiveness, and overall vibe here is phenomenal.   Our server was so knowledgeable about the menu and helpful in crafting the perfect breakfast plate.   The grits are definitely special! The chicken sausage is the best I've ever had!!  Go here... Thank me later."}
{"text":"YUM YUM YUM! This is one of my favorite places to have brunch and when my parents are in town they always insist on going here."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast on Memorial Day! It was busy, but we only had to wait about 15 minutes for a table! Was a little disappointed to see things like chicken sausage, soysage, turkey bacon, and tofu on the menu.. Not really into all that hipster stuff! Ended up getting the Southern Egg Scramble, which was really good! The grits was by far the best I've ever had! Service was decent, but our server was very rushed and busy. I would go back for the grits!"}
{"text":"The menu selection is huge and there are many items I would want to come back and try, such as the blueberry pancakes and chicken scramble with roasted red peppers and feta cheese.  I settled on the eggs benedict and the unusual ingredient was the pimento cheese, which added a nice punch of flavor, and I loved the turkey bacon.  I agree with other reviewers though on the biscuit, considering it's the namesake it was.....just okay (a little too dry at the ends).  My pumpkin latte was a nice treat."}
{"text":"So this WAS my time trying out this restaurant. I was NOT HAPPY!! I only went there because it was next to the bakery. YOU KNOW WHAT GOT( GETS) UNDER SKIN?? WHEN I HAND SOMEONE MY CARD OR MONEY IN THEIR HAND AND THE PUT MY CHANGE OR CARD ON THE COUNTER!!! It's customer service 101!!! I'm standing right there hand it to me in my hand THE SAME WAY I GIVE IT TO YOU!!   THE PHONE CALL: I ordered over the phone, the lady who take my order was nice. She helped me with the food prices and other questions I had  THE PICK UP: Well all I can say was I felt rushed. I guess she was busy... no one helped her out ..WHAT HAPPEN TO TEAM WORK! Plus she put my money on the counter   THE FOOD: I ordered the Vegan Tofu BBQ wrap... I must have asked for extra salt times 3!! The wrap would have been good it was just to SALTY!! My co-worker order  the chicken salad that is $10 bucks ... well her salad looked like a side salad with chicken. My side with my Vegan Tofu was a salad... WHICH I HAD MORE MY SALAD THEN MY CO-WORKER AND HERS WAS A MEAL NOT A SIDE SALAD!!"}
{"text":"James is a wonderful server! Great food, fat service, never an empty glass or cup, and so nice! Travis is another favorite! Everything tastes great. Casual for kids!"}
{"text":"Oh I have found the mecca of breakfast. On my quest to fill my grumbling tummy, I stumbled upon this gem. Tucked away in the Park Road Shopping center, the beast called Hunger was slated. After indulging in the Southern Scramble, eggs scrambled with spicy Collard greens and turkey Bacon, I will be scribbling sonnets about their creamy dreamy grits."}
{"text":"So I was visiting North Carolina and even though I have friends who lived here they still wanted me to chose where to eat ? Lol so I was scrolling and the name caught my eye. So we come here and it's really upbeat welcoming and colorful. I got the eggs Benedict and it was delicious!! I wish they had a place like this near me!"}
{"text":"Visited on 1/28 with a party of 3. It's always super crowded, but they get you seated in a timely manner.   Two of us ordered the salmon scrambled and one ordered sausage, eggs, grits and French toast. I would recommend this place to anyone. The staff is friendly and the food is good."}
{"text":"Apparently there are two of these restaurants and this rating is for this one. Creative culinary creations are sure to satisfy everyone. Breakfast served all day and the atmosphere is very chill for a strip mall restaurant."}
{"text":"They are billed as the home of the creamiest dreamiest grits and they do not disappoint. The service is awesome and if you wander in lost and not sure what to get their delicious menu and well educated staff can help you out. This is a definite go to place for breakfast, brunch or lunch."}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE it!! One of my favorite places to eat in Charlotte. Seriously everything I've eaten has been great!"}
{"text":"Came here on a whim... relocating to NC and wanted to check out the local fare... place was packed (expected for a Sunday) waiting wasn't too bad and our server, Ken? From Ohio (is what I can remember) was great.  He was clearly slammed with other tables and customers but when he did get to us, he was pleasant.  Food was ok... a bit heavy and rich for me but can understand why it's a local favorite."}
{"text":"Had a really great breakfast experience here recently. They have outdoor tables, so you can enjoy some wonderful al fresco dining. The place itself is quite colorful, spacious, and comfortably designed, and the food was fantastic. I ordered the scrambled eggs, and it came with a healthy dose of turkey bacon, as well as grits and an absolutely delicious, fresh from the oven biscuit (which covered with apple butter is even better), and an oatmeal pancake with peach compote. It was all-around delicious and an incredibly satisfying, reasonably-priced breakfast. My only complaint would be that it took a while to get and to process the check, but I guess I'll overlook that given how generally satisfying I thought the experience was."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! My fiance said \"it's like they asked me what I wanted to eat and put it on the menu\".  If you are not a beef or pork eater this is the perfect place!  A lot of their items are made with turkey.  Finally!!! I know it's the south, but it seems like  beef and pork, especially bacon have been forced on the public by the producers.  Anywho, the food is amazing, and worth the 30 minute drive from our house."}
{"text":"If you haven't been to the Biscuit yet, you have done yourself a great disservice. I have been here about a hundred times and have had just about everything on the menu and I never had a bad meal here. The steak and eggs are nothing short of phenomenal and the biscuits are out of this world. Run, don't walk to the Biscuit for breakfast. Make sure to get there early, or you'll find yourself waiting in a long line!  This place lives up to the hype."}
{"text":"omg!!! this place is awesome! food is amazing. it is a must. our server taylor she was awesome as well. it was our first time here and the experience was great. we will be back."}
{"text":"So....my experience was ok! Let me say first that the grits...the grits! Those grits were good... heavenly indeed! There are lots of good breakfast options, but a bit expensive for the quality. The flying biscuits biscuit is actually nice too, unlike anything I've had anywhere else, flaky and different to the regular biscuits you get for breakfast. Besides that, everything else was mediocre. The dusted potatoes were overdone and so hard we could not finish them. The eggs reminded me of stuff that is made without real eggs...not worth what I paid...I could not finish those either. Let's just say I was a bit disappointed, but if all I was going to have were grits...that's what I'll be getting!"}
{"text":"I was visiting from out of town and stopped by due to the advice of a person I sat next to on the plane, who made the biscuits sound magically delicious. The place was packed out the door. So considering the amount of people waiting for a seat, the wait time was actually not bad. Service is quick and efficient but understandably they have no time for chitchat.  I am from Texas, so although our southern BBQ is kick ass, I don't believe there is expertise in making proper grits. It's always been bland, pale,and well, gritty. I had to know what the fuss is about! I got the shrimp and grits with biscuit. Ermagerd, I am now enlightened to the Southern pride associated with grits done right. It was creamy,smooth, and rich without being heavy at all. And no grittiness! I could taste a touch of butter and cheese, but it was the perfect balance to still keep me shoveling in for another heaping spoon. The tomato topping left little pools of oil which I scooped aside, but the shrimp was also done well. Shrimp is so often overlooked, but these remained juicy and tender. And the biscuit was yet another ermagerd moment. Its denseness was along the lines of a scone, but it somehow was fluffy and airy and so moist. Tearing it open is a thing of joy. The edges had a nice crisp and was lightly buttery. Only odd thing to me is it was sprinkled with sugar for a savory dish. But that could easily be scraped off. These were actually finger lickin' good. Next time I'm in town, I have my eye on the pot pie."}
{"text":"It's just as delicious as everyone says! Try the fried chicken and the shrimp and grits!"}
{"text":"Fast service and delicious food!! Came for Sunday breakfast on our way back up to DC after a Panthers game and it totally hit the spot!!"}
{"text":"This proves 5 stars is impossible on Yelp because this place deserves 5+.   Perfect scratch made food, great atmosphere (busy but spacious), and excellent friendly service!    We had a perfect Sunday breakfast and got coffees to go at no additional charge!"}
{"text":"Went to this place for an early dinner (4pm) yesterday and had a nice experience. Our waitress was very cheerful and attentive, and the decor is comfy while being bright :)  We split the black bean cakes w/ feta, onions and tomatillo sauce and they were ok - the patties are not cooked in any way, which I wasn't expecting.  I ordered the Fried Green Tomato BLT with a side salad and it was very good. I did have to ask for some of their Red Pepper Aioli sauce to add some ZING to my sandwich but the side salad's balsamic was one of the best I've ever had! My friend got the shrimp quesadilla and it didn't look impressive to me, but he said it was good.  Overall, I'd go back to try a biscuit at least! :)"}
{"text":"We were told a 15 minute wait and it was almost an hour to get seated, and then almost 30 minutes to get food. Food was pretty good but service sucks."}
{"text":"I ordered the southern style biscuit benedict with a side of creamy dreamy grits which were both fantastic. The biscuit comes cut in half and each topped with a poached egg, pimento cheese, turkey bacon, hollandaise sauce and garnished with basil. I would most definitely order this again. The biscuit was fluffy and flaky. Nothing better than a perfectly poached egg for breakfast.   Wait can start increasing later in the morning even during weekdays so come early if you want to be seated right away."}
{"text":"Great food great portions great service - just a great place to really enjoy what you eat!!!!   The chicken sausage gravy will make you slap yo momma it's so good the biscuits are large and moist n fluffy the grits creamy and can be eaten just like they arrive at your table so far never disappointed- go for breakfast for sure I guarantee you'll not be disappointed"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Didn't have a wait at all. The best biscuits. And their caramel apple cider mimosa was so good"}
{"text":"Damn you and your spellbinding biscuit black magic! I'm hooked!   This is the epitome of what a breakfast restaurant should be: a few simple fresh ingredients crafted to perfection.   I used to wait in line for a table at the Flying Biscuit locations in Atlanta, so far Charlotte hasn't caught on to their best kept secret. Always a a great dining experience!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I am NOT a fan of biscuits and grits. So when my friend suggested we try this place I was really hesitant to say yes because everything on the menu has biscuits and grits. Anyway, I didn't want to be a downer so I agreed to go, I figured I could just replace them with other things. Our waitress was super helpful and suggested I give the biscuit a try and just replace the grits with potatoes, which I did (btw I got the steak and eggs) When we got our food and I saw the biscuit, it looked amazing and I am happy to say it tasted even better. It wasn't dry like I was expecting, it was so soft and fluffy, I've never had a biscuit like this one. My friend also made me try her grits and to my surprise, they were also amazing! This place has really made me reconsider what I like and reminded me that I always need to try things in different places!"}
{"text":"A perfect find while visiting Charlotte for a wedding with a group of friends.  GREAT menu, especially for veggie lovers and vegans.  Some of the best variety I've seen on a breakfast menu and the colorful, cheery atmosphere is great.  I honestly don't think the biscuits are great and some of the food was overly sauced, but overall awesome place.  Favorite quote of the meal: Me: How do you make the oatmeal pancakes? Waitress: With Oatmeal. My inner thought: Ohhhh ok!  That clears everything right up!"}
{"text":"YUM!  Definitely a great atmosphere and fun decorations!  In a strip mall and somewhat hard to find, but deliciousness ensues once inside!  I've only gone during not so busy times, but the service is great!  Great, delicious vegan options as well! Try the Vegan BBQ burrito!  It's a little bit of heaven in a nice tortilla wrap!  I would recommend this place to anyone looking to soliciting their friends to Charlotte!  Awesome and trendy come to mind!!!  The wait staff have been very friendly and in fun moods and willing to offer legitimate suggestions, which is always a good meal experience for me!  They also off an extensive menu that includes dinner entrees and boast a menu with breakfast all day, so all you brinner people have a great lil haven in Charlotte!!! :)"}
{"text":"I don't know why it is, but I've learned that whenever a restaurant has a particular dish in its name, that's usually the worst item on the menu. Flying Biscuit is no exception. The biscuits are thick, heavy and bland (though that apple butter or whatever sauce is amazing and helps things out a lot). So don't go expecting a big flaky delish biscuit.  But for breakfast, it's pretty hard to go wrong. I went on an early Saturday afternoon and had the Clifton omelette, with goat cheese, mushrooms and tomato, and it was just as good as it sounds. Hubby got the Piedmont and left not a speck on the plate. Service was a bit slow and unresponsive, and it wasn't even very busy. The waittress was young, but she just didn't seem very interested in serving or filling water or earning a tip? Still, neither the chicken nor the biscuit will dissuade me from stopping in again. Good deal--especially if you check in on 4square. Can I say that?"}
{"text":"Thank you @theflyingbiscuitclt for a wonderful brunch and the super fantastic waitress we had only being her 3rd day there she was magnificent. Ed loved her called her a #southern #bronxgirl she was refreshing and wonderful. Just her attitude alone made me want to come back. The food now was off the charts goosebumps good . There's nothing on the menu that's not good. Now the drinks are also Kick-Ass. We will definitely be regular customers. Hire more people like that it was fantastic customer experience. #chefbella #food #foodie #greatplacetoeat"}
{"text":"Turkey meatloaf sandwich...sounded great...then I bit into the dry, crumbly, cardboard flavored whole wheat, vegan, gluten free flavor missing bun.  In all honesty - it isn't a healthy restaurant - ditch the wheat buns, tone down the salt on the potatoes and I'll give it another try.   On the up side - phenomenal location!"}
{"text":"I need to tell you first that my boyfriend and I were returning to Charlotte after a weekend trip to NYC. Since he has relocated to the area from California, I thought it would be fun to hit the reknown \"Flying Biscuit Cafe\" for breakfast (early early return flight). I had never been there, but have friends that rave. Anyway, the menu offers few truly healthy choices, but he was able to pick something. I picked the most popular breakfast platter. Can't remember the name, it's literally the first one on the menu. Anyway, my eggs were so-so, the chicken sausage disgusting (dry yet greasy???) and the biscuit was a little hard. I thought, \"What is all the fuss about?\" We were seated outside pretty quickly and the wait staff was pretty efficient and friendly. Anyway, I've had better (not just in NYC which blows this area away) so I most likely won't return."}
{"text":"This place is great! We are new to the area and heard tell of the long lines, but on two different weekends we've arrived around 9-10am and had no problem getting a table. Later on though, you definitely see the list getting longer and longer. THE GRITS, YOU GUYS. I could literally eat a bucket of them. Like I think I could win some kind of grits eating contest with them.   There are a lot of options and creative dishes beyond your usual breakfast fare.   One of the best things is we had our 10 month old with us and it is super kid friendly. We didn't feel awkward having him there, which you can certainly feel is the vibe with some other places."}
{"text":"This place is fun!   I do not eat pork so I like that everything comes with turkey bacon or their homemade chicken sausage. They have breakfast potatoes that have a good seasoning on them. Obviously you can get pork bacon if you want. Only complaint about the turkey bacon is was more like jerky!   The wait looked deceiving as we got seated pretty quick on a Sunday at 10a."}
{"text":"Disappointing. Strip mall bad; decor atrocious; Friday green tomato sandwich flavor overload - turkey bacon, cashew jalapeño sweet relish, goat cheese, fried green tomato and I asked to have it on a biscuit instead of a bun. The biscuit was dry and had sugar on top - weird! The macaroni and cheese sticks and potatoes next to the sandwich were better. They cut pieces of mac&cheese and browned them in a skillet - nice touch. Overall, on this one yelp let us down."}
{"text":"Flying Biscuit sounded like a promising place to eat breakfast during our recent visit to Charlotte."}
{"text":"While I didn't love this place, food-wise, I have to say the ambiance was great. I enjoyed the cloud-painted wall, the strings of lights, the cool paintings towards the rear, and the actual flying biscuit yellow and orange wall paper. Plus I'm a fan of garage door style walls like the one that made up this storefront. I'm not sure why but it reminds me of SoCal and makes a place feel so much more open and airy, even when it is closed!  We specifically ordered their unusuals--the inside out (crustless, really) pot pie and the grilled mac and cheese. It was going to be an extremely foodful day and were were hoping to start light. Oh well. With just those two items ordered, we were both unfortunately full after our visit. And while I didn't care for the pot stuffing (not enough veggies, too much potato), the biscuits (just didn't like the taste or texture, not my style at all), or the mac and cheese soufflé (too eggy/soft, not enough substance), my dining companion thought the pot pie and biscuit was the best best dish of the day (and we had about six meals that day). He really liked the practical and unique nature of the pie filling as well as how freakishly tall the biscuit was. Flying indeed!"}
{"text":"This was our first time here but won't be our last! The food was really good, waitstaff was very friendly and getting our food didn't take long. My only negative comment would be that it was very very hot inside. I typically don't like to break a sweat at breakfast so this made us rush a little faster to eat and get out. The temp is controlled by the weather since they open the garage door in the front and all that is left is a large screen. (There's no bugs if you're worried about being exposed to the outside) but this place would be PHENOMENAL in the spring or fall :) even winter here in the south."}
{"text":"We ordered the egg extravaganza to share with side of fruit. I also tried their peach nectar. Place is very decorative and cute inside. Food came out fast. They only serve turkey bacon here I think. I much prefer the regular bacon. They make their own jam sauce here that they have in a jar on every table. The fruit they had in season was grape, melon, and pineapple. Portion of fruit was small for $4. Overall food was ok. First time here since we had a layover at airport so decided to explore Charlotte."}
{"text":"I'm not convinced this place is as wonderful as everyone in Charlotte seems to think it is, but Flying Biscuit is a solid entry on the breakfast/brunch market nonetheless. My biggest complaint about the place is that their biscuits really aren't anything special. Hard to believe at a place with biscuit in their name, right?!   I usually order a scramble of some sort. The veggie one is good and fresh, wanting for a little bit of seasoning. I've tried the turkey bacon and grits on different visits. Both were just ok.   If you don't get there before 9:30am on the weekend, expect to wait. The guy at the front (if you've been there, you know the one... with the awesome mustache) is always nice, welcoming you, opening the door for everyone, etc. I like that they have a huge space heater outside for the wait in winter months.   Service is very hit or miss. We've had super attentive servers on some visits and literally had to hunt someone down to pay on others.   Overall, a good, (usually) quick spot for a fresh breakfast but still working on consistency, I think."}
{"text":"Not impressed at all. I read so many great reviews so disappointment is an understatement. Had the pasta and sausage scramble, grits and biscuit. Pasta scramble was so bland it was unbelievable. Grits were ok, but had a rancid aftertaste to them, and biscuit was far too doughy. Also tried the Cajun chicken scramble, the only flavorful part was the sun dried tomatoes however they overpowered the dish. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Why is southern food so amazingly delicious?! I have yet to be let down by any authentic southern dining experience and Flying Biscuit Cafe is no different! We tried coming here a few times to be turned off by the wait but if only I knew how satisfying the meal would be, I'd wait days   The atmosphere is awesome, very colorful and inviting. It reminded me of a cafe I used to work in during college and brought back so many great memories!   I ordered the tradition breakfast I believe it was called. Omg I had no idea how much food was about to be put in front of me. It was 2 eggs, grits, turkey sausage, a biscuit, and an organic oatmeal pancake. And to add to the crazy amount of food I already had, I decided to order a side of grilled Mac and cheese. Just thinking about it right now, my mouth is watering. The eggs were eggs, hard to mess up. Who knew turkey sausage could be so good compared to the real thing! Biscuit was out of this world, just fell apart and melted in my mouth. The grits were also something to note, so creamy and so cheesy, my favorite! The pancake was fantastic and didn't even need syrup. And finally, the Mac and cheese...I could eat this all day everyday. They were just the right amount of grilled and greasy enough to enjoy the fatness.   I can not wait to go and try some more of the endless items on the menu!!"}
{"text":"So beyond yummy. Though a chain, I've been here and to another in Atlanta and they're consistently great. The menu is huge and varied and definitely have something for everyone. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Love Flying Biscuit!!! Nothing like a great breakfast on a beautiful Saturday morning!! Love the grits, chicken gravy and turkey bacon!!!"}
{"text":"This place is always packed which is an indicator on how good the food is. Be prepared to wait if you come for brunch.  The Southern Egg Benedict is SO GOOD! You can mix and match sides from the breakfast & lunch side. Also, breakfast is SERVED ALL DAY! ALL DAY!! Whether you're eating breakfast or lunch, I highly recommend trying the grilled mac & cheese. The grits are called \"creamy dreamy\" and they definitely live up to the name.   Nom nom nom"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to have some southern breakfast and this little family owned joint was spot on.  It was very busy but we only waited 15 minutes or so and I was excited to try some of the things I read on yelp.  The grits here were delicious!! The breakfast was like any normal breakfast... Eggs sausage.. But the grits were so cheesy and creamy!! It really was the most unexpected deliciousness. The biscuit was a little dry and the butter that everyone talked about was more of a jam and in a squeezable tube.  Did not live up to the hype. The grits made my experience!!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a breakfast place in Charlotte, head over to the Flying Biscuit. This has to be one of my favorite breakfast places in Charlotte. Everything is pretty much homemade, from their biscuits to sausage gravy. So far I haven't had a mean that disappoints. My suggestions would be the Breakfast Bowl, Biscuits and Gravy, & the Turkey Hash. The Turkey Hash has extremely tender turkey over top of a bed of potatoes. The Breakfast Bowl not only looks pretty, it tastes pretty amazing too; 2 eggs over 2 fried green tomatoes over a bed of creamy grits with salsa. The great news is they sell Breakfast all day! The location in Charlotte is always packed but they cycle through people pretty quickly. A great place to bring visitors or just a good Sunday morning brunch! They also cater, so consider it when deciding on a Breakfast caterer, it's a great choice that the office will love."}
{"text":"One of the best southern breakfast we've ever had. Stopping looking for breakfast options, you found it. Claudia, our waitress, was so friendly and helpful. Never visit Charlotte, but when we do, we're not looking for another place to \"try\"."}
{"text":"Delicious food and delicious coffee, get there early. Show it's a great community in this restaurant will not disappoint"}
{"text":"Been here with the wife a couple of times. The wait can be tough on the weekends. My wife is a bigger breakfast fan than I am. I'm usually the one who prefers to eat light at home for breakfast and have a nice lunch out. But every now and then you want to try new things, so we gave the flying biscuit a shot.   We both enjoyed our food and noticed that a lot of the dishes had a more healthy twist to them. I think that I'll enjoy the flying biscuit when I'm in the mood for it, but I think that my wife and I are more traditionalists when it comes to breakfast. She's a big fan of bacon and I tend to enjoy pork sausage. I do remember enjoying the pancakes and she enjoyed the grits, but outside of that I think I'm more in my comfort zone at Waffle House or ihop.  But the service is terrific and the food is done well. I'd come back if I was craving that type of breakfast."}
{"text":"Came here specifically because they supposedly had extensive gluten free options. About half if the items on the menu are marked as \"gluten free\" but the once I started questioning the server I learned that there is no dedicated prep area and the majority of the \"gluten free\" items are made on the same surface as their regular-full of gluten-pancakes.  Needless to say we left. They did earn one extra star for at least admitting that their gluten free menu is really only for those who have mild issues with gluten and that it isn't safe for celiacs"}
{"text":"I like the food here and usually come every few weeks with friends. However, the service staff is always rude or disinterested and it makes the experience awkward.   Today, l came in before 3 and didn't realize that the closing time was earlier because it was Monday. The short male server took us to the table set the menu down and said \"you better hurry up because we close in three minutes\" before walking away.  I left because I'd never intentionally come in so close to closing. I won't return again because I'm not paying you to be rude every time I come to your restaurant. There are plenty of other places much closer to NoDa, so don't waste a trip to Park Rd for this shit"}
{"text":"It's funny how you think a cool hip place is gonna have this stellar food and it's just meh? Like wow this was a dud...  Went here today for brunch and we all got breakfast items. I guess with a name like flying biscuits you're expecting amazing biscuits right?, well these were not. I mean I guess they were not terrible but they were not soft and fluffy like they looked. The sausage is very dense too and hard to cut with a fork. Most sausage I've made at home slices easily with a fork, I'm not sure why theirs did not but it was strange? The grits however are super tasty because it has a lot of butter but who cares it was very good. I got a latte but it had too much steamed milk, i was not a fan. The sledgehammer was much better and is basically a breve, which is what I make at home all the time.   I don't know what to tell you folks, maybe their lunch meals are better than breakfast but I don't think I'll chance it again to find out. The flying biscuit gets an official rating of Meh in my book. On to the next one!"}
{"text":"This was our 1st visit & we were very impressed.  Even on a busy Sunday morning the wait was only about 15 minutes.  This location has only been here about two years but have definitely got a following.  We understand why!  Hubba-bubba got the orange-infused whole wheat french toast with a biscuit on the side.  The french toast was scrumptious!  I'm sure people swear by their biscuits, but I wasn't a big fan of them.  I did like that they have apple butter on the table, that was a nice touch...not quite my fave apple butter from Liverpool, PA, but unexpected & delightful in Charlotte, NC!    I got the High Flyer & fell in love with their creamy & yes they are butter-dreamy grits.  I liked the oatmeal pancake, but it could have even been a bit smaller as it is a very dense \"pancake\".    The service was as excellent as the food.  We are very happy to have found a new breakfast place that is low-key excellence!  Their decor is fun and bright without being overwhelming or kitschy.  They also have a front, sidewalk patio & a back balcony patio.  I think they have free wi-fi, too!  They also have an excellent Mocha!  That was delicious & served in a big-sized coffee cup.  For two breakfasts, our individual drinks & a to-go drink it was $25.  We liked the rest of the menu & look forward going back for lunch or dinner.  Yay for Flying Biscuit Cafe'."}
{"text":"Oh. My. Yum. I love this place so much! Even though there's always a wait on the weekends, it's totally worth it (and you'll only wait about 20 mins)! Get the Southern Style Benedict.. It'll change your life."}
{"text":"Takeout regular, the grits ARE dreamy and I love the turkey bacon, sausage. The chocolate bread pudding is new twist to it too. Recommend greatly."}
{"text":"One of my fave go to places for great breakfast. My favorite is Ballantyne,  Jasmine is at Park Road.  She is amazing Hostess.  Great biscuit and gravy,  Eggs scrambled soft with cheese,  Cranberry sauce really good on Oatmeal pancake for a sweet treat."}
{"text":"My manager wanted to treat lunch today using Foodie Call, the team ordered the BLT with turkey bacon and goat cheese and 2 side orders of green tomatoes.  Well it was not at all the flavor of the description, the potatoes were cold and bland, as well as everything else.  No cutlery, ketchup, naps, etc. was packed.  The side of green tomatoes was four (4) thin cut for 6.99; my manager was refunded the cost of lunch, thank you.  I gave two (2) stars for delivery and  refund."}
{"text":"Another one of my favorite spots in Charlotte. I had the turkey hash today, and it was PERFECT. Turkey with gravy on top of roasted potatoes and topped with an over medium egg and melted cheese. Our food came out piping hot, and so was the coffee. The turkey hash looked so delicious when it came out that I accidentally cut into it before snapping a picture! I was ready to dig in, and ended up stuffing my face! The biscuit with apple butter is one of my favorite things about the Flying Biscuit, it is definitely one of their staples. Everything comes out tasting homemade and fresh.   Staff is always friendly and service is on point. There is usually a wait here on the weekends during breakfast hours, so we like to go around lunchtime. I also recommend one of the many flavored mimosas and the espresso shot.   ***UPDATE*** I had this place at 5 stars, but had to drop them to 4 when I've recently had poor service here. The last time I went for a late lunch, my server wasn't helpful with the menu at all, acted as if we were taking up too much of her time, and never got a coffee or water refill for the whole sitting."}
{"text":"I love this place for breakfast and lunch. The options are great for a vegetarian and the staff is friendly.  My favorite are the soft & yummy biscuits!!!"}
{"text":"I love that rustic feel. The staff is very hospitable & the food was good and reasonably priced. LXF"}
{"text":"Great brunch/breakfast on a Sunday at around noon. At first, we were a bit disappointed by the 30 minute wait however in retrospect, it was worth it. Where do i start? I suppose we can review the highlights.  *Service - Friendly and quick. Appropriate number of servers, warm older gent outside the restaurant doing a nice job of keeping tabs of the waiting list and accoomodating the different size parties and available seats outside, inside at tables, and inside at the counter. Bravo to him! Wait service was very customer service focused with our waiter bringing an extra biscuit at the same time  the food bringer and he just let us have the extra freee of charge..well there you go, enjoy! We weren't charged for extra delciious little sides or any changes we requested.  They were very accomodating and for the amount of people in there, they were relatively speedy. *Atmosphere- cozy and more room inside than one would think. You can dine outside or inside and come with your family without issue. There was a group of 7 even that was accomodated. Casual and comfortable. You can wear whatever the heck ya please here. *Menu- was very surprised how many choices they had! There were about 15 different breakfast specials of which half were on my \"hmm i would love that!\" List. Our entire party of 4 had a hard time deciding! They have wonderful egg specials, oatmeal pancakes, french toasts, lots of aide dishes ans an ability to subsitute pretty easily. If you want lunch they had a pretty good variety there too with salads, sandwiches and fun lunch options. I would come.back for lunch because the combinations of food sounded amazing! *Food- finally, huh? Ok the food was delicious. Period. I had three scrambled eggs with smoked salmon, and dill cream cheese and added grilled onions (that i saw from another dish that i was torn between) with a side of moon dusted potatoes (which was a subsitute instead of grits) and a biscuit of course. Note that all the breakfast specials  (which are served all day) all come with a biscuit. The biscuits are definitely very good but not amazing  (i guess after you've had Biscuit Head biscuits in Asheville, its a tad unfair to compare with those monstrous mounds of deliciousness ). The eggs were very good and they were geneous with the salmon and such. Potatoes were pretty good but i would have kept the grits as a side if I had known how delciious they were. I tried someone else's at our table and it was incredibly creamy and wonderful. Arguably the best i have ever had. I am not even a big fan of grits but this could change my mind! So to the other reviewer who indicated this was the best he ever had anywhere, we concur (although one person in my party claims to have had better grits at a place in Charleston however admitted this was excellent). As for other dishes, the whole wheat French toast smothered in raspberry compote (as part of Eggstravaganza) was unreal. We asked for extra of that raspberry stuff and layered it on our biscuits and it was TDF. The oatmeal pancakes were also wonderful and very filling. Hearty and super tasty. Another at our table had eggs underneath  smothered biscuits n gravy but it was not normal sausage gravy. It was chicken sausage gravy which was a fantastic alternative to pork (which i dont care for anyway) and was scrumptious and addictive. I believe the chicken sausage is one of their signature sides and is well worth it. They also offer turkey bacon with many of their dishes. This was probably the one item which was subpar in my opinion. It was the dry and chewy almost tasting like jerky. I love good turkey bacon and this was a let down. Please skip this item and order the rest of it because the rest of the food was incredibly good! *Prices - i felt this was a bit overpriced as each breakfast special was about $10 each. Certainly not out of bounds just on the higher side. I would exect 6to8 bucks each. Maybe I am being a little critical.here however even the sides were over $3 each. We dropped  $55 after tax/tip here with 4 people...seems reasonable for lunch but because we had just breakfast items i thought a tad high. *Portions -Generous so it helped justify the price. The biscuits and pancakes were very heavy so tread lightly and share if you're a light eater! I am a heavy eater but my plate plus nibbling from others combined with an iced coffee made me quite full. The women in our party gave upnhalf way through...lol  Wish i could give 4 &  1/2 stars. Everything except the turkey bacon was delish and service and menu were excellent. I would not hesitate to go back and you should go if youre thinking about it. Be prepared to potentially wait....by the way, this is in a busy strip mall.but there is plenty of parking. I suggest you arrive 30 minutes prior to when you would want to sit down just so you can get a table if theyre swamped on a weekend like today.  Bravo to this place though. One of the best breaskfasts/brunches  in all of Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Before our conscious uncoupling with Foodie Call we used to order from Flying Biscuit all the time, but I had not been to the actual establishment until this past weekend. I am so happy I am able to give a 5 star for my 100th review!   Going into it I already knew their food was great. If a restaurant can consistently deliver delicious food offsite I have high expectations for meals that only have to travel from the kitchen to the table.   We arrived a little before 10 am and had no problem getting a table for two out front. The weather was great and sitting outside meant we could hang out with the people who brought their dogs. I had no idea it was a dog friendly establishment and my furry companion will definitely join me next time!   Sitting down I knew I needed coffee and that somehow my order needed to include their chicken sausage patties. I am normally pretty picky about sausage but I love the sausage here. I happily ate both patties by myself. The latte they brought out was beautiful and delicious. I decided to order the turkey hash which is the best brunch dish. Turkey so tender and covered in a delicious sauce that it tastes like a pot roast served over potatoes. The whole thing was topped with two over medium eggs smothered in cheese. Perfection!   The biscuit that came with the meal was soft and warm (it is pretty hard when we had it delivered before so a big improvement). I drowned my biscuit in the delicious apple butter they leave table side for the perfect combination of sweet and savory. Maybe next time I will bring a large purse so the apple butter can come home with me...   I did not see the inside but I already know I will be back soon. The service was attentive and the menu is so unique and everything I have ever ordered from there has been absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place however the reality was sobbering. I ordered the flat iron steak and eggs what a disappointment everything we order ws a disappointment. However my daughter enjoyed her shrimp and grits. For the most part the food was under seasoned and not tasted. We love trying new places but this one isn't it. I didn't even care for the biscuits the tops were hard...big isn't always better. Their apple butter ws good."}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast's I've had in awhile! They don't seem to serve pork here.. not that I cared after I had the awesome gravy and (dreamy creamy) grits!!!! Sooo good - biscuit fluffy on the inside but not dense; nice crispiness on the outside. The sausage gravy was herby, creamy and balanced.. clung to the biscuit and was a mouthful of bliss with the eggs. The grits are probably the best I've had which probably means they are loaded with calories. That's ok.. I polished off what my wife didn't finish up.  Her eggs bennie were great - a bit rich with having pimento cheese in there. Turkey bacon not my fave but if I get to go back, I'm doing a repeat of what I had!! Happy Tummy!  TIP: If you're ok sitting at the bar, chances are you'll avoid a lengthy wait (the chairs were comfy at the bar and it wasn't an elbow clashing seating arrangement)."}
{"text":"Breakfast was our first order of business after getting off our red eye flight from Vegas. The girlfriend found this place through Yelp and we were conveniently already driving in its direction.  The Southern Style Biscuit Benedict was intriguing. I'm always down for some good eggs benedict. I'd say the dish overall was pretty good, though I found the biscuits to be a little dry for my taste. The Creamy Dreamy Grits were on point though. At first taste, I thought nothing of it, but I couldn't stop eating and finished off the bowl.  The girlfriend ordered the less intriguing Breakfast Bowl. Truth be told, hers was the better dish. Fried green tomatoes, turkey bacon, and two eggs served over their Creamy Dreamy Grits and topped with salsa. It was a surprisingly excellent combination of flavors.  Even though I didn't care for their biscuits in my eggs benedict, I enjoyed the hot and fresh biscuit they gave us on the side. They have this cranberry apple butter concoction in a bottle that you can squeeze right onto the biscuit. Genius!  Friendly service. Good food. Our trip was off to a solid start."}
{"text":"I gave The Flying Biscuit another try again today and my previous review still stands.  Overall, the food is very bland and overpriced to me. To illustrate I will assign a grade to everything I had: Coffee: \"D\" bitter and no good coffee aroma or taste. Tea: \"B\" pretty good tea.  Scrambled Eggs: \"B\" pretty good, but nothing stood out about them. Sausage: \"D-\" they don't have real pork sausage, it's chicken and not good. Oatmeal Pancake Topped with Peach Compote: \"D\" dense with an unpleasant texture and flavor. Peach compote and apple butter made it edible. Apple Butter: \"A+\" best thing about the meal. Grits: \"A\" very good creamy grits  I keep trying this restaurant because I really want to like it. I like the service and the overall vibe of the space and the location is great for me, but the food continues to underwhelm."}
{"text":"I had heard of this place a couple times from my Charlotte based colleges; and when I found myself with some time to kill I decided to give the Flying Biscuit a try. I was surprised to find out that they are a chain; I always thought it is a local independent joint. Anyway, I found myself a table at their patio and though it was only a Wednesday afternoon, they seemed to be busy. I ordered the southern style benedict without the turkey-bacon and a cappuccino - to be honest I was disappointed with my coffee. How can you possibly get a cup of cappuccino wrong? It was more like a cup of steamed milk with a hint of coffee. But when my benedict was brought out, I was a happy customer :) Two poached eggs served on southern style biscuits with a sundried tomato and basil gravy - very different from all the benedicts I have tried so far! If given a chance I would go back to try something else from their menu.  PS - Their grits are very rightly called creamy and dreamy :)"}
{"text":"This place is incredible.  So good, my Dad and I went there back to back mornings.  The biscuits are divine.  Highly recommend you have their biscuit with their homemade butter spread.  Be sure to ask for that.  The Southern Scramble is 100% on point.  Scrambled eggs, turkey bacon and collard greens with cheese! Are you kidding me?  Pure genius.  The combination works flawlessly, as does the way in which they cook it.  If you haven't been here yet and are nearby, do yourself a favor: come hither.  You will leave filled with glee."}
{"text":"Our waitress tila was the best and the food was delicious. New favorite place or first favorite place since it's my first week in Charlotte."}
{"text":"First visit here was about two weeks ago. However, I was very disappointed with my order which was their shrimp and grits. While the grits were ok the shrimp tasted very fishy and seemed not to be fresh. It was also hard to get refills on the drink I ordered. On the positive side the biscuits are great and so is the location!"}
{"text":"My friend wanted comfort food, and I was trying to stay healthy- plus had some dental work that morning. Went with the love cakes, and was really impressed with how good they were! Black bean cakes topped with salsa verde, feta and sour cream (plus onions but I nixed those). It was a really flavorful dish. I switched out my salad for collard greens. They were good too. My friend really liked her BBQ chicken burrito and soup. It's a cute little place and our server was very sweet. I need to go back for brunch!"}
{"text":"I went here on the 4th of July for Brunch. The guy at the hostess stand seemed overwhelmed when we said we had 9 in our party although they weren't extremely busy. We needed to place an order immediately so headed to the bar and explained that we would be eating there once the other party members came in but needed to get an order in. There was a young lady and man behind the bar that immediately hopped to our service. They begin moving tables and everything! They placed our order and were so kind and accommodating!   Did I mention the food was amazing! I had the shrimp scramble--yum!"}
{"text":"The interior of the Flying Biscuit looks like the daycare ran short on people to monitor the rugrats.  That is not necessarily a bad thing - but it is not for the faint of heart or people who like everything in shades of beige.  Plenty of color and loads of stuff all about.  Mind you, these are not tchotchkes you find at Chili's or decent replicas from Cracker Barrel either.  This is yard sale variety: The Good stuff.  Staff at the Biscuit is really nice, which is awesome because the food needs serious work.  Even the namesake biscuits are bad.  Very bad.  You might think they fly because they are light and fluffy.  More likely they fly when people throw them back towards the kitchen for being rock hard.  You know those steakhouses that have peanut shells on the floor?  I would not be surprised to see biscuit remnants on the floor one day if I walked in here.  Now the nice staff will bring you a \"fresh\" batch, but they usually are not much better than the first one.  Other items on the menu are generally decent, but not a ton better.  The one item that really stands out are their grits.  They are not your traditional stone-ground grits that get stuck in your teeth, but they are definitely worth checking out since they are so creamy and delish.  I could drink them for the better part of the day.  Yes, drink.  They are not stiff grits, but they are yummy.  Then again, it could just be to get the taste of the crusty biscuit out of my mouth."}
{"text":"Four of my friends and I went on a Sunday afternoon for a late brunch, around 1:00 or so. The place was very busy, and we waited about 20 minutes or so for a table which we knew would be the case anywhere at that time of day. The only downside is all those waiting for a table need to wait outside--a huge drag when it's chilly.  This place gives you a lot of food for a very reasonable price. I had the Southern Eggs Benedict, an item that was recently added to the menu (their online menu has yet to be updated to include all the new items). My food was delicious! I could barely finish it, there was so much of it, but it all tasted wonderful. I was disappointed, however, that my poached eggs were almost entirely cooked all the way through, with the yolk not having the slightest bit of run to it. Disappointing, but the food was still good overall, and our server was very nice and attentive in spite of how busy it was.  I'll definitely be going back for brunch again soon."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! The food is fresh and more on the healthy side. The restaurant already had a line @10 am on a Thursday if that tells you anything. The place had a cute hippy vibe about it but the food was the real star. I'm not a huge fan of grits but they were so good, I could go swimming in the stuff from there. I was actually upset that I had substituted mine for home fries lol. Their biscuits are huge and perfectly doughy. Don't miss out on either when you go.  Looking forward to bringing friends next time to share the wealth!"}
{"text":"I had heard of the Flying Biscuit but always thought it was a \"biscuitville\" kind of place.  Finally I heard a bunch of comments about it from different people all in a short span of  time and decided to give it a try when my brother and his girlfriend was in town.    I was pleasantly surprised.  I loved the decor and the overall feel of the place.  The menu was extensive and the service was super friendly.    I had the fried green tomatoes with jalapeno cashew relish and goat cheese.  Wow!  Delish!  I also had a side of creamy dreamy grits.  I eat grits a lot at home and I just didn't know grits could be that good.  My brother and his girlfriend both thoroughly enjoyed their meals as well.  I'll definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"Ate breakfast here again this past weekend. Waited 25-30 minutes for an outside table. Our name was called and as we walked up to the hostess table, another party that just arrived walked up and sat at an open table outside. Come to find out, it was our dang table we were called for and the hostess DID not ask them to unass our seats. I was pissed but wifey stayed cool and settled for a table inside.  We also had a new waitress who brought the check before we were done eaten. She came to the table TWICE before we were done and ask was the card in the sleeve. I felt like she thought we were going to run on her. WOW!!! I don't know what wifey likes about this place. Oh yeah! The gluten free menu."}
{"text":"This was a crowded breakfast spot. We had a 45 min wait for 4 people. This is a breakfast and lunch spot so we came around 11 am. We opted for breakfast and their menu is extensive. With so many choices, it was hard to choose.  I will say the service here is good and they are attentive. They get your food out in a timely manner even when there is a crowd.   I got the salmon scramble. It was really just okay I feel the description sounded better than what came out. It tasted good but seemed pretty basic. The biscuit it came with was not very fluffy and was a little hard.   My friend ordered the fried green tomato appetizer and that was just OK as well. The tomatoes were a little flimsy and it was more breaded than fried. The best part about the dish was the topping it had. Maybe this was just an ordering mishap but this place wasn't for me."}
{"text":"Awesome way to end a weekend in Charlotte. My French toast was delish w raspberry sauce, first time I've had whole wheat French toast. Biscuit was huge and I had to have it. My bacon was quickly commandeered by my boyfriend but I got another side and it was crispy. All our food was great and came out fast. About ~$45 for all four of us for food and coffees and of course 1 chocolate milk. Gotta have it. Waiter was funny, joked with us about their 80s music they had on. We got to sit on the patio and look out at the ACE gardening section next door. Loved it."}
{"text":"I have never had good food as this place. I got the hummus pita and it was honestly the worst I have ever had. The only thing I could actually eat was the potatoes which weren't awful. I will never return to this restaurant and I do not recommended it to anyone."}
{"text":"This place is too hyped up! I saw that it has 4 stars and over 500 reviews so I really wanted to try it. It was ok. The biscuits were over done and the coffee was cold. The whole wheat pancakes were very dry. I did like my poached eggs but the potatoes were not good. I would rather go to Famous Toastery than here."}
{"text":"We love eating here whenever we travel through the area.  I had the southern scrambler. The bacon and greens were perfect.  The grits were perfect.  The buttermilk pancakes were good. We even purchased a jar of the apple butter to take back to ohio.  Oh my goodness. Did I forget to write about the biscuits?  They are perfection."}
{"text":"Brunch was fun. Able to order vegan with company who enjoy meat. Food prepared well. Fun place to dine."}
{"text":"Service was excellent. The food was mediocre based on what we ordered. I had the salmon egg scramble which was amazing. Their grits are amazing also.  My girlfriend ordered chicken sausage which she said was pretty nasty.  I also had a half order of french toast and when I say those were the worst french toast I have ever had.  I mean it. They were nothing more than wheat bread thrown on a skillet with butter and raspberry drizzle. Nice try at making something basic look elegant. And its called the flying biscuit which would make you think they have great biscuits. Nah. The biscuits are bland at best. I'm willing to give this place another try but definitely not anytime soon."}
{"text":"I visited this location today 6/13 with my 9yr old and 5 month old. I must say there is nothing spectacular about it. I had the \"moon dust\" potatoes they were dry and flavorless, my fried egg was fried so hard I had to use a knife to cut it and the fried green tomatoes were soggy. The grits were ok they may have been better if the waitress would've brought the butter I asked for. Our drinks were never refilled and I had to flag someone down for the check. I did over hear a server saying they were short on help so maybe that was the issue. I don't think I will try it again"}
{"text":"I tried their Southern style eggs Benedict today and they are by far the best eggs Benedict I have ever had! There's the poached eggs, bacon, and pimento cheese on one of their biscuits and it's topped with a little bit of basil. Such a great combo! It also comes with hollandaise sauce but I prefer mine on the side and as always the grades were really good. The staff is also very friendly and pleasant."}
{"text":"It'd be nice to eat someplace where they aren't shoving a political agenda down your throat - can't put your name in to be seated w/o a lecture & signs being shoved down your throat too! I don't give a hoot about your political inclinations- I wanted to order & pay for food! Won't ever be back!"}
{"text":"Food was good, excellent customer service.  I split the shrimp and grits with a friend, so good. The biscuits with apple butter are great. Wasn't super impressed with the moon dusted potatoes or the grilled mac and cheese tho. And heads up, if you want the cookbook they advertise, it does have some of the menu recipes, but not the biscuits..."}
{"text":"I came today for the first time and I loveeeeeee it. The food and the coffee were delicious. Really nice and fast service too. I'll definitely go back soon."}
{"text":"Everything is so bright! Decorated like 1950's grandma's kitchen...at least in the back. Ordered the hot chocolate. And that was stellar, heaps of whipped cream and chocolate syrup. Num! My bf order the biscuit, eggs and gravy....they have some darn good gravy.  I had a half order of the French toast. It was good. The wheat bread on there stood out a lot. It could've balanced a little better.  Love the music playing. Our server is this super sweet, super pregnant girl who was cheery and prompt. Her section seemed kind of large too. But gosh was she a dear. I think I would've gone 3 stars if not for the service. I'd check it out at again!"}
{"text":"Glad to see a breakfast place that actually has the take out food as good as in store. Eggs are great grits are amazing. The biscuits are amazing as well"}
{"text":"Went here with our office staff for our weekly lunch outing. The service was pretty good, seating open, and the menu is awesome because there are plenty of options for people with dietary restrictions (vegetarian, etc). With that being said, my food was just so-so. I did, however, love the potatoes! And even though i LOVE bread, the biscuits at this place are not my thing."}
{"text":"We went to the Flying Biscuit Cafe  on a Saturday around 11:30 and the wait was approximately 20 minutes but well worth the wait!  When is breakfast not merely just breakfast?  The constituents of a good breakfast contain a lot of the same items: eggs, sausage/bacon, toast/biscuit, maybe even pancakes/waffles.  the difference lies in the delivery.  thats what makes the breakfast unique.    now if your looking for a typical biscuit or bland grits this is not the place for you.  maybe Denny's is more your thing (and thats cool).  We had the \"high flier\" breakfast easily decided for the sampling of the breakfast options.  It has 2 eggs, 2 pieces of chicken sausage patties, a bowl of creamy grits, a famous flying biscuit dusted with sugar, and oatmeal pancake with peach compote.  all served with a side of cranberry spice jam.  we had our eggs scrambled with cheese and they were great.  the chicken sausage was excellent for both a sausage eater and made my non-pork eating guest very happy ^_^.  the grits were off the hook.  everything good creamy grits should be where you dont have to add a thing.  i would seriously go back strictly for these grits.  i was stealing them off my guest's plate after i inhaled mine, heh.  the biscuits (which are served with each entree, and can be ordered al la carte) had a great crumbly texture on the outside, and a chewy soft texture on the inside.  the dusting of sugar gave it a perfect sweet touch, made just right with a pat of butter.  should you want to construct your own sausage and egg biscuit with some jam you have the arsenal to do so.  you would be happy eating each piece of the high flyer breakfast on its own or combining them into a flavor layered creation.   finally, the pancake.  we were so full with everything preceding it, that we couldnt imagine eating the whole thing.  however, it had a great oat and nutty taste and texture.  it was great sans-butter or dipped into the warm peach compote.  the compote was a nice peach and light syrup topping but it didn't taste like it came from a can.   We had coffee and i had sweet tea to drink.  the coffee was very good and they offered all types of sweeteners INCLUDING a cleverly disguised bowel of lump sugar at the table!  the sweet tea was ON POINT.  this is proper fucking sweet tea.  if seriously sweet tea makes you squeamish, dont order this.  it will give you the shakes and i dont want any arrhythmia on my conscience.      our waiter was Daniel and was extremely polite, attentive and ready to please.  As stated in the other reviews this is the most interesting eclectic, artsy and inspiring breakfast place.  gazing up at the ceiling tiles made me rethink my own plain acoustic tiles back home.  The music was very appropriate and suited the atmosphere.  it wasnt loud, and the instrumental rockabilly tunes were adding to the atmosphere.    all of this for under $30 at a breakfast place. i would have had less of a well rounded and fulfilling experience if i were dining out for dinner and dropping $100.    so when you see the line out the door, go ahead and wait the 20 minutes.  its well worth it."}
{"text":"BEST GRITS EVER!!!! I work nearby and am constantly tempted to sneak over on my break just for some grits and a biscuit with the tasty apple butter sauce! I have yet to have anything that I dislike here, but I mainly stick with the breakfast foods, cause breakfast is the best. The Only food item I would say I wouldn't order again os the oatmeal based pancakes. They are very dense, heavy and tasteless unless you eat it smothered in syrup or with a mouthful of peaches. But the grits... get the grits."}
{"text":"Yummmm!! I took family here this past Monday while they were in town because we are from up north and I've heard this is the best place in Charlotte to get grits.  They weren't lying.. this place was so good! I got the grits of course and also a plate of there French toast with a raspberry drizzle! To dieeee for. =) On top of that the service was great too, very friendly. And the restaurant has a great look to it.  Ill be back."}
{"text":"The Food was semi-decent. I was so excited to try your biscuits because you are called the Flying Biscuit for goodness sakes. But unfortunately your biscuits weren't all they were talked up to be. When I received my meal, which I had order Egg-Ordinary which comes with the famous biscuits. The biscuits were quite doughy. So that was such a let down. But I still had a little hope in your food,so  I ate your grits which were outstanding. Even though your Biscuit s weren't the best. Your grits made up for it."}
{"text":"The Flying Biscuit is a chain, but I don't hold that against it. This is easily one of my favorite breakfast spots in Charlotte.  On weekend mornings, there is typically a small crowd waiting outside, but I've never had to wait long. There are a few tables out front, a cute, cheerful dining room (you can sit at the counter if you like), and a covered deck or porch out back with additional seating.  Service has always been friendly and attentive, but the real reason I keep coming back is the food. Every single breakfast I've eaten here has been excellent (they do serve lunch and dinner, but I'm so in love with their breakfasts, I see no reason to stray). Pancakes, French toast, scrambles and omelets--all of them are great, and so are the grits, potatoes, chicken sausage, and/or fresh fruit you can get with them.   Then, of course, there's the biscuits. They're great on their own, but do yourself a favor and spread some cranberry apple butter on top."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised!  Went to the other location last year and it was okay...  This time the food and service were both amazing!!  Love the biscuits, grits, French toast and the kids loved their quesadillas!  We had a great time, and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Good food. Amazing apple butter for the biscuits. Your typical diner food with a slight creative flair. I drank that apple butter, it was that good."}
{"text":"We went to the original Flying Biscuit Cafe on occasion when we lived in Atlanta, and were excited to try this location in Charlotte.  Since this summer, we have eaten here four or more times, and actually prefer this location over Atlanta's.  Despite the distance from our house, FBC is now on our regular rotation for Saturday breakfast!  We've tried a few different menu items -  Biscuit, Eggs, and Gravy, Egg-Ceptional Eggs, Flatiron Steak and Eggs, and Meggxican Wrap.  The biscuit and chicken sausage gravy is my favorite, and they will gladly add cheese to the scrambled eggs upon request.  I can never finish the plate, the portion is so large!  Their grits are also fantastic, and I can always find room to finish those!  We only wish the black bean cakes in the Egg-Ceptional eggs were made a little thinner and crispier.  (I'm thinking of West Egg's black bean cakes in ATL as a point of comparison.)  Their Flatiron Steak and Eggs is very good, and one of my husband's favorites, along with the spicy Meggxican Wrap.     Service is always friendly and extremely fast.  The interior is larger than it appears, and we've always been seated quickly.  FBC has two patios - one in front facing the parking lot, and one larger one in the back (facing the quieter back parking area).  The back patio is larger and more comfortable...IF you can get a seat that's not in the direct sun.  They really need to install an awning to protect the outer tables from direct sunlight!  I appreciate that FB offers espresso drinks.  While expensive, their cappuccinos and lattes are pretty good.    If you haven't tried Flying Biscuit, you should!"}
{"text":"Huge disappointment.   -Service was realllllly slow. Overall it was a 1.5 hour breakfast for 2 people once we were seated. We waited over 15 minutes my credit card back after giving it to the waitress and eventually went inside to find it. I think this is partly due to being understaffed.   -We sat outside and they leave their maple syrup on the tables. Bees were EVERYWHERE. The hostesses were swatting them and spraying them with whatever they clean the tables with.  -The biscuits are terrible. I would think if you have \"biscuit\" in your name and they are included with every meal they would be decent. They are dry and flour-y with sugar sprinkled on top. Any fast food restaurant has better biscuits.  The blueberry pancakes were pretty good as were the grits, but in the end it wasn't worth the wait and hassle."}
{"text":"I tried.  I really really tried to like Flying Biscuit.  :(  This place is always packed and people have left it pretty good reviews.  I think I'm the exception to the rule.  I've been here several times as I keep saying \"I'll give it another shot. I'll go mid-week\".....anddddddd it's the same not so grand experience for me.  :(    Let me tell you what I do like:  1) I like the location.  It's in Park Road Shopping Center which is close to home.  Check 2) I like the staff.  Although they are COMPLETELY slammed at peek hours, they always seem to make me smile and laugh and they're good. 3) The apple butter is heavenly 4)Mimosa pours are HUGE.  5) those biscuits tho   What I don't like and why I give it 2 stars: 1) Every time and I mean every time...I come here, My food order is COLD.  I even order it differently so they'll have to make it fresh.  :( 2)  They seem to always forget to seat us.  This is a popular place and they are slammed...I get that...but how you skip over our name when we see you mark it down the last several times we've been here is crazy.   3) on top of the food being cold, it's just not fresh.  My scrambled eggs are overcooked, the pancakes are hard and stale...it's just not good food.    So...I think this last visit has made me decide to break-up with Flying Biscuit when it comes to going here for the food.  I'll come for the coffee and mimosas and biscuits...but not the food.  (sorry..don't hate me!)"}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot even though there is always a hungry mob on weekends and long wait. The.best.grits!"}
{"text":"The food was not memorable. I had some kind of eggs with a biscuit, they have cutesy names, the biscuit was hard and inedible, even after soaking it in grits. The server that I explained this to told me she would ' tell them in the back' but never replaced my biscuit. The service, in general, is terribly lacking. Twice I have been there and twice told that my silverware was filthy because of the dishwasher. I am told this is a great place to eat. My experience tells me differently. Still, if you are an adventurous hipster you may well like the atmosphere and hip disservice. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Oh man this food is delicious!! We were in town for a concert and wanted a delicious breakfast. Boy did this place live up to the expectations! The grits and biscuits were so good. Coffee was tasty. Service was good, the host was the best."}
{"text":"Awesome twist on southern breakfast food!  Nothing on the menu was fried (from what we could tell) and they used turkey instead of pork products.  The food was excellent and the service was the same.  I cant remember what they called my dish, but it was supposed to be cajun (or something spicy), and it didnt quite have as much kick as I would have liked.  My wife had the biscuits and gravy and it was amazing!  Definitely a great place to eat!"}
{"text":"Delllllish! This place is super casual, very trendy/hipster, draws a huge crowd and is soooo worth the wait! The grits are literally something you dream about and they know how to make their flavors work!! I'd say hands down try brunch here!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is always consistent and familiar. The service is awesome and you just always feel at home here.  The brunch is what I've been here for.  Everything is worth trying...there's nothing that I would tell you to stay away from.  The biscuits of course..while not really being able to fly, are a wonderful fluffy deliciousness.  The restaurant is slightly on the small side and there is chance for a wait.  It is uniquely decorated and there is plenty to look at while waiting.  ****In response to Chris S.....I just feel the menu could be spiced up a little.  Maybe more app choices or even small plates would be cool.  I have nothing bad to say about he current menu..but maybe a weekly or seasonal special? Something different to try.****"}
{"text":"I've always heard great things about The Flying Biscuit, but my personal experience wasn't anything special. I met up with a friend for Sunday brunch and was seated immediately. The menu is expansive for a place that serves only breakfast all day. Although there were numerous options, I ended up ordering the Shrimp and Grits. The grits were great, already infused with butter, milk for a creamy texture. However, I thought the ingredients that accompanied the shrimp would be better suited for a pizza. The sauce was heavily tomato based and there wasn't much else aside from tomatoes that was impactful on the flavor. It tasted fine, but I feel other vegetables and another sauce would have been a better compliment to the shrimp. The service here is spectacular and the prices are reasonable, with most choices falling below $10."}
{"text":"I'll start off by saying delicious!  no Dr. Pepper or Mr. Pibb, was the only downfall to me."}
{"text":"Nestled in the middle of Park Road shopping center, Flying Biscuit is definitely a place to try. Once you walk in, you can't help but smile from all the colorful decor on the walls. They have quite the extensive breakfast and lunch menu, so there is something for everyone here.   I ordered the Southern Benedict, which is pimento cheese, poached egg and hollandaise sauce on a homemade biscuit. This was quite flavor packed, and a little on the spicy side. I'm not sure where the spice came from, and it was almost too much for me, but my breakfast date thought it was perfect. I got it with their creamy, dreamy grits and they most definitely lived up to their name! I highly recommend them if you're a grits fan. Also, each table has a squeeze bottle of apple butter to go with their biscuits, which is another added bonus for this spot."}
{"text":"I have been here multiple times, and never leave, wanting to return.   First, the food is usually great! The menu is good! There biscuits Benedict is perfection! However, that is only if your food arrives warm. Sometimes, it is warm, but seems stale.   Service is terrible. I have had to refill my own drinks, hunt down servers, etc. one time, a server showed up with a tray of drinks, set them down, and said \"I don't know where these go,\" and walked away.   The Bloody Mary is disgusting."}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast spots!  Their biscuits are of course amazing, don't forget the jelly with them!  You can't go wrong with their omelets.  I recently ordered their steak and eggs and it was delicious!  I would definitely go back and it is a good spot to take family to as well."}
{"text":"High quality and creative dishes. I have been there a few times and the \"Spicy Shrimp Quesadilla\" is my favorite and I am not into spicey food."}
{"text":"Typical Southern style breakfast. The biscuits with apple sauce, is something I relished, other than the omelette and oat pancakes."}
{"text":"I stopped here for a quick late breakfast/ early lunch. I enjoyed the food as well as the service. My meal was delicious. They had some of the best grits you'll ever eat. Check them out!"}
{"text":"We visited for Saturday brunch from out of town.  My husband really enjoyed the chicken sausage gravy and biscuits!  I had the Egg-ceptional Eggs, two eggs served over black bean cakes, tomatillo sauce, sour cream and feta.  Very flavorful and tasty!  The grits were pretty good, but as someone who doesn't get grits often I'm not picky.   The atmosphere is fun and quirky, service was efficient.  It's tucked in to a shopping plaza with plenty of parking.  Thought about going back during my stay but wanted to try as many places as I could before leaving. Solid breakfast!"}
{"text":"I have heard good things about this place so I was excited to try it out. I love biscuits and this place serves an amazing one. First off it is huge. My husband loves the crunchy outside and I am a big fan of the gooey middle and this one does both. They had a cranberry apple butter sauce in a squeeze bottle on the table that was pretty good with the biscuit. Just a note, this biscuit is on the sweet side if you like more savory biscuits probably will not be for you.   I ordered the EGG-STRAORDINARY BREAKFAST - two eggs, creamy dreamy grits and oven-roasted \"moon dusted\" potatoes. Got my eggs over-hard so nothing special. I have never been a big fan of grits, but these were to die for.  No idea if they are good or not, but for me the first time I could eat a whole bowl of grits. No clue what made them so yummy to me, but I was blown away. Now the \"moon dusted\" potatoes on the other hand were also nothing special. I am guessing the \"moon dust\" is extra salt because they were super salty and I should have requested no dust for me.  Live and Learn.  My dining partner got the OVEN FRIED GREEN TOMATO BLT and it looked pretty good also, big portions, colorful. The whole wheat bun looked amazing.  I would highly recommend this place to people. I have heard it gets insane on the weekend, so we went early lunch time on a Friday. We got a table right away and our food came out quickly."}
{"text":"The menu has GF next to the items that are well, gluten free! Its a nice change to not have to ask about every single thing and worry, plus you can get breakfast anytime and who doesn't love that ( you know who you are).   A big bonus is that I also don't eat pork, so bacon is a no-No for me, but never fear, they have Turkey bacon!!! And chicken sausage, so I was ecstatic to have eggs and bacon along with my family and not think about eating a pig.  Some of their staff I think are a bit young and not as professional some others, sup watch put for those, they aren't bad, just a bit ditzy and distant, not as atentative as they should be to your needs."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place.  This has probably been my 10th time eating at the Flying Biscuit.  The first one I ever went to was in Atlanta in Midtown.  I'm glad they branched out to Charlotte a few years back.  I seriously can't find anything I don't like on the menu.  The Roasted Hummus Wrap is to die for.  You also get those \"moon-dusted\" potatoes as your side with that yummy fresh Biscuit and that apple butter.  YUM.  On this recent visit I got the Veggie Omelette with a side of fruit, and of course the yummy biscuit. The Flying Biscuit is very different than other restaurants and has its own distinct feel.  This location on Park Rd is my favorite because it is a Huge Space.  The other Flying Biscuit locations are very small, and when there busy (which tends to be often) you usually have to wait forever to get seated.  The Park Rd location also has a huge patio in the back, and also a small patio in the front for extra seating when its warm.  If you haven't ate at the Flying Biscuit I definitely recommend going.  You won't regret it."}
{"text":"The grits is heaven and I'm a southern girl. The biscuits my aunt makes far better. Definitely worth it and breakfast served all day - so have a late night then go have brunch."}
{"text":"We sat at the bar to avoid the wait,  though we drank coffees, seeing the bartender make drinks, i can say they are generous (to say the least) when making mimosas. Who needs a flute when you have a 16oz cup?   The staff are delightful, and I really liked the fried green tomatoes. The breakfast ordered (egg-ceptional dish), however,  wasn't anything exceptional....But, this may be just what we ordered.   Nonetheless, based on the fantastic  service, and great Yelp reviews, I would definitely come back... but would probably order something different."}
{"text":"I was very impressed. I was so happy to find a healthier option- I had eggs with veggies. They gave me a side of potatoes, grits, and a biscuit. The potatoes where nothing special. But oh man! Those grits and bisects are a must! I'm not even a fan of grits but I really liked these grits! Definitely a great mom and pop shop to check out! The coffee was good as well. They had a dark roast. Normally restaurant coffee doesn't impress me, but it was a solid cup of joe"}
{"text":"This was a great breakfast spot close to our hotel! The biscuits were amazing and the grits were the best ever."}
{"text":"I have been eating grits all my life. My first table food after baby formula was probably grits. The Flying Biscuit cafe has the best, creamest, cheeisest grits....Hands down!"}
{"text":"My coworkers brought me out here for brunch one Friday morning.  Man.. was I pleased with their choice.  This place ROCKED!!  The menu including about 50 different omelets, and they allowed me to mix and match any of their sides.  I heard the creamy dreamy grits are to die for, but I got the home fried potatoes and was far from disappointed with the decision.  The biscuit was the best part (it better be, its in the title).  It also comes with a side of apple butter that I devoured.   I got the Piedmont Omelete and it was HUGE and scrumptious  The only negative side is that the wait can be crazy.  That's a good sign though, right?  I came back the very next day to bring the Mrs there and it was an hour wait at 11am.  Yikes!  i would definitely suggest giving this place a try during some off hours.    Enjoy!  -Ian M."}
{"text":"Great southern breakfast! Food was delicious, waitstaff super friendly. We were seated within 10 minutes of arriving without a reservation on a Sunday and received are food just as promptly. Would definitely recommend to out of towners looking for some good eats!"}
{"text":"Recently moved to the Charlotte area and was in desperate need for some good brunch. As an Elite Yelper I went straight to Yelp and found this amazing place after several searches.  The initial reason I chose this establishment is bc I had a massive craving for Shrimp & Grits. The night before went to a Louisiana style restaurant and ordered the Shrimp & Grits which was different than I was use to lol. Thank you Flying Biscuit cause the Shrimp & Grits were amazing and delicious. I also ordered the Steak & Eggs which came with grits which was also great. I ordered it rare and it came out well done so that's something they could work on.  The service was top notch and I never had to ask for anything since our waitress was so attentive. For those of you looking for a quick mimosa with brunch, guess what they have mimosas and their not half bad.   As for the decor, it's a bit out dated so it could use a little sprucing up but that doesn't affect the food. Very diverse and great food so be prepared to wait about 20-30 mins but it's soooo worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Flying Biscuit.  Not fast enough.  We arrived peak hours, on a Sunday afternoon, with a party of about 10.  We were seated pretty quickly, considering the crowd loitering around outside and our size.  But our service was less than par.  We had at least three of the managers come serve us our beverages, while we baked in the heat of the sun (although we did request an outside seat).  And our server took too long, to take our drink orders and then to take our food orders.  Other than service, the food was delicious.  I was thoroughly surprised by the sweet biscuits.  And then, topped with chicken sausage gravy, this added a completely new spin on the meaning of biscuits and gravy.  Not my favorite, but definitely interesting.  And the best of all, those creamy, dreamy grits!  Who can forget such a delectable treat!  Although, they said there was cheese mixed in, it was not nearly enough for my satisfaction.  Definitely will be a repeat, unless the service continues to be slower than molasses."}
{"text":"While in the area I wasn't sure where to eat so I did as I usually will and scoured Yelp. The Flying Biscuit has lived up to its reputation and served me quite possibly the best breakfast I have ever been served.  - Quirky Interior - Inexpensive Prices - Friendly Service - Flavor Packed Food - Variety in Menu - Easy-to-Find Location  I wasn't sure what to expect from the shopping mall exterior but when I walked up to see a friendly face at the door and corn hole boards for those that wait, I was pleased.  I started off with a Large OJ ($2.99) and while the size wasn't what I expected, it did taste like fresh squeeze which is much better than paying the Gallon price for a cup of Minute Maid.  I ordered the sausage gravy, eggs and biscuits ($9.29). The grits are so good! Everything was packed with flavor.  My wife ordered the Turkey hash ($9.25). It was So delicious! The meat was so tender and packed with flavor. I asked for tomatillo sauce on side and it just boosted the delicious factor for me.  I would highly recommend you stop here for a few bites!"}
{"text":"we drove from cornelius to charlotte to try Flying biscuit as there are so few breakfast options in Lake Norman area. Wow worth the drive. most amazing biscuits and gravy EVER (chicken gravy)- delish. Everything was good. Worth driving for a memorable meal-"}
{"text":"It's hard to get breakfast wrong and the breakfast is certainly decent though nothing spectacular. What is odd to me is that the biscuits (their namesake) are just not good and the reason for review."}
{"text":"I love this place they always deliever my food was Awesome as was the service."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came in for a late brunch on a Sunday. It was very quiet and they seemed to be recuperating after the rush. We were seated promptly, everything was clean, and we had a sweet and attentive server. It was our first time coming to The Flying Biscuit so she was patient with us taking some time to make our decisions. I appreciate the gluten free choices listed clearly on the menu, great selection of food to choose from. Both of our entrees were made well and we had no complaints."}
{"text":"First place I went to go visit during my business trip to North Carolina. I had hoped to end it here as well, but I woke up late. I am actually writing this at CLT, sitting on one of them white rocking chairs. Man, as I am thinking about what to write for this place, my mouth is already salivating..  My girlfriend went to Florida for law school and told me that I HAD to go to one of these places. My goodness it was good. A great way to say: WELCOME TO THE SOUTH (I know NC is a debatable southern state, but this restaurant surely is).  I got the one with sausage biscuit, layered over by scrambled eggs and grits on the side. I never had grits before and it took some \"acquiring\" to do for me to enjoy it. BUT man the sausage biscuit with the scrambled eggs on top is something to DIEEEEE FORRRR! I don't think I need to do any explaining but, to say to go get it, and get fat, like a true Southerner.  Nothing up north has something like this. I want it now."}
{"text":"Food is really fantastic. Very impressed with the chicken sausage and the raspberry French toast. Grits, apple butter, eggs- all outstanding. Something here for everyone. The atmosphere is fun and we didn't have to wait because we went at 2pm.  Service was about a B so I can't give it 5 stars, but I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Went here at 11a on a Sunday. Wait was 10 mins.  Went with a table for 4. Sat outside, it was a beautiful day! I ordered their version of eggs benedict. Bacon was extra crispy, delicious! Don't understand the reason for the excessive amount of shredded cheese. Eggs were over cooked, not sure if they poach them or bake them? But the biscuit was to die for! Also, for not being a fan of grits,  they have their grits together! I would definitely be back wherever I'm in town."}
{"text":"Mmmmmm. The Flying Biscuit. It's my favorite breakfast place. Creamy dreamy grits and the biscuits are amazing. There is often a line but the service is fast and friendly."}
{"text":"The Biscuits are Flying, out of the window!  If you name your restaurant after a food, then you better be exceptional at preparing that item.  Sadly, that isn't the case here.  Growing up in the south, I have had countless opportunities to indulge in biscuits from restaurants as well as homemade.  It upsets me that the flour taste of the biscuits here were very heavy and they were extremely dry.  Having eaten here 3 times now, I can safely say that they are great at reproducing the awful biscuit recipe.  I should not have to drown my biscuit in strawberry jelly and butter just to choke it down.  It should be buttery and moist, and full of southern charm.  I digress....  The vegetarian options are extremely limited, but if you eat eggs then it is okay.  I had the over-easy eggs on top of a black bean cake.  It was very tasty!!  They do sweet tea VERY well!  After our meal, we sprung for a cup of coffee because that's a southern requirement.  I am equally sad to report that the coffee tasted burned and we were merely drinking coffee for the sake of it.  There was zero enjoyment.  Thankfully a french bakery opened in the same plaza so they provided us with a great cup of coffee after breakfast.  The place is always packed, which would indicate they are doing something right.  But, they could be so much better if they focused on the details a little more.    Service is fast, floors are clean-ish, and the door host is highly energetic.  I would go back again under special circumstances.... BETTER BISCUITS!"}
{"text":"Excellent!  My first time here, met for an early morning business meeting.  Service left a little to be desired but was still above average, otherwise, would have been 5-stars.  Food was great, biscuit was phenomenal!  Missed the apple butter until the end, so will be back soon.  A definite must try for anyone!"}
{"text":"Meh. Everything was just ok. Do not go here when it's cold outside. We were seated right by the door whi was constantly opening. Freezing does not make for an enjoyable meal."}
{"text":"Came to FB first time with my husband for brunch on Saturday and I was impressed. It was a little packed but we were seated right away. Staffs are very friendly and attentive.   We felt like something breakfast-y so we ordered pumpkin pancakes and full size french toast added two fluffy biscuits (it is a must!). The food came out pretty fast. The biscuits were really fluffy and huge. We absolutely loved them! We also got Shrimp & grits and honestly it tasted really good. Not too creamy nor salt. What a delicious breakfast meal.   A must try if you are in the area."}
{"text":"For a place called the flying biscuit, their biscuits aren't so sky high. Chick-fil-a has better biscuits in my opinion.   However, their chicken sausage gravy and grits are both amazing."}
{"text":"I had been to the location in the Raleigh/Durham area in the past so I tried the Charlotte location once I realized they had one. It was crowded but there was no wait and we were seated immediately. Additionally, the service was good and the waiter prompt. The biggest thing I noticed was how quickly the food came out. We honestly waited less than 10 minutes after we ordered for our food. I had the shrimp and grits and it was good. They use a tomato based sauce, which isn't my favorite but it was still flavorful. Shockingly, the worst part of the meal was the biscuit. Plenty of parking as the restaurant is in a shopping center."}
{"text":"The ambiance was cool. Very colorful. The omelette was excellent and so was the buscuit it came with. The service was great. The only thing was their buttermilk pancakes weren't great. If you're looking for the premier breakfast restaurants go to the Yolk in Rock Hill. If not, this is a solid 2nd."}
{"text":"Always a friendly place with some very nice homey foods,everything's got a twist here. Black bean cakes cakes are pretty decent but their eggs dishes are excellent. A lot of familes with children stagger in service is always friendly and courteous a great place for breakfast, lunch or Dinner. Breakfast is pricey, lunch is comparable but Dinner is very reasonable. They have great cocktails and a few craft beers as well as wines."}
{"text":"Had the shrimp and grits and it was good. The shrimp was cooked perfectly and the grits are the top of the list. Mom giving it a 3 star as the sanitation score was very low at an 83%.   I will definitely try it again if they increase the sanitation scores."}
{"text":"For some reason I feel like this place has gone downhill....fast. I used to  love them, or maybe I was just ignorant of all the other yummy places around but this last visit was majorly disappointing.  The biscuits are still pretty good...not served as warm and they were a little more dry.  My go-to meal is the organic oatmeal pancakes with peaches.  This past time they were dry, almost overcooked and bland.    The eggs were okay but not fluffy, the chicken sausage was greasy and chewy, the fruit was primarily honey dew, etc etc.  I could go on and on.    The service was okay but honestly, not super efficient or friendly.  They were packed on Saturday and they are in a great location but I'm over them.  I just don't think the quality is that great.  Too many other spots popping up around town."}
{"text":"The first time in was because I knew they served breakfast all day, and ever since then I haven't really strayed from the breakfast menu, no matter what meal I actually should be having.   The omelets are large, the biscuits are yum (but are substantially better before they start to sit out too long post breakfast-rush), and my eggs are always cooked nicely. My serious gripe with the place is the wait time, no matter if I'm one of five tables or one of twenty five - it always takes what seems like FOREVER to get my food. And of course I can't even get a water refill while I wait, for a place so open the service staff has found some really good places to hide!  That being said I've still kept the flying biscuit on my list, because their food is pretty good (so far I think the cajun scramble is my favorite) and you don't have to worry about your eggs arriving in a pool of grease like some other breakfast all day establishments."}
{"text":"I've never liked biscuits until I tried theirs. I had the Benedict and the biscuit was amazing also try the grits they are something else."}
{"text":"Wasn't super impressed with the whole meal but I do want to say that my biscuit was delicious!! Perfectly done with a little crisp on the outside but nice in the middle. Tried it with the Apple Butter & it was a great combination!  The service was good and there weren't many people there in the middle of the morning on a Wednesday.   If you're looking for breakfast option you may be able to find something better but this place is pretty solid with a good variety and good food."}
{"text":"I'm going to say this...   I'd been wanting to visit The Flying Biscuit for a while.  Seen the great reviews so I wanted in as well.   Decided to stop in before an appointment so I was kinda crunched for time but I was at war with my stomach and guess what? It won!  I was greeted promptly and seated. I requested a cup of joe and a water. After tussling with sugar packets ( I despise sugar packets. Get sugar dispensers already.)   I ordered the shrimp and grits. It was ok. The shrimp were cooked just right and the grits were tasty and creamy but the chunks of tomato I can do without. I think Midnight Diner has spoiled me with their shrimp and grits. Along with my fish there was a biscuit. A HARD biscuit. I started to ask for butter but in this case it wouldn't have helped. I slathered the jam that was provided inside the biscuit. Honestly, I wouldn't sell biscuits that hard. Biscuits should be soft and WARM....  Anywho, I'd give The Flying Biscuit another try minus the biscuit."}
{"text":"Probably the best breakfast I've ever had! Their biscuits benedict and their oatmeal pancakes are awesome!"}
{"text":"Good food - very prompt service - wide variety on the menu - food is just ok, but the staff is very friendly and very accomodating - give it a try, you might see some things you like"}
{"text":"I was impressed. I use Yelp to help me chose places to eat since I travel so much. The pictures were so helpful. I chose this place because of the pictures and number of check ins. I got the high flyer; oatmeal pancake (don't add syrup) egg white and apple turkey sausage patty with potatoes. It was so good I had to come back the next day. My boyfriend got steak and eggs. It's a huge amount of food for a great cost. Would def recommend Flying Biscuit to others. There's a wait which further lets you know the food is good"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a good breakfast, with some standard items, bacon and eggs, to southern style options, shrmip and grits, The Flying Biscuit is somewhere you should go. Although there can be a wait on Saturday and Sunday mornings, it moves pretty quickly and I find the food worth the wait. The biscuits are always served warm, with a side apple butter, and a sprinkle of cooked sugar on top, my favorite part of the biscuit... As for the other options, the veggie omelett is my favorite. A three egg omelett with peppers, onions, spinach, mushrooms and swiss cheese. Perfect! I also love the chicken sausage.  Note: It does have a spicy kick so be prepared. And, I am not a grits fan so I always ordered the potatoes. However, I few weeks ago I decided to give them a try and loved them. They were creamy and not what I expected. I have ordered them ever seen.  Although the food is great the service can be hit or miss. They do like to \"turn tables\" so servers can seem rushed. And, they have so many tables at once you have to grab someone or be patient. However, it hasn't hindred my visits, and I know I will be back..maybe even this weekend."}
{"text":"Brunch is the most important meal of the day, so my friends and I searched for the best place in the area and settled on the Flying Biscuit.  They'd been there in the past and had great things to say about the homemade biscuits and apple butter.  We arrived at noon on Saturday and the place was packed. There was no where to seat our large party so we ended up on the patio at the rear of the restaurant.  For the most part we were alone with the funky hanging art and water spritzing fans.  The restaurant seems to be a bit cramped, so I wasn't upset.  Looking at the menu I had a tough time deciding what to order.  There were so many options, both sweet and savory.  Since I wanted to try a bit of everything, I went for the High Flyer.  I had no idea what I was getting myself into. So much food!  I had never tried chicken sausage before, but I was quite impressed.  The grits were absolutely delicious and creamy.  My favorite thing overall was the oatmeal pancake.  It was thick and fluffy and perfectly matched with the peach compote.  Everyone was happy with their brunch selection.  The only issues with our meal were the slight snafus by our server.  Because we were out back, she seemed to forget about us every so often.  My friend had ordered an appetizer, but it was not brought out until he had reminded the waitress toward the end of our meal.  Not a huge ordeal considering how much other food we had already devoured.    If I were in the area again, I'd definitely return.  There are so many options to try, I'm sure I'd never get the same thing twice."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!  The first time we stepped foot into Flying Biscuit was in Atlanta.  Whenever we visit our friend in ATL we would always go to the Midtown location.  We'd get there around 8:00am, put in our name down, and wait...45min - 1hr later we'd get seated.  It was always totally worth the wait!   Now Charlotte has 2 locations!  If you get there after 8-9am on the weekends, you will definitely have to wait, maybe 15-30 min.  I love the eclectic menu.  They have some traditional items (steak and eggs, omlettes, and biscuits and gravy) and some fun nontraditional ones (black bean cakes, scrambled tofu, and orange scented french toast).  Obviously, they are known for their biscuits.  They are not like the normal flakey buttery biscuits you may be used to.  They have a scone-like consistency, solid and firm on the outside and soft on the inside.  The cranberry apple butter is to die for.  It's sweet yet tangy! YUMMY!  I was never a fan of grits until I tried them there.  They are the creamiest grits in the world!  Now every time I go out for breakfast somewhere else, I always want to get grits, but it's never ever as good as FB.  So I stopped trying them at other places.  Sorry other breakfast guys...Flying Biscuit has the BEST grits EVER!  The only reason I gave 4 not 5 stars is the service.  The Park Rd location has extremely slow service.  Every other time we go the service is so slow, even when they are not busy.  I took my family there for breakfast and we got seated before 2 other tables around us.  The other tables had their drinks and appetizer orders before we were even greeted by our waitress.  We complained and the manager gave us a complimentary fried green tomato appetizer (which was really good).  Hopefully they will work on it."}
{"text":"I love this place! It was about a 15 minute wait to get in at noon, which is not bad. Once seated the service was quick to get drinks and take our order. I tried something different for me, the southern scramble, it was awesome!! Eggs, onions, greens, ham I think, and cheese. Yummy! My daughter had the biscuits and gravy. She really like it, but beware it is a large portion. I tasted her biscuits and gravy also and really loved the gravy. Super tasty. The only thing that I was not crazy about, and this is strictly a preference, the biscuits were very thick and heavy. I like mine light and fluffy. But the apple butter they have sitting on the table, fantastic! One other note, the shopping center is very busy, so you may have to park far in the parking lot. But well worth it."}
{"text":"Was really hopeful given the reviews, but the only thing I liked was my latte. The biscuits and gravy come with eggs on top and a side of grits. So basically a huge pile of brown food- appetizing? I think not. It just wasn't good, big miss for me."}
{"text":"I discovered Flying Biscuit during a recent trip to Charlotte and visited twice. It's a delicious, creative breakfast spot (they have lunch dishes too, but I stuck with the former), low key and casual with easy prices. The food is a little inconsistent - biscuits were better the first time I visited than the second, when they were a tad undercooked - but the grits are to die for and their pimento cheese is delicious. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Flying Biscuit is still excellent for breakfast. I had the Turkey Hash, which was a pile of fried potatoes, a big portion of what was probably turkey pot roast, two eggs over medium and cheese on top. With a big biscuit. This was a very large portion and it tasted great. I was very pleased with it.  Been here a few times and enjoy going back. It is VERY busy on the weekends, not as much during the week at breakfast time."}
{"text":"We didn't have to wait for long. We were greeted right away. They were super busy but our server made us feel like we were at home. My mom and I both ordered the piedmont omelette. Both dishes came out pretty quickly to my surprise. I was a little disappointed with my food though. I have heard so many good things about The Flying Biscuit. I guess they cook the Turkey bacon with the eggs?( I have never seen that technique before). Normally the ingredients are stuffed inside of the egg... I believe because of the fact that they were trying to cook the turkey bacon thoroughly it over cooked my eggs. My eggs were definitely well done and brown all over. There moon dusted potatoes were ok. The service was awesome though."}
{"text":"I have been here once a few years ago and I can tell you I could still taste the grits l couldn't stop thinking about them, so naturally when my friends wanted to have breakfast for dinner here I said yes. We started with the pimento cheese and oven fried green tomatoes, both were delicious. My main course I ordered the Shrimp scramble and added the jalapeño bacon mixed in with half grits and half potatoes for the side. The grits were just as I remembered and the potatoes were perfect. The jalapeño bacon was so good I was I just got it by itself because I was digging through the scramble for it. The scramble itself was okay but I wouldn't order it again the bacon did set it off though and gave it more favor. And it looked to be like 2 shrimp cut up inside of it. The service was fast and on point with making sure our drinks were full and we were doing alright."}
{"text":"Well worth the wait!  Our waitress was SUPER nice and funny, prompt and attentive, made us all laugh. Food delicious, portions were abundant."}
{"text":"When I my mother and sister decided on a Girls' Brunch while we visited Charlotte, I looked to my trusty Yelp app to find the perfect restaurant.  And boy, was The Flying Biscuit Cafe a great choice!    It was a crowded Sunday morning there, but that's to be expected when the food is so good.  I started with a Chai Tea and worked my way up to a Latte, both of which were delicious!  I tasted each dish on the table and it they all exceeded my expectations.  I wish they had a brunch tasting menu!  :)  Make sure you try the biscuits with cranberry-apple butter.  The creamy dreamy grits are also a winner!"}
{"text":"Food, great. Service, terrible. Our waitress was Monique. She was not attentive in the least. I literally watched her talking in the back of the restaurant while my boyfriend and I sat with empty glasses. His food arrived cold (which indicates that it was sitting for a while, most likely). Nor was she very friendly.  Do yourself a favor and go to the other location."}
{"text":"Flying Biscuit is a great go to for brunch.  They have a lot of options and good coffee. It's become very popular since opening so expect a wait during peak times but it is worth it. And if it's a long wait they have been known to bring out coffee for everyone to sip on. Also don't be afraid to sit at the bar - it's laid out very well and I never mind sitting there.  Service has always been good."}
{"text":"The first time I had anything from  The Flying Biscuit was at a YELP event, with their shrimp and grits. I came back for at least 5-6 more cups, the stuff was amazing.  I finally got the chance to go and have breakfast here (not a huge breakfast fan), but I really enjoyed my self. The restaurant had a little but of a line out the door but we were seated within 10-15 minutes of arriving. I love that mustache guy   Service was good I had a giant pumpkin spice latte, it was HUGE! Followed by a  Clifton Omelette: Three large farm fresh eggs stuffed with goat cheese and mushrooms, topped with warm tomato coulis and basil, served with creamy dreamy grits  It was a lot of food after that latte and the Biscuits are amazing and huge -  had to take left overs home!   While it seems a little pricey for breakfast, you are getting some quality food that is unique and tasty! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  They have good coffee (imperative to brunch) and a mouth-watering menu.  The grits are by far the creamiest most delicious grits I've ever had and their breakfast plates always leave you full and happy.  The atmosphere is fun and we always get a seat quickly.  Plus they have a sweet patio out back!"}
{"text":"We love coming here for brunch. Be sure to call in if your party is bigger than 2, it's normally a 10 minute wait for a couple of people. It's always packed so service can get a little backed up. We sat at the patio yesterday, they have heaters, don't worry. I prefer to sit inside though, better to people watch while you wait for food.  I like to start off with a hot chocolate and those heavenly love cakes. The love cakes are soft but flavorful black bean cakes smothered in tasty salsa verde and topped with a dollop of sour cream and feta cheese crumbles. This is literally my favorite item on the menu and it doesn't make you feel bad for eating it. The chicken sausage gravy is my runner up fav menu item, it's so good with everything, especially home fries.  I normally order the smoked salmon scramble or the souther biscuit Benedict if I want to get crazy full. I only really like the Benedict if I take it home and reheat it. The salmon scramble has this amazing cream cheese and dill sauce. We've also got the side of grilled Mac and cheese, it's ok but needs some seasoning. The biscuits and huge and chalky, you will need gravy, butter, or jam to get through it.   Worth the wait, must try at least once."}
{"text":"Lately, the Mr and I have been referred to as \"Brunch People.\" And that's a role that comes with a lot of responsibility. Saturday and Sunday mornings often turn into a \"Where should we go for brunch?\" discussion before I'm even out of bed.   Fact. It was Sunday morning and I was hungry. Moving from the \"Oh, I could eat\" to \"I am going to punch someone if I don't get food immediately\" state of mind. After running through the list of places   a) open for breakfast/brunch at 9am b) we hadn't tried in a while/ever c) were close to our home...  we settled on the dependable Flying Biscuit.   In my heart, when I'm hungry and I think of breakfast, there is nothing more satisfying than the perfectly executed PASTA, SAUSAGE & EGGS. Say what you will about the rest of the menu, but this is one dish that they get right every time. Given my dietary and lifestyle choices, I always ask them to substitute soysage for the sausage, which the kitchen obligingly does.  For this dish, expect creamy eggs with cheese, penne pasta, sausage (or soysage), spinach, mushrooms (and maybe a bit of onion) all scrambled together into a perfect melange of all that is breakfast.  Fire that up with an unbelievably tall and bizarrely sweet biscuit topped with a squirt of apple butter and a side of creamy dreamy grits and I swear, it will be worth the 10 minute wait on a weekend.  Their coffee is notably not the worst I've had.   Other interesting, veggie-friendly things to try: - Fried green tomatoes (a twist on the traditional) - Orange scented french toast (order extra anglaise -- trust me) - Clifton omelette (winner)  I'm sure their non-breakfast offerings are good, but I can't stray from my favorites."}
{"text":"Second time's the charm!  We showed up with the same party that we did for the first go-round (party of 10).  This experience was mucccchhh better...minus the wait, which was a lot longer than the first time.  First off, our server Joseph was awesome. Our last server was meh but Joseph was TERRIFIC!!  Egg-ceptional eggs was terrific. Biscuits were much better.  Our wait was long but that just meant more time spent with our Navy BFFs before we were separated by oceans and countries.  Thanks to Joseph and the improved quality of food, we'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"I just went here last week, and was I surprised! The place is a lot bigger inside than I expected. Ended up getting the tofu and taters salad since it was closer to lunch and it still came with a biscuit. Sooooo good!!! I'm not sure I will ever eat anything else there! A must go!"}
{"text":"Great food and service, nuff said. I enjoyed the Piedmont omelette and creamy grits that are delicious and slightly different than classic grits. The biscuits are also outstanding."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!  My favorite is that they offer a Guiness with expresso (I usually go for 2 shots myself) - the best morning beverage ever. They have delicious food too - great place for brunch.    Best Tip about this place: There is a back patio that is very nice and quiet!!"}
{"text":"The flying biscuit has great breakfast and lunch options. Definitely the go to sunday breakfast spot."}
{"text":"First time, and I will be back. My husband and I stopped in for an early breakfast, and it was a southerner's breakfast dream. The southern style eggs Benedict was, hands down, the best thing I have eaten in a long time. Fluffy biscuit, pimento cheese, poached egg, turkey bacon, and hollandaise...this is refined country cookin' done right. The grits are better than my mama's and those three cheese Quaker grits that got me through college. Excellent food, excellent service, and excellent music in the background - nothing like Hall and Oates to start the day. Make this a to-do if you have yet to visit"}
{"text":"biscuits and gravy, throw a poached egg on top. best in town"}
{"text":"Eh, my first expierience here was just \"ok\".  After seeing many a Flying Biscuit without ever trying it, after living in Atlanta for several years, when the suggestion was made to go to Flying Biscuit for brunch I was looking forward to it.    I ordered the Steak n' Eggs w/ a substituted side of their grilled Mac n' Cheese and eggs scrambled with cheese.  Super healthy order.    The eggs were fine, what you would expect.    My steak was ordered rare and came out well-done.  They did promptly fix it and 10 mins. later I had my steak back while I was eating the rest of the food.  Overall taste of the steak was 4/5 stars, especially for a \"breakfast\" place.  Some of my friends were raving about the grilled Mac n' Cheese but I ordered it and wasn't impressed.  The grilled part of the grilled Mac n' Cheese makes it dry out a bit and have a strange \"grill\" flavor that is just not inherent to Mac n' Cheese in my book.  Overall, for $20 including tip, meal, and an iced latte - I've had way better brunches.  Would I try it again and order something different, sure but I'd probably stick with something more \"traditonal\"."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a breakfast spot that falls in-between Bojangles and a brunch spot on east blvd this is your place.I wasn't aware that this FB was a chain. You can't really tell from the decor. Located in the park road shopping center, Flying Biscuit is filled with little tables and booths covered in bright sunflower table clothes.Our waitress was attentive and she never let my coffee run low. Major brownie points for that. I ordered the Pimento eggs Benedict, it was really great. It was different with the pimento and super filling. I would go ahead and order that again. Colin got this odd oatmeal pancake, I don't think he will get that again. Overall, if you're looking for a quick diner like breakfast place, give Flying Biscuit a try."}
{"text":"We came here based on Yelp reviews, unfortunately we were not impressed. We came for brunch on Sunday, thinking there would be a line out the door because this place was rated so well but it was empty. There were 4 other tables, that should have been our first sign but our hunger overtook our common sense.  The waiter was friendly but did not bother to mention his name. We ordered the eggstavaganza, a kids meal ( flyer I think it was called), hash and eggs,coffee, chai latte,and kids milk. No refills offered.  The food was at best described as eh. Absolutely nothing special, we actually didn't even finish our plates. We love trying quirky restaurants but this one missed the mark by a mile.  This restaurant is touted for its delicious healthy food options by fellow yelpers but that claim fell flat on its face. Service was lacking, no fresh squeezed orange juice, the chai latte tasted like they made it from a box of Tazo chai latte at best, chicken sausage and turkey bacon tasted like rubber, and the biggest disappointment of all were the biscuits! They were dry, dense and burned, completely inedible. Just my humble opinion but shouldn't a place called The Flying Biscuit have phenomenal biscuits?!   Quick tip, if you ever find yourself in a seedy section of Charlotte don't worry just have a few of these biscuits on hand..a few teenage mutant ninja turtle moves later and you can ninja chuck your assailant until they flee for their life.  The only saving grace was the grits.. Who would think.. this Yankee now likes grits!"}
{"text":"Solid 4 stars goes to the Flying Biscuit Cafe.  Yes most of their items on their menu is a good bet for breakfast/brunch/lunch... but I think my favorite time to go is dinner.  1)  The place is not as busy and crazy and 2) who doesn't like breakfast for dinner??!!??  It's practically a staple at my house (especially when I moved out of my folks place and the main thing I knew how to cook were eggs).  I REALLY like the art on the walls.  I recognized a large piece from a local artist and I am sure most of the other pieces are probably local as well.  Good to promote the local art scene and makes for good breakfast for dinner conversation.  Everything I have tried thus far has been super delicious and well cooked.  It also helps that the items won't hurt the wallet/purse as bad - very comparable to other breakfast spots around town.  Bottom line:  watch out for weekend crowds, but this place is golden."}
{"text":"Omelet was great, biscuits were phenomenal but the grits were simply the best this 50 yo southern boy has ever had."}
{"text":"It's a nice place for breakfast if you're in the area, but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat there.  The staff is really friendly and helpful.  There is often a wait for a table on weekends.  I don't like their turkey bacon: it's not very meaty nor very flavorful.  The biscuits are nice, but certainly not the best I've ever had.  Overall, I think it's a bit pricey, and I take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Where do we start ? Another hot find in the Charlotte area. The Queen City is full of these hidden gems. We were initial almost discourage with the huge line outside but this was even more of a reason to give it a try (long line, must be good).  We were greet in a timely manner by nice gentleman. We waited roughly 15 to maybe 20 mins but boy wasn't the wait worth it.   Let's dive into the grub aka food (overall delicious). I ordered the southern scramble that consisted of all the mouth watering southern food (collard, applewood bacon, grits). The eggs were hands down amazing (fluffy, light and creamy). The collards and the bacon were a perfect match. The only thing that I would change were the onions that were a bit raw. However, this is not the best part yet!!  The grits!! (Creamy, buttery, smooth, and just simply mouth watering). The real MVP of this place were the grits.   The biscuits were good but really didn't see what all the hype was to be honest. They were a bit in the dry side but still good. Not taking anything away from this place.   (Maybe I was just blown away by the grits.)!!  Oh, let's not forget my wife food was amazing from what I gather from her empty plates. My wife ordered the meggixcan wrap which she loved.   The service was good, Claudia was quick and attentive. She was pretty busy but go figure right ? Amazing food equals busy place  Loved it."}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast spot in Charlotte! Unbelievably good food. The grits, the chicken sausage gravy, and the biscuits with apple butter is so good! Definitely check this place out if in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Me, Ben & James had to stop in and check out their breakfast, in a word...Wow! I had the salmon eggs benedict and it far exceeded my eggspectations!  Great coffee, great food and staff! Not bad for a franchise place.  It's get's busy so expect a wait if you don't get there early.  It's in the location where Elfrida's Florist used to be. It was one of the original tenants of Park Road for 52 years and closed in 2008."}
{"text":"I popped in and ordered shrimp and grits... Those grits are life! Creamy with excellent flavor I could eat them all day... The shrimp and sauce equally delicious :) Since I flew solo I sat at the counter and met the most interesting people! Foodies unite! Each dish comes with a biscuit and that biscuit was hot and fresh and not from a freezer! I WILL be back :)"}
{"text":"I have never eaten anything here that wasn't outstanding. Cheese grits, eggs Benedict, and a mimosa.  typically a small wait on weekend mornings. I've never waited more than 20 minutes but, it's completely worth it."}
{"text":"I got the turkey hash with eggs over medium. It was a great mix of turkey, potato, egg, and cheese. The complimentary biscuits was fluffy and the apple butter that they had on the table was incredible. Don't miss the apple butter."}
{"text":"This Flying Biscuit was a bit difficult for our group to find in the shopping center.  When we arrived we saw that there was already a line outside.  Luckily we were able to bypass the waste by sitting at the little (coffee) bar that they have.  My friends said that they had great coffee but that may have just been the hangover talking.  I ordered the Cajun Chicken Scramble with an extra couple of their famous biscuits.  The scramble had egg, cajun-seasoned chicken, goat cheese, onions, and sun dried tomatoes with a warm cajun tomato sauce.  It was ok.  With all of those good flavorful ingredients I expected a LOT more flavor.  There was very little goat cheese mixed in and those bites were my favorite.  It didn't help that I feel like my order was sitting in \"the window\" for a few minutes too long.  The biscuits are very good.  BIG.  Fluffy on the inside with a nice outer crust.  I really liked the cranberry apple spread.  It had an excellent bite and wasn't super sweet.  Our sever was very pleasant and took very good care of us.  The inside of the restaurant is so bright and has a cheery feeling that was perfect on our raining Monday morning.  The service, the biscuits, and the ambiance got Flying Biscuit to 3 stars because my entree was just really disappointing."}
