{"text":"My comments will mirror that of Alfred.

For one thing, this is now a Fox and the Fiddle. So when I bought the teambuy voucher, I figured, how could you go wrong since it's an established pub chain? We visited on a Thursday at 5:30 pm with two young children.

Well, the first warning sign was coming in through the front door when the smell of mildew / mold hit us. We were about to turn around since we had our children with us but heck, I spent $12 for the voucher and it was expiring in a few days.

Next was the fact that the air conditioning was not turned on. It was warm and muggy inside so we opted to sit outside on the patio. The patio isn't bad at all but it's frequented by smokers which they have the right and privilege to do but we had two young children with us.

There was only one server for the entire place, which shouldn't have been a problem but obviously she can only do so much. Service wasn't slow but it certainly wasn't as prompt as we had hoped. Anyone with young children knows that you want in and out as fast as possible before they lose their attention.

But the worst part was the food. The best part was the prepared pita which was served instead of naan with the chicken curry. My beef pot pie wasn't a pie at all. It was a stew with a square inch piece of dry, stale pastry.

I don't know how these establishment can use the Fox and the Fiddle name. It certainly cannot compare to others we have been to. 

I would recommend you stay away from this place and am considering communicating some of my concerns to the Peel District health board or equivalent."}
{"text":"A friend and I decided to each purchase a Team Buy voucher and try this place out.  Previous experiences with similar pubs had been great and this particular deal was highlighting their food so we said sure why not.  We used our vouchers within a couple of months of each other with the second trip taking place on July 28, 2012.  This second visit only confirmed for us that we should've never purchased these vouchers and we will never go back to this establishment.  

So let's see:

When we entered, on both occasions, there was no one available to seat you, so we found our own place to sit.  No big deal, except that the experience never got any better

It took 5+ minutes for the lone waitress who appears to be the only one who ever works there, to notice we were even there and to address us.
The food is nothing special at all, edible but not great.  On the most recent visit, our drinks (ginger ale) were watered down and the waitress, who I think is also the cook, gave a look as if that was normal before bringing us something different.  The bruschetta was crispy burnt on the outside and untoasted on the inside.  The apparently \"new\" sweet chili wings were substandard in flavor and below average in size.  The quesadillas was skimpy but did taste alright.  My plate and napkin were removed from the table while I was still eating. I was completely speechless when she took them.

We witnessed several other patrons wander in, confused about who was working or serving.  Some also sitting for several minutes then walking up to the bar looking for menus and service.  If the voucher's we purchased were not highlighting their food then we would've accepted the venue as just another pub with snacks which would've been alright.  But when your marketing scheme specifically highlights your menu with a picture of a steak as your main feature then you can't blame s for expecting more.  If you're going here as just a place to hang out and grab a few drinks then it's fine, but don't expect to get a proper meal or service from this place.  Other pubs in the area do a far better job in engaging their customers and with the quality of their food."}
{"text":"This place gets a 5 star right off the bat. Where I live BBQing on our balcony is prohibited so I go here to get my fix. I've tried the burgers, steak, chicken sandwich and the beef and chicken fajitas. All were really good, their flame grill really makes a difference. My fav world have to be the fajitas with sweet potato fries. They also serve local beer, the amber ale is awesome. There is a toppings bar with amazing sauces, guy said they are his mothers receipts; try the green one. Can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"Sorry to see that this place is not around anymore. I liked the food and I liked the staff and the owners who I met a couple of times."}
{"text":"Bought a Groupon for this place simply due to the location and the fact that I had never heard of them before. I wasn't expecting much (the cheesy name and small location made me think it was going to be a generic burger joint). My visit has turned me into a believer.

It's a quaint little establishment that basically looks like an upscale fast food joint with a bar (I believe this place used to be D Martini's).

I had a Cameron's Cream Ale (Oakville brewery that I hadn't seen on tap anywhere else) and the beef tacos and my gf had the chicken burrito. We also shared an order of the cassava fries. Everything was delicious and authentic (the tacos were on par with what you'd get at upscale Mexican joints like Milagro), service was great, the fresh sauces were amazing, and the best part - the prices were incredible. Even without the Groupon, our meal would have been $25. For a pint of craft beer and two delicious meals I can't complain.

I will definitely be back, I just hope that they shape up their marketing and drum up business so that they stay open. I never would have known this place existed if it wasn't for the Groupon."}
{"text":"I've been to this place once and didn't like neither food nor the service. Moreover, after witnessing the food preparation process,  I would NEVER go back to this place...  The cook/cashier first took my money then went to make the food without even trying to clean his hands. He was taking the meat and the fries with his dirty hands. He dropped the \"to go\" container on the floor, then picked it up and serve my food in it... Very unsanitary place with tasteless food!"}
{"text":"Have you ever tried cassava fries before? I never knew they even existed until I went to All Grill...

By the way, CASSAVA FRIES EFFIN ROCK! If you're a sweet patoto fries fan, cassava fries are even better! I do not lie. Take it from a true french fries fan.

All Grill is a semi-fast food restaurant (if that makes any sense?). I say semi-fast food because their food offerings are quite healthy since most of their items are \"all grilled\". Get it? Haha.

I'm quite upset that I've only been once. It's a little of a trek for me since it's in Mississauga, but I'm sure I'll be visiting in the next month. As I write this, my stomach is grumbling for fried cassava.

I had the grilled chicken breast sandwich/burger with cassava fries. Which was delish. What's cool about All Grill is they offer unique fixings for your burgers which include salsa and many original sauces (which are made in-house) such as their own special mayo in mild and spicy, a type of corn mayo sauce, a cheese kind as well and more. These sauces are also great to dip your cassava fries in!

I am writing this review in hopes that many of you reading this will go and dine here. It's location is pretty hidden and I don't want them to close down due to lack of business. So please take my advice and enjoy a healthy fast food meal here. Oh, and don't forget to order the cassava fries with your meal!"}
{"text":"Also bought a groupon for this place or never would have known it existed. Beware of parking in the underground parking lot though, my friend and I walked around for 10 minutes in the festering smell of urine before we were able to find it. It is much easier to find it above ground. Anyway, for a burger joint, the burgers were quite good, reasonably priced and you are able to choose your own toppings. The combo came with a mango salad which was fresh and quite an unique side dish."}
