{"text":"I was a huge fan of Champps  and when they closed wanted to find a similar sports bar that sold Potato Skins. I went on a hunt an this was one of the places that I tried. First issue was there was no were to park. We ended up parking were it might have been considered the side walk.(Good thing we were only doing takeout). I got 4 skins. Now they were a great size but they had no taste to them at all. It was undercooked and there was more potato then anything. I will give this place another try because I love sports bars but i'd probably try something else."}
{"text":"Wife and I decided to check out the best wings in NEO. In the opinion 
Of the Plain Dealer food critics. We were expecting to be blown away.
Very disappointing. Average wings. Bartender never asked if we wanted
Sauce & celery. Several wings were a bit chewy. Interior was in need of
Some upkeep the glass doors filthy. Parking lot is the size of a postage 
Stamp. Decent beer selection but we'll be winging it elsewhere."}
{"text":"Not a place you would generally find me, but my wife works up the street so it can be a convenient place to grab a beer if I have to pick her up.

Tap list is good, unexpectedly good. Decent prices on the beer as well. Grub is pretty typical bar fare. Service has been friendly and fast, although I'm always at the bar.

So if you are in Garfield Heights and want a good beer and decent food, there are many much worse options."}
{"text":"FYI: For yelp deal you need to print it out? That's what the manager informed me of.

We stopped in here last Sunday for the 2nd half of the batter of Ohio game. I will defiantly  go back. The food was good and moderate price, the fog horn under the bar after every touchdown was great! The service was good but I was surprised you needed to print the yelp deal. I also doubled checked -it being Sunday and all. They don't offer the special for Sunday games. At least this was my impression.

HD TVs everywhere and more seating in the back. 

Monday night football is free beer until someone scores. 

It is worth trying."}
{"text":"The cheese sauce with the pretzels tasted like hot dogs.  Eww.  Other than that it was a decent bar.  We played trivia which kept us entertained becuase there was little people watching to do given that there were only 3 other patrons.  The beer selection was reasonable.  I'd go back"}
{"text":"Here again this week .. Chicken and philly steak awesome .. I of course did the parmesan garlic wings .. The best"}
{"text":"We were recommended this place by a nurse at the Cleveland Clinic-Marymount, so we thought we'd try it out. After perusing the menu via the internet, we called and placed our order for pick-up. After getting out of the car in the absurdly designed (and hilly) parking lot behind this local watering hole, I could smell the grease from the fried food seeping out the back kitchen doors. When I entered the pub my first impression was that is was dark and dirty.  It was tiny and there were TV sets all lined up in a row across the walls (hence, the sports bar theme?) I picked up the food and headed back to the hospital. 

The potato skins were ok, nothing unique or special to ever make me order them again from there; an extra sour cream would have been helpful since the skins were big and loaded with lots of cheese. They looked good, but didn't taste any different from any other potato skin you could get anywhere else.

The BLT with ham sandwich that we got had FATTY UNCOOKED bacon on it. UUGGH.  We specifically REQUESTED on the phone that we wanted the bacon CRISPY (who doesn't).  We took all the bacon off the sandwich.  The bread was soft and soggy and, again, there was no \"signature\" statement to the sandwich that made it any different from a sandwich from any other dive bar.

The grilled cajun chicken salad did not look like anything I cared to try. I love salad but  there were no extra tomatoes put on it (we requested that since they were out of the avocado that was supposed to be on it). My sister ate the salad and enjoyed it, outside of the fact the \"honey mustard\" dressing (or whatever it was) was way-too watered down. It was like water! The side order of \"chips\" was TERRIBLE. No flavor and BURNT! We only ate a couple of them each.

On top of everything else, we didn't get any plasticware or salt and pepper (it was a TO GO order and we said we were calling from the hospital).

If you are into hanging out at depressing local watering holes and crankin' your elbow until you forget where you are, then check this place out. Go ahead and order the food - under the (un)sobering effect of the alcohol, you'll probably think the food is great 'cuz you get a lot of it.  

As for me, I prefer quality over quantity. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Wish I could give this place less than one star.. First off, the service wasn't \"horrible\".. But it also didn't help this place gain another star from me. We went late one night, only wanted drinks and some appetizers. Ordered mozzarella sticks, calamari and broccoli bites. Our drinks were made poorly, even with ordering doubles and extra shots on the side.. Everything was weak as if it were watered down. The mozzarella sticks were still cold in the middle, same with the dipping sauce. They served pieces of the calamari that weren't cut into pieces, and shouldn't have been eaten in the first place.. The broccoli bites were okay. Surprisingly. We spent over $100 on basically nothing. Will never go back. It's one of the closest bars to my house and I would rather drive farther. I even wrote the company/bar an email before I wrote this, because the receipt asks you to. I never got a response. Sorry - not paying for overpriced fried food, and watered down liquor. No thanks.."}
{"text":"This is a cool place but the service is slow. I feel bad for the servers because the kitchen really effects their tips. The food is alright. Nothing to special and they're not known for anything really. Poor mans \"Champs\"."}
{"text":"Typical bar atmosphere.  Good service. The wings are some of THE BEST I've ever had . Tried 5 different sauces and they were all good. You can get them smoked and that just adds to the flavor. The wings themselves are huge and cooked perfectly. Crispy outside and tender inside. I would go back next time I want wings"}
{"text":"Playmakers is our usual Wednesday karaoke place. The food is ok. And the price is pretty good. The karaoke on Wednesdays is pretty good but the guy who runs it has his regulars and tends to let them sing more than other people. The servers are nice and helpful when you need something. 

I have also been there before with people from work and everyone usually leaves happy and satisfied with their meal."}
{"text":"The food is tasty, the drinks are average. I went there a few times since I live up the road so I don't have worry about the parking lot (it's tiny and confusing.) I haven't been back in a while because the last time I put in an order for carry out the hostess insisted on taking my credit card. Now I understand it's frustrating if people don't pick up food they order but this made me really uncomfortable. When I did pick up my food she had my credit card number written on the order pad which she crumpled up. I was alarmed as asked for the sheet from the pad since it had my credit card number on it. She seemed really confused about why I would be upset about this. I haven't been back since, there are way too many local options to go to and not deal with a weird take out request."}
{"text":"Now this is a fish dinner!! All you can eat for 9.99....service is great and the owner comes out and says hello. They have full compliment of HD TV's to watch your favorite event. The food is always good. They have drink specials with a happy hour. Location is good close to 480."}
{"text":"Sat at a table for 15 minutes without any acknowledgment from bar staff or waitress who had only one other table. Ended up walking out. Extremely disappointed will not be back"}
{"text":"I think this is a great place for grabbing happy hour after work.  They recently re-did their menu and cut back on a lot of things so they can focus more on less food, which is great.  They have trivia on Tuesday nights, start as 7 and goes to about 9.  I had a such a blast playing it with my coworkers, and I think the girls in charge of it did a good job of keeping a good mix of questions.

The last few times I have been here, I have only had a couple different apps because I was on the happy hour menu, but even their burgers look pretty good. It's a place you can go a couple different times and get something different each time. I usually get this older red-headed waitress that tries to be as personable and friendly as possible-you can tell she's trying to make sure you have a good time so they can get repeat business, which is refreshing.  You can that employees like that care about the business (and why not, considering it's probably their livelihood).  Also a cool thing about this place: they have one of those popcorn machines so you can get yourself some popcorn to munch on while you're waiting for your food.  Or just as a side with your drink.

They made some changes to the place that I think are going to be for the better.  Just be careful where you park, because some of the surrounding businesses will tow your car if you park in their lot."}
{"text":"I was in Cleveland for business. I saw the awesome Yelp deal for this restaurant, so I went to check it out. However, the restaurant staffs knew nothing about the Yelp deal. Then after everyone ordered, the manager came and told us that we can't redeem the deal electronically and had to print it out, which absurd. So basically we all ordered all these overpriced food for nothing. Very poor customer service. Food is decent. Limited parking space for game nights."}
{"text":"I must say, the food was very good, when it arrived but, the wait time for the appetizers extended into the main course.  I think they may need to hire more cooks or something.  
 The menus look like they haven't been replaced in a good long time. 
The server was personable and friendly.  Nice guy.  I'd recommend it."}
{"text":"Oh, man!  There is a Yelp deal here?  I knew I should have checked in last night!

Overall I was really happy with Playmakers.  We ended up here after being turned away and turning away from a few other Garfield Heights establishments but overall, I think it's for the best.

There are a plethora of HUGE HD TV's, the volume was on at a good level, the wait staff was attentive and the other people at the bar were all very welcoming!

Plus, I was absolutely impressed by the food!  Their burgers were huge and Mmm...splurge for the $2 onion rings!"}
