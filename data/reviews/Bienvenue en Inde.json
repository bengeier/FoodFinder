{"text":"Probablement un des meilleurs restaurant indien à Montréal. Vous devez absolument essayer le poulet au beurre. Les oignons bhaji avec la petite sauce au yogourt sont fantastiques. Nous en mangeons régulièrement et c'est toujours bon. Les portions sont généreuses. Les spéciaux du midi valent aussi le coup."}
{"text":"Ordered a non spicy dish that arrived very spicy. They took it back to the kitchen and basically just added a ton of cream to reduce the spicy taste, which made it basically just tasting cream.   Very disappointed for a pricy restaurant. Won't recommend and won't come back."}
{"text":"I ordered butter chicken, it was unbearably sweet and chicken was too dry. Serving water from reused Evian plastic bottle was kind of weird. Service was good though."}
{"text":"It was my first time having Bhurma chicken and that was pretty good, and so was the rice. I am the biggest fan of butter chicken and order it at every Indian restaurant I visit, and I didn't like this one at all. It is very pasty and the sauce is a bit strange to my liking. One note, the spiciness level is very low. Had medium spicy and you could barely tell."}
{"text":"Same comment as Janine. Very nice host but that's all. Pretty disappointing food, bland taste. 2 dishes, 1 rice, 1 nan, 45$ (incl. Tax and tips). Not worth it at all!"}
{"text":"Tonight was our second experience with this restaurant. We did a pick up order and got the 15% off discount. Very impressed with the service and an absolutely delicious butter chicken!! Will be going back very soon....hard to find a good take out place around here that we enjoy this much."}
{"text":"Amazingly delicious entres. We had a take out done last night and they delivered it to our home nearby (Airbnb). The prices are remarkably cheap and quality and quantity of the food was very good. We're definitely patronizing this place again during our 4 day sojourn in Montreal.  The only gripe was that the delivery man took 20 extra minutes and didnt even apologize for the delay. Result = low tip."}
{"text":"I got into a jazz of making garlic naan at home.  Didn't have ingredients to make any curry to go along with the naan though... So we took a walk down to the closest Indian restaurant. We got take out - saag paneer and aloo ghobi.  Both were fine.  About three and a half stars,  so I'm rounding it up to 4. We had a weird moment when paying - they advertise free delivery and 15% discount on self pickups, but the guy didn't give us the discount because the order didn't reach a minimum sum of 15$ (we were 2 cents under). This minimum isn't advertised, not on the website and not on the menu at the restaurant where it says the discount applies to all pickups. It felt weird to argue about it,  and kind of pissed me off...  Long story short,  we got the discount, but it made the experience a bit less enjoyable.  Food was good though. I'll consider giving them another try in the future.  If you want to eat there, I recommend the tables near the window - the inside of the place is a bit dark."}
{"text":"Très bon restaurant Indien, service impeccable et serveur très agréable. Nous avons pris un menu dégustation pour deux, très copieux mais il manquant tout de même un peu d'épices... Dommage..."}
{"text":"I had this place for delivery and we ordered the butter chicken, naan, palao rice, onion badgi, samosa and lamb bhuna. Everything was very good. I've ordered from 6 or 7 indian restaurants in Montreal, and this is the best I've tried so far. Will order from here again. The butter chicken was velvety and the lamb bhuna was flavorful. Also the dessert was fresh and not made a week ago."}
{"text":"First plus: best lamb curry of life. I've had lamb curry before - I know what's good. HOWEVER, the butter chicken was too sweet for my liking (and my date agreed) - I would definitely not order it again. We had a combo plate for 2, which also included a vegetable side plate (tasty) and a few other little appetizers which were also yummy: delicious sausages and pakoras with really good dipping sauces. The naan bread, though, was not as good as it could be - I've had much, much better naan.   We showed up very late, like about twenty minutes before the kitchen was closing at 11pm, and were still served but asked to make a decision quickly. Our gracious waiter served us water out of a reused 2L Evian plastic water bottle (hilarious? or in bad taste? I'm not sure) and poured it like it was expensive wine. Kinda hilarious, actually. I ordered a martini, which came in a short water glass with ice cubes, not a martini glass, and was not a real martini but one of those pre-mixed \"martini\" drinks. OK, so it's not classy. However, the décor was quite comfortable and cozy, though I was a little turned off by the fact that the table cloths were not removed and washed after dinner guests had finished their meals and left - the waiter would simply come over with a damp cloth and work hard to scrub off any food stains that might have happened. My date and I were laughing up our sleeves as we observed this slightly absurd behavior.   My recommendation: try it once. If you don't mind spot-cleaned table cloths, water served in re-used plastic water bottles (with the labels still on them and very worn out, I might add), then you'll find a good plate of food. Somewhat on the pricey side, so they *really* need to work on their naan.  I must also mention that we took our leftover food home with us, because it had cost us a fair bit and there was a lot left over. I was disappointed when I got home and discovered that they hadn't given us all the food that we had leftover - they only gave us what would fit into their styrofoam container."}
{"text":"Really good butter chicken and environment was delightful. The service was amazing and their nan bread is one of a kind. I always come every month"}
{"text":"Un restaurant tout près du metro Laurier, très calme et paisible. J'y suis allée dernièrement avec mon copain et on a vraiment tous les deux appréciés notre moment (si tu cherches un endroit pour une date).   L'ambiance était parfaite avec la musique de fond et l'éclairage faible grâce à quelques bougies. Les serveurs étaient aimables, serviables tout en étant discrets.  On a choisi un menu entier pour deux personnes, assez copieux à base d'agneau, de poulet au beurre et de légumes. Une entrée pour deux, du pain nan et un dessert.   Je ne suis pas une très grande connaisseuse de la cuisine indienne mais c'était bon, pas trop cher et un bon endroit pour profiter d'un moment tranquille à deux."}
{"text":"I feel bad even writing this review given how nice the host was, but alas, I have had a lot better. After living in Vancouver for years and having easy access to awesome, authentic and cheap Indian food, I think that I know the difference between great vs. mediocre Indian food.   I had quite possibly THE world's biggest craving for some saag paneer and my 45 minute walk from the office was made happier with thoughts of tucking into my take out bag of goodness.  The host here is amazing: sweet, nice and ever so helpful. The restaurant itself is your typical Indian restaurant and it smelled good and is literally across the street from the Laurier Metro; super convenient. Perhaps it is because I ordered my food to go, I don't know, but it was watery, lacking spice and was just plain 'meh. Maybe they gave me 'white girl spice' or sped up the cooking time as I looked ravenous/about to chew my own arm off...I dunno. I will go back and actually eat in the restaurant to give them another chance, but my first impression is that of: this place is nothing special."}
{"text":"Restaurant indien décevant. Le service était impeccable mais nous avons été déçu par la nourriture, surtout pour le prix demandé. J'ai pris un poulet au beurre qui m'a coûté le double d'un équivalent d'un kiosque de restauration rapide pour la moitié de la quantité. J'aimerais pouvoir dire que la qualité en valait la peine mais cela semblait être du poulet bouillie qui après avoir été coupé en cube à été déposé dans la sauce au moment du service (très bonne sauce mais le poulet n'avait pas de goût). Les crevettes tendori était dans une assiette de bonne proportion mais le mélange d'épices était beaucoup trop salé (j'aimerais dire semblable à un mix préfait mais je ne veux pas sonner méchant). Ce n'était pas mon premier restaurant indien mais c'est bien la dernière fois que je vais aller à celui-ci."}
{"text":"Contrairement aux autres commentaires, après plusieurs essaies à différents restaurants indiens, mon copain et moi sommes méga-giga-fans de ce resto! La nourriture fut toujours impeccable et le staff très gentil. en plus le 15% de rabais au comptoir pour emporter ne fait pas de mal au budget."}
