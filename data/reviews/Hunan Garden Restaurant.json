{"text":"We had dinner at Hunan Garden Restaurant ( Metro Square, 3636 Steeles Ave E, Markham, ON )  on Sept-21-2012, Friday and  was surprised how the waitresses' customer service skill and the credibility of this restaurant.
- It's a long menu and I admit that gives customer various choices. However, one of the chubby waitress was not very patient about the speed of people trying to understand what's in the dishes (note: we aren't from china, so not very familiar with Hunan cuisine). She came in between my husband and myself twice, literally invaded the personal space (You can feel her breathing to your hair) and keep peeping what we wrote on the paper she wrote us....... If you see people having hard time with the menu, ask them if they need help or explain to customer you are trying to help, instead of interrupt customers. ..we don't understand what's the rush (as there weren't too many customers in the restaurant at all) and the rude attitude........later on, we saw her again doing the same thing to other customers........It seems this restaurant requires customers to finish reading and make their decisions within 2 mins upon arrival.
- I made phone call about a week ago before visiting this restaurant to confirm the payment method. The lady who answered the phone confirm that they accept credit card.......However, on the day we visited,  the waitress told us they only accept Debit and Cash...... I felt kinda weird and decided to make a phone call from the parking lot after we finished the meal.....Again, I asked the same question \" do you accept credit card payment?\" he lady who answered the phone call said Yes we do...but when I told her that why did one of your waitress just told me that you guys only accept cash or debit card only about 10 mins ago? then that lady responded \"ohhhh I forgot that we stop accepting credit card now...\" ........... i wonder this is how they cheat on Revenue Canada.

I am really surprised of how this restaurant operates....no wonder there aren't too many customers there by comparing to the number of customers the Backyard Garden restaurant has right beside them."}
{"text":"Hunan food is generally hard to find. We are particularly picky when it comes to chinese, and we we thrilled to have found Hunan Garden.

We ate at 3:30 in the afternoon on sunday, and they were still doing brisk business. 

We ordered too much food for the two of us - but we knew we would (since we have to drive more than an hour to get here). We had a noodle dish for an appetizer, Mao's Red Braised Pork, Pork and Tofu, and a mushroom dish. It was all good, and we'll be back with a larger group next time.

The only complaint is that the spiciness rating was inconsistent on some of the dishes - some items with more peppers on the menu were not as spicy as other dishes with fewer."}
{"text":"Amazing food! 

Their lamb skewers are a speciality. SO delicious.

Great cold noodles, too. 

I also like their lamb on a plate served with the white buns."}
{"text":"She'll let you in her house
If you come knockin' late at night
She'll put food in your mouth
If the words you say are right (they don't speak much English or Cantonese for that matter)
If you pay the price
She'll let you deep inside
But there's a secret Hunan garden menu she hides
You'll need to have a car
To go drivin' 'round
She won't feed you the food herself
That'll bring you down
She'll let you in her heart
If you got a hammer and a vise
But into her secret Hunan garden menu, I'd really think twice!

You've gone a million miles
How far'd you get
To that place where you can't remember
And you should probably forget

She'll lead you down a path
There'll be grease and oil in the air
She'll let you come just far enough
So you know she's really there
Then she'll look at you and smile
And her eyes will say
She's got a secret Hunan garden menu
Where everything you want
Where everything you need
Will always stay
A million miles away"}
{"text":"went to this place for lunch on a weekend, it was pretty empty. passed by it a lot, and wasn't expecting much. went with a party of 4. This place the menu has a mix of sichuan cuisine an cantonese cuisines, which usually makes me weary cause they are very different styles of cooking. However it turned out that the food was pretty decent for the most parts. most of the food was very flavorful, and the portions were decent. The price was also pretty good for what you get. I think they only dish was we did not like was the hot spicy fish. The res such as the cold dish with beef, the sweet and sour chicken, the pork  belly stir fry, these were pretty good. I am looking forward to trying this place again, with a few more people so we can sample the other dishes. perhaps even see if their weekday lunch specials are any good. Overall i would recommend other try it if you have a group of friends who have very different tastes , good place to share food with people. 

the service itself was the usual chinese place so not spectacular but efficent"}
{"text":"My mother and I came for lunch today. All the smaller tables at the restaurant were taken. Actually, most of the tables, except the ones reserved for large parties, were taken. The lone server gestured us to a table at the front with a large potted plant on it. One of the two chairs at this table was almost fully blocked by a man sitting at the table behind this chair. My mom couldn't sit down until that man moved (the server had to gesture at him to move). The table itself had an expansion that was folded in partially under the table, so there was less space for our legs. The table was not meant for customers. It had cardboard boxes on it prior to our sitting down.

Once we sat down, we requested that the server wipe the table (cardboard box dust and all). We asked in Cantonese and English, and even mimed the table wiping. The server told us she didn't speak English or Cantonese, turned around and left. 

Another woman, possibly the owner, thought we wanted to order. We asked her to have our table wiped. She said that if another table opened up, she would have us relocated. Then she and the server proceeded to put our table settings down on the table. My bowl had a bit of dried rice on the side. They never ended up wiping the table or relocating us. We had to wipe our own table. Ah. The plant also never left our table. This caused me more distress than my mother, because the plant was to my mother's left and she is right-handed. The plant was to my right, and every time I wanted to place my chopsticks on my plate, I had to do so carefully as not to touch the plant. I tried sitting closer to the left of the table, but the table extension was in the way. I don't think I've ever been closed in by a table extension and a plant before.It wasn't fun.

They gave us the lunch menus. Lunch menus are applicable Monday to Friday. The menu was entirely in Chinese. I don't read much Chinese, so I needed my mother's help translating. FYI, they have one of the lunch menus in English on their takeout menu. They also have that same lunch menu in English outside of their restaurant on the window. And just another FYI, because this may not be the most obvious thing, their $4.75 lunch entrees do not come with rice. Rice is a dollar extra.

They have a $4.99 lunch menu that I could not find in English. This one contains their fried rice/noodle, soup noodles, etc. This comes with soy milk or soup. I opted for soup after seeing their crusty soy milk pitcher. 

The soup was hot and sour soup. It was pretty good, but it wasn't hot enough temperature-wise. It wasn't particularly hot spice-wise and it wasn't particularly sour either. I believe mine had a few bits of raw garlic in it too. That being said, the soup contained plenty of fungus bits, carrot bits, bamboo shoot bits and what felt like egg drop. I quite enjoyed the soup.

What we ordered: 

Lamb meat and cabbage soup noodle ($4.99): They say that the soup has been boiling for a long time (making the soup more flavorful). The soup had good color and it was not a clear soup, but a slightly thicker soup, but the predominant flavor was that of white pepper. The noodle base was really good. The noodles were not thick noodles, which is a plus in my book. They were also a good texture. They had some chew, but they were not super chewy. The cabbage was either pan fried until it got burnt edges, or they gave us cabbage with a considerable number of brown bits. Same goes for the slices of garlic and the green onions. All had brown bits. The lamb had some lamb taste, but I wish there was more lamb taste. I also wish there was more lamb. Texture-wise, the lamb was not super tender, but it was also not super dry. Ah. This dish also has a few sliced carrots and black fungus in it. Those were not particularly note-worthy, but better to have them than not have them. This dish had some steam coming off of it when it came to the table, but it could still have been hotter.

Something between a braised and a stir fried vermicelli with shredded meat, dried shrimps, Chinese mushroom, onion, and green onion ($4.99). This came out piping hot and steaming. It was great. There could have been more shredded meat in this, but I found the dry shrimps, and couldn't complain. The portion was pretty good too. This was fairly standard in terms of taste. I would not come back to the restaurant just for this.

Their regular menu has some interesting things on it. They have some kind of diced rabbit, braised frog legs, and some kind of turtle soup. 

Noise level: During lunch, some lady was leaving and, standing next to our table, started yelling across the restaurant to others in her party.

Perhaps I will come back with a larger group (as to avoid the table of doom). There are still things I'm curious to try. They have a spicy shredded chicken that sounds good. They also have a Beijing style ja jang myun and a Northern Chinese style cold noodle that sound good. 

Total damage for this trip: $12.60 after ta"}
{"text":"I thought the food here was amazing, especially because lamb skewers are one of my favourite things to eat, and the ones served here tasted pretty damn authentic.

We came here for dinner and the menu was pretty extensive. Great for those that enjoy spicy foods. We arrived at 7pm and the restaurant was full, with people lined up, until 9pm. I would highly recommend making a reservation ahead of time.

The reason why I'm not giving Hunan Garden a 5-star review is because the service was absolutely AWFUL. I'm pretty used to brusque service at Chinese restaurants in Toronto, but this was the next level of rudeness. We asked one of the waiters for clarification on the size of a noodle dish and how many we should order to feed a party of six. Instead of simply responding with a number, we got a condescending lecture on how we already ordered a combo that comes with a noodle dish and when we asked again if we should order an extra one, the waiter literally responded with a loud sigh, \"You still don't get it? You already ordered one\". Well, thank-you-very-much for stating the obvious, but we're a hungry group of people and maybe one plate, especially in a combo deal, is not enough! We did end up deciding to ordering an extra plate, which was good because they only provided a tiny bowl of noodles that was probably only meant to feed two people at the most. It didn't get much better as dinner went on.

Because of the poor service, I'm not sure if I will be returning, which is a pity since the food was pretty good (and I LOVE lamb skewers!). However, there are other great options in the area who I think would be more appreciative of their customers."}
{"text":"Good deal for the lunch special. Around 5 dollars per order. We v order 4 and the taste is good. However the dishes are not clean enough. Good place for ppl who like spicy food."}
{"text":"My husband is a huge fan of Hunan food but oh man! the owner is so snobby. We've been there approx. 6-7 times, half of the times they messed up a dish or two. She never really apologized or gave us discount. All she kept saying is that \"the restaurant is so good that many customers from small towns outside GTA would come a long way to eat here\". I'm like, is this has anything to do with my meal? 
Anyway after several disappointments we just stopped going.

To be fair, the waitresses there are just fine. It's just the owner I cannot stand.
Their food, sometimes when it's good, is really good. But the quality just fluctuates, like, every time you go it's like a surprise party."}
