{"text":"Hey I've been eating here for over  a decade and I have yet to find a better duck curry than at redd afire it's like it made with a passion and a flavor that comes genuine from the heart I've tried duck all over the gta  but haven't had any even come close another superb dish among many in this restaurant is the pepper shrimp if you like flavor this is definitely the place to savor the true Caribbean taste and at night the Rythm and warmth of the fabulous staff I'm my humble opinion redd afire is a true hidden gem in the gta one to be definitely savoured"}
{"text":"This place is not half bad, they cater more to drinkers than to people who want to eat their food.  Been here a couple of times, and I must say, I think they have the best chicken fried rice in Mississauga.  It was better about a year and a half ago when the fried rice had some mix of indian spices, but still, the fried chicken is crispy and delicious, albeit small.   The fried chicken seems to be prepared fresh.  However, the dhalpuri is dry and not fresh.  Also, the curry chicken to go for two is the same size as the curry chicken for one to go at Leela's roti, which is located in the same plaza.  You do not get a receipt here, so I'm not sure how they come up with their random rounded-off total  bill.  I would still go back for the chicken fried rice. Note however, that one time I went they said the cook had gone home so there was no chicken fried rice. Too bad! They should really focus more on their food because some of the menu items are good, including the chicken curry which actually had aloo."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend in search for chicken roti. Now in this plaza there's another roti place but we chose to come here. And as soon as we walked in here we kinda figured out it was more of a bar/billiards kind of place. 

While we were waiting for out food, This guy who was staring at us from the parking lot, In whom i assumed worked there was sitting at the bar was talking to my friend asking her about her life story. Meanwhile the owner kept trying to get me to add some alcohol in my guava juice, kept asking me about 5 times. It was an uncomfortable feeling, I kept wondering where Our food was So we can dip on out of there. 

Our chicken roti was very simple and dry, not like other Rotis Iv tried. It was just so bland. Now my friend is west Indian and she Didn't really like it Either so I knew it wasn't just me. 

Next time I think I'm gonna go to the other roti place that's in the plaza."}
