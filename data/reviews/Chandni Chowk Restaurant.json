{"text":"Nice papri chaat & kulfi but very lame gol gappe (pani purre) ..."}
{"text":"This place is ugly, service depends on who's there but the food is always great! If you don't mind sitting on bright green chairs and promise yourself not to take a trip down to the stinky bathroom then you're good to go. The foot long is delicious. I'm craving it right now! The tandoori chicken (without bone) is to die for. The karahi gosht has that lamb smell that is not tolerable for me but you might like it. I try not to associate my food with animals as much as I can but sometimes the smell reminds me and I wanna barf.
 
You really get the most for your money here!

I will keep coming back here to try other items."}
{"text":"Really tasty authentic Indian food... we order for delivery once every couple of months whenever we need a good curry 'fix' :)

Delicious fresh ingredients, generous portions, and very reasonably priced, especially the 'dinner for two'.  My fave is actually the Aloo Gobi, although the naan and curry chicken are really nice too.  Hubby's fave is the Lamb Biryani.

They get busy sometimes though, so I always ask before I place an order just in case, how they're doing!  (I think they must have big parties or something once in a while and won't deliver, rarely though I suppose...)"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time when they were set up outside during a festival. The chicken tikka is amazing!!! Saw them cook it right in front of us and went back the next week for more. Everything was delicious- defiantly a place to hit up in the bazaar. Good prices too!"}
{"text":"This place should be named the best Kabab and Biryani place in whole of Ontario. The owner is so courteous and welcoming that it makes this place all the more appealing. The food here be it Chicken Tikkas or Chicken/Lamb Biryanis or Reshmi/Seekh Kababs, is exactly the flavour and taste you would get in India/Pakistan. I come all the way from Ottawa, just to eat and bring food back to last me a couple of days. The quantities are big enough to feed well 2 adults. Would whole heartedly recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"Chandni Chowk are definitely no frills, but their food is really very good and at a great price. Recommend - especially the Keema and Chicken Tikka. The naan bread is also soft and fresh. Good, accurate and timely service."}
{"text":"Well , I have eaten here a few times before, but after what I witnessed tonight, NEVER EVER AGAIN. I witnessed the most disgusting thing.  I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw the owner take some salad and sauces that was left by previous customers dirty tray back in with the new stuff.  DISGUSTINGLY NASTY AND GROSS. This was food that the previous customer was eating.  No frigging way I will ever be eating here again."}
{"text":"They are AMAZING! I recently put in an order for 20 people and they had everything ready before my time for pick up and they helped me load the car.  More importantly, though, the food was AMAZING.  EVERYONE enjoyed it the food."}
{"text":"This place has authentic kaachi gohst ki biryani, and it's absolutely divine! I've searched high and low for a place that serves this, and I'm so glad I found CC. In case you're wondering what it is, it's when the raw marinated meat is cooked over a slow flame with half-cooked rice. They're chicken biryani and bihari kababs are also great. I would highly recommend this place for anyone wishing to sample a taste of Hyderabad's royal cuisine- just make sure you call ahead and order for pickup to avoid long wait times."}
{"text":"This place is by far the best Hyderabadi food place I have been too! One of the best dinner places on Gerrad! There Bihari kabab and Lamb Biryani is a must try!"}
{"text":"Man this place is grimy as hell! Everything is old and dirty including the guys that work here. No care in the world for food safety and the guys are pretty rough. 

Been here a few times with average experiences but the last time was my last time. Ordered 2 foot long kababs one was full of fat (solidified hard pieces). Took it to the guy up front who refused to give me a refund. The guy in the back was preparing some kababs, picked up the piece of chewed beef fat off my plate and claimed that's how it was. He then proceeded to continue preparing the kababs. No gloves, no washing his hands. Disgusting!! We both knew that's not what it's supposed to be like. Definitely not returning to this dump. The city should shut them down for how dirty they are."}
{"text":"Great Naans! Biryani and chicken tikka also great. Took it to go.....was pleased :-)"}
{"text":"I always frequented Lahore Tikka when i went to gerrard. However i find that they became over-priced for little portions. Chandni Chowk is the opposite. They even managed to get a bigger space and expand. Definitely worth the value for qualityy"}
{"text":"I walked in to this restaurant and saw a customer who already ordered something, walking away saying it was getting late for him and he doesn't need whatever he ordered. I ordered a veg Biryani and they asked me to pick it up in 15 mins and Later when we went and asked about it after 20 minutes the guy at the counter asks us to pay for it again. When I showed him the receipt he was very rude and snapped at me saying I should realize he was too busy taking orders to cook. The worst part was he did not accept that he forgot the order neither was he sorry."}
{"text":"Great place. Very simple but clean.
Good moderately priced. 
$4.25 for a kabob might seem a lot but it's a foot long.. So the price reflects the size and taste of the meal. 
Enough food to fill you in but not overload."}
{"text":"Excellent food. I love the foot long kabab and always go there for it and chicken tikka with naan. Naan is fresh and tasty u cant stop eating."}
{"text":"So I was walking down Gerrard St trying to kill time in between meetings and stumbled upon this place. Being rather bored of Lahore Tikka House (mostly due to its decline in quality and taste) I decided to give this place a try. 

First impressions wouldn't leave you \"speechless\" so to speak, but if you can overcome the basic and dilapidated decor you're in for a real treat! I ordered the foot long kebab and naan as it was highly recommended to me by fellow Yelpers and the owner himself. The kebab and naan was made to order, something I appreciated as that doesn't usually happen anymore; however this caused my meal to take some time to make. Once I got my meal I was very happy with the taste and quality, both the naan and kebab tasted phenomenal. I unfortunately didn't get to try anything else as they were closing midday for religious reasons (they close around 2pm on Fridays for prayers). I intend to back one day and sample other things on their menu as this place does look somewhat promising."}
{"text":"I have been going to this place since I was small, almost 20 years now and I have to say they don't disappoint. We always order the naan kababs with chicken biryani. The food is always fresh and service is great. The kabobs are mouth watering, have the right amount of flavour and are well cooked. I will continue to visit this place for many years to come!"}
{"text":"Wow Chandni Chowk was one of my faves when I was a kid as my Grandparents lived in the area. However, years have gone by and both have since passed on, so I frequent Gerrard St. less often as before. It doesn't change the fact that these guys have some of the best tasting kababs and tikka in the city and the aromatic smells hit you in the face on the way in.

Prices have risen over the years to reflect the local competition and inflated operational costs, but given the fresh and quality foods being served I don't mind that much. Portion sizes have remained the same, which also speaks volumes about their willingness to provide consistency. The seating area is a little beat up, and I would recommend against sitting close to the tandoors (large cylindrical clay ovens) because it gets really hot. Other than that, I've been twice recently and it's always such a treat that brings back good memories.

Recommendations:
-Chicken Tikka w/ Naan
-Foot Long Kabab"}
{"text":"Came here with my family on Eid ul Fitr for dinner. I know, bad idea considering Eid on Gerrard, but we were desperate and hungry. This seemed to be the only place that had enough seats for my family of 5 people. 

The line was super long, but it was Eid, so I don't blame anyone. My family and I had our orders ready, and when we ordered, the man at the cash register informed us that there was no chicken in their kitchen. This was a real bummer considering my whole family basically wanted some kind of chicken (chicken breast, chicken tikka etc). So quickly, noting the line behind us, we ordered beef \"footlong\" kebabs instead. My brother ordered the mutton chops. In about three minutes, our orders of kebabs arrived with naan, some chutney, and some basic salad (few pieces of torn lettuce and chunks of onions). The man at the front informed us that the mutton chops would take another 10 minutes. 

The naan and kebabs were cold once we put them in our mouths. We were so hopeless at this point, however, because we had no choice but to eat it to feed our stomachs! 

Later, the mutton chops arrived, and it was also accompanied with naan. Both of these items were beyond fresh, which left the rest of my family somewhat upset. 

After we finished our food, we were able to get our free kulfis that are offered after you pay the bill. Kulfis were the best part of the evening. 

On our way out, there seemed to be some commotion, and we discovered that there was vomit on the floor. There was only one waiter that night, and he was clearly overwhelmed from all the Eid customers. I couldn't help but feel bad for him upon seeing his face when he was told to clean the vomit.

One star for this place that shouldn't really exist. Bad decor, bad service, and bad food. Will definitely never return here again. Maybe my expectations are too high?"}
{"text":"It's amazing how much nostalgia a foot long can spark in someone.
My family used to frequent here when I was a kid and continue to do so. I have a fond attachment to the place. My favourite part was watching the naan come out fresh from the tandoor.

The long beef kebab is deliciously flavourful, but isn't spicy, which makes it great for kids. It comes with warm, soft naan and a bit of salad. You also get sauces on the side. The red sauce is amazing. It's got a sweet but tangy kick to it and I dip everything on my plate in it!
Their vegetarian dishes at the counter are good, but not my favourite.
It isn't luxurious by any means but it's affordable and good for big families."}
{"text":"I went here years ago and tried their seek (beef) kebab and they were amazing back then.
Went on a sunday night...

-Seek kebab (No char marks, lacked BBQ flavour, but still \"good\")

-Butter Chicken (small takeout styrofoam cup, was sweet, which was a turn off; few chicken pieces since small syrofoam bowl)

-Tikka Chicken (same small styrofoam bowl, much better than their butter chicken and more savoury than butter chicken; very good)

-Rice (plain and boring, obviously just a base for their currys)

Price was about $20 per person after tip. 
Low value overall. 
My gripes are that they serve their hot currys (butter chicken tikka chicken, etc.) in a stupid little styrofoam bowl, so it is a very small amount compared to any other decent South Asian restaurant and it is dangerous for a person's health to consume any hot food that is held in a plastic container. 
The kebobs lacked the old BBQ flavour. No rush to visit again."}
