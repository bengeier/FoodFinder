{"text":"Food here taste like the food back home at a Chinese restaurant, but the prices are more but any who it's ok and the seating are limited when its packed so find a spot and hurry out."}
{"text":"$16 for a drink, noodles and tofu. Tried to charge 2$ more because they chose to package in separate containers. It was so poorly made we threw it out,"}
{"text":"shopping for break and rest in the restaurant.  we ordered two items with chicken and pork, just so so"}
{"text":"considering its a chinese restaurant, i didn't see any Chinese staff. the food was not even worth the price! it was too expensive and nothing compared to panda express. the food was great but it was nothing to write home about. if you guys are craving chinese good while in the outlet, better just eat before going there or after because you'll be surely disappointed."}
{"text":"I loved the food, I think is the best food in the food court. Very good service the manager was very nice to us explained to us every combo, we end up buying Lucky combos because it was the best choice. I will definitely come back here with my family."}
{"text":"The hispanic ladies who work here always have a nasty ass attitude, especially if you ask for certain things in your food. For example, i love broccoli so i asked for her to give me more broccoli than cabbage when giving me the vegetables option.. One of the workers has done that for me before, but any time after that, no one gives me what i ask for & instead give me attitude & basically throw my food at me. 
I am PAYING for MY food, give me what the f*ck i want. & change your attitudes or quit your job!"}
{"text":"This is first time I ever leave feedback. This time I decided to leave feedback for worst experience.
They pretend you are tourist and treat you never see you again. You deserve better and do not have to ruin your day whilie you are traveling."}
{"text":"Cashier is horrible.  she's in a hurry.  only one customer behind us.  she is not patient enough.  dont go here.  not good at.  customer service."}
{"text":"plain and simple.....
do not eat here, i'd rather have a bag of beef jerky then to ever eat here again negative stars if i could."}
{"text":"The combination was great. We had \"lucky combo\" 
Sesam chicken, vegetables, Shrimps, noodles or rice and a spring roll. Price: ~10$ 
Very tasty. We go there again"}
{"text":"I agree with Lovely I. review. Service crews are unbelievably rude.  The Hispanic service woman got a very bad attitude.  I asked her about the price that she charged me, instead of explaining slowly, she talked fast.  I asked her again and again for the third time because she intentionally explained it fast that I had a hard time understanding her.  I asked her who is her supervisor.  She pointed to the woman next to her.  The supervisor, if she was really the supervisor, did not even acknowledge what was going on.  She ignored the whole thing about the rude employees.  She was so rude laughing about the whole situation.  UNBELIEVABLE!!!!!   I can't believe the owner of the store put up with this attitude.  Fire her!!!!!!  Like Lovely's comment, I will report this to the Better Business Bureau."}
{"text":"Never again I'll ever come back at this place. 1st we were told to hurry up because she is busy and the fact we were all together in one group. No one is behind us nor anybody else. We order 3 two item combo and one chow mein in a box by itself, everything was given to us less than expected Panda Express gives more than what they gave us for the price. This place needs to shut down or change the front crew for their rude attitude. By the way we were not tourist of any sort we live in Las Vegas and I'll make sure u guys will be given one star."}
{"text":"First timer at Kung Pao Wok and immediately I noticed how busy and popular it is. Great combinations, I ordered the Create Your Own Combo with 2 items (Fried Rice, Steamed Veggies and Sesame Chicken). Tasted delicious and moderately priced. 

I was very impressed with the staff though. They worked well under pressure and were fast paced to ensure everyone was taken care of. I witnessed several tourists giving one of the team members a very hard time and she did not continued to work with a smile on her face."}
{"text":"Over charged for my meal. Staff were rude and not helpful. Over priced. Treated tourists badly. Talked between each other and not to guests"}
{"text":"I used to like this place when it first opened up. Although I rarely come here anymore since I no longer work at the mall, it just isn't as good of a value as I recall. They used to fill your box up to the brim with food until it would barely close. Now their portions are so skimpy, it makes Panda Express look generous. You can hardly even fill up on a 2-item plate nowadays. 

Seems like the price has gone up too...it's now almost 9 bucks for that same 2-item plate. So unless you're dying of starvation at the mall, I'd say skip this place, and the food court altogether and go somewhere else instead."}
{"text":"OMG Why?!  Why did I do this to myself?  I was hungry and desperate..

Do yourself a favour and wait till you get out of here and back to whatever hotel you came from, or anything from the other stands on your right.

It's not the worst thing I've ever put into my mouth.. but err.. good luck finding my review about that."}
{"text":"So push and hard sale. Never ask u what u need and suppose u order the combo. It's sooooo pricy than other Chinese food in food court. Hope can give them 0 star."}
{"text":"What can I say about the sketchy mall food? Definitely overpriced for the quality of food. My steamed veggies were somehow slimy? 

Fried rice was okay with the bbq chicken. Wish there were more food options at the mall with shorter lines."}
{"text":"They wouldnt refill my cup of water! What place doesnt allow its customers to drink tap water? Such rude service"}
{"text":"It's the most stereotypical map food you can get.  You are rushed along like an assembly line worker.  I come here all the time because I work in the mall and there's only 4 choices but this place is one of the worst.  And lately is gotten even worse with the portion sizes.  They used to at least pile it on.  Now they do one small scoop of each item and rush you along to the end.  The one star is because I haven't gotten sick from this place....yet."}
{"text":"More like Kung Pao Suk....okay complaint number 1. They dint have Kung Pao chicken or beef. Its called Kung Pao for effin sakes!!! 2. No beef dishes at all. They did have Kung Pao shrimp....tasteless!! 3. Beijing chicken is more like Beijing bricks....so damn hard likes bricks. 
This place was the only fast food joint serving Asian food.... This place was very very disappointing. Now i know why they got 1.5 stars. They should have gotten negative -1 star. The workers were nice but a little robotic. It is what it is. Do yourself a favor and try the other food places, Subway, Villa Italian kitchen- good spaghetti and meatballs and pizza. Skip this Dung Poo Wack !!"}
{"text":"Service crews are rude especially the one i first approached, she is hispanic , i asked about prices, and she got a BAD BAD UNBELIEVABLE ATTITUDE, she talked fast, i didnt understand her response so i asked again, and she gave me a bad attitude and so i told her that she have an attitude and what she did , She passed me on to the other crew, and when was talking to the other crew, she talked back and i replied back then she laughed, REALLY!!!! SHE HAVE THE GUTS TO LAUGH in front of complaining customer, I work for rental car and laughing is like an INSULT, then i was asking for the name of crew and they refused to give me her name while she stayed inside the kitchen. How am i gonna know the name im complaining, they are trying to protect her, i feel bad for this company for hiring the kind of crews they have, NO PERSONALITIES!!!!! 
I will not stop and will bring to BUSINESS BUREAU.

AND NOT COMING BACK AGAIN, EVER, POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!"}
{"text":"It's a budget eat and the foods are relatively fresh. They aren't over steamed at the warmer so the foods tasted delicious."}
{"text":"Food is nasty! I was hungry and it looked good, but it's definitely not. I got half steamed rice (which was really dry) and some  pepper chicken that tasted like orange chicken. Also, its so ocer priced!"}
{"text":"We were here on May 6th at 7pm and there were two ladies working. We purchased overpriced food and asked if we can get a cup of water but the lady didn't seem too happy about that. Next, when we asked if we can get a refill for water she so disrespectfully said \"I already gave you water\" she did not refill my water. This is the worse customer service ever! I was a first time customer here and I won't be going back.  I wish I would have gotten a name but the receipt did not have a name and the lady did not have a name tag. My order number was JWC58YHPM5TPW."}
{"text":"Rude service we just asked for water and they wont even give it to us. We had to go to the Subway next store to ask for a glass of water.  Definitely not coming back another time."}
{"text":"To put it simply:

- Service: the ladies are pushing you to spend more money or buy a beverage. They will not provide a water cup but will push to pay for water.

- Food: I had Lo Mein, Chicken Mushrooms, Eggplant Tofu.. It all tasted doused in oil! No joke, check out the picture of the end result! No flavor, no quality, not worth the high price!

- Price: Already an unjustified price point for the menu options. Then the rotten, unfriendly service and tasteless food confirms why they beg you to add an extra item or buy their bottle water.

Don't be fooled by the long line! There is nothing great about this place. They should be out of business soon if all they care about is making more money!"}
{"text":"Stopped here while shopping because we were starving. It was the only place with not much of a line and that should have been a clue. We went there and ordered. First we had to get their attention from talking to each other or on their cell phones while standing there staring at us. Then they forgot to give us some of what we ordered and were not polite when they asked why I was still standing there. The food was actually not bad, just too much of a hassle to get it."}
{"text":"They have the most perfect milk tea and boba is chewy to perfection! The eggs and tomatoes are so good! But if you are a girl they won't put as much on your plate... From my experience comparing to my husbands plate."}
{"text":"Worst manager ever, she rolled her eyes to the customer if you pause for a minute to figure out what to order. Worst customer service. Worst food. Please don't go to this place. The manager have a big time attitude and it seem to be the norm in this food court. Just plain rude. This place deserve 0 stars."}
{"text":"I was craving noodles and this was the closest fast food joint that carried anything close to noodles. Plus I needed to carb load for an upcoming race.

Admittingly, the portion is generous. I ordered a 2-item combo with chow mein, sesame chicken (orange chicken) and tofu as well as a drink. Total $11. Fast food and one of the only places of choice in the outlet center. 

Soft drink refills are .49 cents. 

I think next time I'll get the pizza for a little more filling."}
{"text":"Not much of a big option .. and when you ask to sample they say no !! So why buy food I can't even try first to see if I like it .. and I'm sure the one who told me no was the manager... I wouldn't recommend this place !!"}
{"text":"Absolutly !!! THE WORST Chiness food i have ever tasted !! I  wouldnt eat this even if i starved for a week i hate to be negative but there food just puts me in a foul mood!! God damn nasty!!  I am sorry but its just bad!!"}
