{"text":"just got home from a great meal.  our server was very good and our tea and water glasses were never empty..  the lasagna was a true roman style, hard boiled egg and all.   it was only half full, but in the summer that is saying a lot.  can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Great food and nice atmosphere, Quality Italian dining!"}
{"text":"Dining at Marco's is the ultimate for a neighborhood Italian restaurant.  It is a small venue tucked out of the way from the noise of the city.  It is somewhere locals go because it is excellent food, prepared with excellent ingredients, cooked by the chef/owner, and presented with homespun pride.

Marco, the owner and chef, oversees each plate, and then follows up his creations with a personal visit sometime during your visit.  He is always genuinely interested in whether you enjoyed your meal and your suggestions for future visits.  If there is something special you would like, he would like to provide it.  And yes, if you have an interest in Italy or are from the Home Country, he LOVES to talk with you about your experiences there.

You can tell this man is totally vested in his craft and his business.  Yes, sometimes they get busy and sometimes mistakes happen, but this restaurant is not a production line corporate model.  It is a very good neighborhood Italian restaurant owned and operated by an Italian guy who loves what he does.

Oh, and call ahead a day or two before you go and ask Marco to have some clam chowder made for you.  You won't believe it."}
{"text":"Not very good. Food totally average. Bad wine list. Really felt that food was tasteless. They were not busy, Stale bread. Vegetables were cold. Extras expensive."}
{"text":"Sat down at 6:30 on a Saturday night. We waited 10 minutes for someone to come by and take our drink and appetizer order. Drinks came out somewhat quickly, but it was 40 minutes before our app came out. During this 40 minutes we noticed that no one in the entire place had food on their table.

Just before we were ready to leave without eating our app came out so we decided end to stay. Our entree came out 20 minutes later served to us by two young teenagers looked to be the dishwashers. Our entrees were clearly microwaved -- very hot plates and extremely hot food.

We noticed as we were waiting for our check that other tables that were there before us were just getting their food.

They gave no apologies, didn't offer bread and one time offered a refill on our drinks.

It was a horrible experience."}
{"text":"SMall place tucked in the back of a shopping center.

The people that work there are WEIRD.  The food is GREAT!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a friends birthday it was my treat. We were both wowed. Service and food amazing. I tried the braciole. Among the best I have had, and I grew up in an Italian Neighborhood in NYC.  Thank you Marco for some authentic an delicious Italian cuisine in N. Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I stopped back in to Marco's Italian Bistro again recently.

We were welcomed & seated immediately & the waitress was right there taking our drink orders & describing the night's specials.

I was really looking forward to having another one of their incredible Veal Dishes, but after hearing the specials, I decided to try something different.

I ordered up the Linguini Frutti di Mare special which is Over 1 pound of Shrimp, Mussels, Clams, & Calamari prepared in a red or a white sauce.  You can choose your spice level:  0 - 4.   I chose Red Sauce & a 2 spice level.

We also ordered up the Alfredo pasta with Chicken.

The meal was incredible & the spice level was perfect for us.  Two of us shared this plate as there was so much food on it.  Everything was cooked to perfection.

The Waitress never let our drinks go dry which is very important to me & the service & food were just amazing.  

We really enjoy the ambiance of this Restaurant and look forward to going back again soon to try more of their great menu."}
{"text":"This family owned restaurant is awesome. They serve the olive oil for the bread sizzling, the salads are fresh and great. The pasta is out of this world. So are the meat dishes. If you like veal, theirs is the best!

Note: Be careful when you get a spicy dish!!! The scale goes from 0-4, and I got a 2.5 for my seafood pasta. It was HOT and i eat hot stuff all the time. Best Pink sauce, and they will customize any dish for you. Seafood is very good.

Best Italian I have had in the Northeast Valley, maybe even all of the valley.

Also, please dont come here expecting fast food! The owner is in the kitchen preparing each and every dish himself. Amazing!"}
{"text":"At the suggestion of some friends, my husband and I went to Marco's Restaurant this past weekend.  We very rarely go to an Italian restaurant because being of Italian heritage and coming from New York we are only used to the absolute best in Italian cooking.  I ordered the eggplant parmigiana and my husband ordered the meat lovers pizza.  All I can say is that my taste buds finally came alive again after being away from NY for over 20 years.  The food was absolutely delicious and fresh and the size of the portions were large in comparison to other restaurants.  I highly recommend this restaurant and will be going back very soon.  A gem for sure!"}
{"text":"I LOVE their fried garlic and bread/pita basket. Their daily specials are also fantastic for people with smaller budget. Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Came in after some highly touted recommendations. 
Stood at the front for approx. 4-5 mins before anyone acknowledged us (other than the pianist who was  a little too loud).

We were seated then another 10 mins passed at which point I waved down a waiter so we didn't need to continue our wait. 

We promptly ordered, 2 salads, 3 entrees.
Salads came out in about 10-15 mins.

I started with a spinach salad (w/pecans, cranberries& feta). It was very good, even though they were out of the requested raspberry  vinaigrette  dressing...balsamic vinaigrette was used instead. Wife said Caesar salad was also good.

After finishing salads, it was 10-15 mins before salad plates were cleared. Then another 15-20 before
entrees were served.  Still no one stopped by table to check on anything.

Interestingly, the tray holder was put down by our table 15 mins before the food came out.

The entrees of Chicken Parmesan, Balsamic Chicken & Shrimp scampi were (finally) delivered.  My dish ( the Chx Parmesan ) was fair ( 5 on a 1-10 scale) and the pasta served on the same plate was watery and mixed w/ the chicken.

Other diners with me rated the Balsamic Chicken as a 7 and the Shrimp Scampi as a 6.

Meal was fair, service poor."}
{"text":"We so wanted to like Marco's to support a small local restaurant; however, when we learned that we had to pay $2 for a basket of rolls at an Italian restaurant, we knew we were in trouble. We thought you only had to pay for bread in Europe?  

From there, it was downhill.  They only offered Peroni beer, with our server explaining that since it was an Italian restaurant, they only had Italian beer.  But this didn't hold true for the vino by the glass, which was predominantly from CA... only the Prosecco came from Italy?

I was excited to order a Rapini (broccoli rabe) dish because we hadn't seen it in any other Italian restaurants.  What a disappointment to have it arrive mushy and overcooked, lacking garlic flavor (even after spoonfuls of parmesan cheese, salt & pepper, it still lacked flavor), on rigatoni that was also overcooked and falling apart... a big no-no when the expectation is al dente pasta.  

My husband's chicken parm dish wasn't any better... his side of spaghetti with bolognese sauce featured overcooked pasta and a sauce that was a creamy orange and unlike any bolognese sauce we've ever seen.  We looked up the ingredients online to confirm what we thought bolognese was... simple tomato sauce with spices, saut√©ed onions, and meat.  Marco's sauce looked and tasted more like a vodka sauce with cheese and/or cream.  

I hesitated to leave this review, but when I saw that the owner has responded to any less than glowing review with a defensive, unprofessional yell-o-gram, I decided to add my voice to the other diners who hope that our constructive feedback might finally have an impact and inspire this restaurant to improve so we can give it a second try."}
{"text":"They open at 5, I arrived before 5:30. It was empty except for a family of 3 already seated. After a few minutes, I was greeted by a woman who seemed distracted, and didn't offer to seat me. I had to ask her to seat me. She spent a few minutes looking across the empty dining room, then at a piece of, and was very flustered. I asked again to be seated, and she said that she didn't know if they had any tables. I pointed at the empty dining room and asked whether there was a problem. She said that they were all reserved, and she didn't have a place for me. She gave in and gave me a table just inside the door, in the middle of the foot traffic as the disorganized staff ran to and fro. Scottsdale restaurants commonly refuse to seat women dining alone, so they can hold out for large parties that spend more on food and alcohol.  That seems to be the case here, because it was still empty when I left over an hour later. 

Once I was seated, a young lady came from the kitchen, carrying a skillet in one hand and a bread basket in the other. This was very precarious, and I watched her trying to hold the heavy skillet with one hand as she came toward me. She placed the basket on my table, and poured from the skillet into a small bowl on the table. I realized that she was pouring smoking hot olive oil with burned chunks of garlic. The oil was was bubbling, even after she poured it into the bowl. I was horrified that she had carried burning oil through a restaurant, and could have burned herself, employees or customers, or me. The smell of burned garlic in burned olive oil was awful. I opened the breadbasket and found a single roll (recently thawed), and several scraps of pizza dough that had been brushed with olive oil and partially baked, but mostly raw and with no seasoning). I later saw the same young lady pass me with cauldrons of boiling oil for the party seated ahead of me and a party that arrived after me. I think this is their attempt at an interesting tableside presentation, but it is unappetizing and dangerous.

I waited perhaps 10 minutes and nobody came to even take my drink order. There was some confusion over a to go order, and the staff gathered at the back dining room to discuss how to sort out the mess. While I waited ... and waited, I overheard the first party try to order, only to be told that they were out of one dish after another. A half hour into dinner service, an empty dining room, and they're out of half the items on the menu?

I was in a pasta mood, and checked the menu, hoping it was homemade. No. It's \"IMPORTED FROM ITALY!\" I can get grocery store pasta \"IMPORTED FROM ITALY!\" if you advertise \"high quality authentic Italian food,\" make your own pasta. 

I ordered Spaghettini Bolognese. While I waited 20 minutes for my meal to arrive, I watched the staff bustle back and forth at full speed, but not do anything. I overheard them tell a party that arrived after me that \"we're out of that.\" Over and over ... They then tried to order pasta, and were told they were OUT OF PASTA because the pasta machine was broken. They don't even make their own pasta, they accepted a pasta order from me, but told these customers they can't serve pasta because the non-existent machine is broken. 

When my order came, I did not receive spaghettini. I received spaghetti. Maybe they don't know the difference, and added the \"ni\" at the end to impress people? The Bolognese, advertised as a \"special meat sauce,\" was not meat sauce. It was a pale tomato cream sauce, very similar to Campbell's tomato soup, and it had five bite-size pieces of tough, grisly beef that had apparently been cut from a piece of meat and dropped into the flavorless sauce. I tried to eat a couple pieces of this meat, which was like beef jerky, and gave up. I ate the grocery store spaghetti covered in tomato soup, and waited 20 minutes for someone to notice that I had finished, clear my place, and offer me dessert. Yes, I was going to try dessert and give them a chance to do something well. Eventually, a server stopped by and asked whether I wanted to \"box that up.\" Box what up? There were only a couple bits of beef gristle left. I declined the box, so he dropped the check on the table and disappeared for another 20 minutes. No dessert menu. Just uninterested staff hiding in the back to avoid customers.

I love family-owned restaurants. There aren't enough of them here, and I support the good ones. I'm patient with the little mistakes that can occur, and I really do want places like this to succeed. I don't enjoy writing a negative review, but if these folks don't wake up and start paying attention, they will not survive. 

My advice: (1) Learn how to cook. (2) Practice basic kitchen safety. No more acrobatics with hot oil. (3) Go to other restaurants and observe bad service and good service.  It's easy to tell the difference.  La Fontanella on Indian School could teach you about gracious and courteous service.  Do what they do."}
{"text":"I don't have any experience with this restaurant, but my parents tell me it's one of their favorite places. I tried calling in an order for them after a long day and  pre-paying for it. Apparently this can't be done but instead of explaining this to me kindly, he told me to order my food somewhere else and hung up. They may have amazing food, but their owner is a rude man."}
{"text":"I have been here a bunch of times now, as I live nearby. I have read many complaints about the service here, but have never had any issues with service whatsoever. Everyone is very friendly and accommodating, and I have consistently been pleased with the service I have received.  I think their sauce is tasty, and their chicken is tender and juicy. I have also had their Eggplant Parmesan and REALLY enjoyed it!  The slices were cut thick, sauce and cheese was generous.  (WAY better than Nick's down the street that slice their eggplant paper thin and use a ton of breading).

If I would suggest just a couple things. The bread is supposedly homemade, im not a fan. I would prefer a crusty piece of real italian bread. These are more like soft rolls. Also, the meatballs are very mushy and soft.  Possibly too many breadcrumbs?  I don't know, but I couldn't eat it."}
{"text":"I'm giving this restaurant a five star rating due to the owner, Marco, personally answering the phone when I called for info and directions; 2 minutes ago!! 
Seriously, if ya'll know anything about running your own li'l restaurant, that opens at 4:30 pm, you know that 1:30 pm is crazy prep time!
I was SO impressed that the owner was so personable, while obviously multi-tasking! 
I like to seek out and spend my $$ at truly locally owned businesses...always looking for delish nom-noms, as well.
I think I'll call back and make a reservation,  take pics of what I anticipate to be a totally fun and fulfilling nosh-fest!
And then...I'll update my review."}
{"text":"Only 1 beer (Peroni) and it was definitely not to my liking.  And I like beer with my dinner so probably will not go back just for that.

Kids meals, though not real large, are adequate and only $4 and the kids liked it.  Tiramisu was a miss at the restaurant though when I ate it later that night at home I appreciated the freshness of this homemade treat (just a bit different tasting that the Americanized version).

Ambiance was good and service was excellent (though there was only 1 other table at 5:30 p.m.).  I think there would be more business if it was not so hidden."}
{"text":"Best calamari in the valley! We have eaten here about 6 times...Never had a bad meal! Marinara sauce is awesome! Service is a bit quirky... But we've never waited long for anything."}
{"text":"The food is good but the owner is soooo rude it totally discounts it. There are better places to get Italian food in the area without having to deal with an owner who doesn't treat people well."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I really love your restaurant that we just found. Your attention to detail, the flavors and textures you bring out are fantastic , not to mention that you have gluten free dishes as well as you cook Organically. Your a personal tour of your kitchen as we we're leaving at closing time was great! I was very impressed with the cleanliness after a long day.

In regards to your response to Michael B, that further shows me how on top of everything you are in satisfing your customers. You're on it! Keep up the great work..."}
{"text":"Just went to happy hour at Marco's Bistro.  Food was very good to excellent but the service was average to poor.  Very little attention in checking back to see if more appetizers were to be ordered, had to flag down staff to order.  Last appetizer ordered never came and had to flag down a staff person again to request the order and was told our order had been put behind a large family order so never was filled.  When we canceled the tardy appetizer the original waitress came up to say we couldn't expect our small order to be put in front of a large family order and we had to stop her excuses to get our bill so we could leave.  We will come back because food was very good but hope that we don't encounter the same level of incompetence in the wait and kitchen staff."}
{"text":"Very disappointed, as you can gat better tasting Italian food nearby. Pasta was way over cooked, tomato sauce was so acidic. Service was decent.
I thought it was strange that on a Friday night at 630 the place was empty, but some people like this place, not me. Buyers beware!"}
{"text":"The bolognese sauce was very flavorful.  I am an Italian connoisseur and would eat here whenever I am in the area."}
{"text":"7:00 reservations right on time. Our meals were all fantastic. (X4) Yes you do buy bread for a very minimum cost and the dipping sauce was wonderful. Hubby needs butter and a large slab was brought to the table no problem. Waiter was very attentive and knowledgeable. Portions were large enough to make all of us too full for cannoli desserts, darn it. It was fairly quiet as it was only one dining room, small and more intimate than larger restaurants. White tablecloths on tables. We didn't feel like it needed an update at all. Very clean looking. The large tv on the wall in front of only our booth was distracting and a little annoying (my only complaint). I'm sure they would've turned it off if we had asked as nothing important was on. They really don't need it as it is not a sports bar. We will definitely go back and also recommend to anyone who wants to know. Keep up the good work Marco, we hope you make it. We much prefer your type of restaurant over the big chains that don't really care if you come back or not."}
{"text":"The good news is the food is not bad - not amazing but not bad. The bad news is the owner is a JERK!!! I am in town visiting friends and we stopped to pick up a take-out order. My friend told me he and his wife had gone there 10 years ago and the owner was a jerk and they had heard the same thing from all of their friends. We arrived before 5:30 pm (and have proof from iPhone callls). The waitress told us it was still happy hour and wine and beer were 50% off so we each ordered a glass. The bill came and the wines were full price (and lousy wine btw - the waitress said the best was a Cupcake wine!!). We told the waiter who went inside to check. The owner came out and said we arrived after 5:30, pointing to the door saying \"it clearly says happy hour is 4:30-5:30.\"  He didn't  care what the waitress told us but that it would be a big imposition to change the bill.  

NEVER GO TO THIS RESTAURANT!!!  MARCO SHOULD NOT BE IN BUSINESS!!!"}
{"text":"We have lived in Fountain Hills for 27 years.  My husband refuses to go out for Italian food.
We were introduced to Marco's Bistro by our good friends who also live in Fountain Hills--we trusted them because they are from Chicago and know good Italian food.

We keep going back--we love the food at Marco's.  The portions are huge.  I always order the 3 cheese raviolis and the bolognese sauce with one of Marco's HUGE meat balls--you can taste the veal!

The dinner is so rich and wonderful--I always take enough home for two more meals.

My husband orders each time the chicken parmegian--and, takes home enough for 2 meals.

Happy hour is great.  Warning--you really need to not assume you can just walk in and get a table--the place is that popular.  Always call for a reservation.

Maria H."}
{"text":"I cannot believe I almost forgot to review this place! Thank you yelp for your lovely check-in reminders;-)

I had an interesting experience here. I ordered take-out and loaded up 2 young kids to go pick it up. I ordered raviolis for the little ones and a salad for myself. Once I got home I noticed that my salad dressing was not in the bag. Really??? Grrr was all I had to say. I was not about to load up the hungry kids and drive back out for salad dressing. So I fed them and used the lovely kraft italian dressing I had in the fridge. Yum, I know. But I thought I'd give the restaurant a call and let them know of the mistake. I informed the woman who answered the phone. She said I could come back and get it and I refused. Well, not 30 seconds later Marco himself called me and offered to drive the salad dressing to me himself, personally. I know! I told him everyone makes mistakes and I understand. Of course I didn't make him drive it out to me. But what that phone call did was make me a repeat customer for life. All business owners should learn this lesson and make every customer happy! It will pay in the long run."}
{"text":"We enjoyed a meal with friends here earlier this evening. Here's what we tried:
- Gnocchi al Dominic with chicken (the garlic Alfredo pesto sauce is heavenly and this gnocchi is some of the best I've ever had)
- Alfredo spaghetti with chicken
- Chicken Scallopini a la Marco (this has prosciutto and an artichoke mushroom sauce)
- Chicken Bals√°mico 
If you're ever in the Scottsdale or Fountain Hills area, I highly recommend this little gem that serves high quality Italian food."}
{"text":"Located \"off the beaten path\" at the end of a small shopping strip mall, this place isn't something that just jumps out and grabs you.  But it is definitely worth finding your way here!   If you want an authentic, Italian dinner made with the freshest of ingredients you should definitely come here. And to make it even better you can eat healthy if you want.  Organic, gluten free, and Marco will make modifications to meet your wishes.  Yum 

My only hesitancy in writing this review is I don't want my favorite Italian restaurant to get so darn busy that I won't be able to get in."}
{"text":"I like this place. The food is a unique take on Italian food by Marco himself. Is it your typical Italian restaurant...absolutely not as Marco adds his personal flair to each and every dish, or at least to all of the ones we have tried. Everything we have eaten is homemade as far as we can tell, very flavorful, and reasonably priced. Most importantly is that the flavors are great and the food quality is high. We have gone back several times and always enjoy the food. The wait staff is also very friendly and we have always been treated well. My only recommendation would be that that they do an update to the decor as the atmosphere is very blah. I also despise menus that have pictures, as that always comes across as cheap and of lower quality, which is not the case with their food, but they deliver a different impression with their lower grade decor and cheap Chinese fast food style of menu. I love the food, the service, and even the value for what you get....just update the decor and print out a more quality menu that screams of a higher quality of food that you actually do serve. We will be back for sure as the menu and decor does not turn me away from good food!"}
{"text":"This was our second visit. My daughter wanted to come here for her birthday, as she likes their fettuccine Alfredo better than any other she's had so far. They were closed on her birthday (a Monday) so we tried to come the weekend before but they were closed for vacation. When I called to make the reservation for tonight, I asked if they did anything special for birthdays and was told probably cake and to let my server know. There wasn't an opportunity, so I let the hostess know we were celebrating my two older kids' birthdays and asked if they did anything for them. She said she'd let our server know. 

Jesse, our server, was less than enthusiastic right from the get go. In fact, the restaurant seemed like the last place he wanted to be. At the end of the meal he gave us the check and asked if we wanted dessert. We mentioned it was the kids' birthdays and he wished them an obligatory happy birthday and mumbled something about putting a candle in dessert but by then we had decided on ice cream elsewhere. 

A bit disappointed this time, as we drove out of our way to come here from Peoria. Alfredo sauce is great. Chicken piccata lacked a good sauce. Kids chicken parm doesn't come with pasta? We were charged another kids meal for the pasta on the side, which we weren't told about."}
{"text":"First time at Marco's.  The place is pleasant looking despite some Yelper's saying it needed a makeover.  It is trying for an old world look with paintings, maps of italy, etc.  They have these super comfy-looking booths which seat about 4.  Since we were only two, we sat at a table. Tables have linens on them giving the place a nice look; clean looking too.

We arrived in time for happy hour which is half-off appetizers and drinks.  We had \"bread\" as an appetizer--yes, you have to buy bread.  It is homemade and totally worth it.  They served it with a ramekin of good olive oil which was infused with garlic.  Dunking the bread in that olive oil was delightful.  We had a cabernet which was a little small, but I figured the happy hour portion was smaller.  We paid $4.50 for the wine, but I can't imagine that this portion would be $9.00 if it were not happy hour. 

I ordered chicken piccata and I chose spaghetti with tomato sauce as a side.  My dining companion ordered chicken marsala with saut√©ed spinach when the chef indicated he couldn't make a chicken/eggplant combo without cheese.  Don't know why this was so difficult as we are able to get this dish at other italian restaurants. 

We found the portions to be on the large side (as opposed to some Yelpers saying that the portions were small).  For $14.95 each entree, it was quite a nice portion.  Both chicken dishes were perfectly cooked.  I, who am not a marsala sauce fan, tasted the marsala and actually liked it better than my piccata sauce.  I like piccata super lemony and my sauce even had lemons on it, but I still would have preferred it with more lemon. Both dishes had a gravy boat with extra sauce.  Despite this, I enjoyed my dish.  My side pasta tasted freshly made with chopped tomatoes and garlic.  I really liked it.   

The wait service was good.  Our waters were topped and they did come by to ask how our food was.  

The place was filled by the time we were ready to leave so clearly this place is becoming popular.  I am definitely a return customer."}
{"text":"Marco has his heart in his book sines.  Food and service are e cel lent.  Have been going there for 10 years.  

Recent remodel is a big improvement however, the drop lights over tables are very bright and do not create an intimate atmosphere less..  I was hoping for can style lights rather than mini fixtures.  Please tone down lighting with dimmer switches over the tables.  Otherwise, excellent."}
{"text":"My family & I have been eating @ Marco's Italian Bistro since their conception.  We have never had a bad meal there & we love the  friendly neighborhood feel & fantastic service we get everytime we go there.  My picky 8 year old daughter loves it & even drew them a picture which they still have hanging up for all to see, which excites her everytime we go there. The only problem I have when I go there is that I have such a hard time deciding which dish to get since I have so many favorites.  It would be a shame for you to miss out on their fabulous food!"}
{"text":"Very very good Italian food!  Fresh ingredients and everything is made to order.  Huge portions that make the price worth it.  It could be a little brighter inside and could use a little makeover but u don't eat the decor...."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible experience. We sat down on a Saturday night after calling ahead to make sure there was a table for four available. The restaurant was busy, but not full. Our bottle of wine took about 7 minutes to arrive to our table. After we ordered, we waited waited and waited. 50 minutes after we ordered our food, we asked the waiter to bring our check, as we were running short on time. Our server informed us that the chef hadn't even started our food yet. He then handed us our tab for our bottle of wine and our table bread. They couldn't even comp the bread and wine? We waited for nearly one hour! As we were leaving, there were about 5 other table available in an otherwise small restaurant. There was no reason it should have taken so long. Extremely disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is the real deal!  Best Italian food around!  Owner and staff are very nice people.  Firepit on back patio is a must in the winter.  My new favorite spot!"}
{"text":"2nd try at Marcos.  All I can say is I was blown Away.  I had the white egg plant parmigiana.    Pound for pound one of the best things I've ever eaten,  just unbelievable.   Everything we had was spot on. We had calamari and a margarita pizza as appetizers,  the cheese and basil are incredibly fresh.  We also had the chicken parmigiana and gnocchi. All were very good.  Wish I left room for desert !   The last time I was here I was concerned about the portion size.   No concerns this time.  We could not finish our dishes.   I sadly left my doggie bag back at Marcos  lol.  My recommendation is go here and eat often.  And btw the waiter Jessy was awesome and let me know you can also get the chicken parmigiana in the white version.  I'm going next week and will try it. Great job Marco's."}
{"text":"I'm almost afraid to write this review in fear that too many people will go to this amazing restaurant. However, I am going to take one for the foodie team. This place is tucked away in a strip mall and if you don't look hard enough you'll miss it. My first trip to Marco's we were greeted and sat right away. We ordered the sizzling olive oil... it was served from a skillet table-side. GOOD GOLLY MISS MOLLY! AMAZING! Frutti de mar was next. The portion size was HUGE and the seafood was unbeatably fresh. You cannot go wrong when you have the owner in the kitchen. Other than the location, I can think of nothing but great things about this restaurant. My wife and I recently went to Italy for vacation and it turns out you don't need to travel across the world for authentic cuisine. Do your belly a favor and go to Marco. He will treat you right. Also, the prices are extremely fair so you can have a nice dinner and not break the bank."}
{"text":"Ive been here twice.   While the 1st time was a terrible experience I went back again seeing if the service and food had changed.  And It had.   I was happy.   The bread basket was delicious.  We ordered two of them.  haha.  And they bring out olive oil and garlic hot from a pan.  I thought it was a nice touch.   Definetely tasty.   I ordered the prosciutto and mushroom pasta with vodka sauce.  It was great.   Service has definetely gotten better as well.   They seem to have hired better help.   I hope this business does well and I will be back."}
{"text":"Had the pleasure of dining in your restaurant last Saturday.  Friends gave you rave reviews.  Enjoyed a leisurely cocktail, along with your glorious bread, served with heated herbal oil.  Both my friend and I order the Shrimp Scampi.  I have literally traveled the World and this meal was among the finest I have ever had.  The shrimp was perfection, along with the light sauce.  Our waitress was Candice and she was absolutely a joy.  Informative, attentive, and professional.  Also, knowledgeable about the entire menu.  The ambiance was inviting and charming.  Interestingly enough, tomorrow another friend is ordering food from you as three of us are getting together for dinner at her home.  My friend and I were not celebrating any special occasion but this meal felt like we were.  I will, of course, return."}
{"text":"Arnie L
Consistently good authentic and healthy Italian cuisine. Marco is a top notch chef and friendly to his customers."}
{"text":"My go to Italian restaurant in the valley. It's a smaller place so sometimes it takes a little longer to be served on a busy night, but it's completely worth it. You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu."}
{"text":"I really want this place to do well. Every restaurant or business that has occupied its location over the past several years has gone out of business within a year or so of opening. Marcos seems to be hanging on a bit longer then most.  It is kind of like that Senfeld episode where he tried to help the Pakistani restaurant owner. The owners have also pulled up their roots from back east (Jersey I think) and put everything into this restaurant. That is another reason I want them to succeed. The fact that Marcos has been open for a couple of years is a good sign. All that said no matter how much I want the place to succeed I only think the food is so so and the service is spotty. I have been there three times. One time the waiter was a high school kid who knew nothing about the wine the other times the wait staff seemed a bit scattered. The the meals we have had were OK but not great. The portions were not impressive for the price paid. They have some early bird specials that make going worthwhile however. I plan to go back for the specials and hopefully the service and the food will improve to the point where I think it is worthwhile going back during prime time."}
{"text":"Great service and fantastic food! The meals are always wonderful. The staff is extremely friendly. I'm from New York and I'm very picky about my Italian food, this is one of the best!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite Italian restaurant in the area! We've been to all the others, Vito's, Nicks, and this is hands down the best!! Chef Marco and his staff are not only friendly but very efficient! 

Now to go onto the food! The portions are extremely generous! If you have ever been to Italy, you know that meat is never served with pasta noodles on the same dish. It's almost sacreligious! Chef Marco knows what he is doing. Ever feel like you never get enough sauce... Not here... Each dish is served with the sauce and an extra carafe of sauce on the side! He makes his own fettuccine noodles as well!! 

We've tried just about everything and have never been disappointed! Def try the chicken balsamic for something out of this world for mushroom lovers! 

A lot of thought and love goes into all the dishes!! Just like it should be!"}
{"text":"Our event was a spectacular success. We raised nearly $30,000 for our Miracle League kids. It was a wonderful tribute to our son.

Your Ziti was multo delicioso. Salads stayed crisp and fresh. There was more than enough for all guests and leftovers were shared with our volunteers. 

Your kitchen staff was ready for us, on time and food was packaged perfectly for transport. All ancillary items (plates, serving utensils, napkins etc.) were included and very much appreciated.

Many thanks to you and your team for helping us, help others. We are grateful for your generosity. And finally your pricing made it feasible for us to serve over 140 guests with a high quality, high value dinner.

Gratefully,

John Little and the Miracle League of Arizona."}
{"text":"This was a place we found through yelp that is within walking distance from my house, so another plus! I never would have seen this place from the street, since it's tucked in the corner of the strip mall across the street from fresh n easy. 

The service was exceptional and the food was delicious. Everything is organic, and it tasted really light and healthy, not too much oil used in the cooking. They were having a pre-valentine's day special where if you get a bottle of wine, you get a free appetizer, we got the fried calamari. We got the bottle suggested for my dish, which was the special of the day, linguine frutti di mare. It was sooo good, the pasta tasted freshly made, and the seafood was great (clams, mussels, calamari, and four or five really large jumbo shrimp) in a white sauce. My bf got the chicken parmigiana with a side of linguine and tomato sauce and he really like his dish too. I had a bite of his chicken, which was really moist and nicely done. 

I highly recommend this place for quality italian food that is reasonably priced. It's a small place, so it's kind of nice to sit next to your sweetie in a booth and share good food, wine and laughs. They were also showing the godfather on tv, so that was kinda fun too =)"}
{"text":"I hate to give bad reviews but truth be told, my experience last night was not good.  I'm from Jersey, grew up in an Italian neighborhood and I'm used to good Italian food.  My wife and I came for dinner last night.  I wanted spaghetti and meatballs and she wanted something Gluten Free.  I ordered the spaghetti with one meatball and one sausage with Bolognese sauce.  My wife ordered the Marcos Holistic salad with grilled chicken.  First bad sign, our food came out in like 5 minutes.  Probably an exaggeration but pretty darn close.  My spaghetti was hot but my wife's grilled chicken was cold.  My meatball was overly salty and made with too much breadcrumbs.  It also was not soft and not cooked in sauce.  My sausage was not cooked fresh, but reheated on the stove or microwave.  It was a bit hard and dry.  I know it may take 20 minutes on the grill to cook fresh, but if you are paying $3.50 for one meatball and $3.50 for one sausage, it better be good.  On a good note, the bolognese sauce was very good.  My wife's salad was packed in a small bowl with the cold chicken on top.  Again, not fresh but something probably made earlier in the day.  That side was $5.00.  You would think for a $13 salad, the chicken should be fresh and hot and the presentation a bit better.  The only thing I will give Marco a pass on was it was late in the night.  We came in around 8:00 pm, probably after the dinner rush.  This seems to happen to good restaurants.  They get good reviews and then rest on their laurels.  Quality takes a back seat.  Food starts getting reheated.  Our meal, with a glass of house wine was over $50.00.  All we had was spaghetti and a salad.  For that price, the food better be epic."}
{"text":"Perhaps my expectations were too great, I'm sad to say that Marco's didn't make the cut!  My wife and I went last night to celebrate our 36th wedding anniversary.  They had our reservation under my first name for some reason.  Our waiter Wayne, was at the door, welcomed us and acknowledged our anniversary.  The restaurant is small but warm and nicely decorated, and service was good and efficient.  It was Thursday night and they had live entertainment that began at 6pm, a pianist.  It was difficult to have a conversation with the volume of the music.  As an entertainer, he was gifted!  We ordered the fried calamari appetizer with their bread basket with hot garlic olive oil.  Four small warm rolls, had a very doughy consistency and not what you might expect in an Italian restaurant, strike one.  The portion size of the calamari was smaller than we had ever received in other places but was breaded and cooked properly and tasted good.  Next we had one of the specials, Parmesan encrusted Salmon with eggplant and tomato.  The fish was very tasty, cooked perfectly and larger than expected with abundant veggies, a 4 star dish.  As a side we both ordered their house made fettuccini, al dente and better than the boxed pasta.  Hers with the Alfredo sauce, mine with the meat sauce.  Both sauces were delicious, 4 star quality.  Also ordered the veal saltimbocca.  The veal was more than excellent, tender, tasty and abundant but the sauce, veggies, prosciutto  and cheese were so salty it was difficult to enjoy and I am a salt lover, strike two.  We did not order desert.  We did not receive or were we offered anything for our anniversary other than Wayne saying \"Happy Anniversary\" once again! Never did see Marco or his wife.  I lived and worked for ten years in northern Italy, so I think I know the Italian kitchen.  Sorry Marco, I give you no more than 3 stars :("}
{"text":"Disclaimer: The owner, Marco, is sort of a friend of some friends whom I had never met in person before this visit. But I intend to give a very fair and honest review of my dining experience at this restaurant.

We arrived on the Wednesday evening before Thanksgiving a little after 6 PM. My wife called ahead to confirm they were open and the hostess warned us that they were busier than usual and that we may have to wait a bit to get a table. The restaurant is quite small and they appeared to be short-handed with staff that night as a couple of the staff members were sharing hosting, waiting, busing, and even bar duties. Having some first-hand experience in the food service business, I can appreciate the challenges that a small operation is faced with regarding staff. Even being one person short on a busy day can significantly impact your ability to provide good service. It took 20-25 minutes to get seated and the waits to have our orders taken, for the appetizers to arrive, and for our main courses to arrive were all longer than what we would normally expect when dining out. But, we were a party of six which included my wife's sister and husband who were visiting us from the Bay Area, so we weren't in any hurry and didn't much mind hanging out during the extended waits.

Now on to the food. We ordered several appetizers: bread rolls and garlic mozzarella flatbread, both of which were quite good; calamari (I didn't try, but sis-in-law enjoyed it); rapini (a bit on the bitter and spicy side for my taste, but the other adults at the table liked it). All of the entrees ordered were big hits. My wife absolutely loved her shrimp scampi; her sister ordered the clams and mussels and loved it; her husband was very satisfied with the chicken marsala; I ordered one of the evening specials, grilled swordfish in lemon butter sauce with homemade fettucini in olive oil and garlic on the side. I don't often encounter swordfish on the menu when I dine out, but it's my favorite fish and this one was simply delicious. Our 12-year old daughter chose her standard favorite dish, fettuccini alfredo with grilled chicken. She's not big eater, but she stuffed herself the best she could while I gladly cleaned up the remainder. She swore it was the best she'd ever eaten and was still talking about it on the drive back to our hotel and even the next day! Finally our 5-year old daughter ate what she could of the margherita pizza that was shared by several of the adults and had no complaints.

Marco stopped at our table a couple of times during our visit to make sure we were satisfied with our food and thank us for coming in that evening. It was readily apparent that he's passionate about his use of top quality ingredients and providing good value for the customer's dollar. Obviously, the overall dining experience wasn't perfect, but I felt like the service shortcomings were acceptable given the circumstances and the fact the staff remained courteous while busting their butts to do what had to be done. If Yelp would allow it, I'd give them 4.5 stars. So give Marco's a try next time you're in the mood for some tasty Italian food at a fair price."}
{"text":"The restaurant was busy and still the plate of food  came out hot and perfectly prepared. Everyone around us thoroughly enjoyed their entree. Marco came out after the rush and visited with each table. I will definitely return after my first experience at this nice clean neighborhood Italian Bistro!"}
{"text":"Our family loves Marcos.  Every dish is terrific and the staff is warm and welcoming and service is great.  Fresh ingredients and unique menu and great flavor.  My kids eat better here than any other place we go.  Thanks Marco!"}
{"text":"Marco is an amazing chef, everything is from scratch, and the white table clothes and small but quaint atmosphere is very nice. The seafood risotto was melting in my mouth! My mother and I love to go to Marco's!"}
{"text":"The food is fresh, high quality and always delicious. Upscale atmosphere. Great place for a date or a celebration"}
{"text":"I was introduced to Marco's a few years back and ever since then I have been hooked. The food is amazing and the staff is extremely attentive and nice. My recommendation, order either of the two pink sauce pasta dishes, yum! If you're looking for more than good food please keep reading...

If you ever get the opportunity to have a discussion with the owner Marco, please do.  On the first of three occasions (I've been there way more than that), a friend and I stopped in for dinner as we were extremely hungry after a long day. My friend ended up scarfing down his meal and when the owner, Marco, noticed how hungry he was, offered to make him more pasta at no charge. I mean, seriously, you don't find service like that in many places. On the second occasion, I was there with my boyfriend and we were having a nice lunch, Marco again stopped by to talk with us and saw that we were drinking the wine that his employees had suggested would go great with our meal, at no cost he had them refill our glasses. Lastly, I was there with my grandmother who was wheelchair bound. After our meal, Marco stopped by to ask us our opinion of the food. My grandmother and he had a great conversation about Italy and how the pink sauce originated (Marco also remembered me and a conversation we had from a visit the month prior). On our way out the door to my car, Marco decided to help me wheel my grandmother to the car, assist her inside the car, and then proceeded to pack up the wheelchair and put it in the trunk of my car. Wow, just wow!!! I mean, you can't find first class people like this just anywhere. That last act spoke volumes! I am and will be a fan of this establishment for life.

So if you are a looking for great food, good service, a nice environment, and admirable individuals, look no further. Marco's Italian Bistro is one of the best, if not the best Italian restaurant in town!"}
{"text":"The owner replied below. Here is my reply. I HAVE had eggplant parmesan at your restaurant before and it was fine, as can be expected, it fitted the common expectation and standard description of the dish. Whatever i had w that alfredo sauce was not that, it was haphazardly thrown together, barely eatable and by no standard of any italian cooking can it be called an eggplant parm ( a dish i usually LOVE), for one there was no parmesan cheese in it. The dish was just eggplant, not well cooked, not good, covered in sauce with random chunks of mozz & ricotta cheese. I'll change my stars from 1 to 3 because i feel bad letting my bad experience affect your business, my issue is more w the waiter who Claimed he saw breadcrumbs. But  to keep telling me that what i was served was not a mistake, that is some version of the dish, is ridiculous. 

I really want to like this place, it's cute, but when the attitude is so hoity you better come correct..and it just dont. Tonight's dinner was a travesty. I ordered an eggplant parmesan w Alfredo sauce instead of marinara. It came looking odd. I questioned it but was assured by waiter that it was normal. It wasn't, all this was, was a stack of dry thick eggplant with chunks of ricotta, mozz & alfredo thrown on too. It was not at all an eggplant paRm, i decided to make the best of it, cus they act at this restaurant like complaining or questioning is strictly forbidden. Before leaving I reported to the waiter, just as an Fyi, that mine was really not an eggplant parm, and he started arguing w me. I said \"i've had it many times, it's supposed to be thin sliced eggplant fried in breadcrumbs and parmesan etc\". he said : \"i saw breadcrumbs\" what?! Where?! I think i know what was in it, i ate it and am telling you what was on my plate in front of me for 20 min. I didnt send it back out of courtesy, hated that ineatable slop, paid for it, tipped well, and they can't even give me the courtesy of taking my notes at face value? I understand mistakes can be made, but when they look you in the face and deny the glaring obvious issues like you're lying or irrational, then i get lit. Additionally their homemade fettuccini breaks into small peaces right in the bowl, thats a no no for italian anywhere. Get it together."}
{"text":"Five stars don't come easy and this might be high, however, after the very bad experience at The Vu (read review), we happened upon this place by accident.  From the moment we were seated we knew we found something special.  Just a little place, looks like it seats about 50 people indoor with some outside seating.  The menu had several nice choices of Italian appetizers, the Rapini was a little overpriced for the portion but it was excellent, full of garlic flavor.  Our dinners were eggplant parm, chicken parm, shrimp alfredo and penne rigatoni.  All four meals were better than good.  The eggplant especially was one of the best I've ever had, so worth it.  As I said in the first line Five stars are hard to come by but since I'm still pissed at our experience at The VU, Marco's is getting the extra star for being there for us.  Thanks and you are on our go to list when visiting in the future.  Thank you for a wonderful dining experience."}
{"text":"Marco and Marco's are great! Jessie took our order and he was very nice and friendly. Everything was cooked perfectly. Marco came out as we were finishing dinner. He sat with us and was interested in our feedback. He is super friendly and loves what he does! We shared stories about Italy while we looked at the beautiful new Sorrento mural on the wall. Finished off the evening with an excellent limoncello! Love this place and will be back again and again!!!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here today and was disappointed. 

Walked in and it looked like a nice place, though empty at about 11:30. Nobody was around as I maneuvered my elderly aunt's wheelchair through the door. A young woman came out of the kitchen and told us we were to order and pay at the bar. She moved a chair away from a table so I could push the wheelchair right up, then she brought us menus and waters, and took our drink orders. Strangely, I was still required to go up to the bar to order and pay. 

I ordered an appetizer to share, pasta with Alfredo sauce and chicken, and pasta with tomato and basil sauce for my aunt. It was over $30. When our meals came out (we were served at the table...why couldn't she have just taken our order there?), I asked about our appetizer, which we hadn't received. She said it would be out in a bit; it was. 

My dish had a good flavor, but several bites were extraordinarily salty...and I'm a person who likes salt! But it was overpowering. The chicken was dry. My aunt didn't taste--nor did we see--any basil in her tomato and basil sauce. The \"appetizer,\" which came after our meal--caprese on homemade toasted bread--was pretty good. 

When the server asked how our food was, I told her about the good taste but over-saltiness of my dish; not much of a response. While we ate, only two other people came in to eat; one seemed to be a regular picking up food, and likely loved the place. 

When we left, the two men from the kitchen were sitting at the bar chatting with the woman who had served us. No one moved a muscle to help us maneuver her wheelchair out the door. 

Finally, I've never worked at a restaurant, so I don't know, but I could see them using long-handled spoons to take the lids off the big pots, set them down,  then stir what was inside, and then to put the lids back on...it looked very handy, like it was made for that purpose, but I couldn't help but think it looked a bit unsanitary. Is that SOP, though? 

At any rate, we won't be back. Glad they have plenty of satisfied regulars to keep them in business!"}
{"text":"Just finished another wonderful evening at Marcos.  congratulated him on his wonderful video on Peppercorn steak.  our dinner guests really enjoyed his insight into a well made demi-glaze. all of our entr√©es and appetizers were perfect. The service was excellent and I know we will be returning there soon and often."}
{"text":"We had Dinner at Marcos on March 3, 2016. We had a Great time and Fabulous food. We started with Sauted Mushrooms and the Bread Basket. The mushrooms had a great flavor and the rolls where crusty and warm. We shared a Holistic Salad that was fresh and delicious.I had the Gnocchi al'Dom with Chicken and Pesto sauce that was Amazing. The chicken was lightly breaded, tender and juicy. My wife had the Rapini Dinner that had great flavors. We shared an Italian Sausage and a Meatball both where delicious. My Brother and Sister In law had the Veal Scallopini and enjoyed it immensely. After dinner we visited with Marco and talked about the towns in Italy our families came from. All in all it was a great time and great food."}
{"text":"We had dinner here and the food was good but the service was kind of slow. It wouldn't have stopped us from returning until my boyfriend posted some feedback on yelp about it and the owner replied with the most rude & unprofessional comment. If he wonders why his restaurant is practically empty on a Friday night it's because he has no idea how to treat customers who provide feedback. I would have originally given it a three star rating until the yelp review. Not only will we never return but we will make sure to let our friends know not to bother. There are plenty of nicer places in town we can go for good Italian food. Good luck w your business when you treat customers like crap. This guy is an idiot. Eat at New Yorks Best Italian Bistro. They have they best Italian food in town, the best service & the nicest owners & managers."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant with delicious dishes and service! Marco knows his clients and has a wonderful family ambiance!
Try the chicken scallopini with a glass of his new Chardonnay.  The  holistic salad is my favorite!!!"}
{"text":"We are so fortunate this little gem is in walking distance from us. Very authentic, great vibe, great service, fresh from scratch and mostly organic. It doesn't get much better than Marco's."}
{"text":"First time ordering food from Marco's. We decided to do take out to test it out. Ordered the margarita pizza and baked ziti with meat sauce.

The pizza dough was soggy and was not cooked all the way through. I tasted fine, but was difficult to eat with out falling apart because you could not pick it up. This was the only pizza I've ever had that the crust and dough were not cooked enough to pickup. Of course when I make pizza at home on a pita this happens, but I paid Marco $13 for this so called pizza.

The baked ziti was very soupy like in consistency. Tasted fine, but didn't look very appealing to eat. The meat sauce in side looked strange as their were bits of hard cut up meat pieces that at first I couldn't figure out what it was.

The problem is Marco's is that there are no less than 3 very italian restaurants within 2 miles (Vito's 3 blocks away, Nicks about 2 miles away, and Spinatos about 3 block across the street) so if you want customers to come back, the food must be better. 

Unfortunately, the food is much worse and is probably why when I walked in the place to pick up my takeout it was pretty emply at 7pm. If you go into any of the other places I mention at 7pm, you have to wait about 10-20 to get in.

Perhaps it is time to call \"Restaurant Impossible\" to this place out before it goes out of business. Seems like they could make it work, but Marco thinks he's a much better chef that he really is and may be the only one who loves his own cooking!

Even if I had a Groupon I wouldn't come back!"}
{"text":"Food is very good. The staff is family and Marco the chef. The service is poor. Marco should hire a staff that could keep guests comming back. When all the local Italian restraunts  are full we go to Marcos.  It is empty for a reason, high prices and  poor
seating, service, house wine.  The  60s live  music (1 man on a ele. piano)  works only for Marco's Mom.  Sorry I will make a reservation elsewhere."}
{"text":"The food is authentic.  I ordered Gnocchi with pesto sauce.  The portions are large.  The staff is outstanding, very friendly.  A family atmosphere."}
{"text":"This food is so amazing Marco put so much effort into his preparation I have never had a bad meal have been going there for over 2 Years Amazing Pl."}
{"text":"Last night was my first time eating at Marco's and I have to say that really enjoyed the food. I had the Veal Parma and it was soft and tasty. I also enjoyed the pesto and white sauce that my companion had ordered. I will definitely return to Marco's again to support a local business."}
{"text":"Food was amazing.  By far one of the best places in Scottsdale! Very pleased. Service was sub par, but non the less I will be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent Italian restaurant! We are in from out of town and found this restaurant close to where we are staying. I'm so glad we did! Great service, wine and food."}
{"text":"Awesome food ! Best italian food I've ever had !! Great cook ! Staff was friendly ! The patio dining was very cozy and the bread was warm and fresh."}
{"text":"The food was good but they nickel and dime you.  $2 for the bread, $1 for this $2 for that, so it adds up at the end.   The service was slow, waiter was nice but didn't come around often enough."}
{"text":"We visited last night (Friday 6/19) and it was our first visit.  Our server was Jesse.  We loved everything....the food was fantastic and so was the service.

We commented that we didn't even know you were there and that we would definitely be back because everything was so great!"}
{"text":"I had the veal. It was so tough, so lacking of flavor, I couldn't eat but a few bites of it. I was told that this was Marco's signature dish, so no need to ever go back there. When I told him is was awful, he simple said I was wrong. THAT'S GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE!  

Then when I tried to order a martini, because there is a small bar there, he said he didn't have the Vodka and other items to make it!  REALLY!  No Vodka!  You've got to be kidding me!  Do you have any idea what little effort it takes to make a martini!  

My date also didn't like the food here and hated the fact that he had no ability to make a simple martini. WOW!"}
{"text":"The meal was delicious.  My husband had the Eggplant Parm and I had the Salmon special.  We so enjoy eating at this restaurant.  The food is always delectable.  Jesse, our server was wonderful.  He was attentive - always checking to see how our food was and filling up our water glasses.  We have been here several times - first introduced by my son that took us there, as this has become his favorite Italian restaurant in the city...it now has become ours!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner here last night and it was absolutely delicious. The service was great and the ambiance was truly italian. The piano man added a delightful touch of the type and genre of music we enjoy.   We will definitely return to this \"taste of Italy.\"  Loved it!!!"}
{"text":"We come here often.  The place is sporatically busy then not.  I don't get it as the food is super.  The home made fettucini is wow, as it the Bolognese sauce.  Garlic shrimp over pasta, yum.  Chicken dishes are good as well.  I have sampled most of them and the chicken is moist and well prepared.  My cousin had a veal dish last night and loved it as well (veal parm).  This place needs more customers!  Try it!"}
{"text":"Nice restaurant inside and excellent staff. Prices are reasonable and the food is very tasty! not sure why its not busier inside...kind of a tucked away location. The chef/owner is super nice and takes the time to make his rounds to visit his guests. Class act."}
{"text":"Excellent frutti de mare. 
Good service.
Fair price
Will return
Was disappointed however at the $3 extra charge for anchovies with the Caesar salad. Never remember being charged extra when requesting anchovies in any other restaurant.Always thought anchovies were a part of Caesar when available. To me it's like being charged extra for butter when you order bread.???????

{"text":"Never really liked Italian food until I tried Marcos Italian Bistro. My mom first introduced me to the restaurant and ever since I only eat Italian food here. I have tried a lot of dishes on the menu and each time I get fresh, high quality, and organic ingredient food. Atmosphere is calm and friendly. If you want a great dinner in a smooth Italian atmosphere this is the place to be."}
{"text":"Nice people and atmosphere but terrible foods. Cesar salad skimmy , dry plane bread role and veal was tough. I am unsure why anyone would ever return. I went after seeing the reviews. Try Nic's for the best Italian food in the area. I really wish Marco's was  better. :("}
{"text":"This is an outstanding Italian restaurant.  
We had the pleasure of dinner here last Saturday evening and the food and atmosphere were outstanding!

The service was amazing and the timing between initial appetizer and meal was perfect.

The Chillean Sea Bass was excellent as well as the veal.  The couple with us had the calamari and shrimp which was a chef fav and it looked amazing.
The desserts were also yummy!

We live in Fountain Hills so have a short drive to enjoy the best of Italian food!  We have visited multiple other Italian restaurants in the Valley and found this to be at the top of the list.  We will definitely return and tell our friends of the \"gem\" we found!"}
{"text":"I am retired Italian from Brooklyn and finally found an authentic Italian restaurant . We were invited by friends for my Birthday and it was the best fruita de Mare that I ever ate, that is a fish dish with about a pound and a half of fish, shrimps and clams over a plate of Linguini. The sauce was just like mom used to make, great for dipping the bread. The owner Heard it was my Birthday and came out with the most delicious Telamisu cake with a candle on it, on the house! Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Really good place.  I liked the fact that customers can choose the level of spice. It is a small place but is really, really good."}
{"text":"I got a to go order of margerita pizza, penne rigatoni with tomato basil sauce, and fresh bread.
Pizza was very good, not greasy and perfectly done.
Pasta was great, this place boasts using fresh quality ingredients and you can really taste it!
Bread was also great, I received 4 pieces for $2.
Staff was prompt and helpful, I look forward to eating here whenever I want Italian. There are like 3 other Italian restaurants  right around here and this is by far the best!"}
