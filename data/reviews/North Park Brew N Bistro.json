{"text":"Off of Fairmount Circle at the main entrance to John Carrol University, This place is not and easy find.  It's hidden in plain sight, two doors down from Ben & Jerry's ice cream.

The menu features sandwiches, burgers, salads and wraps.

The \"Drew Carey\" salad hit the spot for lunch.  Mixed greens, tomatoes, olives, shredded cheddar, blackened strip steak all on a bed of French Fries.  Yes... French Fries.

So,  after my healthy salad, I wandered two doors down for a double Very Cheery Garcia on a waffle cone FTW."}
{"text":"Ummmmm.....your on a college campus and you close at like 8pm?!?!?! What is wrong with you? I like the place but it's never open!"}
{"text":"With so many great cafes in Cleveland, North Park Brew & Bistro just falls short. In the time I've gone to John Carroll, this place has changed names/ownership at least twice, but the overall quality has remained generally the same. 

Their coffee is weak. It doesn't stack up to the coffee you can get at one of the nearby Phoenix cafes, but if you're stuck on the JCU campus and can't sneak away, it's (slightly) better than buying coffee at Einstein's Bagels.

The food is average and pricey for what it is. If you want a sandwich, you're better off going to Dave's Cosmic Subs next door. If you want a good sit-down experience, you're better off going to Pizzaz, also next door. 

The atmosphere inside is weird. There is a huge window along North Park Blvd, but the back of the cafe is dark, creating a strange lighting situation during the day. The hours are limited. They're only open until 9pm during the week and 7pm on the weekend. For a coffee shop directly adjacent to a college campus, that's telling you something.

It's not a terrible place, I just don't find a compelling reason to go when so many other great options exist nearby."}
{"text":"Good coffee, free wireless and they just upgraded their menu much to my delight. Only complaint: they serve drinks in goofy tall glasses. What's the problem with mugs, dammit?"}
