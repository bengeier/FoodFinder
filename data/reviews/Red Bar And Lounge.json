{"text":"Great place to get caught in the crossfire of a drug fueled shootout.a blight to the neighborhood.every other business will suffer because of this place"}
{"text":"The color scheme and layout are impressive. The space is large and open - but on a Friday night, it seemed relatively empty. The food was mediocre and overpriced, and the service was slow. The real surprise was the price-gouging on the bill. We paid $6.00 per ounce for a shot of Jameson. Order two doubles and you might as well just buy your own bottle from a liquor store! If the lounge was located in a different neighborhood or had a more upscale environment, these prices may make more sense. But I'll choose one of the surrounding local bars over this place next time for sure."}
{"text":"Food is amazing, and plenty of space to hang out with friends. Love the pool tables and corn hole upstairs!"}
{"text":"This place is a little odd...part lounge, part sports bar, part dance club, part pool hall. I suppose it's nice that it's a location that fits many needs, but the juxtaposition a sports game on the massive television next to three (empty) roped off VIP seating areas just seemed weird.   Our server was really sweet and attentive, and she was probably the highlight of our experience (and the reason for three stars). Red's website has a list of specialty cocktails, but when I asked our server about them, she said they just had wine, beer, and spirits. We ended up ordering two single pours of Jameson and I was really disappointed because they actually tasted watered down. Whiskey has a distinct bite; this didn't.   Additionally, the hummus tasted store bought and the air had a slight hint of cigarette smoke. When we walked out, there were at least 3 or 4 people smoking in the alcove entrance. They thanked us for coming, leading me to believe that they were employees or owners who should know, follow, and enforce Ohio smoking laws.  I think this would be a great place to collectively watch a playoff game because of the giant television. That said, plenty of other places with better food and drinks would also fit that bill."}
