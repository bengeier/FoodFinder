{"text":"A local establish that has a loyal following. No real bar for cocktails but ample beer selection.   I was impressed with the servers knowledge and courtesy. It's hard to find great service and this is a four star service parlor.   Two styles of crust. Thin or original. I would order original for take out because it holds up better. Thin crust is NYC style thin crust.   This is not Papa Johns quality and the prices reflect the difference. Large cheese, large pep, sausage, onion and mushroom combined with a family size salad was 61.00. Not cheap but the quality is clearly different.   Pizza was above Papa John's and below lombardi's.   Salad dressing (house) was excellent.   Overall, I would go again but wouldn't drive out of my way for the pie."}
{"text":"They make a GREAT thin-crust sausage pizza.  The reason I don't give them more stars is because the service is consistently slow and the decor is dated.  If you go there, the pizza is great as long as you don't mind the long wait.  Even if you are the only customer in the place you will have a long wait"}
{"text":"This pizza is  very, very delicious and high quality ingrediants.  the sausage is homemade and among the best I've had.  The sauce and crust just perfect.  Visting form Chicago and I may have to go back again one nore time before I return Very nice staff too"}
{"text":"Absolutely horrendous service, pizza that is basically worse than frozen pizza. The waitress was 100 and we waited an hour and a half for them to forget our order. Ridiculous prices for the service and the terrible food!"}
{"text":"Got there to pick up our three pizzas (one kids) which cost over 80 dollars.  They were just going in the oven.  The friendly young employee behind the counter kindly offered us a drink while we waited.  Then the little old lady in a walker caught her employee delivering good service and became irate.  She made this poor employee charge us four dollars for my son's sprite.  Never returning needless to say."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza. I'm kinda a pizza snob having grown up on the east coast with frequent trips to NYC.  Its as good as some of the spots in NYC and even Rome. It definitely hit the spot. Best pizza I've had in at least a year. My wife gives it 5 stars. My wife and I will be coming back for more."}
{"text":"Still the best pizza known to man!    As a kid (at the Scottsdale location) I hated this pizza, but as I grew to realized that Peter Piper actually tasted like cardboard, I have never found a pizza that compares to Pizzafarro's.  Great pizza everytime.  Order the works!  Their sausage has no equal on this earth!  And...I love their ranch. I'm sure it's hidden valley from the packet and mass produced, but WHO does not love this ranch?  The servers are sometimes busy, but always working hard to get you the best service possible.   Good people, good food."}
{"text":"Excellent gluten free thin crust pizza. Got the Margarita. Delicious! We ate outside with our dog. There are only 3 tables but we were lucky and it wasn't busy."}
{"text":"Used to love the pizza here, but tonight ruined the chance of me coming back. Showed up at 6 to order a pizza to go, pizza is finally ready at 7:15. I can be understanding with this because they could have been backed up, but the inside was at maybe 30% capacity. After receiving my pizzas I saw that they had forgot 2 add on ingredients for one of the pizzas. When I told them that this was incorrect the 1st response was \" is it alright if we put the missing toppings in a plastic cup to go\"? I said absolutely not. When you charge near $30 for pizza with $3.75 for extra toppings, I want it in the pizza! The owner came out and asked me what my issue was, and even questioned whether I had given my order correct. They did not offer to do anything to fix the mistake or keep me as a customer. Business must be so good that you can treat people badly and have nothing to worry about it. Well they will lose my service. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Do not go here if you are in a hurry... Allow at least an hour and a half minimum. I think the pizza is great, but the service is ssslllloooooooow. Every time we go there it's always the same girl waitress. Don't get me wrong, she's nice... but she sucks. Super slow. No hustle in her step. Usually you sit there around five minutes before even being greeted by her. Then after five minutes she takes your drink order. Then another five minutes for her to bring your party of four their fountain drinks. Then you place order. About an hour goes by before the two pizza's come out. Don't get me wrong, the pizza is always cooked perfectly, but really.... an hour for a pizza to cook??? And not to mention, we always go there early so there's literally like two other tables in there. Forget being brought a refill without having to hollar across the restaurant to her or wave your arms like an idiot to get her attention."}
{"text":"Horrible Sunday dining experience!  I have noticed the reviews for Pizzafarro's which seemed enjoyable.  Based on the reviews of their pizza, I was certain other menu selections would be as delicious.  Unfortunately, this was the furthest from possible.  Upon arrival we were greeted by a lovely young lady.  We were seated and began our dinner selection.  As an Italian lover, I decided I would order the Chicken Parmesan while my dining partner ordered the  Spaghetti Special.  Salad or Italian coleslaw was offered with both meals.  I opted for an Antipasti as my dining partner had the coleslaw.  The Antipasti was a very basic deli meat small slice of pepperoni, salami and olives over crisp lettuce.    The meals arrived to our table 30 minutes after ordering.  We did not mind the time delay as we were able to sip tea and chat over our day.  Once both plates were served, we were excited to try our newly found bistro in our area.  Wowzers were we in for a shock.  After being utterly underwhelmed from the over cooked and cold pasta, the obviously canned sauce without seasoning and the wet and mushy microwave frozen dinner style chicken patty.  While attempting to keep the bites we had eaten down, we were unable to swallow another bite of our meals.  I honestly can not understand how pasta could go so wrong.  We paid for our meals, kindly tipped and thanked our waitress who was super sweet by the way.  This place needs a visit from Gordon Ramsay.  I hope your experience there will be much better than ours.  GOOD LUCK!"}
{"text":"We are from Pa. here for a month and have frequented Binks, while there we smelled the aromas for Pizzfarro.s.  We decided to give it a try and    We had a great dinner at Pizzafarro's.  The server was very helpful and pleasant. Pizza was great and Pasta was great!!!  Would like to suggest to the person who had a wrong order twice to check it next time.  Shame on them once and shame one you twice!!!!"}
{"text":"This is a small, family owned Italian restaurant that offers exceptionally good food in an unpretentious atmosphere. The ingredients are fresh and the pizza and other dishes are hand made. We are happy to drive the 12 miles round trip for pizza takeout about once a week. My wife and I love exploring the Valley's eateries, and this is one of our favorites."}
{"text":"Wow, this is a GREAT Pizza Parlor! My husband and I dined here based on a friend referral. I had the Margherita Pizza with Antipasto Salad, he had the Sausage/Bell Pepper with Marinara sauce Sandwich and Garlic Bread. The thin crust on my pizza was the absolute best and freshest ever, including all the other ingredients. Oh my gosh, my husband loved the homemade italian sausage and marinara sauce used on his sandwich.  Along with the GREAT food, our waiter was very friendly and attentive. We can't wait to come back. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time this evening. Ordered a thin crust margherita pizza. I was told there would be a 50-minute wait. An hour and twenty minutes later, I finally received it. And it was seriously one of the worst pizzas I've ever had. And it was $30!"}
{"text":"After being away for a few years, we went back for dinner last night.  We will not return, ever.  The receptionist was lovely, the service was awful!  Slow, no check back to refill water, etc.  It was 5:00 p.m. and basically empty.  We thought it was pretty pricy. The Eggplant Parm was dreadful. Obviously, it had been nuked. My husband's clam sauce was watery and pretty tasteless.  Evidently, the take out keeps them in business.  Pizzafarros won't have our business again."}
{"text":"Love Love Love their pizza. It is made just right. If you can get past the dated decor, you can really focus on the main reason to be there: their pizza. This is a 30 minute drive from where I am located, but well worth the drive. I would advice those that had a bad experience before to give them another try. My husband and I visit once a week, simply because it is the best pizza in town. We will continue to frequent there once a week for our favorite pizza!"}
{"text":"We pass by Pizzafarro's quite frequently as we drive into Carefree and with voracious appetites decided to stop in early one evening a couple of weeks ago. The hostess/waitress was so friendly, let us seat wherever we wanted and efficiently took our order . . .   \"Could I have eggplant on my pizza?\" I asked. She gave me an inquisitive look but went to ask the \"chef\" or as I suspected, owner, who said that in all his years, he has only had three requests for eggplant on a pizza, so it's not offered on the menu, but if that is what I wanted, that's what he would do. My husband and I both ordered extra large pizzas, and both the owner and waitress asked \"are you sure you want extra large pizzas?\"  Of course we did . . . he likes his with so many things I don't and vice versa, and the test of a pizza is how good it tastes on day 2, day 3, etc., even after it has been frozen and defrosted and reheated.  Once our pizzas came our eyes bugged out.  Beautiful handmade pizzas . . . gargantuan! I could eat only one slice before feeling full. I have to admit that I am an uber fan of the Neapolitan style cracker thin crust pizzas, so this was a real change of pace for me.  I will also admit that I didn't have enough patience to wait for the pizza to cool off before digging in, so of course, I burned my tongue on my first bite, so the rest of the slice was just so-so.  And I thought it was a little light on seasonings and flavors.  I am glad I waited a few days to write my review because I probably would have given Pizzafarro's a real \"meh\" review, but subsequent slices have been quite delicious even after freezing and nuking.  I noticed quite a few seniors frequent this place . . . not sure if they are long-time locals who have been frequenting the establishment, or if it is just a reflection on the neighborhood, or if it was just an off night.    We still like the Neapolitan pizzas with the gourmet toppings better, so I can't say that we'll be back so soon, but for traditional pizza with traditional toppings, a friendly and homey atmosphere, this is a nice local gem.  No wonder it has been around for years!"}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant ever! I've been eating here for over 10 years and it keeps impressing me every time!"}
{"text":"Every weekend I come to buy pizza on Saturday specifically because I know the pizza cook, Tyler. He just has a way of making the best pizza I have ever had. My family and I recommend it to all our friends. Best pizza cook to date! He's extremely friendly as well."}
{"text":"Decent little spot.  We came here after a 9 hour drive and it was very good.  Pasta, wings. Salad, beer, waitstaff.   Do the math and it adds up to a 3 star spot!  Thanks for the eats."}
{"text":"Very good pizza. If you beat the rush hour its not very packed, however don't expect fast service, as this is not dominoes or papa johns. The pizza is worth the wait, by far the best pizza Ive ever had. (Bonus points for serving pepsi)"}
{"text":"Have not been there in a few years.  This experience was not good.  The salad was quite nice.  The wine was just OK.  The pizza was not was  worth $25 for a 14 inch pizza.  It was so crispy and loaded with corn meal it was almost hard to chew. Paid for extra cheese, didn't see any. Their sausage used to be fabulous, now its bland. They had no shaker cheese so the waiter gave us some packets of cheese and guess what was in it \"GROUND CELLULOSE\" YEP.  WHAT IS CELLULOSE?  Cellulose is a long chain of linked sugar molecules that gives wood its remarkable strength.   YEP WOOD   Total bill $57 + TAX $10  The owners are a nice old couple, I dont know whats happening there its a shame it used to be a great stop for fabulous pizza.  Not like it was in Scottsdale...sorry to say"}
{"text":"I crave this pizza. Get the thin crust and load it up with toppings. Not a fancy place but definitely friendly and very accommodating. I see couples in here on dates and entire extended families with grandpas and babies and everyone in between. The decor is dated, but you don't go for the upholstery, you go for the pizza which I am now wildly craving. BRB."}
{"text":"I've been eating Pizzafarro's pizza for over 30 years.  My mouth waters every time.  Their pizza is among the best I've had anywhere.  I always recommend Pizzafarro's any time someone asks for a pizza restaurant.  My hearty thanks to the owners for their years of putting out a great product and nice family restaurant."}
{"text":"Our favorite ever pizza place. We lived here from 1979-1987. We use to go to the original  one in phx. We just moved back and we are thrilled they are in carefree.  Love this place"}
{"text":"The pizza is good, but we've had horrible service the last two times we went. It's also rather expensive."}
{"text":"If I'm craving a delicious margherita pizza, this is my go to place! It is to die for! Thick and tastey and so incredibly perfect every time!    The decor is nothing fancy, but I don't care about that. I care about the food and it never disappoints!"}
{"text":"Not only is the pizza bad and service slow, but make sure you don't drop anything of value or the staff will steal it. I dropped my iPhone 7+ getting out of my car to visit Cafe Bink next door. One of Pizzafaro's employees picked it up and kept it. I had to go to the back door of the restaurant where I found my phone in the employees hands. The owner laughed at my wife when she complained. Do not eat at this establishment. Bad people!"}
{"text":"Had the margarita pizza... Needless to say it was the best pizza I've had almost ever. No joke.must try if you've never been"}
{"text":"Best pizza this side of the Mississippi! I like the fact that you can order either a thin crust or regular crust. They also have a large array of toppings and their pizza is always consistent."}
{"text":"This makes me sad, we used to go there all the time but the service and food has gone way downhill. The wine and beer selection is so bad-and the wine is terrible stuff. Pizza is greasy, and tough. We are going to try again to see if they have improved, but the last two visits left a bad case of heartburn. The all '80's decor is a hoot, but they could clean it up a bit."}
{"text":"Average atmosphere.  A little pricey, but very good pizzas.  When we want takeout pizza--it's our go-to choice."}
{"text":"What do you get when you mate an old folks home and a pizzeria---Pizzafarro's.  If any of you have a 90 year old Aunt Gladys she won't step a foot out the door unless you're taking her to Pizzafarro.  The decor is old fashioned, stained carpeting, old waitresses.  I'm too young to die, please take me to Pomo!  The pizza isn't horrendous but it isn't wonderful either.  Think of Barros pizza on a bad night, put in an empty septuagenarian hang out and you have Pizzafarro's.  The salads are one step above airline salads with the small plastic container of \"Italian Dressing.\"  I don't mean to be so cruel, but honestly I don't see why people go here when you can go to Pomo, Andreoli as gold medalists and Bosco as the bronze.  If you're younger than 70, you have so much to live for, why hop in the wheelchair now?#%&*$"}
{"text":"Service is always good, food is inconsistent. Sometimes the pizza is terrific, other times, a frozen pizza from the supermarket would be better. The Decor in this place is horrendous..the owner must have the first penny he made as this place has the original 1970s decor he started with when he opened. While sitting near the back of the place and waiting for my food, I noticed a 'stenchy' smell from the ladies room..in fact the door into the ladies room is propped open with a trash can so the room can air out..right into the dining area. Really disgusting. Prices are on the high side for sure.  The best way to deal with this place is to do take out that way you don't have to look at the crappy 1970s decor and don't have to smell the stench from the ladies room."}
{"text":"Pizza Farros is fantastic hands down my favorite pizza place in Arizona. This is not the place to go when you are short on time. Pizzas take 45 minutes to make on a good day. I have been eating at Pizza Farros since I moved to Arizona in 95."}
{"text":"Who knew!?  I mean seriously, who knew the pizza in what can only be described as \"this pizza joint\" could be this good?  I have lived here for 4 years now and have never been here before.  Upon reflection, this place appears to be so average and uninviting on the outside that it never occurred to me to walk in and check it out.  On the inside, it appears to be equally uninviting.  Looks however can be deceiving and deceived I have been.   The pizza is absolutely divine. Not cheap either. We had a 14\" pie with sausage, a meatball, mushrooms and onions which set us back $25.50.      Regardless of the price, it was delicious.    Will we come back?  Absolutely!  And de we recommend it?  Absolutely, positively YES!!"}
{"text":"Excited for pizza over the weekend because the last pizza I had was amazing. We called ahead an order of 2 pizzas and a kids spaghetti. Staff was a little slow. It also seemed like we were a inconvenience when asking for water refills. The food was good, but not as good as we've previously had. The dough was flat and not as think as normal. The spaghetti was pretty bland and uneventful. The reason I'm doing a 3 is because a $76 pizza visit should be pretty extraordinary in my mind. Hoping for better za's next time!"}
{"text":"A good friend that recently moved here from Chicago recommended this place to me because he said this was best pizza hes ever had...and he was right! This place is downright delicious!...who cares about their old fashion decor when their pizza is that good!  It's a little bit of a hike to get to if you don't live in Cave Creek but it is definitely worth the drive."}
{"text":"The food is \"ok\", wine seriously overpriced ....the clientele, definitely all cast members from Cocoon and the decor hasn't been updated since 1992.  A dinner for 2 adults and 3 kids was over $100.  You decide...."}
{"text":"If only it were closer but it's well worth the drive.  It's tucked away in a plaza in Cave Creek.  The interior is very geriatric but the food is amazing!    We split a sausage pizza and I can't remember the last time I had sausage that fresh!  Yummy!  Everything is made from scratch so you don't have that bloated feeling after you devour half a pizza packed with preservatives.  Next time I will try the tasty desserts that were staring me down as I left."}
{"text":"I may have a problem. I find something that I love and then I keep coming back and ordering that special something until either my brain explodes or the location stops making it the same way. Generally, it's the latter.   Back in the day, I used to go to Pizzafarro's in Scottsdale all the time. I'm a Chicago food girl who's always looking for a delicious deep dish pizza and, boy, did I ever find it there. Always a sausage and onion deep dish that took forever to bake, but so worth the wait. Then they closed down. I was heartbroken. Or maybe stomach broken? Perhaps even taste bud broken. That is, until I found out recently that the original Pizzafarro's was still available at my disposal. Huzzah! Pizza, please!  The half hour drive to do a pick up order in Carefree was nothing. When we got there, the place was pretty empty, but was charming and cozy. Might need a little bit of a décor update. With our pizza, we also grabbed a four pack of bottled root beer for the ride back.   The deep dish I was looking forward to was light and airy with a crispy crust and tasty ingredients. The pizza I ate was heavy, a little undercooked, and all-around unimpressive. Memories? Consider yourself shattered. I'm sure their thin crust pizza is fine, but I probably won't be the one to seek it out."}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza in the North Valley.  Always very cordial staff and excellent food!"}
{"text":"If I could give a zero I would.   Rest assured that there will be plenty of zeros after the first number on your bill.   We ordered a 16\" half \"Potluck\" and half \"Ham and Pineapple.\" The whole Potluck in a 16\" with at least 6 toppings is $25.25.  A whole 16\" two topping Ham and Pineapple is 24.20.  So how much was a half Potluck and half Pineapple and Ham you ask?  31.45!    I spoke with Don the owner and asked him to explain and he couldn't. Simply said that's how we do it. Ha!  Guess if you can get it you charge it.   Ever heard the expression \"I got effed at the used car lot?\"  I'll never go back. You shouldn't go at all.   Sad fact is the pizza was great and I knew ahead of time it was going to be expensive. I just didn't realize the meal came without Vaseline."}
{"text":"Good but not great. Friendly. Empty.  The above capture my experience at Pizzafarro's, an intended quick stop before catching a flight back to a strange and distant habitat where 95 is considered hot. Arriving shortly after 5 on a Tuesday, we were the only dine-in patrons until right before we left when a lone diner arrived, signaling either a general or specific off-season.  We settled on a loaf of garlic bread without melted cheese ($3.50) and a two-topping large 16' (~$23) with spinach and mushrooms. A brief aside - I come from the land of NY style pizza, and currently live in the land of not much resembling pizza. Under that lens, the garlic bread was a bit weak on the garlic and it was the best and will be the best pizza I've had in months with the right amount of oil and cheese, but the standard crust was a bit too hard and dry for me to appreciate it when compared to my memories of pizza in the NY area and the price seemed a bit high even for a boutique community.   Pizzafarro's has mostly a monopoly on its market in its surrounding neighborhood and history to sustain it, since the commercial zones of Carefree (and Cave Creek) are practically non-existent. For a near the only game in town establishment, for convenience or in a hurry, one could do far worse, but there are better options (consider N.Y.P.D.) if one doesn't mind a short drive, already an Arizona residency requirement."}
{"text":"The food is great here. The pizza is always good, as well as the ravioli. The service could be better, they always feel overwhelmed and not as friendly as they could be. But overall I love this place and will continue to go with family!"}
{"text":"Super nice staff!  Food is delicious! So Fresh !  I always sppreciate the hostess asks if we have preferred sesting.  Such a simple question but so appreciated.  Thankyou Madeleine. Having never eaten there before our waiter John was very helpful. He helped us make the best choices for our appetites and tastes!"}
{"text":"There is not one nice thing I can say about this place.  And, I'm trying to think of one...believe me.  We went for dinner last night, and were there early.  There were only two other tables in the whole place.  We ordered buffalo wings, which came out fried with spice on them, but no sauce whatsoever.  We asked for buffalo sauce, as noted in the menu, and the server shrugged and said they didn't have any.  Um, OK.  50 minutes went by from the time we ordered, and our entrees came.  DH had a meatball sub, I ordered chicken parm.  My chicken parm was cold.  It was cooked through, but had been prepared far earlier than it was served, and had been nuked.  His sub was blazing hot.  We both felt the kitchen screwed up, as waiting 50 minutes with no one in the place was strange.  Regardless, I wasn't comfy eating cold chicken, so, it got sent back.    The décor is also super depressing.  The servers move beyond slowly and are inattentive.  There is just some strange negative vibe in this place, and I couldn't wait to get out.  Still, our wings, two drinks, and his sub cost us $42 with tip.  Ridiculous."}
{"text":"Wow, this pizza is awesome.  Had the thin crust and it was fabulous...their Italian sausage has just the right amount of seasoning....wish I could find something comparable in Texas."}
{"text":"I think this family made the very first pizza I ever tasted. That's the story I'm going to stick with anyway (it was probably Chucky Cheese in reality). I have been a rabid fan of the pizzas they make for over 25 years.   I remember when they were on Camelback near 44th Street. As a kid, I remember being afraid to try it, but after some coaxing I became a huge fan. Then they moved to the Scottsdale and Shea location... I have most of my memories of it here. Their kids opened a spinoff location on Indian School and 46th, but that eventually closed - it was never quite the same (though it was similar). The Scottsdale and Shea location finally closed two years ago much to my dismay.  I only recently discovered this location way the hell up north. I'm glad to see them still making pizza (yeah, it's the same people - I recognized the chef/owner), and I'm even more glad to find that it's just the same as I remember. The crust is simple, the sauce is mild but plentiful, the cheese is gooey and high quality, and the toppings are fresh and delicious.   Everyone has their favorite pizza and this is mine. Nothing has changed about it in a quarter of a century. It's still awesome. I always get Sausage and Pepperoni in case you're wondering.  Aside from the quality of the food (which is amazing), the staff is nice. The interior needs a little work (it's kinda ugly - they should at least go back to the checkerboard tablecloths). The place kinda stinks too for some reason. It's not the food though... I don't know what the deal was with that. As soon as our pizza came, the smell went. Maybe someone ordered a stinky sandwich? Or maybe someone's colostomy bag needed to be emptied... I mean, the customers were a little on the silverhair side today. I'm sure it varies a lot.   I do love the food here - I wish they would move close to me.  Oh, and as has always been the case, the prices are pretty reasonable. It was less than 20 bucks for the two of us. Go check it out - definitely worth the trip."}
{"text":"Our favorite pizza for 30 years. Be ready for best home made sausage on thin crust. Warm, family run."}
{"text":"Awesome Pizza! Pricey though. The sauce on the pizza is the best I have ever tasted. Excellent balance of crunch on the crust. Megan, the counter girl, was outstanding!!! Very sweet!"}
{"text":"Great Pizza, well worth a try for anyone that enjoys a good Chicago style Pizza! Friendly place with moderate décor.   One thing, we like going out to eat with other couples and always request separate checks, this way we have the convenience of each couple ordering what they want and not worrying about splitting the  tap. At Pizza Farrro's they only write one check per table and it always becomes a hassle trying to figure out the bill.  Please Pizza Farro's change your rules to allow separate checks!"}
{"text":"This pizza place is unassuming and out of the way. The pizza dough has the flavor of old world makings. You will not find this flavor any where else. The meatballs are homemade and carefully crafted with a little of everything. Come try it, you will come back often."}
{"text":"Boring.  Good fresh veggies, but still boring.  Also total ditz answers phone.  With lots of choices in the area, we won't be back."}
{"text":"This felt like a twilight zone episode where I'm transported to a small town in an unknown city somewhere in the Midwest or other undesirable part of the country, and I'm at some \"local place\" that the locals love but really it's just a reflection of the lack of quality options in the vicinity.  Or, the people in that undesirable place don't know any better, so they praise the best of what is available to them... and yes that is a dig at no-name cities in the Midwest, and the people who choose to live there.    This place had booth seats that must have been decades old, large wall covering mirrors, and other decor that scream 1990 or maybe earlier.  There's one box TV hanging in the back too, just in case you forgot that TV's weren't always flat paneled.  It isn't old world or quaint or anything like that.  Rather it just clearly lets you know that they don't care enough to invest in the atmosphere to a reasonable degree.  And the locals like this place well enough, so I guess to heck with those who complain about the very dated atmosphere.     To complement the atmosphere there's the slow as a snail service from a single server for the entire restaurant, at least on our weekday visit.   The usual events occurred - empty beer glass, long delay to pay and leave, etc.  Prices are also high here, so with relatively little food and drink you're finding yourself leaving a double digit tip if you just leave the expected norm of about 20%, so if that bothers you for slow, inattentive service then think twice about dining here.  Pizza crust was very good, perhaps the highlight of the experience.  But on the whole the pizza isn't overall excellent by contemporary large metro standards (remember the small town insult above).   We had one pasta entree but won't likely have another.  This seems to clearly be a pizza place.  Parking is decent and you get to enjoy the headlights of cars as they park in the first couple of spots because the lights reflect abundantly throughout the restaurant due to the mirrored walls.   This restaurant is so close to having a nice view of Black Mountain... if only they were one slot over where another restaurant is located, with the patio that overlooks the mountain.  So close.... oh well."}
{"text":"Pizzafarro's is our number 1 choice as a family! We love getting the pepperoni meatball pizza on their original crust. It's family owned and operated which makes it unique from any other pizza place. The food is delicious and the environment is always so energetic. It's a perfect restaurant for a family outing."}
{"text":"My husband and I dined at the restaurant last Wed. eve(July 13).  We ordered pasta and it was ok.  I wish we had ordered pizza instead now that I've read the reviews from the rest of you fellow diners.  My biggest disappointment was the cleanliness of the ladies restroom.  It needed attention and next time you better believe I'll be checking the restroom before I place my order for dinner not as I am about to pay my bill.  The dust on the outdated light fixtures was also not appetite- friendly.  Details, details, details but this is what raises the number of stars in any rating I have to give.         Sue and Roy  Pittsburgh, Pa."}
