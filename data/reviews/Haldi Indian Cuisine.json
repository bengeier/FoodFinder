{"text":"Great assortment of Indian and Indo Chinese cuisine (we were there in Monday night). The buffet has plenty to choose from and it's very tasty, and they also have a great desert bar with chai. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"We ordered Paneer Butter Masala, Dal Makhani and Vegetable fried rice with Chilly Paneer. All the dishes were very flavorful and delicious. The order took a little more than usual to be brought out. The Manager was apologetic and made up for it with his nice attitude. Will definitely go there again!"}
{"text":"Our new favourite Indian eatery.  We were trolling along Bell Rd looking for somewhere to eat as one of our other haunts had shut down.   Dropped in to Haldi at 9:30pm on a Saturday night out of desperation due to the time.
The room was quiet and the staff pleasant.   The food arrived in good time and was delicious.  As good or better than any Indian food I've ever had.
I was amused at the amount of late night traffic that showed up even after us, with a high proportion of families.  The number of Indians present gives weight to the legitimacy of the food.
At 10pm the place was packed and a very cozy conversational buzz filled the air.
We've ordered take-out since, and it didn't disappoint.
We'll be back. Many times, I suspect."}
{"text":"We went for lunch on a busy Saturday afternoon and were welcomed with a big smile. They have plenty of variety in buffet and not to mention that all are were amazing! They have both South and North Indian food. They serve you with plain/masala dosa and butter naan on your table.
They have some delicious desserts and Mango Mousse is the worth trying one.
We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"About 40 minutes before closing time my husband and I arrived for the lunch buffet. There was barely any food left after the rush hour crowd. We asked if more food would come out and they said yes.  It took a long time for tandoori chicken to come out. The glory of buffets is that you don't have to wait to eat. This is not the case with this place. I can't rate the food because there wasn't much available. They don't replenish their buffets here. Will not come back."}
{"text":"Went here for the 1st time today & I loved it! The food was amazing a great selection of vegetarian dishes. I will definitely be coming back! Love that they have a lunch buffet so you can try various dishes at once."}
{"text":"The best Indian food I've found in the Phoenix area by far. Tried both the North Indian fare and dosas - both were excellent. And the gulab jamun and rasmalai too! Definitely recommend - for authentic, unadulterated, unapologetic Indian fare."}
{"text":"Excellent food!!  We are starting a new Thanksgiving tradition. Every bite a taste sensation. Great service too."}
{"text":"Terrific authentic Indian!  Korma was excellent. Great service and the manager came to check on us."}
{"text":"Very good. Staff was awesome! Would highly recommend!  Had the Lamb Vindaloo and the Chicken tikka Masala. Service was great."}
{"text":"For the experience alone, I gave Haldi 5 Stars. We never ate Indian cuisine before but we went for the Monday 6pm buffet. This option allowed us to taste an array of food that was amazing. We loved discovering unique items. We both loved the spices on the fish and many flavors in the chicken options. Vegetarian's would be pleased as well. The owner/ manager was so kind and encouraged us to try different items.  Go and be sure to leave room for the dosa's. Those and the breads made fresh are worth the journey. 
P.S. The place is spotless. The people ordering carry-outs kept coming in steadily. The most beautiful Indian families came strolling in to enjoy foods from their homeland. Always a good sign."}
{"text":"Really awesome Indian food. Southern/Northern fusion. The mixed veggie Dosa was excellent. You could easily fill up on Veg meals, but they also offer meat as well. We had the Haldi chicken and the flavors were very bright and intense, truly a delight. Definitely will be a 'go to' place for us.
Additional Berger is that they are open till 10pm Friday and Saturday night (there's nowhere else around to sit down and eat at night after the movies)."}
{"text":"Today on the day of Black Friday holiday we planned to hv a nice buffet but Haldi made our lunch worst. Waited 25 mins for dosa to come, their man kept coming in every 10 mins and promised to get it however every-time he came and went by just giving hopes not dosa. We got pissed off by waiting and finally left off that place. Their was no rush today in restaurant otherwise I could have understood their work load. Very very disappointed with their staff who is not interactive at all. Food and it's taste was also bad in vegetarian option. I am a pure vegetarian so talking abt veg only. Worst veg food I ever had. Service, food everything sucks. Regret to chose haldi over other Indian restaurants."}
{"text":"Good food. We regularly order manchurian here. This time we ordered mysore masala dosa. It was so good. We will be returning back."}
{"text":"Excellent. Awesome, Terrific! This place gets five stars because of its great tasting cuisine. There is a buffet with many flavorful selections. This restaurant is up and coming.  So, if you want to grab a quick bite, eat delicious food and with good customer service. This is definitely the place to go!"}
{"text":"This place was surprisingly very good for buffet Indian food. Its hard to come across good buffet food especially one that is an Indian restaurant. They have a lot of variety and tasty food, I will definitely recommend. I would absolutely go back to Haldi."}
{"text":"We have been back several times and tried quite a few of their dishes, and everything has been terrific. Wonderful flavors and perfectly spiced. Great to have such an awesome place on this side of town."}
{"text":"Well,back for dinner... Started with paneer pakora (cheese fritters), and then I had Lamb shiha korma and my wife had chicken korma. My wife's chicken was a little tough to and a little too spicy (shame).. My lamb was WONDERFUL! We shall be back again!"}
{"text":"This place keeps getting better and better. This was our fourth time here. Excellent quality and variety. Something for vegetarians and plenty of meat dishes, (fish, chicken, lamb) dosa for each, naan, and at least 6 or 7 desserts. Mango lassi, chai, too. 
Very friendly staff. 
Definitely our favorite Indian food place."}
{"text":"I am so glad a Indian place opened up by my house. The food is delicious. It is very affordable and comfortably casual. We are definitely going to make this place a pinnacle for family meals as well as date nights."}
{"text":"I'm such a big fan of Indian food, and Haldi's is definitely a great place for Indian buffet.

Honestly, the selection is so lit. They have both vegetarian and nonvegetarian options for each dish, and the unlimited naan is so great. Wonderful dishes, and the fact that it is all-you-can-eat is wonderful. I literally had to stop myself from getting more or else I would end up in a permanent food coma.

It definitely gets crowded during peak eating hours, so you may have to wait a bit. But honestly, this place is so worth the wait. Please come."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch on a Thursday afternoon at 1pm. I had a lunch group of 10 people and I called on the same day to reserve a table. Even though they don't take reservations for lunch, they said they would be happy to accommodate my group and when we arrived our table was ready with a few pitchers of water and plenty of glasses. Even though the parking lot was fairly full, I had no problem parking. There was practically a line out the door and almost every person there seemed to be of Indian descent. It smelled amazing and there were no less than 15 items on the buffet including a variety of chaat, chutneys, soup and biriyani. Fresh, hot dosas and naan were brought out to the table once we came back from the buffet to sit. Literally everything I put on my plate was delicious, flavorful and had the exact right amount of heat. I feel that many Indian restaurants tone down the heat level to appeal to a wider audience, but Haldi brings the flavor and the heat with no apologies! The lunch buffet is advertised as $9.99 came to be about $12 after tax. It was by far the best Indian buffet I have been to in the valley and I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"This is a large place with an amazing array of delicious food in their buffet.  We were in the area and decided to give them a try.  For only 9.99 you get limitless indian food choices with fresh bread brought to your table as well as Dosa.  The choices include salad components, goat and chicken dishes, various rices, dal, tandoori chicken, it goes on and on.  Desserts included my favorite Kheer (rice pudding) and something I had never had before rice curd.  I wouldn't know how to describe it but I favored the Kheer.  I think it's too much food to handle for anyone but if you are hungry and wanted well-prepared indian fare, this is the place for you.  
The people who run the place are very friendly and welcoming especially Ammy.  He suggested I get a bigger tummy when he saw that I was done with my plate.  Very funny Ammy.  I wish I did have an extra stomach for cases like this where the amount of deliciousness is overwhelming.  
Give this place a try.  BTW, they had a lot of people at lunch time so the word is out!"}
{"text":"Haldi offers the best Indian lunch buffet, fabulous selection, great tea & wonderful service from Raj!"}
{"text":"Placed an order for delivery, it was SO delicious! We had chicken tikka masala, garlic naan & the samosas. Everything had great flavor & perfect spice! The prices were very reasonable & food came quickly. We will definitely be a returning customer! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Best Indian food restaurant in the Valley. I could not believe all the options they had on their buffet. I also have to admit that I didn't know what everything was but It was all delicious, ha! I loved the fried fish, mango custard and paneer. I will be back."}
{"text":"Delicious and reasonably priced. The noon hour is usually packed so if you have the flexibility try to go a little later."}
{"text":"It was my first time trying this place. I always like to listen to reviews for restaurants. Delicious chicken tika masala, plain dosa (pancake thing), whatever those dips were yummy, and to finish off a mango dessert. Not too sweet either which I like. I'll be back for sure and recommend you guys to other people. Thank you for a delicious dinner."}
{"text":"Food is  average. But ambiance is pathetic. Crowded , no space to move around, hot. Poor service."}
{"text":"SO MANY VARIETIES  here. Must try. Really friendly staff. Really good food and so many types.  I haven't seen those many in a while. The biryani (what every is available - mutton or chicken) is a must try."}
{"text":"We did our research and sampled many Indian food restauraunts in North Phoenix to learn that Haldi Indian Cuisine is THE BEST tasting food in the area. The staff is friendly, and the food is always delicious at a reasonable price. My personal favorite is the Saag Paneer. Simply delightful!"}
{"text":"Haldi is located on a strip mall like portion of Bell Road in northeast Phoenix suburbs.  Parking in the lot outside was no problem on a Wednesday night.  

The menu is comprehensive for southern Indian style cooking.  THere are dosas as well as the normal range of sauces and styles.  Also, the service is competent and very friendly.  

We ordered masala chai to drink and it was excellent.   Thee is no alcohol on the menu, but there are lassis and soft drinks.  .  For our food, we ordered, for me,  a goat specialty cooked with sorrel leaf flavoring--spicy and outstanding.  For my wife, she ordered saag paneer mild and it too was very flavorful.  Let's point out that the side elements were also above average in flavor--chapotis, raitta, nimbu achar, and parathas.   You can look up the meaning of these terms if you aen't familiar.  We also had burfee for dessert.  

We're pretty knowledgeable and picky diners in this category.  I would rate Haldi substantially above the norm.  They have only been at this location for a year, per the server, but clearly the chef(s) know what they are doing.  If you like it spicy, as I do be sure to make that clear to the server."}
{"text":"This was our first visit for buffet lunch and we knew the moment we walked in the door that we must be in the right place because we were the only non-Indian guests. And the dining room was almost at full capacity at 1 pm on a Friday! Due to the rush, the service was a little slow and it took a bit to get naan - but I'm willing to let that slide. The steam table had so many selections that you can't try them all in a single visit and I'm already looking forward to next time! There was one curry that I wasn't a big fan of, it just wasn't my flavor, but everything else was delicious. My favorite was a curry with carrots, yams (I think), and peas that had a savory sweetness that made a good counter balance to the spicier dishes. There were also several offerings that I've never had before, so there were some new experiences, too.
If you're in North Phoenix you should check them out!"}
{"text":"Their Sunday lunch buffet is really good. I really liked it because they have dum Biryani for the buffet. The buffet is slightly overpriced at 15$"}
{"text":"This place is really good. I always eat the tikka masala. Naan bread good. Also, one of the chickpea dishes, I forget the name. This business came to my work as a food pop up, and everyone liked it. The mango lassi is good."}
{"text":"The best Indian food we've found in the Phoenix area so far. The staff is very friendly and the food is awesome. The price is good. We will be back!"}
{"text":"So came to this place for take out. Was told 20 minutes. An hour and 20 minutes later still no food.  Even if the food is great this is no way to run a business. And there was no air conditioning so waiting was hot and torturous"}
{"text":"I just tried this today, and OMG!!  Finally!  After living in PHX over a decade, I finally found a lunch buffet that is so delicious, of course, a month before I'm moving away.  Super courteous staff, large variety of fresh food, and courtesy dosa + naan!  Plus, complimentary  tasty chai tea and a few different desserts.  The best Indian lunch buffet I've been to, and best overall experience (again--nice friendly staff without being overbearing or negligent).  I hope they keep up the good work.  So thankful!"}
{"text":"This place was outstanding! Definitely coming back! Best Tikka Masala I've ever had! The naan is perfect! We will definitely be coming back for the lunch buffet so we can sample some of there other dishes! Prices were very reasonable. Yummmmmm"}
{"text":"I've never had home made Indian Food but in my mind this is what it taste like. I've had Indian in London where it is very popular and it's supposed to be good but this beats anything I've ever had. The chicken dum biryani and the chicken Tikka masala was delicious and so the was garlic naan. I read reviews that they gave you complimentary naan or dosa and they didn't while we were in so maybe it was because we were there for dinner. Other than that this was a very delicious meal"}
{"text":"This was my first time to this new restaurant and it was delicious. I had the chicken vindaloo and garlic naan and it was beautiful and delicious. I definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone who hasn't tried it yet."}
{"text":"Dosa's tastes good.
Recommend for tiffins and I hope they better the taste of other dishes which were disappointed last time."}
{"text":"Amazing food and great service, with a lot of variety for a lunch buffet. The staff was very accommodating. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Wow this was our first time not doing a dinner buffet. Must try the Tandoori Mixed grill. Comes to table sizzling. The Pan Roasted Eggplant was a perfect addition. The place went from empty to full at 730p. Can't wait to get back for a long lunch buffet!!"}
{"text":"I was so looking forward to a new Indian restaurant as I was sorely missing the closure of nearby Ananda Bhavan. I just happened to discover the presence of this new place by walking past. Unfortunately, the food completely misses the mark and the service is worse. I believe this to be a venture put forth by someone with no restaurant experience, as the staff, although pleasant enough, does not know how to serve their clientele. The only saving grace is that there naan is among the best that I have ever had. Fresh, warm redolent of the smokey flavor of the tandoori.

We came for dinner, so I do not know what the lunch buffet is like; but my experience was so poor that I will not go back to try it. We had palak panir, chicken tikka  masala and bhagara baingan and everybody had hot chai. the palak panir, with spinach and cubed cheese is one that I order often. Never have I seen it made this way with the spinach put through a processor so thoroughly that it was runnier than baby food. On top of that it was sweet, very sweet. incorrect texture and taste. I tried it and stopped eating it.

Th bhagara is an eggplant dish that is supposed to be made with a tangy tamarind and peanut sauce. No hint of any peanut flavor or of any peanut. The stems had not been removed from the miniature eggplants before cooking, and these dried, woody pieces were well concealed by the sauce. Hint to chef: remove stems before cooking. Again, overwhelming sweetness.

The chicken tikka, was again, too sweet, but the sauce was the most acceptable. The ckicken, however was dry, hard, and had an off (OLD?) taste. No one would eat the chicken, but the naan was used to eat the sauce.

At no point during the service did our server ask if we were satisfied or needing anything else. He only took our order and carried in plates. At no point was our tea refilled or an offer made to do so.

When I first saw the new restaurant, I went in to take a look. I was told that they had only opened 2 weeks ago. I went to Yelp to check reviews, and there was a picture of an opening special 30% discount. I called before leaving to see if they were honoring the offer, and they said no. I was offered a card, after I paid, for a 10% discount next visit, but no discount that night. Their web site offers a 10% discount on meals or buffet! Get your act together, you don't get a second chance to get a new customer.

Bad food, bad service, bad business management. Great naan. They should throw away their food processor, put a lock on the sugar jar and buy their chicken someplace else."}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed the extreme variety of Indian buffet after a long long time... the place is decently spacious and very clean and hygienic.. the staff and service is quick... I think it's the best I had so far in Phoenix side..."}
{"text":"Great food...I am a \"curry snob\" and I loved their curry!!  So happy you chose Surprise."}
{"text":"They told us about an offer where you order an entree and get same price entree of same category 50% off. We asked the lady who took order if she can do a mutton and paneer on the offer and she agreed also . Then the   counter guy comes to correct  us that offer can only be on mutton entrees and no veg with intention of charging us full price on both . This is after the bill is ready .We asked him to cancel the item  and take it back as we ordered it to go.

It's safe to say that after 30 minute wait between first food item and next , we did not appreciate the attitude of demanding.Also we do not appreciate saltless chutneys .

So good luck to anyone who wants to give this place a try !"}
{"text":"This is my first time at this place. It's been a long time since I have visited any Indian restaurants in the area. Reason being the deplorable quality of food. But Haldi was a pleasant surprise. I went in after more than a couple of great responses. I really liked it. The Paw bhaji was a mood uplifter. Hot Dosa and Naan and a decent variety in a buffet. I tried tasting every single dish, to find one preparation that doesn't live up to its name. I didn't find any, but again, I was stuffed midway. Although I genuinely feel that they could do away with the chowmein and concentrate only on the Indian. I loved the koftas. The chicken butter masala was average. The Biriyani was better than most places in Phoenix. And towards the end, I feel they could really improve on their dessert menus. That was clearly a lazy ensemble. Overall it's worth the amount and won't disappoint."}
{"text":"Let me begin by saying I loved the flavors and the variety at the buffet. Lots of spices, sauces, and all kinds of deliciousness. They even have soups, which I hadn't seen in previous buffets. And they make every effort to produce an authentic ambiance by adding the right music and even aromas. When I was coming in the host was lighting an insence stick. They don't have lamb, which is my all-time favorite but they had goat, so that made up for it. The locale itself and its surroundings need a lot of work, but is clean. From outside it doesn't look like any operating restaurant would be running nowhere around, but somehow they're making it work. I think at this point they're just riding with it because they have built a sure clientele that at this point is no longer interested on the esthetic of it... Just the food. This place sees a lot of foot traffic on any given day so they should be more ready for it. I for example was not offered the classic bread that comes with all Indian buffets. I actually had to ask for it. It wasn't ready. They were 'preparing it'. Also the napkins and utensils and all things you need to.sit and enjoy the buffet are just stuck on a corner, so if a dozen of people come at the same time... Which did happen while I was there, there you are with no napkins or utensils waiting for every one to pretty much get their food and clear the line..so after all this, I may be back, but not in a rush for it."}
{"text":"While in the area last night, found this gem using Yelp. We were immediately greeted and seated. Drink orders were taken and the extensive menu provided. The host answered our questions and was very helpful in making recommendations. I had lamb shahi korma and my wife had paneer badam pasanda. She's not a big meat eater and loves paneer dishes. This is now her favorite. And she has had a number of them at other fine Indian restaurants.  The lamb shahi korma was delicious--not too spicy for me--while the lamb was very tender.  Probably the best lamb I have had at an Indian restaurant. Although we were not there during buffet hours, the setup is impressive. The host gave us the buffet details, including hours and  prices--very reasonable. We will definitely return to try it. Great service, great food. If you like or love Indian food, give this place a try."}
{"text":"The best food you can ask 
Very similar to what you get in India 
The service is really good and friendly 
Big variety of food clean, organize .
I try so many place but I can now say this place is the best Indian food I ever had outside of India 
A little bit spicy but still super good"}
{"text":"Went there 3 times. Not going there any more.  The first we went they were not busy and the food was good except for one dish.  Second time we went, they were busy, and they messed up all the orders and the food was not  as good as the previous visit. The third visit their service was so bad and we have to decide not to go there any more. Their food taste deteriorated gradually."}
{"text":"Haldi Indian Cuisine by day is a buffet (at this time $9.99 weekdays, $13.99 weekend and $15.99 special ...subject to change) By night they offer an extensive menu of North and South Indian cuisine. They specialize in Biryani and Tandoor items.

I was here for the weekend buffet. They start you off with a pitcher of water, complimentary dosa and hot buttery naan. Then you help yourself.

On my visit not all but some of the offerings were - chole bhature, bhindi pakora fry, aloo balgan, kadai tofu, sag paneer, tandoori chicken, goat biryani, chicken curry, chicken tikka masala, fish pepper fry, several desserts and mango lassi.

I have to say this buffet was very VERY above average! Possibly the best buffet I've ever been too.

Everything both of us tried was delicious. Nothing was dried out. Nothing was too oily or too salty. Some of the food was spicy but nothing was too spicy. Although the buffet is more vegetarian than meat. The meat dishes were prepared and kept very well and all was fresh and juicy on my visit. All the pans were well maintained.

Our plates were cleared quickly and the owner was engaging.

The food really was very good and the word is already out because the place filled up fast and people were waiting for our seats.

This was an unusually good buffet experience. 

I will have to try the menu items for dinner sometime.

Great Value dining! 

Lots of potential here!

A gem for Indian Food in this part of town!"}
{"text":"Best Indian food in town. The family and I went there for the buffet and we were more than impressed with the food. The deserts had unique flavor and were very light and yummy. We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Very good vegetarian food, ordered Kothuparta .. very unique dish and Malabar Parotta with Korma"}
{"text":"Not good. Really not good. Edible food, but definitely not real Indian cuisine. If you are thinking of getting Indian food from here, about mission!!!"}
{"text":"This place is new and great!!!  I ordered online for pick up.   I didn't realize there is another store on E Bell Rd.,my online order accidentally went there.   Surprise store called got my order and had it ready to go within 15 minutes.   Won me over with their great service and delicious food!"}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken curry. It was quite good. I also ordered the garlic nan bread ...Again delicious..
Tomorrow I will return for their buffet. It's only $8.99 all you can eat and many varieties of food. We finally have a  good Indian restaurant here in Surprise. The staff is very friendly. And I did not have to wait very long for my food."}
{"text":"Was very disappointed with this place. The reviews were great and I didn't think it lived up to them. I had been craving curry for weeks and this place didn't hit the mark. 
It was packed when we got here so we figured that was a good sign but no. Some of the food was mismatched temperatures. There was some good flavor in some of the dishes but nothing that wowed me. We waited for almost 15 minutes for our naan and dosa. It seemed as though the waitress paid more attention to other guest then us which was very disappointing. 
Place was very hectic and not run well. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Haldi Indian Cuisine was fantastic. We have lived in surprise for 12 years and have been waiting for places like this to open that aren't the standard chain restaurants.... Glad Haldi is in town and will definitely be back. Try the buffet... you get so much variety for a great price."}
{"text":"Just went for the first time today and loved it! The food was fresh and excellent. The staff was really nice. It was the best Indian food I have had here in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service.  So so flavorful!!! Very reasonably priced with good portion size.  Highly recommend this restaurant!!!!"}
{"text":"The customer service is the worst. We liked the restaurant food very much and was placing orders every week at least 7 to 8 times now. But then recently we went to pickup food we ordered and we gave them the 10% coupon they gave us 2 months back in a movie theatre. And the reaction of the cashier made us go crazy. He immediately changed his face and told the person near by that they should have made those coupons with an expiry date. We are like \"What the hell! really! Are we here begging for discounts\". Instead they would have told us politely that they have stopped accepting coupons. 
That is when we decided this is the last time we get food from the restaurant."}
{"text":"Best Indian food around!!! It's on the spicy side so be prepared to drink lots of water after!! But worth the burn!! It's hard to find good Indian food but my fiancé and I go here at least once a week on sundays for their buffet and it's delicious. Not too expensive either. You'll be in shock how many buffet options they have and every week they switch up the options. Good place! And service is great!"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch buffet. Extremely disappointed. There were only 4 non vegetarian items. Lots of vegetarian dishes but as I prefer to have non veg I was very disappointed with the number of items. Mango custard in the dessert section was not so good. Had high hopes about the restaurant by seeing the interior and everything but I was very dissatisfied."}
{"text":"I really liked all of the food at the lunch buffet. They had a black pepper shrimp dish I have never seen at any Indian place. It was awesome and had a good kick. Service is great. I will be going back."}
{"text":"Cave with a small group of friends and we all agree the food was amazing!! Excellent service I'm sorry we didn't get to take pictures the dishes were so good we started right end. I highly recommend this place  I shall return"}
{"text":"If your vegan I highly suggest this lunch buffet(also has meat options). They have many great options that are prepared so good you will forget all about the things you don't eat anymore, that you may find yourself missing at times. As a person who has been vegan for a few years I find myself looking for exciting food options and this is where I go whenever I find myself with an urge for some amazing food."}
{"text":"Awesome food. Tried both a la carte and their weekend buffet. Very authentic Indian food. 

Good options for vegetarians. 

Their Sambar Vada is a must have. 

Very friendly staff as well."}
{"text":"Came here because it was close to the house. They were not very busy yet, but right away a great smell greeted us. The waiters were very friendly, and the menu has a lot of selections. The food was very flavorful and the breadbasket helped us discover different types of naan. The samosas were tasty and had just the right amount of spice. Would highly recommend his place."}
{"text":"We ordered a Masala Dosa, Garlic nan and a Malai kofta. The dosa was not upto the mark. The Nan and the Malai Kofta were okay, but nothing great. There are many other better Indian restaurants in Phoenix.
I wouldn't recommend this restaurant unless it's an apocalypse and this is the only place left to eat."}
{"text":"Awesome place to try Indian dishes! Raj is an amazing host. GrubHubbed here twice and finally got to see the buffet and take some goodies home. I now know what \"dosa\" is and I am very pleased with the selection and freshness of the buffet items. Not exactly sure if I can remember the names of everything but my favorite is the butter chicken and the chickpea dish. Must try"}
{"text":"We just had an amazing lunch with the friendly people at Haldi! The food was flavorful, there was plenty of variety, and the service was excellent. We will certainly be back!"}
{"text":"Literally the best customer service I have ever experienced in any capacity.  Not to mention the best Indian food I have ever had.  Flavorful, bold flavors and they take the time to understand your personal flavor profile to help guide you to dishes that pair with your taste.  Man did he knock it out of the park.  I will be going back weekly until I try the entire menu!"}
{"text":"My husband and 2 dear friends just returned from a delicious meal at Haldi! Delightful service and a full explanation of the extensive menu. We hail from Connecticut where we have many excellent Indian restaurants and Haldi, by far, is as good, if not better, than the best in our state.

We enjoyed an enormous dosa with various sauces, shrimp curry, tandoor mixed grill, lamb rogan josh and shrimp saag. And garlic naan with a complimentary order in addition. Each dish was seasoned perfectly, all unique and delicious. 

Our only recommendation is for the restaurant to consider some interior decorating. The walls are bare and lighting is industrial. But with some simple, colorful embellishments Haldi will be rated a 10 plus! Run, don't walk to Haldi"}
{"text":"First time eating Indian food and it was a great experience. Food was fresh and owner was very friendly"}
{"text":"This is the best Indian food I've had in Phoenix, hands down, and I've eaten at probably half of the ones in the valley. Best buffet, best dosai, best payasam, best, best, best.  I am just sad I only discovered it right before moving out of the state.  This place is a real gem and worth the wait at lunch, even though there is line.   Sitting here gorging myself at this very moment and felt I should tell everyone before I forgot. Awesome."}
{"text":"When I learned that an Indian restaurant was opening in Surprise, I was delighted. There are several good restaurants in Tempe and Mesa, but I wanted a place that was local. Unfortunately, this place was a huge disappointment. This review is for the buffet. I prefer buffets because most Indian meals come with a lot of starch, and my diet consists of mainly meats and vegetables. I should also mention that I'm allergic to dairy, so avoid the Indian selections made with cream.

My dining companion and I went to the luncheon buffet on Monday, June 11th.

First, the PROS. Haldi is one of the few Indian restaurants that serves some form of protein besides chicken in its buffet. They offered not only goat, but also lamb. I only eat organic or pastured chicken, as commercially raised chicken is loaded with antibiotics. But it's cheap, so Indian restaurants that offer buffets usually serve chicken and ONLY chicken. So I'm grateful that these options were offered, as lamb and goat are cleaner than chicken.

Both meats were somewhat stringy. However, the sauce accompanying the lamb was surprisingly flavorful. This was the best part of the meal.

Now, the CONS (and there are a lot of them). There was only once non-starchy vegetable, and that was spinach with chick peas in a cream sauce. I had to pass on that. The goat was prepared as a Biryani dish, which is rice. I ate some rice because there weren't many other options. Well, the rice was frankly awful. The overpowering spice in this one-dimensional dish was hot pepper, with none of the fragrant spices such as cardomom, cinnamon and fenugreek that are supposed to give Biryani dishes their complexity. The biggest (unpleasant) surprise was the rice, which had none of the natural nutty, flowery fragrance that's characteristic of Basmati rice--a staple in Indian cooking. (In fact, Basmati rice is used in the Far East to heal the gut, due to its special properties.) This rice was dried out and utterly lacking in flavor. I suspect that Haldi either used Uncle Ben's, or such an inferior grade of Basmati (yes, there are grades of this rice) that it simply wasn't worth eating.

My dining companion had two of the chicken dishes. His assessment: they were drab and not worth eating. Even the nan (which he has had many times before in other restaurants) was not to his liking.

Ordering off the regular menu may yield a better selection of better prepared foods. On a different note, this small place has the ambiance (without decorations) of a fast food joint. The decor is cheap, which also makes the food seem cheap. I respect that the owner has put time, effort and energy into this place, and I like to support small businesses. But I can't help wondering: If the place is made nicer, will respect for the food follow? 

Residents of Surprise have yet to find a nearby Indian restaurant that's worth eating at."}
{"text":"We love the Monday night buffet! The staff is always welcoming and the food is delicious. They offer a great variety on the buffet. 
We also order via Grubhub. A couple times a Naan has been missing but they make up for it by either refund or offering it free the next time!
This is our favorite Indian restraraunt that is within 5 miles of us :)"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Indian buffet in Phoenix and this is coming from a real Indian! The selection is excellent with an unreal amount of desserts and drinks (classy touch adding chai to drink) plus you get fresh naan and dosa....yummy!

What I really Love about this restaurant is the excellent prompt service you receive. The owner always ask his everything is and always makes sure you leave happy."}
{"text":"Staff are truly friendly and always serving with a smile. 
Rather generous with the varieties of food served for weekday lunch buffet which is only UsD 10 per person. 
Was told by the waiter that they have special buffet on Fri, Sat and Sunday . Will check them out soon."}
{"text":"Very nice food, kottu porotta was awesome. Served in banana leaf which is tasty and healthy. Other valley restaurants should learn from them and start using banana leaf instead of bad plastics. But biriyani is pretty bad, tastes bad."}
{"text":"Idk what any of this stuff is, but I'm gonna give this review a shot. The orange stuff was amazing. They had these bright red fried baby corn nuggets and I ate like 40 of them. I was stuffing my face with my second plate of rice covered in the orange stuff with chicken, and the orange stuff with cheese when an employee comes over and hooks me up with this flat bread stuff, showing me a whole new world, shimmering, shining, and splendid, as I used it to shovel everything into my face. Finished it off with dessert goop stuff. I'm gonna be coming here like once a week."}
{"text":"The buffet is delicious, the atmosphere warm & friendly. Always a great experience. 
We love to eat in ethnic restaurants where many languages are spoken. 
We have eaten here many times and the food is consistently great, the staff are courteous and helpful."}
{"text":"Good and service are excellent. We haven't tried the buffet yet but look forward to it."}
{"text":"When we moved here from L.A. 8 years ago, we struggled in vain to find an Indian restaurant that would be our new go-to option. But as my hubby liked to say, Phoenix had either cheap, but not good, or good but not cheap. 
Haldi is a gem! We enjoyed delicious food, with delightful service and their generous portions were priced very reasonably.  This, at last, is our new Indian restaurant of choice.  Casual setting (the money you pay clearly goes into the food, rather than the ambiance), but you'll be welcomed as an immediate newfound friend.
Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I discovered Haldi, which is out of my usual drive path, via Grubhub, and have ordered from the restaurant several times.  The food is never a disappointment.  I've enjoy using Grubhub to explore Indian food, because, before ordering, I can Google all the different dishes to learn about them, and then try something new every time.  I've expanded my knowledge of Indian cooking this way, and because the food has always been delicious, I get braver and braver. I do wish that Haldi would give more information on its Grubhub menu about its dishes.  For example, I really want to try the Malabar Fish Curry, but some of the online recipes call for sardines, while others use a white fish, and I wish I knew what fish they were using.  Similarly, I would like to know what fish is used for Apollo Fish. And, is the meat Hallal?  Assuming not, but they don't say. 
NOTE: I've never actually been into the restaurant, so this review is strictly about the food.  It's delicious."}
{"text":"LEGIT. INDIAN. FOOD.

We went for the buffet but will be back for dinner for sure.

What makes this buffet different from others?  Most places just give you naan and have one or two chutneys for you.  This place?  Butter naan, plus 6 different dips/chutneys, plus made-to-order dosas masala.  Dosas are crisp pancakes made of lentil and rice flour. They brush them with butter and then fill them with a masala filling of potatoes, cabbage and spices.  YUM!

Moving onto the buffet: Two different kinds of biryani: a vegetarian one that was flavored with tamarind and a meat one (goat).  Real, authentic biryani is nicely spiced, with little crispier pieces of rice and softer ones.  Clearly made from scratch.

There was a salad bar to start, some fritters in yogurt and there were several appetizer items.

For meats/eggs: they had chicken curry, butter chicken, a curried egg dish, the goat biryani, and one other I didn't try.

For veggies/paneer: they had a peas and cauliflower dish, manchurian eggplant, daal curry, two veggie soups, paneer tikka masala, the tamarind biryani, a potato dish and some others I can't remember.

For dessert: they had a mango custard, a warm semolina dish with raisins and nuts, and a mango and condensed milk cake.  They also had hot chai and cups at the buffet.

Everything was excellently spiced and I'm excited to return for dinner.  The only thing I'd change is that my water sat empty for quite a while.  That said, I never asked for a refill, so now I know to ask.

Solid job.  Easily the best non-vegetarian indian place in the Phoenix metro area.  And the lunch buffet was only $10!"}
{"text":"Interesting combination of northern and southern Indian dishes. Extensive buffet and both doss and naan come with it along with friendly advice on how to eat them and pairings. I judge these places by the ratio of Asians to whites and this places had many more ethnic Indians."}
{"text":"This place is amazing the food was delicious. We started with an appetizer of Chicken Manchurin which was so so delicious has a slight sweet red chili sauce that is deep fried to perfection great seasoning. 

My wife's dinner  consisted of Chicken Palak dish with a garlic spinach base , wow wow wow it was so good paired with the garlic naan and basmati rice. 

My dinner was Chicken Tikkia Masala and the sauce was so creamy and rich with flavor, paired that with some more garlic naan and basmati rice that was so light and fluffy. 

We seriously were stuffed and couldn't eat it all , going to be a great lunch tomorrow. We will definitely go back and try the lunch buffet , if today is any indication of what's on the buffet then it's going to be amazing."}
{"text":"Some of the best Indian Food I've had in AZ! 

This place is a little off the beaten path and without Yelp, I may never have found this gem. But I'm so glad I did!! 

Amazing delicious food to be found at this buffet style Indian restaurant. Dosa and naan at the tables for you and a very attentive friendly wait staff! 

Definitely coming back again :)"}
{"text":"This was a nice Indian buffet, the food was very good. I was pleasantly surprised at the lunch buffet price of $10 for the whole thing! The staff was friendly, but one waiter continued to interrupt almost to the point where I was trying to ignore him altogether. Other than that I would recommend this place for a quick and affordable lunch."}
{"text":"Great Indian food, nice interior, and good prices. Not as good as daawaat Indian cuisine but much nicer place and interior restrant"}
{"text":"This place provides lunch buffet, dinner and catering services - we experienced all three.
==Lunch Buffet==
We've been to this place for lunch 3-4 times. First time we're very happy with variety of items and taste. However, non veg items were \"ok\" compared to veg items. In my last visit non-veg items were also tasty.
==Dinner==
Everything was very good. Their dosas are top class and non-veg items are perfect! You can try different rava dosas.
==Catering==
We ordered food in bulk for party of nearly 50 people recently. They offered good quantity for price and each item was great. Goat biriyani was moist, flavorful and perfect.
In general, not only food quality their service is good as well. Whatever your reason of visit is, they're very attentive and prompt.
So may be each item in their buffet menu is not the best, but this restaurant deserves a 5 star for its overall perfection."}
{"text":"Man, I would have given this place a 5 star even before trying the food. My husband and I wanted to try this new place, and as soon as we walked in we were met with the biggest kindest smile! Our waiter was so friendly and took the time to really answer all our questions, and offer some recommendations based off what we like. We ordered what he recommended, and it was all amazing. Something I never thought I'd say is, I can't wait to come back and try the buffet!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been here about 6 times since they opened. Although we've only had the buffet I'm sure the menu dishes are just as good. The staff is very friendly, the food is great and we always leave complete satisfied. I look forward to many more dining experiences at Haldi."}
{"text":"My husband and I have ordered takeout from Haldi several times now. We usually order on a Saturday or Sunday off the menu rather than going in for the buffet as we want plenty of leftovers. We always get goat biryani, palak paneer, okra pulusu, chicken tikka masala, vegetable pakora, vegetable samosas, and garlic naan. The food quality is fairly consistent and the taste is always good. My only negative would be that every single time we've ordered takeout they tell us to pick food up in an hour because they are always so busy with the buffet. When we get there we have ended up waiting 25-45 minutes longer each time. But hey there's always the buffet!"}
{"text":"So far a good Indian restaurant in the area. Have tried different places around  for a proper indian food, was never satisfied. This is new in the area and has become my goto restaurant. Buffet has more varieties for veg. Their alacarte is better than buffet. Quantity is  more for the curries. Hopefully they'll keep the same quality coming days."}
{"text":"My new favorite Indian buffet in the Valley. I overheard a gal talking about how wonderful the lunch buffet here was so I had to come check it out! Not disappointed! I hit up the vegetarian side and my belly is full and happy. The staff is super friendly and I always feel welcomed. So happy to have found this place:)!"}
{"text":"We've been waiting for this place to open! Very happy an Indian restaurant has opened here in Surprise!

A friendly member of the staff greeted us at the door, led us to our table, brought water, and guided us to the buffet, which had several meat and vegetarian dishes. All of the dishes the wife and I tried were delicious and not overly spicy...but just right, IMO! The \"Butter Chicken,\" for example, was perfect! Of course, everyone's tastes may be different, but if you have never had Indian food, or have a sensitive palate, then perhaps it'd be best for you to come during evening hours when normal dinner entrees are served. Only then can you specify your level of spiciness.

Glad we stopped in today for lunch. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great new spot! We missed the lunch buffet, but will definitely be going back to try more dishes. For dinner I had the boneless chicken Biryani. So flavorful and spicy but not too much that you couldn't enjoy the flavors. My friends had the goat curry and chicken mango chutney curry. We all shared of course,  the mango sauce was amazing. The goat curry was very flavorful. We also had the Naan, we each tried a different selection, plain, butter, and garlic, all were great."}
{"text":"I can't say much about the food, because I am not an Indian food expert.  It was good and I enjoyed it, but that's about all I know.  The problem was with the service and replenishment of the buffet.  Let me preface by saying they are very nice and they were extremely busy, with a wait, but that's no excuse for running out of plates, silverware, food, etc.  We waited almost 20 minutes for the bread to arrive and there was an extended line up at the buffet that kept building, because there were no plates for quite some time.  Seemed very unorganized, to say the least.  Wouldn't rush back, but it's certainly a friendly place with decent food and reasonable prices.  They just need to up their game on service and upkeep of the buffet."}
{"text":"Great food. Very similar to what I had in India. Funny attentive staff. Several people stopped by to make sure we enjoyed our food and had little jokes sprinkled in the banter. Their concern about the spicy level was endearing. 

The food. My only only complaint was the pakoras were a little soft. They didn't have that just fried crunch I love. Flavor was the redeeming factor. They were still good despite the not so freshness. 

Everything else was spot on. Great naan, butter paneer, chicken vindaloo, all good. We enjoyed every bite. In fact, I think there's a little left in the fridge. Gotta run..."}
{"text":"A little surprised with how high the ratings are for this establishment.  We came in around 1 on. Sunday afternoon and the restaurant was busy!  They had so many food options, wish they would stick to less options and work on service and quality.

We asked for naan and asked again and asked again.   We noticed another family who came in after us were served naan right away.  While again we were waiting...  they apologized but by the time we received our naan, we were finished eating.  I wouldn't recommended it.  Plus, the amount she f fly sticky traps hanging from the ceiling is a little offputting and not sure why they had such a bad fly problem.  Maybe it was an off day but nothing impressed me about this place."}
{"text":"We visited on Monday, May 1.  The minute we sat down both my daughter and I began to cough from the smell of spices - should have guessed that we were in for some herbal heat.   The lunch buffet was well stocked with all kinds of varieties of food except for the salad offerings...some wilted mixture of greens, tiny amounts of red onions, cucumber, tomato, etc. (granted we went for Indian food and salad isn't really Indian food!).  The taste of all the hot items was acceptable but the heat index of everything offered was overwhelming.  All of their dishes were entirely too spicy.  Table service was good as far as dirty dish clean up but they literally have only two beverages to offer - water and diet Coke.  And not bottled water-TAP WATER and no ice!!!   Waiters were not friendly or even welcoming to be honest.  Lunch buffet costs about $10 which is decent.  Probably will not return though because I prefer to be treated like a paying customer by people who appreciate the business."}
{"text":"The restaurant is pretty simple but the food was so amazing. See this is the new Indian restaurant in Phoenix area and I was so happy that I experience the wonderful food. Lots and lots and lots of food for the price that you pay. Highly recommend this place for anyone who likes to eat the good food for a small amount of bill."}
{"text":"The whole buffet was good and had a variety of items.  The butter chicken, chicken curry, tandoori chicken and goat biryani were standout."}
{"text":"Food was ok. Expensive buffet and limited vegetarian options on weekend mother's day special buffet. Ambience not good."}
{"text":"Food was very delicious! I can't handle too much hot spice or dishes that have too much flavor/spices, so I ordered the mango curry, which is on the sweeter side. I had it with Raita and basmati rice---mmmm! It was so good! Everything was made fresh, especially the garlic naan."}
{"text":"Tried the Surprise location last night. You have to really TRY to make Indian food bland, but this place did it. It was like a 3mo old caucasian baby was back there cooking. Unseasoned rice, and the \"medium\" spice was like drinking water. The dishes don't taste like they're made individually, like nothing has been marinated, just pieces of precut veggies or meat heated up in already-made sauce, all of which was way too runny. How do you even screw up raita? No cilantro?! RED ONION? YELLO ONION?? WTF?? For something so full of too many ingredients that don't even belong in raita (seriously, raita should not be chunky), it tasted like red onion-flavored milk. If I hadn't seen the cucumber, I wouldn't have even know it was there. The naan was very good though. We got the bread basket. 

Also, the kid didn't give us half our order and we had to go back. He said, \"I thought it was a different order because that looks like a lot of food.\" Darling, you work at  a restaurant. Don't ever tell a patron it looks like they ordered too much food, especially if your restaurant has a buffet, especially if it's an Indian buffet. 

If you're looking for authentic, flavorful Indian, this isn't the place. If you're looking for something to satisfy your Indian fix in a pinch, it'll do. It's not bad, I mean, I'll go back eventually, but it just could really use a little love in the kitchen."}
{"text":"Fantastic selection and friendly service. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Exceptional food but didn't come for the decor, it's fine just a little dated. Back to the food we had the chicken korma and chicken tiki Marsala. The chicken in the tiki Marsala was different I think it was tandoori chicken they used which I'm not a fan of but my boyfriend loved it. The korma was my favorite, I asked for a medium spice which was just right. Had garlic nan bread that wasn't as fluffy as I'm used to but just as good. You get a good amount which is great for leftovers. The rice was fluffy which was perfection. This place does not have their liquor license yet so had an ice tea that was watered down. They were busy as they do a lot of pick ups and delivery. Service was good and friendly."}

{"text":"Ok so I love Indian food and we have shown up here several times but never makes the hours. As a result I was skeptical and it had the hole in the wall feel to it. I was being kind of a jerk with my lack of face filter but hands down this is the best Indian Food we have ever had. My brother is in a Hindi group and taken me to several places thinking I would love it as I do love InDian food, out of know where this place is so amazing. Will definitely be ordering and returning."}
{"text":"Extremely impressed by Haldi. I have now tried the lunch buffet and take out for dinner both of which were fantastic. The lamb saag was so flavorful and the best saag I've ever had. We also had the chicken Tikka and the dosa and both were equally as good. I highly recommend Haldi and I've tried a lot of Indian spots around the world."}
{"text":"The weekday buffet serves stale food. Heated and probably reheated multiple times. Definitely a no ...!!!"}
{"text":"I've only ordered delivery from here, but the food has been pretty good every time, if you know what to get. Some of the dishes aren't that great - I don't like the biryani here. However, the palak chicken is very good. The chicken kabobs, both the tikka and mint versions are also very generously portioned. My one major qualm is that they use styrofoam packaging and flimsy plastic sauce containers which leak very easily, so it's not the best for takeout orders. We have had a few messes with larger orders spilling here and there during transport. Other than that, I do like getting that palak chicken pretty often. For now, I'll leave this review, but will update if I make it to the lunch buffet."}
{"text":"Our first visit to Haldi Indian Cuisine and how great it is!  The expansive lunch buffet takes one whole wall of the restaurant and has plentiful options from the standards of butter chicken and saag paneer to menu items I haven't seen before, can't pronounce or spell; and all were wonderfully prepared and delicious to eat.  The service was friendly, fresh bread is brought to the table while you prepare your plate and drinks were refilled as needed.  The food was moderately spicy and full flavored.  We are already planning our next Indian adventure."}
{"text":"Not the most eloquent dining spot but as far as the quality of the food it exceptional, it's  cooked fresh in front of you and the prices are definitely reasonable. I give it five stars because of the food I I do wish that it was a little nicer inside because it would be a great place to take friends or date for lunch or dinner at this point is a great place for carry out ."}
{"text":"So if you are not familiar with Indian food and have no idea what it taste like you will absolutely fall in love with this place. But if have a slightest, a sliver of idea how Indian food should taste then you will absolutely hate this place and will never ever go back. With that said as you can tell by my name I am knee deep familiar with this kind of food I will never ever ever ever ever go back to this restaurant. To sum it all up the food was really bland and tasteless even though I ordered extra spicy when I was asked by our waiter what level of spicy ness I like. I literally washed down my mix grill Platter with lots and lots of Diet Coke and nan. One last note to the owners please do not put dishes on your menu that you never serve, this was my second time (1st time I only called to ask) that I asked for pomfret fish and I was told they don't have. 
Glad I can check another restaurant in the valley that I will never go back to"}
{"text":"Great new place with great buffet items. Some time coming since other places have kinda fallen off the map in popularity not being able to stand the 'test of time', so to speak. Oh there are others that have succeeded but only have either North or South Indian fare.
A friend brought this place to my attention and I went in yesterday for the buffet. Surprisingly good selection on the buffet. They included both North and South Indian which is quite a rarity. So now that makes for a wider selection and they're all authentic and very tasty.
These guys have only been open a month but based additionally on the strength of their Indian clientele and a few others, this place is over the top.
If they continue to impress with the food, service and ambience and keep their prices in check I'll probably give them the Sun & Moon to add to the stars.
I highly recommend but if you cant take the spicy hot, remember to ask for mild or very mild.
The buffet was reasonably mild and very tasty indeed. I recommend it to anyone even the newbies. You won't be disappointed and yes it's to'kill for' not the other way around. You'll want to come back and try it again, and again.    Good feedback will help them stick around a long time. They are worth my praise!        Cheers! and happy eating."}
{"text":"Of course I was their 1st customer ever!

The service and food were perfect. We are very lucky to have Haldi in Surprise! Let's keep them in business. 

Coming soon to this location: my framed $2 bill."}
