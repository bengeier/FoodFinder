{"text":"Great \"Q\". You will definitely like the pulled pork sandwich but be prepared to take a nap afterwards. Great smokey flavor!! No beer though at least in Monroe and that would really make this place sing as they have a bar for it."}
{"text":"Hands down the best ribs I've ever had!!  Fall off the bone good.  5 stars on food quality alone.  Aside from the food, there isn't much to say about the place since it's primarily a take out spot."}
{"text":"This place is well hidden in Matthews. You could easily drive by the building where it's located without ever knowing it even existed. I think that's what makes it all the more special. Their BBQ pulled pork is just juicy and flavorful. There aren't really any seating save the two outside the restaurant. I believe you get a choice of Lay's chips and a drink with your order if you get a combo. I like Lays chips  because it's the type gets stuck in my teeth after I chew it, and I can taste the chips for the remainder of the day. All I have to do is lick the back corners of my mouth and I get a taste of salt and vinegar. That's worth the money in of itself. Their home made sauce is also exceptional. Priced at $7-8 dollars, it's a good deal for such scrumptiousness. I would highly recommend.

update 9/23/11: Apparently this restaurant has closed, *tear."}
{"text":"We just moved here from TX but we grew up in TN. So we were looking for some PIG (hard to get anything but beef in TX). I read the other reviews posted here & decided to give it a try. GREAT!!! We went to the Sunday buffet and it was so good. Can't wait to go back again. YUM!!! Enjoyed the chicken & the pork. I haven't acquired a taste for the NC red slaw but enjoyed the mac n cheese. And the nanner pudding!"}
{"text":"Tonight I joined \"the Law\" at Outlaw for Dinner

From eating at the old location in Matthews I knew this was going to be good - I was so confident in the Awesomeness of this food I had a Full meal right before eating here!!!  Finding the platter option with a small customization I anticipated what i knew and what I would taste for the first time.  This Monroe and only location (now) has tables and a bar so I could sit and eat somewhere other than my car!  My platter was:  Small Brunswick Stew, Pulled Pork BBQ (I did not eat the bun) and St. Louis Cut Ribs.  This was my first time at this location and my first time ever having St. Louis Cut Ribs!  The Owner was there running the front and he makes two Excellent BBQ Sauces, Both mild and similar, though one s more of a vinegar base and the other is more tomato base (do I detect White Peppercorns or a blend of Peppercorns in this sauce).  This is some of the best if not the best:  Pork BBQ and Ribs, Sauce and Stew I have ever had!!!  Friendly Service, Awesome Food  Everything was Sensational!!!  Even the \"Law\" loves Outlaw! See my Photos and you'll see what I mean!"}
{"text":"They know what they're doing. What else can I say? The place is hard to find and the presentation is a styrofoam carton, but the BBQ food is great. The beef brisket sandwich or ribs have become a weekly dinner for myself. The pulled pork is very good, but the beef is so much better. It's more of a wet Memphis style (KC?) than Carolina BBQ. The smokiness of the chicken is very good, but it is lacking in presentation.

They also opened a store in Monroe that has dine-in and a buffet on Sundays.

I want to give them five stars, but they never have mac-n-cheese here."}
{"text":"The business is closed-shutdown-empty ! I don't know why it still appears on this site."}
{"text":"As happy as a pig in...well, you know.

Referring to me. And my visit to what has got to be the best place around Charlotte to get that Eastern Carolina style barbecue....The destination for and culmination of my NC quest to find the best. And it was a bit of a search, as this has moved from the old Matthews location mentioned in all the previous reviews. (Now closed, so make sure you take Hwy 74 over to Monroe.)

The pork? Smoky. Moist. Full of little blackened bits of smoked edges, and pink meaty strands of deliciousness. Deeply flavorful, tongue-tender. Perfect.

The sauce? Tangy. Garlicky. (And if you like Memphis style, they offer that too, so you don't have to be a Carolina aficionado to enjoy your visit here. It's a great version: not too heavy or sweet, which makes it actually tasty to combine with the vinegar sauce.) Plenty of, right there on the table for you.

The pulled pork dinner? Bun? Check. Two sides? Check. Which would be, for me....Red (vinegar-based, or if you MUST you can order white, mayo-based) slaw? Check. Smoky baked beans? Check. Mound of perfect pork (see above)? Check. Combine. Savor. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Holy God....

And you can sit inside, or outside on the covered porch. 

My man knew I was in another realm when I was double-fisting it: a bite of pulled pork sandwich in one hand, and a forkful of pork, beans, and slaw in the other, barely stopping to breathe this was so damn good.

Smiling, smiling even still. It's not often that a food search with no determinate end finds a blissfully definitive one...."}
{"text":"Okay, so I am a chick and not a BBQ pro, so I am afraid my review will not be as detailed as the previous two. 

My hubby really really really enjoyed his pulled pork sandwich... so much in fact he updated his facebook status message to state that fact, which is impressive in itself. 

We ordered the junior pack which comes with a half rack of ribs, 1lb BBQ (pulled pork), sauce, 2 sides, and buns for $20. Hubby got the baked beans and cole slaw as the sides. I am low carbin' so I did not partake in the sides, but we would have been fighting over the sides if I had, so it would be best to order additional sides or upgrade to large size if more than one person will be eating the sides. 

Overall we were impressed. I think the BBQ (pulled pork) was the best of all, the ribs were good, but too much for me to eat alone. Maybe when I have someone else around that wants to share the ribs, then I will order them. Hubby doesn't eat them, so I am afraid they will go to waste if I order them alone (not much of a reheat the ribs kind of girl). They are VERY meaty and fall off the bone tender, so I do recommend them if you are a rib lover! 

Man, I wish I wasn't low carbin' so I could have tried that banana pudding. 

Will return again when the BBQ craving comes around!"}
{"text":"Plenty of people in the area will tell you that Mac's has the best barbecue in Charlotte - perhaps because they were associated with the Super bowl, perhaps not.  Others may think it is is McKoy's.  Some, Bubba's.  A few might mention Spoon's.  Then you get even get a few who suggest Outlaw as a contender.

I would have likely agreed via my own personal sampling (generally restricted to food trucks), but the drive to Monroe does dampen the mood a bit.  This is offset by the friendly and speedy service you receive.  The only downside we encountered is that they do not offer free refills on sodas.  That is not a killer - it is just one of those things you do not expect to see these days!

What I found really interesting is that the barbecue served up in the food trucks is really better than what you get at the actual restaurant.  It is not that the restaurant is bad, just that the food truck is better.  It could also be that the sides (found only in the restaurant) were not that good, so that downplayed the meat itself.

There are also some people who have mentioned that Outlaw has moved to Monroe.  This is not the case.  They have been in Monroe longer than Matthews - they merely consolidated the operations because it was simpler to do so!"}
{"text":"We found out about this little place a few weeks ago and have already ordered from there on three occasions.   Definitely designed for carry out - this joint serves competition quality barbecue.   The ribs are meaty and flavorful with a great smoked flavor.  Both the pulled pork and the brisket are fabulous as well.  We order a family pack for the ribs, then make pulled pork sandwiches for lunch the next day.

While we enjoy going to Mac's Speed shop - for straight up quality and taste of the ribs and brisket, I have to give the edge to Outlaw. (Personal Opinion :-)

Order early in the day - especially around the weekend or a holiday."}
{"text":"I drove down to Monroe to try out the Outlaw BBQ's Sunday Buffet.  I found out about it when I visited Outlaw's place in Matthews.  I wish I had know about this sooner!  I got there around 1 pm and the place was packed.  Luckily a couple gave me their table as they we ready to leave.  It's not really a buffet, but for $10 it doesn't matter.  You pay first and they included a drink which I think is included in the $10.  The buffet is set up on their small bar area. Restaurant employees serve you on disposable foam plates.  Nothing wrong with that in my book as long as the food is good and it was. For BBQ meat had pulled pork & brisket, chicken legs & thighs, chicken breast nuggets and rib tips.  I sampled each one, some more than once.  The pork was tender and moist with a subtle smokey flavor.  It needed no sauce at all, but they offer a standard tomato sauce or a thin vinegar based sauce.  In my previous visit to Outlaw in Matthews I mixed the two and here I did the same.  The brisket was pulled rather than being sliced, but that didn't matter.  It also had a great smokey flavor and was very moist.  I prefer slices, but it is hard to keep them moist while serving them buffet style.  The chicken thighs and drums were also smoked with a nice flavor.  They had no sauce on them which was nice as some places drown their chicken in sauce.  The chicken breast was cut up and deep fried.  It was also very good.  The rib tips pretty tender, but I thought they could use a little more cooking to make the a little more tender.  Their flavor was great and they were very moist.  For sides they had baked beans, macaroni and cheese, coleslaw (regular and spicy) and some salad.  The baked beans were nothing special, not like the one I got at my last visit to their place in Matthews.  That was the only disappointment I had.  The mac & cheese was OK, not as good as mom used to make, but I didn't go there for mac & cheese.  The coleslaw was a vinegar based slaw that was diced rather than shredded.  The had regular slaw and spicy.  I tried the spicy alone and with some pork.  It was very good.  They also had banana pudding for dessert.  Overall I would very highly recommend that you visit the Outlaw BBQ Shack.  If you are looking for fancy, go somewhere else.  If you are looking for some of the best BBQ in the Charlotte area then you better try Outlaw BBQ."}
{"text":"Nice BBQ place in Mathews , NC. It is hidden behind another restaurant. It is attached in the back. I can't say the signage is that good to find it but it is worth it. I have used them for a large pick up order before and stopped in for the lunch time brown bag special. 

The brown bag special will fill you up and the meat is quality. You can choose between several sauces so pick your pleasure. They heap on the meat and it is slightly smokey but holds the moisture well.

The ribs are above average (I got them for a gathering) they where somewhat expensive but quality. They did not fall off the bone and a few were kinda tough but they served the purpose and the pulled pork made up for it.

They do not have seats inside the store it is only pickup so plan accordingly."}
{"text":"Stopped here on a Saturday afternoon.  Was fairly easy to spot the sign coming north on John from 485.

There were no customers there when I arrived.  Knowing ahead of time that they didn't have sweet tea, I brought my own and left it outside on the table as I went in to get my lunch.  I only ordered the pulled pork sandwich.  If I would have known they had hot sides now, I would have tried their mac n cheese.  Next time.

It took about four minutes to get my sandwich and I headed out to the table out front to eat.  In the bag they had included a little cup of their smokey sauce as well as a cup of their vinegar sauce.  I used them both together.  I don't know if it's kosher, but it tasted good to me!  The pork was probably THE most succulent pork I had ever tasted.  That pork just disintegrated in my mouth.  MMMM MMMM Tasty!

I'll definitely try this place out again, and next time I'll try the ribs and maybe some of that mac n cheese."}
