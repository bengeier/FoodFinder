{"text":"I love Indian food, and this is the only place we go. The place is small, but when you get in, you can really feel an authentic atmosphere. Usually, as two people, we ordered just some naan bread, a tub of butter chicken, and mixed vegetable bhaji. The butter chicken is creamy, spicy and amazing, the naan bread is just a little bit sweet, perfect to dip in the butter chicken sauce, and the vegetable bhaji are the perfect appetizer to top it all off. Great place! :)"}
{"text":"I am not an expert on Indian food. What I can say is this, the Naan bread was good. Palou rice not that good... A bit dry.. lamb curry and chicken kashmiri not too spicy... Price is below $40 for two ... A bit cold inside maybe due to open window in the kitchen ... Waiter is friendly .. A bit dark although we can in around noon time ... There is no smell of curry in our clothing after we left the restaurant ... 8 hrs after we had lunch ... I am still feeling bloated .... :((("}
{"text":"Excellent food. Always fresh. Have been going here for many years. Great lunch time specials! Take out is very good as well. Fast friendly service. Price is reasonable."}
{"text":"This has been my family's go-to Indian restaurant for 15 years. We've driven from as far as St-Lazare and it's worth it. The food is absolutely delicious. I made it a challenge to find better Indian and tried all over the city, from Boul. St-Laurent to Old Montreal to Parc Ex to NDG to the West Island. And nothing beats Star of India on Sherbrooke! The staff is wonderful, the space is cosy, but it's the food that's so exceptional. If you love butter chicken and naan as soft as a cloud, this is your place. Shrimp Bhuna and Shrimp Patia are also delicious. Newcastle and Cobra on tap!"}
{"text":"I have been eating at Star of India for 15 years and I have never had a poor experience. The gentlemen running the restaurant and delivering home orders are endlessly kind and dedicated. They smile and make you feel so so welcome. The chicken dhansak is my absolute favourite and their naan bread is heavenly. NDG is lucky to have this restaurant."}
{"text":"Very tasty chicken tikka masala and lamb daal.  Service needed a bit of work on a Saturday night but overall a good option for NDG."}
{"text":"Very dissapointing. We ordered the curry shrimp and paid over $13 for the dish and recieved only 5 shrimp! It was all sauce. Each of the dishes we ordered was bland, and the portion sizes on the meat dishes are terrible. Ganges is way better."}
{"text":"My favourite Indian resto in NDG. Go for the following: Butter Chicken, Dansak Beef, Naan bread, basmati rice and pekoras - you won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"I have to admit, I haven't ever set foot in this restaurant, but it is our go to place for takeout Indian food on a regular basis.  Consistently good and always arrives steaming hot, within 30-40 minutes of ordering.  Butter chicken and lamb curry are favorites.  Their naan bread is really good too."}
{"text":"I can't say enough great things about Star of India on Sherbrooke. The food is always tasty, the service is always excellent, and the atmosphere is always welcoming. My husband and I usually get madras chicken or beef, butter chicken, dhansak chicken or beef, and sometimes even vindaloo chicken. SPICEY AND AWESOME! The mulligatawny soup is perfect every time! I've never had a bad meal there. You will be very pleased with anything and everything you order at Star of India. Kabir, the owner is most often there and he is so friendly! I would give this restaurant 10 stars if I could."}
{"text":"Restaurant was very very busy with eat-in customers and take-out. There was only one person serving and we waited what seemed like forever to put in our order and get our food. Had the lamb curry and lamb tikka - tasted good when we ate it, but not so much later that night. Husband had upset stomach while I full on threw up and had cold shivers all night. Not a great way to start out on our honeymoon..."}
{"text":"Never back again. It was just a mess served on plates. Uncooked butter chicken, salad dress with most probably a ready made / bottled Italian sauce (kraft) and the worst part is the Puri bread. Discussing. Stay away"}
{"text":"We come to this restaurant pretty often when we're in Montreal, and we have feel welcomed every time we have come for lunch or dinner. The naan is extraordinary, and the beef and chicken dishes are delicious. We are big fans of their Chicken Tikka Masala, Vindaloo Chicken and Bhoona Ghost. We consider this small family-run restaurant the best Indian restaurant in Montreal for their good service, unassuming ambiance and excellent cost-quality."}
{"text":"The other night I had a crazy craving for Indian food, but didn't want to brave rush hour traffic to get to my usual hot spot in Jean Talon.   I passed by this place, as well as the Indian place next to it on NDG, and since I'm trying to be a bit more frugal this holiday season, opted for Étoile des Indes rather than the place next door, based completely on price.   We walked into a fairly busy restaurant at 630pm but still managed to get seated straight away.  Décor wise: Restaurant was not too brightly lit (that's a good thing), a few fake trees, interesting paintings (personally loved one of the frames) and it looked clean.  It's not a huge place and it wasn't noisy at all! I noticed how there were a lot of people that were getting take away (7 while we ate there, I know, I know, I'm OCD)  My friend and I ordered Samosas to start, Chicken Curry, Eggplant Bhaji, Pulao rice, and a Naan to share. The samosas were fresh, but not spicy in the slightest. It was missing coriander and cumin to it. We got the chutney to go with it, and the chutney was flavourful, but didn't seem to go with the Samosa. The pastry shell was definitely different from what I was used to. It was deep fried, that I can tell, and the pastry seemed freshly made too. Overall it was good. The Curry and Bhaji were not spicy either, and again, it tasted decent, but seemed to be missing certain spice elements. The rice was made well as was the Naan.   We got a complimentary dessert Motichoor Ladoo (sweet fried ball in syrup) but we were really disappointed when we found out the dessert menu they have was only offered in the downtown location. I noticed that they served Cobra Beer an IPA recently affiliated with Molson. Overall with a bit of leftovers, a hot tea tax and tip,  we spent a modest $40, not too shabby for not having to drive too far.   For me, it was no Maison Curry, but good enough for a tired night."}
{"text":"So far I've been there 4 times and always enjoyed my experience. Service was friendly and helpful with great suggestions when you ask. I did like that I was able to swap any option in there combo dinners, man places don't. If you like spicy dishes try the Bangalore Phai chicken. Naan was incredible and so were the Samosa. There is one Down town as well..both i would recommend."}
{"text":"By far the best Indian food I've had in Montreal! The samosas were to die for (loved the sauce) , the butter chicken tender and savoury, the tarka dal was delish and the Nan was fantastic. Service was fast, and everything was fresh. The only thing that was average was the salad, but you don't go to an Indian restaurant for salad. I would 100% recommend."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely great if you want to eat really tasty Indian food, and have some intimate dining.   Very tasty food, and reasonable prices for that. Though it is a tad on the intimate/pricey side.  If you just want to chow on tasty Indian, and not pay that extra, or really have wine etc, then go to Maison India next door. It's a more casual place."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place for years and it is ALWAYS great!! pakoras, samosas and onion bajee (sp?) are great - Nan is huge and super soft and buttery.  And I have tried almost all the mains and have never met one I didn't like a lot."}
{"text":"I'll admit it.  I (sadly) only tried REAL Indian Food for the first time, last night.  My friend was CRAVING Indian food for the past week or so and I always loved my tv dinner version of Butter Chicken and Rice (it was my go-to College/Uni meal; don't judge me).  Therefore, we went on a hunt for a good Indian place that delivers because we didn't want to stop our movie marathon.  So while I still haven't dined in the actual restaurant, I can still rate the food and delivery experience.    Star of India is located 2.4 km away from my house and is located at 5860 Sherbrooke Ouest.  The three of us ordered the \"CC\" deal which contains the Appetizer Platter, Butter Chicken, Bhoona Gosht, Chana Massalla, Palao Rice, Pappadum, Naan and Dessert for the price of $40.95.  When ordering, they were very helpful explaining the dishes and were very polite while offering suggestions.  It took them about an hour to deliver the food, and although we told them that the buzzer for the building wasn't working when we called and to call us, the delivery man still gave us a LOT of attitude when he arrived and couldn't get in the building.  Don't get me wrong, I understand, but I apologized numerous times and he persisted.   If we had known how long it would take, I would've waited downstairs however because it DID take so long, I am very glad I didn't.  ANYWAYS, the food was DELICIOUS.  My favorite was the butter chicken, which is not a surprise but move over  TV dinners!  The Bhoona Ghost was good, but I was surprised at how.. anti-climactic it was.  My mom has made dishes that have tasted exactly the same as that and she wasn't even making an Indian dish...   Part of the Appetizer Platter was the Onion Bhaji- it was delicious.  I was surprised at how much I enjoyed onions dipped in batter and deep fried.  The samosa was great and the sauce they give with it is delicious.  The Naan is also pretty great.  The rice was also very tasty!  I could eat numerous bowls of just the rice alone. The Chana Massalla was delicious too- definitely a great chickpea dish.  I am not big on desserts but I was told it tasted like pancakes with a TON of Maple Syrup.  Overall, Star of India will now be my go-to Indian place.  I'll try different locations in the future but this is DEFINITELY staying on my list and somewhere I would recommend for delivery."}
