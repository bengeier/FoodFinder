{"text":"Went for take out on our way home from Fry's last night for the first time. Food was hot getting in the car. Got home and set it down to open and install the new 60\" LG.

Wellllll. 1 1/2 hours later not getting the surround sound to work with the tv we were done.

So now we sit down to eat (kinda excited about the tv and forgot about the food lol). Simply put it was still warm. YEAH

He got broccoli beef and egg rolls. I got mixed vegatables. 

He ate all of his and was happy. I really was not. Zero flavor for the sauce. The egg rolls were amazing."}
{"text":"I have gone about 5 times, and each time was a good experience. They were really nice and the crab ragoons and the chow mein are so good! Only reason I put four stars is because the last couple times I went the orange beef was soaked in sauce with hardly any meat."}
{"text":"An edit to my previous review in 2015.  With the recent name change from China Garden to China ok Go, sadly I have lost my favorite Chinese take out.  With the name change, they must have changed all of the chefs as well.  I recently ordered the same options I have always selected.  None of it was the same... Chicken Chop Suey, House Fried Rice, Pepper Beef and Won Ton Soup.  None of it was very good, period... Maybe that will change someday, but until then, I am revising my rating to a 1 from a 5."}
{"text":"This place is small, but it's good! The food is made fresh and stays warm for a long time. Their spam musubi is my favorite dish. The people are kind as well, always smiling and quick to get your order done."}
{"text":"The food was excellent ! The staff was very nice too , and I love the boba drinks , the bobas was the best in Las Vegas ! But the only bad thing is the lunch special portion was huge , it was too much , in another word , maybe some people they really like the big portion , but the point is they really can't eat that much food , it's just the personal meal , so the question is the waste , the good restaurant the good business can not make the waste they need to protect the environment they need to think about this problem ! People do not want to take the food with themselves so the food always in the trash can ,if someone take food to home , next day they will not come back to order because they eat enough Chinese food . So the business will lose some customer ! I must to come back want to see is there gonna change a little bit or not . I really like the food there very delicious! Hope you guys have good business!!"}
{"text":"Love the chow fun! It reminds up of our trips to Maui. Love the chicken with hot garlic sauce!

{"text":"The food is 'meh' and the service sucks. I've ordered a few times for delivery and the delivery guy is always super rude. They always seem inconvenienced that they had to drive over here and I'm like three miles away.

I had another guy who told me I have to put my 8 pound Miniature Pinscher away before he would give me my food because he's afraid of dogs.

There are plenty of other places that I can order from. I've tried with these guys numerous times and the customer service just sucks. Food is average. Won't order here anymore."}
{"text":"Came in here and ordered the chicken nuggets and noodles , and the waitress looked at me like she didnt know what I was talkng about , study your menu girl . 2 dollars extra to get noodles instead of rice . Never again , I rate this place with 2 stars because 1 theres no greeting when you enter , no welcoming AT ALL . And 2 no THANK YOU at all , the only thing I like about this place is there set up ."}
{"text":"I'm spoiled. I grew up in San Francisco where excellent Chinese cuisine is plenty and inexpensive. The China Garden is on par with Panda Express and that is not a compliment. If you really need a quick Chinese food fix, this place may sort of placate that need, but in my opinion it's a cheap fix. It's not great food. At least it's a clean restaurant and service is fast. That's about it."}
{"text":"Great hole in the wall place here in Henderson. I have tried several chinese places, but they always fall short of authenticity. This place isnt flashy, its your typical hole in the wall, but incredibly full of heart and soul. Their dishes arent your typical Americanized chinese place where they put sugar in everything. They have actual Chinese dishes. My favorite dish from this place is the egg foo yung- nice crispy and light... not at all oily. Their curry dishes are nice and spicy, full of flavor and a LOT of chicken! Great place for lunch, they even deliver!"}
{"text":"This place is terrible!! I order soup and fill the cup halfway I asked I wanted it topped off they told me that's gonna be extra charge that's ridiculous!! Never again will I come here there food and service sucks"}
{"text":"Just had late lunch here.  Unfriendly host/waitress (no greeting, not attentive and no \"thank you\").  Chicken chow mein was absolutely tasteless.  Egg rolls were burnt but tasty.  Spouse's seafood tofu soup was delicious according to him.  The long drive to try this place just wasn't worth it.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"Delicious food and great service! I live in Green Valley and haven't had the best luck with Chinese restaurants. I was pleasantly surprised when I found this one so close to my house. I recommend their Singapore noodles and sweet & sour chicken"}
{"text":"This place was super clean and the cashier was super nice. Great egg drop and hot and sour soup!"}
{"text":"For Chinese take-out...this is the place.  We used to order from Chopstix, but since trying China Garden, we're committed.  I have to say I have never eaten in or had delivery, so this review is for the pick-up service and the food.

Orders are ready when we're told they will be, and they are accurate, freshly made and hot.  They will adjust seasoning to your liking--if you're not a fan of \"spicy-HOT\", they'll kindly make things milder for you (a big plus for me).  I love their Hot & Sour Soup, just spicy enough to be frisky but won't blow off the top of your head.  This would be incredible for someone with the flu!  The spring rolls are fresh, crispy and delicious, with just the right amount of oil (because c'mon, take-out Chinese has to be a little greasy or it wouldn't be good, amirite???)  We've tried the Egg Fu Yung and that's delicious with lots of veg and yummy gravy.  The Yellow Curry was really good but had more of an Indian curry flavor than Chinese.  This was fine to my personal taste but my husband likes it hotter with a more Chinese/Thai flavor than Indian.  Kalua Pork & Cabbage is delicious and worth a trip to CG just by itself.

I really like China Garden.  I'm giving it 5 stars because it beats the heck out of any take-out Chinese place I've tried locally.  Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Even after reading all the reviews,  like a ding dong I called myself giving them a chance.  I ordered the siagon noodles which had BBC pork, chicken,  beef and shrimp. It smelled so good and I was thinking to myself why did they have so many bad reviews and I see people coming in and out this place with bags of food. Long story short I ordered my food prior to me getting off work, plus my kids were gone for the weekend so I just knew I was about to chill and grub down on some relaxation tip. WRONG.  My food looked like somebody threw it together, ate it and then regurgitated it back into my take out box.  It was absolutely disgusting.  Not only that I work right next door to them,  so you would think my food was gonna be on some fleek type ish.  After I ate a little of it I got sick my stomach hutted and I threw it up. My body was like NNNOOOOO!!! So lesson well learned sometimes you have to believe the hype. Never again. The only good part was somebody but this dinner for me so ya know its cool. I didnt lose anything but my well planned childless time. Thanks China ok Gross!"}
{"text":"Good food. The staff isn't very attentive and never came to take our order so we had to go back up to the counter to order. Also it is FREEZING in there. Looking at the thermostat, it is set at 62. If you come here, pack your winter gear. All in all- good dinner special and decent Chinese food. Maybe just do the pick up so you don't have to wait for 15 minutes at your table and freeze."}
{"text":"UPDATE 1: I decided to go back for the honey chicken.  It fell below expectations.  It was served sweet-and-sour style (thick battered pieces of chicken with sauce on the side), but I found the chicken too rubbery and the sauce much too sweet and syrupy.  I'm willing to give this place one more try before I update my rating for the last time. 

UPDATE 2: Finally, I decided to try the sesame chicken in order to round out the most popular chicken plates.  It was kind of dry and completely covered in seeds (I saw it again the next day).  While it's an improvement over the honey chicken, I still recommend the orange chicken over all the other choices. (A fellow Yelper tipped me off that you can order it with the sauce on the side, which makes it even better.)  

I'm going to demote this place a star, since 2 out of 3 of the things I ordered turned out to be a total letdown."}
{"text":"When I get the craving for Chinese food it has to be China garden! China Garden is a great stop n go meal. Their fast and always great service, Not to mention they have great deals especially their lunch specials.
I'm always ify about Chinese restaurants when it comes to cleanliness, China Garden is very clean and a great family owned restaurant, they deliver and have never messed up my orders. Now people if your in the Green Valley area and your hungry for some Chinese food please swing by China garden and get some."}
{"text":"This restaurant changed owners and names in the spring. The food was much better with the new owner. The veggies were fresh and the food was not greasy. I ordered vegetable egg foo young and my husband got sweet and sour pork. The sweet and sour sauce and gravy for the egg foo young were very good. Two reasons I have four stars instead of five: the onions and peppers were completely raw with the sweet and sour pork, and would have been much better cooked, even slightly. Also, many Chinese restaurants give a little cup of soup with their meals, and this one does not, which was sad but no big deal."}
{"text":"Love this spot great, fresh food! Bourbon chicken is the best!! Egg drop soup is also super yummy!"}
{"text":"Looking for a cheap place for lunch and I remembered seeing a sign that this place had a lunch special. $5.55 for lunch ($6 on the spot after taxes) dine-in only soup, rice/noodles and dish, fountain drink. A whopping deal in my book! 

I thought it was a real restaurant, with a waiter that serves you, but it's not! You go in and order at the front and then sit down and they will bring the food to you. Gigantor portions!

Very clean place and the stuff is very welcoming! 

Food wise: I had better beef and broccoli in my life. The sauce was good, just the texture of the beef was not my favorite...very chewy. I will go back to try other dishes though. Egg drop soup was very delicious! I wish I would have grabbed a menu as I left, I would like to see what else they offer."}
{"text":"Good food !  And at a reasonable price.
We like the NY style chicken chow mien, it is like we used to get back east.

Give it a try"}
{"text":"I thought I would give this place a try since it is close to my new job. First when I walked in to pick up my order the lady was rude and didn't wear a smile. The first thing I ordered was the cashew chicken. I didn't like it, veggies were soggy and the chicken texture was strange and tasted stale. My absolute favorite place is China One on Trop/eastern, so I thought well maybe I am just comparing it to them. So I gave it another try. Second time around I ordered Teriyaki chicken, simple I thought. The chicken was even worse this time! Tasted like over baked shredded chicken leg meat! I specifically asked for my veggies to be lightly sautéed. Still soggy! The rice and noodle are edible/ok. I won't be returning just not worth the money or frustration."}
{"text":"Always fresh food and fantastic taste... great and kind people... but most importantly their servings are huge. Why is this place empty? It should be packed."}
{"text":"I would give this place a one  star rating.came for lunch , portion was a child size meal. Will never come back again when I said something the guy just laughed."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food restaurant for it's prices and quality in Henderson and possibly in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I have always ordered from the place at this address before it became China Ok Go (China Garden back then). Same people, new company name, prices went up a little. I don't check my food because I have NEVER had a problem with my food or service.  I ordered two lunch specials totaling $18.19 to be delivered. I paid and opened my food. I did not receive what I ordered. I called back to tell them and was told I was speaking to the manager. I explained what was in my bowl and it was not what I ordered.  I felt as if I was being called a liar because the man on the phone did not and would not believe me. So I asked him to describe Sesame Chicken and he did. Again I tried to tell him that what he described was not what I received.  I said it again, \"I have pork, chicken, shrimp, rice, carrots and peas in this food box.\" He spoke to someone in the restaurant in his native tongue and then started talking to me again. Telling me that he gave me what I ordered. I said, \"You are not listening to me. I have ordered Sesame Chicken from you guys for years and this is not what I ordered. \"HE HUNG UP THE PHONE IN MY FACE! Really, this is how you treat your customers?! So I got in the car and went up there. With food in hand I went in the empty restaurant and asked to speak to the manager who hung up in my face. At the table were 3 men and 1 lady all looking at me. All 3 men looked away, the lady got up and came to the counter. She tried to be sweet but by that time I did not care. I came there to do two things, give them their food back and get a refund. She wanted to know why.  I told her the same thing I described above. Then one of the guys decided to get up and come to the counter as if he cared now. No one cared when I was on the phone, so why now? Oh because I am not the liar you thought I was on the phone? She agreed after looking at my receipt that this was not the correct food. I didn't want the food remade, I wanted away from there & never to call them again! So she gave me my $ back and I did let her know that I would never order from them again. Not that it will break them, because it won't as I am just one person. I just wanted them to know and understand that treating long-time customers (+ 6 years) like this will leave you with no customers. Since none of the men confessed to being the manager to my face, one can guess they were the liars! China Ok Go really needs to be called China Ok No! Will be trying out NY City China in their place. #ChinaOkGo

Addendum: They texted me saying because of the language barrier, the employees were not understanding that I had received the wrong food. Hmmm, a manager who has a language barrier and hangs up on customers should not be the manager. I was offered: 2 free bobas with my next delivery order or I can just pick up two bobas for free."}
{"text":"This place is close to my house so I go here from time to time. Food is ok...egg rolls are good...dont ever get the curry, tasteless, and i would've given them 3 stars, but tonight I pulled up to a big open sign (actually two big signs) and the front door was open but they said they were already closed and can't take my order.  Now I'm hungry and mad, so only one star for you."}
{"text":"As an update, we went back tonight and tried more dishes with the whole family. Still didn't disappoint. So good. We tried Sesame Chicken, Orange Chicken, Beef & Green Onion (amazing - my favorite of the night) and Hunan Beef (which had great veggies and the beef was so tender).

We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Always the best, first time getting delivery everything was hot and tasty. 
Perfect for a quick lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"I have been going here on a regular basis since my job change.  From the beginning it has been good and had maintained the goodness.  It is not China Town goodness but close.  

For catering to an all types Cuisine in the neighborhood they can cater to the strong Asian Cuisine, because it is owned and run by Asians but also cater to the neighborhood which is not as much.  In my opinion that is impressive.

The prices are a bit hard to maneuver until you become a regular.  I ordered a soup and was told there was only one size.  About 15 minutes after I ordered and was eating my food my coworker came in with a half size.  Uggh, well he told me how to order but seriously if I'm asking it means I am looking!  Blahhh...

The food is good, filling and makes me want to take out instead of cooking in after a long day..."}
{"text":"I love coming here they are fast when you call order for pick up  great customer service .Foods are good and they are so tidy wearing gloves to make the foods . I would recommend this place to anyone... the only chinese restaurant i would only go in Henderson."}
{"text":"By far some of the best Chinese food in the area. They give you plenty of food and it's supper yummy. Delivery is always super fast and service is awesome. You get tons of food with the lunch special! Don't get me started on the slushes! Just delish."}
{"text":"The lunch special was TOP NOTCH!  The service?  Meh.  After dropping off the food the \"waitress\" sat and talked with a co-worker for our entire meal, never once coming back except to drop the ticket.  

Conclusion:  Take out...the food is worth every penny.  Dine in?  Skip it."}
{"text":"I have been eating here at least twice a week for lunch since I discovered them and have not been disappointed, yet. Last night I grabbed dinner to go on the way home since I was fighting a severe Ben & Jerry's craving thanks to a fellow foodie. This meal hit the spot.

I ordered the Dinner Special which was Beef with Garlic Sauce extra spicy of course and it included fried rice and an egg roll with tax about $7.80. It took about ten minutes and was handed to me with a smile. The portions are still enormous I had to carry the bag with two hands! I get home and didn't even take my shoes off or wait for the food to cool off. I started grubbin and found that the Garlic Beef is my new fave here. It's loaded with tender beef, corn, mushrooms, onions, bell papers and water chestnuts. The sauce is sweet and garlicky with a hint of spice. So good! I gave the rice to my mom since I'm being good. I did take a bite of the egg roll and will pass on that next time.

 Large portions, quality ingredients, friendly and fast service for under eight bucks. Overall China Garden is still doing it right and I am still a super fan."}
{"text":"strongly recommand that chinese resturant?sesame beef and bbq pork are amazing?and the price is very acceptable?if you order over 20?they will present free egg rolls and soup?really a great deal?"}
{"text":"My old man found the flyer and wanted to try something new. Never again!  GO to Ny city china.  Told me 30 to 35 minutes. Took over as hour. Everything cold and basically tasteless. Plus got a mailer for delivery but not free had to pay $3 they did inform me of this"}
{"text":"China Garden is now China ok Go...and admittedly...it can go. For whatever reason they felt the need to rename themselves and reopen under the guise of being 'healthy chinese food'. I don't know if it's new owners or what but the pork fried rice i usually get is now not even remotely good which sucks because they were the only place I liked. Plus it looks like the pricing went up on a lot of stuff.  Doubt i'll be returning and guess I'll need to find a new place for rice."}
{"text":"Craving Chinese I decided to give This place a shot. Specials for lunch and dinner are reasonably priced. I had the General Tso's. it was pretty tasty, not the best but good. The fried rice was mediocre. Tasted like Panda Express. I did like the egg roll. Actual pork inside not just veggies and a decent size. I will go back to try more."}
{"text":"Great service combined with delicious food the time it takes to prepare is worth the wait down to the last bite"}
{"text":"Chicken wings are great.  The food is always good and delivery is always fast.  Affordable and quick!"}
{"text":"I like their food. The servings are HUGE and the prices are very affordable. They have lunch and dinner specials which is usually when I go. They also deliver if you live within a certain mile radius, which I do! Lol I have never had any problems with this resturant. Check them out!"}
{"text":"This is a really amazing Chinese place if you're looking for delicious food at an inexpensive price. The lunch special can not be beat!! Under $6 for any entree on their menu with a side of fried rice and chow mein. I was absolutely surprised at how large their portions are! I will agree that the customer service isn't top notch, but the food definitely is worth it."}
{"text":"customer service and food are amazing. couldn't have asked for a better experience while dining on my lunch. definately will be returning. family owned and operated what more could you honestly ask for?"}
{"text":"This place is ok, I've ordered several things from here and overall the food is pretty decent except for the shrimp which didn't taste very fresh the last couple of times I ordered from there.  Other than that no complaints. If you're dining in, they offer a complimentary cup of soup! Unfortunately, there's no decor at all, you sit next to a big white wall. They definitely need to decorate the place a little bit"}
{"text":"I love there Mongolian beef with extra onions and the duck is great!!! Fast service plus they deliver. The young staff is awesome and they get my order right everytime I go."}
{"text":"We had been wanting to try this place for a while & I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised. I ordered online, which is a huge convenience for me. The restaurant called to verify the ENTIRE order!! I got my food delivered in about 35 minutes. Big yay! The food was hot, tasty and there is enough for us to have supper later. They even have is free CAKE!! I only give 4 out of 5 because the Thai tea is not as sweet as I would like. But....that will not preclude me from ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Nice clean place. Quick to fix order.  Give them a try. Very friendly.  Not good for large groups. The maxium occupancy is like 35. But for a strip mall Chinese restaurant it's worth finding.  The do not use peanut oil. And understand food allergies."}
{"text":"My favorite Wonton soup.  I eat it often.  All the noodle dishes are really good also."}
{"text":"1-Has some really good authentic Chinese food thats very tasty . We ordered 3 different items and they were all good didn't disappoint and big portions . 2- Really great price . 3- Friendly service and generous with condiments ."}
{"text":"Perfect for a quick lunch. Got the chicken and mushroom lunch special.  Very laid back and plenty of room. Would recommend stopping by and giving it a try. Tables and floor were all clean. Very nice."}
{"text":"Chinese restaurants are always hit and miss when it comes to a vegetarian option. There is always the standard veggie and rice, but sometimes a place will go above and beyond with eggplant, tofu, mushrooms or if a place is feeling really hipster they will throw in some seitan. But this is not that place. Their rice was good enough but I was disappointed with their menu of at least 40 dishes having nothing without meat."}
{"text":"Consistently 4 stars:

  This is my eighth Yelp check-in visit in China Garden. Friendly service and quality of the food has consistently been 4 stars.
  My visits have been before 4 pm, the latest time to catch the lunch special. I dine inside.
  Their lunch specials top off at $6.25. Of course, if you dining in, I suggest a tip. Similar to the majority of Chinese restaurants, a shrimp's entry is the top priced item. ($6.25).
  Their lunch special gives a grand portion of quality food for their money. It includes a fountain drink for people dining in (Pepsi products), soup of the day (on every visit egg drop soup), an entree with fried rice and chow mein. 
  My favorite China Garden dishes are the pepper steak, shrimp with lobster sauce, and shrimp chop suey. 
   The chow mein noodles take up a small portion of the plate. I left a few Chinese restaurants slightly let down by too much of the plate filled with ordinary chow mein noodles. For the record, the chow mein noodles are tasty.
 China Garden also cooks NY chow mein. It is a separate combination dish. I tried it, and was not a fan of it.
 China Garden so far, is obviously doing the right thing. My brother, who lives in North Las Vegas, will eat here when he is in Henderson. He recommends the barbecue spare ribs.
 Return factor: High"}
{"text":"My husband and I order from China Garden probably twice a month, and we are always completely satisfied.  They service is very friendly, and the deliveries always arrive well within the time frame given over the phone. 

The food itself always cures our Chinese-delivery cravings.  We try a lot of different items, but some of our favorites are the Wonton Soup, the Curry Chicken, and the Mongolian Beef.  The portions are generous, easily providing two additional meals, so the $40 average that we spend seems to go quite far for us.

For their friendly service and very decent food, China Garden has definitely earned two happy & loyal customers."}
{"text":"Their spring rolls are super yummy and they have a bunch of different mixed vegetables and grilled meats to choose from not just the fried sweet and sour stuff,  I've been in Las Vegas since May and this is the first Chinese restaurant I can honestly say I'm one hundred percent happy with. I really like this place!"}
{"text":"Great food, horrible customer service. Always gives bad attitude everytime I come in and its only like twice a year. Wish they were more people friendly."}
{"text":"I ate here once a while ago..I got the eggplant and tofu and it was really good for a take-out Chinese place. At the time I was confused as to why they quit was blue but now I know that's just how Chinese eggplant is LOL

However today I stopped in on my way home from work to pick up a lunch special and the smell inside was so horrible I immediately turned around and walked out.

It smelled like a mix between a wet dog, rotting meat, and sewage.

 I don't set high standards for cleanliness in restaurants , but this was just a bit too much

 I will never return and would give no stars if I could"}
{"text":"I called for dinner tonight and was given the wrong order. When I called to explain what was wrong, the lady wanted to argue with me. I tried to explain that I asked for dinners and was not given the correct meals. She was not accommodating and told me that because we paid for it. But I tried to explain that even thought it was paid for it was wrong. The white rice was stale and I felt like my business did not matter. It was 9:29 and they close at 9:30 I am sure that is why she didn't try to accommodate me because they were closing. Very disappointed.."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews on this restaurant the question was to eat in or take out. We decided to eat in and give it a try. Surprisingly the service was quite decent, there was one young girl running the whole front of the restaurant and she stayed attentive of to all the tables. The presentation of the food was awesome, however the quality was very poor. We ordered mongolian beef and sesame chicken, I'm not sure it was actually beef in the Mongolian beef. The so called beef was extremely slimy and smushy. The fried rice had very little flavor, the egg drop soup was good and the sesame chicken was not too bad. I would not go out of my way to come here again. Gave the restaurant a 2 star based solely on the quality of service, was unable to bring myself to eat the Mongolian beef."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I have been back and now I remember why. The food is decent and the prices are ok for the large portion sizes. 

My problems: Usually when I have went I eat my soup while I wait for my to go order. Today I was told no, soup is only for dine in. I would understand this...but it's like three ounces of soup in a togo cup (the cup is a togo styrofoam cup whether it is for eat in or not) so if I am ordering three meals for carryout, is it that serious to let me have a half cup of soup for the twenty minute wait? But no big deal, hey I am not crying over half a cup of soup, just seems to me if there is one table in the whole place you might want to go the extra mile. 

My main issue: I ordered kung pao chicken no chicken, baby corn instead of chicken. I order this at every chinese restaurant I go to, and rarely have an issue. I had a whole conversation with the dude about meat, that I wouldnt mind paying extra, I just prefer x veggies instead of chicken, mainly corn. 

I get my order and it is tied in a knot to where I cant open the bag without ripping the whole bag open. I get home and open my box....to Kung Pao Zucchini. I mean literally, it is ALL zucchini with TWO bites of carrot and three (no seriously, three) water chestnuts and zero baby corn. WTH?

So I call and talk to the dude, and ask him what gives? I mean, I like zucchini as much as the next person but really? He says oh, there are carrots in there too, to which i let him know there was two bites. I asked where the corn was, I mean we had this whole conversation..\"Oh, I wasn't really paying attention to all that. Do you want to come back for another one?\"  Ahh no, it is over 100 degrees out and I just finally got home with my messed up food, no I will not be driving back. Ever. 

My boyfriends bourbon chicken was ok, he didn't care for the chow mein or rice so we just threw that away.

So yeah, I gave them a benefit star for having big portions and good prices. SO if you like a lotta stuff for a lot of cheap, here ya go. However, for real chinese, I would definitely recommend trying elsewhere."}
{"text":"Legit!!!  The portions are big, the prices are set right. The restaurant is clean and the staff is friendly. All in all it's the best Chinese place I've found in Green Valley/Henderson."}
{"text":"Ordered food to go today didn't feel like driving and payed 3$ extra for extra shrimp for me and my friends . So it was supposed to be a total of 18 peices they put 11 lOl u don't try to get over people who tip very well and don't my paying extra then they act like they put it all in their wen we called back horrible services"}
{"text":"The food was really good!  Hubby was sick and we ordered  from  here, never eaten here before, but the Mongolian beef was really great,! Hubby had Beef Pepper  we both had the fried rice. .excellent, ,took a  quick  bite before I was going to take a picture  but so good I ate it all. Lol so no picture."}
{"text":"I would love to give 5 starts, but just can't. Food is always very yummy if they get it correctly. Ive ordered from them 15+times. Good food, but very rude employees. They dont say Hi or Bye. Walk in, pay and leave."}
{"text":"NO FLAVOR, VERY BLAND! Fried rice is dry, the pork pieces in the rice are dry and taste like rubber I ordered the family dinner special with chicken Kung pao, chicken teriyaki it was a waste of $33.00 dollars"}
{"text":"Had to update my original rating. Yesterday I placed my order for delivery as usual. One of the items I always get is the Kung Pao Shrimp with bean sprouts. The online receipt came to $17.35, I paid the driver $20.35, then I notice on the receipt on the bag it says $19.43. They charged me an extra dollar for the bean sprouts and another dollar for delivery.. That means I tipped the driver .92 cents!! Don't know if it's a new owner or manager, but I've been coming here for years and never disappointed until now. At least call and say here is a price difference and ask if I still would like the order. So I change my \"never disappointed\" to \"sadly disappointed\"."}
{"text":"Still in search of good chinese out in las vegas. I got sweet and sour chicken. It was bland. Sauce had very little flavor. The rice here was also very bland tasting. I wont eat here again."}
