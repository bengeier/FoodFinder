{"text":"Pros:
For the price, this place is pretty good, you can expect to pay $11 to $13 for a bowl of noodles. I tried the signature braised beef chunk noodle soup and pork fried noodles on separate visits. The flat noodles have a nice chewy texture and absorbs the flavor of any surrounding soup or sauce. Their meat is delicious and tender. The dishes feel authentic. If you're in the area and are in the mood for Chinese noodles I would definitely recommend giving this place a shot. If you're in a hurry they have take out. Will definitely return to try their other items.

Cons (not a deal-breaker):
- new restaurant, new staff. The staff are relatively inexperienced, they tend to drop utensils and forget to bring you soup spoons when they bring your noodle soup
- staff are mainly Mandarin speakers, English is not their first language, but they will make it work
- the menu is not very descriptive, if you are not Chinese ... Google is your friend
- the restaurant is a bit small, there aren't that many seats, gets packed during lunch"}
{"text":"I was originally very excited to see that this place had opened up in the Willowdale area and was looking forward to trying the food. But after my second time dining here I just HAD to leave a review and here's why:

First off, the food here is pretty great. The hand pulled noodles here have character, very smooth, silky, and cooked to perfection. While I have tried both the soup noodles and dry sauce noodles I would say that sauce noodles are definitely the ones to try. I tried the Porkgamo today and the filling was very delicious but bun was a bit firm and felt like it had been sitting out for a while. Food wise, this place has left a pretty good impression!

My reason behind only giving 2 stars: THE SERVICE IS TERRIBLE !!! My first time dining here was on the weekend and the service was slow but that was forgivable given that they were quite busy. But my second time here was on a weekday at 1 pm and after walking in, WE had to get the attention of a waitress and ask if we could be seated. Given that the restaurant is fairly small and the staff in the back have a perfectly good view of the front door, we shouldn't have had to wait that long or even have to grab the attention of staff when entering! Upon sitting down, we were not given menus/water/even greeted and sat there for more than 5 minutes waiting to be served. Finally, I had to flag down a waitress who was at the register because it seems like we had been forgotten (even though the restaurant was not at full capacity) and ask if we could have some menus and water to start. When ordering, my dad asked about the types of noodles they offered and the waitress was very impatient with explaining and I caught a glimpse of her rolling her eyes at my dad's confusion when she was the one who didn't give a thorough explanation. You can't expect customers to come in and know what exactly you serve EVEN if they are Chinese!!! I had thought that the lack of professionalism that this waitress had was only because we were Chinese but she later served another table with non-Chinese customers and had the exact same attitude! In contrast, another male waiter (who did not serve us) was very polite to his table and even thanked us for dining here when we left.

All in all, the food here is delicious but the service is unacceptable. If you're looking for a place that will leave an impression on you come here because the food will leave a good one and the service is definitely something that you won't forget. Honestly I don't think I'll be coming back ever again."}
{"text":"We were here for quick lunch, and we ordered 2 signature braised beef chunk noodle and halal beef Rougamo. It was beyond our expectations! Big thumbs up!  

Signature braised beef noodle:
Both of us liked the texture of the hand pulled noodle. It has well balanced resistance to it and cooked just right. (Plus, each noodle were real \"long\", like nonstop. Must be a lot of work stretch the flours over and over again) 
The beef chunk (I think it's brisket?) were tender! Unexpectedly tender, most restaurant with beef noodle have pretty dry beef chunk, so we were pleasantly impressed. 
The only so-so aspect is the soup base, it was quite oily, not the thick greasy oily, but somewhat oily with not much flavour other than soy sauce. But it doesn't ruin the noodle, so overall I'd love to visit again. 

Halal beef Rougamo was a star as well. 
The bun were pan fried to crispy on the outside surface, and does not taste doughy at all.  The inside is fully filled with pulled beef, (I hope they will keep up the standard, as oppose to some places have very little fillings and very doughy bun). 

Service was pretty good, I read some negative reviews on the inexperienced service, so my expectation was so-so, no expectation. But the male waiter was very attentive, quick and friendly :)

Overall we give 8/10 and a bonus point for the service."}
{"text":"Ok, so I'm quite surprised by this place considering the number of northern Chinese noodle restaurants opening up in the Yonge/Sheppard/Finch area.

I got takeout of the signature braised beef noodle soup, two traditional porkgamos and the spicy tofu sheets. The tofu sheets weren't spicy at all, but they were tasty with a sesame oil flavour.  Porkgamos were flavourful on the inside but I found the outside bun/pastry was bland and tasteless. It gets a bit greasy as you're eating it, so be careful when eating it.  The noodle soup tasted authentic.  I walked 20-25 minutes before eating it and it didn't really get soggy as the soup and noodles were in separate containers. The noodles are flat and thick, hand-pulled as you can see through the kitchen.  Beef was very tender and almost melts in your mouth--flavourful and there's a generous amount.

Medium-sized space with maybe about 20 seats. Staff weren't super friendly or personable but they did their job. Prices were reasonable as well ($36 total)--feeds 3 semi-hungry people and 2 very hungry people.

Would definitely come back here to try their other dishes!"}
{"text":"Rougamo & Noodles is a newly opened noodle shop near Tsujiri in the Yonge/Sheppard area. The food was just ok, as we got:
- Signature braised beef chuck noodle soup: I was a bit worried with the beef as it was a brighter red than I thought would be good, but it ended up tender/tasty enough. The soup was ok, with enough flavour to not make it generic. The flat noodles were a bit disappointing - they didn't have that awesome hand-tossed texture that Artisan Noodles up at Yonge/Finch does. 
- Shan'xi meat sauce noodles: The server warned me that this dish would be a bit salty... and it was A LOT MORE salty than expected. Too bad, because all the salt detracted from a pretty good meat sauce and generous helpings of veggies.
- Halal beefgamo rougamo: The star of the meal! I know people who don't like rougamo because they think the bread is too tough. I found this to have the right amount of chewiness+crispiness. Oh, and the beef was nice and tender (vs being overly stringy or clumpy, which sometimes happens in other places).

In terms of the other stuff:
- Service was efficient and they explained the menu options pretty well
- The place, though small, didn't feel overly cramped and was clean
- Open kitchen but you didn't leave with the food smell sticking to your clothes

Given my main reason for giving this place an average rating is the food (versus the service or setting), I'm not sure being 'new' had any effect on my rating. I'm happy I tried it but likely won't be back."}
{"text":"Came here Friday at 6:15p.m. and was about 15 mins wait. It has about 10 tables but some tables are too close to the entrance and ppl waiting are standing right beside you. Maybe this place is still need so the servers seems disorganized. They speak limited english and speaks mandarin. Some tables got water in paper cups some tables and plastic cups. Noodles itself was good, they did run out one type of noodle but didnt really understand what they said. Will come back and try other. You pay at the cash."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch one day and ordered Spicy Porkgamo 
and Signature Blangbiang Noodles. 

The spicy porkgamo was just ok.  The bun was kinda hard and didn't seem fresh.  The filling was... interesting... I enjoyed it, but there is definately a flavour I can only describe as \"authentic funk\".  I think someone who isn't familiar with chinese cuisine would not appreiciate it. 

The noodles were very good.  Fresh with a nice chew.  Broth was flavourful.  Though be warned... they are slippery, and they are quite heavy.  Like seriously... if you can get through your meal without your hands cramping up like a damn hook... I mean... you probably still wouldn't get that approval from your Asian girlfriend's parents, but for whatever it's worth, you got my respect.  Oi! That's with chopsticks!  Put that damn fork away."}
