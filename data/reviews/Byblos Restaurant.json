{"text":"Excellent Lebanese food! Everything was fresh and very well made. Has the authentic taste of Lebanon that is hard to find outside of Lebanon or high concentrations of Lebanese population. Very, very good and authentic!"}
{"text":"This was the first Mediterranean place I had in AZ. I didn't feel like making dinner that night and was craving falafel, so I looked on Yelp and found the 4 star review, one of the highest and closest to me. The pictures looked authentic and delicious. I should've stayed home and saved my money. It's a hole in the wall, which I ordinarily like and can be a good indication of authenticity. The 1 star is for an attempt at a restaurant. The atmosphere and service wasn't bad. The falafel though -- worst I've ever had. It's dried out and flavorless. I judge a Mediterranean place on how good their falafel is, and this was terrible. I hardly wanted to finish it but did because I was hungry. The server -- I think he was the owner -- recommended a red wine, and I sprang for it. It was almost skunked, so he clearly pushed it on me to get rid of it. Gross."}
{"text":"I love this place!  The food is amazing and the owners are charming to a fault!  The Hummus, Grape Leaves, Kibbi Akras, and the Lamb Dinner are my favorites!  Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"It's been hit or miss here. I've had some good stuff and some okay stuff. The babaganouj and moussaka were delicious, the lentil soup and spinach pie were eh. Overall it's good food and I will go back, and the owner is pretty amusing and very kind!"}
{"text":"The food is absolutely delicious and noticeably homemade. The staff is incredibly friendly and makes you feel right at home. One of the best restaurants I have been to in many years. I highly recommend the beef stroganoff and for dessert honey pudding."}
{"text":"The best Mediterranean food Arizona has to offer. Completely beats Pita Jungle and My Big Fat Greek Restaurant. Mom and pop place. Very personable. So cute and quaint. Loved the owners! Absolutely delicious!! Also best falafel EVER."}
{"text":"I rated this low because of the bad service, the food is good, I would recommend take-out instead of dinning in.  The service is bad because they keep saying they will be with you in a minute and it can keep getting repeated for 10 minutes or longer.  The service is the worst I have seen even with other smaller restaurants like this one, and I'm not one of these people that just complain about everything."}
{"text":"My monthly dinner group of 15 people has been here three times in the last two years. The food is always excellent and owner Sam and his lovely wife make us feel right at home. As Sam says: \"The homemade tomato soup is to die for, and the minestrone soup is to fight for.\"  Dine, here you'll not be disappointed."}
{"text":"This restaurant is wonderful.   Excellent atmosphere and very good service.  We loved the music playing in the background as well.  The owner was very attentive to our needs and was very friendly.  The tomato soup we started off with was delicious.   My husband had lamb and I had a vegetarian combo platter.   We both enjoyed our food.   Very good and fresh.  Highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Delicious food, especially the oven roasted lamb, tomato soup, and foul moudammas!  Lengthy menu with something for everyone.  Nice atmosphere, not too loud to hear your conversation.  To top off the good food, the owner and his wife were extremely friendly and kind, with very responsive service.  We'll definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"I was introduced to this place by my Girlfriend on our anniversary. She has been coming here for year. I cannot begin to say enough about the service and the since of community that is present here. The food sealed the deal thought the Lamb is amazing and also go for the tomato to die for because it is. I could ramble all day about how good it is but all I have to say is go and you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"The Carrot Cake is absolutely amazing!!    Great food and the staff is great.   Would recommend to anyone looking for great service and delicious food."}
{"text":"The food at Byblos is very good. The menu is neither lacking nor excessive, but just about the right amount in the number of offerings. Years ago I went there on my wedding anniversary--we were both in the mood for Mediterranean food. After we were seated, no one waited on us. After about 15 minutes, we got up and left. (Maybe servers were confused about in whose section we had been seated.) Years later, I went to lunch there with some friends. Everything was fine this time around, but I had to explain to my companions why I had chosen not to eat there for years. It's been over a year now since that lunch, but I need to go back because the food is delicious. That incident many years ago was, I'm sure, a fluke. However, that one time of bad \"service\" left a bad taste in my mouth (and tells a story about the importance of pleasing the customer). Honestly, though, the food won't hurt your feelings. You'll like it."}
{"text":"We went here because it was 9pm at night. This restaurant closes at 10pm. I think this is family owned. Anyways, the owner/manager guy kept telling us that everything on the menu was \"the best\". It wasn't. It was ok, but Tasty Kabob on Broadway or Apache is better.  The interior of the restaurant looks better than Tasty Kabob but the food is not as good.  Whenever I go in there, which has only been 2 x, there is never anyone there.  Not a good sign."}
{"text":"We have been here about ten times. The owners are sweet and so pleasant. The plates offer generous portions. We all love the tomato soup. It is very creamy and cheesy. I really like the chicken kabobs. The chicken Mediterranean is also a favorite. They give lots of bread to the entire table."}
{"text":"I use to go there in very regular base. I love their tomatoo soup. IT IS A MUST. I also like their  chicken palte with white sauce (I think mushroom). The owners are lovely and sweetheart"}
{"text":"The food was good, the owner/server was friendly... But waiting over 30 minutes for the check while the server struggled with another party's simple drink order ruined the evening. She kept indicating she would be over and we waited... And waited...."}
{"text":"This family owned Mediterranean restaurant offers very good food for vegetarians which has been a huge factor in deciding where I should go when I crave falafels. Their food is light (non greasy) on the stomach and very tasty at the same time. My favorites are baba ganoush, falafel wrap, dolma and their house tomato bisque. In fact their lentil soup is also delicious. I would recommend this place to anyone who is in the mood for some Mediterranean food. Service could have been a little better as they were understaffed when we went last year and the orders took quite a while to come."}
{"text":"Family-owned Mediterranean restaurant.   If you're in a hurry go somewhere else.  If you want God's cuisine and want a great place to socialize, you found the place."}
{"text":"Wonderful food here! Lentil soup was brilliant and the fattoush was the best I have had. The lamb gyros platters were great and large. Try the middle eastern tea which was made with fresh mint. Highly highly recommended."}
{"text":"Byblos has some of the best Middle Eastern food I've ever tasted. Their falafels and Tzatziki are delicious. And the restaurant serves up an amazing tomato cream soup which will have you lapping up every last bite. This is a great lunchtime destination."}
{"text":"First time dining here. I am visiting from out of town and my family and i were expecting a good meal.  However, i cant say that was the case. For starters our drinks were TERRIBLE. I ordered a whiskey ginger ale.  They do not have ginger ale. They have soda water and pepsi that they will give to you without warning. After returning the first set of drinks we got a second drink which was supposed to be 7up and scotch. It wasnt. I don't know what it was, but it wasn't what i ordered. I couldn't taste any scotch and my drink was still a caramel color.  The owners were constantly over our shoulders begging for praise and attention.  After getting our weak drinks we got our hummus which was not terrible but i wasn't impressed.  We all ordered our food from the female half of ownership who was insistent on us ordering the lamb. None of us are plain lamb fans so after repeatedly declining her offer we were able to order. Our server went into the back to cook our food and the busser brought out our soup. The Lentil soup lacked flavor, i was upset because it looked amazing. The tomato soup was good. Not extraordinary, but good.  Next we received our meals.  Gyro salad, beef kabob, gyro kabob and some other kabob i cannot pronounce. Ground beef in the shape of a sausage-turd. Either way, the meat was very dry, in all cases and kind of unpleasant to eat. Large chunks of unexpected toughness in my meat. The rice was plain, and lacked substance. I was hungry enough where i finished my meal, i cant say the same about the rest of my company even being as hungry as we were after a long day of traveling. After warding off the owner for a fifth and sixth time, we had to ask for our check and to go boxes which we decided upon not using anyway. I was extremely disappointed from the start, and had high hopes that it would improve with our meals, but it just never did.  I will not be returning nor will i suggest this place to my friends. I was very upset with everything because i was very excited to try this place out.   I give one star for our meal, and two for service. As obnoxious as it was having the owners constantly over our shoulders we received everything in a timely manner and our specific requests were granted."}
{"text":"This is my FAVORITE Middle Eastern (or any other kind of  food) restaurant in town! I ADORE Byblos and go there every single year for my birthday. The food is amazing and they have vegetarian dishes as well as beef, lamb and chicken dishes. My personal favorite is the keufta kache kache, along with felafel, tabouli salad and Middle Eastern tea. The desserts are lovely and decadent as well. Highly recommended- family owned and operated- lovely ambiance and great food!"}
{"text":"Best Mediterranean food in the world. My friend invited to have dinner with him and I am glad I came . Service was great with the most delicious food ever. I am coming again for sure."}
{"text":"I went twice to this place. To be honest, I decided not to give it a shot after the first time, but I said it might be a bad first experience. We were a big party the first time so I almost tried most of their starters and some of their main dishes. I did not like how they serve the hummus, tabouli, main dishes, and everything else in very small quantities (unsatisfying at all).  Here are my ratings : Place & Decor: Below Average Food: Below average Service: Average Prices: below average ($$ for few food)"}
{"text":"Amazing food and amazing owners.  My husband and I discovered this place about 2 years ago and still is one of our favorites.  Try the chicken  shwarma platter! Lentil and tomato soup are awesome!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite restaurants in Arizona! Highly recommend, lamb kabob with the rice, garlic  butter dipping sauce and tomato soup. Chicken humus platter is amazing too!"}
{"text":"First time here and we loved it.  Arrived around 7:00 and belly dancing started about twenty minutes later.  Food was great, although we ate light so this might not be helpful to everyone... tried the vegetarian combo (hummus, baba ganoush, tabbouleh, lentil soup, etc.) plus a full order of hummus, and finished with baklava.  We enjoyed the flavor of everything.  My dining companion tried the beer recommended by the server (a Lebanese beer called Almaza) and liked it.  I ordered a White Russian and the strength was good.  We came specifically for the dancing and were not disappointed.  There was one dancer and she made an effort to cover the entire room so everyone could see her (we've been to other restaurants where only some tables had a good view).  She also engaged well with the audience with a lot of eye contact, and she invited participation, which was fun."}
{"text":"First of all, the owners are from Lebanon and are very good hosts. To that end, the service was very good.  I came for the Moussaka, my favorite Greek item. And they didn't disappoint, but not my favorite. They're closed for a few months of the year so the owners can go home, but when they're open, they're worth visiting."}
{"text":"Every time I come here they treat me so nice they make me feel like  I'm their family. Super nice never been treated so nice anywhere else. The food is authentic with really good flavor and presentation the chefs are good at what they do. I love this place encourage all to visit Byblos."}
{"text":"Firstly, This is my first review on yelp! Byblos inspired me to set up an account and write this review.  Onto the review then.The ambience of the restaurant is classy. They have been here in the same place for the past 25 years. The owners were really friendly and they let us know about the daily specials they have. We had the choice of a tender over roasted belly of the lamb that has been roasting for 15 hours (The lamb platter) or the lamb shank. We had both. The lamb shank was delicious. The lamb platter was the star of the night. The lamb meat was perfectly cooked, tender and full of flavor. It leaves you asking for more. Also, I never had tomato soup tasting so creamy and tasty.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I love the Mediterranean chicken . The food is very tasty and reach. Reasonable prices with great services. Everything is fresh and good here. I  coming again next week."}
{"text":"\"Wow! Best of the best Lebanese  middle eastern restaurant in Arizona  And I never forget the sweet old man and the sweet lady in that restaurant"}
{"text":"Byblos has great food.  It's a family owned business and sometimes a little quirky but not in a bad way!  The food is authentic and worth any amount of waiting (lunch they are quick, I've waited longer for dinner when they've been busy).  Definitely go for the tomato soup, it's VERY good.  Shwarma beef is also a recommendation, I've had it over 20 times.  Their hummus and tebouleh salad is also some of the best in town.  Lastly, the honey pudding simply cannot be put into words.  If you at all like anything custard/creamy/pudding-like, just order it and thank me later."}
{"text":"The food is so good but for the love of Zeus, Mister Owner, you need to retire and teach your recipes to a new generation, instead of running the floor and depending on kind favors to correct your mistakes."}
{"text":"The food here is awesome, but definitely be prepared for the host to be kind of gruff with you. However, he wasn't pushy about the specials.  As suggested, the hummus with meat and pine is hummus with beef and pine nuts and was a great appetizer.  We tried both the lentil and the tomato soup. The lentil was good, but the tomato was creamy, had basil and was my favorite of the two. We also tried the falafel as well as the gyros plate. Both were very good and very reasonably priced. Byblos is definitely getting added to the restaurant rotation."}
{"text":"I gave it 2 stars mainly because of the service! the food was okay...the service was super slow, all of the costumers were frustrated. there were 2 seniors,one of them was nice, who worked at 4 or 5 tables. i had to go to them just to get water. there was a belly dancer, who was so annoying that she gave me a headache. i don't think that the food is worth the wait..."}
{"text":"Byblos! This place is fantastic! I had been going to the Yucca Tap Room (which is a dive bar and venue a hop skip and jump down the ways) for a few years and was always curious about it. \"I should check that out someday.\" Finally a friend, that I shan't name because her betrayal is still too fresh (DAMN YOU FIDDLE R! DAMN YOU TO HELLLLLLlllll!), said, \"Hey a'hole, let's go here for lunch.\" or something like that and I replied, 'Right on, bi'ch!' or something like that and I've been in love ever since; except on Mondays (I don't like Mondays *tell me why* I don't like Mondayyys...).   Mondays the service is really bad (please note business hours). Every other time I've been (I've only done lunch, penciled that shit in and everythin', yo!) and the service was exceptional. Never you mind the previous naysayer reviews about the service being poor, those people that wrote that were obviously paid by jihadi extremists who are trying to destroy the lovely owners of Bybols because they love America. You know they love us as soon as you bite into anything they've made. The homos was the first thing to touch my lips, so creamy and warm and I swear (I don't believe in a god/s by the by) that I heard the National Anthem play with the first bite. How could someone that doesn't love America give us such wonderful food? They couldn't! PROOF! F U terrorists and mercenary reviewer bastards!  After the National Anthem finished playing (it always plays every time I eat there but this particular time I was solo) I was serve a Lebanese beer (Almaza or something like that) that the owner recommended to go with my dish which he also recommended. oh em gee golly wiz! Lamb roasted in stomach lining with rice (can't remember what the dish was called; it was a special that day) and garnish and \"to kill for\" lentil soup. So good! Forget the virgins or white grapes or whatever translation you read this dish would be reward enough in this world not to ever want to be die a martyr.  After I recovered a bit from the food coma to pay my bill and leave I stopped to convert to Islam and grab a mint or handful and joyfully walked out the door.  The care put into the few dishes I've had here seems to follow through into everything about Byblos. Please, stop by and try something, you will enjoy it more than these words can tell. There is so much I still need to love there that I have yet to even try. This being laid off and going back to school has it's draw backs. Going out for good food when ever the urge strikes you is one and strippers is the other. They're just not as friendly when the only thing in your pants is fleshy.  Support you local business especially when it's this good and loves America so much."}
{"text":"Two words: tomato soup. It's the most incredible liquid I have ever tasted in my life."}
{"text":"Service great. Food amazing. Flavor \" so fresh it explodes in your mouth\"! Have been coming here since 2000. Will continue as long as they do! Happy happy customers"}
{"text":"Didn't get a chance to eat here. We entered on a Wednesday night at 6:30. Only 3 tables had diners. We weren't greeted at the door very quickly. When we did get seated, the hostess seemed friendly enough, but then she disappeared. We had time to look at the wine list (skimpy), dessert menu (meh), and the rest of the menu (looked ok), but we hadn't been greeted by a server, asked about drink orders, or offered water. With other food options around, we did something I have rarely done: we left without ordering a thing. Disappointing. The reviews made it sound so great. The lady who seated us was unhappy that we were leaving. Don't know if I'll give this place another chance."}
{"text":"My time at Byblos was unique to say the least, and not in a bad way. This was my second time being there and both experiences were very different, but both excellent. The first time about a year ago I went during lunch time with a friend and was blown away by the service and entertainment (belly dancing). They also had a beautiful fish tank and great food.   This past week my experience was much more quiet as no one else was in the restaurant and they were about to close. They happily welcomed my girlfriend and I into their restaurant and provided outstanding service despite the proximity to closing time. The owner who is old and frail, took the time to sit down next to us and give us the specials and his opinions on all of the food to help us pick appropriately. I had the lamb and baklava for desert. Both were absolutely terrific. The fish tank was no longer there and no belly dancer but it did not change a thing for me.   I recommend for anyone considering a non-chain type restaurant, especially if you're looking for Non-American or Mediterranean food in particular."}
{"text":"We were searching for an authentic Lebanese restaurant and boy did we find one! They owner sits down at your table and takes your order. The food is amazing. The Lebanese beer, \"Almaza\" , was so tasty."}
{"text":"Love at first bite! The owner is so incredibly charming that I wish I could adopt him as a family member ! I am picky with falafel and often find it bland and flavorless..I could eat it here breakfast lunch and dinner! The fact we talked about our experience the whole drive home tells you this place is something special!"}
{"text":"Simply excellent.  Samir is an exquisite host and he goes above and beyond to ensure you enjoy your experience.  Lamb was excellent.  All the dishes had good flavor and were well presented.  This is a family owned restaurant that deserves your patronage.  Give it a try - you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I came to try Byblos Pasta, because yelp had it listed under explore the menu, but ended up ordering a gyro sandwich with fries. Great food!    P.S. Byblos Pasta doesn't exist . Yelp got that wrong."}
{"text":"With several Middle Eastern friends, I get a little picky because I get homemade food. Byblos was recommended to my boyfriend and me by a gentleman in Changing Hands who overheard me saying I missed our friend's hummus (they moved back to Israel), so we decided to check it out, and we were so happy we did!  The older gentleman who served us had a lovely accent and demeanor, and he was very helpful with choosing appetizers and entrees. The decore is a little sparse I suppose, but the food makes up for it. We had the hummus and shish-kabobs that were delicious. The hummus was as close as we've found to our Israeli friend's, so needless to say that would have been enough to captivate our senses.  We will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Great place for Lebanese and Mediterranean food. Family run atmosphere, and all freshly prepared. The hummus is tasty and creamy, everything from the grill is fantastic. I try to order a different entree on every visit,  tried the lamb last time, by far that is my favorite."}
{"text":"the hummus was a little on the oily side, but everything was great! i only wish that i could have tasted the tomato cram soup everyone raves about...my boyfriend ate it!"}
{"text":"Ok...this place is *REALLY* outdated...HOWEVER, the food was great.  The Veggie plate was gone fast (barely got to taste any of it ... wife loved it) and my Gryo plate was very good as well.  This is the ONLY other place that I've been to where the Felafel was great!  I've been to only one other place..."}
{"text":"I was disappointed with this restaurant. The atmosphere and dining environment were lovely. The food was certainly enjoyable and well prepared but portions were miniscule for the price.  I ordered the Vegetarian Combo Platter. To give you an idea, the hummus portion was probably a generous tablespoon smeared on the plate, trying to appear like a larger serving and falafel portion was only 2 small pieces. Service was almost non-existent. Waitress didn't come back to our table for over 30 minutes.  The belly dancing was a definite highlight. Amy the dancer was friendly and mesmerizing."}
{"text":"Chicken shawarma and tomato soup are to die for. 'Best in the universe' as our friendly personable waiter said and not was he right. So happy we found this place and can't wait to just keep trying the amazingness.  Here is a tip, baklava is your best friend"}
{"text":"If you need a grandpa figure in your life, look no further. You'll be greeted by the most adorable old man who will pull up a chair to your table and take your order. He will tell you that you need to order the lentil soup, and you'll agree.That lentil soup will be one of the best lentil soups you've ever had. Don't come here if you want quick, fast service. This is a place deserving of your time. I've been here countless times, and can't recommend it enough. It's a great place to bring friends and family if they are coming from out of town. I have yet to order something on the menu that I didn't enjoy. The belly dancer has a nice attitude and she'll interact with guests as much as she can, which makes for great entertainment!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ordered from here for delivery. We have been trying to find a good Mediterranean restaurant and the Yelp reviews were semi decent so decided to give it a go. We ordered hummus which is bland. Basically tasted like olive oil and the pita bread was given to us in the bag it came in because they do not make their own pita bread? Gyro was mediocre, not horrible but the Tzatziki sauce just tasted like sour cream. Giving 2 stars since it's not the worst I've ever had but FAR from the best."}
{"text":"Byblos in Tempe has been a long time favorite of mine.  Consistently great food, very reasonable prices, the owners show so much hospitality to you!  I crave their tomato soup, its incredible, while my husband could eat their hummus with meat and pine nuts all day.  I like it too though so he has to share!  Everything I have ever tried here has been so good, I feel confident that anything I order will be tasty.   Because of this, Byblos is a great place to bring guests or even larger groups.  I know that everyone can find some good choices here, and its not too overwhelming for someone who has never had ethnic foods.  At the same time, the middleeastern dishes are so good, if you are more familiar with them, you have a range to choose from.  Being able to come on a Saturday night and seat a table for six without a reservation or a long wait was nice, but I think we were fortunate.  It's a nice place for a casual dinner, or to celebrate a special occasion.  The prices are fair, so you can afford to take another couple out for dinner if you like too.   Some nights feature belly dancers, and other nights its more of a family atmosphere.  The waitstaff is very good at reading your need for either alone time with your date or interaction with your server.  Ive seen a belly dancer dance with toddlers and also had one come over to dance for my husband's birthday, always done tastefully. One great way to 'shop local' is to support local restaurants, and Im happy to say that Ive seen the owners out shopping local as well.  Its nice to see the local economy in action, and wherever I have seen them, they are always so warm and welcoming outside the restaurant too.  Go for the food, go for the experience, go for any of the many reasons and I think you will find a new favorite as well!"}
{"text":"The best lamb and home made baklava. Quiet ambience. Service is family oriented. Greek red wine completes the experience."}
{"text":"Great place to have a quiet lunch. I like to come here when I need to get some work done. Efficient wait staff and the food is better than most. Good portions, great choices of grass feed meats (lamb) and Mediterranean foods. Give beef a rest and try Byblos for some great home cooking. Would be a great choice for dinner also. The menu is terrific."}
{"text":"We came out of the theater.  Our options in lincoln road were limited.  Juvia or a few other options.  We decided to go to Biblos. We called to book, friendly answer.  We walked in and from the first moment, we felt we were at the right place.   Beautiful people, we knew a few of the tables.    The menu us very friendly, every single dish sounded provocative.  The bread with truffles was fantastic, the eggplant dumplings were airy, light, delicious dressing, crunchy on the outside.  The tomato salad was delicious. A little bit small but nicely accomplished.   Now, the branzino was the best fish I have ever had. Perfect texture, perfectly cooked, the meat was greasy and tender, just perfect.   We had many other plates, all great, but then dessert came.  I must say, after more than 20 years having had pastry shops, this chocolate hazelnut mousse was perfection.   The mix of french techniques with Lebanese influence was sublime.     The waiter, son of an american and cuban parents, was one of the best ever.   The price, worth every dollar!!!"}
{"text":"This is a great place. Lady is very friendly. Tomato Soup is excellent. Nice family atmosphere, relaxing and charming for a night out."}
{"text":"Unfortunately still in pissy mood at going 0 for 3 in last new restaurant attempts.  Once again, a brief review filled with disappointment and regret.    Started with the Spanakopita, which was labelled as a Spinach Cheese Pie for $3.95.  It was cold.  What should have been flaky heavenly goodness in the form of phyllo dough was just greasy congealed torture, which was quite impressive with how this was so damn cold.  Maybe they should've left this in the microwave longer.  Blah.  Entree that was recommended as their house specialty was their oven roasted lamb for $11.95.  It was halfway edible as the rice was sorta interesting with pine nuts for a nice crunch, but was a little dry.  And then the lamb.  It probably wouldn't be fair to say it was dry, it would be more fair to say it was Arizonan desert sand masquerading as meat.    Damnit, so disappointed again I can't even think of a witty way to end this review.  God bless the edit button, I'll have to come back with something."}
{"text":"Amazing food and the owners are very kind. I enjoyed the \"at home\" feeling the meals are second to none I highly recommend this restaurant to anybody that enjoys amazing food!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best babaganoush and hummus I have ever had across this country.  The lunch special was also to die for. I loved the lamb and green beans w such wonderful rice on the side. They served a delicious cup of tomato soup before hand that was included. I can wait to come back and try out many more dishes! Bravo!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent customer service they make you feel like family, this is the real authentic Lebanese food, hands-down the best restaurant in the area number one middle eastern food in Arizona ... everything is a fresh in the beer is importing from the original mother country everyone should give it a try."}
{"text":"BYBLOS!... YUM!!!  I am Half Middle Eastern, Half Japanese... so i grew up eating primarilly these two types of cuisines.  And i have to say Byblos is BY FAR,  The Best Middle Eastern Restaurant in Az...PERIOD.  Everything I've had so far was delicious. Oh wait, i can think of \"1 thing\" that wasn't good, their pita bread. Its obviously a store bought variety, and not freshly made. and kinda like eating cardboard...  However, everything else, mmmm, Love it. Try their... \"Hummus w/ Meat & pine\" its much tastier then the plain hummus... Their \"Tomato soup\" (to die for, & i dislike tomato soup, weird huh?)... Oh, and their Kibbe ... And the Shrimp scampi's pretty good too... Also a friend told me he loved the chicken Mediterranean (thou i haven't tried it)  So those are My top Fav's... You won't be disappointed.  i believe anyone who gave less than a 4 star rating to this exceptional restaurant, either never had middle eastern cuisine before, or does not have a sophisticated enough palette to be rating restaurants."}
{"text":"From the minute you walk in the door, Jamal and Samir--the owners--make you feel like family. Demonstrating true Arab hospitality, they take their work--and your enjoyment--personally.   I lived for 6 years in the Middle East, and yet I have rarely had Middle Eastern food (here or there) that matches the quality of Byblos. Their chicken and vegetarian dishes are outrageously good. For garlic lovers, the garlic dip is not to be missed! Although all of the desserts are great, it would be a tragedy to skip the honey pudding. Their Lemonade also is delicious--it has a hint of rosewater.  Prices are very reasonable and portions are generous. I've been coming here for years, and although it's not fancy schmancy--you can always count on having a wonderful meal."}
{"text":"Service was remarkable, gyro and sides top notch, beef stroganoff superb, lentil soup and tomato soup out of this world."}
{"text":"Byblos is a run-of-the-mill Mediterranean restaurant in desperate need of a facelift!  With a hit-and-miss menu and tall asking prices, it's obvious that Byblos still has much to learn after nearly 28 years in business!    The restaurant itself is well dated and the atmosphere inside generally feels like a retirement home lobby with booths for seating...booths that are very worn and borderline uncomfortable.  While the decor could use a serious smack with the pretty stick, the smaller size of the restaurant does make it fairly cozy for family dinners and small gatherings.    The older lady and gentleman that run the place are pleasant and good natured, but can be difficult to understand.  Obviously, this has caused several of the negative reviews, but their heavy accents do add something to the experience beyond just the obvious confusion.  One thing worth noting is that they are their own waitstaff and they clearly don't move as quickly as they used to, so service can be a bit slow if there are more than 3 or 4 tables to tend to.    On the plus side, it's easy to get prime seating on both Friday and Saturday night, because it's rarely a full house!  It's also one of the few places left in the area where you can enjoy free, live Belly Dancing during dinner on the weekends, so I give them props for supporting local talent!  Regarding the food, I will say that the lamb dishes are tasty, the complimentary mint tea is exceptionally relaxing and the soups have a genuine down-home taste to them.  However, most of the main entree items are no more than food truck quality pitas and state fair combo plates sold at a premium price.  The quality of the main ingredients just isn't there and a quick trip to the frozen food aisle at Costco would net you most of the supplies needed to start your very own \"Byblos\" franchise at home!  The desserts are tasty, but few are traditional and none of them, except maybe the baklava, appear to be made by the restaurant.  Also, the bar is limited and the wine selection is nothing short of dreary, though that doesn't stop them from asking fine dining prices on grocery store brands of alcohol.  While there's no real \"value\" in the Byblos experience, it's certainly a solid choice when you're just too tired on a Friday evening to drive somewhere else or the inlaws you hate happen to be in town and you absolutely \"must\" take them out!"}
{"text":"If you love stroganoff this place can't be beat.  I pretty much licked my plate clean!  The lamb special was perfect.  Hospitality is exceptional- they were extremely concerned that we have a good experience.   We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Very good Lebanese food tastes great and feels good to have this cuisine in town. The owners are very nice and friendly as well !!"}
{"text":"Had a lot of family in town for the holidays, some of us wanted Mediterranean food but not fast Greek food or the like.  I looked at reviews and got recommendations from friends and we decided to try Byblos.  Most of the family had never eaten Middle East, Persian, Greek etc so I was a bit afraid they wouldnt like it.  After they brought out the dolmas and the babba ganoush I knew this was a good place.  They were both delicious and I wish the portions were slightly bigger.  The soup was a tomato soup that was like pizza in liquid form, sooo freakin delicious, even people that dont like tomato soup will like this one!  The lentil soup was also tasty.  We all either had lamb or chicken dishes and everyone enjoyed their dinners.  Dessert was good, the baklava was small but the Honey Pudding was just something that I wish I could have every day!"}
{"text":"i'm only giving this place four stars because i haven't actually been in, just take out and Matthew went to go pick it up.  i must say, super delicious. the gyro i ordered was huge and meaty, just like i like it. Matthew got falafel, which i hate, but he said it was fantastic. it came with lentil soup, which was terribly comforting, although unfamiliar territory for me. it was a wonderful discovery,    they just finished remodeling, so i think it may be time to go and dine in. i'm excited."}
{"text":"Good food, especially the lamb. Byblos is a family-owned business and the food tastes like something Grandma would cook. Filling and hearty. The service is excellent and the restaurant is clean. But the decor is frumpy. If you can overlook the dowdy ambience, this restaurant is definitely worth the visit."}
{"text":"Far exceeded expectations.  The owners were very friendly, we ordered the lamb shank as recommended and it was the most tender and well flavored lamb we have ever had.  We also ordered the vegetarian platter which was very fresh and light.  Overall an amazing meal and pleasant experience.  Highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"I have never experienced such a great restaurant such a great Lebonese food! excellent flavors and seasoning and the most important stuff and the owners are so warm and wonderful they giving you this excellent feeling of being home."}
{"text":"Came here while on an Arizona visit.  This place was recommended by friends who we were dining with.  On the way over I read the reviews on YELP and was a little apprehensive.   We entered into a rather large eating area with only a scattering of tables occupied.  We were seated right away and then the owner (older gentleman) came over to tell us that they were short staffed that evening.    My apprehension increased as we were going straight to the airport after dinner.    As others have mentioned the owner pulled a chair over to our table to tell us about the 4 lamb specials.  3 people ordered the lamb and rice special, someone had a chicken dish and I had the lamb gyro platter.  Each dish came with carrot soup which was tasty, but nothing special to write home about. But the lamb dishes were great.  And I loved my gyro dish.  It had more substantial meat than you get at the places that just slice the lamb of the skewer.  And the tzatziki sauce was thick and tangy.  Some people might be put off by the stark atmosphere, but if you want good food, I recommend giving this place a try.  I'd come back again.  It is hard to find good Mediterranean food places."}
{"text":"First time here in many years but still has same charm and great food.  The tomato soup is fantastic - get a bowl!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service. The hummus is to die for and the food is to fight for. Everything is so fresh! Family owned doesnt get better than this!"}
{"text":"First time visiting this restaurant after driving by on and off for many years. Had the sampler then the lamb. The sampler was good and the lamb was ok. The lentil and tomato soup was amazing. The pita was good as well. My friend had the stroganoff for which the gravy was amazing. The staff who I assumed ran and owned the establishment were very friendly and genuine. I would go back to try a few more items."}
{"text":"Two things seemed to stand out  when I read the reviews of this place before dining here: good food, but less-than-stellar service. And that's pretty much what I experienced when I had dinner here with friends. We weren't sure how many would be in our group, but eight of us had arrived and two small square tables had been joined together for us - a good fit for six people, but a tight and only marginally acceptable fit for our party of eight. When another person called and said she would be joining, we requested that an adjoining small table be added to our joint tables, which would have also eased up our cramped arrangement. Instead, the dour old man mentioned in the other reviews grouchily insisted on just adding another setting to one end of the grouped tables, forcing two people to squeeze into that small space. This is extremely unreasonable given that all the tables around our party were empty and remained so for the time we were there; in fact, very few other people were dining in the restaurant that evening. The gentleman who took our order was a lot more friendly but gave us a strange high-pressure sales pitch for some dishes, as Jenny R. had warned in her review. I had given my order for keufta khachkach, but he kept pushing the beef stroganoff, saying that they may not have enough ingredients for my order (... huh!?) He desisted when I told him I can't have a cream-based dish (actually I can; I just didn't want another dish being pushed on me). It turned out they did have enough ingredients for my dish after all ... how 'bout that!  I must say that the food was good, and reasonably priced for the quality and quantity. And everyone in the party agreed about the quality of the food they got.  My rating for the food alone: four and a half stars; for the service alone, one and a half stars; therefore, a 3-star average. If you plan to dine here, expect good food as a reward for your putting up with the service that tries your patience."}
{"text":"I'm very sad to admit being a Tempe native and never having tried Byblos until tonight! I really can't say why because it's been there forever, our large family usually going for fast food or Mexican on the rare occasion when we ate out.  We had an AMAZING meal this evening in a very comfortable atmosphere served by lovely people that are sure you have everything you'd like without being rude or invasive to our dinner conversation.  Appetizer, soup, lamb, chicken, wine, beer, dessert, & Turkish coffee to finish...we had it all and every bite, taste, drink was delicious!   This is a new favorite and I can't wait to eat here again! We eat out several times a week nowdays,  and an establishment like Byblos is ideal not only for the delicious food but for the atmosphere that allows a family to actually dine, taking our time to enjoy our meal as well as each other's company - a novel idea, I know!  And did I say how much we enjoyed the lovely belly dancer? That was the icing on the cake for us...so fun!"}
{"text":"Love it here. Started coming a year ago. Have been 4 or 5 times now and everytime the food and service is amazing. The owners are so sweet. The tomato soup is the best I have ever had. Everytime I come I don't know why I have waited so long to come back. The honey pudding is absolutely to die for. I can't even begin to describe the flavors. I never thought pudding could be so good."}
{"text":"Delicious food! By far best authentic Middle Eastern food around. Veggie moussaka is fantastic as is the lentil and caramelized onion dish. Dessert? I dream about the shortbread pecan pie. Very nice and attentive brother and sister team that run the restaurant. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"What a waste of time. I tried to order....it took forever. My daughter and I went to enjoy a nice dinner. Instead it felt like a sriptease vibe. Not bevause of the dancer, she was great. But the men in corner table got grabby, loud and abnoxious. I felt the owner shouldve put a stop to it. It took forever to get our food. And sadly, it wasnt even what we ordered. Disappointed. Now everytime we pass, my daughter has the negative memory, and I...regret."}
{"text":"We came here on a whim after my SO decided he wanted lamb shank for dinner, and Byblos was an amazing find!  It is very conveniently located in Tempe, and while we ended up ordering our food to-go, the inside of the restaurant was clean, nicely decorated, and quite spacious.  I also really liked the fact that there was a table of older gentlemen having what appeared to be a lively meal, but they welcomed us as soon as we entered the restaurant - it really made the place feel like a family environment :)  As for the food, their portions are generous, and so delicious!  I loved everything I got to taste, and my SO said that thier's was the best lamb he'd had in Arizona so far, which is pretty high praise considering he is constantly on the hunt for lamb shank wherever he goes!  If you're in the mood for a nice sit-down meal, or just want to eat at home, definitely consider Byblos Restaurant - they're fast, friendly and most importantly, have great Mediterranean food!!"}
{"text":"Went with my wife.  Service was a wee bit slow, but the owner said that two of his staff had experienced a traffic accident on the way to work, so he was having to hold down the fort almost by himself with the assistance of one waitress.  Food was outstanding.  I have paid a great deal more for much worse food.  The pricing was excellent.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone wanting REAL Greek food."}
{"text":"In town visiting and stopped in on a Friday evening around 7pm.  The restaurant wasn't packed so we didn't have to wait.  You can expect friendly service and an owner who will make his presence known at all the tables.  Our server was well versed in all the items and timing was prompt.  We enjoyed the spinach and cheese pie, tomato basil soup, Greek salad with lamb kabob and hummus, keufta plate, and shared a piece of baklava for dessert.  The hummus was so smooth and the pitas so soft I couldn't get enough.  The lamb was pleasantly tender and juicy.  Their version of baklava was a tad dry on the top half, but when eaten with the bottom half was good.  This version also lacked cinnamon and I could really taste the rose water.   This restaurant will definitely satisfy your craving for Greek/Mediterranean/Middle Eastern food."}
{"text":"Just moved to the neighborhood.  Excited to see a good Mediterranean / Middle Eastern place on Yelp.  Started with the plain hummus, and it was fantastic.  Best I've had in Arizona by far.  We might have to try the beef combo as recommended next time.  The soups were fantastic, especially the tomato cream.  I had a special lamb roast that came with mint jelly and a fantastic rice bed.  My girlfriend had the moussaka.  Both were perfectly seasoned and cooked.  It's sad to think that the lamb I had was only a special and not a constant menu item!  Fantastic staff, extremely knowledgeable and proud of their food.  We'll be back.  Can't wait to try the shawarma."}
{"text":"We loved the food! The service was fantastic. The owners made us feel very welcome, even our 8 year old daughter.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Go in prepared to get the stink-eye if you don't order their specials or if you indicate you don't eat lamb. We're vegetarian and there are some amazing choices for us, but their rudeness is intolerable. Service is hit or miss. If they are the least little bit busy, they all start running around like chickens with their heads cut off. They seriously lose it. We went in one night with two small (extremely well-behaved) children and they seated several parties before us, while continuing to say, \"Are you sure they like this kind of food? This is a quiet restaurant\" every time the owner came by, and when I said, \"Yes, they like your food, and actually we've been here many times,\" I got an eyeroll and another party seated before us. I guess I'm just past the point in my life where I'm able to deal with surly, rude service in order to have a good meal. We won't be back. If you decide to brave it, definitely try to soups, they're fantastic. As an aside, their parking lot is tiny. If you drive a bigger car or have trouble getting in and out of tight spaces, there is plenty of extra parking around the back. Lock your doors. It's creepy there at night."}
{"text":"I've been going to Byblos for about 5 years. They have some amazing food. The lentil soup is dream worthy. However I recently took a friend who had not been there before. We sat down and decided what to order. I wanted the falafel wrap, and she wanted the chicken Mediterranean. The owner came to take our order, he advised us of the specials, one was lamb and one was chicken. I told him i wanted to order the falafel. He berated me about my choice and told me that i should have the chicken special. I stood my ground and said that I wanted falafel. He then stated that next time, hopefully i will make a better decision. My friend stated that she wanted the chicken Mediterranean, the owner argued with her until she said 'fine i will have the chicken special'. WOW! When our food came out, my falafel was good as usual. My friends \"chicken special\" was bland and rubbery. I think he was just trying to pawn off the pre-made special of the day."}
{"text":"Omg the food is to die for. I am so happy I stumbled upon this place. This place is AMAZING"}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite middle eastern restaurant.  I have only been there 2 or 3 times, but for some reason I'm always treated like family.  The place has never been crowded and you get individual attention from the waiter/owner.  Everything on the menu from soup to shawarma is top notch.  The only downside to Byblos is that they do not make their own pitas from scratch as they are regular ole store bought ones :("}
{"text":"The tomato soup is amazing. We found this restaurant on our way to the airport and I can't wait to come back for the lamb. So good!"}
{"text":"Two of my best meals so far in Tempe. I love Lebanese food, and this did not disappoint. Ate here twice on most recent stay in Tempe. Mostly delicious, lovely atmosphere and lighting, friendly family owners, and nice belly dancing the second visit. Enjoyed their dolmas, lamb shank special (moist and falling from the bone), tomato soup, kibbe (delish!), and the salad with lamb kebab and hummus (would definitely order again). Lebanese friend was underwhelmed by the bland veggie moussaka but loved the kibbe, and big thumbs-up on the m'jadara. I look forward to returning on next visit to try the loubieh and foul and revisiting the lamb kebab. Don't let the male owner talk you into anything you don't want to eat - he was a little high pressure on the lamb specials the second go-round, but the kebabs are also delicious."}
{"text":"Amazing amazing amazing!!! I had the beef stroganoff and it was to die for. I sampled everyone's food at my table honestly and all was so good! Lamb shank, hummus, falafel platter. Their tomato soup, the lentil dish that starts with an M...? Service was so friendly. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Our favorite Mediterranean restaurant for the past twenty years.  The lamb special is the best, made with meat that was slow roasted for 8-hours prior.  Tomato soup to die for, lentil soup to fight for!  It is family owned and operated."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place.  Good service, and great food.  Always get food pretty fast, and the food is nothing less of delicious.   I get the chicken shwarma, with the tomato soup.  THE TOMATO SOUP IS THE BEST SOUP ON EARTH.   For appetizer I get the garlic dip, or the hummus and it's SO good.  I give this restaurant 5 stars, and I find myself craving this place once a week!"}
{"text":"Good food takes time and people who care. Be patient and you will be handsomely rewarded! This isn't your little hipster Greek style restaurant, this is the real deal!  Get the tomato soup, the mousaka, get a Greek beer or a Greek wine and enjoy a great dinner!"}
{"text":"For a special occasion, there is no better place to go than this great Lebanese restaurant. The owners are such wonderful people. They always recognize your and your family when you come in to visit - even if it's only a few times a year. There is always the lamb special - leg of lamb stuffed with a blend of rice, pine nuts, and almond slivers roasted for 5-7 hours until it's falling off the bone. The lamb is served on a bed of the rice and has SO much flavor. My father always enjoys the lamb shank - in a beautiful tomato-based sauce. The meat is always tender and scrumptious.  I almost forgot to mention the soup! If you are lucky enough to get there on a night when they have the tomato soup, DO IT! The lentil is also quite tasty, however. Don't forget dessert...they make a delightful pudding with rosewater and sprinkled with crushed pistachios and drizzled with honey. Oh man..."}
{"text":"This rating is for service. Was greeted promptly and quickly shown to a table where we waited & waited & waited. No water. No service. Left an went somewhere else."}
{"text":"Just had an amazing meal at Byblos. This has to be one of the best restaurants in Phoenix. It serves the standard Mediterranean/Greek/Lebanese items, but each dish I sampled surprised me by how good it was. Truly exceptional! Everything is fresh and home-made and exquisitely balanced and tasty. The owner said they've been around for 32 years, and I'm glad we finally found it. We'll be back again, soon."}
{"text":"One of the absolute best Lebanese places I have ever been to.  I used to never eat lamp.  The old man once suckered me into ordering his \"special\" ... oven roasted lamb shank.  I was glad he did cause I have eaten lamb ever since.  LOL.  That old man is the used car salesman of food."}
{"text":"Such good food!!! The lamb is some of the best in town! Also the service is wonderful! I think we had the owner and he was so nice!"}
{"text":"Our 1st time here.  Warm friendly atmosphere!    I am not a Greek food eater.. the menu was rather extensive.  My son had a gyro sandwich , plain and dry!  My hubby had the full version of gyro sandwich! He rather enjoyed the tomato soup!  I am alergic to tomatoes so I could not eat the soup.  I chose not to eat and I think I might have offended the owners.  I just couldn't eat!  So now, my hubby and son enjoyed the food and we will come back when I am hungry!!   So please come by and enjoy the rich warm atmosphere and good good!"}
{"text":"Came here only because all other Mediterranean places were closed, so we ended up at this dated  restaurant in the armpit of Tempe. We sat down and were given a menu. My friend and I were both looking for kebabs. Before we could even read a word on the menu, the owner approached and starts a long winded description of his four specials. We tell him we just want kebabs and hummus dip and asked him to locate it on the menu. He tells us not to order the kebabs, even though that it was our final decision, and pushes his most expensive lamb dish on us. He pressured and grilled us for a few minutes, and kept rudely discouraging us from ordering the hummus and the kebabs we tried to order. We almost just ordered the expensive lamb \"special\" to get him away. We knew what we wanted, why did he have such a problem with it.   We politely insisted that he place the order for what we were craving, kebabs. He was a bit annoyed at this point, and he proceeded to try to get me to upgrade my hummus to the beef hummus - but I just wanted plain. He didn't like my hesitation but he just finally let me order my plain hummus. A little while later, our dishes arrive. The meat was decent. The hummus I begged for was ok, but the pitas were dry and cold.   While eating, the owner comes up to the table and was being very rude to me when I tried to compliment the chicken. Bitter about me declining the special and ordering something cheaper perhaps? After 30 something years in business, you would think one would learn how to deal with customers. Hey I'm sure the guy means well, but Jesus, politely recommend something and move on - don't pound us into submission.   Overall, this was a troublesome experience and I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Great spot for Mediterranean.  I managed to have a few items off the appetizer menu as well as an entree and thoroughly enjoyed every dish.  The service was exceptionally friendly and the food was tasty and carefully prepared.  I highly recommend Byblos and definitely look forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"I ordered my food to go. I got the falafel appetizer plate and Greek salad.  Everything was fresh and delicious. Also, 3 different workers greeted me pleasantly when I was there only shortly to pick up my food. Customer service like this is a dying breed so I will definitely be back to dine-in in the future."}
{"text":"Top of the line home cooked food at its best! Super good food coming from a person who grew up with this kind of food. Clean and great customer service, you got my business!"}
{"text":"I love this mom and pops owned restaurant. Two of my good friends have been eating at byblos for years and always spoke wonderful things about it. About a month and a half ago my husband and I ordered some food to-go and were pretty happy with our experience. The hummus is wonderful and the falafel is the best I've found in the valley thus far. The gyro meat is a bit thicker and a different consistency than I'm used to, but it was tasty. The soup was really great too. This place got three stars because I think the gyro meat could possibly improve a little, and the inside of the restaurant is really dated."}
{"text":"Great family-owned business. The service was very good - the owner sat down, asked about our food preferences, and discussed the menu/specials. Everybody was very friendly and helpful. The food was delicious and vegetarian-friendly. We got the vegetarian moussaka and keufta kebab with two orders of baklava. The rice pilaf and soup that came with our orders were also amazing"}
{"text":"We both enjoyed the Almaza. Berr from Lebanon. Then the Lentil soup. I had the Pepper Steak which was amazing with a side of yummy rice. The beef stroganoff was delicious as well!  Great service!! Will be back again soon!"}
{"text":"I have driven by Byblos so many times and was looking forward  to join the International Supper Club UYE in September, the front parking lot is extremely small, but there is parking in the back, and it's a lot bigger on the inside then you would, ok I, assumed it to be.   We all were seated and handed menus and the owner was giving us a very detailed list of the specials they had going, and was even ready to take our order right then and there, but we told him we needed a few more minutes, so he said he would be back in 5, and he was.   I already knew what I wanted, I ordered the Falafel Sandwich, it came with soup & fries. There as 2 choices of soup, lentil and tomato or as the owner put it, fight for or die for. I went with the Lentil soup, I love lentil soup but after the order was placed he came back and apologized for the mistake and it was chicken noodle soup or tomato, so now I went with tomato soup.  He said it was to die for! Well let tell yall, that tomato soup was creamy, full of flavor and well maybe it was to die for! I'm not much of a soup person but I could see me having a nice warm bowl of that on a cold day.   The falafel wrap was good to, I had been craving falafel and this hit the spot.    Good food, great company, great time! Look forward to the next ISCUYE."}
{"text":"3 of us ate a great dinner here. Authentic food, delicious,  friendly owner,  good prices. Full bar.  We loved it."}
{"text":"Food is absolutely delicious and also well priced considering the fresh homemade ingredients and the certainly ample portions! Went with my mom and we each started with the soup of the day - lentil - which was creamy and flavorful. It came to the tank at the proper temperature which is important to me with soup. I HAD to try their tzatziki so I ordered a gyro plate (boring, I know) but the lamb was absolutely amazing and very flavorful. The fresh pita was warm and fluffy and I also loved the taboule on the side. The tzatziki, while fresh tasting, is not the best I've ever had. It was good though. My dish also had rice pilaf on the side which I found to be a bit bland but my mom enjoyed it.   My mom got the special of the day - slow cooked lamb shank. It literally fell off of the bone. She loved it and also enjoyed her fresh pita and grilled veggie medley that came with the dinner. She did not like her rice, but I loved it so we traded. Hers was a mixture of rice, pine nuts, and ground beef. Great!  Would go here again if I was in the area. Place is very cute inside. Only negative for me for the waiter/possibly owner who stood next to the table while we counted our money for the bill and discussed the tip. Very rude and not appreciated. Otherwise a good experience."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE! By far the best tomato soup EVER! The service is awesome, very nice owners. The hummus is great. I come here as often as I can. Good atmosphere and great food. 5 thumbs up for me!"}
{"text":"Nice place with good food.  The staff here seems like a nice family who are very friendly.  Quiet, nice, and not expensive as well."}
{"text":"A precious restaurant. The interior design is gorgeous and the most appealing is the service provided by the employees, definitely authentic and attentive.   Plus you leave with the best Baklavas in the entire valley! Nothing as delicious as these Arab Pastries, I am reassured these are THE go to dessert."}
{"text":"Lamb shank heaven!!  So tender, delicate & juicy.  Melts in your mouth.  Knife not needed.  Also had beef moussaka.  Very hearty but not heavy.  Tender eggplant  bursting with flavor.  Rice pilaf was so moist and fluffy.  Creamy tomato soup was like nothing we have ever had before.  So delicious.  Lentil soup was very hearty and good.  1st time to dine here.  Owners are very kind and appreciate our patronage.  We will gladly return when we want delicious Mediterranean home cooking."}
{"text":"ABSOLUTE FAVORITE PLACE TO EAT!!! Definitely worth the $$. Lunch time the meals are same portion for half price so sometimes I end up doing that on weekends"}
{"text":"It's an annual thing, visiting Byblos for Susanna A's birthday gathering, and for this, the 4th or 5th time, another quality dining experience.  Over the years I've sampled from the gyro platter, the keufta khachkach, schwarmas, and roast chicken, on up to last night's \"Mediterranean Chicken\", a pleasing chicken in sauce, for me spread over a bed of soft, perfectly cooked rice, accompanied by a cup of satisfyingly homemade tasting tomato soup: $11.95 +$2 iced tea, tax & tip and out for well under $20.    Dining area is pleasant, fairly large, has both booths and tables not too close together.  Comfortable and uncramped, middle eastern music playing softly in the background. White tablecloths and cloth napkins add a nice touch.  The older gentleman took our orders, his bad knees forcing him to sit while he did so, but just made for more homey experience as he engaged in brief light conversation, gently encouraging \"the lamb\", but which tonight we all shied away from in favor of less expensive fare.  Other staff delivered our plates, filled and refilled our water and tea glasses.  Our party of 6 was well-served and glasses never had a chance to be dry for more than a few seconds if at all.  Several of us shared a bite of Susanna's chocolate cake, met all hopes and expectations, qualifying as \"scrumptious\" all around.  I've had their baklava in the past and it too was not disappointing, a moist honey-drenched delight as opposed to the petrified dehydrated shredded wheat like offering you'll occasionally find elsewhere if not fresh.  The restrooms are towards the back of the dining room through the swinging double-doors, ladies to the left, men to the right.  The men's room is attractive but nothing \"fancy\".  It was and has always been on my visits, clean.  It's of decent size and un-cramped, with  one stall, one urinal, sink and mirror, and a new automatic paper towel dispenser.    All in all another very pleasant dining experience I'd encourage anyone to try. Though much of the menu is closer to $20 than my satisfying Med Chicken, barring too many extra drinks, I think you'd be hard-pressed to make the tab exceed $30 a person, and I believe you will be satisfied with the quality of the fare for your funds.   It's a family business with sister as chef, and brother out front.  Belly dancing by neither on Saturday nights."}
{"text":"The owner was nice but very pushy on me ordering the specials. They didn't have what I wanted (grilled chicken burger) so I went with a falafel which seemed to upset him. My order came with soup, I chose lentil. That was very good. The falafel however was just not good at all. My tastebuds just could not agree with the sauce or ingredients."}
{"text":"This place has old school decor and vibe but it's what I enjoy about it! A friend recommended it so we stopped by for lunch on a Saturday. He only eats hummus from this restaurant and I can see why, it's so creamy and delicious! I couldn't stop eating it. I ordered the Greek salad with Chicken and garlic sauce. Started off with the lentil soup that was delicious, the lentils were pureed which I liked. I don't like large pieces/chunky veggies in my soup so this worked out perfectly.  The salad was okay, they were really nice when I asked for it without tomato. My only issue was the amount of vinagrette/oil that was added. It made my lettuce soggy and was just unappetizing towards the end of my meal. I liked the chicken and charred red peppers, the garlic sauce is awesome! my husband and his buddy ordered chicken dishes and they were cooked very well with great flavors.  The owners were so nice and personable, I like that level of customer service and it really makes a difference when it comes to choosing a restaurant. Overall a great experience and I'd definitely return."}
{"text":"Best restaurant EVER! I have been going here since I was two years old. The owners of the restaurant are family now. The service is always personable (even when we bring people that they don't know)! Also...the food is AMAZING. We crave it all the time. Get the tomato soup! You won't regret it! They are willing to help with any kind of diet restrictions :)  EAT HERE! NOW!"}
{"text":"This was a great new dining experience for us.  It is a mix of Greek, Lebanese food.  The owner was our waiter and gave great direction on what the specials were, what he felt would be something we should try.  His sister was in the kitchen making the food so I felt a little like I was in their home despite the restaurant setting.  I had the Lamb osso bucco, it was fantastic, with brown rice, herbed potatoes, & veggies. We also had the falafel, which Christopher loved. It was very good.  The humas with minced beef and pickle was also fantastic.   We had chose this restaurant based on the online reviews and it was close to where an out of town guest was staying but we will be back.  They did all they could to satisfy us and made the promise at our table that if we did not like it we did not pay for it.  They ever brought items we did not order for us to try.  Desert was just ok, they claim to have the best carrot cake you have ever had but, meh... I've had better.  One of the reviewers here on yelp recommended that you order the Lebanese beer, I did. I am passing the recommendation on to you.  GET the Lebanese beer!  It went perfect with the meal. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Walking in, you know you are up for an experience. The interior feels like it would have when this place opened in 1984. The owner waited on our table and knew the menu well.   The soups were the best part of the meal. The tomato soup had the most eye opening flavor combo, I wish my Mom had made it like this when I was growing up.  We ended up trying the mixed meat special. It had a chicken kabob, beef kabob, and some lamb. The chicken was hands down the best of the three. It was only mildly over cooked. The beef had a tough texture and tasted mildly of funk. The lamb was flavorless. Even soaking it in cucumber sauce couldn't save it. I used the rice to cleanse my palate. The rest of the customers were repeat visitors and were excited for their meals. I've had better Greek food at my local festivals."}
{"text":"First time trying this place out and it really hit the spot. It's family owned, and has been running successfully for 30 years now! The old guy is the sweetest, funniest, and most proud person you'll ever have as a waiter. The creamy tomato soup really is to die for. Their specials are amazing, I had the lamb and rice off one of the specials and tried a few different appetizers. Everything is just delicious! If you want healthy authentic or ethic food, try this place. Definitely going back soon!"}
{"text":"Nicer inside than you'd expect from the outside. I went mid-afternoon on a weekday and it wasn't busy.  The server helped me find vegetarian options on the menu and made recommendations, which I appreciated.  The place was very clean and the food came out quickly.  Everything was fresh and nicely presented.  The lentil soup was a little too salty for me, but probably fine for most people. I also got a Greek salad (good light dressing) and a side of falafel, which was cooked perfectly and wasn't greasy at all."}
{"text":"The word of the day... Soup! It's tomato soup (not my favourite usually) but this is hands down the best tomato soup I have ever had.  My biggest concern is that the bowl is empty way to fast! Bigger bowls please.  Now main course. Lamb.  If Mary had a little lamb, like the story says, Mary would bring it here to get served.  Fall off the bone tender over rice.  I was going to post a picture,  but my fork kept getting in way"}
{"text":"Lamb shanks hands down the best in the valley and is a must try. Lamb platter is also pretty good. Dont forget to try their Chocolate icecream and chocolate cake. Their tomato and lentil soup are tasty as well."}
{"text":"We often joke at work calling their tomato soup pizza soup.  It is the best soup in the history of mankind.  It's like they walked across the street picked up a Venezia's pizza a puréed it.  It is fantastic.  The gyro sandwich is great too."}
{"text":"My wife had a great dinner. We both had the creamy tomato soup for starters and it was excellent. My wife had the vegetarian sampler for her entree and I had the chicken cordon bleu. Both meals tasted great...two thumbs up. For desert we had the honey pudding. There's a reason Byblos has been around for a long time. Their food is very good as was the service. We'll be back."}
{"text":"super clean, friendly, delicious food. I had fish with rice . it was great. my wife ordered beef kabob also good was great. this place is a hidden trearur. every body should try it"}
{"text":"Wonderful. From the second we walked in the two owners Husband and Wife made us feel welcomed. Samir came over to tell us the Specials. We ordered Hummus with Chicken which was to die for! We also had the Tomato soup before dinner which was so delicious. For dinner with had the Lamb Special. A 6hr roasted lamb stuffed with rice and a wonderful sauce.   Was so delicious and fresh. So friendly and affordable. I already can't wait to come back and we haven't even gotten our check yet!"}
{"text":"It's been close to a year since we've last visited Byblos.  The lamb shanks here are so delicious, and they are served over brown rice studded with nuts.  I never have to twist my Mom's arm to dine here.  We both love the tomato bisque (\"to die for\"), although it's been two years since I've had it due to food allergies.  The hummus was good everytime we've gone, and I really like how it's served with wedges of tomatoes and a couple of cornichon (?) pickles.  We always ask for warm, toasted pitas.  Reading over the recent reviews, I wonder if management have switched to lower-quality ingredients?  The chicken kabobs are pretty tasty, as well, but do try their lamb shank dinners!  I'd skip the desserts here.  I do have two complaints: This venue ALWAYS reeks of sanitizer; at least on all four or five times we've visited.  It's a really huge turn-off.  Another is the surly service from the much older man.  I used to think it was just a culture difference, but now I just think he's not happy working there.  The restaurant could use a designer to spruce up the counter setting a bit.  As it stood a year ago, the entrance hallway looks more like an office in a decrepit building more than a space where customers wait to be seated and desserts are displayed.  On a postive note, the women's restroom was clean whenever I had to use it."}
{"text":"This was our first time here (definitely not our last!) What a wonderful place to eat. From the moment we walked in, it was like we were their favorite customers. Samir, the owner, took our order. We took his recommendations and ordered the lamb shank and the Mediterranean chicken. Both came with soup. The lentil was very good. The tomato soup was the BEST I have ever had!!! So creamy and flavorful. I grew up Catholic and had my share of tomato soup every Friday during Lent, so this is not a soup that I would normally order.  I could have eaten a gallon of it! The lamb shank was SO TENDER! It fell off the bone. And the chicken was delicious!  And then Samir brought us the pudding (on the house). We would never have ordered it (cakes & pies are our \"go to\" desserts) but will order it next time! It's made with rose water...a very creamy and light dessert.  Of course we couldn't help but order a few Lebanese beers and a shot of Ouzo.  We will for sure be going back! Derek & Gail"}
{"text":"Great food.. Great service.. The owners took very good care of me and my bf. The waiter was very attentive and friendly. We had the hummus with meat for an appetizer ..came with pita bread..very yummy. I had the chicken sharwerma plate. It was not what im used too in Jordan but there version was also delicious.  The tomatoe soup was excellent the best ive ever had. My bf had the lamb special. Very tasty. I will be coming back here very soon =) & telling everyone to visit this place."}
{"text":"A family run Mediterranean restaurant that has been a favorite of ours for years. My husband and our sons love the lamb specials, but have also enjoyed the stroganoff, gyros, and the vegetarian platter.  My favorite from my first visit has been the Chicken Shawarma. So amazingly good!!  Service is attentive, but not lightening fast. You will be treated like family - well loved family at that! Come with good company and enjoy the great food."}
{"text":"Average food with a long waits. My friend said great, then good food. I still think average. Other friends says eh food.   I think servers weren't here today? Soup was good. Drinks came at the end of the meal. Yes, the end.   I wouldn't return.   We all ate gyros. Average."}
{"text":"The service was great, the food came out quickly, and my meal was delicious. The environment is very much like a family owned place. I loved it. Definitely give it a try."}
{"text":"Walked in 2pm-ish, place was empty.  After some time an older gentlemen slowly approached, stopped, and stared, silently.  I mustered the courage to ask if they were open.  \"Yes\", he said, offering no further syllables.  The stare-down continued for another moment, then he turned, picked up a menu on his way past the bar and proceeded to walk towards the back, and so I followed, undeterred.  \"Thank you\" I said, hoping to turn the mood.  Sadly, my efforts proved fruitless.  Was it something I said?  Was it the way I parked my car?  My choice of hat, perhaps?  We'll never know, as I decided I had seen enough and exited with my craving for a gyro unsatisfied.  Happily I found joy just around the corner in a chile relleno."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to Byblos in a long time, but I remembered it as being good.  So it was great to stop in tonight and try one of the lamb specials, the ouzi lamb, the meat cooked in a special way for 4 hours, the superb tomato soup (wonderful), and I ordered an appetizer of hummus also.  Very delicious!  The owner is getting up there in age but he still comes around and talks to everybody, and the kind chef------she comes out too and makes recommendations.  The vibe of the place is very comfortable.  I'll start eating at Byblos regularly, I'm thinking.  You just walk out the door thinking, \"That was really nice.\""}
{"text":"The food is spectacular! My family has been going to Byblo's for at least 16 years. Their family style, quality and service never waivers. I would highly recommend this place! We always start with the Hummus with Meat & Pine Nuts. My son loves the lamb platter. I've tried both the lamb and beef kababs. Both are excellent. If you live in Tempe, you must try this place."}
{"text":"This is a little gem in the desert that we only found yesterday. We wanted authentic 'mediterranean food not another pita chain restaurant so took a chance and drove from Cave Creek to eat here. I have to say it's the best gyro I have ever had and I went to Greece and ate one. We had an appetizer and followed with desert. Best ever. The couple who own it are so very nice. We talked at our table about how they make everything homemade there from scratch. If I could give this a 10 star I would. Go support this place, you won't be sorry ."}
{"text":"I consider my self an expired in the mediterranean food and I can say for sure that this restaurant one of the best. I highly recommend the oven roasted lamb. The restaurant has very nice atmosphere and great service. Price kind of expensive though."}
{"text":"Came here for late dinner with my husband. Been here before. Always good.   The owner is from Lebanon and is a very friendly and nice person.   I recommend to end whatever you end up eating with the honey pudding with pistachios. Literally one of the best desserts I've ever had. It's so simple, light in flavor, and delicious. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Best soup ever! I saw the other reviews and yes the server (the only server) is elderly and wobbles but he is not unfriendly just misunderstood I believe.... OK so here is what I always have there, the tomato soup (a wonderful creamy tomato soup that is to die for and please don't put those unsavory crackers in....) then I would go for an order of fries and garlic dip so yum! then the chicken sandwich that is garlic infused and amazing!!! I've also had their moussaka and was impressed as well as the shawarma beef which was excellently seasoned and marinated. You won't be disappointed but look beyond the surface on this one. Also on some Fridays they have  belly dancing shows..... so great for a night out with a large group! check it out!"}
{"text":"This place was so weird!  I had heard good things from friends (and other Yelpers) but I was so disappointed!  My fella and I went for lunch on a Saturday afternoon and were the only customers there (!?).  We were shown to a table by a unfriendly gentleman who did not smile or greet us in any way.   He returned to take our order, gave us a cold glare to tell us that he disapproved of our choices, and then wandered off to the kitchen.  We could hear him yelling at the cook to \"make sure to make my vegetarian lasagna WITHOUT meat in it\"... yeah, thanks, I would appreciate that.  Eventually he brought us our food, scowled, and left us alone for the rest of our meal.  What was up with this old man?  Who ran over his puppy?  Also, someone was fiddling with the music in the place, eventually deciding we should all listen to hip-hop.  :|  The food was tasty, but the experience ruined it.  I won't be coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. Top 2 med/greek places i've been. Sweet family owned. Support!  We started w/ a hummus diced beef app w pita that was excellent. I had a slow cooked lamb and brown rice w pine nuts dish that was excellent. My buddy had a tomato soup (which i tried) that was so good. Followed by a chicken w/ a red pepper creme sauce. It was also really good."}
{"text":"I met Yelpette's Georgie S and Sunny B today for lunch and was pleasantly surprised by the experience. In addition to famously amazing company, the food was really good, we had quick and efficient service and I was happy with the portions and price.   We started with Hummus, which came out immediately. It was pretty tasty. Both Sunny and I had the falafel pita/ sandwich. I was really impressed with how moist the falafel was. Normally it comes out really dry. We also got soup with our meal. I had tomato, which was EXCELLENT and she had the lentil. I forgot to ask how it was. Georgie had some chicken and rice thing which looked good and she said she enjoyed.   Our server was a little aggressive with Georgie and Sunny because they didn't finish all of their food (yeah... I'm a big pig and devoured everything in front of me) but I think he was just trying to ensure they were happy with their meals.   For the three of us plus the takeaway chicken sandwich for my sister, the $34 tab was extremely reasonable and they handled our multiple payment methods like a champ!   Next time I am in Tempe and in the mood for some falafel, I will be back!!!"}
{"text":"The chicken shawarma was awesome.  Very well seasoned.  The tomato soup that came with the meal was great too."}
{"text":"Byblos might be considered by some to be the oldest city in the world, but to me, it's one of the BEST, BEST, BEST places to get a damn falafel pita in AZ.   It's just a small little restaurant, but it's fantastic. Oh the vegetarian moussaka, the greek salad, the feta dip- how I miss you.  It's just so far away from where I live now, that I never got over to that side of town and it breaks my heart.  I know this restaurant has won all kinds of \"Best of\" awards, but I'm not sure for what exactly, but no matter what you choose, I'm positive you'll love this place too."}
{"text":"This was a terrible experience!!! The owner made everything extremely awkward from basically the moment that we sat down. Before we even had a minute to look over the menu, the owner pulled a chair up to our table & started rattling off his 4 specials. The owner basically pressured us into ordering one of these specials and said that we looked \"wary\" and told us that they had the \"best food in town\". In actuality, the owner was overbearing and we just wanted to order what we wanted to order (I wanted a gyro but he made me get the lamb).  I thought the food was moderate, but would not recommend ordering the lamb. Further, the owner made comments about us using the Entertainment coupon. It's like if you don't want people to use it then don't offer it? All in all, I would not recommend this place as I had one of my most uncomfortable dining experiences ever here."}
{"text":"One of my favorite middle eastern restaurants in the valley! YUM!  Sister and brother owned, this family restaurant offers a loving atmosphere and handmade and authentic food.  We have come here countless times, and every time we are greeting lovingly. They treat all their customers with care; stopping by and checking if things are okay. The service can be a bit slow at times, but the brother and sister and always running back and forth from the kitchen, and the table cleaner works very hard, is super friendly, and helps out the owners when they are busy.  I don't think we've had anything from the menu that has disappointed us. The hummus, babaghannouj, fool (LOVE it), and tabouli (taboule) are all amazing to start with or have as sides. Scratch that... all of the appetizers are homemade and delicious. You could make a meal out of all the starters.  Be sure to get some lentil soup with your entree (can be a tad salty sometimes), and if they have some homemade dessert, make sure to end your visit with some baklava.  The lamb kebabs we always get; you get a ton of food in each entree, including rice and hummus (if you don't like a lot of olive oil make sure to ask for hummus and babaghannouj to be served without olive oil drizzled on top).  For a good sampling, get a bunch of appetizers to split (vegetarian combo platter is a good place to start), and for the entree the Byblos Mixed grill offers lamb, chicken, and keufta (ground and spiced meat) kabobs.  Despite coming here so many times, we still have many things we want to try. The problem is wanting to get the same delicious meals we got the previous visit instead of trying new ones!  Byblos will not disappoint! I would recommend calling ahead to make sure they are open. Lunch and dinner are served, but Tuesday through Saturday they close at 3:30pm and reopen for dinner service at 5:00pm. They are closed Mondays, serve dinner only on Sundays, and usually have a week or two in July/August when they close for vacation."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in the valley. The food is delicious. The chicken Mediterranean is my favorite. We also love the owners. They treat us like family."}
{"text":"Best Mediterranean food we have ever had! The atmosphere and service is top notch:) we recommend letting the owner order for you!"}
{"text":"This place sucks.  Now I understand that's not the most helpful assessment, so I'll elaborate to save you from ending up at this crap hole should you think, \"Oh Erica, you must have just been cranky that day!\" Not so.  It all started when I had a craving for hummus earlier this week. I work too far from just about every hummus slinging place in Tempe but Byblos. So I decided to try something new, and was left with a sour taste in my mouth.  First off, the place is located in a shitty plaza of decaying shops (home to the Yucca Tap Lounge if that's any indication) and it's right next door to a Mexican food restaurant that I've never seen anyone enter or leave, so it looks like a front for some shady 'business' dealings. But my craving would not be deterred by a craptastic plaza, after all, Capistrano's is in the same plaza and it's delicious. Looks aren't everything. Hummus would be had.  We enter. It's empty and dumpy looking. The only people here have a mean age of 70. We significantly bring this average down. Waaaay down. We are escorted to a table and peruse the menu. The server (I assume it's the unfriendly server you had, Kelly B., because he looked like he had a stick up his ass that had been festering there for the past 60 years) took our drink orders and came back with two itsy bitsy little cups. Seriously? You're going to charge me 2.50 for six ounces of lemonade? We order. He frowns for the umpteenth time in our short interaction and waddles off to the kitchen. The food arrives.  The hummus was straight up GROSS, and the pita bread was shockingly similar to cardboard. The hummus tasted sour with a texture that was a combination between chalk and paste. If I can corner a five year old, I'm going to conduct a taste test between the two substances and see if there's any discernable difference. My money's on no. The presentation was nice, with pickles, tomatoes, olive oil and parsley, but if I wrap a piece of dried up dog shit in ribbons and bows, your gift would still be a piece of dried up dog shit. Maybe you could use it as a paper weight?   The tomato soup that came along with lunch was pretty decent,and the gyro meat was well spiced. But the fact that my gyro was wrapped in the aforementioned cardboard pita bread was really unappetizing. It's like they took rock hard, stale pita bread, heated it in the microwave to make it pliable, molded it and let it cool in its rigid formation.   So if you're 70 and your senses are slowly numbing, you might like this place. Other than that, stay away. It's unwelcoming and unappetizing. The antithesis of what a restaurant should be. Let it slowly decay along with the rest of the shops lining this creepy little plaza at the corner of Mill and Southern."}
{"text":"I love this place, the owner and his sister run the restaurant and they both are very warm and sweet. The food is very authentic and tasty. I often go there to eat and I always tell everyone about this restaurant. I hope to see them run it for a lot longer."}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday dinner because of the belly dancing entertainment they had.  The restaurant was empty upon arrival, but we were seated very quickly by the owner.  The owner and his wife are very friendly. He was very informative in explaining all the menu items and specials, and even recommended a Lebanese beer to try.  The appetizers came out quickly. We ordered the hummus to start which was made very well and had an addicting flavor. Their pita bread tasted a bit more authentic than most places and complimented the hummus.  The lentil soup that came with the meal was excellent, I wish it was larger because I could have eaten a huge bowl of it.  Soon after the appetizers the belly dancer started, she was very friendly and was very good at the same time. Even brought up the birthday girl to the front and danced with her.  Our food came out in adequate time. I ordered the combination kabob plate. All the meat was very tender and extremely juicy. The rice pilaf had amazing flavor and everyone at the table loved it.  At the end of the meal I ordered a cup of coffee which was pretty much the icing on the cake for me, and instantly made me a fan of this place.  For a place that has been here 30 years I am surprised I have never steeped foot in here before. I can guarantee I will step foot in this place again very soon."}
{"text":"Summary for A.D.H.D readers:  * Tomato soup is the best I have ever had * The restaurant was lonely and located in a shady area * The server was very kind, but a little pushy on insisting drinks and dessert * The gyro meat was a little too greasy for my taste, but everything else tasted fresh * Fast service, clean tables, and authentic Greek music playing * Prices range from $12+ for entrees, but they are large portions and come with soup   Full Review:  Yes, the tomato soup is the best I've ever had.  The restaurant is located in a shady area, but I was not too intimidated since it was right on the side of the street and well-lit.  Upon entering, I was shocked that there weren't more people eating there. In fact, we were the only ones in there. We waited around awkwardly until someone sat us and then we were greeted by a 75+ year old server, who I assume is one of the owners.  We ordered tomato soup, a gyro plate, diet pepsi, and baklavas for dessert. It didn't seem like business was going too well. The server was a little pushy on the up-sells (the drink and the dessert).   The soda was in a smaller cup than I am used to. While we waited for food, we also took sips of the water, which was pretty good.   The soup arrived in less than 3-5 minutes. I originally ordered the lentil soup, but was very happy they brought me tomato instead. I am not exaggerating when I say that this was the best tomato soup I have ever tasted in my life. Lots of flavor and smelled amazing. Anyway, about 10 minutes later, our food plates arrived and it looked delicious.   The pita bread was plenty and they were all warm. I like my pita bread warm and soft. This pita bread was on point. To be honest, the gyro meat strips were a little too greasy for my liking, but they tasted GREAT dipped into the tomato soup.  The rice was well cooked and a great compliment to the tzatziki sauce, which was tangy and refreshing. After we devoured our meal, we felt more than stuffed. But, the waiter insisted we have dessert and even coffee. We agreed on getting baklavas for dessert. We passed on the coffee.  The baklavas were $2.50 each, were smaller than usual, but were overall pretty good. I'm not too sure they were made on location though. I recommend it for those looking for an authentic Greek food experience that have the time and budget for more than a fast food Greek experience."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, very hospitable people. Very warm atmosphere. Owner walks around every few minutes to make sure your enjoying you food. Tomato soup was the best I've ever had !!!! Highly recommended this place!"}
{"text":"I have been going to this wonderful restaurant for 19yrs. The food is amazing, dancers are so fun to watch, but most of all the owners treat you like family. Is a wonderful touch to an amazing meal. I would highly recommend this restaurant to all. ENJOY!!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat in the world! We have been going here for over 20 years and it's food is as amazing as it gets! The service is wonderful, the owners and staff are basically like family to us now.   The food is to die for. If you want a good place to eat, especially for nice dinners such as birthdays, New Years, graduations, etc., this is the place to go. I recommend trying the tomato soup as well. It's amazing."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a gem.  We were greeted warmly by the owner who seated us at our table.  We were looking for Middle Eastern/Mediterranean  type food and found this one on yelp.  The restaurant decor is unassuming and  very comfortable.  The place is run by the owner and his sister who attended to our every need.  When were were deciding what to order, the owner told us all about his top three.  The one at the top was a lamb dish.  I am not a lamb fan but he said it was \"THE BEST IN THE UNIVERSE!\"  I ordered it and I was not disappointed.  It was nothing short of amazing!!!  The tomato soup and the carrot cake, homemade by the sister, was incredible.  This was such a great dining experience not only for the food but for the humble and welcoming owners.  I would highly recommend that you chose this restaurant on Mill Ave. in Tempe.  You will not regret it."}
{"text":"Byblos has been in business since 1984 in Tempe.  They obviously know what they are doing and are doing something right. I just don't get how some people rate it one star .  Unreal!  We came for dinner there as a group (23 guests).   The staff was fantastic!  We all ordered different dishes. Byblos cleverly served us by section so that none of us felt left out while others were already served.  They put our tables in a U shape. Very smart!  Let's talk food now.  We had a few appetizers on each table to munch on while our dishes were getting prepared.  We had authentic hummus, very smooth, perfect balance of garlic, salt, lemon, tahini... I had a vegetarian sampler, with stuffed grape leaves, babaghanoush, green beans, tabouli, Lebane,  falafel. It was outstanding, l really appreciated the smoky flavor of the babaganoush.  I asked my friends around how were their dishes, they all raved about the food!  Lots of lamb dishes were ordered and truly appreciated by all.  The beef stroganoff was also a hit.  I had their honey pudding dessert. It was very refreshing! It was  topped with ground pistachios and a honey glaze, a hint of rose water to appease my senses after this wonderful feast. The pudding itself is sweet but not too much, it has some rice in it, just enough to give it some texture. Byblos prices are fair, food is tasty and plentiful. Nice and friendly people were attentive to all our needs. They exceeded our expectations!"}
{"text":"This place is an absolute hidden gem!!! My parents were in town and wanted something different found this place and what a wonderful place. It's a true mom and pop type of place. Every single thing we ate tasted fresh and homemade. The owner is super sweet and brings in a cultural experience the second you walk in the door. This is a must eat type of place they have been open 32 years ! Must try this place. Love it !!!"}
{"text":"The food here was fantastic I had the beef stroganoff and my girlfriend had the chicken shawarma. they folks that were serving us are very attentive and friendly. What's the point of being over attentive but I take that as there friendly demeanor from where they come from."}
{"text":"Came here with a good sized group of seven people. Service was, probably the best word for it -- confused. Friendly, but confused. Trying to get the order correct, coming to the table not knowing where dishes go, one person missing what they ordered, etc. All good in the end -- thankfully.  I had a lamb ouzi special. The presentation is not gourmet by far. Reminds me more of diner style back east. The food, however, was surprisingly good."}
{"text":"First off, I've seen a few people complaining about service...and I have to imagine these are people that complain about the service everywhere and are probably just a pain in the ass to deal with. I've eaten here quite a few times over the years and have had nothing but impeccable service from the man and woman who are always there, I believe they are the owners.  I've usually been thanked before my meal is through multiple times, they really appreciate the customers they have.  They do like to highlight their lamb dishes, and say that they are on special but they are pretty much always being served and they are all crazy good.  If you want to have a great meal, here is what I recommend.  The hummus with pine nuts.  Follow that up with the mousakka or lamb shank.  Get the tomato soup that everyone raves about...my buddy and I both have agreed multiple times that it's hands-down the best tomato soup we've had.  If you are still hungry after all of that....their baklava and coffee are great to end on.  I find it hilarious that people will dis on this place and say they should have went to Pita Jungle instead -- have fun with that!"}
{"text":"On my quest for the best Shawarma in the valley, I came across Byblos. I called in for a pick-up order, and did not get a chance to experience the dine-in. I thought the food was great, a bit much at $12.95, but did not disappoint. When I came in to pick up the order, I did notice the place seemed extremely quiet. I wonder why? I don't get too eccentric with my middle eastern tastes, but Shawarma is a great dish, chicken or beef. An interesting note: Al Pastor tacos, come from this Mediterranean dish. I need to look up the history of this connection."}
{"text":"I love family-run businesses and I try to support them over chains whenever possible. But this place fell short. I really was torn whether to give it 4 stars, but I felt too underwhelmed to give it anything more than 3.  Let's start with the good: the tomato soup they serve as a side for their entrees is DELICIOUS and creamy and rich. their hummus is also really good! our server was very friendly.  The not so good: the pitas they served with their hummus were a little hard/dry. they served french fries (the crinkly frozen kind) as a side for their gyro. service is extreeeeemely slow.  luckily we were not in a hurry, but literally from the time we finished our food to the time when anyone came by to see if we were done or wanted the check it was 20 minutes. and when we first sat down to order it was a good 10 minutes before we got water or anyone asked what we wanted to order. I suppose it's part of the charm of being a family business, but just keep that in mind and don't plan on rushing through a meal here.  The bad: I ordered the greek salad combo with lamb kebab and hummus.  the lamb kebab was literally just 3 chunks of kebab (and I didn't like the flavor). and the hummus came in a tiny condiment cup, but with nothing to dip it into?  I've never heard of eating hummus on top of a salad, but maybe that's what I was supposed to do. also I felt a little pressured when our server kept asking us if we wanted something to drink other than water or if we wanted to order appetizer, dessert, etc. - you get the picture"}
{"text":"I love only certain dishes here!  Tabouli is absolutely delicious and refreshing.  I like their tabouli more than Cafe Istanbul. Their hummus is perfect, but so is Cafe Istanbul's so that's a tie for me.  I always enjoy their tomato soup, mmmmm.  I usually get the arayess and enjoy it every time.  Look forward to trying more, but always like to stick to those I enjoy."}
{"text":"Good Food, Mixed Feelings...  Following a craving I've had for Lebanese Garlic Sauce, I ended up at Byblos for a much anticipated late lunch. I also brought along a printed coupon they had displayed on their web site.  I had called ahead to ensure that their garlic sauce wasn't the garlic mayonnaise mixture (yuk) I had been served at another restaurant in town as garlic sauce. The person who answered my call to Byblos assured me that there was no mayonnaise in their garlic sauce. I set out anticipating a nice mouthful of savory emulsified garlic, lemon juice and olive oil - or something approximating that - like I always used to be served in my favorite Lebanese restaurant in Minneapolis.  I was seated and provided with water and a menu immediately. I arrived after the lunch rush was past so service was not a problem.   I was going to order the grilled chicken breast lunch plate, which was served with garlic dip, but the owner encouraged me to try the chef's special of the day instead. The special was spinach simmered with ground beef and spices and served with rice pilaf and hummus. It included a cup of their tomato soup. I also ordered garlic dip to go, and a glass of their yogurt drink.  My soup was brought almost immediately, and was absolutely delicious. I could eat that soup daily! My main course was not far behind. It was good, but left me wishing I had ordered something with punch to it. I was really glad I had ordered the yogurt drink as it gave my meal additional flavor dimension.  I was left wanting something additional, so I ordered the Honey Pudding for dessert. I really don't know how to describe it, but it was fabulous and wonderfully creamy!  I was feeling that I'd had a good experience overall, and before the check was brought I gave the server the coupon I had printed from their website. It read:  \"$5.00 OFF Any Dining Experience of $20 or more. - Cannot be applied to the purchase of alcoholic beverages - Coupons may not be combined with any other offer - Not valid on Holidays or special events - Coupon void if altered - One coupon per party - Expires 07/31/2015\"  The server took the coupon and a few minutes later, the owner came over and explained that the coupon was only good for dinner. Nothing on the coupon (above) or the website had indicated to me that it was for dinner only, and I had intentionally spent over $20 on food because $5 off seemed a good reason to do so. Of course, he was the owner so his interpretation prevailed. I didn't make a scene over it, but it left a bad taste in my mouth.  Finally, the much awaited garlic dip! I opened it at home a short while later. It smelled nice and garlicky, but was not at all what I was looking forward to. I don't know what it was made from, but it had a texture a bit thicker than hummus. It was sort of like dry garlicky mashed potatoes. There was apparently no lemon in it. I should have asked more questions. So, at this point my quest for garlic sauce remains unfulfilled."}

{"text":"Should have read the reviews, apparently they've been short staffed for a long time...... Walked in to an outdated restaurant, fairly large. There were two small groups seated, so it was basically empty. The older gentleman eventually got to our table (very slowly), pulled a chair up and listed his \"specials\", we declined as we didn't want any lamb. We placed our order very slowly as he couldn't write fast enough. My gf asked for a side of feta which turned into a bargaining situation, \"how much you pay for feta?\" Uhhhhhh.... $4 later we get a little Block of feta. The food was okay, not great and not bad., overly priced. The hummus was in fact plain, nothing to it. It was a good try but nothing I'll frequent."}
{"text":"How is it that I have lived here for almost 20 years and this is the first time I have stopped into Byblos? They have been here - neighborhood local - for almost 30 years! The owner stopped by while we were enjoying a delicious dinner of moussaka, hummus, babaganouche, tomato soup, and the lamb special. Every bite was incredibly fresh and delicious. Don't skip out before having dessert - the tiramisu and honey pudding were incredible. Oh, and the Turkish Coffee - great flavoring with the cardamom. Stop in and say hello - they'll love you for it and your tummy will thank you."}
{"text":"Just awesomeness!  Group of 4 of us all different dishes with several appetizers and deserts.  Best service and food. Look at my reviews... I'm pretty tough on my reviews."}
{"text":"This was my first visit here today and I ordered the spinach pie and small hummus. It was really good. My friend L got the gyros salad and it looked so good she said it was. My other friend T ordered the veggie lasagna and it looked so good! She ate every bite. I didn't feel the portions  were to small I thought they were perfect!"}
