{"text":"I will not be back.    I really wanted a grilled cheese and chose to have it with fries.    My food came out warm at best, the fires were overcooked and tasted like McCain frozen fries (not my thing). The sandwich was worse.  it was soggy and had hardly any cheese and the cheese that was there tasted like cheese spread :-(   I will say for me the location was great and perhaps I just had a bad experience because it was quite busy over the lunch hour leading me to believe it is a popular place."}
{"text":"This tiny hidden secret is a true gem. It's one of those little caf√©s meant for workers in the area. There are many office buildings around.  I had gone a couple years ago with a coworker and I remember eating fries and maybe a burger? It was forgettable. But today I ordered what I should've ordered back then.  Bibimbap. My first one. She explained what it was: A Korean dish ... delicious sticky flavorful white rice with carrots, cooked bean sprouts, cucumber, shiitake mushrooms, cabbage, beef and another style of cucumber... All topped with a fried egg cooked to perfection.  Bibimbap. I love it.  The taste was delicate, clean, each section of the dish had its own flavor. So delicious!  I told the ladies I'd be back since I forgot my phone and couldn't take a picture of the glorious meal. The ladies by the way are extremely nice, make you feel at home.  So for $9.50 I got three things; my main dish, a soup and cold can of Coke. The bibimbap was served with a delicious sweet red hot sauce. And in a little container a fresh flavorful vegetable soup (cabbage, carrots, onions in gorgeous broth) to go with it: hot and steaming. And a can of Coke because I wanted it. Perfect lunch.   They have more than just Korean food. They have breakfast, a wide variety of sandwiches, burgers, fries, drinks, baked goods, chocolate, chips for sale.  The establishment is very small. There are only two tables, but it is so quaint and special and delicious! I told the ladies I'd be back. I went. Second time still good."}
{"text":"Is it illegal to steal two cute Vietnamese women and take them home? I'm gonna go with yes.   Yummy Cafe is a little ma and pa spot tucked away in the bottom of a commercial building by my office in the NE. It's very small with about eight seats and a little service counter. Basic handmade signs are strewn about with the menu items and daily specials. It's really cute. It's what you would think it is-deep friend treats, burgers, sandwiches and a number of quick Asian dishes. All of that said, they are sooooo friendly you want to come back just to say hi. The food is pretty good (I love the Yummy Sub which is their Vietnamese sub), the burgers are yummy with fries and the grilled cheese is also a treat. They stocks lots of drinks, chips, bars and snacks for that 2:30 craving as well. Likely no one will ever be by this place unless you work within a one block radius and can walk on your lunch break-which thankfully I do.  April challenge 10/30"}
