{"text":"Best Sushi in Madison - I have been searching for a good place with my wife since we moved here and this is one of the best places available.  I would recommend carry out or delivery."}
{"text":"I order takeout here every few weeks and I've never been disappointed. Prices are very reasonable, the staff are friendly, and the sushi is always delicious."}
{"text":"Really good sushi here; good temperature and the portions are just right. I rarely venture outside of the \"sushie deluxe\" (which comes w 9pcs sushi and a six pcs spicy tuna). My wife always orders The special rolls and they are pretty tasty. Ive never tried the habachi food items but its hard to do so cause the sushi deluxe is so good... i typicaly order to go but there are two tables inside for dine in. Small place and difficult to spot but great sushi."}
{"text":"Plus:  Delivery was timely  Minus: Sushi is sloppily put together Tempura is oily and has too much breading  I am Underwhelmed"}
{"text":"My critique may be biased on the surface.  My wife and I absolutely love sushi.  We lived in South Florida for a number of years prior to moving to Madison.  While in Florida, we enjoyed any number of great sushi places.  Trust me, there are a plethora of sushi places to choose from in South Florida.  Some were great, some were mediocre, some just plain sucked.  I even came across one that was shut down by the health department.  When I reflect back to my sushi experiences near and far, regardless of location, I am pitting all of them against the ones I deem to be the very best.  AMBIANCE This is a store that caters to carry-out and delivery-based clientele.  It was obviously not designed for those looking for a cozy dine-in experience.  It has 2 simple 2-person tables tucked along a wall with nothing more than a bottle of soy sauce atop each table.  The store was loud - fans, appliances, and whatnot.  The kitchen staff communicated in non-English over the sound of the kitchen - again, loudly.  Don't read into this; I'm not knocking them whatsoever for they must be able to communicate to one another to function, but, since this is about ambiance, I am merely describing my experience.  PRICES / FOOD Red flags went up immediately when I saw how inexpensive their sushi rolls were.  This is America and you get what you pay for.  I ordered a spicy tuna roll and an eel roll - 2 rolls for little more than 8 bucks.   What I received were 6 tight, little rolls of each.  In my experience with really good sushi places is that they do not skimp.  Akari's rolls missed that mark completely.  Eel rolls often have eel inside the roll and a small morsel served on top.  That was not the case here, and I could barely make out the eel within.  I could have pushed the spicy tuna mixture out of the roll with a pencil.  ECO Plastic forks accompanied wood chopsticks.  We were served ice water in small, flimsy plastic cups.  Styrofoam plates were also provided.  Sushi and sashimi were served in the same plastic carriers you see stowed in self-service stations at grocery stores.  FLAVOR Obviously, the closer to the ocean you are, the better.  That doesn't mean you cannot get good sushi inland, but age does affect the flavor.  Fish should NEVER smell like, well, fish.  Fresh fish smells soapy, clean.  It does NOT smell fishy.  My sushi did arrive to the table with a slight fishy odor.  Because of the lack of actual fish, I experienced disks of rice complemented by barely notable sushi goodness.  SERVICE The service was very good.  I cannot say anything but good things regarding the service.  SUMMARY There are other sushi places to try in Madison, and I look forward visiting those establishments in the future.  That said, am I ready to race back to this place anytime soon even for a simple carry-out craving?  No.  I found the food to be very average.  The rolls severely lacked size and filling.  Though the staff could be commended for good service, for the value, the overall experience was not worth it."}
{"text":"A little hole in the wall, two table, takeout/delivery with a very nice family staffing the place. Prices are much cheaper than the other sushi joints on the west side. I was going to give it a 3.5, but rounded up. I'd definitely go back. Salad was huge - enough for two, and tons of cucumbers. Disappointing that it was served with run of the mill ranch instead of the typical ginger dressing. Miso was rather bland - I wouldn't order it again. The gyoza on the other hand were fantastic! Perfectly crispy, very yummy filling and a good sauce too - not too sweet, not too vinegary. On to the sushi - 3 rolls for $12.50, all day. We got spicy tuna, spicy salmon and a Boston roll. The tuna and salmon were typical - I noticed a slightly fishy taste, but the hubby did not. The Boston roll was quite good - shrimp, avocado and cucumber, topped with a dollop of mayo. Finished with the special roll: Golden Age - the most expensive in the menu ($11.99). Most of them are $8.99, $9.99 or $10.50. Tempura shrimp (crunchy and tasty) tuna, avocado and mango, wrapped in yellow soy paper. Definitely a winner! All in all, this place is a great sushi option on the west side. Worth a try, for sure."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery at 8pm on a Wednesday night, and it took close to 2 hours for the food to get here. By the time it did, the soup was cold, the sushi was warm."}
{"text":"Although it looks like a place you go to get stabbed, the food is amazing. I had spicy tuna rolls and salmon sushi and I'm impressed! Do yourself a favor and get takeout. Only took like 10 minutes to prep and was great!"}
{"text":"Not the greatest meal I've ever had.  Delivery came at about 15 minutes after the estimated 50-60 minutes.  The sushi was just okay--we ordered the Spicy California Roll and the Philadelphia Roll.  It may just be a personal preference, but it seemed like there was just way too much cream cheese in the Philadelphia Roll.  All I could really taste was cream cheese which seems like a lot when it overpowers the smoked salmon.  We also had the chicken lo mein.  I did like that the chicken had a nice sear on it, but overall the lo mein was super dry with not a lot of flavor.  I might try again with one of their specialty rolls, but we'll see."}
{"text":"Akari is a great sushi place on the West side. Honestly, I've been searching for a decent sushi place in Madison. There is another popular place on the West side that I'm sure most people know of, but I dislike that place. I gave up on Madison sushi for a while, but then I got a coupon in the mail for Akari and decided why not.  We ordered three rolls for $12.50 - spicy salmon, shrimp tempura, and eel avocado. The ingredients were pretty fresh. We also ordered the Out of Control special roll. I *think* the tuna on the inside of that is supposed to be just seared like ahi tuna, but I'm not sure. It ended up being pretty cooked, which I didn't like that much. We also got a Chicken Teriyaki Bento Box. It had so much chicken in it. It was overflowing the take-out container. They forgot the 4 pieces of California roll, but oh well. We had also ordered Fried Rice but got White Rice.  Overall, I enjoyed my meal. I feel like they only do take-out orders. I think they could improve on their sushi rice. Perhaps I came too late in the evening and the rice had dried out, but it wasn't sticky enough to hold the roll."}
