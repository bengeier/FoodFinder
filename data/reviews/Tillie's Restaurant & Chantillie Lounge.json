{"text":"Excellent restaurant! I am a McKeesport native now living in another state. On my all-too-infrequent return visits to the area I often try to stop in to Tillie's for lunch or dinner. I find that it has consistently offered one of the best dining experiences in the Pittsburgh area or anywhere else! It was a Christy Park institution when I was growing up, and it remains so today.  The food, from pizza to more high-end traditional (and authentic!) Italian fare, is of high quality and typically in ample portions. A wide range of selections are available from a variety of styles, each with its own merit. Service is typically very good, even when the facility is full and quite busy.  The location is neat and clean and comfortable, quite appropriate for the nature of the business. The adjoining lot offers ample secure parking.  For a restaurant to attain and maintain such a consistent, high quality level of service for so many years is impressive!  I look forward to future dining opportunities at Tillie's!"}
{"text":"First time here.  Generally clean looking,  though not spotless.  Older decor contributing.  I had lunch.  Calamari parm, crab florentine soup, homemade noodle spaghetti.  Timing was acceptable,  no rush.  Impressively,  the calamari was not greasy or over cooked to leather.  A nice compliment of red sauce and a smattering of cheese baked on top; not drowned in sauce and cheese,  thankfully. The spaghetti was nice and dry,  not dripping with water pooling pink sauce in the bottom of the bowl.  Sauce was very nice,  not too sweet or too overwhelming and clinged nicely to the noodles.  Soup was light and well supplied with crab.  All in all,  a surprising and enjoyable lunch.  If up this way again,  I'll definitely be stopping in to try some other menu items.  Price is very reasonable,  service was friendly and efficient. Try it! Bill was $13.35 + tip."}
{"text":"Great Food. Family owned and operated. If you are in the mood for some really good Italian food then this is the place to come. It may seem a little beat up but that is just the soul that comes out in the food. It is great the soup, the pizza, the pasta. Anything you pick will be good. The menu is not huge and it is a little eclectic but what they do they do really well here. My family stumbled across it one night and it has become a staple. The portions are large and if you go you should know that there will be leftovers in the morning. Staff is really nice and the food is really good."}
{"text":"Tillie's is always a delight. I am Italian and I give it two thumbs up. The food is always fresh and delicious, the staff is always friendly and timely, and the atmosphere feels like home. 
What are you waiting for...
Eat at TILLIE'S now!!!"}
{"text":"My favorite Italian restaurant 
Best fried zucchini around 
Home made sauce is a special family recipe 
Warm friendly environment and generous portions 
Always something to take home"}
{"text":"Love this place try the cheese ravioli good service too every one is very friendly you have to try this place"}
{"text":"Be prepared to spend some money here, but well worth it. Best, most authentic Italian food I have ever eaten. Excellent service. Decor was a little outdated but you will love the food so much, you won't even notice."}
{"text":"I grew up eating here! Since I've moved away I crave everything about this place. I live in Iowa now & my cousin lives in California and he says the same thing. Please please please figure out a way to freeze & ship your food so we can have a piece of home especially your meatball pizzas!!! If Primanti Brothers can do then so can you!!!"}
{"text":"I've been going to this place ever since I was born I get to enjoy the wonderful food they have here and they also have amazing food and places for parties I'm only 12 and I'm so glad that he gets enjoy the food here keep up your good work"}
{"text":"I don't think it's the way it really works, but every time I eat at Tillies I hope and dream that the lady in the big wall portrait is in the back making my food.  The gnocchi are fabulous...they taste like they were made with wrinkly old grandma hands.  It may not be the swankiest joint and it may not be in the best part of town but it certainly has some treasures...I highly recommend Tillies!"}
{"text":"Excellent pasta, pizza, and well everything.  The preparation can be hit or miss at times but the ingredients have made up for this on every occasion in my opinion.  This place has been around for as long as I can remember and it has always been excellent.  

The restaurant has a 50's or 60's mob like feel, this is likely due to that it has been the same for countless years.  I always feel like Goodfellas or some other mob classic could have been filmed here.  On a week night, you may be the only one in the place which is sad for the restaurant.  I personally find this to be a plus as I feel as though I am in on a secret no one knows about.  Service is slow but not in a bad way.  I think this is an Italian thing not to be rushed into eating quickly.

Dinner salads are absolutely huge and can be shared with a date adding romantic touch to the meal should that be your goal.  Pastas are homemade and the lasagna is the best in Pittsburgh Area.  Pizza is different than anything else I have ever had but absolutely excellent.  Warning: you will crave this stuff after eating it.    

At any rate, I highly recommend this place if you want quality Italian food at a great price.  Tillie's don't change a thing, I'm sure Matilda (the founder) would be proud."}
{"text":"Was in town visiting friends and family and this place had good reviews so we decided to try it....but we had a less than mediocre experience. I ordered one of the more pricey dishes on the menu, the lobster and crab gnocchi. It was surprising bland, almost watered down. I couldn't eat more than a few bites and I felt like I wasted money. The service was a real bummer too. Our waitress was rather unwelcoming and not very helpful. I really was excited for this place with all the positive comments, but unfortunately I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Absolutely Love their food. Go there as often as I can. I even get take out food if I don't have time to eat in the restaurant! Their sauce is outstanding & you can buy it by the quart and their meatballs as well. Our family has been getting food to go & eating in since I was a kid. We love it!! Doesn't look like much from the outside  (not that it's bad), but if you aren't sure - just try it out and you will be hooked like I am!"}
{"text":"Could go for some Lasagna! Excellent! Mark and his staff make some of the best Italian food in the business. And the waitress are Awesome!"}
{"text":"Old school homemade Italian food - very good! I'm pretty sure they put crack in the sauce because that's all you can think about for a few days after eating it - you just want more, more, more!"}
{"text":"We live in Pittsburgh so we don't get to come out often. When we do we love seeing our waitress Loretta and some of the amazing ravioli. Great service and it's a great price. More of \"down home Italian\" than anything else."}
{"text":"On an adventure to go to Century Square Luxury Cinemas in West Mifflin, we stopped at Tillie's for some dinner. After reading all of the reviews, it seemed like you needed to have grown up in the area to really appreciate Tillie's, but we decided to give it a shot anyway.

It wasn't super busy, but the beer selection was great and our dinner was too. I got a great pasta dish was spicy sausage and MAN it was spicy. 

Overall, Tillie's was great, but it's pretty average in terms of Italian dinner. If you're looking for some really good Italian food, I'd recommend checking out Pasta Too in Bethel Park."}
{"text":"My parents used to bring me here all the time when I was younger, but I hadn't been here in about 10 years, I don't know why! I've been here several times recently, and plan to keep going! The service is friendly and efficient and the food is good.  I wouldn't say its the best Italian food I've ever had, but it is definitely well above the average around here.  The pasta sauce is like nothing I've had before, but I really like it.  The decor is a little outdated, but I don't mind as long as they keep up the food and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Excellent pasta and sauces. Homemade spaghetti is amazing. Very reasonable prices. Wait staff provides excellent service. So many great choices including pizza. Great kids menu. A wonderful family restaurant."}
{"text":"Best Italian food I have ever had! I can't begin to express how comforting food from Tillies is, and everything is always made and prepared fresh! I go there at least twice a month!"}
{"text":"Tillies is always good. I've never been disappointed with the food and service. Highly recommend for couples and families!"}
{"text":"First time there. Greeted and served by very friendly staff. Great food made fresh. Will return."}
{"text":"One of my favorites when I visit the area. Great Italian food at a reasonable price. A lifelong family favorite. I recommend the family style dinners for take out."}
{"text":"Tillies!! If you like Italian food, you should be eating at Tillies!. If you want DELICIOUS food and great service, go to Tillies! Get the house Italian dressing  on your salad and try the zucchini!  Truly, ANY  dish that you order that has their homemade  spaghetti sauce or meat sauce is a WINNER!!! Chicken Parmesan is delicious and so is the Chicken Marsala!! Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Tillie's has been in business for over 50 years with many of Tillie's original recipes still on the menu. Much of the pasta is freshly made including the homemade spaghetti, gnocchi & ravioli. The wait staff are friendly and the dishes are reasonably priced. 

I grew up eating here and I always visit when I am back in town. I can't recommend it enough."}
{"text":"Seven of my 'hangry' family members came here for my grandmother's birthday. We stopped in around 1:30 and the first thing we noticed was the table was still dirty; I was willing to overlook this, as our waiter was pretty decent. 

Our drinks came out without err and we had a great time on the second level just talking and laughing. I ordered a dirty martini and our waiter brought me extra drink, which was mixed, but wouldn't fit in my glass at the time, which was awesome. 

We placed our orders and since it was now approaching 2pm, we were still on the lunch menu. The food took forever to come out- when I finally looked at the time, I realized it was now close to 3pm. 

Upon arrival, I noticed my fettuccine was about 2 bites of pasta; I wanted so much more. It tasted homemade and I wondered if it was. I noticed the garlic in my dish was minced and from a jar. The 25% Italian in me was really disappointed and hoping for fresh-cut. To me, this just ruined the dish. You take fresh pasta that tastes almost like it's homemade and then you throw some jarred garlic on it- blech!

The rest of the family got dishes of similar size and I was displeased to see the amount of shrimp on a plate for an adult (maybe 6?). It looked like a child's portion.  However, I will note the calamari appetizer was to die for and extremely abundant. It came with a sort of ginger sauce that had a sweet tang and had me coming back for more. 

Be aware, the parking lot that you would think is for Tillie's, isn't for the restaurant, and I was told by a local that you will be towed for parking there. It wasn't hard to find street parking on a Saturday afternoon, though. 

If I'm in the area, I might stop again to experience dinner, but wouldn't go out of my way to come back."}
{"text":"Went here on Mothers Day, got seated within 30 min, on a very very busy day. The lasagna and manicotti was very good and homemade. Also the breaded zucchini was real good. Tia was our server, and she was wonderful, very prompt and attentive. This was a wonderful dining experience, and a true gem of an indie italian restaurant. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"When you pull infront of tillies your a little suspicious of the outside of the building. But once you go in and sit down the smells change your mind. If your an olive garden lover you will not like this place. It's real italian food. Their pasta is homemade and their sauce is also. The lasagna is a huge helping and very filling. A must eat"}
{"text":"Tillie's has been one of our family favorites for years. We were just there again last week and it was wonderful. The lasagna was incredible, saucy, cheesy, hot, fresh and HUGE! It was just as good reheated a couple of days later. The homemade cheese ravioli was incredible. I want to try the beef short rib ravioli next time, they sound interesting. The Arancini (risotto cakes) appetizer was delicious. Service is always great. We are so lucky to have the wonderful restaurant in our area. Thanks!"}
{"text":"The \"must have\" dish is the Pork Palena!!! My mouth waters when thinking of this dish."}
{"text":"My family and I ate at Tillie's for lunch a coupe weeks ago after attending a funeral.  We noticed that everything we order was made with very fresh ingredients and thought that maybe things had turned around.  We all enjoyed our meal.  Tonight, my husband and I went there for dinner and were extremely pleased with our food.  Our server was someone who waited on us 20 years ago when our daughter was a little girl.  She remembered us and we talked briefly.  Our food was terrific.  It was the homemade sauce, pasta, etc. that I remembered.  I had the chicken parm with a side of homemade pasta.  I remembered to ask for my sauce on the side because they tend to drown everything.  The chicken is a full chicken breast cut in half, breaded, fried, served with mushrooms (they ask if you want them), and parmesan cheese.  Cooked perfectly.  And I have always loved their homemade spaghetti.  My husband had something new on the menu - a trio of chicken parm, lasagna, and fettucini alfredo.  He enjoyed it all,.  I had minestrone - it was good, but I [refer it without meat.  He had wedding soup and aid it was very good.  We also had an order of breaded cauliflower.  Just like 20 years ago, only a bigger portion.  The best we've had anywhere.  Almost all the tables were filled with couples and families - large groups.  Everyone was upbeat and happy. It's always a good idea to give a place that might disappoint you a second chance.  My last review was not favorable, but this one is.  I love Tillie's and we will go back."}
{"text":"Tillie's Restaurant is a wonderful kid and family friendly Italian Restaurant. I have been coming to Tillie's since a young child. My parents knew Tillie. She was a wonderful old women that was always nice to me. Her picture hangs in the dining room, a beautiful tribute. 
As a family, we have used the side room many times for family dinners or occasions. The room is nice for small to large families. Call for reservations for large groups. Service has always been friendly. We have had to wait for large orders, but on the whole it comes out in a timely fashion. 
I highly recommend the Homemade Spaghetti with plan or meat sauce, it's personal preference.  I love the Homemade Gnocchi with meat sauce and a meatball. It is also good with a piece of hot sausage. I like the cup of Wedding soup as a side dish. The cup is a small taste, just enough to complement the bread that comes with each meal as well.  I used to like the salad, but it has change in time and not as good as it used to be. 
Drinks from the bar have always been a bit pricey for my taste, again personal preference as to what you're willing to pay. 
I do not recommend take out. We have tried to take out several times. It is best to dine in. The take out menu is the same price as a regular dinner served in the restaurant, except they do not give you any side dish, no soup or salad. I never thought that was a good deal. We don't take out. We do carry out left over's. 
Despite my negative comments, it is a nice family Italian Restaurant that you should consider for dinner. 
Parking has never been a problem for the time we dine. Parking on the street or in the lot beside the restaurant. I did read that the lot is not owned by the restaurant. I am not sure, but everyone parks there."}
{"text":"My favorite pasta sauce in the entire world. Prices are very high for italian food and it seems they keep going up.

The place is due for a complete remodel, its dark, its old, its uninviting. I get my food to go."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here alot when we live close by but move further away and kinda forgot about Tillies recently went back and it was amazing.. Cheese Ravioli are fantastic"}
{"text":"Food is fresh and has real homemade taste. Friendly service and great Italian atmosphere, it's a great place to eat."}
{"text":"Just popped in the place for the first time. Every one was helpful and the food was Great. Very nice atmosphere and people. I will come again!"}
{"text":"One of my top 3 lifetime favorite Italian restaurants.
I've been coming here since 1968, the food is consistent.
My all time favorite is homemade spaghetti with plain sauce.
I highly recommend the  lasagna as well, it's better than my own (and yes, I'm Italian) 
The chicken parm is awesome too...don't recall ever being served a bad dish...love this place!"}
{"text":"Really super Italian food!! Reasonable and delicious! The eggplant and fried lasagna is my favorite!!!"}
{"text":"Veal Piccata was outstanding! Delicious homemade fettuccine and mushroom sauce - we will be back!"}
{"text":"Eh, not impressed. 
I remember coming here as a kid and it was a fancy event for us kids!

Now there are dudes on sleeveless tees and ZZ Top beards!  Yeah, not kidding!

Mine must be the unpopular opinion because others seem to still like this place.

I wont waste time...

PROS:
Local Italian joint (nice, for the locals! Lol)

CONS:
Over-priced;
Mediocre food;
Screwed up a basic order;
Kinda old/musty inside, I don't think anything has changed inside *since* I was last there as a kid!

Note to the Chef: Work on that Alfredo sauce, it was pretty bland :("}
{"text":"Husband loves the homemade spaghetti but I was EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED with the $12.00 antipasto salad ....  I got the wrong dressing which wasn't so bad BUT I paid that much for bad lettuce and what looked to be a couple pieces of lunch meat and cheese torn apart with a couple olives thrown in. HOW DO YOU ACTUALLY GIVE THAT TO A CUSTOMER AND EXPECT A REPEAT ORDER!!!???!!!"}
{"text":"Just came home with free steak salad due my mentioning how cold and over cooked first one was. Also took some extra time. Place had one table ahead of me. 

I told manager it was ok I just wanted them to know it was lack of attention to timing and I wanted nothing. 

The unasked for salad appeared right before I left. 

Very nice to see some people still have pride in what they do."}
{"text":"When the moon hits your eyes like a big pizza pie, that's amore. (Me, serenading Tillie's) 

Wow this place is bar none the best Italian I've ever had. Both times being here, the food is fresh, pasta is perfect, and the accompaniments are bountiful. 

The first time I was here with Joshua for a quick dinner. I got the chicken parmioli, a giant ravioli with chicken parm on top. (GENIUS!) it was so amazing. It came with a side salad, and I think it was less than $12! 

On Thursday, a large group of co workers and I went out, and the only place I could think to tell them to go was Tillie's! I got the chicken piccata this time. Wowza. Two whole chicken breasts, a side of pasta, and a salad for $14.99.

I'm in love with how good this place is, and how inexpensive they are! You get so much food for what you pay. I hope to go back soon! 

Happy Eating!"}
{"text":"Great food .. Great service...Have never had a bad meal.. Great sauce...homemade pasta.. They keep true to the Italian tradition.. Big portions.. So try and save room for dessert. When I crave Italian this is where I go.."}
{"text":"This restaurant is absolutely amazing. It's kind of a hole in the wall which usually means the place is excellent. And Tillies is no exception to that! The food is so good, it's indescribable. You just have to taste it. I cannot wait to bring my family here the next time they are in town!"}
{"text":"They have a new updated menu. I was very impressed. I went from not liking this place to wanting to go back for more!!"}
{"text":"The best Italian food in the mckeesport,  white oak area hands down. take out is a must because It reminds me of a haunted house, littered with the ghosts of mckeesport past. But if you want the greatest meatballs and red sauce in the mon valley and aint afraid of no ghosts it's a easy 5 stars."}
{"text":"I would like to give a rating for 3 catagories: Food, Service, Atmosphere.

The Food: 3 of 5 stars
While expensive, it doesn't look like much on the plate when first served. I ordered the Lasagne Dinner with a choice of soup or salad. I chose soup, and it arrived as a tiny cup of wedding soup that was very salty to taste, much like chicken broth. The lasagne came on a plate and was gigantic, it made me happy.
The lasagne had a nice mild overall flavor, slightly bland. Could taste the meat and cheese and the sauce that was poured over it, was hoping for more italian flavors. I was hoping to taste a bit more. It was a nice size, perfectly cooked lasagne. Would have been nice if there was something more given for presentation. Parsley, or something nice for garnishment.
The Service: 4-1/2 of 5 stars.
While it was not slow, our waitress did take a bit at first for refilling drinks or asking any questions, but was not impersonal or too personal. She was able to catch up to watching drinks and bringing what was needed when she could. I couldn't have asked for better.
The Atmosphere: 2 of 5 stars.
Upon entering, your ushered to your seat to what looks like dim lighting and a normal entrance. However when you see the flipside of where you came it looks like a double door closet. The doorway that your ushered from has a camera, granted for security purposes, that protrudes into your head/shoulder path. The top corners of the dining areas have black speakers against white walls with loose cords strung. 
The bar area is not far from the dining areas but also isn't your typical loud and obnoxious bar, which was a relief. The booth we sat in has seen some many years of usage and in small need of vynal repairs. The table top had crayon marks from the previous children seated before us.

Overall review: 
Food was average, but only just so. Happy with service, but would not want to pay New York prices for average experience."}
{"text":"Love the food but the wait was ridiculous. We went during lunch so it wasn't busy in the least. The only thing we ordered was 2 sandwiches and it took over a half hour. When we asked why it wasn't so long they said someone called off. Better management needs to happen. This could be my last time here and I've been coming here since a kid. People at surrounding tables were complaining as well. Management and customer service is key."}
{"text":"Well we've been here quite a few times. Our hostess was Marci was wonderful! I ordered what I usually get..similar to the tour of Italy. My dish was not bad..sauce could have had a little more something. My fiance got the Molto Polo.. 3 different types of chicken. She cut into her dinner and it was obviously undercooked. Pink in the middle and bloody clear liquid. Our hostess took it back to the kitchen.. 5 minutes later the same dish..with the same bloody clear liquid on the dish..re-heated!  We instantly refused and asked for a new dinner. By this time I am done with my dinner. The second replacement dinner came out. It tasted soggy and sour as I tried it also. We believe that it was a new cook in training.. We will visit another time in the future. We were not the only table that had sent a dinner back that night."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Tillie's my entire life. The food is good, real, homemade Italian. The sauce is delicious, the pasta, which is homemade, is also excellent. Good family atmosphere. In my opinion, it's the best Italian in the South Hills. The interior's a bit dated, but who care's as long as the food is good? 

The sauce is very good and sweet, but not overly so. The salads are also excellent; the red wine vinaigrette is very good. Let's put it this way; if I ever become president, I'm having my inauguration party here. This is homemade Italian food like it should be, not like the chain places at all. I'll be coming here the rest of my life."}
{"text":"Went with friends to Tillie's, haven't been for almost 20 years!

WHY DID WE LAPSE???  That's the mystery--

Everything was delicious.  Portions are quite large, that we did remember.

Two of us had the *BARRAMUNDI*, marked as a chef specialty and it certainly was special - Creamy tomato basil risotto, topped with sauted spinach topped with the lightly cajun spiced fish with three nice sized cajun shrimp on the side.

Our gnocchi girl did not disappoint and she reports that the gnocchi was pretty yummy.  Hubs had the spaghetti with meatball and sausage and was very happy as well.

Salads were fresh and crisp, bread was plentiful and soft.  We had one minestrone with sausage soup and it also was declared very good.

Their iced tea was different, not brown, but black and naturally pretty sweet.  I liked the variation very much.

Not sure why the lapse, but not going to Tillie's is a definite lapse in choosing your Italian dinner destination!"}
{"text":"Never a bad meal here. New items on the menu are great. Best Italian restaurant around."}
{"text":"Reminicent of visiting Nunnie's house as a kid, Tillies takes me back to childhood. The sauce is delicious and the pasta is perfection."}
{"text":"This was a sad, sad experience for my fiancé who grew up in this area.  The restaurant is named after the old woman who used to run the joint...her picture still hangs in the front room as a reminder of days gone by.

I was told back then you could get a huge plate of pasta, and the food was amazing!!! I don't know if grandma took the recipes with her when she passed on, but both my fiancé and I were not impressed with the quality of their food. We ordered the homemade spaghetti. Sounds simple enough, but what we got looked and tasted worse than a can of Chef Boyardee. The sauce was bland, and the noodles weren't right. I always joke about how bad of a cook I am, but I swear I could make better than this.

I loved our waitress Tia. She was awesome. Very friendly and attentive. I just wish the food was better than it was.  I think they need to reexamine what recipes to use for a restaurant that was known for their fine cuisine. And keep Tillie's memory alive by serving nothing but the best."}
{"text":"I love Tillie's! I've been going there for years with my family, and my daughter jokes that it is my favorite place - she's right. She says I always order the same thing - again right (the spaghetti!). Just a terrific spot to eat with your friends and family. Nothing fancy, but with a homey atmosphere that always says \"welcome\"."}
{"text":"Until recently, Tillie's was one of those nagging loose ends for me on Yelp. I'd been there a number of years ago, long before I'd created an account and took Pittsburgh by storm (heh). Since that amicable visit, I'd been itching to return. 

A quaint canopy, a bird bath,and potted plants decorate the exterior. Upon pulling  into the gravel-coated parking lot with my mother, I felt as if we were visiting an older relative who still lived in a declining community, defiantly refusing to move, meticulously keeping up appearances. 

Upon entering, our attention was immediately trained on a portrait of the restaurant's matriarch, Matilda \"Tillie\" Smith, who founded the establishment in 1962, her spirit remaining very much intact, reassuringly watching over the place while her son and daughter-in-law continue to keep tradition alive and running. 

As my own mom and I lunched together on a Saturday afternoon spent dropping in on my sister who lives nearby, a child's birthday party, complete with an army of guests, happily went on. For an eatery in a neighborhood many people avoid, good cheer was abundant, few booths, tables, and chairs were unoccupied. Balloons floated clumsily to the ceiling like drunks wearing Legion Flight Rings, adolescent girls whispered and giggled, wrapping paper was torn, burly men carrying packages with bows on them entered and bear-hugged other burly men carrying toddlers, all while Frank Sinatra's vocals permeated the room. Tillie's was alive. She is alive. 

Hell, I feel her pinchin' my earlobe as I write this. Okay, Matilda, the food, the food, I'm gettin' to it...

Not being able to remember what I devoured here 7 years ago, my sister recommended the incredibly edible Prime Rib Pizza. A Boursin and Mascarpone spread coats the bottom of the pita-like crust, which is then liberally coated with chopped prime rib, caramelized onions, roasted red peppers, provolone, blue cheese, and fried arugula. 

I could have folded each cut of this shareable pie and convinced myself I was eating some sort of exotic sandwich. The clash between the smooth, sweet cream of the Mascarpone/Boursin blend, the sharpness of the Provolone, and the strength of the blue cheese was alone a gastronomic symphony. The prime rib provided savory heft and depth, while the red capsicum and onions amplified the sweetness, the arugula kicking the entire pizza further into the stratosphere with its peppery essence. Each bite was an amusement park ride, a funhouse jaunt, a carnival, a cavalcade of flavors and textures. 

Before hand, the Lobster and Crab Grilled Cheese served as an entertaining opening act. Within triangles of brunch-worthy toast, lump crab meat and chopped lobster claw crawled out of a magnificent Alouette/Gruyere mire, the former's brie-ish lard melding with the latter's nutty, earthy, somewhat briny profile, both serving the rendered seafood well like a congealed chowder or dip of sorts  Garnished with arugula (Mama Smith must have loved it), a serving of Tomato Basil Bisque was an expected and welcome companion to the sandwich, its inherent zest and cream compelling dunk after dunk after dunk until only the soup remained. This upscale, gourmet take on a lunchroom classic delivered comfort, bliss,and culinary smack with every bite and sip. 

Dessert was a pair of cannily crafted cannoli. Amply filled with a sugary, whipped Ricotta that was riddled with chocolate chips and pistachio shards, the twin cookie ducts were dressed with chocolate syrup and powdered sugar. Vaguely similar to ice cream waffle cones, careful chomps unveiled chilly, milky, saccharine lusciousness, contrasting textures playing a crucial part yet again. I kept fearing that a mess of confection would run down my fingers, the cannoli tricking me into thinking I was standing in front of Page's Dairy Mart on a 90 degree day. 

McKeesport may be a town that last saw its banner days 2 scores ago, but if you've ever dined at Tillie's, you'd never be aware of the local steel industry's departure and the dreams and quality of life that collapsed with it. Tillie's doesn't just hang on, she sits on her porch in a recliner, prospering like a daffodil sprouting from a crack in the pavement. 

So, let me pose some questions to the audience: Are you frustrated? Are you pining for an old-school, casual dining experience in which flash, pretentiousness, and trendiness are uninvited? 

Eat at Tillie's, silly.

P.S. The service was world-class."}
{"text":"We had a family dinner for 11.  The Caesar and mushroom fettuccine were good, but the lobster crab ravioli was lukewarm.  We didn't send it back, because, for some reason, we feared that they would just give a microwave boost.  The 3 available red wines went well with the Italian food, although they were sweeter and heavier than a typical Napa or Italian wine.  Tillie's deserves credit for managing our disparate group and getting our food out at almost the same time.  I've never been to Tillie's before, but would go back if I were nearby."}
{"text":"I love this place. The atmosphere is relaxing. The place is well taken care of and clean. It's usually very quiet, a great place to hang out with the family. The staff is very friendly and patient. The food is amazing. Lots of options for pasta and other Italian food. The price usually is very reasonable and not too expensive. The only thing I can think of is the location. The area is McKeesport, so it isn't the safest place in the world. But, really, it's a very nice place for a very nice meal."}
{"text":"Very good Italian food but expect to wait a bit as everything is made from scratch.  I had to take a star away because I was forced to watch foxnews during my entire meal."}
{"text":"Meh, good food and acceptible service. If you grew up in the area it's probably a must have but otherwise it classified as interesting regional Italian.  The service is good but local so better if you're from the area. I'll eat hear again."}
{"text":"I am so sad to say anything bad about this place.  This is the kind of place I usually love to find.  You know they are not going to be cutting edge, but they usually know well how to keep a customer happy. 

We visited on Valentines day, having decided to dine out at the last minute, we decided to try to find a good local place.  My wife and I had been to Tillies years ago and decided to see if a table might be available without much of a wait.  We arrived at 8:00 and were seated immediately.  I really didn't think much of it, but perhaps I should have.

Our server was great. Very friendly, helpful, and efficient.  We all ordered the homemade spaghetti because the menu seemed to feature it.  My wife had the marinara with a meatball, my son, the aglio olio, and I had ordered the meat sauce, which had a very enticing description.  I forget what it said, but it reminded me of Mom.  We also ordered soup, salad, and wine.
The waitress brought some bread that, I must admit was very good and very fresh.  Things started to turn with the wine, or should I say that the wine started to turn?  I could not decide for sure what was wrong with it. It tasted a bit like some very poorly made homemade wine I had, but finally decided that it was just on it's way to becoming vinegar from a really cheap bottle of wine.  One sip was all we drank.
The salads were OK, the soup was good.
We got our pasta, and we're all disappointed.  Mine came with the wrong sauce (marinara with a meatball) and I immediately sent it back. Yeah, I know that is not too much different, but it was a far cry from what was written on the menu.  My son said his tasted funny, and this quickly growing boy who is eating us out of house and home ate about 1/3 of his.  
My wife had the marinara, and it tasted burnt.
The waitress returned with my dish REALLY fast.  No I am know culinary expert, but I am smart enough to see that she came back with the same plate with the meatball cut in about four pieces, then covered with another ladle of the marinara.  One half inch of bad sauce is not enough to make me forget that I still did not get what I ordered.

In any case, I tasted the pasta, and dug around looking for signs of this heavenly meat sauce, but had now more than two bites.  After waiting for quite a while, I started to wonder if this waitress was as well trained as I thought.  When she finally came back, she said nothing as she took away our full glasses and my full plate.  I then realized that she probably was well trained to ignore potential problem customers.  I know I should have said something but who wants to sound miserable when taking their family out for Valentines Day?
As I was leaving, I wondered how this place stayed in business for fifty years.  It occurred to me later that this may exactly be how they stayed in business.  Sell cheap stuff to regular customers and don't try to please everyone.  Even if they don't come back, they are still dumb enough to pay the bill.  I regret that I was."}
{"text":"I ordered pasta with white clam sauce and eggplant Parmesan. It was awful, considered returning it but it wasn't worth the effort. $35 and the food was terrible. I'll not eat there again. Maybe eat in is better but the take out was deplorable."}
