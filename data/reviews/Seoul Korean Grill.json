{"text":"I love it here!  But you really need to order the all you can eat because the portions on the plate of meat are too little for the amount you're paying.  The all you can eat is around $25 / person & everyone at your table has to eat all you can eat or no one can order it. If you order the all you can eat then you don't have to pay extra for rice (which you really shouldn't have to do if you put in an order for meat--but that's just my opinion).  Seoul Grill recently revised their menu, so there are more options for different meats. They have added different flavors, which are so yummy! Try to spicy pork belly (sam gyop sal) that was recently added it's one of my favorites.  And remember when eating meat first order not marinated meats then order marinated because otherwise the marinated meats taste will disrupt the taste of the not marinated meat.     I must say it's really nice not having to drive to Koreatown for a decent korean bbq place!  Oh and all the people who work here are so nice & helpful! I wish they would make a Seoul Grill in Surprise! We need a korean restaurant in Surprise!"}
{"text":"We decided in spite of the reviews on here to try this place. I have to say I was pleasantly pleased. It sits off the road in a strip mall by Great Skate and Stingers Sports Bar.  They have regular as well as hibachi tables. We chose a hibachi table as we wanted to try to cook our dinner. We started with a Mandu - Korean Dumpling for an appetizer. We chose pork and they are similar to Chinese pot stickers but were sauteed vs. steamed. Very tasty. I ordered the Spicy Pork Bulgogi with a side of 5 shrimp and Ryan ordered the Herb Galbi (marinated steak strips). Both were quite flavorful and very tender. They brought out 3 sides that consisted of a sea weed/cole slaw type thing, marinaged sliced sausage with veggies and fish paste(?) or something similar. Then our wait staff brought out the meats. Placed the meats on the grill and then had us cook to taste. My only complaint if this really is one, is that she didnt speak English well so the communication was a bit limited. The food, the atmosphere was well worth it. We will go back again for sure. I would recommend trying this place out if your like Korean!"}
{"text":"I came in craving Korean food and left wanting to go somewhere (anywhere) else.  The squid was so overcooked I could not even chew it.  When I questionned the owner(?) he explained to me this is quite normal.  I thought the waitress was superb and the overall flavor was good, but I have never been so disgusted with an overall meal."}
{"text":"This was my first time here, I had a Groupon and didn't know what to expect.  I went with my wife and daughter who are fans of Korean food, (I'm half so you know I love it!) The food was full of taste, I can't complain there.  You get your monies worth too.  The only odd thing was that there was a limit on panchan and no rice served with the meal.  I think Koreans in Korea would roll over in their graves if they knew what was going on.  Rice and panchan are the staples of Korean food.  I just bared down and ordered it."}
{"text":"My friends wanted to try Korean food and I had never gone to this restaurant after it switched owners. Overall, my friends and I did not think the food was that great."}
{"text":"I took my parents in law to this place, and so disappointed and even embarrassed. This restaurant was ok until my last visit, summer 2011. However they came up with this strange concept to \"target people other than Koreans.\" Decoration of food was ok, but quality and taste were poor. We ordered non-marinated galbi and they gave us 8 small pieces on a bamboo leaf(for deco i assume). It wasnt the galbi we usually see in a korean bbq place, but it looked like the short rib u can buy from Costco for twenty bucks per pack (which can give you more than 50 pieces). They charged around 15 dollars for that 8 pieces. HEY REMEMBER. KOREAN FOOD IS GOOD AND DELICIOUS WHEN ITS KOREAN FOOD ITSELF."}
{"text":"What I liked about this place was the atmosphere. Nicely lit and not noisy. Service was very quick. I had a short rib dish that is served over sticky rice. very tasty and meat was extremely tender. The soup that is served prior to meal was excellent. The dessert I tried was chocolate ice cream with a rice coating. That was ok, nothing to brag about. I would come back for sure."}
{"text":"Wow this place was totally empty tonight (Monday night)!  So my bf, his two friends and I was going to jump our guts out at this place called Jumpstreet..and then fill up with some yummy all-you-can-eat Korean BBQ....unfortunately we didn't get to jump because most activities were closed so we decided to go eat early - which worked out for us because they close at 10 and we got there around 8:40ish. It was somewhat creepy cause when we went in it was completely empty - not a single customer insight - not to mention the waitresses were kind of awkward serving us at first too. Anyways - we decided to do the $25 all you can eat bbq cause it's way more worth it then ordering one plate of meat which was about 12-15 dollars each and very little. So the menu for the BBQ choices were pretty good - they have the usual marinated beef galbi, beef short ribs, beef brisket, beef bulgogi, pork bulgogi, spicy pork bulgogi, chicken, plus scallops, tiger shrimp, oyster mushrooms and a few other good selections.   I really like beef tongue and was happy they had it here, unfortunately the beef tongue here wasn't very good quality actually it was quite chewy - - despite the fact I had two plates of it on my own - it really wasn't great but it was better than nothing - hehe. The other meats are pretty good - except the chicken which was pretty bland. The lettuce salad was good and I was kind of sad they didn't have the rice paper or the steamed egg...that is usually served at other places.   The service was -  well - pretty good considering we were their only customers - we stayed there close to 2 hours...just a few minutes after their closing time and the waitresses were pretty good mannered about it.....meaning they didn't give us dirty stares or attitude because they want us out already....they were actually pretty nice so even we tipped more. Overall this place isn't bad but at the same time it wasn't great it was just good for a quick Korean BBQ fix but not really for super good quality meats. I suppose $25 per person is kind of fair."}
{"text":"Ok-being korean and living in Los Angeles, we're spoiled by the  abundance of Korean BBQ restaurants, so when i went to visit my friends in AZ and they wanted Korean BBQ, I relied on yelp  and wasn't  disappointed!   We all ordered the all-you-can eat bbq for $24 bucks and we definitely got  our money's worth. The quality of the meat was fantastic.  Actually, i was surprised that the meat was far superior than some korean restaurants in LA. We ordered the galbee, herb galbee, bulgogi, tongue (yum, my favorite), chadobaegi (thinly sliced non marinated meat) and my friends loved it all, but their favorite was the galbee. It was marinated perfectly, it was juicy and very tender.   There is a downside to this review, though. :( 1). The panchan selection, now, i'm not a fan of panchan (side dishes) but i was a little surprised by the lack of it. Very simple, only 4 small sides, but whatever, that's fine for me, but my friends were a little disappointed since they were spoiled by more selection of sides 2). They do charge you for extras, like rice. Again, i'm used to rice, sides and veggies to be included with the price you pay, but it's definitely different from Cali. If you're a meat lover, just order the meat and you will love it, i guarantee it!!   Overall, the service was fantastic,very attentive, and the food was great! Definitely should try this place out, it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Great service.  Nice, clean, modern look inside.  Menu is kept simple and good.  We didn't try anything that we didn't like.    Spare Ribs to grill were good.  Lots of them, enough to share.  Ordered the vegetables for $10 as well, a bargain that was very tasty.    Ordered the seafood sticky pot, which was very good as well.  $45 for all of it, plenty of very tasty food for two adults and a child.  I'm not a korean food expert by any means, but for what I paid, I felt I got fresh, tasty food.  And our waitress was absolutely outstanding."}
{"text":"Got down on some of this when they had a deal on Groupon. The food is pretty good. I believe they do have an all you can eat option for about $25 which I didn't do but in retrospect I prolly should have as I would have gotten more for my money. something I didn't like is how they charge you extra for ever single little add on (like rice and vegetables). That's why I'm saying the all you can eat is a better value cause it includes all that. Cause isn't it a given I'm gonna want some rice with my grilled meat??? Any-who...I will be back but this time better prepared :)"}
{"text":"This is located next the skating rink and target on the corner of 43rd and Peoria. There used to be another Korean restaurant at this same location, but was closed down a few years ago, may it RIP.   So.... here's the good: the Kalbi Tang (short rib soup - $12) was pretty good - lots of meat, good flavor. The Dolsot BiBimBap (stone bowl rice ~$11) had a good variety of veggies, but overall was only average; the bowl just wasn't hot enough to get the rice crispy. The kimchi (the napa and the radish) were good and spicy. The service was really good and attentive.  Here's the bad: The banchan (side dishes) - at korean restaurants, you get a variety of banchan with your meal, which is FREE with free refills. At this place, we each got a divided dish of 3 banchan - sweetened potatoes, cucumber kimchi, and potato salad. Kinda cool to get our own, definitely not cool to only get 3 banchan.   THEN, we got 1 divided dish of regular kimchi, radish kimchi, and the SAME cucumber kimchi we all had for the whole table. So that's 5 banchan TOTAL. Uh. That sucks. And 3 of them weren't even good! seriously. the potatoes were gross. rawr. The soondubu ($10-11)was pretty tasteless -they didn't ask how spicy my bro wanted it, and it was really meh.   The pricing is pretty standard - nothing special. Nothing that would drive me out here again. Thankfully, I have a few more months left of living near Koreatown in socal, so I'll eat it up before I have to move back to Phx. Hopefully, Seoul Grill can step it up by then. They can afford at least adding a veggie pajun or marinated soybeans to their banchan."}
{"text":"Nice and clean and comfortable spot for Korean BBQ in Glendale.   It is tucked away in a very odd strip mall off of 43rd. Ave and most of the diners are Korean. I enjoyed the Korean music videos playing on the flat screens while I was having dinner.  Panchan is a little bit on the light side here- both in quantity and variety, but the kimchi and the fish are really, really good. The menu is one of the easiest to decipher for non Koreans.  We ordered the pork tenderloin and the bulgogi and both were very good. Prices were reasonable, but the portions were on the small side and rice was an extra charge.   I would come back for the all you can eat BBQ deal!"}
{"text":"I hate giving 1 star reviews but it had to be done.  I saw a groupon for this place and decided to check it out. I'm from Southern CA where delicious Korean food are in abundance and I seriously did not have high expectations for this place so I'm surprised that I was still so disappointed. To be fair, I wanted to visit this place twice before I review and by the second time the korean music video that was constantly playing got really annoying.  1st visit: My overall opinion of the food is that there's every little substance and the portion is quite small for the price. I ordered the seafood tofu soup. There were 1 small shrimp, 1 clam, 1 mussel, and a 3 (I counted) pieces of octopus/squid floating around; the rest were tofu. The soup tasted very plain but super spicy. It was like they pre-boil everything, dump it in water and add a bunch of spice. My boyfriend ordered the galbi (short ribs) stone pot. The short ribs were delicious (too bad there were only a few pieces) but everything else was also plain (even after he dump in a bunch of sauce). The service was also very lacking. It's somewhat understandable because there was a party of about 60 people but it's annoying that our water was never refilled, we sat there for 5 min trying to flag down a server to get the check and in the end had to go to the front desk to pay.  2nd visit: We came back for the short ribs but this visit was even worst! A server sat us down and we asked for water. 3 min later, a second server came: we told her to get a plate of short rib started while we decided what our 2nd dish will be; again we asked for water. 10 min later, a THIRD server came: we ordered the the fried rice and for the THIRD time, water. A few minute later, server #3 came by (w/o water) looking confuse and ask us to repeat everything. They should really communicate with each other. Finally, food and water were served. The few tiny strips of short ribs that were brought out tasted nothing like what I had the first time! They were PLAIN! No flavor what so ever! The fried rice was super greasy and also no flavor (beside lot of sesame oil). We couldn't even finish it and the portion was small. When my boyfriend asked for more of one of side dishes to take with the leftovers he got denied.   For the price they charged, I expected a lot more! The portion, flavor, substance, and service were all very lacking."}
{"text":"Unlike LA, there aren't that many Korean restaurants in AZ. Definitely none really stick out.   For Korean BBQ, I think Seoul Korean Grill is the best. Their marinade for the meat is perfect. Sweet, Salty, Tangy, and wonderful. The meat is tender as well, and when you grill your own meat, it is DELICIOUS.  Galbi and Cold noodle combo is off the hook  They were very accommodating and friendly.  Like any other BBQ place, it can get pricey. it's well worth it."}
{"text":"Uh....fail...i expected more from this place, but i should have known better because the last place which was here, that was good, failed.   Anyways the side dishes...uh..thanks for ripping me off, only 3 different things and four if you include the community kimchi. It was crappy sides they gave you too. The presentation of it was thoughtful, each person had their own little three spot dish which had a little side in each, but like i said ripped off.   Dolsot, bowl wasn't even close to being hot enough to get the rice crispy...it was the gross inbetween where it gets stuck in your teeth because it was hard, but still gooey. One or the other, can't be both, well it could be both, but then it will suck... (it sucked). The hot sauce which was included was more of a flavor than a spice, which made me really sad because i like spicy food.   The Soondubu (seafood one), okay good amount of tofu in there, good seafood, but again...not really spicy... the broth wasn't that flavorful either.   only bright spot...the kimchi...two stars for that..."}
{"text":"Review UPDATE!!!!   After reading my own review I checked GroupOn for deals and I just had to eat here again!   Yes, the food is good but the management staff are lacking in foresight and intelligence. I bought a GroupOn Now for this restaurant that's main fare is ALL YOU CAN EAT. Guess what? They refused to accept it! What? $20 for $12 on a $80+ bill?   We sit down, order our first $12.50 drink, and say all you can eat, oh and, we have a GroupOn. They say \"That is not valid for ALL YOU CAN EAT\". I say, check the GroupOn fine print, there are no specifications! I spent $135 in this restaurant last time I was here. It's only $8 off!   They refuse!  I pay off the drink and walk out. I eat out nearly everyday, and I will not be going back. Perhaps the manager needs some management skills. They would have easily made $500 off me this year. It's not like they didn't need the customers, we were the only table seated as the only other patrons walked out moments after we walked in.   ~~~ Previous review.   You can get nearly any kind of awesome seafood or meat all unlimited for like $25! Oh Gosh! I love it. They actually comped a drink for me because they were out of what I wanted! Now that's great service.   The only thing they could do is have charcoal grills, they really intensify the flavor and make the meat so much better. That and temperature control (the AC was blasting so much I had to bring in my blanket from the car) are the only reasons I'm not giving them five stars."}
{"text":"Tried this place with a group of friends. The restaurant is a little hidden in the shopping center towards the back end of the shopping center but once you look in that direction, the restaurant sign is very large and visible. The entry is very welcoming and the restaurant is very spacious and clean.  The food was very good in my opinion. The Japchae was one of the best I've had. The Kalbi is tender and flavorful. And yes, they have the tables where you can grill the meat right there and leave smelling of lovely korean BBQ. Service was friendly and attentive. Overall I really liked Seoul Korean Grill and feel confident that the good quality food and service will make this place a success. It's also great that they can accommodate  large groups and is kid friendly. We will be going back here again."}
{"text":"Very friendly & helpful staff, plus good food. The free soup was very tasty, it could have been a meal in itself. The bulgogi was marinated perfectly and tender when grilled. The side dishes were a little lacking and not what I have come to expect from dining in Korean restaurants in Chicago, New York and Seoul. However, it was a good experience and we left full and satisfied."}
{"text":"Had the lunch specials here, the food was very tasty.  Although for first time Korean go-er's like me.  Get something that you're sort of familiar with.    I recommend the lunch combo's-num 1 Steak was very good--and you still get to experience the different flavors of Korea.  Only two stars, becasue i'm not sure if it was the squid soaked prawns and or scallops that made me nauseated or something else that was prepared for us at the restaurant...my point is later on that eveing i felt very sick to my stomach.  But i have no idea what it was i ate that made me feel that way.  Sorry--no more Korean cuisin for me:)  I tired it, and that was good enough!"}
{"text":"Ate there last night.  The Garmin GPS still called it Ewha Korean BBQ, by the way.  The have an all you can eat option, but it's $25.00, so the family chose menu options.  Bulgogi, spicy pork and the chicken, rice for a buck, and we told the waitress to bring all the kimchee she could muster.  She only brought winter cabbage, cucumber, fishcake, and something else..  The chef sent out a bowl of marinated leaf lettuce on the house.      I'm obviously not Korean, though I did live in Korea for a year and ate out pretty much every day.  After  that, I lived in SoCal for 12 years, ate at places that were actually better than in-country eateries, shopped at Korean food markets, own several Korean cookbooks, make kimchee at home, and have impressed Korean Nationals with my ethnic cooking.  Point being, I am a critical judge when it comes to this sort of thing.        If you can't make it to Yongsan-gu tonight, try a particular Korean BBQ in Riverside, CA, the all-you-can-eat place near the Tyler Galleria.  If you can't get to Riverside, then eat here, the Seoul Korean Grill.  Order off the menu, save yourself 45 dollars, and have a Jinro or two.  Pretty damned authentic."}
{"text":"If not for the Groupon offer, I might never have come to Seoul Korean Grill. So I was quite excited to come here with a friend and know that we could slash $30 from the bill and indulge in two meat options. Since I've never been to a Korean grill before, I hadn't the slightest of what to do. But the helpful staff and my experienced dinner companion helped me out.  We ordered the steak and chicken as our meats, and the server fired up our table grill and laied out our first batch of meats to grill. Side items were also brought out in small bowls and each was unique and tasty.  While I look forward to returning, it must be said that this isn't a cheap date sort of place. Dinner runs around $20 per person. Not crazy expensive."}
{"text":"Quite disappointing when I expected the same flavor and price when I was in LA.   Don't get me wrong, the waiters/waitress were super friendly. We ordered bulgogi and ribs. The food was flavorful but average. No refills for the side dishes when you are grilling at the grill-your-own-bbq table.   Extra: went with a groupon deal but still ended up paying way more than expected and received less food.   TL;DR: ok place for food, clean, but does not justify the price."}
{"text":"I think Seoul Jung, which was the restaurant I believe was here was two restaurants ago, had the best food.   For Seoul Korean Grill, they've updated the place so it looks modern and have gotten rid of the mediocre sushi because Americanized sushi really doesn't have a place in Korean food.    I took a friend and her two kids to introduce them to Korean BBQ.  We ordered the marinated ribs and chadol (brisket).   We also ordered the pancakes and seafood soondoobu soup.    The side dishes weren't very good, no one touched theirs after tasting them.    The chadol was pretty bland, but that's always a hit and miss wherever, unless you're in LA and everyone really does use Angus beef.    The marinated ribs were supposed to be my savior but they were overly marinated in what tasted honestly like beef jerky marinade.  The used so much tenderizer, usually pear juice, that the meat lost all sense of what natural beef is supposed to feel like in your mouth.  They all felt like moist teriyaki beef jerky in your mouth.  Also, the grill doesn't get hot enough to char the meat or the marinate.  Therefore the grilled flavor is missing; which I think is an important piece.  Another important piece missing from the table were the lettuce.  Nothing to wrap the meat in before popping them in your mouth.  They were also missing the shredded green onion \"salad\" that usually accompany Korean BBQ.  You add it with the meat, ssam jang, and rice into your lettuce before trying to stuff it all down your throat.    It's all very overpriced, so if you're feeling like mediocre Korean food in a nice, clean, modern atmosphere....  Seoul Korean Grill is for you!"}
