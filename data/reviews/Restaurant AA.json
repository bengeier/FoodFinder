{"text":"A.A. is for Original Gangsters only.  Ok, maybe not, but I know you smell what I'm cookin.   I walked into the mostly empty shop on a cold late afternoon while the owner / cook / triple O.G. was choppin' it up (conversing) with his triple O.G. coterie. Time definitely stops when you walk in, as the decor - or anything really, for that matter - hasn't changed in over 50 years, per the owner.  My quest to find Montreal's most satisfying hot dog led me here. I got one 'all dressed' as they say up North, and I think it just consists of mustard, relish and cabbage. I'm not sure how the cabbage is prepped, but it was like a pseudo cole slaw topping. The dog itself was average, the cabbage didn't do anything for me, but at the very least they toasted my buns.  If you're into nostalgic restaurants and older men droppin' knowledge on us youngins' on how to truly conduct ourselves, A.A. is the place for you.    -Beantowns Finest"}
{"text":"best. poutine. ever.  I used to get insane cravings for their fries and their gravy. It's not the fanciest place but I've been going back for their poutine for years."}
{"text":"Indispensable poutine and burger joint in Saint-Henri. It seems they are recently closed for renovation but the place goes as authentic as it gets, not to mention it is affordable."}
{"text":"Good poutine is good.  Thick cut perfect fries topped with one of the best sauces and massive hunks of cheese curds.  Need I say more?"}
{"text":"There's nowhere better to have a hot dog and a poutine at 5 in the morning, NOWHERE! Andre has been grilling up the big dirty for a million years, and although he's closed for renovations right now, when he reopens, he'll keep cooking it up for another million. The portions are insane, the staff is borderline crazy, sometimes rude, sometimes amazing, but this place can't be beat. Their hours are crazy too, basically Andre will not close down shop unless it's completely empty. I've gone in at six in the morning and he's still been slinging gravy during a snow storm, the guy is insane! I usually go for the small poutine and a toasted hot dog on the side, all dressed. If I'm feeling particularly like I want to kill myself, I get the Bacon cheeseburger. If you do the same, watch the handful of bacon Andre is going to throw on the flat top. That's too much bacon! It's so good. Please reopen soon AA, I need you."}
{"text":"Ok, I've totally changed my mind about this place. The truth is, it's pretty hit or miss. Depends on who's working, what time of day, etc. I've had some of the best cheeseburgers ever here, and I've grown to like the gravy on the poutine. It's pretty much the only thing open late in st-henri so you have to deal with it."}
{"text":"Very nice staff and fast wifi connection (password is the restaurant phone number). Small poutine is actually quite large, I couldn't finish it. It's one of those opaque kinda cheap gravy style poutine but I find the amount of cheese quite appropriate. Service is fast. Would definitely come back"}
{"text":"I heard about their poutine and finally paid a visit. Our waitress Nicole suggested we try the half half poutine, one side sauce brune and the other side italian. We really liked the italian sauce and the fries are well cooked and lots of cheese!"}
{"text":"I know a good greasy spoon when I see one, and I didn't see one here.  But if your idea of low-rent lunch counter Elysium is eating an overflowing plateload of oddly-sauced poutine and a drearily-assembled steamie on a dirty countertop without a napkin dispenser in sight while ultraconservative American religious programming blares from the overhead television, you're gonna love this place.  Restroom looked like CBGB's must have in the seventies.  My lasting impression is that they've stopped giving a damn.  Bon apétit."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars!  We got the regular poutine & the bacon poutine. The poutine was good, not great. Thick gravy, flavorful, but not enough cheese curds. The bacon poutine has very little bacon. We don't think the bacon poutine worth ordering.   The place looks old, not that clean. Service wasn't that good. When we were there, there was only one guy works there. He does the cooking, cleaning, & everything else. We had to ask more than once just for a glass of water.   We spent all total about $17. If you happen to be in the area, this place is worth stopping but we don't think it's worth going out of your way just to visit this place."}
{"text":"Andre is a god amongst men. There isn't much more to be said.  Just wish they took cards! Poutine is to die for."}
{"text":"Ok, this place has really great hours. They are open something like 20 hours  a day, 7 days a week.   So, If you are in the area at 4am, this is your only option for food.  Andre, the main guy is liked by everyone and pretty overworked.   The food is not disgusting but I wish the prices were as low as the hygiene standards."}
{"text":"This is a classic Quebec 24 hours diner, with some magic in their poutine gravy and colorful clientele. If there's a hockey match playing on the TV, no one will talk to you, not even the staff. This place is as local as it gets. I find it to be the best trashy poutine in town. A classic way to end a night out or a show at the Corona Theatre. Tip: Order the mini poutine- it's big enough."}
{"text":"Ok. Now this isn't the kind of place you go to gaze upon the beauty of the restaurant.. It's a little hot-dog/ french-fry dive located in St.Henri that just happens to serve THE BEST poutine! Andre, the owner/manager/full-time worker there, makes the most delicious poutine sauce ever! Also, if your in the mood to chomp into some real meat, they have the most monstrous jumbo burgers i've ever seen.. I think i'd call them meat pancakes instead of burger patties. lol. So if your ever looking for something to soak up the alcohol in your stomach after a night of drinking, or you've just got a hankering for an amazing poutine.. A.A.'s is the place to go my friends! :)"}
{"text":"Tu te cherches une place où satisfaire ton appétit de fin de soirée et tu es dans le coin de St-Henri? Il n'y a pas beaucoup de choix. Mais il y a A.A.!   Un bon toasté, une poutine, un burger ou même un pogo fera l'affaire, right? Sérieux, c'est un diner qui me fait penser aux bons 'greasy spoons' de ce monde et dans la même ligue que le Décarie Hot Dog, Pool Room et Moe's. Ça sent la friture, l'accueil est digne de la serveuse qui y travail depuis des lunes (pensez Carmen du Rapido, mais dans St-Henri) et c'est exactement ce dont t'as envie à 3h du matin!"}
{"text":"Great poutine. Rivals La Banquise, the traditional gold standard. I'd say La Banquise has slightly better fries, worse gravy, approximately equal cheese curds (smaller though, which I think is a minus), but has the advantage of atmosphere--but AA doesn't have crazy down-the-block lineups either, perhaps because with Greenspot and an especially cool LBP branch nearby, they aren't the only game in town. They put something crazy in that gravy, very distinctive...cinnamon maybe? Something mildly narcotic that just makes you feel a special something? Cheeseburger was awesome too.  Cash only, pay after you eat."}
{"text":"One of the best greasy spoons out there, I'll be honest this is not the kind of place I've ever been without having had a bit to drink. That being said , it doesn't take away their amazing submarines and other typical dinner food. The owner and hardest working employee out there is Andre , an old man with white hair that barely speaks and is always there. He makes this place special and the food is always consistent since it's always him , whether you're there at 2 am or at 5 pm , it's him , the man never sleeps ! Overall great food and worth going for late night munchies !"}
{"text":"I remember my first year in Montréal I stumbled into A A in a drunken stupor. My friend and I ordered the poutine and this gigantic plate was placed between us. For five years since I have been frequenting here and have enjoyed every bit.  The Special sub is so large it has to be measured in width, length AND depth. It shouldn't be missed.  Service is good, a quintessential St Henri diner well worth your visit."}
{"text":"I give them 5 stars rather than 4 because they renovated and that would have been my only complaint before. As far as the food goes...top notch in its category. This guy know the art of the French Fry. They blanch the potatoes to a perfection in sweet water and they only use redskin potatoes because they absorb the least grease making them crispy and taste clean. The father and the son know the tricks of the trade inside out. The subs are great. The poutines are great. But there's one thing that makes me wake up in the middle of the night craving it (so fat I know) and that is their Italian poutine. If u want some greasy food this  is the perfect place. Perfect for a post bar visit as well they're open all night!!"}
{"text":"This place was great, the hot dogs were awesome and the poutine was one of the best I had here, this place is a must if you're in the area."}
{"text":"The hideous decor and gruff staff are part of the charm, so don't turn around upon entering. You may be shocked by the prices too, but If you're looking for genuine Quebecois casse croute, this place is true to its roots. Steamies abound, and the poutine gravy is one of the best in the city."}
{"text":"This is totally my go to place when I want a poutine or a greasy burger or something that just feels like it's out of a 50s diner (literally, not like a modern crisp version of one).  This is a far superior poutine than Banquise, if you wanna talk about \"best\" poutines.   I love places like this. Totally old school. Totally awesome. Just stuck with what works for decades."}
{"text":"Came here after reading the other good reviews on Yelp, and I wasn't disappointed - they're all true (including this one!).  When I showed up, it's obvious that this place has been around for a long time. Like a lot of the other good poutine places in Montreal, don't be food by the fact that the decore hasn't been changed in 20 years - you're not here for the ambiance.  I got the cheese burger and poutine. The burger was a good North American burger - a bit small by Aussie standards, but the toppings were all fresh. In the end, it was just a side to the \"main\" dish... The poutine was fantastic! the fries were good, fresh, but not too fried. The gravy was outstanding. It was thicker than most poutine gravies, very beefy. The cheese curds were fresh, and there were plenty of both on it.   If that seems like a lot of time to spend describing fries, curds, and gravy, then you don't know how big a deal poutine is in Montreal. I won't say it's the best in Montreal here, but if you're serious about trying the \"best of\" poutines, you HAVE to try A.A.'s."}
{"text":"I ordered the jumbo hamburger + mini poutine combo. The hamburger was very mediocre, however the poutine was extremely delicious. The gravy used was pretty unique. Despite the good poutine, there are two main issues. Firstly, it is definitely not the most economical place to eat, a burger and a small cup of poutine cost around 12$. Secondly, the main issue, is that the sanitariness was extremely concerning and disturbing, especially when you can watch the whole process of your food being made. The cashier/cook wears no gloves when cooking. He handles cooked food (burger buns, fries, lettuce and tomato slices) and sprinkles cheese on poutine with his bare hands after touching money, coins, newspaper, raw meat (food poisoning concern) and god knows where. He touched all of that I mentioned in front of me.  If you are nearby and want some good poutine this is a place to go. However, eat at your own risk."}
{"text":"Don't be stupid like me and expect to have a good meal sober, drinking cups seemed recycled, gravy was weird and biggest crime is using mozzarella cheese instead of cheese curds! I'm giving it a generous star because it stays open late"}
{"text":"Missed The Mark    A St. Henri landmark but it just didn't do it for me. I had the poutne but the gravy had enough corn starch in it to kill a small horse.      I followed that up with there massive burger but it was literally falling apart at the seems.     I just went on a bad day???    Either that or they are a front.   Go to Dillalo  Waka waka"}
{"text":"The new waitress is super rude!!!! She reminds me the \"Nazi soup\" guy in Jerry Seinfeld show!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent small diner for your poutine fix.  I could only have a mini poutine while others seemed to order a burger and a regular size poutine and finish it."}
{"text":"Okay.  Best poutine in the city.  Somehow the owner, Andre, has figured out how to keep the fries perfectly crispy under that amazing gravy of his.  His poutine makes me want to go out in the St. Henri area just so I can end up at his doorstep at 3 am."}
{"text":"La sauce à poutine n'est pas bonne. Le cuisinier a échappé la boulettes de hamburger sur le comptoir et la remise dans le hamburger. La boulette n'était pas assez cuite et goûtait fort. Nous n'avons pas mangé le repas. Allez au Green spot ou au nouveau système. C'est meilleur"}
{"text":"My friend put me on to this place. Open pretty much 24/7, it a premium spot to get something else than late McDs. The Hot-Dog Michigan and bacon grill-cheese are a must for me every time. The owner, André, is there everyday making sure everybody gets served even when it's packed around 2/3 am."}
{"text":"We went out to eat something and finally we ended up here. We were eating cheese burger and jumbo burger with poutine. The burger meet was awesome!!! We loved a lot both burger. The poutine we ordered with the brown sauce. For me it was ok, but my husband loved it.  The service was fast and kind.  Just cash only."}
