{"text":"Delicious and amazing service.  The portion sizes are good too!  We had the beef donair, fries, and tabbouleh.  The large donair is huge and so much more than what we expected.  The restaurant clerk was super friendly and made everything fresh when we ordered while also socializing with us while we waited.  He even gave us a dessert which was yummy and a family recipe.  We love to try new local places and weren't disappointed.  A must try!"}
{"text":"Zero communication on order placed via UberEATS. Cancelled the order 30 minutes after accepting it. I couldn't tell you about the food because they don't have the basic skill to deliver food."}
{"text":"THIS is the most delicious shwarma in the city. The gentleman behind the counter was so friendly and helpful it was fantastic. The chicken was stellar and the customer service was just fantastic. THANK YOU!!! Yummmm"}
{"text":"After a few months off (I live pretty far from here) and tired of eating the bastardized versions of shawarma around the city, I made the trip down to 17th last night after work. This is the best shawarma in the city. Hands down. I will never cheat on you again, my friend. :)"}
{"text":"Found this gem a few days ago while looking for a cheap, quick lunch on 17th. What a lucky find! I had a beef shawarma and was immediately impressed with the quality and flavor. The meat quality is noticeably higher than the usual donair shop's offerings, as well as very fresh veggies.   The manager, Gus, went out of his way to learn our names and explain to us what makes Damascus different. Please do stop in and try out this treasure on the Red Mile"}
{"text":"Service and food were both outstanding. Gus was very friendly and enthusiastic about the cuisine. The Chicken Shawarma platter was a delicious and healthy portion of rice, salad, chicken and pita bread. The beef donair poutine was a really interesting combination of donair meat, donair sauce, cheese curds and fries. It is an excellent late night option for post-drinks!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal donairs at such a great price. I got a regular sized chicken shawarma and was stuffed; I loved how the pita on the outside got a bit crispy. Also had a bit of tabbouli salad, fries and baklava on the side and it was all great.    I will definitely be coming back here on a regular basis."}
{"text":"I had delicious chicken schwarma wrapped in handmade flatbread. So good! Warmed us right up. Plus the owner was super friendly. We may come back here on our way out of town"}
{"text":"By far the best donair shop in the area. Came across this place 2 1/2 years ago and absolutely fell in love with it. It has a wide variety and I tried most of it and all of its good. Go on in and see Gus."}
{"text":"Simply amazing.  We took the kids to try something new, having an obsession with Mediterranean food myself, and it was well loved by all. I ordered for everyone - beef donair, light on sweet. Chicken shawarma - spicy. Falafel wrap - spicy. Meat pie. And last and most glorious. Chicken shawarma poutine.  I can't tell you how amazing this was. You really must go try for yourself. The owner took really great care of us. He takes great pride in his food. He even gave the delivery drivers a hard time for not being prompt, letting them know that his food must arrive hot and fresh or it needs to be remade. Having lived in San Francisco and missing my most favorite Mediterranean restaurant (cafe zituona - super falafel is BEST), and now living in Montana, I really needed a good taste of some cultural cuisine. And I'm so glad my family loved it!"}
{"text":"One of the best shawarma places in the city. Easily the friendliest staff I've ever encountered and they seem to be one of the only places that offers a donair/shawarma poutine which is phenomenal! I can only recommend going here"}
{"text":"I'm from Toronto and have had plenty of amazing shawarma in my time. This is the best shawarma I've had so far. No joke. Something about the way they roast the chicken is incredible (I was sober when I ate it :-) I enjoyed it so much I had to order a donair as well. So good as well. It's tucked away, off the street, but it's worth it. Big thanks to the amazing meal I had here. Thank you Gus (the owner, really really nice guy!)"}
{"text":"Great food, owner is friendly and personable. Best donair in town for sure! Try the mixed donair with cheese, so good!!"}
{"text":"It took a couple years of living in Calgary to find a delicious shawarma but I finally found it at Damacus. Come here every Thursday night now and it is always perfect. Forget about all those other places your friends recommended and come here instead! Good, friendly service as well."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and it was perfect. Great service, delicious food, freshly made. Owner is super charismatic and gracious. Really generous portions (I'm a light eater and couldn't quite get through all of mine but it made for really tasty leftovers for dinner). The rice that comes with the shawarma plate is exceptional. Super flavourful and perfectly spiced. Every single thing we had was perfect but I would be happy with even just a bowl of that rice to stuff my fave with. Most people get take-out but there are a few spots to eat in. We stayed there for lunch and got a special treat of baklava dropped off for after the meal. This is probably the best I've ever had. I usually find it too sweet for me but this was just perfect. Would definitely eat here again! Boyfriend said this is the best shawarma he's ever had and he's had quite a few all across Canada."}
{"text":"This is our weekly stop for my co-workers and myself. Close by and so so good, we order platters sometimes so they cut up the shawarmas in pieces and their fries are awesome, especially with the sauces(garlic,tahini,sirachia) . This family owned and run does a great job with service, and quality, my kids go there for lunches as they offer student specials. Must try if you like donairs and shawarmas."}
{"text":"We visited Damascus at midnight after leaving a Christmas party where there wasn't many veggie options. My partner and I shared a large falafel wrap ($9) which was plenty for a late night snack for two. The shop was clean, the veggies fresh and the two men behind the counter were friendly. If you're in need of a fresh late night bite, visit Damascus and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Still completely amazing. I want to talk poutine now.  Is poutine Syrian? Absolutely not. But it's also arguably not even \"Canadian.\" Ask anybody from Montreal and they'll lecture you about how poutine is Quebecois, and that the rest of Canada cannot lay claim to it. I understand this sentiment and we as Calgarians should do the same with ginger beef and Caesars. We invented them. But erecting provincial borders isn't how we roll in Canada, and I find some poutines in Calgary to be completely superb. On or near 17th Ave SW, the two best options, with excellent fries, good rich but not too salty gravy, ample cheese curds, and a little lagniappe of love, are Cluck N Cleaver and, yes, Damascus.   Why Damascus? Because it's not only perfection on those three criteria but also because it offers a poutine made with chicken shawarma (you can get plain and beef donair too, but I've only had the chicken), and following their recommendation I got it with garlic and sweet sauce- see, it's not Syrian, sweet sauce is a Haligonian invention, and so we have this fascinating amalgam of Quebec, Halifax and Syria in a box that merits intrigue even if it doesn't taste good.  Spoiler Alert: IT TASTES GOOD. It is incredibly delicious. I think the shawarma poutine should be our version of Dutch kapsalon: a massive pile of fries, gouda, kebab meat, salad, garlic sauce, and sambal that encapsulates the ethnic diversity of the Netherlands in one luscious bowl of food. This can be ours. It comprises the tastiest junk food innovation from our own country with those of our immigrant cultures.   Everything is good here. Try the poutine."}
{"text":"Gus is great. He really hooked us up with awesome food. Playing good tunes and friendly attitudes. You should eat here"}
{"text":"Just a note for people who are planning to go to this place. We drove here to grab shawarma since people were raving about it. Yelp said it was open yet when we got here it was completely closed. Please change your hours to not disappoint people ..."}
{"text":"Damn good donair! The customer service was amazing, and the shop was super clean. Definitely have a new favorite donair place!"}
