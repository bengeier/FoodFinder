{"text":"Et bien j'y suis allée récemment. Une découverte géniallissime avec des produits comme j'aime, huile essentielle etc... au grand désespoir de mon conjoint. Encore un spot de plus pour des produits naturels. J'aime ça, j'aime ça j'aime ça!!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised to see a new organic market on the \"Well\" during a sidewalk sale stroll. They had some items on offer out front and some liquid tastings inside. I really like the look and feel of the store, with a lot of exposed un-painted wood plus the open feel and counter/coffee bar area. I look forward to exploring the products they stock asap. Glad to see they carry Saum-mom products. Looks like they also offer a nice sandwich board selection. ie. this is new and local place to get your quinoa and kale fix, among much other good for you stuff - or so people say is good for you - grin - pretty sure it's healthier than poutine and fries."}
{"text":"Amazing place!  Super fresh groceries and an amazing take-out counter with ridiculously good burgers (chick pea, duck etc etc), salads, smoothies, sandwiches, kombucha on tap, these crazy good maple kale chips.  Lots of great options for vegetarians, vegans, organic, and what I like is they have brands I've never seen at other health food stores. They are Probably on par with prices of other health food stores but the warmth of the employees and how welcome you feel makes you want to go back, on top of their amazing food."}
