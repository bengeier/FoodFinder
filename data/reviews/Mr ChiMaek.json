{"text":"We ordered the bacon kimchi fried rice, kimchi cheese french fries and original and spicy fried chicken. Everything was very good! I wish they open this place in Boston . Service is very friendly and attentive. Place is super clean. Highly recommended!!! We'll def. come back when we visit Toronto again!"}
{"text":"Great place to satisfy your fried chicken cravings! Kimchi fries were good and just the right amount of spice. They just opened up last week and so everything is all new. The waitress was very attentive and kept coming back to ask us how the food was and if we needed anymore water. Will definitely come back to try out their other items on the menu"}
{"text":"Service is great. Their fried chicken sauce and kimchi fries are amazing. They definitely need to get their name out there since there's not much foot traffic in the plaza."}
{"text":"A must-try for those in Markham who don't want to drive down to North York for some Korean fried chicken. Our server was very helpful and the food was amazing. I strongly recommend the boneless garlic & soya sauce fried chicken."}
{"text":"Tucked away in an old plaza is this korean fried chicken restaurant. They just opened this Tursday. The interior is very reminiscent of the restaurants in seoul, south korea. There is currently no other place that i know of that has such a trendy korean style design. 

I had the spicy chicken and it was enough for 3 people. Each piece is quite large and possibly larger than all the other korean fried chicken restaurants I've been to. The chicken was delicious and gets spicier as you eat! 

I will definitely come back and try everything on the menu."}
{"text":"Food - Rating based on fried chicken (original flavor). It was 4.5. The chicken tasted naturally tender and juicy (didn't seem to have added tenderizer). It was accompanied with vinegar radish which made the fried chicken less heavy and oily (it wasn't too oily to begin with, slight oily). However, the hot tea provided helped compensate for the slight oily sensation (versus what usually would been a pop or soda at other fried chicken joints). It would have been 5 stars if there were vegetable options on the menu, as this is a restaurant and not a fast food chain (even fast food chains are offering salad options).

Environment - Clean and modern. A clamp and fork was provided for eating so fingers/hands don't contaminate the food and vice versa, the oil doesn't pollute the hands. 

Service - Wonderful. The waitress was nice. She was willing to refill the reddish (not all restaurants nowadays are willing to refill, surprisingly).  In addition, there were little friendly gestures here and there that made the whole experience awesome.

Overall - 4.5, would recommend and come back for the food. Would have been 5 stars if the menu had some or more vegetable options!"}
{"text":"Wow....finally find a hidden gem among korean restaurants in GTA. I have never seen the interior like this...i really like it..it reminds me Itaewon or Hong-dae...if you know there.
I ordered two Hambak steak and Ddeokbokki Donkatsu. I don't know the sauce name in Hambak steak..orange color like that..anyway it's really good like a fulfil of mushroom flavour and very juicy. You should try that. Ddeokbokki Donkatsu is also enough spicy and crispy to eat. I give them two thumbs up and a big clap.
Definitely I will come back and try the others.
Waiter and waitress attitude is great as well as food. Thanks for giving me a chance to satisfy all five senses."}
{"text":"I decided to try this place because of the positive reviews. 

What I ordered:

-Half chicken with mild sauce: I believe this was $20 which is pricer than other chicken places. The chicken was juicy and tender, however it has no taste and very bland. It solely relies on the exterior sauces which taste okay. 

-Cheese kimchi fries : Don't quite understand this dish. The fries are hard/dry. The cheese was served cold and solidified with the sauce. It was like a cheese pie layer siting on top of some hard fries. Lastly the dish was $17, which is over priced for fries standard. 

On the positive side, I did enjoy the decor and atmosphere of the place.  

Would I rec it?
-For the prices they are charging, I don't rec this place."}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place to see what the hype is all about. We came on a Sunday night and didn't have to wait in line at all. We ordered the boneless chicken in wasabi dressing and the special kimchi fries. The wasabi dressing gave the chicken a very unique flavour, not overpowering but you could feel the heat from the wasabi. The fries were good, but not something I'd order again. Overall, the food was good and the server was attentetive."}
{"text":"Randomly came across this place on yelp and realized this place was relatively new. Its located in the pizza pizza plaza which at night can look kinda sketchy. The interior decoration was unique. As for the food I got the donkatsu and half a chicken with mild sauce. This is definitely enough for two people. The donkatsu was $18 and it was not bad it's everything you expect from a donkatsu. If I'm craving for a solid donkatsu this won't be my go to. As for the chicken when it came out it looked little but once you start eating it's filling. I would like to try other flavours and other side like their fries. They have a wide variety of soju flavours too! I believe the menu prices increased a little from the photos you see here on yelp.This place is a good substitute if you're craving for some chicken and beer and don't want to go all the way down to KTown for it."}
{"text":"My boyfriend discovered this hidden gem on his route home from work. Cute authentic Korean joint, although we were the only ones in the restaurant on a Sunday afternoon. 

The food was good-- ordered half and half of the Korean fried chicken with spicy sauce and the rice powder fried chicken. Also got the bacon kimchi fries and cheese sticks. We must've been really hungry because we devoured everything.

Overall a good find! It would've been great if they turned down the music just a bit :)"}
{"text":"For a few weeks I've been driving down Kennedy Rd and I'll see a glowing sign saying \"Korean fried chicken,\" so I decided to give this restaurant a try. 

Very nice atmosphere, I like their touch of all Studio Ghibli pictures up on the wall. We ordered bacon kimchi fried rice, blooming onion, and half mild half spicy chicken. The wait for the food was a bit long because they just opened it not too long ago, so cut them some slack. They know they were slow so the waitress will always come check up on us and offered us free little snacks for the long wait - super nice of them.

Finally got our food and it was worth the wait. The chicken is moist and tender and can feed a party of 3-4 people. The rice is nice in terms of flavour and portion, and the blooming onion was a really nice side dish to pair with the chicken.

The waitress and the owner are both very welcoming and nice. I'll definitely be coming back for more chicken!"}
{"text":"The regular sauce chicken was delicious. 

Rice cake was not worth it, nothing special. 

Glad to have food like this in the area. A little on the pricy side, especially given the location but will definitely come back for their chicken and try their other popular dishes."}
{"text":"SO good! The only KFC I will eat, none of that Kentucky nonsense. They really do a great job here,  the chicken is still super crispy while covered in sauce. It is also not greasy. Portion sizes are reasonable, I ordered the \"half and half fried chicken\" allowing me to get 2 flavours. I got the rice powder and regular spicy. The rice powder added a tiny bit of extra crunch but the chicken could have done without it as it's already crispy. I don't think this flavor is necessary. The regular spicy flavor was hot and sweet, not too spicy that I think I'll go for the \"very spicy\" flavor next time. It can feed 2-4 people. I would give 5 stars but there weren't many choices for sauces on the bone-in chicken. The boneless chicken had much more variety of flavours to choose from. I wish the flavours were available for both kinds of chicken. 

Small place, came on a Sunday and there was only one server. There should be at least 2! She was working so hard so I didn't mind that she may have lagged a bit when the restaurant started to fill already at 12:30 and the store opens at 12, so that speaks to the popularity already. Overall, I would come back, delicious food and kind service."}
{"text":"I can be sure for one thing... the servings here are huge. If you're not ready to be stuffed just order the half a chicken lol, which is actually smaller than the normal orders. 
I was recommended to try the \"rice\" fried chicken which was a first for me. It was basically rice being infused into the outer shell of the chicken. The rice have the chicken an extra crunch and an aroma of wheat and barley. However, cool as it may sound, the rice fried chicken was a bit dry and bland for me.

My favourite was actually the spicy or the usual fried chicken. I love how they let you choose the spice level which makes it closer to what my ideal spice level is at. The chicken used for the spicy portion of the meal was mostly dark meat as oppose to the white meat used for the rice chicken. This made it more juicy and less dry.

Overall I think I prefer the normal Korean fried chicken flavors such as honey soy etc. as oppose to the flavors offered here."}
{"text":"This is one of the Korean Fried Chicken restaurants I could find in Markham my on Yelp. The interior decoration of the restaurant is very unique. I am attracted to the Japanese animation pictures, Spirited Away, hung on the wall. Each of the light cover has the name of the restaurant spray painted on it and every table has the name of a city, such as Tokyo, Paris, Montreal etc. am sitting at the Montreal table.

As I sat down at a table I am offered with a bowl of complimentary popcorn, a small bowl of vinegar turnip and a small bowl or corn & cabbage/onion salad and a cup of rice tea. I can ask for unlimited refill. The tea tastes sooooo good! I ordered a padak (boneless) fried chicken with scallion. The sauce tastes like honey mustard. I am not used to be a fan of scallion but the dipping scallion in the sauce, I can eat almost all of them. It's amazing. The chicken is boneless, and I could take a big bite. 

The service is excellent and I do admit that the price is kind of on the expensive side. Nevertheless, with good food and service, I would want to come back to try other flavour of fried chickens."}
{"text":"Immediate thoughts of leaving the restaurant, overpriced.

Lmao 17 dollars for kimchi fries.

But I'm giving this establishment a 4 because of its bathroom. Seriously check it out. For me personally it was a solid 3.5.

A friend of ours really craved Korean fried chicken so we just had to check out this place. We wanted to get an idea of how they execute their chicken dishes so we got the full chicken and the boneless.

We decided to get the full chicken ($38)
I don't know why but another friend pushed for spicy. So we got the very spicy sauce. Spoilers, it's spicy. Couldn't have access to data to see how other yelpers find how spicy everything was. 

We should've opted to do the half and half but we didn't have the information at the time.

Full chicken with very spicy sauce (3/5) $38

To me personally I don't like whole fried chickens. Do I really want to eat the back? No not really. I prefer more  white and dark meat pieces. 

The sauce was not that unique, it sweet, spicy and sticky. It clings to the fried chicken nicely. The issue was the fry. I understand sauced chicken would not be that crispy but there still should be a good amount of crisp. In the past, I've experienced better executions of this dish. The spiciness creeps up on you and have an extended burn, my friends drank so much water lol. 

Boneless chicken with creamy wasabi (4.5/5) $24

This was definitely my favourite dish at this place. It tastes like if Taiwanese popcorn chicken and Japanese karage had a baby. 

Boneless and flavourful, the creamy wasabi compliments the fried dark meat perfectly. My issues would be the fry could be more crispier and too little sauce. (Psst you can ask for more)

Overall

Great place to share food with your friends. What it lacks in crispiness, the decor makes up for. 

**** Price comparison
Chicken monster is only 15 dollars for their boneless. Lol."}
{"text":"Always passed by this plaza but never knew there is this fried chicken restaurant! The restaurant is small but still have good enough tables. The service is really good and always come checking if you need help. Now the main review: fried chicken. Order their original fried chicken and wasabi fried boneless chicken. They both good. The lady said each order is for 1-2 person, so the portion isn't too small. The original fried chicken is a whole chicken so definitely it's for 2 people. But the wasabi fried chicken may barely be enough for 2 depending how much each person can eat of course. Overall, I love both their service and fried chicken. Would definitely come back for their other popular menu; everything on there looks good to be honest, lol."}
{"text":"Finally decided to try this place out. We came on a Thursday night so it wasn't that busy. We were quickly served by the waitresses and got seated. I love how the environment gave us a comfortable feeling. We decided to get the spicy rice cake and fried chicken with scallions. The spicy rice cake taste average but the fried chicken tasted amazing. Would be coming back for the fried chicken!"}
{"text":"We ordered bacon cheese French fries and half original fried chicken. The fries were absolutely delicious and the portion was in a decent size. The fried chicken was not as good as Home of hot taste but it was average. This place is a bit pricy. The fries was $17 and half a chicken is about $20. Will definitely come back for the French fries. YUM."}
{"text":"Access
This plaza is so small, the restaurant should probably move somewhere else. There were probably 1-2 parking spots left by the time we arrived and it was only 7pm on a Saturday. God knows what people have to do when they arrive at 8pm. *Wipes sweat*

Service
The wait staff were pretty nice, but ladies it's a Saturday so why are you so understaffed. If the hike in minimum wage is causing this, can they at least hire someone to work from 7-11pm? How can there only be 2 people working at a chicken wings place on a Saturday night? That's insane. They were as attentive as they could be, gave us a pot to refill tea on our own lols. I just want to comment that the restaurant has very simple decor - and that's totally fine. However, now that Toronto is experiencing temperatures down to -15...it would be nice if they turned the heat up a bit. We were freezing where we sat (table at the back) and had our jackets on for quite a long time. They also gave us some trouble in the beginning because they couldn't sit a party of 6...you kidding me lol.

Food
Okay, you ready? This is not the average review, in fact, I'm going against the norm on Yelp..so be prepared lols. We ordered 2 whole chicken and an appetizer. And to give you some background info, Korean fried chicken is never cheap. However, $34 for a whole chicken is like theft. I mean I came in knowing the price (checked online), but I was expecting to be wowed. Anyhow, our first batch is the original chicken. Super crunchy skin, exactly how I like it, but damn that batter is thick. Second, while the meat is hot and steamy, it wasn't tender enough. I'd like to add that it was a bit dry. Second batch is the mild spicy chicken wings. They probably bathed the chicken in that sauce twice, and added more for funsies. That whole basket is filled with sauce, a little overkill in my opinion. Mild is not spicy, so if you want to be adventurous, skip this please. The taste was forgettable, I have no idea what I ate because it was so average. The sauce was okay, like I said a little bit too heavy, somewhat sweet, and honestly not worth $34. If I had to choose between the 2, I'd go for the original fried chicken. I do want to mention that we got the rice cake appetizer that costs around $17. This dish is an absolute delight, the sauce was super yummy. I love how the glass noodles absorbed the sauce and the mixture of food was a nice surprise. It was hot, it was all the right textures mixed together...minus a reasonable price. For $17, I expect to have TWO of these mini pots."}
{"text":"It's a hidden gem in a location that nobody would have expected to find a Korean Fried Chicken restaurant. 

Environment: Hip, dim and have an urban-rustic decor. 

Service: Attentive and quick. They serve you popcorn once you're seated. We got there around 6:30 pm on a Saturday night and just beat the crowd that started to show up at 7pm. When we were done our meal (around 8:30), people were still in line waiting to get seated.

Food: Their fried chicken used to cost $30 but now costs $34 for an entire chicken. They increased their price due to the recent inflation of minimum wages. And you'd see a notice about that on the door. I tried their spicy fried chicken, rice powder and fried chicken in mild sauce. Their chicken was done very well. Very Crispy on the outside and still tender and moist inside. Even with a takeout, the chicken remained crispy. The rice powder had nice flavour and the rice powders all over it added extra crispiness. The spicy sauce could have a strong spicy aftertaste but it was very addicting. The mild sauce was a wonderful option for those who can't eat spicy and it was still very tasty. I'd say each portion roughly feeds 2 men or 3 ladies. I also tried their Budae Jjigae table cooking served for 2 people ($35). It came with spam, sausage, beef, kimchi, tofu, ramen noodles, cheese & some veggies. The dish was served on a stove. But I find it a little turned off by the fact that the hostess only had to add water into the pot in order to make the soup base. I'd prefer not knowing I could potentially make this at home quite frankly. They also gave us corn salad and radish on the side to go with your food. The only complaint here so far was that their draft beer option was quite limited. When I was there, they didn't even have Sapporo which was actually one of the 2 draft beers on their menu. 

All in all, I'm so happy to have a Korean Fried Chicken place opened in Markham. Now I don't need to go all the way to Yonge to satisfy my cravings. I'd definitely come back again to try out other dishes."}
{"text":"Its a pretty good Korean Fried chicken place. The plaza isn't the best for anything though. Parking is pretty bad as well. However, the service and food overall is satisfactory. No complaints."}
{"text":"Definitely some of the best Korean Fried chicken in Markham! While the price is a little steep ($33/basket), the basket is more than enough to feed three people comfortably. Plus, the chicken is not just dark meat, but has bits from the entire chicken! Having gotten the half and half basket - half spicy, half not - I can comfortably say that both have an abundance of flavour. Besides the fried chicken, I was recommended trying the kimchi bacon cheese fries; which were all great! The fries are thinly cut and covered in spices on their own. There was definitely an abundance of kimchi, bacon and cheese to top the fries. You are also given complimentry sides with the dish; popcorn, pickled radish, and a corn salad. Overall, a different food experience. While the price is a little more on the expensive side, it's worth trying for superb quality, portions, and service!"}
{"text":"Ordered the soy garlic boneless fried chicken and fries and both were delicious.  Extra points for being accommodating to the fact that we had to get everything togo when my daughter suddenly had a stomach ache(wasn't from the food from chimaek).  With the draft specials and good drinking food, is a great place to just chill with the homies."}
{"text":"Parents went to check out this place & i got to try the leftover takeout. They said the chicken was dry and pricey for what it was. It tasted ok in my opinion but lacked flavour. Definitely think kfc or popeyes taste better for a fraction of the price"}
{"text":"KFC joint for the people in Markham. Been here a couple times already and its safe to say that its worth checking out, especially if you are too lazy to travel to North York.  

Please Note: My rating is mainly pertaining to the Fried Chicken

Food: When I go for \"KFC\", my touch bases is pretty much only Fried Chicken. I've tried all the spice levels and be for warned that the extreme hot sauce version is basically the same sauce that is used in the \"Spicy Noodle Challenge.\" Can be deadly for the ill prepared. Quality of the chicken is decent but on occasion you do get pieces that are mainly just bone. 

While they do offer other dishes on the menu, I wouldn't necessarily recommend it. Rice cakes and the fish cakes were underwhelming especially for the price of those dishes. 

Service: Friendly and Attentive, you cant really ask for more its not fine dining. 

Ambiance: The joint comes off very hipster-esc. Very chill environment which is a perfect place to just hangout while eating fried chicken. 

Overall, a welcoming addition to the Markham area. Prices are definitely higher in comparison to other Korean Fried Chicken restaurants, but its a convenience over price situation for me to which I am willing to pay for. I do recommend checking the place out."}
{"text":"The interior looked really nice. But it was a really hot day and unfortunately, the a/c wasn't turned on so my friends and I were quite hot during more than half of the time we were eating there. But anyways on to the food. We ordered soy sauce and garlic flavored boneless chicken, regular spicy fried chicken, and honey and butter boneless fried chicken. Sadly, all the three dishes weren't up to par how I would like it. The chickens were quite dry on the inside and not juicy at all. Had to constantly dip the chicken in the sauce because of how dry the chicken was. The food here is generally on the pricey side. But this resto is nice to chill at on a weeknight with friends."}
{"text":"We came here for a late night snack and ordered the Garlic & Soy Sauce Boneless chicken.  We were rather impressed that it was nicely flavoured, fried, and overall, how it was still nice and moist on the inside. I'm definitely planning to come back and try other options on the menu! :)"}
{"text":"I'm so happy there's finally a korean fried chicken place in Markham!!!

Mr ChiMaek did not disappoint. We had half a fried chicken with sauce to share between 2 people, and it was the perfect quantity! It may seem a bit expensive right off the bat when you look at the menu, but the portions are quite big so you really don't need to order too much. I almost wish they had quarter chicken so i could have tried other flavours! It was fried perfectly - not too greasy, thick battered, or overly fried. One thing i do think they can improve on is the sauce - it was a little cold in some areas. 

It also took some time for the food to arrive (there were only 3 groups of people there) but if it guarantees the freshness of the food, the wait was reasonable. The waitress there was also super sweet, which always factors into my restaurant experience ^^. I also appreciate the effort they put into their washrooms, which was very clean and \"cozy\" for a washroom. 

I'll definitely be back here again when i crave KFC :)"}
{"text":"Came here with 3 other people on a Friday at noon, we were the first ones here. There were 3 other groups of people that came within 10 minutes after we got our table. I can imagine this place being packed if we came here for dinner. The server was very welcoming and helpful when my friends were trying to deciding what to order.  While we waited for our orders, the server refilled our popcorns and water regularly without us asking. We got the fried chicken with scallion, half and half, with dry hot fried chicken, and fried chicken with sauce. They do it right. They have generous portions, and the chicken skin is crispy and not greasy, the meat is very juicy, tender and well marinated. I didn't really feel super thirsty or sleepy after eating here. I can't wait to come back for dinner so that I can enjoy the fried chicken with a beer!"}
{"text":"It's definitely a wonderful addition to the area, you can usually only find these authentic Korean fried chicken around Yonge and Finch. 

I've ordered the wasabi mayo chicken. I like the size of it, not too big like the other Korean fried chicken. The rice cake was not bad at all, right level of spice. The fishballs in the oden were small but good. I don't like it too big. I noticed that they like to put a whole egg in the rice cake and oden. 

The free appetizer corn were good, I've asked for refill like 3 times. 

The decors on the walls are Avengers, Totoro and Doreamon. Very cosy vibe. Will be back again!"}
{"text":"I didn't order food coming this time as we only came to have soju. The grape soju is reasonably priced. We had fries but the fries presentation isn't as nice. The fries are thin but it's decent. The staff is super nice. They need to have better exposure as the pizza pizza is blocking the view from the steer"}
{"text":"I would have never found this place is my friends didn't point it out to me. It is located in the tiny plaza with the Pizza Pizza across from the Milliken Community Centre. Mr chiMaek and Pizza pizza are the only restaurants in this plaza which is kinda random.

The decor was cute, covered with anime shows, marvel superhero movie posters. The washrooms were well decorated too. The place itself though is not the biggest, but considering where it is located it all makes sense. 

We walked in with a group of 6 and got a table immediately, there were probably like 2 other tables there. Good thing we came early on Saturday because minutes after we sat down the place, was packed. The menu was straightforward, a page for appetizers, mains and a full page for their basket of chicken. The price for the amount of chicken you get is totally worth it! They give you full pieces of chicken and it was all so juicy and tender. The skin was super crispy and crunch and you can taste how fresh it was. Best of all it was not soaking in oil like other fried chicken. We ordered half and half and one basket of boneless between 5 people and one kid and it was the perfect amount of food.  For appetizers, I recommend the Kimichi French Fries. 

I definitely recommend getting the chicken with the sauce though. The sauce is a game changer. 

This place can't seat parties bigger than 6 it seems though, not without a reservation anyways. The tables are generally set for 2 -4 people and they had to rearrange to fit 6. There was another party of 6 that came in when we were there and I could see that there was no room for anymore big groups. (Space and fire safety reasons) So basically call ahead if you are coming with a big group."}
{"text":"The ppl that own this place are really friendly. Lemme start off by saying I gave Home of Hot Taste 5 stars. After coming to this place I've gotta give 5 stars as well but not without some interesting factors to point out. A whole chicken is slightly bigger here than at Home of Hot Taste (whole chicken can definitely feed 2 ppl). That being said, it's also $7 more expensive, which is quite a lot (whole chicken here is $33, at Home of Hot Taste it's $26). They're both super delicious; the skin slightly more crispy at Mr ChiMaek. So I'm a bit torn on if the price to chicken trade-off is worth it. That being said, I will definitely return to try the rice powder flavor and some of the boneless chicken flavors (carbonara). I'll also try some of the side dishes (rice and fries mmmmm) on my next visit.

My verdict is that if you have a large group of ppl it's more worth it to come here. I know the new minimum wage hike is kinda ridiculous but at the same time, I can't really justify making this my go-to KFC spot for a $7, $8 price increase/per chicken. Really good chicken though, hence the awesome rating. 

Tons of anime posters on the walls and the washrooms are really pretty since it matters to some ppl haha. Beer and chicken though. Can you really go wrong?"}
{"text":"Came here with my friend cause she wanted Korean fried chicken. Per her recommendation, the chicken here taste really good. So we decided to give it a try. We got to the restaurant and it wasn't too busy yet, so not bad. We were seated not long after. The decor is unique, much like a few other Yelpers' reviews: it has lots of Hollywood movie posters/pictures mounted on the wall. Another observation I made was the tables all have a specific city marked on them, as my picture says Hong Kong. So it has a bar feel to this place to chill and relax.

I flipped thru the menu and saw it is quite simple: a clipboard with a few pages. I had to look up on Yelp to find the pictures that go with the food choices. We decided on the bacon and kimchi with fries, kind of a take on a poutine and carbonara fried chicken. Not long after, the fries came out. This tasted quite different than what I imagine it to be: a combination of sweet and savoury flavour and I love the addition of the bacon. Then the carbonara fried chicken came out not long after and my observations are: the chicken is boneless and still juicy. The carbonara sauce wasn't too overpowering, and yes there are lots of bacon bits. However, I wish they provided me with a spoon so I can drench the chicken nuggets with the carbonara sauce. Overall taste of the chicken is juicy and right amount of flavour that wasn't too overpowering.

Overall, the food was great along with the service too. Only comment I got is the price. Aside from that, not bad at all."}
{"text":"The BACON KIMCHI CHEESE FRENCH FRIES were pretty good, albeit expensive.  The fries were thin, but well seasoned and crunchy.

PADAK (BONELESS) FRIED CHICKEN AND SCALLIONS were also pretty good, with some kind of sweet honey sauce at the bottom of the dish, and the scallions added a nice balance to the heavy deep-fried nature of the chicken.  They do make their chicken quite nicely, but I did leave feeling quite heavy and bloated.  (What can you expect with fried chicken and fries?)

(Price:)
BACON KIMCHI CHEESE FRENCH FRIES: $17

PADAK (BONELESS) FRIED CHICKEN AND SCALLIONS: $28 (pricey...)

(Service:)
Great

(Ambience:)
Hipster, rustic feel to it; with posters of superheros on the wall.

(Comparable:)
There's pretty good fried chicken at GALLERIA SUPERMARKET, that's probably cheaper too!

(Overall:)
I broke my vegetarian diet to try this place. But I probably won't do it again."}
{"text":"Wanted a place that served Korean food and pretty much tried all the options that were nearby. Found this restaurant after searching on yelp and the reviews looked really good. Minus the somewhat sketchy plaza that it was located in, it wasn't that busy on a Thursday evening.

Our server was absolutely exceptional, offering food recommendations and keeping up with tea refills. She also offered us some soup and always checked in on us to make sure we were okay. 

We ordered the bacon kimchi fried rice and half portion of chicken with mild sauce. I soon learned it was waaaaay more chicken than anticipated for 2 people. I didn't think the fried rice was exceptional but I can see people returning for the fried chicken."}
{"text":"Got the honey butter chicken and bacon kimchi fries. Looked good, tasted mediocre. Got home and immediately felt sick throughout the night and early morning. Had severe food poisoning."}
{"text":"Wow. Best fried chicken I've had in a long time. Friendly staff. Love the decor and artwork on the walls l. We loved the fried chicken especially the fried chicken with regular sauce. I also liked the extra crispy  rice powder fried chicken. We ordered two orders of chicken and two bacon kimchi fries for the 5 of us. Only downer was we were split between two tables but they accommodates us and we had adjacent tables. Definitely returning!"}
{"text":"Ordered the fried chicken for take out. Was great but I'm sure even better in restaurant. Did the spicy and the green onion. Looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"I'm Korean and this restaurant's? fried chicken has the exact same taste as the one I had in Korea. I have been to this place numerous times because I live close and I love it! I always get half & half of the chicken. The portion of the fried chicken seems bigger than other Korean fried chicken restaurants. The chicken was nice, juicy, and crispy. 

I went again with my friend on the weekend and they had a new menu called \"Jjim Dak\" and \"Dakbokkeumtang\". They were both boneless chicken with potatoes and vegetable but one was with a soy sauce based and the other one was with Korean chilli sauce based. So I decided to try \"Dakbokkeumtang\" (Korean chilli based) since I like the spicy food. It came with 2 bowls of steam rice and my friend and I loved it.  

The best part of this place is that they have (half) open kitchen where I was able to see how my food is being made. As I was walking by, I saw chef cutting FRESH CHICKENS NOT FROZEN CHICKENS ... It was a big surprise for me and at the same time, it explained why the fried chicken took average 20 minutes to be served. See the photo attached.

Overall, the prices are reasonable in terms of having a high quality, good tasting food. Reminds me of home.  Love the unique interior, and friendly service. 
I will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"The name of this restaurant Mr ChiMaek comes from the word chicken and the Korean word for beer. The atmosphere is interesting with faux brick lining the walls as well as anime and superhero themed decor. The biggest table seats 6 but I did see the staff configure tables to accommodate a party of 8. At the time we went (6pm on a stormy winter Friday) we were quickly seated it it certainly became very busy by the time we were ready to go.

Free popcorn is provided to snack on as you wait for your food. The menu includes donkatsu, Korean foods like spicy rice cakes, budae jigae, kimchi fried rice, and kimchi fries. Their specialty however is Korean fried chicken. One can order whole and half fried chicken as well as boneless chicken pieces. Sauces include mild, spicy and very spicy. Given my relative intolerance to spice, hubby and I ordered the garlic soy boneless chicken pieces and an order of rice. 

Our food came out relatively quickly (about 10 minutes). The chicken was crispy, juicy, sweet and sticky with a garlicky and slightly spicy kick. It was helpful to have some rice and banchan like the pickled radish and corn cabbage slaw to cut some of the sweetness and saltiness of the chicken. Even though hubby and I were hungry when we came in, the order of chicken and rice with banchan was filling enough for us for dinner.

The food here seems pricier than other KFC places near Yonge and Finch. Our order of boneless garlic soy chicken pieces cost $27. However it was a good sized portion. Something about not having to leave Markham to get decent Korean fried chicken makes the slightly inflated prices a bit easier to swallow. The staff here are quite friendly and readily available to fill up your tea mug. I suggest going as a group of 3 or 4 so that you can try different dishes. I'm looking forward to coming back with friends and family so we can try more of the menu options."}
{"text":"I'm not usually into Korean because it's 90% beef and I am allergic, but please save your tears because I already have my own. 

This place runs not on beef, but chicken, and they make the chicken pretty snazzy in multiple ways. So there's like.. Korean fried chicken which smelled amazing. 

We got this fried cheese ordeal which actually was pretty great! New experience, definitely. The \"crust\" was crispy and the cheese was stringy and cascaded into the pan. 

We also had the bacon kimchi fries, which I thought I had posted but I guess it's gone now. It's definitely a great snack to have, and serves as a wonderful appetizer. For those who fear spice like me, have no fear!! The bacon kimchi fries are not super spicy. It's just got a little kick and if you can handle mustard then you're good to go. The fries were skinny cut and soggy enough from the sauces they put on it. 

This place is a little pricey so come only if you're dying for Korean fried chicken. 

Also, I really loved how sweet the staff were. We came in and there were no tables. They apologized and offered us a bowl of popcorn as we waited in the tiny waiting area by the window. They even had a cute little lamp by that area. :) It was super cute and nice of the staff. I certainly didn't expect popcorn.

Come if you can!! :)"}
{"text":"A really nice hidden gem located right across from Milliken Mills High School, in the Pizza Pizza plaza, this Korean owned, Korean restaurant certainly delivers.

It is in a very low key area so you have to keep your eyes out for this place. Upon entering, their signs displayed that their prices have since changed on January 1, 2018 due to the minimum wage increase. 
We were generously greeted by the staff and since we came in on a slow night, they placed us at the table printed \"Toronto\". I thought this was an interesting touch and noticed that all the tables in this restaurant printed a different city around the world. 

They offer the standard option of having half or whole chicken and their flavours and sauces. My friend and I shared a half and half of the Rice Powder and Spicy Sauce along with their popular Kimchi Cheese French Fries.

PROS:
- Their fried chicken is crispy and not dripping in oil
- They don't skimp out on quantity
- Flavours were just perfect, not too much and not too bland
- Fries was definitely worth a try
- Customer Service was great, one of the staff was still being trained but really did her best in accommodating us.
- Washrooms were very clean
- Interior decor was minimal and unique especially in Markham
- One of the very few Korean Fried Chicken locations in Markham

CONS:
- Pricier than other KFC restaurants I've been to

Overall would come back again!"}

{"text":"Do you love Korean Chicken? But do you want to find restaurant in Markham area? This is the place. Owner is Korean and he really knows how to make a Fried chicken!!
Specially Yangneom chicken is made by sweet chili Sauce"}
{"text":"Industrial, spacious; in same plaza as Pizza Hut across from Milliken Mills Library. Great service!! 

Complimentary popcorn while you wait
Complimentary Appetizers: corn coleslaw and radish (refillable)

C5 Half and Half Fried Chicken $34 (~20 pieces total. Serves 4 people)
Can choose 2 sauces from C1-C4 where I chose original + very spicy
I recommend the Very Spicy. Nice smokey flavour with a hint of sweetness.
Meat is dry especially for the white meat though the chicken is cooked per order."}
{"text":"The kimchi fries were good. The fries were crispy and sauce wasn't over whelming. Got the whole chicken (half dry:hot, half w wet sauce: mild). The chicken was moist but mediocre. We didn't finish everything but could serve for 3. 

Wish the the other special flavours chicken weren't too big and one flavour only as we were only 2 people and didn't want to order the entire platter ourselves. 

The restaurant was pretty quiet when we went on a weekday."}
{"text":"I'm not a fried chicken type of girl but I have that craving once in awhile, especially on a late winter night. Got here at 10:30, closes at midnight. Perfect. Waitress was really attentive and would fill our waters and side dishes without prompting. We had half and half chicken so we could try different 2 different types; we had spicy powder and wet mild spicy chicken. Chicken was hot and yummy. It's nice to have a Korean fried chicken spot in Markham. But after my fried chicken craving is satisfied.... I'm good for another awhile.  I'll definitely be back when I need my fried chicken fix. 

Extra notes: techno music in background, can be loud; decor is pretty hip but darker environment; washrooms are beautiful; they take visa and MasterCard payments"}
{"text":"Although I was a bit disappointed that there were no fried chicken options in single serving portions, the food I ate was pretty amazing. First time I had fried chicken that didn't make my stomach hurt after eating it because of the grease. The chicken was light and juicy. I also ordered the Bacon Kimchi Cheese Fries which was also Spectacular. I am usually not a huge fan of fries but this was really good. My only complaint is that I prefer more spices to my chicken and the original version does not have much, which is my preference and not the restaurant's fault. I should've ordered the spicy version. The service was excellent. Very polite and attentive. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Definitely a restaurant that brought this plaza back to life! The food is pretty good, a little bit pricey though. It's definitely a shareable food type of place. You get a whole chicken cut up and fried with your desired flavour for $35. 

It was my first time there so wasn't too sure what to expect. Ordered the boneless soy sauce chicken as well as a Half-and-Half that was half spicy half original. 

Food came out and each was brought in a basket...but then a third basket came out...I had no idea what portion size was like but it seemed like a lot. When we got the bill instead of marking it as half-and-half, they charged us for a full spicy chicken and a full original...so we're now paying an extra $35 ...

Moral of the story... confirm your order twice...just in case..."}
{"text":"We ordered the half and half ($34). We got half a original chicken and half a chicken with mild sauce. The chicken with the sauce is much better than the original chicken. The sauce is flavorful and the mild sauce was not spicy at all. The original chicken was only alright. I wouldn't want to order it again. I liked how it was not as greasy as ordinary fried chicken but thought it needed more flavor. 

The chicken came with 3 side dishes. Popcorn (it was microwave popcorn, just in case you wanted to know), pickled radish cubes, and some corn dish. The popcorn came out while we were still waiting for our food while the radish and corn came when our food arrived. 

Service here could be better. Our food took ~30 minutes to arrive and they didn't seem that busy as the other tables already had their food. The waiter was okay. She did check in on us and refill our side dish but she could talk more clearly. 

I enjoyed the decor here. The entire restaurant was dimly lit and the walls were a dark color covered with wall art.

The location of the restaurant doesn't seem ideal. It is located in an old plaza that doesn't seem to have any business. But I guess that could be a good thing considering the parking lot is quite small and it would be difficult finding a spot if the neighboring tenants had business. 

Overall wasn't a bad experience but I don't think I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"Chimaek is dope. Close to home and effing. Would recommend their bacon Kim chi fries. Kinda pricey but so worth. Their Korean spicy sauce is good too. Definitely recommend it over other their non-sauce flavours. The restaurant also gives you unlimited free popcorn in the beginning. Helps warm up the stomach before you go to town. Would recommend this place."}
{"text":"I would have never thought that there would be a Korean restaurant on Kennedy in this small plaza with limited parking. However too bad! The restaurant itself fits approximately up to 50 people. It is cozy and is decorated with anime, which makes it fun and interesting. I like the characteristics of this place and the beer and fried chicken sign!! 
We visited on a Saturday at 6pm with no reservations and there were quite a few tables available. We were a table of 4 and were seated in front of the kitchen which is a good spot to flag down the servers. Once we sat down, we were served water ....and popcorn!!! Love this idea especially if you are waiting for your friends to arrive and popcorn is the perfect munchie. So let's talk about the food. We ordered 3 items which included the Boneless fried chicken with green onion, half and half chicken and the Odeng. We were served corn coleslaw and pickled radish with our meal. My friend and I were disappointed that they didnt have corn and cheese which is a staple item at a fried chicken place (in our opinion!). The odeng was loaded with different types of fish cake, enoki mushrooms and an egg. This Korean fish cake soup is a common item but it felt a bit Japanese. It is still satisfying and good though so I do recommend it if you want something to go with your \"fried\" meal. Now to the items we came for...the chicken! To be honest I think I have had better fried chicken but this was alright. The boneless green chicken was tasty and it was a hit amongst my friends cause of the yummy sauce. As for the half and half, the mild saucy one was the better of the two which we chose the original fried chicken as the other half..it was just meh! Nothing special. I would recommend to try the ones with the sauce or flavours. They also offer katsu which is something different and I too thought was a bit Japanese than Korean. 
One thing to note is the guys wanted a pitcher of Sapporo since they offered it on tap but we were told it would only be ready in 2 hours. It is a bit disappointing when you go for fried chicken and beer and the beer just isn't ready..am I right? Anyways the guys still ordered beer in a bottle and we still made it a great dinner night out!

So there are not many fried chicken and beer places around the area and the vibe of the restaurant is enjoyable so do try it out if you have a craving and are in the area!"}
{"text":"Thumbs up! Had the carbonara fried boneless chicken. The chicken was crispy and juicy on the inside. The portion is more than enough for two people. 

We also had the onion rings with the honey butter flavour. The honey butter is like condensed into a powder form and sprinkled onto the onion rings. The first few bites are sooo good, but you do get stuffed very quickly from this due to the butter-ness. 

We didn't go for the kimchi fries because it was rather pricy...

Overall, would definitely come back when I'm on a fried chicken crave!"}
{"text":"Really delicious Korean fried chicken. I really liked the free popcorn and the unlimited refill of pickled radish and corn salad as well.  The place is small so go earlier if you can.  Parking lot is very small so park across the street at McDonald's and walk over."}
{"text":"It's finally nice to see a Korean fried chicken place in Markham. This restaurant took over Lee's Wok location and offers new flavors that I have yet to see at other Korean fried chicken restaurants in North York. I ordered the half and half chicken (fried chicken with sauce and the rice powder chicken). The pieces are huge, fried very well, and can definitely serve over 2 people. I am definitely coming back with my friends to try out all the other flavors."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating Korean Fried Chicken & I enjoyed it! It's also quite pricey - $45/person, with drinks.

First, I really love the ambiance of this place. It is small and quiet with an industrial superhero/old movie theme. Great for conversation. The server was very friendly. 

For 2 people, we shared: 
-  1/2 order rice powder chicken - the rice powder doesn't add any flavor, but I love the crispiness of the skin
-  1/2 order regular sauce chicken - tasty sauce, quite spicy for me, but got used to it after the first piece
- Kimchi bacon fries ($17!) - super skinny shoe string fries. Not hot enough !! the cheese was hard, didn't melt through
- 1 Stella & 1 grape soju ($20!)

Complementary sides include radish cubes, fresh popcorn and corn & onion."}
{"text":"KFC!! By KFC, I mean Korean Fried Chicken (not Kentucky). 

Chimaek is a term in Korean meaning \"fried chicken and beer\" Chicken and Maekjoo (beer). Plus, this is the second Korean place with the name \"Mr\" in front, like Mr. Chu at Yonge and Finch. 

Mr. Chimaek is a small place tucked in a somewhat hidden plaza near Milliken Mills High School. When I walked in on a Saturday afternoon, it wasn't busy. It had some customers, but the place was generally quiet (which is what I prefer anyway). We were sat down immediately in comfortable seats at tables with city names on them. My mom and I ordered the tteokbokki, plus the boneless chicken with mild sauce. Both were very good. Nice and full of flavour. I will say, this is one of the only times I have enjoyed fried chicken thoroughly. Usually with fried chicken I usually get sick of it halfway through, but this wasn't one of those times. this place has an upscale-casual vibe to it, which is good for late nights.

The only thing I'll say is that it might be slightly hard to find for some, plus it's not the most budget friendly place. But I hope people will give this place a try and have it as a marker for great KFC :)"}
{"text":"Walking into this place, I really like what they've done to it, compared to the previous business that occupied this space. Everything about it looks good - the wall treatment, flooring, lighting, and Super-Hero themed decor. They also have spacious and very clean washrooms!

There was a time when KFC meant only one thing, the Colonel's secret recipe fried chicken. These days, Korean Fried Chicken seems to be gaining in popularity at a very quick pace. You won't find me complaining about that.

Mr. Chimaek's menu is built around this delicious offering. It's offered as Original, Spicy, Boneless, with a choice of sauces, and a few other variations. Each order includes a whole chicken. Other than a couple of salads, there's really no vegetables or non-fried items on the menu. That's not a complaint.

We chose C5 Half & Half Chicken. You can choose how you want each half prepared but we chose the original recipe and medium spicy sauce. We also ordered Bacon Kimchi Fried Rice and Onion Rings.

Both versions of the chicken were very crispy and delicious. We couldn't decide which one we preferred so we may just have to order the same thing next time. The fried rice with an egg on top was also very tasty. The onion rings, with dipping sauces, was very well done.

The food was delicious, although not cheap. The portions were generous (we had leftovers). The staff were very friendly and the service was excellent. Oh, we got complimentary popcorn to nibble on as soon as we were seated. Nice touch. We'll be back."}
{"text":"This place is trendy with rustic industrial style décor.  I like their ambience a lot.  Service?  Friendly and attentive. Menu? Small.   Food? Fried chicken with spicy sauce is the best.  I came here twice.  First visit - I had chicken with spicy sauce and cheese donkatsu.  The chicken was tender and juicy; the batter is light and crispy.  Donkatsu is mediocre.  Second visit - Half original fried chicken and half with spicy sauce.  Original chicken wasn't as juicy as those with spicy sauce.  It's nice to have a Korean fried chicken joint in Markham!"}
{"text":"I ate at Mr. ChiMaek twice.  Once we ordered a half and half (original and spicy) chicken.  Another time we ordered a half spicy chicken and a Kimchi Fried Rice.  In both cases, we opted for the spice in the batter, so there was no sauce.  The chicken was made-to-order both times.  It came out fresh and piping hot.  The spicy chicken tasted quite spicy.  The original (plain) chicken was bland as expected.  I really liked the option of spicy batter, instead of pouring spicy sauce on top, because the skin remained crunchy. The dark meat pieces were moist, while the white meat pieces were slightly dry but quite acceptable.  The thickness of skin was thinner than Popeye's or Kentucky Fried Chicken's for sure.  Can it be thinner?  I don't know as I don't eat Korean fried chicken frequent enough to make a comparison.  The kimchi fried rice tasted good.  It was a bit oily.  As a sharable, the portion was small."}
{"text":"I went to Mr ChiMaek with my friend yesterday and we both really enjoyed their chicken! We ordered their original with the creamy mustard sauce on the side, and sweet potato fries. Their food is totally worth the rave! The chicken is fried to an amazing crisp. Usually, I love my sweet potato fries dipped in sauce but this one tasted great I didn't need one. The theme and appearance of the restaurant was so cute! The wall photos of famous movies didn't make sense to me a bit, but whatever! It didn't have to! The place was fantastic as it is. Little note to the side, the bathroom is nicely designed too. If you are eating here alone, the chicken is definitely pricey. It's made to be shared. Just the little fyi! Will come again!"}
{"text":"The pinnacle of Korean Fried Chicken in Toronto. Outrageously moist and crispy, a variety of flavours will keep you returning. Carbonara fried chicken is made up of bite-sized dark meat, while their whole fried chickens contain pieces from the entire bird. Would love to see dessert options added."}
{"text":"Wow - soooo tasty the fried chicken. Food is so fresh. The servers and everyone who work there are extremely friendly. The ambience as well is nice - really like the decor. We will definitely go there again"}
{"text":"Came here on a recommendation from a friend. We ordered the bacon kimchi cheese fries and half a chicken. The prices are a little steep for what the food is, but the food itself is really good. If you come, make sure it's on an empty stomach because everything is so filling!! 

I personally wasn't a fan of the fries as I thought the bacon didn't pair well with the kimchi and arrangement of sauces. The chicken, however, was amazing. It's freshly fried when you order it- hence why it takes a little longer to get your food. 

Overall, if it was a little cheaper, I'd definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I love Korean Fried Chicken and fried chicken in general and I've been wanting to give this place a try since I saw their sign go up. 

I wanted to try more flavours (not that there were that many to begin with) so we ordered the Half and Half ($34) which gave us the option to choose 2 flavours. There were only 4 choices, which is pretty limited compared to other Korean Fried Chicken restaurants. For those of you who haven't had Korean Fried Chicken, you order a whole or half chicken. You can't really order by number of pieces. From my order, each half had 8-9 pieces. 

I chose the Original Chicken flavour and the Sauce flavour in mild. There was nothing special about the original chicken. It was nice and crispy, but I found it to be a bit bland. The sauce flavour was tastier and offered a bit of a sweet taste. I definitely preferred the sauce flavour to the original flavour. 

We were seated promptly and we were the only people who didn't already have food at our table. However, despite this, it took 30mins for our food to come. Which I guess isn't that slow since they make it when you order but don't come here if you want to quickly grab a bite. I really liked the interior and the decor. 

The price of $34 is higher than that of other Korean Fried Chicken places and the food doesn't stand out. 

In all, this place was alright but nothing special. I'll be travelling to North York if I ever crave fried chicken again."}
{"text":"Waited over an hour and a half for a table. They seated couples in a four person table that came after my group of four. Food was good... regular but definitely not worth 1.5+ hour wait. The waitress was sorry and offered us free pop."}
{"text":"The staffs were friendly and from time to time they come by and check up on you. The interior design is unique. The food presentation of the kimchi fries was nice. Overall the food was good. The fried chicken was good. It was moist and freshly made. I would come back again."}
{"text":"Want fried chicken but don't want the usual KFC or Popeyes? Check out the new Mr. ChiMaek restaurant located in the heart of Markham. For a party of 4, we ordered the \"bacon kimchi fried rice w/ cheese\", \"bacon cheese kimchi fries\", \"fried chicken with scallions\" and an order of \"half and half chicken\". For a party of 4, this was definitely more than enough food! We underestimated the portions from our research aka looking at photos on yelp. We started off with the kimchi fried rice and the bacon cheese fries. Both were really good and loaded with toppings! The fried chicken dishes were perfectly crisp on the outside and juicy on the inside. The half order of the spicy chicken had a tangy flavor. It was a different type of spice. Don't let the pictures online fool you. The portions are very generous!! Service was top notch. Be mindful to go before or after the dinner rush. The restaurant is small and can get quite busy. I highly recommend coming here for a cheat meal! :)"}
{"text":"3.5 stars for decent fried chicken but pricey! This is a hidden Korean chicken restaurant in Markham in a very small plaza! We ordered the bacon kimchi cheese fries and the half & half chicken - half original fried chicken and half chicken with regular sauce for two people. The chicken is very crisp on the outside and very tender inside. I like the chicken with regular sauce, which is sweet and a little bit spicy. Bacon kimchi cheese fries is good but not wow. The portions were decent and we got a lot of leftover chicken...would recommend coming with more than 2 people if you are going to order chicken!"}
{"text":"I was curious to find out the origin of the name of this restaurant and realized that ChiMaek is derived from chikin meaning \"fried chicken\" and maekju which means beer. Just like the name Mr.Chimaek is surely the place to get Korean fried chicken. The service here was welcoming. To start off with we were given a tin of popcorn which was buttery and delicious. I munched on popcorn and flipped through the clipboard menu of items. We decided to try the bacon kimchi cheese fries, cheese butter chicken, and chicken garayaki with curry sauce.

The kimchi cheese fries were great, they have the texture of waffle fries and was drizzled with kimchi sauce, cheese, and mayonnaise. The fries tasted fresh, crispy, and nicely seasoned. 

Cheese Butter Chicken - I imagined this one to be topped with melted cheese like nachos but it is essentially chicken coated with cheese butter flavoured powder. The flavour was interesting as it had a subtle cheese flavour which eventually becomes sweet after it melts. The chicken itself was perfect, boneless and juicy. The powder although interesting did seem a little more artificial but nonetheless the chicken still tasted great.

Chicken garayaki with curry sauce was delicious as well. Served on a tin pan it comes with chicken soaked in curry sauce with a side salad and rice. The portions of chicken for this dish are slightly smaller in comparison to some Korean fried chicken restaurants but despite the sauce was perfect and chicke tasted great.

All in all I really enjoyed the chicken here. It was juicy and flavourful. The service was attentive, and ambiance was nice with a raw, industrial yet modern feel to it. A little pricier in comparison to other Korean fried chicken joints but other than that the chicken and food was tasty and would definitely come back"}
{"text":"Super nice and clean place with very friendly staff. The food was also really good and although it may seem a bit pricey I think it's definitely worth it. Staff was very attentive to us (maybe because the restaurant wasn't busy) but I'd definitely recommend.

Chicken was super juicy and the flavor was really good. Ddeokbokki was also super good"}
{"text":"New place that serves korean fried chicken near my place. Pricey for the amount of serving. Taste ok nothing extraordinary.  I enjoyed the carbonara boneless chicken and curry Katsu.


Staff are friendly and service is good."}
{"text":"As a huge fan of KFC, I had to check out this place. We got the very spicy sauce on original fried chicken ($38) and creamy wasabi fried chicken.
The creamy wasabi was dark meat, and not fried that well. It was quite soft/soggy. The sauce was delicious. The burn hit me hard behind the eyes and in my face. The server even gave us extra sauce for the bottom pieces which had less sauce. 

The spicy KFC however was way too spicy for my friends and I (not as bad as fire noodles, haha). The whole chicken was pretty crispy. They fried the back/spine, neck, and other parts that were mostly bone. Only a few good pieces, making this dish quite expensive. I found that this KFC was more expensive than other places but with the quality not much better. What makes this place worth going to is trying their unique flavours like wasabi. They had many other flavours too. But go elsewhere for the classic plain fried chicken or saucey Korean fried chicken. You can find better elsewhere!!! I honestly regret getting this KFC so much. 

The decor was lovely and unique. The washroom was also one of the nicest washrooms ever. My friend actually took photos of the inside."}
{"text":"Okay, every once in a while you come to place and you think \"Dam it the whole world needs to know what I know!!!\"  There's some dam good KFC in Markham and I'm not talking about the Colonel's chicken, but Korean Fried Chicken baby!

Mr. ChiMaek is a new joint that serves some outstanding KFC in the Markham area.  Located in the old Lee's Wok location, it's a modern hip looking joint, with Star Wars, Comic Book and Anime themes throughout the restaurant.  

Everything we had was fantastic but their signature fried chicken was the star here.  At about $30 a pop it might seem expensive but its an entire chicken and nothing goes to waste .  All the parts are chopped up and served bones and all and each order can serve at least 2-3 people.  

The Original Korean Fried Chicken was beautifully brined and tender with every bite.  The skin was wonderfully crispy and flavorful from beginning to end.

The Korean Fried Chicken with Sauce was also beautifully tender and stayed crispy in the sweet and spicy sauce.

Another standout of the night was the Bacon Kimchi Cheese Fries which was fantastic as the thinly cut fries has an excellent balance of bacon, kimchi and process cheese.

Despite all these items being fried, none of it was greasy at all.  There was also a pretty good beer list that we didn't get to try.

Service was excellent and polite.  As a side note, the washrooms was one of the coolest I've ever seen and deserves a visit alone! Haha!

Seriously these guys deserves to do well and deserves a shout out.  No need to go to K-Town for some serious Korean grub!

\"KFC in Markham!  Hear me Roar!!!!\""}
{"text":"I used to travel to North York for korean fried chicken, prob will not be doing that anymore. Great fried chicken super crispy. Recommend the original and mild sauce fried chicken. Kimchi fries was really good ( McDonald's type fries used) 
Def will be coming back."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised by this Korean fried chicken restaurant. The restaurant was a bit hard to find as the sign wasn't very visible. We made reservation for a group of 9 and got seated at two different tables (they didn't have enough space to fit a long table). The restaurant got quite busy after 730-8pm on weekends. They gave us some popcorn to start. We ordered four types of fried chicken to share. The original, spicy, creamy wasabi boneless chicken, and fried chicken with mild sauce. The creamy wasabi chicken was my favourite - loved the kick from the wasabi sauce. All their fried chicken pieces were crispy on the outside and juicy/tender on the inside. 

Each order can feed around 2, or maybe 3 people if you order some side dishes. We were all quite full and it ended up to be ~$20 pp which was reasonable."}
{"text":"I don't know if I'm being fair rating this place when I don't even like battered fried chicken to begin with so maybe I set myself up for failure. I do like Popeyes though! The batter was soooo thick here that it made me not want to eat the chicken... the waitress recommended the rice powder fried chicken which she said was tasty but it was dry AFFFFF with no distinct flavour and when we asked for some sauce she looked mad confused like she's never heard of sauce before. The kimchi and bacon fries were also cold with little to no kimchi.... ill stick with Popeyes."}
{"text":"I came on a Friday night as a group of 4 and since they do not take reservations, our wait was approx. 20-30 minutes. The chicken was delicious and the batter was nothing like what I've had at other Korean chicken restaurants, however, I personally found their menu very expensive and overpriced for their portions. The meal was very satisfying but because of the price, I've rated Mr. ChiMaek's just shy of 4/5. 

When I compare Mr ChiMaek's prices with some other popular Korean fried chicken restaurants located around the Yonge and Finch area, Mr ChiMaek's marks their menu on average $5 more for the same dishes. For their price, I was expecting the same or bigger portions, however, there seemed to be fewer pieces of chicken. In my opinion, the chicken and flavours that I ordered weren't significantly different from other restaurants. The one thing that sets them apart from other restaurants though, is their unique batter. As much as I enjoyed the batter I can't justify paying more when I can get the same tasty chicken and flavors elsewhere for cheaper. Their bacon kimchi cheese fries sounded amazing but holyyy it's $17! 

We ordered the fish cake soup, boneless carbonara chicken and boneless scallions chicken. I liked that the fish soup was served very hot and came with a variety of fish cakes and a few dolbuki. This soup was a good, simple starter, pricing at $17. Both fried chicken that we ordered were super tasty! I prefer the \"saucier\" choices and both the scallion and carbonara dishes came with a sufficient amount of sauce. The sauce was carefully poured onto the dish first- which was great for dipping near the end, then they arranged the chicken on the plate and drizzled a bit more sauce overtop. The batter was extremely crispy and carried flavour itself. It wasn't overpowering the chicken though. The chicken itself was juicy and tender inside. 

Both the food and service were great. Will I come again? Yes, most likely a few more times down the road but since I'm cheap, I cannot afford to come regularly."}
{"text":"The is the best KFC in the city. You can easily tell that their chicken is made in house and not manufactured and deep fried.The cheesy bacon fries were delicious and a perfect side. The food is on the expensive side. Expect to pay over $20 for your mains but it's worth it. Definitely will go back."}
{"text":"We ordered the Kimchi bacon cheese fries (Now $17) and the boneless garlic & soysauce fried chicken (Now $27). The fries had enough toppings and the kimchi was not at all overpowering. The chicken was lightly breaded, perfectly crispy and perfectly flavoured. We thoroughly enjoyed out dinner! 

We also liked the decor. The anime and superhero posters around the restaurant were unique. The service was great. 

**Note: they did raise the prices after the new year.**  The prices are quite high... especially for a bowl of chicken. 

Still worth a try, especially if you're in the neighbourhood and willing to spend a little more $$$!"}
{"text":"Best Korean fried chicken in town. So crispy on the outside and tender inside. The skin is like the top layer of crème brulee. The fries are amazing too. Not too packed yet so that was good. No wait. The waitress was really nice too. 
And free popcorn! :P"}
{"text":"Service is top notch here. You can tell they are trying to exceed the expectations of their guests.
Large selection of flavours for their fried chicken. We ordered the half and half (chose original fried and regular sauce), and cheesy bacon kimchi french fries.
Original fried chicken was super crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. It did not taste oily at all. The sauced chicken was sweet, savory, and lightly spicy. Personally prefer the original because of the crunch of the skin!
The cheesy bacon kimchi fries were ok. Could have been served hotter. There is ketchup and mayo covering the top which I think is what cooled the the cheese. So you only get stringy pull-y cheese for a short time.
Definitively worth a visit.
Bring some friends as the portions are large.
Not the best place to eat for 1-2 people."}
{"text":"Friends had called for an impromptu dinner and of course our YELP apps started to heat up scouring the community for something new and kid friendly places. Mr Chimaek presented himself. ah-yay-yay as I say when I find it hard to put. the place is definitely cozy in size, you would have to call for reservations. The food for me was average. Having tried a number (though not a serious lot)  of Korean Fried Chicken in the gta, I was somewhat guilty of having placed the benchmark at a high standard - based my palate I would give this place a 3 out of 5. A 3 because although not as great it definitely was not un-edible or not delicious. It just did not hit the spot."}
{"text":"Great service! Great food! Great quality meat!

It is the best Korean fried chicken we have had. Worth getting the very spicy fried chicken but maybe a touch lower in spice level - even though I'm good with almost any level of spice. The staff was attentive and gave our son extra popcorn."}
{"text":"This place opened up nearby and thought i would check it out since i have been meaning to try some Korean Fried Chicken! the prices i must say are kind of expensive but the chicken was nice and juicy! customer service was great and they have a nice super hero theme going on. My favorite has to be the chicken with scallions! Not sure if this is somewhere i would dine often but definitely worth a try"}
{"text":"[DÉCOR] - 5/5
Simple, clean, and has a superhero theme. 

[PRICES] - 3/5
Increased by approximately $4 since 2017. A sign on the front door explains the recent price adjustments are due to the increase of minimum wage in January 2018. 

[FOOD QUALITY] - 5/5
This place has some high-quality chicken! My boyfriend and I ordered a \"Half & Half Fried Chicken in Any Flavour\" - $34.00. For flavours, we chose (1) Rice Powder Fried Chicken and (2) Fried Chicken with Sauce - Mild. 

[ORDER] 
- Rice Powder Fried Chicken's skin was surprisingly NOT greasy! I think the rice powder absorbed the extra grease and left the chicken with a crispy coating that sealed the moisture of the meat. 

- Fried Chicken with Mild Sauce was sweet and tangy, but not that spicy. We expected more of a kick from the spice at a Korean joint. So, for the spice lovers out there, I would recommend either the \"Spicy\" or the \"Very Spicy\" sauces. Again, the dish is made with high-quality chicken meat, but the chicken breast meat was a little dry in comparison with the meat in the Rice Powder Fried Chicken. 

[OVERALL] - 4/5
Experience was above average. Servers were friendly, and I would recommend Mr. ChiMaek to foodies who are on the hunt for Korean Fried Chicken in Markham."}
{"text":"Mr.Chimaek is a Markham gem with good quality korean fried chicken and unique sides in a movie themed rustic environment, albeit can be a pricey option."}
{"text":"If you like fried chicken, you MUST come here. Chicken is crispy on the outside but extremely juicy and tender on the inside.

Staff not the smartest in terms of seating/table management... But small price to pay for GOOD food. 

A little pricey but worth it."}
{"text":"Food ordered: 
-fries
-onion rings
-whole original chicken

Expectation:
- moist, juicy, crispy chicken

Reality:
Dry...so so dry. I dont usually dip anything with my chicken, but for this I had to ask for ketchup and a lot of it!"}
{"text":"To me, Mr ChiMaek rivals Mymy for the seat of my go-to for KFC cravings. Bacon kimchi cheese fries are an easy crowd-pleaser filling the role of nacho fries/poutine (not to say that it is poutine) and goes great with beer. Corn slaw and pickled radish cubes as refillable mini sides are good as any. The chicken itself has great texture; perfectly crispy exterior and still moist interior. If you order the rice powder variant, I recommend eating it first as its flavour may be lost on you if you start off with say the spicy sauce one. My favourite is still the carbonara (which of course is nothing like a carbonara except that it's cheesy and creamy and craveworthy). I'm due for a repeat visit seeing as they've updated the menu and I foresee the addition of another star. Well done, Mr. ChiMaek."}
{"text":"The first thing I noticed was the huge change in decor. I've always remembered this store as Lee's Wok for Hakka food and the poor lighting/interior so this is a welcome sight in the neighbourhood. We ordered the Bacon kimchi cheese fried rice ($18) and the boneless garlic soy fried chicken ($28). You receive a small bowl of popcorn as soon as you sit (though they didn't serve us water right away either). They do NOT accept reservations at this place and have limited seating but for Friday dinner at 7pm, they still had a couple tables open. 

The kimchi cheese fried rice is delicious when hot. The spice is not overbearing and cuts the fattiness from the bacon and cheese. It seems quite simple but they cook and present the dish well. The wings were plentiful and cooked nicely. The outside is a nice crisp golden brown but while other places may overcook and dry out the meat, the chicken is tender, especially for boneless wings. It's a stellar place, I'll be back."}
{"text":"Good:
Fried chicken - Both the whole chicken basket and the boneless basket were really good.  We got the dry hot flavour and it was great even though the only hot about it was the temperature.  For boneless, go for tried and true soy sauce and garlic flavour.  Really amazing and was the standout.  We also tried the creamy wasabi flavour that came as advertised but not really my cup of tea.

Neutral:
Fries - Kimchi cheese fries was not that great.  Cheese cooled pretty rapidly and the Kimchi was maybe too sour for my tastes to go with fries.  Pass on this one.

Beer - Had 2 pitchers of Sapporo because what is chimaek without beer.  Disappointing though because the beer was pretty watered down and the pour had so much head.  Pass on the draught and stick with the bottles and cans next time.

Bad:
Small restaurant and no reservations.  Expect a wait during peak hours.

Worth it?
Yes!  Just under $200 after tax and tip for 5 people.  We had 2 pitchers, whole fried chicken, two orders of boneless chicken, and a side order of fries.  Seems like a fair price.  Despite some drawbacks, the chicken here really does shine and this will be our new chimaek spot going forward."}
{"text":"Unprofessional servers. Told them we needed a table of 9 and they said ok and then ignored us for 20 minutes even tho the restaurant was only half full. Then we had to ask them three times to get an update before they told us they couldn't accommodate us with a table of 9. They're solution  was to put half of us in the back and half us in the front of the restaurant even though they had 3 tables side by side. Not sure why they couldn't provide us with an immediate response. ????????"}
{"text":"Really great chicken and fries. We did the half half original and very spicy and it was a lot of food. We liked the saucy chicken better nut the original was good too. We got the fries with cheese butter and they were amazing! They were different but addictive. The waitress was really nice she took so much care of us. I am not sure if she was the owner but she was great. The decor is modern and fun. Its a comfortable place to go with friends or as a couple."}
{"text":"3.5 Star (3 Star with the Price Increase as of Jan 2018)

Mr. ChiMaek is a welcome addition to the neighbourhood since there are no other authentic Korean Fried Chicken joint around.

I love the interior decor and the seating is spacious compares to other KFC restaurant I been to. 

I wish I can said this is one of the best KFC I had in GTA.

Half and Half ($30) now $34
Maybe I should not have order the Rice Powder Batter? The batter is crispy but just a little too heavy for my taste. The Very Spicy sauce has a nice kick but they did not wow me.

They don't come with deep fried rice cake or the options as an add on. (those rice cake so good with the spicy sauce!)

Bacon Kimichi Fries ($13) now $17
A little on the dry side: McD style fries. Good to order to share while waiting for your chicken to be ready. Nothing amazing

Service was really friendly. My little toddler at the table was given a candy for being good. 

I might be back if I have cravings for KFC and don't feels like going to North York."}
{"text":"The food and service here is pretty good but I personally do not think it's worth the price. They are pretty expensive for what it is. Their soju is always pretty pricey here"}
{"text":"Came here with my boyfriend on a Wednesday evening. We came just before the dinner rush so we got a table right away. 

Looking at the menu, its a little pricier than what I expected. We decided on half and half of very spicy chicken and rice chicken, with a side helping of the carbonara boneless chicken. Portion-wise this place does not cheap out. The half and half would be a perfect size to feed 2, if not 3. I would definitely recommend the carbonara! The sauce and the chicken combo was heavenly. For the spicy lovers, the very spicy chicken had quite the kick. First bite was sweet, but after a few seconds the spices kicks in...for me who loves spicy, i had to take a break. Thankfully, the server was so attentive and made sure we had everything we needed, hot tea and cold water when we couldn't handle the spicy chicken we ordered! Oops.  

Overall its a pretty good place for korean fried chicken, especially since this is the only decent one in markham serving soju ($20ish per bottle though, quite expensive)."}
{"text":"I visited Mr Chimaek on a Friday evening before the dinner rush with a few friends. We were greeted by friendly staff and were seated quickly. First impressions of the restaurant was that it was cosy,  clean and had great decor with a mix of modern rustic elements. 

After being seated we were presented with a side of popcorn. The popcorn was fresh and buttery. It was highly addicting and refills were included. The menu was quite simple but had very interested twists on the traditional Korean classics of fried chicken. I did notice however that prices tended to be on the higher side of what you would be used to seeing for fried chicken elsewhere in Toronto which was a bit of a drawback for me. The taste and quality of the food however made up for the higher prices and was justifiable. Once we ordered were were also given the side dishes of radish and sweet corn. The sweet corn paired really well with the fried chicken and added a nice pop of flavor to the meal.

We ordered the Kimchi Bacon cheese fries ($17). It came well presented with a cross hatched pattern of mayonnaise, spicy sauce and cheese. The fries were also lightly seasoned and nice and crispy but not hard. It also had nice sized chunks of bacon and kimchi throughout. I would highly recommend this dish it was amazing! The next dish we ordered was the chicken garayaki with curry sauce. This dish had great presentation and even better taste. The curry sauce was smooth and creamy and the chicken was moist and easy to bite into. The final dish of the meal was the boneless cheese butter chicken. The chicken again was soft and juicy. The flavor of the seasoning reminded me of eating honey butter chips. It was a taste that was just ok to me and seemed a little powdery. 

Overall I would come back to try more of their dishes in the future as service was great and food quality was excellent. Only downfall would be the price of their dishes."}
{"text":"Very busy, small, Korean spot. 

Mozzarella Ddeokkbokki was perfectly cooked (I've had under cooked and it's not fun to eat). Super cheesy, perfect amount of heat. The only downside is that I could taste the gas torch they used to melt the top of the cheese. Unfortunately that made the best part about the dish unenjoyable for me. 

Garlic Soy Fried Chicken (boneless) was GREAT! Crispy, sweet, juicy. Sooo good. It is really as good as it looks in all of the photos. Why didn't I order more? 

The restaurant is small and kind of tight at peak times. A seat closer to the back would be ideal for comfort. 

Prices were kind of surprising and not really justified in the quantity of food.

I will be back for sure knowing what to expect. I'll be asking that they don't use the torch to melt the cheese, hopefully the sauce will be hot enough to do the job."}
{"text":"Mr. ChiMaek is a hidden gem! Although located in a slightly questionable looking plaza, it's definitely a must try. If you're already a fan of Korean food, particularly Korean Fried Chicken, this is the spot to be. They've got sizeable portions and a variety of flavours to choose from. The Half & Half is a great choice if you can't decide between marinated or classic fried chicken. Chicken comes with complementary popcorn, corn salad, and delicious pickled radish. The interior is cute, quirky, and fun. They've got excellent service and for those who like K-pop, they play the tracks!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I wanted to try this new place as we tried many korean fried chicken places. We ordered the Bacon kimchi fries, half and half chicken (spicy)(original). Overall the service was great and friendly, the chicken was not greasy, but the prices were a-little to high. Would come again."}
{"text":"Pretty good food and service, good place to chill even on a week night with friends. I like the interior of this place, it is interesting.
It is hard to find as you do not expect there is a Korean fried chicken and alcohol restaurant in this plaza with pizza pizza.
Now I don't have to drive to North York for some Korean food."}
{"text":"I got lost getting into this plaza! Thought you could turn in from the main road but you have to enter thru a smaller road to get in. It's pretty secluded and seems in the middle of no where but it's across from the Library. 

I came by on a Sat afternoon around 1230p and it wasn't busy. It's one of the few KFC places that's opened for lunch. Most of the place I've seen opens at like 5p. Interior was super cool and casual, seems like they're a Marvel fan. Lots of cool posters up. General pricing for dishes here are slightly more expensive then other places in Ktown/Sauga but it was good! Def would come back again only when I'm in Markham.

Service was great, our waitress was attentive and answered all our questions and gave her recommendations. Cold water/tea/popcorn/coleslaw/turnips were all included at no costs and you can ask for refills. 

What we ordered:
Kimchi bacon fries - really good, not spicy and the fries were thin cut and it seems like they're cajun fries. Only downside was that there wasn't enough kimchi in it.

Boneless green onion fc - chicken was good, crispy and tender but the wasabi dressing was too strong for me (Taste and smell wise). First place I've tried to find it really strong. This is a no for me (because I don't like wasabi).

Half/half original and regular sauce - original plain fc is like popeyes chicken but much better. Regular sauce is supposed to be a light sweet and spicy sauce but it was more sweet. Wasn't drenched in sauce so it wasn't that messy. Really good."}
{"text":"The profit motive: money is key. Chicken priced 3x higher than necessary.

The restaurant pursues a different, unique, and curious aesthetic compared to the bulk of hot and new up-starts. I love the rustic wooden tables and ghilbi themed decor! You're given small, cute tongs to eat with and they're adorable! However, I don't quite enjoy their clipboard menu, I find it inconvenient given how stiff the clipboard and cardstock are. Also, the menu is provided on off-white, dull coloured cardstock, unmatched for the dim lighting.

I've come here several times with friends. Each time I come here, we order the chicken, of course, it's what they advertise as their main.
So far, I've tried the original fried chicken, rice power chicken, and chicken with mild and spicy sauce.
...The basket comes as 2/3 chicken and 1/3 bones...! Also, my friends do find their breading to be quite thick.
The pieces of chicken that you DO get are tender and juicy. The chicken with sauce has a tasty sauce.

Their bacon kimchi cheese french fries arent special, definitely not worth $17.
Their donkatsu udon is delicious, served in a cute mini couldron. Delicious but overpriced.

Service is attentive and friendly, but I have had better chicken for less of my limited income :("}
{"text":"Slightly over priced but the food was great. I highly recommend the kimchi fries for sure! My fiancé loved the food as well, so we're going there again sometime soon."}
{"text":"The review is purely for the chicken - I have a feeling I would bump down the rating if I tried their other food items because of how expensive it is (like why is the army soup $$$?)

My boyfriend and I ordered the half & half ($34) which is great for people who want to share a dry and saucy rub. We got the rice powder fried chicken per one of the waitress' suggestion cause she said it's just a crispier version of original fried chicken. And for the other half, we got the spicy sauce fried chicken.

The price is a tad bit steeper than other KFC joints but the portion size is quite large! Half a chicken is more than enough for one person. I definitely recommend their saucy wings over the dry ones because it packs way more flavour. The rice powder one was kinda bland - I know why they had salt and pepper shakers on the side now.

Overall, the food was pretty tasty but nothing special. I bumped the rating to 4 stars cause of the service. The servers were great, really attentive and it was easy to get refills for the sides (radish, corn) and complimentary popcorn."}
{"text":"First visit and nothing especially. However, over priced on all. Chicken wings are $35+ for a basket. Also had the ramen hot pot with the canned meats. Another $30. Service is very good ambiance is nice as well, but got to redo the prices. Otherwise, I don't see this business sustainable. 

Honestly most likely last time going there."}
{"text":"First time actually going for Korean fried chicken and only fried chicken.... And it wasn't bad at all...at least the food. Went there for Saturday lunch and right about when they were open, which I wouldn't recommend because it doesn't seem like they are ready to serve yet. They still need to boil the water for tea and still had to cook the rice. They had one waitress which was trying to serve but also prep everything, and when business starts picking up later it was still the same waitress.  

Setting wise it was different because it had a lot of cartoon and animation pictures up and if you were a fan of them it was great...all the way onto the washroom. 

Food wise, ordered the half and half chicken which is one chicken slip to two flavour. In my case the rice powder and mild. Taste wise it was good and personally I prefer the mild since it had a little more sauce making it a little less dry. Chicken, wise it looks like they order the whole chicken and chop it themselves because the cutting on the chicken were a little unusual. 

Taste: good. Price: with the new minimum wages some prices has gone up. Is half and half chicken worth the $34, not really considering how much a whole chicken cost...

Would I come back? If I am craving for fried chicken only maybe."}
{"text":"I'm so happy Markham finally has a korean fried chicken joint, one that is actually good. I arrived way before dinner and much later after lunch so I was the only one here. From time to time they'd have take out orders so they're still keeping busy. From what I've been told, they're quite busy during dinner so I would recommend coming earlier if you want a seat. Their area looks spacious enough but it still seems like they can only hold a maximum group of 6. The restaurant plays the newest kpop hits and has a cozy atmosphere. 

Waitress was so nice, she checked up on me every once in a while, never rushing me and always made me feel comfortable. She was so attentive to everything! Food was great too. 

- Hot Sweet potato cheese fries: these were so delicious, the fries were thinly cut. The texture on the outside was crispy and the inside was nice and soft. Perfect blend for me. Only downside is how pricey it is, for what it was I don't think it deserved a price tag of $17. 
- Spicy sauce fried chicken: I got the regular spicy due to my sensitive stomach but normally I would've gotten very spicy. The sauce itself was more sweet than spicy, I'll have to try the spicy one at a later date when I'm not feeling out of it. The servings were HUGE though, I was not expecting this much. In comparison to MyMy, I feel like this place offered much more. 

Overall I would definitely come back, possibly to try out their other dishes. They have a variety of katsu!"}
{"text":"This place is right across McDonalds and inside a small plaza with Pizza Pizza. It was sort of hard to find since there was no lighting on the sign when we came here for dinner. We ordered the half and half chicken with bacon kimchi cheese fries. I was bummed how we couldn't get the soy garlic flavour with the half and half. The spicy flavour was good though, and the original was not as bland as I thought it would be. We couldn't even finish half the chicken so if it's just two people it would be better to just get the half order. I would not recommend the fries because they didn't melt the cheese properly and it wasn't worth it's price. There were only two servers and three kitchen staff when I went there on a Saturday night so we had to wait over 30 mins for our food. Overall a bit pricey and staff needs to be more attentive with customers."}
{"text":"More of a 3.8 just short of a 4 for me. Chicken does live up to the rave... perfectly crispy outside & juicy inside. We ordered just the classic and my tummy was definitely satisfied. We also ordered kimchi fries and a side of rice. I have had better kimchi fries in my many food trips... this one was just loaded with a little too much seasoning. I couldn't even really taste the kimchi lol... but in general tasty but maybe not go too gungho on all that sauce and seasoning as it was bordering salty. So for a half order of chicken was 20.00 (whole order is 33.00), kimchi fries was 17.00 & small bowl of rice was 1.50(?)... which is a tad much for fried chicken for the average person IMO... but our meal did come w/complimentary starters such as dill radish kimchi radish and a really yummy corn salad. Those were  pleasent touches as I would suspect for an above average priced joint. Ambiance was def on point with trendy decor and service was super great that's why I am closer to 4 stars than 3 as overall experience was great &would probably come back if craving not too greasy perfectly golden fried chicken wings in Markham!!!"}
