{"text":"Super cute coffee + kids corner in old town Scottsdale. Took my toddler in for the first time today and he loved it. Cool place to meet people and socialize while kids play. My only recommendation is I wish they had music playing or something it was a little too quiet, I think that would really enhance the ambiance of the place and I wish they had a pass you can purchase to come in an x amount of times monthly, each visit is 9$. They also own a kids boutique next door a little pricey but everything is so cute and organic. I will bring my son back."}
{"text":"A great place to escape with the babe! Super friendly staff and the place is always clean. Love the fact that you can host events here too."}
{"text":"Fun indoor play space for the Little's and cafe with coffee and snacks! Or nice space to rent out for a party :)"}
{"text":"I don't know why they place isn't packed.  The best place to let the littles play while you get work done on your computer or chat with a friend.  I life that they don't always play kids music but nice background music that is soft.  Keeps the kids mellow"}
