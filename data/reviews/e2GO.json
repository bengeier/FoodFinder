{"text":"What if I told you I would overcharge you for food that is mediocre on it's absolute best day and AND never get the order right. Would you keep going back? Well I had just had my last visit there."}
{"text":"I stop in here all the time if I need a quick lunch! I have celiacs disease and its really hard to find a place downtown to grab a healthy lunch sans gluten! The E2GO staff takes food allergies very seriously and will kindly change their gloves, and today they even made my salad on a towel on the line so it didn't slide across all the bread crumbs and gluten! Everyone has always been very friendly and efficient.  I would have given it 5 stars excepting I think their prices are a little high. $14 for a salad with chicken is kind of crazy. But the knowledge of the staff and the quality of the food will keep me coming back.   Thanks E2g0."}
{"text":"I am pretty sure that my credit card company is going to start calling to check and see if I'm alive and well if I don't go to e2GO this week. Why? Because I go every week. I'm aiming for \"regular\" status, and I think I'm not far away.   Staff is friendly and moves fast enough to get me in and out in less than 10 minutes. Food is yummylicious, though I'd choose the BLTA and soup over the pulled pork sandwich most days. Jerk chicken wrap could be bigger (so tiny for so much money!), and the pulled pork is great but yearns for another flavor to cut the sweet smokiness of the pork. Sweet tea isn't too sweet. My meal usually runs about $8-$9, a little more if I want chips and a drink.   No real indoor seating, but if the day is nice you can sit under the glass overhang outside at the tables by the Mint.   Overall, a good stop in a low-traffic part of town for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"Baked goods at e2GO are amazing.  If you order a scone or muffin, it was just baked that morning.  Nothing is ever saved for the next day.  I took a bite of the scone, it was lighter in texture with the perfect fruit ratio!  You can tell when people love their jobs it shines through.  I won't be buying pastries anywhere else in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Awful. Its a miracle when they get the sandwich right. I am allergic to eggs, and have always ordered a sandwich there with no egg- sub avocado. Today I realized they put avocado, egg and turkey bacon on my sandwich, so I brought it back. The \"chef\" ARGUED with me about what he saw on the ticket!! Im sorry what ever happened to the customer is always right? Not only are they arguing with me about what they see on the ticket- they also make fun of the fact my breakfast sandwich I order has no egg- sub avocado- and THEN they STILL get it wrong.    No wonder this place is closing. Wont miss it.   Hope Emeril's other restaurants are more successful, have friendlier staff, and more consistency.  BAMMM"}
{"text":"You'd think getting a free sandwich would make up for some deficiencies, but no. This BLTA (avocado) was described as featuring thick, house-cured bacon. However, the bacon appeared to be the regular thin kind you see in fast food joints - but with the added bonus of being burnt to char. I would have taken it back, but this sandwich was free because the last time I got a sandwich at e2go, it was absolutely swimming in oil after the cashier assured me they put \"just a little\" olive oil on there. Yuck, now double-yuck. Yumm-NO."}
{"text":"Have been looking forward to trying E2Go since going to lunch at the sit down restaurant next door. E2 was very good but over priced. Thought E2Go would satiate my want of good food but not break the bank - it's a sandwich shop after all! The Emeril name can't mark up just a sandwich that much, can it?   So I was disappointed in the value at E2Go - tasty Vietnamese po'boy but the sandwich was ::tiny:: and cost ~$9.   Too many good options for lunch to make E2Go anything to go back for.   They do have Abita Root Beer on tap, which is delicious. But I'm still hungry. Boo."}
{"text":"I stop in every morning when visiting Charlotte for work.  Staff is friendly and very fast / efficient.  Food is tasty and of good quality, and a nice latte gets me ready for the day's work ahead.  Can't wait to stop in when I am back in town."}
{"text":"Pricey and the food was just OK. Had the shrimp and grits cause hey...it's emeril's joint. Also had the peanut butter pie. I love peanut butter pie and on a scale of 1-10 i would give their's a 6.5. The shrimp and grits a 6."}
{"text":"The only thing good about this place is the friendliness of the staff (besides the fact that they eat behind the counter)!  It seems like someone isn't ordering what is necessary for this restaurant to run efficiently as they are constantly out of something on the menu (especially for breakfast, which is already limited to about four items).  There is a new line chef who seems to be trying to make up for the deficiencies, however, today I witnessed the cooks smelling some type of meat from one of the lower line refrigerators - GROSS!  Does that mean it sat there all weekend?  Even more GROSS!, if this is a reflection of Emeril's E2 main restaurant, I want no parts of it. Saving money by possibly making people sick shouldn't be one of the ingredients on the menu guys!  Oh, and be careful with the coffee.  It is so hot, you will blister your skin!  Only rating one star bc the site is making me, but you won't see me back here.  Don't say you weren't warned!"}
