{"text":"I am a greasy spoon officianado and this is in a class of its own. You hv to experience it to understand it, but you will never forget it. Don't forget to do some shopping in the attached empty shelves aisles of a convenience store. Anyway, I love this place."}
{"text":"UFO used to be excellent. Now it is so-so.  You'd roll onto the counter seat and Zambia or \"mama\" would know your fave. It was always fresh and delicious. New owners though and she doesn't work as often. It's not got the freshness of old, but for a plate of fries and souvlaki with a cripsy iceburg salad and rice it's great. Good Tatziki. Good toasted western and ample helpings of breakfasts at a very good price.  My last creme cheese bagel was slathered in cheese, but the bagel was burned a bit.  The prices are great. It's a nice counter to have in the hood. I wouldn't go outta' my way anymore to eat there, but it's good simple food, if the tomatoes aren't the plumpest."}
{"text":"tip for everyone if you don't want to see windex or dog food.. just don't go to the back tables.   Other than that.. summer time hang outside on the \"patio\" just a simple go to for breakfast. The Barn at 598 Queen St West another greasy spoon but no dog food or windex."}
{"text":"Hands down, my favourite breakfast joint in Toronto. Not since Thornhills' Midway (sold and turned into a Korean Pub), has there been a greasy spoon that's gotten things this right. I've always been in search of my downtown greasy spoon and found it about a year ago. Whether you eat on the patio sitting in their plastic furniture, by the bar classic diner style or at a table beside the cleaning supplies...you will not be let down. Good eggs, delicious bacon and low prices. Not to mention, the owner is a gentleman and provides incredible service. My go to: 3 eggs over easy, home fries, bacon, brown toast and a side of sausage."}
{"text":"if you like shoe leather order steak on a bun. I remember when the cook was an older lady and she made good fish and chips but with the new cook things have went downhill. Order the eggs the way u want them and get them the way they give them to u. However there beef on a bun is pretty good."}
{"text":"This place always relaxes me.  Greasy spoon, moderately priced and even a little patio for the summer. Love the little stools inside and the clientele are always quiet and friendly.  Doesn't hurt that it's up the street from me, but I'm definitely glad it is and I'll definitely be back again for breakfast."}
{"text":"Classic local diner. Great for breakfast, excellent burgers, friendly staff."}
{"text":"This is an interesting find.  Without a doubt, your first thought upon entering this place is \"What on earth?!\", but this is certainly a neighborhood gem.  It's a convenience store, where you buy your lotto tickets, icecream pops, and dishsoap, AND sit down at a table and have a plated burger, or pork souvlaki lunch.  The big table at the back is the most interesting to sit at.  Your view there includes a look down each isle where the shelves contain the cleaning supplies and stacked pet food, the open kitchen, and both drink refrigerators.  The whole place is humble, interesting, and unassuming.    Very pleasant and friendly staff, and quite good food.  This is diner stuff, nothing fancy.  The basics to get you fed, and on with your day.  I'd certainly come here again.  CASH ONLY.  However they do have a independent cash machine right next to the cashier."}
{"text":"Best burger in Toronto. Forget the Priest or Holy Chuck, overpriced and overdressed.  Get the \"daily special\" (it's always the special), banquet burger and fries. Simply well made, every topping seems fresh and generous, sesame seed bun, huge patty, lots of bacon. More fries than you can finish. Open kitchen which is neat, the owners are really nice. Also the restaurant (about four tables and the counter) is inside a convenience store so you can pick up some kitty litter while you're there. NICE!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars.  Ever want to enjoy your breakfast special adjacent to the Windex aisle? Now's your chance!  This is an odd place for a diner, though the concept of a lunch counter inside a \"5 and Dime\" (like Kresge's or Woolworths) is quite traditional. This is a bit different, however, as UFO is mostly a large convenience-style store, well off the beaten track on Niagara St.  Face one way, and you get that lunch counter vibe...turn a few degrees and check out the vacuum cleaner bags.  That being said, the food was pretty good. Large eggs and tasty home fries complimented the above-average coffee, and my bacon-loving friends loved the bacon! The server was friendly and attentive.  Check out this unique, casual place. It's worth a trip."}
{"text":"UFO burger is like one of those guys who busks with a big drum on his back, a banjo and a trumpet all at the same time.  I was taken here by a work collogue who said they do amazing burgers and woah he was not kidding. Before I get to the burger I will set the scene.  This place is a convenience store and a cafe type dealio all in the one. Has a few patio chairs and tables outside along with seating at the actual counter. The place you can tell is a bit worn out but I guess it is just part of the experience. Especially if you know that you will get an ace burger at the end of it.  The menu is good, a few types of burger and side options, the old lady at the grill makes \"home-made' style which is the only way.  The burger itself is pretty massive with a decent portion of fries on the side, I was not unable to finish it or keep it in one piece but it tasted great.   Plus I like the advantage of seeing my food prepared and cooked in front of me, that way I know nothing fell on the floor :D  I will soon be living not too far from here so  it will for certain become my place to go for a quick burger bite for cheap.  Cheap = more good times on the night"}
{"text":"The cook Dont know how to cook eggs she has never got them right..last time she started them then answered her phone amd talked for at least 8 minutes..the owner took over..eggs were way over done..tried the steak on bun once..could not chew it..if you complain he looks at you like oh well...home burger is good as is his coffee..could use a good cleaning/reno"}
{"text":"good diner fair..typical not overly creative..pop prices are ridiculous..food prices are quite reasonable...all day breKie available"}
{"text":"Awesome place.  Greased diner attached to a store.  At the burger and fries and made me feel like a whore!  Spectacular fries and the burger was amazing.    Don't let the outside appearance or the yellowed ceiling tile make you fell off about this place.  Enjoy this place.  All the options looks amazing.    Quickly come by before the liberals up more taxes increasing the costs here."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast so shopping would be bearable - I hate lines. Anyways, this place is a local greasy spoon, and its okay. Nothing special, but it's a decent place to fuel up or beat down that hangover. The usual suspects prepared in decent time, the nice part is you don't get scalped at the cash register. Don't look for d√©cor, ambience or anything fancy, this really is a hole in the wall, but at least you can resurrect yourself without having to suffer noisy kids or preppy customers. Place is okay, but there are better places not far away, so I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"Mmm my fav greasy breakfast place for a great price."}
{"text":"With so many places that you have to stand in line to get brunch it is a good go to on a Saturday or Sunday morning. Classic breakfast fare, no frills but always really good.  No mimosa options available so you walk out with a $15.00 bill for 2 rather than a $70 bill."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this hidden gem. The homemade burger with fries is an absolute must - and it's only $6 for a mammoth burger!!! Their breakfast is good too and Coffee is only $1.50. Great little underrated local joint. Not heaps on offer in regards to convenience items but for food and sweets it's great. They have milkshakes too."}
{"text":"Yes, yes, yes, yes yes... All Yes.   Such great food, a basic place, no fur-fru types. Straight forward, Classic Shop Diner.   Breakfast, Lunch, and Convenience all in one! Great Prices, Delicious Food... Lee is the Man!   Love this place. I have heard and seen the burger but not had it, I hear and see amazing things!   NOT recommended for groups, kids, fru-fru types, foodies, snude-ies or first time Toronto visitors.   5 STAR for me."}
{"text":"I'm not sure about the other menu items, but the burgers here are some of the best I've ever had. Less than $10 for a huge bacon cheeseburger with everything on it and a generous amount of fries. Everything tastes amazing and is incredibly filling. It's in part of a convenience store, so the ambience is very low-key, but that has charm in itself. Overall, I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants an amazing burger for a great price."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! It's our local diner basically.  No frills, half diner and half convenience store. The people running it are always friendly. Breakfast sandwiches are so good and everything is made when you order it. We usually go in and have pancakes, a breakfast sandwich and 2 coffees and it all comes to about 10 dollars. I hope this place stays around forever!"}
{"text":"Not fond of store but fantastic burger.  Will have you full guaranteed. Then possibly comatose by 2 pm if you had it for lunch."}
{"text":"Good place for those looking for an affordable, classic greasy spoon place to eat at for breakfast. Two can dine and get a full meal with coffee for less than 20 tip included. This place only takes cash though so keep that in mind before coming. The decor is very barebones and the restaurant is placed within a convenience store. Meals including coffee start at 6.75 (eggs, toast, bacon, homefries) - can't go wrong with that. While seating is limited, service is quite fast which is an added bonus. Overall my wife and I were satisfied with our meal and would come back. For the price, you will be hard pressed to find better value on king west."}
{"text":"I worked on Richmond St a while back and this was out choice for lunch. Homey greasy spoon cooking, place would creep out most pretentious foodies, but it's right up my alley. Roast beef, breakfast and chiken soup were my favourites. Now I go downtown once a month for work, but I remain true to UFO and come visit every time I go down there."}
{"text":"UFO - It's half way between a convenience store and an old school diner, run by hard working couple. Beyond lotto tickets and the occasional pop and chip run, not sure what else they sell though. I seen stuff on the shelf from the 90's - no joke.   That said, they mostly sling out cheap diner grub like chicken souvlaki and homemade burgers. It's a hell of a deal too, and surprisingly good! Want a dirty, nap inducing, new lunch spot to brag about with your startup buddies? Take them here."}
{"text":"I must have walked past this place 50 times and thought nothing of it. Then a friend told me they served breakfast and my life changed.  Half a convenience store, and half a greasy spoon, UFO was like a little hidden neighbourhood gem that changed the weekend breakfast game for me.   Let's get one thing clear - you come here for the basics. It's not gourmet. There is a whiteboard menu that doesn't contain phrases like \"grain fed\" or \"gluten free\". The breakfast combo is bacon, eggs, or ham, with 2 eggs, home fries, toast, and a coffee or tea. It's simple, it's cheap, and it's exactly what your hangover called for.   In the summer, order inside and grab a seat on the patio. Otherwise, sit inside, listen to the ambient noise of the old tube tv, and wait for the greasy saltiness to arrive.  Oh, and it's cash only."}
