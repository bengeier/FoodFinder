{"text":"4.5 stars! The BF and I came here around 1:15pm on a Wednesday for lunch after reading some good reviews. 

I had the Bacon and Cheese Ramen ($9.95). The Ramen had bacon, cheese, BBQ pork, corn, green onion, and egg. Cheese is my favourite topping on ramen, so I knew I had to try it the moment I saw it on the menu. The broth is the tonkotsu soup base. It had good flavour, was not overly salty and I wasn't thirsty even after drinking a lot of the broth so that was good. The soft-boiled egg was perfect. So good! BBQ pork was not cut too thick nor was it overly fatty or dry. The only negative thing is that the noodles were the standard kind you can buy from most stores. Not the best, but It was cooked well so I did not mind too much. To me, a good broth is more important.  

The BF got the Pork Cutlet Curry Ramen ($9.95) The Ramen had a large piece of seaweed, black fungus, green onion, corn, a fishcake, and egg. A full serving of pork cutlet came on the side. This is a pretty good deal since the pork cutlet itself would have been $5.95 had you ordered it as a side. The meat was a good thickness, and wasn't dry. I usually don't like any kind of cutlet since a lot of places like to cut the meat too thin so that it gets all dried up during the frying process. But I liked the cutlet they had here! I don't really like curry soup base, but the BF thought it was good so I'll take his word for it.
 
We also got the Ika Yaki ($7.95). Yummy! Portion size was pretty good, I was actually expecting something smaller and was surprised at the portion size when it came. It was cooked perfectly, still very soft and the good kind of chewy. Maybe just a few pieces at the top of the head was slightly more charred than the rest. 

I was so stuffed I could barely finish all the food! Honestly, if we shared the pork cutlet between us and each had our ramen, and that would have been enough for lunch. But I'm glad we ordered the Ika yaki to try. The tableware here were all very cute. I loved the cute rabbit cups. Our waitress (and I think one of the owners) was super attentive. Came to check how our food was several times and our teas were never more than half empty. I never felt hurried to leave either. The place wasn't very big, around 8-9 tables maybe. We sat in the booth at the front right by the windows and I found the booth a little tight compared to the booths you would find in a western-style restaurant. 

I really like this place and I'll definitely be back to try some of the other ramens and sides. Prices are pretty good for the portion size you get. As a note, the BF and I went to the new Sansotei Ramen in Markham about a week later. And we both preferred Koi Sakana over this Sansotei Ramen in the Markham/Richmond Hill area. We just liked the atmosphere, soup broth, and sides here a bit more."}
{"text":"My wife got the Hokkaido Ramen and the broth was good. We like a rich broth. I found the house tonkatsu to be lacking in flavour. I think a ramen place should have great noodles and the ones here seemed very generic. Price was cheaper than other better ramen places so from that perspective I guess you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Good price but ramen is so bland. Servers are nice. Restaurant still seems very popular."}
{"text":"Had the bacon and cheese Ramen noodles...was hesitant at first but it's done with the pork bone soup base which went perfect.  I added their spicy seasoning to it and it was amazing.  Waistress was friendly, quick and courteous.   I was there by myself and there was a line that was starting to form with people waiting for a table.   She did not rush me and told me to take my time when paying for bill.    Refilled water before I had the chance to ask.  Very attentive   would definetly come back for the same bacon and cheese :)"}
{"text":"Ramen so so but the soup base excellence. Especially appreciate the service of the waitress, she is so attentative."}
{"text":"Good, home made ramen. Nice flavour, good portions. Small and quitet place. Had toufu chessecake for dessert."}
{"text":"Fave place to eat ramen with the husband. Waitress is so nice and we are always full by the end of the bowl. We really like their broth and we also like their vegetarian broth. Their squid balls are delicious too."}
{"text":"Food: I am no ramen expert, that being said everything tasted fantastic to me. Came out within 10 minutes for 2 bowls of ramen. 

Service: Excellent, were greeted as soon as we walked in and directed to a table. Server was attentive and polite throughout the meal. One recommendation though, I was not able to tell it was debit/cash only (did not see any signs). I had alternate forms of payment but I can see this being inconvenient for others. 

Decor: It's a small restaurant, seating was comfortable and did not feel crowded."}
{"text":"The place is quite small (seating for 30 people maybe?). We arrived at 20:00 on a Friday night and had to wait ~20min to get seated for two and another ~10min for the food to arrive after ordering. With that said, it was worth the wait as their food was good, service was friendly and server was attentive (topped up our tea 4x over the course of our meal). 

We both had the vegetable tonkotsu ramen and an order of the ika yaki (grilled squid). The ramen was good, the soup base was flavourful without being too salty, and the squid was not overcooked or rubbery *thumbs up* 

The price point is good as well. Total was ~$32 incl. tax and tip."}
{"text":"Amazing homemade soup. Super kid friendly owners wife is really welcoming. Oh and did I mention the food is yummy"}
{"text":"The soup is very good. It has less oil compare to the places in downtown.
I saw some Japanese drinking last time. I will come back."}
{"text":"Met up with my friend for a quick bite before another's Bachelor party. You know how that Charlie XCX song goes \"Boom! Clap! The sound of my heart...\"? That was this restaurant's front door every time someone opened the outer door. There was a strong enough vacuum the inner door would always bang, despite being closed. In the background is a pleasant mix of JPOP/JROCK/CPOP and other softer songs.

Restaurant size:
This is a small place! We arrived there at 5:30pm on a Friday night and it was already getting busy. By the time we finished at around 6:30, there was starting to be a crowd of patient-not-really customers.

Portion size:
We wanted to eat EVERYTHING. I mean, everything looked so good in those menus...
I decided to try the standard House Tonkotsu with an Asahi Black, and it was sufficient. However, compared with Kinton, it seems like the noodle portion was a bit small, though delicious still.

Food quality:
Did not have any doubts about the quality, and was fine throughout the rest of the night! Pork belly was delish.

Service:
Only one server, but she did a stellar job handling the entire busy restaurant!

Final thoughts:
As Kinton Bowlers, we felt there could have been a bit more to the ramens, in addition to the amount of noodles. But aside from comparisons to a different restaurant \"a city away\", it was a pleasant bowl of ramen. We might come back for different ramens another time!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly good. Low expectations for this Chinese run restaurant. 

There are only a few ramen options on the menu. However the noodles have a nice springy bite to it, the soup bases are decent and it's not too expensive.

I don't know of any other comparable ramen restaurants in the area, perhaps Kenzo and Sonoya at First Markham Place. A good option for those craving ramen but not willing to make the drive all the way downtown."}
{"text":"After seeing good reviews on Yelp for this restaurant, I was still skeptical about the quality of ramen from a non-Japanese operated ramen house.  I did my first visit to Koi Sakana on a Saturday shortly after it opens. Most tables were available and we get seated immediately.  Koi Sakana is a small restaurant with less than 10 tables, so the rest of the seating were quickly filled up within the next half hour.  

Services were friendly and fast, our ramen were ready within 10 minutes. We ordered the house ramen and the Spicy Tonkotsu Ramen Level 1.  Spicy level 1 is not spicy for me at all but it gives a slight kick and great aroma to the soup base.  I find this spiciness is just right if you like to drink the soup as well. 

I am no expert on ramen, but I did have excellent ramen in Japan and visited different Japanese operated ramen houses in New York and Toronto.  Aside from the one I had in Japan, the ramen from Koi Sakana is probably among the best for my liking.  The noodle texture is thin and springy to the teeth and the broth is full of flavour without being overly salty.  I was so surprised with the quality of the ramen from a non-Japanese operated ramen house.  I know I will return to Koi Sakana very shortly."}
{"text":"This place is located in a small food plaza. It is nice, tidy and clean inside with a friendly atmosphere. The ramen comes in a small portion that probably only for one serving. Their half boiled eggs is really good but the ramens aren't as good as I expected. The ramens are nothing compared to those in downtown. This ramen is like instant ramen in a package but a little better. Overall this place is not that bad if ur too lazy to go to downtown."}
{"text":"Unfortunately when we went the service was really slow. The place wasn't too big, so there weren't many seats. 

I ordered the house tonkotsu ramen, it was what you expect of typical ramen I guess. Too bad the place smelled a bit like curry where we sat. Server was nice enough though. 

Taste was good for its price, but overall not my favourite ramen place."}
{"text":"Great go-to place if you are a vegetarian and craving some ramen! They have a vegetarian ramen that uses a vegetable soup base, tastes delicious, and cheap ($7)! They serve the dish with an egg, but can certainly ask them to remove it. However, the broth is white in colour (mimicking tonkotsu?), so there's likely to be milk/cream in it (sorry vegans). 

The flavour is medium bodied. Light, at the same time, contains flavour that has impact! Noodles have always been cooked just right every time I had the dish.

I believe it's run by a husband and wife (no, not Japanese). Husband's in the kitchen and wife is at the front house. She's attentive in refilling drinks and friendly!

Note that it is cash only!

Hope you vegetarians try it out!"}
{"text":"Cold nights = Soup noodles! Decided to check out this place for some Ramen tonight. 

The restaurant is quite small, and hidden. Max seating I would say is about 30? My boyfriend and I decided to try the Hokkaido Ramen ($9.95) 

The Ramen was delicious! Broth was very flavourful and milky, I actually ended up drinking most of it. The eggs were cooked to perfection. The pork was also quite tender. The noodles itself were pretty good, I was hoping for it to be a little more chewy. 

Service was impeccable. I've never had an Asian restaurant come up midway through my meal to ask how everything was. Definitely 2 thumbs up. They also kept offering to refill our tea.

I think this will be my new Ramen joint :)"}
{"text":"One of my favourite Ramen spots!

Great service, very attentive and kind.  Super kid-friendly, they're always happy to provide kiddie bowls and cutlery along with some entertainment (little etch and sketch board to keep the child busy).  The soups are extremely flavourful, well made and seasoned.  The portions are generous without being enormous.  The pork is super tender and tasty."}
{"text":"Very small cozy restaurant.  Luckily we got the last available table so no need to wait. We tried the house and spicy ramen and the grilled octopus.  Broth was very good with deep flavors. I really enjoyed how they pan fried the pork before adding to ramen. Adds another depth of flavor. I ordered the spicy ramen in 2 spiciness and it was too spicy for me. Tentacles was a little charred but otherwise quite standard. There is only 1 server but service was prompt and curteous. Would definitely come back when craving a bowl of ramen."}
{"text":"not a bad place overall
service was pretty good
flavour and value was good as well
worth a try!"}
{"text":"Had the unagi, squid balls and ika yaki ( grilled squid) appetizer. Unagi was amazing: tender, crispy at the edges and lots of flavour, squid balls a bit bland but it was nicely fried and piping hot, ika yaki was good too.
Ordered the spicy broth number 1 with the seafood ramen. Broth had nice clean flavour with a hint of garlic but should've had spicy number 3, and ramen was nice and chewy, the seafood was standard: shrimp, mussel, squid, scallops and imitation crab.
Also had the tofu cheesecake, never knew tofu could taste that good :)
Waitress was amazing! Attentive and very proud of the food. Place is small and clean and fills up fast."}
{"text":"The ramen was very delicious. A good place to go, but we went there on a busy day, we waited a long time."}
{"text":"Great ramen place. Their service was what stood out the most for my visit.

Note: I remember ramen being great but ii don't remember the exact taste. I will revisit and rewrite the review."}
{"text":"It was quiet and cold on a Sunday night at Markham. Getting ramen was the perfect idea.

It's a cute place and the inside of the restaurant had a cute vibe overall. The inside was quiet and relaxed. I felt like I was at someone's mom's house. The interior is on the small side, but I already expected that to be the case. The server/owner was nice. She reminded me of cooking mama for some reason (cute). The curry ramen w/ tonkatsu was hearty and felt like home cooking (cute). There were Hello Kitty decors (cute). The unagi that I ordered was also quite cute (because the portion was on the small side but it's still enough for one person; but that will be the only seemingly negative thing I will say in this review).

Anyways, this place is blessed. God bless York region for all the great ramen restaurants. Like, honestly, I don't want to take the public transit to go to downtown Toronto just to get ramen."}
{"text":"Taste: One of the best ramen bowls I've had in Toronto/Markham/Richmond Hill! I ordered the Pork Cutlet Curry Ramen, and the broth was super flavourful but not overpowering. The tonkatsu it came with was huge, freshly fried and crispy! I also liked the fact that all the toppings were included already in the bowl and not an extra charge. There were a lot too... black fungus, green onion, corn, fish cake, and egg!

Service: The hostess was very nice and welcoming and our food came out quick.

Value: Great value! The ramen was $9.95 which is less than some other ramen restaurants not including the toppings. Again, the pork cutlet was a big piece, so it was totally worth it.

Ambiance: A small space, but nice, clean, and cozy."}
{"text":"My friend introduced me to this place and I ordered the Hokkaido Ramen bowl as he recommended. I didn't expect much as I rarely eat ramen but was pleasantly surprised with their presentation and taste. I enjoyed how the soup base was creamy and buttery. Ramen noodles was cooked to perfect al dente. I do wish that there were more toppings though.

Service was friendly. One downfall to this place was that they closed really early like 8pm or 9pm. There were still people trying to get in and wasn't aware of their closing time. Nonetheless, I will probably come back to try the other items on their menu."}
{"text":"Decided to try this ramen place out after reading Yelp reviews. Came on a Saturday night, we were seated immediately and ordered soon after. Found the ramen to be just okay, nothing amazing but decent enough.  The Ika Yaki wasn't as good as we were expecting, have had better.

Service is friendly, but the place is small and a line started forming as we were leaving the restaurant."}
{"text":"Yummy noodles and great staff.  I left bad for the only waitress as their lunch hours are really busy.  We had to wait more than 15 minutes for the food to arrive so don't come if you're in a rush.  Also the broth wasn't hot, it was lukewarm, which is why my rating is low; soup should be served hot."}
{"text":"Service was good and the portions was enough to satisfy my hunger, however I excepted more from the other reviews. The soup was ok, just ok. It was too salty for my liking, the saltiness covered up the taste of the tonkatsu. Worth a visit if your hungry, a bowl will fill you up for sure."}
{"text":"Came here to eat dinner for the first time. Ordered a ramen in pork bone soup and a pork cutlet with rice in Japanese curry. The pork bone broth tastes good. It's not too salty. Chashu is thick and marinated well. The noodle is good in general. The size of the pork cutlet is big and I do think that they did a good job in deep frying the pork cutlet. The curry source is too watery to me and the rice tastes and looks like Chinese rice."}
{"text":"Hands down the best service I have ever received at a restaurant! The ramen, gyoza, and ox tongue were out of this world!! Love the place, love the food, love the people. This is mine and my family's new go-to neighbourhood joint."}
{"text":"Sitio pequeño y con pocas mesas. Largo tiempo de espera para preparar el ramen (sobre 20 minutos). Venimos con grandes expectativas tras ver las reviews y resultó ser de los peores ramen que hemos probado en el GTA."}
{"text":"Tastiest and most well balanced Ramen in town. I have been to a few other close by ones and non are close in comparison."}
{"text":"The ramen was good but not great. I've definitely had better at other places. Probably wouldn't return to this location since I can get better ramen elsewhere."}
{"text":"I was surprised that a ramen shop was in this plaza so of course I would try it out.   Upon entering, it is a pretty small place. They have 8 tables of 4 which says that their max capacity would be 32 people.

I went during the lunch hour and it was packed with people. After checking in upon arrival, I waited about 25 minutes till my ramen came. So I do not recommend this place if you are in a rush or want a quick bite.

I ordered the bacon and cheese ramen. I was surprised that this bacon and cheese combination tasted pretty great. It is like having breakfast in a bowl with ramen. Overall, the noodles were impressive. I had better cha shu pork and egg at other ramen places so those were just sub par.  The broth wasn't thick or rich but I found it a bit oily (probably due to the bacon). As well, the broth was a little bit salty for me as I had to keep drinking tea after I finished my meal.

Service was good. The young lady who served us was quick on refilling tea even though she was the only server there.

Overall, I would come back but waiting 25 minutes for a bowl of ramen is a bit excessive for me."}
{"text":"It's cash only. Service was quick and nice. The ramen itself was good, but nothing out of the ordinary. The egg yolks were slightly soft/raw which is perfect for me.

We ordered the house tonkatsu and the katsu curry. The curry broth was good and I liked how they serve the katsu on the side, to keep it crispy.

The house tonkatsu only comes with 2 small slices of pork. The extra meat is a bit pricey for what you get (I think it's $3 for 2 pieces? Definitely not worth it). But the broth was good and not overly salty (the \"house\" tonkatsu is less salty than the regular tonkatsu, but both are still pretty salty)

Would I come back? Probably not, there's other better ramen places in the GTA in my opinion."}
{"text":"Koi Sakana is a pretty small Ramen shop in Richmond Hill.  Not too many good ones up there but Koi Sakana is one you got to try.  Besides the limited seating they have 1 person all day working the tables and cleaning up.  Which can be very slow at times.  The noodles itself was very good and perfect chewy just the way I like it.  The soup base is good for all 3 Ramens we ordered.  The server was to allow us to swap the curry ramen that came with the Katsu to the spicy Tonkotsu Ramen.  Added like $1 more.  The other 2 we got were the House Tonkotsu and the Tonkotsu  Ramen. The best one is the House Tonkotsu Ramen it was very flavorful."}
{"text":"quite tasty and best around that area.Hokkaido (Hell) ramen is quite unusual and very shrimp tasty.Level 1 is best for me.Level 2 is too chilly hot for me and I am used to spicy food."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem in Richmond Hill. This ramen joint is run by a very sweet Chinese couple and although it's no Santouka, it's pretty damn good. I always get the Hokkaido ramen and my boyfriend gets the spicy ramen level 2. Beware of level 3. My boyfriend can eat spicy food, but he suffered a little from the level 3. 
The real star at this restaurant is the pork cutlet. At $5, it is super crispy, fresh and moist. This is the best cutlet ive ever had and I've been to a lot of Japanese and Korean restaurants. The gyozas are amazing too. Legitimately pan fried. Not the cheap deep fried stuff like the other restaurants. 

Waitress is the owners wife. She is very sweet and works hard. Always makes sure we have tons of ice water (with straws). 
Only drawback is the beer is super expensive. My boyfriend ordered a Sapporo and it cost $7. Definitely not worth it. 
All in all, best ramen house in Richmond hill and Markham. Saves you the drive downtown, free parking, and no lineup."}
{"text":"First let me say, the service at this ramen house is exceptional. We had a young girl serve us and she was great. Asked for more water and it was there, extra napkins, and they came. She was the only one working the front of the room, but she did a great job given that this place was full.

The restaurant is small, probably seats 7 groups (30 people max) and it filled up fast. We got there early and got seated quickly, but we definitely beat the lunch rush. 

I got the spicy ramen, level 2 (read online that level 1 was weak), and it had a big kick to it, I probably would have enjoyed level 1 better. It was good, but I've been to other ramen houses that were better. It came with a boiled egg, some dried mini fish, corn and pork belly. You get a good portion for the price, but it just wasn't the best. Maybe I was still riding high from the other ramen place I visited downtown.

If you're looking to stay in Markham for ramen, I'd recommend you come here. If you're willing and able to drive a little further, there are plenty of other options. 

I have a feeling this winter will be ramen like last winter was my pho. Stay tuned."}
{"text":"I was craving for ramen for a while, but I prefer somewhere with lighter soup base without msg.  This place pop up during a google search, but I thought to give this place a try.  

The server was really nice and attentive, and gave me tea right away upon sitting down.  The decor was quite nice, clean and tidy.   It feels like one of those mom and pop store with a touch of hominess.  

I chose the Hokkaido ramen which has a milky broth base with tasty bbq pork, but the egg was so so.  The soup base did not make me feel thirsty at all which usually was a good indication that it did not have msg.  

The pan fried gyoza was really well done, but I was expecting a sweet soy sauce as the condiment.  As it turned out, the sauce was quite salty for my taste.   Maybe because I had the milky soup base for the ramen, the soy sauce contrasted with the sweet milky broth I just had.  

The overall experience was quite pleasant and the food without msg usually is a plus for me."}
{"text":"Dropped in to give it a try on a Saturday for a late lunch mainly out of convenience as it is next door to Yoga Tree. 

My friend and I ordered the spicy ramen level 1 and the curry pork cutlet ramen. The pork cutlet was a very generous portion and I thought the broth of the curry ramen was quite good. However, we both thought the spicy ramen was not too spicy or out of the ordinary. 

Overall, it was a good spot to have a catch up session but not sure I would come often if I wanted a ramen fix."}
{"text":"Edited because it was just ok our second time. They left us waiting for the second ramen bowl for a strangely long time and my boyfriend did not like it at all. He compared it to the instant ramens you buy at the grocery store. There's definitely better places around than this one."}
{"text":"Was craving some ramen tonight and the closest place was Koi Sakana! I've been here before but that was before I would take pictures of every meal LOL. Dinner time, around 6:30 or so on a Sunday and it is pretty much empty (granted that the place is small). The service was awesome (same as last time) and I really appreciate that. It makes your whole experience just feel good. 

Ordered the Hokkaido Ramen (milky soup base) for $9.95. Boy was it milky! Very creamy in texture. It was not too salty in my opinion which is definitely a plus while retaining a bold taste. The pork slices were amazing. Very thick and tasty. The ramen was alright. It also comes with a healthy portion of corn and black fungus which was standard stuff. 

Overall, food was pretty decent, service was excellent, they give the wifi password right on the menu and I will be returning for sure once that craving hits again :)"}
{"text":"Service is good, spicy ramen okay. Soy sauce egg was not particularly flavourful.

Reminder that they use baby shrimp in the spicy ramen so beware!

Chinese run establishment so don't expect any fancy Japanese styled dishes here. 

No credit, only debit or cash."}
{"text":"Had Ramen here on a chilly Friday night. I ordered the hokkaido Ramen which was described as having a creamy soup base. I actually loved it. If not for counting calories, I would have finished the whole bowl. The marinated eggs were perfectly cooked. The meat was so tender. The noodles could be improved though.  I still like the noodles at Kenzo Ramen. The broth was very well balanced, not too salty and had a creamy but not too heavy consistency.  My son got the cheese and bacon Ramen and said it was good. My other son had the shoyu Ramen and didn't rave about it. My husband had the spicy #2 Ramen and said it was too spicy. Lastly,  my other son got the tonkotsu Ramen and said it was okay. He kept on getting from my bowl."}
{"text":"For me good service goes a long way, it makes your mood better, the experience better, it even makes your food better. And this is why I gave this place five star. The place is kind of small and can get busy at times. Pretty standard decor for a Chinese-run place. Unfortunately there was only one waitress the time we were there and it got busy. But she was super attentive and courteous. Often checking on us when she had time, made sure we got seated right away when a table cleared so that everyone was not waiting at the door. 

Before I go into the foods, you must understand that this is a Japanese ramen place that's run by Chinese people, so it may not be the traditional Japanese ramen that you are used to. I ordered the curry katsu ramen because I was super craving Japanese curry at the time. The noodles come in a curry broth, corn, black fungus, seaweed and egg. The broth is not as rich as other Japanese noodle places but it was good for me because sometimes I find their broth too rich and I don't want to drink it. The consistency of the soup was how I like it for drinking. I like how the noodles come with all the toppings for a decent price. And the pork katsu is soooooo big! It comes on the side so that it doesn't get soggy in the soup. The noodles were nice and chewy and not soggy. Overall I really enjoyed their ramen and it was a good price. I also had some leftover pork because the portions were big. 

We also ordered the yakisoba, which I have to say didn't consist of soba noodles but their ramen noodles so it should be yaki-ramen. But it was good the way it was. Like stir-fried ramen with lots of veggies but not a lot of meat. It had some soya sauce flavour, mayo and fish shavings. Delicious! I will definitely order this again.

Overall, I will definitely come back. I love the noodles, the consistency of the soups, the pork katsu, flavourful yaki-ramen. The place was clean and the decor nice. It was an enjoyable meal. The waitress super nice, kept checking on us and refilling our tea. The peak hours may be a bit busy, there were people waiting for sure. But if the lines are not too long, totally worth it!"}
{"text":"I love the Hokkaido ramen. The broth is nice and creamy and the noodles have a nice chewy texture. Definitely would return!"}
{"text":"I had the Hokkaido ramen and was pleasantly surprised. It was rich and milky without being overly heavy. I finished the whole bowl of broth! I didn't like the noodles as much I did the broth, but it wasn't bad. Service was great; the wait staff was attentive and polite.

It's hard to find good ramen uptown, so this is definitely a new uptown favourite for me. Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I don't quite understand why the reviews are so high for this place because after comparing it to the other ramen places that I've been to recently, Koi Sakana isn't even nearly a notable competitor. 

For a Japanese cuisine, the food here tastes too Chinese. The noodles are very bouncy and chewy, and the portion sizes are small. The supposedly \"runny eggs\" were overcooked and the yolks had already solidified (if you follow my reviews, you'll know that this component is really important to me). I ordered the \"Pork Cartilage Ramen\" and I expected the cartilage to be in individual pieces like the picture on the menu but it came as one big chunky piece. I found this difficult and awkward to eat. The one sliver of narutomaki was so thinly sliced that I could barely even chew it and the soup base was very disappointingly bland.
I'm not a fan of spice but my partner ordered the Spicy Ramen at Level 2 and found it uncomfortably spicy. He also ordered extra ramen which came as a side order in a bowl without soup (it's mentioned on the menu as well), which I found weird. 

For its cheaper price and convenient location, I would give the restaurant 2.5 stars. But because the food took a long time to come even though we went pretty late at around 9pm, I've rounded down."}
{"text":"Not the best I'd ever had but it suffices for being uptown. it's a cute little mom and pop shop. Only one waiter who was doing everything! Very small so there could be a lineup. We went on a Sunday at 6 (elderly hours) and there was one free table! 

The spicy ramen...level 2 is quite spicy so don't try to be macho if you can't really handle it! Lol

The bacon and cheese ramen is exactly what it sounds like... noodles with bacon and cheese. 

The tender ribs ramen only came with one rib! What a rip. 

The noodles I didn't care for, it was more like instant noodles.. the soup is good. The pork was nice and tender. 

it's not going to be like downtown or Japan quality for that matter but they try. Lol so if you are desperately craving ramen and pork just go to ajisen."}
{"text":"3.5/5 

An in and out type of ramen joint for me, as it is nearby and relatively small in size. Visited on a Saturday night around 7 pm. Service is friendly and attentive. 

Ordered the spicy ramen (level 1 - sorry) just to test my terrible tolerance. It was pretty good, although the broth was a bit on the salty side. It still had the \"spicy but tasty\" feeling nonetheless.Noodles were nice and a bit chewy, and egg was cooked pretty well. The pork was quite flavorful as well. 

Will be returning as it is one my locations on my \"going out for a meal but not too far out\" list. Prices are on the cheaper side, albeit comparable to nearby ramen places."}
{"text":"I ordered the hokkaido ramen. Decent noodles and decent broth, but the broth isn't as flavourful as I am use it. The chasui that came with the ramen was flavourful but was kind of dry. It was also decent portion size, I still had room to eat a little bit more.

The service was good, the waitress filled our water a couple of times but the food took a while to come. 
Overall it is an ok place to come to if you're in the area, but I would probably hit up other ramen restaurants in Markham."}
{"text":"The Hokkaido Ramen with the milky tonkotsu soup base definitely lived up to its name!   The broth was extremely milky and not salty at all.  I really liked it.  The ramen was a little thick and had a great texture.  The ramen also came with BBQ pork, egg, green onion, black fungus, corn, and one of those pink swirly fishcakes."}
{"text":"I really want to give this place higher ratings because our server was just soooo nice (she may possibly be the owner?).  

The photos of the ramen looks very delicious but the reality of it is contrary and I really should have listened to one of the other Yelp reviewer Tracy T. about this place tasting Chinese.  It's true, the ramen tastes so Chinese, and the spring egg was too overcooked as shown in my photos.  I haven't been so upset leaving a restaurant in disappointment because we are trying very hard to watch what we eat now so it's so disappointing when you try something new and waste your quota on things not worth the calories! 

My husband ordered the creamy broth pork ramen and it tasted like watered down milk broth lacking in taste and salt.  My spicy ramen was only spicy and lacked in salt and flavour and all I could have tasted was just spicyness.  It was such a huge disappointment for both of us.  Our two bowls of ramen took about 20 minutes to arrive which on a Saturday half full occupancy during lunch is really not acceptable.  The spring eggs were total fail as it was overcooked and those who are ramen connoisseurs will have to agree this is not acceptable."}
{"text":"This place just opened up a few months back, and I tried them for dinner.  As  a Japanese ramen lover, I was quite disappointed by their noodle. 

Service was excellent as we were the only table there at 6pm.

Just doesn't compare up to all the ramen joints downtown."}
{"text":"Koi Sakana is a very small Chinese-operated Japanese restaurant with around 10 small tables. Although it's been around for a while, this is our first visit since it is so close to home.

The restaurant was not too busy but it remained 90% full most of the time. As they have very limited seating, it's not an ideal place for large parties. 

The menu is not too big at Koi Sakana just like most Ramen restaurants but there is a good selection of different soup base and also quite a few vegetarian options. Snacks are also available for a good price. 

Curry Pork Cutlet Ramen
One of the most important thing about ordering a pork cutlet soup noodle is to have the pork cutlet served on the side in order to retain its crunchiness. Most other restaurants just serve the cutlet on top of the ramen and once it gets to the table, the breading is all soggy. However, Koi Sakana serves it on the side by default which is very thoughtful. The pork cutlet is fried to a perfect level of crunchiness. The broth on the other hand is very rich in curry flavour and goes together extremely well with the don katsu. 

Hokkaido Milk Broth Ramen
We were very excited to try the Hokkaido Milk Broth Ramen, as not many places have milk in their soup base.  And without a doubt this is the most amazing soup we have had that comes with ramen.  The broth was very milky and creamy, it would be even better if this ramen also comes with cheese.  The meat and ramen are average, it is not bad but nothing extraordinary.  Since other components of the ramen is average, we found that we spent alot of time drinking and indulging in the broth.

Pork Cartilage Ramen in House Broth
The house broth is a rich soup base filled with pork bone flavours. The ramen has a very good consistency (not too soft, not too hard) and the egg is boiled perfectly that part of the yolk is still runny. The pork cartilage is only average as some of the meat is way too chewy (perhaps overcooked?) while the actual cartilage is cooked to a perfect jelly texture. All in all, the ramen was not the best I had but pretty high in ranking.   

We definitely recommend this cozy ramen spot if you happen to live in the area and crave for some quality ramen. We would definitely return again and we'll be looking forward to new additions to the menu!"}
{"text":"Very small establishment with limited staffing. I came here on a Friday evening and the place was full. There's only one server and it's clear that she's trying hard to do everything from greeting to cleaning to serving. 

I came with a group of 5 people. We ordered: Hokkaido ramen, 3 spicy ramen (1 level 2 and 2 level 1), and the tonkatsu pork cartilage. We also ordered one of: takoyaki, ikayaki, and pork Katsu. 

The pork Katsu came first and was breaded and fried nicely. The meat was a bit dry but the group seemed to like it. 

The takoyaki portions are small (4pc) but tastes decent. Not enough sauce. Would not get again. 

The ikayaki was overpriced and not special. It tasted like nothing except char. 

On to the ramen: it took over 45 min to get this to our table. The Hokkaido broth was yummy and milky. The spicy broth is a huuuuge difference between level 1 and 2. 1 is very mild, it does not taste spicy at all. Level 2 is ok spicy but still enjoyable. I like that they give you a full egg. It's the perfect combination of solid vs liquid, but it was served cold.. They probably pre-cook all the eggs and refrigerate them. Overall, the ramen is ok, not great. The broth can be improved. The noodles were nice and chewy though. We've definitely had better."}
{"text":"This was a really great ramen place with tasty food and reasonable prices. When me and my friend came all the tables were occupied but we only had to wait 5 minutes. 

The soups broth was tasty; I've been to ramen places downtown that were much more expensive but tasted really bland. 

I ordered number 1 which is the most popular, it's just like the traditional style but also comes with milk in the soup broth which made it more creamy. There was just one server girl but she managed fine and the service was great. I would recommend this place. It's quiet and cozy."}
{"text":"My favourite Ramen place in Richmond Hill. They Always have great quality of food and Excellent Service, please be patience when the place is busy as this is a small cozy restaurant."}
{"text":"It may not be fair to compare my experience eating at various Raman shops in Japan, but this wasn't even close to the $4 Raman places there. I ordered the spicy Raman dish. The mini shrimp didn't add anything to the flavour which it usually does and it just irritated my throat (my fault for not chewing it enough, even though it's a soup). They have 3 levels of spicy and I went with 3 the hottest. It's not as hot as Korean, Thai or other cuisines that you expect really hot foods, but it was OK enough. If this dish had regular shrimp I'd give it a 4 star rating. If the soup stock was tastier and hotter I'd give it a 5. I also had their squid, which seemed average. The portion was a good size as a meal, though with teriyaki sauce didn't feel like it was the right sauce for this and the lemon on the side didn't go with the teriyaki flavour at all. Maybe if it were cooked in the teriyaki rather than added after it may have helped a bit. Since I generally really like squid I'd still eat it again. I'm just being picky, since I've had better."}
{"text":"Pork cutlet curry ramen folks! TRUST. Big slab of pork katsu (with its own little tonkatsu dipping sauce) and the curry broth was actually realllllly tasty. It wont blow your mind like sansotei or santouka but still very flavorful.

Out of all the times I came, I never once received an egg that was overcooked (it was always liquid gold). So I guess some reviewers got unlucky with slightly overcooked eggs in their ramen.

The noodles were nice and firm, just the way I like it. Good springiness and chewy. The pork is normally very good. On two of my visits, my cutlet was slightly overdone (but really good crunch).

A bowl here will set you back $11-13. Pretty similar to what most legit ramen shops charge nowadays. I crush the curry broth to the last drop every time. 

Fair warning. The place is quite small and the owner's wife is the sole waitress AND cashier, not to mention shes SUPER FRIENDLY. She does front of the house while he cooks in the back. Very cozy mom and pop shop that actually makes very decent ramen imo. Get that pork cutlet curry ramen!"}
{"text":"First time there, only one waitress for the whole restaurant, her attitude wasn't nice to our table, but she smiled to all the other customers...., then when we got the bill and paid for it, she came back and told us that the bill hasn't included tips...  we had already left 10% on the tray, what was that about???  Asking for more tips???   Her attitude made us didn't want to leave any at all, but we did anyways!"}
{"text":"I thought to pick up  some ramen since I was not feeling good. I was around the area and of course what would be the best thing to do if I want to know the good, (if not best)  ramen around the vicinity ? It's either to Yelp it or to google it. This is one of the places that has the most reviews ( not necessarily good) and I should have read it first than just look at the numbers... anyway, I was not happy at all with  the house ramen tonkatsu and the curry ramen ... it's like meehh... I felt short changed and felt that I just wasted my money. I just had 3 sips of the broth, noodles was average the overall taste is mehh..   

I don't think I would want to go back again."}
{"text":"A little ramen shop tucked away in Richmond Hill is a hidden gem. This little shop is clean with very simple decor. I like that, cause I am not here for their decor but rather I am here for their food and soup. I got here just around dinner time, and I noticed I was the only guest. Then after 10 - 15 mins a big crowd flowed in. Another observation I made was the boss lady knows all the regular customers. So this is a neighbourhood joint. Not bad. I like the fact there's a loyal client base that consistently comes back. That is also a sign they do well with their regulars. 

So I started looking through their menu. They don't have a million offerings. That's a plus for me. Cause I find when some restaurants just decide to over diversify the number of dishes, the quality goes down drastically. Anyhow, I ordered a pork soft bone ramen with house made tonkotsu soup. My friend ordered the Hokkaido tonkotsu ramen. Not long after, the ramen came out piping hot. For mine, the tonkotsu soup is not salty at all... I LIKE!! The pork soft bone tasted great and it was really soft. Of course I like the semi runny hard boiled eggs. My friend enjoyed her Hokkaido tonkotsu ramen, namely the soup. It is milky indeed. 

Overall it's a 4 for sure. I will come back again."}
{"text":"Pretty good place to grab a bite to eat. The Ikayaki is a little cheaper here compared to some of the other japanese places i've been to but just as good. Also as a heads up, this place is ran by chinese people. 
The ramen is chewy and very tasty. I just wish they had more side dish choices 
As for the service, the waitress was very attentive. Also, this place is cash only so be sure to bring cash along with you. It doesnt accept debit or credit cards which i thought was odd for a modern day restaurant"}
{"text":"Delightfully surprising calibre of Ramen in a completely unassuming atmosphere and location. Come here for the ramen, not for anything else. 

Note that this is a different/new restaurant from the old Japanese restaurant which shared the same name in the same location. The server said they've been open for half a year when I went in March 2014. 

Location & Ambiance
Tucked in an unmemorable mini-plaza along Hwy 7, they certainly won't be relying on much drive-by advertising, and parking spots are a premium here. In fact I only noticed this place upon leaving the dentist office adjacent to them. My partner and I  went in at 3:00pm on a Saturday and grabbed a comfy booth in a mostly empty restaurant. There was plenty of natural light and soft J-pop/ballads playing in the background. Decor was simple and clean with the obligatory Tsunami and Sakura prints - still tasteful though.

Menu and Selection
Their menu is now 75% Ramen, providing around 15-20 variations, and some lunch Bento boxes and appetizers. Ramen and appetizers looked very appealing, bento boxes... not so much (but very cheap if that's the main concern). Very main-stream selection of ramens - tonkotsus, curry pork cutlets, tender pork ribs, etc.... the most unorthodox one is probably the bacon and cheese ramen. Menus were a bit confusing, as they were basically just 6 loose double-sided laminated pages - really could've at least bound them together? Menus were in English and Chinese (considering their main clientele are locals, and the owners likely being Chinese). They're LLBO'ed and serve decently-priced beverages and a typical selection of beers and sakes available from LCBO. No fancy cocktails here. So far so meh right? Well here's where they shine:

Food Quality
We ordered a \"Saltier House Tonkotsu Ramen\" and another Level 2 Spicy Ramen of which the name now escapes me. But both were simply excellent. The noodles were al-dente (reminscent of the thin noodles at Kinton Ramen before they went downhill); broth was rich, aromatic and well-balanced; pork was tender, well-marbled, and generously-portioned, as were the other ingredients. Of particular note was the order of \"extra noodles\" that actually came out to be TWICE the amount of noodles than regular, served on the side, at only $1.50 more on the bill. What! From the first bite to the last, I was very surprised at the quality of all the elements in the ramens. 

Service
Also surprisingly pleasant. We were served by a sweet, polite, and attentive female server who came to check up on us once (in Chinese-owned place this is pretty good, ha!) and refilled our tea three times during our 30 minute stay. I've read elsewhere the wait time for food was awful, but ours was very efficient, at around 5-10 minutes. Must come back during busy hours to see what's different.

Definitely will be coming back here. For the price, this place would've had my 5 stars if they had better menus, wider drink selections and if they got rid of the very sad-looking Bento Boxes. Guess it's just for a living. Prices are about $1-2 less per item than most Ramen Houses in Toronto, and on-par with many suburban ones in the area, but with much better ramen! Forget Jyuban, Raku, Aji Sai, Shogun etc etc. After my initial visit I've designated this to be my go-to Ramen house in the suburbs.

UPDATE OCTOBER 2015:
A year and a half later, I see they've bound their menus, widened their drink selection, gotten rid of the sad bento boxes, and the food is still amazing! This is small-joint ramen DONE RIGHT. Upgrade to 5 stars all the way!"}
{"text":"I'm not entirely familiar with ramen other than the instant Shin Ramen you can get at a Korean market but recently my family went to visit a ramen house for the first time and now my husband is hooked. We decided to visit this restaurant to broaden our knowledge of ramen and see what other tastes there are out there. 

Based on my previous experience at the first ramen restaurant I went to, this place has a better tasting broth. There's more depth to it: it's salty, flavourful and the broth is thick (not watery). The noodles were similar to the instant noodles but tastes fresh. I liked that the texture was similar.

My only issue was that the bowl sizes were a bit small for the price. The first ramen place I went to had much bigger servings at the same price. I left the restaurant feeling quite hungry still- I suppose I should order some appetizers next time.. But still, it kind of sucks knowing I have to pay more at this restaurant to get full when I can just pay less at another restaurant to get more full! 

Like I said, taste-wise I don't know what \"good\" or \"bad\" ramen tastes like so I will have to go to a few more ramen places and try out their broths and noodle and then come back to write another review. 

The service here was great. We had water and tea on our table right away and the kind waitress helped me pick out a bowl when I wasn't sure what to get (I decided on the most popular pork broth with the milk in it). My husband got the super spicy bowl (level 2 spice). I tried it and it was amazing! It's the kind of spice that adds flavour and doesn't bite your throat in a bad way. 

I would definitely come back here!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and any criticism I have of this restaurant basically amounts to \"they take debit but not credit\" and \"their menu could be more extensive in terms of non-ramen options\". Obviously neither of these things are significant for me, because I'm writing a five-star review.

I don't come here for gyoza or tonkatsu, but they do have these things and they're good. The star here is the ramen. I usually get some form of tonkotsu and it's flavorful, filling, hearty, and tasty. I like the toppings they have (bacon cheese ramen!) and the noodles are great. It's a small place with only a few employees, so I could see the wait being an issue at times. (I've never experienced it, though, so I can't say for myself.) Awesome ramen - recommended."}
{"text":"The waitress has always been very welcoming and the food superb. You have a choice of either free water or free tea upon arrival but not both, as you'll be charged. The ramen is probably the best in town and the food fresh.

The space is clean."}
{"text":"I love the spicy miso soup that they have. I get the spiciest but I don't die of sweat I only just cry a little bit. The tiny shrimps in there are so good. as well as getting  extra noodles. I think it's more like 1.5x noodles - great prices ! Definitely a go to for me if I don't feel like going to toronto. :)"}
{"text":"The texture of the ramen is really hard and when I ordered for extra noodles. They said that they can only give it on the side. Afterwards when the extra noodles came, the ramen has no soup in them. Not even edible.  The quality of the food is poor."}
{"text":"Nice little restaurant to get your Ramen fix. Nothing fancy, but reasonably priced, no line ups, good service, and decent food. We got the Hokkaido milk tonkotsu Ramen and asked for no salt. Was so nice being able to get broth that isn't pre-made and loaded with salt. Our friendly server was concerned there would be no taste and even brought us a salt shaker to the table... but it was just right. Will be back again..."}
{"text":"Came in around 4 pm, didn't realize they were about to close to prepare for dinner so we were the last customers. Makes sense why the waitress was rushing us to order. Ordered the spicy ramen, it was good, the broth is creamier then I'm used to and I enjoyed the egg that came with it. Noodles were nice and chewy but I didn't like the baby shrimp that came as a topping. Overall good but slightly overpriced for the quantity."}
{"text":"Did back to back ramen today so I have some good comparison. How did this place get such good reviews?  

1/3 of the menu is crossed out (no longer available), and were out of the volcano spinach by 7pm - prime dinner time. 

Our table ordered the 3 different types of tonkatsu (which all looked exactly the same) as well as the beef udon. This was not authentic ramen. It looked like instant noodle ramen and was waaay undercooked (practically crunchy) and the eggs were cold. The soup base for the Hokkaido ramen was very bland however the pork itself was very flavourful, which made my dinner bearable. Prices were pretty standard, but I can get better ramen for the same price within walking distance. 

Wont be coming back to this one."}
{"text":"Surprised I never came across this place since I am always in this area. Store is clean. Our waitress was super kind and quick to assist. Portion size was on the larger side compared to other places. Appetizers were good + at a fair price point.  Overall would come back to try other types of ramen and apps! (Ps. The joint is run by Chinese folks)"}
{"text":"3.5 stars ~ I was there around 1pm on a weekday last week and all tables were occupied. I offered to \"split\" my table to accommodate two customers who were waiting. Good that they provide free WiFi, password (phone number) was on the menu cover.

I ordered the Spicy Ramen on the menu. When I asked for Level 3, the friendly waitress double-checked to make sure I knew that was the highest spice level. I assured her I could take it and yes, it provided the right amount of heat I was seeking that day.

My one bowl took a while to emerge from the kitchen though, even though the other tables already received their food. But it was good! The BBQ pork was delectable and its flavour stood out even though it was steeped in my red hot bowl of fire. I will be thinking of an excuse to come here again..."}
{"text":"I went to Koi Sakana last Saturday, my second visit in the past 3 weeks,

This tiny restaurant located in a strip mall is absolutely amazing!!  They have a simple menu with LOTS of delicious choices.  I ordered the House Special BBQ pork ramen and it was fantastic.  The noodles are made to perfection, the toppings are carefully prepared, and the seasoning is just right.  Each bowl of noodles is delicious!  You can request extra toppings or extra noodles to customize your dish for a small extra cost (I requested extra BBQ pork).  My friends ordered a variety of choices from Hokkaido to spicy ramen to pork cutlet and curry ramen and everyone liked their food.  

This is a small restaurant so the owner doubles as the only waitress.  She knows all the menu items very well and provides friendly, efficient service.  Me and my friends all got exactly what we ordered - delicious, tasty ramen!  

I took a photo of my ramen... I will update this review later when I can find the photo on my phone.

Koi Sakana is now my favorite Ramen restaurant.

4.7 / 5.0"}
{"text":"Authentic ramen is always a welcoming additional to the Markham neighborhood!  Koi Sakana is my latest find!  Came here on a weekday with a friend after hearing some positive feedbacks from this place.  On a weekday at around 7, there was no lineup, which was perfect considering the size of this restaurant is relatively small.

My friend and I ordered the House Tonkotsu Ramen and the Spicy Ramen (Spicy level 2), both are $8.95.  Ramen looks legit with lots of ingredients, noodles texture is very chewy as well which if you had been reading my reviews, it is a MUST.  The Spicy Ramen, considering my friend went with Level 2, i found it acceptable although I don't eat that spicy, so if you LOVE spicy food, go with Level 3 instead and that should satisfy your cravings.  Did the ramen really wow me? Not really, but I though the price they charge is very low considering they offer you decent quality ramen with generous amount of ingredients.

Definitely coming back to try other items on their menu in the future."}
{"text":"One of the better ramen places that isn't downtown Toronto. The place isn't very big but it's quiet and the service is good. The ramen is rather good, and pretty much one of the few places that has a curry ramen. Some of the appetizer/snacks are a little overpriced for the amount you get  but the ramen is on the more inexpensive spectrum for ramen which is good. This is the second time I've been here and would probably go again."}
{"text":"We were in the Richmond Hill area looking for food places on Yelp and decided to drop by after seeing the good reviews here.

We arrived at this cozy ramen restaurant and ordered the Spicy Ramen Level 2 and the House Tonkotsu Ramen. The waitress, who was the only server working that day, was very sweet and attentive. Our food arrived quickly. The Spicy Ramen Level 2 is deceivingly spicy -- I think if we were to order the bowl again, we would get the Level 1. The House Tonkotsu was very savoury and satisfying. We were glad that the broths weren't laden with fat like we had seen at Kinton Ramen (where you can actually see clusters of tiny fat pieces swimming in the broth with every spoonful). The eggs were perfectly cooked with gooey yolks. The size of the noodles is on the thin side compared to other ramen we have tried. 

The food itself was pretty good though; definitely a great option if you are craving ramen but don't want to travel all the way downtown. The prices were fair (our bowls were $8.50 each) and additional toppings do not come at a steep price ($1.50 for an extra piece of BBQ pork). Please keep in mind that it is cash only and the restaurant is not very large -- probably seats 20 people at most."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed it, will be coming back definitely. Ramen we had was very tasty, and not as fat as what we had in some other places, yet flavourful. Liked this ramen a lot more than Sansotei Markham ramen."}
{"text":"Tasty ramen and I even drank the soup! The fried pork cutlet was hot and crispy! Like other places, you have to arrive early, otherwise you wait awhile because it is a small place. And only one waitress who does an extremely excellent job! Would come back but perhaps not on a weekend."}
{"text":"We ordered the spicy and house ramen and the grilled calamari when went there for dinner. I thought the spicy ramen was very good. I got the level 1 spicy. I thought the broth was nice and balanced. The pork was tender and the egg was perfectly cooked. I know it's a sin to say that but I wasn't the biggest fan of the dried baby shrimp on top. I could do without them in general. They remind me of fish food. My wife got the house ramen and  really liked it. The noodles were tender and the broth was hearty, and right amount of salt.

Didn't enjoy the calamari. Mainly maybe because it was served a while after we got our ramen and we were almost full by then. 

Service was very good and friendly."}
{"text":"I have found it! The best ramen in Richmond Hill! The ramen is near perfection and the prices are very reasonable!

As a lover of tonkatsu ramen, I absolutely had to get the Hokkaido Ramen (Milky Tonkotsu Soup Base). The soup base was rich and creamy as promised. Not only that, but the pork was amazing!  It consisted of juicy meat, sandwiched between layers of fat that melt in your mouth. To complement such delicious pork, the noodles were also cooked to perfection.

There was also only one server, but it is amazing how much one woman can do! Tonight, the restaurant was packed, yet our server was still so kind and attentive. 

Overall, I had a great experience! This is the first place I would recommend to all my friends who love ramen!"}
{"text":"I did not come here with high expectations as I have been let down by many Scarborough and Markham ramen stores. But as a ramen lover. I still wanted to try this place out. We ordered the beef tongue ramen, curry pork katsu rice, katsu spicy ramen and their level2 spicy ramen. Everything tasted good. Their eggs were done perfectly, ramen noodles were chewy and the broth was delicious! Their waitress was also really nice and attentive. Super impressed and happy that I gave them a try. Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant for the first time tonight based on previous yelp reviews. I was disappointed by the quality of the food. I ordered the Hokkaido ramen and my husband tried the Spicy ramen level 2. We also ordered squid balls and pork cutlet. The Hokkaido ramen soup was quite bland, and the BBQ pork was too chewy. The spicy ramen soup was flavorful and hot as advertised. However, the ramen noodles tasted like instant noodle quality, it did not taste fresh or homemade. The side dishes were satisfactory, nothing special about the flavor. The waitress was very nice and attentive.  There was only 1 waitress for the entire restaurant, the poor lady looked quite overworked. Another plus is the parking lot is easy to navigate. Overall I probably wouldn't recommend this restaurant or return."}
{"text":"This ramen house is a mom and pop shop with great service and great prices. Their menu is small, but that's typical of good ramen houses. I got the House Tonkotsu bowl. It looks deceivingly small, but my stomach was happy. I thoroughly enjoyed every bite of that bowl!"}
{"text":"Such a cute little restaurant that looks family owned. The waitress was very attentive and immediately served us drinks. I order the Spicy Ramen Level 1 (Not really that spicy for all you spice lovers so 2 is like medium) with an extra order of pork cartilage. The portions definitely surprised me, as the other ramen places tend to be stingy on the protein part but man, WAS I FULL. Totally hit the spot, would come again 10/10!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a ramen place with a 'home cooked' feel--this is it.
(Try the House Tonkotsu Ramen!)"}
{"text":"I was excited to see that a new ramen place had open so close to where i lived. At the same time, I wasn't expecting much from the little ramen joint that were run by non-Japanese owners. I was quite skeptical but I decided to give it a try given the good reviews.

I have to say I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of their ramen. My boyfriend and I order the spicy ramen level 2 and the curry katsu (fried pork cutlet) ramen. The ramen was thick and al dente and the bone broth was very flavourful. Their soft-boiled egg was perfect, it was well marinaded and the yolk was orange and gooey. The spicy ramen at level 2 had a good kick without overpowering everything. (However, i can take quite a bit of heat). What I loved about it, were the little dried shrimps that gave it another dimension of texture and flavour. The curry ramen came with a sizeable portion of pork cutlet, which was accompanied by its own katsu sauce. However, the curry broth was rich enough to accompany the pork as it is. 

I am very satisfied with Koi Sakana and definitely will be coming back to try the other dishes. Definitely excited that I don't have to travel all the way to downtown for a good bowl of ramen :)"}
{"text":"This ramen place has the cutest server. Unfortunately the ramen wasn't as amazing as everyone stated. The Tonkotsu is what I ordered. The pork and the eggs were tasty. The broth was alright. The noodles, I wasn't a fan of. 
I know they serve different style of noodles for ramen, and I believe the curly ones are \"Chinese\" style (I might be wrong). Just wasn't a fan."}
{"text":"This is a small 30 seat Ramen house. When we got arrived, the place was just opening, so there was no one there. That means, excellent service due to being the only table around. I was pretty exciting visiting this ramen house.

This was my first chance to try Tonkotsu Ramen in a restaurant, and I have to admit that I wasn't impressed. I was expecting so much more, but I have made my own Tonkotsu Ramen that was quite a bit better than what I was able to experience here on my first try. There wasn't much toppings either, and after eating my meal, I was still very, very hungry. So hungry that I had to go somewhere else to get something else to eat. 

I haven't been to too many Ramen houses, but I definitely plan to try something better than this shop."}
{"text":"Meh. I don't see what the big deal is here. 

A small ramen shop that can seat around 25. It wasn't too busy when we dropped in here last Wednesday.

Okay, the broth was pretty good. But the noodles failed to impress, and the meat was dry and chewy. The egg was cooked proper but failed to wow me. They have weird flavours like bacon and cheese ramen. My friend wanted the pork cartilage ramen but were only informed it was unavailable when trying to order. 

The menu has errors in it. In most, it will say pork x2 which, I guess means 2 pieces of pork, but the Hokkaido ramen, it just says pork. We asked if there is less pork in that one and she said no it's the same, it's just a printing error. Well, you should fix it.

Service was good though, quick and pleasant. 

They do sell Asahi Black though, which seems to be running out all over the city haha."}
{"text":"Koi Sakana does ramen right. I been here many times and it is one of the best ramen place in Richmond hill if not all of the GTA. Usually i order the hokkaido ramen with the milky tonkotsu soup base. This time I decided to try the curry tonkatsu. Not really a fan of the curry but everything else I have tried is amazing. 

The broth was hot and the noodles were thin and had a nice chewy texture. The waitress is super friendly and attentive. Note very few tables so there might be a bit of a wait during lunch hours."}
{"text":"It's time to update my review for Koi Sakana.  It's obvious I'm always craving for their ramen based on the number of check-ins . I have my usual order,  the lady owner knows by now.  I always order the pork cartilage ramen with spicy level 1 broth.  The spicy level 2 ramen is reserved on cold rainy nights.  :) 


 Another ramen place opened uptown not so recently (Sansotei) With the hype,  I heard one should be ready for at least a 20minute wait. I thought eventually the hype would die down, but when I went there 2 weeks ago,  it was still a long line up at around 830 pm. This was actually my second time,  the first,  I gave up after 15 minutes of waiting and decided to go to a wings place. 

The reason for the bump up from 4 to 5 stars is based on the quality of food,  service and value of Koi Sakana.  Sansotei's ramen doesn't even close to theirs.  Koi's noodles are the right consistency,  the broth very flavourful and being able to customize your broth makes it interesting each visit.  The pork at Koi didn't have that 'porky' taste, it's all tender bbq goodness.  The egg is always cooked perfectly,  gooey yolk. Portions are decent,  it always satisfies even when I'm starving after yoga. :)  Their ramen IMHO is better than momofoku too. Service is on point.  Even when the place is packed, and the lady owner is the only server,  rest assured you will be getting constant tea refills with a smile. Now that's 5 stars worthy in my books."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Small and cozy, and unbelievably comfortable. Me and my friend were looking for late evening grub in the area and happened to find this little gem tucked away. I got the seafood curry ramen (around $11, if I remember correctly) and my friend got the Hokkaido ramen ($9). Overall, delicious food + would go back + would recommend to anyone and everyone! Ditch the packaged ramen, come here instead. Worth every penny!"}
{"text":"I popped by here quickly for lunch the other day as I had some errands to run on the weekend. Came in for lunch around noon on a Saturday and it was getting busy, but luckily there was still a table available for me so i got seated right away. 

They have a lot of choices for the ramen noodles, particularly in terms of the broth there were definitely a few selections. It looked like the hokkaido ramen seems to be one of their top contenders, so I decided to try that along with a side of gyozas. For their ramen they had 2 sizes and I got the regular size.

The gyozas were pretty good, nicely fried and it was hot, the dipping sauce was nice on the side but I just dipped a little bit otherwise it would be too salty.

The ramen was amazing! For this shop I would definitely says i'ts a hidden gem coz there are certainly a lot of restaurant options in the area, but i was quite surprised to find this place their ramen is certainly more than decent. I love the hoikkado broth - i did drink it and i even packed some home LOL. I was worried it would be too milky for me, but it worked quite well along with the thickness of the pork bone broth and the combo together was just lovely. Ramen was springy and had nice texture to it and I felt the price is quite reasonable for a bowl of ramen this size. 

All in all, I was quite pleased with my discovery and I would say this is definitely a neighbourhood gem and should I be back in this area again in the future I would definitely consider coming here again!"}
{"text":"I can't believe there is a ramen restaurant that I feel is really good and deserves more recognition/popularity. Usually I hate going to ramen restaurants due to the long lineup and the food not living up to the hype, but Koi is definitely a ramen restaurant that I will for sure to revisit and recommend. 

Environment:
The plaza is pretty easy to find and get to if you drive a car. But then again, it is super inconvenient to get anywhere if you don't own a car in Markham/Richmond Hill. There are plenty of parking at the plaza, however, it seems that there are more cars now due to the new hot pot place that recently opened, but there are still loads of parking space at the back. 
The restaurant itself is pretty small though, best for a casual dine-out for groups of 4 and under. 

Food:
Since this is a ramen restaurant it's no brainer that you must try their ramen dishes. Me and my friend both decided to order the Hokkaido Ramen (about $10) plus a Deep Fried Pork Cutlet (about $5) on the side, just in case there wasn't enough toppings in the ramen. The ramen ended up being really filling though, and for the toppings there was 1 egg, 2 slices of bbq pork, 1 small slice of fish ball, some corn, black fungus, green onion, and a strip of seaweed in the bowl. The soup was really nice and creamy, and it was relieving to see that there was no MSG in it since I didn't get super thirsty after the meal. The Pork Cutlet wasn't that good in my opinion and the batter is a little too thick. If you feel that you won't be full from the ramen you should just add extra pork to the noodle as opposed to order side dishes.  
They also have tofu cheesecake for $4 a slice, but I was already too full after my meal to give it a try. The alcohol menu was pretty large as well and they have some other interesting Japanese beverages.

Service:
The service was actually pretty good. Our waitress was really friendly and attentive and she would come by on occasion to ask how the food is and to refill our tea."}
{"text":"A simple ramen joint run by Chinese and in my opinion they do a pretty good job at it. I thought the menu was very simple to follow and liked how there were pictures for many of the items. 

As per usual, I read up on Jennifer K's review and when I saw a 4 star rating based on their ramen I had to go visit ASAP.

It was a really hot summer day so I only got the spicy ramen level 1 for $8.50. Not that I can't handle the spice but I didn't want to be sweating even more than I already was. Level 1 spice was not spicy at all in my opinion. The noodles had a nice chew, pork meat was good, broth was nice. Came with boiled egg which is a plus but the real kicker were those baby shrimps which only comes with the spicy ramen. They were crispy and quite tastey. (Yes, I said 'kicker' and stole a line that Guy Ferretti normally uses).

Also tried a bit of the Hokkaido ramen which was just as good as the spicy ramen. I really liked the creamy broth in this one.

Service was nice and quick."}
{"text":"my favourite ramen spot! definitely get the jelly sake & Hokkaido ramen!"}
{"text":"Disappointing. This place was just another ramen place I wish I never tried. 

My boyfriend and I had a late lunch around 2:30pm - 3:00pm. The restaurant was half empty and service was okay at first but after awhile service became very slow. 

We ordered the following: 
* Vegetable Tonkotsu
* House Tonkotsu

The broth lacked depth and flavour, I had to add red chili pepper for more flavour. The noodles were nothing special and resembled instant noodles. There was nothing outstanding to comment on and in short, it was quite disappointing. 

The worse part of the entire experience is how long we waited for a bowl of ramen. It was well over 15-20 minutes and it wasn't very busy to begin with. There are many ramen places nearby which I would have rather gone to. This place never again will I waste my time at again."}
{"text":"I dont understand why there has to be such a hype when it comes to Japanese food that the food has to be authentic and that the establishment has to be owned by a true Japanese person. Trust me, I'm pretty sure a true japanese person could make a bad bowl of ramen. Koi Sakana is more than capable of proving other establishments that they know how to make their ramen. 

This place is quite cozy, standard size but what really stood out to me and my partner was that the quality of the two dishes that we ordered. 

The Hokkaido ramen had an incredibly rich and savory broth but the flavour for the curry in the curry katsu did not impress us. However, the size and crispiness of the katsu that came on the side made up for it. I also appreciate how the ramen came with an egg. As sad as it sounds, I do not think it is a good idea for ramen places to continue to charge extra for an egg - it leaves a bad taste in my mouth and I tend to avoid those places (i'm looking at you kinton)......

Overall, I think this is a solid place to go for a bite. I just wish there was a combo with just the katsu and the Hokkaido ramen. Definitely looking forward to coming back someday if I come across this area."}
{"text":"When I heard about a Chinese run ramen place, I was a little skeptical to be honest.  However, Koi Sakana was a pleasant surprise.

Pros:
Very good bowl of ramen
Excellent customer service

Cons:
Portions are smaller

I love myself a good bowl of ramen.  Aside from the usual suspects located downtown, there aren't too many good places for ramen uptown.  When I heard of a Chinese run ramen place, I wasn't exactly jumping for joy.  Koi Sakana proved me wrong completely.

Koi Sakana is the definition of a hidden gem.  It's hidden within a small plaza so if you're not looking for it, you'll miss it.  Once you walk in, you notice this place is nothing fancy.  Simplistic, yet gets the job done.  The place only has a couple of ramen bowls to pick from, but there's enough variety to satisfy any ramen lover.

My GF and I both order the House Tonkatsu ramen.  It's nice to know that the ramen automatically comes with toppings like a whole egg, corn, fish cake, black fungus and seaweed included in the price. The broth was better than I expected.  Not as rich as places like Santosei, but very good nonetheless.  The noodles were very good.  I don't like non Japanese ramen places like Kenzo and Sonoya as much because I feel the noodles don't match up to their Japanese counterparts.  The noodles here were very good.  Just enough bite to them.  My only gripe is the portions are smaller than other places.  If you're a big eater you'll need to add extra noodles and cha siu for sure.  Even after adding them, it still feels smaller than a regular bowl of ramen anywhere else.  

The waitress there was super nice and friendly.  She saw we had out little one, and got out separate bowls and utensils for her.  Our cups of water were refilled without asking and napkins given to us whenever we ran out all as well.  She would come over and make sure all was well a couple of times as well.  Out little one is usually shy around strangers but even she was able to laugh with the waitress too.

All in all, this is a wonderful place to get ramen that's not located downtown.  It won't replace Santosei as my fav, but it's definitely my fav uptown as of right now.  If you're in the area and craving ramen, definitely give this place a try!"}
{"text":"While it is nice to be able to get ramen in Richmond Hill, it's just that, ramen in Richmond Hill. There isn't too much competition around and the quality just does not compare to places like Sansotei, Hokkaido Ramen Santouka, etc.  

The staff here have always been pleasant every time we've been here and we never have to wait too long (if at all) for a table. 

Their tonkotsu broth was not deep and flavorful as it should be, this goes for both the house-style and Japanese style version. The noodles were okay, the pork was dry but too fatty at the same time, and the egg was very overcooked and not runny at all. Actually, I don't think I've ever had a non-overcooked egg here. 

We've tried some of their other soup bases as well, none of them very memorable and none that we'd come back to get again. 

Next time I have a ramen craving, I'll be making the trek downtown."}
{"text":"I ordered the house tokotsu ramen, it was delicious! The ramen came with a little bit of corn, an egg, seaweed and pork.

Opening up a ramen place in Richmond Hill, why didn't anyone think of this sooner?! .. This seems to be the only ramen place in the area..and that is why its great...dont need to travel to Yonge & Finch for Ajisen/Kinton or Warden & Steeles..

The broth is quite milky and flavourful..portions are in no way large..but I guess just enough for one portion."}
{"text":"Ramen is pretty good and hot saki definitely tastes amazing to go with it.  I had the Japanese style tonkatsu ramen and made it medium spicy which was delicious and made me sweat.

The only reason why I am giving this place a 4 stay is because she didn't get my order correct but I was too hungry to wait for them to correct their mistakes.  And she gave us our appetizer as dessert which means she obviously forgot to give it to us because we were already finished with our ramen and our squid was room temperature.

Other than that food is delicious. Place is small and seating is limited so hopefully you get there before all the seats get taken up.  And they only take cash or debit."}
{"text":"A hidden gem in Richmond Hill and it's my go-to place for ramen if I'm ever craving. Hands down one of the best ramen places in the GTA. I am particularly a fan of their curry cutlet ramen. It's different but so delicious and you can't go wrong with their hokiddo ramen, such a classic and its taste is to perfection. Plus, every bowl comes with a WHOLE egg, not like typical places that give you half. The whole egg pretty much sold me on this place. Pretty much all their ramens are delicious...I haven't been disappointed with anything. Service is wonderful and they have free Wi-Fi. I would definitely recommend this place to all ramen lovers!"}
{"text":"Had a sudden craving for ramen so the BF and I came here yesterday for dinner seeing that it had a high star rating.

Normally I would get a spicy ramen but due to me coughing a lot, I settled for the House Tonkotsu ramen instead. The BF got the Spicy Level 1 ramen. 

My ramen in general was alright, the broth was nice and creamy but lacked a bit in flavour. Each table had Togarashi seasoning for you to use so I added a bit of that into my ramen. I may be biased since I generally like my ramen spicy.

I tried a sip of the BF's broth and was very surprised by how spicy it was! Very envious, I would probably try that if I come again.

Overall this felt like it was 3 star place . I gave one extra star for the potential of me liking it more if I tried other ramen AND I was completely impressed with the service!!

The time that I was there, the restaurant was packed full with a few people waiting. There was only ONE SERVER and man was it amazing to watch this lady whiz around serving people. She was attentive and friendly, not something you would really expect from an Asian restaurant #thetruth. I think I enjoyed the service more than the ramen LOL."}
{"text":"This the best Ramen I've had outside the city. The broth was delicious, try the Hokkaido ramen. I'm happy I have a good ramen spot in the GTA."}
{"text":"Came here after reading the reviews on the food. I was excited to try a ramen place that was not my usual go tos downtown. Have to say, was not disappointed. 

We started with the gyoza, absolutely loved them. They were crispy on some places but soft when you bite on it as well. Also meat was not dry at all, which I have a problem with sometimes. 

I got the house Tonkatsu ramen, which was so good. I like how the noodles were cooked perfectly. The meat was a bit fatty for my liking, but still very tender when eating it. After reading the reviews about the boiled eggs, I was concerned mine were going to be over cooked, but they weren't. They were perfectly cooked in my opinion. Warning for those who not a fan of the yolk being not fully cooked, who was my mom, it is a bit runny. 

As for the service, the girl that was serving us was absolutely the sweetest. She was always smiling and made sure that our tea cups were never empty. We also sat for a bit and we did not feel like we were rushed out of there at all.

The restaurant was small, but ramen places usually are. It was very clean which is huge for me."}
{"text":"I've had pretty much all the dish here and love them all. Friendly fast service. 

\"Great Ramen House\"."}
{"text":"Small, clean place with good service - server came back a couple of time asking if we were ok.  Noodle was good and tasty! I would come back again for a quick ramen meal."}
{"text":"My boyfriend introduced me to this place and its been his all time favourite. 
Ive never been the biggest fan of this place, but the reason why I come back is because of my bf ofc, but also because the waitress (Sammi) who works there is incredibly kind. She always remembers us and what we like to order even though we don't come here often. 

We always order the same thing whenever we go here. 
He gets the curry ramen with pork katsu on the side ($13.99) 
I always change the curry soup to a spicy soup base (level 2 spice) with pork katsu on the side ($14.49, 50 cents more to change soup base). 
The portions are huge and our stomachs are always happy when we finish. 

Overall, this place is serve great food and the service is outstanding. I would still choose to go to Sansotei or Kinton, but I wouldn't mind coming here either :)"}
{"text":"One of the best Ramen places you can find in Richmond Hill. 

Taste- I love the milky broth. Tried the spicy one and it had little shrimps in it which taste very special.

Service - Server is excellent and friendly.

Price - It is on the fair side, many places charge extra just for the egg!

Space - The restaurant is pretty small, will need to wait if you come at peak times. Lots of parking."}
{"text":"Pretty decent Ramen that is NOT coming from your usual chain/franchise Ramen restaurants. I ordered the hokkaido Ramen and the soup was very flavourful (similar to a tonkotsu Ramen) and the noodles were well done. What was nice was that their Ramen came with more toppings compared to other Ramen joints, but I found their chashu to be a little rough and not nearly as flavourful as kinton's. 

They also have other dishes such as the unagi don (which was deliciously made), as well as sushi dishes, too. 

Although Koi Sakana is not my favourite Ramen restaurant, it is quite worth it for the price, and they have take out which is perfect for those who work around the area."}
{"text":"*I've been to many ramen places in Toronto, my favourite one is hokkaido ramen santouka at church and Dundas, so maybe that's why this placed scored low. (High standards)*

Service: The server was constantly topping up our tea and when I asked for spicy level 3 for the spicy ramen she said she doesn't recommend that I do, I asked why and she said because it's too spicy and I said I really enjoy spicy but she still insisted I don't which I thought was strange. 

Food: I got the spicy level 2 ramen, the broth was lacking the spice I wanted, it had no depth or richness to it. Noodles were typical ramen noodles, in this dish they put all these tiny dried up shrimp which completely killed the whole dish for me. I didn't enjoy the texture of them nor them floating around in my soup making the soup fishy. The egg wasn't even a soy egg it was just a plain egg boiled medium. 

Also had the gyoza (dumplings) lacked flavour and I can tell it was not Japanese style. Maybe this was because it's not run by Japanese people, the experience and food wasn't authentic or tasty for that matter. 

Wouldn't go again, would rather hit up a grocery store for instant noodles and do it up myself."}
{"text":"When my wife first told me about this place about how their ramen bowls are only about 9 dollars or so plus tax... I was very skeptical about the quality.   I've had ramen from other places around this price range and they were absolutely crap.  So my wife and I decided to check it out.  As others mentioned, the place was a bit tricky to find. 

When we got there, I ordered the spicy ramen with a level 2 hotness and my wife ordered the Hokkaido ramen.   When our bowls arrived, it looked delicious! My first sip of the broth was heavenly.   I couldn't believe what I was tasting! The ramen tasted fresh and a bit chewy just how I like it.   Level 2 spicy was not really spicy for me but it still packed a bit of heat as the meal went on.   The pork meat was nice and tender.   My wife enjoyed her bowl as well.  My only complaint was that the soft boiled egg was extremely cold on the inside.  It seemed they boiled a bunch of eggs in the back and stored it in the fridge and simply cut it and serve when an order is placed. They could of at least warm it up or something. 

 Anyway, for the price and quality, this would definitely give all the major ramen places like kinton and sansotei a run for its money.  We will definitely make this place our top spot for our ramen fixes."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and enjoyed my experience here. Richmond Hill doesn't offer much ramen options , so you either have to travel to Markham, downtown, or Yonge Street, not until recently Kinton Ramen established in the area. It is a small restaurant, the seating is less than 30 people with casual ambience. Take out is available. This is not a chain restaurant more like a family run type restaurant.

Customer service is definitely great here even with one wait staff. She hosts and waits tables. She is very nice and friendly. She does remember customers who comes often. You are offered tea or water to start and are brought quickly to your table.

The menu is small which is typical for small restaurants to ease food and pricing management, maybe slightly more options than Sansotei Raman (Markham Location) regarding the appetizers. The price is reasonable with the portions you get, which makes this place more economical than other ramen places I have went (i.e. Sansotei, Hokkaido. and Ajisen) However, I do wish they update their menu instead of crossing out the unavailable items and new pricing, especially with the new competition in the area. 

Taste wise is good but not specticular. I generally order the House Tonkotsu Ramen with one appetizer. The ramen isn't memorable, but if you need to satisfy your ramen craving, it did the job for me, especially with portion and price ratio. I am always full after going to this place. So I can't really complain. 

I wouldn't say this place is authentic, but it is sufficient. I have eaten at Sansotei and Hokkaido ramen in downtown Toronto locations, which have more authenticity than Koi Sakana, since they are run by Japanese people. Just because the ramen isn't made by Japanese people doesn't mean it is bad. So if you are the type who is loves authentic ramen, then this place isn't for you.

Overall, good experience with decent food to satisfy my craving without burning a hole in my wallet, and with good customer service, which is why I give 4/5 stars for this place. I would go to other ramen places only if I was craving for a particular type of ramen that this place doesn't offer like Tomato Ramen. If you are price conscious and not looking for authenticity, then this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Soup is super thin and watery; no flavor. 
Noodles are bland and toppings is practically non-existent (barely any green onions or corn)

The positives: egg was runny and pork was good. 

Would not recommend, there are many better ramen places in Toronto."}
{"text":"This is another attempt by Chinese to cook a Japanese classic. Ramen was not good at all. The soup base, the noodles and the toppings were sub standard. Also had the curry and man that was some watery mish mash. I wish I had taken a picture. I honestly would not recommend this place to anyone. The only reason for the extra star was the server was super nice."}
{"text":"[Good]
Flavours - What makes this place good is the flavour of the broth.  It's always robust and tasty no matter what choice.

Ingredients - Not too bad when it comes to portion size and the amount of stuff that comes with the ramen.  Whether it's tenderous rib or BBQ pork, I don't feel like they skimp.

Menu - Small, focused menu leads to better quality.

[Bad]
Prices - I used to come here a lot because it offered a tasty bowl at great value but it seems prices have gone up along with all the other ramen places.

Slow - Literally just a mom and pop shop.  The wife serves and the husband cooks in the back.  Although a small restaurant, sometimes the food comes out slowly, especially when ordering yaki soba.

[Worth it?]
On this latest visit, it didn't feel like old times and I didn't find myself enjoying it as much as before.  Maybe with the higher price I set a higher standard or maybe other places have stepped up their game since then.

In previous years it would be a no brainer value winner.  Now that prices have gone up, I'm not sure $15 for a bowl is considered value anymore.  Still, if you haven't been here before, it's worth at least a try.  If you have been here before, then you already know that you will at least have a decently enjoyable meal."}
{"text":"Simple and classic ramen. Delicious, coming back again! 

Came to try this ramen joint for the first time on New Years Eve with my boyfriend around the 6PM mark and luckily for us, the place was quite empty. The location is kind of difficult to find although once you know where it is in the plaza, it shouldn't be a problem coming back. We actually got lost trying to find it since we didn't know which plaza it was in... oops. 
There was an abundance of parking spaces although the restaurant is quite small and could probably seat at most, 25 people.

As mentioned before, there were only a few people in the restaurant at the time so the waitress topped off our drinks every time as needed and was very hospitable and kind. Our food arrived no longer than 10 minutes of waiting (uh yes, I need to be fed.... FAST). 

I tried the Hokkadio Ramen (milky broth ramen - $9.95) while the BF got the regular House Tonkotsu Ramen ($8.95). If you cannot decide between the two, I personally recommend you to get the House Tonkotsu. They pretty much taste the same - very delicious. The only difference is that the Hokkadio has a creamier taste but subtle. 

The portions were very filling as I couldn't finish mine. The noodles were ok in my opinion although the other ingredients were superb. The soup/broth was amazing (definitely the centerpiece of the meal), the egg was soft and had a gooey yolk, the two slices of pork belly were cooked to perfection and there was also corn, black fungus, and it was topped off with green onions. As a side, we also got gyoza. I mean, for $4 you get 5 pieces which is quite reasonable but they were mediocre. Nothing special but still yummy. Holy crap, I was stuffed.

Overall, the ramen was great and reasonable priced. The location is very convenient so I'd come again. Perfect for the chilly seasons!"}
{"text":"This has become my new go-to place for Ramen in the Markham area  All their ramen bowls are very good and the price is reasonable.  

The only downside is the limited seating and that there is only 1 waitress doing everything right now.  It's really hard for her to clear dishes, while taking orders, and bring out new orders all at the same time.  As such, the food does take a bit longer to get to you.

Despite this, I usually go during off-peak meal hours because I enjoy their ramen so much."}
{"text":"Koi Sakana had transformed to a Ramen Joint since my first to review and I am glad they are getting much better after revamping their menu to concentrate on Ramen.

No more Lunch Specials but their ramen is quite reasonably priced from $8.50.

Spicy Ramen Level 2 was quite satisfying . This may not be a \"Japanese\" owned ramen restaurant but quality and quantity both decent. Noodle cooked with a good point and the broth was spicy and rich. The most standout experience though was the friendly and attentive service.

I would be back to Koi Sakana when I have some ramen craving up at Richmond Hill. 

Cash Only!"}
{"text":"I love Ramen and this place definitely knows how to satisfy what my tastebuds desire. Not only their food was tasty and delicious but our server was very kind and welcoming."}
{"text":"A fantastic Ramen restaurant.  The broth was not too salty like most Ramen places.  The hokiddo Ramen I had was very milky and tasty.  I highly recommend coming here if you're looking for a good Raman place in Toronto."}
{"text":"Not authentic ramen. Nice staff. Food pretty good but will not return - there are better options close by."}
{"text":"I have no ideas why this place has such high rated reviews. First of all, it is not even ramen. Secondly, the soup base was very disappointing. I am not saying the food is awful. It is just very average noodle. 

If you live nearby and are just looking for noodle, yes this place is convenient. But, if you are looking for Japanese Ramen, you will be very disappointed. I should've known by looking at the menu that people posted. 

The one star is for the very friendly and attentive waitress."}
{"text":"I honestly wish I took pictures of my food before I ate it but as I explained to the friend I dined with at this place today, I'm usually too excited and hungry to remember to do that. 

I'll start by saying that my friend and I arrived before 11:30AM which is actually when they open. As soon as the open side turned on, we went in. The service there was pretty good in the sense that we never had to ask for more water and plates were provided for us by the waitress when she sensed that we would be sharing food. Our waitress also smiled quite a bit at us when she served us which is always a nice touch! 

The food itself was delicious. My friend and I had both ordered the House Tonkatsu Ramen as you can't go wrong doing that. We also ordered the Miso Ox Tongue to share which was a great choice considering how tender the meat was and how tasty it ended up being. Perhaps I just have a small stomach but the portion of the ramen for me was very filling. I found myself struggling to help my friend eat my half of the ox tongue because of how full I was after finishing the ramen. This ultimately meant that the price for which I paid was very much worth the food and service I traded it for. All in all, a great experience!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars.

I decided to try Koi Sakana after finding it in my list of Yelp bookmarks. Koi Sakana is tucked away in the corner of an outdoor plaza, so it's difficult o find, but there's plenty of outdoor parking. When I walked in around 1:30pm, the restaurant was packed and there were 2 groups ahead of me with only one server. Kudos to the server for keeping up! I didn't have to wait too long, maybe 5-10 minutes max.

The menu was fairly extensive and there were pictures for each item. I thought it was amusing that some of the items had the exact same photo, the only difference was in the description one of the had a saltier broth than the other. I wasn't in the mood for spicy ramen today, so I decided to order the House Tonkatsu Ramen and a gyoza as an appetizer. The menu has the wifi password (their phone number) on the front, so I just browsed Yelp while waiting for the dishes to arrive -- it helped pass the time.

The gyoza were amazingly good. The skin tasted light, soft, and felt like it was distinctly separate from the pork inside. I had to examine them to see if they were completely sealed and they were! The pork inside was well-seasoned. Eating the gyoza was very satisfying. The ramen was just okay. The noodles were the right level of done-ness. However, the egg was slightly overcooked at the edges of the yolk. The broth and the pork could have used a little more seasoning. The broth was nice and light.

They have a debit card machine now, so you don't need to bring cash.

Koi Sakana is a very promising ramen restaurant. However, there will soon be more competition for ramen nearby as I just saw a Kinton location opening up at Commerce Gate."}
{"text":"As a ramen addict, I finally decided to try out this place since their rating on Yelp seems promising. 

Ordered the house tonkotsu ramen and to summarize the quality and service I have scored each out of 10.

Service: 10 ( friendly and fast)
Ramen: 8 
Pork: 7.5 ( thick and tender)
Egg: 7.5 ( not too shabby)

Overall I actually enjoyed this place more than Sansotei on hwy 7."}
{"text":"It's a small little restaurant that serves mainly ramen noodles. Please note they only take cash or debit. No credit card.
Appetizers were just okay, a little disappointed. We had gyoza (small portion and a little burnt),  pork cutlet (decent portion and standard; I would get it again), squid balls (forgot the actual name, it tatses very \"processed\" and very small portion; I wouldn't recommend this). 

Spicy ramen with little dried shrimps in the broth. You can customize the spiciness level (1, 2, 3). Broth was flavourful but I wish it was hotter (temperature hot i mean). 
My friend had Tonkotsu ramen; she thought it was decent, nothing to rave about though. Overall, Ramen noodle soups are average to good. 
My hubby had pork cutlet curry on rice, large portion. Hubby enjoyed it. 

Overall, average to good ramen noodles, friendly service. I would return if I'm craving ramen noodles and happen to be in the area."}
{"text":"Maybe it's the seasons changing, but I've been on one heck of a ramen binge. Koi Sakana is the closet ramen location from where I live so it's not only a miracle that I can get ramen outside of Toronto, but also that it's delicious. Their gyoza are flavourful, with each ingredient being a distinguishable medley of flavours. The ramen packs a lot of flavour, the broth rich and complex indicating the amount of time that went into making it. Kudos to the waitress/cashier/who I think is also the owner: she really busts her ass off and always greets us with a smile. She's extremely attentive and not afraid to offer suggestions and substitutions if you're uncertain about a topping. (I always swap out the baby shrimp in the spicy ramen for wakame.) 

Note: If you have the opportunity, try the jelly sake! It's a nice treat."}
{"text":"Small ramen shop that is a little hidden from the main area and traffic. If you are trying to spot it off the street you will not see it. The staff (only 1 serving) was pretty friendly. The menu was a little disappointing as someone has also mentioned that a lot of the items were crossed out. 

I have ordered the House tonkotsu ramen which was a little less salty. The flavour was ok nothing too impressive but it did taste a little different than what I am used to. The egg was a soft boiled egg rather than a traditional Japanese pickled egg. The price was decent, most ramen were between the $9-11 range so it wasn't  overpriced like the other bigger places. 

Would I come back? Maybe, definitely it is not like your typical ramen chain."}
{"text":"2nd time trying Koi Salamanca Ramen House. I've ordered tonkatsu ramen and my boy friend ordered vegetarian tonkatsu ramen.  ramen portions are pretty generous and they came with 2 thick pieces of Pork belly but it has a weird taste to it. soup base is saltier than the house tonkatsu ramen but it's just right for me. The egg is a bit over cooked so the yolk is not runny anymore and it's cold."}
{"text":"I debated against whether to give this place a rating of 3 or 4, but 3 seems a little unfair given that food delivered, and the only thing that bugged me was the fact that I couldn't drink/enjoy my spicy ramen soup. I think I'll go for level 1 next time. 

Service was great despite being on a Friday dinner rush evening; the lady tending to us was patient and friendly, polite, and all smiles. She made sure to check up on us from time to time for tea refills and there was no need to flag her down for service whenever we needed something. 

I'd definitely come back, it's a nice little ramen shop, small space-wise, but good food. Definitely warrants a second visit."}
{"text":"Koi Sakana is not a traditional Raman place but still offers a decent variety of broths and flavours for any Raman lover. They have many types ranging from your shoyu (sea salt) base to a spicy fatty soup base and everything in between. They even have a vegetarian ramen as well!

We got the takoyaki to start (fried octopus balls). We also got the traditional shoyu (soy) ramen and I got the spicy level 3 ramen. Overall the ramen was nothing spectacular but was nice on the cold winter night. The spicy ramen packs a punch from.a heat perspective but lacks everywhere else in terms of flavours. The pork belly was ok, the dried shrimps was a nice touch. But again, nothing special. 

I would probably not go back again since kinton ramen is just around the corner."}
