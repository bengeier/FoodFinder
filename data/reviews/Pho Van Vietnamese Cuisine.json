{"text":"I was here last night for a bowl of Pho.  Its was the best Pho I had in a long time.  my friend had the Banh Xeo, wow it looks so delicious.  This restaurant is very closed to Lee Lee, very convenient if you want to do some grocery shopping.  Service was fast but the banh xeo was a little bit slow.  The owner explained that it takes 10 to 12 minutes to make it.  My friend loves it i will have to try it next time.  friendly staff."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years and I can't believe I never done a review. Anyways this is my go to Pho place. The service is speedy fast (almost too fast) and the pho will help you with what's ailing you. You must get the egg roll, it's soooo good. I want to try other things but I can't cause I gotta pho (it's that good)."}
{"text":"The 2 stars are for the quality of food. My wife and I love to eat here and will miss the cuisine. In all honesty, the food rates 4 stars.

The service however, or continued lack of service rather, has gauranteed you have lost us forever. Just an FYI to the owner, the extreme friendly nature maintained by your staff as they continually fail miserably, doesn't make it any easier to swallow. We live 1/2 a mile away, your competitors now get our money."}
{"text":"The food is ok, but I could not believe how rude the staff were. I went here tonight with my girlfriend, who previously had a horrible experience at this restaurant, but decided to give it a second chance since we were both hungry.

We got minimal levels of service, and no one was coming by to check on us, so my girlfriend went to find someone to ask if we could get the bill. Instead of saying they would bring it out to us, the waitress told her that they were busy, and told my girlfriend to go check on some other customers to see if they needed water as if she was an employee and not a customer. She then spent 5 minutes saying how pretty my girlfriend is and that she had a son who she'd like to introduce to her so they could go on a date, even though she KNEW we were a couple since she was the one who took out orders previously.

Flustered, my girlfriend signed the receipt but forgot to write anything in the tip section. Then the same waitress told us \"Obviously we gave you bad service because you didn't tip. That's how we know.\" 

Not leaving a tip was an honest mistake, but after comment I'm glad we didn't. Especially after we barely got any table service, got told to do the waitress' job for her, and had her try to hook my girlfriend up with someone else.

Go to Pho Saigon instead. They have better food and the staff are actually professional."}
{"text":"I am usually happy with their pho, unlit I go back to OC see what its really suppose to taste like. Everything I've tried here has been good with good portion sizes. My only qualm, which is the same for many other pho places in the area, it the lack of chicken pho broth for the pho ga, its always beef based. Also, I've noticed that every time i come here for chicken pho in the morning, the broth is not fully cooked and is a bit oily, which is why I've made the switch to vermicelli bowls during these times."}
{"text":"slowest, worst service.  noodles all stuck together in a lump at the bottom of the bowl.  spring rolls were made before we got there which led to the wrapper being chewy, hard and stiff.  broth too sweet and we feel sick after eating there.  i have had way better pho."}
{"text":"I am very regretted to come to this place again. I wasted $9.00 on nothing. I never want to eat here but i decided to give them another try. The price is way over expensive. I just spend $9.00 for an order of rice, couple slices of meat, 1 thin slice of cucumber, 2 thin slices of carrot, and one slice of salad (com thit). The thing is i am still hungry :( and i am making a bowl of noodle at home right now to satisfy my hunger :(. This is my first review and it is a bad one too. :( For me, this is a no no place. I won't make the same mistake again."}
{"text":"The pho is amazing! The portion size is also larger than a lot of other places so that was a huge plus as well. Wish this place was closer to my house because I would be there very often."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time and the food was really good. They had a decent size menu, a little smaller than the menus I have seen at other pho restaurants. I had the 55. which is a spicy beef soup with options for pork knuckles and blood, really good (had the normal beef). My boyfriend had the 10. which is brisket, beef, and tripe soup, he also thought it was good. The waiter we had was a very nice and helpful young man. Great feel while in the restaurant too. The only downfall in our opinion was that the chili paste was not very spicy at all."}
{"text":"Literally the best pho I have EVER had! The broth is so savory and complex, and as everyone knows it's the broth that makes the dish. The service is also very friendly and fast, typically our food takes no longer than 15 minutes come out. I get the #12 and my boyfriend gets the #23, which has shrimp and quail eggs! We have tried at least 10 different pho restaurants and this one is by far the best!"}
{"text":"Went w/ the hubby today & we both LOVED what we ordered. If you're Vietnamese, you'll like this place for serving authentic Vietnamese food w/o watering down anything. He ordered the bun bo hue & I had the bo kho. Both dishes rocked!!! Friendly staff, clean, good prices. We'll definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"I am from out of town and wanted a bowl of Pho.  I love the pho here it was so flavorful. and the spring rolls were very fresh.  It was a very busy time so the service was a little slow but it's understandable.  I saw a dish call banh xeo from another table it looked so appealing but I was so full.  The staff was friendly, I will come back.  They deserve a 5 stars."}
{"text":"I had never had Vietnamese food before, always thought it was some soup type stuff. A friend at work talked me into trying it and I'm glad I did! I ordered the #41 BBQ pork with grilled shrimp rice plate. The BBQ pork was delicious great flavor, the shrimp was a little though and lacking flavor but the plum sauce made up for it. I would definitely eat here again. We ordered the food togo and the service was great!"}
{"text":"The spring rolls (or whatever they called them) are STILL haunting me, 2 weeks later.  WONDERFUL!!!!!  Crunchy inside with just the right blend of herbs and 'stuffings'.   Beautiful to look at and divine to eat."}
{"text":"Excellent meatball pho.  Prices are higher than other Vietnamese restaurants ($7-8 for a big bowl of pho) but the interior is very nice and service is good."}
{"text":"1st ... Time here and loved it ... Wonderful fresh Veggies .!!! Just lovely ..Very nice & clean  .. We will be back 4 Sure....!!!!"}
{"text":"With so many options in the Little Saigon that is west Chandler (or Chanoi) this place really needs to up their game.  

For me, the measure of good pho is the broth BEFORE you add the Sriracha and chili paste and lime.  Can it stand on its own?  Unfortunately, at Pho Van it cannot.

While I have not had BAD experiences here, the competition is definitely beating out Pho Van on execution.

The multiple (3 or 4) giant flat screens playing everything from ESPN to FOX or Bravo in addition to the piped-in Muzak lends itself to over-stimulation and much distraction.

What's more, the wait staff never seems to quite know what's available or what comes in certain dishes.  There is a lot of, \"Um...let me check!\" then they dash away.

Really wanted to make this our go-to for pho since it's within a mile of our new digs, but I'll make the drive to one of the many other options."}
{"text":"Overall this place is pretty good. 
I have a severe fish allergy and they found me something I could eat. (Score!)
My boyfriend got the marinated pork which he loved. I got a stew of some sort, with all kinds of yummy tripe, beef, insert random beef product.

The ice tea was delicious, and the people were friendly. Nicely done.
I will likely stick to my typical Pho place but it is on my list!"}
{"text":"I've been under the weather the past few days and it was suggested to try the Pho GÃ  (Chicken Soup); I was told it would \"Bring me Back\". The items came neatly packaged allowing me to add as much veggies, noodles and extras as I wanted to my broth. The combo was very flavorful. There was enough for me to eat for dinner last night and lunch today. My children are bringing more home now. This is my first time trying Vietnamese cuisine. There are definitely a few other items on their menu I'd like to try. I'd go back"}
{"text":"If it was an option to give negative stars I would. It was my first time here. Food was ok. The server brought our check and asked for us to pay when we were ready at the register. We weren't even half way done. An older lady came and literally got my plate and took it away. I clearly told her various times that I wasn't done and said we have to go and made the whatever gesture to my friend and I. She didn't even excuse herself. Was very rude. I have NEVER experienced such horrible service. It will for sure be our last time here. No customer service skills at all. There was another table there also and they weren't even bothered at all. They stayed there eating. I personally felt discriminated. All I wanted was a good hot soup for the chilly night."}
{"text":"I'm a Bay Area transplant and have been looking for good Pho. I researched Yelp for months reading 100's of reviews. My fav is bun bo hue. This was the best I have ever had! The broth was full of flavor and it was loaded. I don't think I'll be going anywhere else but here for pho. =)"}
{"text":"I loved every part of my meal. The ambience is great. They have a beautiful fish tank, music isn't too loud, and TVs are on the back wall.
 The waitstaff were friendly and efficient. My avocado smoothie was amazing; one of the best I have had in a long time. My pho was great. I love that the chicken pho was made with chicken broth and not beef broth!"}
{"text":"This is one of the worst restaurants to visit if you require remedial to no customer service. They were very rude/didn't respond to any of my requests and wouldn't provide any extras as in basil, lime etc if I could rate -1 I would."}
{"text":"Ever since I moved here from the OC (where I've been super spoiled when it comes to good Pho)...I've been on an unsuccessful quest to find good Pho.  Pho is not something I want to eat on a regular basis...but there are days when I just want a good bowl of Pho and it's frustrating when I have to drive around and settle for something mediocre.

I wanted to come here about a month back but they were closed on the day I wanted to come (again, I was having some Pho craving issues).  But today was my lucky day because all the stars lined up and here we are at Pho Van!  Walking in, the restaurant felt really open, clean and inviting.  The people running the place were friendly and attentive.  I did notice prices were a little on the high side for a Pho joint.

We got the Pho Dac Biet and found the broth steaming hot and perfectly seasoned.  There was plenty of noodles and ample amount of meat w/a nice dish of very fresh herbs & veggies.  The only thing I wasn't thrilled w/was the obvious lack of tripe (which was my favorite thing in the Pho)...I didn't really find any and I had to read the menu again to be sure that it was included as part of the description.  The second thing I wasn't impressed w/was the beef/meatballs...they were kinda on the hard & dense side and wasn't plump & juicy.

We also got the house special Bun Rieu...and again, the broth was steaming hot and perfectly seasoned and tasty.  I was also pleasantly surprised to see escargot (which I love) in it...even if it was on the chewy side (lucky for me, I'm okay w/my escargots being chewy...although the boyfriend didn't care for them that way).  One thing that prevented this bowl from getting 5 stars is the shrimp cakes/dumplings in this noodle (which is suppose to be the highlight of the meal) was completely lacking in shrimps...it was disappointingly made up mostly of ground pork w/just a hint of shrimp.

Maybe I'm just being really particular because I've searched and waited so long for a restaurant w/this much promise to come along.  Overall, the food was really good and I would def go back and I do highly recommend this place to friends and family."}
{"text":"This place is overpriced.  I have went to Nhat Pho, Pho Nhat, and Pho Ao Sen, so I have been around the pho block.  I don't believe this place is worth the money.  For the $7 I paid at those other places for a bowl of pho and spring rolls, I paid almost $11 here.  This is not acceptable to me since the food isn't any better.  I just wasn't impressed."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed it.   Went on a Monday lunchtime.  It was almost full.
Staff, super friendly and charming.
Decor, very cool.  
Service, excellent
Food, great!  Spring rolls had lots of shrimp and pork.  We ordered a brisket Pho but we wanted vegetables so they added them.  The broth was delicious, the meat was good and the veggies were cooked to perfection with some crunch and there was plenty of them!
We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Terrible service! We've been here twice and not once have they got our order correct. We figured the first time it was just a mistake, however the second time the owner himself took our order and it still came out wrong. When they screw up they don't resolve the issue but forget about you afterward, so you never get your food. We had to get up and complain after waiting 45min to get the owner to bring us our order. We will NEVER return. Try Pho 68 right next door instead."}
{"text":"This was the first time I've ever had Vietnamese food, the lady that was serving us was so nice and informative on how to eat my food and what to do with the toppings of the pho noodles. I do see myself coming back here again! It was tasty and a great experience. Even my two year old loved it! I recommend the crispy egg rolls. I only gave 4 stars because I have nothing to compare it to lol but I'm thinking it was more on the authentic side. Everything tastes so fresh and they used a lot of fresh herbs like mint, Basil and cilantro. That's always a plus."}
{"text":"Wen was the last time you had a nice bowl of pho?  This place makes great noodles and other Vietnamese food.  So this place is a good place to check out.  It has a nice dining area and cold beer.  The bad thing was all the hispanic music blasting from the kitchen.  But the sweet little ol' lady who was picking fresh mint was a joy to talk to.  I would go again if I was in the area."}
{"text":"The pho I'd very good. I ordered extra tendon and got a good amount extra. The spring rolls were excellent. Their chili sauce is nice and spicy but not insane. The Vietnamese coffee is a must try for any coffee lover. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"I love this place.   Great food and great service.  Linda C who commented below was one of the rudest customers I've ever seen.  This place bent over backwards trying to deal with her screaming kid and ridiculous requests.  Instead of acting like an adult and discussing her issues she yelled at them in front of everyone. She then sat in her car and stopped some customers from coming in by telling them her ridiculous story.   Despite her behaviour the owner kept his cool, was polite and even wished her a nice evening as she left.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"They don't have soy sauce here. At all. You read that correctly. An Asian restaurant that doesn't have soy sauce.

It's not that they ran out. They just simply don't have it.

Their fried rice is dry and bland. Would definitely be better with SOY SAUCE!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. No serves at all, and the old lady cashier asked tips for no serves. If you gave the tips less than 15%, she will just rolling her eyes on you and complain. I have to say the tips is that you earned for, not just sit there and wait."}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp after the regular place I get take out was closed. Got the sirloin pho and lemon grass chicken. Called in my order from the car and it Was ready in about 10 min. Both were very good. I'll definitely be going back"}
{"text":"I love this place , Tim always makes Chaz and I welcomed. We haven't done the karaoke yet but that's on my to do list as well as his crayfish boil. The cuisine is always amazing."}
{"text":"Wonderful friendly service.  We brought our 4 month old baby and they were very kind to her. Love love love the BBQ pork. I may have taken too much from my wife's plate.  I ordered the pho, which was very good as well.   But next time, I'm getting number 36 for the BBQ pork, the shrimp and other goodies!"}
{"text":"This place is very good!  Great atmosphere and the Pho was very good.  I see there also serving crawfish and beer, so I will have to return to try them out.  Overall, great place and I will be returning for more!"}
{"text":"Great bun rieu!  Great pho!  Excellent service.  Very cool fish tank.  Overall one of the best Vietnamese restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"I came to Pho Van's about 4 years ago.  I've been coming back ever since.  The most attractive issue for me when I first came to Pho Van's... was the number of asian people eating there!  Hummmm.  Says something about the food!   I've invited my family and friends many times.  The best thing I love to do is to get a bunch of different dishes - seafood  noodles, spring rolls, Pho Ga, that \"nest\" thing, and a bunch of other dishes and share them with everyone. All the flavors just make my mouth dance.  Heck yea I recommend it... my mouth is watering now as I type this.... Ok, I'm heading to Pho Van's!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I finally ordered pho ga from here and it was decent. I would come back.

I really like that they give you the whole young coconut when you order the coconut juice! I haven't had that in forever! So extra star for that!"}
{"text":"Good customer service, our waiter was very attentive. Food tasted ok but, Pricey!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is clean.  Service is good.  But their broth is never consistent. Some nights the broth is really flavorful,  other nights it's on the bland side.  I've eaten here when the other pho restaurant is closed.  My husband agrees.  Their rice dishes are really good."}
{"text":"Most heart-warming staff in the restaurant industry and delicious food. There's a lot of pho restaurants on this side of town, but this is the best!"}
{"text":"My family has gone to Pho Van THREE times, and each time was a horrible experience. The first time, we entered the restaurant, were seated and ignored for more than half an hour. We weren't even given menus or offered water.. We walked out angry and hungry to nobody's notice. The second time we went, the food was tolerable but we were charged an extra two dishes. The third time there, the service was great although the dishes were really dirty. We were brought veggies to accompany our pho, and to our shock, there was a stem of greens, PER plate. We asked for more and we were charged three dollars for another two crumpled stems. The pho broth was salty. The bo luc lac was not cooked completely. The fried rice was salty. Once again, we were charged for an extra pho and com dac biet (which costed $15). We've given this restaurant plenty of chances, but we are definitely sure that we will never ever come back here again. For those regular customers, CHECK YOUR BILLS."}
{"text":"This place has the worst service I have ever experienced. First we where seated but not greeted for 10 min. When we finally were greeted it was by the manager who turned out to be extremly rude by saying we were high mateince beacuse we asked for lemon in our water. The food took forever and everyone's meal came at different times. One of the young ladies who was with us has special needs and didn't like her food due to the manger making what he thought she would like. When all she wanted was rice and chicken. He decided to spice it up with things she couldn't eat. We called for our server who was the manager remember. So then the manager told me that he couldn't replace the meal that she didn't like. He continued to tell me that he cant keep making me food if she's not going to like what they make. After him being so rude and telling us he won't make anymore food, we finally left."}
{"text":"Omg, It might be the last time I go there. The service s getting worse and worse. I dunt know y i dont see the two nice and cute waitresses anymore. And now they hire an old and unprofessional lady who didnt know how to serve customers. She doesnt know the menu, the food.. So what the hell she does in the restaurant.. The service took forever.. And I know its personal, but she should dress nice to show her respect to customers. That old lady dress like she just got out of her bed... Excuse me, and from all of that, you expect me to tip a lot when Im unhappy about the service? Hella no. You were lucky that I still left some tip. And the most awful thing was she look at the tip and showed her attitude... Should she have to ask herself about her service instead of expecting the good amount of tips? What a terrible service. Wont never come back again."}
{"text":"As the weather gets cooler in Arizona there is no better meal than a little Pho (pronounced fuh). Pho Van was very quick to seat us, the staff was amazing in taking our order and explaining the various dishes and the food came out lighting fast! The decor was very nice and the entire restaurant was spotless making it a comfortable situation to really sit and enjoy conversation with our meal.

I sprung for the beef round and brisket pho, chicken noodle pho (for the kiddo), the regular beef round (for the lady) and some spring rolls. All four items were amazingly fresh and flavorful. The food alone makes this one of my all time favorite Pho restaurants in the valley. The cherry on top was when the owner came out to ask us our thoughts and ensure that we loved everything he had cooked for us. Kudos good sir - because you now made all three of us patrons for a long, long time.

I think it's almost important to mention that this was one of the first places that actually offered children's dishes at a slightly reduced rate (about a buck less). Plates and appetizers averaged a cost about $6"}
{"text":"New to the area and found the owner to be warm and hospitable.  He gave us suggestions and we thought the food was excellent and priced right.  
We will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"All I can say is if you ever give this a 1 star or lower your dumb as s***. If you b**** about the service that's not their fault that's the servers so leave the store out of it be mad at the server when I was there I had amazing service no problems the meals come out looking like five star meals professional chef style for a very nice low price the remodels are looking amazing looking better each time I go in this restaurant deserves a five-star especially for striving for better each and every time I will definitely be back hopefully they start a frequent flyer mile card"}
{"text":"I love pho. Therefore, I'm a harsh critique when it comes to pho but this place is one of my go tos for it.

Wonton Egg Noodles
GOOD

Pho Tai broth
GOOD every time so far! well except once but that was 30mins before they were closing so I don't blame them.

Pho Noodles
Good, not too soft and not all mashed up

Leche Drink
GOOD

Coconut drink
GOOD

Fried Tofu
EH

Eggrolls
From past experience I will never give egg rolls here a second chance unless someone else pays for them

Price
EH, I've had good pho for lower price"}
{"text":"I did not read any of the reviews before eating here and I am glad I didn't, because I probably would not have done so.

That said, I actually did enjoy my meal and service. It was nothing overwhelming or earth-shattering. Rather, it was just about what I would expect, sans a few social faux pas. Only the beginning had me a bit off-set, as I waited by the door and was given a few looks, until one person smiled and asked me, \"One?\" I nodded and they directed me to a table. Someone came up with a menu, but did not ask me about a drink (at that time).

As a former server, it is a bit unsettling to experience a place that seems to neglect something that I would consider commonplace. Either way, I was not thirsty enough to say something, but in the future, Pho Van may want to take note of this. Also, that greeting the guest at the door, not from behind the counter, is far more gracious and welcoming.

I was ready to order, and had to wait a bit. Not too sure why, as it wasn't terribly busy, but my back was to the kitchen so I had no idea if they were short staffed or not. Eventually, a shorter lady comes up and takes my order. I smile, she smiled... Cool. I don't ask for much, but service with a smile can make a big difference.

I ordered an appetizer and Pho Ga; also, a water (it came with lemon). Again, with my background, one would think an appetizer would come first. This was not the case, as I was bombarded with both plates in one fell swoop. Now, this is not necessarily a bad thing, since I have traveled abroad and in other countries, this is acceptable and expected. I have experienced this at a number of ethnic restaurants all across America. So, for me it was no surprise, but a bit frustrating, as my Pho Ga cooled a bit more than I wanted.

Finally, and this is the part where they earned the Four Stars: as I am enjoying my Pho Ga, a gentleman comes up (the same one who directed me to the table) and asked me how everything was going. I said, \"Good, but it could be a bit hotter\". He then proceeds to go out of his way, heads back to the kitchen, then returns with two [fresh] red chili peppers!!! I was quite impressed!

He cut them then crushed them in my bowl... Perfect! Flavor was phenomenal, and it made the meal wonderful! Later, he did come back with Dave's Insanity Sauce, where I mentioned how I don't like the way it overtakes the meal. He agreed and we chatted for a few minutes. The second half of my experience really made it worth it.

As for the other reviews I had read... I cannot say I had the same experience, maybe they are trying to turn a new leaf. Best to them, and I will return (I live right down the road ^,^)"}
{"text":"Their Bun didn't impress me too much. Feel sodium was a little bit too much in the grilled pork."}
{"text":"Excellent!  Had the Pho with beef round and brisket.  The broth was flavorful and the service was excellent.

The staff was friendly and made me feel welcome.

I will return and recommend Pho Van."}
{"text":"I met a friend w/ her kids for lunch here and order the pho w/ tripe and beef. We also got the egg rolls and spring rolls. The spring rolls and pho were tasty but I'd pass on the egg rolls. You can't go wrong by ordering the Thai iced tea. It was delicious."}
{"text":"So far the best pho Ive had in the valley. The broth is on point, tons of noodles & meat, and a great amount of \"fixings\". Got a strawberry smoothie here and it was very good, however they do not have boba, all though it says so on the menu.

The service is suspect, but I feel like thats how every vietnamese restaurant is. I brought a buddy here for his first pho experience and he is hooked now. Id totally recommend this place to all pho lovers."}
{"text":"The two stars are for the food and facility. The service here is atrocious.

I had the #13, the beef and meatballs. The pho was tasty, worthy of 3-4 stars in its category.

The room is contemporary, clean, and has colorful distractions like TVs and an aquarium.

The bad part of the place is the service. As I type this, I'm still fuming over how poor this experience was. It took a little bit longer than usual to get seated, but I will let that pass.

There are no drinks listed on the menu, and the order taking is for everything at once. The server was very much to the point with not even a greeting spared for us. I ordered my entree and a Diet Pepsi. We got two waters brought to us. I am content to wait until the meal comes to say something about this, thinking that my soda might come with the pho. 

My friend and I get our meals separately, which is unusual, but it gives the pho time to cool. That was the last time anyone came by our table except near the end of the meal, when they asked if we needed a water refill. 

I saw no indication that you are supposed to pay at the counter, so I flag down a server and ask for the bill after 5-10 minutes of both of us being done with our food. The bill has a soda charge on it, so we go to the counter to fix it. My friend notices a sign at the counter that says you need to pay at the counter. I did not see this at all, as I was just focused on getting out of there. This sign does no good if you have to already be at the back of the restaurant to see it. Places like IHOP and other diners have their cash registers at the front, so it's more obvious what you need to do.

Not once did I feel like anyone cared if I enjoyed myself or my food. Just having good food is not enough. There has to be communication with the diners, and the logistics and financial process have to be at a minimum standard level.

Besides the staff getting some retraining, I would suggest a sign at the front that says, \"Please wait to be seated. Please pay at the back counter.\" That would have gone a long way toward making the experience less aggravating."}
{"text":"Since the change of ownership, the food is only OK.  So it wasn't ever on my go to list for pho, but after a long day and returning from a biz trip... this is the closest pho joint to my home.

The owner (I assume based on previous experience) sat me down w/ a menu.. and there I sat.. sat ... sat.. and finally the owner goes out w/ a buddy to drink a beer and has to walk by me.. as I continued to sit (first table by the entrance).  At the 10min mark, I gave up and returned the menu to the bar area.  As I walked outside, the owner was like \"Are you done already?\".  Obviously not, you sat me 10 min ago.. so I found that question pretty condescending.  I told him I didn't receive any service after 10 min, and to his credit, he apologized.

So 2 stars for the ho-hum food, 1 star overall for poor service = erasing knowledge of the existance of this restaurant.  FAIL.

ORIGINAL 10/28/2010 (4 star):
I come here occasionally, which means the food is tasty enough.  My personal consensus is the pricing is higher than what I'd generally pay to get a no-soup vermicelli fix (their bowls are huge, yum #20)... This place is good for taking newbies (the atmosphere and decor is modern and inviting) and folks who are judgemental about divey looking joints."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I wanted to try to find a Pho place near our  house and thought this was a great place our first experience. We thought the food was great! Then the last time we went, we kind of had a bad experience. We got there at 8:00PM and they closed at 8:30 (which we didn't realize). We were waiting for a friend to join us and the guy working there was kind of impatient and told us that we needed to hurry and order since they were closing soon. We ended up leaving and the other waitress was kind enough to tell us that there are other people eating so we should stay. It was very kind of her to let us know it was okay for us to stay, but the other guy definitely made us feel unwelcome. We will probably go back and try it out again."}
{"text":"Pho Van is my go-to place for Vietnamese in the Chandler / GIlbert area hands down.

Why?

Well for starters, the food is great, the staff is friendly (but also busy), and the restaurant is very clean and modern.  

The latter may not be important for flavor, but it definitely adds to the dining appeal, especially if you are bringing friends along to introduce to Vietnamese who are inexperienced with the cuisine.

That 'introduction' aspect is a huge plus - very often when dining with more than yourself you get stuck eating at really lame, boring chain joints in order to satisfy the chalky, boring tastes or diet of somebody in your group.  It isn't their fault.  They were raised in America.  Most of us had chalky, boring diets at one point or another.

I have found it is much easier to ease frightened or intimidated eaters into a new cuisine with a restaurant that looks, smells, and feels comfortable and clean to them.

I dig me a hole in the wall Vietnamese place as much as anyone, but you get a little more thoughtful, modern experience at Pho Van without sacrificing flavors or really any dishes.  Everything is very good, especially for the price and ambience.

Most people new to Vietnamese food will leave Pho Van with their minds open and their palates expanded..   That's a beautiful thing!

I usually order Vietnoobs the Goi Cuon, Cha Gio, and Pho Tai to try their first time out.  If they hate soup (silly, but it happens) go for the Bun.   Don't tell them they are eating fish sauce if they are picky until they've started eating and enjoying it.  ;)

The more Vietnamese food fans we help create, the more Vietnamese restaurants will start popping up - and we need them.  There isn't even a pho joint in Gilbert yet - only a Chinese place that serves pho.

{"text":"Excellent.  Very friendly, attentive and professional staff.  I've eaten here for quite some time and  the food and staff have kept up the quality."}
{"text":"fast Service, great food. it's a good lunch place if you don't have too much time, I would definitely come back for a quick delicious Pho. Ps they also have some good Chinese food."}
{"text":"Best pho in the valley.  Not the cheapest but the best and I have eaten pho all over the valley.  I am a Pho addict and love this place. The owner Jimmy is super cool and always talks to my kids when we go.  My kids like the wanton egg noodle soup without the wontons.  It is also bomb."}
{"text":"First visit . First thing disappointed me is I was told 10% discount can't apply to . Reason is restaurant owner is out for beer !!!! What !!!!!! Only owner knows how to give customer 10%discount ?????!!!!!! 

Soup is good . But my to-go didn't come along sprouts and lime and jalapeÃ±o which supposedly should be part of pho ??? Am I their first customer asking to go ?"}
{"text":"We eat here about 3x per month.  Love their beef pho and the #22!  Spring rolls are some of the best we've ever had.  The bathrooms could be a bit cleaner but the food is great and the service is excellent!"}
{"text":"It's been about 5 months since I last came here and it certainly improved a bit. They got rid of that horrible table cloth with butcher paper and service was very prompt. Only complaint is when you order an appetizer it should always come out before your meal comes out. Drinks are still pricier than your average starbucks, but other than that the food is still flavorful as always."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and returned for dinner this Friday.

The place is clean and the staff is very friendly and fast.  They have a great aquarium as well.

Last night I had the crepe app and the vermicelli with hanoi style sausage.  My wife had the curry.  As it always is, the food was excellent and the portions were very generous.  I usually have the pho and it is always great.

In this particular area around Lee Lee's there are tons of pho places, this is my favorite.  One negative comment, they should be more mindful of what is playing on the tv.  Whatever was on, it involved someone in the back seat of a car having his teeth pulled with pliers.  There was a LOT of blood.  The lady at the table next to me looked like she was going to faint.  In my opinion be safe and stick to sports!"}
{"text":"Best Pho in the valley. Its a must try. Very reasonably priced and the ingredients are extremely fresh. Staff is great as well and the restaurant is clean and well kept."}
{"text":"Ok this is another place I like... I think this place is under new management.... Because the atmosphere is a lot different than before. I didn't like the last owner they were not to friendly... Maybe that's why I haven't been back until last week I decide to give this place another try when my friend ask me to join him. He told me the place is much better now!! He is right !!! I love the food there... If they know how to cook \"Bun Bo Hue \" they definitely know what they're doing . My friend order pho special ... He said their pho taste yummy!! This come from a guy that doesn't like soup. The server is very friendly. She check on us all the time making sure we're ok...  I love a place that serve good food especially vietnamese food!!!  and of course good service  too !! If you're in the area stop by and give them a try... Promise you'll love this place .."}
{"text":"The friendliest pho restaurant I have ever been to!!!!  And the pho was great as well.  The cha gao was ok - not homemade like at Maxim in Phoenix.

Eat the pho, pass on the rolls"}
{"text":"This review is based on my experience last year. I came across this and saw all the good reviews and I felt compelled to write this. The food here is disgusting and so is the way it is prepared. Maybe this is an east coast thing but shrimps pass waste (you know a #2). When this happens your not supposed to leave all the poop on the shrimp. Every piece of shrimp served was served in its' own poop and hard as a ROCK. I have never had any seafood dish that was nearly as bad as the one I had here. Its also nasty not to clean out the shrimp. I honestly can't understand how anyone could possibly give this place more than 2 stars. What are you people thinking? BTW I was also served the worst tasting noodles I have ever ordered at ANY Asian establishment. How in earth do any of you give this place good reviews???"}
{"text":"Being so close to my home, I really wanted to love this restaurant. Visited on a quiet weekday night, seated right away and our drink order quickly taken. $5 seems a bit much for a Thai tea, but it was yummy. I had wanted to order one of the noodle dishes, but was told that chef went home. Umm...ok. Both of ordered Pho and egg rolls. Egg rolls were delicious! Pho? Eh. Broth was really bland and needed a lot of help to make it just good. The Pho at unPhogettable is much better.  

Sorry to say, we won't be back."}
{"text":"BBQ pork vermicelli salad was out of this world. The pho smelled delicious - I wished I'd ordered that (it was our first trip there) until I tasted the pork. I can see this going into my takeout rotation for sure."}
{"text":"The service here was absolutely terrible! I will never come back. As we walked in, we did not get acknowledged, we saw alot of angry, irritated faces on the customers but assumed they were all having a bad day. Waited a good 15 mins before someone came to take our order. The table to the right of us sent their order back. The table behind us just got up and left, and the table to the left of us sent their tea back and needed to request utensils. The brought us our food, I had to get my own sauces for my pho, waited 15 mins to get my veggie plate but by that time, my pho was soggy. Disgusting and terrible!  Never again and not even an apology for their sorry service!"}
{"text":"It is okay... Not very authentic but this will do for Chandler. If you order a meat entrÃ©, be prepared that there will be more veggies than the thin-sliced meat."}
{"text":"I have been searching for a good Pho restaurant ever since Saigon Pho in Chandler went down hill.  Pho Van is a very clean, well organized, and well staffed restaurant in the Asian Center that shares space with Lee Lee's and other shops.  

I had the traditional Pho Ga (chicken soup in beef broth) and Goi Cuon (Spring rolls).  Both were very good.  The noodles in the broth were perfectly cooked and had great texture and the chicken was all white meat and very tender.  The veggies that accompany the pho were fresh and crisp.  The Spring Rolls were perfect as well stuff full of healthy green veggies.  

The prices were a little higher than I am used to in a pho place but it was not bad.  They also do not accept AMEX so beware if that is all you use.  

Overall a great place and this is my new Go-To-Pho in the valley."}
{"text":"Just OK... with so much competition in the east valley they need to step up the game a little. The meal was good, however our service was not very good and we waited a long time for the food to come out. I only went here because my usual place is closed for remodel."}
{"text":"I have been back a couple of times lately and the service has been pretty bad. Forgetting garnish with pho, not refilling drinks. The food is still very good but service is a bit of a headache. On one occasion there were teenagers working and they kept switching the music mid song, then asked me what I wanted to hear. Just very silly. I will go back but, am actively looking for another place. Hopefully service improves."}
{"text":"The weather is cooling down, and wearing a long sleeve shirt is about to be the norm. What goes better with cool weather than a hot bowl of soup? A hot bowl of Pho with meatballs and brisket from this place! This was the best Pho that I've had in Arizona; the broth is flavorful, meat cooked to perfection, vegetables fresh and green. The staff was incredibly friendly, offering small cups of soup as a sample, and even offering my girlfriend the opportunity to change her order if it was not to her liking. (She was a bit braver than I and got a more traditional Vietnamese bowl, which she LOVED) The restaurant was clean, bathrooms were nice, and they even had the UofA football game on the tv! I highly recommend this place over any other Pho restaurant in town. Check it out!"}
{"text":"I've had many items here over the past couple years, and have been overall very happy

When I ordered the Bun Bo Hue, the chef brought it out asked \"You're American and you ordered this?\", smiles, and says \"This is very traditional from Central Vietnam\".  A very rich meaty flavored broth with thick noodles"}
{"text":"Ooh! Another jewel found! I have a usual place for Vietnamese food but they happen to be on vacation. Luckily I came here! And luckily I have a couple Yelp friends' reviews to confirm the tastiness!! 

I was looking for a rice dish and found #41!! The \"lip smackin' good BBQ pork\"! If I could give words to describe the dish it would be those exact ones: lip smackin' good BBQ pork!! Comes with 3 grilled shrimps, a side of pickled veggies and of course the jasmine rice and fish sauce. Drooling for another dish. $8.95

The chicken curry noodle soup is just as delicious with a kick of spice! You can sub the noodles with jasmine rice or toasted bread. Chicken chunks (with bones) and rice noodles, sweet potatoes and bell peppers bathed in the creamy coconut curry soup. Boneless would have been nice. $7.95

The lunch experience was delicious. Prices were a bit higher than what I expected but the decor compensated and the food was lip smackin' good! ;)"}
{"text":"Great food.
The staff is very friendly. 
The service was quick.
The decor and atmosphere is very modern and inviting compared to other Vietnamese restaurants. 
I had tried their Pho Duc biet, Pho Ga, Curry Chicken, spring rolls. All were very tasty. The ingredients used were fresh. I have no complaints about this place what-so-ever. I would recommend anybody and everybody to this place. I would definitely come back whenever I'm in town.  5*'s"}
{"text":"The restaurant itself doesn't look like much but the food is very good.  I also go to this place for Pho a couple times a month.  Haven't had much of the menu other than Pho.

Service is fast and polite, prices are reasonable.  Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"Food was amazing, #41. Service was quick during lunch. Only reason I took off a star is because I could hear mariachi music coming from the kitchen and I was not sitting at the tables near the kitchen."}
{"text":"Great food, great service! I've never been a Vietnamese restaurant as clean as this one. We were seated promptly and our waiter even helped us with our order with recommendations and making slight changes to our items as we requested. We each had an order of spring rolls and a bowl of pho with drinks. The shrimp spring roll was delicious filled with lots and lots of veggies just the way I like it. My brisket pho was absolutely delicious. I don't like rare pho meat so I got the brisket and it was cooked well with the tenderness still intact. The Vietnamese iced coffee also perfect. Never had a coffee quite as good and creamy, even better than the powder packets that so many of my friends swear by. Love it!"}
{"text":"Went there today because the Phoenix Palace next door was closed.  Figured if you can't get dim sum, pho is a good second best.  Asked the server about items on the menu and she just shrugged, saying this was her first week.  Apparently not interested in learning about the food.  Two of us had pho (one seafood, one eye of round and brisket), the third had #32, a bun bowl (I think that's what it's called.)  Also ordered two appetizers:  Vietnamese crepe and grilled pork rolls.  Appetizers came out last, which was a little strange since the grilled pork rolls turned out to be the cold type of spring roll.  Tasty, but they really could have come out earlier.  Not sure how we were supposed to eat the crepe, which came with a mound of lettuce leaves and mint.  In any event probably didn't matter since it didn't have much taste even with the mint and the sauce.  Husband didn't think his #32 had much flavor.  The pho bowls were on the small side but the price was fairly low.  Beef was tough, overdone and had no flavor at all, but the broth was excellent.  Seafood pho rated a 4 out of 5.  I know that you can't expect a lot of love from your server in a restaurant like this, but we got no attention whatsoever and the place was not that busy. No reason to return.  On the plus side the restrooms were roomy and clean."}
{"text":"Lol, here's your precious review, lady.

My dad has the flu. I had a seminar to attend nearby, so I decided to get some Pho for him before I head home since he hadn't eaten all day. I order over the phone thinking this is the place attached to Lee Lee's. I noticed it was this place by Phoenix palace, so whatever. I'll just go get my food.

I saw there was a 10% Yelp check-in offer, so I checked in to use it. The \"owner\" stated I had to write a review first, then come in and use it. I explained it was a check-in offer. No where did it state that, and I showed her on my phone. She then took my phone from my hands and kept it to look at stuff. I politely asked for my phone back, and she rudely said she's not gonna take it. She said I need to do my review at home, and then come in and use the 10% off or else she's just going to lose money by doing this. I asked her how am I to review a restaurant without trying it? And she kept saying I make no sense. SHE MADE NO SENSE! What am I to review? Your website?! LOL.

At this point, I told her forget it. I'm not saving much anyway. She told me she's going to call her managers to figure it out, and I said can you just charge my card so I can go? My dad is at home and sick. I just need my food, so I can go. She told me to wait, and she's going to figure this out. $2.40 isn't worth waiting. She must need it more than I do... all I wanted to do is pay. What is there to ask? She kept emphasizing she's the owner. You trump any manager that YOU hire! If this is the customer service I'm receiving from THE OWNER, don't expect me, or my family, to come back!!! It is very rare where you come across such a horrible, rude owner. You are the reason you'll lose money, not 10% off a meal, honey.

Food was whatever. My family and I will keep going to Saigon --- where service is better, and the food is worth coming back for."}
{"text":"If you are a non-white and non-vietnamese be assured to be treated differently and with less dignity. You will have to wait to be seated since the owners/managers are busy watching TV and talking to their community folks and ignoring you while you wait for a table.

After being seated, the server does not show up for 15 mins and once they do show they do not apologize for the delay. Don't be surprised if you don't get checked upon whether your food came out OK but that the neighboring table seated with their community folks (as mentioned above) get checked upon frequently.

Food was so-so and not great, I have eaten much better and tastier Vietnamese food at either Saigon Nites in Scottsdale or Noodle Ranch on Thomas/Scottsdale. The owners over there know how to treat their customers right unlike this establishment."}
{"text":"New to town and decided to try a couple different pho restaurants. This location had a beautiful interior but don't let that fool you. We got walked in and noticed a group of people lounging on the out side, not too bad...but they were loud and had garbage everywhere. We sat down, we glanced at the menu and knew what we wanted. It took 10-15 mins to get someone to take our order(it was only us and another couple) during that time the group from outside came back in walking around the cash register(apparently employees) and sat down at a large table. 5 min after that, they noticed we hadn't order and went to the back and got someone. Finally got our order in, then about 5 mins later the waiter says the ran out of what I ordered. It's chicken pho, how can you run out? Anyway so we asked if we can have chicken meat with beef broth(not that complex) the waiter did not understand and took 5 mins trying to comprehend it when we gave up and just ordered another type of pho! We finally got our order and asked for soy sauce from another waiter bc the original waiter forgot when we asked....the new waiter brought out a bottle that said soy sauce, it was red vinegar. (I hate vinegar and I poured it in my pho already ) At the end, I had a discount for 20%off due to my employer passport. A new guy laughed and said they don't do that anymore, I showed him the date stamped coupon so he gave us 10%. (Not that it really mattered but we were already ercked by everything) Never going back."}
{"text":"So there I am, visiting someone special and getting my 1rst experience of Arizona and ready to have an awesome weekend... when I'm struck by a crappy cold!!! :,(

I was sweetly asked what I wanted... anything.... and in my miserable state, slumped in a couch with a wad of tissues next to me, I moaned the first thing that came to mind: \"PHO GAAAA!\"

After explaining to him what the hell that was, I got on my phone and turned to Yelp for relief and got it in the form of Pho Van!! :,D We drove here and ordered it to-go. I gotta say, the place is extremely nice and clean (so not like my fave Pho places in Little Saigon in Cali!) and if I hadn't been feeling like poop, I would have dined in. :D 

Now for the food: ... okay, it's not Pho Van's fault that I work in freakin' Little Saigon and so, I'm spoiled when it comes to Vietnamese food. But anywaaaays. The pho was generally good... fair amount of chicken and veggies... nothing else. The broth tasted like BEEF which was a little annoying, cuz if I wanted pho bo, I would have asked for pho bo. The spring rolls were crunchy and refreshing (but definately did not compare to the yummy Brodard rolls). 

All in all, I was satisfied and it did make me feel 1000X better!!! (Thanks, sweetie :D) Not really fair to compare it to the wonders of Little Saigon, after all."}
{"text":"Best pho I ever tasted!  If I have had better pho last 20+ years, I don't remember it!  Redolent with spices and herbs and rich beef flavor, it satisfied as only a steaming bowl of pho can.  The Vietnamese coffee and beef salad were spot on.  The owner came to make suggestions and put together a special meal just for us.  Wish we had bigger stomachs because every dish we saw at other tables and every dish that passed us we wanted to order.  I am a Seattle food snob of the first order and I may have had as good food there but not often, and I guarantee, none better!  If you are fed up with salty, flavorless broth, come here and tell Jimmy you read this review and write one of your own.  On second thought, stay away and tell everyone else the same - they were very busy at lunch.  Want to go back at dinner with a large group and try the bun (boon) and the veggies in the fried noodle bowl and......"}
{"text":"Consistently good food, great staff. Been here countless times and is my fav pho place in arizona. We've made it a tradition to come by about once a week now.

Thank you for the deliciousness!"}
{"text":"This place not only has excellent food but the staff is very friendly. I drove from Anthem because I heard this place was good. I agree. This place is well worth the drive."}
{"text":"We were craving Pho and so we decided to try this place.  It is very clean and the service was really nice.  Would we go back there again? Probably.  But  we definitely will try other places first.

Our #1 Pho place is still Pho Ao Sen

*Price = more than what we were used to in L.A.
*Pho portion = pretty good and there was a lot of meat in it :)
*Rice dish = honestly, the beef tasted more like Teriyaki than Vietnamese bbq.
*Decor = looks clean and bright but Pho Ao Sen is still much prettier and cleaner"}
{"text":"My go-to favorite, pho!  I always get #51 every time but any of their pho is delicious. I love the appetizers too. The sauces and condiments that come with some of the items just add much more flavor. Do try that! The staff have always been nice and every now and then it's service is slow but minor details on that."}
{"text":"Well, I definitely won't be back to this place. I should have read the reviews before coming here. Shame on me! The pho was mediocre. It wasn't horrible, but it was on the sweeter side, and the thin sliced meat was actually a little too thick for pho. The Thai basil I was given was mostly bruised and wilted, but I managed to get a few good pieces. Service was horrible.  After dropping off my soup, the server NEVER returned to my table.  Not to check on me. Not to ask if everything was OK. Not to refill my soda. Not even to drop off my bill! At one point,  I tried to straighten in my seat and when I used the table as leverage,  it leaned and spilled my soup because it was wobbly. I motioned to the server so that I could ask for napkins. She looked right through me. I ate the remainder of my meal with soup all over the table.  She even sat at a table in the dining area and ate her own meal.  That's fine,  but she should have made sure all her customers were taken care of beforehand. I was one of three tables sat in the restaurant. No excuse. A few times she looked at me and saw me literally staring at her. She never got up.  I finally went to the counter and asked another employee for my bill. She was very pleasant,  but I had witnessed her rolling egg rolls in the dining area and touching menus and chairs and helping a couple look through the menu. I never saw her go to wash her hands. Save yourself the irritation.  Go somewhere else.  There are so many other places that have great pho and good service!"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch today. Ordered shrimp fried rice, crispy egg rolls and ice tea. Everything was fresh, hot and flavorful. The main course came long before the \"appetizer\", but I've grown to accept that in Asian restaurants. (When I lived in China, sometimes you would even get the dessert first if that particular chef in the kitchen wasn't backed up.) The tea was refreshing, but I guess you don't get refills. Maybe some water would have gone well with it.
The place is clean, well-lit and quick with the orders. I would definitely go there again."}
{"text":"My co-workers love Pho and highly recommended this place. Our service was great. Our orders were taken right away, the food was delivered quickly and we always had water on our table. 

I ordered the Pho Thai. The broth was aromatic and had great flavor. The portions were huge! I definitely over ate which is a testament of how yummy the food was. 

The gave four stars instead of five for two reasons: 1) I wish they would have told us there was an 18% gratuity charged. I don't mind when it is automatically added to our bill, but I do like to know without having to ask why my check costs more than my meal and tax. 2) I checked in on Yelp and was delighted to see that I received a 10% discount for using Yelp. When I showed our server I was told that this wasn't being honored anymore and they were in communications with Yelp about it. I have to say these two things really make me want to deduct another star, but everything else was wonderful. 

For the food, I recommend this place just know if you had a party more than 4 or 5 you will be charged 18% gratuity"}
{"text":"Having forgotten to make dinner this evening, I needed a quick fix in order to suppress the imminent hunger pangs.

Burger?  Not tonight.
Pizza?  Going to Pomo with friends Monday, so not tonight.
Italian?  Too hot to drink red wine with it, so pass.
Vietnamese?  Why yes, I think that will be good choice.

I check my Yelpy bookmarks, as I know I must have one already in there right?  Right!!!

I call.  I order.  I drive over in two shakes of a tail feather.  I walk in and am greeted by an oh so lovely Vietnamese waitress in the cutest little Daisy Duke shorts.  I drool.  I smile.  I take the yummy smelling food home and delight in the flavors.

Like our former governator used to say.............\"Ahll be baack\".  Hopefully that cute little waitress will be there too ;-)

Good times in the sweltering hot Sonoran desert."}
{"text":"The 2 stars I gave this restaurant is for the food and the food alone. We ordered Banh Xeo and Pho Tai. They were both really good. There, I acknowledged that their food was good. However, that will be the only great thing I have to say in this review.

The service I received was a nightmare. We waited for almost an hour for our food, about 45 mins for the server to even noticed us sitting there with nothing on the table and finally brought us some water. I made eye contacts with the servers quite a few times and somehow he always avoided us instead of coming over and asked if we need anything. The food was brought out 45 mins after we ordered and we had to wait another 15 mins to ask for some utensils. I noticed two tables came in way after we did, got there food and left before our food even came out. So I dont know why our table got such bad service?! 

Will never come back again even though the food was decent. Sorry."}
{"text":"Used to go to Saigon but this place has much better, flavorful broth. 
#2 on my list after Phu Thanh."}
{"text":"My first time at Pho Van in Chandler.  Had a order of the springs rolls and a nice bowl of pho soup.  The restaurant was clean and the service with good.  I would highly recommend this place to others.

I normally visit Saigon Pho in Chandler, however the quality of food has gone down hill lately.  This is now my fav Pho restaurant!"}
{"text":"Just moved here from Newport Beach and was wondering if I could find good Pho here because SoCal has some of the best. Well Jimmy (owner) is from Huntington Beach and he brought great Pho to Az. Thank you Jimmy, it was delicious!"}
{"text":"This is my fav place to get Vietnamese food.  It's always delicious and the manager is a sweet and fun guy.  Pho is always good but they are so much more.  They do karaoke too!"}
{"text":"First time eating at this place. We did a to go order of Pho Thai and the spring rolls. The food was very fresh and the peanut sauce is awesome!!! Finally we found a Pho place to enjoy good food. ^_^"}
{"text":"Fantastic pho, excellent spring rolls, great prices! I have only ever had pho and spring rolls here, but that's enough! If you want the best pho in t g e greater Phoenux area, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Since Spring Roll Factory closed several months ago, we've been thinking about trying to find a replacement that served delicious pork noodle bowls, and Pho Van does exactly that.  We stopped in yesterday for lunch and were greeted and seated right away.  I ordered a Vietnamese coffee and my husband ordered a Tsingtao.

We started with their egg rolls which are nicely done.  Fresh, flavorful ingredients on the inside and fried nice and light so they weren't greasy.  Really enjoyed those.  I had the lemongrass beef noodle bowl and my husband ordered the BBQ pork noodle bowl.

We were both impressed with the flavors of the meat and how tender it was.  The vegetables were nice and fresh too.  I love having a big pile of fresh mint to add to the dish.  The noodles were mostly ok, but a little clumpy.  

His beer was good and cold in a frosty mug, and my coffee was nice as well, but it came in a smallish plastic cup full of ice.  I don't know if I'd order that again at $4.95.  Our server was friendly and helpful until the food was delivered.  Then we never saw her again.  We had to go up front to pay, and maybe that's the way they do it, but we never saw an itemized check or receipt.  We had no issues using the Yelp check-in offer of 10% off the total, but like I said, I have no idea what the itemized list was.

Before tip and after the discount, the total was $32.11.   We saw several other interesting dishes go by our table and I look forward to trying more items on the menu.  I could see stopping in often for takeout on my way home from work."}
{"text":"Pho Van is where I go if I want traditional Vietnamese food.  It is very clean. Nothing flashy.  No fusion dishes or chef specialties, but it is good traditional vietnamese food.  It is also affordable when compared to my  compared to my favorite Vietnamese place, Cyclos.  However, Cyclos is to expensive for me to be a regular.  Therefore I end up at Pho Van most often."}
{"text":"SO MUCH BETTER THAN PHO 68! I've been going to Pho 68 since it opened, but Pho Van blows it out of the water. Service was great, but slightly slower than what I'm used to. Decorations were beautiful, and most importantly - the food was delicious. I liked that the menu has kid sizes, that was super cute. The owner is very friendly and nice, I'll definitely be back when I'm in Arizona again."}
{"text":"Very good place. Comfortable space and great food. Servers are friendly and options are diverse. Would recommend if you are looking for Pho."}
{"text":"The best Vietnamese food I have had! The spring rolls and egg rolls are a must and the pho is delicious. The service was great too!"}
{"text":"By far the best pho in town.  I think we've actually gone like 3 times in one week!  The place is so clean and the staff is so friendly.  We've tried several different things everytime we've gone (along with our pho of course) and I don't think we've had anything we were disappointed with."}
{"text":"Phenomenon! After resisting so many times, I finally came back. I ordered the same food that I tried previously. Food are well prepared better than before, service was superb, and decor is very nice. I will come back as regulars."}
{"text":"I eat pho all the time. But the past four months I have been deprived of my favorite food because I have been studying abroad. So I was excited to finally satisfy my craving and we come here to do just that and I ordered my usual pho tai. 

However, the moment my pho came it, I noticed the thick layer of yellow grease sitting on top of the actual soup. I know pho has grease but this was way too much. I have eaten pho plenty of times in my life to know that there should not be that much grease. and After being abroad, my body doesn't digest grease the same way it used to so I started to feel a little sick. But I felt bad so I decided to try to fight through it and just scoop out all the excessive grease. But it was too much and by the time I decided to ask the waitress for something else, there was an entire plate full of grease. 

However, The amazing rude service they provided was the top of my experience. Instead of offering me something else or taking it off the bill, when I told the waitress, she asked if I wanted to take it home and continued to lie to me saying customers pay extra for the amount of grease I got. I also continued to tell her it made me feel sick and she responded \"you should have told us that before\" even though I wasn't expecting a bowl of grease to begin with. When she called over the manager on duty at the time, we told him that it was making me feel sick and he literally laughed at me and walked away without saying a word.

In the end he took it off the bill. But it should not have taken two people with terrible customer service skills to have gotten to that point to begin with. I ended up leaving the restaurant still hungry, but laughing because I was so shocked by the experience. The service was humiliating, and disrespectful and I would definitely not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"This a great place for food, not necessarily for service. The greeting we received was as if we were passing by on the street. It took 15 minutes before someone came by to get our drink orders, by that point we were ready to order. We put our orders in and awaited our food.

Our food came with the same enthusiasm as our initial greeting. The saving grace of this place is the food, and is the only reason I would come back. As we were eating, I ran out of my water and tried to flag someone standing at the cash register 3 times before being recognized. We asked for a box for my wife, usually that is an indicator that a customer is ready to go and to prepare the check. Nope, they didn't get the hint. After about 20 minutes, I went to the counter and asked for the bill and paid.

I am very disappointed with the service I received at this establishment. I hope they can turn things around."}
{"text":"If you want authentic, incredible Vietnamese cuisine Pho Van is the place! Best Pho in the valley hands down! The broth is always flavorful and clear. Love their egg rolls too, gotta roll them in the lettuce leaf and hit it with the fish sauce. YUMMY!  YUMMY! YUMMY!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has replaced Saigon as my Vietnamese restaurant of choice in the Chandler area.  I've had the Pho Tai and Wonton noodle soup and both are legit.  Broth is the key thing I look for in a good pho and Pho Van's is solid.  They're relatively generous with the meat and all the veggies for the pho.  Even the interior of the restaurant is pretty nice for a Vietnamese restaurant.  It's a modern look with lcd tvs on the walls and a large aquarium in the middle of the dining area.

My only potential gripe is that for a bowl of pho, it's on the higher side when it comes to price.  Regardless, if it says anything about the establishment, I may as well consider myself a regular here now."}
{"text":"What a disappointment! We used to go here all the time. Food used to be great and so was customer service. Not sure what happened but a lot has changed since the last time we ate here. It took 10-15 minutes for us to get service and a menu. We asked for a high chair and they never got it for us. We had to get it ourselves. The food itself wasn't that great. We order the house special fried rice which was a bit pricy for the small portion. What really pushed us was the poor customer service. Needless to say we won't be going back."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite place for pho and other Vietnamese food.  They even have egg crepes that are hard to find in other Vietnamese restaurants.  All the staff is friendly and welcoming including the owner.  Has a great vibe and atmosphere."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise to find such great Vietnamese food outside of little Saigon in SoCal! The owners were friendly and service was excellent. We had banh xeo, banh beo, bun bo hue, and lemon grass chicken, all were very tasty! I highly recommend the banh xeo (savory crepes)."}
{"text":"Good service.  Delicious Food.  Besides the good pho I always like to get the meat over lettice.  I don't know what it's called but theres a picture of it on the menu and i just point to it."}
{"text":"Poor customer service and meal was overcharged, ordered the $8 pho and was charged over $10 after tax. And yes I paid with cash, as there is a $1 surcharge for cards. I think this place is a rip off. Would not recommend coming back here."}
{"text":"For starters I will say that the food is OK.  I have tried better Pho in nearby restaurants, but this was somewhat comparable.  The main reason for my low review is for their deceiving advertisement to bring clients into their restaurant.  I am talking about a banner hanging outside that says the following \"50% off from Monday thru Thursday\"; at least the English portion.  The catch is that the sign says Pho Ga, which in Vietnamese means Chicken Pho only.

This times, when the economy is harsh, businesses must come out with new ideas on how to stay alive.  Offering a discount on weekdays seems like a great idea to stay busy throughout the week, but be clear in your advertising and do not deceive those who will pay and come back based on quality and price.  Not everyone that comes into your restaurant speaks Vietnamese and understands your sign outside.  I am not a penny pincher, but just like many other consumers out there rely on a budget for going out.  Shame on me for not clarifying with the waitress about their \"offer\" before ordering."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go Vietnamese food when we're down in Chandler. Today the GF girl ordered a number 54 rice noodle pancake with herbs, sprouts salad with cucumbers, little crunchy onions , sliced pork Bologna. We called it bologna for lack of a better term. GF girl says it taste a lot better than baloney. With a very light dipping sauce on the side.I have the number 31 was the barbecue pork with tasty salad and spring roll."}
{"text":"We go there for chicken pho pretty exclusively bc is is so wonderful. Finally sat down for a non-pho meal that was also great. Vietnamese chicken salad, rice noodle stir fry and Vietnamese crepe. Every bit as wonderful as the pho and Jimmy was very helpful and accommodating."}
{"text":"I love this place! I've been here a couple times and have tried plenty of other Pho restaurants but I'd still choose this over any of the others that I have tried here in Arizona. The decor is nice and seems clean. The employees are very friendly and helpful. The only thing I would say is they put more broth in their Pho than noodles =/ ."}
{"text":"I loved every part of this place.  A clean restaurant, friendly and fast service, great food. The trifecta.  Knowing that parking lot I'd imagine it would be tough to get to on a Saturday at 2, but it's well worth the effort."}
{"text":"Busy place and thats a good thing, ordered #55 beef and spicy noodle broth.   Lots of grizzle on the beef the broth isn't too.  You're better off going to magic noodle"}
{"text":"The owner was really friendly with my family and took time to speak with them on a personal level. Since the Vietnamese community is small in Arizona, it was nice to see my fiancee and her parents have a chance to make a new friend. The food tasted great, too!"}
{"text":"Great staff, Beautiful interior design, a bit dark but i guess it adds to the mysteriousness of the decor, they do not serve alcohol here, but have tasty smoothies!

their pho is FLAVORFUL and delicious!!
everything is nice and clean!

ordered their spring rolls, beef stew, another viet dish (dont recall the name) but it is rice skin with meat inside? lol im not sure.. but that was pretty good too!!

WILL BE BACK!"}
{"text":"When this place opened, it became my go to spot but over time I became frustrated with the poor service and small meat portions compared to the price. I think pho van is the most expensive pho shop in Chandler. The broth to me is okay, a bit too strong for my taste and leaves me feeling severely dehydrated after I eat there. My hubby and I both concluded that we were going to stop coming here because we felt the owner lady and axillary service blunt and almost arrogant. I go where my business is appreciated!"}
{"text":"With another Pho place in the same strip mall, and another just up the road (Pho Ah Sen), there is a lot of competition for Pho Van to deal with.

This was my second visit to Pho Van.  The first was my wife's first Pho experience, and it went well.  Although the place is clean, I always find it funny how these little asian places are designed with furniture and whatnot.  

This time I got Pho with brisket and beef, vegetarian spring rolls, and Thai iced tea, all to go.  It took them about 10 minutes to get everything done and wrapped up, and off to home I went.

The set up for to-go orders are just fine.  The meat, which is rare (wife thought it was raw) was in the same box as the vegies and noodles, which would be fine, but wife was scared because it was so rare.  I assured her it was fine.

The soup needed to be heated in the microwave because it wasn't warm enough, even though I only had a 5 minute ride home.  The noodles were correctly undercooked so that they wouldn't be too soft when added to the soup.  

The broth is quite excellent and I loved the brisket.  Pho Ah Sen gets the thumbs up for the atmosphere, but I'd got to Pho Van any day of the week."}
{"text":"This is our favorite pho place in Chandler and we come here almost every week. I really like their pho, spring roll (the non fried one),  the bbq pork dishes, and the iced coffee."}
{"text":"Pho Van is proud of their food.  In my opinion this is the best pho in Arizona...highly recommend both the pho ga and pho tai bo vien.."}
{"text":"It's decent food. We always get bun with grilled meat and shrimp with egg rolls. 
Nothing spectacular."}
{"text":"AMAZING spring rolls! The pho was very flavorful and they give you lots of basil to put in it."}
{"text":"Was introduced to Pho by some friends while we were in Vegas and I fell in LOVE.  Really, it's the most deliciousness you can put in a bowl.  So, after coming back from Vegas I was on a quest to find a local Pho place. Based on the reviews, I came here.  Was not disappointed.  

The service was great and the chicken pho was great too.  Quick, delicious, with plenty of noodles.  Went back for a 2nd visit and service and food was consistent.  And at $6.75 a bowl, I can afford to come here all the time! Only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because it wasn't as delicious as the pho I had in Vegas and also there is only 1 choice for chicken pho. But I will be returning for that 1 choice time and time again."}
{"text":"Damn good pho and I was incredibly spoiled in Seattle so... yeah.  So far my favorite pho place in all of Phoenix."}
{"text":"I would have rated this place 4 stars but they put MSG in their food which is no bueno.  Having said that, the Pho was outstanding and the Spring Rolls were so delicious!  The service was super attentive and they were so friendly and nice to us!

We got through about 5 minutes of our Pho when my girlfriend was like, \"this has MSG in it and I'm allergic to it.\" So we stopped eating it. The owner was super nice and he promised that if we called in advance he'd make us a broth without MSG in it, super cool.  

If you're reading this Pho Van, my recommendation is that you make your pot of broth without MSG and add it to every bowl individually rather than to the whole pot.  You'll probably save money in the long run...

I'll be back, call in advance and see.  I would happily bring this up to 4 stars!

For those of you unfamiliar with the effects of MSG on the body google it."}
{"text":"I just paid $17.00 for 3 iced coffees that were only filled 3 quarters full and I'm Not happy about it. No coffee in the world is that expensive except for here."}
{"text":"I come here at least once a week. The Pho is great and they will make it to go.   Love Pho when I'm feeling sick so that option is nice. Everything is always fresh and they are always nice to me."}
{"text":"Drove from Goodyear because of the reviews. The food is very good. My wife and I got #21 seafood pho and it was very good. It was well worth the drive. The staff here is very friendly. Great service."}
{"text":"We had a great experience here. The restaurant was extremely clean, which is a major plus. The food came in big portions, but did not leave me feeling weighed down or sleepy after. Everything looked, smelled and tasted great. They presented the food very well. The service was good. We had the server come back and check on us about 3 times during the meal, which made it convenient.  The only problem i had, was eating pho on a hot day. 116 degrees!!! But i guess that was my fault. It was air conditioned and i was still sweating!"}
{"text":"I ate here twice a few months back when I was in AZ to take in some baseball spring training games, but I never got around to reviewing this place until now.

The restaurant is located in the same shopping center that houses Lee Lee Oriental Supermarket so there's plenty of parking available.  Compared to pho places that I've been to in the SF Bay Area, the decor here is pretty nice.  The set up is modern looking and the restaurant seems to be clean.  They do have TVs on that air things such as the local news.

During my first visit, I had a bowl of pho with meatballs (#8).  The temperature of the food was hot and the broth was decent with the flavor leaning more on the sweeter side.  The portion size was adequate.  We also had the spring rolls as an appetizer...they were okay but I've had better tasting spring rolls and peanut sauce elsewhere.

On my next visit, I had the pork and egg roll vermicelli bowl (#20).  This was a good tasting dish and there was a good ratio of noodles, meat/egg rolls, and salad-type ingredients.

The service was decent but nothing in particular is worth noting.  I would dine here again the next time I'm in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"When I come down to the Phoenix area, I often yearn for the Pho places I get up in my neck of the woods in the Seattle area.  Pho Van has filled that gap in my life when I'm visiting the area.  Simply amazing pho.  

I had the flank and steak and asked them if they could throw some tendons in there as well.  I was served by a man who worked there asking \"who ordered tendons?\".  I raised my hand and was asked if I was Vietnamese because I \"knew\".  I got a little kick out of that, but I have to say the tendons were plentiful and delicious!  

The deep fried tofu was really delicious as well, and I will definitely be back to try out some of the pork broth soups on the menu.  

Unlike some pho restaurants, Pho Van has a really nice ambience to it.  This place doesn't get by on looks alone.  They know their stuff!"}
{"text":"I originally gave this place 5 stars for their food yes, but more importantly, for their excellent service, which is not the case anymore. 

I wasn't that hungry so I ordered the kid's bowl, which comes with meatballs. They wouldn't let me order it because I'm not a \"kid\", which was not stated anywhere on their menu by any means. But whatever if that's their implicit policy, that's their policy so I just ordered the regular combo bowl and egg rolls. They brought out spring rolls instead not once, but twice. They also charged me for the extra spring rolls.... Our order was quite simple really, two of the combo pho and one order of egg rolls... 

Then, since I haven't used their 10% off coupon before, when I went up to the register to claim it, the lady said that I cannot use it since I did not inform them beforehand. Their excuse to this was that \"she did not know how to fix it on the register\". Also, she was not apologetic at all for their previous mistakes of bringing out the wrong order. 

I'm not very hard to please at restaurants but this was far beyond disappointing, given the fact that my husband and I used to go here every week.. We will not be going back."}
{"text":"First time here and I'm in love with their pho broth. It's super flavorful and unique! I definitely would come back for more! =)"}
{"text":"This is a good restaurant for bun bo hue. This is probably my favorite restaurant for bun bo hue and have a lot of variety of Vietnamese dishes. The pad thai here isn't going to be authentic but it's still good."}
{"text":"Our most recent visit to this restaurant was not the first time, obviously.  The food here was still good.  But the service became unprofessional.  This restaurant is open sitting; we came in, selected a table and sat down.  The waitress came to us with menus promptly.  So far so good.  But when we gave our order, she did not write it down.  Even though she repeated the order, we had to remind her one item.

From the moment we sat down to the time we paid at the counter, NO ONE served us water.  None of the waitresses who brought our dishes out, one at a time, noticed there was not a single glass of water.  By the way, I ordered iced tea.  No iced tea.  

When I paid at the counter, I informed the manager the short coming of the service of his restaurant.  He asked me to identify the waitress who took our order, but I refused.  My reason: this failure of service started with management, who failed to properly defined responsibilities.  The waitress who took the order might or might not be the same person servicing water. 

The other fail point was that no one, especially those who brought the food out afterward, took notice there was no water.  The waitress who originally took our order did not take the time to revisit us and verify that everything was brought out.  

Even though the food was good, the service was not.  While I hope management fixes this service problem, I am not sure I will give this place another try, given the bad experience we just had."}
{"text":"Love this place! It's very clean and the food is genuine Vietnamese food. There are several plasma screens mounting the walls that are usually tuned to sports or the news, but if you're not a fan of that, ask them and they'll change it for you! I absolutely love the banh mi bo kho and bun bo hue :) The restaurant is a family establishment and I can guarantee you that they're always friendly and helpful! The decor is modern and food is fresh and delicious. A must-try!"}
{"text":"2nd best Pho in Phoenix. The only thing that throws me off is the price of a large bowl is almost $13. Staff is very nice, a little uneasy or uncomfortable with giving the 10% discount for checking in here, but the manager/owner guy is very nice and cool about it. The dining area is very nice and great for a classy dinner."}
{"text":"Pho Van is one of our favorite Pho spots in this area. We used to eat here a couple times a week when we lived closer to this area. 

The woman who owns this spot was always friendly to us.

We should make another visit when we are that way again too!

Worth a taste for sure!"}
{"text":"We've been coming here on the weekends for a couple months now, and this place just rocks.

The staff are awesome, all really friendly with great service. The setting--clean tables, a number of widescreen TVs playing sports, and a beautiful tropical fish tank. There are usually lots of families here, all enjoying a good meal (and looking at the fish!)

Now to the important part--food. The pho is obviously the star, and this version lives up to expectations. Nicely-scented broth and a wide variety of beef cuts to choose from (I'll stick with the round eye, but my boyfriend loves the \"weird\" cuts like tripe and tendon). I also really love the Ca ri (curry coconut milk chicken) with noodles or bread, and another dish under specials which is like a beef stew crossed with pho. The fresh rolls are also delicious, as is the Vietnamese coffee (iced).

There is probably nothing really unique about this place in terms of the food--it is good Vietnamese. The reason I'm giving this place 5 stars is the great service, huge portions (aka great value), and the knowledge that anything I order will be good. It also doesn't hurt that it's next to Lee-Lee Market, so we can go get ingredients after my boyfriend decides to make whatever it is we just ate."}
{"text":"My favorite Vietnamese restaurant in AZ. I recommend this restaurant to all of my friends & family. Quality food, clean atmosphere & very friendly staff. Their soups are the best & it's authentic vietnamese food. Try their Bun Rieu or their Crispy noodle cake (S2) Love, Love Love. Everything I've had here is quite tasty. Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious and authentic. Friendly staff. Ample seating and quiet atmosphere to relax and enjoy your food."}
{"text":"I like good Pho and I cannot lie!  You brothers and sistas can't deny.  When the broth is steamin and the sides are fresh, you get sprung!  You wanna pull up a chair, cuz you know it's stuffed with noodles, deep in that bowl their servin'.  I'm hooked, cause I can't stop eating.  Oh baby, I wanna take some home; along with some spring rolls.  My homeboy tried to warn me, but that Pho's got mememe so hungry! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I am not sure what has happened to this restaurant but the service is horrible. I have been here numerous times with my family but for the past couple times I've been out here its been so terrible. They don't offer you free water anymore as you wait, the people there look miserable, they aren't personable as before, and the food tastes bland. I really feel that this place has some personal issues because the service speaks for itself, horrible. I am definitely searching for a new place to take my family to eat pho."}
{"text":"Good food.  Good environment.  Service OK.  Overall a good experience."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch the other day, haven't been here since the owners changed I believe. Our server wasn't the best with communication, I had a few questions that weren't answered, but I just went with it. We ordered the Bahn Xiao  [I think that's how it's spelled] it was a pretty big portion, or what seemed like it til you realize there is an over abundance of bean sprouts tucked in there. But maybe that's just how they did theirs. We also ordered their spring rolls, tasted good, nothing special about theirs compared to any other place, then we ordered a large rice dish to share, and for the price we definitely didn't think it was worth it. Flavor for everything was pretty good."}
{"text":"I really like it here. Go with my friend and have a really nice experience. The staff is friendly and incredible nice to us. I would recommend the Bun Bo Hue, Pho Dac Biet, and the beef with rice (I forget how to say it name). I haven't visit the restroom yet but I will be. Hope it doesn't let me expectation down. I will be come back, hungry for more.

PS: I think the 3 bean desert is okay since there is many place offer a good ones. The use of kidney bean kill the flavor, making it crunch and not soft at all. Guess I am used to soft bean."}
{"text":"I have tried once and love it. I ordered the #55 BÃºn BÃ² Hu with pork blood. It was spicy. The service was good. I came around 7, and was surprised that only few people was there. I will definitely come back to try others."}
{"text":"Pho van has a nice layout and the food is ok.  Just kinda pricey compared to other Vietnamese restaurants.   The house special friend rice is pretty tasty, but the pho could be better."}
{"text":"Love this place! The pho is the best in the Valley. But I have tried appetizers and dinner entrees that weren't my favorites. Stick with the pho and you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Just when I thought I was finished discovering new (for me) \"Pho Joints\" in Phoenix Metro, I had to hit one more (now up to 13 visited!) and WOW, a very big winner. Broth that rivaled Dragonfly (My #1) and Pho Ao Sen (My VERY close #2), with lots of very tasty meat and the usual accompaniments. I much prefer Broth with a bold flavor and this one fits the bill. Upscale location that was very busy during lunch with lots of \"Pho\" being served to Vietnamese and other  patrons. I guess at $7.50 per bowl a BARGAIN for \"Pho\" with this quality taste!"}
{"text":"Had the pho tai and it was good. The gardeny decor inside kinda relaxing."}
{"text":"I was craving Pho and my go-to place is closed on Sundays so I decided to check this place out.  The restaurant had a nice, modern decor.  The pho itself wasn't bad, good flavor broth and portion size.  I will say I was a bit miffed that the server didn't check in on me at all after my food was delivered and no one offered to refill my diet coke when it was evident halfway through my meal that it was empty.  I also don't like it when restaurants (especially in Arizona don't offer or automatically bring you water).  There were only 3 other tables occupied and I noticed that other customers were looking around as well for assistance from the wait staff.  Flavor profiles matter but for some of us, service is just as important."}
{"text":"I was introduced to Pho Van & it's owner Jimmy by my new neighbor when I moved to Chandler last year.  I have eaten lots of vietnamese & thai food at various locations in the US.

We now eat at Pho Van about twice per week!  It is delicious food, quick and easy for takeout, and the staff is very friendly.  My wife's favorite is the Pho Tai, I try different items...the Vermicelli salad with BBQ pork is a nice light and refreshing meal.  I also like their pork broth as I cannot eat anything with Beef in it.  Many Pho places don't have broth alternatives, so the Pork broth is a nice change of pace!  

I look forward to the addition of live entertainment and rumors I have heard of a better beer selection!"}
{"text":"I went to Pho Van last friday and while I have had lunch from time to time and loved it, I never met the staff or the owner.  On this day, Jimmy introduced himself, took our order and talked me into a dish that isn't on the menu and I swear it was the best food I had eaten in many moons.  It was so good, I am going again tonite to have the very same thing.  His staff is so friendly, they seem to actually enjoy their jobs-which is so refreshing in any line of work, but especially the service industry.  I can't say enough good about this place.  The beer is excellent, the appetizers are top notch but the main entrees are just out of this world.  Thank you Jimmy.  See you tonite!"}
{"text":"I have thought a lot before deciding writing this comment! I and my husband used to like going to this restaurant because we like the food. And in fact, I have tried to help the restaurant out by recommending it to many friends.We have not been back for a while. Last week, we decided to go back and it turned out so disappointed and shocked!!!!! I ordered duck soup noodle ( bun mang vit). My husband ordered egg noodle pork broth (Hu Tieu my). I usually point out the number for the waitress to make sure they understand exactly my order. After 15 minutes waiting for our food, we got something totally difference from what we ordered!!!! I told the waitress I did not order chicken with rice (com ga Hai nam). She  brought my food back to the kitchen and reported to the owner. I thought they were going to change it for me as other restaurants would do! But Nope! The owner came out with his waitress and a menu on his hand. He angrily asked me what I actually ordered and aggressively  started to coach his waitress right in front of us!!!!!! OMG, what a horrible experience we ever had at a restaurant in the States!!!! This is exactly what he coached his waitress in front of us:\" if the customer made a mistake on her order, she has to pay for it. If it was your mistake, I have to pay for it. And it costs me a lot of money. You know that...\" I was way to nice to accept eating a different dish. Not to mention that my husband order was wrong too!! He got rice noodle instead of egg noodles!!!! My husband did not finish his meal. He wanted to GET out of this HELL asp. 

I really hope that the owner of Pho Van read this comment and wake up before too late!!!! I have seen many of the same comments as mine on Yelp. Hello!!! You are doing business in a capitalism country where service is crucial to be survived! Your portion is much smaller than other Vietnamese restaurants in town while your price is much higher! And your service is HORRIBLE!! Good luck with your business!"}
{"text":"I've never tried anything I haven't liked from here. I've had all of their pho varieties, the #55 (my personal favorite, a must-try if you're a pho fan), Thai spiced snails, the chicken wings, the #30 (a salad-esque dish with rice noodles and crunchy strips of pork).

You simply cannot go wrong here! Best Vietnamese food in the area, and a very gracious and friendly owner (Jimmy)."}
{"text":"Always makes me feel better to have pho when I'm feeling sick. They make amazing food, have outstanding service and great choices."}
{"text":"I ordered their pho and spring rolls and it was delicious. The only thing I didn't really like is their service and how expensive their food is. It is kind of on the pricy side. The service is horrible, they seem to not care about us and never refilled our drinks and we had only water. Overall, food is good, service just sucks."}
{"text":"Ahh, the crave.  Having grown up Vietnamese, I consider myself something of an expert on Vietnamese cuisine.  So I've had great (of course, my grandmother's and mother's food is 5 star), and I've had horrible.  Pho Van (putting accents on the vowels is difficult with an American keyboard, so I'm not going to bother) falls in the middle--not my favorite, but not too bad.

We started with appetizers.  Cha gio, which is a pork filled roll in a won ton wrapper, was okay.  It tasted not so fresh, but had good filling, and the Nuoc Mam (a fish sauce used to flavor) was okay.  My wife and I had Goi Cuon, which is a shrimp and pork, with vermicelli noodle rolled in a rice paper wrapper, was pretty good.  This is dipped in a  peanut sauce.

I had the basic Pho Tai.  This is a soup, typically pre-prepared by putting cooked rice vermicelli noodles at the bottom of a bowl, and then very thinly sliced beef, and then hot Pho broth poured over the soup to essentially reconstitute the noodles and cook the beef.  The secret to Pho is really the broth.  Typically, this needs to stand on its own to make a good judgement.  It does--it was flavorful, tasted fresh, and had a very rich flavor.  I was pleased.  For my own purposes, I do add Hoisin Sauce and Srirachi Hot Sauce.  Having eaten here once before, I knew I wouldn't be disappointed.  The only criticism I would have of this Pho is that there's not enough of it.  The standard bowl did not have much in the way of noodles or beef.  For $8, I was hoping for more food.

The rest of my family members had Bun Thit Nuong Cha Gio.  This is a traditional dish with rice vermicelli noodles, barbecued pork, and cha gio, over which you pour Nuoc Mam.  There is a bed of fresh vegetables.  This is what I typically think of when I think of Asian Salad--it's bean sprouts, lettuce, mint, and cucumber.  The barbecued pork tasted quite good as did the Cha Gio, once again.  I found this food quite good as well.  

The restaurant was very clean, relatively quiet.  There's a very pretty fish tank.  The decor was very nice.  The staff was attentive, and service was quick.  I note though that it was 5:30pm on a Friday, and the restaurant was unbusy.  The Nuoc Mam smelled very funny to me though--I'm used to the smell of this food additive, and this one smelled quite odd to me.  We are talking about something called \"fish sauce\" though, so I'm sure there are variants.  It tasted fine so no worries.  Staff needs to use cleaner towels when they wipe the tables as it does leave its own smell as well."}
{"text":"Being from Los Angeles, this place has generous portions and serves tasty pho. Broth was good and generous meat portions. The fried spring rolls were crispy and delicious. They give you ample greens, basil, and mint with the appetizers. Never seen so much greens in an appetizer but it made sure I had my portion of veggies with all the hearty food. Price was a few dollars more than I usually pay for back in LA but then again I'm away from home so this will do."}
{"text":"Pho here was pretty good. Although, prices were a little higher than most Vietnamese restaurants ($7.75 for the Pho Dac Biet)."}
{"text":"When I was introduced to this Vietnamese restaurant last year, it was hard to forget. The restaurant is clean, service is friendly, and food is awesome! Oh, and how could I forget the extremely reasonable prices? The only complaint I have is that they don't have a website...but I'll try to remember what I've had!

We usually start with the fresh spring rolls. They aren't anything special, but the peanut dipping sauce...mmmm. I could eat that by the spoon if it came in a jar!

The pho is near perfect in my books. It's a huge portion, and the broth is well seasoned- I can't stand it when I order pho and it comes with what tastes like chicken broth. If I wanted chicken noodle soup I could open a can! There is a good ratio of noodles to broth, and there has a decent amount of meat. You can't go wrong ordering pho here.

The last time I was here, I tried some sort of chicken curry \"soup\" that came with the option of noodles or bread (we opted for the noodles). It was excellent but very spicy. However, that didn't keep me from eating more and more; in fact, it was near impossible to stop eating. It'll be hard to pass that down when returning to Pho Van for my fix of pho!

It's hard not to give Pho Van 5 stars, but I'll have to stick with 4 for now."}
{"text":"Some of the dishes at Pho Van are so good I pretty much just inhale them.  The noodle bowls are wonderful, filled with fresh ingredients, a rich mixture of flavors and variety of textures.  The food is healthy and very tasty.    

They have some exotic drinks on the menu.  My favorite is the lychee drink, which is essentially 10 or so fresh lychees in water with crushed ice.  It's very refreshing.

I will also note that the restaurant is conveniently located next to Gelato 64, so it's always nice to walk next door and have a little sorbet or ice cream to cap things off!"}
{"text":"Living close to Mekong plaza makes it hard to define this place as better. I went only once, and I found the food was ok but no surprise in the preparation. The big plus this place has is the near boba."}
{"text":"Not the best in town.  The broth was bland.  The staff was a little stand offish.  Looks like they spent more time on the decoration then on the food.  Pho 68 in the same complex is much better."}
{"text":"order the rice plate with beef, for 11 bucks, it's kinda pricey.  it's good and all (on a bit salty side) but i wouldn't order again.  the avocado shake is good, nice and thick with real avocados blended in.  Can't really complain or compare with joints in the bay area though.  watched the giants game 6 nlcs bottom of the 9th here, 4 big screen lcd's with directv.  on a sidenote, they actually some rare items even usual pho places don't such as the beef stew with bread for dipping and the nem nuong rolls."}
{"text":"By far the best vietamese food in the area, which is a bold statement considering that there are many. It is a bit more expensive than most though."}
{"text":"Delicious food, fresh ingredients, everything home-made, excellent service.  Restaurant is extremely well-decorated and appealing.  We went at opening time on a Saturday and were seated and served immediately.  This was only the second time I have eaten Vietnamese food . . . and it was the best.  We ate until we were stuffed and the final bill, no drinks, with tip, was less than $40 for two people.  We will definitely be back!  Bravo to the owners of this establishment!"}
{"text":"I've been to a ton of Pho places here in the valley, and this is the best one I've been to, by far.  The prices are reasonable and the Pho was fantastic.  The rolls were pretty good, but not the best I've had around here (that honor belongs to Saigon Pho, not too far from this place.  BBQ beef rolls there are fantastic, but I digress).  I haven't tried anything else at Pho Van, but it all looked pretty good too.  

The place is super clean and the service was ridiculously fast (I don't know if it was just my luck or if that's a regular thing).

I want to come back, but it's not close to my house.  However, it's worth the drive if you ever get that Pho craving."}
{"text":"I have tried many other Pho restaurants in this area (I have tried TONS).. Pho Van is the only place that I would go back to.  It's not PERFECT by any means, but they have a great broth for their Pho and yummy spring rolls.  Interestingly enough, the past two times I have tried to go there, they have closed early!  Very frustrating."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  The atmosphere is great.  The food is awesome!  The BBQ pork is the best I've had in Chandler.  Price was reasonable, and the service was friendly.  This spot is a definite winner!!!"}
{"text":"GUESS WHAT VIETNAMESE EAT FOR BREAKFAST?????  PHO FO BREAKFAST!!!  And it sits all nice and warm like grandma's oatmeal. I am a Pho snob. I will drive twenty miles to Da Vang any day. But I was at Lee Lees, needing some spices, and they were open. And I ate Pho for breakfast and I was soooo hopeful that it would be good. And it was. It was right up there. The spring rolls were okay. I took a look around and everything was looking nice and fresh.  Plus, you get to shop for your rice vinegar after your meal. Win win. Service was fine, but he was just ONE GUY and if more ppl had showed up I would have been waiting for my Pho. Only SINGLE issue was no Cliantro on the side, a small sprinkle in your soup and I am a herb whore I wanted more. But go, go and eat Pho, even for breakfast!!!"}
{"text":"Pho is magic. It cures everything, and we head to Pho Van whenever there's even a hint of a cold coming on. OK, we go even when we feel fine. No matter how hot it is outside. Pho Van's broth is so flavorful and comforting we can't resist.

We've eaten in and ordered bun and some other dishes, but usually we grab pho take-out. The #7 house special is my favorite by far. Don't let the tripe and tendon freak you out, they're awesome and shouldn't be missed."}
{"text":"The restaurant is in the LEE LEE grocery store shopping center.  Located next to Gelato spot, which is another MUST try, and a bakery which we need to try next!  Also, on the same side as the boba place which is really fun to try as well.

The chicken pho we had at this restaurant was too sweet for our taste.  Even after adding lime juice and basil and sirihacha.  There was plenty of chicken and the bowl is really big, my 2 kids shared and there was still some left over.

The bbq ribs were delicious, but too thin.  They come on top of white rice and a side salad of cabbage, cucumber and a fish sauce dip.  They were grilled to perfection, fall off the little bone and topped with dry roasted garlic and green onion.  My favorite, just wish they were thicker or more of it!!

The rice noodle seafood dish was a lite sauce with veggies, also good.

overall, we have been to this place three times and we have enjoyed something new every time."}
{"text":"So disappointed in service and menu! I came here for the spring rolls and beef stew. Well what do you know they are out of shrimp, and then they said they don't make the stew anymore. TAKE IT OFF YOUR MENU THEN!"}
{"text":"My first Pho since relocating from Oregon. Pho Van seems like an typical pho restaurant. The service was nice but erratic, the salad rolls were just average and the grilled pork vermicelli pretty good.
Overall, it was good, but I am sure that there are better place out there."}
{"text":"There is such a thing as being too attentive, and Pho Van's service is too much and a bit suffocating. Other than their overpriced menu, the dipping sauce for the spring rolls is too salty, made purely of Hoison sauce. The egg noodle soup is decent, but contains too much dried shrimp in the broth."}
{"text":"The food was acceptable however the service was the worse I have ever experienced.  We had to wait 15 minutes before a waitress took our order, then we waited another half hour to get our food.  Other patrons came in, ate and left before us.  We had to go to the counter to ask where our food was. After we got our food we had to go to the counter to get a to go container and then again to find out how to get our check.  The manager was sitting at a table with a waitress playing on his computer.  Found out they are the 4th owners but I don't think they will last long.  I would not recommend this place.  Go to the restaurant connected to Lee Lee Market.  Much better and fantastic service."}
{"text":"Very nice. Went for Friday dinner there. Had an appetizer, 2 entries and desert. All were very tasty, but unfortunately entrees were drowning in fat. It tasted great but i felt really bad and guilty about stuffing my face with this. 
Place seems pretty clean and service was attentive for the most part. It was busy but not annoyingly crazy. Did not notice any liquor there, not even beer.
Jasmine ice tea was kinda bland, as was Vietnamese Tricolor Desert. However, wife's Thai Tea was one of the best!!!

Certainly a place to comeback to.

\"I like\""}
{"text":"I had a bad first experience with pho. BUT this place is the best that I've had so far! Everything tastes very fresh and is so good. I got the chicken pho (I forgot what it's called) and it was good aside from the chicken lacking any seasoning of sorts. It was a little on the pricy side (for me, personally) but definitely get your money's worth. I definitely recommend it. My boyfriend got the tripe (and I think some other sorts of meat(s)) and really enjoyed it as well."}
{"text":"Broth didnt have a ton of flavor. The meat looked a bit raw still. Inside felt dark and odd."}
{"text":"I ordered Pho here and it was just cold. They did not heat up the soup right. Also i ordered a $12 pho bowl and received 4 piece of meats in the whole bowl also less then a grip of pho. That what i paid for... 4 piece of meat and a extra small bowl of pho... And the pho was barely warm considering it cold... Can not enjoy pho here...!"}
{"text":"Prologue:
My girlfriend and I are always in the mood for a satisfying lunch after our regular weekend hike and, more often than not, it ends up being noodles of some kind.
We needed to stop by Lee Lee Supermarket to pick up a couple of things and so we decided to try Pho Van, which was the first time for both of us.

The Plot:
We shared and order of Gi Cun (Summer Rolls, a.k.a. Fresh Spring Rolls), a bowl of Ph ?c Bit (the standard and probably most popular version beef noodle soup with sliced eyeround steak, brisket, flank, tendon, and beef meatball), and Cm Tm Sn BÃ² (beef short rib rice plate).

The Scene:
The portion sizes were generous and more than enough for the two of us.
The peanut dipping sauce for the summer rolls was a nice balance of sweet and savory and the composition, taste, and texture of the rolls was good.
The Pho was good, it did manage to satisfy our craving for carbs and protein, and it also warmed us up after being outdoors all morning on day that was gray and overcast.
The highlight for us was the beef short ribs, which were very tender, flavorful, and had been nicely grilled.

The Rest of the Story:
The summer rolls arrived chilled and, judging by the fact that the lettuce and sliced pork had already dried out a bit, it's likely that they were prepared earlier that day and stored in the refrigerator.
We think it really does make a difference when summer rolls are made to order (see our Binh Duong Quan review on 11/6/16) because they're more flavorful when served fresh and at room temperature.
The beef stock for the Pho was good but otherwise unremarkable.
Considering that the quality of the beef broth in Pho is one of the hallmarks of a good Vietnamese restaurant, along with the price of $9 per bowl, I would have expected the kitchen to have put a little more effort into developing the depth and complexity of the beef stock.

Epilogue:
The service was prompt, courteous, and all of our orders arrived fairly quickly.
This restaurant is a bit pricey compared to other Vietnamese restaurants in the area of similar quality.
My girlfriend liked the dÃ©cor, which is definitely a plus when we dine out.

{"text":"All i can say is this place has the WORST service ever!! 
Couple days ago, my boyfriend and I decided to eat here because it was close to Leelee and we were lazy to drive anywhere far. So when we were finished eating, I got up to pay for our meal. A Vietnamese lady at the cash register whispered to me saying that she needs to greet the customers that sat down at the table behind me, and since she cant do two jobs at once so she was wondering if i could do it for her, but luckily one of the waitresses came and said that she got it. I was surprised and couldn't believe she asked me that.. I came here to eat, not to do your job. Then later while I was signing the receipt, she told me that I look pretty and that if her son was here, she would hook me up with her son. She said that while my BOYFRIEND was sitting RIGHT THERE! After my boyfriend heard what she said, he was so pissed off. How could you say that when someone's boyfriend is right there?! How stupid can you be?!?! 

I felt so uncomfortable and not happy, so i decided not to give them any tip. When my boyfriend and I started leaving and walking out the door. She went to the door and asked us loudly \"Were you guys not happy with our service?\" and I told her that your service was ok since they didn't do much. She replied, \"because you guys didnt give us any tip!\" We were shocked and wanted to curse her out, but at the fact that she's an adult I didn't want to cause any drama. That was EXTREMELY RUDE of her! Where's your manners, lady?! Did your mother teach you about manners when you were young?! Here's the funny part.. she knows that im Vietnamese. We speak the same language, but she decided to speak English just so that everyone in the restaurant could understand her. 

Anyways, we will never come back to this place.. since we live close to this area, I'll make sure to warn anyone that goes here about how terrible this place is. Whoever is reading this, I'd recommend that you guys should try out Pho Saigon (at alma school rd) or Pho Vietnam (at Warner rd..it's close to Walmart).  They have way better service than this crap. LOL"}
{"text":"I've been back a couple of times since the initial visit. The service has definitely improved. The food is actually pretty decent. I usually order the Bun Bo Hue. It is a tad oily but overall full of favor. 
However, in my last visit, I noticed that they changed their serving bowls. They claim it is better to \"hold the heat\". In my opinion, it just looks smaller. I believe it is smaller because my gf were able to finish her meal...which is rare. 
Now....I am deciding if I should return since the portion to cost ratio is no longer fair..."}
{"text":"Pho Van is another gem in our vast array of Asian restaurants in this nook of Chandler. 

There's nothing like a big, spicy bowl of Pho when you've got a nasty cold to get a little relief.

These guys certainly delivered.

Dragged Dude in here after he had been sick for a week for some Beef Brisket Pho, and with a healthy dousing of sriracha, I think it did the trick. 

Fresh, flavorful ingredients and attention to detail was apparent. 

The beef thankfully wasn't super fatty and they didn't skimp on the noodles.

The Spring Rolls stuffed with shrimp and pork and the accompanying peanut dipping sauce are a must, worth the $4.95.

Beautiful decor, friendly service and clean restaurant - We'll be back, in sickness or in health!"}
{"text":"After first visiting neighbor Manila Bakery and buying a few treasures, I decided I'd give Pho Van a try.  I rarely indulge in pho since it's 

a.  a broth- it is high in sodium
b.  a noodle soup- it is full of empty-calorie, high-glycemic index noodles!  

But I made a deal with myself that if there is a child-size pho in the menu, and I'm allowed to order it, then I'm going to have some!  Wouldn't you know it, after surveying the apps and entree pages, there it was, on the ff. page, \"kid's bowl of pho $3.50, choice of meatballs or eyeround.\"  And yes, I, a thirty-something Filipina who is often-mistaken to be in her late-teens/early 20's, was able to order it!  I chose the eyeround since you never know what else gets ground up and incorporated in meatballs, or other processed meats for that matter.  (Speaking of processed meats, have any of you seen the section on hotdogs on \"How it is Made\"?  I never was a fan of hotdogs save the redhots from my childhood in Manila- I loved them fried, sliced, and eaten with steamed white rice... mmmm!- anyhoo, as I was saying, I never was a fan, and that episode has me weaned off of almost all hotdogs for life!)

Back to the review, the eyeround pho was deliciously good eatin'- hot, salty, broth with rings of onion and sliced green onions (scallions to some) made perfect with the addition of basil, mint, and a few squeezes of lime (comes in a separate dish with chilies- jalapenos, to which I'm allergic).  The rice noodles, most of which I left in the bowl, made a nice bed for all the flavors to marry together.  I ended the meal with che ba mau, the tri-color delight of yellow mung beans, red mung beans, green jelly, coconut milk, and shaved ice.  I did tweak it a bit and requested zero green jelly- I do not particularly enjoy chewy gelatin laced with food coloring in icy delights.  The Vietnamese version of the icy treat I remember from my childhood (halo-halo), with extra yellow beans, sent me over the moon!  

Nice decor, tasteful tv screens, and the staff was friendly and non-intrusive.  After some time, someone turned on modern Vietnamese pop music- the volume wasn't too loud, but a lower level would've been welcome, esp. if on a date or part of a group.  Make sure to check out the aquarium full of colorful fish!  Nice touch!"}
{"text":"I used to come here often but I think the management has changed. The last time I came, the food was good but the service was terrible. First off, I came in asking to sit outside but they said they do not serve people outside. I would have to get it to go even though they had outside seating. I ordered anyway. 

My friend ordered one pho soup. I ordered a beef stew, spring rolls, and a side of filet mignon. When we got our food there was no filet mignon and the spring roll appetizer came out last. I asked them for the filet mignon and they said they already put it in my friend's soup. We didn't see any in her soup. I told them that I ordered it, not my friend, and didn't see any. They said the pho is for the filet mignon and my stew is not made for it. I told her she should let people know that while they order. She said \"everyone knows this, even Americans.\" Unfortunately, she was too busy too show us the filet mignon. 

Be careful what you order. They may not give you the right thing and not help you afterward."}
{"text":"Lunch on Saturday consisted of Dac Biet Pho and some spring rolls. The Pho was good with alot of tendon, hardly any tripe with really melt in your mouth beef slices. The broth was not all that salty which was a really good thing. The wife got a childs size bowl which is another good thing since she can't eat a full size bowl. The spring rolls were almost all meat with very little filler, also really good. 

The staff was awesome, all were super friendly and the waitress was right on us when out pop ran low. I really liked the restaurant itself since it didn't feel so hole in the wall and had a very very nice saltwater aquarium as you walked in the door. Overall, its worth going back for next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"We tried the quail appetizer which was delicious. The decor was nice for a Viet restaurant. The service was good. I ordered the veggie pho which was pretty good. Despite all these positive comments, why only 3 stars? It has okay food if you don't want to travel far, but in comparison to other Viet restaurants, it's not as good and overpriced."}
{"text":"Great pho and noodle dishes.  The pho broth is very flavorful and perfectly seasoned.  The portions are large, with generous portions of noodle and meat.  Their vermicelli dishes are very good as well.  Prices are a little high, but are worth it for the quality of food."}
{"text":"Their pho is good, and they have plenty of other authentic offerings as well. If you're feeling adventurous, they have a few more... 'Vietnamese'... dishes, such as the tasty beef stew with cooked blood and pig knuckles (not really my things, but you should at least try it sometime- you might just love it!!)

We split several dishes, including some pho, com dac biet (sort of a mixed rice dish), and a tasty pork and egg noodle dumpling soup. Everything was tasty and satisfying, and the service was great. They have a decent menu, but maybe our table was just missing a separate beverage menu? The restaurant interior is quite lovely, and they have a neat little aquarium that the kids will enjoy looking at. 

There's another great place for pho just a few storefronts down, and I'd be hard-pressed to do a side by side comparison of the two. I'd honestly recommend that you try both, because they're both quite excellent!"}
{"text":"Always fresh and amazing. The service is great and quick! Love this place #20 is my fav!!"}
{"text":"I was craving Pho eventhough it was a very warm night. I popped in here and it was wonderful. The crepe was fresh and tasty, the pho was nice and hot and the meat was good, fresh and tender. The staff was also very nice and courteous. Highly recommended and I will return when I'm in town."}
{"text":"I love this place. The Pho is excellent, and the service is prompt. I have always been able to get in and out during luncheon time."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time for lunch. I wish they had more vegetarian options. I ordered the veggie spring rolls and the veggie fried rice. All the Pho was beef or pork. I loved how the cook asked if I would like egg in my rice - I do not, and I was very glad they took that into consideration. The food came out right away, but wasn't very hot and it didn't taste fresh and didn't have much flavor. I LOVE spice and I literally consumed the entire cup of chili on the table to get some more flavor going on. The service wasn't great, they didn't check on me one time during my meal to see if everything was okay nor refill my water and I had to hunt a person down to get a box for my leftovers. I guess you can't have it all now-a-days...."}
{"text":"My husband and I love pho. We are new to the area and have been trying out different restaurants. Last weekend we decided to try this place for lunch. The one star is for the awful service. We were seated fairly quickly, but it was at least 10 minutes before we were brought menus. We waited another 10 - 15 minutes and still no water, no one to take our order...nothing. The restaurant was steady but not busy. The employees seemed to be completely unengaged. I can't remember the last time we walked out of a restaurant, but after waiting close to a half an hour we decided to cut our losses and try another place. We ended up at Saigon Pho, which was wonderful - excellent food and service! There are too many great places to eat in the Phoenix area to ever give this place a try again."}
{"text":"This place would get a 5 star if the service was better.  Took awhile to take the order.  When they brought out the appetizer they didn't bring any plates to eat them with.  Then when they brought out the pho they never brought out the veggies and limes that usually comes with it. And after that never came back to check on the table. Ran out of water after eating the appetizer. But the food was really good. The place itself was nice, felt really modern."}
{"text":"WOW is all I can say! I've been dining here off and on for the past 8 years and have never been so rudely treated by the owner of a restaurant. What happen to the saying \"the customer is always right\" especially when your wait staff screws up the order. 

We sat down and were asked what we wanted to drink. We ordered 2 Tsingtao Beer and were told they only had Coronas because the Owner \"drank all the Tsingtao Beer last night.\" WOW, how professional. We ordered 2 appetizers and 2 Phos. My friends Pho came incorrectly and was told that \"that's how it come\" when on the menu you clearly had a choice of pork or beef not both and she specified BEEF. 

Here's the other WOW. We ordered 2 HOT Thai coffees. The waiter came with 2 ice coffees and when we said we ordered 2 hot coffees, the response was \"we don't have hot coffee\" and to just take it. I said \"no\" take it back the owner comes rushing over obviously agitated and said to us \"cold coffee is better anyway.\" Really??? When we went to pay they tried to charge us for the cold coffee. Again the owner being very agitated at us said \"well you should know how to order your coffee\" Really??  You just said that to a paying customer. I said \"maybe you should train your wait staff not to tell the customer there is no beer because you drank it all\", he then proceeded to tell us we have a choice not to come back and he did not need our business. 

I have never met such an arrogant ass----! After, I did take note on other Yelpers same complaints, IT'S all TRUE"}
{"text":"I've been to here twice and both times I am underwhelmed with the food and service.  Let's start with the service, the ladies are short and rude.  Barely even notice you are there.  Not to mention lacked customer service skills altogether.  The food is lack luster compared to other Pho places.  My fiancÃ© even mentioned that at the end of our Pho the broth seemed to be 'dirty'.  The spring rolls were good but that was the extent of the positive regarding their food.  I will not be returning as there are so many better options in the area.  Save yourself the trouble and choose elsewhere when craving Pho."}
{"text":"Good food, bad service. 

Their food is good and authentic Vietnamese food can get in Arizona, but their service sucks, like really sucks. Got our food, and we needed something and our waiter was no where to be found so I got up to the cashier counter and found my waiter standing there texting, like really? You've got to be kidding me. The waiter didn't ask how things were going, I had to get up and ask for my bill, refilled our waters... ANYTHING. This isn't just once, I've gone here three times and still the same, horrible service. I would totally understand if they were busy, but every single time I visited, the entire restaurant was literally empty besides my table and another's.  All the employees there are either behind the counter watching tv, on their cell phones or talking to each other. If it weren't for the good food, I definitely wouldn't be coming back."}
{"text":"First time here. Haven't had Vietnamese in a long while. 
Let me tell you this place was sooooo incredibly delicious. Our pho was so fresh tasting and amazingly well balanced in flavor. Totally hit the perfect balance of 
Sour, Salty, Sweet, Spicy.
I highly recommend this place for pho! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great place...food was flavorful, fresh & delishious...loved the music they play, the tvs & decor is awesome....I highly recommend them! Cheers!"}
{"text":"Finally I get a real coconut!"}
{"text":"Great food. But service is worse and worse every time we are here. I feel bad because the owner is a really great person. But all the waitresses who work there only plays on their cell phones. Never come to check the table, the food. And even you walk to them to ask for Togo containers. They just ignore you. If your cell phone game or Facebook is that important then just stay home please? 
And there's NO 10% off check in. Obviously they tell you it's 10% off of your own food. Not with your partner. They need to put that on Yelp. \"10%off your own food, not 10%off your bill\". Ridiculous!
WORST services ever."}
{"text":"Best chicken curry I have ever had! Usually the chicken is in small pieces and chewy. Not this place! Big chunks of tender chicken and potatoes. Awesome!"}
{"text":"Good food, but I don't care for the SUPER FAST waitstaff. Fast is one thing, but walking away while I am still trying to order is RUDE."}
{"text":"My Vietnamese parents fed me pho before I even grew teeth to chew on the noodles! So when it comes to pho, I'm highly judgemental and point out every little flaw. I'm picky when it comes to choosing a good Vietnamese restaurant! Sorry, blame my parents. They're picky eaters! So I was so glad to come across this place in Arizona! 

This place is ze bomb! Every time I eat here it reminds me that I am not missing out on anything back home in Cali when it comes to good Pho. 

The broth is always steaming good. Add a little bean sprouts, lemon, mint leaves and u got yourself a big bowl of goodness! 
I always get the PHO TAI with only the red meat or for the people who never tried pho, and if u crazy kids wanna go all out, try the pho Dac Biet. Which includes all the meat, tendons, etc. 

I love this place. Bomb everything!"}
{"text":"Yay! We were looking for a great place for Pho! And this is it! Actually recommended to me by a Vietnamese friend- it's where she goes... Very nice staff. Fresh veggies. Great Pho. Haven't tried anything outside of my addiction yet. It is nice in that it is close to Lee Lee's Asian Market, so we usually do a little shopping there as well. If you are looking for Pho here in Phoenix, this is the place! (I perused some of the other reviews, and it is obvious that most of the negative ones were from folks who obviously weren't used to Vietnamese cuisine....)"}
{"text":"Fantastic!! One of the best Pho's I've ever had. The spring rolls were hands down the best EVER. Beautiful restaurant, great service, sparkling clean. Will positively go there again."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for quite a while and will continue to dine here.   The food is fresh and tasty.   The staff is friendly.   Don't leave without getting the Vietnamese coffee.   Wow!  Good stuff."}
{"text":"Decent food but horrible customer service. The waiter only tended my party TWICE: to sit us down and to take our order. Service was very unprofessional. No water refills until we raised our hands to ask for it. Sometimes, we couldn't even spot any waiters except for the owner who seemed to be enjoying her lunch at the table in the corner. Same goes with the bill. We waited until we couldn't anymore and had to come to the register ourselves to get the bill and pay it. 
Like mentioned before, the food is decent. At least the Hu Tieu My Tho Kho that I always get. As for the portion size, it seems like it has gotten smaller. 

Pho Van can really become great if they put more effort in their customer services."}
{"text":"My wife and love Pho Tai and have tried it at many Vietnamese restaurants around the valley. Yesterday, we tried Pho Van and were very impressed. 

The broth was nice and clear, full of flavor and tasted very fresh. All condiments and utensils were at the clean table by the window per our request. We were met with smiles and an immediate feeling that you were wanted and important. I was asked by Thi (sp?), pronounced \" like cup of tea\", if I had been there before, which I had not and answered honestly. Upon on finding that out, Thi asked if I needed any help with the menu? Of course I already new what I wanted, Pho Tai, so I did not. She stated that that was their signature dish. 

Our meal came quickly and you could tell that the thinly sliced beef had just been placed in the broth as it was pink and with in a min fully cooked in the piping hot broth. An ample plate of bean sprouts, peppers and basil accompanied the two large bowls we had ordered. Price was the going rate. Next time I'll try the spring rolls too. Good job!"}
{"text":"Bad choice!

I order the egg rolls to start off with... we were done after the first bite, it had a bad after taste as if it was rancid.  The brisket pho wasn't any better, broth was lacking flavor and my brisket was still pink because the broth wasn't steaming hot. 

I order the chicken fried rice for my daughter... they should've called it \"Fried peas and carrots with an overly cooked brown rubbery egg.\"  Where's the rice?! Anyway, Will not be back!"}
{"text":"The Lee Lee Market shopping center in Chandler is really one stop shopping for great food.  We were already big fans of Phoenix Palace for dim sum and China Magic Noodle for noodles, so we thought we'd try Pho Van.

We both ordered the special Pho and it was quite good. Nice rich broth with all the requisite ingredients.  Lots of fresh herbs and vegies served alongside.  We got a pork spring roll and that was nice as well.

Basically, exactly what it should be and about $25 for three dishes with tip.  Service was fine."}
{"text":"I was craving for Pho and wanted to go somewhere else in Chandler other than Saigon Pho. (will try Cyclo and Anise soon). 
My first impression when I walked in was: clean, modern, and the staff was friendly. 
My order came quickly. The person waiting on us was prompt, friendly, accommodating, attentive....ok, cute too! The Pho was very good!

Overall, my experience was great and will be coming back whenever time permits"}
{"text":"They have good pho, rice dishes, and noodle dishes.  But whats with the price? It's not a little high.. they are sky high! This could become my regular spot if the prices weren't so high."}
{"text":"Less than stellar food. Absolute crap service at a time when there was only one other party there. My girlfriend left hungry, because she couldn't stomach the poorly cooked tofu."}
{"text":"Wow.  The pho is the best I've had in Phoenix and better than a lot I've had in CA and WA.  The round eye is nice and rare.  The tendon was pretty good.  It'd be better if it was cut in thicker pieces, but we're quibbling now.

The pork chop was delicious, although for $8, I'd expect two or a larger pork chop with less bone.  The only part of the meal that wasn't amazing was the rice.  It was cold and wasn't sticking together properly.  

Pho Van is my new go to place for pho in the Valley."}
{"text":"Pho Van was my first experience with Vietnamese Cuisine and might I add that I was thoroughly impressed. The Pho was absolutely wonderful and the spring rolls were delish. I am not a big \"noodle person,\" but the broth coupled with the bean sprouts and thai basil makes for an excellent bowl of \"soup.\" I will definitely return here..."}
{"text":"This was not good. Service was poor, pho Tai was very bland. Spring roll \"starter\" came out while we were halfway done with our pho. Even though they close at 8:30pm, by 8:15pm they had chairs up, music off and, oh, US EATING. Our server was absent and no one said thank you as we uncomfortably walked out at 8:23pm. With all the other pho restaurants in the vicinity, they don't even come close to competing. Surprised at all the positive reviews."}
{"text":"Great food!! The owners and staff are very friendly.  Will definitely be back again soon!"}
{"text":"Place was dirty and did not serve vegetarians. They guy said over the phone they did. Otherwise nice people."}
{"text":"Delicious food!! The prices are a couple dollars more than some places but reasonable. I deducted one star because the service is slow every time I have been there."}
{"text":"I know they're known for pho, but try the curry NOW!!!! Get it with bread. It is so good you will lose your mind!!!!"}
{"text":"Not very good. My spring roll was bland and the peanut sauce was yucky. Vermicelli bowl was full of bean sprouts not noodles."}
{"text":"Food is always delicious, service is great, and it is beautiful inside. I'm never disappointed whether I'm eating on or ordering to go."}
{"text":"Excellent Food + Good Service + Nice Digs

Being a fan of Pho, always up for a friendly first visit for fresh broth, noodles, and sides.  (Okay, used up all my words beginning with the \"ffff\" sound.)

Pho Van is a nice restaurant with excellent Pho.  We ordered the Fried Tofu (okay), Pho Da Biet (great), Bun Ga Xao Xa (very good), and some straight noodles with chicken off the kids menu for the kids.  All were tasty and arrived with a modest wait.

Only knocks would be on service and availability.  They were training a new dude, so we had to repeat orders and things came out at different times, so our family couldn't eat quite together.  Won't rate them down too much for that.  But, then they were out of the flavored drinks we wanted to order from the menu.  Three of them.  In a row.  We ended up going simple with water and tea.  And yes, only the Boss can enter the Yelp! discount.

Very cool aquarium.  Kids were enthralled!"}
{"text":"I've tried many Pho establishments in and around the valley. This particular place has probably been my worse experience for service. For instance, one of the servers was walking around drinking a beer and ignoring his dinner guest for the most part of my time there. Also, the same server took a drink from another guests table and gave it to me. Instead of refilling my drink. I guess I would understand the arrogance of the service if the food was good enough to support their attitude toward their guess. Unfortunately, it's not! However, one thing worth mentioning real quick. The spring rolls are outstanding and the peanut sauce is on point.  
     The number 11 is what I ate and it consisted of a very greasy cloudy broth oppose from my other experience with other Pho dishes I've had at other establishments. Where their broth had had a nice clean slightly tinted broth with hardly any pools of grease. And a much more pleasant experience overall."}
{"text":"Pretty fancy place they have here, nestled in a strip mall near a Boba shop, Lee Lee Market, and a Chinese restaurant. Pho Van has a large and well decorated dining room with a fish tank, plenty if gigantic televisions, and nice tile. If nothing else, they went a bit overboard with the decorating. 

The service here is very friendly, prompt, and helpful. I observed a table nearby asking what just about everything on the menu was like, and the lady serving that table was very patient and explained everything in detail, described how it was prepared, and what it tasted like. I knew what I wanted coming in, so I didn't get a chance to \"test\" the server, but I'm sure he was just as good. 

I really enjoyed my Bun Thit Nuong Cha Gio, as the pork had a delicious lime like marinade to it, and the egg rolls were crisp and fresh tasting. They are very generous with the portion sizes, and they should be for what they are charging. They definitely tacked on a dollar to their prices probably to pay for those fancy televisions and the new tile floors. My one bowl with no sides, drinks, or appetizers, was $11 after tip. Outrageous. I wanted Goi Cuon, but an order of two was $5.75! I also wanted a beer, just to say I had a beer with my Vietnamese, as most places don't serve it. Well, the beer would have been $4, making lunch here for one with a beer, an appetizer, and a main about $22 after tax and tip. 

Would it be worth it? Probably not considering all of the place which cost slightly more than half of what Pho Van charges. Want to introduce someone to Vietnamese? Take a casual client out to lunch somewhere relatively nice? Maybe really want a beer with lunch? Pho Van is great. Want to have an inexpensive lunch and don't care about atmosphere, but rather just good quality food? Probably not a good bet. Your wallet will hate you here."}
{"text":"None better!  As a self proclaimed connoisseur of Thai food, this place rates among the best I've found.  Food, decor, service ... EXCELLENT!  Wish it were close to home."}
{"text":"What has happened to this place?! We have been coming to this place for pho for the last 2-3 years and even got to know 1 of the cooks before he left. Honestly when he left the pho didn't taste right and we moved on to another place nearby for pho. Recently we came back and was disappointed for the last time. There was no improvement on the pho and the price was outrageous for a small bowl of pho. Pho Vietnam here we come."}
{"text":"Good, fresh and affordable Vietnamese food.  Owner and chef, Jimmy, takes pride in his menu.  The waitresses and friendly, helpful and efficient.  I had soup and a coconut juice to drink.  I'll go back soon!"}
{"text":"New, clean and tasteful decor, plasma screens on every wall.  Friendly staff, I was impressed, now for the food.  

For an appetizer  we had the fried tofu which was served with a peanut dipping sauce, nice.  I think I had bun thit cha gio or something like that (no. 22) rice angel-hair noodles with beef,  shrimp and a chicken spring roll which I broke up and tossed all together with the  light rice-wine dressing.  It was superb - fresh quality ingredients and perfectly prepared.  My dining mate had a beef curry stew served with french bread to dip in the gravy, yumm, great choice!   No liquor license yet, a Vietnamese beer would have sent me over the edge.  As it was the iced jasmine tea did very well.
As soon as I finished my meal I was making plans to return.  The bill - $28.   I'm asking myself why cook?"}
{"text":"Best place for phÃ² in Phoenix. Jimmy the owner made us feel welcome and taken care of. I had my usual phÃ² ga, my wife had the number 29 dish with chicken. Both great. And to top it off a pot of tea. Highly recommend this place for anyone who is looking for authentic Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"Does not disappoint! See my tip, but with array if choices in area this wins! Great flavor, service, clean, crisp and so fresh!! Did I mention the good flavor?? Go for it!"}
{"text":"I have been frequenting Pho Van for over a year. Initially I came for the Pho, but through the reviews and encouragement of the staff I have tried and subsequently loved a multitude of other dishes on the menu. Additionally, this is definitely one of my 12 year old daughters favorite places to go!  The staff is very friendly. On multiple occasions I have observed a new customers come in and sheepishly look over the menu and the owner or other staff member will walk them through the menu, explain the dishes and make thoughtful recommendations. All leave noticeably happy. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Well for 10 bucks you get 4 pieces of meat with your pho. And the meat is at least a couple of days old. The soup is super super salty!!!! It is an insult to my taste buds, to say the least! Really it is a rip off! Do not go here! If you think this place is actually good then you have no idea what the fuck what is pho is suppose to taste like!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great Pho, I get the# 10. Eye round and brisket.  I do like it better than Saigon Pho, and when you're done, head over to the Boba Tea House for a refreshing dessert drink"}
{"text":"Great place to get pho or your favorite Vietnamese dishes! 

Today I got the chicken fried rice with pho!

Can't go wrong with Vietnamese food..."}
{"text":"3-28-16 I just got back from an out of town trip and was totally hungry for something good, refreshing and wanting to see that good looking charming JIMMY too. I went for BBH this time, for the drink I asked for Tamerind Ice Tea but changed my mind and went straight up for  A Tsing Tao, glad I did. Can't go wrong BBH and Tsing Tao. As always, Jimmy came over with his Charming smile and a new opening joke. His present was trully maDE my trip to Phovan complete
Thank you Jimmy for making me feel special each time we come to PHOVAN"}
{"text":"The food was ok here, kinda pricy compare to other Vietnamese restaurants. I actually have my favorite Vietnamese restaurants but decided to give it a try. I think I will never go back."}
{"text":"Me and my wifey decided to give it a shot ..on a recommendation from a friend 
we decided to try it out for lunch
Noticed a young but hip crowd enjoying lunch not to busy
we were greeted by a young guy  who sat  us and brought out menus 
a young girl came out and took drink orders my wife had a hot tea and i had cold green tea
we both ordered Pho i ordered the #15. Pho BÃ² viÃªn 
Pho with Meatballs  
and my wife the #14. Pho TÃ¡i ChÃ­n  
Pho with Eye round & Brisket 

food took a bit long to come out  but it was well worth it. Broth was tasty plenty of garnishes ..
have been back twice had the #10. Pho ?c Bit 
Pho with Brisket, Eye round, Flank, Meat Balls, Tendon and Tripe
 so good ..recommend it to a couple of friends.
moderately priced.."}
{"text":"Very average pho. I am biased since my mother makes amazing pho and it just doesn't compare. Pros are that it seems to be super clean and the owner seems to care but after being here for more than a few times, it's not my go to spot for Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"They lost me. I went in about 2 weeks ago with the family. We were seated, but no water or menus delivered for about 10 minutes though I saw 2 servers look at me. It was hot as balls out too, we were damn thirsty. Hot soup on a hot day you ask? Ya, we crazy like that. We had to get up and ask for water and menus! Then the wifey and I ordered.. soup and eggrolls. Soup came. No eggrolls. I was done but my wife made me try one more time a week later. On that last visit.. one lil baby piece of pork blood in my soup is what put me over the edge. C'mon you cheap phoks! My other spot's blood game on fleek. Skimpin on the product, and bad customer service is why I am done here. Peace blood."}
{"text":"check mic, one-two..I am one mo fo' that loves her pho and this place is da bomb jus' so ya kno and the prices are super low! ( ya like that ish huh?!)

but for real there is nothing like a wonderful bowl of pho and this place has it. Wonderful soup with all the extra normal trimmings and its always more than i can eat in one sitting(leftovers are my lunch today ..hurry up 1pm!!)

Staff is friendly and service is quick. Also have tried the egg rolls which are very good and the b/f who is a short rib enthusiast says this place has the best ones he has yet to come across. so from pho to even mo'  Pho Van is spot on!"}
{"text":"Pho is good, spring rolls are tasty, but the service is slow. I've been here many times, and each time I have a rather long wait to be seated, place my order, and to get the check. Not a big deal though because I don't go when I'm in a hurry. I go back because the pho is delicious, it's close to home, and the price is reasonable."}
{"text":"Yea......what can I say about this place....not much. The egg noodle soup was okay at best...skimping on the shrimp. My gf had the vermicelli...which was okay. Now do not get the crepes...it is horrible....it is just looks like a omelette filled with sprouts...crap. the spring rolls were not that tasty either. I think the main issue is the veggies used tasted funny.
Try another place and plus the customer service isn't great and girls need to put on some smiles. Yeesh...pathetic excuse for a Vietnamese place."}
{"text":"I love this place! Whenever my hubby and I are craving Pho we always come here. We're definitely open to trying other places and have but the broth here has so much flavor! I debate if I should add anything cause it's so tasty. 

The staff is very sweet and always checking in on us and recommending different things. A new favorite that we just tried were the egg rolls! So good with the dipping sauce - an absolute must."}
{"text":"I tried many different places for pho in chandler. This place is by far the best. Why? The service I get from the people who work here never disappoints me. When it comes to pho I tend to look for the flavor in their broth. Their broth here isn't the best but it's tasty enough to beat all of the ones I've experienced everywhere in chandler. It's quite good. I also always order their rice dishes and spring rolls with the peanut sauce. Ahhh thinking about it just makes me hungry. Their Thai tea is good as well and I love how they always check up on me to see how's the food taste. I'll always be back here every time I am nearby. : )"}
{"text":"This is the only Pho we'll eat - just the best around. The owner is super nice and funny - he really makes us want to keep coming back. Everything we've ever tried here has been excellent, and they're always adding new things to the menu. LOVE this place."}
{"text":"I always like it when I am the only Caucasian in a crowded restaurant.  This place rocks.  Nothing was greasy, which is great. Loved e food, the service was fine."}
{"text":"Jimmy was such a gracious host to my family and friends when we came in last night.  The food, OMG it is hands down the best in town, I am pretty picky with how I like my food and every time, they pay close attention to detail and nail it every time.  The spring rolls are best in town, the Pho soup is by far better than anyone else's, but Jimmy is what pushes them to 5 stars for me.  He spent 10 minutes explaining dishes and going into detail about what is in the dish (which was great for our friends as it was their first time eating Vietnamese food), and they loved every bit of it.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!"}
{"text":"They have reduced their menu greatly. On serve a small portion of Pho along with two other items. I used to love their Vietmanese Stew, but no longer is it served. It, along with other items are now blacked out with a marker."}
{"text":"Clean pho, great meat options..

To be fair I came in when it was 116 outside and my fever probably matched, so the magical elixir that is fresh lemonade and pho was a must have.

It seems like a family run establishment which I love (support local businesses!) And the layout was clean and interesting.  Service was great and attentive,  which usually can be hit or miss in a pho spot.

Seems they even have a karaoke set up for special nights or occasions, my fever was not high enough on that day to get me to find out.

Side note: saw they offer crawfish now so if you want to grab some rather than hitting say, an angry crab you can get it here as well."}
{"text":"Banh Mi Bo Kho.  Simply the best!!! It's exactly how like it.  Tender beef with tasty broth."}
{"text":"We walked in in the clean place that has a beautiful fish tank as well as three TV that plays sports.  I was initially refused a seat (later found out that no one was seating there and I wanted to watch Wimbledon).  E.g. You will never refuse a seat to any customer unless it has been reserved and especially when you can partition those seat.  Those seats were later offered.  No drink menu were offered (drinks and appetizers are one the highest grossing items on the menu-sales opportunity loss there) and I had to ask for it.  I've order Gui Cong (the presentation were excellent and delicious)..Major fail was the Pho..The broth is less flavorful than many that I've experienced and it truly tasted like water (proper way has to be done under at least 10-24 hours pasteurization and remove the sediments on top periodically).  I have asked for the bean sprouts to be boiled but they forgot to do so.  Since the soup is already low quality, I know I had to add several condiments (chili paste as well as fish sauce to save it but it didn't since the broth didn't have enough bone marrow flavor into it) at this point I had a feeling the servers were probably annoyed by my requests so I didn't bother.  The service were spotty but the owner initially refused my 10% yelp check in bonus and he reluctantly did it for me.  So many mishaps..I know that I will have better experience elsewhere."}
{"text":"The food is great. I went pretty basic and had the chicken pho and spring rolls. Our order was tasty and perfect. The not so great part was the service. You walk in and you don't know whether to wait to be seated or sit down and the staff just stared at us. We sat down and it took a while for them to even come and take our order. It was the same way when I came back the next time for take out. The staff was very inattentive. Not good."}
{"text":"I made a take out order from here & the gentle man who answering the phone was ver friendly but was trying to tell me depending on the delivery, the vegetables could be fresh or maybe not. They have no control over how the get the vegetables. I ordered at 10:15ish & picked up around 10:30ish.
I get a call from a lady (maybe the owner) around 12:30 stating I didn't pick up my pho. Explained I picked up around 10:30. She insisted I picked it up from the other pho restaurant in the same complex. I sincerely apologized if I made a mistake. She then says how I ate the bad pho & that her pho is much better & no other restaurant can compare pho with her's. Insisted I return the pho & come eat her pho.  I can understand where she stands but this all happened 2 hours later. I guess she was expecting me hold on to my food & not eat it. Very rude the way she said it, I thought! I wouldn't go just because of her attitude."}
{"text":"Makin' it rain pig blood like it was Carrie's prom night!

I do love me a nice big bowl of bun bo hue on a chilly evening.  Since it was raining cats and dogs Friday night,  we decided to go get some Vietnamese food before it got too warm for hot soup!  The dinner companions ordered their own pho, some spring rolls, and banh xeo to share but I was too star-struck with my giant bowl of red-colored Heaven.

Sour, spicy, and oh so lemongrassy!  Even though I've never seen bun bo hue so red before, I decided to take a bite and it was bliss.  Admittedly they do go stingy with the pork blood, offering one dinky cube when other places pop in at least two, and the pork knuckle was given away so I didn't try it but the soup was flavorful and fragrant.  I ate every bite and drank most of my soup before the MSG and salt got a bit too much for me.  The spring rolls were also delicious especially with the peanut sauce and the banh xeo seemed to contain mostly bean sprouts.  I'd probably skip on the banh xeo next time.  The #10 pho with eye round and brisket was stated to be excellent with an aromatic broth that didn't even need hoisin sauce.  Great dinner!

The restaurant itself is spacious and clean and the owner is super friendly along with the staff.  While the prices are on the higher end for the portion given, this is Chandler so don't be thinking you can get those Phoenix prices here.  The quality is there though.  Nonetheless, I'll be back for more bun bo hue!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time yesterday due to it being in my girlfriends area(I'm in n.phoenix) and was eager to try another pho place. My only complaint about this place which is kinda minor was the somewhat lack of service as in filling the water and seeing if we were alright, and we received our appetizer after our pho had came out which was weird. Other than that the food was great, starting with the spring rolls while our soups cooled down to reasonable eating temps. The rolls tasted very fresh and the peanut sauce was pretty much on point and didn't need much else except for a little squirt of sriracha. I ordered the #10 in a large bowl that came with meatballs, round eye, brisket, tendon and tripe I believe and all the ingredients tasted fresh and the broth was super tasty. After a few squirts of sriracha in the bowl I devoured every drop of it. The manager came to talk to us for a little bit and was surprised to see that I had a bowl of pho with a bottle of sriracha tattooed on my neck and wanted to take a picture of it, which I obliged. Also the Thai cafe coffee was delicious also. I would definitely return here to eat and recommend it to others."}
{"text":"They were so kind to me.. I can in sick and they made me a special tea and hot pho. Still sick today and going back for the tea and pho!"}
{"text":"Came in and the waiters were all sitting down at a table eating with customers sitting at other tables enjoying their meal. Didn't think much of it at the time but definitely rude. Regardless we were sat down at a pretty reasonable time and given menus. We were ready to order within minutes and we were never offered water. We waited patiently for a few minutes and a new customer came in and was sat next to us. His order was taken and his food came out and still no one had come by to take our order or even offer us a drink. Definitely one of the worst restaurant experiences I've had. Will not go back. Definitely set the wrong first impression."}
{"text":"Friendly and fast service, the pho is delicious, and a relaxing atmosphere.  Definitely coming back and definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I really don't like giving bad reviews and I've had my fair share of delicious and really bad tasting pho. Today I came here with my family and ordered a pho chin (brisket) and my mom got the seafood pho... my goodness I might as well have gotten noodles in a bowl of plain water. The broth was disappointingly bland even with sriracha and hoysen sauce... we seriously had to reach for the salt. The noodles were kinds hard... Maybe it was an off day for them but I probably won't be back"}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is super fresh, the pho (which is ridiculously popular, I always see bowls and bowls of it at other tables) is light and delicious, and the #22 and #40 (my and my boyfriend's favorites) are always superb. Nom nom nom."}
{"text":"Great Service and good food. Owner is super friendly. Beautiful decoration and their Pho is one of the best in the valley."}
{"text":"the broth was too sweet for me. perhaps just personal taste though."}
