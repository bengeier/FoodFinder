{"text":"Forenzos Pizza was literally the worst thing I've ever experienced. It even looked sad and pathetic. 0 stars don't waste your money"}
{"text":"The choices are okay. Mostly mom and pop places, which is nice to see. The Chinese dim sum place here is very authentic, and they serve boba which is a plus. The Mexican place is amazing! They do charge extra for use of credit or debit however. Even if you're not feeling something homemade, they do have chain restaurants including panda express, subway, and dairy Queen. I usually am not disappointed with the food I get here. The main thing wrong with it is that it is a ghost town for one, and two there are TVs playing obnoxious music all around, which makes it hard to have a one on one conversation here. The place is a bit outdated, but at least it is comfortable and they have free WiFi."}
{"text":"I was pretty impressed with at least parts of this Food Court.  There are some chain stands like Subway, Panda Express, Cinnabon, Sbarro, a grilled subs place, some Japanese food that looks like a chain, Chinese, pizza, Hot Dogs on a Stick chain, a classic hamburger place, Orange Julius (which I always loved but it's gotten so expensive).  

My favorite place from when I was in the area two years ago was a really good Mediterranean restaurant but it's a Mexican place now.  

Saving the best for last, there are three additions I really like.  One is Julie's Chicken and Waffles which I ate at yesterday and intend to go back to.  Both the chicken legs and waffle we're delicious!  They serve breakfast items till noon and that is what I'll try to get next time.  On the way in the food court a lady offered me a catfish sample from the Catfish place and nearly succeeded in waylaying me from the chicken place because the sample was so good!  I will definitely be eating there soon.  And where the pretzel place used to be there is now a Mexican ice cream and drinks stand that looked very interesting.  I love fresh fruit Aguas Frescas and am anxious to see if they make them.  My favorite place on Country Club Dr., Flor de Michuacan (sp?) has closed so I was needing to find a new placeam to buy those.

The food court hours are the same as the mall, Mon-Sat 10-9, Sun 11-6..  The only problem I had was I went on a Sunday and five minutes after I sat down with my piping hot chicken a security guard came up and told meme they were locking the doors in 15 minutes and it was hard to rush thru my food when it wasn't even cooled off enough to eat.  All in all I still enjoyed my meal and plan to go back!"}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with all of the food selections. I had read prior reviews in Yelp thinking that some of the selections would be interesting and more tasty. After eating here I looked at those reviews again and see that they are very old and all the restaurants that were recommended are no longer here."}
{"text":"This place is dead and doesn't know it! We ate at Forenzo's Pizza and they had the pizza under the warmer but didn't bother to toss it in the oven to re-heat the cheese like other places (Sbarro). The cheese was coagulated on the pizza to the point of being stiff like rigor-mortis! Flavor itself was so so. Sauce was decent and had the cheese been melted this might have been a different review. The texture of it was hard to get past. I gave 2 stars instead of one because the atmosphere isn't bad and they have a subway and a Panda and one can't go too wrong with those in a pinch."}
