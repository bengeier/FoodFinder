{"text":"I've had the Carnitas Tacos twice here and they are really good! Second time round I had the hot sauce on them and that certainly left the mouth burning. I've also tried the Steak Tortas and that is really tasty too. Service is quick, and food is cheap. All the construction workers in the area use this truck and there is often a steady line of custom. Good little street food truck."}
{"text":"Ever since the closure of El Desmadre (which was *by far* the best Mexican food in Chambana) I'd been mourning the lack of acceptable mexican fare near campus. I used to live in Mexico, so I really can't deal with the revolting midwesternized mess at Dos Reales. Los Amigos filled a taco shaped hole in my heart.  I've had their tacos (chicken), torta (chicken milanesa), and vegetarian burrito, all of which are pretty good. I recommend the horchata, which is the perfect accompaniment for spicy food. This is definitely one of the more authentic places in town (along with El Charro and Los Mariachis).  The reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 is  a) the TV is a slight annoyance and  b) Once I went and the only chicken they had was milanesa, and they were out of chiles rellenos as well. It might have been a one-off thing, since it didn't happen any other time."}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican food, FINALLY. I've been on a mission to find food like back home (SoCal) and after driving out as far as Henderson to all these little hole in the walls... I end up finding this truck not too far from my house! I've had carnitas, chicken, and pastor tacos and an asada burrito... All amazing."}
{"text":"All I can say is WOW!! I have been to a few taco trucks in my day, and this is the tastiest, fastest, and most yummy food your buck. Literally. I order two chicken tacos with cilantro, no onion. NORMALLY, I get just that, two little chicken tacos with only cilantro, and usually at least after 10 minutes of waiting. Not here at Los Amigos. The woman that works the window is so sweet, and just kept asking if I want to add cheese, lettuce, sour cream, guacamole. I was pleasantly surprised, and said please. She also asked if I wanted chips and beans on the side. I was like, WHAT?! Yes, please. While I was standing there talking to her, I grabbed a package of cookies for my 4 year old. I asked her what the total was, I brought a $20 bill. She replied, that will be $4 please. I was in shock. I paid, and of course tipped. And then the cook, who I think is her Dad, hands her my plate so she can cover it in foil so I can go. The portion for these two chicken tacos is amazing, and the chips and beans, in under 3 minutes...come on!!Unreal, and I will be going back tomorrow!!"}
{"text":"So I've decided that El Charro, Los Amigos and El Torero will be my hold-over until I can go back to Los Angeles/San Diego--land of taco trucks, places ending in -ertos, and un lugar donde puedo hablar en espanol, damnit--for Christmas.    Amigos is pretty chill.  I had a delicious Torta Milanesa (Pollo), with just the right amount of cheese, avocado, and chicken.  The staff was quite friendly, and the while the service was slow, my torta DID come with a free Coke.  And my standards are occasionally low, so that garnered its fourth star.  I'll probably have to reassess after a second and third visit, but so far I haven't been let down."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat for Mexican food in Champaign. All of their menu items are great and the staff is really friendly. Great eats whether sober or late night eats after going out."}
{"text":"I'm surprised this place isn't more popular. It's a bit more expensive than campus-favorite Dos Reales, but it is worth it. I personally love the tacos. The meat is delicious and wonderfully spicy and the tortillas are homemade. I highly recommend the chorizo.   Dine-in is marred by the presence of a TV set to annoying Univision shows, so consider take-out."}
{"text":"Place was great! Food and service were solid. Good portions and authentic items, too. It's worth the drive if it's out of the way for you or if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Los Amigos is the best Mexican place around Green Street. They're not amazing but way, way better than the other fare. I have had only tortas and burritos but their meat is very quality; the chicken burrito I had today was pretty perfect, just the right balance of juicy chicken to avocado, rice, sour cream, and beans. The chorizo isn't amazing and I really wish they had carnitas; Fiesta Cafe is like the only place in Chambana that has it. The only problem with this place is that it's sort of expensive, relative to how much food you get (the burritos are maybe 30% smaller than La Bamba's, say) and the room itself is crowded and uncomfortable. The last couple times I've been there it seems like their air conditioning is broken. I would either order pick up or just get food to go."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican food that I've ever had in Las Vegas.  In my top two of all-time Mexican food that I have had.  My number one is in Southern California. Turn on Deer Springs from Haulapai . It will be on your left hand side, about 100 yards from the intersection. They are there Monday-Saturday 10am-2:30pm."}
{"text":"Restaurants don't appear to stick around very long on this little section of Green St., so I'm hoping this place stays. There are other places you could go to for Mexican food that are closer to campus, but everything here is so fresh and yummy, not to mention you'd be supporting the nice guys who run the place."}
{"text":"First tried this food truck out years ago when the Providence area had yet to be \"providence\". They were always parked at the corner of Deer Springs and Hualapai. Coming off the 215 you can't miss 'em. As they've been building and building, they have had to move around. Usually I'd still find them along Deer Springs Way.  I took my mom here last month and she loved it! Their tacos are well seasoned, fresh, and pretty filling. I spent 7 bucks on 2 chicken tacos, 2 carnitas, and a can of coke. It doesn't really matter how much tacos you get...beans, cheese, and chips are complimentary addition onto your plate which I think is a cool addition to have.   The lady who takes your order isn't the perkiest, but isn't rude at all. Their menu are in Spanish and they don't have prices. Just ask. I seen this guy get an order of French fries so apparently that serve that too...but I wouldn't know because I can't speak or read Spanish for the life of me. I just know what kind of meat I like in my tacos so that's as far as espanol as I can get. Lol.  Last week I was having a serious Jonez for some tacos and with the hubby home...we decided to take a drive up to the food truck. But they weren't there?!?!? They're always there!! I drove around as much as I thought it'd be worth to...but decided to head home for.option B. Actually, I didn't have an option B but whatever. I'm not sure if they were off that day (tuesday) or they have finally decided to park elsewhere after years of being in that vicinity.   If it was just an off day and you are in the vicinity, it's definitely worth it. She'll ask you mild or hot. I opted for a hot and wholly guacamole I thought I was going to have to buy tucks later. But my spicy tolerance isn't highly tolerable unlike some people.   We usually scarf our food down in the car. It makes the experience more fun. Besides, I'm not huge on ordering \"to-go\" if my drive is more than 10mins until home. Nothing like soggy sweaty food. Okay, rambling over   Definitely recommend if you're in a mexican lunch wagon kind of mood or just craving for some authentic home style mexican food."}
