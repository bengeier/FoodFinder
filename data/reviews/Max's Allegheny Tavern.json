{"text":"Quaint spot on a back street in the North Side.  Very polite service, and delicious food at a great value.  Will definitely go back for authentic German fare."}
{"text":"Terrible. Being of German Heritage, this is far from Good Food, let alone good German. The Schnitzel was tough and over cooked. Potato Pancakes cold and bland, Spatzle soggy and tasteless, Red Cabbage , way too much vinegar. Totally Disappointing, especially when I got the bill.  If there is a Chef in the kitchen, he has given up on trying to cook."}
{"text":"Went here for my wife's work party. I used to live in Austria & have had lots of German food & drink. Food is definitely an \"Americanized\" version - but still very good. Drinks are good - but what kept me from giving this 5 stars was truly authentic imported German beer. Still - they have done their best. Friendly staff - even children friendly - yet still a proper bar. Danke und ausgezeichnet!"}
{"text":"Went back beginning of February, this time took my a work colleague who was traveling with me on a business trip. Max's rang true yet again. They had a good selection of local beers on tap, and the food was great. We both went for the sampler plates, and were not disappointed. If you are on the North Shore definitely check out Max's it is worth it."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Max;;s for their local flair, real German food, and authentic Pittsburgh feeling. They did not sell out, are not overly commercialized, and should be supported for the long standing quality service to the city. Thanks, Max's."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to go when I'm in the steel city.  The atmosphere is awesome and the staff is very friendly.  The beer sampler and Ruben is a solid choice but they also have a wide range of other options including hasenfefer and Wiener schnitzel."}
{"text":"I have a confession to make........the thing I like most about Max's is their bread!!! They are free....they are fresh made....hot and soft...different kinds....and so so delicious! I'm not a big fan of German food, but it's just my personal taste. The portions are large and atmosphere is very relaxing and casual. I like it."}
{"text":"I've been going to Max's since I was a kid in 1973..was the best food then and now. Introduced my wife to it and she's hard to please. She loved it so much that we had our wedding reception there in the Ratskeller. Can't recommend it enough"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, wonderful service and really great food. My husband and I shared the Brat sandwich and the sampler with schnitzel Lichtenstein, sauerbraten and something with an 'l' that I can't remember the spelling of (ground loaf)....all were excellent. We had the sauerkraut and spatzle, and cabbage as sides. The bread brought out before the meal included apple butter and sweet & sour relish (cabbage) and those were excellent too. Would love the sweet & sour relish in a side size portion it is so delicious. The red dining room is nicely decorated and love the cuckoo clock that is reminiscent of my grandmother's. The beer out of the mason jar is a fun touch.  Our bill came to $29 (1 beer, 1 diet coke for our drinks) and it was a fabulous meal for so little."}
{"text":"I took my boyfriend, a German-food enthusiast, to Max's Allegheny Tavern last night. We had been looking forward to a night out together for a while.   I think the food was good, but it's hard to say, because all I could focus on was the LOUD -- and I mean LOUD -- woman seated behind my boyfriend and me.  Her profanity-laden discussion with her dining partners was so bad that for the first time in my life, I turned around and asked a fellow restaurant patron to take the volume down a few notches.   The restaurant was almost empty; I have no idea why the host chose to seat a loud party of five next to a couple having a quiet dinner."}
{"text":"Not only does this place have a very nice atmosphere, the food is good (and cheap) too! For under 10 dollars a person we each got: -A drink -A Bradtwurst sausage -2 giant potato pancakes, served with sourcream (note that these are NOT latkes) -A huge bowl of saurkraut, which also contained some pork and cranberries. Delicious home-baked bread, which was served with some saurkraut (prepared differently than the side) and apple-butter sauce.  YUM!  It's hard not to like this place. I'm still having cravings for those pancakes :("}
{"text":"I go to Max's all the time and usually try something different. I think it is the most authentic German restaurant in Pittsburgh and is reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Visiting from San Francisco. Food was mediocre at best. Bland is the best description.  Sausages and  Weiner Schmitzel were unremarkable. Best was the sweet & sour cabbage that accompanied. But also served were over-boiled 'daily vegetable' of snap peas, asparagus, and red peppers.... to the point that they were losing their color. Good beer. Yes it has old photos of days gone by... but really there seemed no joy here now..."}
{"text":"I love this place.  The atmosphere, the bartenders, the waitresses and most of all the food. The potato pancakes are delicious as are all their soups. I think there is something for everyone here. Their desserts are all delicious. We eat here before most concert or sporting event."}
{"text":"We are from North Carolina, and were in PGH visiting. We wanted some German food, and read about this place, and decided to try it. IT WAS FABULOUS! The food was EXCELLENT, and the atmosphere was pretty cool. HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!"}
{"text":"Max's was good, but I've had better.  The restaurant is located in a tired part of town. It isn't in a bad area, but I'm not sure how I would feel eating there after dark. When you walk in you walk through the tavern portion of the restaurant, which is dark and gloomy. We were escorted to the rear of the tavern, which is covered in B&W pictures from the 40's, which gives it a old world tired feeling.  The menu choices were standard faire for a true german restaurant. I had Max's Goulash, which said it came with spaetzle, but it is piled in the bottom of the bowl and not on the side, which was okay. The goulash was too vinegary for my tastes, but it was okay.  My wife's Jaeger Schnitzel was good, but I've had better at Das Wald Cafe (http://www.yelp.com/biz/das-waldcafe-newport-news)."}
{"text":"I must of been eating at another Max's in a pararell universe!  Food was terriable, service was worse! Went and got Sushi!"}
{"text":"Greatest place in Pittsburgh for German food!!  My favorite dinner here is Max's Goulash.  Its a great beef stew with spaetzle and you can get potato pancakes on the side.  The potato pancakes are, without a doubt, the best in Pittsburgh!!  While the food is fantastic, the staff and customer service is what keeps this place from being really excellent.  Its a very \"come as you are\" sort of place and rightfully so as it's a tavern/restaurant but the staff may take the casual nature of the restaurant a little too seriously.  One evening about a year ago, I went in for dinner.  I originally thought to sit at a wooden booth in the bar and there was only 1 open, the last towards the back.  I sat down and the seat completely collapsed on me!  I'm far from what you'd call \"fat\" \"heavy set\" or even a \"big girl\" and the staff just sort of stared at me as though it were my fault that their booth just fell apart, the bartender even laughed at me while I tried to get up.  No one asked if I was ok, no one asked if I needed help and I was generally ignored as I tried to pull myself to my feet.  *I* had to approach the hostess, tell her that the booth had just collapsed and ask to be reseated.  She rolled her eyes at me and told me the dining room was full so I'd have to wait.    Ok, understandable... could you offer a drink or a manager or something while I waited considering the fact that your booth just broke apart?  The entire incident was either completely ignored by staff, like it never happened or I was looked at like it was my fault.  I didn't even get so much as an apology!  I've been back a couple of times since then because the food is always good but I always sit in the dining room now which is sort of a shame because I actually like the bar atmosphere better.    Luckily for me though, their menu is online and they offer take out.  Unfortunately, they have the hostess answering those phone calls and since she's not a server, she doesn't have a lot of knowledge about the menu.  When I asked for a total, I was put on hold for a couple of minutes.  She finally came back and I asked how long and was put on hold again so she could go ask the kitchen.  She was quite rude about it, like I was bothering her.  Bottom line: Max's *is* the best place for German food in Pittsburgh, hands down.  But, the food is the only thing you're going for.  The staff could use some help on customer service."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant on the Northside, possibly favorite restaurant in all of Pittsburgh.  I tell all my friends that this little restaurant is the best kept secret in Pittsburgh.  Max's is a quaint little German place that always has plenty of seating, even on Friday and Saturday nights.  The service is good.  The food is great, I always end up getting the potato pancakes.  If you are looking for a place to check out that isn't going to be as crowded and will be more \"authentic\" German food than other places you should definitely come to Max's!"}
{"text":"Max's is great. It feels like your German grandmothers house and the service matches this feeling. The food is authentic and inexpensive. If you are not too familiar with German food, just ask and the waitress will walk you though the favorites.  I love the sausages and the stuffed pretzels are amazing, but the Apple Fritter is the greatest thing ever."}
{"text":"Max's is AMAZING.  Extremely reasonably priced for the quality and amount of food you get.  They serve you a variety of bread with homemade relish and apple butter - absolutely scrumptious! They have a wide variety of authentic German food, and you can't go wrong with anything you choose!"}
{"text":"Excellent German food.  I went in for an early lunch, the service was great.  Had a whole feast of great dishes.  The best sauerkraut i've ever had -- subtle, with caraway.  Sweet and sour cabbage, potato salad, spaetzle, a great weisswurst, and a great wheat beer on tap."}
{"text":"I wasn't excited about Max's when I first walked in. There were no servers in evidence and I wandered through the entire restaurant looking for an employee to seat me before finally asking the bartender to help. After that, though, things definitely improved. I loved the slightly shabby, old-world vibe. The old photos on the wall were interesting, and the menu slash old newspaper was a pretty cute presentation.   We got appetizers for dinner, and my favorite by miles was the potato pocket with grilled onions on top. (Basically a pierogi.) So good. So, so good. I actually wasn't as excited about the potato pancakes as I expected - maybe because I was expecting more of a latke style flavor profile? Not sure. We also got the stuffed pretzels - total heart attack on a plate - in a good way! I loved that everything we got came with dipping sauces. So fun.   Overall a positive experience. I'd go back."}
{"text":"We have been frequenting Max's for the past 10 years.  I always enjoyed coming here because it reminded me of my Grandma, right down to the cinnamon apple garnish.  Our last couple of visits have left us unimpressed, and our most recent visit will unfortunately be our last.  This place is literally just gross.  From bar menus which are sticky, beer sampler holder which is sticky, and food menus with cup rings on them to food which is literally inedible.  I ordered the Schnitzel Lichtenstein (my go-to) and it was greasy, fatty, oddly colored meat.  The Brussel Sprout in a Bacon Sauce served soggy sprouts and didn't have any of the bacon sauce on it.  The Spatzle was luke warm.  This would be a great place for one of those \"Kitchen Nightmare\" shows.  So sad to see Max's Allegheny Tavern has gone downhill."}
{"text":"I have eaten here many times in the last 27 years, and I must say I have never had a bad meal here.  The Reuben is good, as is the Turkey Reuben, which is served between 2 potato pancakes instead of bread.  The Beefeater Sandwich is always a good bet.  The beef is always tender, and never fatty or grisly.  For the times when I'm a bit more hungry, I get the Wienerschnitzel.  Try the German Potato Salad and/or the Sweet and Sour Cabbage.  And don't forget dessert.  The desserts are homemade by the owner's wife."}
{"text":"Max's is one of the best bars in town. I can't speak so much for the restaurant, but the food I order and have served in the bar area is great! The service is always awesome. The bar atmosphere is solid.  The bartenders have a heavy pour.  The stuffed pretzels are a must have! I actually like the fact that the area hasn't been revitalized because the atmosphere might change.  So I will enjoy this place until that day happens!"}
{"text":"My sister in law was in town and we decided to get brunch. Looked up local places and this had a good review...though I have no idea how. The Restarunt is small, the booths are tiny and the food was nearly inedible. The only good part was the bacon, which was ok at best. Avoid at all costs"}
{"text":"authentic german cuisine. Love the schnitzels and the red cabbage"}
{"text":"Best German food I've ever had. Hubby and I stopped here thinking we'd just have a few beers and grab a bite to eat, but we were surprised to say the least.   Everything is made in house, which is enough to win me over. We started with the sausage and cheese plate, paired with the bread basket. Homemade honey mustard, gouda, Swiss, and the best kielbasa we've ever had the pleasure to bite into. Just as we're polishing off our plate and rubbing our full stomachs, our entrees came.   The schnitzel was to die for, as was the rabbit, both smothered in homemade mushroom gravy. The sauerkraut was a perfect combination of savory and acidic. The potato pancakes topped with homemade applesauce and some sour cream were just... Wow.   I would definitely recommend getting the beer sampler, awesome deal and a great way to try all of their German beers without going overboard. We'll be back, for sure."}
{"text":"I've been going to Max's off and on for 31 years (I KNOW!  How could someone as young as I am been going there for THAT long?)    And I am not from nor ever lived in the North Side!  That said...i have always loved the food and the place.   I was great the first time and was great last night!   Most of the mains can be recommended without reservation....last night I had roasted pork with dressing and gravy.  It was deliscious!    As for sides....I ALWAYS have potato pancakes and sweet and sour cabbage.  (Because of my eastern european background I am partial to both cabbage and potatoes.   Do not be afraid of the cabbage unless you dislike sour!   We didn't have dessert, but did have beer and drinks.   They have a nice selection.  My only complaint was that the food was slow to come out.   It was a busy Friday night and I wasn't going anywhere so I had anover beer.   No big problem.  Give Max's a try.....it might make your favorite like it did mine!"}
{"text":"The food isn't as good as it once was.  The atmosphere is kind of dark and needs to be updated.  We ordered potato pancakes that had to be returned because they somehow tasted fishy (I don't even want to speculate).  The other items we ordered were ok. Staff is great, very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Visited Max's last Friday night with friends who'd come in from out of town. As another reviewer described, the whole experience was 'tired'. Service was very good, however. I was hoping for a more colorful, fresh decor, but everything looks aged and washed out. I just got a very 'blah' vibe as we walked back to our table, and it really had a bad impact on my appetite and perception. I had the Wurst Sampler Platter and it was okay. The potato pancakes were dull...I don't think there was any salt in them. The cheese-stuffed pretzels were very good!  The following day was the 2nd annual Deutschtown Music Festival. The neighborhood is working toward revitalization, and I hope local businesses like Max's will step up their game. I believe the investment will be worth it."}
{"text":"Absolutely love Max's. we had our rehearsal dinner here! They have the best catering for a group and not to mention the best German food. The staff is wonderful!"}
{"text":"Very good old school German American food (nothing innovative here). Was here on a Saturday night and the placed was packed. Really loved the cheddar cheese stuffed deep fried pretzels and the potato pancakes."}
{"text":"My husband and another couple went here for some authentic german food to celebrate Octoberfest and Max's did not disappoint! We arrived at 5:30 on a Saturday and the place was already packed, with only one booth available in the bar area. Everything was delicious, reasonably priced and arrived quickly after ordering. There is something for everyone both food and drink wise. The bratwurst and spatzle with caramelized onions was some of the best I've had, and the spinach salad with hot bacon dressing is one to not be missed. Portions are decent without being gluttonous. For 2 couples along with a couple rounds of craft beers, our bill was $100. If you're looking for authentic German food with an old school Pittsburgh atmosphere, Max's is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Great little find in Pittsburgh!  Bartender waited on us before the lunch crowd arrived.  He tour guided us through the local favorites. Beers on tap were served in mason jars.  Food was prompt and fresh.  I will definitely be in again."}
{"text":"Been coming to Max's for years. Very consistent.   Food is always excellent, beer is always cold.  Pastrami and Swiss was great, but the meal of pork and apple/raisin sauce was out of this world."}
{"text":"5 stars because I accept it for what it is.  Really good German comfort  food with killer drafts.  And the fact that the place has been there for forever makes it super cool.  I love the player piano and put a quarter in every time!  PS. the popcorn at the bar is sooooooooo good too."}
{"text":"A tour of German restaurants in Pittsburgh is surprisingly brief, and it definitely has to contain a stop at Max's. I prefer this place to Penn Brewery. The food seems a little more authentic and I haven't had a bad meal here yet. LOVE the potato pancakes. Every schnitzel I've tried has been great too."}
{"text":"Weg zu gehen!!! Great service - even arriving at 12:10 at lunchtime.   I had the hot pastrami and swiss sandwich. It was outta sight!!!  Delicious. The potato pancakes never disappoint either.  The portion size was perfect.  The menu is huge .. so many choices one can never get tired of dining here.  Ate and received the check in less than an hour... now that's how I like it...   Can't wait to go back.. Thanks Max's Allegheny Tavern ..."}
{"text":"Want a taste of the old ethnic communities of Pittsburgh? Go to Max's Allegheny Tavern. German never tasted sooo nice!  Menu Fav: Potato Pancake Reuben. Forget the bread and wrap your lips around sweet potato pancakes and loads of corned beef. Try the hot potato salad too."}
{"text":"Always great German and regular food. Much better than Hofbrau Haus. This is more authentic. They also have regular fare for those who don't enjoy German food. Other than Teutonia Mannerchor, this is the most authentic German you will find in Western Pa. Cool beer selection and a great Sunday brunch. During Steeler home games they offer a free shuttle to the stadium when you eat here first."}
{"text":"My first real German food experience and I can't wait to go back. Everything was delicious. I had the Max's Sausage Platter. Loved it all. Left nothing in my plate. I was with a big group of people and no one took a doggie bag home. Big menu. The restaurant has this small down home feel to it. The bar is really pretty. Great place."}
{"text":"Old Pittsburgh at its finest.  This place isn't trying to be anything other than what it is  - an excellent old school German restaurant.  The drawback with this restaurant is how crowded and loud it can be during the busy time.  It's much nicer when it's not so busy.  Otherwise, the beer, food and service can't be beat!"}
{"text":"A great place to go for German food! Normally I absolutely love everything about the food here. My favorite item is the potato pancake turkey reuben sandwich, which is prepared with turkey and cole slaw. However, during this visit, the potato pancakes were overcooked and the accompanying German potato salad was served at room temperature. The fish sandwich was large, hot, and delicious. It was accompanied by sweet & sour red cabbage, which tasted great. The server was quite pleasant and efficient, which is normally the case. I will definitely return to this restaurant, because the atmosphere is welcoming and the food is very good."}
{"text":"New German food (non-pork sausage, interpretive sauerkraut, over-engineered potato salad) is on the rise even as Old German (sauerbraten, potato pancakes, leberkese) dries up.  Max's offers some of the best Old German, in one of the coziest old-time settings, in Pittsburgh or anywhere else.    Not every dish is a home run, but the sheer range of the menu is amazing, and the sampler platter is a Deutschophile's dream.  The spatzle were not hand-pulled, but neither were they dried.  The sauerbraten was too thin and under-marinated, but where else can you even find such a dish?  The weisswurst was thin and flecked with parsley, which technically makes it a bockwurst(?), but again, who else even does veal sausage?  Potato pancakes, smoked pork chop, sauerkraut, and red cabbage were all excellent.    I love the apple butter in the bread basket, and the slice of baked apple on the entree plate.  Sure, it's artificially colored, but that's how they did it in the old days.  Black forest cake was pretty weak, but German chocolate cake looks good in other reviews.  The beer selection was an excellent combination of German and domestic, and the mysterious \"Dutch Club dark\" (made in-house?) was uncommonly smooth and delicious.    If you can't deal with anything that's not hip or trendy, stay away.  If you're open to a trip back in time, come!"}
{"text":"Went there in Saturday with my family and we were disappointed. We had been there in over five years. Our last experience was good but this trip will stop all future visits. My daughter ordered the kids burger and it came out overdone and not edible. The waitress even commented that she did not want to serve it but the cook insisted she bring it out. I had a hot pastrami sandwich and my wife had a turkey ruben. The meat on both sandwiches was scarce and my pastrami was so over cooked it was crunchy. Not a good look for pastrami. My wife, who thinks Subway has too much meat on there sandwiches, said more that half of her bread was without meat. Needless to say we will not be going back."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  Authentic, home-made German food that is extra delicious.  Really neat place too!  Potato Pancakes are delicious.  Can't wait to go back.  I would take out of town people here instead of Church Brew any day."}
{"text":"Worst.  Dinner.  Ever. Food from a senior citizens home.  Everything ready in 2 seconds because it sat under a heat lamp.  Avoid at all cost."}
{"text":"Our first time at Max's and we have made plans to go back again soon.  A lousy rainy saturday had us looking for a new place to have a late lunch.  We ordered the potato skins app. And tho it took a little too long to get to the table it was worth the wait. We were enjoying the ambiance and decor of this great old building. The skins were perfect. Gouda cheese with nice crisp bacon and chives. So delicious!  We like to order so that we can share with each other. My husband loves potato pancakes so he got the PP Reuben. The Pot. Cakes were bland but a little S&P fixed that up. Tender corned beef and the slaw was a perfect side.  I chose the Bavarian Club. Never before tasted braunsweiger. It was so delicious I didn't want to share...but I did.  I had to try the sauerkraut for a side. And it was fantastic with chunks of pork mixed in!  I can't believe we managed to eat everything even the potato skins. But it was all so delicious we couldn't stop.  Can't wait to go back. I have to try the spätzle and the goulash!!"}
{"text":"I used to love this place as a kid, so I stopped with my daughter. She really liked the decor, especially the working cuckoo clock. Alexis was our waitress and just absolutely wonderful. Their coffee is fantastic, as well as the bread basket. I had the kielbasa and potato pancakes and my daughter had grilled cheese. Our meals were out quickly and delicious. There was enough food for dinner the next day. We finished the meal with a piece of German chocolate cake. Yummy!"}
{"text":"Max's is a nice German restaurant in the North Side and it has a decent bar too.  I'd much rather go here then a place like the Hofbrauhaus.  Unlike Hofbrauhaus, you won't find live accordion music or dancing on the tables here, but what you will find is a quality German meal.  I say leave places like the Hofbrauhaus to the tourists, I want a real German meal.  I went for lunch this past weekend and had a kielbasa sandwich with sauerkraut on it.  It was very good, exactly what I wanted from a German restaurant and the service was good too.  The food was served with rolls and a side.  I substituted a spinach salad with hot bacon dressing for a side.  I've been to Max's a few times and have been very pleased with both the food and service. I recommend trying the spinach salad with hot bacon dressing, potato pancakes, and the pretzels."}
{"text":"Awesome food, some good-value options (the shared platters and such), super-friendly service, Old World ambiance. Great pre-Pirates/Steelers game stop-off in an old neighborhood (the bar area also looked cool)."}
{"text":"Great food, great beer, ALWAYS great service. This is my girlfriend's and I's favorite bar on the North Side. Consistently good and has a very cozy atmosphere. Get the stuffed pretzels!"}
{"text":"I freaking love this place! Really nice atmosphere (like you are at your old German Grandmother's house). I always go for the Weiner platter with three different kinds of Wursts. Potato Pancakes are a must. Chunky Apple sauce is great. Best German food in Pittsburgh!!!"}
{"text":"Do you know Max & Erma's? Well say hello to just Max (no seriously, Erma sold out.)  Max's specializes in delicious German fare (think Hofbrauhaus, only better) and a delightful atmosphere. This is the type of restaurant that after you go once, you just want to go back again and again. You'll be in the middle of finals and think \"sampler platter please.\" If you're going out in the North Side to catch a game or out to a museum, I highly recommend stopping by Max's to partake in a meal. I have yet to be let down."}
{"text":"Great German food. Wonderful location in an up and coming neighborhood in Pittsburgh. Great attention to detail and to capturing the old world flavor of the menu, but no pretense - a friendly, family oriented and not overly expensive establishment. Highly recommended. Have a bite and walk over to PNC Park for a ballgame - it's minutes away. Great place!"}
{"text":"Folksy, friendly, and seriously helpings of SUBSTANTIAL food. I can't really comment on the German authenticity of the menu, but after a long day as a tourist walking PGH's hilly Northside in the late spring sun, it was a life-affirming experience. Loved the beer selection, as well as the presentation (canning jars).   The decor of this place (vintage neon sign, antique upright piano, worn wooden booths, intricate mosaic tile floor, etc.) invited me in ... this place has been a neighborhood joint for decades, and it's not hard to see why."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere of a neighborhood pub, good German beer selection, but food was less than mediocre.  Won't be back. Weisswurst was very bland.  Sauerbraten was dry and tasteless.  Spaetzle was, well, not tradidional German Spaetzle.  Schnitzel and purple cabbage  were the high points, but then again, it's hard to screw up a fried veal cutlet."}
{"text":"I love Max's when I want German food.  The wait staff can be a bit slow at times but eh it happens.  It just gives me more time to converse with the people I am with.  That is the way the service was when I was in Germany eating at the same style of places.  I like the hands off feel and laid back feel.  If you are a hard core gotta go go go American, this is not the place for you.  The food reminds me of sitting in Staufen Germany at a little Bed and Breakfast's cafe that we stayed at.  Nice friendly feel but they just let you be and check on you occasionally.  I like it and recommend it.  Have taken many friends and family there and they agree.  So if you go, prepare to just relax and spend time with your family.  If you are an entitled American that feels wait staff must wipe your hind quarters and as soon as your drink is half way empty be on it....get a life as the world doesn't revolve around you."}
{"text":"Pretty good!  Wiener Schnitzel was tender and a good size portion. Hot pretzel was soft and hot. A lot better than Haufbrauer especially the ambience. A little pricey though."}
{"text":"This is a MUST on our visits to the Burgh. Love the atmosphere and the food is delicious. Our family has come to Max's over 4 generations. The pierogies are fantastic and honestly, I don't think I've ever had a bad meal here. Lots of great German/polish selections and totally worth the trip."}
{"text":"Max's is one of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh.  It's the Kennywood Thunderbolt of Pittsburgh restaurants.  The Thunderbolt is considered one of the best rollercoasters in the country.  It's not the fastest, it's old, it doesn't have the biggest drops or flip you upside-down.  And yet it's great.  It's classic.  This is Max's Allegheny Tavern.  I'm sure there's better German food with cuter waitresses somewhere out there that doesn't have the decor aesthetics of your grandma's living room.  But who cares.  This place is just right.  Final note, I can't speak for the brunch buffet.  I went in there for the buffet once and decided that my money would be better spent on the menu."}
{"text":"Those of us who had sausage dishes said they were ok. Two of us had Wiener schnitzel and it was awful. Tough and tasteless. Waitress brought us another helping but it was just as bad. Couldn't eat it but they didn't take it off the bill. Potato pancakes were passable.  We decided to go elsewhere for dessert. Would never go back."}
{"text":"Very good food, good atmosphere. Im at the hospital a lot and this place has fed me several times, cold beer, good selection. Patrick is awesome,  very nice. I like it when he waits on me. Pays attention and just has a pleasant personality. Thanks. In this rough time its nice to have a place i want to return to."}
{"text":"decent german food and decent beer.  their party room in the basement is great for very large groups, birthday parties or other types.  i was raised only a few blocks from this place so i've eaten here quite a bit.  i've had most of what's on the menu so it's hard to decide what is best.  very authentic german food and a good neighborhood bar."}
{"text":"For authentic and hearty comfort food, Max's Allegheny tavern does not disappoint. Various types of German sausage, potato salad, and sides are included on a large menu that is sure to please. The potato pancake Reuben is a great idea for your first visit. A wide variety of German beers strengthens the already strong offerings. And decedent desserts round out the menu."}
{"text":"Why you should trust my review: I am German. I've been to Germany. I LOVE German food. And German beer.   The bar is awesome. Wish we had more time just to chill and drink. But our waitress was awesome, attentive and knowledgeable! Order a REAL beer. Something on tap from Germany. (If not, I'll give you dirty looks from behind my coffee cup.)  What you should order: The Sampler Platter. Pick three amazing entrees, two awesome sides. Brilliant for $16.95... best deal on the menu. And if they have a meatball appetizer you want this. You do.   So which entrees:   - Schnitzel. Whichever one you're drooling over. Personally Jager Schnitzel is always best because God blessed the world when he made mushrooms, and man praised God by making mushroom sauce.  - Leberkase. Wow. This was fantastic. It's like a cross between liverwurst (but NOT made with liver) and a meatloaf. Fantastisch.  - Weisswurst. It was good. I've had better and yes I know its a German faux pas to have weisswurst at any other time of day than a midmorning snack... however. it was still yummy and I happily moaned with each bite i consumed with mustard.  So which sides:   - Spaetzle! Buttery goodness. Never had it or heard of it? Think little dumplings. In butter. Es ist wunderbar.  - Sauerkraut... they make theirs with sausage. what?! Ja... mmmmm.  - Potato Pancakes. You order these with applesauce. you hear me? applesauce.  What to avoid... that's pretty harsh but they lost a star for a reason:  - German Potato Salad was too sweet and soupy. My great grandma's recipe puts this to shame.  - IF you don't like mustard (weirdo) the Sauerbraten has a mustard sauce. I like it, but others don't. You've been warned.  We walked here from the ballpark... took about 15 minutes. Worth the walk both ways and they treated us well despite me wearing a Cardinals shirt in a foreign land.  Danke!"}
{"text":"I've been here once because this was an easy place to meet for dinner with a friend. I enjoyed eating here well enough.  I'm honestly not a die-hard fan of German food, although I guess that wouldn't have mattered: a peak at the menu beforehand revealed that this place's menu is mostly Americanized - proof of this is the fact that my salad was topped with French fries (only in Pittsburgh...). Trust me, even if you don't really like German food, there'll at least be a sandwich you'll like here.  Thinking about my usual \"overall\" summary, I have to say this place wasn't bad and served as a reasonable place to meet - the beer menu looked nice from what I saw and the atmosphere was pretty cozy and even nostalgic and homely - but man, the dining options really weren't that extraordinary. I'm still torn as to how to feel about its menu, because on the one hand obviously it being Americanized meant even I could find something to enjoy, but on the other I feel bad for the people who do like German food and may not be getting what they hope for.   It wasn't bad enough that I'd say don't try it and see - just understand it may not be exactly what you expect."}
{"text":"How can there be no reviews of Max's Allegheny? This north side German food institution in Pittsburgh has been around for years and years and has menus that tell you so. They also tell you the story of the north side of Pittsburgh, which I also found interesting. The place itself has a lot of character and looks like it's seen a lot of years there. It's a little weathered, but definitely homey and sturdy.  Randy S. and I headed there post Tazza D'Oro on a Sunday for brunch. It happened to be the same very Sunday the Pens were playing the Flyers in game 7, so all the waitresses were wearing Pens paraphernalia, which definitely added to the experience. On Sunday morning it has a brunch buffet with all the standards, plus a healthy dose of Germanic add ons like German farmers breakfast (eggs, sausage and gravy-ed potatoes), red cabbage, pork chops, sauerkraut and potato pancakes.   The brunch buffet is in a room with a giant tapestry of Neuschwanstein behind the guys at the omelet bar. If that's not rad, I don't know what is. We told the waitress we were going in, went and got back and sat down to find our two ice teas on the table in mason jars (always dope).   The food was just what you would expect in Pittsburgh: gut busting. It wasn't artisinal or fancy, healthy or particularly remarkable, but it was pretty fonking good and to eat that food in that restaurant really made me feel like I was in Pittsburgh. I can imagine all the food there would be of the 'hot and brown' category, in a positive way. And the waitress was probably the nicest on our drive from Dallas to CT.   A really fun place, if showing it's age (though remorselessly)."}
{"text":"Okay, this is pretty much just a review of Max's provided by my German boyfriend. I thought it was OK... I liked the fact that the sampler plate let me try 3 different entrees and 2 sides, but the food was just OK.   Now for the real stuff:   We will probably never be back here. My boyfriend got the wiener schnitzel with a side of the potato salad. He said \"the schnitzel had potential.\" It was clearly deep fried, which is not how it should be prepared (pan fried), and when he cut into it, a flood of grease streamed out. German food is often heavy, but this was just oily and greasy. The meat was good though, and mostly cut to the right thickness. The potato salad, on the other hand, was really gross. It tasted like potatoes from a mall Chinese restaurant. They were sweet and sloppy and just... totally inedible.   The potato pancakes came out looking exactly like regular pancakes, not traditional potato pancakes. The texture was a little funny, almost like not all of the potatoes were fully cooked.   Of my sampler platter, I'd say that the sauerbraten (kind of a pot roast) was the highlight. I did not like the pork and I had the same thoughts about the mini schnitzel.   Also, I think the waitress may have been a little dim. When ordering, I requested that the bread basket omit the apple butter because I am ALLERGIC to apples. 10 seconds later, I ordered the potato pancakes as one of my sides and she asked if I wanted the applesauce with them. No. I didn't."}
{"text":"Looking for alternative places to brunch, we ventured out to Max's. The service was quite attentive. The brunch offering was reasonable but not overwhelming. It consisted mainly of waffles, omelette station, fried chicken, stuffed cabbage, potato pancakes, sausage, bratwurst, bacon, and a selection of pastries.  The quality of the food was okay, but none of the offerings stood out as memorable. If you are looking for a reasonably priced brunch you could do worse than Max's, but you could also do better."}
{"text":"Authentic German food. Besides the standard fare one would expect, choices change daily.  Well prepared, properly seasoned."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! I happened to stumble upon it one night with some friends and what a wonderful place. The food is awesome! We ordered a bunch of appetizers. They were huge portions and super tasty. I have been back several times since then and have not been disappointed yet.  My favorite thing was probably the pretzels! (Mega YUM!)"}
{"text":"Overall authentic quality food with great service!  If you just want to go in for a quick lunch or dinner you can get a sandwich for $8 or if you want a full German dinner or you can get one of their excellent traditional plates loaded with food for around $14-$20  Huge menu with great options and they make one heck of a burger to!"}
{"text":"Wonderful German restaurant within walking distance of Allegheny Hospital.  Authentic cuisine but also a varied menu of pub food.  Great beer selection, several on tap.  Full bar with attentive bartender.  Cozy atmosphere; popular with the locals.  Street parking.  2nd time here, enjoyed it again."}
{"text":"The only authentic German place I have found in PGH. It is true German food from start to finish without a bunch of Americanized items snuck on the menu.  They offer about 8 varieties of schnitzel, and they are all very good. The applesauce and kraut are excellent, although I find the potato pancakes a little on the bland side.  I guess just heap a bunch of applesauce and sour cream on them. The dark interior with wonderful old pictures on the wall, gives the feel of what a European place would be like.  Waitstaff is professional,friendly and efficient. Prices are very reasonable considering the amount and quality of the food."}
{"text":"No idea where the 4 and 5 star ratings come from. Sometimes I think that Pittsburgh overall gives ratings way too high. The price to value is awful...food is way over priced and the quality / taste is poor. If you've ever eaten in Germany or Switzerland or a good quality german...  Service wasn't great either. Gave it two stars because we had fun."}
{"text":"I had a buffet  there. The best part is the bread and the potapo salad. As for the veggie and macaroni, i do not recommend."}
{"text":"Authentic German fare. German beer. Best soft pretzels in Pittsburgh. Reasonable prices. Friendly service. Very fair portion sizes. You'll be taking a box home. The basement is nice. But sometimes used for private events. Has a very cozy \"grotto\" feel to it."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were in town for a vintage race (Pittsburgh Vintage Grand Prix) and were looking for someplace different to eat. We came across Max's. Wow, did we ever chow down. About as authentic as you can get and that comes from someone who lived in Bavaria for 3 years and has traveled extensively through Germany over the years. If you're into German food, I can't recommend this place enough. The atmosphere is spot on, the service is great and the price is good. If I lived in Pittsburgh, I could see me making this place a regular stop."}
{"text":"The pierogies I ordered were top notch. Potato and cheese filling topped with fried onions and a sour cream sauce with onions was shear perfection. DH had the sausage trio and thought it was good, but not the absolute best he's ever had. Child had kid's hotdog and fries which she ate with great gusto.   Atmosphere here was kitschy and perfect, a little run down but quintessential burgh. I would definitely come back for the pierogies!"}
{"text":"Why do I give this place 5 stars? Finally authentic German food! The service was quite stellar as well, and it's old school charm is certainly a plus. But I can promise you you won't be disappointed with the authenticity of home cooked style German cuisine. I'm from Los Angeles and we have nothing this good there."}
{"text":"I was.very disappointed in the food. If you want bland tasteless food, then stop here. They need to get out of the 70's with the decor.  I ordered the corned beef and cabbage sandwich, it was edible but not enjoyable. Don't waste your money here there are much better choices"}
{"text":"This place brought a tear to my eyes. My great grandmother was German and we lost her when I was 19. All she ever cooked us was authentic German food from scratch. When I say scratch, I mean the sauerkraut she served was made with the cabbage she raised in her garden and me and my little brother helped to shred and can. Since she passed I have spent a long time trying to find a restaurant that could even hold a candle to her cooking and today I think I finally have. Everything I ate here tonight made me think of my nana. The potato pancakes were perfect, the sauerkraut was so good that I ordered seconds. The apple butter had just the right amount of cinnamon. The cabbage relish was excellent on the pumpernickel bread.  If you haven't figured it out by now I would suggest if you want German food in Pittsburgh you need to go to this place and go hungry. Our waitress was also perfect. We were so full we couldn't eat dessert so she boxed it up so we could eat it later at the hotel."}
{"text":"been here a number of times and it's my favorite German food in Pgh!"}
{"text":"First time there for dinner. The food was fantastic, and Janice was just so much fun!! If you like herring, Max's has some of the finest you'll find anywhere. The Bavarian nachos could feed a whole family. There were 5 of us and we didn't finish them. Wiener Schnitzel was wunderbar!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at Max's Allegeny Tavern multiple times.  The food and service is allways great.  it is a North Side must."}
{"text":"Have been  eating at Max's for 20 years.  One of the restaurants I misss the most now that I'm out of the 'Burgh.  Visit often and always stop by.  Great food and great Beer....not a bad combo.  I have dreams at night about there wurst platter and spatzele with cheese....definately a don't miss attraction"}
{"text":"Max's is a great place for German food.  I've had several sandwiches, most of the appetizers and even the Sunday brunch (which has a good spread but can be hit or miss) -  though not all in one visit.  I most recently took my Mom out for dinner using a Living Social deal I had.  Somehow, even though we have both been to Max's quite a few times before neither of us had ever seen the sampler platter option on their menu.  For just a bit more than the cost of the regular entrees, you can choose three entrees and two sides.  Obviously the portions of each selection are smaller than the individual meals, but the size is still generous and there were only a couple things not available for the sampler platter.  Between the two of us we selected six different items and four different sides to try and shared everything - and still had enough left for a full meal each the next day.  I can't even decide on my favorite of all the items we tried.  If you aren't sure about some of the entrees, this is a great way to see what you like.  I personally loved everything so much that I think my new go-to menu item from now on will be the sampler platter.  Not being forced to choose just one item is what living in America is all about.  All together I think our bill was around $35 (no alcoholic beverages consumed).  Some might consider this a tad pricey but the food is so good I usually don't mind the slightly higher cost.  Service has never been a problem for me in fact they've always been helpful when I have questions about the menu.  Full bar with numerous good beers on tap.  If you want German food in Pittsburgh, Max's is definitely the place to start."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our dinner at Max's Allegheny Tavern this past weekend.  While out enjoying different breweries' celebrations for Oktoberfest we really wanted to have some tasty home cooked German food to soak up our beverages.  We arrived around dinnertime and they were busy, but we were able to snag a couple of seats at the bar.  I am a bar kind of gal so I never mind eating at one.    To start we got a German Beer flight.   For $10.00, I totally recommend ordering this.  It allows you to taste four German style beers that are not easily accessible in other establishments.  They were all very good, but I believe my favorite was the Warsteiner.  We placed our order with Patrick, the bar keep, and sat back and enjoyed our flight.  Max's atmosphere is rather dark and dated but that adds to the charm of the old world ambiance.  For our dinners we decided we on the Bavarian Peasant Platter * 15.95 \"Bauern Platte\". A heaping mound of our famous sauerkraut, surrounded by a grilled bratwurst, knackwurst and a smoked loin pork chop.\" This came with two sides, which were potato pancakes and Spatzle.  We also ordered a Max's Sausage Platter * 13.95 Wunderbar! A sampling of our finest wursts. . . knackwurst, bratwurst and weisswurst, with mashed potatoes and mixed veggies.  The food was ample!  It might have been too much if we were not so hungry.  I loved all the sausages and the spicy mustard they pass around the bar.  The pork chop was juicy and cooked nicely.  The potato pancakes were ok, they certainly could have had a little more flavor. However, the spatzel was really underwhelming.  It had no taste and the texture was doughy.  I would not recommend that.  The \"heaping mound\" of sauerkraut was not heaping.  It really should have been a much bigger portion to enjoy with all the sausages.  It is the cheapest thing on the plate so why be stingy.  However, the flavor of the kraut was phenomenal!   Max's will definitely get our repeat business when we're in the mood for some German cuisine.  Heben Sie Ihre Gläser, Prost!"}
{"text":"Really cool and old school inside. The food is legit! The potato pancakes are good, the sausage and cheese app is simple and awesome! The corned beef and cabbage sandwich was great and definitely one of my favorites. We also did the sampler platter, consisting of wiener schnitzel, Jagerschnitzel, and sauerbraten. Everything overall is really good and pretty authentic. Our server was on her shit too! Great pre bus and we never had an empty glass. We came here because a friend came just yesterday for the first time and raved about it, I'm glad we came, and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"What to eat for dinner? Hmmm, a nearby German restaurant sounds good (and it was). There's nothing extraordinary to get into detail about so:  1 star for free street parking 1 star for ample seating/tables 1 star for friendly service 1 star for a very good meal  Simple, yet effective. Danke."}
{"text":"I had researched this place and was really looking forward to some great food.  It did not disappoint.  We sat in the bar and enjoyed a flight of beer to figure out which ones we liked best.  Max's has a variety plate where you can assemble a plate with the items you want.  We got Weiner schnitzel, bratwurst, smoked pork loin, spaezle, and red cabbage.  And more beer, of course.  Everything was very tasty and we finished everything except the red cabbage.  It was fine but we were full.  Really, the food was just terrific.    Oh, yeah - the service was good, too.  Fast and very friendly.  Nice female server who was very helpful with the beer order.    Next time I come to Pittsburgh, I'm coming here for sure."}
{"text":"Really excellent German food. Everything on the menu is delicious. I always enjoy the knockwurst platter. The potato pancakes are great.  I used to think German food was always heavy, however when it's cooked well, the way Max's serves it, it's light, tender and delicious."}
{"text":"Despite living in PIttsburgh for most of my life, I've somehow managed to never eat at Max's Allegheny Tavern until recently.    My initial impression of the restaurant was positive - the place had an old neighborhood feel to it, a small crowd was drinking at the end of the antique hardwood bar, and the German murals on the walls made me crave an icy-cold German lager with a stout head of foam.  I thought about how well German potato salad would taste with that beer.  So I grabbed a seat at the bar and eagerly awaited the first taste of my beer.  And I waited...and waited...and waited some more - for over 15 minutes before someone came around to take the order.  Actually that isn't quite accurate.  Two employees came around - one to the end of the bar, and one behind the bar directly opposite me.  Both of them stared at me.  Neither one greeted me or asked me what I would have like to order.  I stared back, incredulously, and even made a \"what's going on here\" palms-extended-upward-shoulder-shrug gesture.  Neither one took the hint.  Finally a third employee came around the bar and took my order.  Great, I thought to myself, finally that beer.  She served the beer in a Mason jar.  WTF?!?  Who serves imported German lager at a German restaurant in a freaking Mason jar?  Max's does.  The beer was devoid of its head, likely the result of a bad beer pour and/or a less than perfectly clean glass (an endemic problem with Pittsburgh restaurants, in my observation).  I was sad.  I quaffed my beer quickly in an attempt to salve my irritation and opened the menu.  My first impression of the menu can be summed as follows: \"Uh-oh\".  The menu is huge with a number of \"slow-food\" stews and braises.  The restaurant is more than half-empty.  How can a restaurant prepare such a large number of menu items, including more than a few labor-intensive dishes, freshly every day and still stay in business when the place isn't even half-full?  Answer: They can't.  The food isn't fresh.  I ordered the Wiener Schnitzel.  I love properly prepared Wiener Schnitzel.  Made with fresh butterflied veal breast, slightly pounded and seasoned, well-coated in fresh bread crumbs, and pan-fried in clarified butter until golden brown on the outside and juicy on the inside, Wiener Schnitzel is the ultimate comfort food.    Sadly, Max's Wiener Schnitzel had nothing to do with properly prepared Schnitzel.  The veal was super-thin, had a texture that strongly suggested it had been mechanically processed, and tasted as if it was pre-breaded and frozen.  It wasn't pan fried either.  The breaded, frozen, puck was simply dropped into a fryolater - where the breading puffed out and fell off of the meat in places (which doesn't happen when the cutlet is resting against the cooking surface under its own weight as when the dish is properly pan-fried).  The edges of the sad Schnitzel had curled up and it looked a horrible mess on the plate.  Curly Schnitzel?!?  My stomach dropped.  My sides, German potato salad and braised red cabbage, were equally awful.  The German potato salad had an unnatural glossy sheen - the kind that typically comes from bottled sauces that contain high fructose corn syrup.  The \"bacon\" in the dressing was nothing more than tiny flecks of some sort of processed, possibly faux, \"meat\".  The potatoes were suspiciously uniform in thickness and roundness - exactly the homogeneity that is found in pre-peeled, pre-sliced, vacuum-sealed processed potatoes.  It was a gluey, sickly sweet, mess.  I didn't have more than a bite or two.  The braised red cabbage didn't taste fresh - it tasted like it had been sitting in a steam table for a day or two and my order was its last chance to be eaten.    Max's Allegheny Tavern bills itself on their web site as, \"The Best in German Fare.  The Best in Service\".  That's total bullshit.  It's awful - both for service and fare.  If you want good, authentic, German fare (in which the Schnitzel is properly pan-fried to order and delicious), join the Teutonia Mannerchor down the street.    I'll never return."}
{"text":"Crap!  I can't believe that I missed a \"First to Review\" by just a matter of weeks.  Max's Allegheny Tavern has been a shining star and a \"must\" for my Pittsburgh rotation of places to visit.  Years ago, when I worked on the Northside for Heinz, I spent many a rowdy Friday night here in the basement with factory workers.    What's there to say?  It's a Northside institution and always has a mixed crowd that is super cool and friendly.  The bartenders are friendly and manage to remember my name and drink choice even though I'm here only a few times a year.  My Friday nights here must have made quite an impression!  I love the decor here, dark wood paneling with lots of stained glass, and the downstairs bar is where the naughty people hang.  Jukebox and room for dancing.  The food is very homey and very reasonably priced.  The German nachos are always worth ordering, and they are smothered with Gouda cheese.  The spatzle is also a creamy indulgent treat.  And for those seeking the real Deutsch culinary experience, they have a large variety of sausages and schnitzels.  So it's a sausage factory in more ways than one."}
{"text":"This used to be the best German food in town. I have seen a gradual decline in the food over the past several years. The gravies have changed and the Max's Goulash (one of my favorite dishes) has a different sauce (strangely dessert sweet) and change in the protein. The sides are still great, but the food used to be so much better."}
{"text":"Came here with a large group of friends for dinner. They were great about the reservation we made for 12 and had a nice table in its own little room waiting for us when we arrived. I had the Hefeweizen style beer, which was good but had a strange taste and aftertaste to it, but it wasn't so bad as I ordered a second one. For apps we had the  Bavarian nachos (not great by any means and actually very odd...and cold), the stuffed fried pretzel and the red cabbage with sausages. The red cabbage here is amazing, and the pretzel was fairly good with a honey mustard dipping sauce...but I guess its kind of hard to mess up something thrown into a deep fryer and stuffed with cheese. For our entrees I had their \"famous\" potato pancake Reuben with sides of red cabbage (couldn't get enough!) and their house German potato salad - also very tasty. Fiance had potato pancakes, spatzel with cheese sauce and sausages. The spatzel was not in as a creamy a cheese sauce as I would have hoped - it was a bit oliy, not so much creamy. We were both a little underwhelmed sans the cabbage with the entire meal. I hate to say it - but I have had better authentic German style food at church potlucks and even Hofbrahaus (in a comparison to the beers at Hofbrahaus - these did just not stack up for me). I would give MAT another go round to try some of their other offerings - their schnitzels looked pretty good!"}
{"text":"Old 1842 building 1902 bar from St Louis Expo Great service, fantastic food and a whole lot of fun.  We spent 2 hours Saturday afternoon enjoying it all.  The potatoe cake reuben is fabulous the pastrami is lean and excellent Definitely going back on our next visit"}
{"text":"I had Max's sausage platter on a recent visit. Nice menu with something for everyone and taste. Loved the kraut, and wursts included with the meal. The cheese wheel appetizer was a huge hit too!  Fun place and our server was great.  She definitely helped give this place a family friendly feel."}
{"text":"Max's is a great German restaurant.  I've been a semi-regular patron for over 20 years and have never been disappointed.    The portions are huge--entrees come with your choice of two sides.  I always get the potato pancakes and the spatzle.  The pancakes come with a side of chunky applesauce (it tastes homemade and not overly sweet) as well as sour cream.  The spatzle comes with gravy (I believe it is pork gravy) and are always perfectly cooked.  Other sides that are good is the German-style potato salad and the slaw (v. tangy in a vinegar sauce).  Their saurbraten is good and my friend swears by the rabbit dishes, but I almost always get the sausage sampler.  The sausages are always fresh, perfectly cooked and Max's carries a nice spicy/brown mustard that's a perfect accompaniment.  I have yet to get dessert there, because I obviously cannot exercise any control and gooble up everything on my plate (an assortment of breads and rolls also come with the dinner, and the apple butter is very good).  However, they do have a nice selection of desserts, ranging from cake to strudel.    Their non-German options are also very good:  vegetarian sandwich and omelettes are good and available for lunch.  And they're usually in the Entertainment/Enjoy book-great to save some jingle money.  Even without a discount, for the quality and quantity of food, it's an excellent value."}
{"text":"My daughter took my sisters and I there for Mother's Day lunch on Saturday.  I got the Spinach Salad with Kase spatzles.  The salad was to die for.  My daughter got one for herself and one for her husband to take home.  The dressing was delicious and there was tons of mushrooms and bacon on it.  The spatzles were also very good in a cheesy sauce.  There was some to take home also.  We also got some potato pancakes which were pretty close to the ones my mother used to make.  At the end of our dinner, we split a piece of banana cake which was the highlight of the meal.  It was a two layer cake covered with a not too sweet icing and bananas.  It was just enough for all four of us to split.  I will definitely go back for the exact same meal.  And this time, I will be bringing a spinach salad home for the next day for me.  Our waitress was very attentive and treated us very well."}
{"text":"Great German food don't know what all the other poster's are talking about. Wife,daughter, and I were all pleased with the food...the beer sampler was great also.. I didn't get sick, my food came out hotter than hell I had to let it sit to cool, and the wait staff was excellent. We went on a Friday night and it was packed.. I expected worse for how crowded it was... We will be returning.."}
{"text":"5 hours north of Pittsburgh, there's a land known as Toronto. Not a burgh or a sylvannia because it's derived from Native Indians. Toronto is not very German influenced by any means if at all. With that backstory in place, you can take this review with a grain of Rice. Which we have a plenty in Toronto, not the Americanized Chinese either.  The look on my companion's faces say it all.  It's not the most life changing Food ever.

{"text":"Our dinner here was a nice experience.  We were going to a concert and when we arrived many people were waiting to be seated.  We were told to expect a half hour wait.  We sat at the bar and had a drink and in what must have been only ten minutes we were asked if we would mind eating at a booth in the bar area rather than wait for the dinning room.  We were thrilled, because we were considering eating at the bar.  The booth worked out just fine.  It wasn't too noisy and  we got served quickly.  Even though there were several specials that tempted us, we both ordered the best thing on the menu - their Jäger Schnitzel, with sides of hot German potato salad and sweet and sour cabbage.  I had a German black lager and my wife a glass of wine.  The basket of assorted rolls comes with delicious apple butter and sauerkraut relish, both very tasty.  The schnitzel is quite large, and we only made it about halfway thru when we asked for a to-go box.  We're looking forward to finishing it here at home.  Maybe next time we'll try something different....but probably not! Pros: inexpensive, very tasty schnitzels Cons: no reservations for parties under 5"}
{"text":"I went to Max's for the first time with my family a few weeks ago. I ordered the kielbasa sandwich with a side of kase spaetzle. The kielbasa on the sandwich was topped with a serving of sauerkraut and served on a toasted roll.  It was your average kielbasa sandwich. Satisfying, but nothing out of the ordinary.  The kase spaetzle however was noteworthy and delicious. It was smothered in gouda cheese sauce and I love me some gouda! I ate it all and I would have licked the plate if it were socially acceptable.   As for the environment, the restaurant is housed in what looks like what might of used to be a house back in the day. It had lots of little dining rooms. The decor was kind of outdated, but I think that's what you'd expect and it's part of the charm. The tables were spaced a little too close for my liking, but it was tolerable.   Overall, I'd go back if invited, but I don't know if I'd go again on my own."}
{"text":"This place has delicious German food! We had the Reuben on potato pancakes with kase spatzle (spatzle noodles in a creamy Gouda cheese sauce) -- amazing!  Nancy was our bartender and she provided great recommendations as well as top notch service! She's incredibly personable and you can tell she truly enjoys her job! Great experience!"}

{"text":"The deep-fried, cheddar-stuffed pretzels are the single best appetizer in Pennsylvania. Especially paired with the Kostritzer Schwarzbier. Any of the sandwiches are going to satisfy your tastebuds and your appetite, for like $7.00. Max's has the best potato pancakes (and best applesauce to pair with it) that I've ever had. That includes my wife's."}

The inside is pretty cool, it's all original, has a nice tile floor. The hostess who greeted us was very nice, hooray for that. The Business supposedly started in 1890? There is still a lot of the original Decour in the building. The menu is huge, a very lot to choose from. My husband got the German beer sampler, I loved all four. I ordered a glass of red wine, not much to choose from, The choices were pretty bad. Although a bottle of wine, they had more of a nicer selection. They have Foxhorn wine on their wine menu. Yuck. I got the pot roast sandwich, my choice of side was coleslaw. My husband got the sauerbraten and his choices of sides were warm German potato salad and spätzle.  I really like the flavor of the sauce on his entrée. All was OK, our server was polite. The prices were very reasonable. Cocktails and desserts were very low-priced. I had the German chocolate cake for dessert, the picture looks amazing, the cake was not so amazing. Perhaps they do not make it there, it kind of tasted like a frozen product. My husband had the Apple strudel, I liked it a lot, although he was disappointed that it was microwaved and not baked in the oven to warm it up. I would go back to try more food from their menu, I saw loaded potato skins at the table next to us, definitely would order those as a meal. My husband says to give the restaurant four stars, he has spent time in Germany and thought that the food was pretty good."}
{"text":"This is a really cool kinda hidden bar with a surprisingly large restaurant dining area."}
{"text":"I really like this place. It has a neat atmosphere where the entrance has a nice bar and then there are a few other rooms that have the feeling of a living room or dining room. I really enjoy their brunches, but their pretzels are amazing. The one thing I don't like, which is a bit disappointing, is their potato pancakes. They are a little lumpy and not quite fried enough. With that said, it is definitely worth the visit."}
{"text":"I cant believe Max's is going from 5 stars to 2 stars for me.  Understand, I loved this place.  Over the years we have had so many family dinners here including my sisters rehearsal dinner, that it's almost become like eating at a relatives house.  But now that relative has gone senile and needs to go to a nursing home, and they can't cook anymore.  For the past two years, every time we come here we say, \"This just isn't as good as I remember.\"  For starters, the food is always served cold.  Don't believe me?  I hope you enjoy tepid knackwurst and cold mashed potatoes.  BTW, to whoever makes their mashed potatoes, you have to boil the potatoes before you mash them.  Yesterday they were undercooked, gritty, and gross.  In fact, all of the food is becoming gross.  My friend got the roasted beef and what came out looked like a cold cut covered with a congealed beef gravy that had bits of carrots in it.  wtf was that????  I'm done.  This place has gone down hill.  You need a new chef, immediately.  Max's is a North Side institution but there are so many new, better restaurants opening up that they really need to up their game.  PS--thanks for the nausea and hurling about 6 hours after dinner."}
{"text":"One of my favorite north side haunts. Great to take visitors who need to understand what it means to be German in Pittsburgh.   Get the soft pretzels. Get anything that comes with a potato pancake. Get the kielbasa. Get it all. You can't go wrong.   Oh, and the spaetzle. The spaetzle......."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Max Allegheny Tavern since I was still in my mother's womb.  But seriously.  This place has been an institution for my family, and I really love it here.  I feel like this is some of the only German food in Pittsburgh, and I think it represents fairly well.  My thoughts:  Brunch Buffet- I love the Sunday brunch buffet more than life.  Omelette station, German and American breakfast and lunch foods, and lots and lots of beautiful, delicious, and decadent desserts.  It's heaven on Earth.  There is usually a decent selection of meats, and the potato pancakes are almost always featured.  They've changed it a bit over the years, but I still love this buffet.  Appetizers- My family loves the soft pretzels.  They are so yummy and buttery, but a bit heavy if you are going to eat your entire meal.  So make sure to share.  Meals-  I, personally, have never had a bad meal here.  The sauasages of all varieties have been great.  The weinerschnitzel also great.  Sandwiches all good as well.  I really like the cheesy spaetzle dish that is just like macaroni and cheese but with spaetzle noodles!  I don't get too crazy and order anything complicated, though.  Sides-  I love love love their sides.  I could live on the spaetzle and potato pancakes.  Don't pass the sides up!  Dessert:  Also love their desserts.  There is a chocolate chocolate cake that they heat up with homemade whipped cream that is TO DIE FOR.  Not so shockingly, the apple strudel is wonderful as well.  Besides the food, the servers are always very friendly and efficient.  There is also ample street parking, which is really nice.  Definitley check this place out if you have not yet."}
{"text":"We took my dad here for his birthday and it was atrocious. My father's dinner came with salt on the plate, under his fries and a half eaten pickle. The grilled pulled pork sandwich looked like something you could buy in the freezer section at Walmart that had been sitting under a heat lamp for a couple days. I got the turkey Reuben on potato pancakes- that was hands down the worst thing I've ever gotten. The potato pancakes were dense and had a both bland and bad taste. The turkey tasted like it was from a banquet frozen dinner. Needless to say I didn't finish it. The only edible item we received was the Bavarian nachos.   So in short, don't be fooled by the reviews or the need for reservations. If you don't want your night to revolve around the running joke of \"ew who picked that place?\"  then you should not eat here. Very, very disappointing."}
{"text":"Diane is awesome, i used to live in PA and moved to CA and this is a great place for a beer, cheap food and good friends. I miss this place. One of my favorites places back home in PA!"}
{"text":"This is one of the only German restaurants I know of in the area. The meal was good and reasonably priced. They also have a good beer selection on draft and in bottles. We had a party of 6 going for a 7:30 dinner on a Thursday.   Bigger parties tend to chat a little more and take longer in my experience. I felt like they were sort of rushing us out. That might be because they closed the dining room door and started vacuuming the front bar room while we were still finishing up our dinner. I'm not sure if anyone was eating out there but I'm very happy we weren't because it seems really gross to me to vacuum around food. This was around 9:15 and I'm pretty sure they serve until 10.   Besides that, our service was good and so was the food. We all split the stuffed pretzels and potato skins as an appetizer. The pretzels are delicious, I could have eaten them all myself! Deep-fried and stuffed with cheese, yummy!   I ordered the Chicken Viennese and was pleased with my meal. It came with a choice of two sides and I went with a delicious sweet potato casserole and my favorite thing of the night: POTATO PANCAKES. I prefer sour cream, but you can also get applesauce. Yum yum yum get lots of potato pancakes! The chicken was delicious and was served over spaetzel, which was just ok. I've had the kase spaetzel there before which is served in a cheese sauce and much better than the regular.   There was a variety of entrees ordered from sausage platters to wiener schnitzel and everyone seemed pleased with their meals. You get a lot for your money and I'll never turn down a chance to eat potato pancakes!"}
{"text":"Max's is so very Pittsburgh.  The bottomless Sunday brunch is more gut-busting American continental than authentic German, with sauerkraut served next to the Polish kielbasas and a chafing dish of mac and cheese next to the red cabbage.  It's a good deal if you're sitting at the bar all day to watch a game or can put down assorted meats like you own the food chain.  Some lighter fare included a bowl of fruit salad and a lox platter, but the rest of the buffet was dominated by sausage, bacon, chicken, and other land animal fare galore.  Vegetarians can indulge in a omelet cooked to order on one of two portable butane burners--major props to the employee one-manning this show who clearly flips one-handed omelettes in his sleep by now.  Vegans not welcome.    I'll try the menu in hopes of something closer to German food if I ever come back.  Otherwise, it's a bit pricey for the quality of food served, especially with coffee and tea disappointingly not included.  Don't come here for style and glamor--do come to fill a post-marathon-sized void of butchered-animal desire.  What you see is what you get."}
{"text":"Best place in town. I love the sampler platter and Sunday brunch is the best deal in town"}
{"text":"Stopped in for buffet brunch with Andy P. during our road trip from Dallas to Connecticut.  The iced tea served in pickle jars accentuated the ambiance perfectly - it feels like a German brunch!  The menus are particularly fun.  Buffet options are varied but all interesting.  I remember a chicken part being especially good, and some good pastries.  Fun and delicious.  Ambiance: 21/25 stars Food: 18/25 stars Service: 19/25 stars Bathroom: 18/25 stars Probability of going back: 30% (If I'm ever in Pittsburgh again)"}
{"text":"I work on the North Shore and have heard many coworkers rave about Max's.  When I finally tried it, I wish I had not waited so long.  Entering Max's is like going into your grandmother's living room.  Very welcoming and nostalgic.  The menu is bigger than I expected with a variety of traditional appetizers and sandwiches along with a large selection of German items.  Everything from multiple varieties of schnitzels, sausages, chickens and a sampler platter that lets you choose a combination of all of the above.  All of the items we tried were full of flavor and served at the perfect temperature.  Speaking of being full, the food is very rich so you will leave with a full stomach.    They have a good selection of beers and even offer a sampler option.  The dessert selection looked delicious, but we were beyond stuffed so will have to savor them on a future visit.  I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This was a treat--I was not aware of any other popular places for German food around other than Hofbrauhaus, and I definitely did not expect the cozy interior from the divey bar appearance on the outside. Coming in late on a weeknight, there were barely any other customers, but they graciously took us in and provided us with great service the entire time. The menu is cute with a historical newspaper replication on the outside, which was great for learning about this place and its origins.  The menu is quite large, but thankfully there are sampler options which allow for trying multiple options at once. Seeing as most also come with two sides, this made for a very big meal. The sausages were fantastic and flavorful, as were the schnitzels, which were perfectly seasoned and very tender. The one topped with the runny egg and anchovies was especially memorable and is convincing enough to just get that by itself next time. Some favorite sides included the spatzle, which was soft and chewy, and of course the potato pancakes. Definitely would return to try more again next time."}
{"text":"Max's is a hidden gem. They have a huge German menu and the food is excellent. The service is very good. I enjoy the entire menu. A+."}
{"text":"Oh my!  This is an outstanding German bar/restaurant.    For a starter go with the cheese & sausage plate - the mustard that comes with it is fantastic.  For an entree, the Reubens are popular and very good; I went with the sample and absolutely love the Jagerschnitzel and Wiener Schnitzel with the peas on top (can't remember the name).  Solid kraut and delicious spätzle that practically melts in your mouth.  I would have liked to see a few more German beers on tap, but with Spaten Octoberfest you really can't go wrong."}
{"text":"My family rented out the bottom room for our engagement party. It turned out great! Everyone loved the German cuisine. Our server was very nice and helpful. The room was clean and spacious for our 50 guests. Definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Wow, just wow! Great German food (I had the farmer's meat platter), great beer selection, quiet atmosphere for visiting with friends. Perfection!"}
{"text":"Cozy down to earth atmosphere, cute to see familes of three generations sitting together for a Friday night meal. The food itself was ok but just a tad bit pricey. I thought my bavarian-style pretzels were a bit too heavy since they were deep-fried, and my friend's schnitzel platter with spatzle was a bit low on salt. Not a bad experience overall, but I might still rather go to Penn Brewery or Hofbrau next time."}
{"text":"The sausage is good. The mashed potatoes and German potatoes (sides) are definitely not homemade. Service was friendly, which made up for the cafeteria quality food."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that I am unfamiliar with German food. I cannot compare what I had with what is served in Germany, but I will describe my experience.   I ordered a special, which apparently changes at weekly or monthly. The name slips my mind but I will describe it thus: homemade mac and cheese (not the processed powder stuff!) with mini shell pasta. Crumbled crackers topped this concoction that tastes eerily like my grandmother's. She is Italian by the way. The mac and cheese has a variety of 3 different sausages sliced: knackwurst, bratwurst, and Weisswurst. The portion was large! I had to take home about 1/3 of my meal. Maybe the breads and side salad filled me up. :) In my opinion, it was good but doesn't do well as a leftover.   My dessert consisted of German chocolate cake. I know, I know...how original. BUT I LOVE GERMAN CHOCOLATE CAKE!!!! And yes, I do know that German chocolate was created in America by a man with the last name of German...STILL LOVE IT!!!   I NEED to go back soon so I can try more of their food. One visit isn't enough. I had my sample and I want more!"}
{"text":"Wings are still perfectly done and crispy... The buffalo sauce lacked something this time though...too much oil, not enough butter. The flavor wasn't all there."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner on a busy Saturday night. Place was packed and we were seated very quickly. Despite being very busy, server was top notch. Food was okay(had the reuben), but free popcorn while waiting for your order was a plus."}
{"text":"The bartender was fantastic and the food was even better! I got the sausage sampler and it was delicious. The sauer kraut and mustard were great as well."}
{"text":"After a long day at work I met up with a friend for some German fair on the northside. I don't get out to this neck of the woods that often so it was a treat for me! All appetizers are  $2.99 during happy hour so we went with the Potato pockets which were perogies in my book. They were crispy and creamy, and topped with fried onions. They also had a side of french onion sour cream. Pretty tasty stuff! Plus they gave you so many I could have filled up just on the app. I ordered the Bell's Oberon while my dining partner ordered the sampler. I have to say that she wasn't that impressed with the brew. \"Dirty pipes\" and I quote. I had the same taste from my order so I focused on the food.  We both ended up ordering Max's Goulash that was suggested by another Yelper! You can't go wrong when you have that recommendation. This is not our small town neighborhood goulash made from egg noodles and a mix with ground beef. The noodles in this feast were homemade and chunky, piled high with a peppery meaty sauce infused with fall off the fork beef, carrots, peas, and tiny pearl onions. If you remember yesterday was a cold, rainy, gloomy day. This was real comfort and I had to take it to go. Rain is still in the forecast so leftovers will be grand!"}
{"text":"Good sized portions.  Excellent potato pancakes.  Schnitzel was a bit tougher than I would like, and the spaezel lacked any kind of flavor.  Service was pleasant and the prices were fair. I'm not a beer drinker, so I could not comment on the bar end of the business, and it really was not crowded the night I went there, but saw a few other dishes that other diners were enjoying that I would like to try.  The bratwurst looks amazing, so that may be the next menu item I will sample when I return."}
{"text":"Just stopped by for a few cold ones. This place is great. A ton of atmosphere. I wish I could write a full review but that will have to wait until I go back to eat. And I will definitely be back to eat here.   The bartender was  nice and the beer was cold, what more could you want? I did look over the menu and can't wait to go back. So until I do this it for now."}
{"text":"If you're visiting Pittsy and you want to find some \"local flavor\" served with a side  dish of damned good german food, Max's is for you.  I was so happy to come here after a week of hotel/bar/fancy restaurant food...total wonderful german heaven.  I went with the sauerbraten, a perennial favorite of mine.  I can't say that Max's was the best I've ever had (cuz mine is the best I've had), but it was damn good.  And the sauerkraut! and potato pancakes! and the beer served in mason jars!  It was fun and fantabulous!  Great, friendly servicee with personality.  As many schnitzels on the menu as you can imagine (my co-worker had schnitzel with an egg, anchovy and capers on top, if you can imagine).  I didn't order the \"corned beef meatballs\" ...I can not believe they make such a thing."}
{"text":"I love Max's but the food can be hit or miss sometimes. The staples on their menu are always good and time tested favorites but beware that special menu. There have been some epic duds on there that I wish I would have missed"}
{"text":"I like Max's.  It has nice ambiance and the German food is good.  I'm not impressed with the sandwiches though.  The last two times I was there I got a reuben and a pastrami and swiss.  I expected the corned beef and the pastrami to be more autentic deli style mean and less luncheon meat style.  For that reason I can't give a higher rating.  The cole slaw is great and I do love the potato pancakes."}
{"text":"This is a fabulous restaurant. Lovely place, friendly staff, and the food is delicious! So many authentic German dishes to choose from, it's a wonder we were able to tear ourselves away. Make sure you leave room for dessert; the Apple strudel is the perfect end to a great meal."}
{"text":"Very convenient to North Side visitors, it is within walking distance of several major motels, hotels, and b&bs. Max's is famous for it's wurst and indeed the weisswurst is the best dish: iconic, simple, and satisfying. The beer sampler is a great partner to the weisswurst. Combined, the diner, whether they are visitors or not, feel like they've experienced a staple of Pittsburgh locals. Thus with this wurst and beer combo, arguably, one of the most famous Pittsburgh dishes is now at your fingertips. Furthermore, if you want to take the next step in your Pittsburgh eating experience, Max's again has you covered with the Hasenpfeffer, or rabbit dish. An ode to the deep German roots of Pittsburgh's North Side, this traditionally rural, hunter's dish is served at Max's breaded and with gravy on top and with two sides: this reviewer recommends potato pancakes, spätzle, or substitute the einlauf soup, which goes well with the dark pumpernickel bread served table side. While the meat is thick and tender, the breading conceals the possibility of herbs and spices, which if they do exist, cannot be detected. Additionally, the Hasenpfeffer is a little pricey since you pay for the uniqueness; it is often only a dinner item as well. Finally, an Iron City Beer may be the best way to cap off a Pittsburgh North Side German dining experience at Max's bar: a place where many a long hard day has been passed knocking back a cold one. Cheers and enjoy!"}
{"text":"One of my wife & my all-time favorites in Pittsburgh.  Old-timey ambience, excellent beer selection, and fantastic (and authentic) German food options.  Very tasty and high quality foods for a decent price.  We go often and have never had a negative experience."}
{"text":"I was in PIT for business and used Yelp to find a German restaurant.  This place was only .8 miles from my downtown hotel so I decided to make the trip - and I am so glad I did.  This is a small restaurant in a residential area.  The bar area has an old world charm to it and is where I decided to sit (there are more tables in the back).  It was a warm and friendly environment.  The menu offered a wide selection of traditional German foods.  I decided on a sampler platter.  It was DELISH.   They offer soups, appetizers. salads, sandwiches, sausages, schnitzels, old world favorites like sauerbraten, lielbasa and baked Kassler Rippchen and many others selections."}
{"text":"I stopped by here with my wife and another couple for their Sunday brunch buffet. Having never been here but hearing so much about this place I was eager to check it out. I enjoy the area it is in even if it's not the greatest part of town. Parking on street was fairly easy to find right around the corner.   The inside was rather neat having that rustic/historic look to it. The menu has a history of the building written inside which is fascinating to read about. The food itself was OK. I loved the red cabbage as it had a healthy amount of sweetness to it. I also enjoyed the make your own omelet bar as that is one of my favorite brunch items! The other food ended up just being average at best. There were some pasta and sausage combinations as well as bacon and fruit. The fruit didn't look too great and I avoided that and the baked goods which sounded underwhelming.  Overall a neat experience to dine here. I wouldn't be opposed to coming back and trying out a regular weeknight dinner menu. I like the history part of the building and I think the historical decoration concept inside is neat."}
{"text":"I really like this Northside institution.  They serve the beer in jars and I had Spaten German beer- very good.  They put really buttery free popcorn on the table so be careful- the grease sticks to your fingers.  In the bar they have an old fashioned player piano.  I really like the German fare- big portions. The schitzel is good but not great but overall way better than Hofbrauhaus and not Disney- it's the real McCoy."}
{"text":"After hearing Hofbrauhaus-haters say that Max's Allegheny Tavern is the only place to go in Pittsburgh for German food, my husband and I decided to finally try the restaurant this afternoon.  We were seated in little booths right next to the bar. They were cozy, but the seats reminded me of old fashioned church pews. Our waitress soon brought us a little basket of four rolls with butter, sauerkraut relish, and apple butter. Though I liked the different varieties of bread, it was nothing special. The relish and apple butter were a nice touch though.  Our waitress was busy with both waiting tables and tending the bar, but she managed to check on us pretty frequently. Our food also came out relatively promptly. I order the Wiener Schnitzel with Potato Pancakes and Spatzle on the side. The Wiener Schnitzel was amazing -- by far the best I've ever had! The veal was tender and the fried surface was perfectly crispy. However, the sides sadly did not match this main dish. The Potato Pancakes were oddly bitter, and I did not enjoy them with either the sour cream or applesauce. I only ate two or three bites and completely stopped eating them. (I must add that Hofbrauhaus's potato pancakes are delicious and something that I order every time that I go there.) I also did not enjoy the Spatzle, but I am accustomed to eating cheese Spatzle.... So I may be reviewing this harshly since I'm just not used to plain Spatzle, but in my opinion, it was terribly bland and watery.  Overall, Max's Allegheny Tavern served one incredible item (Wiener Schnitzel), but everything else was merely mediocre. Because of this, I really don't plan on returning to the restaurant again any time soon. I'll be sticking with the fun environment and overall good food at Hofbrauhaus, actually."}
{"text":"Max's is my happy place. Here's why:  1. Awesome happy hour. Dutch Club Dark drafts (plus others) starting at $2.50, plus half price appetizers. Fried provolone, potato pockets, wings, deep fried pretzels, sausage and cheese plate... all are AMAZING.   2. Sunday brunch buffet, under $14 and better than Grand Concourse. Every week there are omelettes, potato pancakes, waffles, sausage, bacon, pastries, and German farmer's breakfast (eggs, German potato salad, and assorted sliced German sausage all mixed together, so basically the best thing on earth). There are rotating entrees, also. As long as they are vaguely German/American, they are great.   3. The goulash, which is under $10 and comes with a salad (HOT BACON DRESSING) plus assorted rolls with apple butter and sweet/sour cabbage.  4. Free popcorn at the bar.  5. The best waitresses. Ever."}
{"text":"I only have one complaint about this place and that is that the pirogies are not home made or at least from pirogies plus. Everything else I've had here is good. Staff is friendly and prices are reasonable unlike James street which is a block over."}
{"text":"Tremendous selection of German dishes.  All the sausages come from a particular manufacturer in Wisconsin that uses 100 year old methods of making them (according to the menu).  I don't know if that's a good thing or not, but they taste terrific.    The options for sides are as plentiful as the moan dishes and the hot bacon potato salad was awesome.    Definitely recommend giving this a try."}
{"text":"We (my fiance and I) went out for a pseudo-couples' date with our good friends, Sara and Thom, to Max's to introduce them to some of the most authentic German food in da Burgh. Where most people associate Hofbrauhaus with the ultimate German beer-hall experience, I prefer Max's for the quieter, less raucous environs. (At least when it's not Oktoberfest)  We'd been there once before and immediately fell in love with the place. I (still) keep raving about the Sausage and Cheese platter. They've got some good Gouda. The Potato Pockets (pierogies) were OK -- I'd take some Pierogies Plus or Forgotten Taste over Max's, but that's just me.  The spaetzel was to die for, however. It's like a German Mac n' Cheese. And boy, do I love me some Mac n' Cheese. It literally melts in your mouth with its' ooey-gooey-ness.  Drink-wise, I tried their German lager and Thom tried the sampler. Thom is a beer enthusiast. For around eight bucks, you get a GOOD amount of beers to try -- they are not some dinky little shot glass samples, either. Thom had some trouble near the end finishing it...it was so much beer. Bob had a Captain and ginger-ale...in a king-size goblet. Goblets are the ONLY way to serve adult bevvies.  For dinner, I had the pork loin over an apple-raisin gravy/bread concoction. The pork loin was flavorful and tender, and quite delicious. Sara had the sauerbraten and seemed to enjoy it. Bob's burger was ginormous and looked extra tasty.  We finished it off with the Apple Fritters. Now, these fritters aren't for the faint of heart. And they aren't your average dinky small sized portions, either. You get two huge deep fried apple fritters, covered in vanilla ice cream. One person CANNOT eat the whole serving. You must, I repeat MUST share them. If you attempt to eat the whole plate yourself, you will have flavor explosion, followed by severe heartburn. But damn, are they GOOD.  Our visit ended up totaling 2 hours. One thing, though...please fix your outdoor sign. Usually it shines out like a red and blue beacon in the night for people to find their way there, but on Wednesday, it was out. Driving there, I got confused on where it exactly was (but I had a general idea, as I had been there before.)."}
{"text":"Some of the best German food in town. Good beer, quiet afternoons, fun evenings/happy hour an great nights."}
{"text":"I ordered the Roast Pork loin with Apple raisin dressing, sauerkraut, and German potatoes. Oh yeah... Right Choice! Took a little longer than usual as there was a Large Party of 16 that ordered Just prior to us. Happy to say the waitress took Great care of us, plenty of rolls, drink refills, etc. as we waited. Apple Strudel for the Final Act. So Good, I forgot to take a picture. lol"}
{"text":"Probably the best German restaurant in Pittsburgh.  There's nothing I like better than meat, it ties grains for the best food group in the pyramid (I reject the plate).   We got the sausage platter, Bavarian stuffed pretzel, and the Max's sampler platter. I'm still drooling over their stuffed pretzels.    I think what won me over as the basket full of bread. Not only was there a surplus of meat but also bread?? Free? Indescribable happiness."}
{"text":"A buddy and I went to this place for the bunch buffet. Everything they had laid out was delicious and worth the money. Very relaxed atmosphere for a Sunday morning. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Best German food in the Burgh.  Hands down.    In the heart of Deutschtown, Pittsburgh's historically German/Austrian enclave, this is real German cuisine- heavy, delicious and traditional.  The schnitzels are amazing, and the brats are pretty good.  Max's is far and away better than the breweries or chain theme restaurants.  The place is quiet , to be sure.  If you're looking for dancers in lederhosen and want to sing drinking songs, go elsewhere.  This place is all about the food.  And it is worth a trip."}
{"text":"Went here for a rehearsal dinner back in August. I have never eaten so much wurst in my life! Great german food and tasty beer. If I didn't live in Boston I would stop by Deutschtown more often for Maxs. A great taste of Pittsburgh German culture! They did a very nice job for the rehearsal dinner buffet and they even have a classic arcade machine with Pacman and Frogger in the bar."}
{"text":"It's just like being back in some small town just outside of Munich... If I'd ever actually been to some small town just outside of Munich! It's not the touristy disaster that is Hofbrauhaus, nor do they serve beer in hefty pints like Penn Brew. Rather they just serve really good authentic German food, with a small selection of imported German beer. Wunderbar!"}
{"text":"Appreciate that Max's is trying to be like a nice little German tavern, but the effort falls flat. Sauerkraut was good. I ordered the rabbit stew, which came out looking a lot more like a schnitzel and was covered in a very unappetizing looking wine sauce. The rabbit was also overcooked.  Did not taste good. We sent food back and they thankfully refunded us, but will not be returning."}
{"text":"Excellent brunch.  Will go back for dinner.  We went here for brunch.  While smallish the selection is quite varied and really really good.  I enjoyed the omlets that were custom made and the waffles.  I really am looking forward to going back here for dinner as the menu looked really tastey and the food being brought to other tables looked really good.  Both the hostess and the server were polite and attentive."}
{"text":"Definitely my favorite German restaurant, this place brings back memories.... *sigh*.  It's a long-time North Side staple, and the atmosphere has a \"well worn\" appeal with old pictures of the local Germanic community and of the area.  This place has it's own personality!  As for the food... well, you can't find much better German food than this and at this price!  Both of my parents favor the peasant platter.  Me, I love the stuffed pretzel appetizer, all the different sausages (the weisswurst is amazing!), and their kasespatzle (thick, doughy egg noodles with butter and cheese).  I will always associate Max's with the best, most flavorful German food at an affordable price!"}
{"text":"I don't have the opportunity to eat a lot of German food, but the Weisswurst platter I had here was quite excellent. Prices are moderate. Service was just awesome.  The menu is quite extensive, and I hear the beer is pretty good too. If I lived in Pittsburgh, I would be a regular."}
{"text":"What happened to this place?  I thought that hasenpfeffer was supposed to be like a stew., not deep fried and then baked.   Sent back.  Won't be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I thought it was going to be good with some of the reviews I read. It was my first time there and I really like how cute it is in there. But the fish sandwich was not cooked all the way through, the breading was still doughy tasting and moist. I didn't like it. And the fries lacked flavor. Sorry I didn't really care for what I ordered, but I do love the atmosphere."}
{"text":"It's been over 5 years since I had been to Max's but we were in the area at lunch time so we decided to stop in. The menu is big and printed on a newspaper. They have all kinds of German food.  I decided to order a Reuben with a side of homemade chips. The sandwich came on rye bread that was toasted. It had lots of sauerkraut, Swiss cheese, and sauce with the meat piled high. It is one of the best Reubens I have ever had. The chips were thinly sliced and very crispy. There was no need for a dipping sauce, the chips were very good just plain. They had 3 or 4 desserts that looked good but I chose the German Chocolate cake. It's one of my very favorite desserts. There were 3 layers of chocolate cake. In between the layers of cake there is coconut, chocolate, and pecans. The outside of the cake is frosted with a chocolate whipped frosting. It was really good. I need to go back to try the veal."}
{"text":"The food is simply four-star good, but the atmosphere and service are definitely worth a star all by themselves. Max's is cozy in a neighborhood hangout kind of way, with a menu that will hit the spot if \"nouvelle\" is not your favorite cuisine.  They do have a vegetarian sandwich, but we went for the potato pancake reubens (turkey and regular) with onion rings and apple sauce and were very pleased.  The pancake batter is on the floury side, so they are more pancake than latke, but they were good nonetheless.    If I lived a little closer, I'd be here all the time - local North Side brews, and a menu I'm looking forward to exploring from top to bottom. They even have my favorite dessert from when I was little, Black Forest cake, so you know I'll be back for that."}
{"text":"When you go to Max's you sort of feel like you're stepping into Cheers in the 1980's, in a good way! Friendly staff who remember you and provide friendly, efficient service. Great location for happy hour or casual business meetings. Must try the stuffed pretzels! Haven't had any of the dinner entrees, but all of the appetizers are delicious."}
{"text":"Not a fan of this \"german\" place. Simply awful.  We ordered the Potato Pancake Reuben and a Traditional Reuben. So much gristle in the meat. Very low quality food for the price.  The bar is cool, have stopped here in the past and enjoyed the atmosphere of the bar.  Bar yes. Food/Restaurant no."}
{"text":"This place is great for brunch on Sunday! The service is great and the food is delicious. I always leave stuffed and happy."}
{"text":"I have been going to Max's for 20 years.  I love this place.  The Einlauf soup is just simple good eats, but if you're ever there when the soup special is beer cheese - ORDER IT!!.  I love their potato pancakes, sauerbraten and the basket of German rolls served with sauerkraut salad and apple butter.  The waitresses have been there for years, they are the best!  Most delicious long island iced tea in the city."}
{"text":"First I'll start off with the homemade beer.  Nothing spectacular, but it has flavor and is very reasonably priced, as is the menu.  I went with the potato pancake Reuben.  HOLY CRAP.  Probably the most filling meal I've ever ate, but it was worth it.  My boyfriend was pretty happy he got to finish my leftovers.  The German potato salad I had for my side was equally as good.  It had a bit of a bite to it, which I really liked.  I also had to try my boyfriends meal.  He went with one of the wursts, but the exact name is escaping me.  It was made with veal, and was so light and tender - YUM.  That will be my meal when we return.  I can't believe it took me so long to eat here!"}
{"text":"I decided to treat myself to some authentic German food for lunch today.  I recently spent a few weeks in Germany and after being there, I feel I can vouch that Max's is the real deal when it comes to German cuisine. The interior has the look and feel of what comes to mind when thinking of a European pub. The staff is warm and courteous and the service is top notch. I got waited on promptly and lunch was in front of me within ten minutes of my ordering it.    My meal today consisted of one of the items on the \"February Specials\" list. It was breaded veal on a plate smothered in a brown mushroom gravy (think Jäger Schnitzel and substitute veal for pork) with Hot German Potato Salad, Sauerkraut and some homemade rolls. Delicious!   My only disappointment was that I came here for lunch on a work day and couldn't include one of the German imports thas was on tap.  They have (notably) Hacker-Pschorr Weisse, Hacker-Pschorr Munich Gold, Köstritzer Schwarzbier, Warsteiner Pils. There's also Yuengling Lager and Iron City products available on tap, but common, drinking a domestic while enjoying schnitzel or wurst simply makes no sense to me.   We're lucky to have such a fine German establishment in our city. Genießen Sie das Essen!"}
{"text":"Found this place by accident as its proximity to AGH hospital. For the price you can't beat it as a good German meal.  Glad we ended up here."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Friday night and this place was PACKED!  Great atmosphere and fun vibe.  Service was good.  Food was good, not great, but decent.  We had 2 meals and a couple of drinks for about $50.  We would do it again."}
{"text":"A good selection of classic Pittsburgh beers and tasty German cuisine. The service is pretty good and it's a great place to watch a Pirates game."}
{"text":"Max's is my parents' favorite restaurant when they're in town visiting me. Good, solid food with a great deal of [German] variety. I love the German beer flights (i.e., beer sampler) and the atmosphere is funny - a bit like your grandmother's parlor. The bread that comes with entrees is delicious (pumperknickel + others), and their cherry sauer kraut is delicious as well.  The food is good, but you must be careful with certain dishes. One of the schnitzels that comes with carrots/peas is clearly bedecked in carrots & peas that were recently frozen. German food isn't exactly known for its vegetables, so I let it slide but I always remember not to order that dish when I'm there."}
{"text":"I have been eating their sauerbraten since I was a little girl.  I love this place.  I love the old-fashioned decor, the room setup makes you feel as if you're in an old house, and there is a piano that plays itself by the bar if you feed it a quarter.  if you're a first time visitor, i reccomend their wonderful sampler platter that allows you to choose 3 (i think) entrees and some sides.  superyum!"}
{"text":"Every time I go to Max's it's excellent. I grew up in North Side and it's been a favorite of mine for years. I have never had a bad experience, the staff is always pleasant and extremely attentive even when busy. Do yourself a favor and go here, it'll be worth it. :)"}
{"text":"Really terrible food.   Fried zucchini with powdered parm and marinara sauce at a German restaurant...   Bad decor.   Bad service."}
{"text":"Note: Being that this is a German restaurant, I'll try, TRY to cool it with the Germanic heavy metal references.   It was Kay's pick, and she surprisingly threw the dart at Max's, a place I've forgotten exists.   Pickled herring is something I've had before; my Polish grandmother introduced it to me as a lad. Before we even arrived, I sleuthed the menu online and instantly knew that I wanted The Herring In Sour Cream as our appetizer.   The sour cream is just a blob laid on top of the pile of herring and serves to temper the herring's sugary flavor. The herring itself was so thick yet so delicate and exquisitely candied it had me...*ulp*...  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-vm1s5644o  A cornucopian assortment of somewhat stale rolls were included with apple butter and a sauerkraut relish, both of which would have tasted even better on hot dogs.   Also making for a fine frank fixin' was the Sweet and Sour Cabbage, a colorful take on the sauerkraut we all know and love. I had that along with their German Potato Salad (you get 2 sides with an entree). Max's potato salad tastes more like potatoes au gratin that anything you'd find in a deli, but it made for an errr...Acceptable accompaniment.   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkiuJg5HhtM  And yes, the potatoes played the role that \"Ein Heller und ein Batzen\" does in the above song. It was...the proverbial quiet before the storm...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DJ_WZLSBQU  Schnitzel is something that has haunted my culinary imagination since I saw it prepared on an episode of Great Chefs years ago. Belatedly, I now had a chance, but which one to try? There were six...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IW4G9U7IBLQ  However, with Max's Sampler Platter, I could try three. Wiener Schnitzel (the prime, naked Schnitzel), Schnitzel ala Holstein, and Schnitzel Royale would make up my trio. Each of them tasted like the thinnest and best boneless pork chops I've never had, despite the use of veal. Schnitzel ala Holstein is named after a count and is served with Gouda and a tomato slice. Schnitzel Royale comes topped with capers, anchovies, and a perfectly executed fried egg. The Holstein was the richest, the Royale the most pungently memorable. All of them came off as tender, crispy breakfast fare I had been missing out on for too long, but I can finally say beyond a doubt that Schnitzel is pure, risen splendour...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UojVLi1x4ak  For dessert it was Apple Strudel. Layered, flaky dough and a thermal filling involving the freshest of apples collaborated to create a pastry that succeeded with simple elegance.   P.S. Our server was brusque to a degree but warmed up to us once  we sang praises of the food.   P.P.S. The power went out for about five minutes as we dined. Uh-oh...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtBXcCsfytA"}
{"text":"This is americanized German food.  For real German food, go to Hofbrauhaus and ask for a schnitzel."}
{"text":"Great local business with tons of character.  Very good German food and beer.  A meat lover's paradise.  Maybe not the best place to take your new vegan girlfriend on a date."}
{"text":"I have not a single good thing to say about this restaurant.   The service was terrible, took 15 min to get a water. The nachos were terrible on store bought chips with raw onions and green peppers on them and very little meat. We ordered the turkey Reuben that tasted funky on day old potato pancakes. We also ordered Max's famous Reuben, nothing famous about it. Extremely light on the corn beef. Nothing special at all. Will NEVER go back."}
{"text":"All the reviews are right on about this place! Authentic German food and brews, great bar in front if your just drinking. Only complaint was there was a wire bristle thing sticking out of our pork loin. Not sure how it got there and we didn't say anything. Large selection of brews here."}
{"text":"Great food and fun atmosphere. Fried pretzels with cheese were amazing, and so were the Pierogi appetizer. The appetizers were top of the line and five stars. The meal was a solid 4.5 stars. The apple butter will blow you away. I had the salmon dinner with potato pancakes and he had the Schnitzel Royale. The Oktoberfest beer was fantastic. High marks!"}
{"text":"I was at Max's last weekend. I'm from Chicago, so I was looking forward to trying a German pub in the Deutschtown neighborhood. Our friend took us here, and I really enjoyed it!    The service was great and very friendly. The beer selection was awesome, and all the food was delicious! The menu is huge! We ordered the soft pretzel appetizer and the sausage and cheese plate, and both were very tasty! The mustard dipping sauce is phenomenal! I couldn't get enough of it. I wish I had left room for dessert because everything sounded spectacular.   The restaurant itself, which I heard used to be an old hotel, was quaint and cozy. I enjoyed the historical elements of the place; all very authentic and special.   I will definitely recommend this pub to anyone traveling to Pittsburg!"}
{"text":"I like this restaurant so much I had my wedding rehearsal dinner here.  (Both the families liked the food very much.)  Max's is the best German food in Pittsburgh -- actually, it's the best German food I've had outside of Germany, and I've definitely had worse meals in Germany as well.  Max's is in a restored hotel, and the decor is very much in the Victorian style of the original hotel building.  The exception is the bar area that's good for happy hour or watching a game, or just having a beer -- that has a lot of neon and a jukebox.  But the bar area is also tasteful and pleasant to be in.  Max's has a full bar, but their real specialty is their excellent selection of German beers, both in bottles and on tap.  I haven't met a wurst I didn't like, and they're pretty much all offered here.  The Braunschweiger sandwich is pretty delicious and unique in my experience, and the schnitzels are very delicious as well.  Another specialty is the kase spatzle (Spatzle noodles with smoked Gouda cheese -- a twist on mac and cheese that ensures that even a picky child will have something to enjoy here), but my two favorite menu picks here are the hassenpfeffer and the spinach salad with warm bacon dressing.  For sides, the red cabbage salad is my favorite, although the sauerkraut is also very good.  I don't care for the German potato salad, however -- I like the kind that has caraway seeds and vinegar, and is served cold, but Max's offers the kind that has an unidentifiable sauce and is served warm.  Some people like that style of potato salad though, and from what I can tell, Max's does a decent rendition of it.  If you're looking to reserve a room here for a banquet, you have a lot of options.  The basement \"Rathskellar\" is more bar-like in its atmosphere.  It would be a good place for some guys to have a birthday party or something.  For a rehearsal dinner or other formal event, one of the upstairs banquet rooms would be better.  Depending on the size of your group, you can arrange to have a buffet-style dinner, or individuals in the group can order directly off the regular dinner menu."}
{"text":"I'm not super adventurous when it comes to trying new meats, but everyone who has tried the Hasenfeffer (sp?) says that it's over cooked. This is rabbit. I don't eat rabbit- not knowingly anyway.  The ambience is very cool. One of my favorite things about Pittsburgh is little historical places like this.   I had spätzle and cheese. It was just okay. I mean, it's hard to mess up anything you melt cheese over. I also ordered the flight of German beers- and this I would recommend.  Service was decent. Our waitress was kind and helpful, but we were seated at a table that was too small to accommodate our selections. I had to give away most of my salad when my meal arrived because there was just not room for it on the table.   The area is sketchy and probably not safe to linger around at night. Admittedly I am not in that area often, but it's a shame because it's got a lot of culture."}
{"text":"Our first stop in Pittsburgh, what a great start! Had a couple of yuenglings, a warm, salty yummy soft pretzel and a big ole plate of German goodness in da tummy!  The Peasant Platter had knock wurst, weisswurst and a pork chop on top of heap of sauerkraut...with potato pancakes, spaetzel and a basket of baked breads!  So.much.food.  And oh soooo good!  The bar is cool, staff is really nice and I believe they offer their patrons a free ride to and from on game days!"}
{"text":"The goulash was (sickeningly) sweet and the bread pudding wasn't sweet at all.  But the atmosphere is kind of cool.  And the prices are downright cheap."}
{"text":"I stopped by Max's with some friends during the Deutschtown Music Festival. The place was packed, but we were quickly greeted and did not have to wait long for a table to open up. A quick look at the menu let us know that prices were very fair.  We tried the sausage and cheese sampler appetizer and it was simplicity at it's finest - fresh, delicious sausage, rich cheeses, and an excellent mustard for dipping. I was really impressed with how such a simple appetizer could convey the quality of their food so well. Delicious!  The entrees were equally as tasty. I tried a turkey reuben which came on a potato pancake. Obviously, this particular entree was not the most traditional German faire, but, once you took a bite, there was no going back. A variety of sides were available; I tried the spaetzle - also very simple, but delicious.  Overall, this is a great place - cozy vibe, excellent German food (both traditional and more adventurous), and quick, friendly service. My only regret is not having room to try their tempting desserts. We don't get to the Deutschtown neighborhood often, but we will have to make it a point to go back for Max's Allegheny Tavern."}
{"text":"Service was great along with the food. Nice atmosphere. Parking is like any other place in the city tough.  Worth a walk though"}
{"text":"I have stopped going to Max's for regular meals because the food isn't so good but a friend likes to go for Sunday brunch.I find a good portion of the food is acceptable for the brunch,except the food is not kept hot or even warm on the buffet. Cold kielbasi and sauerkraut is a turn off even though it would be great if it was warmer.  The chef that makes the eggs and omelets to order is really good and the sausage is the best. The bacon and the chicken needs to be cooked a little longer as they are always half raw. So much of what they have would be good if it was kept at least warm. Since they have it in chaffing dishes, I've found that the food comes out cold from the kitchen. Makes you wonder just how safe the kitchen is."}
{"text":"As a someone with 50% German heritage, this place was right up my alley. Came here for happy hour with coworkers and did a family-style smorgasbord of Braunsweiger, schnitzel, spatzel, Kartoffelpuffer (potato pancakes), and a bunch of different appetizers. This was the way to go. Also had a lighter beer that I can't remember the name of. And to top it off had a piece of the banana cream cake that was amazing! Will be back to Max's for sure. Service was awesome as well."}
{"text":"We used Max's to cater a company event, and couldn't be happier! The staff was personable and patient with me as I worked to pick out an appropriate menu, and went so far as to make recommendations. What a relief, after dealing with so many pushy and aloof companies!   Despite the snowstorm that was taking place, a friendly staff member helped us load our food up to be taken to the event, taking extra care that nothing would move around once we started driving.   Oh, and of course the food was great (and very reasonably priced). We had kielbasa, kraut, wings, spaetzl, and potato pancakes - all of it was great. Would recommend to anyone looking for take out catering."}
{"text":"Mr. J and I have gone to MAT several times for the brunch buffet. It had always been fresh and brimming with so many options. Since we hadn't been in a while, we went today and it will likely be the last time.   The hot buffet items were ice cold and the French Toast was still wet inside. The smoked salmon was sitting on a plate without being kept cold and it had a fishy taste. This could possibly why Mr. J is experiencing symptoms of food poisoning.   This has really gone downhill and we wont be back."}
{"text":"This is a fun old fashioned place to wait out the thunderstorm. The potato pancake turkey Reuben \"sandwich \" was pretty good. The waitress is old school charming and seems to run the whole show herself."}
{"text":"Sunday brunch is such a great deal and so filling. Some people don't like the potato pancakes but to me they're fab. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I really thought I'd never be back.  The goulash I had was so so gross.  But then,  was roped in by some friends who were doing a Sunday brunch book club.  Of course I couldn't miss out on tantalizing conversation... so I obliged.    I really had no clue what they offered for brunch options, but quickly learned they have a a pretty decent size brunch buffet.  I'm not below buffets at all, it's the fat kid in me!  Most things still looked a little questionable to me, but I went for the big ticket items.  Make your own omelets, potato pancakes and dessert.  I'd hit up the buffet again, but still be hasty to check out the regular menu again.    The omelet was made right in front of you, so I added cheese, mushrooms, peppers, tomatoes and onions.  I was super excited about it because it was the size of a football.  Sadly, it was pretty tasteless.  I don't think they added any salt or pepper to the egg mix, so it came out really bland, despite loading up on ingredients.    But the potato pancakes... I could survive on them forever.  They were amazeballs!  Add some sour cream and I was in potato patch heaven!  I had to keep myself from getting more because of the other thing I loaded up on... dessert.    The desserts looked unassuming, but they were also awesome.  I had a smattering of delectable bites.  The scones were so moist and tasty.  I had to stop myself from taking more than 20.  I also had some carrot cake, brownies, cookies among other things I inhaled and didn't pay attention too.  Should I be embarrassed?  Probably.  But I don't care because it was darn good!"}
{"text":"After feeling \"crowded out\" by the throngs of people converging upon Downtown and the North Shore for the Three Rivers Arts Festival this past Sunday we decided to venture a bit deeper into the North Side and give Max's Allegheny Tavern a whirl. My partner has been in the basement before for various work-related functions, but I had never been there, despite driving by on numerous occasions.       We easily found on-street parking and entered the restaurant. I immediately loved the decor in the entry room/bar area, and those pleasant furnishings continued into the more intimate rear room where we were seated. We enjoyed the beautiful wall tapestries, and I thought the old newspaper-like menus were pretty cool! I was surprised (in a good way) at the old-fashioned urinals in the men's room. In a city that has struggled to nourish and revitalize its history over the years I was already a fan of how unique Max's was in the regard of feeling \"authentic\" in an era of predictable chains.       We were initially enticed by the prospect of ordering fried soft pretzels stuffed with cheese as a shared appetizer only to find out they were not available. We settled for the non-cheese-stuffed version, which were \"melt in your mouth\" good and were handsomely complemented by tangy honey mustard. We were a bit dehydrated after walking miles around the city, yet our waitress was very attentive in consistently replenishing our water glasses as soon as they were half-empty. I was craving a burger but was tempted instead by the fried fish sandwich, which I ordered with a side of potato pancakes and applesauce. My partner ordered a fried chicken sandwich with the same side I did.       Our food arrived surprisingly promptly. My fish sandwich was HUGE! I had enough to take home and enjoy for a post-work meal the following evening. The fish tasted fresh, although I wasn't a fan of having to pick small bones out of my mouth in exchange for enjoying that freshness. The bread it was served upon was tasty as well. The potato pancakes were thick, fresh, and were delicious when enjoyed with the chunky applesauce. My partner also thoroughly enjoyed his own sandwich.       As if this wasn't good enough our check was only $22! We will definitely be back soon, at which point I look forward to trying a burger!"}
{"text":"FYI: New happy hour specials are awful. Just awful. Sorry guys, as much as i love you   I've got to put my food down somewhere. Even raising the prices on all of the apps to 3.99 would've been better than taking the pierogie (aka potato pockets) special off all together.   Won't be back."}
{"text":"Brunch, brunch, brunch.  Max's serves an awesome Sunday Brunch Buffet!  The omelet station is standard (no egg whites for you health-nuts) and heavenly pastries will always await you along with potato pancakes.  I'm not in love with their potato pancakes, but being that Max's specializes in German food, you've got to try at least one with their homemade applesauce.  Some of my rotating favorites on the buffet include red cabbage, Eggs Benedict, and the Farmer's Breakfast.  You can order off the menu during brunch if you aren't in mood to gorge yourself on the buffet.  No drinks included with the buffet :( but you can order them, of course.  I love the decor at Max's - it's an old house, and much of the furniture looks like it was in this house and just remained when it converted to a restaurant.  Max's location in Old Deutschtown on the North Side fits it perfectly.  They even offer a shuttle to Heinz Field on Steeler game days (small fee applies)."}
{"text":"German food and German beer served in a mason jar. Best in Pittsburgh. The history of the tavern and the friendly makes this wish me that I lived closer to Max's."}
{"text":"Frequent visitor. The place is definitely starting to slip food wise. Had a turkey rueben that had about 1 slice of turkey on it and not much else.fries are always soggy these days. I'll stick with the happy hour with half price apps. Daughter had the schnitzel which she said was very greasy which shouldn't be the norm. My water glass had onion pieces in the bottom of it. Server was good though . Thank God for the staff ."}
{"text":"I love German food, and had heard good things about this restaurant, but we were disappointed.  Wienerschnitzel should be pounded thin before being fried, but this was thick and greasy.  The spatzle was bland.  The sweet and sour cabbage was quite good.  I did not care for this style potato pancake.  The service was quick and friendly, but I cannot say I would recommend this as authentic.  On the menu, they did not even spell \"Arlberg\" correctly.  Too bad.  The menu is great - I just wish the preparation lived up to it"}
{"text":"I've only ever ordered from this place but honestly it was the worst German I've ever had. Goulash was unidentifiable as any I've had, bitter flavor as well. Potato pancakes taste like they had vinegar in them. Horrendous."}
{"text":"I have a friend that loves this place, and I have been told it's the best German food in Pittsburgh so I had to give it a try.  I had the Roasted Loin of Pork Stubenkuchen Style with German Style Potato Salad, and Sauerkraut. Everything was really good. The Pork was delicious and that mushroom gravy that they put on it was nothing short of amazing. I want a whole bucket of the stuff to put on everything. The Sauerkraut was interesting featuring shredded pork mixed in. The german potato salad was good but was pretty much what I expected.   Their draft  beer Selection left a little bit to be desired but featured 5-8 beers many of them popular german style beers.   I got a good idea what this place is all about and I have to say that I will be back for more."}
{"text":"I honestly can't get enough of this place.  We used to come here after going to Pirates games since its right up the road.  Now its one of my favorite places to go out with my friends.  Its a bit pricey (~$15/person), but the quality and quantity is superb.  The service is pretty good.  The atmosphere has a nice feel to it, perhaps its the antiquity.. I love the cuckoo clock and tapestries they have.  Now, to the food: The bread they give you... with apple butter!! ... is very fresh and tasty.  Try not to fill up on it while waiting on your huge main course.. The Bavarian soft pretzels were warm and soft when we ordered them.  Also delicious.  The sampler platter is a great deal if you don't know yet what you like.  You get 3 entrees and the typical sides for ~$16.  My favorite, though, is the schnitzel liechtenstein, with sauerkraut and potato pancakes.  Fresh and delicious everytime.  I would definitely recommend this place to anybody who likes ethnic, or German/Bavarian food, or just trying new stuff.  It's awesome."}
{"text":"Usually I pick a single item meal, usually one of the schnitzel meals.  Recently went with a sampler platter.  Really good way to get several different tastes.  Always look forward for a meal here."}
