{"text":"Love this place! Lovely atmosphere, top notch service! The chef made me a custom pasta dish, and I mean completely custom not just modified. I was able to sample wines before ordering a bottle and everything was beyond delicious! We had the flourless chocolate cake for dessert and oh my! Fully happy and satisfied! yum!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, friendly & helpful staff.  Atmosphere is \" homey\" been bac several times and never been disappointed!  Keep me away from the carrot cake...like it too much!!"}
{"text":"I admit it, I'm a west end snob but am becoming a fan of the restaurant scene in Leslieville. I've now been to Leslie Jones two times in two weeks. On the first visit my friend and I split the mushrooms, the avocado salad and the vegetarian pasta of the day. All were amazing. I was there again last night with a bunch of friends. The highlights from the menu were - the polenta with a combination of basil, goat cheese and tomato. I would love if they made it large enough for a main. The flourless chocolate torte with the home made caramel sauce and whipped cream. OMG. Orgasm in my mouth. The server gave us some free shots after our meal. We pretty much closed the place down. It's a small restaurant but it has a quiet patio in the back. It's a great date place or to dine with a group of friends (no more than 6 though as they can't really accommodate all anything more). I will be back!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the atmosphere, pleasant server and very good food. Both had daily special, risotto and pasta....very good. A little pricey, but very enjoyable."}
{"text":"Service was slow but friendly. I wouldn't recommend the pizza for what you're paying."}
{"text":"Went there when the place was virtually empty....Asked to try the white wine before buying. Unfortunately, I tried 4 that tasted virtually the same. Not an issue that they weren't my kind of wine but that they were so similar I couldn't tell the difference between them. The server told me that they had a Riesling but as it was not open, she wasn't about to open it for me to try. Fair enough. I took a chance & ordered without trying it. Tasted the same as the previous 4. Weird! I'm a huge fan of whites & have even taken wine tasting courses, so it's not me that's imagining this. Big deal? Nope...but what was a big deal was the server's attitude despite my completely apologetic demeanour. 

What was annoying, however, was that I ordered the grilled calamari. I've had it there before and it was fabulous. This wasn't. In fact, I didn't recognize it as the same dish. My friend, who is the world's most easy-going diner, sent it back. It was bitter (tasted like it had been marinating too long in lemon w/peel left on) and so salty that you couldn't taste the calamari, which were actually ok when you shook off the sundried tomatoes, capers and super salty olives - in other words, way too many strong elements competing against each other and a delicate fish. The most surprising part was that the menu listed it as \"Gilled Calamari\" and there was nothing grilled about it - no grill marks, nor did it taste of the grill. Instead, the calamari were pink (typical of marinated calamari) and were finely sliced & tossed in a heap of aforementioned ingredients.

When the bill came - minus the charge for the calamari, which was the right thing to do to the credit of LJ - the automatic percentage for the tip was 20%!  Sorry, but I find that obnoxious, especially after the service didn't warrant it. I've dined at high-end restos that don't do that. There is an option to enter your own % but still....

It's all too bad because I really like the atmo of LJ, and it's just down the street from where I live. I could easily make it my neighbourhood spot if the food was better and more fairly priced - that credit goes to Gio Ranna's. Ten years and many, many meals later, I have NEVER - not even once - had a negative dining experience nor dish I didn't like (love, really)."}
{"text":"I love having a really good family owned place that is consistently good and reasonable in our 'hood. The aromas from the open kitchen invite you in to this cozy spot. I usually get the fish of the day--last night it was Icelandic Cod or Atlantic Salmon. The wine list is well curated and they do half glasses if you ask nicely :)
This is a gem, one of my favs in Leslieville. Can't wait to enjoy the sweet back patio!"}
{"text":"Oh my. Oh dear. Leslie Jones is definitely as good as it gets. It's not pretentious and it doesn't try to be something it's not. Leslie Jones is simply a lovely, inviting place that serves amazingly good food and has fantastically good service.

A warm, breezy summer evening and the front windows of Leslie Jones were open to look out onto Queen Street. They also have a lovely back patio with string lights and umbrellas. Candles lit on the tables brought a warm glow to the room, that was already filled with rustic, comfortable furniture. Bob Dylan on the sound system and jugs of water with lemon and orange slices floating and bobbing. 

They bring pita and a delicious hummus to the table to start. For dinner, I had the slow roasted pork with fennel, braised onion and lime chili herb yogurt. DELICIOUS! I finished it off with their homemade carrot cake (sans raisins and nuts) with a cream cheese frosting that was divine. 

The service just could not have been any better. 

Like I said...oh my!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the charming back patio.  Ordered humus and olives as well as calamari to start.  Both good.  I had the gnocchi special as my main which was delicious.  My husband has the escargot pizza which was also good.  We had high expectations for the 2 desserts we shared with friends.  The peach cobbler just wasn't very peachy... Or good... and the portion was tiny.  The carrot cake was good."}
{"text":"Fantastic! 
Friendly, relaxed neighbourhood restaurant. Intimate, but it can handle big groups (although I would recommend making a reservation if you have a big group). 
Lovely private, tree lined patio at the back of the restaurant - away from Queen Street traffic.
Meals were very tasty, well presented and portions are appropriate... you should not be disappointed.
Wine list has lots of great selections - clearly someone with wine knowledge had some input in its creation.
The service is terrific and they and the kitchen is friendly. 
Just Go!"}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place.  We moved not too long ago to Leslieville, and Leslie Jones is one of the places that we set aside for a special night.  Tonight was one of those.  

The service is awesome, and the menu looked great.  But in the company of great Leslieville restaurants like Lil Baci, and Queen Margherita, which have similarly priced menus that include pizza, comparisons are bound to be drawn.  

The wine was expensive at $12 for what seemed like a 4 ounce glass.  The Beet salad was pretty good.  But the pizza was not to the level that we've come to expect in Toronto, especially not at $16 for a small 4 slice pie.  The sausage was chunky and comparable to what one might expect at a lower priced grab and go chain.  The unannounced Parmesan cheese, below the layer of mozzarella was an unwelcome surprise.  But above all, I took issue with the crust which was heavy and brittle for what was supposed to be a thin crust.

I have a feeling the other menu items, especially the dessert might be worth trying, but unfortunately due to this pizza experience I probably won't be back to write about it. Such a shame, I was hoping to have a 4 star experience and truly ended up with about 2.5."}
{"text":"We arrived 6 minutes late for our reservation to be greeted by a warm vibrant atmosphere, a lovely aroma and a very friendly server - two thumbs up. 

We started with two cocktail a Sea Hare for the lady and a French Italian for myself -  both lovely two thumbs up

We decided to start with the appetizer platter - marinated vegetables, cheese and cured meats -  very vibrant and tasty and great value - two thumbs up 

We eagerly await the mains 
The lovely lady ( my Mrs. took the cod special and it was the piri piri pulled pork - both were excellent - two thumbs up 

We decided to skip dessert but they all looked fab. Overall it was lovely, service a tab slow but very friendly helpful. Two thumbs up."}
{"text":"I am constantly amazed by what these guys achieve in that little open kitchen.  I have had to stop complaining about my stove at home after seeing the guys prepare food on four antique elements on a stove from the 80's.  

I can't count home many times I have been and it is always great (best in summer on the back patio.)  Yelp has them at $$$ but that seems high.  Regardless, value for dollar, Leslie Jones is best in Toronto in my opinion.  Usually the first place I recommend when asked about places to go for dinner.

At times it get's crowded but the staff seems to manage fine (thought I do suggest avoiding the small two seat tables by the service area as the traffic back and forth is a bit stressful during dinner.)

Try the carrot cake.  Even if you don't like carrot cake - try it.  Excellent."}
{"text":"Felt compelled to update after another visit last night.

The portions seem to have got bigger and the food even fresher and better presented (didn't even think that was possible).

One of the best restaurants I've been to in T.O."}
{"text":"Great service.
Everything we ate was great.
Prices fair and portions decent.
Back patio is pretty sweet."}
{"text":"I feel  bad. I wanted to like it. I really did. 

Its so close to home, and the patio is nice, and the servers were pleasant.  Its charming, really and would be fine for drinks with friends, but the food really left me wanting more. 

Somewhere (Chowhound?) I heard that the Polenta was great. We ordered it as an app. Teeny portion and covered, doused, actually in sauce. The sauce was that ubiquitous red pepper and feta puree that was big during the \"California Fusion\" trend of the 90s. So disappointing. 

I had the smoked salmon pizza and a glass of wine. The pizza was OK. Just OK. The smoked salmon is from Kristapsons, which is local. It was amazing, but thats just one component of the dish. My sister had the pasta special which was mediocre as well. Just pasta, with sauce, absolutely nothing special about it... plus it also borrowed the feta and red peppers flavor combination (so un-inspired).  

My partner had a meat dish, which one I can't remember. He said the meat was cooked nicely, but it was in the $20 range and the portion was tiny. I certainly advocate people eating less meat, but then they could have bulked the dish with more veg and potatoes. There was less than a cup of veg/potatoes on the plate. He was left hungry and had some of my pizza AND something once we got home.

FYI - it is no longer Cash Only! I paid with credit. 

I will go again, but only for a drink on the patio. I found the food to be very unoriginal, not very exciting and kinda pricey for what you get."}
{"text":"The service was terrible. We sat waiting for 20 mins only to be given water. We then had to ask for menus. Another 15 mins later, we placed our orders - all at once, drinks, appetizers and mains. The appetizers arrived quickly but it took an hour to receive our mains. The patio was a little busy, the restaurant was not. I will say the food was good but not worth all the frustrations."}
{"text":"The atmosphere and the food is fantastic here. They generally play a full vinyl album of some of the best classics, so its easy to get hooked on the vibe there. Food and wine are a little pricy, and tend to be on the smaller side, but are always tasty. It's one of the better cozy restaurants in Leslieville."}
{"text":"*On this particular evening - it started pouring at 7:30pm, so all of the patio diners rushed inside, making the restaurant a bit flustered and busy. The staff handled this chaos as well as anyone could have. 

The food was good - but did not leave a lasting impression. I ordered the fish special with a salad ($24 for a very small piece of fish and lettuce) a price which did not match the quality of the dish. 

The cocktails were bland. One cocktail served to me included tequila, grenadine and soda water.... I would stick with wine next time. 

I would return for sure - the staff was lovely, but I would make sure I order completely different dishes/drinks to see what that does for overall experience."}
{"text":"We enjoyed a surprisingly good Valentine's Day dinner here. The $45 price for 4 courses was excellent value, especially since each one of the courses was a tasty treat. Well prepared, good sized portions, quality ingredients, (super tender beef) and attentive service. The ambience was pleasant too, music not too loud, friendly, informal. Bravo. We shall be back. And recommend to all Beachers who will appreciate a nearby restaurant with a good chef and competent staff.  One suggestion: add a little more light on the tables...we saw a young woman using her iPhone  to read the menu."}
{"text":"This place is exactly what I want in a restaurant. Great food, and desserts. Friendly, relaxed atmosphere. Can't wait for the patio to open for the season."}
{"text":"Tasty food, nice ambiance, decent prices.  Wine list is mediocre, short, and slightly overpriced in my opinion.  I'd also like to see items on the menu that are a little more exciting, but simple seems to be their 'thing' so I can roll with that.

Apparently the back patio is pretty stellar, but I've only been the one time thus far and it was February.  Also heard good things about their signature carrot cake, but neither the missus nor I are carrot cake fans in general.

One major bone to pick though - cash only.  I can understand for places where the average bill is under $40, but for a restaurant where dinner for two is pushing $90-100 not accepting credit cards, Interac, or even having an ATM on site is just poor form.

Nonetheless, we'll go back.  And we want to try weekend brunch."}
{"text":"Did we go on an off night?
Thought Leslie Jones was overpriced for the quality of cooking. We ordered the charcuterie board, which was mostly preserved/pickled items with goat cheese and 2 meats and we shared a pizza that was good. If someone made it at home (not a chef) and served it to me then yeah I'd say it was really good. But for the price of the food here you can get way better in the area.
Drink menu was good."}
{"text":"Leslie Jones is a lively and fun little spot with great food, great service, and a vibrant atmosphere. The menu is not your standard, boring, safe-as-houses fare, I love watching busy kitchen staff bustling about, and this open plan restaurant is great for doing that. Do go to Leslie Jones if you are an outgoing person who likes to have a boisterous good time in a high-decibel environment. Don't go to Leslie Jones if you need to have a quiet, private conversation, or are a low-talker."}
{"text":"We found Lesley Jones courtesy of Yelp and while I saw some mixed reviews, our experience was outstanding. We went for a pre show dinner at 6:00ish so it was not very busy. The decor is very chic in an understated way that is welcoming from jeans to formal. The reception is super friendly. The staff was over the top accommodating. But we are here for the food and it was absolutely to notch. I started with the mussels followed by the beef brisket. My companion had the best salad followed by the risotto.  Both were come back for more of the same good although there were more to tempt. I would highly recommend. I'm going back at the first chance."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite restaurants! Amazing food, relaxed atmosphere. The Stacked Eggplant is soooo good, as is the beet salad. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We arrived early on a Saturday evening and greeted by friendly staff for a seat on the back patio. 

Our beers were brought to us quickly. We shared the beet salad ($9). It was fresh with the perfect amount of dressing.  For our main courses we had the daily fish ($19) and the piri piri pulled pork ($18).

We noticed the portions were very large. The flavours were outstanding - fresh, natural without a lot of grease and not overly spicy.

No dessert for us, as the main courses were plentiful.

The only critique I had for the back patio was the loud rap music coming from the neighbours' next door. I guess it adds a little flare to the evening!"}
{"text":"The super salad isn't that super. We were staying close by and thought the menu looked good. I was pretty hungry and got the super salad, which comes in two sizes. I got the bigger of the two for $21. It was smaller than some appetizer salads I've had. The chicken was cut into tiny cubs and I imagine if I put them all together it would probably be 2oz of chicken. I was still hungry. The ambiance and service were great. But if you're hungry, you might have to order a few items."}
{"text":"Lovely little restaurant in the Leslieville area. It has a casual yet intimate ambience. I would recommend reservations as the place was quite full by 8pm. I really enjoyed the beef brisket, the mushroom risotto with pulled pork (this was a special) and the escargot. Wash all this down with a negroni and you're good to go. 
The service was stellar. Our server was friendly and attentive which makes the experience that much more enjoyable. 
The back patio area looks really nice but unfortunately it was a rainy day in Toronto. So I'm looking forward to coming back on a sunny day and enjoying more eats at this Leslieville joint."}
{"text":"We LOVE this place. Lovelovelove! 
Thanks to a TTC detour we were forced to walk down Leslieville and came across this little gem. The place has a character that, well if they were a person you would just want to be their friend. 
Their 'Hello my name is sign' caught our eye but it was their daily menu and dishes of the table at the front door that reeled us in. The place has a great vibe, fun and cool and very inviting. The service team greeted us and made us feel at home during our entire time there. We opted for the back patio and it was an absolute delight with their vined and lit fences.
Ordering was a fun challenge because there were so many things we wanted to order (baked polenta, grilled calamari salad, beet salad, zucchini and lemon goat cheese pizza, Atlantic cod with tarragon sauce- the list goes on). We opted for the pizza, calamari salad and polenta, as well as the avocado salad. 
The staff was the friendliest and very attentive as they made sure that our citrus water was always full (it was a no drink kind of day but their cocktail and wine list was pretty tempting). Food was served in no time and we devoured every bite. 
For so many reasons we will be back again, with family, friends or a hot date. I highly recommend you check this place out if you're looking for a cool, comfortable place to wine and dine at with good company (or bad company... This place is so lovely you won't even care:)
Also, this place only a $$, not $$$ as listed above.
Happy eating!"}
{"text":"I have to admit, I was sold on the backyard patio. I came into Leslie Jones with high hopes based off of the reviews I've read on Yelp. When I called to make reservations for a Friday night (on a Friday night!) I was pleasantly surprised that i was able to get a spot on the patio during the time prime of 7:30. Unfortunately though, i have come to these conclusions after my underwhelming dining experience:

1. The food portions were quite small for the price you pay for.
2. The service was extremely slow. It took a long time for food to come out, and the servers were consistently swamped the whole evening, even when the restaurant wasn't full. 
3. Overall, the food was tasty, but for a $60 bill, neither my partner nor I walked out feeling full. 

Oh well. It's good to try new restaurants but unfortunately this won't be one I will be return to."}
{"text":"Thank you, Serendipity. *4.5 stars.

It was my intention to stop into Queen Margherita for dinner, but when I landed a parking spot just east of Jones, I tossed that idea, sparked up my Yelp app and decided on Leslie Jones ... which was directly to my right. 

Now, not to brag, but I've probably learned well over 13 things in my life and one of them was certainly Don't Fcuk With Serendipity. So I didn't.

Moments after we walked in, the decision was obviously the right one: a very friendly welcome from the hostess and the chefs who, like Will A mentioned, cook on an old electric stove, so stop blaming your instruments people! 

We ordered two apps (avocado salad, beet salad) and two entrees (Our fav pizza, braised beef brisket) and all four were winners. 

The salads were light, fresh and packed full of flavor. 

As for the brisket, well, to state that the braised beef brisket was melt in your mouth, like butter, or even shreddable with a limp cucumber would all be spot-on and maybe I wanted to roll around naked in it, but that would be a waste of good meat (the brisket).

The brisket sides were small, perfectly roasted morsels of potato and brussel sprouts with unadvertised truffle oil. I used to think that only bacon made everything taste better but, in my world, there's going to be a knock-down, drag out fight with truffle oil. Delish!

As our server advised, call ahead for reservations as they often hold special events."}
{"text":"Had a very enjoyable dinner. Warm spinach salad to share, beef brisket for her and pasta with chicken and sausage for me. Desserts were well done too. A bit noisy, but will plan to come back."}
{"text":"I am thinking the staff at Leslie Jones read these reviews because my husband and I really enjoyed the food and service tonight!  Absolutely loved the stuffed eggplant and salmon dinner.  The potato, leek and kale soup was tasteless but the rest of the dinner made up for it!  Thanks for the great evening out!"}
{"text":"A great place to take a date which will impress but won't clean your wallet out; everything on the menu is under $20. It's got the usual eclectic bistro decor of candle light, exposed brick and local art all over the walls for sale. There is an open kitchen concept and the music they play all comes from a turntable in the back.
   The menu matches the vibe with a range of pizzas with funky toppings, pastas and daily entrees of meat and veggie dishes. The food and portions were pretty good and the server who was a total character gave us a small complimentary app. 
   I would suggest calling ahead on the weekends to get a table, we scooped up the last free one because we came earlier in the evening.  
   All-in-all, a great restaurant that I would patronize again."}
{"text":"Had dinner with some old friends at Leslie Jones last night.  Back patio was nice and the service was good.  But all of our dishes (first course and mains) were too salty.  It was odd because there was a lot of flavour in the dishes and didn't need all that salt.  Have spoken to some other friends that are familiar with the place and the same experience for them so they are consistently too salty.  
I won't go back.  My blood pressure can't handled it."}
{"text":"From the name tag-inspired front sign to the cozy indoor space (the kitchen is totally open and really small) to the lovely back patio, Leslie Jones screams cute little place to eat.  Unfortunately, the food didn't live up to the atmosphere in my books.   I had tried the risotto, which likely another review had mentioned, was overcooked and the flavours didn't impress.  It does seem like I may have been there on an off-nite, so perhaps worth a revisit!"}
{"text":"What a cute little place! Stopped in for a casual dinner with my SO on a chilly January night, and Leslie Jones did not disappoint. From the fun drink list (my favorite is the Dirty Shirley Temple, which sort of tastes like Tang), to the delicious antipasti platter, to the tender brisket entree with roasted winter vegetables, and finally to the absolutely awesome carrot cake (no raisins! YAY!) -- everything was great. Husband's haddock in lemon caper sauce was overcooked and a bit rubbery, though. The attentive and friendly service more than made up for that blip, though. 

The food at Leslie Jones isn't fancy -- it's American comfort food, raised up a notch. If I lived in the neighborhood, I'd definitely be back more often."}
{"text":"Excellent establishment. I visited here on Friday night with my girlfriend. The place is quite small but the atmosphere is great. The food was excellent! I had the Peri Peri Pork which was amazing! I will definitely be back here again."}
{"text":"I've been here numerous times and the food and service does not disappoint.  The service can be a bit slow when the restaurant is jam packed, but seriously, what restaurant isn't like that?!

The complimentary hummus with crostini is a great start.  The appetizer platter is the go-to for sharing.  I've had the braised beef, piri piri pork, risotto, seafood linguini and all were delicious.  It's tough to decide sometimes!

Desserts are all housemade and never disappoint.  The flourless chocolate torte is great for chocolate lovers.  The carrot cake is moist with a thin layer of cream-cheese icing that doesn't overpower the cake.  The cheese cakes are great too!

It can get busy on the weekend so reservations are recommended."}
{"text":"Did not particularly enjoy my meal there.  Tried a couple entrees but nothing stood out at all.  Not sure what all the hype is about.  Food is ok, but does not make me jump up and down."}
{"text":"Being a Breeder, Leslieville is a perfect place to live. Espresso shops are open super early for the weekend morning strolls (ugh) as well as access to some great parks and playgrounds. But for the elusive \"date night\" with Mrs Breeder, we tend to avoid all child friendly places. Enter Leslie Jones!

The previous reviews are right, Leslie Jones is a great place for a date. This is a spot we continue to visit. All candle lit tables, exposed brick walls and open kitchen.Washrooms are great, clean and modern with a hint of incense. The backyard patio is literally a back yard. It's excellent and the best patio in this area for a drink. 

 My dinner was excellent. Slow cooked brisket with a side of pureed butternut squash and root vegetables. I love how they threw in Brussels sprout to make it quirky.  The SO had the daily risotto with Chorizo sausage but it felt a tad overcooked, which is the death knell for risotto, unfortunately. Flourless chocolate tort was a big hit, though. On previous visits, the smoked salmon pizza was superb. Loaded with Kristapson's smoked salmon and capers and red onion. 

Our new date spot. Also, the chefs are super friendly, considering they probably heard our entire \"Boff, Marry or Kill\" debate. 

This spot is Greg C approved!"}
{"text":"It was a girls night out and we wanted to dine in Leslieville.  There were 5 of us and one of my friends has a gluten allergy.  The service was amazing, the food delicious and they played a great sound track!  

They were super-sensitive to our favourite celiac and all the food was super-yummy home-style goodness.  It's cozy and it would be a great date place!"}
{"text":"On the advice of Kat F. and yelpers, the wife and I headed into foreign territory tonight: Leslieville.

We made this trek specifically to check out Leslie Jones, as it sounded like our kind of place.

I loved the atmosphere and decor of the place. Very nice, clean, and laid back. The back patio was huge, but it was spitting out so we stayed inside.

She ordered the scallop linguine which was fantastic. She asked for no shrimp, and they checked to find out if she was allergic or just didn't like them... it was the latter so they were good to go.

I ordered one of tonight's specials: a duck risotto with a bit of italian sausage (actually I don't think it was italian but I forget what it was now). It was also AWESOME. wow.

However the downside: service was pretty awful.

Our waitress was very nice, but rarely stopped by even when we looked at her as she walked by.

Also our food took over an HOUR to get to us, which may be acceptable if the place was hopping but it really wasn't that busy. Also, people who showed up AFTER us received appetizers and their entrees before we got ours. We didn't even order apps.

I don't know if it was because we asked for no shrimp, that sounds kind of ridiculous.

She also tried to charge us for dessert on our bill, but we did not order any (we were too full. I wanted to try the carrot cake so bad but.. alas... stuffed!).

I almost gave it 3 stars because of this but at the end of the day, it was a great meal (if a bit pricey, specifically the wine... $9 for a 4 ounce glass? Of Australian Shiraz? Come on.) and we do want to go back.

If the service is like this next time we go (there will be a next time, the food was that good), it will be the last time and I will edit this review.

As is, I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and hope this was just a one-off.

Overall, good times, great food. Bad service."}
{"text":"One of my favourite restaurants in the city. Great service and incredible food every time. Love it here"}
{"text":"Going to keep this simple and to the point:

1 - Took 1hr 20min for entrees to be served.

2- At time of serving waitress realized she forgot to put my entree order through to the kitchen, this added another 20 minutes to my wait, so I had to wait 2 hrs for food. Explanation provided was that it is a small kitchen, yes correct it is when you see it, but it doesn't explain why people who sat down 20 minutes after us received their food prior to us receiving our food! FIRST IN, FIRST OUT (FIFO) needs to be followed.

3 - Was brought out the incorrect bottle of wine, luckily it was noticed before the waitress opened it.

4 - Felt as though the waitress was avoiding our table because she knew the food was late, this resulted in no refills on our water.

5 - The food was good once it arrived but the wait ruined it.

Due to my poor experience I will not recommend this establishment to anyone else or visit it again."}
{"text":"Great little restaurant in Leslieville. It's probably the closest thing you can get to a home cooked meal at a restaurant. It's family run and cozy. 

There's quite a variety of options ranging from pizza to pasta to veggie or meat entrees. There's a pulled pork dish that's to die for. It may be one of my favourite dishes in the city."}
{"text":"Leslie Jones is a fun place for food and friends.  It is located on Queen between Leslie and Jones, hence the name. Here are a few highlights...

1. Leslie Jones has a nice variety of pasta dishes, beef, seafood, and pizzas. I opted for the chicken pizza, which was the slightest bit too salty, but otherwise great. At 15$, it was priced in line with others around town.
2. The service here is very good, especially by Toronto standards. The chef and the server both had a real warmth and welcoming attitude that was refreshing.
3. They have a great selection of wines and spirits here.
4. The dessert here could give anyone else's dessert a run for its money. The chocolate flour less torte and the cheesecake were both smash hits at my table.
5. The space is small, clean, and inviting. It is well worth a visit here."}
{"text":"Extremely good neighborhood spot.     Appropriately named.    Unpretentious.    A variety of options.   Great portions.   Relatively nice people.   No screaming children.    Spectacular pulled pork.   Decent music.   Fresh ingredients.  Outdoor BarBQ.  Open kitchen.  Romantical patio.  Can't lose."}
{"text":"I really can't say anything negative about Leslie Jones. It's a great little spot in Leslieville and the food it it about as homemade as you can get. The staff were very friendly and helpful (we had a lot of questions about the menu), they were very patient us and made great recommendations.

We ordered the following entrees:

Braised beef brisket - with dark ale, red wine, caramelized onions
Stacked eggplant - w/ spinach, leeks, roasted peppers and goat cheese

Both of which we're really good, I would definitely recommend both options.

I did not have the dessert due to an allergy but I was told the carrot cake was incredible..."}
{"text":"We arrived for a friend's bday celebration dinner w/ reservations @ 7pm. The place was practically empty & the server was prompt. We ordered 3 apps to start - meatballs, calamari, & the platter. All were \"average\" - nothing stood out as excellent. As dinner rolled on, the place became packed & service declined considerably. It appeared like there were 3 wait staff but they were clearly over-matched. Dinner was, like the apps, avg. Chorizo risotto was bland & over-cooked. What a disappointment. Seafood linguini was better. Dessert was good but I question the $8 for a modest slice of carrot cake. We also ordered coffee - in a word, terrible. Not sure who was responsible for it, but we expected a lot better, particularly in Leslieville, where there are any # of great coffee spots (they were removed from our bill) Our server left us sitting there for a considerable time to the pt where I went to the counter & paid. While the ambience is nice & upbeat, albeit a bit noisy, the menu is nothing spectacular & the attn to detail is lacking in terms of food quality"}
{"text":"After reading all the other reviews here, I can only conclude the staff were having an off night on my first visit to Leslie Jones. I guess the tip-off should have been the bartender pouring a round of shots for the staff as we sat down at the bar, and saying, \"We need it.\" All of the waitresses did seem to be in a surly mood, and there was some confusion and dramatic sighs about a patio table that was for FOUR people but we were only two but \"I guess you can have it.\" Even though we didn't ask to have it or make any claims on it.

After we sat, the waitress took our order, then another waitress came to take our order. And then they both disappeared for a good 20 minutes -- the bowl of olives that we'd asked never to be seen. When we did finally flag someone down, we got the olives, though nothing to put the pits in or on. And the drinks menu I'd also asked for required still another trip. Then some lengthy time later our main course arrived. Except that I'd ordered an appetizer and they'd totally forgotten about that too. Oops.

I feel bad criticizing service sometimes because every restaurant and waiter or waitress can have an off night. To be fair to our waitress, she did make the appetizer on the house, and seemed honestly appreciative (or maybe surprised?) that I left a decent tip. But unfortunately, I wasn't so impressed by the food that it was that easy to overlook the service. The missing appetizer was a beet and apple salad, which was pleasant but a touch bland. My companion ordered a dijon chicken dish which was very tasty indeed, but on the other hand, they had run out of the potato salad that was one of the accompanying choices but only told us this as they served the dish. My main dish was the Hot Italian Sausage pizza. The sausage itself was nice, but the crust was just okay -- thin, but a bit too dry and a little burnt. I will say that the dessert, a sweet potato cheesecake was excellent (though the piece was a trifle small). Also, the cocktail I had at the start, a whisky and grapefruit concoction called The Bitter Waiter (expect a joke when ordering it), was delightful and refreshing.

I'm sure I'll give this place another shot to see what all the fuss is about. The patio was nice. The main room seemed cozy. Also they do take credit cards now."}
{"text":"We gave a 3 because of two things 1. The ridiculous 18% gratuity added for parties of 6 or more.  Patrons should NEVER be forced to pay anything, especially this much!!!!  And we were only 6 people!!  2.  We sat at the back near the patio door and it was open...and we had to keep closing it.  It's not summer and it was cold which made the first half of the night unbearable.  I think they finally got the hint and kept it closed.  The food was very good and fresh.  My SMALL AND TEENY Cosmo was $14.00!!!!  So, even though this place is cute and quaint and the service was nice, this party of 6 won't be returning for reasons stated above."}
{"text":"It was my first time here tonight and I had a very pleasant meal. First off, the ambiance and the decor were great. Relaxed and cool, very unpretentious but current. And our server was very nice and did really well for being the only serving staff that night. 

Started with a glass of wine (good selection, stuff you can't find at the LCBO) and split the beet salad with my friend. It was good, but not the best I've had. I had the pasta of the day which was a gnocchi with a cream and gorgonzola sauce with mushrooms and white wine. It sounded better on paper than it tasted in my mouth but I have no complaints about it. It was just a little predictable and flat in flavour and couldn't taste much of the gorgonzola, but I still ate the whole thing. Dinner ended with an absolutely wonderful slice of flourless chocolate torte and rounded off the night very nicely. 

My friend had the eggplant which was pretty great, and other dishes like the ratatouille looked wonderful too... Maybe next time. My main could have used some imagination to match the personality of the restaurant as a whole, but I would definitely come back and give their other dishes a try."}
{"text":"Went here on a Wednesday night around 7pm.  Perhaps because it wasn't too busy, we didn't encounter any horrendous wait times for our meal.  I am not saying it was served pronto because it wasn't.  But, considering the size of the kitchen and the quality of the food we had, I would say the wait was reasonable.

My friend had the seafood linguine.  I sampled a bite and I think it was very good.  I had the smoked salmon and potato pizza.  I wasn't a fan of the crust and the potatoes were too mushy for my liking, but the salmon was extremely flavorful.  I think my friend made the better call and I'm sorry I didn't get a pasta dish.  

I liked the ambiance of the place.  In particular, I liked the look of the patio, so when the weather is cooperating, I will head back here for another meal."}
{"text":"I really like this place. Its close to Hitch-- a very boring bar in my opinion. And its near The East Ender, a bit of a stuffy boring restaurant. And near the Curzon, the I don't know whether it will be empty or packed, loud or quiet bar. 
Leslie Jones really stand outs on the block. They hang local art on the walls. They have a small space that's well utilized with an exposed kitchen so you can see the chefs work on a less than fancy stove to serve up fancy meals for the whole restaurant. 
They make their whipped cream fresh which i like. They carry sparkling wine which I really like and Amsterdam Blonde, another fav. 
They have great espresso if you want to pop in at the bar like i did recently on a Saturday night---And they had room for me! Which is rare find in peak hours when Gio's and the like are packed to the gills!
Leslie Jones is filled with the aromas from the kitchen and because its so intimate you can see everyone's order which I love so I know what to try.
And while you decide they bring out a complimentary bean hummus and bread. Love it.
I have eaten dinner here once and had coffee or drinks several times.
I've always enjoyed it.
The only thing, if any, that I didn't love was having red wine in a rock glass. but the wine was good so other than that, well done neighbourhood favourite.

I just wished it opened earlier some times. 
It seems theres no where to eat in Leslieville before 6pm!"}
{"text":"Unless this was an odd off night I really don't understand how this resto has lasted this long. Our garlic bread (?) was obviously burnt but brought to the table nonetheless. I ordered a pizza which was, honestly, awful. It was very dry and lacked flavour, and everything tasted strange, I really worked at figuring out what the problem was but could not figure it out. I also found it odd that all their beer is in cans, no draft and no bottles. Weird. I see that some folks really like the place, and best wishes to you, but I won't be back."}
{"text":"As someone who lives in the neighbourhood I was very disappointed. Risotto was undercooked but seasoned okay and the super salad, well let's just say for the money it was less than super. Seriously $25 for a corkage fee in this neighbourhood? It's too bad because the server was great and the patio is quite nice, but just couldn't wait to leave, the food was that much of a let down."}
{"text":"Food is excellent! I usually get the piri piri, and it never disappoints!
However, I think they have raised their drink prices, and $14 for a good cocktail is too rich for my blood.  Stick with the food, and skip the drinks if you want to keep your bill down."}
