{"text":"Took my family here for my dad's birthday dinner and I conclude with one word \"disappointment\".   From the get go the service is least you can expect from a place that has the word \"gourmet\" in it.  There were no recommendations from the waitresses despite the restaurant being fully staffed on a Monday evening.  The set dinner B was chosen which came to $97 before tips. Portions are decent sized for a Chinese restaurant claiming \"Chiu Chow\" fusion. The spicy pork stomach soup was extremely spicy and hot in temperature which was promising start. Everything else following it was dish after dish of disappointment served at fast food pace. The so called \"Chiu Chow\" dishes were nothing but bogus renamed dishes from canton style. Dishes include: tofu cold duck with tofu, fried fish, veggies with mushrooms, fried lobster, spicy stir fry chicken. Finally the Dessert was purple sesame toro mix. The mixture was so thick you could of mistaken it as congee or Heinz baby food.  Overall there is nothing \"Chiu Chow\" about it and is unmatched with local Chinese restaurants in Markham. The \"gourmet\" is just to fool you to dine and pay extra for their fast food service. If you want fast food I'm sure the food courts at first Markham place can do a lot better at half their price. Let's hope that there will be a legit \"Chiu chow\" eatery soon to redeem it's name because clearly the Chiu chow tasty menu items are unfound."}
{"text":"This is my second time returning to Oriental Gourmet and I have to say their food is unique and different from other Chinese food I had.   To start off with, I think service was like any other asian restaurants in the area.  Weeekends are always packed and definitely should consider making a reservation ahead of time to ensure you're seated in a timely manner.  I would give it a 3 star for service.    As for food, I love all their specialty Chiu Chow food but particularly I think the pumkin ramen is my favourite.  It's the broth that I find it very tasty.  I ordered it with shredded chicken and I was expecting the chicken to be on a dryer side but to my surprise it's actually very lean and moist.... Kudos to that!  My sister thinks the lobster with pumpkin sauce was done very well.  Generally she doesn't like the taste of lobster because of the tough meat and bland taste.  As for this dish she quoted \" I approve\".  That's a biggie because this girl is very critical when it comes to food."}
{"text":"I agree. What's with the initial bad reviews? The food is very good. The service is better than the one in TO. Looks better. It's bigger, but since they jam the place with tables, it's still tight. Would be a 5* if not for this reason. This place is busy at night. Lots of loyal customers from the old establishment. You need to order the Chiu Chow dishes, that's their specialty!  Maybe it should get a low rating and scare people away and I can have this place all to myself and no waits. But that's too late...."}
{"text":"Despite the fact that I are flies last time, the food was impressive enough for me to give them another try.  No flies this time and food was still amazing. ..  I will come back again!"}
{"text":"For Chiu Chow cuisine in TO. This is as good as it get.  I was dumbfounded reading some of the reviews on non Chiu Chow item. Simple question: Why on earth would you order \"Soya -western\" here, OMG! OG is famous for its Chiu Chow dishes, you have yourself to blame for ordering their non Chiu Chow item. Spaghetti with black pepper chicken steak? That's like going into a french Bistro and order Yong chow fried rice and expect it to be good. WTFIWWU?  We have a famous saying : \"There is no medicine for stupidity\" Stick with what they are good at and you will not be disappointed. The\"Fish skin \"dumpling with their famous fish broth is legit. This is Chinese soul food, I can eat a gallon of that broth on this own. The Orange peel braised duck leg noodle is just as perfect, not to mentioned you get a full 1/4 of a duck for the price of a \"unhappy meal\" at McD\"s. The #1 chef is now at this location, the Silver star Blvd location I found is still quite good, but it was a tad too salty for me and that location is only good for another week or so or  until the end of this month. The sugar cane smoked duck is the bomb, so tender and the smoky fragrant is intoxicating. Before tasting it at OG, I have only heard of it from foodie travel shows. Will the Chiu Chow food here will ever be as good as it is in HK? No, don't even kid yourself, no fault to the chefs, but we don't have the necessary ingredients in Canada. But for Toronto, we should count our blessings as this is simply the best place to ease your Chiu Chow craving until you can fly back to HK to taste the real thing. I can't wait to get enough people to try their private dinning menu."}
{"text":"Sadly. It is not as good as the old place.  Quality has gone down  It seems the chef has changed.  The chicken has a completely different taste. The pig intestine soup is not sour at all.   I wish the old place is back"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a Friday night.  The restaurant did not look busy at 6:30 pm but I noticed at 7, a line began forming.  We got a set meal and the food was fantastic!  What stood out and worth reviewing was the freshness of the food.  Not too salty, or over processed like most other Chinese restaurants.  The simple but distinct style made the ingredients stand out (not muddled in sauce).     Service was mediocre at best but that's not a deal breaker for Chinese cuisine.  Will be returning with family."}
{"text":"Oriental Gourmet is tucked away in this little plaza across from Markville mall.  The entrances and exits have no traffic lights and could be a bit hectic to get into and out of during busy hours.  It's a small restaurant with a mouldy looking lobster tank at the front and close to no waiting area.  I've sat at the front of the restaurant and other people who were waiting were literally sitting next to me in my booth.  There's a wide variety of fried rice/steamed rice/noodles/soupy rice (Chiu Chow style).  I must say all the food comes out of the kitchen very hot and quite flavourful.  Most of their rice dishes are amazing, while their veggie dishes are nothing special and overpriced.  No lunch menu which includes drinks or combos but there are items which are 'cheaper' for lunch time.  Would much prefer if they came out with a lunch menu which includes drinks and smaller portions."}
{"text":"The main style of cooking here is chiu chow, and their dishes are usually quite tasty. In particular, their satay beef is delicious, and their lo sui duck is also up to par. The portion sizes are fairly decent.  If you are interested in trying chiu chow cooking, this is a good option in the Markham region. There aren't many top notch chiu chow restaurants left, and this is definitely one of the better ones. Be warned though, the parking lot can get very hectic during busy nights as it shares a plaza with multiple restaurants, all of which are popular. You may also want to make reservations here, as they do occasionally fill up."}
{"text":"I used to love this place, but every time I come back, it seems to not be as good as the last. This time was definitely a drop off.   Black Pepper Pig Stomach Soup: fills about 6 bowls - not very flavourful but definitely lots of pepper involved.   1/2 Duck: comes with 6 slices of tofu! some duck pieces came with feathers still in - very average overall.   Pan fried Radish Omelette: I don't believe this is on the menu - my mom just mentioned it and they made it. Staple dish - can't go wrong!   Stir Fried Spicy Shredded Pork with Chinese Broccoli: we waited very long for this, then it was cold yet it has steam coming off... we checked the middle and it wasn't hot either. We waited really long for it to be heated again. HARD PASS. Meat was tough to chew through, and the tofu had a strong burnt smell. The only redeeming quality was the greens.   Mashed Taro Dessert: if you like taro, it's pretty good! Doesn't look good, but it's worth a try if you have $6 to spare lol. It's like a mashed potato version of taro, but sweet.  Taro Sago Soup: free, but just say no so you don't waste it. You're not missing out on anything.    Also took FOREVER to get the bill, then FOREVER for the change."}
{"text":"This place is the new location for a very old restaurant that was located at silver star blvd. It is one of the few chiu chow restaurants left in toronto. And the food is good. The service like always leaves much to be desired. But the price. Food. And portion makes it one of the best available choices for chiu chow food. It is definitely a sit in restaurant. Take out would not do it justice. I would recommend people try this place in person. Although they do a lot of cantonese dishes. Try the chiu chow dishes like the smoked duck. Or the satay beef noodlem chiu chow style satay is not the same as usual places since it has a more peanut flavour and you will taste the difference. I would recommend those who want to try a different ethnic group of chinas food . Try it you wont regret it"}
{"text":"This place specializes in Chiu Chow Chinese food. It was pretty delicious! We didn't like the Chiu Yeung Style Marinated Assorted Platter, definitely do not get that. Otherwise everything else was a recommend. We had the Maggi beef, Chicken and Corn Soup, Gai Lan, Oyster Omelet, and Pork and Preserved Olive Hot Pot rice.   Place was clean and the wait staff filled our tea several times.  Can't wait to try more dishes next time we come!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was one of many on a new ordering app that launched recently. This was the second on the list that I tried.  The menu items was a shrimp with broccoli on rice plus soup. I left the office early to make sure that I arrive right when the order was ready. When I arrived to pickup the order, there were two others waiting with me as the staff were putting together the orders.  From my past two experiences, the other restaurant had several orders ready to go before the pickup time. Time management is key since the whole purpose of ordering earlier was to minimize the wait while having a fresh lunch.  Although the meal was hot when I ate it, it took them about 3 minutes upon my arrive to give it to me.  In terms of the meal, it was average but the shrimp was large. The soup was not my cup of tea as I do not like hot and sour soup."}
{"text":"Went for weekday lunch menu.  Restaurant was only 1/3 full.  Menu has lots of options.  Appetizers, soup noodle, soup rice and stirfried noodles.  Specials came with coffee or milk tea.  We had the special rice noodle soup which came with variety of fish balls, dumpling and seaweed.  Pretty good portion at $9.  The steamed rice in basket was small portion for $11 but very tasty.  Food came very quickly.  Would visit again since it's a nice change from our regular lunch options.  Next time will try the duck leg noodle and the fried fish skin appetizer (which was ordered by every table)."}
{"text":"This is one of my family's go-to neighbourhood restaurants. It's conveniently located across from Markville Mall. The place is always busy, especially on the weekend. The food is very authentic Southern Chinese style. Their duck is my favourite, the meat is so juicy and flavourful. Their stone pot stews are also great. I like the curry beef stew. Overall, the service is very fast, and the food is decently priced with good quality."}
{"text":"Edwin C. is right. This is the best Chiu Chow restaurant left in Toronto. I'm half Chiu Chow and my family usually defaults to Oriental Gourmet when we go out for dinner. There used to be an Oriental Gourmet on Silver Star but it closed down and there used to be a really solid Chiu Chow restaurant on Leslie/Finch a couple of years ago that folded as well. Now that I'm done my trip down memory lane, let's get right to business. Chili oil is supposed to be a specialty of Chiu Chow cuisine. It adds a good kick of spice and flavor to just about any dish (warning: Chiu Chow chili oil is made with lots of garlic). If you can handle the heat, drizzle that stuff on everything.  My staple dishes are the: chicken with vegetable, fried shrimp and cuttlefish balls, fried noodles with seafood in XO sauce, pig tripe soup, and Chiu Yeung style smoked duck on sugar cane.  Chicken with vegetable sounds a bit vague but it's chicken that is seasoned with Sichuan peppercorns and fried with basil leaves. It's not spicy but very fragrant. Fried shrimp and cuttlefish balls are paired with a thick sweet and savory sauce. Inside the fried shrimp balls are diced water chestnuts to give it some crunch. I prefer the cuttlefish balls because they're chewy without being tough.  Fried noodles with seafood in XO sauce is a mixture of shrimp, squid, cuttlefish, scallops, chives, carrots, bean sprouts, chili peppers and onions stir fried with rice noodles (sometimes Udon) and XO sauce. The scallops are thin but they're wide! My friends who tried it last time thought they were about to spit fire so don't add the chili oil till you tried the noodles as is first! The pork tripe soup has a very strong gamey scent to it and can be off-putting to some. I love the texture of pig tripe and the generous slices of ginger and peppercorn makes it perfect for cold winters! Last but not least, the smoked duck on sugar cane is phenomenal. It smells as amazing as it tastes. The duck is smokey, sweet and juicy. Pour the duck fat/smoked sauce on the plate into a bowl of white rice and I guarantee you'll ask for more white rice. (Pro-tip: don't do this when you're on a low carb diet.) To finish it off, OG gives you a bowl of Chinese soup dessert as a freebie after dinner. If you can still stomach more food, may I recommend the taro balls?"}
{"text":"My family and I have eaten here once, and have had their take-out many, many times since then! Their service is mediocre, they don't have that many staff on the floor, and sometimes service can be a bit slow, but it's generally tolerable.  Their food is absolutely amazing, and definitely worth the price you pay.  It's cheaper than your average lunch/dinner restaurant and, honestly, their food really doesn't fall short of expectations.  Their oyster cake is on the expensive end, but well worth it! Their soy-sauce duck and tofu is also a classic, and is always done wonderfully, with just the right amount of saltiness!  Their take-out for a group of 2, is around $30 but can most definitely feed a family of 3, almost always with some leftovers.  That being said, their take-outs are definitely a good deal, coming along with soup and rice, which is why we tend to get their take-outs instead of eating in.  A word of caution though, they're almost always filled to the brim at nights, especially on Fridays/weekends, so be sure to head in early to make a reservation before you go!"}
{"text":"2.5**  New place that took over level up restaurant...opened for merely 2 weeks...   It's nothing remarkable..not worth waiting table for.. go next door... Congee Queen serves better food and more efficient service...   Ordered baked black pepper sauce chicken spaghetti. It was clearly not baked. Its pan fried chicken on top of spaghetti with minimal sauce and lots of black peppered flakes...bland..  Fish soup vermicelli was so wrong...bland, with no taste..vermicelli hasn't been soaked correctly...please a big restaurant like this and your chefs can't soak vermicelli correctly... are you joking me? It was like a yard of noodles inseparable. Sighs...  Also ordered vegetables with oyster sauce.. didn't end up coming after 30 mins so decided to cancel and leave...  Not a place I'm desperate to come back to...meh!"}
{"text":"Let's be honest, cheap eats with decent quality is always a plus. We frequent this location for family dinners because you get the best bang for your buck here. For an entire meal with 6 dishes (2 of which consists of lobsters or crabs), it costs less than $200 and feeds at least 8 people. We always end up with take out boxes too. The service is decent, you save when you pay in cash and overall the food is pretty decent. The decor is not amazing but it is comfortable enough."}
{"text":"A great place for a traditional chinese dinner, the food tastes like really good home cooking. I appreciate that the dishes aren't doused in oil, pickled in salt or overly fried. It feels like you are trying to be somewhat healthy and don't need to immediately make better food choices after the meal. I would highly recommend the Chiu Yueng Style Marinated Duck. It's well seasoned, slightly sweet and not as fatty as most duck dishes. A great dish that is worth reordering again.   The service seem to be a little confused during my latest visit. They delivered one out of three dishes, but the next dish they brought us was the complementary dessert. Our waitress seemed as confused as we were when we pointed that out, but she seemed to figure it out somehow and the rest of the dinner went fine. I would not hesitant to point out if things aren't quite correct, it seems to help them along."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Scarborough location since this location has opened.  Heard the chef from Scarborough is now in this location.  The service is better here.  Will stick to their chui chow food after tried their baked pork chop with tomato.  This location is as packed as Scarborough.  Be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"I have been to both locations of Oriental Gourmet.  The seating and decoration are better at Hwy 7 location, hands down.  For food, both locations are about the same to me, which is meh unless the dishes are old fashioned Chiu Chow dishes.  I actually enjoy the Chiu Chow dishes, like the chicken, the dessert balls.  Once I order the Cantonese dishes, they taste boring.  The ingredients are fresh nevertheless.  The pricing is average as per this neighbourhood.  The services is friendly but insufficient because they are understaffed.    Dinner reservation seriously recommended."}
{"text":"Came here on Christmas day to have lunch with the family. I was pleasantly surprised with the dishes we ordered. Everything tasted really good.   Meal started off with beef flat noodles. Comes with some veggies. The sauce they used was really tasty. I can't really describe it but I know I have had this sauce before and I really liked the taste of it. Lots of beef to be had and the dish is fairly large so that it can be shared.  Our second dish was a hotpot rice with pork neck. The rice was nice and soft on the top and the bottom had the nicely crusted crunchy rice. It gave the meal a great texture when eating with the pork. The pork neck itself was soft and tender. Another great dish to share.  Our third dish was the sticky rice which is wrapped in a bun. You can find these at dim sum sometimes. The outer part of the bun was thick and soft. The sticky rice inside was also soft. It only comes in three pieces. It was so good I was tempted to order another set but I held off knowing that we still had a dessert coming.  For dessert we got the taro, custard, lotos seed balls. Comes with six all together. Soft and really yummy. Not overly sweet and a perfect way to end lunch.  Two of the meals came with milk tea which surprised us.  Everything came to about $40 after tax.  Service was fast and efficient."}
{"text":"There's no avoiding this place for me now since the Scarborough branch closed down. For what it's worth, I have noticed some improvements in my most recent visits.  I ordered the same items as my initial review: Shredded chicken and jellyfish, cuttlefish rolls, and satay beef fried noodle. The jellyfish was better this time and actually tasted good, but the shredded chicken was a step back from what it was before. The cuttlefish rolls were actually very good, and definitely something I recommend others order. Finally, the satay beef fried noodles had a very unique satay sauce that tasted very good, though the beef was still on the dry side.  Upon showing the 10% off card that doesn't work anymore in the Scarborough location, one of the employees decided to give me the 10% off card that works for this restaurant. Therefore, I get 10% discounts now in my future visits!  I still would have preferred the Scarborough branch, but since that one doesn't exist anymore, this will have to do. At least there's been improvements from my review 2 years ago, and I have acknowledged that."}
{"text":"?? ???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????  ????????????/????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????  ???????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"This is the same restaurant as the one at Silver Star Blvd. I'm not sure if the other restaurant has the afternoon tea menu but this one does! My favourite dishes to get here off their afternoon menu are: pork chop bun, curry chicken and fish cutlet bun. For their afternoon tea menu, you get a complimentary drink (coffee/tea) and dessert. It's a pretty good deal and the food is delicious!"}
{"text":"Lunch and afternoon tea! This place has Chiu Chow food at an affordable price. All combos come with multiple goodies. Their pepper tripe soup is super spicy and delicious, it really wakes up your senses. Food is affordable and its not super busy so you never feel like you are being rushed. I enjoyed my lunch/afternoon tea here and would probably come back. I would recommend ordering Chiu Chow food, I mean that is the main focus!!"}
{"text":"Just ate here. Absolutely satisfying. The duck was amazing. The pig stomach soup was great. But by far all i can say is the duck was the best!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this place a 5 star because there are no good Chiu chow restaurants in Toronto and this is the best one I've been to in the city.   The satay beef is a must as it is flavourful and the beef is tender.   My personal favourite is the oyster omelette, as the oysters are rich and the fish sauce really enhances the flavours and balance the dish.   The lo sui duck (old water duck is the literal translation) is not that strong as there are places in Toronto that are not Chiu chow but do a better job.   If you are there early the chef will make a sugar/vinegar noodles which isn't on the menu but it is a Chiu chow speciality.   It does get busy at night so either make a reservation or go early."}
{"text":"Oh dear. Oriental Gourmet has seriously dropped their standards.  I came on a Saturday with my fam and you can  physically see the crowd has actually dwindled.  We got sat down pretty quick but damn the restaurant was so crowded that it was like a one-lane sidewalk for both ways... We ordered and the food came out pretty quick.  1. We got the jellyfish and shredded chicken appetizer. - The jelly was not chewy and smooth as it was before ... and we found the LONGEST piece of hair intertwined - The chicken appetizer was okay ... but it was very, very, very skimpy 2. We got the sweet & sour pork - This dish was actually delicious :) but the waitress dropped it onto our table and just walked away. Dude... 3. We got the clams - They were so small, SO FREAKING SMALL, and at least 6 of them weren't \"opened\" which means they weren't fully cooked. 4. Scallops and green beans - No. The scallops were definitely fake and the beans were undercooked; giving you that raw bean taste.  The waitress came and started clearing our plates before we were even done! She didn't ask and was like: \"ok the dessert (red bean soup) is coming!\" As I was still shovelling rice into my mouth...  Nope. Goodbye."}
{"text":"I love their pepper pig tripe soup, which is one of their signatures. All the other Chiu Chow dishes I have had here were very good in terms of taste and portions. They always give free dessert which is better than your average free dessert at Chinese restaurants. Overall it is very clean and the service is decent, so it is a good restaurant for family dinners."}
{"text":"I love the food and lunch special offers at the first location of Oriental Gourmet in Scarborough.  I suffered through tight dirty restaurant space, non smiling and rude waitress to eat all the delicious chiu chow food..one of the best or even the best in Toronto.  I was more than excited that Oriental Gourmet opens up in Markham. This is heaven in here. Clean and spacious space and with the same menu.   I ordered my usual Chiu Chow Fishball noodle in fish broth ($5.95) and Pan Fried Chives Dumpling ($3.95). When I inhaled and tasted that milky fish broth, I almost have tears in my eyes...  Parking though maybe a major problem in this smallish plaza, I suggest to come during off hour."}
{"text":"I was heartbroken when the old Oriental Gourmet closed because it was super closed to where I live. However, I'm pleased to announce that the quality of the food at the new location has not changed! The new location is bigger, more spacious, but still as busy as ever! If you're going for dinner, especially on a weekend, I would highly recommend making a reservation beforehand.   They still have the best pepper pork tripe soup in the city!"}
{"text":"Food is alright, but the service ruined it for me. The waitresses all look like they would have rathered stab themselves with a fork than do their jobs.   We asked a waitress to bring us a second menu and she straight up sighed as if we were causing her some great inconvenience. When we were giving the waitress our order, she walked away before we even finished ordering and never came back. We had to call over another waitress to finish taking our order. I was in disbelief.   The attitude of the staff just put a damper on the whole experience. Even if the food was good, the service left a bitter taste in my mouth.  Not coming back."}
