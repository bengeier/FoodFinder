{"text":"I went to Jadon Foods to get a gluten free dairy free cake for a close friend.  I was so excited because I saw Jadon make gluten free cakes that actually looked very good.  I was a little worried because this was a very last minute.  I went in on a Friday and asked about making the Lemon Raspberry cake and to my surprise Jane (the owner) was able to make one for me.  She actually came in on Saturday morning (the day they were closed) just to accommodate me.  Jane went above and beyond to assist me, and on top of that, they cake was delicious.  My friend loved it.  Jane you have earned another client.  thank you so much."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I contacted them for a last minute birthday cake for my 82 year old aunt that was visiting Vegas. Not only did they take the order on short notice, but stayed in contact with me to ensure that I got what I needed! My aunt was very pleased with the lemon raspberry cake. All of her guests were in awe because most had not had a gluten free cake and could not believe how delicious it was. Great service, great products and you feel the sense of pride they take in their products. And Rose is the best, very nice lady. This is the place to go!!"}
{"text":"I ordered gluten-free cupcakes for my son's birthday party from here. They were absolutely delicious. I told my friends/family after they ate one that they were all gluten free and everyone was shocked they were so delicious and tasted like a regular bakery cupcake. The baker asked questions to determine exactly what I needed and everything came out perfect. Price was fair also. I will definitely use Jadon Foods again and I highly recommend them for gluten free goodness"}
{"text":"Amazing bakery, I walked four times now and every time someone new and nicer greats me. They are thank me for my business and gave me a bunch of samples and not a single thing was too sweet or anything but favorful. Vegan options and they have healthy alternatives to sweetS. They will take orders as well which is great. Absolutely love it, they need to stock up on the hemp cookies though. I recommend it."}
