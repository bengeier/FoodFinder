I'll definitely visit again to try other menu items. The Chicago sausage sounds appealing.   All of my neighbors have had great things to say about this place too.  Stop in and enjoy the nice ambience or order to go...I think you'll like it."}

The Chicago Beef sandwich, was simply put the best sandwich I've ever eaten. I still want to know how the owner makes a tater tot taste so delicious and crunchy, but fluffy inside. Don't take my word for it, go visit!!!"}

{"text":"Best kept secret in Mathews dining! Classic Cheeseburger was exceptional and Italian Sausage Sandwich was fantastic. This place was a little hidden from the street as it is on the back corner of the building that houses the kebab restaurant. It was absolutely worth the effort to locate it. Owners and staff were excellent and inviting and you could tell they take pride in not only their food but their service as well. I highly recommend and I look forward to my next opportunity to dine here. I have heard their dinners are amazing as well so that is our next trip."}
{"text":"GREAT sandwich. You know, the one in all these reviews. Super friendly staff. Yelp should remove the veggie pasta from the \"favorites\" section of the menu. It is not available. I'll be honest, I was glad they were out because I got to try the sandwich."}
