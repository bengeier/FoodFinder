{"text":"Went to visit the area and saw the new donut shop. Taste as good as Donuts from California. Love it."}
{"text":"I want to first said that I absolutely love bosa donuts, I was so excited to have one so close to home. I have tried it five times now so I feel like I have given it a lot of chances, and each time is more disappointing than the last. They do not have the donut selection like other bosa donut places, once they ran out of glaze!!! The people who work range from being rude to being completely confused on what is going on. I hope this place is becomes better."}
{"text":"Pretty good doughnuts. Nothing good or bad to say about this place. Doughnuts are middle of the road, I've always had pretty good service."}
{"text":"This is one of Bosa's smaller locations, but their employees were just as friendly and the donuts just as delicious as their larger stores! It was perfect for a quick, quiet after school treat for my kids."}
{"text":"I have now made this our go to Bosa!!! Services awesome donuts are awesome I just wish they had a drive thru but I gave up on the drive thru at our closest one because the service was terrible and we always get great service at this location"}
{"text":"Don't even want to give a 1 right now. Brought my autistic son here to get a donut. He dropped his on the floor and so we got in line to get a new one. The customers in line saw this and let us go ahead to get a new one. Nancy who made sure I got her name of NANCY started to make the sand which then the drinks the customer before us ordered. There were multiple times when she was just standing there waiting for the drinks and the food to be ready. My son who was waiting as patiently as he could kept saying I dropped my donut on the floor I need a new one. (I was ready to pay for a new one) When making the drinks she even acknowledged that he needed a donut as she said in a rude tone \"there's people in front of you kid\". After that my son still waited at the register. He started very quietly pressing the bell at the register. After waiting at the register for over 5 min and him pressing the bell the last time she looked at him and rolled her eyes. When I called her out on rolling her eyes at a child and a autistic one at that she said maybe you should just control him. You could have held his arms down. Ummm you are standing there waiting for food to cook, give the kid a donut and have me pay when you are done. Nope instead she says how busy she has been even though she was sitting down when we came in doing nothing. Yes there was a line at this point and everyone in the store saw and heard how she was talking about a child. When asked when the managers are I she said the morning and when asked her name she was sure everyone in the store knew how to spell it. Love the donuts but she needs some better customer service and multi tasking skills. Worst part we walked out without getting his replacement donut and if you have a kid yet a special needs one, you know how hard that it. Glad there are other donut stores around."}
{"text":"I was originally really excited they were putting in a Bosa's close to my home. First batch of donuts I bought and brought home were pretty good, but you could they definitely did not spend time training their employees on how serve the customer and work the register before opening.  The 2nd and 3rd visits were even more disappointing.  I ordered hot chocolate for my daughters and it was disgusting, it's basically from one of those convenient store all in one \"cappuccino and hot cocoa\" machines, except they don't know how to use it half the time. Then the coffee, if you want to call it that, is just lukewarm flavored water, definitely not fresh and not proportioned with grounds and water. Amazingly enough, the person behind the counter had no idea how to toast/warm a bagel, then the owner just berated the poor kid for not knowing in front of us and the other customers in the shop. She, the owner, turned to me and said that the person was new. There's a definite need for training and better management skills. Sandwiches are good, and priced well. Best donut is the buttermilk, but be careful because it is rich and very sweet."}
{"text":"Went there today and had two donuts and a hot chocolate. Very, very good. Very nice people too."}
{"text":"I like to try out new places with coupons so I went here with a Bosa coupon.  The coupon didn't have this location listed so they wouldn't take it.  LAME!  I left because they're too stingy!  I used to have two retail stores and would take whatever coupons got people in my doors."}
{"text":"I ordered a French Cappuccino, a turkey sandwich on croissant bread with the works, a croissant by itself, a single powdered donut and a single sugar donut. First the sandwich, made by a very lovely young woman, was perfect she didn't overload it and was very tasty, she will make a fine wife, :). Now the donuts, were very soft, powdered and sugared just right, and it's 5 pm. The croissant was flaky , buttered just right, nicely done, will be coming here again :)"}
{"text":"Let's be honest here...I once went here after a training run waiting on my girlfriend when we were first dating and needed to wait for her to get back from the gym to open the door in order to take a shower.  I think that one time I bought a fritter and a chocolate long john.

Well last Sunday we went for an even dozen as her mom was sick, there was a cherry fritter and I had to go for it, and then there was the bear claw, and then there was this other apple thing which was awesome.  

I also named my fantasy team after this place...and then the Chargers because they drafted Joey Bosa...but who's gonna know?"}
{"text":"This donut shop has a good selection including toppings like bacon.  I bought a mix of one and a half dozen donuts with a coupon I had.  The kids and I sampled bites of each that appealed to us.  I found none of them to be particularly good.  All were super sugary with little other flavors or positive textures.  The old fashioned was my favorite yet was my least favorite old fashioned donut I've ever had.  I think I'll stick to Mom and Pop donut shops."}
{"text":"If you enjoy a good donut, Bosa Dounuts goes on your list!
Tasty, great selection, very busy but friendly customer service."}
{"text":"Perhaps the best donuts around, even better Rohan Crispy Creme. Yup, I said it. 10/10 as far as I'm  concerned. Well done guys. Service was so so..."}
{"text":"Outside the incredibly awesome donuts. I have to give a huge kudos for the outstanding service. I love this location and their morning staff."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place. I am not big on donuts but there are times that a plain glazed donut is necessary. Their donuts were awesome. I could only eat half because it's so sugary but my boyfriend loved it!! Coffee was okay. I wasn't blown away but coffee is coffee and I'll never say no"}
{"text":"This place is always my family and I's go to for donuts. Always fresh and fluffy and not too sweet. Their service is amazing as well, staff are always attentive and fast. Their smoothies and sandwiches are delicious. Overall a great place to stop by when you're hungry!"}
{"text":"Great donuts! We come here almost every weekend. Fresh, and soft. I am never disappointed."}
{"text":"You would think this place is a nightclub as much as I come here. This location is super convenient for me. I started getting their doughnuts when they first opened. I have ventured out of my comfort zone and I can say their breakfast croissants and sandwiches are just as phenomenal. This location has 1 of the best Thai teas ever. Guess what bacon connoisseurs, this location now carries maple bacon glazed donuts. Eat your hearts out Merica!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Iced coffees too! Don't know if I'll try them for lunch, but watching them make the sandwiches I was intrigued."}
{"text":"I now have two favorite donut shops in Mesa and this is the place I stop when on the south side of 60.  Fresh, tasty with lots of choices and friendly staff."}
{"text":"I love bosa donuts customer service and there donuts are great! When there is a long line I always get in and out within a short amount of time!"}
{"text":"This Bosa always hits the mark with excellent customer service. I have only been here a hand full of times being donuts are just a reward I get my little one, here and again. The donuts are always fresh and served with a smile. I have been to other places were the staff rush you to make a selection so they came move on to the next customer but not this place."}
{"text":"I was attracted to the Cinnamon Crumb and Coconut Crumb donuts, but they were covered with the standard powdered sugar glaze and then rolled in their respective crumb toppings.  The only two options I had were the unappetizing cake donut and the buttermilk \"donut,\" which looked more like a deep-fried scone.  Both didn't look tasty at all, but I decided I'd try the buttermilk option.  Took one bite in the car and spat it out!  (I thankfully had an empty coffee cup to use.)  Good thing the \"donut\" only cost me 94 cents, including tax.  I could've invested that dollar on another cookie from Rise Up- drats!

Service was friendly and helpful, and the store was bright and clean inside.  

In a group and want to have a taste of something sweet?  Better to just share a dessert at Zappone's, which is across the road within the same shopping center.  The mascarpone cheesecake with blueberry topping is SUPERB!"}
{"text":"Not my favorite donuts but it's a convenient location (right next door to my gym) & I like that they put out coupons!  It's a bit of a dive. But they have a good selection & my kids are ecstatic when I come home from the gym baring donuts"}
{"text":"Donuts made fresh daily, convenient location. Only critique would be to offer a wider selection - mostly just a raspberry filled powdered one  everything else awesome!!"}
{"text":"I have always loved the food here especially their apple fritters and the jalepeno  cheese and ham crossaint! However I don't like to go there much anymore because the older lady (I believe the owner or manager) is always so unfriendly and she is not very nice with her staff. I feel bad for her employees! Treat your employees right and customers will flock to your store! This is why I gave it a 3 and not 5 stars. Customer service is a big deal!"}
{"text":"This place has the okay doughnuts, decent sandwiches. Although, ever single time I come in I always see the Chinese manager telling these poor girls what to do and where to go while she just sits around and talk to other employees and makes phone calls while myself and other customers are always waiting.I will never eat here again! This is the 3rd one I have seen at this location. These are not your average sewer roaches these are small food eating roaches.

{"text":"This place is outstanding. Fresh donuts are heavenly. Good selection plus sandwiches and an abundant drink selection.
We hit this place 3 times a week after the gym, lol. Pretty much the only reason I go to the gym is to indulge at Bosa afterwards."}
{"text":"I usually go to the bosa in Mesa because it's close to home, but tonight I went in today with my girls after a workout from the gym and as a \"little\" treat, we went and were greeted by this young lady who was very attentive and made us very happy! We got our items and stayed until she almost closed (because it seemed that she was alone). I don't know if all locations are different but for sure the quality of the donuts and the customer service knocks out all other bosa's I've been to for sure.I will definitely be going to this location more often!"}
{"text":"I'm sorry but if your charging me .25 for a box when I'm buying a bunch of donuts your just CHEAP.. period... this IS a review of this business and the customer service I have gotten here. The staff was rude, the donuts were not fresh. I also feel it is u professional for the staff to complain about a review just because they don't like it. Honesty is the best policy."}
{"text":"When time is an issue on Sunday mornings, nice traditional breakfast eateries are generally not the best choice. Though we might want to try them, it's just not in the cards most days, as it was this past Sunday for me. So naturally one will go to Plan B, C and D, if need be. I think this donut shop was Plan C for me, and it did the trick.

In reality, I was not expecting breakfast sammies, just donuts, so I was a bit surprised to see them on the menu. So I ordered a croissant with ham & sausage. However, somewhere in the translation they must have assumed I did not want egg on it, I know, crazy huh? So there was that, plus it was just microwave stuff to begin with, so nothing to get excited over or go out of your way for. 

However, their donuts? Top notch! I had some odd nut riddled monster with a we bit of apple filling in it. It kind of reminded me of an apple fritter, but not. It was good! Real good! So enjoy their donuts, but save your expectations in regards to their breakfast sandwiches."}
{"text":"Typical of other Bosa Dounuts, this store is conveniently located in a strip mall near me. I stopped in for dounuts on my way to work. They had a nice variety at a reasonable price. I was in and out in 5 minutes. This is now my go to dounut shop."}
{"text":"I rarely eat donuts but bosa donuts never disappoints.  Always fresh and baked the right way."}
