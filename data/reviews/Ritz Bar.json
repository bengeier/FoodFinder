{"text":"The wait staff and atmosphere were great they get 5/5. The drinks taste amazing as well but everything is really overpriced for what you get even for Toronto bringing the rating down to 3 if you could get half stars if give it overall 3.5/5."}
{"text":"Really great service. Our waitress was amazing. I wish there was live music (I went on a Wednesday) but the service made up for it. I'll be back and would love to check out Deq once the weather gets warmer :)"}
{"text":"I love coming to the Ritz bar. John is one of the most welcoming and friendly bartenders in the city. Really, even if everything else about the place was bad, he's a reason to come, but the great news is... The food, atmosphere and people here are great! 

Check it out! :)"}
{"text":"I've been here a few time s(bar only) and can't believe I haven't written a review.  When you want something fancy then you come here.  The service is fabulous and more importantly the drinks are unique and delicious.  My friend had some drink that had these frozen blackberry pieces (we called them pieces but apparently they are called caviar by the server..lol).  It was light and refreshing and just plain good.  This time we didn't order any bar food/snacks but I have had food here before and I don't remember any complaints about it.    

It's a small space but for some reason late on a Friday night we were the only ones here.  Fine by us :)"}
{"text":"$13.56 for a pint of Stella to sit in an average looking lounge
that really doesn't stand out or differentiate itself from other similar establishments? 
Yes the service is good here and its a clean modern lounge, but there are a lot of great lounges in Toronto, including many more with outstanding views. 
Don't get me wrong, I don't mind paying a premium for drinks, but only when its justified. This is not the CN Tower, Rogers Centre, or Lavelle, its a hotel bar on a street level. Its not furnished with exquisite art or furnishings.
Sorry, this is lounge is way over-priced for what you get in return."}
{"text":"We were there for a quick cocktail.  They used dry ice to chill my martini glass which is very smart.  The cocktail was great ! The used real leechi for my martini. The decor was very nice and modern. And the other drink cosmopolitan we order was great as well.  I love how the use big ice cube for drinks."}
{"text":"Classy, ambient & chic!

I came here for a coffee meeting one morning and it is now my favourite coffee meeting spot!  

I believe they also refer to this spot as the Pilot cafe, due to the fact that they serve pilot coffee here. Contrary to my coffee meeting, I ordered tea. At first I though the server comes to your table, however you go up to the bar to order your beverage and pay there. Their tea brand is Sloane, which I am unfamiliar with but it was quite decadent. There are different types of coffees and pastries as well. One cappuccino and one tea ran about $10 (so not cheap, but you are at the Ritz after all!) 

The atmosphere is classy yet relaxing in the morning. There is a small patio to the side where you can enjoy the sunshine as well. The server was friendly but fairly quiet.  In the evenings it turns into a bar (the Ritz Bar) and I'm sure is more lively, although I have yet to drop by in the evenings!

I have no complaints here - just love for this newfound spot!"}
