{"text":"Best Middle Eastern food I've ever had outside of the Middle East.  Amazing fresh ingredients, everything is made from scratch, and wonderful fast and friendly service.   The first time I visited the place, I was greeted by one of the friendlies people. The man behind the counter was very friendly and chatty and gave me a piece of falafel to try out while I waited for mine to be cooked. I was very pleased - it was delicious. Crunchier and less greasy than any falafel I'd ever tried before, and much more flavorsome. To make conversation I mentioned how nice the baklava looked, and owner only went and gave me some to take with me as a little present!  Because the food was so good, I ordered Shish Kefta, Grilled Chicken, and Kibbee to go  The Shish Kefta was so good and melt-in-your-mouth tender, The Grilled Chicken was very juicy and full of flavor   and the Kibbee was crunchy and very tasty.   I would definitely go back there if I am around Cleveland."}
{"text":"Wish the menu was a bit more descriptive - I'm not familiar with what everything is so pictures and ingredients are helpful. Some of pictures on facebook tell what it is some dont. Loved the grilled veggie dinner - added a shishkabob to it and it was awesome! Very good hummus as well."}
{"text":"We were at the Cleveland clinic and just took a chance to come here for lunch and it was great! The guy who was working was really nice. We got the lamb and the chicken pita sandwiches and they were really good! And I mentioned that I had never tried falafel and he gave me and my mom a sample for free without me even asking or anything! So nice. I don't live in Cleveland but if I'm around there again I would go back!"}
{"text":"Not open on the time stated on yelp. I came here at 11:25 and they still were not open. Yelp should change the time so more people would know about the timing. The food was amazing tho... Great service very nice owner"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! This is my first time here and I haven't even left the store and I HAVE to write this review!   The owner is great and personable. When he found out it was my first time he loaded me up on samples of falafel, chicken, lentil soup, and hummus. It was all great!   You get good sized portions for a really low cost and you just can't beat the service. I definitely recommend this place if you're looking for authentic Lebanese food. I'd choose this place over Aladdin's or sittoo's."}
{"text":"Visited this place while I was at Fairview hospital. Food was really good. We tried the veggie sampler and mixed platter. Portions were large and the samplers provided a nice variety. I will definitely visit this place again when I am in the area."}
{"text":"When I can't get to my mothers house for dinner cafe falafel is the only other place I'll go!! Shish kebab seasoned perfectly grilled to perfection  and the chicken for the shistawook is mouthwatering!! Five stars!!!"}
{"text":"The mixed platter was really good.best food ive had in  westpark.sorry gyro world.the hummus was fresh and   tasty and the grilled meats were moist and tender ."}
{"text":"Best Lebanese in Cleveland  From the fresh hummus to the lamb kabob & shawarma plate. You cannot go wrong with ordering anything on the menu! I've never been disappointed, I've always been left craving more :-) they have great vegetarian options too!"}
{"text":"Excellent all around.  Fresh, healthy and tasty food; good price.   Owner friendly and attentive.  Well worth a little bit of difficulty in parking . . ."}
{"text":"Their fallafel is BOMB! So good. Everything made to order, the flavors are delicious. Came here with my siblings and my g/f. Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"I can only second what others have said before: really really great baba ghanoush and hummus. Flavorful olive oil. My wife is a fan of their falafel sandwich too. We usually order both, this way you have a leftover snack for later as well, in theory."}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh, made from scratch food bursting with complex flavors. I had the mixed grill platter and, while each selection was good, the kefta was my personal favorite. The hummus is just amazing, so smooth and flavorful. I live close by in Kamms, and am delighted to have this authentic little gem in my neighborhood. The service was very friendly as well. Parking is a bit confusing at first, pull into the driveway to the right of the storefront, and parking is on the side toward the back."}
{"text":"I had never had Middle Eastern food before and now I cannot get enough! Cafe Falafel has amazing food!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, amazing owner who treats you as a personal guest! Prices are very affordable as well.  Would definitely go again!"}
{"text":"Dude, this place is delicious. I'm so glad it's so close to my house. I never liked baba ghanouj and falafel ... But now I'll eat until I explode!! The service is amazing and food is super fresh! Love this place!"}
{"text":"It is a small, simple place with great food. The service and staff is very friendly. The place is very clean and everything is made fresh in front of you.  I find their BBQ as one of the best in town. With great food prices its highly recommended."}
{"text":"Just went for dinner this week and was impressed by the quality of food that is served from behind this non-descript little counter. The hummus is AHHH-mazing, and even the pita bread tastes better! I also enjoyed the Shish Tawook - messy to eat but very tasty and fresh. The wrap it came in reminded me more of a crepe than a pita. I took my hubby the Shish Kefta entree to go and he loved every bite. This will definitely go into the Westpark dinner rotation. If you like Aladdins, this is better."}
{"text":"My son came home from college for the holidays. He just finished up a required religious studies class. One one day we had some free time, so I asked him if he wanted to go grab lunch at a place that would be a 'religious experience '. He scoffed ... Until he tried the lamb steak. An avowed carnivore, he is now trying to figure out how to purchase the vacant building across the street so he can eat here everyday. It's that good. The owner is wonderful, chatting with us while we waited for the food. AND he tossed my son several free samples while we ate. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I hidden gem just east of Hopkins Airport  The place has only two tables and we were lucky to get one  I had the chicken shawarma wrap and it was awesome   Lunch for three was under 20 dollars   Since it was our first time there, the owner gave us a complimentary assortment of Middle Eastern fare"}
{"text":"I give this place 5 stars based on the food quality relative to price. It is a very simple spot in terms of ambiance, seating area. So is Crust, and that's for pricier pizza in Tremont. The place is still relatively new and the owner is adjusting for demand. The food itself is fantastic, and other than the wings at Panini's, the only food I enjoy in West Park. The food is both authentic and hits all the marks for quality. I'd say the quality is very comparable to Taza in downtown but at $, not $$. What I'm most excited about? It's only 0.5 mi. away"}
{"text":"By far the BEST Falafel place in Cleveland.  I am so glad I tried this place. It's located right by Fairview Hospital easily visible. There's parking in the back of the building.   My hubby and I stopped by this week for lunch. As others have mentioned the place is small. They did reconfigure their 2 tables that I saw in some pictures. They are now by the window. They have chairs along the counter where there is room to eat if you should dine in. I did not find it cramped at all. I would say cozy. We had to do takeout though because of our plans for the day otherwise we would've eaten there.  We are a huge fan of Middle Eastern food and have found in the past that Sittoo's both in Parma and North Olmsted were better than Aladdin's and La Kabob in Strongsville. Cafe Falafel blows all of these places out of the water. The food is that good. The service is great also.  I tried their Vegetarian Sampler ($9.99) and my hubby got the Chicken Shawarma Pita Wrap for $5.99. I can't even begin to explain how good their hummus is. It sounds like a simple thing to make and I have made it at home many times but this hummus is heavenly. Like someone else mentioned it is so creamy, with perfect consistency. Their falafels are the best I've ever had. So moist and flavorful. The baba ghanouj was equally delicious. I could literally eat this every day. My hubby's Wrap was also fantastic. The chicken was perfectly marinated and very flavorful as well.   This will definitely be our go to place to get our Middle Eastern fix. Thank-You Yelpers for being spot on."}
{"text":"Wow...what a great find!  Who would have thought that the quality of Middle Eastern food coming out of this hole-in-the-wall spot would be so good?  Took a group of co-workers here for a lunch excursion.  Even though this is really a take-out restaurant, they had just enough window seats (six to be exact!) to accommodate our group, so we settled in.  My co-worker and I decided to order two unique dishes are share (more things to try that way!), so we got the mixed grill platter and a vegetarian sampler.  The mixed platter came with 1 Shish Tawook (chicken), 1 Shish Kabob (beef) and 1 Shish Kefta (ground lamb) along with hummus, pita and a tangy cucumber and tomato salad.  The vegetarian sampler came with hummus, baba ghanouj, falafel and a middle Eastern salad served with bread.  I cannot tell you how good each and every part of these dishes was...full of flavor, cooked (on the grill) to perfection with great dipping sauces.  We will most definitely be back, hopefully often!"}
{"text":"Here's the down low:   -Place is hard to find. No eye catching signage on the building  - Customer service is mediocre to low: the lady who cooked my food was eating in front of me, wait time for the grilled chicken entree was over 20 minutes.   -Grilled chicken: good flavor and grilled well  -Hummus: mediocre, nothing special  -Rice: delicious flavors"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, delicious vegetarian options and great prices. Hands down the best falafel and baba ghanouj in the area!"}
{"text":"Let me begin by saying the food was absolutely phenomenal! The only reason I'm not goving five stars is because I had expected to have my food plated, which was instead boxed. It was boxed very nicely, but I would have preferred plates.  On with the review:  My girlfriend and I saw the place on yelp, saw the great reviews, and decided to give it a shot. It definitely lives up to the high ratings.  She and I split the entree sampler, which consisted of a seasoned chicken skewer, a seasoned beef skewer, a ground lamb patty, rice with vermicelli, hummus, and tabouli(salad).  Dear lord! Everything was seasoned to perfection, freshly grilled, freshly made, etc.!   The hummus was even topped with little chunks of garbanzo beans.   The chicken was incredibly juicy, and equally as tender. My plastic knife slipped right through it like melted butter! The beef, just as well, and despite not being a fan of lamb, I really enjoyed the ground lamb patty. My girlfriend claims the lamb was amazing, and it was her favorite of the meats.  The rice and vermicelli sopped up all of those juices and fresh grilled taste.  The tabouli was topped with yogurt and wasn't overly onioned. Tasty!  As an appetizer we ordered babaganouj, which was possibly the best I've ever had. It was, like everything else, obviously freshly prepared. It was smoky creamy, riddled with seeds and eggplant skin, topped with olive oil and paprika, and quite honestly everything I could have hoped for! The housemade pita only added to the delight.  Maybe I am wrong to hold the lack of plating against them. This is about the food isn't it? Oh well. The images provided by other yelpers show how beautiful the food looks when plated. Again, had it been plated, it would have been a fiver. I wish I could have given 4.5."}
{"text":"So they have a phone number. I spent about 10 minutes reviewing the menu. Looks good. Quite hungry now. Been calling for about 30 minutes off and on. 8:00 on a Friday night and they don't answer the phone. Wish I could review the food but I'm beginning to wonder if they've somehow vanished.   ***Update 12/17/13:  Owner contacted me and advised me that they are in fact only open until 8pm for winter hours right now. I think the problem is that they are not updating Yelp.  So right now, Yelp indicates they are open (actually until 10pm) even though it's 8:05pm and they are closed. If you're going to use a valuable tool like Yelp, it would be a good idea to keep up with it if there is a change to your hours. Also, instead of a phone that rings and rings about 10 times and then just \"beeps\", it might be a good idea to have a voicemail with a greeting to inform clients that you are in fact closed and what your winter hours are.  Because, again, right now Yelp is saying you are open until 10pm tonight.  Some people are relying on this interface to get to your business."}
{"text":"Excellent food. We ordered the Fattoush salad, kofta kebab, falafel and hummus. If you like garlic, get the garlic sauce to go with your meal. Its straight garlic, so its strong and you won't have any friends for a week afterward, but WORTH EVERY BITE.   Service is fast and friendly too. FYI- They do mostly takeout because the dining room only had two small tables."}
{"text":"Ok so it took me forever to find this place. My GPS took me to a dead end. I actually just went to the hospital and circled until I found it. This place is great, I subtracted one star Bc I think the menu is small. No desserts when I was there. Probably Bc the place is small, two tables and some bar chairs. There is limited parking, straight back, it's to the right if you're in front of the place.  I got the Kefta plate: So good. Crazy authentic. I've forgotten how it's supposed to taste after going to more Americanized places for so long. The meat was seasoned and cooked perfectly. The rice/salad/hummus was great. That garlic sauce is like...the best. I like to do this: spread garlic sauce on pita, then put the kefta in some hummus then dip in some rice and lay it in pita. You know it's good when you wake up the next morning and still have garlic taste in your mouth. Like a Lebanese hangover :)"}
{"text":"This restaurant was awesome! I have been to many middle-eastern restaurant. By far, Cafe Falafel has been the best experience. Everything is fresh, cooked to orders. The hummus and baba ganoush were delicious. And for the cherry on top, the service was one of a kind. My next visit to Cleveland will require a stop at Cafe Falafel!"}
{"text":"I've wanted to try this place for a while now, today I finally did. I'm not a fan of the parking area; it's a bit cramped but I don't hold this against the restaurant itself. There was a lone chef working the counter, he was really nice and friendly. They have a small menu on the counter describing what is included with whatever you choose from the menu on the wall. They also have a sign on the counter; I won't say what it says but it really tells you something about the type of people they are. It's really a nice thing to see.   Ok, so the food. I ordered the veggie sampler and tabouli.  The veggie sampler was delicious; I've only had falafel one other time(from falafel express and it was absolutely disgusting)... This was not the case here. These falafel were soooo good. Everything else was just as tasty. There is more than enough for 2+ people. A little pricey in my opinion, but it is a lot of food and it's really good. I'm not a fan of tabouli; but the person I ordered it for said it was delicious too.   I think this may be my new favorite spot to frequent.  Go here! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"My lunch partner and I both had the mixed platter and they were FANTASTIC. I can't recommend this little hole in the wall highly enough. I recommend mixing the garlic sauce in with the hummus for added flavor with the fresh pitas. The shish tawook was especially flavorful and tender. A big thumbs up."}
{"text":"I ordered the Lamb Shish Kefta plate and WOW. It was absolutely wonderful. The portions were great and the food was fresh and so flavourful. The falafels are the best I have ever had. Crispy on the outside and vibrant green in the middle. No flavour was lost! Very impressed. And I love the garlic sauce too! Will definitely be coming back. My only suggestion would be to offer lunch size portions of their entrees or specials."}
{"text":"The chicken kebob was outstanding.  The blend of herbs and spices was sophisticated and delicious.  The falafel was wonderfully spiced and full of fresh herbs.   I have many allergies to food additives but didn't have to worry.  All his food is freshly prepared and chemical free.  My husband had lamb and loved it.  He is a butcher and knows his lamb.  We couldn't have been happier with our dinner or the price."}
{"text":"This place is killer! Great addition to the neighborhood.   Very friendly and above all... Delicious!  I would eat my shoe if it was dipped in his roasted jalapeño hot sauce.  The lamb steak was incredible! This isn't fancy photo shoot lamb steak...this was the one served to me.  Yeah...it's art!"}
{"text":"A word of advice, come here for the food and take it home. This is not a place where you'd want to eat in, trust me. It's tiny, there are only two tables crammed against the wall and there was no A/C, at least while we were there. Did I mention it was uncomfortably small? Calling this place intimate would be like calling a closet with two tables in it cozy. But, hell, if that's what you're into, they've got two tables with your name on them. During our visit there was also a loud industrial fan sitting in the window box up front and the door was open to the street. Not exactly pleasant. The drinks are in a cooler up front, and the stick-on desert mural on the wall adds a nice touch. It really felt like we were there. Anyway, our visit started off on quite an interesting note.  We walked in, 6pm-ish, Saturday. There was a guy sitting at the picnic table outside waiting for his order. Another customer, a good sign. Upon entering I noticed two people, a younger guy behind the counter, silent, working the grill diligently, and another, older gentleman, chef's coat, a manager's look on his face. We weren't greeted immediately so it was a tad awkward. They just kind of looked up at us and then went back to their work. We took a couple of menus and sat at one of the tables to finalize our selections. Speaking of the tables, they're made out of the cross section of a large tree, bark and all. Very rustic indeed. You can count the rings while you wait.  We approached the counter to order. Our plan was to eat there but it was not to be. We sat at a table and waited as our food was made to order. It took about 30 minutes. It was a bit longer than I expected but we did order a lot of food. There was another guy, clearly a friend of the manager, who sat at the other table. They spoke in loud Arabic bursts back and forth while he ate and sipped a Pepsi through a straw and occasionally wandered behind the counter. As for the eating in thing, they boxed up all of our food and sat it on the counter. The manager type guy then asked us if we were eating there or taking it to go. What? You've already boxed it all up and you're asking us if we're eating in? Strange. Yeah, we took it to go. Probably for the best. Between the fan, the kitchen and the street noise I couldn't hear myself think.  Now for the reason behind the 4-star review (3.5 really, but who's counting) and the real saving grace for a place like Cafe Falafel, the food. Our order:  Falafel: Some of the best I've had in the city. Not the usual round shape I've become accustomed to, but little crunchy mini loaves of fried chickpea goodness seasoned perfectly.  Chicken Shawarma: Essentially a grilled chicken wrap sandwich. The wife really liked it. The wrap itself was fresh and the pickled turnips added a wonderful punch of acidity that married well with the juicy chicken.   Mixed Grill: I wanted some meat and I got it. A Shish sampler. it comes with one each of the beef, chicken and ground meat varieties along with rice and a salad. I was not disappointed. My favorite, the Shish Kefta. While not in the most appetizing of shapes (I couldn't help but giggle when I saw it), it reminded me of a small meatloaf. It was full of fresh herbs and spices and very lean. The grilled chicken was tender and moist. The kebab, probably my least favorite of the trio, was a tad chewy. The salad, actually more like a salsa with diced onions, cucumbers, tomatoes and herbs, was good, just not my thing and the rice was tasty.  Hummus: This had to be some of the smoothest, most flavorful hummus I've ever had. Seriously, there wasn't a chickpea chunk to be seen. Clearly made fresh it was drizzled with olive oil and topped with a garnish of whole chick peas. It came with a handful of pita slices.  OK, so the place wasn't exactly boiling over with hospitality and the atmosphere is more food truck than bistro, but the food was spot on. I've pretty much stuck to Aladdin's when it comes to Middle Eastern food here in the Cleveland area. Mostly because I'm a creature of habit. This is the real deal not some uppity suburban facsimile staffed by a myriad of petite blonde hipsters in tight jeans.  On this day, that habit may have been broken. Is it a mind-blowing, cultural experience? Hardly. Is it worth the drive from across town? Maybe. I'd like to say I'll definitely be back, but the next time I have a hankerin' for some ethnic I'll probably just hit up somewhere closer to home. I'm lazy that way."}
{"text":"I went for first time and got chicken Schwarama wrap... Flavors on chicken, sauce and veggies were really good but the wrap it was in instantly fell apart when I picked it up. Not sure if it's always like that but it was impossible to eat and I ended up eating it with a fork like a salad.   Baklava was really good, also liked they had a sign that said we will feed you for free if you have no money."}
{"text":"I just finished eating my carry out meal and already can't wait to come back again. I ordered carry out for 4 people tonight. We tried kebab sandwiches, the kofta entree and the veggie sampler which included falafel, hummus and baba, and a tomato cucumber salad.    Everything was very flavorful, huge portions, and the guys making the food were super nice. Prices are very very reasonable too!   There's only two tables to sit inside, and a few picnic tables for outdoor seating. Carry out might be the best way to go for that reason."}
{"text":"This was my first visit. They have the best falafel I've ever had. The chicken shawarma was great too! I will definitely be back as well as recommend."}
{"text":"Cafe Falafel has some of the best Middle Eastern food I have tried! I've stopped in twice now and would definitely go back again to get the Mixed Platter $14.99 and the Vegetarian Sampler $9.99. This place is located right by Fairview Hospital and in the evening the lot next to Cafe Falafel is open to the public so easy free parking! Inside is tiny but there are two tables crammed together and a couple stools if you want to eat in (no public restroom), but mostly it seems people get their items to-go with the typical 15-20 minute wait. Staff has been friendly and they seem to interact well with each other.   -Mixed Platter: You get a mound of rice, 1 Tawook (chicken skewer), 1 Kabob (beef tenderloin skewer), 1 Kefta (ground beef with herbs & spices skewer), hummus, and salad (diced tomato, cucumber, onion, & herb mixture), soft pita bread, and a side of tahini (garlic sauce).  -Vegetarian Sampler: A combination of hummus, baba ghanouj (eggplant dip), 4 falafel, salad (diced tomato, cucumber, onion, & herb mixture), and soft pita bread.   The food is really tasty with the best falafel's I have had, plus great proportions! So why not five stars? Well there seems to be inconsistency with the cooking. First visit the owner cooked the meat to perfection, second visit another gentleman over cooked my chicken, under cooked the ground beef and forgot to give me the side of tahini. But like I said, I'm still going to go back and I would definitely recommend this place, just maybe tell them how you want the meat cooked and check your order before you leave."}
{"text":"Seriously this place is a hidden gem. The place is clean the food was so good the chef is so polite and his food is just so great. If you ever near kams corner i suggest you stop by for a very filling very good meal"}
{"text":"Just a little take out place with good food.  Tried the Falafel Burger, which was nice and tasty, but really messy.   The place has no menus, just a chalk board, no french fries and will not give you a cup of water.    While people rant about the falafel,  I thought it was good, but not the best in town.  I would choose Nate's Deli by the West Side Market as better."}
{"text":"The food was ok, I really did like their hummus and their rice.. the meat was to hard but in general they have a clean place and good service.. i will try something else to see how it goes."}
{"text":"I signed up for yelp just to review this place. So good, so so good. Many things are on the menu, and I've tried most of it by now. all great--but the standout truly is the falafel. His hummus and babgnoush (however it's spelled) is also quite good. The owner is also super friendly and clearly cares that the customers leave satisfied. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Tiny store front with amazingly friendly staff.  Fatoush salad to die for, tawook was super moist, and baklava was that make your teeth hurt heavenly sweet.  Parking was a little oddball, but worth it."}
{"text":"Compared to all the other Middle Eastern eateries I've dined in, this is definitely one of my favorites. It's a fairly small restaurant right by the hospital. Inside there's a few chairs and tables if you want to eat your food in the restaurant, but be warned no public restrooms! (Guess if you really have to go and it's an \"emergency\" the hospital is right there ;p)   My favorite entree is the mixed grill, which comes with 3 different types of marinated cooked meat on a bed of rice. Of the 3 meat options the seekh kabob is my favorite, very well flavored with bits of ginger. Depending on who makes the meat, I prefer having more ginger in the kabob. A salad and hummus also come along with the meal, with a stack of pita. Their hummus is quite good and always fresh whenever I've had it. I could probably just order a side of their hummus with pita and be happy eating that as my meal.   Service is always great; the people working there are quite friendly and polite. The menu is simple and the food is great, what more can you ask for? Definitely give this place a try if you haven't already! There's even a parking lot in the back, so you don't have to search for street parking! Thank goodness!"}
{"text":"Small place with some great food. We ordered a pita sandwich, vegetarian sampler, extra falafels, 2 pieces of dessert, and 3 side sauces for under $25. Everything looked and tasted fresh and very good. They formed the falafels and fried them fresh for us, they were the best we have had. The sauces all appear home made too, beware of the hot sauce though if you aren't serious about your heat."}
{"text":"Very hard to beat on a price/value level. Had a relative in Fairview Hospital for a few days and ended up eating here twice. I tried a bit of most of their offerings thanks to their platter offerings and it was all good and inexpensive. Delicious vegetarian food across the board, and I had a taste of the lamb steak as well, which was a wonderfully marinated slice of shoulder with a good amount of fat. They make their falafel to order with a great batter, but still manage to get your food out fast. It's a great little hole in the wall."}
{"text":"Just got take out, after reading in Scene Magazine, that this place had Cleveland's best falafel.  They were not exaggerating!  We got the Falafel Burger, Veggie Sampler and Tabouli.  The burgers had a perfectly fried soft egg on them.  It was one of the best things I have eaten!  Their Hummus is amazing!  Silky soft and so flavorful!!!  We will for sure go back.  Very nice couple were cooking.  They seemed very interested in their customers.  That is nice to see!  This will be one of our fav places!"}
{"text":"Some of the best middle eastern food in Cleveland. Great sandwiches, delicious hummus. Don't miss the kefta."}
{"text":"I'm Middle Eastern and my mom cooks Arabic food on a regular basis, and cafe falafel is almost as good as my moms cooking. Everything is always fresh! Kefta platter is my favorite. Quality of the beef is just amazing. I eat here once a week!   Great guy too who is from the Gaza Strip. Really knows how to cook. Only thing that's a hassle is his parking! Wish he had a more convenient location but still not a huge deal."}
{"text":"driving cross country with an overnite in Cleveland. cafe falafel sounded good. put the address into waze and found the place.  and it was closed at 7 pm even though the website said it closes at 8.  no bueno."}
{"text":"This place makes phenomenal food.   My boyfriend has far more experience in Middle Eastern food than me. He selected this restaurant, as it's reknown for being the best in Cleveland.  I agree.   We had a very friendly staff member wait on us and someone equally as friendly prepared our food.  I really wish we lived closer. 3 hours closer."}
{"text":"Melissa and I wanted something quick for dinner on Wednesday night and I've been really wanting to try Café Falafel since we moved to Westpark. I've read good reviews online and one of Mel's favorite foods are falafel sandwiches, so we gave it a go.   We arrived at around 715 and there were no other customers in the restaurant, which isn't surprising as there are only 2 tables in the whole place. The tables inside were these really unique \"tree trunk\" tables which I thought was a cool look for the rather plainly decorated but very impressively clean shop. A bigger guy with tattoos took our order (not a very friendly guy but not unfriendly either) and also made our orders.   Melissa went with her normal falafel pita sandwich and I went with the chicken shawarma pita sandwich. The cashier/chef took some chicken that was marinating in the front cabinet and proceeded to make my wrap and also Mel's sandwich. The total time was about 10 minutes to make and we took our order to go. The cashier/chef was friendly after we left (it was about a half hour to closing time when we left, so I can understand being not in the most friendly mood when we arrived).   We got home and devoured. To be honest, it was just ok. The chicken had good flavor but I definitely would have preferred more meat and more garlic sauce. They used a wheat wrap for both the of the sandwiches but I was hoping it would of came in a pita (I don't know if it's customary for a wheat wrap or not; a pita would just be my preference). The toppings were fine but I just wish there were more of them in the wrap itself (it was mainly lettuce). Overall the taste was fine in each but we were both still hungry after eating both of our wraps. I'd probably take 2 sandwiches to fill me up if I were to go back and I'm not a big guy by any means.   I understand that most of the good reviews on here were for the actual dinner plates and I'm only reviewing based on the wraps we ate. They weren't bad by any means but I've had much better (especially at the Westside Market). We may plan on coming back to get a traditional dinner sometime but probably not anytime soon."}
{"text":"This place deserves 10 stars. Hands down the best falafel I have ever had. The Shawarma, Kibbeh, Baba Ganoush were makes you wanna slap somebody good. Everything taste fresh and full of authentic flavor. As an out of towner, this will be a definite stop on my list every time I visit Cleveland. Two very enthusiastic thumbs up."}
{"text":"So disappointed they don't have beef shawarma anymore. It was the best I've ever had. What middle eastern place doesn't sell beef shawarma? Wondering if it's just the price of beef?  Guess I'll need to find another shawarma spot!"}
{"text":"Cafe Falafel is great. This is probably my new favorite middle eastern restaurant. The beef was tender as a filet. The lamb steak was delicious as well. The falafel was on par with Maha and the hummus was as good as Nate's Deli. It isn't watered down like Aladdin's. Cafe Falafel is a one-stop shop for all of the best Mediterranean foods in Cleveland. Dinner platters are around $10. They include meat, salad, rice and hummus. Cafe Falafel is an underrated and off the radar kind of place that deserves more attention."}
{"text":"Best middle eastern food in Cleveland. Friendly passionate owner. Hummos comes generously drizzled with a very fragrant and delicious olive oil.  Falafel has great flavor and a beautiful green color inside from the herbs - not dry and tasteless like so many others. Only a few minutes from Hopkins airport - East siders, if you've crossed the border going to or from Hopkins, definitely stop here!"}
{"text":"Best Shaworma and Shish Kabobs in town. Check it out you won't be sorry I promise. The hummus is great also. Ehab is a great cook and great personality. Awsome customer service. The food is to die for. I think best in town."}
{"text":"Wow. Shishtawook was better than I could have imagined and the Taboulli is on point. Nothing like Mrs. Chelala's, but none other compares to hers. Plus, taboulli is day to day, could be less fresh tomorrow, so dont read this and go on my experience if yours is not as tasty. Commenting on how the \"Yelps' Bruce Lee-Roy\" Steve L. Was wrong about taboulli, I dont wanna hear it.   I have had this place in my radar for quite some time now, im in no way disappointed, im actually thinking about what I will order next time..?   Could not have had a better 300th review!  update, I had this in my draft, it was to my 300, still an excellent place and review!"}
{"text":"Couldn't resist another visit after reading Bob L.'s review.  I'm tuned in to a very different experience, for sure, as the owner greets me with a hug.  I don't get the chain restaurant greeting and 'American service' which trolls the waters at surface level depth and which Bob speaks to while missing out on how our expectations, critical nature and cultural lens gets in the way of forming relationship and seeing where someone else is coming from and enjoying the cultural journey.  The 'rustic' tables Bob refers to strike me as similar to the rough hewn lumber I've seen in Palestine.  There is a sense of history present in that part of the world which is also what the owner sees in the rings on the tables.  The western eye and cultural sense of rustic, wagon wheels, or whatever is a world apart.  If you show up and also show respect and invest in the cultural experience before you, you have the opportunity to be richly rewarded along a simple lesson in life--- take an interest in others---  and an alternate universe away from 'American service' which trolls the waters at surface level depth.  Meals arrive in styrofoam boxes as the place is licensed for take out.  You may be asked if you are taking your order out or eating there as taxes are not charged for take out but the laws require taxes be collected for meals consumed on premise.    ...  Along my own journey and getting to know, 'Ron tea' shows up on my plate.  Ron was part of the construction effort, and the owner took an interest to hire Ron for his restaurant.  I enjoy hearing this part of the story.  The owner normally puts sage in his tea.  A worker from Syria usually puts Cardamom.  Ron weighs in and adds cinamon to both and the result is a wonderful full and rich tea.  You won't find 'Ron tea' on the menu as it arrives on my plate as a gift.  I'm catching why folks in other cultures sip tea and linger after a meal and for whatever local variant of tea is on their plate, and I catch myself lingering, as well.  I'm enjoying the juicy kafta, and the owner pulls me aside to show me the grill.  See this, he explains, as he points out a raised bar on front and back of the grill which keeps the meat off the grill and also keeps the meat from drying out.  He explains this is what makes the meat juicy and adds a high end Turkish restaurant in town, Anatolia's, does the same--- if you want to spend $25 for the same plate.  Other places don't use these kinds of grills, and this is why I'm getting a better plate of food and dining experience than what I may get elsewhere.  My tourist experience ends as I finish my tea as I settle into a healthy sense of being.  Am guessing we'll see more of Cafe Falafel as folks gather to see what they're missing elsewhere, and Ahab is the kind of guy most of us may wish to be successful."}
{"text":"Freshly prepared and tasty Middle Eastern food is what you will find here.  The salad was made right when I ordered with them chopping the romaine lettuce in front of me.  No prepackaged salads here!  The mixed platter (1 Shish Tawook, 1 Shish Kabob & 1 Shish Kefta) was very high quality and tasty.   There are a couple of small tables near the front windows, but it appears to be mostly take out business.  We grabbed a meal while visiting at Fairview Hospital."}
{"text":"I order a the mixed platter and i liked the lamb shish kabob and chicken the most! The salad wasn't so great but I liked the hummus a lot. I would come again"}
