{"text":"Went there tonight and man oh man is it good. I went with my brother, we're Hispanic, but this PR food and the flavors are on point. I recommend it. The owner is a good dude too. Try the pork, amazing."}
{"text":"I've been craving Puerto Rican food since I had visited a few years back. I was excited to hear about this place and finally gave it a try. We tried the Pechuga de Pollo a la Parillia with yellow rice and beans, Pollo Guisado, Pastelas, and Platanos Maduros. All of them were very delicious. I would like to say my craving for Puerto Rican food was satisfied but this delicious food only made me want it more!"}
{"text":"I started my meal with the tostones and a beef empanada.  They were by far my favorite part of the meal, especially the empanada.  The dough was nice and moist, a little flaky which I liked.  The filling was savory and perfectly seasoned. I highly recommend it.  For the main course I had the fried pork with mofongo.  The mofongo was good but a little lukewarm.  I'm not sure it was fresh.  The fried pork was greasy and very dry, it was definitely fried too long.  The meat was tough.  Overall the meal was good but too greasy and meat was disappointing."}
{"text":"I read about this place and it sounded like people really liked it. My wife and I were amazed at the great food, the unique atmosphere, and the owner Alberto. What can I say but the man is in love with what  he does. While you wait for you food (prepared right in front of you) his charm and friendliness pour through. I can't remember the last time I said that lunch was a memorable experience. You've got to try it to believe it. If you are from New York you will really appreciate the food because it takes you back. If you're not from New York you will still be amazed at what you were missing all your life. I would give 10 stars if I could."}
{"text":"First visit. Owner is very friendly and helpful. Felt really comfortable chatting as we were looking at the menu. Food was fabulous. Garlic shrimp,tender beef, rice and beans, flan. Couldn't ask for a better meal. Will be back soon. Definitely 5 stars!!"}
{"text":"I tried this place with a Groupon I purchased after being super excited to see an authentic Puerto Rican restaurant in the west valley.  We found the store-front in the same strip mall as the Peoria Cafe in downtown Peoria and were immediately greeted by the owner. Very friendly, helped us pick out a couple different items to try from the menu.  It's takeout only, so once we got home, we tore open the boxes and were in heaven.  The food tastes exactly like what we are used to on the east coast - amazing!!  We can't wait to go back and continue supporting this gem of a small business!"}
{"text":"Chinese food was closed so figures id try something new. Never had Puerto Rican food before. All I can say is tasty tasty tasty. I had the fried chicken with Mofongo which is a rich, garlicky banana side dish.  My taste buds have never experienced this type of flavor before. It was quite the experience which I highly recommend if you're looking for something new."}
{"text":"Would of gave 10 stars if the app allowed me too .  I've worked in the restaurant industry for years. Ate food from the some of the most prestigious places . My experience here was amazing. My wife is from the Bronx (Newyorican) me from Brooklyn (Jamaican ). And living out west for the last 2 years looking for that authentic Puerto Rican food . Customer service was personable, warm , the place of business is clean and the aroma's of the food was like you were in your PR abuela kitchen and the food is as good as any 5 star restaurant I've ever had."}
{"text":"I am a new snowbirder.I had to try a solid 5 with these reviews.It was even better than you could expect. Mofongo ,pulled pork and the pork chops are amazing.Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Felt like visiting New York in the middle of Peoria. Awesome food. The owner supports the local business culture and is as real as it gets. Will def be back for the mofongo and pulled pork and the cuban sandwich!"}
{"text":"Great food, truly authentic dishes. Wonderful service and very friendly. Wouldn't go anywhere else."}
{"text":"I am originally from NY and grew up eating Spanish food. I moved to AZ a little over a year ago. My boyfriend is actually the that found this restaurant on groupon. When we finally got around to go as soon as I walked in I was instantly back in NY! This food is ABSOLUTELY delicious! We had pernil, pasteles, sweet plantains, rice and beans and oh the empanadas!!! This are to die for!!! I couldn't be happier to have a little piece of NY in Peoria, AZ. Thank you thank you thank you!!!"}
{"text":"This is place was amazing!! Real Puerto Rican food! So much flavor everything was so delicious!  The owner was so awesome, he was out of yellow rice because it was very close to closing time and instead of telling no, he offered to made us a fresh batch of rice as long as we didn't mind the wait!! Great place to eat, great customer service we will definitely be regulars!!! I can't wait to bring in my mother in law, she is from Puerto Rico and will love that there is a place for here to get real home cooking with here having to make it!"}
{"text":"First time having Puerto Rican food. It's very good. The owner/operator of the restaurant is very helpful and inviting. Sampled a few items and ended up choosing the chicken stew. I would definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"There's a reason this place gets a lot of 5 star reviews...no, it's not the location, which is a little tricky to find. It's not the decor, 'cause it's carryout and catering only, so you walk into an industrial kitchen (which is a little intimidating at first).  It's all about the food and the man behind the counter.  First, the man. He's cool. He speaks quickly. And he clearly knows what he's about. He never stopped moving while we were there, back and forth between the fridges and the oven and the sink.  But it would be just pointless motion if he didn't create some great food.  My GF tried the empanadas (yummers), yellow rice and beans (also yummers).  I had just the Cuban sammich, with the usual pickles and mayo/mustard.  Outstanding !  Last Cuban sandwich I recall having was in Manhattan, and this was easily as good.  We'll be back, and often.  If you haven't been, you should go.  And go hungry, you won't be disappointed.  (Next time, the mofongo and pork !)"}
{"text":"I'm from CT and was introduced to Puerto Rican  cuisine by my brother-in-law and have been hooked ever since - so I was excited to find this restaurant in Peoria and via Restaurant,com no less!   We visited in late September.  It is a commercial catering kitchen that does take out.  The food especially the Pernil and Mofongo was authentic and sooo delicious!  The owner/chef was hospitable and charming and shared with us a taste of his homemade Coquito while we waited and also gave us a taste of the Pernil right out of the oven after 14 hours.   It was a wonderful meal, very rich so can't do it too often:).  Would be great if they had a place to eat in!  PS don't let the location In a mostly empty strip mall scare you!"}
{"text":"Serious Flavor comes to Peoria!  I am always trying to find authentic food and I was very pleased with my experience at El New Yorican. I had the Mofongo topped with shrimp. For those who may not know, Mofongo is smashed, then fried plantains with a little pork flavor. It came topped with shrimp and sizzling in a delicious broth of oil and garlic. One bite and you'll be hooked!  This was better than I'd had it in old San Juan!  Also try the empanada style beef. Very tasty!   El New Yorican is in the shopping center down from the Peoria Peforming Arts center. Look for the Puerto Rican flag hanging from the window."}
{"text":"Great food! Must try this place! The owner Is friendly and takes a lot of pride in his work!!! Definitely a favorite that my family talks about regularly:)"}
{"text":"Everything was delicious! I had pernil, arroz con gandules, mofongo con camarones al ajillo and quesitos.  Hands down the best mofongo I've ever had! Buttery, garlicky heaven. The pernil was very tender, moist and packed with flavor. Born and raised in caguas, PR! Definitely brought me back home.. Thank you"}
{"text":"I've been to Puerto Rico many times and love their food but couldn't find many Puerto Rican restaurants in Phoenix. Then I saw a groupon for this place. The owner/chef is such a nice guy. Plus you can sit there and watch him cook so you know exactly whats going in your food.  The mufongo was maybe even better than what is found in Puerto Rico. It was greasier but you know how much us Americans love grease.  The fried chicken was great. Much better than all of the fastfood fried chicken you find around town.  Empanadas AMAZING. I just which I had some Indian dip or Greek yogurt to dip it in.  Desert was so good. Tasted like a Cheescake wrapped in a pastry.  Just a tip... it is take out only. And don't be surprised when you open the door you walk straight into the kitchen.  Oh and you can't beat the price!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing but the workers are determined you can just see it in their eyes, this is what makes this hole in the wall 5 stars. I've never had anything like this in Arizona definitely worth the drive if you are on the fence."}
{"text":"Grand opening was 9-13-14. The food is on point, it reminds me of my mom's cooking. The food is fresh which I loved. You order what you want and he cooks it on the spot. Finally some diversity in this town! The owner Alberto is a really cool friendly down to earth person. If you want delicious fresh Boriqua food please try this place out. This place reminds me of home (NJ-NY)."}
{"text":"Food is great. Owner is friendly. What else could you ask for? Their alcapurrias (beef empanadas) are to die for! Hands down, the best I have ever tried. Their pernil has the perfect flavor and is very tender. The Mofongo and bistec encebollado were also delicious."}
{"text":"Delicious food! Mofongo is super flavorful and big!! Also the pernil is so good, alcapurrias and flan were perfect, definitely going back, Alberto the owner is very friendly and is a very clean place, great prices. Go ahead and try it !!! you are going to love it!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  Great food and great service. We got a variety of things and they were all awesome."}
{"text":"Love the food I can't enough. My favorite where the empanadas. If wanting more flavor out of your food definitely go to this place."}
{"text":"Been meaning to bring my parents to this place for a few months, finally made it out and Wow. My only regret was that I hadn't been here sooner. We walked in and were greeted by Alberto, someone who clearly takes pride in what he does and does so all the while keeping the customer engaged. While we waited for the main dishes he brought out the pastelitos/empanadas we ordered, I could have just eaten these, so good! After getting our main dishes we ended up staying about 20 minutes after just talking with Alberto as he shared stories and we complimented him on the food (this based only on the empanadas, of course there was more to come). When we finally got home and finally tried all the dishes I could not stop talking about how good the food was and immediately recommended this spot to friends.   Please do yourself a favor and check this place out! The food is amazing and the customer service is just the cherry on top."}
{"text":"Wow ! Excellent food - the plantains are amazing .. As is the pork and chicken. We will be back to try more!"}
{"text":"Best puertorican food outside of the island. Alberto is very welcoming and friendly. Feels like home. I will definitely be a regular."}
{"text":"This place is just okay. I've definitely had better puerto Rican food. I've been here twice. I ordered mofongo and carne frita the first time. The meat was pretty good. The mofongo was a big ball of grease, inedible. The second time I ordered the yellow rice and pernil. It was okay, nothing amazing. There was a lot of fat in the pork. I used Groupon both times. This place is wildly overpriced without the Groupon. I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"5 stars is not enough to give this place! The food here is DELICIOUS!! We have been here a couple of times and each time have been treated great and definitely have not been disappointed by the food! Its recommended to call in your order so you can just pick it up and take it home as there is no seating available but definitely worth it! We have had the empanadas (to die for) and the mofongo with carne frita, both are amazing!"}
{"text":"A coworker intruduced me to this place and he is my new best friend for it! The owner is super nice and the food is amazing. It is surprising when you visit the actual location because it is in a little strip mall hard to spot from the street and the inside is just all kitchen with no dining option.   I have been here twice and had the Mofongo and Carne both times and I don't know where to begin. The savory mashed plantains are made with garlic and butter and the fried pork is crispy on the outside but moist and flavorful on the inside. I was also undecided about the slow roasted pork dish vs. the fried pork so the owner gave me a sample, which was also delicious.   You will also be pleasantly surprised by the amount of food in each dish. Essentially both my husband and I can share one of the combo dishes and be full. Definitely give this place a try if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Best stop made on my drive to NY. Great food authentic just like home sweet home. Drove by last year too late to stop but made a diversion just to eat here best xtra 30 minutes spent. Great people, great attitude awesome food. Now my truck smells like Puerto Rican food and im starving. Those traveling a definite stop for food. Come hungry!!!  Locals your blessed with a taste of Puerto Rico & NY food. Enjoy."}
{"text":"The owner was very kind, food was excellent . We are Puerto Ricans and it is very hard to find a good place to eat.  Don't hesitate to go here it's awesome."}
{"text":"Best food I've eating in a long time. The mofongo was amazing.  The service was great and the owner made sure that we were taken care of."}
{"text":"Best Puerto Rican food in Arizona. Great service. Highly recommended. Owner is personable and friendly. My new favorite spot."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh!!  This food is amazing!!!  I've eaten Puerto Rican food my whole life and this place tops the charts.  Portion sizes are big enough for left overs that are just as good the next day.  Pastilillos are amazing!!!  Perni delicious and the Mofongo was super good too!  I bought 2 Groupon vouchers and will definitely be back soon to use the other.  The owner and his son are super nice and hospitable even gave us a sample of the Perni while we waited for our order.  A definite go to spot for me and my family.  You should absolutely try it if you want good food.  You will not be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! Very authentic and tasty cuisine. The owner/operator is friendly and engaging. It's a take out only shop, but worth the drive and the price. Enjoy."}
{"text":"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THIS PLACE! This is my first time having Puerto Rican food and I have to say it was amazing. I decided to go here with my mom because we were tired of having the same Mexican and Chinese foods in the area. We had the Mofongo Chicharrones De Pollo (mashed plantains mixed w/ garlic & butter topped with tasty, flavorful crispy fried chicken chunks) and the Pechuga De Pollo A La Parillia (boneless, juicy flavorful grilled chicken breast), this was served with tasty sauteed onions and rice. The food was so good that when we brought the leftovers home and heated them the next day, my aunt smelt the food and knew she had to go and check this place out herself. Since then we've been back there for two days buying plantains lol, its addicting. Overall the food was great, and the service is AMAZING. Alberto, the owner is a serious sweetheart. Super kind, friendly, and welcoming to all people. Definitely check this place out if you are looking for something GOOD, satisfying to your taste-buds, and really filling."}
{"text":"Randomly we looked up new places to eat and take a break from cooking. We can say we were very pleasantly surprised not only by the food but owners. The owner greater us with a smile and a sample of beef stew, rice, and beans. It was absolutely tasty. I have had real Puerto Rican food from an old boss and my brother n law/sissy. This is the real deal! If you want authentic Puerto Rican food cooked in front of you this is the place to visit. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Best Puerto Rican food in AZ. Place is literally a hidden gem. Can't wait to go back and eat again."}
{"text":"We had a great visit while waiting for a nice hot meal. We had a tough time making up our mind trying to decide all of the favorites we used to find easily in South Florida. We ended up picking up several dishes. The mofongo was fantastic, best we've had in Phoenix. The pernil was amazing, and we were dying for yuca frita con mojo which was superb. We highly recommend this place if you are having a tough time finding your favorite dishes in the valley.  They are also devoted to contributing clothing to charity so please bring any donations you may have lying around."}
{"text":"Had a taste for an authentic cuban sandwich, so after leaving Arrowhead Mall I whipped out my Yelp smartphone app and searched for the highest rated cuban/p.r. restaurant I can find. This gem popped up as the highest rated in the west valley. The name looked familiar but the location baffled me. After pulling up in the parking lot, I was skeptical because they windows were tinted and the parking lot empty.  When I walk in, I step into a very large, clean, and great smelling industrial kitchen. The owner looks up, and it's no other than my man Solo. He is one of the coolest, most down to earth restaurateurs I have ever met. I used to be a regular at his restaurant off of thomas and the i17 area. As usual, he greeted me and we caught up and talked about life and current events in only the great way that Solo can.   Being the fan of his family's recipe for Pernil, I knew that I could not go wrong with the Cuban sandwich. He had the right cheese, right roasted pork, perfect ham, the right break and the necessary pickle. Hands down the best cuban sandwich i've ever had. For the most flavorful puerto rican dishes in the Valley, make sure you check this play out. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Myself and my bandmates discovered this restaurant quite by accident. We are on tour in Arizona and wanted some catering delivered to the green room at one of our concerts. A friend-of-a-friend made the recommendation. Boy were we pleasantly surprised. The fried Plaintain's with garlic and oil dip, the fried chicken and especially the beans having the perfect blend of herbs and spices were all delicious. This is the restaurant we will keep in mind the next time we're in this area, and you should too. Peoria is fortunate to have this restaurant."}
{"text":"This is an amazing taste of authentic Puerto Rican cuisine. The Pastilillos are addicting and I'm terribly sad I only ordered two. We will be returning to say the least. The owner is extremely friendly, makes you feel like your having dinner with family."}
{"text":"Delicious food! Hospitable chef! I had an amazing steak sandwich and I completely loved it. Five stars!!!!!"}
{"text":"Thank you for the delicious food (roast pork, rice & pigeon peas) that was served at our art exhibit reception! I was happy to take some of the food home and eat it as a treat the following day. As a new resident in Arizona, and Caribbean American (Jamaican) from New York, the seasonings & preparation of the food was very tasty! I will visit for my take out soon!"}
{"text":"Food was great, flavor was definitely on point and you can tell it wasn't something that just anyone can make. Unfortunately this time around there wasn't some items we would have liked to try or be able to eat outside perhaps but still was fresh when we made it home and won't be my last visit and look forward to next time"}
{"text":"My daughter heard about this place a while ago and recommended by the Peoria police officers she was with during her ride along in her Senior year internship. I have looked for this restaurant and I honestly couldn't find it on my own. You need to look out for the big Puerto Rican flag in the window of the shopping plaza. Went there with my daughter so we could get dinner for tonight, not feeling well to cook and also so I don't have to think about what to do for dinner on Valentine's Day! Everyone knows that going out to eat on Valentine's Day is the worst day of the year! We ordered a lot of food! Ive been to Puerto Rico and know how much time is involved in cooking wonderful tasty food. So, I can personally tell you that the ..Tostones and the garlic dipping sauce.. Absolutely amazing! My daughter loved the empanadas ( btw we ordered 6) and so she could have some leftovers for the week:) The fried chicken was tasty! The pork & arroz con gandules and beans were great! The mofongo looks great...( as I didn't taste it) I have a delicious dinner ready for my Puerto Rican boyfriend and we will be on time for our concert Sunday night! This meal and candles for a romantic dinner! The person who greeted my daughter was very polite and even came out to my car to greet me! Honestly, this is a great restaurant! My daughter wished they were bigger and had tables to sit down and enjoy the meal. She said this would be a great meal for a date! I see this business expanding to more than catering and take out. I certainly would drive from Cavecreek to this restaurant again!  Updated 2/15/16 P.S. My boyfriend enjoyed the mofongo & rice :) he is ready to go back soon!!"}
{"text":"I am a repeat customer.  Today the owner was cooking, and it was on point as expected.  I got to watch a gentleman come in for the 1st time. Chef gave him a sample, the man was blown away. He was even ordering food for next week too. I had the beans for then first time, delicious is all I can say. I will be back to try the Flan, cannot wait."}
{"text":"What a great find! The owner, Alberto, provided the best customer service I've ever had. He helped us pick out our dishes and was so friendly - felt like we knew him forever. The food - delicious! Had an empanda and alcapirria to start. So good! For the main dish, we had mofongo carne frita and another pork dish with yellow rice. Incredible! The hospitality was outstanding, as equally as the food. Go there!"}
{"text":"Awesome food. Awesome owner. You've really got to check this place out. When you go inside you are literally in the kitchen and it is super clean. The owner is also the only cook because he feels he hasn't found another cook that will meet his standards, which are obviously very high."}
{"text":"My friend and I were looking for a new place to eat with my children, and when this came up, I was intrigued.  I didn't pay attention to the ratings it had because a lot of the time they lie (though it is really rare for a place to have 5 stars.)  I have a food allergy to wheat, and it makes dining out a little difficult.  I tend to eat at the same places because I know that I won't get sick.  We decided to step outside of the box and try a new place and I'm really glad we did.  We ordered the sweet plantains, savory plantains, I got chicken with mofongo, my oldest daughter got the chicken breast with arroz con gandules, my younger daughter got the Cuban sandwich and my friend got the fried pork with arroz con gandules.  Alberto, his fiancee (I think her name is Kim?), and his son were personable and fun to talk to, I would happily share a meal with them.  Now, on to the food:  Cuban sandwich - my daughter is not a fan of Swiss cheese, but I talked her into getting it to see if it was alright in this sandwich, and to scrape it off if she didn't like it.  She couldn't tell with the blend of flavors that it was there.  She saved half of it for lunch the next day and it was just as good.  Chicken breast with arroz con gandules - I often take bites of my kids' food.  I call it the mama tax, but really I just want to know what it tastes like.  The chicken was amazing, spiced perfectly, the texture was nice, and there was a crust upon it like I like.  The rice was easily the best part of that dish, making it all around delicious.  Chicken with mofongo - I have never had mofongo before, so I was really excited to try this.  It was by far the best thing I tasted.  This was a carb fueled meal, and this side dish was carby, fatty (from the oil, I think olive, so not bad fat), garlicky goodness.  Good PMS food, if carby, fatty foods are your thing, get it girl!  The chicken was crisp on the outside and juicy on the inside, perfectly cooked.  It could use a bit of seasoning, BUT if you just tear it off the bone and mix it in with the mofongo, it's perfection.  Savory plantains - the dipping sauce was the star and definitely needed.  I like plantain chips but these are thicker than plantain chips.  The consistency is nice with a crunchy outside and soft inside.  Sweet plantains - I love plantains and these were sweet perfection.  There aren't a lot of desserts that I can eat when we go out, so these were a welcomed sight.  Alberto gave my children and friend a dessert that was made with a flaky pastry dough and a creamy cheese center.  When asked if it was good, words failed my friend who is usually as verbose as I am when it comes to speaking about food.  Insert lots of jealous glares because I knew that I was unable to try it.  Once her speech had recovered, she told me the outer part was flaky, and I asked if it was buttery, like the pastry of baklava and she said it was.  That made me all the more jealous, I love the buttery pastry of baklava.  Damn allergies!  I only wish they were able to have a seating area inside, as the weather is getting hotter, eating outside will be less of a thing people will want to do.  I hope they expand, we will be back!"}
{"text":"We had a great meal that was cooked fresh and in front of my face. This is a little side restaurant that only provides carryout, but they have a table set outside if need be, We took the food back to our hotel room, and were reminded of all of the great food we were able to eat three years ago when we visited Puerto Rico. Both of the owners (husband and wife) were super friendly and personable. Although I do not live in the area, I will definitely make it a point to stop by periodically to get my fix of Puerto Rican food. Thank you El New Yorican Central Catering and Delivery for being so awesome!"}
{"text":"My son and I found this place on Father's Day. What a find. Great people and great food. I recommend those looking for delicious Puerto Rican food and friendly service to give them a try. When you walk in, you are in the kitchen. Catering and carry out only at this time. Free samples and a nice tour of the place. Even though they were very busy preparing for a Puerto Rican festival, we were treated like their only customers. 5 stars!!!!"}
{"text":"Wow! We took home three main dishes tonight for dinner and I am so impressed with this place. The service was friendly and great, and we didn't have to wait long at all. The food is simply amazing- better than Puerto Rican food I've had in Chicago even! I will definitely be back soon. Also, portions are huge :D"}
{"text":"I have at attempted to go to this place 3 times so far and they are always closed. Don't know if they went out of business."}
{"text":"Great food. Not a restaurant but there is an outdoor area where you can eat. This place is more take out/ catering."}
{"text":"Amazing Meal.  I have to start the review off that way.  The food is an excellent value meals are about 10 dollars each. You will not be hungry after eating here.  The pork was cooked spot on.  What I noticed when I left was how close the restaurant is to West Gate.  I am a season ticket holder for the Coyotes.  My wife and I always eat at west gate because it's easy and close.  Now before the games when we eat out we will come here.  Better value, food and service. Also being from NY area I know real deal Puerto Rican food. THIS IS THE REAL DEAL........."}
{"text":"Not Recommended! Got your attention....if you are void of favor buds in your mouth or rather not bother with things that are to unique and extremely delicious please don't bother your self with this food. Leave it for me.   Yes this food is amazing coming from a Trini that has only know that the best favors come for a West Indies carribean kitchen. This place is clean, the cook knows his stuff and you will not be disappointed. My mother in law is puetoriccan and she first introduced me to this awesomeness, so my standards are from her home cooked meals. Unfortunately she does not live in Phoenix. So thank you for being so damn good, I'll be back, this place deserves an award of the highest degree."}
{"text":"Wow!  I've missed this cuisine!  Didn't know how much until now.  We visited the restaurant today and are so happy we did.  I ordered the pernil which was perfectly cooked and seasoned.  My husband ordered Mofongo which was also amazing.  Thank you Alberto for being so good at what you do ! We WILL be back !"}
{"text":"The food is on point, a taste like home made, (just need small table to play some dominos) lol"}
{"text":"Alberto sat with us while he was preparing our meal. I must say the food was GREAT!  The Empanadas were so damn delicious the platanos were melt in your mouth. I put hot sauce on everything I eat but did not want to spoil the flavor of this delicious food. Please pay him a visit you will not regret it. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"OMG!! This is the best Puertorrican food I have had since I moved to AZ. Great prices and good portions. Was like being back home. The empanadillas were huge and full of meat. Loved them! Thank you Alberto for the awesome service and food! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I happened to find this restaurant by accident. The owners were so friendly we decided to try it out. I had never tried this type of food before but my daughter and I were hungry. We ordered a few things off the menu and it was absolutely amazing. I had no idea what I was missing  and Can't wait to go back and try some more"}
{"text":"This is truly the taste from home and it was like stepping in to my grandmother's kitchen back in Puerto Rico...!!! I'm a native of Puerto Rico from Rio Piedras and I grew in New York.. This  is something that body's true New York Rican style..!!! I do get homesick very frequently now I know where to get my fix...    To: Alberto(solo) i'm good for to those classic dishes we talked about yesterday.. Hit me up bro...!!!  thank you for bringing  such great awesome memories... One...   Juan Pablo Villegas Sr."}
{"text":"Mafungo/rice and beans amazing. Have to get the empanadas. My 3 year old loves the tostones"}
{"text":"The found this gem last month and been here a few times since. The owner is very friendly and the first time we went, he let us taste a few things. The food has amazing flavors! The mofongo is a delicious blend of plantains, butter and garlic. The beans and rice are amazing,too! I highly recommend the empanandas, too. Try it, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Best Puerto Rican food I'm the west side.. If you are looking for authentic Puerto Rican food than this is the place for you!!!!"}
{"text":"Wow---what great food I had the other day.  We had a groupon and used it for Pernil (marinated pork cooked for 30 hours) and the Carne Guisada (a beef stew with potatoes).  Both dishes were excellent.  The pork was SO tender and seasoned very well.  We also got an empanada, which was maybe my favorite of all.  the fried sweet plantains rounded out our meal.  I need to go back to try a Cuban sandwich.  I was given a sample of the homemade Cuban bread made fresh daily---delicious!!!  So fun to walk in and be in the kitchen.  I'll definitely be going back!!"}
{"text":"We are visiting from San Francisco and decided to look for a lunch spot. We found this place with great reviews. Lived up to the reviews. Great tasting authentic Puerto Rican food! We recommend the tostones, chuleta frita and pechuga de pollo."}
{"text":"FANTASTIC!!! I grew up in Puerto Rico; my family regularly went to Las Marias to visit my abuelita Carmen who was an amazing cook. I know how authentic Puerto Rican food tastes, this is authentic. The service is excellent, the food is heavenly, and the price is right. I will gladly be making regular trips from Scottsdale to Peoria to be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"I've been craving Puerto Rican food since we moved here from Chicago almost 2 years ago! We are happy we finally found some place with flavorful food! Not the best place or area, but well worth the drive. The pastelillo/beef empanada was the best thing we ate! It was huge and full of amazing picadillo. I'm happy we ordered 2! We bought the Yelp deal which scored us 3 plates of food (generous portions). We got: bistec encebollado, pernil, and chuleta. The arriz con gandules was great and the pernil was some of the best we've ever had. Props to the kid who was running the show while pops was out running an errand. I wish them well. On a side note, we got a flan which sadly needs some improvement. It actually wasn't sweet enough, lacked flavor. All in all, very happy! P.S. all was missing from the menu is a papa rellena and jibaritos!"}
{"text":"Wow first time here! My husband, 5 year old and I loved it! A taste of my childhood. I grew up eating food like this and was excited to have it again. I loved the lady that took and prepared our order she schooled my honey about not paying lol loved it. (Tip) men if you with your lady you better pay lol. I will be back soon."}
{"text":"At first I thought we walked into the wrong door, standing directly in the kitchen. The owner was super nice, explained that they're take away and catering. I ordered the peril and mufungo, my girlfriend had the Carne fritas and mufungo. We also got an order of pastelillos. We talked to the owner for a while, he cooked while my girlfriend and I discussed our upcoming wedding. We were still talking about catering when we asked him what he does as far as catering. He gave us tiny samples of the beef and chicken stew (amazing), and I ordered one of the cream cheese pastries (also delicious).  His catering options and pricing are so impressive, we are definitely hiring him for our wedding.   It was way too hot to eat at the outside seating, so we headed home. The pastelillos were huge and so filling I couldn't eat meal till the next day, and it was still impressive. My girlfriend was able to dig into her food then, thrilled with everything. It's easily as good as the food her family from Puerto Rico makes, which is really like a ten star rating."}
{"text":"Been forever since i had puerto rican food especially being from ny. I was so excited to try and this restaurant did not disappoint. Authentic and the bomb. Had tostones con ajo y butter olive oil sauce. Alcapurria's were stuffed with meat. The pernil was so tender, the mofongo was tender. And last but not least the bistec encebollados was perfectly seasoned. This was a family style dinner and no one was hungry after."}
{"text":"Delicious, plain and simple. It's rare to find Puerto Rican food this good let alone here in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Was looking for some Spanish food and found this on Yelp. I didn't realize it was mainly a take-out and catering business but the owner Albert greeted us warmly and the menu looked good. We ordered two entrees, appetizer and dessert and sat down while he cooked to order. First thing that came out was the two empanadas and we didn't even wait. We ate them right there while we chatted with him. Delicious!! Got the rest of our meal and he invited us to sit and enjoy it right there. Great experience, good food and a great guy. We will be back."}
{"text":"Great Puerto Rican food, I especially like the homemade empanadas! My son is a burger kid and decided to try the pork chops and Loved them! Owner is very personable and customer service oriented."}
{"text":"Please support!  Ran by good people making really good food.  The portion was enough for a king. Good prices good food good portions.  I will return! I hope the expansion comes asap because music and all this could be my new place."}
{"text":"Best food experience I've had in awhile. Alberto greeted us with open arms and treated us like family. The food was more than I expected which was really good and I will be bringing everyone I know back to this place."}
{"text":"I went there yesterday, 06/06/15, for a craving of my heritage food.  Was not disappointed with my choice from the menu.  Mofongo with chicharrones de pollo.  I can't wait to go back and have something else from the menu.  Thank you Alberto for the friendly and warm welcome."}
{"text":"This is the real deal if you're looking for puertorrican food. Flavors are on point on everything we tried. I highly recommend the mofongo with anything (we did shrimp and carne frita), everything is good here and don't forget to get the quesitos, for a second you'll forget that you're in Phoenix. Alberto sat down with us for a bit, and he's a cool dude that knows what he is doing, looking forward to go again.  Si eres de Puerto Rico o te gusta la comida de PR no dejes de ir. Pregunta por el coquito que está de show! Alberto gracias!"}
{"text":"The food here was awesome but only 4 stars because it's so greasy,  I mean stomach,  headache greasy.  I still couldn't stop eating because the food was that good.  There's no place to sit here since it's just a kitchen and a take out place.  The quesitos were very good,  and those I would absolutely return for."}
{"text":"Passed this shopping center many times but never took notice of the businesses there. Found this with the 'discover' part of Yelp. The owner Alberto is super nice. From the same neighborhood in NY as me, so I felt right at home. I got the Pork Pernil w/yellow rice & beans, an empanada, & mofongo. I had never eaten mofongo before so I was a little skeptical. Boy was I wrong! It as so good, as was everything else. I actually ate it for lunch & dinner & still have some mondo go left over for tomorrow. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Finally found the only Puertorican food in all of AZ!  IT WAS DELICIOUS!!!!!!!  #DOIT"}
{"text":"This restaurant has impressive customer service an amazing quality of food the owner was very thoughtful caring and acknowledged each customer personally. I would recommend my friends and my family to try out this Puerto Rican cuisine restaurant thank you once more for the delicious food"}
{"text":"This place has the best authentic peurto rican dish ever. Compliments to the chef who was also very friendly! I will definitely go back for more!!!"}
{"text":"I'm a real New Yorican so I feel confident that I can judge for authenticity.  I've been to Puerto Rico a couple times & my Puerto Rican family still lives in Brooklyn.  I moved to Avondale about four years ago.   My wife had a $25 off coupon (total must be at least $50) from Restaurant.com.  ENYC's website doesn't have their menu...WTH?!  Seriously?  C'mon!  Luckily a fellow Yelper posted a pic of the menu.  When I called to place my order, I was informed that the coupon is only good if 5 entrees are ordered.  The owner was very nice and patient.  There isn't a real marque on top of the restaurant, so I was lucky that there was day light.  You literally walk into the kitchen.  There is a table outside if you want to dine-in.  The owner was super nice and even gave me some beans on the house.  You can tell that the food is made with love.  It sure did smell authentic.  I got home and my family devoured it.  Big portions so lots of left-overs.  Yes, it's authentic.   Next time I'll try a flan and hopefully they'll have some pasteles available.  Totally understandable since Christmas just passed.  Pasteles are the Puerto Rican equivalent to Tamales.  They aren't easy to make and traditionally are eaten during the holidays.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"If you're like me and reading this, you've no doubt noticed the numerous 5-star ratings. And if you're also like me you may be scratching your head when you pull up to the address and find the parking lot nearly empty, and no sign of life.  Take note - it's real, in business and so worth the raves!  I've always wanted to try Puerto Rican food, and it was sooooo worth the wait. Purchased a coupon on Yelp and asked for suggestions since this was all new to me.  The Mofungo Con Camarones al Alajillo was so delicious, as was the Pernil.  So happy to see someone as passionate about cooking great food, and look forward to when they have a sit-down place to enjoy it again."}
{"text":"This food is the best! If you're trying to make a decision on where to go today, go here!! The empanadas, grilled chicken, rice and beans are my fav!"}
{"text":"Great food. Great proprietor. Fun experience. Spicy intricate food without being hot. The beans are world class. The yellow rice is tasty. The sweet platano was authentic. When he's talking I hear New York, but I'm tasting Miami."}
{"text":"Wanna be blown away by some seriously flavorful and well prepared food? Check out El New Yorican Central Catering in downtown Peoria.  I'm a former New Yorker who has had the pleasure of eating in New York City's amazing Puerto Rican eateries. This place is as good as any of them! Don't miss out on trying the mofongo, empanadas, fried pork, etc. Even the bread was hot, fresh and not to be missed.  I can't wait to try it again."}
{"text":"My co-worker recommended this restaurant to me. I haven't really been exposed to Puerto Rican food yet (which I'm hoping to change soon!).   I got the mofongo with carne frita, pastilillo, flan, and the quesito. Unfortunately he was out of the pasteles.   Pastilillo $3 -This was soooooooooo good. Stuffing was super delicious! Very well seasoned and cooked perfectly and moist. The outside pastry was nice and crunchy on the edges. Amazing!  Mofongo w/ Carne Frita $10 -Mofongo was delicious! My first time having mofongo but very very good. I'm not sure what he mixes it with (plantain chips or dried garlic?) but it added a bit of a crunch and created such a wonderful texture! -Carne Frita was actually too salty for me. If eaten with the mofongo it works out fine but by itself was too salty... You'll probably also need a metal knife to eat this! Plastic is not strong enough to cut through the crispy exterior.  Flan $3.75 -Yummy! Not too sweet, which is great after eating a heavy meal. Nice and light. Great way to end the meal.  Questio $2 -Pretty good but I thought it was a little too sweet for me. Cheese in puff pastry, like a danish but diff shape.   Overall, price of the food made a lot of sense. It's fairly large (and heavy food) so bring your appetite!   TIP:  -there's not really seating at this restaurant. I would suggest ordering by phone at least 30 mins ahead for pick up! Also, this will tip you off to whether he's open or not that day. -He accepts credit cards but it's always better to pay cash to support these mom&pop shops!"}
{"text":"We called in our order and it was ready in about 15 mins. We ordered the Pernil, the Mofongo Con Camerones Al Alajillo, and the Plantanos Maduros. The food was wonderful and full of flavor. Owner was super nice too.  Will definitely recommend this place to everyone we know!"}
