{"text":"This place is a hidden gem.  Best crust in town.  Everything is fresh.  Absolutely outstanding!"}
{"text":"Unique and delicious pizzas - gluten free crust tastes great!"}
{"text":"I have had pizza in Italy many times. It reminds me of sitting at an Italian Cafe eating the same quality of pizza. The owner is always checking to see if there is anything he can do to make your eating experience better. The wine selection is also great. The desserts are all home made and are excellent. I highly recommend this establishment."}
{"text":"One of those places that you take the first bite and you can't wait to come back and have more I had my cappuccino and cupcake first and then my pizza it's awesome it's one of the best pizza / Bakery all organic in the valley... very cool Decor great music lot of cool things going on there and it's a hotspot"}
{"text":"This is a family owned restaurant that has fabulous food-- the best pizza I have ever eaten.  I had the Earth pizza for take out the first time, and the pizza with fig jam and prosciutto this time as well as the kale salad.  It was absolutely fabulous!  It is very informal, a good place for families.  My husband and I will be back over and over."}
{"text":"5 star pizza - cm2 nailed everything right; the sauce, the crust (omg), and the mozzarella . So happy to see them doing well and a very pleased palate."}
{"text":"Went to CM2 for the second time today. Like the first visit it did not disappoint.  Atmosphere is a very comfortable great place to hang and have a great dinner.  My favorite is the Butcher Cuts pizza.  Having eaten pizza all over the country (Chicago New York Boston Etc) it's amazing the quality of pizza minutes from my door.  I have become. Regular!"}
{"text":"Incredible pizza!! Everything on the menu rocks!  If you're into great ingredients and great atmosphere check this place out. Don't miss the cupcakes and cookies!"}
{"text":"Great pizza ... Great people ... My husband left a review a few days ago and I thought I would chime in as well.  Truly a great pizza experience."}
{"text":"With the closure of our favorite pizza shop we were looking for a new one.  We found it at CM2! We went with another couple and ordered three pizzas, two red and one white.  All three were delicious.  The owner, Nantas, explained how they source their ingredients and the freshness really came through.  The crust was light and perfectly cooked.  The wine list was reasonably priced with good variety.  The one drawback for me was no beer on tap, just bottles.  Service was good and very welcoming.  Check this new place out!"}
{"text":"Outstanding! Pizzas were delicious! Loved the fig, Gorgonzola one.  Great casual vibe. Good food and wine."}
{"text":"Really good pizza and pastries.  Great location if you are stuck in the great via Linda dead end toward fountain hills.  Pizza menu was varied and I am not usually a white sauce pizza guy, but the \"Hot Chick\" pizza was killer awesome.  The peppers were sweated within an inch of their life.  In a good way.  I was going to put some Valentina hot sauce on it, but it is just fine as is.  Pastries are done everyday, they said they will be open early in August for breakfast service.  Will definitely check that out."}
{"text":"My friend and I have gone around the valley trying different pizza restaurants. So far... we have been to about 30 pizza locations. CM2 is our Number 1 Choice of having The Best Pizza out of the 30.  The sauce and crust are the real deal. If you want the real deal in pizza.... then CM2 should be your next stop!"}
{"text":"Hours listed are wrong. Me and my family showed up at 9:25 PM and they were already closed and in the process of cleaning up. Yelp listed 10 PM and the hours on their door also said 10 PM. Owner said that it was a misprint, which I can get, but then you have to step up to the plate and fix the problem by either staying open late or covering up the times until it can be fixed.

The owner was friendly, and the place did seem quite well done on the inside. I very much liked the Decour."}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza place and this is a pizza town!  The sauce is incredible, the crust is crispy and chewy and the cheese is the best. They don't coat the pizza in tons of ingredients. The right amount of everything to create the perfect composition. 

They also have a great Italian bakery. Great cookies.  Don't  miss this gem. 

The service is fast and courteous every time. 

Wish they were open everyday and for lunch."}
{"text":"They just opened (CM2) and it is without question the best place to get pizza in this neck of the woods (15 mile radius plus-which includes a lot of pizza establishments as there are many nearby).  

CM2 serves an absolutely delicious pizza ... They use a very nice sweet sauce combined with a semi-thin crust and the highest quality cheeses  ... 

It's a fantastic combination ...

VERY impressive (legit 5 star Yelp experience)

I would like to see them update the sizing ... They need a larger take home pie ... If you get just the personal, it's not big enough for 2-3 (myself and my two boys).  But if you get TWO ... it tends to be too much for 2-3 and then it's regret time for stuffing yourself (as thin and light as the pie is). 

Now you might say just put the extras in the fridge, but this is just too good to put away for later.  It's all getting eaten one shot.

An $18-20 Margherita larger pie would do the trick to feed everyone.  I think if they had that, I would go up every 3rd night and save myself from cooking.  But when you have to buy TWO personal pies and come up at near $30 ... maybe only once a week.

The bigger one should be take home only of course ...

Try it ... I see a lot of 5 star Yelp reviews in their future ... we finally got lucky with a great spot for pizza in the Scottsdale/Fountain Hills area ...

Gary =)"}
{"text":"This is REAL Italian pizza - thin crust, fresh premium cheese and ingredients and delicious like Pizza in Naples.  Their Margherita pizza is the best in Arizona.  My 18 year-old footbal/lacrosse playing son loves the Calzones and they are so huge he can't finish one, and believe me, this boy can eat.   Love the place - local Italian family owned and operated.  This is the real deal and worth the drive if you don't live nearby."}
{"text":"Bar none THE best pizza EVER!!! I thought Pomo was good, this is OUTSTANDING!!
The crust is heaven on earth!!!!
Go to 11485 N 136th Street in Scottsdale!!!
OMG!!!  Shea at Via Linda Street.
We have dined with this family for 17 years at Casa Mia BEST Italian food in Scottsdale!!
Nantas is the proprietor and is as charming as he is knowledgeable!! Urban FUN vibe!
Excellent wine selection!!!
This will be your new favorite restaurant!!

Went in again tonight  to pick up pizzas to watch the Ohio State game.  Their white pizzas (no red sauce) are sooooo GOOD!!!"}
{"text":"This has got to be the best pizza we have ever eaten.  It's fabulous!  The crust is out of this world and toppings are wonderful. I recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"This is the only place I will have pizza from now on!
I love the Four Seasons and the Butcher Cuts! 
The tarts are wonderful and they even have Kombucha. 
See you soon!"}
{"text":"This the best Italian restaurant restaurant I've been to in Scottsdale and I just got back from Italy. You need to find this place. Phenomenal food, drinks and family friendly. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great coffee and pastry! The atmosphere is friendly and a place where you can settle in and be with friends. Pizza is delicious. Nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"CM2 has such amazing food!! Ingredients are so fresh and well prepared. The pizza is the only pizza our family will eat now! The fresh mozzarella is so delicious and the pizza crust light with just enough crunchiness to chew ratio. 
Nantaz is so warm and welcoming. He is always chatting with us and our kids and checks on every table. 
The panini sandwiches, yum!! The bread is delicious, crusty on the outside and soft in the middle. Their burrata....to die for! 
So nice to have an authentic, family owned and delicious restaurant in our neighborhood!!"}
{"text":"This (pizza-only) review hurts.  Everything about this place is 4 or 5 stars - except the pizza crust.  The service is good.  The menu is inviting.  The wine list is reasonably priced.  The pizzas are generously topped with quality ingredients.  So what's the (pizza) problem?

The crust was poor - and actually tasted mostly of uncooked, plain flour.  My dining partner and I both independently used the term 'floury' to describe this crust.  It seemed to both of us that perhaps the dough had the wrong ratio of flour and liquid - and we both thought it needed something (a little olive oil?).  The results out of the oven (we tried two different pizzas - one red, one white) were thin and crackery with no chew or texture other than pastiness.

I really wanted to like this place as the pizza toppings and just about everything else were very nice.  (The white 'Nerano' pizza topped with shrimp, pesto, and two kinds of cheese was otherwise near-great).  It's still a fairly new place - so maybe they are still working out the kinks?  I hope so...  Though we left unimpressed with the pizza dough - if I happened to be in the (somewhat remote) area again I would give it another shot.  I find it hard to believe on our visit we got their best pizza-foot forward..."}
{"text":"Truly amazing pizza. I don't live super close to this location and do not really visit this area often, but it is completely worth it. It was completely empty when I went here last night, we were the only customers haha. The menu is amazing, a lot of really cool options. I have got to take my food allergy-ridden family here because they have options like gluten free and also a cheese-less pizza. Lots of vegetarian pizzas of me to choose from as well!
My boyfriend and I decided to get two different pizzas so we could share. I got Norma which rad a red pizza with mozzarella, dry aged ricotta, eggplant, and cherry tomatoes. My boyfriend got earth which has mozzarella, some different vegetables and arugula. We both liked my pizza a lot more, the sauce was just so delicious. The crust was perfect too, did not get too soggy in the middle, just right! 
The owner chatted with us a bit and was friendly, told us all about his restaurant and their food, very cool! We were going to buy brownies but he told us we had to try the cookies..they were amazing! He gave us one coconut and one chocolate chip. The chocolate chip one was the best, like full of chocolate, yum! Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried this restaurant for the first time today and we are very pleasantly surprised! Wonderful fresh ingredients fantastic fresh crust and sauce was really tasty! Definitely coming back to Mod Pizza many more times and plan to include family next time."}
{"text":"I am really excited to have this place newly opened in the neighborhood! I have only gone here a couple of times for breakfast and coffee, but I am definitely looking forward to coming in for some pizza. The pastries are fresh, the espresso is strong and flavorful, and they even have a nice selection of bottled craft beers (it doesn't get much better than that!) If you haven't checked this place out, I recommend doing so :)"}
{"text":"Chocolate, chocolate and chocolate. I just came home from heaven, oh I mean dinner. 

I saw this place as \"hot and new\" on Yelp and since it's only five mins from my house, I couldn't wait to try for their pizza.

I started my dinner with a glass of wine from Sicily. It didn't have that aroma I like in my favorite wine but it tastes very smooth. Their wine list by the bottles weren't very extensive but had some of the good ones at a reasonable price. Good place to come with a group of friends to share a bottle.

We shared Margherita pizza and one of their vegetarian white pizza. Pizza was baked in a proper oven, tomato sauce on Margherita tasted really fresh. Vegetable on white pizza, especially egg plants tasted like real egg plants. Well it is real egg plants, what I mean by that was quality egg plants.

For deserts, they have several baked sweets. I tried gluten free cookies and chocolate muffin. Oh the chocolate on chocolate muffin was so heavenly. He used high percent of Belgium chocolate and to offset the acidity, he said he used maple syrup. Server put in the oven before serving, chocolate melted in my mouth. To top it off, I ate chocolate gluten free cookie made with almond flour. 

Both went well is again properly made macchiato. My coffee tasted good Arabica beans, and they make coffee right. Proper Italian way.  

How many times did I use the word \"proper\" in this review? Not sure but that's the right word to explain this pizzeria. 

They are so closed to one of my hiking trail. Since they are open for breakfast, I am looking forward to stopping by here after my hike for more heavenly chocolate muffin and good pizza."}
{"text":"Just opened CM2 Pizzeria and Bakeshop. 
This is the sibling restaurant to Casa Mia. If you have ever had dinner at Casa Mia then you will know how wonderful the food is there and CM2 holds the same high standard of perfection! This awesome new spot is filled with baked goods that are so delicious you can tell every item is made with love and appreciation of food. The chocolate croissant was so light and went perfect with the café Americano. Cinnamon roll was so good I could just eat a spoon full of the frosting by itself. I will definitely be back to try a few more items and of course the pizza! Stay tuned for more updates!"}
{"text":"Being all about breakfast or brunch I was very excited to try out this new neighborhood spot. The early morning pastries have all been delicious. And having tried their new weekend brunch a couple of times, all I can say is, excellent!"}
{"text":"No surprise CM2 is a slice of heaven!! Sodano Family has created another Italian wonder! 

The restaurant is beautiful and clean.  Great little date night spot or girls night! 
Everyone is the staff is so friendly and attentive - you will not be disappointed! 

Food:  
We started with the bruschetta - this is so flavorful! Great to share.  Sliced like pizza on Focaccia. 

Tuscan Kale: the best salad - dressing is light yet has the lemon bite. 
Meat and Cheese board: You can just taste the quality in the meat! Real Italian ham and prosciutto with bread and perfect cheese pairs. 

We ordered 3 pizzas - We were hungry - All of them delicious and unique in their own way. I would recommend them each! Picture Shown. 

MARGHERITA:  You CANNOT go wrong here. Perfect ratio of cheese and sauce with the basil bites - yum! Good for any non-meat eater or just looking for a good pizza. 

AMALFITANA: I think I will nominate this as my favorite, who doesn't love perfect pizza crust with marinara, mozz. cheese, arugula, and prosciutto! Heavenly! 

FICO: This was the more unique and had a big flavor variety.  You have the fig jam, truffle oil, Gorgonzola and thin slice of spec.  This takes you on a flavor roller coaster! 

How could we not top the night off with some of the homemade pastries!  Croissants (chocolate), Nutella and Apricot pastries, and peanut butter protein balls - Oh my! 


If you are in the area or just want a great dinner from a great family - this is your spot!!!"}
{"text":"Exactly what you would expect from wonderful Casa Mia. Great quality, their fresh one of a kind sauce, and an crowd pleasing menu. Awesome pizza! Gluten free is delish, and there cannoli's are incredible...
Bravo!!!"}
{"text":"I'm always looking for a healthy alternative to regular restaurants. The pizza is great and the desserts are absolutely delicious. I love that the deserts are gluten free and they use coconut sugar. It's a great family run business. I will be back."}
{"text":"Excellent pizzas and salads. Fresh ingredients, in-house mozzarella and their caesar dressing is fantastic. Quick service and great casual environment. This is becoming our go to pizza place."}
{"text":"Great pizza. Great staff. Great organic healthy crust. Great wine list. Great store upfront. Really reasonable prices and totally committed people"}
{"text":"If there's one thing we've learned through our frequent pizza hunting throughout the city is that, often times, the most incredible food is sometimes found in the most unlikely of places.  

There's a cozy little pizzeria not too far from here called Il Bosco. At first glance, I would have quickly dismissed them as another neighborhood \"filler.\" In Biltmore, there's a locally owned joint called Base Pizzeria hidden in a cookie-cutter strip mall. Both places have become two favorites that my girlfriend and I often revisit once every few months, despite very low expectations initially.

So going into CM2, I tried to keep an open-mind. I don't live in this neighborhood, so I'm not judging it based on convenience from my house. I'm basing it on quality in comparison to my other pizza experiences. And as much as I wish I didn't have to say it, I don't really feel this place offers as much as I had hoped.

The decor is nicely designed and the place, despite being pretty dead on a Saturday night, had a cool atmosphere to it. I've never dined at the nearby Casa Mia (same ownership), but I'm assuming many of its patrons are also fans of this restaurant as well.

Some of the reviewers claim it's fully authentic Italian pizza, comparable to what they've had in Italy. Although I find this questionable when I see pizza options that offer BBQ sauce and fish combined with cheese, but hey - it's all about what you like, I guess.

We started with a meat and cheese board, which consisted of three of each, as well as some olives and a measly two cuts of heavily toasted bread. I think we've just become spoiled, as many boards these days are a bit more creative in their presentation, adding in fruits, figs, oil, and all kinds of neat little surprises. This one was pretty standard. I know what can be had for 20 bucks and I can assure you, it's far more than what is offered here.

For pizzas, we ordered a standard margherita and a fico, featuring everyone's favorite food perfume: truffle oil. I'll admit, the pizza looked good. The crust had that nice charred and slightly bubbly texture that usually delivers in taste. Unfortunately, a few bites revealed that it was void of any flavor - meaning that no amount of toppings would save these pizzas from failure. The tomato sauce had that pasty aftertaste, while the cheese, fig jam, and speck on the fico were passable.

Servers were friendly, albeit a bit slow considering how dead they were. Total price was way too high, considering we decided to bypass dessert and have paid the equivalent for food that's both superior in quality and quantity elsewhere.  

If you live in the neighborhood and are simply wanting local food, then I'm sure this place will work out just fine. But if you're like us and actually go out of your way to seek out good pizza spots and have a strong baseline for comparison, you'll probably be less than impressed."}
{"text":"Pizza taste and dough quality is just as close as it gets to home made Italian pizza in Southern Italy. If you are looking for Oreganos pizza , this is not that type. 
Great chocolate cup cakes too"}
{"text":"I take my pizza experience very seriously, and I finally found the place to give me dream worthy amazingness in every bite.  From the crust to the cheese to the yummy fresh herbs and OMG the sausage!  We drove 120 miles round trip to indulge our taste buds and will continue to do so until we can convince the owner Nantas to build a location closer to us northern valley dwellers.  If you crave a true Italian pizza taste bud experience then you will not be disappointed. Wine selection chosen by Nantas was fabulous as well and don't forget to go home with pasta and oils so you can bring a little taste of Italy home.  Hands down the best Pizza in Arizona. Finally someone is giving San Fran Pizzeria's a competition and I don't have to hop on a plane to get my taste buds satisfied any longer. If you live close to this place there is no doubt you will become a regular and I am forever jealous.  Dream Worthy on every level."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza. Perfect cookie. Chef is talented and genuinely interested in customer satisfaction"}
{"text":"Have you Ever been somewhere sap delicious that you want keep it a secret so it remains quaint and easy to get a table? Well I hesitate to review Cm2 because Irs amazing and when people try it it will no longer be a neighborhood best kept secret.  The pizza crist is so delicious.  It's light and airy. The ingredients are fresh and generous.  The kale salad is simple and delicious.  And if there is room for desert have a chocolate chip cookie. They are divine.  

Great cappuccino and the wine offerings are wonderful."}
{"text":"We just moved down the street from cm2 and casa Mia and we are absolutely obsessed. There is a reason this cute Italian restaurant has been here for so long. Everything is fresh and homemade. If I could eat here everyday I would lol."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner with friends tonight. We ordered the Butcher pizza and a white sauce pizza with fig jam. One of my friends had the cauliflower soup which was soooo good. Both pizzas were wonderful. Perfect crust and taste. We shared a bottle of Malbec wine and shared a chocolate muffin for dessert.  It was absolutely heavenly. We enjoyed our conversation with the owner as well. The wait staff were courteous and very friendly. I am going back next week with two or three of my friends. Cannot wait."}
{"text":"The pizza was excellent!!! Very authentic Italian thin crust, the sauce was very flavorful and ingredients were fresh and tasty. 

So why didn't I give it 5 stars?

The staff is very friendly, but the server spent nearly the entire time we were eating at our table talking with us. I don't mind some small talk but they should have said \"I'll let you eat your pizza, thank you\". It wasn't relaxing as they wouldn't leave and continued to engage."}
{"text":"Our favorite family spot when we arrive in town early! Nantas greets my girls in Hebrew and my hubs & I with hugs and smiles. It's truly family run owned& operated. They know most of their guests by name. It's the one spot where I know everything is made with great ingredients sourced in a positive way and made the way you imagine pizza to be! 
Also, the gluten free chocolate chip cookies are ridiculous! I'm 100 not promoting gluten free- idk one way or another- but these cookies are magical"}
{"text":"CM2 has the most authentic Italian pizzas perfectly baked with a crispy crust and ultra fresh organically grown vegetables and herbs. We were raving about the truly exceptional sausage on our pizza, and owner Nantas told us that it is also made in-house. My favorite pizza is their \"Chuck Franklin\" (with pepperoni, their special sausage, wonderful tomato sauce & cheese, vivid red peppers and thinly sliced tender onions). Also, the Margarita pizza is one of the best that I've ever had. 
We're so in love with their pizza that we pick it up for home, as well. 
And, you have got to have one of their desserts! Their desserts & bakery breads are made fresh in-house every day. In fact, you can see the chefs and bakers right through the large glass windows of the kitchen. The tarts are velvety smooth with a tender, buttery crust & the taste is...off the charrrts!  Check out the video clip showing one that I brought home. 
They also serve more than pizza; you can check out my photo below of their menu, and, they're now open for brunch on Saturdays & Sundays.
The decor is rustic-contempo, the service is excellent, the wine selection is wonderful and they make you feel like family!"}
{"text":"Just went to CM2 this week and hadn't been there is a while.  Had the calzone for the first time - absolutely amazing.  Definitely the best calzone in AZ.  Also, they have a nice selection of good wines at reasonable prices.  I only wanted a glass but the bottle price was too good to pass up, so I had two glasses and corked the bottle to go.  Nantas, the owner, always friendly to guests.  So glad it's nearby - a local, hidden gem."}
{"text":"Wow!!  Our new favorite pizza place and so close to home!  The pizza was amazing, the crust incredible.  The chocolate cupcake at the end may the best I've ever had.  The bottles of wine are very reasonably priced.  The staff was incredible and the owner (who is the son of the owners from next door Casa Mia, which is my favorite Italian place in the area) spent lots of time with us talking about the food and the restaurant.  He took our kids in the back to see the pasta machine after hearing that my daughter makes her own pasta.  The latte at the end was the perfect way to wrap up the meal.  We will be back many times and couldn't be more excited to have to Italian options so close!"}
{"text":"CM2 is a new Italian pizzeria that offers the best quality ingredients. I was very impressed with the flavor in each bite, from the freshness of the tomatoes to the deliciousness of smell & texture of the dough. My personal favorite pizza of theirs is the \"Chuck Franklin\" & the Margarita Pizza which was one of the best I ever had. Every time I visit Scottsdale I am welcomed in by owner Nantas and receive great hospitality. Oh yeah, & save room for desert..."}
