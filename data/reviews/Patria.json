{"text":"Great decor. Waiter was friendly and helpful. Food delicious. Pretty expensive for the portions given (even though it's tapas, the portions are still pretty small for the price). For example, the pimentos were good but there were probably 8 little peppers in the small bowl ($9 if I remembered correctly). Tried several tapas dishes, really liked the pepper stuffed with manchego and oxtail. The assorted jamon plate is good too!  Not a big fan of the bacon wrapped dates. All in all, it was a good experience."}

{"text":"We ate dinner here and had the patatas bravas, the halibut and the meatballs.  The meatballs were the special that evening.  All of them were very tasty but the meatballs were our favorite.  We sat on the patio which was a very nice spot - great when the weather is nice but you can't see much light because this place is stuck between two buildings so out on the patio you are looking at a brick wall.  Still, the atmosphere is nice and the dining indoor looked like a great place to be as well.  It is a little hard to find - it is right next to the Patagonia store so make sure you look up to see the gate that reads Patria and then walk beyond it towards the restaurant.  The patio is in front of the restaurant."}
{"text":"PATRIA 
-Staff AMAZING friendly polite constant and good service/10 
-VENUE really well put together lighting music etc  /10
-BEVERAGE selection adequate and priced accordingly /9
-FOOD, experienced the PRE SET MENU group of 8 Not doing that again, the best part of the set menu was the roasted Garlic and pretty much raw Beef Slices , I'm aware of tapas dinning , however when the group collectively felt hungry after a 1:45 sit time , not too cool ,THERE IS ONLY SO MUCH 4 bottles of wine and cocktails can do to your appetite /6

I'd  definitely go back NEVER to a pre set menu though."}
{"text":"Love the ambiance. Went here for a romantic dinner and the food was delicious. Some dishes more unique than others, but overall it was pretty good. The one thing that I don't think I would get again is the paella (some restaurants can do this better and it is way over-priced - 48$ for seafood), ribeye ($42), the infamous iberico de bellota ($30). Don't get me wrong, these dishes were decent but not as delicious as one would expect (the melting of the iberico in your mouth as one would expect, did not happen). The ribeye was cooked very well but nothing particularly special about it.

Their other tapas were good, particularly:

patatas bravas - potatoes, fried egg and spicy tomato
monte enebro - goat cheese w/house bread 
octopus
lobster croquette
daitles con tocino iberico dates - dates, iberico bacon, etc.

This is definitely a nice place to go for a romantic date or a girls night out w/a pitcher of sangria. 

Would return again!"}
{"text":"My family and I had an incredible experience at Patria last night with both service and food. We started off with two cocktails - asked for something on the more tart side and they adjusted the sugar in the drink without a problem. We also ended up trying the red and white sangria, both were great.

All the dishes were ordered were unique and delicious! Favourite were the pan con tomate (had one with manchego and one with Spanish anchovies) - looking forward to trying this at home. Bacon-wrapped dates, spicy pepper inside was perfect with the sweet date. Seafood Paella, really great flavour in the rice and loved the mix of seafood. Best dish of the night was definitely the octopus, personally my first time having it and it went perfectly with the small pieces of fried potato.

Tried several desserts as well and all were perfect, amazing flavours and plating was beautiful. But I think the highlight was the tea, very few restaurants I've been to in Toronto give tea with actual leaves steeping. It was a great surprise and a nice end to the night."}
{"text":"Came here with some girl friends. The tapas are very creative and tasty! All of them are exquisite and full of flavors! Didnt have a chance to try the paella coz it would take too long. Will definitely do when i come again! Many staff there speak Spanish =P the price is not the most attractive, but the food is amazing!"}
{"text":"Most of the plates I've had here have been really good. This place is good for a date or a group of 4 to 6. There is an area on the 2nd floor for a larger party - it looks like it fits 8 to 12 people. My favourite dishes are the queso de cabra frito and the croquetas de manchego. One plate I thought was okay was the fideo pasta. I also tried the ribeye which was also okay. For dessert, the churros, the mousse de limon, and the mousse de dulce de leche were all extremely delicious. Some of the best desserts I've ever had. I also love the decor and the ambiance. Overall, I would recommend this place to anyone looking for good spanish food with a good crown and atmosphere."}
{"text":"A bit expensive but the food is great. Very nice and fancy room it looks classy for sure. It is supposedly tapas menu but a lot of things are around 12 bucks for each dish which makes it hard to grab a lot of things. You really can't go wrong though here, perfect for a date so you can wine and dine them and impress with your foodie knowledge."}
{"text":"Absolutely delish! The location, interior, food, service at this place is point. 
We ordered a bunch of tapas and all were so great. 
Recommendations:
The special spicy tuna and avocado, oxtail, paella (make sure U put in the order as soon as U get drinks- take 45 min), and for dessert... The churros are bomb. 

Really great place. Expect to drop a lot though cause it's not exactly cheap, and you're gonna wanna order a bunch of things. Can't wait to come by again!"}
{"text":"Exquisite! The best tapas I've had, and the best Spanish food I've had! We ordered the lobster and shrimp paella as our large sharing entree, just fantastic! Very well designed and aesthetically appealing interior of the restaurant as well."}
{"text":"Excellent service,  fantastic paella Patria and bacon wrapped dates.  You'll love the decor too! I want to go back to try more dishes,  definitely worth the higher price point if you are willing"}
{"text":"Definitely AVOID this place if you're looking for a superior dining experience. The staff at Patria treated my friend and I with disrespect, speaking in a condescending and patronizing manner. It should not be abnormal to go for dessert and drinks on a Monday night. The food and drinks are also totally over-priced. It is very obvious that they only value you as patrons if you're willing to throw down exorbitant amounts of cash. Toronto is full of amazing restaurants with high quality food AND service. It is not enough to just have reasonable food."}
{"text":"6 of us we went on sat night. 
Did the tasting Menu. 
Lots of food lots of different flavors. 
Loved the place, great atmosphere and friendly service.  
Will come back for sure."}
{"text":"Patria is the best addition to a Toronto foodie's palate.  I travel a lot, so I've experienced various cuisines from the hole in the walls of NYC to The French Laundry in Napa.  I'm glad to see that the foodie scene in Toronto is almost at par with some big US cities and it's now starting to get some Spanish influence.  The vibe: chic and trendy.  It's one big room and so it is a bit loud, but that's what adds to the character of this place; much like Pipa in NYC.  The bar has some of the best spanish wines that can be found in the city. Our waitress was amazing and knew the menu very well, which was a nice surprise.  She also gave us some suggestions on which Cava would go best with our starters and they blended perfectly together. I've been in Toronto for 5 years now, but I've never been able to find a Sangria that I truly enjoyed (outside of my own).  Patria has changed that.  Perfectly crisp and fruity, and most importantly, NOT watered down!  The food is basically Tapas style.  I know many people are not a fan of this trend, but I personally, enjoy having various small plates to choose from without getting overly full.  The Tomate bread with manchego is so simple but delectable.  The avocado salad with goat cheese is a larger portion, but hands down the best salad of the sort you will ever taste.  We were only two, so our waitress advised us not to get the paella as it would be too filling to enjoy the other items on the menu.  The chorizo pasta dish was divine and perfectly balanced. As our main meat, we chose the pork, which truly does melt in your mouth.  Again, most of what we ordered were suggested by our waitress who got to know our tastes before making suggestions.  I can't remember her name but she makes everything sound delicious, and once we tasted everything, we were not disappointed.  Another plus is that this place takes reservations.  That's one complaint I have with many top Toronto restaurants that don't allow reservations.   It's nice not to have to wait for 2 hours for  great meal and have the rest of the evening to enjoy.  So, if you haven't tried this place out yet, go soon, before they too stop taking reservations!!"}
{"text":"This place is tucked away along the driveway by West Lodge and behind Patagonia.  If you're not looking for it specifically, you'd probably won't come across it.  I think it adds to its charm. 

The place is beautiful inside with it's ridiculously high ceilings, massive pieces of artwork along the walls and floor to ceiling windows that line one side of the restaurant.  Love the atmosphere. 

I came here and had the following: 
- fried squid that came with aioli and a red pepper dip (pretty good but standard)
- piquillo peppers stuffed with oxtail & manchego (lovely, the oxtail was tender and the manchego gave it a melt in your mouth texture)
- fideo pasta with clams & chorizo with a huge dollop of aioli that was mixed in at the table by the server (this was delicious but not your standard \"pasta\" it's not saucy so you have to re-set your expectation if that's what you're thinking). I asked for chili flakes which the server misunderstood and provided chili sauce, which was even better!  The chili sauce is delicious, not on the vinegary side and slightly sweet.  I'd get it just to compliment any dish. 
- broccolini with almond garlic gazpacho & garlic chips (perfectly sauteed and the gazpacho was good but didn't taste like almonds, I couldn't figure out what it exactly tasted like)
- lemon mousse olive oil cake - yummeh!  Not too sweet, a bit on the dense side for mousse but I enjoyed it. 
- churros - can't go wrong with churros and the dulce de leche makes it that much better

Overall, I really enjoyed the meal and the service was good. I'd come back here with friends when I'm back in town in a heart beat."}
{"text":"I'd give this 3.5 stars if I could.

The space is gorgeous and the ambiance is great. Beautiful low light, nice tall ceilings and clean understated decor but the space is incredibly loud. Once about half of the tables cleared out I was finally able to hear people talking at my table. 

Dinner was decent but nothing really amazing. We had an ok paella, some decent potatoes. The olives were not great (I'd skip those for sure next time) but the bread was delicious. 

Dessert was the highlight. We split the churros, the basque cake and the fried milk. All were extremely well done. I only wish that the meal had been as good.  

Service was efficient, if not a little cold (though I prefer that to overly smiley servers who make off jokes and bad small talk). 

One big pet peeve was that the hostess didn't look up from her iPad when we walked in and didn't know that our table had already arrived when we got there. She just told us that there was no reservation under the name we told her. If they hadn't seen us from across the restaurant we might have left. Then we stood there awkwardly holding our coats in front of the coat rack for a few minutes until we finally flagged someone down. Not the best first impression - someone should greet you smiling, know that your reservation has already arrived and ask to take your coat right away. 

if friends were going for dinner I'd join them but probably wouldn't go back on my own. That said, I would go back in a heartbeat just for dessert."}
{"text":"I am a sucker for good service, and what EXCEPTIONAL service I had tonight. And even better food. Allowed the server to simply order for us and couldn't have made a better decision. The fried squid, soft shell crab, and seafood paella were highlights. And again, EXCEPTIONAL service from the entire parade of servers who brought us our dishes, and the manager who checked in several times. Thank you for understanding what service should be!"}
{"text":"Great great great décor and atmosphere. Really felt like you were walking into something special. Service was attentive and knowledgeable answering my questions about the menu while also providing some suggestions. 

If you don't know, it is a Spanish tapas style restaurant. Meaning dishes are rather small and you should order quite a decent number of servings in order to leave satisfied, The quality and taste of the food was phenomenal. Still remember the wrapped dates, which were really different. Unfortunately did not get a chance to try the paella but will be in to try them soon. 

Great spot for a date, just be careful with the bill, you'll keep ordering and ordering!"}
{"text":"Not that impressed.  Came here for bday dinner, white wine was nice.  But food wise, the date dish was delish.  However the empanadas and potato side dish wasn't that impressive and the quantity is really small.  Paellea Patria is good with the seafood, but at $33 for a small it was a really small portion. Not worth it...."}
{"text":"Amazing!!!!!!!! What a great experience!!!! The food was tantalizing!!! We ordered some different tapas as well as the seafood paella. It was absolutely mouth watering. Please try the dates you wont be disappointed!  The Emina rose wine also added to the perfection. The male wait staff was aesthetically pleasing but our waitress Natasha was excellent! She was friendly knowledgeable and attentive. Viva Patria!"}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday after reading so many great reviews.

However, I was extremely disappointed by the food.  We ordered quite a bit of food.

Good
Patria Paella- The crispy rice at the bottom is the best part.  Order early
Dates+Bacon- nice sweet flavour with the saltiness of the bacon
Bombas Con Salsa Brava- Essentially a deep fried chorizo meatball
Brussell Sprouts- Nice healthy addition
Churros-Nicely deep fried

Decent
Fois Gras Bocadillo- idea was good, but executed improperly.  The Fois gras was not seared and therefore, not caramelized.  Bread was a small brioche bun, that I felt you could buy at Rabba's
Oxtail-Meat was tender, but nothing special

Bad
Croquetas De Manchego- tasted like a panko encrusted ball of mashed potatoes, not worth it at all
Patatas Bravas- this was probably the WORST dish I have had in a high-end restaurant in a long time.  The potatoes were essentially undercooked, not crispy McCain frozen potatoes with generic tomato sauce and a fried egg.  It tasted like something I would drunkenly make at 4AM, except I could probably make it better than this $9 plate.  Absolutely horrible, do not order.

Personally, do not understand the hype at all.  The atmosphere/decor is gorgeous and may be the reason why it still remains so popular- would recommend going to Portland Variety down the street instead.  

I do have to say that the service was 5 stars though!"}
{"text":"This felt like just hype. The place looks good, hip music and an upscale crowd. However, food is below par. I've dined at a few Spanish restaurants around the globe, suffice to say I had the worst paella at Patria. 
Drinks are watered down and very expensive. We paid $200 for a dinner for two.

Would not return or recommend to anyone looking for good food"}
{"text":"We went there last night for a date night dinner. It was just awesome!! Cocktails were smooth and tasted heavenly. Food was great and filling too. Every tapas plate was so finely done. The waitress and the servers were very pleasant too. This place deserves a 5 star. Spanish tapas are always a little expensive, so its prolly not a regular dinner out place but i would definitely go there again for maybe after dinner drinks and reserve dinner for special occasions. By the way we ordered Prawns, patata bravas, the peppers, and paella. All awesome!!"}
{"text":"Great service. Great food. Server has knowledge on the food and provides great recommendations.  Clean washrooms and good location"}
{"text":"Went there for a birthday party.  Loud and fun though I feel that the food and drinks were way over priced for what you get. I think they are just trying to be trendy and unfortunately it reflects in the whole experience.  I'm not saying that the food was not tasty, just over priced. Tapas are supposed to be appetizers that are cheap so you can keep drinking...and about that, while they do have some tasty cocktails on the menu, the bartender likes to use his ice. My Spanish Manhattan was over flowing with ice cubes. An I'm not exaggerating.. It was literally over flowing. I couldn't take a sip with out the ice spilling from the rocks glass. Oh and $17 plus tax for a weak Manhattan is almost rioting level of pricing.  It's a good place to go if you want to impress someone on a date but I wouldn't go back unless they increased the portions (cocktail liquor content) or they dropped the priced to a reasonable level."}
{"text":"Had a very good experience . Derek is absolutely wonderful, truely takes care of you . My first time at this restaraunt , didn't know what to expect . Tapas were excellent wine was great . Atmosphere a delight. 
Returned many times since and I must say service is always great"}
{"text":"We've been here numerous times. Love the food, atmosphere and staff. Brought friends that had never been and they were equally impressed. Vegetarian paella is wonderful, as are the flatbreads."}
{"text":"Now, the only thing more beautiful than the room is the King West crowd within it.  Yes, like most popular dining establishment on the block, Patria caters to the 25-40 year-old-hot-professional demographic who have high expectations for svelte service.  Well, Kudos to Khabouth for knowing his neighbourhood's demands, and how to deliver them well. The service at Patria is a true pleasure. Our server was energetic, professional, genuine and well versed in every little ingredient in every little dish.  Other service staff members were equally as helpful throughout our night.  For example, any time a manager, server or food runner would pass our table, they would refill our water glasses, inquire about our meals, engage in conversation and replenish plates and cutlery.  There wasn't a single food runner in our line up of tapa-deliveries who didn't come to our table prepared with a thorough dish description and a huge excited smile on their face. Everyone was also aware of our Passover restriction, and whenever substitutions or omissions were made in a dish, they reinforced how the dish was made suitable.

The alcohol menu is fairly substantial and holistically appealing.  With 10 cocktails on offer, the options are unique, yet still very approachable. I like that in addition to the ingredients, the Cocktail Director, Elan Marks, also lists the tasting notes of the drink. I mean doesn't reading something like: \"playful Spanish coffee with subtle hints of cherry- wonderfully rich in flavour\" get you too excited to dwell on the $14 price tag? Smart.  While there are a number of local and international wine offerings, the focus here is on Spanish wines- many of which can be purchased as 3 oz, 5 oz, 375 ml portions so one need not commit to an entire bottle. In addition to a nice Spanish Sauvignon Blanc, and later, a dessert wine (the variety of which I now can't recall), we sampled the Red Sangria (Red Wine, Port, Sweet Vermouth, Spiced Poached Pear Reduction, Cloves, Orange Juice, Pear Nectar, $13), Amor Joven (Tanquerey Gin, Fresh Lemon, Simple syrup, Black Currant Cassis Jam, $13) and The Elyxer (Absolute Elyx Vodka, Lime, Sugar, $14).  The Sangria was just okay, but a bit flat in overall flavour, particularly when tasted next to the other two drinks. The Amor was absolutely my style, deeply sweet with a perfect balance of bright citrus to balance it out.  In contrast, the Elyxer was incredibly tart, almost shockingly so coming right after the Gin based drink, but after a few sips I was able to comfortably settle in. If you like your cocktails sour like I do, then this is the drink for you.

Developed by Executive Chef, Stuart Cameron (Weslodge, Stories, Kultura), and Pastry Chef, Anatasia Mucho, Patria's menu is divided into Small Plates, Cheese, Share Plates, Meat, Rice, Desserts, and Daily Specials.  Although our Passover restrictions meant the paella and crusty sour dough bread were not in our cards, there were more than enough suitable selections to choose from the approximately 40 savoury items. Our server walked me through the best picks and substitutions, and recommended we start with approximately 3 savoury items per person. So with that in mind, between the two of us, we ended up trying:

Selecciones De EmButidos (Iberico Lomo, House Chorizo, Jamon Serrano, $14)

Okay so I know what you're thinking. How is THIS K4P? But, I eat pork every other day, and so Passover for me was no different. Not to mention, if we didn't eat pork OR shellfish OR chametz at Patria, well, I think we would leave pretty hungry. Spanish food is not Kosher food by any stretch of my bacon-loving imagination. Anyways, bread or no bread, this was a tasty first plate of the night. While I found myself searching for a bit more spice in the chorizo, any mild faults were made up for by the delicate texture and lusciously marbeled mouthfeel of the Iberico, and the firm and flavourful bite of the Serrano.

Datiles Con Tocino Iberico (Dates, Iberico Bacon, Manchego, Guindillas, $9)

These were essentially a Spanish version of Devils on Horseback- crispy bacon-wrapped sweet date stuffed with salty cheese, a bright tangy pickled pepper and bathed in a sweet reduction sauce. The flavours were so balanced, and so remarkably addictive, I could have just ordered a couple more platters for the night and left happy- by far, my favourite dish.

Pimientos Rellenos de Buey (Piquillo Peppers, Oxtail, Manchego, $12)

While certainly unable to top what came before, the oxtail meat was sweet and rich and was countered nicely by the delicate smokiness of the pepper and the salty hit of the manchego.

 
Viera Con Migas Y Espuma Manchego (Scallop, Chorizo Migas, Manchego, $15)

As requested, the kitchen was able to do this without the migas for us (breadcrumbs),....."}
{"text":"Being \"worth it\" is really hard to define. I think explains some of the lower ratings here, given many of them are still quite complimentary. Yes Patria is expensive, but to me it was worth it because the experience is everything you want in a restaurant. 

Food was incredible. A couple standouts for me were the fennel salad with manchego cheese, the Ibérico Flank Steak, and the octopus. Extremely tasty. Wine selection was nice and was related to the service. The man serving was just the happiest guy and obviously loved his food. He brought us little samples of wines to try, and we ended up leaving the wine choices in his hands and were never disappointed. Finally, decor and ambiance were on point.

Bringing it all back to value for money... if you're going to eat and drink what you want, the damage will look around $100 a person. Steep, no doubt. Patria is great, you just have to decide if its worth it!"}
{"text":"Meh. Paella was disappointing. Everything else was acceptable, but about 1-2 notches overpriced. $250 dinner for 2 including wine, tax, tip. At half that, it would have been okay. I'm still holding out for an actually good Spanish restaurant in Toronto."}
{"text":"Great food. Awesome ambience. And very friendly and accommodating staff. The tapas menu was a delight. Perfect for an intimate night sharing with friends. The the food and wine flow."}
{"text":"Amazing dinner. Have been with one my husband, as well as with a large group and both experiences were excellent. Wine list is extensive. Share the steak with some tapas and you will enjoy every minute of your experience. Atmosphere is really nice as well."}
{"text":"Came here again with friends and grew to like it once I got over the price tag. Still not a place I would come to often, but I've never had a bad meal here so that says a lot.
The Patria Paella is my go-to, as well as the bacon wrapped dates, and a pitcher of sangria. The mushroom flatbread is also very good, and the desserts are great as always."}
{"text":"Very happy after 2 visits.  Tapa size dishes are very rich so not many are needed to add up to a  satisfying meal.  Flavours pop in your mouth and are made with lots of TLC and finesse.  LOVED Brussels sprouts, Spanish ham wrapped figs, meatballs, chorizo and goat cheese with honey walnuts. Ham and cheese croquets were a standout ! End with a light plate of churros. Nice selection of Spanish beer.  Only downside - Cava is way overpriced. Great vibe and service."}
{"text":"I went on a Sunday night for dinner. They have a nice patio with heating and interesting lighting. 

I enjoyed the small plates of food, but nothing knocked my socks off. I did really enjoy the dates wrapped in bacon, glazed in the gooey, sweet sauce.

Paella was done very well, and used great ingredients, so it's worth the $50 or so. The bottom was artfully burnt for a crispy bottom, aka. soccarat. The \"burnt\" rice was not bitter at all. I had the meat paella, and it was delish. Last time I had a seafood paella, and I definitely prefer the meat one because it just tasted more rich (surprise, surprise). No, but seriously, the seafood in the seafood paella is a bit dull tasting in my opinion. Yes, the flavour of the seafood is seeped into the rice, but I guess I just personally liked the meat one more, because it had more oomph...But they could use less salt in the paellas.

Our main waiter was a bit aggressive, and was also kind of rude when we were about to pay. Generally, the other ones were fine.

Their dessert menu is large and interesting. 

Paella is good to share between three people, or two large-portioned people, if you order a few tapas items.

I wouldn't come here regularly as it wasn't THAT amazing and prices are on the high side, but it's a great place for a date or a fancy dinner."}
{"text":"Great, decor, great atmosphere, and great service. The food, however, fell a little flat.

The servers were very attentive and answered all of my table's questions regarding the stylish yet hugely impractical brunch menu which revealed nothing about the composition of dishes nor explained the essence of each dish.

We ordered many things to share, in addition to each person's own meal item - mine being the Patatas Bravas ($10), which is what I always order as a quality diagnosis for Spanish restaurants. The Sunnyside egg, crushed tomatoes, and aioli were spot on, but unfortunately the potatoes, which were the main show, left me underwhelmed. They were unevenly cooked, and I came across many underdone pieces instead of the creamy center I was hoping to get. The crispness could have been turned up a couple notches as well.

The Tosta de Huevo de Cordoniz con Morcilla ($14), basically a fried quail egg omelet with on top of a slab of crusty bread that's been piled high with a cheesy, nutty Morcilla sausage ragout and finished with a zesty pickled pepper gastrique was very good. The saturatex bread on the bottom in particular, became my highlight of the dish.

As for the shared bits, we ordered a mixed charcuterie ($16) with four types of cured meats from which the salchichon was definitely the most memorable with its mild dairy sweetness and buttery distribution of visible fat. 

We also ordered cheeses, the D.O. Murcia am Vino ($9), a goat cheese soaked for 75 days in Murcian wine, as well as the Idiazabal ($9), a more mature cheese described as nutty and buttery. Both came with two tiny slices of really delicious bread toasted and dressed lightly in olive oil and sea salt. The D.O.Murcia, in my opinion was more special due to its notes of wild honey and firm yet smooth and creamy texture; the Idiazabal reminded too much of Romano.

In summary, a great place if you're really trying to impress a friend who likes the old world rustic appeal of things and doesn't have too much of an appetite. And definitely don't bring your brother here."}
{"text":"Had a couple of tapas, sangria and desserts. I can't decide at this point if the desserts were more delicious than the tapas so I'm going to say everything was fabulous. Service was friendly and efficient. Ambience and decor was casual yet elegant. Only setback for me is I dislike having to travel far and climb stairs to go the restroom.  Definitely going back for dinner instead of after dinner so that I can try their paella."}
{"text":"I think almost all the plates in this place are for groups so if you gonna bring at least one more with you this place is automatically better :) 

I went there alone twice, and you can see all the options for one in my pictures

the food is good and not expensive, the service is great, the place looks nice, you have everything you need, bring a friend, share and enjoy."}
{"text":"With modern and engaging decor, a varied menu, excellent wine choices, and a trendy neighbourhood, I find this to be a great place to enjoy some Spanish inspired fare. I mostly ate the tapas and thought they were above average of what I've tried in Toronto before. The patatas bravas with an egg on top are an interesting take on this simple dish! Try it."}
{"text":"Great service.  We sat on the patio which was lovely.  We shared the octopus and the stuffed oxtail peppers which were fantastic.  As a main, we ordered the carne paella - very good.  Although pricey, my husband enjoyed the cocktails.  Overall, really great meal."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed Patria. Sat on the patio as it was still nice to sit outside - heaters were on to ensure we were warm. Had a few tapas to share with friends (which were amazing) and decided to get the paella to share. Great idea as it tasted great! And dessert... So good! Churros were to die for! Our server was great - suggested the perfect amount of food!"}
{"text":"This place sucks 
Last night was my third time there and another big regret . It was a bday party dinner otherwise I wouldn't waste my time and money !!!!
Food was awful again . Place was super hot to the point we couldn't eat out dinner . Asked 4 times for a desert which we already paid and they ever bring it to us !!!! How f.ed up is that 
And obviously a huge none sense bill. 
Such a big ripoff"}
{"text":"ordered 8 menu items for 2 pple. 

sangria was 7/10
secreto was great. 
high quality, creative tapas. 

would return."}
{"text":"I love this spot! Decor and ambiance is cozy and intimate (not to mention the crazy comfortable benches). The service was really good, my glass of Spanish wine hit the spot on such a cold evening and the food here is crazy delicious! I came with 2 others and ordered many small plates...almost everything I tasted I wanted to re-order and will when I return, along with some new choices as well! Dessert was impressive in presentation, taste and creativity! A perfect evening at Patria!"}
{"text":"Unexpectedly nice brunch spot. The space is large and they weren't very busy, but it's on the pricier side. The dishes were small but tasty."}
{"text":"Delicious tapas/style small plates and incredibly cool atmosphere. Some dishes good / some great. Friendly unpretentious service."}
{"text":"Came here today for brunch and was definitely impressed. Very nice server, tasty food and beautiful atmosphere. I highly recommend it and will come back again to try their dinner!"}
{"text":"4/5! Highly recommend this place for tapas. We went 1.5 hours before the showing of Book of Mormon and the staff kindly accommodated our request to bring out the food ASAP. The fried goat cheese, Charcuterie plate and kale salad were all great! We would definitely go back for the paella. As for drinks- the red sangria is a must try :)"}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant a number of times and it never disappoints both in terms of food, service and ambiance. Dates with bacon, chickpea stew and paellas are consistently excellent. The service is always prompt and pleasant. Décor is well thought-through and the ambiance is suitable for a data night where you can have a conversation without yelling at your partner."}
{"text":"Excellent service was the icing on a very delicious cake. Our server, Devin was a delight. Very thoughtful, very attentive and very knowledgable. I would go back for the service alone.

The food: It was delicious with only one (tiny) issue. We had the tomato bread (because you have to) with the Ham Platter (Seleccion de embutidos) which included Iberico ham, Serrano and a spicy salami - which was amazeballs. Totally brought back memories of Barcelona tapas bars.

I also can't say enough about the 'Pimientos Rellenos de buey' (Piquillo peppers stuffed with braised oxtail and Manchego cheese) - rich, decadent, delicious and perfectly paired with the wine we were drinking. The wine was from the Ribera Del Duero region, called 'Avaniel' - highly recommended.

We also had their Fideo pasta special - with  shrimp, summer vegetables, soffrito 'sauce' and aioli. It was delicious - except that the shrimp were a tad overcooked (sorry Chef!). They could have stood to be cooked about a minute or two less than they were (or maybe it was a heat lamp issue).

It's easy to pick on a tiny flaw because the overall experience was just so great. I would definitely go back, and often."}
{"text":"Made reservations a few months ago for Valentine's Day on Open Table, but the restaurant cancelled our reservations today, at 4am on Valentine's Day through email.

Called the restaurant to inquire why, and they said they tried to call 3 times over the last 2 weeks for a credit card number.  However, I never had a received or missed call from an unknown number over that time period.  Also confirmed that they had the right phone number.

Now they have no tables available and I'm left out in the cold.  He said, she said thing so take it for what it's worth, but I'm pretty annoyed and definitely not impressed."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere; definitely on the pricey side but the food is up there in quality as well. I recommend asking the servers what the popular items are if you're not familiar with Spanish cuisine. The pallela is A++"}
{"text":"Patria is one of my favourite places in the city. Having just toured Spain, this is the real deal. I have never had a bad meal here - nor a bad drink! Things I always order:

1) Blistered Peppers
2) Manchego Cheese
3) Chorizo
4) Croquettas

I don't typically like Sangria (why over a glass of great wine), but theirs is incredible. Nothing like it in Toronto.

Great ambience - fantastic sever - incredible food."}
{"text":"Really? WAY over priced and mediocre food. If you think you're a shooter then enjoy. If not, then there are way better places within a 5 minute walk."}
{"text":"The entrance to Patria is whimsically hidden from direct view off King Street, marked by a rather ornate gate next to Patagonia. We went to Patria to celebrate a birthday, ordering the paella (definitely large enough to share), octopus, and a pitcher of Sangria. The food here is delicious, and a breath of fresh air from the abundance of pubs nearby. Service was kind and unobtrusive, and the atmosphere is exceedingly romantic and marked by towering portraits and Spanish textiles. It was too cold to visit the outdoor patio, but it also looked beautiful. As a more expensive dining option, Patria was a great experience and lacking some of the pretence of other fancy establishments around the area. Would love to return."}
{"text":"This is the absolute best Spanish food I've had, with a resonable bill. I went with my parents last Friday for dinner (definitely reserve if you go), and we loved it!

Our server is very attentive and helpful, and very knowledgeable about their food. We ordered a pitcher of red sangria, the Jamon platter, two veggie tapas, and the Paella Patria. If you would like to have Paella, let them know first thing, because it takes a long time to make. The food is AMAZING.

The ambience is great, and there are a bunch of assistant servers to make sure empty plates are removed, and new dishes are timely served.

I would've loved to have dessert, but by the end we were all so full we couldn't have any. Overall, the portion is just right for us 3, who prefer to share entrees when at normal western restaurants. The bill is around $50 per person plus tips, which is not bad at all considering the service and ambience. I would definitely go back again. I would also recommend for dates. :)"}
{"text":"Newly opened Patria is one of the best kept secrets along the bustling King West Strip.  It's completely hidden off King street, down the alley way next to Weslodge, and you discover this new open concept Spanish restaurant from the brains behind the aforementioned Weslodge -Hanif Harji and Charles Khabouth. 
I predict this to be one of the new Toronto hot spots, as it was only a week since it's opening and the energy was buzzing in the air of this restaurant and as the hour got later, beautiful people were flocking in to have a cocktail or to wait patiently for their turn to dine!
The service was on spot and made us feel very welcome.  I was quite happy to find that they had many varieties of cava by the glass and we sampled most of every one over the course of our dinner, getting tipsier by the glass!  We ended our evening with a sampling of their sangria - and wow, was it strong and put us both over our edges from nicely buzzed to a little drunky!
The menu is simple and rustic Spanish tapas, raciones (sharing plates) and full mains. 
We cannot resist and order an array of delicious tapas including: 
- a charcuterie plate with spanish chorizo, jamon, and other deliciously cut meats for us.  One note is that we did have to ask for bread to accompany the plate as it was just served as a meat platter for us to indulge in
- we needed to try a cheese and initially we were going to order our favourite spanish sheep's milk cheese, manchego but the menu is full of manchego options so we opted to try a drunken sheep's milk cheese and it was a huge hit. 
- the Spanish octopus was out of this world- tender little bits of octopus served on a crostini.  They were perfectly cooked and a huge stand out. 
- we also attempted the sardines, although we were not huge fans of sardines due to their fishiness but the freshness and plump juiciness of the sardines made this dish enjoyable  
Another thing to note is they import fresh produce and seafood from Spain every 2 days so we were getting as close to authentic Spanish ingredients as possible. 

We were very full at this point and I hope to come back and try their gorgeous servings of paella as they looked and smelled simply delectable.  

Instead we opted for smaller sharing plates like their manchego and leek croquettes which were soft pillows of creamy decadence.  Another must try!
We ended the eve with Leche Frita con Helado de azafran which is battered milk - sounds weird but was an amazing dessert.  The churros were also a huge hit and are always a must have!

Finally our server came over with a nicely wrapped bread loaf for us to take with us home.  He spoke to us about how they would like to promote their baker and the fresh bread he bakes.  I believe this bread will be sold in the next few weeks in their retail space but we were very lucky to take some delicious olive and nut infused bread home with us and was thoroughly enjoyed the next few days in my household!
It was an outstanding evening and I would recommend coming back for dinner with a big group so you can actually share the heaping portion of paella or a nice intimate date spot to share smaller plates of tapas."}
{"text":"Friendly knowledgeable staff,good food & atmosphere.
Jam on is as authentic as it gets,ordered the 24month dish,it was obviously freshly shaved and served.
Portions are all appetizer size.
Octopus was cooked just right,the waiter suggested Spanish wine,find it great value for $."}
{"text":"This is a combined review for a brunch (4/5) and dinner (2/5) experiences at Patria.

Brunch was great,e verything was tasty, service was attentionate. Would highly recommend.

The dinner experience was flawed. All plates lacked taste. The desserts were great, though. Service was very average. 

There are tons of great restaurants to dine to in TO, I'd suggest you go somewhere else for a dinner."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurants a few times. Be careful with the waiters. The first time we went we weren't sure what to get. The waited was so nice and helpful. We trued paell which was pretty good for the four of use since we also got three appetizers. The Runca was also great. The amount of food our waiter recommended for us was just perfect. 

The second time we went there was 8 of us and we decided to do the same thing and asked our waiter to help us ordering food. He was horrible. He literally brought whatever was left in the kitchen. It was too much food and we ended up paying a lot($700) for food and a few drinks. 

Overall the place is very nice specially the patio. The service is also fast."}
{"text":"Patria as a restaurant is average.  Two reasons: First it is not Spain and some times the food can be good... sometimes.  The chef is not Spanish.  I believe she was trained in Spanish Cuisine, but there are some important details on her training that are missing.
The restaurant itself is BEAUTIFUL, really beautiful, the bar, the decor in general... 
The food is ok, I recommend the paellas, and from the tapas the croquetas.  For dessert the churros are excellent...
People go to Patria because of the ambiance, people go to drink.   After 10 pm is vibrant, a happy atmosphere full of of young and attractive people that go more for a a drink and experience than for the food.
The service gets 1.5 stars... It needs to improve A LOT, from the hostess to the servers, and the person that helps with the wine needs to be more communicative. Management is average like everything else."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. But, the portions are too small and the food quality is too average for the high price."}
{"text":"I went to Patria after work with a friend for drinks and dinner. We ordered the bacon-wrapped dates, manchego croquettes, patatas bravas and the grilled octopus. 

I would have to say the grilled octopus was my favourite. It was a simple dish that consisted of grilled octopus drizzled with a bit of olive oil and topped of with paprika. It was a perfect combination of fresh and simple ingredients which made it a great dish. 

The bacon wrapped dates were also to die for. It just the right mix of sweet and salty. 

This is great place to go for drinks and apps. Next time I come back, I will definitely try the paella as it looked delicious!"}
{"text":"Simply the best Spanish cuisine in town!
Great food, excellent atmosphere! Friendly staff!

Strongly recommend this place!
But make sure you make reservations"}
{"text":"Amazing service! Such friendly and attentive wait staff. Our water and wine glasses were not once completely emptied as our server was continuously coming around to make sure that they were full. The ambience and atmosphere is trendy and upscale without being pretentious and the food is incredible. Had such a great experience and will definitely be back to try another paella dish."}
{"text":"Like any tapas place, better with a group.  Came mid-week with a group of five guys and we all walked away satisfied.  Excellent vibe in the high ceilinged space.  Instead of trying to come to consensus, we simply asked the waiter to put a series of dishes together for us, and we were not disappointed. After rolling out a variety of charcuterie, cheeses, bacon wrapped dates, bouquerones and croquetas, we finished with the fire-roasted rib eye, which was sliced for easy sharing.  Need to return and try one of the paellas."}
{"text":"Beautifully decorated spot right on the swirl of King/Spadina without the business of the street restaurant. We sat on the patio, which is quite large and we're never bothered by any noise. Service was excellent with multiple waiters coming to check in or deliver our food/clean up the table. Dishes came as they were ready at a steady pace. Staff do not rush you off the door once you are done eating. Food was absolutely delicious and full of flavor! Between the 2 or us we had the Aguacate Salad (7 out of 10), patatas bravas (7out of 10), tartar de carne (8 out of 10) and albondigas (9 out of 10). You will note that portions are quite small but they are very rich and filling. We were absolutely full after 3 dishes! The only downside for me - their feature cocktails are quite pricey - $15-20 for their size. Overall - one of the best spots on King right now for me - enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great starters, awesome wine! but the Paella was a disaster and shocking to anyone who has been in Spain."}
{"text":"wow what a beautiful place. I passed by the gate twice as it is very obscure. Once you get inside though you are transported... to not sure where, but I like it. It's coppery, hip, and I love the wall deco. What do you call it? It's like a giant needle work. The food we shared were pretty good, sampled probably 12 dishes or more ending with seafood paella, and they were all decent. The bill came to about 60 per person for 6 people. I was full. Tapas run from $11, $12 so they are not cheap! Expect to open your wallet..."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times over the past couple of years for dinner and brunch. Having tried many items on both menus, here are my top recommendations:

Datiles ($10) - if you like sweet and savoury things, this is perfect for you. The sweetness of the dates offsets the savoury bacon and manchego, and the spicy kick from the pepper is nice. It come with 5 dates. I order this every single time. 

Paella Patria (small $30/large $55) - make sure you put in your paella order right when you're seated as it takes 45min to make. While their paella is good and contains a good ratio of seafood to rice, I do find them kind of small, especially for the price. I've typically shared a large paella between 4-5 people, and a small between 3 people, and ordered a few more dishes to share.

Huevo de pato y pisto ($13) - This is easily the most reasonably priced dish at this place and worth the price, but only available at brunch. It's essentially a scramble of peppers, cheese, and chorizo, topped with an over easy duck egg, served with a side of bread. Their bread is cut thick and is so fresh and soft. The yolk mixes very well with the flavourful scramble, and compliments the bread. 

Red sangria ($35 for a jug) - I usually don't like red sangria as much as white sangria, but I really enjoyed this one. Very refreshing and not too sweet.

Many of the smaller dishes, such as the bread, croquettes and empanadas, come with 2 pieces only, but they can add a third for a proportional cost if you're sharing between 3 people. They kindly waived the minimum spend and set menus for me when I had my birthday dinner there with 12 people. I've had mixed experience with service there. Service was surprisingly slow at brunch, even though there were about 4 tables seated only. This was after the waitress condescendingly told me it was unnecessary to order the paella first as the 45min wait at dinner is because it's much busier then. Still ended up waiting that long for the paella to arrive anyway so I wasn't pleased... Overall their food quality is consistently good but I find it to be a tad expensive for the portion sizes. I like the ambiance of the restaurant so I would still recommend this place for a nicer group dinner or date night."}
{"text":"I came here on a Wednesday night with my boyfriend and one of my closest friends to celebrate my birthday after having been wanting to try this place for a while. I thought that the place looked very pretty and I really liked the ambiance, but my overall experience in there was just so so. The server was nice, but she wasn't too great with the little details, such as refilling our water. On top of that, my boyfriend and my friend told me that they had to ask her twice to write \"Happy Birthday\" onto the dessert that we ordered (and had to order more desserts for her to get the second chance to write that for them) because she forgot to do so the first time.  On top of that, they take a fairly long time to prepare the food, even though we made sure to order our paella first because it usually takes a while.

The three of us shared a few appetizers: croquetas de manchego, datiles con tocino iberico, and the patatas braves con huevos fritos. They were not bad, but definitely nothing extraordinary. I didn't like the patatas braves con huevos fritos too much, was hard and bland in my opinion. The paella patria was dry and a bit too salty for us, and all of us felt that the mussels tasted questionable - a bit too fishy in general. For dessert, we ordered flores con miel and the fried milk with the saffron ice cream, which was just meh, but the flores con miel was so delicious that we just had to order another one. That dish definitely saved our experience, I will go back again just to get that.

In the end, our meal costed about $45 a person, and I can think of many other places I can go to with that budget, that have much tastier food than Patria."}
{"text":"I had a beautiful dinner at Patria last night. The service was outstanding - our waiter was attentive and also very conscientious about accommodating my food allergies. Other than the flatbreads and fried small plates, they were able to make anything gluten free! We started off with bacon wrapped dates stuffed with manchego cheese, the butter lettuce and endive salads and the peri peri shrimp, following which we had a large seafood paella. Needless to say I was left speechless. This was the perfect amount of food for 3 of us. The waiter also brought over a mouthwatering hazelnut mousse with candied rose petals since we were celebrating a birthday. Can't wait to go back. Thank you Patria!"}
{"text":"Try the ham!  You will think you are in Spain.  I went on a Thursday night and it was hopping - great for a fun evening out with friends.  Excellent, knowledgeable service, lively atmosphere, good food.  Definitely the current hot spot for the business crowd."}
{"text":"Hidden under a residential building next to the bright yellow doors of neighbouring Westlodge, Patria holds true to the saying 'good things are hard to find'.  In fact if you aren't paying attention while walking along King, you just might miss it!  Upon entry into the restaurant it doesn't take one long to realize that Patria is truly a hidden gem.  From the marble bar, beautiful gold framed paintings in the lounge, to the cross-stitch art installation on the wall by the stairs - it seems that every detail was considered in its creation, as the restaurant is absolutely stunning!

The restaurant and bar area exude a vibrant ambiance, as the place is always lively. I definitely recommend making reservations in advance, in order to avoid any dissapointment, as I truly believe that Patria is a must try for everyone in this city!

Patria is a modern take on traditional spanish tapas.  As the restaurant encourages the sharing of dishes...as it is a tapas restaurant after all....our party dined on the 'paella del Patria' (made with langostine, shrimp, mussels, cuttlefish, monkfish, snap peas), 'chorizo', 'D.O. Murcia al vino' ('drunken goat cheese' immersed and aged for 75 days in local Murcian wine), 'croquetas jamon (ham croquettes with aioli)', 'ensalada de alcachofas' (salad with shaved fennel, radish, manchego, and artichokes), 'ensalada de aguacate' (salad made with butter lettuce, avocado, goat cheese, and quince dressing), 'calamares frito', and 'churros' (with dulce de lechee) for dessert.  I have to say that the food was all well presented and extremely flavourful!  There was also a wide selection of Spanish wines to accompany its savoury menu - we went with the Emina Rosado and were not disappointed in the least! 

To top it all off, the service was excellent as the staff were all very friendly, fun, and extremely knowledgeable.  It is beyond doubt that the staff really take pride in the restaurant and in what they do.  We had the pleasure of being served by Natasha - she knew the menu inside and out and her recommendations were spot on!  

Patria is definitely a restaurant worth returning to, and I absolutely encourage you to try it for yourselves!"}
{"text":"We came for tapas. I tend to stay away from tapas in general because as delicious as it is, I always find myself leaving hungry unless I spend more than I want to spend. Going in with the mindset that this wasn't going to be a giant meal and more of a tasting, I was able to leave satisfied. The sauce that comes with the empanadas is unreal. 

We ordered four things off the tapas and salad menu at once (not paella which takes a long time), and the first two came out within 10-15 mins and were delicious. I'm not sure why, but there was about a 30-45 minute gap between those two orders and our next two. We had time to spare and I was drunk, so I wasn't too upset. Service was solid overall and they took their time explaining every item we asked about. 

I don't know if I'd return but that's only because I have an appetite beyond comprehension. The food is delicious and the atmosphere both inside the restaurant and on the patio is great."}
{"text":"So, so good. The scallops in their paella are the freshest, most delicious, buttery scallops I've ever eaten. I hear the head chef is known for his ability to study food from any place and recreate it. Decor is wicked too. Anytime I bring people to this place they love it."}
{"text":"I have been to Patria several times. The decor is beautiful, the food is decent and the service is usually good. Last night, however, I went with a friend of mine. Just the two of us, we wanted to order a half litre of wine. We were debating between a couple of $28ish options and asked for the server's opinion. He said \"get the ____ it is absolutely the best choice, you will love it.\" so we said ok. I should have checked if it was one of the options that we were looking at. The bill came and it was close to SEVENTY DOLLARS for a half litre, that was not a generous pour either. We had a glass and a 1/3 each. My dining partner is on maternity leave, so I picked up the bill. I hate this shady, sneaky behaviour. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Went with a large group and everyone seemed to enjoy their time. The food was pretty good just like the service. The venue is lively so I would go back even just for a drink."}
{"text":"LOVED this place! Came here with a group of 4 so got to try a lot of the dishes. We ordered the following:

- patatas bravas (they did an incredible job with these, probably my favorite item, who knew potatoes could be done so well!)
- calamari (it was good but nothing out of the ordinary)
- lettuce, avocado and goats cheese salad 
- leek croquettes
- olives (we had two servings of these but we had to ask the servers to heat them up for us)
- tomato bread ( I forget the actual name)
- octopus (great dish for those who want to try something new)
- acorn fed Spanish ham (the most unique tasting dish we had. The ham actually has a nutty flavor to it, definitely worth trying)
- Cornish hen (tasted delicious and I loved the different textures with the little crispies on it)
- churros (can't go wrong)
- mango sorbet (delightful with little chunks of mango)

Hostesses were a little bit snobby but our waiter was great. He was helpful in choosing dishes and just an overall friendly guy.

A lot of people are mentioning the price, but we thought it was really reasonable considering we ordered some of the pricier items in the menu, had drinks and it came to about $55 per person before tip. 

I would definitely recommend it and can't wait to go here again!"}
{"text":"Went there for dinner with a friend. The place was really nice and kinda fancy. The staff were friendly and the service was good. The food however was average or maybe less. For the salad, I had the Ensalada Remolachia which was good. For the entree, I had the Paella De Pollo which takes 40-45 min to cook. It was below average. I would never order it again. There was nothing special about it and I had a big chunk of garlic in mine which really bothered me later. The place is kinda dark so I couldn't really see what I was eating. And finally for the dessert, I had the Sorbete De Mango Con Polvo De Aceite De Oliva. You would expect a dessert to taste sweet but for some reason this had a bitter aftertaste, so I couldn't finish it, even though the portion was really small. 
It was a Saturday night and the place was packed. Don't go there unless you have a reservation, at least on weekends. Also the entrance was a bit too dark so watch your step when you go in."}
{"text":"Dinner at this Spanish Tapas restaurant that was hidden inside another building. I almost walked into the wrong restaurant. It was not packed yet when we were there but as the night went on, it started to get more and more busy and more noisy. By the end of the night, I was screaming my friend instead of talking. We started off with a red sangria ...

We shared 5 dishes between the two of us. Spanish charcuterie; Chicken croquetas, Fideos pasta w/ clams, chorizo + aioli; bacon wrapped with dates and Octopus w/ potato. They were all unique and interesting taste. My favourite is the bacon wrapped with dates. Honourable mention to the chicken croquetas, it was very tasty and juicy with the chicken inside and crispy on the outside. We were filled but still room for dessert. I really wanted churros but they said it was sold out for the day. Boo! or they were just too lazy to make them. So we settled on the Spanish pastry w/ ice-cream. It was still good and it was light.

It was tapas so it can add up. Not a cheap meal but it was good."}
{"text":"Toronto really knows service. In my opinion they have created a real Spanish tapas experience. Very good paella."}
{"text":"I mentioned to a co-worker that it's really hard to find good paella anywhere outside of Spain, and he recommended Patria on King. The restaurant is slightly difficult to find, it's tucked away from King and not marked, but it's not hard to figure out that the busy restaurant down the alley with the large glass windows is probably the one you are looking for.

I walked in without a reservation and was able to sit at the bar; and, even though I was at the bar, the wait staff were incredibly nice and attentive. As mentioned above, my food experience was with the house paella (Paella Patria), which takes roughly 45-minutes to make. When paella is done correctly, and the rice is allowed to naturally settle in a paella pan, the taste and texture are phenomenal. It's hard to find places where the chefs are patient enough to cook paella right. In this case, it was worth the wait and the dish is big enough to feed two people.

There are a couple of minuses: the restaurant is very loud and busy... difficult for conversations. And, I almost feel petty for mentioning this but the women's bathroom was rather unkept and a wet, papery mess."}
{"text":"Phenomenal. The Cornish hen and ham paella was out of this world! The best rice dish I've ever had in my life. From the caramelized tomatoes to the green beans to the pan fried rice - everything was absolutely perfect!

Side dishes: pulpo was delicious. Bomba was ok. Fresh bread in olive oil and salt is so good too! Bread is made fresh!

Cocktails: the penicillina was on point!

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Get the cheese dishes! They're the best!! Other tapas are good too but a little overpriced to be honest. Servers were really nice and attentive. Our server was very patient when explaining the menus to us and making recommendations. Really nice decor as well."}
{"text":"Came here on a date night because my boyfriend and I were craving paella and were excited to try it. We'd read many bad reviews, but were willing to give it a chance because there are so few places to get paella in the city and were just in the mood for Spanish food. After the service we experienced and the food that we got, we would never come back.

The Good: The atmosphere was lovely. Perfect set-up for a date spot with wonderful lighting and a romantic ambiance. Totally ready to dig in and ordered several different dishes (the bacon-wrapped dates, assorted meats, the paella, etc.) Until....

The Bad: Yes, I get that they're tapas. Yes, I know that they're small. But there's a difference between little appetizers that leave one's stomach feeling intrigued, excited, satisfied (which many of the other Spanish tapas restaurants we've been to, like Bar Isabel were able to get) and servings that are just plain stingy. Think: a sliver of cheese with one piece of bread on the side, three puny wrapped dates in one small bowl (really greasy and overly sweet), a few slabs of meat poorly arranged on a plate (unseasoned, bland, and tough to chew), etc. Would be worth it if the food was of high quality (to match the prices), but it wasn't.

The Ugly: We came here for the paella, and we were left deeply disappointed. First, when trying to gauge the size of the paella, we asked the server which would be best for two of us to share, as we were both pretty hungry. Knowing what we had ordered previously, he said, \"Hmm, I don't know,\" and continued looking over our shoulder. I asked again, \"Would you recommend the small or large?\" And the server replied, \"Hmm? Oh, small? Okay, yeah, that should be filling for both of you\" and hurried off.  About ten minutes in, we noticed that the table next to us had ordered the small serving of paella and realized that that would not be enough for us. As I hadn't yet seen the server punch in our order, I asked him if it would be possible to change it. He immediately refused, stating, \"NO, the paella is ready to come out now, it's basically done and just waiting for me to drop it off at the table for you.\"  My boyfriend and I both worked in customer service/the restaurant industry before and understand how frustrating it can be for servers when customers change their orders, so of course we were accommodating and agreed to stick with the small serving. 10 minutes later, did the paella arrive? Nah.  How about 15? Nope.  What about 20? No.  Over thirty-five minutes later, our \"ready-to-come-out\" and \"just-waiting-to-be-dropped-off\" paella arrives and the server makes no excuses, just drops it off and disappears again.  We waited over an hour - an hour!- for all of our food in total, despite us asking our server earlier how long it would take (because we were in a bit of a rush) and him assuring us multiple times that it would take \"no longer than 20-30 minutes. 

The bottom line: Inattentive, lousy service. Come here if you'd like mediocre Spanish food in small servings, with a side order of attitude. Otherwise, check out other places in Toronto that genuinely care and are excited about their dishes, like Bar Isabel, etc."}
{"text":"Roadtripping from Montreal (and desperately missing Spain!) we found Patria on a list of top Toronto restaurants and booked an early dinner seating. 

We weren't disappointed. 

After walking by the place and into the Patagonia store next door, we peeked into the alley beside it and found the lovely glass enclosed restaurant. 

We were seated outside on the semi-enclosed patio which was nice on the warm but drizzly day. 

Prepared to re-live our Spanish culinary adventures, we started with a bottle of delicious rosé cava. It arrived perfectly chilled and our waitress kept us constantly refilled.

We ordered a bunch of tapas to share and everything was fantastic and as authentic as we remembered it to be in Spain. 

The cured meats were fresh - both the jamon serrano and the chorizo were delicious. 

The croquetas de jamon were particularly good - so much so that we added a second order of croquetas de manchego which were equally tasty. The albòndigas (lamb meatballs) were also very good. 

We were a little disappointed with our octopus dish which wasn't bad....but wasn't spectacular either. 

For desert we ordered the churros and the chocolate pudding with olive oil and sea salt. The churros were a little dry but the chocolate pudding was phenomenal!
We had first tried chocolate with olive oil in Barcelona and were excited to taste it again - we weren't disappointed. The pudding came served with a \"candy\" filled with olive oil which our waiter broke into the pudding and then mixed it. It was mouthwatering and as good as we remembered it to be. 

The service was excellent and well-paced. 
Our dishes were well spaced out and brought out by a variety of waiters/waitresses who took the time to explain each dish. Our particular favourite was a Spanish waiter who explained the dish with an adorable accent. 

We were seated next to a group of local ladies and had such a great time with them that we ended up sharing food off of each other's plates - in true tapas fashion!"}
{"text":"In general, it was okay.


Was super excited to visit this place as I am a huge spanish food fan, however was let down with the most important dish, the meat Paella. The flavors were there, but the chorizo was cut in TINY pieces, and the rest of the meat (I think it was Pork Belly or Beef Cheek..can't remember) was not worth the $44+. 

In terms of tapas, the gambas were delicious with garlic and a nice herb chimichurri but the Patatas Bravas were not outstanding. Good yes, but the delicious sauce that traditionally goes with it, was not as intense as I remember it. The Charcuterie was okay as well, but some of the meats were most definetely store bought and lacking in flavor.

Cocktails were good and the beer selection was 'Spanish'. Service was also friendly and quick.

Overall though, very average."}
{"text":"This is an amazing restaurant.  Went here with 2 of my girlfriends for a fun girls night out to catch up over dinner and drinks.  It's tapas style so everything is meant for sharing.  The sangria is amazing!  The 3 of us had 4 appetizers and the seafood paella along with 4 pitchers of sangria.  It may seem like a lot but we were there for 6 hours talking and laughing.  We got there at 7pm and didn't leave till 1am  Not once did we feel like we had outstayed our welcome. The vibe was amazing.  The wait staff is very polite.  The food and drinks are expensive but not unusual for King West.  Most of their food is flown in from Spain.  I would definitely go back again!!"}
{"text":"Went here on New Year's Eve & all tables were fully booked. Since 2 weeks ago. So my mom & I, for the sake of enjoying some good food, sucked it up and sat at the bar  - which turned out to be less intimidating than I thought cause the bartender/our server was really friendly (albeit a little too talkative for my liking) and gave us some good tips on ordering etc .

ONTO ZE \"BILL OF FARE\" .

Since my mom has annoying stomach problems and can't handle really acidic foods,  cheese was pretty much out of the picture.

We started with the simple Pan Con Tomate, 2pc for $4. The bread's crust was amazing, the tomatoes tasted fresh and I ain't no olive oil connoisseur so I can't really speak about that. The only thing is the bread was a little too 'holey' so there ended up being a puddle of oil on my plate and the centre too soft so it turned a little mushy.

Then we got our bacon-wrapped dates, Datiles Con Tocino Iberico, 5 pc for $9. 
My mind was blown.
These are SO. DAMN. GOOD. 
First you get the saltiness of the bacon, then the sweetness of the date, and then a little kick from the guindilla (I couldn't distinguish the manchego that well, but it was definitely there). It also comes with a sweet, purple glaze of sorts which made the dish even better. This is a must-get.

The charcuterie plate (Selección De Embutidos, $16) was meh . I was disappointed when it arrived because it was just a regular, round white plate filled with various meats and only meats, no pickles, no bread, nothing. I guess I shouldn't have expected it to be a charcuterie plate when it didn't say it would be, but for that price...
You get 4 slices of Iberico lomo, Iberico chorizo, and Morcon salami, and a small pile of Jamon Serrano. 
The Iberico lomo was the best (according to both me and my mom). Great flavour. The Jamon Serrano came second, melt-in-your mouth ham. The chorizo was alright. The salami wasn't to my liking - then again I don't really like salami in general, lol.

Our last savoury dish was the chickpea spinach stew + migas (Garbanzos Con Espinacas), $8. It was delish. Chickpea came in both mushy, stew-form and soft, whole form. The breadcrumbs were small and crispy and added texture. This dish came with olive oil drizzled on top which I didn't really feel was necessary as the stew was already flavourful and moist, if you will.

All desserts were $7. My mom chose the prettiest one, a deep-fried pastry which came in the shape of a flower with a scoop of ice cream on top, rose petals, small bits of marshmallow and almond, and honey drizzled all over the plate (Flores Con Miel Y Helado De Turrón). The ice cream was great, the pastry was only alright- it actually reminded me of some Asian pastries I ate when I was young. IDR what they actually are though .

The entire meal came to $50 after-tax, not including tip. I don't find this TOO steep, but the portions are really pretty damn small. I guess the ambiance of the restaurant with its numerous paintings and hand-decorated wall, and the quality of the food (our server told us they import everything they can from Spain and make everything else) make up for it. I'd love to go back again and try some different dishes."}
{"text":"Patria is simply amazing. Everything from the decor to the atmosphere to the drinks and food... Perfect. 

We ordered a bunch of tapas, the most memorable being the bacon wrapped dates - to die for.  

Although this place is pricey (we paid 190 for two people) it is worth it."}
{"text":"Great service! I had a reservation and went on a Thursday, and the tables filled pretty quickly.  The food was pretty good and the service was great! 
We had Croquetas de Pollo $9: thin coat of batter and shredded chicken
Patatas bravas cons huevos fritos $9: not too spicy.  The server mixed it for us which was nice. I don't know if I am used to this flavour 
Paella Patria $49: they served this to us as well.  After it heated on the pan it was more crispy.  I really liked this"}
{"text":"Excellent food, service and ambiance! The tapas are truly infused with spanish flavours. 
We had the Octopus, Dates wrapped in Bacon and Figs with Goat Cheese, but if I have to pick a favourite it will be the Foie Gras \"sliders\", they were unbelievably tasty!! 
We had the 'Paella Patria' you could see the saffron, beautifully done. For dessert I ordered the Chocolate pudding, it was sublime, rich, decadent. Infused with olive oil and salt, it couldn't make me happier. Ohh I just can't wait to be back!!"}
{"text":"Over priced and below average portions. The chorizo was the cheapest I have ever had. The service was ok. The wine selection was slim. And 12$ beer was soso. I do not understand the positive reviews. We were a group of 10 and we all felt disappointed."}
{"text":"I've traveled the world. Been all over Spain.
And let me tell you - three times I've been to Patria so far were some of the best dining experiences I've had in Canada.
Awesome ambience, great food. Real tapas style, fantastic for share or date night.
We tried almost everything on the menu and I haven't been disappointed once.
Paella is to die for. And even though it's supposed to be for 2 people, we couldn't finish it when we were 4.
And once when we had space for dessert - churros are simple, but literally to die for...
Yes, it's not cheap. But I am prepared to pay for an excellent food and great service.
Will keep coming back."}
{"text":"Excellent food there and the setting / decor is very enjoyable. Everything was tasty and delicious. It's more of an upscale restaurant so be prepared to pay for the food quality. I had the octopus, the Brussels sprouts bravas, some paella and the jambon bellota, which I all recommend."}
{"text":"First time trying Spanish cuisine in TO, had the : 
House Baked Bread + Fresh Tomato + Olive Oil
24 Month Salt-Cured Jamón Serrano
18 Month D.O. Manchego
Dates + Ibérico Bacon + Manchego + Guindillas
Roasted Cauliflower + Crispy Jamón + Garlic Chips + Almond Sauce
Paella Patria - Bay Scallops + Shrimp + Mussels + Cuttlefish + Monkfish + Snap Peas + Saffron
Polished off with a glass of Tempranillo (first time trying a wine from this region, certainly recommend with the dishes I had). Service was fabulous, but a wee bit too rushed. Could have been more intimate. Nonetheless a 4 overall."}
{"text":"Most of the food here was as superb. Service can be a bit too attentive at times and I appreciated the effort. I would recommend coming here with a party of 4 to 6 given all the items on the menu that I wanted to try. But that's not to say we didn't make it work with just a party of 2. 

My list of tried and must-orders:
Selection De Embutidos (4 different types of cured ham)
Croquetas De Pollo (chicken croquettes)

Desserts:
Churros (Spanish straight donuts)
Flores Con Miel Y Helado De Turron (Spanish flower shaped pastry with almond ice cream)

Wish I had room to try their Paella. I'll be back again to try that."}
{"text":"This place hits the nail on the head every time. The decor and atmosphere is electric and the sangrias are ON POINT!
A perfect environment to enjoy some tapas and drinks with friends.

I recommend the Dátiles, house marinated  olives and the paella patria.
Oh and sangria by the jug!"}
{"text":"Spanish Tapas - Patria is your place for a nice meal out.

Patria is tucked away on King Street West just west of Spadina.  They have a covered patio that should be enjoyed if the weather is still warm out (I think I even saw heaters).

When my friend and I arrived, we were greeted and shown to our table right away.  The waiter graciously explained the menu and how we should order our tapas.  They suggested you should aim to order about 5-7 dishes for 2 people.  Here were our choices:

1) Patatas Bravas Con Huevo - it was like breakfast for dinner, I really liked it
2) Pescado Del Dia En Salsa Verde - the presentation was fancy but the fish was a tad bit over cooked, I liked the salsa verde
3) Leek Croquetas (sp?) - my fav dish of the night, we ended ordering a second serving
4) Stuffed Pepper with Meat Filling (I can not remember the name) - I enjoyed this tapas dish as well

Both my friend and I were stuffed after our dinner, tapas can be misleading.

Service was excellent.  I noticed that most of staff working there spoke spanish or had a bit of spanish flare.  It made the experience very authentic.

I will be back for future meals.  They have an awesome paella dish that I want to try."}
{"text":"It's almost like eating in Spain.. almost... 
Except instead of a small humble eatery full of Spanish locals, 
you have a lavish and swank eatery full of King West suits sharing small plates.

Patria is under the same ownership as Weslodge and similar to Weslodge, this place is jam packed with beautiful people and crazy busy.

I called at 6:00pm realizing that I forgot to make a reservation.
They told me that the earliest reservation was at 9:30 pm.
So, I showed up and I asked if they could accommodate us.
They said that I could have a table for exactly two hours.  
That worked for me.  

The server was attentive and quick with the drink recommendations.
The Amor Joven ($13) is a tanqueray gin cocktail with black currant cassis. 
It was a fantastic choice! 

They also have JUGS of sangria (red or white) for $30 bucks!

As for the food menu, there were so many items to choose from!  
My friend couldn't eat dairy or seafood, but there still lots of options.

The dates wrapped in bacon was one of my favourite dishes.
Simple, salty, sweet, and moist.

The fried potato bits topped with a fried egg ($9) is surprisingly popular, and even though it reminded me a bit of breakfast, it was flavourful and filling.

One of the veggie plates we ordered was the blistered peppers and sea salt.  They got increasingly hot as you ate them.  I stopped when I lost feeling in my mouth.

I ordered the grilled octopus.  Since my friend couldn't eat seafood, this dish was all mine!  It was a large portion and I didn't have any issues scarfing it down.  Perfectly cooked and chewy, one of the highlights of dinner.

As for dessert, we shared the churros.
Honestly, I didn't love the churros.
A bit average and I would have preferred a nicer presentation rather than churros plopped on a plate of dulce de leche sauce.

As we were finishing dessert, we were given the warning glance as we approached the two our seating limit.  I looked up at the restaurant manager and he looked at me.  We exchanged glances, not sexy-face glances, but okay-our-time-together-is-up-time-to-pay-now.

My friend and I left very satisfied with the food and service. 
I won't hesitate to come back here for Spanish style nibbles!"}
{"text":"We visited Patria over the long weekend and the place was hopping right up until close for good reason! The wine, beer and most importantly food were absolutely wonderful. The only downside was that the restaurant was a bit hard to find, as it's not directly on King Street. You need to go up a small walkway. If you have trouble finding the place don't give up cause this hidden gem is worth the extra effort :)"}
{"text":"The service was horrible and the food is definitely over rated. We came here based on Yelp ratings and it was a total disappointment. The sangria they served was watered down tasting almost like a cough syrup. Squid was over cooked, when the waitress came to ask us how the squid was, we told her it was really dry and all she said was:\"oh, I'm sorry to hear that.\"(do something about it!) Paella wasn't tasty at all, taste as if they just boiled it in tomato sauce. I wouldn't recommend this place at all. If you want good paella, go to Carman on Queen street."}
{"text":"Tapas restaurant tucked away on King West. The food wasn't bad but you pay a little bit of a King West premium for sure. I came with a friend and we had a paella, a few tapas and a bottle of white wine. The paella was their house specialty (Paella Patria). It was mostly good but a little bit burnt on the bottom. The tapas were also good and the croquettes in particular were tasty. I'd go back but with a larger group next time to try more things."}
{"text":"This restaurant was amazing!!  Everything from ambiance, food, decor to service was excellent.  The servers and waiters were very attentive and we didn't have any trouble trying to get attention.  We ordered a bunch of items off the special of the day menu including lobster sliders, spanish octopus and asparagus.  The lobster sliders were juicy and flavourful.  The Spanish octopus went really well with the potatoes.  The asparagus was cooked just right.  Off the regular menu we had the fresh tomatoes & olive oil on bread and pasta with clams and chorizo.  Both were equally delicious, the bread was really fresh and the pasta was cooked just right with the right amount of flavour. 
The waiter recommended a pork dish that we didn't get to try so I will definitely go back again to try that and a few other items that looked really good."}
{"text":"Once you're actually able to find the entrance to this place (FYI it's in a recessed alleyway), a two-levelled interior greets you.  Dim lighting shows glimpses of Spanish-style mosaic tiles line the walls, accented by warm redwood everywhere else.  The acoustics of this place reverberate like crazy, so I opted for a quieter meal on the heated and awnings-protected patio.  

Since it's tapas-style, my BFF and I ordered several dishes (sharing is caring):

- Datiles/Bacon wrapped dates: A salty-sweet combo, it was the most balanced iteration I've had thus far of this dish.  It was neither overwhelmingly salty nor sweet; unlike places with super-sweet Medjool dates (blech, IMHO). 

- D.O. Monte Enebro with a teensy rectangle of compressed fig compote and toasted bread with Spanish olive oil: We asked for the rarest cheese on the menu and received this.  It really was unique.  Tastes like a mild blue, creamy, but with none of the bluish-green mold spots you'd typically find.  Covered in an ash crust, the colour was an ombre grey starting from the outside.  Deliciously \"ashy\", if there is such a thing.  The olive oil was heady and much heavier in flavour than your typical olive oil, and the bread was perfectly toasted to a satisfying texture. 

- Fried pig's ear with pickled zucchini from the daily specials: It was a little off-putting to find some ear hairs in there, but c'est la vie.  Crispy on the outside, yielding and soft on the inside.  Very different from the Szechuan, Chinese, or Italian places where I've had it before.  It would make such a perfectly salted snack, why isn't someone making bags of these?  The thinly sliced pickled zucchini provided an excellent foil to the heavy feel of fried foods. 

 -  Foie gras bocadillo: I would describe this as a little baby burger/slider.  Way more awesome here though. The beef patty is replaced with a delectable round of foie gras that's been prepared in the traditional \"towel style\" - a torchon that's been wrapped into a cylinder and cooked to perfection in a hot water bath. Sopped up with bread as not to waste a drop; spot of fig jam in the middle.  Don't forget to swipe it in one of two balsamic vinegar and olive oil reduction dots!  My favourite of the night. 

- Croquetas Jamon/Ham croquettes: The shapes reminded me of teensy hot dogs, but that's where the similarities end.  These breaded and fried cylinders contain a creamy, cheesy, bacon-studded core (bechamel, aioli, and ham).  The aioli squeezed on top only adds to the creaminess inside.  While served as only 3 pieces, they're deceivingly filling. 

- Wood grilled halibut from the daily specials: The only item I kind of regret ordering.  It was tasty - flakey, moist, and fork-tender, but a little expensive considering the fish was the size of half a palm. 

- Pulpo/Grilled octopus: As soon as I spotted the sprawling octopus tentacle perched in the middle of octopus coins/single rounds cut from individual octopus arms) like the arms of a clock, I shouted out HENTAI! (Animated octopus or tentacle porn, for the uninitiated).  'Cause I'm mature. Obviously.  Given a healthy glug of olive oil and a streak of paprika, the orange-red spice swirls in the oil like abstract art.  The octopus was a nice texture.  Totally devoid of the dreaded rubbery overdone-ness, concurrently clear of mushy underdone-ness.  Just pretend these are official words, 'kay? 

Leche frita/fried milk: Imagine 3 small, breaded & fried blocks of creamy tofu without the tofu taste.  The best part of this dish was the saffron ice cream which creates a \"full, round\" mouthful that's difficult to describe.  Umami, maybe?

Chocolate pudding with olive oil: An oval scoop of dark chocolate thick pudding with olive oil, a sprinkling of sea salt, and a long teardrop-shaped olive oil candy on top.  I think this was my BFF's fave.

I thought that all in all, the dishes were well balanced, thoughtful, and over all delicious.  The service was attentive and helpful with suggestions, and seemed particularly fancy as all dishes were described upon delivery and always delivered by two staff (is this a thing?).  This place can get expensive as little dishes add up.  A paella takes 45 minutes to prepare, so if you've got your heart set on trying it, you'd better order it at the beginning.  Prepare to order about 5 plate per person in order to feel full."}
{"text":"Our waitress was amazing. Really friendly and knowledgable. Excellent service from start to finish. The paella was absolutely amazing!!!! We ordered about 7 dishes between the 3 of us, and it was plenty. Definitely worth the price as we all had a wonderful experience! Cannot wait to be back!"}
{"text":"Fine Spanish dining! Love the interiors, the decors and paintings are beautiful. The wine collection is impressive, with fast and friendly customer service. The food was okay...I've had paella before in Miami and thought patria could have done better with the flavours. The concept and presentation of the food was great, but I expected a bit more from this high end place. I would come here again to try different food, and the hash browns with fried egg was amazing."}
{"text":"Great restaurant with an awesome ambiance, our server was fantastic and food was delicious! A group of friends and I went and because it's all tapas style we were able to try a ton of dishes. Some of my top favorites included bombas con salsa bravo (potatoes balls with chorizo and bacon!), coca tufa (flat bread with truffles and mushrooms), paella de viera (paella with scallops, peas, chorizo, etc), Brussels bravas, and for dessert we had an amazing saffron ice cream piece. Overall, I truly enjoyed this place and the staff was kind, patient and super helpful! Would definitely recommend this is as a high end Spanish tapas place in downtown Toronto."}
{"text":"Patria was an interesting restaurant. The first thing I noticed is that the interior is gorgeous and I couldn't help but admire the thread work painting on the wall on the bottom floor where we sat and other details such as the wrought iron entrance way and decorative accents.

We ordered the paella, the rib eye and the octopus.  The best was the rib eye which was fall off the bone tender.  The paella was alright but had an overpowering fishy odor. The octopus I did not like at all.

The waiter was really nice."}
{"text":"I made a reservation for two for a Friday earlier on in the week and there was only 1 time slot available around dinner time. I recommend making reservations early, especially if you're going with a bigger group. We ordered a small paella, 4 sharing plates, and half a bottle of wine  and it was more than enough for the two of us! The most notable dishes were the Tartar de Carne which was so delicious we even heard the table beside our's praising this dish (must try!), and the Patria Paella which is basically a seafood paella. 

What's interesting too is the waiter puts everyone's bottle of wine off to the side so the ice container doesn't take up room on your table. They're very attentive to filling your wine up so that's not an issue. Although this place is a little pricey, the food was really good and I would definitely come here again for another celebration. I think it's a little too pricey for just a casual dinner."}
{"text":"I have been here several times for dinner and unfortunately, am not impressed. The food is average but the prices are very high. There are much better Tapas options in Toronto. the place Is super nice and trendy so if that's all you're going for and willing to drop a lot of $$$ for the convenience of eating in the King west strip, then sure but just know what to expect. 

The brunch was a let down as well. I don't usually need a lot of food in 5e morning, but $35 a person later, I was still hungry and had to go elsewhere for more grub."}
{"text":"Love this place! Perfect location right on King st. Super easy from the trolley cars. If you drive, parking might not be so easy, but there is valet about 2 blocks away that's $15. It's really dark in the restaurant, which makes it pretty romantic. But, it is really loud, so don't expect to be able to have deep conversations with whoever you go with. You'll kind of be yelling across the table. 

The wine list is pretty extensive, and expensive! But they have great wine. The server will tell you you need like 4 dishes per person, but that's way too much! We were a group of 4 and got 7 dishes, and two small paella which was perfect. We got the seafood paella and another one that I don't remember. For Canadians or Europeans the salt level might be good, but for my American pallet, it was not salty enough. So, as rude as i'm sure it was, I asked for salt. It was funny because I don't think this happens much, since it took them like 15 minutes to bring it. And it was loose salt in a little dish. I might start carrying around salt when i'm in Canada just to not bother others :)"}
{"text":"The paella is all it's made up to be and I'm so glad we tried this. The wine selection was also great. Waiters are friendly and know the menu well. I can't find anything to complain about and would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I love tasting menus because you can sit back, just drink and eat without worrying about a thing as the night has been planned and all you have to do is enjoy. I like the culinary adventure that the night will become.

Sandy is one of the best servers I have come by in a very long time; he runs the show.  He takes care of everything. We tell him how much we would like to spend and how hungry we are and he brings us dish after delectable dish as if we were having a tasting menu.  He is also extremely knowledgeable about the wine list, if you're a fan of Spanish wines be sure to ask him.  Even the way he decants the wine is in itself a show, pouring the wine from an arm's length away without one drop hitting the floor.  

We typically spend $200-$300 for this type of experience but I would highly recommend it as the menu can be a bit confusing as there is a lot to choose from. 

I would say Patria is the best spanish tapas spot in the city.  I've been to quite a few including Bar Isabel and in my opinion they don't compare to Patria."}
{"text":"I finally made it to Patria! After spending an exchange in Barcelona and parts of southern Spain, I was desperately missing Espana. So, when Patria opened (touting itself as a proper tapas place, with the appropriate amount of chi-chi ness naturally) I had to go!

I prepared myself by reading all the reviews of this place on Yelp (I know...nerd!). 

Location: I knew it would be hard to find. Thanks to all Yelpers who brought me to Patria on the first try! If you are walking West on King Street, you will pass by Weslodge. Immediately turn right into a darkish alleyway (it's safe, but be careful as cars exit that alleyway as well) and you will see a restaurant that has all glass that is Patria. If you have walked by Patagonia on King Street, you know you have gone too far.

Service. There were some mixed reviews on Yelp. And so, I was going to prepare to receive mixed service as well. If you lower your benchmark, than anything great is always a pleasant surprise. When you first walk in, two ladies stand behind this tiny, tiny desk that acts as the reception. I walked in and stood for a minute while the hostess ignored me. She finally looked up and said a grumpy hi. I wasn't perturbed as I knew this would happen!

However, I am glad to say that the service for the rest of the night was excellent. Our waiter Natasha couldn't have been better! She immediately offered me water and a glass of wine while I was waiting for my girlfriend. She also gave great suggestions for wine pairings. The rest of the evening went so great. I really love Patria, which I didn't think I would. Las comidas, at the end of the day, were excellent. For those of you who know my love of Patatas Bravas, Patria serves it with un huevos frito (fried egg) which is delectable. One waiter offered to break the yolk of the fried egg, and mix it. I got the HOTS just watching the glorious yolk ooze through the potatos. 

My friend and I also had a selection of Iberico cuts, Figs with cheese (YUM!), Olives, a second order of the Patatas Bravas (because I practically ate the first dish myself:D), and the fideo pasta that was oh so yummy. Everything was just delicioso!

I had such a great time at Patria. The service was great. One man in a suit (Daniel), not sure if he was the manager, came over to our table to ask if we had a great time and if everything was okay. Our plates were continually refreshed and empty ones quickly taken away. Natasha ensured that our water cups were always filled! 

I will be back the next time! 

FYI. There is a \"patio\" of sorts right outside the restaurant. There is absolutely no sun. I am thinking it is much nicer to sit inside, but for those who love any patio, Patria has one!

Bathrooms are upstairs. That level also has a long table for a private party, so anyone planning to host una fiesta can have the entire second floor to themselves.

Buen Provecho!"}
{"text":"As you wander down King Street- you might miss the decorative scroll work that is the entrance way to Patria- a wonderful restaurant tucked away behind another building that serves authentic Spanish Tapas in a contemporary, thoughtful environment.

It is here that no detail goes unnoticed . . .from the interesting wall art that frames the wall by the stairs, to the marble bar to the copper accents and even the narrow restrooms with beautiful appointments- this place is a feast for the eyes as well as the stomach.  And it is almost like two restaurants for there is an energy and noise level inside the restaurant that is totally opposite from the serenity that you might find with a table on the patio.

We sat outside and had just a wonderful time.  Our server, Leticia and the manager, David, went out of their way to make sure that everything was just perfect on this visit . . . .and it was.  We started with some of their sangria as well as drinks off their specialty cocktail menu.  We were very happy with Leticia's suggestion of a full bodied wine as we were less familiar with the Spanish choices on the menu . . .so much so that we drank two bottles of it!

The food is tapas and meant for sharing so leave the quantity of how much to order to your servers as they will not steer you wrong.  We ordered what sounded like a lot of food- but it ended up being just perfect.

So on to the food- know that if you want one of the three paella's- they do take 45 minutes to prepare so be sure to order it with your other choices.  We started with the Pan Con Tomate with ham which was really good.  Next up the bacon wrapped dates and the croquettes with manchango cheese . . . also quite good.  One of the specials on the day we were here was the grilled Spanish octopus which was probably my favorite served over a crispy slice of potato.

And then the Paella arrived.  We went with the meat version (there is also a veggie and a seafood version) but all three sounded amazing.  The Paella de carne mixta came with duck, pork rib and chorizo and was rich and decadent.  The rice absorbs the flavors of the meats along with the tomatoes and creates a richness that you can taste the second it goes in your mouth.

As for dessert- we tried some of the more odd sounding choices although the chocolate pudding with sea salt is purported to be their best seller.  Thinking we could get that most places- we chose to go with the fried milk and saffron ice cream (kind of like a deep fried flan) which I really liked although my dining companions didn't like the texture.  Our other choice was a combination of coffee ice cream with black olive marmalade (who comes up with these combinations?) served between slices of a nut wafer.  Certainly one of the most interesting flavor combinations I have had in a while.

A wonderful evening with friends was made even more special with great service, outstanding food and an ambiance that had you second guessing where you were . .the streets of Barcelona, perhaps?

All in all a great choice for a great night out!"}
{"text":"Very good service and decent tapas. We particularly liked the Paella. Its often hard to get the rice perfect in that dish. The server was very good and decanted our wine.

Some of the dishes were pricey for what you get. Like a small plate 4 shrimp for $17. 

Our only complaint is the banquette seating. It was ripped. Not little cracks but giant rips across the seat. Felt kinda dilapidated and uncomfortable. Too bad cause the rest of the restaurant seemed pretty nice."}
{"text":"I so wanted to give this place a five star, but I just couldn't. Nice atmosphere but a bit too dark for me and too loud . Had some Truly Amazing Dishes, some very good dishes and some just good.  We started with three of the cheeses, we had the waitress pick, one was goad, one was sheep and one was the blue cheese, each cheese was very unique and complimented each other the bread choice was perfect.  Next we had the TarTar de Carne.  It was my first time trying Steak TarTar and I really cant imagine it getting much better than this.  Next they brought out the Octopus, it was a bit smokey and good but definitely not something that knocked my socks off, probably would not order it again.  Next they brought out the Lobster Paella, it was by far the best Paella I had in my life. So far at this point,  I'm definitely leaning towards 5 stars.  Then they brought out the Secreto Ibérico (Pork Flank), very Spanish but nothing special.  Once done, we tried the Empanada's these were very good, but missing that special magic to bring it to the next level.  For Desert we tried the Fried Milk and Chocolate Pudding.  You can tell they use quality ingredients and all the desert descriptions looked intriguing (olive oil and sea salt with pudding or dried olive oil).  Presentation as with everything was very good, but they were ultimately just \"good\"  as the portions of the desert weren't very large and we barely ate half.   So based on what we had it could be amazing or just good-very good depending on what you order.  The big question is would I visit them again when I come back to town?  Absolutely,  overall I have zero regrets and would still highly recommend it"}
{"text":"3.5 stars - The food here is good, loved the drinks as well. Nothing too spectacular imo but you can't go wrong with anything on this menu. 3 stars because the furniture, glassware etc is poorly maintained. There were big stains all over the seating, the tables looked worn out and scratched, I had weird marks on my glass (looked like bubblegum)
It was disappointing that a beautiful location like this hasn't been well maintained. It feels like pure laziness and stinginess not to replace, repaint or clean all these things. I'm not even a fussy person. If I go to a cheap takeout place I don't give a damn about the interior. 
But people go to this restaurant to enjoy a nice dinner out and it feels slightly insulting that no one seems to bother to maintain a beautiful location as this."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places on King West to grab a bite and some wine w/ friends. I love the patio in the summertime. Lively atmosphere. Must orders: Bacon-wrapped manchego stuffed dates, Paella Patria. 

Decor: Sexy, big venue, nice washrooms, social date appropriate. 
Service: Great. Friendly wait staff that will recommend dishes."}
{"text":"Their dessert menu is amazing!!! We wanted to order the all 8 of them on the menu. If only the other food wasn't so good as well, we walked out of the place hugging our stomachs! The sangria was also very nice, we ordered both the white and the red. I usually prefer red, but I must say the white was delicious. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Excellent drinks, food, and vibe. The steak tartare was excellent, as was the house-made charcuterie. The paella menu is terrific but I wish I would have chosen differently (went for the carne whereas I was more interested in the mushroom). All other plates were good - very good. The atmosphere was great (restaurant very busy) and didn't seem too overwhelming, or too loud given it's actually quite large. The cocktails were good, with interesting ingredient combinations. Only disappointment was the knowledge of the server who had trouble answering some questions and offered some suggestions that didn't really make sense."}
{"text":"Food was amazing - had their fried calamari (that came with 2 aiolis), Brussel sprouts, and flat bread with proscuitto as appetizers. Then, the mushroom and the seafood patria paella. The seafood paella was very flavourful, moist, and the best dish ordered (would definitely order everytime I go). Lastly, had the chestnut special cake and the chocolate pudding with olive oil and seasalt. The chocolate pudding was rich and went well with the salt. Overall, great experience and would recommend to all who for a taste of Spanish food!"}
{"text":"If you aren't starving and just looking for a great place to grab a good meal and drinks this is a great spot. For about $30 each, my friend and I got 4 dishes (1 small plate, 3 larger plates) and a dessert, which is a decent price considering we were satisfied.

Our server gave us some fantastic recommendations, many of which we already were considering. We ended up getting the bacon-wrapped dates, manchego croquettes, patatas bravas and the octopus special. I would say the bacon-wrapped dates and the octopus were my favourites. If you are getting the octopus (crispy and not at all chewy), I'd order a side of bread because the olive oil is amazing and seems wasteful not to soak it all up mmm.

We also had a made-to-order basque cake that comes topped with cinnamon ice cream. This is one of those simple but amazing desserts because its freshly baked (takes about 15 minutes) and has this amazing buttery crust with a warm moist center. 

Great vibe and love the decor."}
{"text":"We went here in the fall as two couples, and we all loved it, and said that we'd return on our own.

Food and drink: Excellent all around, from the paella de pollo, the croquettes (jamon), the chorizo, and even  the complimentary fried artichokes. (Nice touch: We don't know why it was complimentary, considering that our server had just mentioned it as a special starter that evening, then he proceeded to bring us a dish and said, \"On the house.\" Guess they just liked us? Can't complain about the service!). The suggested wine was also superb.

Service/ambience: Service was prompt, courteous, and friendly from everyone, as expected from a place like this. Our only complaint, not for us but for other clients, was that the lighting was way too dim. We seemed to have scored one of only two or three good tables with adequate lighting directly overhead. We saw several tables of patrons having to use their cell phone light to read their menu.

Our friends were so pleased that we had chosen this restaurant. When an establishment gets it right and makes you look good, it has done its job.

Can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"Went there for a date night, and they have a great patio for couples. The waiter that helped us was extremely helpful. We were just there to try out a few drinks and a few dishes, as we had already eaten a bit before going. He recommended some of the most amazing tapas I've ever had and the drinks....on the expensive side but very very worth it (trust me, try the gin fiesta and the mucho gusto). Will return soon for a bigger meal!"}
{"text":"Absolutely outstanding! We ordered a flatbread, a fried goat cheese, a mushroom paella, and a cauliflower side. Everything was beyond delicious. I'm having trouble choosing a favourite, because it was all so good, but I would especially recommend the mushroom paella. 

In addition, the service was friendly and helpful. They explained menu items to us, brought out items promptly, refilled our water immediately. One of the best meals I've ever had!"}
{"text":"We had reservations here for 10pm on Valentin's day, when we went in after a few minutes we realized a friend is sick and we might have to leave, the manager was very understanding and nice.
We ended up staying and I'm so glad we did, the food is Incredible and the service was excellent. Our sever was Jordan and he made great suggestions and answered all our questions. Everything we got was amazing, I can't wait to go back and try different things on the menu. We were a table of eight and every single person was satisfied with their meal. Will return soon."}
{"text":"My last visit at Patria overall was really good. The food and atmosphere was fantastic and the service was decent in terms.

Overview of the food on my last visit at Patria:
Pan ConTomate (bread with tomato and olive oil) - the sweetness of the tomatoes really came through and tasted really fresh

Fideos Con Almejas Y Chorizo (Pasta with clams, chorizo, and aioli) - the pasta noodles reminded me of Asian rice noodles, the chorizo had a nice smokey flavour

Secreto Ibérico Con Pimientos De Piquillo Y Mermelada (Pork Flank and Piquillio Pepper Jam) - this was my favorite dish of the evening. The pork was succulent, very tender, had nice charring on the outside and went very well with the sweet pepper jam"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is cramped and loud but the interior decor is tasteful. To access the bathroom you need to go up a large, open staircase within the line of sight of all the patrons in the centre prosterior of the venus. If you're shy, you may feel unforgettable.

The service was wanting. For instance, I really would wish the manager had let me explain why I sent back a dish. It was a complete disaster. I wanted to let her know why it wasn't minimally acceptable. I felt like I was cut off. I also wish the waiter had not merely asked my food limitations as a formality but had actually caught that we ordered a dish with a non-menu-disclosed cream sauce base. I didn't sent that one back but I wish I had.

The food was the true disappointment.

A special of the day was chopped lobster on several small potato disks. The lobster was slightly warm on only at certain points but refrigerator cold in the middle, the potato disks were undercooked and again cold in the centre cooked, and the dish was bland. My companion and I talked about it needing more seasoning such an acid such as lemon, salt, and some green herb(s).

We ordered other dishes but they were also not great. I highly recommend NOT getting the lamb chorizo paella. It greasy, lacking in flavour, and the 2 pieces of lamb were mainly bone/fat where I literally only scraped away a few tiny slivers of meat.

Note: as of today, Patria website's menu seems to be broken. What I see listed online and the menu presented at the restaurant are completely different. Giving daily updates of specials would be a bonus but seems highly unlikely from an establishment where one can't even bring up the dinner menu online. 

On a positive note, I thought their Spanish-only wine selection was broad, complex, and impressive."}
{"text":"I have never been to a spanish tapas restaurant before but I've heard so many great reviews on this one. I just had to try it!

The verdict? I'm a fan! We ordered a bunch of dishes to share including:
Chicken Croquettes - Looks like simple battered pieces of chicken but once you bite into it, you get an explosion of flavor.
Fried potatoes with tomatoe and egg - I was a little weary about having runny egg yolk mixed in with my potatoes, but it worked. 
Cornish hen -  super moist and tender with a rich hoisin flavor.
Meat Paella - My favorite dish of the evening! RICH, sophisticated flavor, tender meat and oh so flavorful. It takes about 1-1.5 hours for them to prepare the Paella but its worth the wait!
Wash it down with some Sangria and you've got a great meal! Portions are small (but I guess it is tapas) so its easy to rack up a huge bill but if you're looking to go on a little food adventure with friends, or just enjoy a nice night out, I do recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Came here for Sunday brunch with wife & 2 yo boy.  This was my first exposure to non-paella Spanish food.  We are all fans!

I liked that because we had a toddler (I had made note of it in my OpenTable reservation), they gave a table that had a little more privacy as there weren't any other diners close to us.  Service for us was also good.  Great job, Patria!

Beef tartare - Rich & flavourful! One of the best I've ever had.

Empanadas - For $12, a bit steep for their size.  But, they were my wife's favourite.

\"Pasta\" - this was like a vermicelli, but Spanish style.  My son's favourite, and yet, there was enough left over for me to enjoy!

Sandwich - also good."}
{"text":"Not a fan!

Came here late sat night to grab a bite and catch up with a friend.  Attempted to make reservations beforehand, but they told us it was sold out and to just pop by and there might be room at the bar.  So... we arrived around 10:30pm, there was an opening for a table for 2 around the bar area, and the hostess and staff quickly cleared the table for us.

Then our server told us that they no longer serve the paella, as the kitchen closes at 11, and the paella needs 45 mins to cook... I was very disappointed since that's the main reason we came here.  We then proceeded to order a few tapas, but the server did not seem impress, and asked us whether we're eating light.  He then suggested 2 more tapas, which we ordered promptly as we were hungry!  The server asked us if we were going to order a drink, I asked him for a red wine suggestion... and he suggested the most expensive red by the glass (which was horrible and gave me a headache almost immediately)  but didn't take my friend's drink order.  My friend had to stop him from leaving so that she could place her order.  In general, his attitude was rude, short, and a bit dismissive.  Perhaps it was close to the end of his shift, but he did not seem to want us there.  

2 of the tapas arrived promptly, but the remaining 4 dishes took at least another 20 mins to come.  We ordered the cod, as I love the cod both at Lee and Bent (it literally melts in your mouth), so was hoping it'd be of similar quality here.... my dear God was I in for a surprise.  The outside of the cod was over cooked but the inside was cold, pink and raw.  I took a bite into and literally spat it back out.  I saw the server walk by and gave him a nod to indicate I'd like to talk to him.... he had a few plates in his hands, acknowledged my nod, and proceeded to another table to set the table.  He then came by, I told him the cod was raw, and he walked away without saying anything.... and continued to set another the table... I wasn't sure if he heard me or not.... he just walked away!  Moments later (felt like it was a few minutes later, as my friend and I just looked at each other puzzled), after he was done setting another table, he came by our table, took my plate away from me, and again, just walked away without saying anything.  I had no idea what was going on...was he going to re-cook the food? give us another piece? was he angry with me?  I had no idea!

A while later, our server returned, indicating he had spoken to the owner and that we have 2 options: to get another piece of cod or to have the dish removed from our bill.  He definitely did not seem impressed with us.   That we caused additional trouble for him... or perhaps he thought we lied about how poorly cooked the fish was.  I have no idea what was going on in his mind, but either way... it made the whole dining experience very very uncomfortable.

Other dishes:
We also ordered the fideo pasta (FIDEOS CON ALMEJAS Y CHORIZO) , since they didn't serve the paella anymore.  The clams in the pasta were cold and raw.  Not sure if it was meant to be that way or not, but we just decided not to say anything about the dish.  The texture of the pasta was a bit weird - I did not enjoy it.

CROQUETAS DE SETAS - croquette with mushrooms... quite nice!

Empanadas, not bad - very fresh and hot, a bit salty

OREJAS DE CERDO FRITAS - Pig ears - nice and crispy, extremely salty

PIMIENTOS RELLENOS DE BUEY - peppers stuffed with oxtail, extremely salty... to the point where it was almost inedible.

Leche Frita Con Helado De Azafrán - Fried milk with honey ice cream - disgusting... do not order this.  Flavourless and really odd texture

Needless to say, this was a terrible dining experience and we left as soon as we could.  The next morning, I woke up with a stomach ache and a really salty feeling in my mouth.  Most of their tapas were so over-salted, you could not taste the food.  

I was really looking forward to dining at Patria as I had an amazing vacation in Spain and hope to relive some of the culinary experiences I enjoyed there.  I was deeply disappointed and personally, a little insulted by our server.  I will definitely not be returning to this restaurant but hope others have a more positive experience than my friend and I."}
{"text":"We had the Paella, which we ordered as soon as we arrived due to the amount of time it takes to prepare, and then ordered tapas to share while we waited for the Paella. Everything we had was incredibly delicious and full of flavour. 
The Paella is one of the best we have had including those in Spain. 
The service was incredibly good and attentive throughout the meal. Thanks to our waitress Tessa. 
The dessert was wonderful as well. 
We can't wait to return for more. 
Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Had to ask someone where it is...the address is not obvious.  Four of us had dinner there (one vegetarian).  Food was good (nice size portions), waiter was good (and fun), nice bottle of wine."}
{"text":"homeland

The minds behind Patria are not new to the block, Harji and Khabouth (Nyood and Kultura; La Société and Ultra; and Weslodge). But they're not known for kicking out high quality food. I give them this - they know how to create the ultimate environment, one you want to be seen in and one you gravitate towards for its style, grace and precence. Patria is no different. It's a beautiful restaurant with a wonderfully long terrace. It's just north of King Street behind a brick facade. It's hidden (unlike Wesldoge) and the only marker is the wrought iron gate that you'd miss, unless you're looking for it.

Apart from design, they got it so right this time. The Spanish cuisine coming out of their kitchen is banging, right down to the ibérico they're slicing and serving. Iberico is deliciously divine. It's more expensive because it accounts for just 8% of Spanish cured hams.

My favourite duo and I spent some quality time while I was in Toronto, including classing it up at Patria.  I lament not trying the paella, but we weren't that hungry when we went. By all accounts, it seems Patria's paella is worth the $40 and serves about three, or in my case, just me?!?

We did get to try the paraíso naranja, aperol codorníu cava blood orange. $36 for a pitcher, but it was killer good. I recommend that or the sangria...by the pitcher.

Then we snacked on these:

Albóndigas con salsa de tomate-Traditional lamb meatballs tomato mint $12
Dátiles con Tocino ibérico-Dates ibérico bacon manchego guindillas $9
Patatas bravas con huevos fritos-Crispy potato spicy tomato fried egg $9

The meatballs are good, but compared to the other two they became forgettable. 

The dates came highly recommended by our lovable and knowledgeable server. Be warned that service here is hot and cold: the hostess was annoying with a side of pretentious, but our server was warm with a dash of precious. She was also dead right - those dates are a winner. Really, really, really good. A must order. Same thing goes for the patatas bravas. Just get in there and mix and mash it all together. Perfect bites of crunchy, tangy, gooey garlicky greatness.

It's wonderful Spanish tapas made with quality ingredients. They didn't compromise anything this time. Every plate was fabulous - simple ingredients melded to make bold flavours."}
{"text":"We have been to many tapas bars, but this gem had everything we could have hoped for!  Our server was wonderful throughout the meal and made fantastic suggestions! We began with a bottle of Tempranillo ( our server put it in a decanter to aerate it) and ordered accompaniments of stuffed dates with manchego, a dish with oxtail, a fragrant rosemary cheese. After the wine, my husband asked about beer selections (the wine was so delicious that I stayed with it) and we ordered another small plate. 
We normally do dessert, but we did this time and even did after dinner drinks! I got the hot buttered toddy while my husband ordered the cafe grappa-- amazing! The desserts were incredible! 
If you're considering going, stop considering and make the reservation! The ambiance was lovely and romantic. You will have a lovely time!"}
{"text":"My second dinner in toronto and we were NOT disappointed in the slightest. Our server was highly knowledgeable and so lovely. She even tried to talk us out of ordering so much for two... Very genuine and great service. 

We started with the iberico ham wrapped dates. Divine. Perfect mix of salty and sweet which many of the dishes touch on. Then a butter lettuce salad course to cut the sweet and prep us for our next, more heartier courses. We followed that up with the octopus and pork tapas with an out of this world sherry jus sauce. I would have licked the plate!! The octopus was not as good as the one at skin and bones but that was due to a very simple preparation. The seasoning was good but the presentation just didn't overwhelm next to all the other to die for dishes.

We then moved to a small version of the carne paella. Unreal!!!! The rice had that Asian pan like crust on it and the meat a mix of soft, luscious lamb rib, delicious in house made chorizo and iberico with asparagus and peas. So much flavor and a much sexier take on a Spanish classic.

Next up waygu meatballs in a spicy tomato sauce and Brussels sprouts with chorizo. This place is a meat lovers dream. And the tapas allow you to try everything you want which is my kind of spot!

Last was dessert: an upscale take on churros with a melt in your mouth Dulce de Leche caramel dipping sauce (you will want to lick the plate) and a not to miss chocolate pudding with sea salt and olive oil. Sounds odd but it's EPIC. Please take a chance and try this!! You won't be disappointed by this let alone anything here. Can't wait to eat there again. Last day tomorrow and we may grab a pre flight lunch first it was that amazing!!"}
{"text":"I have been really keen to try this place for a while. Having just returned from Spain and suffering from Spanish food withdraw, I was so happy that my girlfriends suggested we head there.

Upon arrival, the decor was absolutely brilliant. I really love the open concept and the lighting fixtures. True elegance. We were a bit early we so hopped up to the bar and had a cocktail. The server there was very sweet and knowledgeable about the cocktails and what to offer.

We definitely utilized the sharing plates and tried a bunch of things. My favourite were the pimentos and Dates + Ibérico Bacon + Manchego + Guindillas. My least favourite dish was the Croquetas De Manchego... Having just had amazing Croquettes in Spain, these ones seemed nothing more than a glorified cheese stick. 

The wine options were excellent and while it won't be my first choice to go back to, I wouldn't pass it up."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner on Friday night with my boyfriend. I would recommend making a reservation given that the unfortunate souls who trickled into to ask for a table were all turned away without one.

Where to begin... the service was amazing without being overbearing. I ordered a half bottle of wine. After pouring my first glass the remainder was tucked away invisibly elsewhere but somehow my glass managed to refill itself over the evening without ever remaining completely empty. I don't know if they have a magical wine hawk whose job it is to survey you as you finish your glass and all you see is a flash of a hand before it's filled again. 

As you leave the table the server even folds your napkin and puts it in place for your return.  The server is more like a wizard and less like a server. 

Food itself was delicious. I gave a five star review because of the overall experience but the food itself is comparable to other good dining in the city. Plates are small. Order everything at once and they will course it for you.

Fried eggplant - delicious smoky flavour and perfectly crispy. A tad on the salty side.

Avocado salad - creamy melty butter lettuce complements avocado and dressing perfectly

Shrimp (special) - fresh tasting, flavourful, pretty presentation (pictured below).

Sirloin - punchy paprika flavour, cooked medium rare to perfection.

Pan con tomate - homey and perfectly satisfying. 

Hazelnut mousse - light & airy with candied rose petals to make you feel supraordinarily decadent and regal. 

Also had a dessert liquer and wine with the meal. Booze was of a Spanish selection so I was not familiar with the varieties - had to google tasting notes (lol) but I was impressed by the offerings. Was on the expensive side.

Dinner for two people with all of the above (plus more) was around two bills before tip."}
{"text":"Yum yum! Great atmosphere and great food. My friends and I made a last minute reservation for 8:45pm on a Friday night. We got there a couple minutes before and our table wasn't ready yet, so the host brought us free champagne!! So nice. We only had to wait about 10 minutes for our table.

When we sat, we placed the order for our paella right away since it takes 45 minutes. We got a large for 3 people plus 2 appetizers and some bread, which was more than enough food. We got the Patria Paella which was delicious and had a lot of seafood.

For appetizers, we got the mushroom croquettes which were AMAZING and super rich, and the brussels bravas, also really good. I don't normally like chorizo which was in the brussels, but it was delicious. 

Our waitress was really nice. We asked to try a wine that was similar to a pinot noir and she brought us two to try, one that was $85 a bottle and one that was $50 a bottle. I really appreciated that because we definitely did not want to spend $85 for a bottle, so it was nice of her to bring a less expensive option.

Also, there was no complimentary bread on the menu but we asked for it and she gave it to us anyways!

Overall, would definitely come back here. Very cute scene and good food."}
{"text":"Service was very good.  We actually sat for a 3 hour brunch from 11am-2pm.  It was spacious, comfortable, and not terribly busy so we had no inclination to leave.  

Steak was full of flavour and cooked perfectly at medium rare.  The peppers were yummy.  We tried one of the flatbreads and it was also very good.  I love poached eggs and these were spot on.  Topped with Serrano ham, Manchego cheese, and asparagus...  Mmm mmm good.  The bread was a little difficult to cut through because it was so crisp but together with the ingredients it tasted great.  

We don't usually have dessert but we tried the churros with dulce de leche and the chocolate mousse with olive oil.  Both were amazing.  Pro tip: Dip the churro into the chocolate mousse for a different flavour.  

The portions are not huge but considering the quality and taste, very fairly priced.  I highly recommend this place for a solid brunch without a crazy lineup or wait."}
{"text":"Overall I would say the dishes are overpriced with regard to its portion and taste.
Great ambiance and decor, although personally I think the setting is too dim (but creates a romantic atmosphere is you are dating sb).
tapas: GAMBAS AL AJILLO $14, 4 large garlic shrimps in parsley sauce, tasty but overly priced. 
Pulpo, I always order octopus dish when I go to Spanish restaurants. Patria offers the classic combo of octopus, potato n paprika $17, the portion was too tiny compared to what I had at Bar Ravel
COCA DE HONGOS, flat bread with mushrooms, black truffle n goat cheese $16, very tasty but I would expect it to be hot, not lukewarm
Paella Patria, was alright, the shellfish did not taste very fresh though.
about $70 per person (tax n tips included) for ordinary spanish dishes, I probably would not return."}
{"text":"Admittedly, it is not a budget meal like in Spain, but the pricing is in line with other \"fine dining\" Spanish restaurants in town.

The decor is lovely, and the location, tucked back from King St, makes it feel intimate and cozy. They have obviously paid a lot of attention to the look and feel of the space, as it feels sophisticated and comfortable at the same time.

The service was friendly and attentive, and our server was knowledgeable about the offerings and helpful in recommending portions suitable for two people with smallish appetites. 
The food was well prepared perfectly with fresh ingredients and nicely presented.
 
We started with the bacon wrapped dates, and they were amazing. To be honest, if we hadn't read previous Yelp reviews that raved about them, we likely would have given them a pass...so glad we didn't...the slight sweetness of the dates vs the salty smokiness of the bacon was perfect.

We decided on the peppers stuffed with oxtail and cheese, and again it was a delightful combination.

We were able to tweak the Paella Patria to accommodate some food allergies, and they simply upped the portions of the other ingredients to compensate. Getting good paella is a challenge (even in Spain), but they did it right so that there was a very slight \"crust\" where the rice met the pan.

In a city replete with restaurants that charge a lot for a mediocre experience, Patria stands out.

It's busy, so reservations are recommended, and if you are looking for a more intimate conversation, the front to the right of the bar is the better bet."}
{"text":"Got a chance to revisit Patria this past weekend, after not having been there since December 2014.

The food was still amazing, this time the stand-out besides the paella was the garlic cauliflower dish.  Red sangria was tasty and plentiful.  Service was excellent; well timed, friendly.  A little odd that I asked for the bill, and he brought the dessert menus...if someone asks for the bill, that's the signal that they're done, even if you want to upsell still.  

Ambiance was a full room, even late on a Friday, and mostly groups of women this time around.  Definitely a special place I am going to remember to visit more often!"}
{"text":"Best tapas this side of Madrid, and we search for tapas places far and wide.  Inside seemed a little pretentious, without reservations we were seated on the patio ( which is quite comfortable this time of year).  Service was excellent, the Tempranillo was a find ($30 at the restaurant, found to $10 retail- we are going to get a case).  The tapas- the sea salt peppers, iberico carne dish, dates and bacon, oxtail filled peppers, meat plate- all excellent.  The portions were a little small even for tapas.  The best restaurant I have tried in a little while..."}
{"text":"Patria is an upscale Spanish restaurant which is located on King Street West and Spadina Ave.  The entrance is right between the Patagonia building and the Condo 478 King Street West. If you see Weslodge Saloon on the right, you will see the Patria gate on the left. I also believe that these two restaurants are owned by the same owner and have the same executive chef 'Stuart Cameron'. I haven't been to Weslodge though. I might try it one day.

We came here today to celebrate my birthday. I asked a few people and decided to follow our Yelp Elite \"Soleil S.\" She gave me many choices and Patria was one of them. Glad I came!

I would suggest anyone making a reservation before coming here. 

AMBIANCE (4/5)
Patria is more about elegance and style. The dining room is impressive. It seems to be either a romantic place for having a sweet date with your loved one or a meeting dinner place for business people. Sometimes, it's quite hard for me to distinguish between these romantic and elegant themes. I love how they decorated the dining room with lights and paintings. The high ceiling also brings out the light and space. It is gorgeous when you look down from the second floor. You can see the whole place and grab very lovely shots up there if you love photography. The washrooms are also on the 2nd floor lol. So eventually, you will get a chance to see the view from 2nd floor.

PRICE (3/5)
Do you like tapas? I do! However, I agree with some reviews that mentioned how expensive Patria is. Some dishes have reasonable prices, and I am ok with them. But some dishes seem overpriced such as the Secreto Iberico or the Shoulder Blade Pork (if I'm not wrong). It is $41. Don't get me wrong! I'm not an expert on meat. Maybe the cost of pork itself already expensive!?  

FOOD ($4/5)
Our server suggested that most of their dishes are small and meant to be shared so we should order 3-4 items per person. So we decide to order 2 Paellas and some small plates for sharing.

Let me start with my most favourite items. All prices shown are the dinner prices.

1) Dátiles (4.75/5). Dates + House Bacon + Manchego + Guindillas ($10). Everyone love bacon? Aww..Yummy! Bacon wrapped dates is the winner of the night. I could eat ten of them but I need my tummy for something else too. ^^ .

2) Croquetas de Jamón (4.25/5). Jamón Serrano + Aioli ($12). I know this item looks very simple. They are fried breadcrumbed rolls filled with mashed potatoes and ham. Could you make it at home? Yes, but tonight I love to enjoy these cutie rolls in my mouth lol. They were very crispy on the outside and creamy on the inside. Simple is best delicious!

3) PULPO (4/5). Spanish Octopus + Potato + Paprika + Olive Oil ($20). Isn't it a habit to order Pulpo whenever you go to a Spanish restaurant? I have no idea. I just know it was always good.

4) Paella Patria (4/5). Seafood Paella ($59 for a large size) comes with Shrimp + Mussels + Calamari + Fish + Snap Peas + Clams + Saffron. The Paella takes about 45 mins to be ready. They have small and large sizes. It is good for sharing.

5) PAELLA DE CARRILLADA (4/5). Pedro Ximénez Braised Beef Cheek + Black Garlic + Bone Marrow + Artichoke ($34 for a small size). I couldn't make a decision which paella was better than the other one between the Seafood Paella and the Beef Cheek Paella. I don't really eat beef.  I can eat everything on the same plate or little pieces of beef if it is mixed with something. But I'm not the fan of beef. I like the rice on the Paella plate though. It was very tasty! Oh My God!

6) PATATAS BRAVAS (3.75/5). Crispy Potato + Spicy Tomato + Fried Egg ($11). It was a very simple dish but it tasted good lol. It came with a fried egg on the top of potatoes and spicy tomato sauce. Then, the runner (a person who served our food) will mix the egg, potatoes and sauce in front of you.

7) BRUSSEL BRAVAS (3/5). Brussel Sprouts + Spicy Tomato + Aioli + Chorizo ($12). I love to eat brussel sprouts whenever I go to a bar or restaurant. It's a good pair with beer, I believe. This dish was a-OK for me but I won't order it again though.

8) COCA TRUFA (3/5). Rapini + Winter Truffle + Fontina + Roasted Garlic ($18). It was crispy but nothing special.

9) SECRETO IBERICO (2.5/5). Ibérico Pork Flank + Piquillo Pepper Jam ($41). I enjoy eating pork, pork hock, pork neck and any pork products. However, the Secreto Iberico wasn't my thing. It was pricey and a small portion.

DRINK ($75)
- BARAHONDA 'CAMPO ARRIBA' ($75). I know nothing about wine but I love this wine lol. Glad that we ordered it!

SERVICE (4/5)
Excellent service. Food was a bit slow. We thought that they forgot our Secreto Iberico because it didn't come till we finished our paellas. So we had to ask our server to check it for us. It came out a short time later but it wasn't worth the wait.

OVERALL (4/5)
Very nice restaurant. I will come back for a special occasion sometimes."}
{"text":"Eating at Patria definitely brought back memories of Spain! Their food is probably the most authentic spanish I've experienced in Toronto. 
The only thing I wasn't sure of was why their paella was so massive! I went with a friend of mine and we couldn't try the paella because it was recommended for parties of 4 and more. 
All in all, I would totally go back to try more. 
The croquets and the short seafood pasta dish were SO good. I wasn't blown away by the potato dish that everyone raves about. They're just fried cubes of potatoes in sauce."}
{"text":"What a great recommendation from a random woman named Diane at the free Elise Legrow concert last night downtown tDot that we stumbled on to so (serendipity) who sent us to Patria.  Thanks stranger.  An insiders tip. Made our day. This place is tucked away so we'd not have seen it.  Wine was great. Food was even better. Would go back in a New York minute."}
{"text":"Patria does up a really lovely Spanish tapas experience.

First up, the place is beautiful. High ceilings, big windows and open space are made cozy with quirky sort of vaguely religious (maybe?) art, good lighting and big candles. The tables are as little or big as your group might want, so this is a good pick for both big parties and a date with someone you're up for hanging with for at least 45 minutes while your paella cooks. 

Service is good- the staff are attentive and understand the menu well; our server made great recommendations for both what to order and around how much to order, which is helpful for lazy people (me) in tapas places with long menus. 

The food n' drink is top notch. We had the dates wrapped in bacon (very good would eat again), something involving a large circle of goat cheese and honey (delicious) and a seafood house paella, which takes awhile but is big enough for two and worth the wait. At this point I was too full for dessert and had had one too many manhattans to stomach anything else sweet, but the options looked promising. 

Recommend!"}
{"text":"I really like the atmosphere at Patria. It is gimmicky and themey, but I LIKE IT!
(I used to say that theme restaurants such as this reminded me of cheesy Las Vegas super-sized restaurants but perhaps I am no longer as cynical...)

Anyway... 
My girlfriends and I had a very nice time at Patria last night.  We ate light as we were going out afterwards. 

We had:

The mixed platter of cured meats - the meats were fantastic, however this dish did not come with crustini which I thought was a bad choice. We had to order the crustini al la carte -- a bit off putting. 

The shaved fennel salad with crispy artichoke -- this was ok. I couldn't really taste the fennel. I would skip this. 

The butter lettuce, avocado and goat cheese salad -- OMG YUM! This is a 5 star dish!

The oxtail - tender, braised meat stuffed in a small red pepper. This was small and tasty. 

The Brocolini - Another winner! This had a nice creamy sauce on the side. and I love Rapini (or \"brocolini\".. whatever)

The crispy potatoes - I only had one potato. My friends loved this dish. It came with a fried egg on top that the server mixed in at the table.


***BTW the salads were large enough for 4 of us to have good sized portions. I am mentioning this because the server recommended 3-4 dishes per person. In my opinion that would be entirely too much food!

I had a martini but my friends who ordered mixed drinks said they found their drinks to be weak. 

There were many meat dishes and paellas that I hope to try on my next visit."}
{"text":"Loved our Sunday night dinner here. It was surprisingly quiet so service was quick and efficient. The flavors reminded us of Spain--and we often struggle to find legit Spanish cuisine. The mushroom croquettes were a definite highlight but also enjoyed the albondigas, patatas bravas, artichoke salad and olives."}
{"text":"I came to Patria on Friday and the food and service were incredible. The waiters tended to all of their customers immediately. When my friend went to the men's room the waiter came over and refolded his fabric napkin. 

So let's talk about the Tapas! The tapas were priced right and were very authentic of Spanish cuisine. This was a nice treat for me since I grew up in Central America.

The waiters were extremely helpful and they were able to adapt most of the dishes to make them gluten and lactose free. 

We ordered a large variety of meats and vegetables. Everything was really good. My favourite dishes were the peppers that were stuffed with carne. I think it is called Pimientos Rellenos De Buey (Piquillo Peppers + Oxtail + Manchego) on the menu and the Coliflor Asada con ayo blanco (Roasted Cauliflower + Crispy Jamón + Garlic Chips + Almond Sauce). They were both delicious. 

I arrived late and we were going to a show so we were unable to try the Parilla's, which are waiter was raving about.

I will definitely have to go back to try other dishes on the menu."}
{"text":"Prior to coming here I'd heard good things but never seen it, mainly because it is hard to spot!  The restaurant is hidden in an alley of an entrance to a condo just west of King and Spadina.  I was excited to try Patria after Bar Isabel set the standard high for Spanish tapas.

The service here is phenomenal.  I was very impressed with our waiter who gave us great suggestions and warned us when he thought we may be ordering too much food.  He knew the menu items and wine list very well.  Every person that stopped by our table including the food runners was knowledgeable and even mixed and served us some food.

We had a number of tapas but the ones that stood out to me were:

-Pan Con Tomate w/ Machego (bread and manchego cheese, a great starter w/ 4 pieces) 
-Ensalada Rosa (A spanish style potato salad with ham) 
-Datiles Con Tocino Iberico (bacon wrapped dates w/ articoke, think sweet, salty and tangy in one bite)
-Fideos Con Almejas Y Chorizo (Fideo pasta is almost like vermicelli, has a strong seafood taste)
-Octopus w/ potato medallions (This was a special and the octopus was cooked to perfection)
-Paella Patria (Very generous serving of seafood paella - huge shrimps and pieces of monkfish.. note that these take 45 min to prepare)

The paella's here were standout.  Patria is not cheap, but you could easily make it reasonable by ordering a Paella and one or two tapas between two or three people.  My only gripe was the blistered peppers.  We were warned that naturally 1 in 5 of these are spicy, but at least three of them in our plate were very hot, to the point my friend felt sick!  Our fault, but I'd skip on these next time.  The wine list is extensive, but I opted for a \"barrel aged wiseguy\" cocktail which is aged rum inspired.  Coincidentally one of my servers favourites, and I definitely recommend it.

The restaurant itself is beautiful inside - large and works great for groups.  If anyone is ever in the mood for spanish fare, I would definitely return.  My only gripe is they don't do lunch!"}
{"text":"Great resto in trendy King St West! I came in on a Friday night the entrance was kinda hard to find. It has like a medieval almost gothic Spanish kinda vibe to it. With their long hanging paintings that one would find in a medieval castle I suppose they evoke images of feudal Spain, the place was also dimly lit. 

The food is delicious and obviously Spanish themed. I had the chorizos with oyster paella with double shots of jack and a coke to wash it down . Delicious!

The crowd was cool and trendy like King St W, only drawback was that the washroom was upstairs. Oh and I had the misfortune of having to come in and dine with my boss and coworkers and pretend like I actually liked them but that is another story."}
{"text":"I was thoroughly disappointed with the experience. As someone who has worked in the hospitality industry I'm pretty laid back when it comes to bad service as I completely understand how tough it is to work in a restaurant. This review is more about the hostess and the manager. We arrived early for a reservation as we heard this place gets quite busy and weren't sitter until an hour after our reservation time. Yup you heard me, 1 hour. We sat at the bar to have a drink as suggested by the hostess and noticed people were being seated before us who came after us. We decided to ask and the hostess said there reservation was before us and stated the same time as ours. We reminded her ours was the same time and came before them hence us our drinks were almost done. Then she said \"oh really, your reservation was before theirs?\" Very sarcastically as we were lying. Then said I will go check and did not come back for a long time. At this point it was 45 minutes after our reservation time. When she finally came back we talked to her about it again, there was no apology and said would get the manager. The manger came and said they offered us a table but we did it want sit there so it was our fault we us to wait so long. We then had to explain that we were never offered any table and noticed people were being sat before us and that was why we even brought this to the attention of the hostess. He then said well sorry your feel that way but we have people who sit at the bar and like being there for longer before being seated at a table that's why we Weren't seated! Whichever as another excuse. I then said so basically next time I shouldn't spend money at the bar as I wouldn't be seated. He then said well we have nothing right now so you will have to wait a bit longer. We did not get sat until 1 hour later. The hostess who sat us did not say a word. Dropped the menus off and walked away. It was a horrible experience. The food was quite good, very small size tapas for the price  but when service is that bad, it just isn't worth it."}
{"text":"Really liked this place. Had a great wine selection and the food was fantastic. Had the sous vide pork flank, was delicious. Ambiance was very nice and staff were great. Would definitely go back if I was local."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I came here on a Saturday 2 weeks ago for our first anniversary. I made reservations over a month in advance which I think ended up being a solid decision. We arrived slightly earlier than 7, but were seated right away as the restaurant had not filled up yet. By the time we left, the entire place was full and was a mad house. We were seated in the center of the restaurant and I was very happy I got a booth seat. 

Our waitress almost instantly came over and introduced herself, poured us water, and took our drink order. My girlfriend had been eyeing out their pitchers of Sangria when we peeked at the menu twice a day, every day the week leading up to this special day. The white sangria is not overly sweet, has great flavors, but is not worth the price they charge for the quantity you get. We were able to fill out goblets (8oz or so) maybe 2-3 times each including ice. Since it was our anniversary, we splurged and eventually ordered a second but this definitely jacked the price of our bill in the end. 

Our waitress advised us prior to ordering our meals that they recommend 5-6 small plates to have a filling meal. We somewhat obliged and ordered 4 small plates, and a large dish to split for our entree. First we received the Palacios Chorizo and the Croquetas De Jamón. The chorizo was a small portion, but was cured meat goodness. The Croquetas we probably our favorite small plate of the meal. Perfectly crispy on the outside, creamy and cheesy on the inside. After we finished the portion of 3 we instantly wished we had about 20 of them lined up in front of us. Our second round of small plates came out shortly after the first round and were the Empanadas De Carne Mixta and a Meatball special they had that night. I honestly was not overly impressed with either. The Empanadas we baked instead of the usual deep fried which was a major bummer. Meatball I have high standards for; these were close to being good, but the sauce and the texture of the meatball fell just short. Finally our entree arrived about 10 minutes after we finished the second round. We agreed on the Paella De Bogavante Y Gambas which fair warning (and the waitress informs you of this as well) takes 45 minutes to an hour to prepare. If you go through the amount of small plates we did, this wait seems insignificant. The was a close second to the Croquetas in my opinion. The lobster and gulf shrimp (served head and shell on) tasted incredibly fresh, and my girlfriend could not stop saying \"I've never had seafood this good!\" The rice itself was very flavorful, but buyer beware; if you go through as many small plates as we did there is NO WAY you will come close to finishing this. Lastly we decided to close our meal with the Churros that I've read so much about. I had casually mentioned to our waitress at the start of the meal that we were there for our anniversary, and surprise surprise, she remembered (see picture). These were also very delicious and we probably could have ate a few more, but then we would have been going over board.

In conclusion, I could only justify giving this place 4 stars. This is 100% due to the cost to portion ratio. All items on this menu are highly over priced compared to the amount of food that you receive, as well as the previously mentioned sangria. Cost aside, this is some of the best service I have ever experienced at a restaurant, and the vast majority of food was on point. I probably will never be back due to the fact that I live in Buffalo, but I will be sure to recommend to a friend that is looking for a place for a special occasion while in Toronto!"}
{"text":"So close to 5 stars! Would definitely come back and recommend to anyone looking for Spanish food. 

Dined with my fiance for her bday with reservation at 530pm. Place gets full super quick.. reservation highly recommended. 

Started with a delish bottle of wine. Good reco from server, she was super knowledgeable about the types of wines. 

Had the house made olives which were amazing. Good portion infused with dill, orange peel, and thyme. 

Next were the cheese croquettes, definite must tries. 

Then came the toast with tomato and manchego cheese (pan con manchego) which was very good as well!

Small Seafood paella(Patria) was good, BUT slightly salty.. thinking it's because the shellfish salt wasn't accounted for fully. Super flavourful though. 

Also got the small paella de Carrillada which is BOMB. definitely order this if you're gonna order one paella. This is the beef cheek one. 

FYI paella takes a while to cook. Like 30+ minutes. Order at the beginning if you're in a rush or ask before you get seated what the deal is. 

Last but not least, finished with the churros..nice touch and super filling, but not crunchy or fluffy enough in my opinion..would probably skip this. 

Cheers!"}
{"text":"Wonderful place to grab tapas and enjoy a really cool atmosphere. 

Only one drawback, our table for 2 was too small, but i added back that star because the wine sommelier was amazing and chose the perfect wine for us.

Every single dish that came out was perfection. I want to move to The 6 so i can eat here all the time. The wine he suggested is one of my new faves now too. 

The decor is great too. I think if you like HUGE plates of food or you are kinda cheap when it comes to food - you should stay away - but if you are into taste and quality and posh decor - you will love it!"}
{"text":"Patria is an upscale tapas restaurant. It's definitely not an authentic tapas bar that you would find in the bustling street of Barcelona, but that's fine by me! Warning though: every swanky restaurant comes with a price tag.  Prepare yourself for an expensive night out, particularly because tapas add up quickly (totally worth it though!).

It's a fun place to dine because it's all about sharing food, tasting a variety of flavours and fighting your friends for the last bite ;) I have a serious obsession with their Datiles (Dates, Bacon, Manchego, Guindillas). You MUST try them!  They are sweet and savory with a hint of heat.  I also recommend the Croquetas de Jamon (with Aioli sauce), Pimientos de Padron (Blistered Peppers with Sea Salt), and the Brussels Bravas (Sprouts, Spicy Tomato, Aioli, Chorizo). Patria is known for their Paella but I prefer to stick to the tapas. If you order Paella keep in mind that it takes 45 mins to cook. Apparently the rice needs to \"rest\" to allow the flavours to blend. 

Patria has a huge selection of Spanish wine. If you're a wino, ask to speak to the in-house sommelier.  I usually do and have always been elated, but last time I was there I trusted our server's recommendation and it was a total disappointment. He suggested a Puerta Del Sol Tempranillo and it was so acidic that I could hardly choke it down. It was an $85 bottle, and I discovered later that it had a market value of 8 euros. Ha! What a rip off! The mark up on wine is outrageous (but I suppose that happens everywhere...).

The Service is fantastic.  They're present when needed (and not overbearing or superficially friendly). And when not needed, they let you eat in peace, discreetly refilling your water like they're Jedi mind readers knowing precisely when your hydrations levels are at risk.

Best to make a reservation in advance, but you can always try your luck as a walk-in. If no tables are available, ask to sit at the bar. Otherwise, you're in King West with a gazillion other restaurants  to choose from ;)

Happy eating!"}
{"text":"I decided to try this place after reading about it on Toronto Life. This place is a little hard to find. I found it by remember the wrought iron fence from their website, but the entrance is a bit hidden so it would be easy to miss.

The service was good and this place was surprisingly busy for a week day. Our waiter was friendly. He was willing to explain everything. 

Overall I would give this place a 3.5 stars. I enjoyed the food, but the prices not so much. The quality of food is fresh and excellent. I would give the food a 4/5. Prices 3/5. The dishes are definitely on the higher end. So be prepared to pay a little bit more for the food.

We ordered the the Pan Con Tomate with Manchego. Which is bread with a tomato sauce and manchego cheese. This was one of my top dishes of the night.

Other dishes that we ordered was the Patatas Bravas, which like the Spanish version of potato hash with a fried egg. This was my least favourite dish. I really enjoyed the Croquetas De Manchego this deep fried dish is the perfect bite of leek and cheese. The batter was nice and crisp; not too oily. Lastly we ordered a meat dish the Iberico Pork flank, which was cooked well and nice and tender and had a nice flavour. I enjoyed the jam the accompanied the pork added a nice element to the dish. For drinks I ordered the red wine sangaria, which was flavourful and had some nice spice notes. 

I think this place is a nice date place. The decor was cool very different and interesting. I liked wall treatments, especially the design on the walls and the knives that run along one of the walls add a really unique element to the place. 

If I come back I would like to try more of their cured meats and cheeses, and the paella dishes."}
{"text":"4/26/2018

This restaurant which has been open for quite a while is still humming. It was quite difficult to book a table a couple of days in advance. Because it was full, the noise level was quite high but not unacceptable.

The service was attentive and on the whole swift. The maitre d' of wine in particular was very knowledgeable and pleasant to deal with.

We started off with the Pan con Manchego and would highly recommend others to do the same.
We then had Gambas, which were excellent and sufficient to share. 
The Ensalada de Alcachofas was a bit of a disappointment because we couldn't find much in the way of artichokes!
The red snapper was beautiful both in the way was cooked and presentation.
The Paella de Patria was a bit of a disappointment, and expensive for what you got.
The Churros were just too tempting.

With two bottles of wine expect to pay around about $150 a head."}
{"text":"Too expensive and the food not that flavourful. Not the best experience. The waitress was super nice and helpful However there was nothing special about the meal. Also the portions Were really tiny"}
{"text":"I wasn't blown away by this place. 

The entrance is a big hidden through the alleyway beside Weslodge. Upon entry, the place was filled with the nice-dressed financial district crowd. It was dimlight, the decor was beautiful and it was loud enough to be lively but not so much that you had to yell across the table. 

We ordered the large seafood paella ($55), chorizo, manchego flatbread and brussel sprouts for 3 people. 

The paella wasn't as big as we thought it would be for $55. I wouldn't say it was anything special. I expected the seafood to be a lot better for that price. The chorizo was the cheapest charcuterie item, but for $8, we expected more than a couple slices of cut up sausage on a plate. We definitely were disappointed by that. The flatbread was a crowd pleaser - probably my favourite dish. The brussel sprouts came with chorizo, which was nice, but I thought they could've been crispier 

As nice as the drinks were, the cocktails ranged from $12-18, which to be honest, I think is pretty overpriced (just like the food). 

I don't have much to complain for since my company paid for this meal, but I wouldn't return if I had to pay for it myself. I think you can definitely get better tasting food for cheaper elsewhere."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! I brought some friends here as a last minute decision without reservations and they were able to seat us at the bar. Finding the place was a little tricky because their door is not right on king street.

Portions are not huge but each dish is absolutely delicious and flavorful. 
Dishes that were memroable: 5/5
Octopus (cooked perfectly and each bite delicious)
Paella Patria (saffron makes the difference)
Churros (I am not a cinnamon fan but this was absolutely delicious)
Flores Con Miel - dessert - I definitely recommend

Good as well 4/5
Dates w/ bacon (I loved the sweetness)
Bombas (Just the right amount of spice)
Empanadas

Still delicious, but not special to me 3/5
Ham Croquettes
Leek Croquettes

2/5 - not my cup of tea
Fried Milk - not gross or anything, just not spectacular compared to the rest

Even the price is not crazy high, it came to around $70 per person which pretty reasonable.  I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"The ambiance is amazingly spot on it feels comfortable and as if it's been here for years. The service is amazing!

The restaurant is tucked back so it's not right there in your face on king but once you get in you feel like you are in a hideaway with amazing food! 

I recommend the cheese and then move on to the steak."}
{"text":"The first to arrive was the Queso Frito, a sharing dish of goat cheese, orange blossom honey, walnut, and figs.  This was a really tasty dish!  The round goat cheese was covered with the orange blossom honey and crispy on its surface.  When K cut through the cheese, there was also some hot goat cheese that oozed out.  It was so good!  The walnuts and figs were a good addition to the dish.  I was really impressed with this cheese dish!

I have had good charcuterie in Spain and the Spanish charcuterie here at Patria sure didn't disappoint.  We ordered the platter, Selección De Embutidos, of ibérico lomo, ibérico chorizo, jamón serrrano, and salchichón.  Within the platter itself, I couldn't distinguish which meat was which but all I know is that it was all really good!  

I enjoyed a glass of Red Sangria.  It had red wine, port, sweet vermouth, Spanish brandy, spiced poached pear reduction cloves, orange juice, and pear nectar.  It was amazing!  One of those really good red sangrias. 

K enjoyed a bottle of Sidra Bere, crisp and refreshing apple cider from the Basque Region of Spain.  I wasn't a huge fan of this rougher tasting apple cider.

Up next, we received our small plate of paella.  The Paella Patria had gulf shrimp, mussels, calamari, fish, snap peas, clams, and saffron.  Mmm, this was an amazing paella!!  It might be one of the best paella dishes I've ever had.  It was so full of flavour and the seafood were all so fresh and plentiful.  It was so good!

We finished off with a meat dish which was the Albondigas, wagyu meatballs with spicy tomato piperade, onion, and manchego.  K really liked the wagyu meatballs!  I thought they were good; the meatballs were very densely packed.

We enjoyed really good and friendly service from our server that night.  He checked us on us periodically and was very upbeat."}
{"text":"Was it horrible? No

.... but I wish I spent the money on a nice piece of steak somewhere else instead of on a bunch of tiny \"tapas meant for sharing\". 

We had a salad, mushroom and cheese croquette, tar tar, seafood paella and churro for dessert. Everything came out hot and timed perfectly one after another. Service was excellent, ambience was nice... but I just can't get over how much these stupid tapas places charge. Sorry."}
{"text":"Little off the beaten track, good atmosphere, classy interior, polite service.
Great tapas, hit some nice Cava too.. not cheap but worth it."}
{"text":"The two of us went for a Thursday night dinner at Patria and overall it was a very positive experience! I made reservations earlier in the day and luckily our schedule was flexible because the only time available was 8:45. If you prefer an earlier dinner, make your reservation more than 8 hours in advance :)

The hostess who greeted us was very friendly and showed us to our table right in the corner of the restaurant beside the kitchen. I enjoyed this spot as it was more private and I got to glance inside the kitchen and observe the variety of plates leaving the pass. Our waitress and all of the servers that we had were all very friendly and offered descriptions of all food delivered to our table.

Their menu is all about sharing so we order four \"share plates\" and one \"meat dish\". The menu is quite comprehensive so I decided not to put too much thought into into it and opted to be adventurous with our order. I was warned that the portions were small but in my opinion they were just right for a tapas-style menu. Our five total dishes were just enough to fill us up but we still decided on having a dessert each, just because :) The food arrived in a timely manner and it was all delicious and presented beautifully. I don't have anything negative to say about the food.

Our meal and one alcoholic drink each ended up costing $145 before tip. I feel as though that was a very fair price however it is a little outside of our normal budget we'll only go again for a special occasion.

Overall, highly recommended. Great for date-night. Dress nicely and be adventurous with what you order!"}
{"text":"Brought a special someone here for her birthday -  The night was perfect! We were greeted by an enthusiastic and friendly hostess. The service was impeccable. Our sever (didn't get her name :() was gracious and attentive without being intrusive. She truly brought a sense of warmth and humbleness which is severely lacking these days - even amongst the best of restaurants. 

For drinks- red wine sangria was refreshing and perfectly complimented their beautiful outdoor patio on a summer evening. 

Food- paella patria was addictive. You could tell this dish was made with love and the chef put his/her heart into this. We also tried the Brussel sprouts and a goat cheese board which were also good. The sourdough bread was on the salty side - but this was easily overlooked.

Overall Patria represents the highest quality of food and service combined with an electric atmosphere."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the ambience and vibe of this restaurant! I had made a reservation and showed up 30 min early and was seated right away.

The service was great, we did not feel rushed and were able to enjoy our meal

In regards to the food, I was really impressed with the appetizers but not so much our main course. We ordered the paella, it was nothing special and not something I would order again. I would return to this restaurant however, I would probably have a different food choice for the main course. 

."}
{"text":"This is one of my absolute favorite restaurants in all of Toronto.  The layout and design is fantastic, with artwork and touches that are beautifully done.  A traditional Spanish tapas style restaurant, you get to try lots of different things and they are nearly all perfect (really).  

I highly recommend you try the Pan con Manchego, the Ibérico De Bellota, the Empanadas and the Croquetas De Jamón to start as share plates. The paellas are amazing and the Fideos Con Almejas is a must have.  We also usually get the Patatas Bravas, which are super tasty and just the right amount of spicy.

This is a great place for a romantic dinner as well as a great spot for big group of friends or co-workers (ask for the big table upstairs on the balcony)."}
{"text":"Having been to Spain earlier this year, I had a craving for Spanish tapas and Patria did not disappoint. Patria is a chic upscale tapas restaurant located on King Street West in Toronto. Great atmosphere. Attentive service. A tad on the pricey but justified by the quality of the food.

While all of the tapas were delicious, there were a few standouts. To start, I would recommend the Pulpo A La Gallegos, featuring Spanish octopus. It was prepared with the octopus sitting on fingerling potatoes. The brussels sprouts with spicy tomatoes, aioli and chorizo was also delicious.

I would also recommend the paella - which is a house specialty.  The paella is served in the traditional way, in a wide, two-handled pan, with a thin layer of bomba rice that tastes like super-concentrated seafood and is just perceptibly caramelized and crunchy wherever it touched the pan. The cuttlefish and langoustines on top taste silky and almost creamy. 

Ensure you leave room for dessert. The fried milk with rose petals ice cream was inspired. We also tried the churros and mousse de avellana - both were excellent as well."}
{"text":"This is a short review because the food is every bit as good as others have said.  Yes, the portions are small for the tapas dishes, but they are incredibly delicious and each one (costing between $8 and $12) was large enough for four people to share and enjoy a couple of mouthfuls.  Order a number of tapas dishes to start and then have a paella.  The large size is lots for four to share, it was delicious, and I loved how our server came to scrape off the part stuck to the pan - I was dying to do that, but wasn't sure if it was proper dining etiquette at such a nice place.

I give it only three stars because the mark-up on the wine is ridiculous, especially the wine served by the glass.  I didn't appreciate it when our server brought a wine that costs $28 for a 5 oz. glass when one of our party asked for \"a glass of red wine\" without consulting the wine list.  I think there's a reason why the restaurant doesn't post its wine list on its website, as it would have made me think twice about spending an evening here, taking our time over the food. The gouging on the wine really detracted from my enjoyment of the excellent food."}
{"text":"Each time I come here I fall in love all over again. Some of my fav dishes are the Paella de la Huerta, Queso Frito and Brussels Bravas. I have also been here for the fixed price New Years Eve dinner for the past two years and it has been amazing both times. HIGHLY recommend. Beautiful restaurant, great service, good drinks and the best food."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if I'd come here starving again - everything is so small (but I suppose that's the genius of tapas). The bacon covered dates are fantastic -- and I wasn't entirely sure how I felt about dates in the first place. We had several of their specials offered that night but I felt they were more on the mediocre side. I loved the wine selection and I tried a glass of the white sangria, which I'd come back for in the summer time. The staff was relatively attentive and friendly but the venue itself was tres cute."}
{"text":"the patatas bravas with the egg were amazing. granted anything you put a fried egg on is pretty wonderful. service was great and the decor was also really nice. earlier in the day we had eaten churros from a street vendor so we passed on the servers recommendation for the churros at patria and instead had the flores con miel and the dulce de leche mousse. unfortunately neither were very exciting and i wish we had gotten the churros..."}
{"text":"I went for a birthday dinner with a large group of 15+ people.  We were required to have a set priced menu, for which we chose the most expensive of three options presented to us.  The food was pretty much all disgusting. No flavour, volumous piles of crap."}
{"text":"Really fantastic service; the staff was very polite and courteous. To be honest, we didn't have a reservation,  but they were able to squeeze us in for four people. otherwise packed at 10.30 Saturday night. 

We had the seafood paella, salad, and the rib eye steak, as well as a jug of white sangria (most of which I drank).  As far as food goes, 9/10, very tasty and much better than a lot of traditional steakhouses. I've had better sangria,  but for Toronto, defiantly on the top. They also gave us a couple deserts on the house because there was a small mistake with the food. Just fantastic. F the diet it was tasty.

Will be coming back."}
{"text":"The service, wine and meal were amazing. The pace of the service allowed us to enjoy the food and our company. Thank you Patria. We definitely will return. In addition, it has been added to the top of our \"recommendations.\""}

{"text":"Went here for a long needed date with my wife, the place is tucked away off King west. The ambiance was just what we needed, modern chic but not overdone or presumptuous like a lot of places on king west in douche bag alley. The food was a twist on traditional Spanish tapas. Portions were small and relatively expensive but the quality was top notch. This is definitely a place to spend a few hours, kick back enjoy the company and savour the food. Recommend!

Drink recommendation: white sangria"}
{"text":"Been here twice in the past few weeks. Loved it both times!!! I always love tapas as I get the courage to try things I wouldn't normally order a full portion of. Some things I loved, some not so much but the food was all well made. The service here is also fantastic. It's great for hanging out with girlfriends or for a date."}
{"text":"Outstanding food and service. I was up for work from NYC and colleagues took me here. Excellent drink and spirits menu. Our waiter was able to gauge the right amount of tapas for the 6 of us at the table and pair the right wine. Everything we had was outstanding and a fantastic experience."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with a group of 7 people for dinner the night of my bachelor party, so please bare in mind I didn't have to pay for anything (lucky me)!

Apparently reservations are a little weird and they couldn't guarantee we'd get in if we arrived after 7, but we managed just fine. 

The atmosphere was very neat; warm but trendy. Everything was nicely designed, and it wasn't too loud or crowded.

They have an extensive list of cocktails, wine and beer, and I enjoyed a delicious cocktail (the name alludes me at the moment). 

It's tapas style and the waiter was really good about letting us know how much food came in each item, and if we'd have enough for the table, as well as making solid recommendations. We all remarked that it was probably the only time any of us had gone for tapas where we didn't either feel like we didn't get enough food, or had way too much. 

Every single item was delicious, but my favourite was probably the corquetas and the bombas con salsa brava.

Again, I didn't pay, so I can't say how affordable things were, but considering it was a trendy King St. restaurant the fact that it was around $50 a head (with cocktails) isn't too bad.

I'd definitely come back, but only for special occasions. That's of course assuming we could get in."}
{"text":"Overly priced and the patella took forever to come. BUT it was delicious! I highly recommend it if time permits. Tapas around the city of become popular, I wouldn't recommend this place unless it was for drinks or of course the patella :-)"}
{"text":"Service is good. Food was alright. Nothing stood out and nothing was bad either. I wouldn't go back but it was a good place to try out once."}
{"text":"Really good... I would say pretty close to the food we ate in Spain.
My friend and I sat outside. Patria has a gorgeous patio with flickering candles and comfy seats. I am still dreaming of the Marcona almonds. 
Sangria was amazing, too. I would go back in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"I came here for weekend brunch with a few friends. The brunch menu is unique in its' offerings and the tapas style is a great departure from the norm eggs-bacon-hash brunch combo. Everything we ordered was delicious. The server was very genuine and friendly. I would definitely come back! My only two downsides to point out: one of my friends is a vegetarian, and the veggie options are not overwhelming. Secondly, it is a bit expensive (although definitely worth it once in a blue!)."}
{"text":"Patria is a Spanish tapas eatery located in Toronto's hip King St West area. It's located down an alleyway right next to Shopper's Drug Mart, you could walk by the signage without even knowing it was there unless you were looking specifically for it. I made reservations for two for a Saturday evening to celebrate Valentines Day.

We were quickly seated and had our coats hung up the staff. We looked through the menu and decided to go with razor clams ($20.00 plus tax) which was a special of the day, pulpo which is essentially a grilled octopus on a bed of roasted potatoes which was also a special of the day ($17.00 plus tax), jamon croquetas ($10.00 plus tax) and the Patria paella which is essentially a seafood paella ($55.00 plus tax for two). I had a pint of Estrella Damm which is a Spanish beer ($9.00 plus tax), since it's a Spanish restaurant, they only offered Spanish beers.

The pulpo ($17.00 plus tax) which was a special of the day was essentially grilled octopus on a bed of roasted potatoes was okay, perfectly cooked, beautiful presentation but a little under seasoned.

The jamon croquetas ($10.00 plus tax) which was croquettes with serrano ham inside lightly drizzled with an aioli sauce. This appetizer was fantastic, perfectly breaded, nice inside and fantastic aioli sauce.

The razor clams ($20.00 plus tax) which was also a special of the day was done really well, perfectly cooked and covered in a cilantro based sauce. It was beautifully presented and the sauce worked really well because it masked the usual fishy smell of razor clams.

The Patria paella ($55.00 plus tax for two) which is essentially a seafood paella was amazing, probably the best you will get in Toronto. It consisted of shrimp, mussels, calamari, fish, snap peas, clams and saffron. The rice was cooked perfectly and flavourful, all the seafood items were also cooked perfectly, an amazing dish overall.

The service was fantastic, your water was always quickly refilled, your dinner napkin was always quickly folded when you left the table, and the server were really helpful guiding you through the menu and letting you know how much food would suffice and not being overbearing.

Overall, Patria is a fantastic Spanish tapas eatery situated in a hip area of Toronto, definitely priced at a higher price point and the portions aren't large and you will probably need to order quite a bit to get full but keep in mind it's tapas. The service and food is fantastic and perfect for first dates, couples night out or dinner with friends before a night out on King St West."}
{"text":"We came here for my birthday which landed on a Tuesday. We also came here around 6 which was perfect because it wasn't that busy. The waiter was super friendly and suggested many dishes for us to try. The portion here is quite small, some dishes may feel like they're not worth the price just because of how small they plate things. Everything we tried was great and I would recommend if you're looking for Spanish tapas."}
{"text":"Probably the best Spanish tapas in the city (not that there are a lot of them - we do have a lot of \"tapas\" joints, but the word is rarely used to refer exclusively to the originating cuisine, hence the qualifier above).

Is it as good as your average or above average tapas bar in Spain, I'd say yes, definitely.  Is it as affordable?, nope, but hey, I'll give these guys a break for having to pay what is probably exorbitant rent for their awesome hidey-hole location.

The service is very good, sometimes a little unnecessarily aloof, but I wouldn't say snooty.  They also seem to have a few genuine Spanish expats working there, which lends itself well to the general feeling that you are getting well-made traditional Spanish tapas.

The clientele is as tolerable as you can have downtown in an upscale dining establishment (think suited corporate douchebag avec requisite skank-ho heaven).

Order the paella early (the veggie one is our preferred option, here - it's tastier than its meat-filled counterpart) since it takes a while to prepare, and resign yourself to the size of the bill before you get there so it doesn't impact your tapas selection (it's gonna be expensive any which way you look at it, so just order what you think you might like to eat).  Salads are surprisingly good, as are the croquettas.  In fact, I don't think we've disliked anything there (the patatas bravas could be better - they seem to have overthought them with how they're presented and prepared - a lightly-fried egg broken over them at the table - I much prefer the less pretentious preparations you typically find in Spain).

Great place to go for a reliably good dinner out."}
{"text":"Tucked away down an alleyway on king street west, this place has got a great ambience. The plates are small and made to share. Everything on the menu sounded fantastic, so my friends and I took our waiter's advice on which dishes to get. For three of us, we split a large paella because we were told the small was approximately the size of a small dinner plate. We also got 4 small plates. This was enough food for us to leave feeling full but not overly stuffed. Although each plate was small, every item was packed with flavour and tasted incredibly good. 

Service was quite attentive. The servers make an effort to explain each dish and also help to serve dishes such as the paella onto your plate. 

Although this place is pricier, the quality of the food and service justifies the higher price tag."}
{"text":"Had high hopes for this place but was not wow'd enough!! It is a beautiful spot, but the food was lacking. 

Things I enjoyed: croquette & corquetas, chickpea spinach stew
Blistered peppers - ..just burnt pepper without much salt
Huevos fritos - i found it a really weird breakfast combination of raw egg and potatoes and tomatoes that tasted like ketchup
Was really looking forward to having good seafood paella but it was just too salty!!

My party did not enjoy the fried milk..it sort of taste like tofu, but the churro and spanish pasty dessert was divine!"}
{"text":"Go for drinks not food.  I've been here for three dinners and been disappointed on all three occasions.  Decor is gorgeous but the food is really bad.  If you want Spanish tapas, go to Bar Isabel ... or better yet,  Barcelona!"}
{"text":"Firstly, I need to give a shout out to the incredible waiter (and her associates) who provided some of the best service I've had at a restaurant.  My glass of water was never empty, the table crumbs were promptly wiped away and clean plates and utensils were regularly brought out. 

Needless to say, the service was impeccable and the food was great too!

Location/Atmosphere:
The restaurant is set back from the street, just west of Weslodge - not east, as one review suggested. The overall ambience is dark and intimate (albeit with fairly high ceilings), with a nice covered patio. The decor is tastefully hip - lots of needlepoint accents, but nothing too oppressive, (no moose antlers or owls here).  

Dishes:
There are a lot of options on the menu and I found it a bit overwhelming so we asked our waiter to arrange a tasting course.

We left in a comatose so I can't remember all of the dishes.  Some of the standout dishes included the following:

- Bacon-covered Dates (DÁTILES CON TOCINO IBÉRICO): really really good, although one could argue that bacon + dates + cheese will always be good.  Still, it was better than I was hoping and it has some Guindillas peppers to boot.

- Ibérico Pork Flank cooked sous vide style served with a sweet Piquillio Pepper Jam (ECRETO IBÉRICO CON PIMIENTOS DE PIQUILLO Y MERMELADA).  The pork was incredibly tender and the sweet pepper jam provided a nice contrast.

- Octopus on potatoes with paprika and olive oil (PULPO A LA GALLEGA). Another one-two punch of flavours.  This was one of my favourites.

The meal ended with PAELLA PATRIA, a seafood paella dish served on a large plate.  It was really nice mix of saffron with shrimp, mussels, cuttlefish, scallops, snap peas and monkfish.

We also had a few other dishes including house baked bread with fresh tomato and olive oil, Serrano ham and Manchego cheese.  We also had some blistered peppers with sea salt (PIMIENTOS DE PADRÓN).

For dessert, we had Churros and Fried Milk.

Overall, for three people including 4 cocktails, it was about $200+ with tax.

Bottomline: 
Fantastic service, great food."}
{"text":"No doubt this place is beautiful. Located in the heart of King West, Patria is both fun and sophisticated, and a great environment for group dinners or dates. Definitely upscale, but not so much that the environment is uptight and constricting. It's just the right amount of class and liveliness. Intricate designs on the walls, carefully planned lighting, tasteful and trendy furniture and decor - I really enjoyed the setting.

First, the parking situation. We found parking for $6.00 on a Friday evening in a parking garage at King Street and Spadina Avenue, just east of the restaurant. 

Second, the service. Super friendly, pleasant, and honest. Our waiter even stopped us from ordering more food, letting us know when we ordered too much (his recommendations were on point - we ordered just enough).

Third, while the environment and the service were excellent, the food was just alright. We ordered: a) jamon serrano, b) meatballs, c) bacon covered dates, d) empanadas, e) chicken paella, and f) a glass of red sangria, To be honest, I couldn't hold down the bacon wrapped dates (I don't enjoy dates to begin with, so this was definitely not for me). The jammon serrano (aged for 24 months) was just fine, but nothing out of the ordinary. Same for the empanadas and meatballs - while it tasted fine enough, we've definitely had better elsewhere. The chicken paella was the best item out of everything we had, full of flavour and texture. Definitely try this if you're here for dinner.

Overall, we'd come back here for a group dinner or to start off a fun evening, but we wouldn't come back for the food or if \"tasty food\" was our priority. On the whole, Patria isn't bad, but it's not the best. Also, we weren't too hungry to begin with, so we were fine with portion size, but if you are coming super hungry, note that there's a good chance you'll find portion size a bit small. 

For our entire order, with tax, and tip, our total came to around $120."}
{"text":"Their paella should be called #BAElla. Just saying."}
{"text":"Hands down Patria is the best Spanish food I have ever eaten (including New York and Spain). 

Loved the Dátiles Con Tocino Ibérico (Dates + Ibérico Bacon), Jamón Serrano, Patatas Bravas Con Huevos Fritos and for dessert, Leche Frita Con Helado De Azafrán (fried saffron ice cream). 

Saturday night crowd is very sexy, perfect date ambience and the servers/staff are all extremely attentive and sweet."}
{"text":"Great ethnic flare, the spanish wine is amazing, the food is fun to share and staff is great.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"I came here for my \"galentine's day\" dinner with friend cuz we both had something big to celebrate. So we decided to splurge on a good meal. 
We started with 2 cocktails, Cava Suprema (very fruity and sweet, cant taste the alcohol in it, my friend loved it) and another with bourbon and fresh lemon juice in it (sorry i dont remember the name, but it was less sweet but also stronger) $16, $15

Salad: Ensalada De Alcachofas (Shaved Fennel + Radish + Manchego + Crispy Artichokes). The artichokes were shaved into little pieces and fried. It was crispy but not oily at all. The dressing on the salad was amazing.  I am not a huge fan of sheep cheese so i asked for the cheese to be on the side. It wasnt a strong flavour and it was very acceptable. 9/10 $16

Paella De Bogavante: the waitress recommended the lobster and the shrimp paella. For the paella, we had to wait for 45 min but we ordered it right after we got in so it wasnt a long wait. The paella came with a decent amount of seafood and some sausages. The rice was cooked just about right - the flavour wasnt a strong punch and it was enough for us to taste all the spices and seafood that went into it. 10/10 $40

Dátiles: My favourite dish among all. The first bite was very sweet and i wondered it was maple syrup or honey glaze. After a few more bites, the mushy texture hinted that the sweetness came from the natural flavour of the dated, wrapped by the bacon. Simply amazing! Im not a huge fan of bacon but i love dates. 10/10 $9

Berenjenas Fritas: both my friend and I love eggplants so we decided to give this a go. Im not a huge fan of deep fried food in general but it didnt taste heavy or oily at all. It was slightly spicy (coming from the paparika) and cheesy (there was some sheep/goat cheese at the bottom of the plate i think?). And it was also kinda sweet (coming from the orange blossom honey). It was my favourite vegetable and flavours (sweet and spice) in a mouthful. It was just happiness on a plate .10/10 $11

Pimientos Rellenos De Buey: Two small pieces of juicy oxtails on a tiny plate with a huge amount of sauce. It was the last item that came to our table and I was already 90% full by the time i tried it. It was delicious but at that point, my taste buds were already too overwhelmed so i would give it an 8/10 $17

The valentine's day special octopus: This might be the dish with the best plate arts out of all. However, it didnt give us any \"wow\" factor. I find the combo of octopus and potatoes being very interesting. It was tasty but i didnt like it AS MUCH compared to all others. 7/10 

Overall, the meal was great. The waitress was fun and helpful. We tried speaking mostly Spanish to the waiters and waitresses and learnt quite a few new words."}
{"text":"Looking for a place to eat in Toronto & saw paella on their menu. OK let's try Canadian paella!
No reservations available before 9pm so we took a chance on the first come patio seating. No problem we were seated right away @ 6:45. The space is tucked away from the street & the patio was covered & a little dark.  
Ordered 4 tapas: blistered peppers ,jambon on bread ,fried eggplant , & dates stuffed with cheese wrapped in bacon in a sherry reduction.  All were delightful but the peppers & the dates were must-haves. 
Followed with small lobster/shrimp paella - rice peas & tons of flavor we shared for two. 
Staff was great. 2 good martinis. No coffee or dessert.  Went somewhere else for that. I would make a point of going back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"This could have been and should have been a five star rating except for our server 
We stopped in for  a bite right when they opened and sat at the bar. We appeared to annoy the bartender from the minute we sat down. We had to remind her on a few occasion that we waiting for  our drink or toast that she suggested. When another couple sat next to us she turned and kept her attention to them.
It appears they go there often and her attitude was quite different. We should have contacted the manager while we there or asked to be seated elsewhere 
 we actually debated leaving but saw the dishes of food and had to try them. The food was amazing 
The atmosphere was amazing. The servers of our food were amazing . The bartender was horrible.
Very disappointing that they hire somebody like that."}
{"text":"It's a beautiful place for a dinner, loved the ambiance and the service. Their Paella Patria was delicious and worth the 30 minute wait."}
{"text":"This place is dangerously close to my apartment.  After eating here 3 times the week I moved into my place, I realized I needed to slow down my love for Patria for the good of my wallet and my fitness.  So, now I've been here about 7 or 8 times in 6 weeks.  That seems reasonable, right?......... 
Overall, the ambiance is great - ALWAYS lively (make a reservation!  Even during the week, even just for 2... do it), high ceilings, classy but not overly fancy.  Definitely a bit pretentious, but not terrible.  

Must-get favourites:  
Croquetas de jamon (ham croquettes):  SO.  GOOD.  
Patatas Bravas (cubed potatoes with a mild spicy sauce and a fried egg):  Perfection, and tastes very much like the many many patatas bravas dishes I had in Spain.  
Datiles:  Bacon wrapped dates stuffed with a pepper.  Sweet, Savoury, and spicy, all in one.  
Empanadas:  Moist, tasty empanadas with... I think chicken?  Can't remember
Seleccion:  Can't remember the full name, but the meat tray is delicious.  A bit expensive, but you get quite a bit of meat.  


Skip:
Paella:  I was pretty disappointed in the Paella.  Pretty bland.  
Goat cheese and honey - was just kind of boring 
Cheese selections - they are good, but you get 2 thin slices of cheese for $9.... not a good deal.  
Pimintos de padron:  Except for the novelty (some of them are extra spicy, while the others only have a hint of spice, so it's like russian roulette of peppers), these just aren't that good.  And it's a whole lot of peppers (12 or so), so maybe not bad for a group of 4-6.  Not tasty enough for me to eat 6 if it's just two of us...  

Definitely a place to go."}
{"text":"Our experience couldn't have been better! We went there for my boyfriend's birthday dinner. The restaurant is beautiful and felt intimate. We were seated right away with a reservation and they had outdoor tables available. The corner seat was really nice.

We had the foie gras, fried eggplant, octopus with potato, seafood paella and hazelnut mousse. All the food was excellent. The paella and octopus were our favourite. All the seafood was cooked perfectly and the olive oil with the octopus was amazing- the waitress even brought us bread for it(their bread is also great). We'll probably check to see if we can buy their house made hot sauce and olive oil because it was that good.

I really like that they aren't like other nice restaurants that have good food and disappointing desserts- they're desserts are high quality and unique! I would say that 3 dishes and a large paella are good for two people; we were very full. What we paid was reasonable.

The service was excellent.  They were friendly, attentive, knowledgable, and went above expectations. 

We'll definitely be going again and recommending this restaurant!"}
{"text":"... WHERE IS THIS PLACE?!?!? ARE WE IN KANSAS YET? ... 

We had a party of 7 yelpers & yelpettes and 100% of the attendees could not find this place! Took about half an hour walking up and down the block and poking into dark alleyways before we almost gave up and walked into this posh place with NO signage to ask if it was PATRIA.

Tucked away, virtually hidden from the main street, between Patagonia & Wes Lodge is an all-black architectural exterior. If it looks like a private dinner party - it isn't, it's PATRIA. 

What's with the mysterious missing signage? 

Aside from the annoyance of looking for the venue, once you step through the double thick curtain entrance, you find yourself immersed in an ultra modern semi-industrial open concept interior with funky jagged overhead pendent lighting and intriguing \"knitted walls\". 

It looks and feels more like an oversized loft rather than a restaurant.  Very cool! I was beginning to change my mind about this place ...

Then came the food. If you are starving and want a full meal, think again. It's tapas style here and the menu was designed for sharing. If you are on a budget - forget about this place. For a party of 7, the waiter suggested we order 18-20 tapa dishes. WTH?!?!?! The dishes range from $10-$96. That adds up as fast as your mouth will drop when the bill arrives.

THE FOOD

Every dish came to the table rather quickly, except the paella.

Note: The paella requires 45 minutes to serve.

The food though decent and beautifully presented, lacks that sommin' sommin'. The seafood didn't taste super fresh. And the paella (we ordered 3) weren't memorable. Too much rice and not enough of anything else. And a tad bit on the bland boring side. Simply not acceptable for the steep price ... nor the long wait. 

Each ranged between $40 to $45 for a dish to share between 3-4 people. There are  places I would happily drop $100 for a meal. Sadly, this is not one of them. The dishes here just do not justify the prices. 

THE VENUE

If you want to celebrate a special occasion, treat a friend, or impress a date, then Patria might win you points on atmosphere. It's definitely a stylish space with lots of eye candy. But this is not a place I would frequent for food. 

THE SERVICE

Or service! The service was extreme! One of the waiters was a bit snooty and not hospitable, nor did he explain anything clearly.A bit lazy if you ask me. The other waiter was as chummy as a chimpanzee (not that i would know personally). He was overly eager to take photos of our glam group and we were overly eager to pose with our backsides! OH-MY! And when the bill came we were automatically charged 18% for lousy service. Not impressed.

THE VERDICT

If it weren't for the AMAZING company and such a RIOT we all had, (Thanks to Viviana M., Bobby N., Sara K. P., Tamara M., Denise M., Edwin A, Mark T.)  I don't think I'd walk away from here with very fond foodie memories... Perhaps come back for drinks and check out the fabulous crowd ...  It's definitely the place to SEE and BE SEEN!

{"text":"S/o brought us here for date night recently - it was my first time trying a Spanish restaurant! We made a reservation for the Sunday night, but the place turned out to be pretty quiet (more people did trickle in as the night went on however) so probably didn't even need a reso for 2. The restaurant is quite spacious! There's an upstairs too, presumably for larger parties? Beautiful interior design, though I would say it's more \"business-y\" than romantic... There's a sterile, proper feeling about the place? 

It is quite difficult to find edible things on the menu here as a vegan btw, and even as a vegetarian it becomes a bit limiting since everything has a dash of land or sea animals :P We asked our server for vegetarian recommendations and we ended up ordering 

1) Quesos board (3 cheeses + jam + woodfired sourdough bread): My favorite was the goat milk cheese because I love stinky, pungent foods lol. My partner, a big cheese lover, found the cheeses here too strong, which is actually good news for sharp cheese lovers out there as there's guaranteed lots of flavor! The bread was a bit too toasted imo, too crunchy, but I loved the smoky, salted flavor. The bread was probably my favorite part of this dish ahaha.
2) Ensalada de Pera: We asked for the blue cheese on the side, which was not recommended as the cheese as I can imagine usually gives this salad a creamier texture and certainly a huge flavor boost. The salad came looking like simple lettuce leaves with nuts sprinkled on top, and essentially that's what it was and tasted like, so maybe next time that $16 we'll spend on another vegetarian hot side.
3) Coliflor Con Ajo Blanco: It was between this side, the cauliflower, and the chickpeas for us (both sides are vegetarian). We made the right choice - can't go wrong with roasted cauliflower, but more importantly it was the sauce, omg the sauce... It was so aromatic!
4) Paella de la Huerta: We ordered the small size to share and it was pretty reasonable. No leftovers though! This paella is completely vegetarian. I've never had paella before, so can't really comment too much, but I thought it was a bit too salty, but well-seasoned. I didn't really like the battered artichoke crisps on top. I love artichoke, but not battered and fried like that.

The portions of everything were on the smaller end, so don't expect to leave satiated with just one dish per person. Dishes here are more or less tapas style, so come with a few people and order a bunch of dishes to share and try a bit of everything.

Oh yes, it is also quite $$$... Yikes. Special occasions only!"}
{"text":"Finally a Spanish restaurant in the city core (that doesn't suck).
The latest Tapas themed hipsterrific establishment from Charles Khabouth does not disappoint but rather delights and that is a huge compliment for a restaurant who on their first official day of business failed to reveal any flaws. From the ultra luxe interior to the decadent Spanish wine list and the super attentive and well educated staff, this joint is the real deal Holyfield.  But a fair warning  it is kind of hidden en route to a parkade behind Weslodge, so finding the place may be your only gripe.  Just look for the red 'P' sign just East of Weslodge and let your heart guide you to awesomeness.

So let me start off by sating that the menu is to die for, wobbly pops even more so and don't even get me started on the absolutely gorgeous finishings and art that adorn the place.  Mos def a great spot to impress a date, to meet with girlfriends or even to take clients.  Oh and I should also mention that yes they serve brunch on Saturdays.  Spanish brunch! With two kinds of (uber tasty) sangria!  Pinch me because I must be dreaming.    
Since it's day one, I'm not sure if the menu will stay the same or will be a work in progress, regardless I encourage you to try as many things as possible.  We did and I can honestly say there was not one thing we ordered that I did not enjoy.  Thoroughly.  Like lick the damn plate clean thoroughly.  The cheese selection is a dairy lovers wet dream, chickpea dish is out of this world and OMFG they have jamon iberico that they slice before your very eyes at the super stylish bar (also home to their deliciously seasoned Spanish olives).  I anticipate that this place is going to blow up (once people figure out where the f#%k it is), so if you (like me) have been yearning good Spanish nibbles I recommend going now while it is not afflicted by pretentious line ups and impossible to get reservations.  Serious, be like Nike and 'Just do it'."}
{"text":"Drinks were great but man it was such a long wait for our food after we sat down. Literally 50 minutes since we ordered."}
{"text":"Oh so good. There's something about tapas restaurants that i think could be called  The Tapas Rules. As follows:
1. Every dish must taste different. Like super different. 
2. But still within the basic theme. Like not Spanish and Asian and Indian. But in the theme. Stick to your color scheme. 
3. Have really good waitstaff. That's just a general rule of life. 
4. Flavors need to be strong and memorable. When you're eating the broccoli you still need to be saying that was really damn good squid 30 seconds ago. And you want to write about it later. 
5. Have good drinks. That's as much of a tapas item as anything else. Not just hydration and uninhibited good times on a kind of weird and awkward date. 
Patria is like 1,2,3,4,5. There's probably a 6-14 and they got that too. Wicked food. Like everything we ordered. Broccoli. Porcini mushrooms oh god yes. Octopus special. Sangria pitcher. Blistered peppers the Spanish classy version of a bag of endless Doritos. Pan con tomate and the salted olive oil. Chorizo charcuterie board so flavorful. Bombas making me want to yell \"bombas!\"  

This review is a bit crazy but it's because I really liked the food and don't know how to describe it. Even the price point just feels right when you taste the food. There's an intricacy in how it's prepared and the flavors are so subtle, you can taste where your money is going. 

Delicious. Beautiful inside. Great food. Well worth the price and any trouble you have getting a reservation."}
{"text":"My dear churos got longer since the last visit! What more can I ask!?!? Unlike others, Patria never let me down :)"}
{"text":"Made a reservation for Sunday brunch at 10:30 AM, and when we walked in, we were the first people there. We were greeted warmly, and the first impression of the restaurant was that it was stylishly furnished. 

It's the perfect date location, with nice two person tables by the window. The food was delicious, and the perfect balance of quality and quantity. The Americanos were so good, we each had two. We finished things off with sharing this yummy churro. The service was also excellent. All in all, a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"I chose Patria for my birthday few days ago. I'm honestly not entirely happy about the service there tho. 
1I told one Asian waitress that I don't want any cilantro at all, and she went back to double check for us, but still there's cilantro everywhere on my salad and beef. We didn't want to wait that long again so we didn't send the food back. I really don't like uncooked cilantro. 
2We made reservation and dressed up that night, I was sort of expecting more welcoming service. After the waitress serve the birthday dish with candle, she just left. The day before that night, I had another birthday dinner at Bent. At least the waiter sang a little bit of birthday song with us. 
3 Usually for this kind of restaurants waiter/waitress would ask if the client is here to celebrate any special occasion, but she didn't ask. That's fine. I was just wondering if she asked maybe I'll order a bottle of wine instead of two glasses. 

To sum up, I liked the beef a lot. Tasted really nice and tender. The wine is fine wine too. Interior design is gorgeous, the giant painting is really cool. I just wish the customer service could do better next time. Especially when you see the customer is all dressed up with heels and full make-ups, they're here to spend money.

Food was delicious. Cocktails and wine were great. Atmosphere was cozy and romantic.

Favourite menu items were the empanadas, fried goat cheese with honey, and bacon wrapped figs  - YUM!

Would return on a date with the boo thang."}
{"text":"Been dying to try this place with all the hype around it, to be frank its mostly hype, location and ambiance. 

The few times I tried to just walk in they never had a table available. For a table of 2 the online reservation system only had an early seating available. But when we arrived the restaurant didn't feel packed the whole night. The decor was very nice, dark and perfect for a romantic date. The ceilings were high and the beautiful woven wall piece.

We got the grilled octopus, it wasnt chewy but also didn't feel very flavourful, on the bland side. The serving was also quite small 7 tiny pieces with small cut potatoes. Also tried the piquillo peppers stuffed with oxtail and manchego, the ox tail was braised and was very soft, I wish there was more cheese, but again for $17 there were only 2 small peppers and felt overpriced. 

The paella was good, and came out nice and hot. It was filled with shrimp, mussels, calamari  snap peas and clams. It was nicely seasoned, and rice was perfectly cooked. The portions are a good and large size!

For dessert we got the fried milk, the milk itself was ok deep fried gelatiny milky blocks, not the best I've ever had. The saffron ice cream however was delicious, and was presented beautifully with edible flowers. We left very full at the end of the night. 

The service was good, my glass always had water and they were very friendly. We were never rushed, we were there for probably a little more than 2 hours. The hostesses were dressed very trendy might I add."}
{"text":"Reservations should definitely be made if you plan on coming on Fridays or the weekends. I dropped by with bf on a Saturday night around 7 pm and they had no tables available. But luckily we were able to sit at the bar and still received excellent service!

This is a really nice restaurant; dim lighting, paintings on the walls, service was awesome, the hostess offered to put away our coats upon our entry and the place wasn't too loud or too quiet that you couldn't talk to the person next to you. We ordered a half bottle of wine (~$40), the grilled octopus and potato appetizer (should definitely get this, it's on their specials menu $18) and the Paella Patria $30 (seafood paella). 

I really enjoyed the grilled octopus appetizer. Almost everything in this dish was from Spain: the octopus, paprika, and the olive oil! Octopus was so soft I couldn't even tell it was octopus ahha. And the seafood paella was also amazing. The waiter offered to mix and plate the dish for us which was nice and the dish was really good, filled to the brim with seafood (mussels, shrimp, clams etc.) and very flavourful. 

We were too full for dessert but I heard the mousse is absolutely amazing. And next time we come back, I will definitely order some spanish charcuterie!"}
{"text":"I think I missed the memo on why people have been raving about here.

Exceptional service and courteous staff. Impeccable attention to detail at the table level- waitstaff ensured they refilled water and drinks without having to be asked, very polite and open to providing suggestions on the menu.
Food
Octopus special- beautiful presentation, fresh and well, nothing to write home about on the flavour front. It tasted of its seasonings- paprika and fresh olive oil. 
Padron peppers- tasted like padron.
Cheese-tasted as expected
Avocado salad- Boston Bibb lettuce was fresh and soft... As expected.
Chicken croquettes- no flavour.

Would I go back? To do justice yes to try dinner, because everyone raves about this place. Tapas is better at embrujo flamenco.

$174 for 3 people (5 drinks, 5 tapas)"}
{"text":"Time & Date of visit: Sunday, March 5, 2017 @ 5pm-7:45pm
Atmosphere: Elegant, Grand, Intimate, modern meets Spanish flair
Cleanliness: Restaurant appeared to be clean. Cutlery, plates and glasses were clean.
Constructive criticism: Increase portion sizes!
Cuisine: Spanish tapas. (tapas: a wide variety of appetizers served hot or cold in the Spanish cuisine)
Facilities: Did not visit the facilities.
Food: Authentic Spanish tapas eatery. Went for an early dinner with the girls. A group of 5, seated in the corner of the restaurant in a comfy booth. We started off with a glass of wine each. Some of us ordered red, and some white. House glass of white was good enough for me. We immediately ordered our Paella, because it takes 45min to make. Our appetizers were Datiles, Empanadas, Queso Frito, Coliflor, Seleccion De Embutidos, Ensalada De Aguacate. I'm going to say that all appetizers were tasty, and had bold flavor, however we were not impressed with the portion sizes. We got our large order of Paella Patria which, the presentation was beautiful, and our server offered to distribute the rice. Again, the portions were very small. I was unimpressed with the flavor of this paella. I imagined it to be super tasty, but was nothing to write home about. The texture and density was great, but I felt it lacked salt. If I ever come back, I will order a paella dish with meat and fish. For a group of 5 women, 2 Large Paellas would have been better, or 1 small Paella each.
Likeliness of returning or recommending to others: Would like to try other Paella styles. May come back with significant other.
Parking: conveniently located right under the restaurant. Sunday after 5pm, was $5.00.
Portion Sizes: disappointingly small.
Price: Overpriced for the portions you get.
Service: Our server was Devin. Made a good impression, and was helpful with our decision making since our table were first time guests.
Selection: Good. The menu offered just the right amount of items. Not overwhelming, and all items looked delicious.
What makes this restaurant stand out from the others: cuisine. Not many in Toronto offer Paella.

{"text":"Talk about another gem of a place! I must start out by warning you all that this place is a little hard to find if you aren't looking hard enough. It is right next to Patagonia so hopefully that helps guide you a little bit. 

OK enough about that...let's talk about first impressions. I walked in and the first thing that caught my eye was the huge paintings on the walls. Those were pretty cool looking, as well as the fancy bar area that housed the pig leg and all of the other assorted meats. I was visiting Toronto for work and made it a point to check out some really nice restaurants. Since I was alone I choose to sit at the bar and watch the butcher at work! But the outside area looked really peaceful and the inside dining area was also very modern and hip looking. I asked the butcher and waitress for help while ordering. Everything looked so good but I needed guidance since I was eating alone. They recommended the fried pig ears (AMAZING!!!), chorizo for a meat and goat cheese that was aged in wine. Although I didn't order much I was pretty full by the time I finished my meal. I can't forget that I ordered the churros for dessert. If you are every contemplating getting dessert at this restaurant, you must order the churros that are dipped in dulce sauce. It was decadent and just down right sinful how good it was. 

If I am ever in Toronto again, I will make sure to stop by Patria!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing. Ordered an assortment of shard plates including a small paella split for 2. The Patatas Bravas is delicious. The sangria was nice and boozy. The only thing can be improved is the service.

Service was rude and our server honestly gave no f*cks about even pretending to be pleasant. She then forgot to put in our order, came back super pleasant and apologetic. Later on resumed to her frosty temperament."}
{"text":"I was solidly disappointed by my experience at Patria.

Right off the bat, the staff was...friendly but stuff. Uncomfortably formal in a way that doesn't match the restaurant. After that, service was fine but not great.

Food was solidly average for a tapas style restaurant, though I went for brunch.
Patatas Bravas - quite possibly the worst patatas bravas I've ever had. It's normally a favorite at Spanish restaurants, but this was lacking flavor. Not actively bad, but not good.
Tortilla de patata - spanish potato omelette. Fairly good overall, and the romesco sauce was very good.
Don't remember the other things we ordered, but were about average."}
{"text":"I went here for dinner last night and I was genuinely and thoroughly impressed.  Given the King St. location, and trendy decor, I was expecting good-but-not-great food, but I was pleasantly surprised, over and over again.

My girlfriend and I had six small plates, two salads, two meat dishes, and three desserts...  and I didn't have my notepad with me, and they don't seem to have a menu online, so please bear with my approximate descriptions of the highlights!

Dates wrapped in iberico ham, filled with (I believe) cheese, and something spicy.
These were really awesome, brilliant!  Sweet-sticky, salty-cheesy, and spicy were in harmonious balance.  I was really blown away.

Baby octopus grilled-ish with chopped tomoto-ish sauce and some capers detected.  Really great: extremities were crisp, centers were tender to al dente, sauce/accompaniments were light and fresh.

Salads (without going into excessive detail) had a mix of textures including crunchy (walnuts, caramelized?) and crispy (fried artichoke slices), and flavors including tasteful use of cheese.

Lamb chops with a very smooth (i.e. almost mousse-like) tomato-based sauce and caramelized onions.  One of the best lamb chops I've had, starting with really good lamb: tender, flavorful, cooked properly, and in harmony with accompaniments.

Iberico flank steak: wasn't sure what to expect as I've never had a pork flank steak.  It was amazing!  Tender, flavorful, moist, with the surface slightly crisped.  Served with slightly sweet chopped red peppers (if I recall correctly).  

Given how impressed I was with the food, I decided to order dessert, even though I am normally a pretty extreme sugar nazi.

I don't know what it was called, but something like: crisp layers (wafer-like, kind of) with coffee ice cream in between and...  bits of black olive.  Blew me away (again), not only really ambitiously creative and different, but also really delicious.  

Service was fast, attentive, accurate, and slightly amused by the amount of food I ordered.

BONUS:  Best-designed sinks and faucets in the bathrooms.  Faucets: abundant water, yet nearly impossible to splash yourself.  Sink design: no leaning over, no stretching, no bumping your knuckles into the sink.  Really an effortless pleasure to use."}
{"text":"This place was amazing!!!  The food was great I love the tapas style, the manager was great he made our anniversary very very special. Everything was awesome. Will be back soon."}
{"text":"Tapas for Dinner! Definitely get resos. I would also try to ask about paellas in advance, perhaps? As it takes 45 minutes to allow \"the rice to settle and the flavours to blend.\" Overall, I enjoyed my experience here and will come back for drinks.

AMBIANCE
+Nestled behind an ornamental gate - almost like finding secret treasure, hah
+There's just something about high ceilings that just lend a certain grandeur to any establishment, dontcha think? Patria is dimly-lit with beautiful architecture and an astounding array of wine bottles and cleavers (yep) gracing its walls. Juxtaposition! Loved the natural buzz around the place - chattering guests melded with music kept to a decent volume very nicely.

FOOD
In order of preference -
+Croquetas de Manchego (Leek + Manchego Croquettes + Aioli): Three sticks of deep-fried manchego cheese topped with a subtle aioli sauce.
+Black Cod with Parsley Coulis (Specials menu): Cooked perfectly! Cod that melts in your mouth.
Pimientos Rellenos De Buey (Piquillo Peppers + Oxtail + Manchego): STUFFED peppers with oxtail - delicious and just the right amount!
+/-Datiles con Tocino Iberico (Dates + Ibérico Bacon + Manchego + Guindillas): My partner raved about this dish and the excitement was lost upon me. Flavour was decent but nothing memorable
+/-Pulpo (Special menu!): The octopus was cooked really well and was paired with a thin slice of potato and drizzled with olive oil sauce. I wasn't wow'd by the dish though
-Roasted Cauliflower: Did not strike me at all - tasted rather plain.

SERVICE
+Our server, Scott, really took care of the night. He was knowledgeable and professional. We could only decide on 2 or 3 of the dishes!! So, when Scott came around to check up on us again, instead of providing recommendations he said \"leave it with me\" and selected the dishes for us. Delightfully surprised! 
+Water refills on-point"}
{"text":"The service was very good. Our glasses were never empty and the waitress was really nice. The atmosphere was nice, we had a table on their patio, which was nice because it was really nice out.

We ordered a bottle of wine, fideo pasta with clams and chorizo, piquillo peppers stuffed with oxtail, prime beef striploin with padron peppers and crispy potato (chips), and the paella patria between 3 girls.  My favourite dish was the strip loin. The steak was cut into bite sizes so it is perfect to pair with the chips and peppers that it comes with and also perfect for sharing. The piquillo peppers was really small. It only comes with two peppers so between 3 people we were basically able to have a bite each. It is flavorful but I personally think it's too expensive. It was $16 for that dish. We could've done without it. The paella was good, it takes about 45 minutes to make so if you plan on getting it then you should order that first thing and then take your time with deciding on what else to order. The paella is quite large. Perfect to share between 3 people. The fideo pasta was okay. I think they fry the pasta because it was a little crunchy. The clams in the pasta was good and it was a decent size

Of all the dishes we ordered, I would only order the strip loin again. Everything else wasn't really mind blowing and I thought it was expensive. They also charge for hot sauce, which I thought was unnecessary. Food is already expensive, they can at least provide their guests with complimentary hot sauce."}
{"text":"I was choosing restaurant for a special occasion-my birthday and Patria was an actual win-good value, great food and amazing interior (per pictures and review read). It was my first time here, I've reserved a table for 2 via opentable, it was an option for special occasion and requested seating (couch set, near those majestic portraits). When I've showed up at Patria for my reservation, it was pretty empty, but the hostess showed me our tiny table near the kitchen and when I mentioned it's my birthday and I would like a nice table,she replied that she has full reservation for today's evening and I can not be seated where I wanted. Anyway, I've got what I wanted but had this taste of \"unprofessionalism\"-not sure if I'll come back, but the food was good (tapas plates), our waiter was nice and did a brief explanation for the menu selection"}
{"text":"Specialty: Spanish Tapas
Menu items: Tortilla de Patatas, Halibut with Chimichurri, Beef Cheek Fideos & Churros

This fairly new Toronto King-west restaurant has knocked my socks off. Hidden under a new residential building in an alley-way, Patria, the new collaboration by the same owners of sister restaurant Weslodge, brings a little bit of Barcelona to our palates.

With an eclectic decor, comfy chairs and an open-kitchen concept, the tapas-inspired restaurant delivers a modern take on traditional Spanish food with ingredients directly imported from the mother-land and flavours that explode in one's mouth.

I visited Patria for lunch to take advantage of the lower-priced tapas option. The restaurant is not cheap by any means, but their lunch menu delivers some of the most delicious tapas I've had the pleasure of tasting in this city. Starting with my favourite and one that makes me salivate just thinking about it, the Beef Cheek Fideos. A tremendous explosion of sweet and savory flavours that marry well on a plate of noodles, soaked in a tomato broth, topped with pieces of juicy beef cheek and cilantro. The noodles are soft and mushy, and rightly so, as Spanish \"fideos\" usually are. They are thin, short, with the right moisture balance.

Patria's take on the famous tapa - Tortilla de Patatas is one to admire.This potato, cheese and egg concoction has texture like no other. Layers of \"un-mushy\" potatoes are wrapped in an omelette-like egg and cheese mix. The tortilla comes served with a small pouring of a tomato compote that gives the dish that extra punch of flavour.

On the fish front, Patria opens up one's imagination to the possibility of using chimichurri on fish, with their take on a halibut covered in the precious traditional Argentinian sauce. The fish, cooked with a nice flaky centre and lightly fried skin, comes smothered in the parsley, garlic, oregano, red wine vinegar and olive oil sauce. The chimichurri is so fresh and tasty, you almost want to order bread to dip in the sauce and wipe the plate clean.

On the dessert front, Patria delivers just as well. The popular dessert, Churros, has crowds craving for more. The popularity of this dessert stems from the fact this Spanish-staple is made on the premises. Their churro-making machine sits at the front of the kitchen, outputting hundreds of the doughy treats that are served on a bed of thick and sweet dulce de leche.

With this kind of food, Patria, also known in English as Homeland, hits the spot when in search of a little of Barcelona in the city.

Buen Provecho,
Viviana."}
{"text":"I wanted to update my review because we have been here so many times since then, and it's clearly the top restaurant in it's category in Toronto. Always great service, always amazing food. The price is very good for what you get, you can eat for less than $200 a couple including wine, tax and a good tip (we had 1.5 bottles too!). If you have not tried this place, you are missing out!"}
{"text":"Love this addition to King West - what an amazing job they did on the space - original & beautiful - they knocked it out of the park.  Great place for a date night, work dinner or special occasion meal because it is a bit fancier & quite civilized, but you still get that downtown vibe.

This place is tapas with a twist - not pure Spanish, but that is why it really reminded me of Spain, where they don't stick to pure tradition and are evolving Spanish food - very cool to see that in TO.

I am pretty sure the menu changes a lot, but the croquettes, figs and potatoes should always be there and are amazing - I would take server recommendations on food & wine as they are great and you will get good variety.

Only negatives for us were not deal breakers - 
a) too sweet - quite a few of the dishes mix sweet & savory in the same way - I found it too much of the same flavours
b) we were encouraged to over order twice - I hate that when at a small plates place...let people step in to the menu, we know you want us to order more and maybe we will, but don't push everyone to order 3 or 4 per person...too much

We will be back and look forward to to trying it again!"}
{"text":"A second visit to Patria and it is still as good! We were much earlier than the time of reservation, the restaurant was not yet opened. We only hoped the receptionist was a little less hostile. We know where we are going and yes, we made the right reservation and at the restaurant that we wanted to hang out and eat. 

Their wine list is not bad and the quality of wine from Spain were good. Paella never let you down and their meat plate sampler was just the right size. We were too full to venture their dessert land. Next time, next time!"}
{"text":"Great place! I highly recommend it if you like sharing plates. They have a magnificent terrasse downtown."}
{"text":"A decent place to get tapas. We weren't very hungry when we went, so we only ordered a few appetizers to see the hype around Patria.
Maybe because of my Asian background/stomach, I found a few spices in our meal a bit weird and not quite to my taste. Their decor inside is really cozy (though there were fake knives hanging above our heads at our table LOL)."}
{"text":"Came here as a part of 6 earlier this year and thoroughly enjoyed our experience.  We did have a bit of trouble finding the place, as the entrance was hidden - so make sure you know the address beforehand.  

The decor is beautiful and there was tapestry all over the walls! Not entirely pleased about where our table was located though, it seemed to be in the middle of everything (just on the end of the stairs, in front of the drinks booth, etc.)

Our server was incredibly helpful with portion sizes and recommended a bunch of appetizers to split, and a paella, followed by individual desserts at the end.  Great suggestions on his part, as the portions were perfect in the end.  

Appetizers included Pan Con Tomate, Almendras Saladas, Dátiles Con Tocino Ibérico, Queso De Cabra Frito Con Higo Y Miel, and an octopus one that was a special of the day. All of these were pretty good, the pieces we each got were tiny, but we ordered a bunch of apps, so in the end, it worked out fairly well. None of them stood out significantly to me, they were just all fairly good.

The paella we ordered was a daily special with chicken in it. Definitely not a dish to be had individually or even shared with 2 people.  We split the paella among 5 of us, and we all could have seconds too.  

A word of caution to vegetarians, this place isn't too friendly for you folks, the one vegetarian at our table did have a salad instead of the paella, but keep in mind a large portion of the menu does have meats in it.

Dessert-wise, I ordered the Flores Con Miel Y Helado De Turrón which is a \"Spanish Pastry + Orange Blossom Honey + Turrón Almond Ice Cream\".  Presentation was beautiful and the ice cream was filled with an almond flavour.  The pastry itself was crispy and not flaky, just perfect.

In terms of price, you definitely do get what you pay for, the quality of the service and food was amazing, so, as expected, the price is elevated similarly.  I do believe the bill was around $200 at the end, which is more or less expected for a group dinner of this calibre."}
{"text":"So it's about time that I wrote a review for Patria, which I bookmarked and wanted to try it for the longest times ever..yet then again...it was not really up to par...sighs...Too many people raving about the food, paella, tapas and all those...didn't really appeal to me that much..maybe my expectations were too high? maybe I'm secretly comparing it to the ones I've eaten in Europe (huge mistake!)

We came here for a birthday, the ambience was loud as expected, tables were a little tight..

We ordered the paella in the beginning knowing that it would take a min of 25-30 mins to make...Ordered some tapas, they weren't screaming delicious at me...they were just an A-Ok for me personally...

As per Emily K., I have the same thoughts \"Ordered a variety of plates and drinks but left feeling a bit unsatisfied\"

Waited a long time for the foods, which I don't mind if it was screaming delicious but thats not how I felt...

All in all, I doubt I will be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant, the food is absolutely fantastic. 
The restaurant has a great ambiance, very sophisticated n romantic. The service was truly impeccable. The staff is really friendly n helpful. It was my first time there n my server made great recommendations for food n wine.
We had the 

gamba paella (it was on special)- simply wow. The rice was full of flavor, the shrimps were big n juicy. Just amazing.

charcuterie board with 4 very flavourful cured meats (the iberico chorizo was my favourite)

the octopus. Very good. When combined with the potato it had this really amazing texture.

Pinientos rellenos de buey(pepper stuffed with oxtail) - surprisingly delicious. The oxtail almost tasted like pulled pork lol. Very good

Pimientos de padron (blistered peppers + sea salt) - very cool dish. The peppers were almost crispy. 

Overall it was truly an amazing dining experience."}
{"text":"Patria is exceptional.  The food, atmosphere, staff was superb.  My husband & I had dinner here for my b-day.  We ordered the octopus & potato appetizer $16, and Patria Paella $49, which is the seafood paella with shrimp, lagoustine, monk fish, mussels, rice, saffron. It arrived steeping hot in a pan, traditional Spanish style.  The flavours were amazing.  Our waiter was very attentive & friendly, had a few laughs/jokes with us, yet still extremely professional. It's one of the tastiest experiences I've had in a long time.  The food was positively amazing.  We plan to go back again next week.  I'd highly recommend this restaurant to any friends or colleagues at work."}
{"text":"Perfect spot to catch up with your friends over a pitcher of sangria. Staff are all very nice and go above and beyond to make your experience enjoyable. It is a bit pricey but the sangria is definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"Great food, really nice patio, enjoyed the ambiance .. Only negative: a bit expensive  ... However, toronto doesn't offer too many great tapas choices and this is definitely one of the top few and worth trying if you're looking for an authentic Spanish experience"}
{"text":"Awesome food, and really friendly and accommodating staffs.  Definitely one of the better places in the city."}
{"text":"We had a phenomenal dinner here last week.  Started off with the sangria pitcher.  Tapas we ordered were all fantastic -- the potato salad, the toasted bread that was rubbed with a juicy red tomato and sliced Spanish ham, the date stuffed with manchego and wrapped in bacon...and moving along to the main course, we had the paella patria which was absolutely divine.  Of course, dessert needed to be ordered (despite being udderly full) so we got the flores con miel, which was delicate and so flavorful all in one!  Accompanying americanos puts any coffee house to shame.  And the service -- OMG, the service -- was just TOP NOTCH!  Marvin, you're da bomb!  You helped me scrape up the last crunchy bits of the paella with your big biceps and didn't make me feel embarrassed for wanting the last, teeny, tiny morsels, thank you!  Beautiful ambiance and clearly, the owners know what they're doing here and shmoozing the tables and the kitchen is doing a great job.  Thanks for a memorable meal, Patria!"}
{"text":"This place was recommended by a friend for a surprise birthday for my partner. I'm glad I listened. From the hidden entrance, woven titled wall, and candles I knew I was in a hidden gem. The food and drinks were incredible. Thanks for making the birthday a hit! Will be back ASAP."}
{"text":"The best Spanish tapas and paella in the city, although I only have Tapas at Embrujo to compare it to. Been here a few times and have no major complaints about the food, service or ambience. Book early as reservations for Thursday and weekends fill up weeks in advance. Order the paella as soon as you're seated as it takes upwards of 45 mins to be prepared (but well worth the wait). Tapas and quesos portions are on the light side (i.e. only two empanadas, and cheese usually comes in a very small block) so order at least one tapas per diner. Four people can typically share a paella, a few tapas, two desserts and a drink each for less than $50pp. Great for dates and special occasions."}
{"text":"I could eat the atmosphere here all night.  Beautifully decorated and a fun vibe.  Great for a date (suggest sitting at the bar) or an energetic yet romantic group dinner.  The dishes are well executed and full of flavor.  There is nothing groundbreaking about the menu, but it's a well run and well presented tapas spot.  Our favorite were the datiles - they melt in your mouth!"}
{"text":"Im really stuck between giving this place a 3 or a 4.

Service was great, and the decor was beautiful. Great patio as well.
It's just that the food didn't wow me very much. 
None of the food was really memorable to me, but surprisingly the one thing
that I wanted more of was their sauté of broccolini and Almond gazpacho. Amazing. 
Their cheese platter was fun as well.

I wasn't a fan with the horchata. Kind of watery compared to what I had multiple times in Spain. 

I would probably come back on a later date."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had a spontaneous date night at Patria because we were both craving paellas :P Patria has a romantic and dim ambiance. Service was okay.

BOMBAS CON SALSA BRAVA (3/5)
(Chorizo, aioli, spicy piquillo sauce)
I think this is what we ordered, can't really remember the name - we did not expect the dish to come out as a flatbread.. 

PAELLA DE BOGAVANTE (4/5)
(Lobster, gulf shrimp, chorizo and peas)
Definitely satisfied our paella cravings with this order :) 
Loved the lobster - it was in big chunks! 
The portions of rice and seafood were perfect.
We would order this again. The portion size is for two people, which worked with us."}
{"text":"Every dish was delicious.  The wines are a bit pricey.  The churro was a bit stale.  The ambience was trendy."}
{"text":"The decor an ambiance here has a very \"hip and happinin\" feel.  But for what you get, it's too expensive, in my opinion.  Don't get me wrong.  I have no problem paying for a great meal, but I expect to eat food that I can't necessarily make at home and to leave with a full tummy.  

The food isn't bad, but just not worth the price IMO.  The garlic shrimp for instance, had 4 tiny shrimp that I can (and have) make at home using frozen shrimp.  

If you're going to come here, I'd recommend coming with a bigger group and splitting a bunch of things, rather than just 1 or 2 other people."}
{"text":"Went to Patria last night (a Wednesday) around 7:00 with a friend, I'm so glad she suggested this restaurant! You'll love it... once you find it. I couldn't find it, then couldn't find the door, THEN couldn't open the door. Learn from my blundering and walk up the driveway on the west side of Weslodge, it's at the back. Very authentic Spanish food, a beautiful restaurant, and professional service. We had five or six dishes, including many of the favourites already mentioned by other reviewers. I'll mention the charcuterie platter, because it was fabulous. It's a little odd to me to have nothing but meat on a charcuterie board, but it was so delicious I didn't care (esp. the Iberico Lomo). The house-marinated olives were also very memorable; they are fruity, citrusy, almost floral in flavour. And the house-baked bread is so delicious I'm craving some right now. The only item I wouldn't order again is the halibut; it was fresh and well cooked but nothing special. We had the chocolate pudding for dessert, which was good, but I'd probably try something else next time (I don't think my dinner partner enjoyed the olive oil it was served on).  I felt the prices were a little lower than I expected, but there's quite a range, so it very much depends on what you order. Most items we ordered were under $15 each. Our waitress was unlucky enough to land the table with two pregnant women dining, so we didn't have any wine or cocktails(sigh), and our bill was around $100 once we'd eaten our fill. Oh, and the service was outstanding, she really made the evening enjoyable. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant with great service. Overall really enjoyed the experience. Now to the food:

Foie gras bocadillos: excellent, they basically melt in your mouth. 2 per plate.

Bacon wrapped dates: so juicy and delicious. This is something I would definitely come back for. 

Paella Patria: filled with loads of shrimp, scallop, and mussels. This is a meal on its own. More than a meal even. Really enjoyed the perfectly cooked rice. It was mouth watering. Would come back for this or try a diff paella next time.

Pork epenadas: these were okay. Meat was kinda hard and dry.

Red and white sangria: not the best sangria I ever had but it was good."}
{"text":"Decor is very nice and the food is good...but for some excellent Spanish tapas in Toronto I still prefer Torito in Kensington or Cava at Yonge/St Clair.

If you go to Patria, the meat and cheese selections are excellent (especially the chorizo and the acorn-fed ham). The bacon-wrapped dates are also a must-get.

But beware...once you start ordering 3-4 small dishes per person (as suggested by the friendly server) the bill sure adds up!"}
{"text":"Perfect location and friendly staff. The tapas were very tasty, we also ordered Sangria, for the first round, we got the white wine (with peach flavor), and I personally it was too sweet. The second round, we just went for the traditional red wine Sangria, and it was much better. The large seafood Paella was not enough for 3 girls, therefore we also ordered a few tapas, the dates were very tasty! 
Paella was not as good as I thought it would be.... it was ok. 

Wouldn't recommend this place for romantic date because it's a very loud place!"}
{"text":"The food is mediocre and overpriced, but the real standout of my experience here was how pretentious and arrogant Patria representatives are. I was treated with unabashed condescension in a pretentious and loud setting, where it was made extremely clear that you are viewed as a dollar amount, and not as a customer or guest worthy of basic courtesy or respect. Even if the food had been worth the price, which it certainly was not, I would never willingly return to such an utterly uncomfortable and arrogant atmosphere."}
{"text":"I really really enjoy this place. From the decor, atmosphere, all around great place. The food is so tasty and perfect. Can't wait to cross off all the items off their menu."}
{"text":"Came here in November for my birthday... Very cozy, intimate, and warm spot. Ordered a bunch of tapas and they were all delicious.. But hands down - their paella was divine. It's made fresh to order so it takes a long time to come out..  But I wished I ordered a large instead of a small. I would come back just for paella. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"The highlights of the visit were our waiter who was very well informed about the food and wine, an outstanding red wine (which he recommended)  and the churros. These are what earned them the 2 stars.
Can't believe they dont serve the most common type of paella - the Valenciana. The closest to it was one that wasnt even on the website menu and featured scallops and chorizo. However it was over salted and the bottom of the pan was pure grease with the rice itself feeling oily. Having eaten paella many times in Spain, I can truthfully say THIS WAS NOT IT! Not even in the Barcelonian tourist trap restos have I eaten a paella this mediocre. As for some of the other flavour combinations: confit de Canard in a paella - really? $55 for a large paella that barely served 5 of us and only worked because one of the party was sick and not eating much is NOT good value for money. Finally the overriding seasoning in this place is salt. Its everywhere and someone is obviously generous in its application. Wonder if the chef tastes his food before it goes out?
As long as Torontonians continue to write glowing reports based on ambience and snob value this is the crap we will get. Needless to  say I will not be back.
Sadly this is the major difference between Montreal and Toronto. Places serving bad food in Montreal dont last. Here we glorify them and fill the place because of the upscale venue and ambience. Oy vey!"}
{"text":"The food were in general very delicious and well presented. Portions were small especially the pitcher of Sangria (for $33 each) that was filled with more ice than wine or fruit was only enough for 2 glasses for each pitcher. 

We had our waiter put together a tasting menu for us so we tried:
- Selección De Embutidos - Ibérico Lomo + Ibérico Chorizo + Jamón Serrano + Morcón Salami. Serrano ham was my fav.
- Murcia Al Vino cheese
- Pimientos De Padrón
- Dates wrapped in Iberico bacon and manchego cheese
- Patatas Bravas Con Huevos Fritos
- Croquetas De Jamon
- Roasted Cornish Hen
- Squid on Patatas"}
{"text":"This was an amazing restaurant! I could not stop raving about this restaurant to my friends.  And even though, I went a year ago - I knew this restaurant deserved a review. 

The ambiance was perfect for an intimate meeting between friends or for a date. Low lights, industrial style. I have never been to a restaurant where everything was so on point. Our server was super attentive, and knowledgable about the menu.

General trend in the food was light, cheesy, crispy, everything was flavourful.  

But especially 

The Queso Frito achieved the perfect balance of salty and sweet. I have always loved goat cheese, but this was goat cheese that was a bit crispy and honey drizzled over it, the inside was cheesy and oozy. 

Empanadas - perfectly crispy and golden on the outside but the meat was tender and flavourful from the inside. The sauce that accompanied it, was a perfect match. 

Paella Patria - This was so flavourful and well cooked - that I wanted to keep eating it and I made sure to scrape every last grain into my mouth. 

Leche Frita - we ordered this because  we were intrigued by trying fried milk and saffron ice cream. This was a good dessert, nothing like I have ever had before. It wasn't too sweet and I prefered the ice cream over the fried milk, but the balance between the two flavours was really refreshing. 

All in all, this meal was worth every cent!"}
{"text":"First off, it's a bit hard to find if you haven't been before. To save you from wandering around in circles as you try to follow your phone's GPS, I'll make it easy:
-Look for Weslodge. 
-Now look to the left of Weslodge, you'll see a lane-way with a red parking P above it. 
-Go down the lane-way, Patria will be on your left.

Now that you can actually find the place, let me tell you about the experience itself. Nice modern decor with great service. Not only did the food seem authentic but the staff all seemed to have legit Spanish accents.

We were there for a group bday dinner and the serving sizes of the tapas worked out very well. Lots of options, and I'd say the dishes ranged from good to very good.

2 Stand-outs:
1. The paella. Make sure you order this well in advance as it takes quite a while to make. I ate paella everyday while I was on vacation in Barcelona. This was the first paella outside of Spain that has come close to capturing that flavour experience. Great for groups and I'd highly recommend it.

2. Churros Con Dulce De Leche. If you love churros, I'd recommend this as well. Despite our waiter being unsure if their churros would best those from La Gabardine, they total did. The crown of best churros in town now rests with Patria.

- Runner-up: Another excellent dessert was the chocolate pudding w/ olive oil and sea salt. For those that think it sounds a bit weird, don't worry, it works and is delicious!

The final bill was totally reasonable for the level of service and quality of food we received. Great for a nice dinner date or celebratory dinner."}
{"text":"I went there with my friend from Spain who misses Spanish food. The interior are nice and fancy but It was a bit too dark for me (my eyes are terrible) but understandable about the theme of the restaurant. 
So far, my friend enjoyed eating 4 plates but wanted to eat more since the portions are small and yes pricy. but the flavour of food  are okay for her Spanish tongue. For me, overall tastes like a Italian food with cheese and salt. 

Customer service are nice and professional even asked us to take our winter coats to hang."}
{"text":"Ummm more please! I ordered what seemed like one of everything and everything was perfect. The best paella I've ever had and I've even eaten at a place called Paella in LA where I'm from. I mean, if you can make a better Paella than a place that has the brass cojones to NAME THEMSELVES the dish they are known for... Then you must be doing something very, very right. Knowwhatimean?"}
{"text":"I came here two nights ago with my girl friends. After walking through the blistering cold, it was nice to have a friendly hostess ready to take our coats and put it away for us! It's a little hidden away. Find the Patagonia and turn in, but don't go all the way to the private residences (that's what I did by accident).

The decor was lovely. Dim lighting in the evening. The restaurant has high ceilings which made it very airy.

We ordered the following between the three of us:
1) DÁTILES CON TOCINO IBÉRICO: SUPER good. I'm a sucker for bacon, so this made me really happy.
2) D.O. MURCIA AL VINO: This was absolutely delicious. I absolutely loved the cheese, with the quince jam and bread. The bread was SO good. I think this might be one of my favorite dishes.
3) COLES DE BRUSSALES BRAVAS CON CHORIZO: This was great with the chorizo.
4) BRÓCOLI CON AJO BLANCO Y AJO FRITO: We tried to order more vegetables, mainly because my friend is vegetarian. However, this was a huge disappointment to all of us. We could have done without this dish.
5) OCTOPUS: I think this was one of the specials. This was good with the potatoes, but it wasn't that amazing.
6) PAELLA PATRIA: This was REALLY good, however, prepare for a wait (45 minutes) -- suggestion is to order this RIGHT when you get in.
7) HELADO DE CAFÉ CON CREMA DE ESPECIAS Y MERMELADA DE ACEITUNAS NEGRAS: This was okay, but wasn't the most amazing thing.

Between the three of us, I think we ordered a bit too much. With the paella, I would suggest taking maybe one or two dishes.

Otherwise, I had a great time here, and I would definitely come back here for some Spanish tapas."}
{"text":"Came here last week with my wife and friends. Very impressive looking space. Food was good but over priced for a place that is serving tapas. Go with the meats and paella if anything. Our waitress must have been new or something. Although she was nice her recommendations were weak. Drinks were overpriced, based simply on the beer prices which were $12+ for standard stuff.  Would I go back....maybe with my buddy who has a corporate expense account."}
{"text":"I've come here for personal and business dinners and I couldn't be happier for either occasion. The business event was a large group but there was plenty of food and incredible service. Dinner for 2? Amazing recommendations from my server and absolutely delicious food, yet again. Highly recommend this restaurant for a business dinner with clients or a nice date night. Pro tip: get the bacon wrapped dates...closest thing to heaven (imo)"}
{"text":"I went with a girlfriend for brunch on a Sunday where they have \"bottomless\" mimosas. We ordered FOUR dishes and when we were finished, the waitress told us we HAD to order more food to get another mimosa.  Obviously they don't know what bottomless means. I will make sure to tell everyone I know about my experience and also post this on all social platforms."}
{"text":"I booked this dinner for my 30th birthday and also to celebrate getting engaged earlier that day and I am sad to say that I was quite disappointed! I tried their paella at Taste of Toronto last year and had been wanting to go to the restaurant to try the whole dish. I came here for their paella only to be told that I need to wait 1.5 hours for it for an 8:30 reservation because all their pans are used up. They didn't tell me that when I booked my table. I could've appreciated the heads up. However we did try some of the other recommendations our waitress made. They were generally quite good and in the end we were quite full and satisfied. Food is tasty, not too salty. I would've loved to try the paella though. Ambience is nice but I found it a bit too noisy. May give the paella a try down the road but will probably have to make sure I go at an earlier time in order to secure a pan for paella~"}
{"text":"Way over priced for the quality and quantity of food that you get here. My GF had been wanting to go here for a while now so I decided to take her this year for her birthday. 

We ended up spending over $400 for 5 people (without alcohol) and here's the kicker, we brought in our own cake for her birthday and guess what, they charge you $5 a person for plating fees! RIDICULOUS! After spending that much money and they still need to charge me more for my own cake. I thought that they would at least would decorate each plate with some syrup or fruit or something but nope. All they did was slice it and put it on a plate. hahaha. What a joke! 

Here's my list of Good and bad: 
Good: 
- nice ambience
- great service

Bad:
- really pricey
- really small portions
- taste of food is nothing special
- charge to plate cake

I wouldn't recommend it to anyone I care about."}
{"text":"I love Tapas, so it's hard to disappoint me. The food here is delicious. We had:

Datiles (dates wrapped in bacon)
D.O. Murcia Al Vino - Goat cheese with toast
Coca De Hongos - Mushroom flatbread
Albondingas - Waygu Meatball
Paella Patria
Patatas Bravas

The most popular were the Datiles, the Coca De Hongos, and the Paella. Our table really loved those three dishes. The cheese and bread were amazing too--the bread was warm, buttery/salty. 

The red sangria was also very good

Atmosphere was nice, it has a beautiful interior. High ceilings and really intricate decor. I'd come back on a date, with a group of friends, or for a special occasion."}
{"text":"I am not a huge fan of King W but I am a big fan of Patria. I am an even bigger fan of sharing plates so I may have some bias.  

This Spanish tapas restaurant hits pretty much all the notes with a few exceptions, which I will review below. 

Service is good, proficient and not overly friendly because they are too busy to be too friendly but I don't want friendly, I want good and with this, they more than delver.   They are busy but you don't wait for anything, water, wine etc.  Service is a solid 5 + star. 

I have been a handful of times, most recently was for a table of 5 where we asked the server to bring an assortment of dishes.  After confirming likes and allergies, we were presented with a perfect mix of foods with one exception and one annoyance

The two paella's (1 seafood/1meat) were not good.   I don't know how else to put it other than that - they were not good.  Rice was not cooked properly.  Proteins in both dishes were way over cooked and they were missing the melding of flavours which make me love a good paella. 1/5 for this dish(es)

I had the Rioja Chardonnay by the half bottle and it was fabulous 

Last note - their lighting needs a revisit.   I appreciate how I look in dimmed lighting yet if it impedes ones ability to read the menu, then it may be a problem (I am old though so take this feedback as you may)

No upselling - thank you"}
{"text":"Ugh ersatz . Spain visits MooseJaw.
Calamari good . Rest no roots ;2nd rate execution. Uneven service. Try to be interesting usual too young wines.Some heat in the crowd but hard to be stimulated from Siberia"}
{"text":"This place is unbelievably good. I haven't been to a Spanish restaurant before but when I went here I felt kind of underdressed because everyone else was actually well put together, so my partner and I decided to sit at the bar to not look like two underdressed odd balls at a nice table.
The food was really good. The plates and the sizes are quite small actually, so don't expect to be full eating one dish.
However I highly recommend eating the fish because they cook it to perfection. It's moist and juicy, and regardless of the price I still ordered another one. Really good."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. It was my first tapas experience in Canada (I was fortunate enough to enjoy tapas on a visit to Spain).
I have to say the portions are decent, except for the cheese plates, I found them extremely small and unsatisfying. Definitely need a few plates if you are planning on sharing with friends.
One of the best tapas was definitely the bacon wrapped dates, they were amazing!!!
The octopus was dry, so I wouldn't recommend that.
However, the 24 month salted jambon was delicious and for the plates that we did enjoy, I would still give this place a good review, it just depends on what you are ordering.
We had a beat salad as well, which was good but not memorable.
All in all, this is a nice place for people looking for a trendy place for drinks and snacks. Don't go there starving, as you shouldn't be going to a tapas restaurant for a nice hardy meal.

The bathrooms were nice, beautiful white tile.

The service was great, very friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"The formula works... great food + great wine + great service + great atmosphere + beautiful waitress = fantastic evening. 

1) make reservations!
- slid into the last available table for 2 at 7pm. We were told we'd need to be out by 9pm, which normally wouldn't be a problem but we were told most guests stay 2-3hrs. We rolled out at 8:59pm.

2) expect to be impressed by:
- the food, which was extremely flavourful. The iberico ham-wrapped dates and the ham croquettes were delicious, as was the garlic shrimp.  
- the wine, which was sourced from every single region in Spain. The sommelier spent a considerable amount of time with us and obviously knows his way around a glass of wine (in the professional sense!). 
- the atmosphere, which was comfortable and refined at the same time. It was a bit loud but not intrusive.
-  the service. They bring you samples of wine if you're unsure about it, which isn't totally shocking but still is a nice attention to detail, particularly when many of the wines are from lesser-known producers from some of the lesser-known regions. 

3) expect to pay a fair amount for the amount you get.
- we shared three appetizers and each had two glasses of wine. The bill, with tip, was about $55/person."}
{"text":"Go for the seafood paella. Leave very impressed with the service of the staff. From accommodating our party of 6 (reservation is max of 5 but I took a chance anyway) by adding one more place setting to the booth to taking our coats/pictures (bachelorette party) and ensuring each tapas had enough for 6 people to try, I highly recommend this place. Seafood paella was my favorite but the other dishes we got were all great as well. I don't think you can go wrong with anyone you order"}
{"text":"The space was awesome. The outdoor area is great and the inside is decorated well. The service was wonderful too. However, the food was not that great. A lot of it was meant to be unique but we both felt it was overdone and I have had such better tapas (Cava) in the city and definitely elsewhere in other cities. The best item was the pigs ears and it was downhill from there. From the shrimp to the pasta to the brussel sprouts everything was salty, overly singed (burnt) or just not flowing together. Wouldn't recommend going back despite the nicest waitress and a beautiful spot."}
{"text":"The place was a bit hard to find but the way it was tucked away behind the main building with an exterior patio that was candlelit and cozy was great. Our server was a big help. We came in not really knowing what to order, what to share, portion sizes, and after asking her about 20 questions, we had her choose our food as we weren't too picky. Everything was very tasty, flavourful, and nicely presented. The rib-eye was a tad on the dry side, but delicious nonetheless. Worth visiting at least once, but it is on the pricey side, so be prepared."}
{"text":"As the 275th reviewer of a restaurant with a near-perfect score, it's safe to say that the numbers speak for themselves. I'll add my quick review though because it truly was THAT good. 

DECOR: Luxurious, dim cozy lighting, and a chic ambience. Not so loud that you need to scream to be heard.

STAFF: Our waitress was friendly and knowledgeable about the menu, and suggested excellent wine pairings for our meal.

FOOD: A sucker for fancy finger-food, 3 of us split an array of tapas including the house marinated olives (aceitunas), chorizo, coca de hongos (flatbread with black truffles, wild mushrooms, goat cheese, and herbs), queso frito (a fried cheese with honey, walnuts, and figs), albondigas (waygu meatballs with a spicey tomato sauce and manchego cheese), brussels bravas (brussel sprouts with aioli & chorizo) and patatas bravas (crispy potatoes with spicy tomato sauce and a fried egg on top). 

I know this sounds like an obscene amount of food for three people, but it really wasn't overkill at all. The dishes are actually quite small - as tapas tend to be.

Everything was delicious. The chorizo was maybe the only 'average' thing we got. The mushroom flatbread was decadent but light, the fried cheese was sinful, and the meatballs were AMMMMAZING. Seriously, order them. I definitely could have eaten the entire patatas bravas to myself too.

PRICE: It's no secret that Patria errs on the higher price point of Toronto dining, but I think it's worth it. You're paying for the experience of dining in a posh environment with attentive service and uniquely prepared food. I will definitely be returning and recommending to others."}
{"text":"So, went to this place today for dinner. Came in with high hopes. Ordered the most popular food items as recommended by the waitress. The bacon wrapped dates were passable, the porcini mushroom croquet tasted like mozzarella cheese sticks, the paella was so salty to the point that it was not edible, the Brussels sprouts were aite, subway made better meat balls than these wagyu balls, the flatbread was drenched in oil and salt. Overall, really liked service and the water, food was totally 
Trash/10. This is my first and probably only yelp review. I'm never been to a place this bad. Feeling disappointed and betrayed. 

Sincerely,
Rowlan Shoo"}
{"text":"The design of the restaurant amazing but the food experience
was confusing. Apps were outstanding but the Patria seafood paella was below any of my standards for good food. It was bland, very fishy and I had ask for salt and pepper which is unacceptable for a restaurant of that scale and for a paella that was priced at $55. We complained about the paella but the server did not seem to care at all. Maybe because of the fact that it is a King West place with lots of tourists and a never ending clientelle. It was a birthday party and they knew about it and did not do anything to make the exeperience more special. The restaurant was very loud and we had to yell at each other to be able to hear each other. I would not go back and I would not recommend it to my friends or a special event dinner."}
{"text":"Another \"mixed emotions\"... If you guide yourself for the crowd, Patria, seems to be 'the place' in Toronto. Don't get fooled my friends, it is not. For a guy who lived in Spain for 2 years, I can tell, this place has all the ingredients to be the best tapas place in Toronto, and probably in Canada, but it fails on the execution. Just to start with, the place is hidden. When I mean hidden, I mean: \"you better know where it is or you miss it\". When you find it, you transpose the door and you will see one of the best restaurants set up's in the city. I cannot say the same thing about the personnel though, but as I always say, I will pretend is their \"first day on the job and they are trying to learn\". I had a little bit of a wait till I could seat at the bar. I checked the drinks menu. Overpriced does not make any justice... it is WAY overpriced, compared to similar places in the area. They serve 3 and 5 oz glasses and the are priced as 6 and 9 oz respectively. Anyway, I took some 'decent' white wine and after that, some Tio Pepe Jerez which was very dry (the way I like it). I decided to go for tapas. Gambas al Ajillo and lamb meatballs to start with. As the name says it, Gambas al Ajillo (which means, garlic shrimp), has to be 'garlicky'. Well, not really. Just 3 pieces of shrimp sautéed in olive oil, two slices of garlic and a lot of parsley. Forgettable at the minimum. About the meatballs the only thing I have to say is, guys, the tomato sauce was fantastic. Tasted perfectly with that country style bread. Well, if the only good thing about the meatballs is the sauce, that tells you something. I later got the Ham Croquettes. Literally the best of the 3 tapas I got, but 3 small cylindrical pieces of 1 inch each at 10 bucks, is kind of \"aggressive\". Bottom line, great place for a nice date or a small night out with friends. But, tell me.. with Jacobs just round the corner, where you will spend almost the same but you will be eating the best steak in town, will you give this place a try? mmmmm......"}
{"text":"I organized a dinner for 13 girls and the food and service was amazing. I called ahead of time and they told me for parties 10 or more you had to order from a prix fixe menu. Usually I don't like that but the menu selections they offered were reasonable and offered a wide variety to accommodate a large party. The food was well timed as it came out where we could enjoy what we were eating without it brought out all at the same time. The sangria was great. My favorite were the croquettes and the rib eye. I was a little confused who our waiter actually was as it seemed everyone worked as a team which was fine until we needed something I wasn't sure who was the head waiter. Other than that everything was on point. Every person in our party had nothing but rave reviews and getting 13 women to approve isn't easy."}
{"text":"Excellent Spanish Tapas ! Trendy and excellent service. Favourites include ceviche, Datiles, Queso Frito, Croquetas de Setas, Patatas Bravas, Empanadas, Garbanzos. One of my favourite spots in the summer - great outdoor patio."}
{"text":"Between the two of us we shared a pitcher of sangria, croquettes de jamòn, pan con tomate and the chicken paella and couldn't finish no matter how badly we wanted to. The first bite of the crispy chicken on the paella was incredible. Finished with the churros which were surprisingly and deliciously salty (like a salted caramel). Service was great, restaurant is beautiful and tucked away from a main street so it's quiet and intimate. Bathroom is located up a staircase, as a note to anyone with accessibility needs."}
{"text":"Patria was an indulgent meal for us while visiting Toronto.  But we were celebrating our anniversary, and it was worth every penny.  

The restaurant was packed on a Saturday night.  I'd made reservations in advance of our trip for 9:00 p.m.  We were seated immediately upon arrival, and our waiter was friendly and polite.  

It is a little bit noisy inside Patria, but I liked that I could talk to and hear my husband without concern that someone else would be able to overhear.  Not that we were discussing anything top-secret, but overlapping conversations are like nails on a chalkboard to me.

We started with a pitcher of the red sangria.  The service at Patria is unique in that they tend to every little thing, which can be endearing or annoying.  Our waiter was prompt in refilling our glasses, but because I was gulping down the sangria, my glass got refilled more often than my husband's, so I felt a bit guilty for drinking all of that sangria!  They also serve the first plate of paella to each person at the table.

I recommend the paella, especially if you have never eaten paella before.  I'm generally not a fan of chorizo, but I enjoyed this dish and especially this ingredient.  Most of the chunks of lamb were tender were delicious as well.  My only complaint about this dish, and Patria, is that there were some rubbery, chewy pieces of lamb that I had to spit into a napkin.  It was disappointing that there was more than one piece of inedible lamb considering the price of the dish ($49).

If you order the paella, order it as soon as you can, since it takes approximately 45 minutes to prepare.  Also, don't order a TON of tapas as well, since the paella is filling and like a meal in itself.  

We opted for the Bacon Dates with Manchengo Cheese and the Ham Croquettes (a special that evening) in addition to the paella.  For two moderately hungry adults, this was plenty of food.

We ended our meal with the Churros with Dulce de Leche sauce.  YUM.  

For an upscale restaurant, I was surprised at some of the younger crowd here.  In the ladies room, a group of five or six young girls were crowding together to take selfies in the mirror.  I don't know if I found this adorable or appalling, since it reminded me of myself ten years ago, taking photos in shady nightclubs in Chicago - the kind of places with bathroom attendants, clogged toilets, and cheap perfume.  Patria may be upscale, but I guess you can't expect the patrons to reflect that.

Our meal at Patria was probably the longest ever, which we didn't realize until we returned to our hotel.  The cook time of the paella probably had something to do with that.  The atmosphere is just that comfortable.  For a fancy spot with some seriously cosmopolitan, dinner-jacket wearing Yuppies, I felt comfortable lounging here and even ordering dessert when it became apparent that it was probably past closing time."}
{"text":"First time here and loved everything from the prix fixe menu. Every bite was a delight, great suggestions from the bar, and overall a night I will not forget!"}
{"text":"Came in on a Wednesday night and it was packed (reservations are probably a good bet). Ordered a few appetizers, cocktails and two Paellas. Overall I had a great experience. Service was prompt with regular checkups and water refills. Our food arrived in a timely fashion. Seating was a bit tight, but I think they are trying to mimic an European style layout. Overall on the pricey side.

We ordered the Paella Patria and Paella de Carrilada. Both were fantastic but very different. The Patria was very traditional seafood dish while the other one was quite unique and had more intense flavours. 

All our apps were server recommendations so I don't remember their names but were all fantastic. Definitely recommend asking for the popular dishes."}
{"text":"One of the only but definitely best Spanish resto's I tried in Toronto :O

We actually got lost coming here because you needed to turn a small hidden corner going down King and it was very easy to miss. In fact, we went into the condo right beside the restaurant by accident.. oops!

However, once you stumble into Patria, you'll find that the ambiance is beautiful.  The interior is filled with vintage paintings and a soft candle-lit dimness that permeates the restaurant.  

Our waiter was extremely friendly with armfuls of tattoos and piercings, there was also a bearded server who looked pretty cool :P  Would've loved to make some interesting convos with the staff there, they all looked like quite the characters.  Anyways, our waiter was a total sweetheart and helped us pick the dishes to try - since the only thing I knew to order was the paella.. which he also helped pick.  :3

Onto the amazing food!
1) Pimientos Rellenos De Buey
Piquillo Peppers + Oxtail + Manchego ($14)
This came in a set of two.  The piquillo pepper was completely cooked and its soft interior wrapped around the tender oxtail.  Our server suggested that we order bread to go with this dish so that we could taste the sauce better, mhm.  Very appetizing start to our meal :) 

2)Dátiles Con Tocino Ibérico
Dates + Ibérico Bacon + Manchego + Guindillas ($9)
I absolutely LOVED this small plate.  Who knew bacon and dates go together so well?  The sweetness of the dates was balanced perfectly by the salty bacon flavour.  I barely tasted the manchego but I think this dish was culinary genius :3  I'd eat 20 of these each day if I can.............. 

3)Paella De Bogavante Y Gambas
Lobster + Gulf Shrimp + Chorizo + Peas ($55)
This came in a fairly large pot which was shared between two people.  I loved the chorizo the most in this dish - I think I might've picked 80% of it hehe.  Lobster and shrimp were fresh but I actually didn't find them to be too special. However, the white rice was cooked deliciously - perfectly moist and perfectly seasoned... I think there was saffron too.  I like the rice more than the seafood!  

4) Churros Con Dulce De Leche
Spanish Doughnuts + Cinnamon Sugar + Dulce de Leches ($6)
I REALLY enjoyed the cinnamon sugar-coated churros, but the chocolatey-caramel (dulce de leches?) was a bit off for me.  The sweetness was tainted by a saltiness I can't pinpoint - which didn't go well with the cinnamon sugar.  However, still a great dessert that melted my sweet tooth *_*

No doubt I'd be open to come back to Patria, I'd be up for trying the brunch for sure.  Mucho amor (Y) (Y) So good!"}
{"text":"We visited Patria on a Sunday evening thinking it may be not so busy - think again. We're lucky to seat us at a table as opposed to the bar. 

We ordered the following items which each course was better than the last:

Blistered Peppers + Sea Salt
Dates + Ibérico Bacon + Manchego + Guindillas
Baked Brussel Sprouts
CHARCUTERIE - Ibérico Lomo + Ibérico Chorizo + Jamón Serrano + Morcón Salami
Prime Beef Striploin + Padron Peppers + Crispy Potato

Due to the volume that night we were told it would be an approx 75min wait time for the paella. So we opted out and ordered the above (as we were too hungry to wait). I will definitely be returning to Patria to try the paella...

Additionally, the service was impeccable and they had a nice wine section as well. I would highly recommenced this place to anyone."}
{"text":"The atmosphere ia great, amazing layout and great ambience. 

However,

I ordered a drink and when I was just about finished I saw a rather large insect in my drink. When I notified the waitress not only was she not concerned she didn't do anything to help me. She continued to explain to me that it must have fallen into my drink from one of their fixtures. She tried to bring me another one but we were ready to leave and pay the bill. Regardless it was disgusting. This is a great indication of their client service, which is horrible.

I wouldn't recommend to a friend and I most likely won't return. Which is such a shame because it is a lovely lovely place."}
{"text":"Great tapas restaurant with an exceptional paella. Small plates were also excellent with a good medley of both vegetarian and pork options. Ambiance is good for an intimate business meeting, but can get loud at times. Sherry selection could be enhanced. Prices are very fair. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I  bookmarked this place a few months ago due to all the hype but my experience was disappointing in one word.
The place was extremely loud and our table was very small. For starter we had some heese and also flatbread. The portions were very small but taste good.  
We ordered one of the famous paella as the main. It took them more than one hour to bring the food....very frustrating!  I didn't like the main food. Salty rice with some mussels and fish... 
The Service was acceptable but the price is really unreasonable.  140 for two... I don't think I will ever come back."}
{"text":"Really tasty, well-executed Spanish tapas. This was my 2nd time in 5+ years and things are better than I remembered.

Highlights:
- perfectly grilled whole Branzino fish. True - it's hard to screw up Branzino, but this was especially good
- foie gras paella
- figs wrapped in bacon - so simple but so good!!
- patatas bravas - made even better with a fried egg!

Not so great:
- server forgot our order of cauliflower. When asked about it at the end of the meal, he apologized but didn't offer anything - a good server would offer to bring it comp'ed or comp another similar dish
- getting picky with the service again - we were sharing between 4 ppl. When dishes come in quantities of 3, a very good restaurant would offer you one more at a nominal charge so it's easier to split. Given that this is a tapas place that is meant for sharing, I would have expected this.

Portions are not very big but the food is rich.

Overall it was a pricey but enjoyable meal, with some suggested service improvements, hence reason for one less star."}
{"text":"Loved my experience here. Server was attentive and had helped us pick out dishes per recommendations. Food was delicious and also presentation was great. 

Only complaint was that it was hard to find the location and paella was not really an option with only two people!"}
{"text":"A romantic ambiance, slightly on the louder side, and service was great.  The wine was pouring all night.  One very important thing to note is that the paella takes 45 mins to prepare, so be sure to order that first.  Almost all of the appetizer has cheese in it, which is not very good for someone who is lactose intolerant.  Overall, the food was just a-ok, nothing special.  The one thing that I thought was a treat was the bacon wrapped cheese.

For the price, I think that we could have gone to somewhere better.  I just didn't think that the the food was all that great.  I have nothing particularly great to say about the paella, it was just okay.  I think I've had better paella at street festivals."}
{"text":"Loved their food. Ambience and staff were great as well! Big fan of their resto's - Byblos & Weslodge."}
{"text":"A fine dining experience! Exquisite service, a stunning dining room, fantastic wine selection and the hefty price tag to go with it. 

First the decor - this place is beautiful. Floor to ceiling windows, rustic and beautiful light fixtures, lovely place settings, every detail in this restaurant works perfectly to create a memorable meal. On a Saturday night on the February long weekend, it was bustling but we felt 100% catered to and cared for by every member of the staff. It was quite amazing how it seems every person that worked there took care of us - whether bringing food, clearing plates, folding napkins when guests went to the (ever elusive and always appreciated upstairs Toronto) bathroom, clearing crumbs, bringing drinks, we were never neglected. 

We had a party of 6 so had an excellent chance to try a good portion of the menu. Having a home in Spain I have had a lot of Spanish food and I must say this is the most authentic Spanish food I've had in Toronto. From pan con tomate con manchego, artichoke and manchego appetizer, to the clam pasta I had that blew my mind, to the lobster a la plancha, I appreciated the authenticity of the food. My carnivore friends drooled (and ordered a second round) of the proscuitto wrapped dates, shared chorizo, serrano ham, olives, side rapini, side asparagus, and several other dishes I can't recall. Everyone was pleased and impressed with the food.

I had had the pleasure of meeting the sommelier Derek at the Midfield a couple of weeks prior so knew I was in good hands for wine choice. A very dense list with excellent descriptions, I put myself in his hands and loved both wines we had as did my companions. There is something for everyone in this list even without Derek's masterful recommendations.

While i have no criticisms of this place, my friends and I had a conversation afterwards about whether we would return and the consensus was probably not. It is an experience worth having and we're all glad we went but it's quite expensive and seems more appropriate for a special occasion than a new favourite but its definitely worth that visit. I think I'd like to take my mom there as I think she'd love its Spanish familiarity but beyond that I think it'll be more of a happy memory."}
{"text":"We came here to celebrate for my graduation.
We made a reservation a week ago in order to secured our seats.

The waitress is nice and friendly. She guided us through the menu and we did not feel rushed for our whole meal. 

The food are average and frankly, they taste quite salty. I understand it helps customers to order more drinks and hence boost their revenue but the total amount of sodium the food contains isn't a joke and it kinda cuts off our appetite. 

However, we are still interested to come here again for a second try for their great atmosphere and nice service."}
{"text":"I was here tonight for a business dinner. Great ambience, very tasty food - we had a selection of tapas - the most memorable being the dates wrapped in Iberico pork and manchego with pepper, and some paella. All washed down with a nice Rioja. 

I'd definitely come back with a bigger group of friends to pig out. I particularly appreciated the professionalism of Patria's operations. I made a reservation via email and got a very timely confirmation with follow up phone call. Our table was ready when we arrived and the service was friendly and efficient. Food came out at a good pace as well. I'd recommend Patria for business and for pleasure. Tonight turned out to be both."}
{"text":"Attentive and patient service, expansive menu of tantalizing tapas! Looking left and right, you can't help but want to try everything. Every sniff leaves you wanting more. Cannot go wrong with the iberico. Great selection of imported wines/beers. Also, surprisingly fair pricing. Beautiful setting. I was blown away. I will make a point to stop here twice, maybe three times per year (and that's a compliment)."}
{"text":"This place was AMAZING!!! We went here on our first night in Toronto and ordered a lot of tapas, or favorite being the octopus, and everything was delightful. We ordered the seafood paella, which I highly recommend. The service was nice, food was great, and the ambiance was very beautiful. I highly recommend this place and will come back next time I'm in Toronto!"}
{"text":"overpriced and loud sums up my impression of Patria. $60 Paella (lobster and shrimp) was probably the best paella money can buy but for a party of 2, it's probably not worth the money. It's a much better proposition if it is shared between 4 people. Would I spend $60 again for this humble rice dish - probably not. The restaurant itself is tucked away on the back of an alley and not very visible from the street. We went on a tue night and the place was absolutely buzzing with activity. The service is spot on given how busy it was. We shared a few tapas and the best memory that lingers on is the octopus and potato which was very delectable but too small a portion for the price we paid. We also had the gambas with parsley and the fried calamari - again very pricey for the humility of these dishes. For dessert we had the dulce de leche was which a good way to finish. I personally think spanish cuisine should not be so expensive since it's so simple for the most part. If you have never had spanish food, this is probably a very pricey introduction to it :("}
{"text":"We went as a group of 8 tonight and we're having a good time until the end of the night. We had a bill of 1507 which included 18% gratuity. We were expecting this type of bill as we orders bottles of wine and lots of food. We thought we had given the waiter 1550 when we left but saw him chasing us out of the restaurant claiming we are short $7. I'm surprised to have been chased out for $7 as our tip was over $250 but I guess every restaurant counts their pennies differently?"}
{"text":"I chose this very well known restaurant that I've heard many amazing reviews about for my best friend's birthday. The enterance is definitely well hidden - we walked back and forth couple times before a hostess saw us wandering around and greated us inside.

Our server was super attentive, went through the menu and gave some recommendations. It wasn't too easy for us to settle for couple dishes we want to order. The variety on the menu was amazing, different meats, seafood, and veggie combos to choose from. 

Food came slowly, one by one. They were all so very tasty. The environment was perfect for a small celebration, anniversary, or any sort of date night. People here seemed festive and cheerful. However, the food does not match up to the price tag.

Make reservations. Street parking available."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner on a Saturday night with a friend and the food was amazing. We had the seafood paella, a cheese and chorizo board, fried eggplant and octopus with potatoes. Really good flavors, attention to detail in the food and in the warm, friendly service. We were a walk-in at 7pm and were seated right away, which is a pleasant surprise."}
{"text":"We came here on a Friday and were able to snag a seat at the bar right away just as a pair vacated their spot. I can't vouch for the quality of dinner as this was our fourth stop of the night, but the drinks, desserts, and service were absolutely top-notch. My friend liked their scotch selection - apparently you can't find Macallan 18 years by the bottle in Toronto anymore - and I would absolutely come back for a more substantial meal just because of the ambiance. Think dark, massive oil paintings, Edison bulbs, and Spanish charm. Having studied the language for a couple semesters, it was nice to know I retained enough to decipher the cocktail names. The bartenders are funny and attentive, and table service was thoughtful. The Santiago cake is assembled for you upon serving; house-made ice cream, warm custard, and soft lemony goodness. Go try it now."}
{"text":"Went to Patria on a Saturday night for dinner.  The food was very very good.  We ordered the steak tartare, mushroom croquettes, seafood paella, and brussel sprouts.  We finished off with the hazelnut mousse and obviously the churros, which come hot and fresh out of the fryer.  I would say everything was excellent, but would probably avoid the mousse when we return - it was just a bit too rich for my taste.

The overall experience was excellent - and I would highly recommend this place for groups or couples.  Just be prepared for the volume levels if you go during the dinner rush - it can be a bit much at times, especially if you're next to a table of middle-aged wine drinkers ;)"}
{"text":"What a great spot. Tapas style dishes, I definitely suggest the bacon wrapped dates and goat cheese (If you like goat cheese). The service was awesome, and the drinks were delicious. Great for a weekend night out!"}
{"text":"Highly over rated.
I don't get what all the fuss is about. 
The food is mediocre. It's not memorable and definitely not \"by far the best meal ever\". 
It's close to authentic, but it's a complete rip off of the Jose Garces style. Maybe it works in Toronto where there aren't many good spanish restaurants yet, but try placing this restaurant in any other major city and it would be a complete flop.

I'm pretty sure that's it's merely Charles Kabouth's popularity that draws in the large crowd and hype around this restaurant. I will say though that two dishes stood out to me, the chocolate pudding and the tomato bread. The simplicity of the dishes is what made them stand out. All the rest were just ok. 

The area this restaurant falls extremely short is service. The hostesses are cold, the servers are out to lunch and forgetful. It's not attentive service at all and they are completely missing the little details. I'm not sure why their staff haven't been trained well in a city where service is generally very good (relative to other cities)."}
{"text":"i've been to Patria a couple times before but my most recent visit fell pretty short. we had :
-dates wrapped in bacon - too sweet
-seafood paella - no taste
-brussel sprouts - too burnt
-gulf shrimp - the only thing i liked but credits go to the shrimp itself only because it's my favourite type of seafood lol
-rib eye with roasted garlic - there was a whole roasted garlic on the side thats supposed to be eaten with the meat but it actually did nothing for the rib eye
-churros - too hard
-fried milk - aka no taste fried gelatin

i would not come back because the food is expensive but not delicious. the service was fine i guess"}
{"text":"Tapas has always been my favorite! this settlement definitely offer that great dining experience. Can't wait to come back again for paella!"}
{"text":"Mixed reviews on this place and I understand why. On one hand, the food tastes great, the service is awesome, the space has a wonderful ambiance and it's really easy to enjoy yourself here. We ordered a variety of small dishes to share and were quite happy with everything, particularly the oxtail-stuffed peppers, the tartar, and the meatballs. The paella was fresh and tasty, and presented beautifully at the table.
Then there's the other side of the coin. For what you're getting, the food is on the pricey side and the markup on the wine list is borderline offensive. Overall the restaurant has taken a simple, casual, traditionally inexpensive style of cuisine and rendered a perverse, King West, over-priced, somewhat pretentious Toronto version.
When you go to one of Charles' restaurants there's often a simple equation for success. Phenomenal décor, a sophisticated, trendy atmosphere, great service, staple dishes that are executed perfectly, and the rest is just pretty good. Overall the common theme is consistency, and this place delivers as far as all of those things go. Wouldn't say it's the best tapas in Toronto, but it has a place."}
{"text":"This place has changed my life. Literally. I had a dinner interview here in November. (You can scroll down to the end of the review if you want to know how it was a life-changing experience, and also if you don't minds spoilers) 

My anxiety obviously insulated all of my taste buds during the dinner. Don't you worry though, I still managed to eat a lot. It's my coping mechanism. 

Anyhow, the food looked and I'm sure it tasted amazing and our server was wonderful. They have a mezzanine which can booked for private functions and fits about 20 people. Low ceiling, but very cute decor.

In case you're wondering, I ended having a lot of fun and I secured a position with the firm. Will definitely come back in less stressful circumstances."}
{"text":"Just try their paella. A very nice environment to eat and chat with friends. A bit on the expensive side for day to day but perfect for special occasions. Amazing jamon and wine selection"}
{"text":"I'd hate to say it but I'm a little suspect of all of these five star reviews. I can't properly review this place because I was only here for a drink but here are my initial impressions. That said, I think this place needs to be taken down a notch. At the end of the day, it's tapas. 

VIBE 
Club impresario Charles Kabouth is behind this operation so it's going to be a scene here --starting with its clandestine location behind Weslodge (oh, surprise! we couldn't get in there). The interiors are gorgeous and obviously a lot of detail went into it.  I'm a fan of the bar and the bar seats are quite comfortable! You'll definitely want to stay a while. 

 The hostess was a bit of a snot. We were just coming into the bar and she didn't even greet us - she just kind of waved us over to the bar. Another thing: I've had friends trying to call to get a reservation before and he had quite a bit of trouble doing so. The bar staff were much more receptive. And surprise! Everyone working here looks like a model. 

WE DRANK
Sangria. It's expensive, yes but it's boozy and you need to take your time with it. It was very good Sangria. Kind of reminds me of what Nyood was doing a few years ago. Average cocktail prices here are $15. 

OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK 
Good sangria. I'm not sure about paying $30 for imported iberico ham (from what I've seen/heard). It's overpriced. That said,  I'm curious to try to their tapas. But if you want to impress and be part of the \"scene,\" then this is a good place to do so."}
{"text":"I don't consider many restaurants a 5 but this place was fantastic. The service was perfect, the ambiance spot on, and the food was excellent. We had the house olives, the fried artichoke salad, the oxtail stuffed piquillo peppers (a must) and the seafood paella. They even removed the mussels for me which I hugely appreciated. We also indulged in a couple of pitchers of sangria. Great place and I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"patria isn't the usual type of restaurant i go to often. it's a splurge place for me.

the décor is pleasant and the patio is a wonderful place to spend a few hours. 

the kitchen is skilled and the dishes are of high quality. everything that i've tried on the menu is very tasty. compared to other spanish restaurants that i've been to in toronto, it's certainly in the top three. 

the price is high(-ish), but that's pretty obvious before entering. it's not like they're trying to fool anybody.

the service is overall just mediocre - some servers are great and some are meh. for a high-end restaurant, that's not really acceptable."}
{"text":"The food is tasty. But it is not cheap either. We didn't drink I think the bill was around 70 each person. The food meets the expectations of the price you would pay in Toronto but nothing beyond. The Spanish paella had some generous sea food which was good, but I feel the rice lacked flavor. There's only goat or sheep milk cheese, no cow milk cheese. I respect that it is more common in Spain to have those, but just to warn you they are all on the soft side. Liked the date with bacon. We had some five or six other things to share but I don't remember what I ordered. The waitress was nice but suggested more food than what we could finish and I was stuffed in the end. I'm a big eater. I would not mind coming back if a friend suggests but it's a meh for myself. My friends enjoyed it a lot."}
{"text":"Fabulous atmosphere 
Its huge but you'll still need a booking
Tapas are a great way to go but the seafood paella is good also."}
{"text":"Love tapas! Great wine selection, patio is great-- not on the street, so you can enjoy dining al fresco without onlookers. 
Went back a second time and service was exceptional!
Grilled octopus was excellent!"}
{"text":"I did love the atmosphere and ambiance of the place. Our table was a bit small so it was hard to eat when everything was coming out - but that can be overlooked given the food was so tasty. Noise level was minimal and I could have a great conversation without having yell across the table. The food we ordered: croquetas de Setas (mushroom filled), paella , charcuterie plate ,  queso frito, seafood paella and octopus special. The most underwhelming dish was the octopus which slightly lacked flavor. Everything else was phenomenal filled with beautiful flavors. I tried the Gitana drink (usually I like bubbly or wine but am looking to try different flavors) and i found the drink a touch too sweet.  Highly recommend this restaurant - I will be a returning customer. Price wise - it's not incredibly cheap as portions are on the tinier side, but all very worth it. For two females dining, we had one dish too many as we were quite full at the end of the evening and the small paella was quite filling."}
{"text":"Patria is simply the best tapas place I have tried in Toronto.  Having been to Patria several times for dinners with colleagues, I have tried a reasonable subset of the menu ... enough to qualify me to review the restaurant.

Patria is the sort of place that seems like an excellent spot for a dinner for two but also an equally effective place for a large gathering.  The massive space has its share of both quiet corners and expansive tables. The tapas menu is extensive, with great vegetarian choices.  The salted marcona almonds complemented by the manchego starter are a smart way to start your meal.  I would also recommend the fried goat cheese with walnut and fig, and manchego croquettes.  You also have their paellas and a variety of drinks to choose from.

Your search for great Spanish food in Toronto should end here, unless you have time to spare, or know something I don't."}
{"text":"I found the food and ambience 5*. The service, I have mixed feelings. I should preface this by saying that my partner doesn't drink alcohol, I drink a glass of wine on the odd occasion out for dinner. Patria's servers should be made aware that there ARE people who want to go out for a nice dinner in the King west area but not drink. Interestingly, we had the same experience at Weslodge. Almost dismissed when declining alcohol. I am also Celiac so no gluten at our table either. :)

Service
Hostess was friendly and welcoming. The two servers we had spiked my opinion of the service way down. The people running the food to the table were friendly as was the manager who thanked us on his way by. The first person we spoke to told us the \"migas\" were not gluten free when I asked for some direction on the menu to meet my dietary restrictions. Then left us for our own server. The second one..insincere, dismissive and snooty over  a table not wanting an expensive cocktail or bottle of wine (I did order a 3 oz glass). She insisted that the afore mentioned \"migas\" were gluten free (by that point I had googled them and determined it was highly unlikely.) We ordered our beverages (my wine and carafe if sparkling water). She was back almost immediately with the beverages, dropped them on the table, turned on her heel and left. We then waited awhile for her return to take our order. We ordered 5 plates, knowing they were small but also knowing our appetites with rich food.( Origin always leaves a menu for the option to order more if needed). She was very aggressive in insisting we should order more then seemed annoyed when we said we'd order more if we were still hungry. The food was paced nicely, no complaints there. We ordered dessert and coffee. My cappuccino arrived with a cookie that I promptly removed from the plate and gave my partner. Our oh so very charming server witnessed this, giggled and said \"oops\". Because it had been on my spoon I then didn't use the spoon. My opinion of her did not improve when she dropped the wrong bill off and disappeared again at which point we had to flag down another person to get it fixed. 

Food
I would love to use the Spanish names but I can't remember them :) so...
The garlic basil prawns were large, flavourful and perfectly cooked.
The selection of cured meat. Very tasty but I agree with another poster's opinion. Too thin and meagre for price.
Manchego, pepper stuffed dates wrapped in bacon. They were delicious but could be executed a little better. These have the potential to have the perfect blend of salty, sweet, hot and sharpness from the cheese. We felt the manchego was a wee bit over powered. 
Peppers stuffed with oxtail and covered with finely grated manchego were perfection. 
Chocolate pudding with a blown sugar candy filled with high quality olive oil and sprinkled with sea salt. The combination of the rich chocolate pudding with the grassy rich olive oil and salt. WOWOWOW. Highlight of evening. 

I'm giving 4 stars because of the poor service resulting from our server with caveat that everyone/everything else was 5*."}
{"text":"Amazing ambiance and it has a great vibe. Food was good but not over the top inspiring. Good choices of tapas and paired well with the wine selection. Good place for a date night."}
{"text":"Always good food and great service. 

We have been here many times and it never disappoint. The paella is a must here! We ordered the lobster paella this time around. It so flavourful with loads of lobster and shrimp with perfectly cooked rice. It's a bit steep at $75 for a large but it's sufficient portion for 5 people. Their seafood is a bit cheaper at $55. We ordered a bunch of dishes to share and everything was so delicious! The fried eggplant and chorizo ball was super crunchy and flavourful. The foie gras burger just melted in our mouth and the Brussels sprouts was definitely worth fighting for.  For dessert, we ordered the churros, coffee ice cream with wafer and the chocolate pudding. The churros were everyone's favourite. 

Our server was really friendly but was slow at time at refilling our water and wine at times.  I understand it's a Friday night and our server had a big area to cover so we cut him some slacks."}
{"text":"For me, this place lived up to the hype. The service, food and ambiance were all excellent. Our server did a very good job at accommodating our needs (i.e. Large group, babies) and the food came out in a timely manner and was hot. The flavours were also on point as everything blended nicely. We particularly enjoyed the steak with freshly crushed garlic and the paella was well worth the wait. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Must try: Patria Paella

My question is, can I give you a fair review of our food when our food never came? So yes, my rating is based on our overall experience, not the food per se.

Our experience here started off well enough with the waitress being able to accommodate our request to sit outside and the menu suggestions she provided due to our food restrictions. 

The Patria paella was pretty good, the seafoods were really fresh and flavorful, and my boyfriend raved about the texture of the rice (especially the slightly browned bits scraped off the pan). Like I said, off to a great start since that's what we came here for!

The queso frites was also nice, think goat cheese nicely fried with a crispy crust, drizzled with honey, walnuts and figs. It goes well with the red sangria.

And that's where it ended. Like, literally ended. Where are the rest of our food?!! After waiting about 15 minutes, we asked our waitress and she explained that there is a backlog in the kitchen and no food is coming out... Ok fine. Maybe I don't know how kitchen works but the table beside us who came way after us (after we almost finished our paella), got all their foods and pretty much all at once too. 

Then finally, the bread we ordered came out, and we just gave each other a look. Two slices of sourdough bread, with diced tomato and olive oil... Took 45 minutes? Also is bread not supposed to come out before the main course? It definitely left a sour taste in my mouth. Oh btw, Pan con Tomate, while she made it sound amazing, was really just what I said, bread, tomato, olive oil, nothing special, don't bother.

By this point we really just didn't want to wait anymore, apparently it was going to take 15 more minutes for our calamari to come. So we asked for the bill, which is obviously quite pricey for the amount and quality of food and drinks. The paella was the highlight, but I have had better for less.

So overall, very bad experience. Thanks for almost ruining our anniversary, Patria. Maybe it's a one off thing for you and clearly you have good reviews, so if it's all the same to you, I will not be visiting again."}
{"text":"Fantastic food service and ambience. Totally worth the visit to venture Spanish cuisine. The lamb paella was made to perfection. The meat was tender, juicy and well flavored. In addition, the meal was greatly complemented by very attentive service, attending to your every need. It is definitely a memorable night."}
{"text":"Everyone raves about Patria but we just had an okay experience. Came here on Valentine's Day weekend with my boyfriend and had high hopes for this restaurant. Ordered a variety of plates and drinks but left feeling a bit unsatisfied. We enjoyed the charcuterie plate that had a bit of everything with an order of Pan con Tomate (essentially bread with tomato spread). My boyfriend also liked the dates with bacon but then again, he likes almost everything with bacon in it. The Porcini Croquetas, Cauliflower Asada, Brussel Bravas, and Bomba con Salsa Brava were good but fairly uninspiring although not terrible by any means. Nothing to rave about. We did, however, both enjoy the Pigs Ears. Something new for us and deliciously flavourful and crunchy. 

We had to wait awhile for the food to come. I think the charcuterie and drinks were served fairly promptly but it was another 20-30 minutes before any other dishes came out. We noticed that the table of girls next to us that waited the same amount of time for their food was offered a free dish of olives and such. Nothing was offered to us, not even an apology, but perhaps our waiter did not find us as appealing as the table of ladies... 

Atmosphere is good although quite loud and in a convenient location on King West. Maybe we ordered the wrong dishes - I would try the paella - but considering the price (total was $113 before tip) and the very small portion sizes, I doubt we'll be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Definitely a 4 star restaurant! 

Firstly, this place is absolutely beautiful, the restaurant seems massive, it has high ceilings but still achieves a warm and romantic atmosphere. The ambiance is really great, especially on a cold night, you feel like you've been transported to a cool vacation spot. The food is also really good!

We ordered a number of dishes, and I wasn't particularly disappointed in any of them, but some were definitely better than others. The ambiance, like I noted was excellent, but on an absolutely freezing night we were seated very closely to one of the entrances and the breeze kept hitting us every time someone opened the door, which was quite frequent. We had asked to move but they mentioned that they were totally booked up so we were out of luck. I think they should opt to not let people sit there on nights like that since it was quite uncomfortable at times. After we started eating and drinking it was definitely less of an issue however. 

We ordered just about half the menu it seems but some highlights were: the pan con manchego, the selection of meats, beef tartar, the Croquetas de Setas, the queso frito, the lamb chops, the rib eye, scallop paella, and for dessert, the curros and semifrio. Some items I could probably take or leave were the wagyu meatballs and the patatas bravas. Not bad, but not super memorable. The rib-eye and the croquetas were the highlight for sure and for dessert, the semifrio was amazing, full of flavour and texture! The food is all beautifully presented as well as fresh tasting, with an expert focus on bold flavours and textures. We also ordered some wine and sangria and they were all great! 

The reason for the 4 stars instead of the 5 is the price point. I really can't understand the justification for the high prices and tiny portions. For a group of 5, you'll probably need to order 2 or more of each menu item for everyone to try one piece. For the most part, the tapas have 2/3 pieces of food per order so it can get expensive when you start order 2-3 of each item. It's definitely not for the faint of wallet but it's an experience to try at least once or on a special occasion. 

The service was very good. Our drink glasses were filled regularly and the server was very attentive and knowledgeable about the food, which was good as this was a new experience for me. He let us try a few wines before ordering a glass which was also a nice touch. I've never had spanish wine but everyone seemed to enjoy theirs. The sangria was delicious. 

Overall, I'd probably only come back if someone was footing the bill, I'd be hard pressed to spend what it takes to get full at this place, even though it's exceptionally good. If I won the lottery though, this would be one of my first choices for dinner!"}
{"text":"Really loved this place - great atmosphere, service was fantastic and food was unique and tasty. Had the calamari - nothing too special there but was good. My favourite was oyster mushroom, cheese, and fig flatbread was a really great combo. Overall, really great food that you definitely won't see elsewhere."}
{"text":"Patria is a solid upscale Spanish restaurant. The decor is very elegant and stylish. Service was very good. We came here to celebrate my friend's birthday. The server was very helpful to recommend their signature dishes. 

We have ordered 

Paella Patria - very flavourful yet not salty which was the common problem other Paella I have had. The Paella with lots of fresh seafood - shrimps, mussels, clams, fish, scallops. It was well executed. 

Seleccion de Embutidos - selection of different Spanish charcuterie. They were displayed from he light to strong flavours. That was the best way to sample their charcuterie for the first time. 

Gambas Al Ajillo (from daily special) - wild gulf shrimps with garlic, parsley and chili. The shrimps were very fresh and the herbs didn't overpower the shrimp taste. It was delicious. 

Mousse de Avellana - Hazelnut mousse, salted caramel, dulce leche cream, caraquillo, candy roses. The presentation was beautiful and the dessert was very light and delicious. Highly recommend to get it. 

For the price point, it may not be my everyday go-to restaurant, but I will definitely go back for great special occasion."}
{"text":"Wow! Exceptional experience. The atmosphere is stunning. The food was to die for. The service was impeccable. There are times when a friend tells you about a place and you thank them later, this is one of those places. A must visit."}
{"text":"\"Watch as the posh pretty people pose, while pampering their palettes with pricey paella at Patria.\"

Okay enough with the p alliteration and whining.  Maybe it's because I was a little annoyed at the whole covert operation of finding this place tucked behind Weslodge, or maybe I'm just getting too old for pomposity, but I'll stop being surly now as the whole reason for being at Patria was to send the lovely Joie T and Mark off in grand  style before their exodus across the pond  :(  Bon Voyage guys!

I won't lie the seafood paella at Patria is very good, even if it is a smidge burnt, but for 40 bucks it's kinda steep.  Portions of tapas were smallish in size, and the cocktails were meh, but the sangria according to Edwin and Tamara was pretty epic.  For those who are inclined towards cured porcine delights, they will be elated to know that Patria serves Iberico pig and many incarnations of all things ham adorned and bacon wrapped and chorizo flavoured oink-oink!!

Service here was either hot or cold.  The manager and the one server (wish I knew his name, he was so awesome and really sweet!) we had were outstanding and even offered to happily take pictures for us, and you know how discerning Asians are about picture taking in restos dammit!!  Anyway those two gents were real nice, while the one other server seemed more annoyed by our table if anything else...wha-wha :(

High marks goes to the peeps who pimped this place out!   Atmospherically speaking Patria has a beautiful and spaceous lofty interior that is part nouveau frontier rustic chic, paired with bodacious quasi iconographic Spanish(?) Neo-Mannerist paintings (art history minor represent!) there is even a sexy upstairs area cordoned off for private dining (brush that dust off your shoulder...)  

If you want to see and be seen noshing on spendy Spaniard tapas heavy on the pork tip, in gorgeous surroundings, then break out the LV wallet and get your \"Blue Steel\" on for Patria, but myself, I think I'll stick to wearing track pants and getting my seafood paella fix in my mum's kitchen gracias."}
{"text":"We can say that Patria on King Street is the place to be if you want a relaxing brunch. It takes brunch to another level with its unique menu, intimate atmosphere and attentive servers. It does not have the same \"it's bright outside\" brunch dive; the room is dim, just perfect for those eyes who were out late partying the night before. 

Despite its fine dining setting, Patria's prices are competitive. Huevos Escalfado, for example, would only cost you $16. Your bill goes up depending on how much alcohol you would have. Even the price of coffee is competitive - less than $5. 

This is probably one of my favourite brunch places - away from crying children, the noise of banging utensils and smell of greasy potatoes."}
{"text":"The food is so good here. It's definitely pricey but mmmm the flavors used in their seafood paella and Spanish octopus are to die for.

Only problem was that their bathroom literally flooded the day I was there."}
{"text":"The service was great, nice atmosphere. Food is great but not extraordinary & very pricey. I.e. didn't expect 4 little grilled shrimps with a splash of garlic, lemon & parsley for $20."}
{"text":"Just after my trip to Barcelona and experiencing the great Spanish food, I had to see if I could find a place in Toronto that could match a bit of the amazing tastes I had.  I will say that Patria has the atmosphere done right with it's beautiful modern dining room that is rich in textures and monochromatic steel greys.  It just allows a nice canvas to let the food pop out and some of it is quite good.

Reservations are not always necessary but its easily done via opentable.  I grabbed an early table and though they do have a shaded patio in one of the larger alley ways, the crazy Toronto heatwave had me begging to stay in AC.  The tables are nicely spaced out with a lounge like area near the bar and a more formal dining seating area closer to the kitchen.  I love the fact the have a 2nd story alcove meant for a larger private party.  We saw a wine tasting dinner going on up there and think its would be a great spot.  I would say that this is a great spot for a date night.  Though the fellow patrons was a mixture of a demure group for a bridal party, several Kardashian-lite groups, and some people walking in California surfer beach attire (lose tank tops, baggy shorts, unkempt wavy hair, and flip flops... this was the girls. Explaining the guys is a novel itself).  I would have expected more of an upscale experience but to each their own to enjoy good Spanish food.

The menu was easily explained as tapas by our friendly server.  We noticed there was definitely two teams working the tables really well together. The servers who took orders and mostly did the food delivery but a very smooth and fun set of secondary servers who worked the entire room to deliver food and take care of any small items (water refills, new plates, serving paella, additional mixing of plated dishes...).

Jamon croquettes - Patria did a good take on these traditional tapas dish.  It was hot with a nice crispy exterior and the creamy interior being the way to bring the rich flavour of the jamon ham to your tongue.  4/5

Wagyu meatballs (Albondigas) - A solid take on meatballs as they were tender and not dry.  The manchego cheese and tomato sauce was needed to give it an added flavour but could have used a bit more. 3.5/5

Bacon wrapped dates (Datiles) - This was a really good dish.  I first had this dish in Chicago and it was mind blowing.  Every time I see it on the menu, I order it.  This is a good dish with the sweet and savoury being fairly balanced.  The salty crisped up bacon wrapped up the sweet gooey dates that holds the melted manchego cheese.  Whats not to love.  I would have liked it if it had a bit of spicy chorizo added inside the dates (thats what I had in Chicago).  4/5

Empanadas - These are quite pretty and another solid dish coming out of the kitchen.  The tender meat was plentiful inside a nice crust that was baked really well.  4/5

Seafood Paella (Paella Patria) - On my trip, I had super terrible and phenomenally amazing paella. Kudos to Patria for not skipping the seafood in the paella.  I would say that this isnt a traditional take or flavour of the Catalonian seafood paella I had.  It is a nice dish though.  It was missing some of the spices and the well known crispy rice crust that gives the paella a wonderful burst of texture and flavour in each bite.  3.5/5

Patatas Bravas - Crispy cubes of potato that are drenched in a bright tomato and molten egg yolk sauce.  For a side, this was quite enjoyable.  I got it for a filler but found myself going back to this more than I planned.  4/5

I have to admit that I was super worried that we would not have enough to eat and it was pricey from the other reviews.  I can safely say we left satisfied but not overly full which is right in my mind.  It definitely hits a bit higher on the price point but no where ridiculous did you sign off your first born.  I would say the service, tastes, and atmosphere does make it a worthwhile stop for any date night or first tastes (or second!) into good Spanish food."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. Some tapas were a bit too salty for me though. If you go here, definitely order the paella."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner on a Sunday evening. 

I would think it's best enjoyed with 2-3 people to a table. It's tapas yes, but some of the portions are a bit small to split 4 ways. 

My friend and I tried:

Pan Con Tomate (Tomato-y bread)
Dates + Ibérico Bacon + Manchego + Guindillas
Grilled Asparagus + Romesco Sauce
Patatas Bravas - Crispy Potato + Spicy Tomato + Fried Egg
Empanadas De Carne Mixta

Everything was quite good, I wouldn't say amazing, but I have the feeling that was because we let the waiter pick some of the items (I was very indecisive) and he didn't pick the tastiest ones. The patatas bravas I would say were they only must-have from above.

The Dulce De Leche dessert was amazing though.

Service was good although waiter had an air of snobbery/pretentiousness."}
{"text":"So my boyfriend and I visited Patria for my Birthday this summer and it was exactly everything I wanted. The decorations and ambiance is stunning and so unique from everything else offered in Toronto. Its classy and upscale but still not pretentious. We were about 2 hours late for our reservation due to the ridiculous traffic on the Gardner but were pleasantly surprised when the hostess still found us a table, despite the super busy dining area. Patria is a tapas style restaurant but we just opted to go for the seafood paella. IT WAS INCREDIBLE. I am not a huge fan of rice but my gosh this saffron infused paella was so tasty. My boyfriend didn't seem to be such a fan due to the seafood dispersed throughout but still thought the overall taste was good. The other meat choices for the Paella sounded so good as well. Overall I really enjoyed my experience and the atmosphere alone is worth visiting, well at least in my humble opinion."}
{"text":"My bestie and I came to Patria again for the second time. This time around the food was just as amazing as the first time.  We both started off with a charcuterie board of a selection of different smoked meat. It was delicious!  We also had the garlic shrimps with some kind of pesto sauce with as side order of sliced bread and olive oil. For our mains we ordered the seafood paella, side order of Brussel sprouts and wagu beef in this Cajun sauce. For dessert we shared the churros with salted chocolate and caramel sauce. I was impressed with the quality of the overall meal. The service was amazing as well. Our waiter took the time to tell us what every item on the menu was as well as made some delicious recommendations which we did go with. I love this restaurant and will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"One of my pet peeves is to pay high prices at a restaurant, and still leave hungry.  It's even more aggravating when the food is just ordinary.  This was my experience at Patria.

We were told by the server we should order 3-4 items per person so long as it included some items from the heavier dishes.  We ordered 4 items per person from across the menu, just as instructed, and there was still very little food to be had.

The choritzo ($7) was sliced very thinly and there was just enough to cover a small saucer.  In other words, there was very little of it.  The Jamon Serrano ($13) was just enough to cover a medium sized dish.  In other words, there was very little of it too.

We ordered two types of goat cheese (Roncal and Garrotxas).  They were both firm cheeses, and I must say rather underwhelming.  There was a little piece of each, hardly justified for $9 a piece.

The \"Patatas Bravas Con Huevo Frito\" (Crispy Potato + Spicy Tomato + Fried Egg) was very disappointing at $10.  It looked and tasted like home fries you might get at the Golden Griddle.  We asked for it to be replaced, and got the Halibut special instead.  The fish was very nicely cooked, but it was under dressed, and again a very small portion.  At ($26) we did not get anywhere near our money's worth.  

The chick peas and spinach stew ($9) was tasty, but again, only a handful of chick peas and a mere sprinkle of spinach.

The \"Pimientos Rellenos\" (stuffed piquillo pepper) ($14) consisted of only two stuffed peppers.  Let's do the math.  That's $7 dollar for a pepper the size of a ping pong ball.  I don't know about you, but in my books, that's a steep price.  Now, even that would have been forgiven, had it been a great stuffed pepper.  But instead, it was a very bad stuffed pepper.  The meat was mushy and completely bland.  Very unappetizing dish.

The \"Bistec a la Parrilla\" (Prime Beef Striploin + Padron Peppers + Crispy Potato) was quite good.  The crispy potato was very nice.  But again there was very very little meat.  They try to make it look more plentiful by slicing it very thinly, but in my opinion, there was probable about 4oz of meat on the plate.  At $34, again, you do not get anywhere close to your money's worth.

The wine selection was not great, with much too heavy emphasis on expensive bottles.  Opting to order by the glass, we ended up paying $56 for 4 glasses of wine.

At the end of the day, we paid $200 for a dinner for two, and left with empty stomachs.

What surprises me is that the restaurant seems to be doing quite well.  It was filled to capacity on a weeknight.  Maybe it's because it's such an attractive space.  Or maybe these folks just did not read the right reviews.

Well, I hope I did some service out there to people who are still concerned about the value of their money, and don't wish to squander it on mediocre, overly priced, very small portions of food.

P.S. The restaurant is rated at $$$, but it's probably because it's hard to give a price range for tapas.  However, it belongs in the $$$$ category."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place but I just thought it was okay.  This place is super fancy and definitely not one of those places where you just drop by and eat.  It is pricey especially that it's tapas.  It's going to take a lot of ordering to get yourself full.  The food was amazing super fresh and lots of flavour however, I thought it was just okay and nothing special especially for the price your paying.  Out of all the dishes my boyfriend and I tried I definitely loved the beef tartar.  The service was great, she explained everything on the menu and even gave suggestions.  Our waters were never empty  and they were super friendly and attentive.

Would I come back? Um not anytime soon.  Food was great but it didn't really meet my expectations."}
{"text":"Patria is my new fav restaurant its spanish tapas style and every dish is amazing its pricey but worth every penny."}
{"text":"Love this place. Red sangrias are amazing and the food never disappoints! Very good spot to take your partner on a romantic date."}
{"text":"We had a great dining experience at Patria.  I tried this wine from Spain that the server recommended and it was excellent.  Overall service was fantastic.  Decor is romantic and classy although I was here for a business dinner.  This is a higher end restaurant and you can tell by the clientele and overall setup.  

We tried a host of dishes.  Definitely the best item on the menu are the  Dátiles which are figs wrapped in bacon.  You should probably order 2 of those.  We also ordered the small Paella de Carrillada which was very good.  Kind of pricey for that amount of meat but it was good.

Cheese croquettes were pretty good.  

Patatas Bravas were also not bad.  That is a potato based side with some other ingredients.  Not super amazing but not bad.

Croquetas de Jamón was ok, it's basically this tiny flatbread with some toppings on it like ham, etc.

Overall, this is a pricey place.  Food was pretty good, service was great.  We had a good time."}
{"text":"--Service is immaculate, you feel like 8 people are serving you
--Food is out of this world, tiny little expensive portions, but amazing
--Highly recommend booking a table in advance
--Sea food paella over any other paella (tried the chorizo one and no)"}
{"text":"That was, without a doubt, one of the best meals we've ever had.

The rib eye was the BEST steak I've ever had - and I've had more than a few steaks...  Perfect crust, rich jus, simple, and delicious.  It was so good that I had to give the manager a hug to pass on to the chef!  Lol!

The fried goat cheese with figs and walnuts was another highlight - way too good for me to be able to adequately describe.  My wife's and my eyes both doubled in size when the first forkful hit our taste buds.

Very friendly place.  Our waiter (James) was personable, polite, knowledgeable and enthusiastic about the food, and every one of his menu suggestions were spot on.  We were having trouble deciding, and he came over and gave us some must-get suggestions, and was he ever right!  

Impeccable service, luscious and interesting decor, and not at all pretentious.  But the highlight was the food.   So.  Damn.  Good!"}
{"text":"The food here was mostly good (especially the empanadas and croquettas - but skip the bland patatas bravas), and the service was attentive & friendly.  

However, the restaurant itself is very noisy and quite dark inside.  So, if you're looking for a nightclub-style night out, but also want dinner - without the location change - then come here (and, judging by their clientele, that's why they were here).

But, it's not a good place for a romantic dinner, or to catch up with friends."}
{"text":"I finally had the chance to visit Patria last week and absolutely loved it.

It is a bit pricey but SOME things are worth it. For example the ham croquettes were small and there were only 3 of them.  This was $9.  At least give us 4....

The Pimientos De Padrón, $8, we very good and a generous tapas-sized portion.  I love peppers so I could've ate the entire dish by myself.

The 36 Month Acorn-Fed Black-Hoof Jamón Ibérico, $30, was worth it!! I have never had such delicious ham in my life, well except for when I was in Spain of course.  Highly recommend this dish.

The octopus was probably my fav.  It was cooked perfectly and paired with a thin slice of potato and some olive oil sauce.

The paella's looked AMAZING but I wasn't that hungry, next time it'll be a definite order :)

Lovely spot on King West! Great ambiance, cozy, amazing wine menu, and friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Some places are not mean to dine alone. Patria is great to come with a few friends. Share a pitcher or 2 of Sangria and some Tapas.

A group of 4 shared:

Red Sangria ($33) Red wine, port, sweet vermouth, spiced poached pear reduction cloves, orange juice & pear nectar

Pan Con Tomate + Spanish Achovies ($6)

Aceitunas ($7) - House Marinated Olives

Selección De Embutidos ($16) - Iberico Lomo, Iberico Salchichon, Jamon Serrrano, Morcon Salami

Fideos Con Almejas Y Chorizo ($16) - Fideo Pasta+Clams+Chorizo+Aioli

Bistec a La Parilla Y Samfaina ($22) - Kobe Flatiron+Peas+Catalan Ratouille

Patatas Bravas Con Huevo Frito ($6) - Crispy Potato+Spicy Tomato+Fried Egg

Churros Con Dulce De Leche ($6) - Spanish Doughnuts+Cinnamon Sugar+Dulce de Leche

How's the food? It was alright. 

How's the deco? It was glorious

How's the service? It was awesome

All I remember the most was my waitress kept filling my empty glass up with more Sangria! And of course the good time with my friends."}
{"text":"This was maybe one of the best places to get a bite with a significant other. Myself and my partner absolutely adored this restaurant. I think the price of the food is decent and you can tell that the menu items were carefully created and prepared. The restaurant is dimly lit and has an excellent atmosphere for a date night or for a nice night out.

For drinks, we ordered a jug of white wine sangria. Interestingly, the jug of sangria was not left on our table. The server came and refilled our glasses until we finished our jug. The service was impeccable, my glass of water and sangria was never empty. The staff were always there when you needed them but they were not intrusive and did not interrupt your conversation. The sangria itself was very delicious and had a lot of fresh fruit in it (peaches, green apple, orange and strawberries).

For appetizers we first ordered deep fried cheese with figs. The figs were fresh and perfectly paired with the cheese and some assorted nuts. The cheese had a breaded crust that made it extra enjoyable. We also ordered the empanadas which were delicious and filled with moist and tender meat. The empanadas were quite small, which was slightly disappointing. We also had the anchovy flatbread which was a fairly large size. It tasted a bit of vinegar which was such a nice pairing with the anchovies and tomato. We also ordered the spicy meatballs which had excellent flavour and was jot too spicy for someone who can't handle spicy foods.

The seafood paella was simply the best one i have ever tasted... EVER. The small portion serves two comfortably and is very reasonably priced around $20. You get so much seafood in the paella. There is scallops, large shrimp, mussels, and clams.. to mention just a few. For dessert we ordered the fried milk with saffron ice cream. The fried milk was very refreshing and was not too sweet. It was the perfect way to end off a great meal. It was one of the best meals I have had in a very long time and I will likely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Visited Patria last Saturday evening with a good friend. Having lived in Spain for 3 years, he wanted to take me to a place with authentic Spanish food. Now when visiting any great restaurant, 2 things are especially important to me: The service and the food. I can eat in a dump if you give me a smile and great food. With that said, Patria is chic and has a great atmosphere. 

To start with the service. Our server Ellen was the high point of the evening. A great smile, on-point recommendations and timely service. She had us laughing & checked in regularly to make sure we were good. She is without a doubt one of the best servers I've experienced in Toronto which says a lot as I am eating out 5 or 6 times a week. 

Now to the food. We had the following items with comments beside them:

Goat Cheese + Orange Blossom Honey + Walnut + Fig 
- Really super tasty if you love cheese - highly recommended

Roasted Cauliflower + Crispy Jamón + Garlic Chips + Almond Sauce 
- Our server actually recommended this dish and so glad that she did - was absolutely outstanding - top appetizer we had for sure

24 Month Salt-Cured Jamón Serrano 
- Was good, but I buy cured ham at the local deli regularly so not necessarily best value for money - great if you don't buy at the local deli like I do

House Baked Bread + Fresh Tomato + Olive Oil 
- We had this and another baked bread with cheese on top. Both of them were heavenily and so reminiscient of Spain. This is such a regular dish and one of my favorites. I would come back just for this. 

Octopus Dish (Can't find on their menu)
- this was a tasty appetizer that had a pepper sprinkled over it.... was delicious, not a lot of food in the dish, but tasty

Wood Fire Roasted Rib Eye + Roasted Garlic 
- This was probably the only disappointment - while it was OK, it was a bit fatty and for the $68 price tag, there are simply a lot of other good rib-eye options in the city. Wouldn't recommend this dish given the above. 

Anyways, overall would recommend this place to anyone looking for some Spanish inspired food. Next time I am back I will try the Shaved Fennel + Radish + Manchego + Crispy Artichokes as artichokes were one of my favorite dishes living in Spain (unfortunately missed it on the menu last Saturday)."}
{"text":"Patria just didn't really do it for me. Nothing was really wrong with either the food or service, but nothing about the experience was particularly fun or exciting. It all just felt a bit contrived -- but maybe that's what happens when you serve croquettes, chorizo and bacon-wrapped pepper-stuffed dates in a yawning 4-million dollar space. There's no real energy to the place; it just dissipates.

Service was super friendly but they screwed up one dish (brought us plain pan con tomate and not with the anchovies we wanted) and the pace was way off, as our first 3 plates all came within 10 minutes after we ordered. I was also a little bit peeved that the \"small\" meat and cheese plate I asked for (after we already ate five or six dishes) ended up being three full orders of individual meats and cheeses each for 49 bucks. I just wanted something small to munch on but obviously I wasn't clear or Patria didn't bother to just put a couple half-plates together.

Wine markups are insane, at 4x for a 25-dollar bottle I could find at the LCBO a block away. (I ordered it anyways so I guess that's my fault.)

Probably won't be back any time soon and will look to get my tapas fix at Bar Isabel instead. It just feels right there."}
{"text":"Great paella, atmosphere and service. The renno is beautiful and modern. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"I had been dying to try Patria ever since I heard about it from a friend, and finally got a chance on Saturday night. I came without a reservation, and even though we arrived past 9 PM, the place was PACKED. They put us on the waitlist and told us it would be at least a 15 minute wait, and said we could just seat ourselves at the bar... only, there weren't even any seats left at the bar, it was that busy. We ended up just squishing ourselves in and standing around for a bit until a table freed up (we probably waited about 15-20 mins in total.)

The menu at Patria isn't huge, but it is definitely very unique, especially given that there aren't too many other authentic Spanish restaurants around. Pretty much everything is tapas style, meaning they are small dishes meant to be shared. Our server was very friendly and informative, as she was able to explain some of the unfamiliar food names to us and also offered us some recommendations when we asked for them. She recommended that we order around 3-4 dishes per person, so in the end we ended up getting 6 things.

Pimientos Rellenos De Buey ($14): these are piquillo peppers stuffed with oxtail and manchego cheese and came in a set of two. I'm not sure what is supposed to be special about the pepper, but it just tasted like a regular red pepper to me. The oxtail inside the pepper was very soft and tender, cooked perfectly. I also loved how it blended with the salty flavour of the manchego cheese. Interesting and worth a try.

Dátiles Con Tocino Ibérico ($9): dates wrapped in ibérico bacon and stuffed with manchego cheese and guindillas (chili peppers). Apparently this is one of their most popular dishes, and it came with 5 in the dish. It's such an interesting and unique dish, the slight sweetness of the dates mixes really well with the saltiness of the bacon and cheese. I have a really low tolerance for spiciness, so I could definitely taste the chili peppers, but the other flavours balanced it out enough that I could still enjoy it. Would recommend trying this.

Selección De Embutidos ($16): kind of like a charcuterie platter, this came with four different types of meats: ibérico lomo, ibérico chorizo, jamón serrano and morcón salami. For me, this platter was just okay. Quite honestly I found most of the meats to be dry and rather bland for the most part. I think the salami had the most distinct flavour, but all the other ones tasted pretty much the same. I would rather skip this and shell out the extra $$$ to try the jamón ibérico ($30) next time.

Queso De Cabra Frito Con Higo Y Miel ($13): deep fried goat cheese with orange blossom honey, walnut and fig. We got this on the recommendation of our waitress, and it actually ended up being like my favourite dish of the night. Then again, I LOVE goat cheese, figs, and sweets, so this was perfect for me even though it's so simple. The goat cheese was so creamy, and the slight sweetness from the honey and fig really hit the right spot :D

Patatas Bravas Con Huevos Fritos ($10): crispy potato with spicy tomato sauce and fried egg. This was another mediocre dish for me. It's basically just like home fries but with a spicier sauce and a fried egg on top (which they will mix in for you). Nothing special.

Capon Al Ajillo Y Almendras ($29): wood fire roasted cornish hen with onion sherry sauce and almonds. Another recommendation from our waitress. This was good, but larger than the typical size for tapas. I would say if you are going to order this, then you can cut back on the other dishes. It was cooked very well though, the hen was not dry in the least; on the contrary, it was very moist and very soft and just flavourful enough, although I couldn't really taste any distinct onion or sherry flavour. While I enjoyed it, I wouldn't put this on my list of \"must-order items\" from this place.

With the 6 items we ordered, we were both quite full. With two drinks (cava suprema - $13.27, and a bottle of Estrella - $7.96), our bill ended up being just under $130 before tip.

My biggest qualm with this place is probably the location. It's located beside (just west of and kind of behind) Weslodge, and is connected to a residential condo. It can be a bit of a challenge to find, especially in the dark because the area between the two buildings is dimly lit and it is hard to see the sign. We walked right past the front door, then turned around and walked past it again and accidentally entered the condo before we finally figured it out. Definitely need some better signage here.

Despite the slightly hefty price tag, I would come to Patria again. My friend doesn't eat seafood, so we didn't bother ordering paella this time, but I am determined to give that a try next time, as well as their desserts! Food is for the most part very good (although some things are more worth it than others) and actually reminiscent of Spain, service was awesome, and I had a great time here!"}
{"text":"I think this was my favorite restaurant in Toronto. We loved it. We settled into the bar area, just us initially although the rest of the space was bustling. The high vaulted ceilings give the place a dramatic feel as do the oversized renaissance-esque paintings looming over the bar in the background. It's a cool, dimly lit space. 
My husband ordered the Barrel aged wise guy - rum based cocktail, pre mixed. It smelled smokey and the run was fragrant but not overly syrupy. He next opted for the manhattan. He was happy. Nothing earth shattering but good. 
I had a White sangria which was mild and lightly flavorful. It had diced apples and a few small pieces of strawberry. Not super sweet as many American versions are. I wasn't in love with it so I ordered a red sangria instead for my next beverage. Overall in Toronto, I found the wine seriously lacking which is why I ditched my standard pour to try the sangria. Again with the red it was very mild, not incredibly sweet and the taste of the wine was minimal. It was just OK. Better than the white but not stellar. I think I was missing more of the fruit flavors typically accompanying sangria. After the sangria the bartender offered me a sampling of a Tempranillo for $15 Canadian that'd caught my eye. Par for the course it was young & almost tart. I passed but this was a common experience with every wine I ordered in Toronto so I don't hold it against them. 

The interior is Beautiful and set back from the main strip. A kind, attentive female bartender who seemed interested in her cocktail crafting took care of us and the entire restaurant. She was a busy woman but handled it well. 
I loved their menu & wish we'd eaten here instead. The menu was heavy with Spanish tapas listings to include many dishes featuring manchego cheese. 
We ordered the bacon wrapped dates and they were exquisite. Everything you'd imagine from the name. The sweet, warm texture of the date complimented by the crisp bacon and warm, creamy manchego. The salty, pork flavor from the bacon paired perfectly with the sweet flesh of the date. To top it off it was drizzled in authentic maple syrup. Part appetizer, part dessert. All parts phenomenal. 
I seriously enjoyed them so much I thought about ordering a second helping. I didn't & instead ordered the almonds which were a small portion given the price and were underwhelming. I'd skip those and probably get the olives next time."}
{"text":"The peppers stuffed with oxtail and the bacon-wrapped dates are fantastic options. It's a little hard to find - no signage and it's off of King Street tucked in an alleyway."}
{"text":"I really didn't have a great experience when I came here for dinner. Yes, the ambiance was great, the location is convenient, and the service was okay, but the food was mediocre at best and extremely overpriced. To be fair, it is on King St. and very central but come on, $8 for 3 croquetas? No, thank you. They weren't even the best croquetas I've ever had. I tried the paella patria and it was...you guessed it, overpriced and mediocre in flavour. There wasn't enough seafood in it and the rice was a little bit overcooked. Will not be back any time soon."}
{"text":"This place is an excellent spot for a date night. It's just nicely designed and dark enough to make sure you know it's fine dining. The service was phenomenal. Our waitress was top notch the entire way through. Professional, efficient and friendly but not too in your face. We ordered the patria paella right as we got into the restaurant because of the wait time. To start we got the dates and the potatoes with egg and spicy ketchup. The dates were pretty good although not mind blowing to me like the other reviews suggested. It tasted more sweet than like bacon. I would've preferred more of a bacon taste. The potatoes dish was pretty good although it tasted like a breakfast dish. The patria paella was good and filled with generous amounts of seafood. It should be since it was $50! Still, I wasn't a big fan of the flavour. We ordered a bit too much for the two of us. Overall good but not great food. The atmosphere and service makes up for it though.

3.5/5 for the food
5/5 for the amosphere and service"}
{"text":"Beautiful venue, fantastic wines and delicious Spanish food add up to make Patria a gem among the King West restaurant row.

My visit to Patria was nothing but delightful. My companion and I shared a small veg paella and a few other vegetarian tapas. The food was cooked expertly and was a treat to enjoy after a hard week.

The servers were knowledgeable and suggested a great wine to be paired with the food and in our price range.

This is definitely a chic, upscale date spot for anyone who loves Spanish cuisine."}
{"text":"This is a great spot for brunch and dinner. I came here with a group of 10 or so, and the service, food, and atmosphere was fantastic. Get the dates! And their steak. Was. Incredible."}
{"text":"Hard to find. Long wait for a table, even with reservations. Very loud. But delicious, delicious, authentic food. Worth the wait, and I got used to the sound level. With four people, we ordered a total of 12 dishes, excluding desserts. Each was tastier than the next. I'm always happy to have pan con tomate, good olives, good cheeses. The cooked dishes were even better, including the croquettes, the stuffed dates, the tenderloin, and the avocado salad. I ordered a café con leche dessert with bits of black olives. Sounds strange -- it was really wonderful."}
{"text":"Patrias was one of the better tapas experiences that I've had.  It's higher-end tapas and entrees, with quality meats and cheeses. 

My favorite part about this place is that they have jamon de Iberco de bellota (spanish pork, raised in the Iberco mountains, fed nothing but acorns) which is just about as high end as it gets for North America.  For those not in the know, this stuff is like crack of the pork world.  Think prosciutto, only 100x better.  They even have the stand used to cut the meat off the leg...that's as legit as it gets.

A quick tip, this place isn't overly easy to find.  It's tucked back in an alleyway of sorts, so it's easy to walk right by it.  

Come here prepared to spend a bit of money, but it's worth it for a special occasion."}
{"text":"In short: Patria was fantastic.

The tapas was delicious. Everything was so rich in flavors! Not to mention an amazing pairing of many difference ingredients to create a whole new taste I've never had.

The service was perfect. The staff not only had a passion for guest service but of the quality of their food.

The over all cost was also quite reasonable. I went with 3 others and in the end we spent $50 per person which included all our food, bottle of wine, dessert, and tip.

I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Tapas are amazing, beautiful resturaunt in a beautiful city! Huge wine list. Had the seafood paella, the dates....everything was great! Can't wait to go back to Toronto and have dinner here!"}
{"text":"I loved this restaurant. My favourite way to eat food is tapas style. You get to enjoy multiple types of dishes without needing to unbutton your pants. 
Must try: 
Manchego croquettes
Pulpo (octopus)
Roasted cauliflower 
Oxtail stuffed peppers with sprinkle of manchego cheese"}
{"text":"Patria (@PatriaTO) have been on top of my list since it opened but never got to try it out until recently for Brunch. It's tucked away in an alley beside Weslodge. Patria is all about Spanish Cuisine from tapas to cook to order paella. 

Love the space here w/ the high ceiling

White Sangria $33
~ white wine, lillet, mixed apple cider & poached apple, lemongrass reduction
~ Love this, it's definitely one of the best I had in the city. It was so light and refreshing, love all the flavor which wasn't too sweet or citrus-cy.

Pan Con Tomate ~ Spanish Anchovies $6
~ This couldn't have been better, you won't believe how good toasted house baked bread with crushed tomato and olive oil can get. 
~ Simple at it's best and the anchovies just made it all that much better.

Jambon Iberico De Bellota $30
~ 36 month Acon-fed Black Hoof Iberico Ham
~ This is the finest type of Jambon Iberico which is made from free-range pigs that roam the oak forest and each only acorn (bellota). 
~ The exercise and diet gave the 36 months cured ham so much flavor and the right amount of fat.
~  It was def a splurge on our part for brunch but we just had to taste it for ourselves to see what make it so pricey.

 Iluevos Cocidos Con Esparragos Blancos, Jambon Serrano Y Espuma de Quesco Manchego $13
~ poached eggs, white asparagus, Jambon Serrano, Manchego
~ This was a rather simple dish but every components are so perfect.... it was nothing special but yet so good. 
~ I wouldn't mind going back and have another one of this.

Habas Con Chorizo $8
~ House chorizo & braised beans
~ Even though I am not a big bean fan, I loved this dish.

 Leche Frita Con Helado de Azafron $7
~ Fried mild, Saffron Ice Cream, Honey
~ This was way sweeter than I expected and I actually prefer the texture and taste of the Chinese Version which is more milky rather than custardy here.

 The cleavers on the wall spell out \"Full Stomach, Happy Heart\" in Spanish

 Verdict:
~ Love this place, will def come back for dinner real soon
~ Simple Delicious Dishes, nothing to pretentious 
~ Can't wait to go back to try the rest of the menu"}
{"text":"This place is definitely worthy of the accolades it's gotten.

Ambience-wise it's upscale. And the low lighting gives it a romantic feel.

The food though is where this place really shines. The fried cheese is outstanding (and I don't even like cheese that much.) The seafood paella is excellent. (I can't think of another place to go in Toronto where I can get seafood paella this good.) And the chocolate mousse was a great way to end the meal.

The wine was a tad expensive though."}
{"text":"Food was quite good, but our server suggested we order all of our food in the beginning, assuring us that she would pace how it was brought to the table.  It was not paced ... We were totally rushed and the food runner was actually pissy with us when we didn't adequately clear our food for the large paella plate.  Some of the other food had arrived only a few minutes earlier.  

Best of the night:  bacon wrapped dates, Serrano ham, cauliflower, peppers, and coffee ice cream with candied olives (a sweet and savory punch of yum!).  Eggplant was okay, as was lobster paella.  The sourdough bread with the cheese course was very delicious.

The atmosphere is lovely and has a contemporary feel with neat light fixtures and a casual vibe.  I would recommend going, but DO NOT order all your food dishes at once.  Order your next plates after the first ones arrive, etc."}
{"text":"Such an awesome place. Great ambiance and amazing food.I was waiting for a place that serves good paella.... and luckily I found it!"}
{"text":"Food ok but way too expensive for the portions they give. Yes, I know it's tapas and King St but still not worth the price.

The plate with the cerdo lomo, chorizo, and serrano - paper thin, translucent, almost insulting slices. Seriously, do the slices have to be THAT thin? And don't even start with \"that's how they do it in Spain\" bc that is NOT how they do it. They at least respect the customers enough to feed them something with substance.

Dates with the Iberico bacon - Surprisingly YUM!
Patatas Bravas - Needed more sauce, or sauce needed more taste, egg was a nice touch but overall dish was meh
Chickpeas w/ Spinach - Was good but the crunchy things in it were weird and didn't really belong with the taste
Bread with Tomato - why you gotta charge so much for TWO PIECES of bread with tomato!?
Drunken Goat cheese - tasty but again, lousy portion.
Fried goat cheese with walnuts - very \"goaty\" cheese taste but ok

I think we ordered a couple more dishes, but while it may look like a lot of food I tell you it was not. The restaurant itself is gorgeous. Service was fine. Easy to make reservations. 

Don't come here hungry.
(we ended up across the street to get chicken wings. don't judge us)"}
{"text":"Had dinner at Patria Saturday night. Had the waiter Tom put some tapas and mains together for us. He made great choices. Food service and ambience was great for the four of us."}
{"text":"For those who may have read my other reviews you'll notice I ended the last one referring to a restaurant that left us so hungry, we decided to find a tapas bar to get a second smaller meal.

This is that place.

I will admit, because the first place I went to eat on this particular day left me so angry, all Patria had to do was provide halfway decent service and edible food, and I would've been okay.

But.

They did better than that. The options really looked incredible and as much as I would've like to order everything, the food we did order was good enough to make me believe everything else would've been just as good.

The drink selection was extensive and impressive. I ended up trying sherry for the first time and have found a new favorite aperitif to have after dinner at home. 

I would definitely come back to Patria again for a full dining experience."}
{"text":"Not bad.  The service was quite, quite good.  The food was, on average, good.  But the prices are kind of high for what you get (I know, I know, I need to stop comparing prices with what I paid for these foods when I lived in Spain).  

We had the paellas which were nothing special, honestly.  The seafood paella was rather fishy, actually.  I always think that the best paellas have both seafood and \"land meats\" together - that makes the best flavour (paella valenciana).  The best paella in Toronto is made by a lovely Mexican chef named Paula Zavala (I know she's not Spanish but her paella is better than anything I had in Spain!) - she teaches at Loblaws and does special order paellas (she can either bring them over all done or make them at your home).  

The manchego cheese was good - but very expensive.  The charcuterie was good - but very expensive.  The pulpo a la gallega was good and cooked just right.  The padron peppers were good.  Patatas bravas were good.  We had a bunch of other dishes that I can't remember anymore.  On average, everything was good, pretty authentic, but not sock-knocking, you know?  And it was quite a pricey meal.

Spanish food is all about down-to-earth, simple, good flavours.  It's not prententious cuisine.  As such, I think Patria's rather overpriced (even after factoring in the fact that many of the imported ingredients are costlier), so I've knocked it back a star to 3."}
{"text":"Excellent. Go there if you like Tapas/small plates. Great wines. Amazing location and ambience."}
{"text":"Very surprised with service. Right away we were sat down right next to the entrance and told all other tables were spoken for. To which I responded what was the point of me reserving a table. We were then moved to a better location. (I might add over the course of the next 2 hours we saw many spoken for tables stay empty)Our waiter seemed to know very little about the menu. We had asked for recommendations and if we would have enough food to satisfy me and my girlfriend. Not only was he unable to help us by suggesting dishes he said we would probably be hungry but was still unable to recommend anything to us... I asked if we could order more side dishes later but it didn't matter as he then took all the menus away. The food itself seem to be on the small side, however very flavourful. We ordered the octopus special and it was amazing, we also got the paella and it was the highlight of the evening. Over all the restaurant was just ok and left us feeling like we would need to eat again (which we did)."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner with a group of five others, and we ordered 15+ dishes. Although nothing was bad, not much stood out, certainly not enough to justify the pricetag. Perhaps the group I was with isn't the right audience for tapas? We all like to eat and none of us felt totally satisfied upon leaving.

Cheese platter - extremely small portion, literally just a few (small) pieces of cheese for $25. 100% not worth the price.

Empanadas - tasted pretty good but you only get two small empanadas for $12! You can get empanadas that taste just as good for much cheaper elsewhere.

I really enjoyed datilles (Dates + Ibérico Bacon + Manchego + Guindillas) - perfect flavor combination.

Paella De Bogavante (Lobster + Gulf Shrimp + Chorizo + Peas) - we ordered the large and thought that they brought out the wrong size at first. Our server made it sound like it would be huge, and the entire table was disappointed at how small the portion was, especially for $75. The flavor was good, but it was so overpriced. We also ordered the small size of another paella and found the size to be pretty laughable.

The bill came to $300+ and while I didn't leave hungry, I certainly didn't feel full after. I have no qualms with spending a lot on a meal, but very few things stood out to me here and I mostly just felt ripped off upon leaving.

tldr; Food was pretty good but the price tag is not justified.

Taste - 7

Service - 8

Value - 4"}
{"text":"When booking reservations at patria I booked the wrong date but the hostess was friendly and accommodated us immediately. We ordered the octopus, pork flank and lobster paella. Pork flank had lots of flavors but paella was salty from the chorizo sausage. Really nice atmosphere to hang out for drinks and Spanish tapas to share"}
{"text":"It was my first time to have an official Spanish dinner and it was just wonderful! We had a table at the patio and the weather in May was so perfect! The paella was no doubt a dish you must have. The meatballs were totally legendary and magical!! Seriously how could they be so creamy and tasty? The churros were very very amazing and they just over wrote the images I had had for cinnamon. I love them so much. Anyways the Salad de pera was just fine. I am not a big fan of blue cheese. I was just trying to have something new."}
{"text":"went to patria for christmas dinner with work folks. the food was interesting, in a good way and the service was excellent. great atmosphere."}
{"text":"The Brussel Sprouts and Oxtail were very good. The wait staff was efficient and knowledgeable. The brazino was very salty"}
