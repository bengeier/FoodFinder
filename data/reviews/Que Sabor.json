{"text":"Delicious and authentic, always friendly and clean, but as of recently, the workers need to leave their kids at home, brings the overall dinning experience down. Will continue coming to this little gem, I highly recommend the birria(shredded beef)tacos, they are amazing!"}
{"text":"We've been coming since there grand opening. .. gotta love this place... everything I've tried has been delicious... they have something for everyone. .. I can honestly say I already recommend this place and they all have loved it.."}
{"text":"Wow! My first time coming here (weekend) Really enjoy their tortas!!! Very fresh and yummy but the dessert was Excellent!!! Customer service was nice and helpful... I loved it.. Definitely will come back again!! Happy to try Que sABOr!"}
{"text":"The carne asada Torta is the best! Don't forget to try the Fresas con Crema (strawberries n cream). This spot is a hidden gem in the heart of old Peoria."}
{"text":"This place used to be amazing!!!! The original owner sold this place in May of 2014 which is why everything changed."}
{"text":"This place used to be excellent. The past couple of times the flavor of the food has been a bit off... The carne asada in particular.... This time it had an almost old flavor to it... The chicken u could tell had been in the fridge for a while uncovered as it was hard and yet still served it. The lady at the front is pretty sweet, but the food... Nah uh ... Not no more"}
{"text":"This is my first time coming here and I must say they're not friendly at all. This place isn't that clean. They're raspados were terrible they don't even use real juice just some kind of syrup. It tasted awful. Wouldn't recommend this place to anyone who wants to have a delicious treat. By the way, I normally don't take the time to give a place a bad review but this place was so terrible I had to let others know of my experience so they'd think twice of coming here and wasting their time and money."}
