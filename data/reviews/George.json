{"text":"Great food, great presentation.
We tried the 5 course dinner tasting menu. On average it takes around 2.5 hours. Small portions but with 5 different items it was very filling.
The servers explained each dish."}
{"text":"Spectacular meal. 7 course tasting menu, custom cocktails, beautiful ambiance. George's ingenuity never fails with no repeat dishes after several tasting menu's. The service is attentive but discreet allowing for an intimate dinning setting. Great spot for a couples night and larger groups."}
{"text":"I've always wanted check George out and finally got the chance. Cozy interior, like a French farmhouse with a view to the kitchen from some seats. I ordered the tasting menu (110) with 6 courses including the amuse, a sun choke flan w fingerling potato chips on a yellow pepper puree - the delicate softness of the flan paired with the crunch of the cucumber and yellow pepper and the crispness of the chips. A nice start to the multi course tasting menu.

Swordfish tataki, roasted pumpkin seeds, beet puree, golden beet carpaccio, thin biscotti. The slaw of carrot could use a touch of acid, the black pepper pannacotta was sublime with a rich mouth feel.

The waiter asked in advance if I liked Foie gras (yes), so the next course included it with a minced rabbit medallion with passion fruit, quail egg, and a julienne root vegetable. The dish was topped with crispy fried threads of sweet potato. Very good dish. Next up was the rack of lamb,served with shiitake mushrooms, a squash puree...and a Danish donut filled w roasted shiitake (lots of umami), tasting a little like a Yorkshire pudding, savoury in taste, accompanied by a cranberry confit/compote which had a super intense flavour, and a lovely enhancement to the lamb (cooked to a light medium rare, excellent!)

Service was attentive (by the waiter) but plate clearing was a bit slow as was water refill.
The Cheese course (1 slice of a Quebec sheeps) was served with persimmon jam, and a couple of toasted pecans dusted with something sweet yet with a little bite.

Mastika (Greek alcohol from root veg) Brûlée with vanilla strudels and cinnamon crullers finished off the menu. A large portion size that I couldn't finish (could have eaten lots of those little donuts though!), but a nice round out to an excellent meal."}
{"text":"Had a gorgeous meal here the other night. But enough about the food. The true gem of this establishment is the stunning service and support staff. Jordan? Jacob? I can't remember the lad's name, but he rustled my jimmy's...that's for damn sure. 


Let's just say i'll be back."}
{"text":"A friend took me here for my birthday.  We both had the five course tasting menu. It was delicious - one of the best tasting menus I have had.  The quality of the food, presentation and flavours were impressive. The service was top notch. The wine list I about of this world. Overall very impressed.  The entire tasting menu experience does take a while - it must have been about three hours in total."}
{"text":"George is a great place for groups, with an excellent tasting menu and top quality service.

I ate at George in the middle of the week with a group of ~10 colleagues from work.  We were not able to get the private room but they were very accommodating in having a table set up for us both inside and outside.  We decided to sit outside (note: this was not something we requested, so it was great that we had the choice).  The outdoor patio area at George is very secluded and has a wonderful ambiance.

Pre-dinner cocktails were excellent, specially their artisanal cocktails which were done very well.

For dinner, we went with the 7 course tasting menu, with wine pairings.  The food itself I would give a 4.5*, it was most certainly up there and the assortment was excellent.  Not a single bad dish (although dessert was underwhelming).  Wine I would give 4*, great for the price but with 7 glasses, at only $80 per person, you can't expect the finest wines.  Complimented the food very well though.

Service was spot on, although they had the benefit of it being a quiet night, there was always someone on-hand and they were accommodating to all of our needs.

Overall a 5* experience and highly recommended, particularly for groups, or those looking for a tasting menu."}
{"text":"Went back with my boyfriend for our anniversary.  Once again an amazing experience. Chose 7 course menu this time with wine pairing. The food was amazing, you get very small portions but what you receive on the plate is pure feast for your eyes and your stomach. Loved the wine pairing and would recomend it!!!  I started with white, worked to rose and then red and finally desert wine.  You get to try 7 different wines with each course. Fantastic. Our dinner lasted about 4 hours. The service was amazing as well.  It's kind of like a subtle orchestra in the background.  Your water glass is refilled without you even noticing, as you finish one plate, someone comes and takes it, as you finish one wine, an empty clean glass is put in front of you for the next pairing.  It was exactly what fine dinning experience should be like.  I also love that there is a huge pablic parking lot right across the street...ladies, you can put on your highest heels if you wish for a night out.

We will definetly be returning, maybe even as early as next week :)"}
{"text":"Here's the deal with George:  it IS expensive.  If you're going to be bothered by that fact during or after your meal then don't bother.  The chef and staff offer a unique take on food, wine and the dining experience - the dishes are unusual, small and designed for foodies who appreciate the creativity and effort that goes into their preparation.

I admit to being something of a skeptic - would I have discerned the difference between the two fiddleheads served with my wild boar?  Likely not.  Nor is the businessman in me particularly pleased with the return on my investment on the following day.

On the other hand:  the setting IS quite romantic - particularly the patio when the weather cooperates - and the food IS delicious.  Wine pairings are thoughtful - short pours are recommended.  And the staff is attentive and professional.

So on occasion I'm quite happy to embrace this eclectic, romantic, and slightly silly restaurant, and simply have fun with it and my friends."}
{"text":"Went here for an anniversary diner and was not disappointed.

We went for the 10-course tasting menu - while the pot legion sizes per plate were a little small, after 10 such plates we were definitely stuffed.

Waiter also made a great wine pricing for the meal (we opted to not go with the larger wine pairing menu) and we were very satisfied / we also appreciated the fact that he didn't just recommend the most expensive wine on the menu!

Evening was great but will withhold 1-star due to the price - meal was great, but seeing the bill at the end of the night wasn't."}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday.  Was absolutely amazing.  The service was exceptional, the food was unbelievable and the drinks were original.  One of the best restaurants in Toronto hands down.  Will be frequenting this place more often."}
{"text":"Been to this place 3x. Dont know why i kept going back.

If u like foie gras this place is the best. If you're getting the tasting menu i suggest u think again.

The first time i went to george i got the 10 course and dinner took like 4.5 - 5 hours. I was with 2 other people and we were all falling asleep. It was a pain to keep our eyes open and we couldnt enjoy the dinner. 

Service here is excellent- my waiter offered a cab for me all 3 times and even went outside himself to hail one down for me. You go to the washroom and come back and your napkin is refolded and the table has been cleaned with the knife so there are no crumbs.

My issue with this restaurant is strictly that it takes way too long. There's also so much staff standing around doing nothing. I cant imagine coming here and not getting foie gras."}
{"text":"Erin H must have gone there on an off night. I went there and had a fantastic experience. Try and get the private table if you can..I think it is #34? Great food( tasting menu), wonderful selection of wine with great service. Best part is;they do not rush you through your meal.The staff is very professional and the food and decor is top notch!"}
{"text":"I dined at George back in December on my first trip to Toronto. Coming from NYC I didn't expect to be blown away, but I have to admit... It was the best dining experience I've had in over a year!!!! The food was phenomenal (taste, presentation, ingredients) with an extensive vegetarian menu. Our server, Philip, was fantastic (he was friendly and knowledgeable) and the ambiance was both cozy and romantic. We even enjoyed the wine recommendation so much that we took a picture of the bottle so we could order some when we got back to NYC! I hope I can return to Toronto soon so I can have another amazing meal at this beyond amazing restaurant. :)"}
{"text":"Friendly, quick, and tasty. Considering the location, this place manages to be refreshingly low key. I always get the Irish breakfast and it always hits the spot. Excellent coffee too! Been a dozen times, always a good experience. Sometimes there's a wait because they're often quite full."}
{"text":"We had relatively high expectations, having dined at a number of fine restaurants in the US and Canada. We opted for the tasting menu, which was unlike any tasting menu I've ever had, as all 3 diners at our table received completely different meals. While the meats were well cooked, and the food was decent, it was very one note. Our service was acceptable, but not at the level I was expecting for the price and style of meal. There are definitely better options for the value to be had, and I was really sad that this meal felt more like a miss."}
{"text":"I'm new at Yelp and realized after posting 2 negative reviews, I should take a minute to say something nice about a great restaurant experience.  So here we go.  The last truly delicious meal I ate in a restaurant was at George.  It was way back in November so I can't recall what I ordered.  There were 6 of us, we shared several small plates and each was a revelation.  I cook well myself but these dishes were out of my league.  Our bill came to well over $200 (for 2 with a couple of beers each) but since then I've had several deflating restaurant ventures for less money that have left me feeling robbed.  Nice ambience and warm, helpful service.  Try it for a special night out."}
{"text":"I wish I could be here more often so I could eat at George restaurant. This place is amazing,  the food is amazing.  We loved every bite we were able to eat."}
{"text":"We did 7 course + 10 course tasting menu.  I would say 13 out of 17 of them were outstanding plates.  They made in in such a way that all of them are different.

The plating was excellent.  Crab, lobster, tuna, rabbit, creme brulee, bison were all excellent!"}
{"text":"By no means am I a food connoisseur, but this was probably one of the best dinners I've had so far in Toronto. 

We ordered the 10 course, which took over 3 hours for the full dining experience. Every course was plated to perfection. Our table received two different kinds of dish for each of the 10 courses, so it would be nice to trade with a friend in order to try all 20 different dishes. 10 courses is actually a lot of food, as I was starting to get full after the 7th or 8th.

The service here was a definite 5/5 as the waiter was very attentive. They would even come around to scrape off the food from the table (oops, as a slightly messy eater!)

Would come here again, but probably next year as it is pricey!"}
{"text":"Recently did the 10 course tasting menu at George and have to say, it blew me away. The service was outstanding, and the food was amazing."}
{"text":"I have been to half a dozen of gastronomic restaurants, mostly in France, and was looking forward to this place's vegetarian menu.
Well, we have never had such terrible food. In any restaurant, that is. The whole table agreed. Depending on what you pick together in your plate, the flavor associations are okay or just plain BAD. It just tasted freaking bad and all we could speak about is how bad every single plate tasted. The chef tried, obviously, but failed. Your part is to eat and still pay full price.

I really tried to like what was in my plate, I really did, but after a while, the realization that you'd better have cooked yourself pasta at home is a hard blow to your self-esteem as the person who chose to go there. I had to break the ice and start criticizing the food first so my guests would feel more at ease. They all HATED their food. So embarrassing. 
So don't be the guy with bad taste. Don't bring your vegetarian friends there. Unless you secretly hate vegetarians, then, GREAT. Good for you. Meat eater.

Now, if you really have to go lose your money to this place, fun tip: just say away from the vegetarian menu!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Had an awesome 7-course tasting meal. The food was done creatively and the staff was very attentive and professional to our needs."}
{"text":"We had an amazing experience. The food was great. The service awesome. The space wonderful. For our first time we didn't want to do the tasting. I'm sure Lorenzo had put a lot of effort to create his standard dishes so why not start with them. I liked the sour touch either by an orange or grapefruit to balance the cream of every dish. Only downside I would recommend to reconsider his oil or butter choice when stir frying veggies etc. It is tasteless. I understand it cannot cover the aromas of the fresh veggies etc - OmG those tiny mushrooms were so tasty- but maybe Mediterranean or Greek olive oil or something more aromatic could add a note.
Overall satisfied with the experience and of course Ian who was wonderful answering all my questions with straight forward friendly professionalism"}
{"text":"One of my new favourites in Toronto! The decor is very chic and romantic. The service was excellent, and the dishes were all unique, flavourful and filling!

We did one 7 course and one 5 course meal (usually it's not allowed but it was not as busy). I can't remember them all now but there was an octopus carpaccio, bison steak, swordfish, duck breast, sushi roll, etc. with amazing sides! All the flavours blended beautifully. For dessert I had a flourless chocolate cake, which was way better than any other I've had ( I find flourless cake dry usually)"}
{"text":"I love this place. Went there for our anniversary and had the tasting menu.  Each of us had a different dish for every course, and I loved each one (delicious). It's great for special occasions and romantic as well. I would definitely go there again, especially for a celebration."}
{"text":"Came here for an occasion for the first time and it was great. The servers were really helpful and attentive. Food was great and each dish was plated very nicely. 

A great place for special occasions! Will return and try their tasting menu"}
{"text":"The Ricotta Gnocchi is to die for! It's like eating little clouds straight from heaven. Best gnocchi I've ever had in my life. This place is great, the food is fantastic for lack of a better adjective, and the service is good. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"5/5! Amazing food, fantastic service, romantic ambiance and great memories! Overall, a fantastic restaurant for a milestone celebration! I recommend the tasting menu - get the wine pairing of you want to go all out. It's not a place you can go to regularly because of the price but it's an experience everyone should engage in at least once :)"}
{"text":"Amazing service lives at George. Each plate of food was beautifully composed, visually and by taste. I highly recommend this place if you're looking to treat yourself or a loved one."}
{"text":"Amazing. Foie Gras best I've ever had. We did the 7 tasting course and food was plenty without feeling stuffed. Was debating between wine pairing and just bottle of wine for table, and we decided to do bottle. 7 2.5oz glasses of wine sounded like a lot. Food was fantastic, will definitely come back again. Worth every penny!"}
{"text":"I recently attended a wedding at George and was impressed by the quality of the food and the superb and professional service.  Weddings do not normally command the best from the kitchen, but they delivered finely crafted and delicious dishes to over 70 people without missing a beat.

It is hard to believe that the basically open kitchen is right next to the dining area - it is pleasantly quiet despite the level of activity!

Some servers were gracious, some were perfunctory, but all performed their jobs professionally.  We were very impressed by the friendly bar staff."}
{"text":"Excellent service. Food was superb. Highly recommended for a special occasion or to impress your date!

We did a 7 course tasting menu and a 5 course. We went slightly earlier in the evening (6:45pm) and the server said the chef was ok with it. Usually the whole table has to do the same thing.

All the dishes were different. I had a dungeness crab roll (SO good!), seared foie gras on duck breast (cooked to perfection, best I've ever had), beef steak, fruits and an apple crisp dessert. My bf had seared fish sashimi, some cold shrimp dish, octopus, foie gras on duck breast (in a different sauce than mine), rack of lamb, fruits, and a chocolate cake.

I was really impressed with how the food turned out. Our server was also really nice, not pushy at all and came to check on us at the right times. He knew we were celebrating our anniversary and when the dessert came out, it had \"Happy 6th Anniversary\" written with chocolate sauce on the plate! Nice touch :)

By 7:30pm the place was all packed. Definitely need to make reservations on a weekend."}
{"text":"George is such a beautiful romantic restaurant, the patio is quaint and designed very nicely. Went here for an anniversary dinner and we opted for the 7 course meal with wine pairing. Every dish came looking artistic and tasted amazing. I was so impressed with our wine waiter, as soon as our dishes were placed on the table he came out with 2 bottles of wine for the pairing and he was knowledgeable about every single one. The price for this experience is so worth it, highly recommend the tasting menu with wine paring!"}
{"text":"Had a great time here one night when traveling for work. Can't remember the details about the meal because we saw Woody Harrelson dining there!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant and service.  They will ask if you are celebrating anything in particular and will accommodate accordingly.  I went for an anniversary and was seated at a private enclave.

Food:  Great and complicated.  Lots of components but I appreciate how there is almost always an acidic component and texture component.  Expect surprise Asian flavours.  I had the 5 course tasting menu and they are chef choice and different dishes for each patron.  Great seasonal and local ingredient use.

Amuse bouche:  Had a heirloom tomato and shitake mushroom.  Hints of sesame oil.  Again nice acidic undertones.

App:  Dungeness crab, green beans, brulee avocado.  Nice balance of acidity and crunch.  The other side, tuna and fennel salad again balanced with great anise components in the fish and salad.  Lightly seasoned fish, the salad stole the show.

Fois gras course.  CHOOSE IT.  You can't trust anyone who doesn't like fois gras.  Mine was with squab.  The fois jus was just great.  Perfectly seared served with roasted root vegetables.  The other side had lima beans and different poultry.

Mains:  Lamb with surprising wasabi crust.  Amazing STRONG lamb flavour.  Too often people try to dairy out the gameyness of lamb which is a shame.  Ontario corn in the side was great.  The other side had one of the best ribeyes that I've ever had.  Topped with a cherry based jus but I find that orange peel was dominating.  This was the only dish that I thought wasn't as well balanced as it was rich on rich with a side of artichokes with pesto and a cheesey bread.

Cheese course and then dessert.  I had a sponge cake with caramel and an ice cream that tasted like gin for some reason.  Overall pleasant.

Overall great experience.  Love the use of cherries and corn appropriate for Ontario and season."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch - great outside patio, had a wonderful waitress & time here all the food was incredible I just wish I had had a chance to make it for dinner! Try the perogies :)"}
{"text":"My new favourite restaurant!!! Gorgeous place with delicious food. We had 7 course testing menu. Each meal was super delicious and  beautifully presented.

Staff is polite and very professional.

Fantastic place for a date or any other special occasion."}
{"text":"George is a pleasure to dine at - one of the best kept secrets in downtown Toronto. Only steps away from the Eaton Centre, it offers a serene and classy environment with a quality of dining that is of great value.  Meals use simple ingredients crafted in delicate presentations.  Portions are not large, but very tasty and memorable.  Chef Loseto is magnificent. Perfect for a romantic dinner or business lunch!  Patio in back is great."}
{"text":"Had a great experience here - with one hiccup. 

Came here for a birthday celebration and had the 7 course tasting menu with the wine pairing. What amazes me was that because one of us had a nut allergy, our tasting menus were completely different, which means I got to taste 14 different dishes that night! The wines that came with the dishes (again, the two of us did not have a glass that was the same) were paired well. I must say, they were very generous with the amount of wine in each glass. At one point during the dinner, I had 4 different wine glasses in front of me because I haven't finished them. 

The only hiccup that occurred was that during our 5th course, one of the servers mixed up the dishes and my boyfriend, who has the nut allergy, was given the dish with nuts. Fortunately, we were able to discover it early... when we told the manager/sommelier he responded very promptly. Despite the incident, I was impressed with the way the situation was handled.   

I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"If you are willing to splurge this is amongst the best food I've had on the planet.  I've only been twice for very special occasions for the $200 5-course + wine fixed price menu.  Food, wine and service are amongst the best I've had on the planet.  I'd put George against any Michelin star restaurant.

My wife is strictly vegetarian (I eat anything), and also agrees George is amazing.  And the few friends that got past the heafty price tag and actually visited gave it rave reviews."}
{"text":"Exceptional cuisine, service, and atmosphere. Wonderful dining room, friendly professional accommodating service. Dishes are well thought out, and wonderfully executed. I always leave wanting to come back. Superb wine list, wide menu. Easily rivals some of the best restos in the city and beyond."}
{"text":"A quick trip to Toronto for a wedding at George. And some is the best dishes ever! Rare experience for a wedding dinner, for sure.

Great service and truly impressive spread. Delicious flavors, perfect portions. Super fresh. 

A gorgeous space w/ a sexy combo of rustic  & chic. 

Plus there are ultra swank hotel rooms upstairs, too. You know, in case you get lucky!"}
{"text":"Adored our al fresco lunch here today.  Came because they are civilized enough to take lunch reservations for outside tables, and that's rare in Toronto.  Blown away.

Great service, and delicious food.  Started with a roasted celery with miso soup, and had the veal main.  Companions had pasta and scallops; delish.

Great environment both outside and in. A winner."}
{"text":"It was good food, prepared right by the book and looked lovely o the plate. That is for sure. And the interior was very cozy and nice. BUT...

Pro: 
- good ingredients, and well prepared food by the book, interesting arrangement on plate
- the wines were the highlight: Excellent choices and the sommelier was very friendly, explained and suggested and offered us a little tasting of his favourites to choose from. Thank you, it was great!

Con:
- the music was SO loud that it was really difficult keeping up conversations that evening
- we were looking for a true tasting experience with surprising flavours and creative combinations. We did not find it that evening. It tasted good, but no real wow factors (like \"how did they do that, this is awesome\") in taste, more in looks.

If we are back, we will stop by for appetisers and some wine... Maybe we'll become fans one day..."}
{"text":"A plus. Great service.  Tried all 3 courses amazing taste and presentation"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a reminder that food can be emotional, even therapeutic. Going to George is like taking your pallet to a spa. It's pricy but unforgettable.

First things first. There is an a la carte menu but that's not why you go to George. You go for the chef tasting menu. We did 7 courses and added the wine pairing - our waiter was also a sommelier so that made things better.

Each course is a tapas sized plate, and not everyone at the table has the same course. There were three of us and each had a different item than the other at every single course.

I cannot repeat to you every dish but I can tell you that they included meats, seafood, vegetables, sauces, spices, cheeses, all flavoured that danced on my tongue. And the wines selected were outstanding.

Another small but crucial item is that the bartender knows what he is doing with cocktails. I recommend the Hendricks hurricane.

I could not recommend this restaurant any more. It is clear why this is considered to be one of the best, and possibly the best, restaurant in Toronto. It is expensive but worth it. What an experience."}
{"text":"I stopped in here for dinner with my wine group. They opened with some sushi that was made with sticky rice that was ok, and the wasabi was very mild. Next up came black cod that was delicious, very and well prepared. Then came the lamb that was a perfect cut of meat, perfectly prepared and very tasty. We finished with dessert that was also excellent. All in all the meal was exquisite. Service was attentive and very prompt and accommodating. I let them know of an allergy and they were very good about it. I can't think of anyway the night could have been more magical. I can highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"The patio during summer time feels like a vacation on its own. Came here for a first date but would be so cute with a couple girl friends and a bottle of wine. Feel is impeccably fresh, fine dining at its finest."}
{"text":"I've heard and walked about George so many times. Today I decided is the day I'm going to try it. I'm so happy I did! The food and service were exquisite. My partner and I decided to go with 5 course tasting menu. We were welling to explore and be at the chief's mercy. Again, we were super happy We did!
This is the place for that special occasion you wanted to treat yourself or someone special to. 
Out bill came to a total of just over $400 including tip. We order 2, 5 course tasting, a bottle of wine and 2 additional glasses of wine!

Definitely with it!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Stellar service. Great Atmosphere. 

While in Toronto, four of us decided to try this place out. We each had the 7 course tasting menu, and the wine pairing. The meal was delicious, very refined and delicate flavours. The foie gras just melts in your mouth.

If you get a chance, it's definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"Best restaurant experience in a long time. Great food, drinks, and service.

Love the fact that for the chef selection, you each get different dishes, so we got to eat half of each and swap. We also got some great wines that were very different from the norm, such as the Dolia orange wine, Lanciola (the summer equivalent of ice wine) and the Brachetto D'Acqui

Only criticisms are that the pan fried sea bream's skin was a little hard (but otherwise very nicely flakey) and the little side things that came with the espresso dessert did not complement it at all. Otherwise, everything was delicious and plated well. 

The only big downside is the price. Definitely cannot afford eating here more than once, unless you're made of money ($99 for the 5 course meal, $125 for 7... $140 for 10. We went with 7 which gives an amuse bouche, three appetizers, a main, a cheese platter and a dessert. All relatively small so you don't explode from a food overdose mid-way!)"}
{"text":"I came for my birthday last year, and found this was still my favourite restaurant after a year so we came back. Everyone did the five tasting courses and it was all delicious! I loved the mains of beef and lamb and the creme brûlée dessert was heavenly. The service was good and attentive, even made sure to ask about pasteurized cheeses. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"On George's website, they state:
\"...the Chef does not use trans- fats, partially hydrogenated oils or butter sauces. Also very little cream with no cream reductions. Our plates consist of moderate amounts of protein with an emphasis on wild fish and meat from wherever possible, free grazing animals. Seasonal vegetables and fruits are selected... The kitchen makes everything from scratch including all breads and pastries. ...\"

That being said, my experience at George was a tad underwhelming. Here's my experience with their 7 course tasting menu: ($130 per person) 

What I loved:
1. The starter bread was delicious - we shamelessly finished off two baskets. The wait time in between dishes may have encouraged us to stuff our faces with carbs.. 

2. The dishes were intricately plated and every ingredient was fresh and complemented each other. My favourite was probably the beef cheeks and steelhead trout with roasted parsnip and pomegranate salad. 

3. Our server was a sweetheart. He was knowledgeable about every item on the menu and made great suggestions on the cocktails based on the fact I liked fruity and tart drinks. He consistently came back to light our candle because for some reason it kept blowing out. He also has ninja skills when we went to the restrooms, he would rush over to fold our napkins. 

4. Although we both ordered the 7-course tasting menu, none of our dishes were the same. We had the opportunity to try out each other's dishes, which was fantastic. 

What needs improvement: 
1. The meal took around four hours to complete. I felt that the breaks in between each dish was dragged out for too long. It shouldn't take that long to prepare the food when everyone else who ordered the tasting menu had the same things serves to them.  (ie. the table next to us) 

2. Cramped seating - we were cramped up against a wall and the table next to us was so close I had to be wary not to knock things over on their table when I took washroom breaks. The whole time we had to listen to a conversation of new couple who MMM'd and gasped at every dish. I would prefer the private table next to the entrance next time. 

3. Our server was taking care of too many tables to be attentive to everyone. My water glass was empty most of the time, and it was difficult to flag him down to get refilled. 

4. The decor was very random, as the table next to us was complaining about. The chandeliers didn't match the drapes and the wall decor felt oddly out of place. It was like they threw together random items from Kensington market and attempted a hipster look. 

I've tried numerous tasting menus in Toronto, and I didn't feel like this was a 5-star experience. The food was good and the plating was gorgeous, but they need to work on the timing of each dish and the attentiveness to each table. Also, if you aren't a fan of small portions, George isn't the place for you if you're looking to leave with a full belly."}
{"text":"Food is beautiful and absolutely delicious. My husband and I had the 5 course tasting menu. The service was excellent and our server was so kind about my food allergies. 

The food was delicious and most dishes were very intricate with some new flavour combinations, and some dishes with classic flavours. Overall food for this price was 4/5 but based on the overall dining experience (how the timed our food, service, etc) and ambiance, I think it's 4.5/5.

Definitely a great place for a special occasion."}
{"text":"After an exceptional meal, this restaurant is one of my favourites in Toronto. Beautiful food and seamless service.

My boyfriend and I both had the seven course tasting menu. The tasting menu is different for each diner, so we had 14 different plates. The food was gorgeous, with intense, complex, and expertly wedded flavours on every plate. Intelligent portioning meant that we left satisfied rather than overfull. We each ordered two cocktails: one from the traditional menu, and one from the artisinal menu. My Don Draper's classic was my favourite drink of the night, with light, refreshing cherry flavours. 

The service was very professional, though our waiter had a slight snobbishness typical of places with this kind of pricetag. Overall, though, we were both impressed with the level of service. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"We chose to do the tasting menu (7 course) with the wine pairing. Our experience with the staff, the food and the atmosphere was absolutely brilliant! Courses were delivered with detailed and interesting descriptions of the wine pairing. Each plate is unique for in reality a couple will receive 14 plates and 4 wines which creates an amazing variety throughout the evening.

We took pictures of the food, the wine and the restaurant as we went along. Neither Laura nor I could imagine how this could have been a better experience.

Highly recommend making George Restaurant a priority if you are ever in Toronto"}
{"text":"This was a fine dining experience for sure. It's a romantic place to celebrate a special day. I wouldn't come here unless it was for a special occasion such as a birthday or anniversary. It's very pricy but you get what you pay for. My date and I got the 5 course chef tasting menu, which was about $110 per person. Each person got a different dish which was surprising and fun, we got to taste each others dishes. Everything was great I especially enjoyed the foie Gras dish and the beef tenderloin dish. I wasn't a fan of the dessert though, it wasn't anything special, I've had much better dessert elsewhere. To sum it up it was a great experience and I would come here again for a special occasion."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to going with my husband for his birthday but I found even though there were interesting combinations of foods on the tasting menu it didn't have that much taste/flavour. The lamb chops were soggy. The raw tuna was good and flavourful but that was it. One of the dishes was a cheese plate and they give you one tiny piece of cheese. You would think for a bill that comes to almost $500 for two people for the seven item tasting menu and the basic bottle of wine there would be a little more WOW factor with three pieces of cheese. Like a soft Brie, a goat and a hard cheese at a minimum. But not so..

The service was very good so I gave it a three-star rating but I would only give the food a two star rating. A person has to know the very best before they can say it's the best.  Perhaps I am spoiled with time I spend in France and eating good food."}
{"text":"It's a short walk from the Eaton center and this place is easy to miss while walking east on Queen Street.  If you hit Moss Park you've gone too far and being hungry might not be your only concern.

George is a beautiful restaurant.
High ceilings, sparkling light fixtures, who would have thought it used to be a chocolate factory?  It's romantic and ambient (Note to self - return on date).

We ordered a la carte because we were with a big group.
I would return with a smaller group for the tasting menu.
The tasting menu is popular here but everyone at the table has to order it.

The price ranges for the tasting menu depending on the number of courses.  5 Courses for $99 up to 10 courses for $150.  Vegetarian tasting options are available as well.

If you are ordering items off the menu, they recommend three items as a minimum.  The portions are quite small -- appropriate for an 80 pound girl or mid-sized child.

The service here was spectacular.  The waitstaff was knowledgeable and spent time going through the menu items and highlighted the focus on presentation and pairing of items.  Even though the portions are small, all the items are creativity assembled and unique.

As an amuse bouche, they served a small vegetable samosa with mango chutney  Crispy, sweet, and savoury, it definitely made you curious about how the other items would be served.

For a first, I ordered the Wagyu Beef.
There was good sized portion of almost rare fatty Wagyu with mustard and a skewer of  crispy potato bits ($24).  This was my favourite item of the evening.  The Wagyu was flavourful and served slightly cool and it was delightful to eat.

None of the seconds appealed to me, so I jumped to a third.
The Veal Tenderloin was recommended and it was flavourful and beautifully presented with a zucchini tempura.  Even though it's a \"third\", it's only about 2-3 oz of veal.  It was accompanied with goat cheese which worked well with the different textures on the plate ($26).  

Ok, the only item I wish I didn't order was the seafood bisque ($10).
It wasn't what I expected at all.  It was a thin and watery soup topped with foam.  I could have had another cocktail instead.

The cocktail menu had some interesting drinks.
I loved the drink I ordered!  Too bad it's not the type of drink you can order by the pitcher!  The have full size drinks ($16) and half size ($9) drinks available.

Why is there even a small size available? Just drink water.
I ordered my full size Madame Yvette.  Tanqueray, Crème Yvette, St. Germain, Lemon Juice, Vanilla Simple Syrup & Egg Whites.

I might have to name my first born daughter after this drink.

An another unique thing about George is their tea menu.
Not a lot of places have a real bound separate menu for teas with detailed descriptions and a bit of history.

I chose a green tea infused with rose.  The water was the perfect temperature.
I would have to say, the perfect cup of tea for a near-perfect dinner (except for that soup!).  Apparently, there is a tea society that the restaurant provides tea service too.

I'll be back for the tasting menu..and maybe to crash a tea party!"}
{"text":"First time with my hubby trying this highly acclaimed restaurant.  We went for the 7 course tasting menu.  If you are a big eater it might not be enough food, portion wise. But we were stuffed. Overall, we really enjoyed each dish. Between the 2 of us, we had 16 different dishes, dessert was served on 1 plate but have 4 variety.  On the food, I was impressed and would definitely recommend this place.  Ambience is quite nice but not outstanding.  Service was not impressive. Our server came off quite aloof.  Didn't provide any info unless asked and even then, short answers. No one ever asked us if everything is ok.  For a restaurant at this scale, I did not expect to experience service at this level."}
{"text":"Best tasting menu I've tried in Toronto. Finally I find the place does the duck right!"}
{"text":"Good looking place . Good food . Good service . But I was not wowed as I expected it to be . It seemed like another upscale restaurant for me . But you can try . The crowd was more mature and the vibe is good."}
{"text":"Superb for such success establishment.

You have to try their testing menu totally worth the price but make sure you have enough time to do so (from 2-4hr easy). It is for ppl who loves food and enjoy the creativity which can't be rushed. 

Server is par but great manager. Great wine selection to pair with your enjoyment and food - even on house wine! You don't get too many in Canada. 

Return - every time"}
{"text":"Fine dining has been ruined for me after this epic meal. My wife and I came here for our anniversary dinner (gotta splurge a bit haha) and we went for the ten-course tasting menu.  Four hours later, I was trying hard not to descend into a food coma. My iPhone pics definitely don't do justice and I can't remember half the food I was eating (although the foie gras, lamb, crab cake were standouts).  I was just pretending to know what the servers were talking about when they were describing the dishes. :) Everything was excellent. From the presentation to the flavours to the ingredients to the colours , etc.  I was amazed at how all these different elements can come together so perfectly.  On top of all that, the service was great and their cocktails were really good (definitely recommend their Old Fashioned).  Obviously I don't get to do this very often at all, but I can't imagine there being another restaurant that can pull this off (I like Canoe, but sorry, this was on another level). My wife and I both came away from this meal thinking that it was definitely memorable and one of the best we have ever had.  Highly recommended for those special occasions. :)"}
{"text":"I have been to George over 10 times now and I would have to say it is the Tried-and-Tested staple in the Toronto fine dining scene.  

The food is good, its delicious actually but like a previous reviewer said it lacks the wow! factor. It's modern Canadian Cuisine but I would say one or two visits there and you kind of know what's coming and what pairings they typically put together with certain foods.  

Things to keep in mind if you are planning a tasting menu option mention this when you are booking a table as sometimes they are not able to accommodate a tasting menu due to time restrictions (ie. if your booking is 10pm they will not start a 10 course tasting).  

Tthe ambiance is great.  It is laid back yet formal and romantic all at the same time.  The service is always amazing and the sommelier is top notch as well.  again I would definitely recommend going if you haven't been."}
{"text":"This is an amazing place for a romantic dinner. It's quite pricey, but the service and the quality of the ingredients and creativity of the chef is really worth it.
I had the vegan discovery menu and was really blown away.
The wine and Champagne were very good."}
{"text":"Great surprise from their 7 courses tasting menu. Went for a bday celebration with my hubby and he love the wine collection they has. The wine pairing was amazing and well worth the price! Even we both ordered the 7 courses, our food were all differently presented. Love the cozy environment and food presentation. Will definitely visit again"}
{"text":"Simply Excellent.  My wife and I went there for our 10th anniversary and we tried their five course meal.  The experience was second to none.  The chef(s) toy with your senses and taste buds.  On a few occasion I would try to breakdown the ingredients in my food with no success.  The food was like a melody in the mouth.  I highly recommend this place.  

The waitress was very friendly and the servants each explained the dish in great detail and answered questions.   

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Amazing service, great food, and the restaurant decor is quite nice! 

My family came here for the Mother's Day lunch 3-course à la carte menu, which presented 3 options for each the appetizer, main, and dessert. I ordered the smoked tomato soup to start, the salmon as a main, and the chocolate mousse as dessert.

They served a generous basket of bread and scones, of which, they had this delicious bread coated in oil/butter (almost like a focaccia bread). The tomato soup was pretty good - very strong and rich in flavour, but a bit too sour for my liking. The salmon was juicy and perfectly tender, but what really stood out to me in this dish was the delicious bed of scalloped potatoes it rested on (my mouth is literally watering as I recall these potatoes). Overall, I really enjoyed my main. The cornish hen is also a delight, as I had a taste of my sister's. As for the dessert, the chocolate mousse was really rich and good, but too heavy to finish. 

Although I thought of my overall experience only as pretty good, I would love to return to try the regular tasting menus, for which they are more known."}
{"text":"It's hard to believe that George restaurant is located close to Moss Park, which I believe, is considered to be one of the lower income neighbourhoods of Toronto. As I was trying to cross the street to George, an old, haggard man was shouting he was going to kill people while spitting on the ground and waving his arms furiously. Dramatic introduction.

Intro. The restaurant was already very busy at 7pm and I spotted my friends in a circular table by the exit. I had to ask my boyfriend to check my coat as we by-passed the hostess. No one immediately came by and I was starting to get antsy. When I had made my reservations I told the hostess that everyone in the table wanted to participate in the 7 course tasting menu. A waiter soon came up and I mentioned to him that we \"were ready to start.\" He told me one moment as he went to grab the menu's. Anyways, it was a moot point because as soon as he finished handing out the menu's, I said we wanted to participate in the tasting menu with wine pairing.

Food. It was interesting as for each set of the tasting menu, 5 of us would get different plates of food. I liked that idea as it kept it interesting, but it also kind of sucked if your friend received a plate of food that you preferred over yours. In truth, I have no idea how the waiters decide who gets which plate. The wine was nothing special in my opinion, but it did go well with the food.

Service. It was very efficient but there was no one main waiter who made the night. You know the one that jokes, keeps it lights, is so personable that you wouldn't mind leaving a hunk of a tip...For each set of the tasting menu, different waiters would come and explain the dish. The only guy who would remain the same was the sommelier, but he was there to explain the wine...not participate in banter with the table.

All in all, I am glad I tried George out. The food was all very delicious, but I think I was expecting something more WOW, especially for the price. I wouldn't come out of my way to host a birthday event at George again (which was what this event was about). I would, however, like to try the patio during the summer, but definitely with their regular menu.

The 7 course tasting menu with wine pairing is not cheap, and actually, one of the most expensive tasting menu's I have had in Toronto. Something you should try, but once is enough."}
{"text":"I had a great dinner at George restaurant during my vacation to Toronto. The restaurant executed on all fronts. 

Food: I was torn between the tasting menus and ordering off the a la carte menu. The waiter explained that the a la carte menu varies nightly and by guest. He went on to say that he saw various items come out the kitchen for the tasting menu that night. I took this to mean that there was not a set menu. Since I wasn't fully aware of the background of the chef and restaurant, other than this being one of the top restaurants in the city; I decided not to risk my experience on the unknown. 
  
The Lobster appetizer - large chuck of lobster, avocado and quinoa. It was outstanding 
Salad - simply prepared with lettuce, a few tomato slices, diced cucumbers and a little feta cheese. Nice and light. 
Ahi Tuna - the server stated that this was the chef's speciality. It was very good. Served with mixed veggies. 
Cornish Hen - another good option for the second course, but I liked the Ahi Tuna better. 
Halibut - this was an excellent selection. It was very fresh and favorable. I loved the veggies and purée that accompanied this dish. It could have been bigger, but then I might not have had room for dessert. 
Wild Boar - This was good but didn't hold a candle to the Halibut. 
Cheese course - exceeded my expectations. After a small discussion of likes and dislikes, the waiter selected my options for me. I loved everything on the plate. The cheese was served with apples, berries, nuts, jam and crostini. 
Beignets filled with Nutella - I was stuffed, so I opted for a small dessert. This was perfect. 

The wines were very good. We had a bottle of Pinot Noir from Oregon. There was also a good wine list by the glass. I learned later in the night that there was a selection of wines that are opened each night that you can purchase by the glass. I tasted a few and then had a nice glass of Sauvignon Blanc from Niagara. 

The service was good. Our server started out a little sassy, but then went out of his way to make our experience memorable. 

The atmosphere is comfortable with a little touch of rustic/home/winter cabin feel."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, Great food and service. Nothing else can be said-just try it for yourself. It's one of the best fine dining restaurants in Toronto."}
{"text":"I use only two criteria to rate restaurants.  Either I would go back or I wouldn't.  My rating for George on Queen.  I would not feel compelled to ever go back."}
{"text":"Our go-to place for special occasions (a little pricey for a regular Friday night out).  The menu is always interesting and the food is consistently good.  Great wine list too.  The service is professional, yet friendly.  Definitely worth the splurge!"}
{"text":"No words at how delicious everything was. Extremely pricey but it was a culinary sensation"}
{"text":"Five stars! Hands down one of the best restaurants in Toronto. We did the seven course tasting menu with wine pairings. Each dish was different and incredible. I couldn't speak more highly of our sommelier who provided beautiful pairings with our dishes.  It's a three hour dining experience that's worth every penny!"}
{"text":"Dined here in spring of 2014. Best food I've ever had at a restaurant! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This is the by far the best place I been to EVER!!!.  It is very pricey but worth every damn penny.  The 5 course tasting menu was huge; I was so stuffed at the end.  You and your partner will not get the same dishes so we got 10 different courses to try together. Pretty sick!!  Dinner was long but we loved every min of it.  I will need to start saving money now so I can come back again haha."}
{"text":"Overall - 4.5 stars - food was fantastic, service was good

Our table just order 3 courses - my favorite in terms of flavor was the duck breast,   Lobster was tasty and the home made bread was awesome too.  Bites of the pork loin and raw sea scallops were pleasing.  Was jealous of my partner's strip loin and think that was the best of all, as my tuna was a bit too seared for sushi rare.   The table order gnooch was pleasing, but probably would not order again.  Some other observations, our waiter was efficient but seemed like he had a bit too many tables, but our sommelier was very helpful and attentive.  The mixed drinks were also creative and tasty.  I like my paper plane and my partner really like the Rhubarb and Amaretto Sour.   Our table was right next to the kitchen which was fantastic to see everybody hard at work.  Would definitely come back here on my next trip."}
{"text":"Amazing fine dining experience. Since this was my first time here we both opted for the five course tasting menu. Each dish was delicious and refine and the foie gras particularly was divine. One of the best places to try for any special occasion."}
{"text":"Great restaurant! Came here the other night and had such a good time. Definitely a good place to come if you want to celebrate an anniversary or birthday bc the ambiance is really nice - romantic, soft lighting, mood music that's not too loud, and attentive service. 

We decided to share one 5-course tasting menu and some items from the a la carte. Personally thought that the 5-course option was plenty of food, and that we would have been good with just 1 or 2 additional items, but we ordered 3 and could barely stand up at the end of the meal. Happy and stuffed!

The tasting menu is really great and you need at least 2 hours to enjoy it. I actually loved most of the dishes that we had from the tasting menu - it was a great sequence of dishes and the flavours really built from each course to the next. Started off with some ceviche that was a good light start to the meal with a great blend of textures and flavours. Then our next dish was roasted duck with foie gras. This was so flavourful and was a lot heavier than the first dish. The main was the lamb, good but almost a step down from the duck dish which was so lavish. Then we had a cheese board and finished with a banana pound cake and mousse dessert, which were a perfect end to the meal.

From the a la carte, we had the gnocchi, ahi tuna wrapped in potato, and beef short ribs. My favorite was the tuna - it was so delicious and the flavour combinations were the bomb!"}
{"text":"Wow!  If you are looking for a place to have a special dinner I highly recommend doing the 5, 7, or 10 course tasting menu with wine pairings.  It has to be one of the top three dining experiences we have ever had.  The food, wine, ambiance, and service were PERFECT.

My husband were in Toronto celebrating our last weekend as a duo before our baby arrives on September 7th (adopting!).  I had explained in the reservation that it was a special \"last hurrah\" dinner and they went out of their way to make it perfect.  We sat outside on a beautiful evening (better than inside in our opinion - string lights, candles, in a courtyard, so romantic) and our waitress comes up right away with a huge smile to congratulate us on the adoption and that everything is about to be perfect.  No lie.  Between her, the sous chefs explaining each of the 7 courses, and the sommelier explaining each of the 8 wines...it was beyond.  The food way amazing, unique and unlike a lot of tasting menus, all the courses my husband had were different from the ones I had.  He has 7 courses and 8 wines picked for him and I had 7 courses and 8 different wines picked for me.  It was really impressive and the pairings were amazing.  

There are times when you're like \"we are so lucky and people are being so good to us\" and this dining experience was definitely one of those times.  As we walk out so full, a little drunk, and so happy it felt like everyone in the restaurant was congratulating us and wishing us well.  Awesome.  So awesome."}
{"text":"Great place....food is excellent...decor eclectic and elegant...truly \"hidden\" amongst a neighbourgood of discarded needles and pawnbrokers...parking lot is across the street...so if you are a fast runner...your chances are 50:50 of getting to the restaurant without being mugged...but if you make it...you will be rewarded with a great dinner in a very cool atmosphere."}
{"text":"Service was flawless, as expected. And the overall ambiance was enjoyable. However, none of the dish surprised me, in terms of both presentation and taste.
My friend and I tried the 5-course tasting menu, all ten dishes were different.
The quality of the ingredients was good (foie gras, rib eye...). The taste just lacked a wow factor. I was expecting something that would amaze me, considering the good things I heard about George restaurant. Too bad that didn't happen.
Wasn't worth the price, therefore I won't return."}
{"text":"Had the 7 course tasting menu (anniversary dinner). First tasting menu I've had in Toronto. Food  was great. The plating was pretty cool as well. And the portions were actually bigger than what I expected (especially for the main course). Service was good too. 

The best thing about this place is that we got different plates, even though we each got the 7 course menu. So we got to try 14 dishes total (between 2 people). 

2 complaints:
-We  were there for 3hrs. There is a loooong break between most of the courses. Much too long. During the first 40min, I ended up eating a lot of bread between courses because I was getting hungry (and I rarely eat bread). I wish they could speed things up a little. 
-One of the courses was a cheese course. Basically a slab of cheese, with some sauces. Wasn't impressed with that at all. I mean I could recreate this dish at home. I'm coming here for something a little more creative. 

But apart from the cheese dish, I really enjoyed the meal, and will definitely return."}
{"text":"WOW!!!  went with the 7 course tasting menu with wine pairing. 3 of us got different meals and wines and none of us had a compliant. the food was absolutely amazing. needless to say after all that wine we were a bit tipsy."}
{"text":"Mediocre food and service. Dishes lacked cohesion and portions were TINY. Massively overpriced ($300 for 2 people and we both left hungry). Don't understand the hype around this place at all."}
{"text":"We had the 7 course dinner with wine pairing. The food was absolutely amazing and it took us almost 5 hours, well worth the $200 a person. There was 6 of us and each course had 3 different dishes so they made a total 21 different dishes and had almost just as many wines. Maybe we got VIP treatment because we are friends with the manager?

I'm not going to go in detail about each dish because I don't really remember or didn't even know what it was but it was amazing. I would totally recommend but make sure you budget the time. 

The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was that I wasn't totally able to appreciate all the great food and wine but if you are a foodie or a wine connoisseur, this will be heaven for you."}
{"text":"I had the worst experience at George. My family and I saw the high ratings and wanted to try it out. 
Our food was not seasoned and it took a very long time for our waiter to come back and check on us. 
They are also not kids family!! I do not recommend this restuarant for the quality and price."}
{"text":"It pains me to write this review. I was so looking forward to my meal at George, especially since it was a special occasion dinner to celebrate mine and my twin sister's birthday, as well as to celebrate my recent graduation. Unfortunately, it was a huge letdown.

I booked our table weeks in advance, and clearly noted that it was a birthday dinner and that my sister and I would both be ordering the vegetarian tasting menu. We arrived slightly early for our reservation, but were seated immediately given that the restaurant had yet to fill up. The space is lovely and only contributed to our anticipation of a really stellar meal.

Our \"server\" came over and greeted us shortly after we were seated, and double checked that we would still be ordering the vegetarian tasting menu. His attitude towards us was slightly condescending as he remarked how \"cute\" he thought it was that we were dining together for our birthday. Granted, we were probably the youngest people in the room that evening, but this just made it doubly rude. He came over again after putting in our food order to take our drink orders. I ordered the George Sidecar, and my sister asked innocently for a celebratory \"glass of champagne\". Without confirming our order, he hurried away. Our drinks arrived some time later; he had brought my sister the (much) more pricey champagne available by the glass and myself the double cocktail. Of course, given that we ourselves hadn't specified, we did not complain, but we found it in poor taste for him to make these assumptions without double checking with us. Fortunately, my cocktail was delicious and well crafted.

When the food arrived, we continued to be disappointed. Portions were reasonable, but many of the flavours did not seem to work well together. Perhaps those who aren't vegetarian fare better with the tasting menu here. There was only one dish out of five that I was really pleased with, aside from the cheese course, and my sister fared equally as poorly. Our server did not seem to be genuinely interested in our well-being, and unenthusiastically asked for our names and wished us a happy birthday at the end of our meal. Luckily the company was good and the space lovely, because the food and the service were extremely disappointing."}
{"text":"We had an early reservation for George (6:30). When we arrived we saw the kitchen staff finishing up their pre-dinner service meeting which ended with a \"Chef, yes Chef!\".  From that I knew that the dinner would be great and it was great.

There are about 20 or so staff in the kitchen. 

We opted for the a la carte but next time we will get the 5 or 7 course. 

I ordered the lobster, scallops and the beef. All were great."}
{"text":"The place is hard to book, so make sure book at least a week in advance for your weekends dinner.
Me and my bf  were at sat night few weeks ago. And we were glad that we didn't go with the tasting menu because it took very long time for them to get the food ready.
We order from la cart menu for 3 course and it took us around 2.5 hours to finish the dinner.
I was really hungry by the time I got our first course - we probably waited for at least 20 mins to get the first course.

First course
Lobster : 5/5 lobster was really fresh and tasteful. However it was slightly raw.
Pea Soup: 3/5 it was  just a regular soup and was not impressive

2nd course
Black cod 4/5: black cod was cooked perfectly
Bison Cheek: 3/5 

3rd course 
Sea bass: 4/5 fish was tasteful . However it was cook  exactly the same way as the black cod with lots of butter. Thus, I felt like I had two extract the same dish. Do not order two fish tgt. I wish the waiter could have warned me for that. 

Rib eye with foie gras 3/5 : We requested to add the foie gras to the rib eye. Foie gras was great  however rib eye was a bit overbook and portion is really small. Not as good as the steak from the steakhouse.

In summary, i don't think this meal worthy of over $100 per person. Wait time was too long and ruined my dinner mood. Food was not bad, but was not impressed either. 
I don't think I will go back."}
{"text":"My husband and I recently celebrated Valentine's at George with the 5 course tasting menu and it most certainly did not disappoint. The food was as much a feast for my eyes as it was for my stomach as each dish was like a piece of art. The highlight being the Satan or \"death by chocolate\" desserts we were presented with. As my husband told our waiter, \"I now have a new favourite restaurant in Toronto.\""}
{"text":"This place is good, great atmosphere and ambience but a bit pricy. Their wine selection is top knotch and their dessert is always amazing. Although I never feel completely satiated here, the food is always fresh, tasty and well plated. I live close to here so I'll be back but only for special occasions. The crowd is more mature and you can expect great service."}
{"text":"We came here to celebrate our anniversary. And because I had mentioned it in the comment while booking the reservation, they made sure to give us a super comfy and private booth! It was really nice to enjoy the special treatment and to almost feel like a royal guest at the restaurant. And although we were tucked away, we had just the right amount of attention from their service.  The tasting menu was really tempting, but it was our first time at George and there were just too many things I wanted to try on the menu to let the chef choose my plates for me. But I will most definitely have to go back for the tasting menu next time to try more dishes! I'm guilty to say that my hands almost never left the bread bowl until it was empty. Everything from the bread to the ratatouille amuse bouche were scrumptious. Between the boyfriend and I, we had ordered the wagyu capriccio, scallops, yellow fin tuna, lobster and 2 main courses of vension. I couldn't always tell what I was eating, but every bite was truly memorable. Every dish was presented like a piece of art and the flavours and textures were executed with perfection. It's hard to choose what you must order when everything tastes so incredible. Our only (maybe) critique is that the venison was slightly gamey for our taste, but we still devoured everything, especially the chestnut agnolotti-like thing (yum). Even though we were both immensely full at this point, I couldn't resist ordering the pumpkin pie dessert as the boyfriend shook his head in disapproval at me. I'm sure the plate would've looked perfect even without their happy anniversary blessing on it but who would've know that the white chocolate and pumpkin could be married together so wonderfully. Honestly, the pumpkin pie may be the best pie I've had in my life, and my boyfriend will tell you that I've had many pies in my life. This is definitely one of my favorite restaurants of all times. Thanks George!"}
{"text":"George is a high-end restaurant with excellent service, a generous and inventive menu and superb wine cellar.  It is, in every way, an excellent, high-end restaurant experience. Steak was absolutely the best.  Everything else was also extremely well executed.  A large serving staff is on hand to ensure that needs are catered to with grace and expediency..  So why only 4 stars?  Well, after tasting 10 different dishes, I'm afraid none of them truly surprised & delighted me.  The range of taste sensations was all a tad 'safe' for my liking. 

I highly recommend George for a romantic meal for two or an intimate business dinner.  I will be returning to George if/when I need to take guests out for a high-end meal and I'm apprehensive that my guests may have a conservative pallet."}
{"text":"George was truly an exceptional dining experience. My husband planned a special birthday dinner in the alcove seats which was so romantic! But this isn't a love letter to my husband it's to the fabulous staff and chef that were so accommodating it was unbelievable. My husband has A LOT of dietary restrictions, feeding him is no easy feet. He hasn't been able to experience a tasting menu in about 7 years. When I mentioned this to Enzo, our awesome waiter, he took the time to write down every single restriction and conferred with the chef and they said they would make it happen! They did, what we thought... was the impossible!!! It was such a fantastic dining experience, the food was exquisite and it really made for a memorable birthday neither of us will ever forget! Thank you so much George and Enzo and to the most amazing chef! HIGHLY recommend, you will be well taken care of and eat like royalty!"}
{"text":"First time here was for a special birthday occasion. Amazing service & 5 course menu was exceptional. For the two of us we would get different plates each which equates to 10 plates. Beautiful plating! Overall very satisfied but expect to pay a heavy price tag for this experience!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time for a Business lunch and everything was delicious! I had their salad, salmon dish, and dessert and everything was presented well and the service was great too!  I will definitely be coming back here to check out their dinner and drinks menu."}
{"text":"All around 5 star dining experience. When dining here, I recommend the tasting menu paired with the wine pairings. This is the best way to experience George, since you will try things that you may not usually order. Great upscale dining ambiance, lovely plating, and unique flavours."}
{"text":"Great ambience and superb service but the price not worthy for the 5-course tasting menu."}
{"text":"George is definitely an experience that is unforgettable. 

They have two dining options.  Price fix course menu or you can order a la Carte. We opted to do a la Carte because there were certain items on the menu that we really wanted to try so we decided to do our own customize fixed menu. 

Upon arrival, our server was super friendly. Introduced himself and explained the menu quite throughly.  We ordered their mascoto and was so pleased with it. 

The presentation of the food was impeccable. When we first received our dishes I didn't even want to touch it! Each course came with a clear explanation of what each item was. My favourite was the tuna tartar starter. It was so nicely presented and delicious.  Our mains (steak and Cornish hen) was a mouthful of flavours and was so satisfying. Some may think the portions are not alot but the flavour really trumps the size. 

George also delivered us a special anniversary dessert to end off our meal. Amazing experience, impeccable service and mouth exploding taste! George truly deserves the 5 stars in all fields."}
{"text":"George is a great fine dining restaurant located in the heart of Toronto.

ATMOSPHERE: George is easy to miss from the outside as the entrance is hardly prepossessing, but once inside you're greeted by a warm look and cozy seating arrangement. 

SERVICE: As one would expect from a fine dining restaurant, the service here was quick and friendly. The staff were well versed in all the dishes and features, and all members were Johnny on the spot when it came to things like drink refills or replacing flatware. 

FOOD: Our group opted to get their five-course tasting  (can also get seven or ten courses if really hungry). Each person got something different, and the offerings can change daily based on the chef's creative penchants for that day. All courses were presented excellently and tasted fantastic. Each tasting came with an unofficial 0th course which was a single stuffed Ontario pepper with crispy duck skin.

1st: Trout with lentil salad.
2nd: Duck confit, foie gras, chickpea mash, fried quail egg.
3rd: Rack of lamb done medium rare, Thai curry lentil tart, spicy mint yogurt sauce.
4th: Aged smoked Gouda, apple slices, bread, jam.
5th: Early grey creme brulee, white chocolate, raspberry sauce.

Their drink menu was also unique and contained some original selections. I tried their Harvey After Work and Jose B. Collins and was impressed by both.

VALUE:  Obviously, a fine dining establishment won't be cheap ($115 CAD for the tasting menu), but in exchange for the hefty price tag one expects a much higher caliber of food and service. In this respect George delivered both well. As an occasional treat this place will offer an outstanding experience."}
{"text":"I took my Boyfriend here for his Birthday and it was amazing. The service was great!  We made resveration at 7:30 pm and didn't have to wait to be seated. We got seated in a very nice area, and our waitress was very nice. What I love about the staff is that they are very vigilant. If we went to the washroom they would come and fix our napkins, if we were done eating they would take our plates as soon as we were done, and if we needed water they pour our glasses. Everything was done QUICKLY. The waiter was very polite and each staff was helpful. The decor is so rustic !  It is a mirror on the ceiling were you can see the each chief perp the food. Which I love, because they are very confident in what they are putting out. The food was SO GOOD, even though it was very expensive. We didn't get the tasting menu. For the appetizer I got the Soft Shell Crab and he got the soup (which was a crab soup). My dish was amazing that I could not stop eating. His soup was good but nothing special ( but it was STILL good). I than got the Ricotta Gnocchi and he got the Wagyu Beef Tataki. My dish was very good but nothing special. It was very fulling though. The reason I got the Ricotta Gnocchi because I heard al lot of reviews that the food dishes were small portions, but I think that is only for the tasting menu. He loved his dish which made be so happy. It was his first time having Wagyu and he was so impressed. Every bite he made a comment of how good it was. For our main dishes we got the Halibut and the Wild boar. The halibut was amazing. The fish was cooked PERFECTLY ! Everything on the plate complimented each other. He also loved his dish, that he said it was better than the Wagyu. At first it was a little bit chew, but you had to cut the boar in small portions and eat it with everything on the plate. Since it was his birthday I honestly thought they would give us a complimentary dessert. Some nice restaurant we went to it was like that. At first I never wanted to get a dessert but I requested a dessert that said \" Happy Birthday\" on it, so we got the PannaCotta. The dessert was also amazing. 

All in all we had a good night. It was very expensive I spent 223 before tip. But I enjoyed my night and he love it so it made me happy."}
{"text":"The reviews are true. The is an amazing restaurant. Service is very attentive (our waiter Donald was outstanding). The food is inventive and delicious and very fresh. Wonderful halibut and good wine selection. Definitely will come back."}
{"text":"My girlfriend took me here for my birthday. Very impressed. Service was awesome (kudos to Kimberly,  she was great), and the food was incredible. 

Very interesting flavour profiles in the 5 course tasting menu, and I enjoyed mixing & matching different parts of each plate to try something new. Fantastic wine list as well. Would definitely go again. Chef Lorenzo and his team did not disappoint!"}
{"text":"Good, but not great. The service was exceptional, the food was good...but not great. All of the items were plated well, and served in a timely manner with the appropriate wine. However, there was nothing about the meal that left me with an unforgettable experience. George is definitely a great place, but shortly after you leave it all becomes a distant forgettable memory..."}
{"text":"This place is great for accommodating all dietary restrictions and allergies. I tried the 5 course tasting menu and the server asked us upfront if we had any dietary restrictions and allergies, and managed to accommodate all of us. 

The tasting menu comes with 5 surprise dishes, and everyone at the table receives a different dish. The chef manages to keep the surprises coming! We were impressed by every dish, and if you'd like, the variety in dishes also made it good for sharing."}
{"text":"This was arguably one of the best dining experiences in my life - Incredible food & amazing service. George offers a small a la carte and 3 tasting menus: 5, 7, or 10 courses. They also have an extensive wine selection as well as wine pairings to go with the tasting menus. 

My boyfriend and I opted for the 7 course tasting menu. What was so unique about George's tasting menus was that each of our dishes were different from one another...so in the end we had 14 different dishes! Each was beyond amazing and plated almost too pretty to eat. Our server recommended a pinot noir which paired well with our meal. 

I have had friends complain about the service they received here but I was lucky to have an attentive server and scored what I believe to be the best seat in the house! 

At the end, we were speechless - the meal, the wine, the service and the ambiance were all perfect. We tried to name our favourite dish but were stuck because all were equally delicious. Although I was full after the 7 courses, I will definitely try the 10 course next time..so excited to see what the chef has in store!"}
{"text":"Great food. Innovative menu. Excellent service. Torontonians must give it a try."}
{"text":"My son and I went and did the tasting menu - he would definitely give it 5 stars, I give it 4 stars because I prefer to pick my own dishes (would have preferred to havce a chocolate dessert, though the breadpudding confection was AMAZING).  The food was WONDERFUL, so creative, unique combinations, and they never give both parties the same dish, so it's a great place to share.  Also, nice that they can accommodate vegans, vegetarians, pescetarians, etc.

The service was absolutely perfect - friendly and accommodating, but not fawning nor intrusive.  Lovely ambiance and nicely designed.  The only thing I would say is that they could use a bit more signage outside."}
{"text":"Went here during a company sponsored outing so the menu was fixed. 

The atmosphere was warm and dim. Great place for a romantic dinner. 

What I was most impressed about was the presentation of each dish. Each plate is a work of art. Each dish had its unique taste and you can tell the thought put into each creation. 

Overall the food was very good and I would highly recommend to anyone who wants to try it out."}
{"text":"Went here with my SO for his birthday and tried the 7 course tasting menu. The whole meal lasted around 3.5 hours, which we expected because it was also quite busy that night (we were told the 5 course would be 2-3 hours and the 9 course would be around 4-5 hours!). We received 14 different dishes (two different sets of seven courses), which included a wide variety of dishes that were all beautifully plated. Each of them were presented like a work of art and it was a pleasure to sit there and really take our time enjoying each one. I did find that the take here was less experimental compared to some other popular restaurants with tasting menus (eg. Alo, Richmond Station), which some may prefer. It's a bit on the pricey side, but it's definitely a great place to go for special occasions."}
{"text":"the 5 course is very interesting - most dishes were excellent.  best dish was the foie gras (with bison).  very casual ambiance - i like how you can see the chiefs kitchen area from outside.  i like all of the big chief hats"}
{"text":"Firstly, I cannot believe that I forgot to review this place. This is one of my favorite restaurants for their regular and tasting menu. 

Tasting menu: what a great dining experience that I had. My husband and I often enjoy going to try tasting menus in Toronto. Luckily this restaurant didn't disappoint. 
Not only did you get the option of 5 course taster, 7 courses, but also 10 course tasting menu. You can also do wine pairing as well.
We went with the 7 course and we were so satisfied. We were asked about our allergies or if there were any certain foods that we didn't eat. As usual, the menu is entirely designed by the chef. We were given actually 14 different meals because we each got a different plate. This is usually how the chef did it. Luckily, all the dishes that I was served was my fav but I was able to pick at my husband's meal. The plating was so colorful and full of texture. 
The chef me sure that each plate was like a party in your mouth. Each bite either had some crunch, some sauce, and some excitement. 
It is never a bland mouthful. 

Other menu items: other times that I've been here, I have orders from their regular menu. It I is the same chef style where each plate had lots of different texture to taste. It has good flavors and never overdone meat. It was great for what we ordered. Though, I liked the  surprise from the tasting menu instead of ordering a la carte. Still really good either way!!

Ambiance: decor was nice and I liked how the restaurant is set up with a cozy vibe. 

Service: it had great service. They were very attentive as well. 

Overall amazing!!!! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"People gave a 4 to 5 star rating only because its expensive. expensive makes you feel luxury and great. You can spend 200bucks but not here, and get food with both quality and quantity. The serving was terrible?you have to wait and wait and I even found a grey hair in my dessert! worst thing is they dont even say a sorry!  Was recommended by friends, however this just disappointed me, really."}
{"text":"Superb restaurant all round. Interesting twist on the tasting menu by mixing up different offerings each course for each diner. Special love for our very informative sommelier"}
{"text":"Hands down the best food experience we have ever had! Fantastic service with attention to every detail. The staff were diligent with my food allergies which gave me peace of mind. The tasting menu was so much fun!"}
{"text":"I used to come here often years back but their service / quality of food seems to deteriorate every time I go back. Raised my concern to the general manager and he doesn't seem to all that care - guess that tells you why. Food used to be better but Now it is very mediocre and I can't pick one dish out from what i had that was good. It was disappointing."}
{"text":"One of the best meals I've had in Toronto. This place has been around for 10 years! The food is exquisite and ask for Chris one of their expert sommeliers. I could listen to him for hours about the wines they import and can't be purchased anywhere else. The pairings of our 5 course tasting menu were a symphony of flavours and better than the sum of their parts. Each guest gets a different menu so prepare to switch plates to taste 10 courses for the price of 5. I can not say enough about the impeccable service from Tracy and each of the young apprentices who delivered and spoke articulately and eloquently about each dish. The plate presentation was like the gently rolling lowland plains of France and Spain. We finished with artisanal cheeses and 5 bites of dessert that blew my mind. I dare not mention favourites because everything was incredible. Best experience in Toronto to date."}
{"text":"I have fortunately been able to go to George twice in the past couple of years.
First time with my family, we had the 7 plate tasting menu. All the items were excellent (although i dont remember what we were served - has been 2 years ok?) but the waiter was exceptionally knowledgable and probably makes more than i do as an IT consultant with the tips he received. The second time i took my girlfriend for her birthday, and we ordered from the a la carte menu... the scallops were amazing and so was the other 2 dishes i believe the tenderloin and seared tuna. However there was about a 20-30 minute delay between each of the 4 dishes which kind of put a damper on my stomach expectations, but nevertheless it was worth the wait. Recommend."}
{"text":"Came here for our Anniversary and was extremely pleased! The service was exceptional and the food was superb! The venue itself has a very romantic feel and makes you feel like you are away from home. Had the 5 course chef choice and was delighted with every course that came out. I highly recommend getting it and pairing it with wine at every course. Our server was Robert H if you get him consider yourselves in luck. Enjoy! P.S. Do give yourselves time for this restaurant - at least 2.5-3 hours for the five course meal."}
{"text":"I went here for my birthday dinner last night and, with the rest of my table, embarked on the 10 course tasting menu. It was a delightful journey that lasted over four hours. 

To start, the wine pairings were fantastic. There were some unusual choices that all ultimately paired spectacularly with the food. 

Second, the service was exquisite. Attentive, but not in an overbearing way, and everybody was friendly. 

The food, which was the star of the show, was all really good. Some of the dishes, like the tilefish tartar and rack of lamb were amazing, with a depth of layered flavours and complexity. Other dishes, like the bison cheek, had a simpler flavour profile, but were still delicious. 

Perhaps most impressive was how well proportioned the tasting menu was. I didn't feel either over-stuffed or intoxicated after the meal. I walked out feeling pleasantly full. 

The food here is, in my opinion, on par with a Michelin star rated restaurant."}
{"text":"Amazing place! Went to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday and we're not disappointed. Great place for a special occasion. We were very pleased with a sampling menu as all of our courses were different and really tasty. Service was great as well."}
{"text":"I once again my boss taking a group of us to George. Some of the group didn't experience the magic last year so he decided to repeat again as it received high praises last year. The challenge for this year was to enjoy a 10 course meal possibly with wine tasting.

When we arrived, they checked our coats in and swiftly showed us to our table. Like last year, our group was given the section under the gazebo. On the website, I wasn't sure whether they offered wine pairing for a 10 course but now I know they do. 

My colleague and I had been talking about them offering wine pairing for some of the courses. However, it took us a while to decide whether to accept the challenge of 10 pairings and that convinced others to join the journey.

The meal had around 3 seafood dishes, 4 meat dishes, a cheese dish and rounded out with 2 dessert plates. The dinner started at 630 pm and I didn't get home until past midnight. The memorable dishes were the poached lobster, rabbit and earl grey creme brule.  The braised pork was not the best out of all the dishes.

Definitely, the food is amazing and the experience is out of this world. The somelier was great explaining the wines and the reasons for the pairing. For the group, it seemed like they served two options unlike last year when they served 3 different meals."}
{"text":"Its pretty darn nice here...

This would be one of my first fine-dining experiences in Toronto. I've been to some upper scale restaurants at this point, but George is on a different level. Its the type of place with nice chairs, people in suits, and smaller but amazingly flavoured dishes.

I went here curtesy of my very nice boss's who wanted to take us out for a holiday lunch. I was greeted with coat service at the door and quickly seated. The place was about half-full, with nicely dressed people that looked like they too were work-lunching (yes, I just made up that term).

The chairs are soft violet colour. There are comfy booths and elegantly dressed tables set-up. We also had a nice birds-eye view of the kitchen. There are so many people working away to make our food!

Our waiter was very nice and honest in her description of the foods. I.e., we asked her about serving portions and she was upfront about it. We decided with the tasting menu-for $50 that is appetizer, main and dessert. The trick is you do not know what you are getting!

We started with a small dish of a little cheese, cracker, anchovy and other flavours. It was delish...we then wondered is that our appetizer, it was so small! Or was it an amuse bouche?

Our next course was delicious sashimi with a creamy chunk of something yummy below it. You know, I cannot describe this food well to do it justice. Its better to say, its gourmet and delicious. The serving was a little on the small side and we were very confused if that was our main. One of my bosses joked we would need to  grab a burger afterwards! We were very happy to discover that our 2nd dish had yet to arrive-yay more food on the way!

Our next dish was steak with amazingly flavoured greens in caramelized onion, on a bed of velvety mashed potato. So delicious and good serving size. I was full afterwards.

But we still had dessert on the way! It was a creamy pumpkin cheesecake with a large drop of meringue (soft not crunchy) on top. What a great way to end off a flawless meal with outstanding flavours. Well done George! 

This is a place for a nice meal for a special occasion. I had a great experience and would love to return."}
{"text":"Impeccable food 5/5 stars - last night my partner surprised me for my bday by bringing me to try their 10-course (there's also a 7 course option) tasting menu. The type of cuisine is probably best described as contemporary, with Mediterranean and other global influences. Upon booking you can specify dietary restrictions, so for instance we had the tasting menus to be tailored to be lacto-vegetarian and vegan. We've been to Alo for the tasting menu and one of the main differences is that the portion sizes are noticeably larger here, so you will leave somewhat satiated versus not at all, especially since at George they start you off with a full bread basket (+ refills) and grain courses. The dishes here are also much prettier than at Alo, IMO. Especially the veggie heavy courses -- the plating is truly art! Downside is that we never received a menu to keep, so can't remember all the intricate ingredients they used, which included some I've never heard of before like \"lime snow\". The vegan melon sorbet was unreal... Glutinous rice consistency, super refreshing, not overly sweet. As a vegan just note that your dishes will be predominantly vegetables and your desserts will be fresh fruit, with the exception of vegan cake and sorbets, i.e. you might leave hungry (consult the bread basket).

Romantic space with a gorgeous terrace with a \" waterfall\". Great for dates.

Partner paid, so not sure of the total, but heard that it is more expensive than Alo's $100 tasting menu.

K, so why 3/5 stars overall? In short, I was very not happy with the service at one point. Don't get me wrong, the staff was extremely sweet, polite, but not necessarily the most professional. They mixed up my vegan courses with my partner's vegetarian (which contained dairy, which I have food allergies to) for 4/10 courses until I pointed out the fact that my dishes had hints of yogurt and butter-y taste. Whoops. Luckily I'm not totally crazy, so didn't make a scene, but seriously speaking on behalf of people with more serious food allergies or vegan values, what happened was NOT okay! Most disappointingly, 2 courses after I pointed out the mix up they did it again -- mixed up our dishes (blobs of ricotta). Not okay. At this point that's just being careless and disrespectful towards people's values. Some of our servers also struggled with presenting our dishes (understandable in an ordinary context, but at a high end place you would expect a bit more, no?), unable to recall what sauces contained \"some brown gel... Can't remember what it is...\" Not super professional. Service here compared to Alo was definitely a step down."}
{"text":"What a great dinner!  Sevice and food were both great.   Had the 5 course tasting with wine pairing.  Pictures say all."}
{"text":"(10 course tasting menu) Food: 3.5 stars, Ambiance: 5 stars, Service: 5 stars.

I had mixed feelings about how to rate George because I so desperately wanted to love this place after seeing such raving reviews and from previous positive tasting menu experiences from other restaurants. I was expecting a terrific dinner experience which was exactly how it started off to be. 

I came here for an anniversary dinner and I'd have to say the restaurant is absolutely gorgeous and has such a chic romantic aura. They were extremely accommodating when I had to change the reservation time and change the seating from patio to inside the restaurant. We got seated in a lovely booth at the back of the restaurant which was so cosy.

Food: You have the choice of trying the tasting menus (5, 7, 10 courses) or a la cart. But of course you have to go for the tasting so we opted for the full 10 course ($150pp). We were warned that it would take approximately 4 hours but we weren't deterred because we wanted the full fledged experience and it actually only turned out to be around 3 hours in total (bonus!). Each course between the 2 of us was different so we basically got to try 20 different dishes which sounded pretty awesome right?

The problem and why 3.5 stars for food? Two reasons: 
1) I did not feel the 'omg this is SO FREAKEN GOOD' exclamation mark that I expect to feel for a tasting menu at this price point. I'd have to say that each dish was so intricately prepared and beautifully presented but to talk purely on taste it lack a certain 'wow' factor. Don't get me wrong - there were certainly dishes that we loved  and thoroughly enjoyed (such as the foie gras, crab cake, and lamb) but that brings me to my second point.. 

2) I felt like they could incorporate more hot food in their courses and a larger portion for their main course. Very few courses had the steamy, just off the stove heat to it and of the few, they were somewhat lukewarm. Not a single soup or pasta or risotto (only asking for a small portion of hearty carbs here) in 20 different varieties? A bit surprised. I think they can definitely think about improving on increasing variety on the menu rather than just a variation of vegetables and meats for all the courses. Also, they had a really tasty main course of lamb and steak but they can increase the portions a bit. I would not consider myself as someone that could eat a lot but I was not completely full until after dessert and I expect to get the satisfied and full feeling BEFORE we get to dessert. 

All in all, still 4 stars for George because they really had impeccable service and a gorgeous restaurant. I would recommend this place for special occasions as it was a really pleasurable experience but from the food perspective, I personally found some areas for improvement."}
{"text":"Outstanding meal and service and especially wine pairings from Jay! We enjoyed an exquisite birthday meal tonight in the just opened patio."}
{"text":"I was here NYE and definitely will say they couldn't handle the amount of people coming in...  Luckily we came early or I'd be sour as sh*t waiting 20-30 mins pass your reservation. I did see the manager offer those waiting a glass of champagne *thumbs up*. Next year limit the amount of reso, don't be greedy.

Anyhoo I probably won't come back cause the food and service was just OK."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why my experience differed from everyone else's, but I really thought George was alright.

Food - I really like the way the brought us some starters. However, to be quite honest, the food I had was mediocre. I ordered one of their vegetarian options (I don't remember what it's called exactly) and when I tasted it, I got what I'd get at home. I think I'm being too harsh here, but I really thought they didn't put as much effort on my food as they did the others'/my friends'. I still liked it nonetheless.

Ambiance - I think this is what stood out to me the most. We were seated outside, in the patio, so it was nice. I requested to sit beside the waters, but unfortunately we didn't get it. I'd sit in the patio again if I had the choice, though.

Service - I don't know why the server was so sassy to me. He was super nice to my friend, though, so I'm confused. Lol. Also, just a tip: next time, please please please don't rush me to order! I do not like it when servers rush me to order and point out the fact that I'm taking pictures. Lol. I'm a foodie, after all. Otherwise, everyone was very polite and attentive."}
{"text":"A unique and unforgettable experience that is perfect for a special occasion. We came here during a long weekend Toronto trip to celebrate our five year anniversary. 

Highly recommend reservations. The place was slammed the entire time we ate. Also plan on about 90 minutes for the whole dining experience. 

We each got the five-course dinner and it was more than enough food. We also had a couple of bonus small plates sent out compliments of the chef. The bread basket is exquisite and so are each of the courses. It's a very foodie experience and absolutely worth trying. It's also a great introduction to molecular gastronomy. 

We'd love to go again. Definitely bring the big $$$ with you. You'll need it!"}
{"text":"Great experience. Ordered 3 courses a la carte and it was still too much, so I don't know if I could do a full tasting.

I wouldn't call it avant-garde, but definitely creative, interesting, and flavorful."}
{"text":"We had a 7 courses tasting menu. All 14 courses are different. Great presentation, great taste and amazing service. But only few dishes are a little bit salty. Overall, we love the experience every time we are here."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, the food is like nothing I have ever tasted before. They are definitely the top restaurant in Toronto! It's very pricy, be prepared to spend about $500, but absolutely worth it! Watch out with the wine parings, it's a lot of wine and more than I can handle. I did the five course tasting and couldn't even finish it, i don't know how you could do the 7 or the 10! So much food, and really amazing. This chef is creative, the presentation is amazing, the service is top notch, and the food is, there really is no word except perfection. MUST TRY!"}
{"text":"What an awesome experience! This was such a treat and is quite worthy of its high reviews. If you're a foodie then you must try this place. My boyfriend treated me for my birthday lunch and we enjoyed every minute.

For lunch, they offer a 3 course or 4 course menu, or a la carte. We chose the 3 course because we wanted to be surprised by what was served, plus they do a double-sized tasting menu so for each course, we both got different dishes - so double the tasting really.

I'm sure they change their tasting daily but to give an overview of what we had: duck breast and smoked trout as the 1st course starters. 2nd course was the main meal: i got lamb and he got beef tenderloin - so good, we both agreed best meat we've ever had! And the last course was dessert, one dish was a strawberry shortcake type with preserved strawberries and whipping cream while the 2nd dish was a butter tart with cherries and blueberries. Each plate was carefully thought out and the tastes were on point. Cant wait to come here just for a la carte - they have gnocci and a burger which caught my eye. 

Service was great, they explained everything that was on the plate and it was very attentive. Only thing I wouldve enjoyed with the bread that was served for the table was some upscale butter of some sort - the bread came salted and it was good but needed something."}
{"text":"George's sits in the same building as a very European inspired boutique hotel called The Ivy at Verity, a restored 1850's chocolate factory. 

Executive Chef Lorenzo Loseto took us on a culinary adventure during our Seven course tasting ($135 per person). Chef's Choice tastings are double-sided which was fun because I was able to taste two different dishes every course. You can only imagine how full I was at the end! 

The menu was completely custom to us and I was too involved with the experience that I did not write the name of the dishes down. However, I will say that every dish we experienced was cooked to perfection and beautiful plated.

I hope my gorgeous photos can justify my lack of words for this exceptional meal."}
{"text":"One of the most overrated restaurants in Toronto. The food was underwhelming, while the waiter made you feel unspecial -- even on your birthday. Pricey and nothing extraordinary. Would not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"My cousin had his wedding lunch reception here after his wedding at City Hall (just down the street) and he couldn't have picked a better venue.  The space is gorgeous and intimate.  Upon arrival, we were ushered into the back patio, which despite the shadow and trees was actually hotter than it was in the street (because of the lack of air flow).  Nonetheless, the lemonade cocktails that were being served were quite refreshing and soon made us forget the heat.

We were served some scrumptious hors d'uvre, and before we knew it, we found ourselves being ushered back into the air conditioned confines of the restaurant.  The seating was well organized and the service was okay considering the size of the party being served.  My meal was quite satisfying, with the highlight being the main course of cornish hen.

The experience was enough to whet my appetite for George, which appears to be one of the city's hidden gems.  I would definitely consider going back there to sample the restaurant's other culinary offerings."}
{"text":"We had been wanting to try George for a while and went for the seven course tasting menu paired with wine this week. The food was delicious and all of the wines were as well, but the service was not perfect. We especially loved that the chef created different plates for each of us so we could share everything.
The space is beautiful with nice lighting, comfortable seating and it's not too loud. 
We had to wait for wine to be poured on two of the seven courses, and when you are getting the wine pairing, it seems a waste to eat the food without the wine; They mixed up our dessert plates (the happy birthday plate was given to the wrong person); The chair had stains on it which the hostess definitely saw as she pulled out my chair and saw me hesitate to sit but said nothing; And the first few courses were really rushed out, followed by a lot of waiting for the last courses. 
We really enjoyed ourselves but it wasn't the perfect dinner that we were hoping for."}
{"text":"Been here 3 times now, and the quality of the dishes is consistently excellent. I usually go for the 5 course tasting menu. Service is very good too. 

During the latest visit I had the Valentine's Day menu. I was hoping to order the tasting menu but the Valentine's Day menu was the only thing they had at the time, and it was slightly pricier. I wish I had known about it before I got there - their website didn't mention anything about it. They do ask you about any allergies or dietary restrictions. I was a little surprised by the first course - it was supposed to be shared between me and my date. What really wowed me was the Cornish hen and the bison. Flavourful, wonderful texture, and juicy. The dessert was also a shared dish and it was good. I wasn't sure about some of the combinations (e.g. Black sesame ice cream with mango flavoured something next to it) but hey, dessert is dessert and if it satisfies my sweet tooth, it's good."}
{"text":"I stopped by George Restaurant during my recent stay in Toronto in February due to its outstanding reputation and online reviews. When I arrived I had the pleasure of being seated by the cooking area allowing me to inspect the kitchen and see how the cooking staff functioned together. At my 8:30 PM reservation on a Wednesday, George was still packed, but the amount of tables requiring service was slowly going down.

Within about 15 minutes, I immediately noted that the kitchen seemed overstaffed and idle. At the time there were about 20 people in the kitchen and while that is impressive due to the sheer numbers, the number actually contributing to food service was far fewer with some simply watching one person do a job while others conversed with each other idly. I have seen Michelin 3-starred restaurants with much less staff function a lot more efficiently than this kitchen. Hopefully, it is different on the weekends. Surprisingly, this also resulted in a very slow pacing of dishes. In my case, I ordered the ten course tasting menu and it took a bit over 3.5 hours, which is a bit on the long end, but I was informed by a waitress (whether she was correct or not) that ten courses typically takes 5 hours. Of course, depending on the sizing of the course and the speed of the diner, the pace can be faster and slower per course, but in the case of George there would be be random 20-30 minute intervals between some of the larger courses while others came out immediately after finishing the previous one. For such a restaurant, I would expect that food preparation would be more fluid allowing for fluidity in a course menu.

However, inefficiency can easily be made up by good food, but in my opinion there wasn't much wow factor in the courses at George overall. The ingredients were fresh and high quality, but very few dishes impressed in terms of culinary creativity lacking the memorable factor that should be had at restaurants at this tier. Some dishes I had was simply a miss.

On top of that the sparkling water that I had ordered became flat by my second glass mostly because of the lack of attentiveness within my server to notice that the bottle of sparkling she was pouring out of was devoid of bubbles, which in many cases summed up my experience at George. Small details are the differences between unique culinary masterpieces and high quality good. Perhaps the laziness towards detail or lack of being adventurous with courses was the difference maker."}
{"text":"Incredible. Was here with a closed group dinner. Amazing service. Amazingly well prepared and executed meal."}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me to George for our anniversary dinner and it was an amazing experience. They had fancy decor and the service was excellent. We ordered the 7 course tasting menu. For every one of the 7 dishes, different waiters brought the food out for us and all of them were very courteous.
Our main waiter was also very attentive.

What I loved about the food was that each item placed on the plate had a different flavour to it - even the garnish (down to a tiny block of carrot!). Each item had a different taste and the plating was also very pretty. Very impressed! :) 

DRINKS:
Champagne Taittinger

Dishes that stood out for me (all 5/5 stars) were:

AMUSE-BOUCHES
Eggplants with lentils and crispy duck skin
Bruschetta - Salmon & Asparagus

SEABASS with PISTACHIO & PEAS
The seabass was served as sashimi - delicious :D

STUFF TUNA TATAKI with ORGANIC VEGGIES
We had a hard time deciding whether the seabass or the tuna carpaccio was better.. Couldn't decide because both were amazing.

MARINATED OCTOPUS with VEGGIES
We were comparing this dish to the Spanish tapas bars we went to in Toronto, George beats them by far! :D

POTATO WRAPPED TUNA
The potato tasted like meat!

RABBIT MEAT with QUAIL EGG & FOIE GRAS
Very cute display - put together like a mini slider. I LOVED the foie gras :) 
The chef gave us an extra foie gras as a special treat! (Thank you :D!)

RIB EYE with COUSCOUS
The meat was so tender - marinated very well!

CARAMEL CUSTARD with BANANA TEMPURA
The banana tempura was SO DELICIOUS! Wish they added more of this..

\"Happy Anniversary\" was written on both our dessert plates - a cute touch!"}
{"text":"For my 100th Yelp review, I'm reviewing George restaurant!

We went here for Valentine's Day. My co-worker Maurits recommended this place to me after having a great experience here for their third year anniversary. 

The booking process was fairly easy, my date booked online and they called him the next day to confirm. The lady who answered the phone was rude and very short with her responses.

This gem of a fine dining restaurant is located on Queen east and Church. The decor was very modern and romantic. The lights were kept dim. When entering, they took our coats and the waiter sat us immediately. I asked for the wifi password and they let me know promptly.

The food was good, but I would not say it was spectacular. Our server was very considerate of my date's dietary restrictions and had the chef make exceptions to the set menu. 

We got their special tasting menu, it was $150 per person. My favourite dish was lobster made 3 ways. It was a delicious combination of the sweetness of fruits and savoury seafood. The food was filling, the portions were decent for fine dining.

It was a good experience overall and would consider going again to celebrate special events.

Tip: Fancy date spot! Dress up :)"}
{"text":"Splurging for my lovely girlfriend, I wanted a special dinner to commemorate St. Valentine's Day.  I realize that this day is most often celebrated at a fancy restaurant- and that service & food quality usually suffer in the name of turning a table.  

I was slightly concerned when they asked for a credit card when they took my booking over the phone. 

But after being there, George shattered my expectations.  

Our server Robert was patient and guided us through the 5 course sampling menu with care and attention.   The meal was exemplary! Each course was a delight to savour.  

My girlfriend and I stayed after our meal was over and  actually had to ask for the bill.  Even then, Robert let us know we had all the time we wanted !   

Yes, we were not able to have the meal on Feb 14th (my fault for not booking early enough) but we certainly had a very memorable dinner.  I recommend George and look forward to going back again."}
{"text":"I went to George on Feb.1st, 2018 for anniversary dinner.  
We were just disappointed in their service.  
First, a female receptionist who wears glasses took our coats, hung them on a lower peg and stood on lower part of our coats with her dirty shoes.  Said, \" you are standing on our coats.\"  She replied aggressively that she knew it and took them to a coats' room later.  No apology...   We immediately started thinking that we should have gone to another restaurant.  After this incident, there were more happenings.  Secondly, as soon as we sat at a table, a waiter spilled water on all over a table.  He did not even try to change a table cloth.  We asked to change it, and he told us to move to another table.  Each of us moved with holding a glass of water.  A few minuets later, the waiter told us to move back to the table.  Thirdly, when a waiter tried to take away our plates in a rough way, he spattered sauce from our plates on our clothes.  Fourthly, a waiter never asked how food is during our 10-course-dinner.  Lastly, they brought scallop to one of us who has allergy to shellfish(scallop), though we said he has allergy to shellfish to a waiter.  Probably, a chef did not know scallop is shellfish.   The best part of their service, when we could note eat smelly chicken and venison, they offered to exchange with another food.   This is the only service which was good.   Waiters are not well-trained.  They are expensive restaurant, but people must not expect upscale services.  One of the worst services that we experienced at  restaurants.  
As the other thing, food.....   All food look beautiful and fancy.  Too many different tastes on a small portion of food may be interesting fusion, but they were not harmonized well.  Too busy tastes.  One of 10 courses may be enough to have their busy taste meal.   Preparation for food might be bad at this restaurant.  All meat were so smelly.  Foie Gras that we love was so smelly and disturbing in our mouth as well.  If chef prepares for food conscientiously, those things must have not been happened.   We love to have a cup of coffee after dinner, but we did not spend even a penny after 10-course-dinner at this restaurant.  
No way to go back to this place again."}
{"text":"I took my boyfriend here for his birthday. We ordered the 10-course tasting menu. What is unique about George is that we didn't get the same dishes so we essentially got 20 dishes to try between the two of us. It was cool because my bf and I would eat half of our food and then trade. No other tasting menu that we tried had this. The dishes were wonderfully plated, but some were a hit (I.e. the foie gras, veal and tenderloin and scallop Ceviche) and others were a miss (I.e. some dishes had the same ingredients and tasted similar to one another. We didn't get the menu so I don't remember the names of the dishes). 

The service was excellent, our waiter was funny and kept me posted on when my bf would get his bday surprise, which was nice. He also listened to our dietary needs and was attuned to what we needed. For ex: he offered us more bread while we were waiting for our dishes.

The first criticism I had was some of the dishes took longer to come than others. We were pretty hungry when we got there so having little dishes with long waits made us extra hungry. I filled up on bread, which was a mistake because once the main came, we were stuffed. So I would advise people to take their time because you will certainly get enough food and won't walk away hungry. The second criticism was that The dinner took over 4 hours. We didn't realize it would be that long so it would have been nice if we were informed of this at the start of the dinner or if they posted this info on the website so we could adjust our schedules accordingly. 


Overall, We had a great dining experience. I give George an A :)"}
{"text":"So truth be told, I didn't pay for this experience as it was a treat, but I totally enjoyed myself. We started off with a few cocktails and then my girlfriend and I ordered the 10 course tasting menu and decided on adding the wine pairing option. Now the server was pretty up front with us. He was like I know it sounds cool to have 10 courses and then add 10 wines as well, but please understand that's a lot of food with a decent amount of wine and we don't want waste and we don't want to over serve you. I know it sounds simple and common sense but I really appreciated this. We took the warning and accepted our fate. We were at the chef's mercy. Little did I know that the tasting menu is unique to each member of the table. So each course was different between my girlfriend and I, as were our pairings. So we even shared in the end to experience essentially 20 half courses.

Service was superb, the server, the sommeliers and bar staff were very polite. Food was paced as we were eating and we never felt rushed. We started out light with some small pates and gradually worked our way up to light fish tataki. Then we started with courses showcasing foie gras with pork belly, then duck. Each plate had sauce and veggie pairings that were very complimentary. The wines were great as well. The varieties ranged from different regions in Austria, Portugal, France, Germany, and even local Ontario.

It was very difficult to hold it together during this meal as the building of each course also seemed to build the alcohol of the wine. Finally, I remember 3 dessert courses with 3 dessert wines. Also when I say 3 I really mean 6 because we shared much more unevenly at that point too (more moving to me that is). I thoroughly enjoyed myself and would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I've dined at George Restaurant twice now. Once in June 2013 for Father's Day and more recently May 2014 for my boyfriend's birthday celebration.  Both times I've had the 5-course tasting menu. For those who have never been here before, they serve 2 different menus for it, so if you dine with 2 people in your party, each person gets their own unique 5-course meal... If you're sharing and tasting each other's dishes, that's 9-10 dishes total (depends if you both get cheese plate or substitute fruit plate) PLUS amuse bouche! For parties larger than 2 people, they just repeat the 2 set menu options. 

OVERALL: I felt the tasting menu had a lot of value in it considering the portion sizes are larger than what you'd expect from a tasting menu.

FOOD: Both visits, the amuse bouche, seafood appetizer, and foie gras plates were amazing... Particular the foie gras! We had one with pork belly and one with squab. Both deliciously mouth-watering... and I should say that eating foie gras always scares me, but not at George!

The main meat dish is just so-so though, nothing special and could use some improvement. The 4th dish is a cheese plate that only has 1 slab of cheese on it. If you don't like that particular cheese, then you're screwed haha... we're not big on cheese, so we felt ours was a bit too strong for our taste... I opted for a plate of fruit instead.

The final dessert dish is good, but I think it could be improved as well.

SERVICE: The first time I dined here a year ago, it was just average.  But the recent visit in May was phenomenal! Our waiter and other servers were extremely attentive. We dropped a fork by accident and a server from across the room came rushing to replace it. When my boyfriend left to use the restroom, the server immediately folded up his napkin. Since it was a birthday celebration, they wrote a \"Happy Birthday\" note on our dessert with a candle and gave us a complimentary glass of Brachetto D'Acqui (sweet, fruity dessert wine), which we loved and now buy at the LCBO. Mind you, we're not wine connoisseurs, but we appreciated the gesture.

All in all, a great dining experience with a high-value tasting menu. The missing star would be for the main meat course and dessert.  Would still recommend this place to others."}
{"text":"Need some where to impress your in-laws or clients ? Amazing food, great wine pairings, and private intimate rooms.  There is a private club upstairs in the space too,  that has a hotel rooms,  and conference rooms.  Wonderful space for lectures and seminars. Make sure you check out this beautiful restaurant for your next event."}
{"text":"The good: Impeccable service, one of the best I have ever had. Get to the food part in a bit. My partner reserved this restaurant to celebrate my birthday, however, she did not mention to the restaurant it was my birthday. Throughout the dinner we did not use the word 'birthday', but I guess the vibe of the conversation between my partner and I implicated we were celebrating that occasion. By the time of the dessert course, our waiter surprised us with an extra course of dessert to celebrate the birthday occasion. Both my partner and I were more than surprised and definitely appreciative of this initiative our waiter took. That aside, our waiter took the time to go through the courses, made sure the table was clean, and ensured that we were comfortable at all times. I haven't even gotten to the food yet! We both had the seven course menu (from what we gathered, the seven course menu was the most 'worth' it in terms of both pricing and satisfying your hunger). The best of the seven course menu is that both my partner and I had different dishes throughout the course (that means 14 different dishes! ... 16 if you include the birthday surprise). Out of all the dishes, the lamb was superb (most memorable). Don't get me wrong, everything else was good, but the lamb was just one of the best I have ever had. 

The bad: Nothing bad to say here! Well... maybe if we had a larger stomach to try the ten course meal...

The ugly: Nothing ugly here as well!

Suggestions: Reserve, this place gets packed even on weekdays. Go for the seven course if you are undecided. Definitely reserve for occasions :) Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Visited George recently for a cousin's milestone birthday celebration. We all had the 7 course tasting menu with a few of us opting for the vegetarian option. Another of the attendees summed it up perfectly when comparing it to living through an episode of 'top chef'. Where you could actually taste a variety of flavours never knowing what to expect.

The atmosphere is very upper class and would be ideal as a place to celebrate a special occasion. The interior decor is beautiful!

Prior to bringing out the first dish they make a point of checking for allergies and would ensure all dishes did not include those foods. However, for those with anaphylactic allergies, it's only your plate they accommodate so your neighbours may very well have that item.

The food itself was delicious, the chefs work hard to find unusual combinations that complement one another and everything is made on site. A few items like their pumpkin cracker (?) or chocolate straw is delicious and has you craving more. 

Tasting 1-4 leave you wanting more but after the main taste (5) we were starting to get full. Taste 6 and 7 are lighter, the cheese taste and dessert but still delicious. Servers/chefs are fantastic about explaining every tasting plate and will answer questions indicating their knowledge of the dishes. When asked how certain allergies had been accommodated, they were able to tell us if an item had been left out or substituted.

Our only criticism was that there was a long wait between courses 1-2-3-4-5, leaving you in anticipation but also hungry. This is not the place to come if you are in a rush (which we weren't).

This place is an experience and we all had a great time. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Visited George for the first time a while ago but am only now getting around to write the review that they very much deserved.

We had the tasting menu which was fantastic and I would highly recommend! They respected my date's dietary restrictions without compromising the quality of the meal.

I'll admit, things started off a bit slow as the first two dishes were good but not outstanding. Luckily, the creativity and flavours of the dishes continued to build and they finished off strong with a great dessert.

The service was amazing, our waiter was the perfect balance of attentiveness without being overbearing. He was absent whenever we were engrossed in our meals, but through some metaphysical process I don't quite understand, whenever we had a notion of wanting something he would somehow read our minds and magically appear.
He was, in a word, perfect.

My date was lactose sensitive (not intolerant) and was given a dessert that contained ice cream. She was going to eat it anyways rather than make a fuss about it but our waiter immediately noticed it (while servicing another table from a far!) and swooped in to correct it. We ended up getting to keep it (win for me!) while she got her non-dairy one.

The cheese, nuts, and honey from their own bee co-op was the perfect finisher.

I would highly recommend the tasting menu - just make sure to book off a few hours to fully appreciate it. I think it took us ~3hrs to get through it."}
{"text":"Went to George with friends for a birthday celebration after hearing and reading rave reviews. Here are some key points based on my experience.

1. The food is very good, but not sensational overall. The waygu beef was wonderful, the Asian \"inspired\" dishes were a tad bland, the tuna was over-cooked, and the lamb was delicious.
2. George serves undersized entrees starting at $21 and ranging up to $33. Some seemed more like tapas. The menu suggests three courses, but also offers five course $99, seven course $125, and ten course $140 tasting options if everyone at the table agrees to participate. 
3. My service experience was poor. It took four hours for four people to be served three courses. We sat with empty plates in front of us for over 20 minutes at one point. The server seldom checked on us or offered us more drinks, water, etc. Like many other patrons, we were enjoying our wine and conversation, but still wanted service.
4. The outdoor patio was nice, though some lighting was not functioning. The indoor space seemed nice as well.
5. Overall, George offers good food, but at over $100 a person, it should be. The service should also be top notch. It isn't. Three and a half stars."}
{"text":"Tried the 10 course tasting menu with the wine pairing. It was amazing. Too much food for a petite girl but the service and beyond what I expected. The staff were accomadationg and attentive.

For what we paid ( $600 with tip ) for 2 it was well worth it."}
{"text":"We went to George for a family celebration. We ordered a la cart items (the tasting menus were tempting) and it was absolutely wonderful. My favorite was the Wagyu Beef with carrot salad served 4 ways. After the meal I was excited about the banana cream dessert but was sad to hear that they had run out. Later when they were bringing coffee out for everyone our very pleasant waiter informed me that because I was celebrating a special occasion that the chef had whipped together a banana cream dessert just for me. All in all a great night."}
{"text":"I'd have to say this place is in my top 5 tasting menus and wine pairing. The value to quality is second to none. took into account all dietary restrictions with no questions asked. flawless service. Overall I'd say Brilliant."}
{"text":"Was pleasantly surprised. Food is absolutely delicious and interior is simple but interesting. Great place for a date. There is something about this restaurant that makes it stand out."}
{"text":"I came here for a weeknight dinner and had the 7-course tasting menu. 

Pros: 
- Gorgeous back patio with a water fountain, and nice garden/lighting
- Interesting food, beautifully presented, a surprise each time
- Charming waiter, was very courteous and the service I'd expect at such a fancy place
- They served my dessert with a custom message, which was a nice touch

Cons:
- Some dishes were hit-and-miss in terms of flavor. Not all of the fancy sauces/dressing were necessary...I think some were more to look pretty than really adds to the flavor
- I was walking to the washroom (a bit out of the way) and passed by some giant tables with rows and rows of identical, pre-prepared dishes. Took away a bit of the magic.

Overall, really fancy place with a good vibe. It's a fun experience, and the multi-course tasting menu takes a while to eat. Some dishes are a bit experimental, so not everything met my expectations on taste (given the price point)."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are total foodies - we're by no means rich but we like to splurge a few times a year and do fine dining and try tasting menus. To this day, George has still been the best restaurant we've ever been to. 

The atmosphere is very romantic and intimate. We did the full 10 course meal with wine pairing. Our sommelier was absolutely amazing and really should be credited for our entire experience. (I wish I got his name but he had a slight accent and glasses and was very friendly!) The great thing about George is that although my boyfriend and I both ordered the 10 course tasting - we each got 10 different plates of food and wine to pair. That means we shared 20 different courses and shamefully, that much wine as well. After 4 hour hours, we left feeling quite full (and a little buzzed!) Service was actually quite fast and excellent (so don't let the 4 hour part scare you!)

It's an experience we have not stopped talking about and can't wait to go back (especially after trying some other tasting menus at other high end places that didn't even compare in quality and were more expensive!) It cost us $700 after tax and tip but to us, it compared to going on a vacation, very memorable and highly recommend!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend surprised me by bringing me here for my birthday dinner. This restaurant has always been on my to-eat list and its one of the well known tasting-menu restaurants in the six.

For tasting menu they offers the option for 5/7/10 courses and if you're not a fan of chef blind tasting they do also have a la carte menu.

We settled for the 10 courses and they warned my bf this would be a 3-4 hrs dinner and no kidding it did took that long. Our dinner reservation were at 630 and we got out the restaurant briefly after 1030. 

Ambiance - The restaurant itself feels very welcoming and we got seated in the comfy booth at the back of the restaurant (good job to the bf for special requesting it). 

Food -  most memorable dishes are: tuna wrapped in potato (it was delicious and cooked to perfection, crispy on the outside and soft in the inside. We were told this was a dish the chef won an award for it last year); poached lobster (the flavour was well-balanced while you can still taste the tenderness and freshness in the meat).  oh and of course the earl grey creme brulee, its probably one of the best creme brulee i ever had !! 

Service - 10/10.  Every dish was well described to us.  wine and water were filled frequently.  the servers were all really friendly!
 
A side note: I had read couple other reviews saying there was a lack of hot food served. But this was not the case for us that night. We had several hot plates served."}
{"text":"This is a bit of an unconventional review, since I came to George for an intimate wedding, but I thought I'd put it out there that this was one of the best affordable upscale restaurants in Toronto, on top of the fact that it is a fantastic wedding venue. 

There's a gorgeous courtyard in the back where our friends \"walked down the aisle\". On a hot summer day, it is shaded and perfect for cocktails and mingling about, though a warning for the ladies, stilettos do get stuck in cobblestones. The interior of the restaurant is warm, beautifully decorated and acoustically perfect. There was maybe 50 of us, and we all got the 5 course meal, which took just the right amount of time between speeches to come out. 

I have a fuzzy memory of the dishes, but I do recall an excellent tenderloin, with an intricate fingerling potato chips side, and a very tasty halibut with jerusalem artichoke puree, as well as some scallops as a starter that were just divine! 

Only complaint was that since the wedding was on a Sunday, the staff seemed more eager to leave and would take away our plates that weren't finished, or our drinks that weren't empty. As a result, a few unfinished cups of a really vintage scotch that my buddy saved for the special occasion was poured out."}
{"text":"If you want all the delicious food without the big cost of dinner, go to George for lunch. I am so glad I did.

I agree with some of the other reviewers, the location is a little sketchy, but it was like stepping into heaven when I walked through the front door.  The decor is perfection.  Every little detail is beautiful and elegant.  And that was before i walked out onto the back patio.  During the day, with the rays of sun coming through the trees and onto the unique umbrellas, the patio reminds me a bit of Alice in Wonderland.  It was really an experience.  One that transported me out of Toronto and into the world of George.

The tasting menu was a blind one, and I wasn't really in the mood to leave my food choices up to someone else so I had the following:

Stuffed artichoke - I thought it was good, perhaps a little bland, but my dining companion loved it.

Black cod - I didn't find this dish to be fishy at all.  I loved every bite.

White lasagne - mini meatballs.  Need I say more?  This was like fettucini alfredo in the form of lasagne with meatballs.  It was so delicious I wish I hadn't agreed to share it.

Halibut - good.  Fresh, perfectly cooked, a very light dish.  It was good, but not great.

Cornish hen - my lukewarm opinion of my halibut is probably because of the few bites I had of the cornish hen, which was incredible.  Crispy skin, moist, tender, it was absolutely incredible.

Dark chocolate beignets - no, these aren't the giant beignets you'd find in N'awlins.  They are perfect, cinnamon sugar-coated donuts filled with delightful dark chocolate and what I suspect is a tad of liquor.  I tried, in vain, to convince my dining companion that we needed to order more.  And, warning, if you go with another person, they serve these in an order of 5, so you'll have to fight over the last one.

George is really a dining experience.  One that transports you with both the ambiance AND the food.  Great meal."}
{"text":"We found George via a gift from our God-Daughter and her parents - she's 3.  We made plans for our anniversary dinner and we not disappointed.  The waiter was very attentive to food restrictions - my partner will not eat certain foods.  

What amazed us most was that after our first taste (compliments of the chef) our 5 courses with wine pairings were different with each course.  It ended up being 11 different dishes and 11 different wines (maybe 13 lost track).  A total surprise.  It was no wonder the kitchen staff outnumbered the wait and sommelier staff (there were at least 3 sommeliers - ours was a French major from U of T who had lived in France - so a lovely accent).

We were very pleased.  I have decided for my buyers and sellers, that this will be the treat at the end - dinner at George.  Such a great find.  Make reservations and plan to be amazed."}
{"text":"I think this is by far the best restaurant in toronto. The presentation, flavour, and service is top notch. I called to make reservations and they make sure to ask if it was for a special occasion.when we were seated the menu was explained in detail and made sure we didn't have any allergies. 

The food was amazing. Almost every dish was a surprise.

4.5 stars. Had to -0.5 because it is on the pricy side. 2 ppl with the 5 course taste test came to $350.00. Not an everyday meal but definitely a must try!"}
{"text":"I'm not realllly into \"Poncey Cuisine\", so I knew that this might be a bit..well, traumatic for me. It was my Wife's Birthday, so I decided to put my own neurosis aside and make a go of it.

 The Atmposphere was very non-pretentious - Score 1 Point there. 
 Waitstaff - knowledgeable, accomidating, friendly - Score 1 Point there.
 Food Presentation - Score 1 Point there.

 We had the 5 course tasting menu. Never really sure what you're going to get - so if could be awesome, or...not. At times it was like going into the Amazon Rainforest, surrounded by lush greenery, and seeing a Blue Frog. You reach out to touch it, then find out it's poisoness.  Bit of an abstract analogy, I admit...I appreciate what they were going for, but it was more style than substance."}
{"text":"Below are my two reviews ... one from one year ago and another review from one year later:

One year ago (2016)

This is by far the best restaurant I've been to in Toronto. The service is top notch. The food is exquisite. We had a 7 course meal, with wine pairing. Everything was unbelievably delicious. I dined with two other people, each having a 7 course meal. Not one dish was the same as the other - everyone had a different meal, so we literally had 21 different dishes in one night . All of us loved everything we ate. My favourite was the chefs award winning tuna. I will never forget this night. I look forward to celebrating my wedding here.

Update as of Sep 2017: i have now dined here 3 times, and after last night's experience, I have to say this is by far the best restaurant I've been to. Period. It was so nice to see familiar faces- our waiter Rob from the first time we ate at George, a year ago, served us again last night. The manager, Mark, came by to greet us last night, as he set up a little wine tasting session before our wedding day one year ago. Our other waiter, Justin, who served us on our wedding day last year, remembered us and talked about some of the fun details he remembers from our wedding. And Shana , our wedding coordinator, stopped by to say hello. I can't tell you enough how much this restaurant left an impression on me and my husband. Truly, a place you need to visit!!!"}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in Toronto (and Canada) hands down. I agree with some of the previous comments saying the experience is amazing. Service is impeccable. I do not consume red meat/chicken but eat fish/seafood and had the 5 courses meal. The food presentation was incredible and the flavors, even better. I was with friends from NYC that eat in great Soho/Tribeca restaurants on a regular base and they were all very astonished by the quality of food/wine at George."}
{"text":"Expected more for New Year's Eve dinner especially given price point and was hugely disappointed.  Bison cheek should be soft and tender and instead tasted like beef shank that's been in the oven for too long -- dry and chewy.  And the combinations are quite confusing.  You might be having a bite of something that tasted alright and then there's like a raisin in the bite out of nowhere that throws you off.  I don't know if they just had an off-night.  The servers were all very professional and the wines they chose for pairing were excellent. Would not recommend nor go back."}
{"text":"I must say, I had high expectations of my dining experience here given positive experiences in the past; however, the experience fell short overall. 

I recently dined here for a business meeting in a private room with approximately 15 of my colleagues. We were seated in a private dining room which was equipped with audio visual capabilities for our presentation. It was quite noisy, however, which unfortunately was disruptive to our meeting which was being broadcast online.

We were promptly greeted by our server, who was very attentive throughout the entire service. We were provided with a set menu of 4 courses. To note, we were asked about dietary restrictions and accomodations; however, when I asked to omit certain courses or have dessert to go, I was told that they were unable to do so.: To start we all received the George salad, which was essentially a plateful of overdressed mixed greens. After 'foraging' through the greens, I discovered about a tablespoon of mashed avocado underneath and a similar amount of plain quinoa. The second dish was a chicken and egg drop soup (which I asked to omit from my menu, although it was still brought out). I had requested this as I'm not a huge fan of egg drop soup in general, and I found this to be a very odd menu item for this restaurant. My colleagues who ate the soup found it to be quite bland and flavourless; several of them asked for extra salt and pepper. Overall, this menu item went relatively untouched.

For the third course we had 2 options, salmon with thai curry spaetzle or grilled beef tenderloin with mushroom confit and asparagus - The salmon was overcooked and dry, as was the pasta. My dinner companions chose the tenderloin and found that it was overcooked as per how they had requested it.

The dessert options were a caramel sponge (which no one chose) and a filo hay with fresh fruits. As I could not stay for dessert I had asked for it to go, which apparently they do not do.

In summary, this was atypical of what I have previously experienced at this restaurant. The service is consistent, with pleasant and attentive hosts; however, the meal itself was lack lustre. Given the restaurant's reputation and pricing, we expect better."}
{"text":"The food here is really good; each dish is presented nicely and has unique ingredients. I went with a friend for dinner and we shared 3 different dinner items and a dessert. The waiter was giving everyone 2 on the house items from the chef which tasted really good( first picture). We had the ahi tuna, cornish hen and pheasant. They all had a really good texture and taste which stands out from other restaurants. For dessert, we had the lemon tart sesame snap, passionfruit which was great and not too sweet(last picture). It's a high end restaurant so the prices are high but the quality is good and it's worth it."}
{"text":"George, such an amazing restaurant with a cozy vibe.  It's fancy, but not pretentious.  We had a group of four and we opted for the five-course meal at $110 per person.  It's chef's choice and they accommodate any food allergies.  Each course was well thought through with unique flavours and textures.  The dishes were well paced and allowed for great conversations in between.  Although we all ordered the same five-course meal, they served us different dishes.

Everything was made to perfection.  We had a complimentary starter, an option for fois gras, steak, seared tuna, and I was served a custard dessert.

This may very well be my favourite high-end restaurant in Toronto.  I booked a reservation on Open Table and despite the price category of the restaurant I still came in casual clothes.  I felt that the servers did not judge this mismatch attires that we came in and still treated us with the utmost respect.  The washroom was beautiful, clean with individual private stalls and fancy scented soap and lotion.

It's just so nice and relaxing to enjoy such a beautiful meal with wonderful servers. It made for such a great night."}
{"text":"One Of the best meals I have ever had.  We got the 5 course tasting menu.  It was 'double sided' which meant my wife and I got different items.  They were also very accommodating to dietary restrictions.  The ribeye I got was cooked and seasoned perfectly.  The short rib with foie gras on top was great, albeit a bit undersalted.  I also had a beet and tuna with avocado salad which was awesome.  Service was top notch.  What really was amazing was that each course was heavy on protein - yet I didn't feel overly full like I would on that much meat in the us.  Perhaps the cuts were better or the sauces were leaner.  Either way it was awesome.  Fancy but not pretentious."}
{"text":"4.5/5. Came here from rave reviews online and it is worth the hype. Menu is based on pre fix or a la carte of 3 items as the dishes aren't huge. Started with the lobster which looked like a crab cake set up and was excellent. Had gnocchi next and was by far the best. Among the very best gnocchi I've had anywhere. After that was the lamb which was also excellent. Didn't have any gamey taste at all. The ambiance was just ok. Seemed like I was eating at a glorified gastropub but not a big deal. The wine menu got an award in 2017 which is odd as the selection was average at best. I definitely would come again however."}
{"text":"Had the tasting menu.Overall, too much of everything.. seems like they're trying really hard to impress, but when you throw too much onto one plate, the taste just don't go together, and after 10 plus plates, it's just like a eating competition, not very pleasant, unfortunately. And since there're way too many courses , they actually forgot one course( me and my friend were debating if we should remind the server while we were having our dessert),they  did bring it out ( it was steak& foie gras ) after dessert( yup try to swallow some meat after dessert),but we were told that it's \"chefs treat\" but seriously , they thought we didn't notice. So not great on customer service either."}
{"text":"Heavily recommended by my bigwig brothers, George Restaurant was at the top of my places-I-need-to-eat list when I headed over there with my best friend - cash in our wallets and tapeworms in our bellies.

Having flirted with the friendly staff, with a nice cocktail in hand, and a lovely seat on the tranquil urban oasis patio, I could have called it a night right there and been happy.  But that is not what we came for, so both my B.F and I went for the tasting menu (apparently there is no other way to go according to all sources).  I am what the lords of language have now termed a pescetarian, so with title in hand I told the server I could only have a tasting menu of the sea, while my epicurean partner could eat anything he damn well pleased.  


Turns out I ate anything my friend pleased and he nearly swam out of George by the end of the meal...meaning of course the waiter confused our orders.  I left George, no longer a fake vegetarian and both my friend and I felt we just spent enough money to have flown to Montreal and all we got in return was the airplane food."}
{"text":"I had read about George before but hadn't thought too much about it, but we went last night for our 5th wedding anniversary on a recommendation from our hotel concierge and it isn't one I will forget anytime soon.

Our server was very helpful and attentive, as we weren't sure whether we wanted to do the tasting menu or a la carte.  We were worried about leaving hungry but she assured us it wouldn't be the case.  What was also cool was that we would get different items from each other for every course.  We opted for the 5 course tasting menu since it was our five year anniversary.  

Like what people said, the cocktails were amazing.  I got the El Diablo in a half size as I wanted wine after.  They gave us an amuse bouche to start and followed by some seafood salad (i got crab, the hubs got seared salmon), followed by our warm appetizer which had foie gras.  Our mains were rack of lamb and beef tenderloin.  They were so tender we didn't have steak knives. The sides were fairly inventive as well but not too exotic where my husband would be weirded out.  Cheese plate and dessert rounded it out and I was so full I couldn't eat the dessert.

The only thing that could be improved potentially was to have warm bread to start instead of cold.  It was delicious regardless but warm bread is always better than cold!

The other thing I wanted to mention that thrybhave a sommelier on site who gave us a great wine pairing with our entrees.  It definitely enhanced the dinner.

Ambiance was nice but the table next to us was pretty loud so we couldn't help listening to them."}
{"text":"Great place to date a foodie !!! The place has a chic vibe with brick walls and crystal chandeliers. 

Food presentation is like a piece of art. we had some high points and some just missed the mark. 

The cocktail menu had some interesting drinks.
I loved the tequila drink I ordered!  The have full size drinks  and half size drinks available, the latter works well for my wife :)

Our favorite dishes of the night
Black Cod, Cashew Crust, Roasted Beets - a tad fishy but the flavors worked in harmony

Pacific Halibut, Lobster Cavatelli, Mint Yogurt - packed a lot of flavor but subsequent bites gave the feeling that there was too much going on the plate

Rabbit Confit, Chanterelles, Salsa Verde - delicately cooked, very tender

Wild Mushrooms, Sweet Potato Pavé, Pumpkin Seeds - completely failed to impress, we ordered this dish based upon our server recommendation but if it is anything to go by, my advice would be to skip the vegetarian selections

White Chocolate Pumpkin Mousse
Brandied Raisins, Filo Hay - good way to end the meal and the filo hay added a nice textural contrast.

Service was top notch although summoning the cab was a bit of a disaster. We were informed that our cab had arrived but when we stepped out in the cold it was nowhere to be found. We ultimately found one ourselves and headed back to the hotel room.

Apparently they also offer tasting menus where you leave your destiny in the hands of the chef. Will definitely come back to try that out sometime soon."}
{"text":"This place is a bit pricy but the Vegetarian tasting menu is wonderful. My non vegetarian colleagues also enjoyed their meals. Next time We are in town we will return"}
{"text":"Very rude staff. Made reservation on open table, staff called to confirm ask to confirm location and told me can't understand your accent and I ask what's her name was her response was what is my name got to do with your reservation. I emailed and cancel my reservation for Mother's Day dinner."}
{"text":"What drew me to George was to give the tasting menu a try. Arrived at the restaurant and loved that from outside of the restaurant you can see all the chefs going at it. Was seated very quickly despite arriving earlier than the reservation. My date and I both opted for the 10-course tasting. Being allergic to seafood, I made a request and they were very accommodating.

What was nice about the tasting menu is the creativity that is spent on each dish and the transition from one dish to another. The starters were smaller in size and by the 4-6 dishes the plates were more generous. The arrangements of the plates were nice. I liked that I was able to essentially have a different meat each plate. Essentially ate a farm. In terms of taste, I really tried to love it but left with more just liking it. 

Service was impeccable. Forks and knives were changed between plates. As I got up to go to the washroom and moved my napkin, I found it neatly folded waiting for me as I returned. Water was filled constantly. Servers described each dish as they arrived(not that I remember them). Bread bowl was offered throughout the night while waiting between dishes. 

Overall the dining experience was the charm here. You can definitely see the close attention to detail on the food but the overall taste wasn't captivating by any means."}
{"text":"This place was such a great find.

My wife and I were looking for a new place to eat for our anniversary. I found George by searching online and they had a tasting menu available. My wife and I only eat fish and vegetarian when eating out so I was surprised when I found out they had a vegetarian and a pescatarian tasting menu as well. 

We opted for a hybrid. What really had me interested though is that when we arrived we were told that we would each be having 2 different meals prepared for us as my wife has specific allergies. It was really impressive and I really can't wait to dine here again.

The service was spot on and we felt taken care of. The waiting time between courses could have been shorter. But we were there on a busy night so I find that forgivable.

All in all, this is a great find and I'm blown away by what is provided here. Can't wait to eat here again."}
{"text":"I've been aching to try out a tasting menu - luckily I had the chance to try out the five course tasting menu here for my birthday!

Right off the bat, you can tell it's a pretty fancy place judging by the doorman at the entrance and the complimentary coat check service. They also give you complimentary bread throughout your meal that's very soft and fresh.

Initially I contemplated getting the 10 course meal, as I heard that tasting portions in general are pretty tiny. After eating here, I can confidently say that the 5 course was already pushing my limits. By the time I finished the last course, I was completely stuffed, full enough to last well into tomorrow.

Onto the courses (5 per person; 10 unique dishes):

Amuse-bouche: didn't really find anything special about it, although I liked the cheese. My boyfriend really liked his oysters.

Fish: tuna/couscous dish was delicious. My own halibut course had a creative assortment of textures and flavours.

Foie gras course: absolutely spectacular. Boyfriend said the foie gras was fantastic in particular. I also enjoyed his pork belly. My bison meat was tender and juicy and the accompanying vegetables were full of flavour. There were some grey bits in my dish that totally looked like worms but were actually malloreddus pasta.

Main course: I received the lambchops while he got the beef. Both meats were juicy and cooked a perfect medium rare. I especially enjoyed the potato cannoli.

Dessert part 1: we each received a trio of sweets. Blackcurrant Jam / avocado sorbet / canelé ; dried fruit cannoli / pear sorbet / nut brittle. All delicious. The sorbet was very creamy and not icy at all. I thought the jam paired really nicely with the avocado sorbet.

Dessert part 2: I have a huge sweet tooth, so this was one of the highlights of the night. I had a pistachio blondie topped with mascarpone and some kind of fried(?) bananas coated with cinnamon sugar. Off to the side were roasted nuts, sliced fruit, and some red sauce/jam dots that I particularly liked. The nuts had the most amazing toasty flavour, and the red sauce tasted so mellow and refreshingly sweet. Bananas were melt-in-your-mouth delicious. It was absolutely amazing and my favourite dish of the night.

Overall a night well spent (it takes 2.5 hours for the five course). Despite not looking super fatty, their food is actually pretty rich in oil. I started getting full after the fish course, so I probably didn't enjoy the food as much as I would have, had I been completely starved for food throughout the entire meal. One thing that did help is that there's a ~30 min wait time between each dish, giving you a bit of time to digest everything. Just make sure not to fill up on too much bread between courses.

It's quite expensive ($240 for two before tax + tip) but definitely recommended for a special occasion or a fancy night out!"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful dining experience here tonight, and I say it was an experience bc we were there for 2.5 hours doing the tasting menu. It was my husband's bday so we were celebrating that, and this restaurant got great reviews.
We decided on the 5 course tasting menu so we got to try 10 different courses together. I'd say some were hits and some were not our favorite. Nothing was bad but there were some questionable dishes.
1st course- tuna was really yummy and the curry yogurt on top was delicious 
2nd course- foie gras with pork was very tasty and melted in my mouth
3rd course- ribeye steak- I didn't love this and it was seasoned too sweet strangely
4th course- avocado gelato- this took getting used to bc it was weird having the avocado but it grew on me
5th course- blondie with marscapone- this was really yummy.

Had the old fashion cocktail which was very solid! Tons of fresh citrus and a tasty cherry."}
{"text":"Besssssssssssst tasting menu dining experience EVER! Everything was to the 9s! I cannott wait to come back! Not only was the food bomb dot com but their service also really stood out to me. They had an army of people working there AKA extremely attentive and personable service to make sure NOTHING is missed. My fiance brought me here for my birthday and we both opted for the 5 course tasting menu. I thought we were going to have the same dishes per course but we each had a different dish per course so it was almost like a 10 course tasting menu because we got to taste each others. I. LOVE. GEORGE."}
{"text":"Food was great, not so much on the service part though. If I had the option of giving half a star, I would give it a 2.5. 

I've been to many restaurant in Toronto, but this one is the only one that I took my time to write something about. 
The atmosphere and food was perfect but the service was slow and less than so so. It was a friend's birthday and we did the 7 course meal with a bottle of wine. We waited 15 min for our server to ask us for drinks, and he was only to be seen half an hour later for our food order...20 min...our entry course came followed by first and second and third... I wanted some bread to eat with the 4th plate which was the foie gras so I called our server and asked for bread... Aside from his  RBF through our entire dining experience, he was in disbelief  of my request and replied... OhHh you wanted some MORE bread? I almost felt like he rolled his eyes at me...... I really wanted to tell in his face that... No I wouldnt like some more bread if I gotten some in the beginning when we waited half an hour drinking wine waiting for starters to arrive... And through out this entire time, our server never came over and asked us how our food were... Wow. If you didn't feel like working today or don't care about what you are going to get later on in tips then you should have just stayed home...  So Yeap, I don't think I would return just because of the service alone."}
{"text":"What a great surprise to find such imaginative food combinations. We did the tasting menu and had a blast. The appetizer of tuna tataki, foie gras with duck, bison and passion fruit meringue were incredible. It was fun to taste my husband's dishes but somehow I liked mine better. This is is an amazing place. The staff were friendly and professional.  We will definitely try it again."}
{"text":"I won't go into the details of the meal because it was very long. My complaint is mostly with the waiter. I had ordered the pork belly, but he brought out a pork loin sausage. When I told him it was the wrong item, he told me that they didn't serve pork belly. However, he ratted off the word \"pork belly just earlier when he told us of the fixed menu. Not only that, it was printed in the menu as the a la carte. instead of arguing with him, I asked him to bring the menu. He left for a while, then came back without apologizing and said it was coming. Later, as I was going to the washroom, I over heard him telling the manager that I had ordered the loin instead of the belly. I think this is very poor practice, since I know exactly what I had ordered. The waiter had a bit of an attitude which I didn't appreciate. My brother felt that his 7 course fixed meal was a real miss. He thought it was  boring, nothing special and overpriced. 
Will not be going back again nor will I recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"The Mr. took me to George for my bday and it was a very special treat.

The food was amazingly delicious and the presentation was on point.  I had the halibut which came with an asian flavour slaw on top of sticky rice, mango salsa and deep fried broccoli. The halibut was perfectly cooked and mildly seasoned so it can be flexible enough to compliment the slaw and/or mango salsa.  I thought that was very clever. My husband ordered the tenderloin with a side of foie gras. If you like foie gras, you need to add this!!! It's so worth it to elevate the already tasty tenderloin for an extra $15! It's a pretty generous portion and seared to perfection.  

I didn't give George a five star because it took our server a while before he came by to take our drink order, then food order, there were also a prolonged delay in bringing out our main entree and worst of all, I never got a happy birthday on my plate even though my husband said we were celebrating my birthday. I just felt at this level and price point, doing these little things to make customers happy should already be part of their business model."}
{"text":"Good food cool atmosphere. Contemporary. Good vibe. Service pretty slow though we were outside. Maybe better inside.  Would certainly come back."}
{"text":"So delicious! But so expensive!

I had the 5-course tasting menu with wine. If you come here, order the tasting menu, not the à la carte. The chef here and his great team are known for their tasting menus. They have a vegetarian tasting menu and are sensitive to food allergies. 

To start there was an amuse-bouche and a French bubbly made in the style of champagne but with Chardonnay. It was very nice. Usually I'm not a fan of bubbly but this one wasn't too effervescent and tasted nicer. The amuse-bouche was ok--a yucca fry with a house-made honey mustard drizzle. There was a sad green vegetable, possibly broccolini with missing florets on top, and thinly sliced carrot. It was pretty detailed but not that amusing. The rest that follows was definitely better. 

The first course was a raw fish course, I think I heard it was a tuna. It had a lot of great flavours and was one of the more attractive dishes. The wine paired with that was a German Pinot Grigio. 

Next was pork belly with foie gras. It came with some delicious sweet potato thing--thin, savoury slivers. There was a neat noodle-looking thing for presentation that added a good texture contrast. Very good. The accompanying wine was a light red from Spain. 

For the main course, it was lamb. Pretty good. I have had more flavourful lamb but this was satisfactory. Not the strongest dish but an attractive, pleasing experience nonetheless. The thin, possibly scallop potatoes were amazing. The wine with this one was a 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon from the Niagara region. Very delicious wine!

First dessert was an avocado gelato. Accompanying it was a berry syrup of some sort. Very tasty flavour combination, and the accompanying 2003 Cuvée went excellent with it. 

And finally, the final dessert course, which seemed to be a fancy banana dish. Very fragrant with warm, autumn and winter spices, strawberries, granola, and sugar-coated cooked bananas. The accompanying 2014 Australian dessert wine was amazing. 

Price was pretty insane. I think the tasting menu was $120 plus $90 for wine pairings plus tax and tip. After everything it was somewhere between $270 and $300 for one person. Definitely not a cheap date, and may be better reserved for special occasions, for which you should make reservations well in advance. 

I finished everything except the main, which I got packed up. You will be full after those 5 courses. 

George was such a great experience. I really enjoyed the meal and wine here. Very good attention to detail, and everything was enjoyable."}
{"text":"My parents recently took me here for my birthday. We had the five course tasting menu and were pleasantly surprised! Unlike most tasting menus that serve the same courses to everyone, George takes an interesting approach and serves everyone a different appetizer, main course, etc. So in reality, a five course meal showcased 15 diverse dishes. Versatility was a big theme. Every dish was delicious, however there were an excessive use of sauces that weren't always necessary. The portions were larger than typical tasting menus, as I ended up taking dessert to go. A great venue to celebrate a special occasion! 

Highlights:

*striped bass crudo with cilantro yogurt 
*sage ice cream wine jelly 
*pumpkin cheesecake"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!!!!

By far my favorite restaurant in the city! The food is outstanding that the waitstaff really get to know you personally, I went on two separate dining occasions and the waiter remembered me and that I like a certain type of wine and brought it to me as part of my meal. Talk about service!!  I've recommended this place to numerous friends/family and even casual acquaintances.

The nice features about this restaurants layout is that is has a large open kitchen with a plating area which can be viewed from the chef's table available by request or reservation.  The second nice dining experience is a small private room that they have that can be closed off if you're looking for that special dining experience.  I've also heard but never experienced that they have an outdoor patio which I'm dying to try one of these days. 

It's definitely one of those places you bring people for special occasions or entertain visitors or business associates as it's quiet enough to enjoy but the place doesn't seem like it's on it's last legs.


The restaurant has three different prices for their tasting menu 5,7,10 courses starting at $90 per person up to $130.

Parking is found via a general Public parking lot across the street and accepts major credit cards.

I would definitely go back to George again if not for the great food and ambiance then definitely the attention they give every customer that walks in the door."}
{"text":"You will never know there's such a hidden gem along in this area. Its located in a beautiful building and the interior has a certain nice industrial, exposed brick wall look to the architecture. Loved the half open kitchen concept where you can actually see the hustle bustle without being all too noisy.

The service was good and attentive. From the hostess, to the waiter and servers and bus boys. They all deserve a mention and thumbs up for their attentiveness and efficiency. 

The drinks menu was extensive, along with a great choice of interesting cocktails mixture. The Hendricks Hurricane cocktail which I tried was fresh and proved as a palate cleanser in between meals for me. A good pick!

Food wise, interestingly enough you can either order a tasting menu which range from five, seven or ten course tasting menu. As I did not have the stomach to go with five, I only ended up with two dishes which was a good portion for me. 

I ordered the sea scallops with du puy lentils, watercress as appetizer and the pacific halibut with curry spätzle and english peas as main. The taste was pleasing and certainly a tease to my taste palate.

I later finished off with a great cup of cappuccino, although the coffee art was 
non-existent, but I do have to say it was a good cup of cappuccino. I will have to go back next time round to try the desserts. 

Definitely a place with great ambiance, delicious food and great service!"}
{"text":"A regular destination of me and my wife - both vegetarian. They're one of the few places that do high-end vegetarian extremely well and with pleasure. They're happy to accommodate any restrictions, but be willing to try new things, their double-blind tasting menu is worth the adventure."}
{"text":"Elite level service, but that was expected. Had the 7 course and split the wine pairing. As the other reviewers mentioned the courses were different for the two of us, so we got to try 14 different courses. Many unique flavours, some fragrant flavours as well. They use alot of high end ingredients like foie gras. Overall we had a great experience here and it's definitely worth it to at least once."}
{"text":"Great food.
Beautiful back patio. 
Timeless atmosphere and well decorated.
Very knowledgeable staff in regards to the menu and their wine list.
The price is justified."}
{"text":"Really don't get it - honestly, food was sub-par , venison under seasoned , cod was over cooked and didn't seem all that fresh  - table was wobbly - service and wine was great , but definitely not worth it."}
{"text":"Food was great as expected by the number of amazing reviews everywhere, but service was below average. We only ordered three courses off the menu (and glad we did, otherwise we would have been there for hours) but they were extremely slow with clearing out the plates that every time someone brought us the next set of dishes he literally had to turn his back and hid at the corner until someone else came to pick up the dirty plates and gave us a new set of cutlery. It happened with all three courses including our desserts. Their food is quite flavorful especially the sides and garnish, so I'd go back and hope that I don't get stuck with the same server who's very slow and negligent. Their duck plate is a must try, probably the best duck I've had so far!"}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant with great food and great atmosphere.  I had dinner for a work event and all of us were very impressed.  The outside looks like an apartment complex but once you get inside you can tell there was a great amount of time, creativity and attention to detail in creating this space. As a matter of fact the restaurant was named after the architect that designed the space.  See his picture attached.  There is a small bar area and then plenty of seating in various cool spaces through-out. We were a party of 8 and they seated us in the cage.....an area  that's sectioned off by a rusty old metal gazebo like cage.  VERY COOL.  I would describe the space as retro rustic.  Now to the food.  It's a tasting menu with a 3 course layout. I attached the menu that we had.  Small portions as a tasting menu would suggest.  Everyone's order was extremely liked. I substituted the soup.....a roasted mushroom for the first course and it was delightful.  I ordered the scallops for the second course and again they were a nice size and flavorful.  I finished with the beef tenderloin medium rare and it was delicious. I wasn't crazy about the potatoe risole but all else was again very flavorful.   I guess that's how I would describe George's tasteful decor and flavorful entrees with great presentation.  The service was top notch and what you would expect from a restaurant of this caliber.  It is pricey so bring your checkbook.....it's worth it!"}
{"text":"With Susur gone, I'd say George now offers the best set menu meal I've experienced in the city. Expect a fresh, creative menu every day that will blow you away, with amuse bouches peppered in between and service that makes you feel appreciated. The food style is somewhat modern but mixes in some traditional comfort.

In the summer months, their calm back patio makes the experience all the better."}
{"text":"I've been here several times over the years. In the past, service has been impeccable. Unfortunately that was not the case with my most recent lunch with a client. Things started out OK and I was shown to a table by the hostess. My client joined me a few minutes later. Shortly thereafter, someone approached and asked if I was waiting for [name]. I look at him, a bit puzzled, not knowing who he was (i.e. whether he was a patron or staff), and said no. He apologized and walked away from the table toward, as I noticed, a somewhat nervous looking waiter who was standing a distance away, apparently observing this. 

A few minutes later, the maitre d' came over and informed us that we were sitting at the wrong table, and gestured for us to shift to another table. A bit perplexed and somewhat irritated, we obliged and took at seat at another table, while they moved things over. A bit later, he came over and apologized, indicating that the hostess was new and had only been on the job for 3 days, and very kindly offered myself and my client a complimentary glass of wine.

Later, during the course of meal, our waiter came over and asked if I was [my name]. I said yes, and he said, \"Oh great, I'm glad I checked as we were going to mark you down as a no-show for your reservation.\" I looked at him, again slightly perplexed and thanked him, and he went on his way.

Had this happened at a more casual place, I wouldn't have given it a second thought. However, when going somewhere that holds itself out to be of this calibre, it's somewhat disappointing, insofar as none of it should have happened at all. To perhaps explain my disappointment a bit further, these were the thoughts that were going through my head when all of this happened:

- When bringing another guest to the table he thought he should be at and finding me there, what could have possibly prompted the waiter to suggest that the guest approach me to ask, rather than going back and checking with the maitre d' or the hostess? I can only imagine the discomfort felt by the other guest and was myself certainly perplexed. That seems to be what happened (though I can't quite be sure) and if it was, it certainly seemed to be a rather odd course of action to take.

- We were asked to move without any explanation other than the fact that the hostess had limited experience and we were seated at the \"wrong\" table. The table to which we were moved was of course in a different location, but the exact same size. There was nothing that seemed to be worse than the table we were moved from - it wasn't right beside the bathroom or the kitchen or anything. Which made me wonder - why bother moving us at all, and instead leave us there and show the other guest to another table? They seemed fungible enough, and yet we were offered no explanation. The excuse of lack of experience of the hostess irked me a bit. Surely restaurants like George do offer some basic training before rolling out staff, do they not? Surely such training and three days on the job would have enabled a hostess to know the numbering of the tables, would it not?

- I have no idea why the waiter felt the need to come over to check who I was. I would have thought that after the prior incident with the moving of tables, they would have figured out who I was. Surely the maitre d' or hostess would have known (otherwise how would they have know to ask us to move), so why would the waiter have felt the need to approach me, and mention to both myself and my client, that I almost got blackballed as a no-show? 

All things considered, I'm perhaps less bothered by the fact any of this happened and much more bothered by the fact it did happen. In other words, this seemed to happen due to a rather perplexing inability to use common sense, which, for this level of establishment, is what irked me.

That being said, the food was, as usual, impeccable. 

I'm certainly not suggesting that anyone avoid George for a nice lunch or dinner out with a friend, but if you're thinking of doing so with an important client, perhaps consider another venue. At least until they manage to figure things out."}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate my girlfriend's birthday, we both had the 7 course tasting menus with wine pairing. Just a heads up, it's quite a bit of wine. Each glass was amazing, but 7 glasses in.. well you might just want to avoid driving. 

What can I say. The service was really outstanding. They accommodated our table's allergies and still provided incredible dishes. The service from everyone, especially our waiter and wine-expert was spectacular.

The past few months I was beginning to think that I'm becoming a pretty good cook.. Until I ate here and tasted what real chefs can do. No food I have tasted compares to the flavours created at George. The way each dish came together took a high degree of finesse. It was a real fine dining experience, and one for the books. Will return for special occasions with my girlfriend, it's our new favourite. Very pricy, but if you like a nice night out and are willing to fork out the dough, then you may find it worth it like us."}
{"text":"I've been here twice for business and it has always been a delight. The food speaks for itself. The decor is lovely and service is pleasant. They have a backyard/patio where we can mix and mingle before the sit-down dinner. Their hors d'oeuvres are so good that I have to remind myself to save room for dinner. I'm kinda addicted to their sweet potato wrapped ahi tuna but the rest is delicious as well. Even though I don't usually like cheese platters, I do like their sheep cheese option as oppose to cow cheese or goat cheese. Bring an empty stomach if you're planning on finishing all the courses."}
{"text":"We went to George for a birthday celebration.  We opted for the 7-course tasting menu.  The food was quite good.  The ingredients were top notched and fresh. There was a good variety of flavours and ingredients over the 7 courses.  The food had great contrast of texture.  The plating was beautiful.  The compilation of some dishes was so complex that I had a hard time splitting a half out to share with my dining partner.  The only pet peeve I had was that there were unreasonably long breaks between the second, the third, and the fourth courses.  In all, I recommend the tasting menu if this is your first time at George, or the only time should you are visiting Toronto.   I personally would opt for the regular menu on my next visit.  This is because the tasting menu is quite expensive when compared to the regular menu.  Further, 7 courses are too much food for me.  The 5-course tasting menu would have been sufficient.

Note for diners who are interested in the tasting menu: 7-course tasting menu takes approximately 3 hours to finish.  I was told the 10-course one would take 4 hours.  If you are interested in the bigger tasting menu, kindly allocate sufficient time when you make the reservation."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the top dining experiences I've enjoyed. The three criteria I typically consider are quality of food, service, and value; George knocks the first two out of the park and meets the average for value.

Both the waiter and sommelier took careful time to explain the highlights of various items and suggest the best pairings. The timing and explanations were exceptionally thoughtful.

I ordered the A La Carte menu for the Sea Scallops, Pumpkin Pastina, Broccoli, and the Pacific Halibut, Lobster Cavatelli, Mint Yogurt items, as well as the Daily Soup. Scallops were deliciously seasoned and well presented, while the Halibut was slightly dry but still great. I loved the cavatelli that came with the halibut as well."}
{"text":"George is the kind of place that you indulge in on special occasions...it's not extravagantly expensive if you are careful on the wine and go a-la carte but you can expect to spend a lot more than your typical 'high-end' restaurant.

The restaurant has a classic look and elegance and the ambiance you would expect from a place like this. 

You can have your meal a-la carte but the restaurant is known for its tasting menus. They offer 5, 7 and 10 course tasting menus and will do wine pairing for each. We ended up doing a 5 course tasting with the wine pairing and in this case it was a double-blind (each person got a different item and wine for each course).

The food itself was fantastic; beautifully presentation, excellent flavour, and extremely creative. The wine was paired fantastically and complemented each course very well. The sommelier who poured the wine provided a bit of background on each type served. Other than a slight mix-up at the end (we're pretty sure our food courses were switched) the dinner was as close to perfect as you can get.

Highly recommend checking this out at least once - definitely do the tasting menu with the wine pairing but be prepared to spend around $500 for 2 people (includes tax and tip)."}
{"text":"WHAT TO TRY??

They have tasting menu as well as a-la-carte. I usually get the tasting menu because they are known for their tasting menu and sometimes it's nice to have an element of surprise when I'm eating once in a while!

If you go for the tasting menu, I recommend the 5 course menu. Having a choice of either 5,7 or 10 courses, and I having tried the 5 and 7 course meals, I find the 5 course menu more than enough food to eat comfortably. 

The menu is determined by the head chef ahead of time and not all people at the table may get the same dishes so it's nice that there's a variety there too! You can let the servers know your dietary restrictions and they will accommodate it! The dishes are created based on the ingredients in season and they try their best to source their ingredients at the local farms. 

The tasting menu also has a vegetarian option and it is cheaper than the regular tasting menu so that's great to accommodate those vegetarians too! 

LAST TIP?!

This restaurant has a chef's table where the table can see how the kitchen prepares the dishes via a mirror on the ceiling. If you want to see how busy the kitchen is and how they prepare your dish, you might want to request a table closer to the kitchen!"}
{"text":"Outstanding service and delicious food. Took the family for a special evening out and George surpassed every expectation. It is an expensive night out but the experience was worth it."}
{"text":"Perfect spot for a special occasion! 
Decor - 10/10
Service - 10/10
Food - 10/10 ...food was nothing like we've ever had before, worth every penny!"}
{"text":"Came here on my birthday with friends. Parking was just right across the street, there's street parking. It's a Friday night, place is packed with people. The waiter was charming and funny, we had the seven course tasting menu and a bottle of champagne. The waiter was patient about what our dietary need, almost everyone of us can't eat something, which he said no problem. The food is great, everything on the plate was well decorated, all edible... at least that's what I thought and ate. Each course came in 3 variations, it's interesting and fun! Being the birthday boy, I get to taste every dish there is. Yes I'm a pig and \"Come into my belly, YOU\". after the fourth course, service was really slow, perhaps the restaurant is super crowded. There's a lot of food, I thought I would need to order extra, but that thought was unnecessary. Charming waiter would sometime forget little things, then after reminding came double the amount. I had an awesome experience. Will come back again"}
{"text":"I agree with others that George is pretentious.  Definitely overpriced for what you get.  Not customer service oriented at all when my client what to take reminder of menu to go he was refused!"}
{"text":"We went for our anniversary and we will go again. The dinner was incredible and the service perfect. The knowledge passed to us about our wine was so interesting and offered with such passion."}
{"text":"This was an incredible meal.  We did the 7 course tasting menu and highly recommend it. 

I would have scored this 5 stars, but the kitchen got a little slow on the last 3 courses.    Service was top notch with a team presenting each course exactly at the same time to the table.  Each server seems to know the details of each dish precisely and spent a great deal of time telling us about the chefs choices.   Very good wine list.  

Allow LOTS of time.  7 courses took us from 7:30 to 11:30.  Memorable dishes were:   A tuna sashimi dish (I might have the fish wrong, but it was wonderful), beef tenderloin, venison chop and the white chocolate dessert.   

We tried the house suggested cocktails and loved the Rob Roy and the -20 c vodka martini with great green olives."}
{"text":"My friend liked George so I decided to bring my mom and friend here. And it was a great decision because this is one of the best fine dining restaurants I have ever been to. The food come in smaller portions so they recommend 2-3 dishes to be full and that was accurate. I had the scallops with lentils and it was the best lentil mix I have ever had. I also had the lobster dish and it was also very good. Basically the food here is visually pleasing AND has tons of flavours. Each dish probably has at least 10 ingredients on it and they all taste great individually. 

Service was spectacular. Our server did not interrupt us he would stand to the side until we acknowledge him. When my friends food arrived but she went to the washroom, he came to put a cover over her food. He \"crumbed\" throughout the dinner and filled water without our noticing. He was also polite and helpful with explaining things.

There were quite a few people there but food wasn't slow at all. 

Great atmosphere too! Not too loud or quiet. Highly recommend and would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Don't bother with the tasting menu. Old restaurant trying to keep up with the times. They served one dish which I couldn't comprehend why any restaurant would serve, It was literally 2 hairs of kale served under a tiny piece of fish on a bread plate, which looked and tasted like something out of a can. Flavors on every other dish was mediocre and nothing special. The dishes are dressed up with so many different purees and sauces that you don' event know how to really eat the dish (since waiters don't really explain either). Majority of dishes felt and tasted unbalanced with so many different things going on. Keep it simple.."}
{"text":"This place is always amazing. I overheard some ladies talking about this restaurant on the subway and thought I better check it out. I went with my fiancé during Valentine's Day and every dish was delicious. The buffalo was amazing!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place...might be my favorite in Toronto. I find the tapas style chefs choice the best way to go. 6-8 pieces is best unless you're American in which case go for the 10."}
{"text":"I had a good feeling about George which is why I decided to dine here for my first wedding anniversary. 

Located along the quieter side of Queen street you would never know a hidden gem was situated along a line of unassuming buildings. Arriving prompt for our 8:30pm reservation we were kindly greeted by a hostess. She led us pass the small bar located near the entrance to our cozy booth in the back of the restaurant against an exposed brick wall. Distressed hardwood floors, low industrial ceilings, white linen draped tables equip with candlelight feels intimate and romantic.

Our server warmly introduces himself and goes over the wine and cocktails for the evening. We settle on two glasses on rose. Our waiter brings over a nicely chilled bottle for us to sample before committing to the glass. We both our sold on it.

After explaining the menus and specials for the night he gives us some time to decide on our selections . After seeing all the delights on the a la carte menu we decide to for go the tasting menu and create our own 5 course tasting from selections provided.

As we await our first course a basket of soft french bread is presented to us to nibble on while we wait. We are then surprised with two complimentary amuse bouches. Mine was a tempura zucchini blossom with rhubarb compote. It was delightful and a perfect opening to the courses to come.

First Course
Sea Scallops - Asparagus Slaw, Du Puy Lentils 
The fresh scallops were thinly sliced accompanied by a vibrant crunchy citrus flavoured slaw and the lightly spiced lentils gave another dimension to the dish

Second Course
Lobster - Roasted Black Miso Butter, Cauliflower 
Perfectly cooked chunks of seasoned lobster were the perfect accompaniment to soak up the rich roasted miso butter broth. Again I loved the pop of flavour from the curried cauliflower woven between the lobster

Third Course (Main)
Beef Tenderloin - Sweet Potato Pave, Shiitake Jus 
The tenderloin was a perfect medium rare and simply melt in your mouth scrumptious paired with the plump smokey Shiitake jus was divine. The stir fried julienne vegetables and tender sweet potato ribbon were beautifully displayed and equally delicious. And a surprise taste of egg Benedict was a rich yet playful garnish to a well rounded main.

Fourth Course (Cheese)
Chamble - Hard aged goat cheese Montreal, Québec 
I adored this tangy strong flavoured cheese. Served with figs, candied walnuts and marmalade made for the perfect bite of sweet and salty on the toasted baguette.

Fifth Course (Dessert)
Chocolate Mousse - Almond Crumble, Raspberry 
A chocolate lover's dream! The rich semi-sweet chocolate mousse sat upon a sinful ganache layer and a contrasting raspberry layer added some tart to help balance all the sweet. The toasted almonds added some crunch making it the perfect ending to a magnificent meal.

Overall I have to say I was completely blown away with every aspect of this meal. The service was amazing - upon every course the waiter would explain all the components of the dish, courses were adequately spaced apart and perfectly portioned, cutlery reset and table crumbs removed, our waiter was attentive refilling glasses and checking up on us alerting us when the next course was coming, food was exquisite, amazing flavours and textures, every dish was beautifully plated like works of arts.

To top it all off the waiter presented us with a card and a cookie plate with Happy Anniversary written in chocolate and then offering to hail a cab for us when we were ready to depart. George is the perfect example of fine dining at it's Best surpassing my expectations and dare I say quite possibly one of the best meals I've ever had!"}
{"text":"We went here and got the 7 course with wine tasting menu. Everything was amazing! They take the time to explain each dish to you and each wine to you. If you decide to go with the 5 7 or 10 course it doesn't mean more or less food they amounts will be the same portions spilt up into more or less dishes. The experience will take ne where from 3-4 hrs."}
