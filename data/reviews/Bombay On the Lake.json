{"text":"Food was great. The real authentic Indian food. Taste was so delfish! Service was awesome and very courteous. Definitely coming back.  If you are craving for Indian food like us, recommending this restaurant for you to try!"}
{"text":"Wonderful staff, very friendly. Their portions are great sizes and enough rice or naan to share between two. Great prices as well. Would definitely recommend going again."}
{"text":"This place has never failed me! It's my go-to place since I live in the area. Love the food here specially the paneer kadai(which I mostly eat) and paratha. I visit the place atleast once in 10 days, sometimes for lunch but mostly for dinner. Their service is great and the staff is friendly too. I have met the owner and she seems to be a very nice lady. Their food is always fresh unlike other indian places and their naans or roti are the best in Toronto! I find them very reasonably priced and I have never gone wrong with anything I ordered off the menu. My friends always order the chicken madrasi which is spicy but they would surely recommend it to all the meat lovers out there!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food & Great service. The first few costs here I found the naan bread to be a little too well done. But That hasn't been a concern lately...the mango lassie is very tasteful.   I will continue to order my Indian food from here :)"}
{"text":"I've visited Bombay on the Lake several times, and I've also had their food delivered to my place on numerous occasions. My latest visit was on Sunday, as I had a friend in town and we were both dying for some Indian food. The reason I would recommend Bombay on the Lake to my friends, is not only because of the tasty food, but, they have excellent service. Every time I visit their restaurant, the owner and servers are very courteous, and provide myself and my guests with a warm welcome. The interior itself is very clean, and has a pleasant d√©cor. Whether you are knowledgeable about Indian cuisine, or not, the staff are always open to making recommendations for your meal.   The two of us ordered the following meal: Goan Shrimp Curry Lamb Rogan Josh Butter Chicken 1 x Onion Kulcha 1 x Garlic Naan 1 x rice dish  As always, our food arrived in a prompt manner, and each of the dishes were delicious! Although I enjoyed all of the food, my personal favourites were the Onion Kulcha/and Goan Shrimp Curry (outstanding!!!). If you're seeking a positive dining experience, excellent Indian food, and, all at an affordable price,  you should definitely check out Bombay on the Lake."}
{"text":"Butter chicken is top notch. A friend of mine orders from here all the time, the delivery has always been fast and the food tasty."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had dinner here tonight. We really enjoyed ourselves. The service was very friendly and our server knew exactly what was in everything (very useful since I am vegan). The food was made fresh and he made mine less spicy for me. We shared the vegetarian appetizer platter and for our mains I had the vegetarian curry dish with okra (bhindi masala) and my boyfriend had chicken korma kashmiri. We both loved the appetizer platter and it was a very generous serving size, and I really liked my okra dish. My boyfriend liked his dish, but not as much as the appetizers or some other Indian chicken dishes he's had. They brought a complimentary serving of rice for my boyfriend to eat with the sauce from his dish.  The ambiance is very different than what I would have expected from the sign outside. I really liked it, lots of warm colours and elephant decor. It was kind of dimly lit, as we read in a review before going, but we didn't find it too dark at all.  It really wasn't busy. There was one other couple there when we got there, and a handful of people came in for takeout. We hope they get enough business that they will be able to keep it up, because we would really like to go back!"}
{"text":"Good food, tasted fresh, attentive service."}
{"text":"I was very impressed with the food. Nice quiet and friendly atmosphere. Food was fresh and great."}
{"text":"Just had lunch here they always make the best food. Staff is extremely nice. It's street parking but I always find a spot."}
{"text":"Food was very bad. Chicken and shrimp curries were awful. After complaining to the staff, they said- you should have ordered something else. They have a mandatory tip for parties of more than 6. Overpriced."}
{"text":"The food is fantastic and the staffs are really nice. I had a lot of great dinners there."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Major positive indicators at the start were absence of pork and beef from the menu (as is common in India), and that no one asked how spicy we wanted our dishes (spiciness of the dish is determined by the dish type, offering adjustable spiciness suggests questionable cooking methods). Service was timely and pleasant, and the food was excellent! Veg pakora, onion bhaji, with mint raita and and unnamed sweet-spicy chutney. Then lamb vindaloo (tender meat, no stringy fatty bits), chicken madrasi (tender-cooked, not dry), baingan bharta (eggplant), garlic naan (fresh, garlicky), jeera rice (buttery with cumin). Also at no point did I taste excessive salt (some Toronto Indian restaurants can be Very salty). Excellent meal all round. Will return."}
{"text":"Dined here recently, saw a plethora of great reviews, it did not live up to the expectation. The food and service were good, but at best I would say it is average.   Pluses are the Lassi were delicious, the samosas were done right, served with a choice of tamarind or corrinader   For the mains, tried the butter chicken and chicken tikka masala.  The butter chicken was ok, I'm more use to the chicken being prepared tandoori style first, this was tiny cubes of chicken breast in a butter chicken sauce. Sure it was ok, but not as authentic as I would have expected from an Indian restaurant.   The tikka masala was quite delicious, but I ordered extra hot, and it just tasted as though habanero sauce was poured in, once again not what I would expect. Perhaps simmered with some chillies is how I typically see this dish presented.   Overall I was not terribly disappointed, and the cost/value was ok. Perhaps I'm a tad too picky? But then again I do know my food and what I like."}
{"text":"first time i've been here - ordered take out, lamb rogan josh and chicken tikka masala this food is gross - slimy, they don't take the large seeds out before serving, it's not spicy, very watery will not be returning"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised after having dinner at Bombay on the Lake.  The food was great.  My friend and I had the chicken bryiani, coconut lamb mutter panzer and garlic nana an.  The food was tasty and distinct as with some Indian rests tend to use very similar sauce base.  Portion size was good and filing.  The staff and owners were nice and personable.  I look forward to the next time visit"}
{"text":"Not bad, quick fresh and local. Good resturant for the family. Cost effective and good food."}
{"text":"The food is ok, but having been there a few times, I still haven't discovered \"a favourite\".  The ambiance is lacking. Unless you get one of the 4 tables by the window, it's very dark inside, and overall the interior is old and tired."}
{"text":"You've had the rest in south Etobicoke, now you need to smarten up and have the best. Living near the area here, I had been blinded by another subpar Indian restaurant, accepting that it was as good as it gets for the area and submitted to eating poorly portioned, bland take-out/delivery whenever a South Asian craving hit me.   Then out on a whim, after passing it in the car, I gave Bombay On the Lake a call and placed our usual Friday night/Sunday \"too lazy to cook\" delivery Indian meal. This consists of Veggie Pakora, Saag Paneer, Butter Chicken OR Lamb Vindaloo, plain Basmati rice and approx 2-3 garlic naan. The result? Fan-fricken-tastic.  Delivery time was (and continues to be) faster than estimated, the portion sizes, especially when it comes to number of chunks of meat, were exceptional - easily enough to have a second or third helping. The flavour of each dish is exactly as I know it should be, the sauce of the Butter chicken is so smooth and velvety that it actually tickled my taste buds as it danced across my tongue. I'm not the biggest fan of Veggie Pakoras but my fiancee claims these are a must have and loves their way of making them better than any other we've had to date.  And guys, garlic naan? F'real? It's incredible, in fact I would go as far as to say there is Naan-other better out there/ KNAWUTIMSAYIN???  So why only 4? I'm reserving this for the first time I decide to dine in their restaurant. If the service and ambiance (and cleanliness) match the quality of the food their producing then without question Bombay On The Lake will receive a much deserved 5th star from this well fed hombre!  Eatcrest Out"}
{"text":"This is our favourite indian spot in south Etobicoke. We've lived in brampton and mississauga and this is up there amongst our all time favourites. I can't comment on the meat dishes because we're vegetarians, but all the veg dishes we've tried are great. The decor leaves something to be desired but who cares?"}
{"text":"Great little find. The atmosphere is very quiet and relaxing with dim lighting and ambient Indian music. Food has been great. I get the paneer makhani, my boyfriend gets the butter chicken and we share onion fritters. Service is also great, very courteous and friendly."}
{"text":"Great samosas. The veggie appetizer platter was fantastic. We loved everything we ordered. Should have gotten two orders of naan! Will definitely return again."}
{"text":"Love this place. Lots of flavour and the right amount of heat in the spicy dishes.   Good for take out, delivery or dine in."}
{"text":"Sorry but this is probably the WORST Indian food I've ever tasted. I love Indian food and am Indian and this is really bad. Sadly there aren't many good Indian restaurants in South Etobicoke so this place attracts non Indians who perhaps might not know the difference."}
{"text":"I found three hairs in my food. The butter was not near as good as other places I've been too. The papadons we were not tasty at all. Vegetable pakora was very dry and not very tasty. Overall the food was very poor, would not order from this place again."}
{"text":"A cozy little Indian gem in Mimico. I love the fact that they use less ghee and as a result, I don't walk out feeling like crap after stuffing my face. The servers are pleasant and it always surprises me how fast my food comes out. You can't go wrong here, especially when their butter chicken lunch special is $8.99. WIN!"}
{"text":"Not much to say other than the food was really good and service was also excellent. I received a 10% discount for being a regular customer too. Value for the money, quantity or taste is not outstanding holding it back from a perfect score, but well recommended."}
{"text":"Nice place. Lunch menu too restrictive -- not enough opportunity to create custom plate. Aloo gobi was fine. Channa masala had great flavour! Papadums didn't taste fresh and needed more spice. Despite the very friendly treatment, overall it was just okay. I think I need to go back at dinner to get a proper experience."}
{"text":"Catered lunch. Fantastic job.  Great flavour and exactly what we asked for.  Awesome service!  Would totally order again :)"}
{"text":"Five dollar lunch special is appealing. Food is good, not great. Too much grisly chicken last time, not a good cut of meat. Butter chicken wound be the favourite."}
{"text":"Good food but idiot people They have a deal on fun clips Then when you come in they look at you like your an idiot And tell you that the deal has been used already I'm sorry but a coupon yes would be used multiple times because that is marketing DOnt you want multiple people,coming in and using YOUR coupon?"}
{"text":"We ordered from Skip The Dishes and tried the chicken samosas, butter chicken, mixed vegetables, rice and garlic naan. I must say... this is some of the best (if not, THE best) Indian food I've ever had! I particularly liked the chicken samosas because they were packed with chicken and came with two unique dipping sauces. Great quality food, we will be ordering from here again!"}
{"text":"I had been curious about this Indian restaurant while passing it repeatedly on our way to our favourite Thai place on the next block.  Unfortunately, it was a bit of a disappointment.  Decor tries to be cheerful but except for the porch in the front is rather too dark.  Chicken samosas were interesting, with ground chicken subbing for the potatoes.  The main dishes and sides were not all that special.  Chicken madras was not spicy enough.  Chicken kaddai (I guess we were in a fowl mood) was okay, though nothing to write home about.  Raita was too sweet and way too thin for our liking.  Rosemary naan had very little flavour of rosemary, and onion kulcha was a small portion with not a lot of filling.  Plain rice did not come with cumin seeds or cardamon, as in many Indian restaurants.  If you are in the area and have an absolute craving for Indian food, this place might be okay, but don't make a special trip there."}
{"text":"Went back to Bombay on the Lake after an 11 years break. Service was great, very attentive and courteous. The food was waaaay too mild, there is no heat at all. (Portions are on the smaller side too). We'll probably be back but I'll ask for a lot higher heat/spice level or I won't be able to taste anything.  I almost asked for hot sauce but stopped myself because I was worried it would offend the chef. Loved the beer though, Cheetah is very nice but the beer was lukewarm, needs to be cold. Decor hasn't changed in 11 years but that's not a big deal, prices are reasonable and a lot of vegetarian items to choose from. My kids were given free popsicles when we paid the bill, thank you :)"}
{"text":"This cute restaurant was our choice to celebrate Valentines Day. It was very quiet for dinner on the Sunday before Family Day. The service was perfect. The waiter was there when we needed him and invisible when we didn't.   The food was good. Above Par for Indian Food in Toronto.   We tried a new appetizer not yet on the menu. It was a vegetarian dish made with cauliflower and red, yellow and green peppers. The sauce was fantastic!  I little spicy for my dinner companion.   They are starting a lunch buffet in March. We plan to stop by one day to sample more items from their menu.   One issue with the meal was the butter chicken was light on the chicken. We gorges ourselves on the sauce and nan. We did not complain as there was plenty of food for the two of us.   I am happy to recommend."}
{"text":"The food arrived on time .. but was not good at all. Service was ok .. but I would not recommend this place at all ... especially for people like me who LOVE Indian food."}
{"text":"We get takeout from here at least monthly. Love their butter chicken. The owners are really nice too. It seems like a family business. I love supporting local business. Price is decent. It is the best indian food in Etobicoke for sure."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time today and it was excellent.  I placed an order for pickup through Just Eat, and the service and food were both fantastic.  The prices are a little higher than some other Indian food spots, but the quality of the food is definitely there.  They have incredible Saag Paneer, Samosas and Garlic Naan.  I definitely recommend this place - it won't let you down!"}
