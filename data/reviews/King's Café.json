{"text":"I finally went to King's Cafe after it was recommended to me by a lot of other people.  I had sampled some of their very delicious appetizers at the Vegetarian Food Fair last month, so I was excited to try an entree. Well... I had the Soy Fritters with Curry Rice, and I don't know if it was just the wrong dish to order or what, but I didn't think it was very good. Fried tofu gluten fritters with carrots, potatoes, beans and cauliflower sounded so yummy but it wasn't.  The only thing I really enjoyed the flavour of was the potatoes, because they seemed to have taken on the most of the curry flavour, the veggies and soy/gluten stuff weren't very flavourful. I needed some hot sauce for sure.  At least it was on the Special Order menu so it was only 5.99, some of the other items were 10-13.  They also wouldn't let me plug in my laptop and were generally kindof rude. so, eh. Not very enthused."}
{"text":"As a vegetarian, there is nothing more exciting than walking into a restaurant and knowing that you have an entire menu to choose from.  I'm not a huge fan of the Chinese style fake meat, but here I found that there was plenty to choose from that didn't have the fake meat, and the dishes were rich in fresh vegetables.  I had a selection of vegetarian dim sum,  the tofu fritters, and wonton soup, and it was all delicious.  The two ladies serving were really nice, and if you have kids, they are very accommodating (and it is also a nice, big, bright space).  They were quick to offer up high chairs, and there is a ramp!  Will return for sure."}
{"text":"I was lured in with the idea of an all vegetarian menu but after receiving the food this place is really nothing special. I've had way better food, and the decor and atmosphere didn't save it either. Meh."}
{"text":"Vegetarian food with real options for vegetarians! Huh! Everything we ordered was perfectly flavoured and seasoned. Fresh & tasty with prices that were just right.  The only thing I didn't enjoy was the Avocado shake. But my friend loved it, so I guess it's subjective."}
{"text":"I used to love King's Cafe back in my University days (long before the renovation). Back then I can't remember ever having eaten a meal there that didn't amaze and delight my taste buds.  Having just returned there after a seven year hiatus I fear that things have really gone downhill, but I'm hoping that it might have been an off night.  I order the tom yang vermicelli soup, a dish I usually love even when it isn't quite authentic or spicy enough.  The broth at King's was greasy and bland, and while I was anticipating tofu as described on the menu, there was also some mysterious soy-meat that I had not expected.  Worst of all, the mushrooms in the soup were nearly rotten! Spotted and slimy mushrooms are inexcusable and made it hard for me to continue with the meal.    However, since the food is served family style (which I like)  I did try a number of other dishes that my dining companions had ordered. The soy fritters were pretty good, if not a little too sweet but I was just grateful to have something to overpower the after-effects of the soup.  I can't remember the names of the rest of the orders but none of them were real stand-outs.  All six of us felt ill afterward and my partner even refused to eat the leftovers that he brought home --it's very rare for us ever to even have leftovers, let alone not eat them!   I may try them again to offer a chance for redemption but I will be steering clear of the soup!"}
{"text":"even though i'm not a vegetarian anymore (i was for 6 years) this is STILL one of my favorite restaurants. my non-veggie friends always enjoy it, even my friends conservative chinese meat loving parents who insist the fake meat is real cuz its so good!  my faves are the hand rolled sushi wraps, chicken nuggets (better than mcdonalds!), kung pao chicken, teriyaki mushroom cutlets and the dumplings."}
{"text":"The service can always leave you wanting, but the food is vegan perfection. I've been coming here for over 10 years, as I've never looked back.   Also, it an amazing place to bring picky/skeptical non-vegans. Oh how they will delight and rave!"}
{"text":"Best vegetarian I've had in this city when it comes to taste and price.  The food here is so wonderful my boyfriend didn't even realise the 'chicken nuggets' he was eating wasn't even real chicken - he loves them more than McNuggets. :)  I always get the bento box here, if you haven't been here before, i strongly suggest you do!"}
{"text":"A wide range of high quality tea selection, and extensive food menu, this place is a gem hidden in Kengsington Market.  Their combo meals offer excellent choices if you just want to have a quick meal."}
{"text":"Im not a vegetarian but this place was pretty good. I had spicy chicken (soy) with side of rice. Decent priced and definitely filling"}
{"text":"I guess Kings is a mecca for some people who like fake meat. But i was totally unimpressed with - the decor that does not go well with the character of the street, the food which tasted strange, and the service which was not very genuine. There are several cool places with character and flavour to taste fake non vegeterian in the city if you must have fake food."}
{"text":"I used to be a fan of this place when I was a new veggie. Now relatively seasoned, I hold a higher standard to customer service and food. And for this place, it's poor wait staff service was what drove me away.  Waited almost 30min. before I had to stand and wave down somebody to notice me... mind you, it's never *that* busy in there. They have one waitress who can't speak a lick of English. Kensington Market is home to more than just Asians, if I want to know something about the food, I shouldn't have to mime.  The dish I received was water-y and bland, and I couldn't even finish it, it was so bad.  Vegetarian Haven and Fresh may be pricier, but I'd rather spend my money there. At least the service and food & SERVICE is better in comparison.  Overall: wouldn't go back there if I was starving."}
{"text":"It's not the best vegetarian in the city. It can be overpriced and bland, BUT, the little takeaway area in the back makes up for any over priced, over cooked dumpling you might eat in the diner.  The soy drumsticks are my favourite! You buy them by the bag load and it works out to be like 20 cents each or something. Warm those suckers up in the microwave and instant afternoon snack.  They also sell a whole bunch of condiments and other frozen fun. And the prices on that stuff are great."}
{"text":"The most boring place ever. Slow inattentive service and very blah food. It's always quiet yet 3 servers will plod around doing next to nothing and never make eye contact so it's near impossible to get their attention.    Usually vegetarian restaurants have edible food but this place relies on processed soy products, the food is bland and I feel nauseous every time I finish eating there. Despite all of the choices listed on the menu, everything tastes the same. I've been there 5 times and the only reason is because some friend of mine will walk by and ask if we can go in, so I go along with it to be polite. After this last time, I won't return for anyone's sake.     It's a shame because it's a nice space and looks clean. I hate to add one more negative to it all, but the tables are very uncomfortable as they don't leave enough room to cross your legs under the table.  I seldom hate a place, but I'd go anywhere but here."}
{"text":"Best fake meat in the city.  Their soy fritters and drum sticks are addictive. Their sweet and sour balls must all be devoured.  This place is a treasure."}
{"text":"I had the kung-po soy fritters with steamed rice, my husband had bbq seitan and we also had veggie steam dumping.   Everything was flavourful but we were not like wow.  I will definitely be back because it's good to know that there is vegetarian Chinese food eat restaurant."}
{"text":"Randomly picked as we were happily meandering through Kensington park. Oh so lucky! The best asian vegetarian restaurant ever. Ihad sweet and sour burdock root even though I am indifferent to the sauce just try the burdock served on a bed of fresh spring greens in a bento box complete with purply rice, a potato carrot parsnip soup taro nuggets na a mini sprung rill. Friend's sush unparalleled: lightly breaded enoki with sea weed belt crunchy on outside musheoomy goodness o inside also a loose tea shop."}
{"text":"Love this place!  The food is so great. They sell combos where you get to try a varity of things like a soup, rice, salad, spring rolls, \"chicken nuggets\" and a main of your choice. It's a great deal. Another great thing is that there is a small market in the back where you can purchase the veggie meats that they cook with. The service is pretty good too."}
{"text":"Dumplings, soy fritters, and hot and sour soup were tasty - not a fan of \"meat\" substitutes so didn't try."}
{"text":"I've loved Kings for a long long time. It is one of my favorite go to comfort food establishments. I love their wonton soup, Kung Pao soy chicken and soy chicken with ginger sauce. But everything on the menu makes me happy! Service is always fantastic and subtle."}
{"text":"The food wasn't tasty, and pricey We had a bad stomach ache afterwards.  Would not recommend it."}
{"text":"A nice spacious restaurant, centrally located. However, we were a bit disappointed with the food. I got the vegetarian sushi combo, and my husband got the duck. It just wasn't very good."}
{"text":"King's Cafe is a little Asian fusion gem on Augusta. It's an all vegetarian menu with a small grocery area for vegetarian, Asian grocery. Prices are reasonable and the menu is huge, with so many different options the hardest part is choosing.  I had Special #1 which is a baked avocado stuffed with mach meat and real cheese. I don't usually heat avacado's but it was rich, creamy and delicious! My friend had rice cakes with mach beef rolled inside, a Chinese specialty and a bento box.   Tea is served with lunch. The place was really good, I'll go back for sure :)"}
{"text":"Decided to head to Kensington last night with no restaurant destination in mind. Quickly browsed the menu and decided it looked appealing. I had the Enoki Mushroom Balls and my friend had the Wonton Soup - both delicious.   The waitress was really friendly and said her favourite dish on the menu is Seitan so now I know what to order next time :) Don't be shy and ask this question of the wait staff at the next place you dine at. You most likely won't be disappointed, they know the menu better than you!  The food arrived at the table really quickly which always amazes me. I need a behind the scenes look at a kitchen to really understand just how the kitchen staff do that! And the amount of work that goes into creating tasty dishes is also mind blowing. We are so spoiled at how accessible and yummy food is. Let's take a moment to be thankful."}
{"text":"Pretty mediocre experience overall.  I've eaten in many \"fake meat Asian\" places before and this was the least impressive of them. The menu sounds promising, but the atmosphere, service, and food itself are all lacking.  Our selection: Won ton soup uses a mushroom mix to cleverly replace the won ton filling - not bad. Fried oyster mushroom bites have a strange firm-yet-crunchy texture that was off-putting. Purple fried rice with pine nuts is a mix of whole grain rice, fake ham, and pine nuts with surprisingly little flavour. Kung pow chicken... well, I didn't really even remember eating it. The baby corn and celery underneath were nice, though.  BBQ seitan sushi was the highlight of an otherwise bland meal.  Some qualms about the general ambience. Why are all the windows open when it's freezing (by Toronto standards) outside? Who are the random kids running around the restaurant? Who was the guy who walked in asking us for his water bottle? Why did the waitress roll her eyes and sigh when we ordered tea? Why was my friend barfy afterwards?  Sadly more questions than answers.  $60 for three people with leftovers."}
{"text":"This cafe is one of my favourites.  The food is delicious every time, and the variety of vegetarian dishes is stunning.  I have taken my meat-eating friends to this restaurant just so that they could see how diverse vegetarian food can be.  My favourite dishes are the teryaki mushroom stems and enoki mushrooms in seaweed.  The steamed dumplings are also very good, but they are quite traditional.  The cafe has been renovated recently, and, personally, I don't care for the new look at all, although some find it good.  I think that the old look had more personality, while the new decor is trying to present the restaurant as something it is not (and never will be).  Service is quite friendly, but can be very slow.  Make sure you have enough time when you go there.  A big regret is that you can't order a beer - they don't serve alcoholic beverages at King's Cafe.  You get a discount if you phone-in a take out and pay for it by cash."}
{"text":"PARADIS DES VÉGÉTARIENS.. Un peu moins pour les autres. Globalement un peu déçus. Plats qui manquaient de goût et de savoir. Les \"viandes végétariennes reconstituées\" nous ont pas vraiment plus mais opinion personnelle. Service agréable et grande salle ! S'il devait y avoir une prochaine fois, je pencherais plus sur un plat de noodles ou de riz !"}
{"text":"Let the record state i'd like to give this place a 4.5/5.  3 points:  1. Food - very delicious. I'd recommend getting a combo so you get to try quite a bit of variety. Some food highlights were the enoki mushroom balls, Seitan, Pan-fried dumplings, and soy beef.  some items i could have gone without were the chicken with ginger puree and the mock fish in tomato sauce.  2. Customer service - very attentive, A+ for them  3. Atmosphere - it was clean, spacious and not too loud.  Overall i'd come back again! Truly one of the best vegetarian restaurants i've been to."}
{"text":"Their Wonton Soup is magical. When I am sick it is the thing that nurses me back to health. Loaded with wontons, carrots, mushrooms and beancurd."}
{"text":"These guys have really good food for a great price!  Steamed Dumplings here are the best in Toronto  Also really enjoyed the hot and sour soup, nuggets, drumsticks, assorted seitan, and a few of their bento boxes, which comes with a starter soup. it's not called a bento box on the menu, but looks a lot like one  They even have a freezer section that features some of the products on the menu. Love this place, highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great place. Good is awesome with a wife variety so your sure to find something likable for everyone. The staff is super friendly and accommodating. The only bad points is that it's on the expensive side and it takes a bit of time for your order to come because everything is fresh and elaborately cooked."}
{"text":"This is my favourite Chinese food place in the world, I swear. I mean, it is really damn good. The seitan meat even tastes like actual meat. I've loved everything on the menu that I've had so far. There's cheap options and more expensive things. There are a few more Westernized options for people new to Chinese food, but they aren't embarrassingly Westernized -- usually just traditional ingredients thrown with a tamer sauce into a bread bowl/sandwich. The authentic stuff is the best though -- I love the chestnut and q-tofu stew, which is on the winter special menu, though for some reason that menu wasn't taken away all throughout summer. Not that I cared, of course -- after all, it is my favourite entrée here.  Wait staff is very nice. My usual waiter is a young kid with strange kool-aid dyed hair that seems to have been a reddish-brownish colour originally. He is unusually tolerant of the weird conversation my friends and I make, but shoots us kind of knowing glances every now and then like he's totally in on it.  They have a vegetarian food shop in the corner and the guy working the cash is awesome. He gives you very nicely-sized samples of the latest thing there and smiles a lot -- though not like he's trying to sell you something. He'll tell you all about whatever you're looking at, and indeed they have a lot of very interesting foods for sale at the little shop -- in addition to all of their most popular entrées in frozen form, WITH nutritional facts printed on the box. Good selection of teas.  There is also a bakery here. They top up your water very often, and with a slice of lime.  If you are going to eat here, try anything with \"q-tofu\". It's some brand of spongy firm tofu they supply here that I really haven't had anywhere else -- it soaks up sauces excellently and is very filling. They are generous with tofu and meat in their dishes, I should add."}
{"text":"Great place to celebrate Chinese New Year. They have certainly upped their game with their menu. Very tasty and very clean vegetarian food."}
{"text":"I had passed this restaurant a myriad of times while making my way towards other businesses in Kensington Market. In all those times I  never even took the time to look inside the window to get a sense of what the type of cuisine they served as suggested by the interiors. Therefore when a friend recently suggested we meet there for a late afternoon snack, I wasn't quite sure what to expect after she had attempted to describe it as vegetarian \"Asian Fusion\".   After I gave the menu a good scan, it occurred to me that perhaps my friend's \"Asian Fusion\" description was in reference to the many processed tofu / simulated meat products on offer. Not sure that's a valid connection, but I digress.  My friend had been looking forward to the Hot and Sour soup - it was after all a damp, rainy day. At the time I wasn't into ordering a full entree so I ordered some pan-friend dumplings. My friend also ordered the Kung Pao \"Chicken\" with the intention of trying some of it out and wrapping up the rest to enjoy at home.   The soup arrived and was your standard, thick and tasty Hot and Sour soup, which did not disappoint (I've had watery, near-flavourless ones in the past). The pan friend dumplings, though a tad oily on the outside, had a tasty filling and the accompanying dipping sauce was well-suited (not exactly sure what it could have been made of but it had a kind of tangyness and sweetness along with the usual soy sauce base). The Kung Pao chicken however was absolutely delicious - it was not coated in a mass-produced sweet sauce, there was some heat and other flavours abounded. The chicken chunks were simply to me deep fried pieces of  tofu, which were delightful and I personally prefer these to the processed simulated meat version. All of this was washed down with some lovely chrysanthemum tea.   It's rare that I am ever in the company of enough vegetarians and vegans to warrant seeking an exclusively vegetarian / vegan restaurant, but next time I am, I will definitely be heading back here."}
{"text":"Have meant to post a review of King's Cafe for a while. Whenever I want all-day vegetarian dim sum downtown, this is the place. I have tried their wonton soup, hot & sour soup, dumplings, greens, sui mai, mushroom balls, noodles--all very good. The faux shrimp dumplings--not to my liking, but I am not overly fond of fake meats. The sticky rice wrap was so delish, cooked in a lovely seasoning, and no pork! They also have a lovely selection of teas and you are given a glass of lemon water when you are seated. The service is also very respectful and the atmosphere is calming and casual. Nice when you've had too much frenetic Kensington Market energy. Overall a great choice for vegetarians and anyone who wants a relaxing Chinese meal."}
{"text":"One of the few places I enjoy the dishes with meat substitutes. Love the enoki mushroom balls. Service was pretty good as well."}
{"text":"The best place to get amazing Vegetarian Chinese food.  OMG the BBQ Seitan is amazing!!!  Great food.  Great service.  Lovely lovely people."}
{"text":"Very nice vegetarian restaurant with delicious food and nice services. We enjoyed the dinner very much and will likely go back again."}
{"text":"The earthiness and general grime of Kensington seep into the relatively sterile and plain-looking King's Cafe via complex metaphysical processes and ceiling to floor front windows, appropriately seasoning what could otherwise be considered a bland atmosphere. The music lightly pouring from the unobtrusive speaker system is reminiscent of other Asian restaurants, and stages from more obscure 2D fighting games where you're in a bamboo forest and some kind of pink or white petals are falling from the sky.  When you sit down and open the menu, look no further than 'Main Entrees-Kung Po Soy Fritters'. I live for this sh*t. Do you understand what I'm saying? I f***ing live for this sh*t. I want you to read that sentence again: I. f***ing. live. for this. sh*t. *slaps you in the face* I need you to comprehend this, 'Yelp'. Read it! --- I LIVE FOR THIS SH*T. *slaps even harder* AGAIN!---- I. LIVE. FOR THIS F***ING-- *kicks you in the nuts* I want you to right-click on this page- scroll down- select 'Print...'- take the necessary steps to make a high definition glossy print- cut out the sentence- and eat it so you can fully absorb the meaning... I. LIVE. FOR. THIS. MOTHER. F***ING. SH*T. Kung Po Soy Fritters.  It's a great selection of vegetables, and some amazing fake a** meat served up on a big a** plate with some bada** sauce and it's so good. So good. So good. So good. I've ordered that dish like 20 times, but honestly, everything on the menu is great. I've had probably 60% of it, and as far as I can tell you really can't go wrong, just different degrees of right. The ONLY thing that can be said about the palpable contrast between me and those remarking that the food here is just 'okay' or 'good' is that we have COMPLETELY different taste in food. The food here is great. It's healthy. It's vegetarian. It tastes BETTER than non-vegetarian restaurants. Pat my a** with a paddle covered in tattoo guns if that doesn't bring King's Cafe immediately to the higher ranks of the 'best food in TO' list.  \"...not bad...\" \"...no complaints...\" \"...generally good...\" --- what on earth are you people thinking?  Yeah, and Jesus Christ was a somewhat decent guy I guess, Adolf Hitler was marginally bad, and I won a 4.5 million dollar jackpot yesterday- it was mildly interesting. SMH. SMH at all of you. You should be ashamed of yourselves.  Most of the servers here seem to speak very little english, but they have that bashful politeness I believe is a cultural thing, so it's all good.  I guess you could say the King's speech here is ESL. Know what I'm saying? The place is great.  *slam dunks a basketball into a chain net to M.O.P's 'Ante Up,' spits on hand, turns around to look you up and down one last time, and diddy-bops off into the night*   ADDITIONAL NOTES: Okay I've thought about it some more and you might want to be aware of these things: -I like my veggies crunchy, they serve them crunchy. -I don't really like onions, and they don't seem to serve onions with anything (it is in the realm of possibility that they do and I actually have always asked for no onions by force of habit) -When I am aware a food is relatively good for me, it tends to amplify good tastes a little. -But the place is still objectively quite good."}
{"text":"we ate this sunday there. it was great. im a strict vegetarian and my husband is a meat eater but loves veggies as well. ok, so one by one what i liked... - the atmosphere. extremely, super relaxing, even invited u to meditate with the music they had.  - the variety of food, wow, it took us so long to decide, there were so many options, so many styles that it was very difficult to decide.  i had the fake chicken with mango, asparagus, ginger, carrots. when my order came let me tell u everyone around was looking over and asking the waitress what was that...because it was so colorful, the veggies were perfectly cooked, not too much, not too little. usually i dont like fake meats, but this one absolutely thumbs up, it was so tender and tasty. all my plate was a perfect blend of flavours without using any invasive spice.  my husband had the chicken thai and he was so happy with it.  - so much food we took some home.  - so healthy, not ur typical place were u settle for a veggie option but here u have a real delightful experience.  - we also had 2 spring rolls each - and a teapot of jazmine tea   all of this came to $43 (there are cheaper options, like combinations and menus, we decided we wanted something more elaborated, hence, the price)  the place is spacious, no one was rushing us, the waitresses were all so nice ready to answer any question.  is not just a place to eat, is a vegetarian experience to enjoy."}
{"text":"just so so. Food is tasteless. Especially pan fried radish pastry! Small soup is enough for two people. If you eat alone, order the XS one. Sao mai is no favor at all. the only taste good thing is fried chicken."}
{"text":"I haven't been to this place in ages - simple decor and clean - a decent place to bring your date.  Pumpkin with \"meat\" and coconut milk and a bean curd dish that tasted \"fishy\".  Both were good.  Food was well presented and tasty but portions you can get bigger at other Asian restaurants."}
{"text":"We went twice with friends, one is vegetarian, another is vegan.  It is a challenge to find a restaurant where there is a good selection of tasty, satisfying food.  This restaurant delivers on both counts. The soy fritters were tasty and not oily, despite being pan fried.  The spicy eggplant dish was great, spicy with a good selection of vegetables.  The vegetable curry was smooth and silky, if a bit bland.  The enoki mushroom balls had a bit of a strong taste which we assumed was due to the seafood, which most of us didn't care for. Service was friendly, a bit slow although the restaurant was busy both times with large tables."}
{"text":"Yummy vegetarian comfort foods, especially the soy fritters and drumsticks. I found their fried dishes to be great; everything else was meh, including the service which was very inattentive."}
{"text":"One of the best vegan restaurants in the city.    I liked their hot and sour soup, the bbq (vegan pork) buns, their curry puffs, their sticky rice (ask for some soy sauce - don't order this on it's own), radish pastry (good portion - filling - but good - just an appetizer - have it with soy sauce - don't order this on it's own)  I didn't care for the soy drum sticks, nor their dessert bars.   I should also mention that this place is spacious, so if you want to get out of the hustle and bustle of Kensington market, go here.  It's very clean.  Nice bathrooms.  You can even go there for just tea or a fresh juice like a carrot ginger apple or even just for a pop Prices are mixed, but market competitive.    It's nice to go to a cafe were you can get savoury treats, rather than sweet."}
{"text":"I ordered lunch using DoorDash. I got a teriyaki cutlet combo ($14) and a cranberry cheesecake ($3). The combo comes with soup, purple rice, salad, a spring roll, a few soy nuggets(?), and of course your main. It was really filling. I thought it would be small but I was so full before finishing half of the teriyaki cutlets. I was able to save some for lunch the next day.  The teriyaki cutlets had a great texture. They truly felt like meat and the sauce was great. Not sure what to make out of the soup though, it tasted pretty bland to me. The cheesecake wasn't bad. I was surprised at the texture. If you have this delivered during a summer day, it'll be really mushy so pop it in the fridge before eating.  Overall I'd go back here for vegan/vegatarian Chinese food. I've tried 2 vegan Chinese restaurants so far in Toronto, and this totally beats the other one."}
{"text":"Yuuuum. I'm not vegetarian, but do try to cut down on my meat eating ways every so often, and this is my go to place for a delicious vegetarian meal.   I do wish they had more gluten free meals (they are listed in the menu) but I guess you can't please everyone!  We've liked all the dishes we've had here, but my two favourite dishes here are:   - Soy-Fritters with Mango and Asparagus (description from web site: Fresh and delicious! Fresh mango and asparagus cooked with soy-fritters) - Enoki Mushroom Balls (description from web site: Enoki mushrooms wrapped in a seaweed sheets and stir-fried in a savoury sauce, served on a bed of vegetables)"}
{"text":"We came here for Mother's Day cause I was craving dim sum. Items we ordered are listed below with ratings.

Can't stop thinking about it"}
{"text":"Very good food. I had the following: crystal rolls, vegetable curry, spring rolls, veggie dumplings, veggie duck, hot sour soup, and sushi set. I especially loved the curry, hot sour soup and the spring roll. Their tea is best too. I had the jasmine green tea and it tasted really good. You can really taste the jasmine in it. Other brands, the jasmine flavour is very weak, almost washed out. I also love how they have section where you can buy the mock meat and teas. I bought some of their tea and the mutton and beef mock meats. The staff is very friendly and helpful too. I will definitely return, especially to buy their excellent products."}
{"text":"One of the very best vegetarian restos in Toronto, and my personal favourite, no question.  I often take my carnivorous friends and family there, and it never disappoints. We always order 'chinese style' and get several dishes for everyone to share, including a good mix of sweet and savoury/spicy flavours.  BEST: teriyaki mushroom cutlets...it's a bad description, so expect more of a rich asian BBQ taste, and the little cutlets (they're bite-sized) are more like meat than mushroom.  I also love to order a bunch of items from the dim sum part of the menu, like BBQ 'pork' steamed buns, little 'chicken' drumsticks, pan fried dumplings, and sticky rice stuffed with delicious, mysterious things and wrapped in banana leaf.  TIP:  if you want starters, YOU MUST ORDER THEM FIRST, and nothing else until they arrive at your table!!!!  if you order everything at once, I promise you, you WILL receive your food all at the same time, or the apps last.  Also, the vegan bacon available for purchase in the frozen section of the grocery area is to die for."}
{"text":"Good food, good prices, very nice people.  The vibe is very relaxed."}
{"text":"Simple vegetarian oriental plates in a spacious and comfortable setting emphasized by their large windows looking out at the cultured Augusta Avenue.  A specialty for both summer lunches and wintery blizzards is the $8 \"King's Wonton Noodle Soup\" - a hearty broth with deep green bok-choy, sliced mushroom, thin noodles and plenty of wonton.  Some things look wierd but it all tastes remarkable, and I go there not because I am a vegetarian."}
{"text":"One of the better Chinese vegetarian restaurants in Toronto. The food is pretty tasty on the whole, though be forewarned that the menu is a bit on the heavy side with its share of mock meat and deep-fried items. A big plus for King's Cafe is that it may be the only place where you can get vegetarian Dim Sum in the downtown core.   As for the ambiance, the decor is simple and the restaurant is roomy - I've enjoyed my visits to King's Cafe. The location is good as well, tucked away from the hustle and bustle of Dundas+Spadina. A bonus for me is a small supermarket in the back, which provides an opportunity to load up on a wide selection of vegetarian specialty items such as frozen dumplings, vegetarian pork buns, and fake meat products."}
{"text":"Great for the family!  We stumbled onto this place while walking around Kensington and it quickly became a highlight of the day.  My wife is the only vegetarian in our family, but we were all thrilled with our food.  The dumplings and soups (Hot & Sour; Udon) were all loaded with veggies and delicious.  My wife loved her curried rice.  And I was totally gaga over the spicy eggplant dish I ate with the combo meal.  The sauce was perfect - I didn't leave a drop of it behind.  If we had one in our hometown we would eat there every week!"}
{"text":"My favourite veggie/vegan restaurant. Be prepared to read a novel while you wait for the food to come. Although its not meat based, the spices that they use really made the food taste so flavourful. The bites were delicious, the cutlet chicken were delicious, you can almost never go wrong with any of the items.   It doesn't get too crowded and is able to accommodate large groups. Also perfect for a slow date. The staff there were friendly, which is always a plus."}
{"text":"I've found King's to have gone slowly downhill since I wrote my original review. Service is lacklustre, and the price of food just isn't worth it for the amount/quality anymore. And it seems like every time I go something new on the menu is handmarked that it now contains egg or milk products - has it always been this way and they're just now bothering to make the effort to reflect that in the menu? It's disappointing.   One thing that's still okay is their grocery section, but you still have to be vigilant in reading the ingredients on most of the frozen products for milk/egg products if you're vegan.  Overall I think they need to step up their game, be clearer with their ingredients/menu listings, and put a little care back into their dishes. What went wrong, King's? I miss your bentos!"}
{"text":"Expensive for what it is and I got food poisoning. There are other vegetarian mock meat restaurants in the area at a better price point with more variety. I've been to many others and never had food poisoning, I was actually really surprised.   I got the seitan 4 ways ($6.99) and the chicken in creamy special sauce ($13.99).  The dining area is nice and they are attentive with refilling your water but I don't want to risk getting sick again so I'm not coming back."}
{"text":"My favorites are hot & sour soup and steamed dumplings. This place satisfies all my needs: it is cheap, clean and quiet."}
{"text":"One of the best vegetarian restaurants in the city for their food and my favourite Chinese vegetarian restaurant so far.   It is a tiny bit more expensive than restaurants with similar menus but the difference is almost negligible and unlike most of them it's well decorated and spacious inside with consistent service (the service being good but not spectacular). In fact, it's probably one of the most spacious vegetarian restaurants I've ever been to which is a nice perk.   The dishes I've had are all subtly flavoured but delicious. I recommend the veggie duck and burdock balls. I can't recall the name but there's a noodle dish with black fungus and tofu that is also quite good.   Even my meat-eater friends enjoy their food there."}
{"text":"Came here twice with my boyfriend and I loved their  sweet 'n' sour bites (got it both times). It taste so close to real meet and the sauce is so good, I can taste the honey they use haha! The pineapple is sweet and the snow peas are great! If you're vegetarian/vegan and is craving for fake meat, this is definitely a place to go to:p However, it was sometimes hard to get the waitress' attention to get refill on the water and ask for the bill, but nonetheless the food is great!:)"}
{"text":"A lot of wonderful and diverse options... Service was exceptionally poor. Bbq seitan is delicious and very flavourful but much more oily than the standard. Enoki mushroom combination plate left a lot to be desired. Not very flavourful, no dressing on the salad, no dressing for the flavourless spring roll and decent chicken soy nugget.  Bbq bun was okay but again lacked the succulence you would expect. I'd come here again if someone wanted to go hut definitely was not worth the drive."}
{"text":"2.5* You could do worse than this Veg Chinese/ pan-asian place. This is not my cup-of-tea... I think seitan, tofu and mock meats are kind of the devil.  But it really works when you have a lot of vegetarian friends and you need a generally large space.  You'll notice that there are plenty of White male servers.   A little birdie tells me it's because the owners just hire the yellow-fever-boyfriends or ex-bf's of their daughters. So yeah... there hasn't really been a time here when I've encountered a White server and he wasn't scoping out all the Asian ladies in the room.  beware.  It might be good for people who are anti-meat, but it ain't good for people who are anti-fetish: http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=yellow+fever"}
{"text":"I always have such epic feasts at King's with a few friends, so the big tables are a plus. Definitely high in sodium and not the healthiest food but who cares? It tastes so good. Their hot & sour soup is so filling and satisfying, not to mention the soup bowls are enormous. The menu is just so big it can be overwhelming and some dishes are better than others but I love and appreciate the variety. 90% of the menu is vegan and is very clearly labeled (egg and dairy dishes are marked separately so if you have allergies you will be just fine). The restaurant is very spacious so its a pleasant experience even if its very busy. The service is so fast and very pleasant. I love the little shop inside as well. Some of my favourite dishes are the soy drumsticks, the BBQ duck, hot & sour soup, wonton soup, sweet & sour bites, Kung Pao Chicken, Lappa...the list goes on. Just steer clear of the Enoki Mushroom Bites (just take the damn things off the menu...surely nobody enjoys them) and you'll have a great meal."}
{"text":"Last night I went to dinner with a friend before salsa dancing in Richmond Hill. After checking out all the vegetarian options in Kensington Market, we settled on King's Cafe.  The ambiance was peaceful with soft melodic music in the background. The interior was dim, spacious, and clean, but a tad boring. The menu was detailed, clear, and concise. Everything on the menu was vegan friendly, except for the ones that contains milk ingredients and eggs -but they're clearly marked for you, so there's no room for ordering something that's vegetarian, opposed to vegan. It look me awhile to figure out what I wanted for dinner because mostly everything was vegan and everything looked good.... I never thought there would be a downside to having too many options.  After a long time, I finally decided on the curry vermicelli -singapore style with faux meat. My friend ordered a veggie fried rice with faux ham and we shared an appetizer: soy fried fritters.  The fritters, accompanied by fried bell peppers, were fried, salty, but tasty and had a good texture. My vermicelli was yummy, light tasting, spicy (extra hot was tolerable), and very satisfying -I wish it had more veggies and had more sauce, but it was still good. My friend's fried rice was ok, the faux ham was interesting.  Overall, I really enjoyed this place and I look forward to coming back to try all the other vegan items on the menu!"}
{"text":"I've been going to King's Cafe for many years now. They have the best \"chicken\" nuggets I've ever had, even better than real chicken. It's always a pleasure to buy bulk frozen foods from Meibou at the back. If you're interested in storytelling, ask Elsa for a tea ceremony."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a Saturday, the restaurant wasn't very busy, so I was seated quickly and brought water. If you get the chance go, this place has great food, affordable prices & in large quantities. We got the Tom Yum soup in a small (still very large) it was amazing, veggie dumplings (loved them), sao mai (probably my least favorite dish), soy nuggets (deliciously crispy with the perfect sauce accompanying it), wonton soup (great), BBQ seitan (best dish of the meal) and the sweet and sour bites (good) and some tea to accompany all of it. Our eyes were definitely bigger than our stomachs but we don't regret it! The food was all so incredible, my boyfriend who eats meat loves the BBQ sriram. Although we were both full we still ate everything. I look forward to coming back here! Service was a bit unfriendly, however they were efficient and the quality of the food definitely made up for it. We look forward to coming back here as I have been raving about this place, vegans, vegetarians and omnivores, the food is truly quality and you won't leave disappointed!  They also accept TVA cards here as well so we got a 10% discount. We were pleasantly surprised by the price (especially considering the amount of food we ordered). I cannot be happier with this place!"}
{"text":"Even though part of the Zen Garden chain, I found this location wasn't as good as the Mississauga location.    While the majority of the food was tasty, especially the enoki mushrooms, crispy soy fritters and mock shrimp dumpling, I found the service to be a bit lacking.    The waitresses were very nice and very accommodating in splitting bills, which sometimes doesn't happen at Chinese restaurants, so that was greatly appreciated.    So for food/wait staff - I'd give it a 4/5.  However, I need to take it down by 0.5 star because the entrees came out very sporadically.  Out of 7 entrees we ordered, I think it took 45 minutes from the first to last dish, which is way too long.   I also have to take it down by another 0.5 star because it is 4.99 for a pot of tea and they don't refill it. For that price, it should be refilled.  Verdict: not bad, but doesn't compare to Mississauga location as that one is more serene and has better service."}
{"text":"Pretty good! I was happy with my Kung Po chicken and especially enjoyed the purple rice. The salad with my meal seemed to be a bit of an afterthought, but was sufficient. Service was quick but a little bit sour."}
{"text":"I love King's Cafe. It's easily my favourite asian chain in Ontario. They're known as Zen Gardens outside of Toronto.  I've been enjoying meals at King's through it's various incarnations - anyone remember the huge photo menu the size of a phone book from a decade ago? It only gets better. The menu is much smaller these days but all the best menu items are still there.  The vegetarian dim sum steam BBQ bun is my absolute favourite item. I got hooked on them at the Vegetarian Food Fest a few years back and now I buy frozen from their shop so I can eat them at home. The spring rolls are also pretty good for heat at home.  The purple rice that accompanies most dishes is great here and if you're looking for a warm up on a cold winter night, their soups are excellent. Get a blooming tea to add to the experience.  Just an FYI that not everything is vegan, so be sure to ask if you're ordering anything prepared or with faux meats."}
{"text":"Best bean curd ever. I ate here three years ago and still have dreams about their food. Stopped in this weekend and it's still top notch. Their grocery supply (red bean steamed buns) is a must stop for vegans!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at a vegetarian restaurant.  The decor is simplistic and clean. The menu is quite varied with all sorts of \"weird\" dishes.    I ordered the mango sushi rolls.  They were alright, but missing something. Maybe I am too much of a meatatarian to truly enjoy it, but our vegetarian friend thinks this place is great.  3 stars because I think the menu is a little too expensive. 8.99 for a mango roll with no meat :(.. I can get the same elsewhere for 4.99 at other restaurants.   Nevertheless, if you are looking for a clean and vegetarian place in Kensington market, you should check it out."}
{"text":"This place is like walking through the desert and stumbling upon an oasis! An oasis of ALL VEGETARIAN CHINESE FOOD!!! I have never in my life thought the day would come when I could pig out on everything I would see my meat eating friends eat at regular dimsum while I noshed on noodles.  Now I got to taste it all! Veggie duck with plum sauce on a bed of taro and Bok Choi?!!!! OUT OF THIS WORLD DELICIOUS - it's the crispy outer texture of the \"duck\" with the sauce that nails it for me. Steamed veggie dumplings piled high, stir fried rice, steamed bbq buns and cabbage buns, noodles with curry and \"beef\" and hot and sour soup too!!!  Everything is served in generous portions which is a bonus :))"}
{"text":"Came here for late lunch with a friend on Saturday afternoon. We were starving and quickly decided to drop in because we saw that the restaurant was vegetarian.  The restaurant is big but quite dead. I don't know why there were only 2-3 other customers in the restaurant. I was confused with the white decor and tear drop shapes on the wall too.  We were quickly served with small glasses of water with a lemon slice. Because there was no menu outside the restaurant (-1 point!), I didn't realize it was a chinese restaurant. I didn't really want anything on the menu, but since I was starving, I settled for sushi. My friend and I shared the mango sushi (8 pcs, 9.99) and the wunagi temaki ($3.50).  The food arrive relatively quickly.  The wunagi was a small seaweed cone (the menu says it's crispy, but it's actually not anymore) with rice, lettuce and a thin strip of fried bean curd. The menu also says that there is cucumber and crispy bean-curd crumbs inside, but there wasn't...  I'm only impressed with the fried bean-curd. I never had anything like it before; it looks like toast on the outside and perhaps the ridges make it look like ham, but inside was like chewing on dry chicken cutlet. I quite like it. It's crispy and not oily.   Quite disappointed in the Mango sushi; I was unimpressed with the food presentation. Frankly, I was confused by the way they were stacked (see pic). Anyway, I tried it and it was nothing special, just mango wrapped in rice and seaweed. For 10 bucks, you can get a better deal, same quality sushi at T&T. I was also displeased that some of the pieces were the ends -- you're never supposed to serve customers the ends of anything.  (-1 point for not having a menu outside the restaurant) (-2 food presentation and accuracy) (-1 ambiance)  Not my kind of place to rave about."}
{"text":"Incredible vegetarian food! Everything here is delicious and reasonably priced, the servers are all very nice.   I especially recommend the spicy chicken, fried rice, and sweet and sour chicken. All amazing! Such a treat to be able to eat all my old Chinese favourites."}
{"text":"The food is not spectacular, u can find food like that anywhere in scarborough or in chinatown for a much cheaper price. the only difference is that this place is entirely vegetarian so for the asian meat dishes, they substitute with mock meat. the price is a bit high for food thats not organic."}
{"text":"I'm on the fence. We ordered the Enoki mushroom balls (main entrée) and a Udon noodle soup (Soups).    The enokie mushroom balls are enoki mushrooms wrapped in a seaweed sheets and stir-fried in a savoury sauce, served on a bed of vegetables. Very delicious but also very expensive for a small mushroom dish.   The soup was udon noodle, simmered in an vegetable broth with fried tofu, mushrooms, broccoli, crispy soy fritters, carrots and vegetables. Not very delicious and again a bit expensive for the size of the dish.  I've noticed other vegetarian restaurants and establishments have a tendency to be more expensive which is unfortunate. With that said, I think I am still willing to give them one more try.  Cheers"}
{"text":"Found them showcasing their food at Vegetarian Food Festival a few years back. Their food is always delicious and very authentic. Dumplings are the best vegetarian kind I have ever tried and are a \"must try\" on the menu as well as vegetarian \"shrimp\"."}
{"text":"Ambiance: Very quiet (I came in at around 5) and very spacious. The interior designing is something that is atypical of the interior designs of most restaurants in Kensington - it's very \"modern Chinese\", something that is more typical in restaurants up in the suburbs.   Cleanliness: Table tops could have been cleaner - there were left over rings from previous customers' glasses.  Service: Very friendly and accommodating.  Food: I ordered the rice noodles with soy beef. The noodles were not greasy (which is a good thing considering how lots of Chinese restaurants tend to serve greasy rice noodles) and the \"beef\" tasted really good! The texture and appearance was very similar to beef. Taste-wise, the \"beef\" tasted like a mix between soy and actual beef - basically a less flavourful beef. I for one, liked the imitation beef and rice noodle combination. I wish they provided more beef with the rice noodles though :/ Pricing was pretty fair - for about $8.50, you get a generous portion of noodles with various toppings and tasty imitation beef."}
{"text":"One of my favourite restaurants in town (I'm vegetarian.) Love the enoki mushoom balls!"}
{"text":"Enroute to Urban Herbivore on a Wednesday night (and realizing that it closes \"at sunset....despite the fact that the sun set at about 9:30PM and I arrived at about 8:20PM), I discovered King's Cafe.  It was late-ish so not that many patrons were inside, but nonetheless, I dragged my reluctant carnivore Fiance into this place.   First impression -- gee, it sure feels like a Western Chinese restaurant ala one-off cafe,Vancouver-style.   We get seated and I cozy up to a menu and find out that King's Cafe has its own factory and several other cafes spread out across Toronto/GTA (sorry, I'm still new here so I don't quite know how to refer to the rest of this city!).  Majorly craving something sweet and sour, I ordered an appy starter plate of seitan, asking the waitress if she could give me more of the sweet and sour than the curry variety (it comes with a selection of four flavours). I kid you not, it took a full seven minutes for the waitress to even somewhat understand what I was trying to say. And no, it wasn't me -- English is definitely not her second language.   So I gave up and proceeded to order siu mai (appy), a dish of sweet and sour \"chicken\" and my fiance ordered a bento box (with the kung po \"chicken\").  Food arrives....no, not the appies but my sweet and sour chicken and the bento box. Ten minutes later, the appies arrive.  My only knock against creative vegetarian food (and this place is creative - there are sooo many dishes of \"seafood\" and \"meat\" to choose from) is that, most of the stuff is deep-fried and super processed.   My sweet and sour \"chicken\" was good. Deep fried, airy pieces of seitan with not-fake-red-looking sweet and sour sauce....really skimped a tad on the veggies.   The bento box was interesting. The kung po \"chicken\" was really good, it's all about the sauce and fixins sometimes. The best thing about my experience here was the (at first, to me) three mysterious little nuggets accompanying the spring roll.   Seriously, I bit into it, it tasted like chicken, it looked like chicken and  it *felt* like chicken (in my mouth, that is). But it wasn't chicken! I was so impressed, I pulled our waitress aside to ask her what it was made of. And she had a look of terror in her eyes and immediately sent the manager over (possibly the owner).  Unsure of what type of meat it was, I asked her if this was vegetarian chicken.  \"Yes, yes it is,\" she replied wearily and continued, \"do not worry, we do not serve meat here, it is real vegetarian chicken, all seitan.\"  \"Oh! I'm not worried! I was just really impressed that it tastes just like meat! So it's chicken?\"  Manager/owner nods and points to the back of the restaurant where a little shop was tucked away.  \"You can buy these chicken nuggets in the store,\" she informed me.  I was astonished. A store in the very back! I got up from my seat to poke around the store and found freezers full of all the stuff they served in the restaurant including an impressive wall of various loose teas. A huge bag of the chicken nuggets go for $20.   Anyhoo. Would I go back? Probably not, unless I'm in the area again and Urban Herbivore is closed and all the other places are as well.   Not that it sucked or anything, but this city is so huge that I'd rather spend my money at another veggie resto that I haven't been to just so that I can write more reviews and boast about how many people actually read them.   =)"}
{"text":"I don't want to totally knock the place but I ordered the Enoki Mushroom Balls and when a plate of fried to a crisp \"somethings\" showed up at the table I was a little surprised. I really think fried should be mentioned on the menu because outside of that I thought I was ordering a healthy and wheat-free dish!   My friend asked if the batter for frying was wheat based and the server said they can't give away their secrets! Trust me, I don't want to make it!!! I ate it anyway and spent  days...umm...not well!   maybe I need to try something else but it won't be me suggesting to go!"}
{"text":"Ten years ago, King's Cafe would have gotten a ten star review from me, we're that possible. Now it seems pretty mainstream among the other restaurants they own/in the franchise. The menu is exactly the same as the menu for Zen Garden in London ON. It was nice to have something similar with a slightly different menu.   These days through, King's Cafe seems to have lost its charm. While we were welcomed immediately and told to sit anywhere, it took a while to be brought water, and have our order taken. Once we did order, most of our food came out rather quickly from the kitchen and the food quality is decent. I feel like it used to be better though, all around.   The meal combinations are lovely and come in a be to box with purple rice, soy nuggets, a spring roll, a salad and your main dish, I think it's the best value for money unless you come with a group and share a variety of dishes."}
{"text":"I like this restaurant, lots of options of different \"meats\"  One of my favs are the bbq pork buns. I have tried a lot of items in the menu that I like and also a few that I don't like at all...  The've a large selection of teas which is nice however no alcohol."}
{"text":"After a cold night wandering the streets of Kensington market for their Winter Solstice Festival, this was one of the few places open later in the night.  We just wanted something hot and quick and were ready to chow down    We had no idea it was a vegetarian restaurant until we sat down...and then the confusion came in when we saw meat dishes on the menu.  Huh?!  Ohhh...mock meat dishes.  We ordered the shrimp dumplings (not particularly impressed...had a gummy like texture) the spring rolls which weren't bad, the vegetable fried rice (this was pretty interesting and unlike any other veggie fried rice I have had - more emphasis on the veggies and less on the fried!) and the crispy \"duck\" with the plum sauce.  I tried a few pieces and well....it's not duck.  I am not sure why a vegetarian place makes fake meat.  If people want vegetarian food, why make something that tastes like meat???  The service was pretty fast and the servers were all nice.  I wish I had read the reviews of this place before ordering so as it seems the crispy so fritters are a hit.  So maybe next time I am up this way I will come in here for that just to see what the fuss is about."}
{"text":"It's not that I don't like King's Café; if you're looking for vegetarian and vegan food Canadian Chinese/Asian food, the food is okay.  It's just, the food isn't GREAT and I don't think the prices are either.  I've been to King's a few times, usually at a friend's request.  I'll always abide, but am never impressed.  I think King's Café is a great place to bring meat eaters who are sceptical about vegetarian or vegan food. But I'm not.  I like meat substitutes, vegetables, tofu, seitan and other yummy foods.    I am okay with fake meat, when done right such as at Chu Chai in Montreal.  The fake meat at King's doesn't compare.  It tastes like the fake meat I buy in Chinatown for $2 a can.   I want to eat something I can't necessarily make myself.  Most of the food at King's Café I can make.  Which is totally great, but not for me."}
{"text":"The food isn't bad but it's expensive to get to the point where you're full.  I like veg fare but this isn't somewhere I'd ever *try* to go back."}
{"text":"The service was TERRIBLE.  After our friends waited 45 minutes for food, we asked the staff if it was still coming. They seemed so confused we had to repeat the question several times before they finally assured us it was on the way. Another twenty minutes passed and, when asked again, they denied any knowledge of us having placed an order in the first place.  A pan handler came in and started to harass our table, and refused to leave. After five minutes we asked the staff to help us out but they just stood there, watched, and wouldn't respond.   I ordered a pot of high quality oolong. A small pot arrived with no leaves in it, and the water had clearly been poured at boiling point, spoiling the flavour of the tea. For $5 I expect the leaves to be left in the pot so I can add more water, especially for oolong.   For a pot of nice tea I will go around the corner to Samadhi Tea House on Baldwin."}
{"text":"Ok, but doesn't compare to its London Zen Gardens counterpart, which is smaller but has nicer ambience, better service, better food and lower prices.   Has a few new/different dishes - really enjoyed the veggie duck with plum sauce! Was disappointed in my combo, which had a rather sparse and sad salad lacking in fruit, and a distasteful miso soup. The enoki mushroom balls were a tad greasier and saltier than I remember, but I'll excuse that as a variable. Lackluster, although nice, service.   The major redeeming factor is the frozen market to the side - fantastic!  Enjoyed the added menu options; despite being downtown, didn't enjoy the added cost."}
{"text":"I've had the pleasure of dining at this vegan restaurant on many occasions over the past couple years.  You'll be hard-pressed to find a better vegan dim sum option in Toronto.  The Teriyaki Mushroom Cutlets are my absolute favourite item on their menu.  To the point where I'll be passing by and stop-in just for this dish alone.  Granted I always order with my eyes and get far more items then my stomach can handle.  The only thing I would confirm before making your way to this Kensington gem is that sometimes the restaurant hours aren't what you might expect.  So call ahead to be sure they are open.    Happy dining!"}
{"text":"I've loved this place for many years. The food is always consistently good (love the kung pao soy chicken!). One of my favourite tried and true veg restaurants in the city."}
{"text":"I enjoyed visiting Kings Cafe. I'd say the food I had was good, not great, but I want to go back and try some more dishes.   To be fair, we did it wrong, everyone ordered their own, instead of us ordering a variety of things and mixing and matching (there is a lazy Susan in the middle of every table).   The menu is nice in that vegan is the default. Items with egg or dairy are marked.   I had:  - Hot and sour soup. Very nice.  - Spring rolls. Standard tasty.  - Crispy soy fritters. Ok. I could eat them again.  - Kung po chicken. I don't normally go for the mock meats, but I wanted to try it. I also ordered a steamed rice to go with it. It was ok, but too much chicken for a single meal.  It wasn't spicy.   Service was good. Pricing is good too.   Definitely want to go back to try the dim sum and some of the other dishes.  I'd give it 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Pros: great service, great vegetarian food Cons: none  This is my favourite vegetarian restaurant! They have a great selection at a decent pricing.   Hot and Sour Soup: 10/10. It's just the right amount of hot and just the right amount of sour. Comes with lots of vegetables too.   Sweet N Sour Bites: 10/10.  These were breaded balls with the perfect amount of saucing and vegetables.  Rice noodles with soy-beef: 8/10. Not sure if it's how the dish is supposed to be but this was a bit too oily for my preferences. It also came with way too many bean sprouts which I'm not a fan of."}
{"text":"What on earth are people thinking with this place?  I'm not vegetarian, but I am very open minded to good vegetarian food.  I went here last weekend.    This place is very clean inside (they sell tea or something on the side of the store?).  Service is reasonable.    But the food.....  Tasteless, terrible, tofu, tofu?  It's quite expensive for what it is.  I ordered dumplings which were virtually tasteless.  And a dish with vegetables and pineapple and a sort of tofu in it.  The tofu looked bright pink, and had the sort of texture of \"spam\" (that processed meat in a tin).  THis is one of the worst dining experiences, in terms of food, I've had in Toronto.  Why on earth do people go here?    Everything is fake tofu, the fake fish etc everything, but it all has an unpleasant texture for me.  But the soups....  so bland.  I would not go back.  If you want to go here, go if you like tofu that tastes and looks very 'funny'.  The waitresses on sunday nights at least all appear to be very serious middle aged women.  It's a rather sterile place."}
{"text":"oh-so-glad I found you! it was a chilly and windy sunday afternoon but the minute i sunk my teeth into your dumplings I knew the drive, then the hop on my broken ankle and freezing walk was worth it!  The ambience is really serene and peaceful what surprized me was the lack of clientelle around noon but I guess maybe since it was a sunday? in either case I'd sampled some of their fare @ Toronto Veg food fair this past summer and decided to check out the full menu.  Our order included dumplings, buns, kung pao soy chicken, and soy chicken skewers. My only wish was the skewers were grilled instead of being fried, but oh well it was tasty regardless.  I definitely plan on repeating this again - especially the kung pao part! must visit."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic, especially the spicy chicken nuggets!  We got a little too much food, but definitely am not complaining.  The dumplings (steamed) were really good - for restaurant standards and it was great to be able to share dim sum dishes that are usually not vegan/vegetarian.  It is slightly pricier compared to other restaurants' with similar dishes in my opinion, but it was certainly worth it.  Will most definitely return!"}
{"text":"This is a wonderful place we keep coming back to. If you're into vegetarian food, basically, you can order anything off the menu, and you won't be disappointed. I've added photos of what we had to the photos section:  - The hot & sour soup is excellent, with enoki mushrooms. \"Small\" size is great for two people, unless you're making a meal of it.  - The enoki mushroom balls were wonderful, served on a bed of steamed spinach, with a sweet sauce based on soy. Yum!  - The soy drumsticks proved to be an excellent appetizer. Great texture, and very nice sauce to go with them.  - King's cafe is also a teahouse, with some excellent selections. Today we had \"osmanthus fragrant dancong\" tea ... quality oolong tea with strong peach/apricot accents. Better alone, I think, than with a meal, but it was great nonetheless.  Overall, highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Went back yesterday and was equally delicious. This time we had the fried bean curd with veggies (my all time favourite!), soy ham fried rice, crystal rolls and wonton soup. Staff were equally friendly and attentive. It is quickly becoming one of my favourite places again!"}
{"text":"I didn't realize this was a Chinese vegetarian restaurant the first time I walked by and thought, \"hmm, I'd like to check it out.\" When I came in, I saw that there were some monks eating in there as well. And then I was really surprised at how extensive the menu was! There were plenty of appetizers as well as plenty of main dishes as well.  Let me start by saying: get the soy fritters! It was amazing! So was the spicy eggplant dish!! We got a lot of different things, and so maybe by the time we tried the sao mai and the veggie shrimp dumplings (it's veggetarian, no shrimps), I didn't think much about them. But overall, it is very good and worth checking out."}
{"text":"This veggie gem deserves four stars. The food is excellently prepared, the tea selection solid, and the staff friendly and helpful. The decor is also simple and tasteful, with a wide-open feel and broad street view. This is a classy place to enjoy some outstanding fake chicken. Plus, they sell fake meats and teas in one corner, and I'd be in there all the time if I lived in Toronto, picking up nuggets and tuna steaks with glee."}
{"text":"Great menu, love the BBQ Seitan especially, my horribly picky children love it as well, they have at least 6 different fav menu items, which is rare in our family.  The service is always fast and pleasant, love their little retail shop."}
{"text":"Always delicious reasonably priced. Carnivores do not pass kings cafe up plenty of dishes you won't miss the meat in. Sushi is always fresh but not a lot of variety sushi rolls Unfortunately. They have the very best vegetable tempura I've had in the city just delicious!"}
{"text":"I love the food from this place.  It's a go to for me in the market.  I only wish the ambience were a little bit softer; it kind of feels like a cafeteria...  But worth it for the food."}
{"text":"Amazing food!! I never thought vegetarian food can actual taste better than meat dishes, and I love any food with meat! My boyfriend and I love the avocado fried rice and the spicy szechuan tofu."}
{"text":"King's Cafe has been a staple in Kensington Market, and I visited recently after their long-awaited re-opening.  The interior is beautifully done, and very chic now.  My partner and I shared a lunch combination for $14 which, after you choose the main entree (e.g. coconut curried vegetables and 'meat' ), is complimented with a salad with fruit dressing, two soy nuggets, one spring roll and purple rice.  The gluten plate isn't bad either, but I eat enough of it as a vegetarian that I don't see why I should pay so much more at King's.  For Asian cuisine, it's considered pricey for the amount of food you get.  However, the cooks here take care to craft their food and present it in a mouth-watering manner.   Fantastic food but crappy prices."}
{"text":"Long overdue! I came here during my school's reading week. I had no intention of actually coming here; I was stumbling around checking out Kensington's Market. I got super hungry and noticed this place right across the street! There was a pair sitting close to the window eating, so my vegan friend and I decided to check it out. I'm so glad we did!  We walked in and there were only two tables being occupied. We chose to sit in the front because no lights were on at the time, and I did not want to sit in the dark. No matter! I like to conserve energy when possible, and so the natural sunlight was nice. I quickly used the huge single stall washroom (very clean by the way), and went back to take my seat. I ordered the Enoki Mushroom Balls Bento. I'm not sure what my friend ordered! I was too excited for my (favourite) mushrooms!   They served us a small bowl of soup first, which wasn't too salty. I enjoyed it. Then our Bento boxes came! My Enoki Mushroom Balls were more like small little wrapped up cylinders - wrapped by spinach and deep fried. It was lightly drizzled by some (what I believe to be plum) sauce. It had the perfect amount of crunch to it! The steamed vegetables were a nice addition, and I also got a handful of rice. Overall, very good food.   The interior is clean, and you could see what it is like to be located in Kensington Market with spraypaint on the side window of the building. Visitors were walking by and taking pictures of King's Cafe without coming inside. Two men were shouting outside and asking people loudly if they had any spare change. It felt I was watching a dystopian show sitting at the front of the restaurant.   Service wise, there was only one server at the time. She was tall and had short hair. She was very attentive to everyone's needs. I recommend giving this place a try if you are vegetarian/vegan! I may or may not come back due to the location being inside the maze of Kensington."}
{"text":"Last week, I was lucky to spend a few days in Toronto and experience some of what this exciting city has to offer.  King's Cafe is located in the Kensington Market area of downtown Toronto and serves vegetarian Chinese food. King's Cafe is located right by China Town but King's Cafe offers a few things that the vegetarian options that China Town does not: better atmosphere and fake meat!  Unfortunately, not everything at King's Cafe is vegan. They do alert you to which items are not vegan and it's good that mostly everything is vegan. There is also a small store inside of the restaurant where locals can buy fake meats and more.  The service at King's Cafe is fantastic! The servers were very attentive and the food was served at a great pace. I needed my water filled a multiple times and it was filled before I even needed to ask. And now, onto the food!  The Udon Noodles Soup was very delicious. The broth had a great flavor that paired nicely with the vegetables in the soup. I was excited to see taro in the soup and the pork was very good. At $7.99 CAD, I think it's a great price for a large bowl of soup for two to share.  This BBQ Chicken was probably my favorite entree on my trip to Toronto. The faux chicken has a great texture and the sauce was very good. The sauce is more like a modified general tso's sauce than a traditional bbq sauce. This entree was $8.99 CAD and was very good!  I really enjoy rice noodles, but as you can probably see from this picture, there were way too many bean sprouts! These noodles would have been perfect if there were a little less bean spouts. The flavor was great and the beef tastes wonderful. I'm not sure if they had ran out of noodles or what the issue was, but I would order this again if there weren't so many sprouts.  Conclusion:  There aren't many amazing vegan restaurants in Toronto, but King's Cafe stands out from the few that are available. Kensington Market can be a bit awkward for a first timer with a hippy/stoner feel to the area, but King's Cafe serves a better atmosphere than many of the restaurants in the area. The food is very affordable and very tasty. The service is very attentive and food is prepared quickly!"}
{"text":"I was exploring Kensington market today, and got caught in the middle of the sudden snowstorm that hit the city. Tired from rummaging through the vintage inside Cuties, Courage My Love, and other gems, I was looking for a place to feed my appetite for healthy food (since that seems to be in line with the general conscious citizenry promoting lifestyle that this neighbourhood seems to have going on).   While I'm not a strict vegetarian(I don't eat meat, but do eat fish, and other seafood), I'd say 80% of my diet is vegetarian. This is also a result of being of Indian ethnicity. Anyhoo, these are the factors that led me to King's Cafe. The large windows that provided a view into the restaurant also helped. The interior is highly minimalistic, and clean.   I walked in, and asked the waitress for a recommendation. She suggested the Kung Pao \"Chicken\" Combination (it comes with a soup, red rice, salad, Spring roll and soy nuggets, and of course, the main dish itself). I also ordered the shrimp dumplings.   The shrimp dumplings were disgusting. I could not eat them. They were tasteless, bland. One bite was enough.  After the soup arrived, I was surprised to discover that  it was basically water with bits and pieces of soy protein, and a few veggies. Meh. Since I had emerged out of the cold weather outside, this soup satisfied me. However, I certainly wasn't thrilled with it.  Finally the main combination dish arrived in a bento box. The red rice was bland. The soy nuggets were delicious, and the spring roll was fine. The salad was very good. The \"chicken\" was really just not my thing. I've had fake meat before; in fact, I purchase it regularly from the grocery store in frozen form. Yves, Zoglos, etc . The sauce the kung pao is cooked in is really good, and has lots of flavour, but it is not spicy enough. But the fake meat was a surprise to my palette, and just very unpleasant to bite into.   The portions were good. I didn't finish everything, and had to get most of it to go.   Let me be clear: this is a fine restaurant, with excellent service, and high quality healthy ingredients. You will leave this place satiated, and feeling good about yourself (as one does after eating a salad). The only problem is that the taste is not going to leave you ecstatic, especially for the price. However, I guess this is the price to pay for eating healthy food. Also, check other reviews to find recommendations of dishes that are better than the Kung Pao Chicken."}
{"text":"I'm by no means a vegetarian, but let's just say that, if I was ever being told that I would have vegetarian food for a meal, I'd be ecstatic.    I didn't even get recommended to this place, I was just walking in Kensington with a friend and I just saw the vegetable (pretty empty), my friend said we shouldn't go because there weren't many people, so the food must not be good.  I refuted, and told her that I will judge the food, when I actually taste it. So we went.  And a good decision was made after all. :)  Let me just say this, the decor in the restaurant is gorgeous.  It's contemporary and perhaps while not by any means a unique decor, the inside, with the open patio is just inviting.  The owner was on the outside and lamented to me that their outside menu display was sadly vandalized...so he handed us a menu when we were hanging on the outside of the restaurant.    So we go in, order the following: soy chicken drumsticks, chow mein with soy sauce and stir-fried mix vegetables.  The food was just so yummy, especially the soy chicken drumsticks and the chow mein with soy sauce.  They're essentially little veggie lollipops and not overly salted.  I also realized that they sell these in the frozen section, where you can buy and bring home.  The chow mein also really good, nicely fried, didn't feel heavy and tasty without it going overboard.  Stir fry vegetables are just stir fry vegetables, so while they're good, it's nothing to shout home about.  Service is pretty good too, they're pretty quick and attentive.  Plus the owner who was standing at the outside the menu, handed us a menu, since their display menu is...a bit on the vandalized.  All in all, great place in Kensington, check it out :)"}
{"text":"I'm very impressed with King's Cafe.  I'm never sure what to expect with vegetarian restaurants, but this one did not let me down.  The service was one of the best things about our experience there.  Our waiter was patient, prompt, and took the time to answer all of our questions, to explain dishes to us, and to warn us of non-vegan friendly ingredients in some things.  He also made GREAT recommendations, right down to dessert.  I began my meal with a vegetarian fish ball soup (carrot, cauliflower, veggie broth, and sliced fish ball).  It was perfectly seasoned and light.  I ordered the \"combination\" bento box with Kung Po \"Chicken\".  It came with a salad, spring roll, \"chicken nuggets\", purple rice, & plum dipping sauce.  The salad was nicely done, with a halved strawberry & red grape, sliced orange, kiwi & apple, served on mixed greens.  The spring roll was pretty standard, but the chicken nuggets were incredible!  The seasoning was more than perfect, and they tasted so fresh, they just melt in your mouth.  On my next visit, I plan to get a big order of the nuggets as my meal.  The purple rice was also very well done, and beautifully laid out and garnished.  So few restaurants take the time to garnish their rice, but it's always a great touch.  And the main part, the Kung Po chicken was just fabulous.  I bit spicy, but really, really good.    I also tasted the enoki mushroom balls, which I highly recommend.  For dessert, we shared the Skor bar, and the Magic bar; two dessert squares.  The Skor bar was less caramel, more chocolate chip shortbread, but still delicious.  The Magic bar included 3 kinds of chocolate, and coconut.  I preferred the Magic bar, but it was a lot harder to bite into because of a hard chocolate foundation.  My only criticism, is that there is a draft every time the door is opened if you sit by the front window because there is a gap between the glass wall by the entry and the dining area.  They also play very soothing Japanese flute music, but often I felt like passing out at the table because of it.  Reminded me of the music I meditate to, or the sort they play at the spa.  Otherwise, great decor, & it was very clean & wonderful for groups."}
{"text":"I SO wish we had the vegetarian options that Toronto has in the Denver area! Don't get me wrong, we have places, but a completely vegan/vegetarian Chinese restaurant with a huge menu? We do NOT have these. That explains why me and my boyfriend ordered so much food for just the two of us. We thought, when are we going to get this chance again?   We ate:  \"Chicken\" drumsticks - about $7 for six drumsticks - comes with a sweet dipping sauce; good texture (I don't know how they get the skin that way) and no funky taste to the (soy? wheat gluten?) meat  Extra small hot and sour soup - extra small is basically a cup of soup; very tasty!! Lots of various ingredients and great flavor - I would order this again in a heartbeat; $3.50  BBQ pork bun - this is basically char sui bao (sp?) - very tender bun with the classic sweet taste you expect; this was better than some regular ones I've had!! $1.50  Shrimp dumplings - from the dim sum menu...these were just okay; very fresh, but they don't taste like shrimp $3  Teriyaki seitan - tasty, but don't believe the menu, this dish is not at all spicy; it ran about $13  Spicy eggplant - this is a tasty dish; the strips of seitan and bits of shiitake mushrooms are my favorite parts; but, the eggplant is tender and delicious; about $11  Tea: we drank a small pot of the Osmanthus Fragance Dancong, an oolong tea. It was very lovely, floral and smooth. I highly recommend this! $5 for the small pot  Neither of the two mains came with rice, which we thought was odd...but since we were stuffing ourselves, we didn't feel it necessary to order yet more food. The servers were extremely nice, and the overall experience was great."}
{"text":"Lunch at King's Cafe was a good, quiet stop in the crowded Kensington Market.  I had the vegetarian fried protein in a stir-fry. The protein was excellent, but the stir fry was heavy on the overly sweet sauce and light on the produce.   The service was fair; we only looked around for our waiter once or twice. I wouldn't recommend coming here in a hurry, though - it's a place where everyone seems to take their time, including the guests.   The atmosphere was decent. I liked the floor-to-ceiling windows looking out onto the crowded market streets. The little shop inside the restaurant was neat, but the decor was stale.   Overall, I'd recommend stopping at King's Cafe if you're looking for a breather from the crowded Kensington Market."}
{"text":"I went there today with some friends and I was not impressed at all.  1. Not enough servers on Pedestrian Sunday, a super busy day in Kensington.  2. Friend ordered a zen salad with the dressing on the side (and the waitress said \"the dressing is always on the side anyway\"). When the dish came out the dressing was not on the side. They were nice enough to take it back and get her a new one though. 3. They forgot to give another friend his soup which was part of the combination box.  4. For another friend, they forgot to bring out his ice-cream until he asked for it.  5. One friend waited 30+ mins for her \"Tom Yang\" soup. it's spelled \"Tom Yum\" people. 6. I waited even longer for my sweet & sour soup. Eventually the waitress came over to check my order. Judging by the look on their face the original order had been forgotten completely. 7. Waited 30+ mins for my sweet & sour soup. They forgot my order of purple rice.   Now I understand it was a hectic day and time but that's not an excuse for poor service. Add to that the prices could be better (for a similar soup, of similar size i.e. medium, I could have bought it at Buddha's for less).  The food itself, once I finally got it, was decent. Location-wise it's a great spot and there aren't too many restaurants catering to the veg crowd so on a good day it's not bad."}
{"text":"This is the best vegetarian restaurant in the city! The perfect fix for vegetarians when they're craving something a little \"meaty\". Even all my skeptical friends who eat meat love this place! The Kung Po Soy Chicken and BBQ Seitan are probably the best dishes. The jasmine iced green tea is also amazing, they make it fresh at the restaurant. I could eat here daily for the rest of my life. I HIGHLY recommend it!"}
{"text":"Very good food! I had the sweet and sour Lappa, it was a little too sweet and sour for my likings, but still very tasty!  Soy nuggets, spring rolls, and soup are also very good!   Service is good and friendly too."}
{"text":"I have been to this place a few times with my family. We come here whenever we feel like having Chinese and mock meat dishes. My friends have said that their mock beef and pork dishes tastes like real pork and beef. Since I'm a vegetarian I can't validate that.   I have been to this place and their second location in Mississauga, Zen Garden, more than 10 times. Our meal here would always consist of Soy Drumsticks (similar to Chicken drumsticks), Tom Yang Vermicelli (I love it), Kung Po Soy-Fritters (gravy dish), and Crispy & spicy Soy Fritters (sort of crispy chicken with spices - dry dish)."}
{"text":"We had the fried tofu, curry puffs, wonton soup, and mixed veggies.  The curry puffs were pretty good.  The wonton had mostly skin and was very disappointing.  The mixed veggie dish was very greasy (even after we asked for light oil).    The food also came out very slowly.  There were maybe 5 other tables when we were eating, but food took longer than expected to serve.  I felt like I needed some sort of de-greaser after eating there.  Wouldn't recommend it when there are so many other better vegan restaurants in downtown Toronto."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite restaurants! I love the variety of dishes and flavours that are available and I could literally eat 100 dumplings. The portion sizing is great for getting a few things and splitting them between people just so you can try things. I love the variety of mock meats, the textures and flavours vary which is a nice change if you're like me and eat a lot of the same things when at home. The price is good for what you get.  The environment is really nice and is great for dates or larger get-togethers. I've had a joint birthday dinner here and everyone enjoyed the food.  Love coming back here."}
{"text":"I have come to this restaurant on several occasions now, especially since it's not a far walk away from the St. George campus for U of T. As a vegan, I absolutely love how their mock meat dishes have the consistency and taste of actual meat. They also have some dim sum dishes that imitate the meat version very well too.   They have a part of their store where you can actually buy their vegan meats to take home, which I found extremely wonderful since I can taste test their vegan meat first in the restaurant. Their vegan beef jerky is also amazing.  The only little problem I had with the restaurant was that a couple of the staff did not speak English very well. I had to ask three times for a bowl because the employee kept on bringing back the wrong item, such as a spoon instead. Other than that, the service was great too."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite restaurants in the city. I often come here for take out. The Kung pao \"chicken\" it completely delicious and comes with a great selection of crunchy, well cooked veg. You can tell they really care about what they do. The restaurant is spotlessly clean and well taken care of.   Highly recommended for veggies and carnivores!   And to Jason S - the people that own Kings are Taoist and don't believe in cooking with excitable flavours like garlic or onions."}
{"text":"Great vegan & vegetarian restaurant ( dim sum & others ), also has vegan groceries, tea and teapot at very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time last weekend. Food wasnt bad for vegetarian and mocked proteins. We got soy mocked bbq pork, mocked duck & mocked chicken. I think im just not a fan of the texture. Ive had some really great vegetarian dishes at temples across the city. I would definately return to try some other dishes on the menu. Theres tons of options and variety here! The hot & soup was on the very bland & underseasoned side. I could do w out the soup next time. Hopefully my next visit will be more stellar! I wanna try the enoki balls everyone is raving about!"}
{"text":"King's Cafe is a gem of the Market.  Everything on the menu is vegetarian and much of it is vegan, but I've yet to hear and omnivore complain.  The food is delicious, but sometimes a bit bland.  Easily the best veggie Hot and Sour soup in town is here.  The cooking style is Buddhist, but you don't miss the garlic and onions much and as an added bonus, there is a refrigerated section where you can purchase frozen mock meats and other specialty items to bring home."}
{"text":"I finally got a chance to check out the King's Cafe, and better yet, could bring along two meat eaters as well. My friend was quite hesitant to my vegetarian ways, and I was determined to show her vegetarian food can be quite good. Mission accomplished!  I ordered the assorted seitan platter and the avocado maki cone. I shared an order of fried dumplings with my friend and she ordered spring rolls and the mango sushi. Our other friend ordered  a winter selection which was dumplings followed by 'chicken' and vegetables. We were all quite happy with our food. The taste was amazing and the staff were super friendly. I will definitely be coming back to try out more included their bbq drumsticks, and if I ever eat dairy again, the avocado milkshake is first on my list of things to try!!  All in all, a huge success and bonus, the waiter was kind of cute :)"}
{"text":"I should start by saying I love faux meats.  This is a mecca in that category.  There are a plethora of non-meat meat options and most are done exceptionally well.  I'm not huge on the atmosphere but the neighborhood is fun and it shares some of that vibe.   The fact that you can buy frozen faux meat to take home is also a bonus."}
{"text":"Vegetarian restaurant at the bottom of the market. A huge place for this area, and pretty empty. I ordered the combination with spicy eggplant that comes with soup and little apps. Very tasty and perfect portions presented bento-style. Delicious and filling, with a nice view of the neighborhood. Service was prompt and efficient. I'd come back again for sure."}
{"text":"The food itself is generally good.  You can't go too wrong (except if you have their miso soup - one of the blandest items that you can ever taste in this world).  What's been upsetting, lately, is how CHEAP their take out containers and cutlery are.  I ordered some chow mein noodles for take-out yesterday, as well as a wonton soup.  The plastic cover on the chow mein noodles CRACKED, and the liquid from the noodles ended up everywhere in their cheap plastic bag.  I wouldn't normally care so much about whether a place used cheap cutlery, containers, or not, but when you're relying on said items to transport your lunch from the restaurant to your workplace, and find a disaster en route... it's majorly disappointing.  Price-wise, they're not even cheap, so I don't know why King's Cafe has skimped on their containers and cutlery.    word to the wise: Eating in person there is a better bet, if you have the time."}
