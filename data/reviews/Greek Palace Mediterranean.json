{"text":"This place is amazing!! I had the chicken shawarma plate that featured the most well seasoned, tender chicken shawarma I have ever had. The rice was incredibly flavored with a delicious side salad that had a wonderful dressing as well. The hummus is so fresh and tasty. The pita is spot on. My boyfriend ordered the falafel plate which he said was the best falafel he has ever had. We go to a lot of Mediterranean restaurants and this is one of the best. Very clean inside as well! I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"best Mediterranean food in Phoenix no mixes all fresh. homemade baklava with Turkish coffee delicious falafel best I have had in Phoenix"}
{"text":"Stumbled into this place on while feeling a craving for Mediterranean food. Fantastic food, and pricing was good (although they were doing 50% off for their opening days which ends today) but even then, for the amount of food I got and how flavorful everything was I'm glad I stopped in. Great change of pace from the restaurant that was in that building before."}
{"text":"Everything on the menu is delicious! I have eaten it all. The food taste home made as if from their home kitchen to my plate. Their food is the best tasting Mediterranean food around. I hope they become busy to offer the buffet again. Fabulous food! anyone who says it is not does not know what good food is. Only restaurant that my belly can digest the food with out getting ill. A thousand stars for that!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been eating & cooking Mediterranean food a long time. I loved this place. Pro #1 Food I had (Lamb Kefta Kebab plate) was delicious! Succulent kebabs, plentiful flavorful rice, salad with a lovely non-greasy dressing, and a traditional pita. Pro #2 Very reasonable prices. Comparable to all the other Med. places but fresher decor if you want to sit down. Pro #3. It's open past 8 p.m! The sidewalks all roll up at 8 pm for most Med places. They close at 9 pm weekday and till 10 weekends. Pro #4 They have more than 1 vegetarian plate. Pro #6 The fish plate is grilled, not deep friend. Will try this one next. Greek Palace is a newly opened restaurant; I wish them great success and hope to find the place full next time I visit."}
{"text":"Brand new place. I came for a lunch meeting and the service wAs excelente. The owner came and spoke with us and was very friendly to us. I had the lamb shawarma and it was to die for. I will most likely visit this place again and try more items in the menu."}
{"text":"This place is great! I had the chicken shawarma plate and my daughter had the gyro sandwich combo with fries. The shawarma was tender and well seasoned. It was served with creamy hummus and a salad topped with very tasty dressing. The gyro was good too, and had a slightly crispy texture that we both loved. The fries were perfectly cooked, not soggy at all. We even tried the baklava (made with pistachios). Everything was delicious and the potions were very large. I stuffed myself and could still barely close lid on my box of leftovers.  The service was friendly and prompt. We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Food is so delicious, the owners are from the Middle East and bring authentic flavors. This is a brand new business, so everything is clean. I'm excited to try more menu options but the falafel is perfectly crisp and GLUTEN FREE. Don't let the empty business fool you as take out is the most popular option, and delivery they say is coming!!"}
{"text":"WOW - they really know their flavors at this little  out of the way spot in a strip mall on Thunderbird near 43rd Ave.   We had a #30 and #31 - Chicken Shawarma plate and Chicken and Potatoes.  The Chicken Shawarma plate comes with a Greek salad that has a very flavorful dressing - I'm not sure what it is, but it is really delicious, along with hummus, pita bread and rice.  Everything is seasoned so well.  The rice is some of the best rice I've ever had at a Mediterranean place.  The Chicken and Potatoes came with 3 chicken legs and round potato slices.  It didn't look that exciting upon opening the container..but HOLY MOLY that stuff was GOOD.  The owner is very friendly also.  Stay in the neighborhood please!!"}
{"text":"Delightful lunch at 2 on a Saturday. Chicken kebab plate was very well made and flavors were great and fresh. Pita was thinner than I'm used to but very good for wrapping and a nice texture. Cheerful orange walls and clean place. I will be back."}
{"text":"The freshest Mediterranean food I've ever had in Phoenix! Really enjoyed the hummus, baba ganoush, falafel and tabbouleh!  My Mom had the gyro and love it!  This family owned restaurant is a winner in my book!"}
{"text":"Decided to give this new restaurant a try. Very glad that I did. On this rainy night, soup sounded like a good idea. Ordered their lentil soup, which was clearly homemade! Delicious!! Many places tend to overly salt their soups. Not here. It was just right and the portion was huge (a pretty big bowl). I also ordered the gyro sandwich with fries. What set this gyro apart is that it was grilled, sort of flattened and a tad crispy on the edges. It wasn't the fat, fluffy pita bread I'm used to getting with gyros. It was so much better! So I asked my server what kind of bread it was. She said it's homemade pita bread that they make there. OMG...heavenly pita bread! The fries were steak fries, my favorite kind of fry. The basket of fries is huge, good for sharing. Another tiny plus is they have both Coke and Pepsi products.
Finally...I'll mention the service. It was great. My server was so kind and had a friendly smile. Food came hot and quickly. 
Welcome to the neighborhood, Greek Palace. I'm glad we met! See you soon."}
