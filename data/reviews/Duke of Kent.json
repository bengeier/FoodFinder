{"text":"The Duke of Kent serves up traditional pub food in a cozy spot at the corner of Yonge and Eglinton.  Kent is just one of a series of 'Duke Pubs' scattered around Toronto, and judging from the fairly comprehensive website, each has a slightly different décor, but all of them seem to tap into that English corner pub ambience.

After a long week at work, I was on the hunt for a casual space to grab a pint, enjoy some hearty food, and catch up with some friends; the Duke of Kent was a great choice...for the most part.

I snagged a corner booth with my dinner group on a busy Friday night.  When we first walked in, it seemed hopeless. We wanted dinner, but there was nary a table to be seen.  The staff did everything they could to make a space for us so we weren't forced back out into the cold to one of the other countless restaurants in the area.  That is what service is all about, and we were happy to stay.  Many thanks to the serving staff for being so accommodating on a hopping Friday night!

As for the food, it is the expected and welcomed pub spread.  They offer up fish & chips (yes, served in a basket on paper), pot roast and potatoes with buttered peas, and even bangers and mash.  You will find an array of reasonably priced English pub food on the menu, with entrees coming in at about $12 across the board.

As I've said before, I tend to go for the specials, and that night it was Moroccan Stew.  Unfortunately, I am sad to say it was disappointing.  The dish was somewhere between a curry and a Mexican chili, and I was given a healthy serving for the $12.99 price-point.  But, I couldn't help but become envious of those around me who had gravy-topped pot pies, crispy fish and chips, beefy burgers and gooey quesadillas.  I probably would not have been as put-off by the it if it was labelled on the menu, as it was on my bill - just 'vegetable stew'.  It was not as exotic as the name lead me to believe, and with a delicious-looking curry dish on the main menu, I expected more spice and life in my 'Moroccan' Stew special.

For a visit to the Duke, I suggest going full-English.  I saw enough plates of fish and chips go by to convince me that it is a popular item, and how much more traditional can you get than that?  Also, I have the 'famous' deep-fried pepperoni targeted - it has to be famous for a reason!

At the end of it all, the Duke of Kent draws in a wonderfully lively crowd, and provides a great atmosphere and service, albeit a bit slow - but hey, it was busy!  My food may have only been so-so, but the brew was cold, and my night was great."}
{"text":"Love their nachos and Moscow Mules! Eating/drinking here is quite expensive, but the quality is great and the servers are awesome."}
{"text":"I am extremely hesitant to order nachos at any restaurant after years of continued disappointment. I was taken here by a friend who said they would meet my expectations. And HOLY F**K these nachos are legit. No skimping out on cheese or vegetables. Perfect medley of flavor in every bite. (We did order extra cheese) but with only the half size plate we were both stuffed and barely able to finish are also delicious entrees. Bangers n mash on point. Fishnchips also very good. I recommend well done chips."}

Recommended?:  Yes

If you're in the Yonge and Eglinton area, this is a good pub to visit. Duke of Kent is pretty much always packed with the young and eligible making it a great place for socializing. Nothing is fancy about this place but I do like this place if I feel like going to a pub. The burgers and the sliders are pretty good and the variety of beers on tap is decent. And if you want to people watch, the best place is on the top floor by the windows. Bottom line, recommended, if you're in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"There is a nice variety in the menu with some vegetarian options as well and dishes are well prepared. 
Menu Plus: Sweet potato fries, juicy burgers, Moroccan dish. 
Menu Minus: Steak. 
Service is good, friendly and effective. 
Good balance between tables, booths and bar attendance, you will find tv sets but on the other hand you won't get the feeling you entered future shop.
Gives a nice pub feeling with a personal character that comes with age.
Overall you might find better ones but this is the best pub in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"The food indeed is over priced. Bar food is bar food, washing it down with a beer makes anything taste good.  They really need some sort of signature dish.  Alcohol is the same wherever you go.  Not complaining about the drinks, just saying foods needs improvement if Duke of Kent wants to stand up to other pubs."}
{"text":"Extremely friendly crowd and staff. The curry chicken with the rhubarb chutney is Delicious"}
{"text":"I started drinking at this pub in high school. That was twenty years ago and I still go back every so often with a friend when I'm back in town. It's a nice pub, good atmosphere, large variety of drinks and good food. That being said I don't know if I would choose it as a place for a main meal, small tables and very crowded.  Although I always get the wings with my pint. 
The wait staff are quick and always pleasant.  There is a seating area upstairs but I really don't like being up there. Completely different atmosphere. 
Wish it was bigger but that can't be changed and the fact that it's crowded proves their doing something right.  Cheers."}
{"text":"Good bar. Gets a little rowdy sometimes, but nevertheless keeps and authentic British pub feel. Solid food and hot waitresses. Try it out, for it won't be here for long with all this condo development."}
{"text":"Great food, awesome service. Good old simple pub with a fantastic beer selection. Food wise my favorite is the fish and chips but the burgers are incredibly too."}
{"text":"The service is mediocre and the food is okay. There's nothing special about this place but it's not an uncomfortable setting either. I did however try their special soup the other day and it wasn't very satisfying. It was Cajun corn chowder with grilled chicken. What came to the table was a murky green bowl with very little inside other than a spicy broth and a few veggies which were most likely rehydrated. All in all though it's not a bad pub, it just doesn't offer much other than drinks and mediocre service."}
{"text":"Worst beer I had.  
Did not taste like beer.   
My husband's glass smelled vomit.  
Both felt sick."}
{"text":"We went to meet some friends for a birthday party. Originally they had called to make a reservation and they said they didn't take reservations of Friday. When they arrived there was some confusion \"oh, are you here for the reservation upstairs?\"
When we arrive there are no seats for us. A staff member let us know once that we should watch for servers coming in/out of the the kitchen so we tried to squish in as best we could. Then we were addressed again with a \"you guys really need to move, that's not a request, you can't be here.\"
That and they were apologizing to the table beside our group but not us. I can understand the danger of crowding the path to the kitchen but the staff was rude and should have told our group that they couldn't accommodate them in the first place rather than handling it as they did.
Needless to say we left and won't be coming back."}
{"text":"It's a decent pub.  Wanted a few pints and a place to watch some footy, worked on both fronts, and the nachos were palatable.  Not a place I'd divert to from... anywhere, really, but if I'm there I'll drink there."}
{"text":"Came here with friends on A Saturday night just for drinks.

Service was terrible and unfriendly. I had to go to the bar to get service as we couldn't find our waitress half the time. When we did get to order our drinks took 10 minutes to come or never arrived at all. They needed more staff working.

Also this place is way overpriced for what it is. $9 for a pint of low end domestic (Keith's). You have to be kidding.... This place is just a regular chain pub and isn't that nice inside to command that kind of price...I've paid less for a pint at a high end steakhouse or strip club."}
{"text":"I have been here on multiple occasions, the food here is excellent and fresh!! All of the servers are attentive, and helpful!! 
The atmosphere is comfortable, clean, and cozy!!
I am a vegetarian and this is an important factor for me, so having options is awesome!!"}
{"text":"I love coming to the Duke of Kent. The food and service is always good."}
{"text":"Appetizers and entrees are delicious! Desserts are pricey, but still very tasty.

Friendly staff, small and cozy area."}
{"text":"**3.5 stars **

This is my first trip to this pub since moving into the neighbourhood just over a month ago. I must say, so far so good. 

It's your typical idea of a pub without being out of control ... It's not too big, and I can talk to my friends above the din. I can even hear the music above people's voices.

Our server this evening was decent - attentive and prompt with orders and drink refills.

The Duke's Ultimate Nachos (with chicken) was super-tasty, with more than enough kick from the jalapeno peppers.

The bite-sized calamari wasn't too bad, and the half-and-half wings (hot/honey garlic) were decent.

I'd say it was a good first visit. Duke to Kent, here's hoping I'll become a regular here, as time goes on."}
{"text":"Mediocre beers, seriously disappointing food. 

First, the food: Absolutely tasteless, uninspired burgers. Dry ribs that are way more \"dry\" than \"ribs\" and taste like literally nothing. Butter chicken sauce heavy on tomato, with chunks of crusty, pan-fried (not stewed) chicken floating in it. Beer list heavy on the usual corporate imports, completely ignoring the local craft brew industry.

Service was friendly, which is the only reason this place gets two stars and not one.

Once upon a time the Duke was my go-to pub in the neighbourhood. Never again."}
{"text":"Having moved here from England not long ago i was in the mood for some English style food and beers and decided to try here- i was utterly disappointed.

first of all the pub was packed which I am not usually to fussy about but they sat me almost on someones knee to eat my meal and when it finally arrived it was more like fish cake than a fish! 

It was so loud we had to shout over the table to hear each other! 

The waitress was a little impatient with us and i felt really rushed to get out and let the next person have our table! 

I don't think i will be returning here!"}
{"text":"My first experience here wasn't great, however the manager approached me the next time we were here and made up for that. Ever since then we've been regulars, and not had another negative experience since. The beer is reasonably priced; the food is slightly more than average, but if you're here anyway, why not. This place has some of the friendliest staff I've seen, though. Overall, give it a shot if you're in the area."}
{"text":"This place is a neighbourhood classic. So convenient just north of Eglinton station. Fair prices. Would come again.

Really not sure why this place has gotten so many mediocre and poor reviews. I've been here a few times and never had a bad experience! My servers were always extremely professional and friendly. I always tipped at least 18%.

It's has typical pub food, however my favourites are the: fish and chips, fried calamari, pretzel, and sweet potato fries. Except, the shepherd's pie was way too salty for my taste. Contains a great selection of draft and imported beers as well.

Overall, it's a hip and vibrant atmosphere of various ages (the majority in their 40's/50's). Lots of seating space, including an upper level with great views! It also attracts a younger crowd if you feel like you're only other option is The Pickle Barrel or Mandarin."}
{"text":"I have frequented the Duke of Kent on more than one occasion.   A hop skip and a jump from the Eglinton subway station, it's one of the old establishments of the young and eligble AKA Yonge & Eglinton area.  I chose this place as a matter of convenience for a recent tweetup with some political and soccer frenzied folks. 

It seems from the last time I went here, they've stepped up their game.  I was a tad disappointed they still do not have Rickard's Dark yet and they have Rickard's White as a \"new edition\" to the beer menu.  They still have the regular English ales and lagers on tap as well as Strongbow cider, which is my other fave.  

It's a dimly lit pub with an upstairs area for the overflow crowd - atypical of an English pub.  It has your normal British fare with the additions of nachos and wings.  I ordered the nachos for our group but I think she mistakenly added an additional order which ended up being wasted.  I still couldn't believe though extra cheese was $5.  Even on pizzas it isn't that much.  It's cheddar for crying out loud. 

Other than that our server was very attentive without being overly annoying, which is something I like.  There has always been something that made me go back to this place over the Rose & Crown or any of the other pubs south of Eglinton or west of Yonge.  So for a great atmosphere amongst friends, I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"One of the few pub patios in the area that gets a fair amount of sun in the summer (a lot of the rest are shady from all the tall buildings in the area).

For a place that doesn't have a ton of seating inside on the main floor we usually manage to find a table despite the crowd. They also have an upstairs that's rarely busy and can seat a bunch more people though the atmosphere up there is quite lacking compared to the main floor. 

The clientele seems to be late 20's and up, and I get the impression they have a lot of 'locals'. 

They serve an alright lunch, though it certainly isn't the pubs selling feature. For $8.99 you have the option of a turkey wrap, a ham/bacon/onion quiche, a chicken caesar salad or a burger. You can choose one of the following side: salad, fries, sweet potatoes fries or soup. The wrap was actually pretty good (simple, but not too bad) and the caesar standard if not a little on the garlicy side. Their typical pub food is okay too. Nachoes, wings, nothing really stands out as awesome but none of it stands out as bad either.

For me this place gets 4 stars in the winter and a 4+ in the summer, the difference being that sunny patio."}
{"text":"Only since I moved to Toronto has the Union Jack ever had any appeal to me and it is usually always associated with my hunt for real British pub food and that glorious Chicken & Veg Pie I so yearn.

Anyway less fantasising and more yelping.

Being in the North York area and it being the kind of time when I fancied a cold pint and food to go with it, I thought I would for once not go McNasty's and try here.

Inside it is very much like an English pub, minus the yobs, but also with more people there to eat food than drink beer. 

The waitress was welcoming but when she advised us there was a wait on tables (place was packed) I pointed out to her a small table by the window. 

The area we had no choice but to sit in was crammed, the tables are very close together and it is not at all cosy.

The menu from what I remember was decent, they even had the standard Chicken Balti dish that all pubs should have by law.

I eyed the bangers and mash (no chicken and veg pies) and was surprised when it came out to have a small portion of baked beans. 

The service was quick and the food came out within 10 minutes. 

Now the food, sausages were not juicy or great, the gravy was lame and for some reason I had a small side of baked beans (does not go with the dish!!), the only saving grace was the mash was pretty good although I suspect not real potato mash.

All in all it was a decent attempt but I will continue my quest for a proper British pub."}
{"text":"I've been here for drinks before, and sitting at the bar, the service has always been adequate. However, I was there on Friday night with a friend for dinner and drinks. This was the first time I had dinner there.

Unfortunately, it didn't go well. We ordered our drinks from the waitress, and when the server (not our waitress) brought them, she actually spilled both pints on our table, and across our laps. They were apologetic and brought napkins, but there was no effort to make amends in any way. At one point the waitress actually blamed the beer glasses for the spills. In my opinion, they could have at least comp'd a drink for us. It would have made all the difference. Instead, it put a real downer on the evening.

My friend had the veggie burger, and I had fish & chips. The food was unimpressive.

The atmosphere was ok, but very loud. we had to shout at each other to be heard.

I understand that the Duke Of Kent's days are numbered, as condos are to be built on that site. I can't say I'll be sorry to see it go. I may stop in again for a pint (probably not, though) but I definitely don't plan to eat there ever again."}
{"text":"After a terrible experience trying to arrange a work outing for 15 people elsewhere that left us walking out after the first drink (Which I rarely ever do). We had only an hour before an enormous playoff baseball game and nowhere to go. 

I called the Duke of Kent having been there for a beer or 2 on previous occasions who told us they were very busy but would accommodate us no problem. 

We were given a table downstairs immediately even tho the place was already rammed. We were jammed in but every time a table cleared our waitress brought it over and gave us more room.

It ended up being almost 20 of us and we received some of the best service I've had in a while. Separate checks was no problem, our waitress was fast, friendly and sociable without being annoying. 

I'm regretting I don't remember her name but she was blonde and was sporting a Josh Donaldson jersey (Bonus points). There was also another server who was running food and helping out and he was just as good with a funny sense of humour.

We drank a lot and had appetizers. The sweet potato fries, meat balls, cheese sticks, and nachos were all great standard pub food but the real winner here was the service.

The interior is very pub like and has a lot of character. It's not exactly shiny and new but who wants to go to a pub like that anyways?

Highly recommend checking this place out!"}
{"text":"Old school Irish pub that was very busy on a Friday night. We sat upstairs where it wasn't as packed for drinks. The beer selection was not bad; they had the usual suspects and a small selection of craft beer. I didn't get a look at the menu, just there for a drink. There were many TVs with the Jays game on.

Service was good. She was friendly and kept our glasses full. A cozy spot!"}
{"text":"Classic pub. Typical English style. Fair pricing for pints. Good service. Can't go wrong! Conveniently located outside yonge and eg subway."}
{"text":"Right by my apt, so it's an easy place to swing by for a quick drink/ meet up place with friends. 
weak nachos...good sticky toffee pudding cake...fairly affordable wines by the glasses"}
{"text":"I was asked a few times if I live around Vic park an Danforth why would I come all the way here just for like 1 or 2 drinks reason is cause that's how bloody awesome this place is an as soon as u walk in they make u feel welcomed every time even if u go for a smoke an come back it's like u just walked into the place not to mention that everyone who works here are super friendly not only is it worth the $ but I think it's also worth the travel"}
{"text":"A nice pub that's open late and offers huge variety of beers and different cocktails. 

reasonably priced and has 2nd floor which is a bit less crowded and I think has a patio though I'm not sure about that as it was a pretty cold weather. 

the music inside is not loud and allows people to hear their own thoughts and conversations and that was the main criteria why we chose this place. 

might be coming back."}
{"text":"This is my favourite pub-food-with-friends or quick-bite-before-movie spot at Y&E.  Everything's good.  Try the second floor if the main floor's too loud for conversation.  My friend swears by the curry."}
{"text":"Their fish and chips is actually unreal for a chain! Andrew is the best. I go by just for him. Witty, smart and warm. If you're looking for a good time to by on Tuesday or Wednesday late night and your in for a serious treat!"}
{"text":"A relatively quite pub for friends to hang out. I really enjoy this bar!"}
{"text":"We went there for my bday on a Sunday afternoon. Half price bottled of prosseco We had some oysters and food was so good,  but the best was the server.  She gave us a sweet setup with an extra tbl for our bucket. I wish I could remember her name..she was fabulous!!"}
{"text":"I am not sure about some reviews here, but I always question reviews from people who got to eat to the bar. It is the bar isn't it? After all you don't got McDonald's expecting to get first class espresso. Just a thought...I go to this place regularly for one reason. Care to guess which one? :) I ordered nachos with chicken they actually forgot to put the chicken, but i did not mind it because it end up being quite delicious. The location is very convenient and it has a nice patio, although a little small.

If you are looking to do a quick stop by with your friends especially during hot summer days, this place is for you. 

Cheers!"}
{"text":"Another Dukes Pub. Yes it is a chain (although there isnt another one midtown as most are located downtown near the financial district)... but it doesn't matter when all you want to eat are some fish n chips, or \"culturally inspired\" pub food such as the Curry chicken karma masala rolls or the delicious Morrocan stew. Also enough drink choices for beer lovers (not me).

I came here twice and on both occasions, service was decent. We asked them both times to please rush the order a bit, as we were trying to make it on time for our movie and they kindly complied.

It's very packed here due to location. Close proximity to my favourite comedy club, Absolute, as well as the Cineplex. Not many other pubs around here either.

Stay for dessert (I tried their apple crumble pie - pretty good crust), or walk down half a block to Sugar Mountain and fill up on some sweet goodies for your movie.

The couch seats arent the cleanest looking nor are they comfy (all dented in). The very dim lighting makes it worse. Also all the tables are so jammed together making it a bit claustrophobic, and also the restaurant is filled with office workers nearby looking for a bite to eat. However they do have two levels and the upper level is better for breathing although same poor couch seats. Haven't sat at the bar stools so can't say.

Recommendations: Fish n chips, Burgers, Camden poutine, and Chicken pot pie. Friend ordered the Sheppard pie and said it was good too although salty."}
{"text":"Fish tacos burnt,  no toppings on nachos. Had to send them back.  Been here before and usually OK but lately has been terrible.  Not sure what happened but many options in the area"}
{"text":"After stepping out of a movie at the SilverCity at Yonge and Eglinton, I was slapped fiercly by the winter bite of wind chill and sought out a winter refuge. Thankfully, the Duke of Kent met my needs. It has all the elements you want in a pub - especially on a frosty winter night. The warm red and espresso brown hues wrapped us with its warmth immediately as we entered. The room was filled with smiling chatter and friendly faces. A very welcoming pub indeed.

I decided to opt for wine instead of beer.  Although, they have a very good beer selection if that is what you prefer. We had the Shiraz-Cabernet Sauvignon from South Africa....it was your typical house wine but paired very well with the Ultimate Nacho's. I highly recommend them...just cheesy yummyness....especially when sided with their guacamole. 

The service and atmosphere was great. Definitely a place for some good old conversation!"}
{"text":"Eh this is a good pub. Got class tomorrow but whatever man. Sam Adams is cold. I love Sam Adams on tap. I'll fire some pics up."}
{"text":"ordered the small salad with calamari.  the calamarie tasted more like fried chicken, kinda gross.  otherwise a decent british english pub vibe and typical of what you would expect.  lively and loud.  considering that itvwas really busy for a friday night and sjort staffed getting the attention of the waitress was pretty good as well they checked up and ere efficient.  didnt wait too long to be serviced and felt like they were on top of things."}
{"text":"Pretty average bar at Yonge-Eg. I went to high school in the area and haven't seen much changes to this establishment. 

They serve your standard pub fare (curry, fried food, bar food etc.). I also noticed a 'Movie Meal,' which are discounted combination meals that you can enjoy before or after watching a movie across the street. Their drink menu is not extensive; you wouldn't be able to find drinks from all corners of the world, but there's enough choice. Also, it's not the life of the party on most nights. I have to commend the staff on great service though. 

The Duke is a great community pub if you just want to enjoy a super quiet night out.

Good for: drinks, pub grub"}
{"text":"Well, the season has changed and this means their policies do as well.
Where my previous review was applauding their ability to handle groups, I should update this to let you know that they only book reservations until 5pm on Fridays. Then its \"first come first serve\", although I'd like to call shenanigans on that as there were clearly open spots (no drinks on table, no coats on chairs, etc) and told they were being occupied.

I'm still giving this place 3 stars as it is one of the better pubs in the area, but just using this forum as a warning that if going with a group, be prepared to come up with a back up plan."}
{"text":"Hey, it's a pub! They serve pub food! And beer! Service is pretty expedient, the space is large (good for groups), and there's a nice patio for quaffing and people-watching during warm weather."}
{"text":"Been here a few times - it's a super convenient location at yonge and eg. 

this time i visited here after dinner at Grazie and before going to Screemers and had something like an hour to kill. The bar is very british looking and it was quite packed, people are having a fine time. I ordered something called the Moscow Mule, it's a ginger beer, with lime and shot of vodka, served in a copper mug. it's the weirdest thing and yet VERY YUMMY. Well if you hate ginger don't even touch this, it's very ginger-y and lime-y. Interesting cocktail indeed. 

I like it here, next time I'll try the fish and chips."}
{"text":"I stopped here for lunch last Saturday as I was walking up Yonge towards Lawrence. This IS a nice place to hang out. It's a cozy and welcoming space that draws you in (as long as you open the outside pub door first).

I ordered a pint and some fish and chips.  I'm not the biggest fan of deep fried fish, but the batter was fresh and everything (including the chips) were very crisp and delicious, and with no greasy aftertaste.  The coleslaw was also fresh. The service was also friendly, helpful and quick."}
{"text":"after a filthy at part 4 of Guys night out..., the entourage and I were praying for a savior! 

Part 5 saw us tracking it around the corner to DK!!!!! not Donkey Kong, but Duke of Kent coming to the rescue and luckily...location, location, location, it was just north of Eglinton! Though it was getting late, and we were at the brink of needing food, we decided one last stop for drinks before we headed out for a meal! 

As I can recall, DK has always been a warm, welcoming, relaxing, and chilled out pub that has always retained its clientele.  The service has always been good, and so has the food.  The comforting atmosphere can definitely put anyone to sleep especially after a hard day....or hell...even after partying! 

The proximity of this location makes its convenient, with the subway station, bus line without the downtown core congestion and headaches!!! 

Definitely the place for comfort food and drinks to share among amigos....or amigas."}
{"text":"Beer is top-notch here now in terms of quality- excellent selection of great local and other beers. However, they are expensive, maybe that just goes with the 'hood.
Food is where they let me down - standard pub fare and that's it, also not done particularly well,  portion size is smallish, and yes too expensive. 
I also downgraded them for having the air conditioning on and the front door open on the first warm day of this year.   They might attract some customers with that, but they lost this one."}
{"text":"One of the worst customer service experience I've ever had. Very bad handling of big groups and concerns. Stood there and did nothing as a patron threw a fit at another patron leading to injury and blood shed. They need security and better training for all staff."}
{"text":"Not a bad place to go if you're early for a movie or have just come out of a movie. It's a good place to go for a nice relaxing evening if you just want to catch up with a couple of friends or just want to sit and knock a couple brews down. It's kind of dark inside and the crowd is more laid back. You won't pick up many girls in this place and there are a bunch of old people who come to drink at the bar. The food was ok. Nothing that completely blew me out of the world but nothing that was bad. The burgers were ok. There is just nothing really special about going here unless you're in the area with a couple of friends and just want to catch up on times."}
{"text":"I'm coming from the United States for vacation as a tourist here at Toronto Canada came in with friends who are locals to the Duke of Kent where unfortunately the experience was not very good the pub was crowded and dirty and as a tourist they don't accept foreign IDs which made the experience terrible and management was not helpful at all after explaining how ridiculous that is being that I'm way over the age limit to have one single beer. So to sum up avoid the Duke of Kent"}
{"text":"After a long day of meetings, my team and I needed drinks. We headed to the closest intersection; Yonge and Eglinton. We found the Duke of Kent and decided to check it out. 

We were immediately seated in a booth. It was a loud Thursday night, games were on and people were chatting. We ordered the first round of drinks, the drinks came right away. The reason why the Duke of Kent gets 3 stars is because the food was very very average. My friend ordered fish and chips, which he said were good. I ordered the chicken fingers, pretty average - tastes like something out of a box. The apps we got were very meh. The popcorn shrimp was okay, the sweet potato fries were good and the Nacho Cheese sticks looked like a dog biscuit. 

I would only come here for drinks and it wouldn't be my first option. 

Keep Eating, 

Angela"}
{"text":"Duke of Kent is one of my \"last-resort\" kinda bars. I find the food and drinks fairly overpriced and the ambience isn't anything that special in my opinion. The food portions are small but I will admit I love the idea of the snack portions. The steak was very good, cooked wonderfully medium rare and seasoned nicely. The calamari was meh, not crispy as the batter was very thin.

Last time I came here with my boyfriend we were seating in a horrible spot downstairs close to the side door and almost every time someone opened it, it would stay open for a few seconds making it very chilly! We left our jackets on the whole night. I also had a fly fly into my beer - ew! I came here another time with a bunch of friends and my table was seated upstairs and we were left freezing cold whenever the AC cranked on - we do believe they had issues with the AC as it felt like winter. I'm not sure if I'm just really unlucky with this place but I definitely haven't had great experiences (or seating arrangements!) here."}
{"text":"Wicked two-level neighbourhood pub with always friendly service. If you're eating here, three words: chicken pot pie!!! The secret ingredient is bacon (just enough to add great flavour to the filling) and it's topped off with flakey puff pastry. Goes down so well with a pint."}
{"text":"This is one of the \"Duke of\" franchises that found the previously independent Duke of Kent and brought some smallish changes to the pub.  One thing that has not changed is the sense of local flavour.  The regulars who came in, blabbed about English and Scottish football ('soccer' for the Philistines among us), had a pint of whatever they fancied on tap, and carried on as long as possible.

Despite having been brought into the collective of pubs, there is still a strong sense of independence about this place.  The menu has been taken over and franchised a bit (I'd never heard of \"Bombay Curry Rolls\" before, but I'm glad they're here now), the pictures of locals whose soccer teams have been sponsored have moved downstairs in favour of new British-esque iconography (\"Oh, Goodness!  My Guinness!\"), but it's still a good place to hang out.

They have now opened the upstairs into provide more seating with a bar for direct service as well so you're not waiting for your pint to ascend the staircase.  Admittedly this may have been there before, but to be completely honest I never ventured past the main bar on the first floor.  No need, really.  The place still feels homey, the food is now somewhat gentrified, but it's still a good place to meet up.  The heart is still there."}
{"text":"It was another beautiful day and we were on the hunt for a decent, uncovered patio. (It's actually pretty shocking how many patios cover up most of their seating with umbrellas and the like; if it's a sunny day, I want that sun hitting my face.)

Anyway, we wound up at the Duke of Kent's cozy patio. Aside from sharing a tasty sangria, we also decided to sample three of the offerings from their Basket Bites menu: Deep-Fried Pepperoni, Popcorn Shrimp, and Curry Basket.

I was especially intrigued by the Deep-Fried Pepperoni for obvious reasons. And impressively enough, it did not disappoint one bit. The flavorful, spicy pepperoni's been cut into discs and deep fried, which ensures that each bite packs a crunchiness that's nothing short of irresistible. The accompanying honey-mustard sauce was tasty, too.

The Popcorn Shrimp was a little by-the-numbers in its execution, while the Curry Basket is pretty decent yet lacking in the bold flavors one might've anticipated.

Still, the most excellent patio ensures that I'll be returning often."}
{"text":"The Duke of Kent is a convenient location for those in the Yonge and Eglinton area who are in the mood for a pleasant but not super sensational meal. That being said it's usually pretty bumpin' in here, even on weeknights. The Moroccan Stew ($14.99) is a great comfort meal in winter."}
{"text":"Duke of Kent is a cool pub, with good food and reasonable (although not bargain-basement) prices.  It can get pretty busy on the main floor, but the second floor is quieter and roomier if you are less interested in socializing (or just want to be able to hear your date).

Service here is solid and the food is reasonably high quality (by pub standards).  I can recommend the chicken pot pie, the club sandwich, the burgers, and the sweet potato fries.  There is a decent selection of beer on tap as well as wines by the glass. 

Dinner for two with a pint each will run you about $50 with tax and tip included."}
{"text":"A decent pub to hang out at if all the other places around are busy. For me, this is more of a \"last resort\" pub/restaurant. The staff was friendly and the atmosphere was of a normal pub with booths, tables and a bar. There is also a patio on the side of the restaurant.

I ordered the fish and chips (half portion) and it was filling enough for lunch. The bloody caesar was very spicy and salt (ease up on the Worcestershire and Tabasco!)  The fish batter was somewhat greasy, but edible. The highlight for me was the coleslaw. Very creamy, rich, crunchy, and just the right amount of acidity.

Overall, like I said, I'd probably return as a last resort."}
{"text":"I have lived in the Yonge & Eglinton area now for almost a year. Due to a tight budget my girlfriend and I have only been to the Duke of Kent a handful of times.  Each time we've gone though, the food has been amazing and the service and staff was impeccable.

The burgers, nachos, deep fried pickles, their food selection is amazing. Not to mention they have a great list of beers in bottles and on tap.

For those who have watched \"Shaun of The Dead\", my girlfriend and I have jokingly referred to the Duke of Kent as \"The Winchester\". As it is now our \"go to\" place for food. Especially now that we moved roughly two buildings away."}
{"text":"Just when I thought pub food wasn't so bad, my prior convictions were confirmed. Yes, there's a reason I only ate Indian food when I lived in London! I was starting to think the presence of curry on a pub menu was reason for a second opinion.

We went to the Duke of Kent for Sunday brunch on Mother's Day, orphans that we are. I was perplexed by the fruit kebab sticks-- the texture was just-thawed-- mushy on the outside. The spinach, on the other hand, was still partially frozen in my eggs florentine! my friend's meal was even less impressive, his french toast looked so...defeated! No fluffiness- it had collapsed in the middle and looked quite chewy.

I left hungry."}
{"text":"Went here with my colleague three months ago.  Food was good, drinks were served fast, the waitress was nice.  Liked the atmosphere, and location is premium. 
Not too crowded either, although it was lunch time."}
{"text":"Ok the Duke isn't a band pub at all. 

- It has a patio
- It has two floors
- It has a lot of regulars
- It often has game nights (upstairs)
- The staff haven't really changed in over a year

Pints, yes, lots of them. Food, not bad at all at reasonable prices (do friday lunches here with a work crew very often). Occasionally, they will have a unique draught.

It's a Yonge and Eg pub and it's not bad at all."}
{"text":"A pretty nice spot to get together with friends. They have all the beer in the world but my best part is the calamari starter and the house burger. They have good food considering pub food is usually crap. The ambiance is nice too and yeah you can sit outside too."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars 

VIBE 
Pubby. Inside, it's loud, boisterous and dark like a good English pub should be. 
Staff is on and off. Sometimes quick; sometimes not. 
I do love the quiz nights that happen here. Good fun. 
The upstairs level is a bit more conducive to conversation though the seating is not as comfortable. 

WE ATE
I love the mini snack menu that they have here. So for example, if I don't want a big heaping hunk of fish and chips, I can get a two mini portions of halibut and a small packet of fries for $5 (instead of $10 to $12). This is such a smart idea and I hope more pubs come out with a concept like this. Plus, the fish and chips were delish! 
Of course, the beer selection is plentiful but I don't venture outside of my normal zone of Heineken. 

OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK
No Kents but great company and cozy atmosphere. Plus, very central to Yonge and Eg. I approve!"}
{"text":"Yummy food, pretty good value. I'm a fan of the sandwiches. 

The cocktail menu is pretty decent for a pub.

Good option if you're in the area and want pub food."}
{"text":"The entrance to the pub is accessible and located at the corner of Yonge and Roehampton Ave. It's close to the TTC Eglinton Station and there's a parking garage nearby. Traffic is pretty bad right now, though, due to The Eglinton LRT Metrolinx construction. I ordered a Mini Burger, which comes with fries. The burger was good and the fries were your average pub fries. I was sitting at table near a half wall. The waitress was nice enough but she took a long to time to take my order and clear the dishes, and take my payment. She commented that she kept skipping me because I was in the corner. I wanted to order desert but everything except the cheesecake, which I don't like, had caramel. All in all, it's your typical pub."}
{"text":"Hubby & I came here for lunch. I was craving a burger & fries but didn't know what was good in the area. I had the 3 slider appetizer which was topped with onions & I had a side order of fries. The sliders were more bun than burger & the buns weren't even warm. The onions were barely carmelized. The fries were okay. Hubby ordered the hot dog appetizer & in the picture there were two but he only got one. Decent food but not spectacular on this occasion. Waitress was nice, helpful & prompt."}
{"text":"A great local bar that is always full of fun and is great for catching a game at.  The bar has two levels with the upstairs filling up at night with locals of the area.  They have moosehead keiths on tap as well as guiness but no jäger or Canadian.  I would highly recommend the nachos with real jalapeño and the sweet potato fries.  There is a dinner menu of you arrive early but it fills up starting around 10pm to last call most nights.  They don't take reservations during busy seasons and holidays so it's first come first serve.

PS.

This is not a quiet bar as some people found out the other night when my group's party filled up half the second floor, so expect to not be able to hear half of what's going on."}
{"text":"As a lifelong Coronation Street fan, I have always hoped to find my own Rover's Return Inn. Corrie fans are already familiar with the place; it's the tattered old pub where half the 'action' occurs. Blood is seldom spilled on the hideous carpets, but plots are advanced through well-lubricated complaints and gossip. 

The Rovers Return features a revolving door of owners and saucy bar staff, and specializes in packets of crisps and something called Betty's Hot Pot, which I imagine is something like Soylent Green. It's where the halfway attractive characters end up, to make way for more plotlines involving Norris' ambiguous sexuality and Gail's penchant for choosing literally self-destructive men (seriously; she doesn't even have to kill them. They just drop like flies).

Coronation Street generally appears not to be a destination for foodies. There are token Indian, Chinese and Italian places, but they lie outside of mainstream Corrie consciousness-if you've ever read Stephen King's \"The Fog\" you'll get the idea. It's a decidedly uncool Britannia; outside the purview Jamie Oliver's Food Revolution; a purgatory next to Hell's Kitchen; a search for adequacy rather than the perfection sought by Heston Blumenthal.

But I digress, except to say that for all it's faults, the idea of the local persists. If such a thing can be applied to Toronto, the Duke of Kent would be mine. I say \"if\" because the following points fall outside my Coronation Street frame of reference:

A)      There's actually places closer to my apartment.
B)      It's part of a chain (would \"Cheers\" have been as memorable if it had been set in a TGI Fridays?\")
C)      I'm neither alcoholic, nor do I drink until alcohol poisoning sets in (which seem like distinct possibilities given the amount of time the Streeters spend bending elbows).

The Duke offers a good beer selection, with fresh new taps introduced regularly. The odd time one gets an off pitcher, it is quickly replaced.  Pricing is at the high end of average. Wine is available, but misses the point.

At brunch, people order Bloody Caesars and Mimosas, only because Guinness might be a bit too heavy at 11 AM, and indifferent bacon-and-egg platters require washing down.

The Duke of Kent's menu embodies the Coronation Street spirit. Pub standards, American bar food, and weekly specials promising creative use of local ingredients. 

Chicken curry is politely spicy, and sometimes finds its way into spring roll wraps as a curiously addictive appetizer. Salads may be fresh and crisp, or drearily wilted, or worse-insufficiently dried. Sandwiches featuring roast chicken or turkey require gobs of mayo to make up for dry bird, and a freer hand with the bacon is urged. Fish and chips is by-the-number, served in newsprinty wax paper. 

Hummus is just plain wrong and has no business on a pub menu, but sweet potato fries come crisp and fluffy, sided with maple chipotle mayo. Nachos may be the evening's highlight; piled high and drenched with cheese and chopped veg; standard bottled salsa, guacamole and sour cream nestled in tortilla cups. Chilli or grilled chicken can be added for a modest fee. Chicken wings and fingers are undistinguished, and often overcooked.

So it's not gourmet, despite occasional flourishes. The Duke's success lies in the genuinely friendly environment cultivated n a corporate space. On the ground floor, rosy-cheeked regulars celebrate life's smallest milestones: the end of a workday, the beginning of hockey season, the passing-through of friends. A patio curls around the side of the pub, off Yonge street. It is most often occupied by first-daters looking to people-watch while they avoid eye contact. Upstairs, there's a second bar that hosts Tuesday night trivia, among other things. This is where I find my local; with friends I like better each week, and the occasional chance to sound like I know what I'm talking about."}
{"text":"Came in here for some drinks before a movie last night.  It is your standard pub.  It was really busy but we were politely escorted to the only free table by the manager.  I like when businesses do that.  Makes you feel special and important.  I have been here before for food and I recall it being decent.  I like the location of this place the most.  It is in a lively area with lots to do and right by a subway stop."}
{"text":"Food: 3 stars
Got the Benedict here off the brunch menu and it was your standard eggs Benedict with peameal bacon. Meal came with a side of potato pancakes and a small serving of fruit. Potato pancakes were very delicious and crispy! Peameal bacon was pretty yummy...well, it IS bacon but I thought it was better than most places I've had it at. 
The portions were kind of small and the Hollandaise sauce didn't really have any flavour.


Ambiance: 3 stars
Nice pub interior with mainly wooden accents and dark-coloured carpet floors. Like the decor but it seemed like they tried to cram too many tables into the place. We got a table by the window facing Eglinton on a platform area with a couple of stairs leading up to it. The table was really tiny and we were really close to the table next to us. The table next to us was actually partially blocking our way off the platform area. Fire hazard? Mixed feelings about the place. 

Service: 4 stars
Our waitress was wonderful and friendly. What made her stand out to me was when I asked for hot water and she asked if I wanted hot or lukewarm warm water. Shows that she was being attentive. I can't remember all the times I've gotten boiling hot water when I asked for warm water."}
{"text":"Came back for my second try at the Eggs Benedict.  This time around the were perfect; everything I could want in Eggs Benedict.  And let me reiterate that the staff are terrific, fun n friendly.  Duke of Kent will definitely be my hang out when I'm in this neighbourhood."}
{"text":"I like my duke of kent. It's up the street from home so it's mine, don't argue with my backwoods logic.

Staff is sweet and on hands, couple jokers on a good day. 

The inside is a bit grimy but the duke's got a decent patio that gives on Roehampton, as well as loads of seating inside. 

Lots on tap. What self respecting pub wouldn't have that.

But as for the food, meh. That's where the stars disappear sadly. I heard from the waiters that the sliders are terrible, but I can confirm the nachos that they recommend are pretty bad too. Even chicken couldn't save them. Tasteless. 
The poutine is a travesty.
The burger is bland. 

If it wasn't for staff, location and limited patio days, I would give the duke two stars.


I RECOMMEND: sticking to beer. And maybe the fish and chips. It's sometimes overdone but mostly a safe bet.

EXTRA TIP: Smoking allowed on the patio. Lucky me. Yes I see the irony."}
{"text":"I have lived here in Toronto for 3 months and passed this pub a few times at first. Then we ventured in when my old maw came over from Glasgow Scotland, & my wife's mum from Brazil (separately). I've genuinely lost count of how many times I've been in since, but it's from the sunny beer gardens catching the rays in fall at 4pm most days to the likes of the cold days now where we are so at home and on first name terms with the managers and most of the staff.
This review is not just to boost them up, but this is genuinely for credit where credit is due. The girls serving at the bar and the tables are so happy, chatty and attentive to all needs. Even when I say my mum has hearing disabilities and we are kindly given a quiet zone through the back. Easy to catch the eye of our table hostess, and are never waiting long for our orders. 
I was dubious at first with the authentic British style pub look (which is why I took so long to enter) but it has an amazing, friendly, and on game days electric atmosphere. If fact there has been one occassion we passed to go to the pub up the road just for a change but it was so empty we returned and we were so glad we did.
The food for tradition pub grub is the bees-knees, (4.9* 9.5/10 fandabidozi) fantastic, even the striploin steak which I normally wait for a steak house was amazing. Don't forget the sweet potato fries. Wow! 
I have had the burgers, steak, poutine, bacon caesar salad and their fish n chips. I loved them all, especially washed down with good pint of their West Coast Mill Street IPA. I can never seem to change it up. The drink and beer selection is extensive also.
I am enjoying this place so much not only is it our local but we are now having a birthday function in the amazing upstairs room with their own bar I didn't even know existed until my last time in there, and now they are open for Xmas day it's looking good for that too.
I don't always have the finances to eat or drink out at the moment but when I do, it's a 98% certainty it will be there at the D.O.K.
Nialle, Kate and all the staff thanks for the endless hospitality you have always shown my family and I before we even spoke, and please thank all the girls too, you can't do it without them. Until the next time. Slanja/cheers."}
{"text":"Have some time to kill and a growling stomach, I decided to drop by Duke of Kent for a pre dinner drink which ended up to be a pre dinner snack too! 

For a Wednesday evening, this pub was surprisingly busy. The bar area was packed, so I ended up sitting at one of the tables at the back of the room. 

Duke of Kent is really single friendly has they have $4/$5/$6 little bites or appetizer which are portioned for individuals if no one going to share that $13 nachos with me! 

Decent selections of beer, nothing really fancy but one would have find something they enjoy. 

Mini Burger and Fries ($4) looks really cute. It tasted decently good a lot better than some other pub food I had. 

Services was friendly and prompt. I was served the moment I sat down and the server checked on me a few time making sure I was happy with everything... which I don't really expect in a pub! 

I definitely would come back to Duke of Kent for a drink! Too bad the weather is getting cold to enjoy their nice patio!"}
{"text":"ACTUALLY No stars!!! But Yelp Wong allow
a post without assigning a * 
Yesterday a friend and I met up for drinks and a bite at this establishment based on a recommendation. We walked in around 7pm and was greeted right away by the host or possibly the manager. He was friendly and easily let us choose where we wanted to sit. So we walked over to a table by the windows and took a seat. The drinks menu was already at the table so we proceeded to peruse and decided on something. Then we waited and waited and waited. 5 minutes passed and no one came to provide food menus nor take our drink orders. Not even bring water or a hello to acknowledge that we were there. We waited another 5 minutes (now 10 min in total) and looked around spotting 3 waitresses, a bartender behind bar and the same host guy fraternizing with other patrons (much younger women at the bar). We watched as the wait staff kept walking around the back half of the place, chatting to each other and stacking menus.  But never looked our way. Btw, the place was only 1/4 full including the patrons on the bar rail. I could understand if they were slammed and/or under staffed but they were not. Shortly after we got up and left the joint. Finding ourselves giving our $ & business to the other pub just up the street."}
{"text":"Excellent food Moroccan stew was the best I came with my youngest daughter,and the manager Mark on the floor politely took us upstairs in the quite area which I really appreciate his offer.   Excellent service I recommended to family friends :)"}
{"text":"Came to this place with a couple of coworkers after work. Convenient location ..just north of yonge n eg. Very busy. Great fish and chips. Great service but just wish it was bigger!"}
{"text":"Food is very basic here. Nothing really stood out to me . Drinks more on the pricy side . Only good part is close to movie theatre and subway station."}
{"text":"I Decided to go out last minute for st patty's day. I recently moved to the yonge and finch area and decided to take a drive with my best friend down yonge to see the first place that looked like a nice place to enjoy this festive day! All I really cared for was good food, great music and of course my Guinness well spending quality girl time is always a nice added bonus. I have to first say I found that here. 

This was our first time here and probably won't be our last. We were very lucky to snatch the last table in the bar. A few couples came in after and we're told there is a wait list. 
For our appetizer we ordered the deep fried pickles (AMAZING) and perogies (GOOD). I was happy to see they knew how to get the pickles right. I've been to other places where the breading would fall off after I bite into them. This was not the case here. The perogies were standard, nothing to special with them besides the cone dish these two appetizers were served in.
For our main dish I ordered the fish and chips and my friend ordered a burger. The slogan for the fish and chips was \"this is what made us famouse\" and YES it does.. I couldn't believe how good they were.. almost made me feel as if I was back in London, England.. my friend had no complaints with her burger either. 

We were pleased the Manger came around a few times to make sure everything was great with our meal and service. That's what I call customer service! When our waitress went on break he came to inform us and asked if we needed anything so I ordered another pint and sure enough within minutes it arrived by my server. Great0 communication and service on such a busy night. The place was packed but the staff seemed to have it under control, well that's what it looked like to me anyways.

I will return on a low key night for sure!"}
{"text":"Came here after work at around 6:30pm, and we were greeted instantly the moment we walked in the restaurant.

The moment we were seated - near the kitchen area on the ground floor, I had noticed a funky smell. It kind of smelled like dirty rags, like ones which have been used to wipe the table too many times and have never been washed. Maybe it was the smell from the carpets? Not sure but there was a smell and it made me really uncomfortable.

So we ordered something quick - 15 wings and two drinks. I did not want to order anything that will take a long time as I was starting to get sick from the smell.

The wings were good - tasted like wings you would normally get from a bar. It smelled a lot spicier than it tasted though. Our drinks were good; I mean, you can't really go wrong with getting beer on tap.

Overall, I was really uncomfortable during my quick meal here. The tables were small and it seemed like our utensils and plates were going to fall off the table. We had to be really careful when reaching for our napkins as things can easily be knocked off our table. And the smell. I'm still not sure where the smell was coming from by the end of our meal but I could still smell it. It was not a pleasing smell, and as result of this, we were in and out in less than 40 minutes.
 

...Maybe bars just aren't my thing."}
{"text":"A good spot for drinks after work but the food is better avoided.  Especially watch out for the edamame.  It looks like it was picked at infancy, frozen for a 100 years and then thawed out in a scorching desert.  It tasted worse."}

{"text":"Went there last night. Was crowded, but I don't have any issue with it. The servers were great! But the food wasn't good at all.
I ordered the following:

Calamari--- it seemed like there was no salt or any sort of seasoning on them. I think if they had just used some salt and pepper , it wouldn't have tasted so bland

Quesadilla --- it was just ok. They gave four pieces on a plate with no sides. No sour cream,  no salsa dip, no guacamole , no lettuce, no nothing. It just boring.

Mini sliders--- for some reason they smelled. Not sure how to explain but it was more like how kerosene oil smells. I took one bite and left it.

I would never eat here again.

But let me tell you. The host on each floor was great! This guy on the first floor and the girl on the ground floor each were good."}
