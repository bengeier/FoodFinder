{"text":"The Bacon Beer Cheese bread AMAZING! Quite literally my new food obsession. They partnered with Great Dane Brewery and you can really taste and smell the delicious beer flavor. Not sure what the yellow cheese is, but it's a hidden golden treasure! Also tried the peach blackberry bar and the fruit was super fresh and moist-Excellent again! The scones instead of crumbling and drying your mouth out, were flavorful, soft and fresh. Still have yet to try a few other breads and scones we got, but so far everything has been great! My recommendation would be to go to Great Harvest and enjoy!"}
{"text":"We went to a kids class day at this bakery and it was so wonderful. My daughter had the most wonderful time and we are still enjoying the delicious treats we brought home. The staff was so wonderfully patient and kind to the kids and my daughter left with a new excitement about baking and helping in the kitchen. It was truly a wonderful day for both of us and we will definitely be back! The cinnamon chip bread was our favorite! Thanks for the wonderful time and the fantastic customer service!"}
{"text":"Great bakery with delicious breads and sandwiches! My kids loving going and getting a free sample of bread and butter. We love getting fresh, healthy sandwiches for lunch and usually end up taking home a loaf or two. They also have delicious cookies and great gift ideas for friends/ neighbors/ teachers :)"}
{"text":"GHB has the best fresh baked bread! Love the High Fiber and the cinnamon chip breads. And the morning glory muffins are so yummy! Friendly staff and quick service."}
{"text":"I had a really good club sandwich made 3 different breads And an awesome 3 berry scone.   Looking forward to my next eye appointment so that I can eat there again."}
{"text":"As soon as we walked in, we were greeted with smiles and a warm welcome! We were offered a slice of coconut walnut bread......absolutely delicious!  We picked up our Dakota loaf and let me tell you....it was perfect!  I've never held a loaf that weighed that much!   We special ordered hoagie rolls (wheat & white), for pick up the next afternoon. These rolls held ALL of the ingredients of the sandwich and did not get soggy!!   Fantastic bread and service! We will be back!  ***see attached photo for their YELP Contest!***"}
{"text":"I love this bakery for an easy and tasty lunch during the work week. There is rarely a line, and the sandwiches are seriously delicious. I love to get half a sandwich and cookie (which are enormous and incredibly good!). The service is always great, and often the cashier will offer samples of the pastries and cookies while waiting for a sandwich. All around great place!"}
{"text":"Wonderful place!!!  GREAT service and even better bread.  Wish I lived closer but will be here often when I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"Great customer service knowledgable staff and had the 'Rachel'/Rueben based on recommendation of staff and it was great.  Free fountain drink with check-in didn't hurt either."}
{"text":"I just had the turkey pesto sandwich on sourdough. VERY YUM. They do a great job and are very nice too. They gave me a HUGE sample of their lemon-poppy seed bread that had a glaze icing on top. It was also VERY GOOD,  and I can tell you that it took all my will power not to buy a loaf."}
{"text":"Sandwiches are delicious and bread is always fresh and free of preservatives.  Great customer service, too!"}
{"text":"Their bread is amazing! The smell as you walk in the door is heavenly! They have many different types of bread, but my favorite is the Dakota. Everything I've had there is yummy! Their customer service is excellent. You can tell they love baking bread and know a lot about it. You can't help smiling while you're in there, because their joy is contagious. And you will never leave without a sample!"}
{"text":"The service was great and the sandwhiches were delicious and healthy and the cookies were soooo good"}
{"text":"Best sandwich in Vegas! Excellent, friendly service. Worth a visit if you're in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Best honey whole wheat bread you can find.  They also make a wonderful variety of fun breads like the breakfast blast (made with bits of dates), spinach feta, and peanut butter chocolate chip bread (best trail snack ever!).  Sandwiches and salads are also fresh and delicious.  They're also very friendly and will even bake by request."}
{"text":"For anyone who is Gluten Free, they make 3 different GF breads on Tuesdays only.  They sell out quickly!  They are very thorough in their preparation and baking to ensure there are zero traces of gluten, hence why they only bake it one day a week.  It's by far the best GF bread that my wife and I have found anywhere."}
{"text":"Awesome breads! Make sure to check what the breads of the day are. Spinach Feta loaf on Wednesdays are where it's at!"}
{"text":"The people are very nice and the bread is great. However, if you're there for a meal, there us always a long wait even though it's never busy. Sandwiches are about the size that you would make at home. Acceptable, but probably not worth the more than $8 price tag. Especially considering that drinks and sides are not included. I have visited five times at this point, because it is very conveniently located near my workplace. The experience has been fairly consistent. One item of note: I ordered a buffalo chicken sandwich once. Instead of deli meat, it had strips of chicken that I'm fairly certain came out of a can. I would not recommend that sandwich. The others have been good or very good."}
{"text":"I absolutely adore this spot. I have visited several times and tasted a variety of sandwiches and baked goods. The food and the customer service are both consistently excellent. My favorites are: the tuna sandwich, california cobb sandwich, lemon blueberry bar, and carrot cake. Not to mention the bread - loaves upon loaves of fresh gloriousness. There's limited seating inside and a few tables outside. Definitely stop by if you're in the area. They close at 6pm."}
{"text":"This bakery speaks for itself. Go try it. You will not leave unhappy. Sandwiches, fresh bread and desserts. Get out of your home and try them"}
{"text":"I love the Turkey Goddess sandwich here.  It is SO GOOD!  It has smoked turkey, avocado, greens and herbs, and a slice of Havarti cheese) I usually get it on Dakota bread (delicious, hearty bread with lots of kinds of seeds).  I would also highly recommend the High Five fiber bread with cranberries. I really like the  friendly staff and the fact that you can try a slice of bread while you're waiting to order. That's how I found out about the High Five fiber bread!   They have a \"punch card\" loyalty system here where you get a stamp for every sandwich or loaf of bread you buy.  It's nice to know that repeat customers are appreciated!  Another thing I like about Great Harvest is that they grind the flour for their breads fresh every day.  You can definitely taste the difference!"}
{"text":"I love their bread. I normally buy the Cheddar Cheese and Sour Dough. I have not eaten at this location but I have at their other store. Loved their Pastrami sandwich."}
{"text":"This place is literally the worst sandwich shop.  I live right around the corner so I've been here a half dozen times hoping that it will get better...and it doesn't.  The sandwiches are bare and when I ordered the turkey avocado, there was no avocado on it.  This isn't the first time something like this has happened at this store but it's definitely the last.  I only recommend coming here if you want expensive but good bread.  However, I'm sure you could find cheaper elsewhere."}
{"text":"Talking about wonderful bread...and their sandwiches are really good too. As soon as you walk into Great Harvest Bread, they greet you and ask if you would like to sample whatever it is they have fresh that day. At the Horizon Ridge location, it's a lot (not that way at all locations). When they say sample, they don't mean just a small sample, they cut this giant size chunk off of whatever it is you wanted, which is always wonderful.   The sandwiches are always great, made to order, with fresh meats, cheeses, whatever you want. The bread is just incredibly soft and fresh and this location always has a good selection.   I must also mention that this location has very friendly people working as well. It is very comfortable and clean as well. Try their specialty breads during various holidays (like green monster fingers at Halloween)...great stuff!"}
{"text":"I realize Great Harvest is a franchise, but this location has the best couple that run the store, that it's head and shoulders above the others that I have been to.  The breads are so yummy - the spinach feta is my favorite, closely followed by the savory loaf.  My daughter went nuts for the apple crumble.  This was my go-to sandwich place when I worked nearby, and I never got tired of it.  The sandwiches are so fresh and customized to exaclty what the customer wants.  And one cannot forget the sweets - the oatmeal chocolate chip cookies are fantastic, as is the chocolate chip scone."}
{"text":"They claim they make sandwiches between 10:30 and 2:30. I don't believe it is an offering, although they claim they do offer them. Every time I have been in there, during their so-called sandwich time, they aren't making them. It's one excuse after another. We're short staffed, the sandwich guy called in sick, etc. It's not all that difficult to take two pieces of bread and slap meat and cheese on it. It has been challenging to get one.   New day...new try.... sandwiches are supposedly from 10:30 - 2:30.... I called at 10:37am...Me: \"are you making sandwiches today?\"  Them: \"yes, but not until 11:00am).  So, I get there at 11:05am........ They aren't making sandwiches until 1pm!!!!  I CALLED and was told 11!!!  I have legitimately tried to get a sandwich from this place. It has been an epic fail each time.  Go to Crunch Bistro instead....they make sandwiches!"}
{"text":"They make the best challah bread I've ever had in my life! They're white chocolate cherry bread is also amazing. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Seriously give this place a try! I live close and always pass by. thought it was some plain Jane no flavor place (honestly I did) I love to try crazy things but my friend insisted we go. The sandwiches are so good and omg all the bread and cookies! You can ask for samples of anything, They make their bread fresh daily. The sandwich reminded me of the best possible homemade sammich you can ever make... My mouths watering now"}
{"text":"I love their almost all the products. My favorite is Pumkin bread. Only if I can ignre the calories and how rich it is.. Can enjoy. When I get the treat from Here I boost my work out and love to eat this.."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches. Friendly staff. I would recommend. Only negative if you go later in day they may be out of menu items. They sell out quick."}
{"text":"Delicious breads. Wonderful sandwiches. Picked up lunch to take on the road into Death Valley. What a great choice! Service was kind and friendly. Restaurant and facilities were very clean."}
{"text":"As a student and connoisseur of the breakfast sandwich I give this one five stars.  Cheddar garlic biscuit, choice of meat and cheese, and great egg.  And....get this, under five bucks."}
{"text":"Used Great Harvest for Christmas gifts this year and they turned out amazing.  They looked great and were exactly what we wanted for a great price.  Can't wait to use for Christmas again next year."}
{"text":"Everything is amazing! It sounds too good to be true, but it isn't! We don't eat much bread (we can't be trusted!), but this is the 1st place we think of when we're craving complex carbohydrates. Luckily (or unluckily) enough, this place is right around the corner from our house, so we've probably been there a few dozen times since we moved to GVR in 2004.  Pumpkin-anything is my favorite (esp pumpkin-chocolate-chip bread!), but the giant cinnamon roll is fantastic as well (I think it's called cinnamon swirl, not to be confused with the actual cinnamon rolls which are also phenomenal). Not sure how frequently they make them, but the brownie is hands-down the *best* brownie you can buy! My husband's *in love* with the chocolate-cherry bread they make (I think it's avail Mondays, but not sure). There literally isn't anything I've had there that's less than 4.5 or 5 stars out of 5.  We also stopped in yesterday for a little something, and got an oatmeal-chocolate-chip cookie to split. It was heavenly; 2nd only to their brownie, which wasn't available.  Chewy, yet crunchy; not too many chocolate chips, not too much oatmeal; not greasy at all. Yet another thing to love about this place.  BTW, if you've never had one of their cookies, they're gigantic! And, the free sample is every bit as great as the other reviewers have said. For us, the staff is always great; very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Great food, coffee. Wonderful atmosphere. A quality staff that keep the dining area and rest room very clean. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Awesome customer service!  Spoke with the owner, who is originally from Canada living the American dream.  Highly recommended, good luck.  Cheers"}
{"text":"Love this place. We've been coming here for over a year now and always get high quality bread. Love bringing some of their specialty bread to work for potlucks and such. Haven't had a sandwich yet but would assume it's good. Service is always top notch and everyone is friendly. Love the free samples."}
{"text":"Visited this place for the first time with my 2 1/2 year old son. And let me just say He loved his turkey & ham sandwich. Their sandwiches are very fresh, that includes everything from the freshly baked bread and the vegetables they use. I will definitely be a regular here."}
{"text":"Great Harvest seriously has the best Bread in town! It's amazing and so delicious! Their Pumpkin Spice Bread makes my heart happy. I've tried it all and have loved everything! Even the sandwiches! Excellent owners and manager; always kind, friendly, helpful, and polite! I'd recommend this bakery to anyone. :)"}
{"text":"Ordered the turk and berry sandwich and turkey pesto sandwich! They are so good the sourdough is fantastic! The pesto is a perfect addition to the turkey sandwich and who does not love cranberry with turkey!!!!!"}
{"text":"I am giving this 2 stars just because of the lady that took our order.  She was the only good thing about this lunch.  We ordered two turkey sandwiches that should have peppers, balsamic, lettuce , tomatoes.  Half of my sandwich had little to no meat on it.  Other was very skinny.  This sandwich is 8 dollars. I just wish I would have taken a picture.  Kitchen needs to make sandwiches the same every time.  Looking around Salads looked good. Cookies great.  Maybe I will go back for the bread but sandwiches way to expensive for quality."}
{"text":"The bread, and by extension the sandwiches are amazing. Be warned that the biscuits are fairly salty. The coffee is meh and the Chai latte is flavored instead of brewed, so avoid that. Definitely worth it for the good though!"}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorites! Delicious bread, sandwiches, cookies, you name it. My personal favorites are the challah bread and sugar cookies. So yummy! I love that I get a free slice of bread with every visit and the people behind the counter are always friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Found this place after a patient of my husband gifted him a box of the most delicious white chocolate chip pumpkin cookies.  They were the best cookies that we fought over them.  Saw the  name of the bakery on the box and drove from the city of Maricopa the next day.  I think I purchased $40 on my first visit.  Bought 2 loaves after taste test and more sweet treats for the family.  That was 2009, and I still stop by occasionally.  My mother worked in the food industry so, needless to say I don't like to take her out to eat because she will criticize immensely to the server if the food doesn't meet to her standards.  She actually loved the Dakota bread and the packaged rolls.  She nagged me every week until she returned to Hawaii to buy her the Dakota bread."}
{"text":"Great Harvest remains the best baker of wholesome, flavorful breads. I've been a devoted customer since the 90's, and always search out a Great Harvest where I go. Love the locations in Tempe, as well as Missoula, Montana, and the Willamette Valley, Oregon."}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favorite lunch spots in Vegas! Free bread samples when you come in with a healthy brush of butter?! Yes, please!   Everything that I've had here is delicious! The sandwiches - on point, quality ingredients on fresh made bread.   Cookies - SOOOO GOOD!! The oatmeal chocolate chip is crispy around the edges, with a soft center.  Bread - You can buy their freshly made loaves of bread, my favorites are the pizza roll and spinach feta. Certain breads are made on specific days, so check online for what is being made if you plan on getting a loaf!"}
{"text":"Leslie and her family took time out of their long day to teach our girl scout troop about the art of bread making today.   They were kind and generous to us.   What a wonderful experience for our troop.   We are very grateful.   And the Apple bread is so yummy! Love the value this business brings to the community.  Thank you Great Harvest."}
{"text":"Their sandwiches are awesome and you can have a free piece of fresh baked bread while you wait. I had a slice of banana bread today while I waited and it was simply delicious!   I always get turkey on wheat and even though I like Subway, this is so much better! The veggies are always super fresh and tasty and the basil mayo is outstanding.  You can also purchase loaves of their delicious breads, but I have not done that (yet).  The service is always very, very good and staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"Fantastic little bread shop! My girlfriend and I were given a free sample when I inquired about the cinnamon burst bread (delicious by the way). Originally came in for some quick coffee but will absolutely be coming back for some of that cinnamon burst bread as well as some pumpkin bread!"}
{"text":"Having developed a gluten intolerance later in life, one of the biggest things I miss is really good bread. Most gluten free breads on the market just don't hit the mark, whether the texture is off or it just doesn't taste quite right. After trying their gluten-free/friendly cinnamon bread, I'm in heaven! I honestly can't tell it's gluten free. The best is to have a slice toasted with butter. Sooooo delicious! It kind of reminds me a little of a coffee cake. You have to try it!!!"}
{"text":"Great service and food. Perfect pastrami and turk n' berry sandwich was delish! Can't go wrong with the red, white, blueberry loaf!"}
{"text":"Was on the hunt for some new place to try with the hubby and this came up on Yelp.  THE PLACE: Quaint place with a little bit of out door seating. They also have some items for patrons to peruse and purchase, including some specialty butters both made by Great Harvest Bread Company and other health food companies. My fave discovery here, Naturally Nutty products -- Organic Chocolate Sunflower Butter. It tastes like a Ferrero Rocher chocolate sans the gluten.  Hooray!  THE SERVICE: Super friendly.  First of all, Yelp had the hours wrong and we ended up walking into the store a few minutes to closing without even realizing it. To top that off, since it was our first time there we took our sweet time ordering. As we were waiting for our food, we noticed one of the young gals there beginning to stack up the chairs to put them away for the evening. Only then were we told that they were closing at 5 pm. Never did we feel unwelcome. Even after there was a small challenge with my hubby's chosen sandwich (which was resolved by the way, with no real issue), never did we feel rushed.  THE FOOD: It was very good. I had a simple egg & veggie sandwich on Gluten Free bread and hubby had something with ham in it. It was freshly made too, you can taste it. Then we took home a red velvet cupcake for our daughters. Which they devoured like their life depended on it.  Needless to say, that was very good too.  I will definitely be coming back here again."}
{"text":"The food is overpriced for what you get.  Yes it is fresh and yes it is decent.  However the sandwiches are small and covered in mayonaise.  Just over all not impressed."}
{"text":"The Little Italy sandwich is amazing!!  Also we've bought their bread and little holiday goodies and they were amazing too!"}
{"text":"I arrived at the restaurant at 10:30 am and wanted to order a breakfast panini but was told that the panini press had been turned off so I ordered a BLT.    For $6.50 + tax, I received a small sandwich on stale sourdough bread (not toasted) with limp bacon and an unripe,  tasteless tomato.  No chips, pickles  etc.   Not a fan of this place"}
{"text":"Like delicious fresh baked bread?  this is the place. Have a family member that is gluten sensitive?  they have gluten free breads as well (available on Tuesdays) . So far we have tried a honey wheat, multigrain, tuscan herb and the gluten free cinnamon. All have been delicious.  So spend the extra dollar or so compared to the grocery store, you'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"Let's face it, the best part of Great Harvest is the free samples. You can sample any of their breads or cookies. My favorite to sample is the cherry white chocolate bread. It's delicious, decadent, and I'm always afraid to buy a loaf for fear of my teeth falling out.   I visit Great Harvest at least once a month on a Friday for a loaf of their challah. It's a sweeter challah that we like with butter, apple butter, hummus, and as challah french toast. I also like the honey wheat bread for pb&j or turkey sandwiches during the week."}
{"text":"Deeeeeeeeeeeeeelicious baked goods!  It's not as fast or as popular as Panera, but if you're looking for a quiet get away bakery, this is it.  Service is usually good too.  Quick at lunchtime."}
{"text":"Cozy place with a nice atmosphere, real Italian espresso machine, great sandwiches, soups and salads. My veggie hummus sandwich was light and tasty. I think this one has what it takes to survive!"}
{"text":"Amazing customer service with even better food. Highly recommended. Very friendly ambiance right after you walk through the door and an extremely friendly greeting when you go to the register. Really nice selection of bread and aprons as well."}
{"text":"I was so happy to discover this place! Delicious whole grain bread that will definitely be replacing my standard grocery store varieties. The epitome of nutritious and delicious."}
{"text":"I work just 1 block from this fabulous store....very dangerous lol. When you walk in it smells amazing! Normally I limit myself to one visit a month, but that is very hard. I absolutely love the cherry/ white chocolate bread (Wednesday's only)! Sandwiches are great made to order. My friend Doreen turned me onto this place and I highly recommend for everyone to try just once."}
{"text":"Just found this restaurant and had the best sandwich I've had in a very long time. The bread and baked goods are amazing. So happy to have somewhere to go for good sandwiches."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a great sandwich spot, you have to give this place a try! Not only serving delicious sammies, either by menu or create your own, this place bakes its own bread and treats- and tons of them.  They have a bread station with favorites and new items, ready to slice up large samples for guests. Super friendly staff, also.                                                                Super quant, hidden gem off of Horizon Ridge, it's a fav for sure."}
{"text":"Ooey gooey cinnamon rolls with cream cheese icing... Need I say more? Ok, I will! Super friendly staff, lots of free samples, and tasty, tasty treats. Plus, it's right next to the greenway so you can burn off those calories right away!"}
{"text":"We love the variety of breads, especially our favorite pumpkin spice chocolate chip bread. We love how supportive GHB has been to our community!"}
{"text":"Based on the bread alone, 5 stars for sure.  The white loaf is delicious.   I was pretty disappointed with the customer service.  There were plenty of racks of bread everywhere, but very little product was actually for sale.  The clerk mumbled some type of explanation i didn't really catch, but in the end we could pretty much choose between white and honey wheat.  Then she explains to me that they would not be able to slice my loaves because they were using the equipment to slice the other (custom?) orders.  Really?  I know how the slicing machine works.  It takes about 30 seconds per loaf.  You can't be bothered to slice my loaves?    I'll stick with Breadsmith."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Found it driving through Madison and decided to try it since it had 4 stars. The bread, we had the Dakota bread for our sandwiches, was outstanding. My chicken salad was wonderful and my husband loved his Italian sandwich. Brownie for dessert is the best ever and I love brownies so have eaten a lot of them, theirs is super. This is on the top of our list for our next visit to Madison."}
{"text":"I was happy this location had warm spinach/ feta bread! Happy santas workshops shoppish chorus of hellos greeted me the moment I entered! What a difference from the other location!"}
{"text":"Food:   Their bread is fantastic! They've got free samples and plenty of choices of bread, and it's all fresh.  Sandwiches, both cold and hot, have the perfect balance between bread and middle ingredients.  Service:  Every time I've been there, the service has been extremely helpful and friendly. Perfect!  The Restaurant Itself:  The restaurant is air-conditioned and comfortable inside. The decor is low-key without feeling cheap or tacky. There are about five inside tables and two outside tables.  Why Not Five Stars?  In terms of value, I feel like I get what I am paying for. I would prefer $6 sandwiches, but that may not be possible while maintaining a decent profit margin, so they don't lose the star there.  The breads rotate frequently enough, but the sandwich group is pretty small and does not change very often.   I don't care at all about the overpriced specialty products being sold as \"Gourmet Grocery.\" I would prefer that space be devoted to seating or even an ice cream novelty freezer.  This is a solid choice of restaurant. If they ever devote more attention to that part of their business, I'll happily give them five stars."}
{"text":"I love this little sandwich nook in Tempe! The sandwiches are so tasty but the baked goods is the reason that you go for sure! Be sure to get your punch card for a free bread loaf! Yum!"}
{"text":"This is a very different place. I found it through a friend who had been wanting to try it out for quite a while now. So we came here for lunch. A nice little place inside a strip mall. It is a Bakery, and also a restaurant.  I got a chicken Sandwich. with avocado. The thing with the Avocado,it is a spread, rather than slices,so it is a little different. We chose to eat inside,as it was a roasting hot day ,as always.  My friend ordered the Turkey sandwich. Why, because, our server, (who was great) told us there was something in the chicken that had not been Identified as Gluten free. I thought that was really fabulous of her to share that.  My friend has a huge Gluten intolerance. So that info was very good to know. I bought a loaf of the Gluten free bread to go. It was Buckwheat, and very good,it makes great toast.  Lots to have here at this bakery and you can get it to go if  you like. I highly recommend it.  They were even doing a bakery tour for a group of preschoolers. I thought that was very nice."}
{"text":"I will definitely be a regular here. The bread is absolutely delicious. I do like that the ingredients are just like what you would make at home. My favorite is the lemon poppy loaf. The best part is that they offer you a thick slice while you shop. I ordered the turkey and pesto sandwich which was fresh and very filling. I did plan to take a picture but it was so delicious that I gobbled it up. I want to try the jams as they look tempting. If you have not tried its a must. My other favorite is the Dakota bread . They have specific days were they offer specific breads which I expect to me well worth it."}
{"text":"Found out about Great Harvest on Twitter. Always want to try something new in Vegas. This was well worth the drive!  Fresh made food is A1 in my book. My husband and I split a sandwich called Little Italy. It was great. I wanted to try the cinnamon roll untilI saw their pull apart. I haven't tasted it yet but it looks great. The ladies working were very nice. Can't wait to come back to Vegas and have it again. Thank you very much!!"}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I have only had the baked goods not the sandwiches or salads, but I plan on going back and trying one soon. The service is great, very friendly, helpful staff. Cinnamon rolls are excellent. The scones are some of the best I've had (and I've had a lot). The cookies are beautiful and tasty. We had coffee as well, which I liked better than Starbucks. We will be visiting again soon."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and go to Great Harvest Bread Co!   I love this little place. There's nothing better than freshly baked bread and this is the place to get it. The staff here are so sweet.  My favorite bread is The Dakota.  Sunflower and pumpkin seeds make this loaf amazing.  The sandwiches here are yum. They only have 3 vegetarian options, that's my only complaint. I'm a fan of  \"The Masters\": pimento cheese, spicy pecans, hot pepper jelly, lettuce, cucumber. Mmmm.   You're going to pay a little more than you would at the grocery store obviously, but the quality and simplicity of the ingredients make it worth the cash for me.  FYI they have a coupon in the Charlotte Citipass book: buy any loaf and get a honey whole wheat loaf free!"}
{"text":"Love the way that the Little Italy melts in your mouth with a rainbow of flavor! You'll never get bored, as each day comes with a variety of breads to choose from. Sometimes if you're lucky, the owner will make a batch of her delicious Spinach Feta Croutons or a Ham and Cheddar breakfast strata. The smell captures your attention immediately, and you can't help but fall in love. If you could only buy one thing there, never miss out on their Cinnaburst. Makes for a great french toast and a happy family!"}
{"text":"Very clean, super nice people always working, excellent bread and great sandwiches! If you want or need an amazing grilled cheese you will not be disappointed. I promise... Get the grilled cheese!!"}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh-baked breads in a number of unusual flavors and high quality. Highly recommend this place - if you like pumpkin, try the pumpkin spice loaf with a little honey."}
{"text":"This is the best bread in the valley. It started off as mom and pop shop in Montana and became a chain. You would never know it by the quality though. Each chain is unique and different.  I had my first taste when I was in MT.  I went to this location and was pleasantly surprised to find it was even better than I remembered.  They have a schedule of different breads baked daily. The sandwiches are not that great, too little meat, nothing special..."}
{"text":"Great Harvest was at the Roadrunner Park Farmers Mkt... sampling the cinnamon loaf..... I had to buy one!!!   It is loaded with cinnamon flavor, made with whole grain bread so it is good AND good for you!  I haven't been to their restaurant location but next time I'm in Tempe, I'll check it out!  I just hope they keep coming to Roadrunner Park!"}
{"text":"Love this place !! The sandwiches are all delicious and I love the bread ! Especially from the bread board :) Only complaint , the male worker that I always see acts like he just hates his job :/ he never offers up a slice from the bread board like the other lady (I'm thinking she's the owner or manager) always does. He's not too friendly either , but not going to keep me away !  I love that you get the option of a cookie or chips with the meal , because the cookies are amazing !   Keep making delicious goodies !"}
{"text":"If you want to buy fresh bakery bread, this is your place! They have a huge selection of bread types, including less common types that they offer on a rotating basis.  I seldom buy bakery bread so tend to only visit when enjoying a meal with friends. The sandwiches tend to be pretty standard. While the bread is tasty, I could make the same sandwich at home (using their bread) at a much lower cost. Also, many of their desserts are far too sweet."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped by to get a sandwich one afternoon. The small shop smelled great, I had great customer service and the food was good! I read some of the other comments and all I can say is maybe they were having a bad day. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because I felt the prices where a little higher than it should be. The Spinach Feta bread was awesome!!! It is a must try."}
{"text":"Oh Great Harvest, how you disappointed me.  I originally had Great Harvest at the Charlotte Farmer's Market and we were impressed.  We were offered a lot of samples and ended up going home with a herbed focaccia, which I learned they no longer sell?  At any rate, last month, we stopped by the Rea Road location for the very first time.  Was offered one sample after I made a purchase, so quite a different experience.  Not that I care too much about the samples, but it definitely helped me in making a purchase at the Farmer's Market.  We purchased the extreme cinnamon swirl (tried it at the market) and a garlic rosemary loaf.  I was extremely disappointed when we cut into the cinnamon swirl as it was just specs of cinnamon, the swirl was no where to be seen (other than the bottom corner).  It was just dry and not what I recalled tasting.  The garlic loaf on the other hand was very good!  I went on GHB's website and found an e-mail and contacted them with a picture of my sad bread.  I received a response the next day from the manager with an apology and a bizarre offer just to let the employee know that you can get another one on us.  Not sure how the employee is supposed to know or believe that?  I have not tried yet, but at any rate, I responded asking questions on availability of the bread and if I could preorder.  That was on 8/22.  Here it is 9/21 and I received no response.  Overall just disappointed in the bread I received and the follow-up from GHB.  Doesn't have me running back to try again."}
{"text":"I always thought it was silly to have a bread place next to Trader Joes, but I was hungry and stopped in before shopping. The counter woman was great? Friendly and offered a sample of their hummus bread, which was great; she also knew when to walk away and let me think about what I wanted. I ordered the chicken salad salad and it was great. White meat, celery and candied pecans with not too much mayo on a bed of lettuce with a side of spinach tomato bread, all for $8. The apricot bread and salted caramel bar were equally good."}
{"text":"This is a pretty good place to come to for lunch (if you are in the area). The sandwiches are really fresh and healthy. And they are incredibly nice here. They will sometimes give you samples of several different breads. They also offer kids size sandwiches.   I give it three stars since I feel it is a bit pricey. But I suppose it can be justified with the fresh and healthy part?"}
{"text":"Great little neighborhood bakery. For us non meat eaters they make a great veggie panini. The staff is friendly and helpful and the place is clean. They even have a rewards program. If you live in any of the apartments nearby it's a short pleasant walk from Mallard Creek with sidewalks all the way and traffic lights for these wide streets. If you're a fitness guy or runner they have a great sense high calorie power bar."}
{"text":"Great sandwhich on great bread. Everything was fresh. Good service. And they let you sample ! I recommend it to anyone who likes good food."}
{"text":"The breads rock here.  I come here for lunch and the tuna sandwich is my favorite.  Friendly staff and the vibe is pleasant and low key.  They have a frequent buyer reward program too where you can either a few loaf of bread or sandwich. If you don't have a lot of time for lunch and want quality food at a fair price, this is the place"}
{"text":"If you're doing the whole Atkins diet thing-don't even read this review b/c I don't want to be blamed for your downfall.   I checked out Great Harvest this morning since I saw I had a BOGO coupon for a honey whole wheat loaf of bread in the Citipass book. Loving all things carbs, I checked online and they were open early. Such a nice change for a morning person like me since many things in Charlotte don't seem to be open early on the wknd! I walked in there and this place is HUGE! Of course the other thing I noticed was the smell of fresh breads being baked, so many flavors, so little time. IHowever, it was filled not only with bread but an inventory of dips, chutneys, sauces, etc. They also have a cart with dry soup mix that is gluten free and looked pretty tasty.   I wasn't sure what to get there so I went with Rosemary Garlic loaf to get something with flavor. This girl cooks a lot of Italian food so I am sure I can incorporate it in a meal somewhere. They have toaster and round loaves-which just mean the size of the loaf (I had no clue what they meant when they asked this so I just said toasted in an inquisitive way). Their bread has no artificial ingredients or preservatives and according to their website, shouldn't be refrigerated but can be frozen (they gave me extra bags when I told them I want to freeze mine).   They also have a bread card where you buy 12 loaves, you get one free. When I saw others put three $$$ for price on here, I don't agree. The loaves are about $5 a pop and most bread at the supermarket is an average of $3 so I don't think the price is too high, especially for freshly baked bread without preservatives or artificial ingredients. I dig how they have the nutritional info on their website so you can see what you're taking in. They also have sandwiches there besides bread so if you're looking for a quick treat, you should stop on in!   Two Citipass coupons--one for a free loaf, the other is for BOGO sandwich."}
{"text":"Wonderful local bakery! Cute little place with super friendly service.    Tried 1/2 chicken berry pecan sandwich, seafood bisque, cinnamon swirl.  -chicken berry pecan sandwich: Delicious! I'm going to assume it was on their famous honey whole wheat. Bread was yummy, though it would have been much better toasted in my opinion. A tad heavy on the mayo but overall very well balanced and yummy. -seafood bisque: Could have been delicious but insanely salty. Half the salt could still possibly be too salty. This is the reason for knocking one star off...! -Cinnamon swirl: I'm going to assume this is definitely not the healthy of breads but it was sweet sugary cinnamon goodness.   It was my first time here and I look forward to trying many more of their goodies. One wonderful thing is, they sell their breads fresh and anything older than 2 days gets donated. Awesome!"}
{"text":"My whole family loves Great Harvest.  We used to go to Great Harvest when we lived in Chicago.  So glad there is now one in Cornelius!  Great sandwiches, scones, bread and cookies!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in and was looking for a quite bite to eat before going to wine & canvas. Upon walking in I was greeted by a friendly gal who immediately offered me a sample of some fresh cooked bread. I tried the sourdough. Man, was it good! Super moist, chewy....perfect.   Next I did the build your own sandwhich. I had questions about what ingredients were in the pesto. The gal said she didn't know but did go and find it for me, brought me the nutrition label for it. I really appreciated that!! :)   I got a turkey sandwhich on sourdough with all the veggies. No pesto for me but that sandwhich was awesome!!!! So fresh! I will be back for sure! See ya later port of subs!!!!"}
{"text":"In a bread store I'm like a kid in a candy store.  White, wheat, 9 grain, italian, french, sourdough, banana, pumpkin ... I'm not picky.  Oh and then there is oatmeal, granola, cake mixes, brownie mixes, muffins, cinnamon rolls ... get the point?  The had me when I walked in and they offered me a piece of fresh baked honey wheat (with some butter) while I decided what I wanted.  I'm really on the whole grain, 9 grain, dairy free (vegan) kick and when they grind their grains on site in their own mill, it's a plus.  My choice, a loaf of high 5 fiber bread with whole wheat, honey, flax, millet, oat and sunflower seeds (that weighs literally 2 pounds) and a half dozen honey wheat dinner rolls.    I can't wait to make toast with peanut butter tomorrow!"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing! I love that you're not overloaded with decisions as there are only a dozen or so types of sandwiches, but they are very good choices."}
{"text":"It's a sandwich place. Average bread. Average sandwiches. I doubt if they make their own bread there. Went there for breakfast sandwiches and they didn't have breakfast ingredients.   Overpriced for what you get. We've had better from a real bread place.   Should have gone to one of the local buffets instead..."}
{"text":"Unfortunately their store doesn't really stand out from the road. I have driven past here numerous times and never noticed it.  Then again, that is pretty standard for strip malls here in AZ.  At least there is yelp.  It's located on the opposite side of the street from the Wells Fargo, under the big ESPRESSO sign.   This is a cool place that has a few tables inside and outdoor seating and have breakfast breads and lunch sandwiches.  The Mochas are pretty great here and so far there has been no line and very quick service.  I had a Morning glory muffin that was very good and my dog enjoyed the dog biscuits I got him.   If you are headed down Warner in the morning or afternoon you should stop in.  Not sure if it was a special for St. Patty's day, but the Guinness and Gouda bread is awesome.  Try:   - Mocha - Morning Glory Muffins - Guinness and Gouda Bread ( Hope it's not just a St. Patty's thing ) - Dakota Bread"}
{"text":"All their items are so tasty!!! Our faves are the brownie bread, cinnaburst, Italian sandwiches, & cinnamon rolls!"}
{"text":"I first found out about this place at the farmers market. It's a carb paradise and everything tastes unbelievable! From the challah to the pumpkin spice bread YUM! They also give you free samples just for stopping in :) I wanted to buy the entire store but I forced myself to pick one loaf this trip!   Perfect place for holiday desserts! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I was feeling the need for a snack the other day and happened to be in the area of this little gem.  So I popped over to see what they had to offer, I was very pleasantly surprised.  The smell of fresh baked bread and other goodies meets you at the door, which is always fun.  Besides the inviting smells, the employees are super nice.  Even though all I bought was a cookie they offered me a free taste of one of their other products (btw the pecan sweet bread is awesome).  Plus I liked the open layout of the place.  You can watch as they pull the bread out of the oven and wrap it up for you."}
{"text":"Babka like my grandmother used to make. The challah is right up there too. Sandwiches are tasty and large. Service is friendly. All in all very good"}
{"text":"No matter what day and no matter what time I have always had great experiences at this sandwich and bread factory! Consistent quality and taste are what keep me coming back! I'm a big fan of the build your own!"}
{"text":"The breads, muffins and cookies are amazing at Great Harvest Bread Co. This is the only bread we eat in our house anymore!   We make a trip to the bakery at least once if not twice a week.  Great customer service as well."}
{"text":"So disappointing - I made a special trip to check to see if you have bread bowls and to pick up a loaf of bread. I counted 5 ppl behind the counter, 3 made eye contact and never said a word - your busy with an order but your customer service is disappointing to say the least - I just walked out and I don't think yuh even noticed."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Their sandwiches are delicious and customer service is always great. Don't forget to try their slice of bread samples."}
{"text":"I found this bakery through the Farmer's Market and fell in l.o.v.e with their Dakota Bread - it has everything I love about sliced bread - dense, tons of seeds, perfectly absorbs butter, and perfectly accompanies any deli meat or PB&J.  I was impressed with their customer service recently.  I saw them at the Gilbert Farmer's Market and bought a Gluten-free loaf from the young gal and guy there.  I took it home, totally excited to slice it up (it wasn't sliced) and make yummy toast or a sandwich from it.  I had recently converted to Rudi's GF bread (find it at Sprouts) which is awesome.. so I was expecting the same experience with this new Great Hearvest GF bread.  Turns out, something in their recipe was waaay off.  I opened the cellophane wrapped GF loaf and it completely broke apart with a touch of a finger.. it seemed that something didn't bind or keep things together in the mix.  I contacted the owner (I got their business card at the Farmer's Mkt by chance) and very politely told her my experience.. that I was a long time fan.. loved their products..very saddened to have it crumble...  She replied to my email and was SO kind and apologetic about the whole thing.  She offered me to come in or find them next time at the market to get a refund or exchange it (no need to bring in the bad loaf)... she was going to let her staff know so that I wouldn't have to struggle with an explanation for why I was asking for a swap or refund if she weren't there.  I was impressed with that!  I love it when an owner takes care of customers and make sure their product isn't leaving a bad or negative impression.. granted, it's up to you as the consumer to give them the opportunity to fix it (like I did in an email, rather than ranting here on Yelp.. which we all may or may not be guilty off.. errrr.. ).  Anyway, I hope to try their little shop next time.. but so far, this bread company is up there on my list of favorites."}
{"text":"I am so happy I was introduced to this little place! It is seriously amazing. It's a very small establishment with only about 5 tables inside. The bakery makes everything fresh every single day and the bread is great! I didn't realize it's also a sandwich shop and the sandwiches are so tasty. The people who work here are also very friendly. They have multiple breads to taste and try every day and they make specialty breads on certain days of the week. My favorite so far is the feta! They sell breads, spreads, marinades, desserts, and cookies! A great little mom and pop place for sure!"}
{"text":"I first went here because I never heard of them nore did I know what they were all about. Now I do and I am happy I gave them a try! Awesome breads! Different breads for ever day of the week except Sundays as they are closed. Flavors such as pumpkin spice, caramel apple, sour dough are just a few of what they offer. If you can't decide then the free slice bread for you when you walk in may help you decide!  Also check out their menu, their sandwiches are great! Partly due to the fact that they used their own great array of breads!  If you are having a get together and want something different to offer checkout the breads coming from great harvest as they are surely to turn heads and get compliments!"}
{"text":"I eat lunch here often and the food is AWESOME!  Amazing fresh baked bread for the sandwiches, yummy salads, soups...healthy fresh ingredients, beautiful baked goods that make a great gift. Prices are great!"}
{"text":"I don't do well with yeasty bread type food. Meaning my body does not love me for eating it as much as my mind/tastebuds do and I swell up for a week. That said, when I just have to cheat and have some great bread, this is the place for it. I always tend to go for the sweet breads like the Blueberry Cheesecake bread, the Cinnamon Chip or Cinnamon Swirl bread (GREAT FRENCH TOAST!!!), Cherry, or Apple Pecan bread. Each could be eaten plain but are taken over the top when you toast them with some honey or some other spread. I wish I could learn how to make the breads. Wait, scratch that.  No I don't.   Their cinnamon \"scuffins\" (if scones and muffins mated) are excellent and hubby likes the cinnamon rolls (not my fave). Even their snickerdoodle cookies or plain honey wheat loaves are good. They have a Florentine kind of loaf that is perfect for holiday/italian meals. Well it's a crowd pleaser but sometimes gets you in trouble w/ the Italian Mother In Law because it's more popular than what was previously served. Consider yourself warned.  Great Harvest gets brownie points for supporting the race community and providing post-race samples :) Yay!   The only reason I don't give this place a 5 star rating is that seemingly every time we have a craving to go, it's Sunday morning, when they're closed. Dang! Also I would love for them to offer some sort of breakfast sandwich with eggs in it and a place to sit down. Other than that, nothing but love."}
{"text":"First time here, and the Cali Cobb Sammy was , one of the best sandwiches I've eaten in a very longtime . All fresh and delish!!"}
{"text":"No wait at 9:00am this Monday morning.  Greeted promptly and tried their signature cinnamon roll and sugar free, fat free latte.  Cinnamon roll was fresh, gooey and had many layers to it....like a good bakery cina-roll should!  Not a blob of white bread dough fluffed up with white icing dabbed on top like some places try to pass them off.  Bake mixes, specialty jams and butter displayed for sale in this country-like store.  Last time I was here, the loaf I purchased had flies in the sealed bag, hence why I haven't come back until now.  Today's visit for latte and roll was good though."}
{"text":"So delicious! I recommend this location to all of my clients, friends and family. You can't beat the fresh bread and they sure know how to make a sandwich. Such a friendly staff too. Oh, gotta try their jumbo cookies!"}
{"text":"I just bought a loaf of the Tuscan Herb bread at the Gilbert Farmer's Market... it is seriously the BEST bread I've ever had. I'm so excited to try more!"}
{"text":"It's pumpkin bread season! Well in our household, it's pumpkin bread no matter what season. It's great we can count on Great Harvest to have the yummy super moist, pumpkiny loaves ready every day.    Breads are baked daily and most are on the rack by 6am when they open. They feature several different breads. All of the ones I get are always super soft and tasty.  On Saturdays make sure you get here early! Since it's closed on Sunday, every mom is here stocking up. By late afternoon the racks are wiped out!  We know, because we have been SOL twice now!  The young staff working up front are always friendly and polite.  They always remind me to get my card punched. You can find Great Harvest booth at Farmers Market, Fridays at Henderson Pavilion.   The store itself is more on the country charm side. There are a couple tables so you can have your sandwich there. They carry jams and miscellaneous stuff perfect for last minute gifts.   --Cost-- a little more than traditional grocery stores, but I am fine with that. Quality ingredients, made from scratch. You get a punch card and rewarded after so many visits. Anytime you come here, they feed and fatten you up offering a slice (more like a hunk) of bread and butter.   If you have the Yelp app, make sure you check in and get the large cookie! So free cookie, plus complimentary slice of bread.. with butter and yummy pumpkin bread, makes it a no brainer picking up breads here for us."}
{"text":"Bread samples...warm bread samples!  The Dakota bread rocks...unfortunately they didn't have enough for my sandwich at the moment, but the honey wheat was yummy too."}
{"text":"Really great bread and sandwiches!  Very good customer service!  Will be back!"}
{"text":"I am here every week now.  Walk in. Don't look at the menu yet. Wait. You just looked! Don't be impatient, I understand the urge. We get anxious when we're about to eat delicious carbs.   Walk up to the counter and ask for your free sample. They'll slather some butter on it if you want to get crazy. YUM.   My favorites are Cinnamon Swirl, Pumpkin Chocolate Chip, Cinnaburst, and Hummus Wheat. They have a list of their daily breads baked for each day of the week. These are available as whole loaves. You can also customize any sandwich.  The staff is very friendly. If you buy a loaf and want it sliced up and bagged, just ask. This location has been giving a free giant, and I mean GIANT cookie with your Yelp check-in. They're nice and soft, YUM. Even more sugary carbs.   My son loves when I pack Great Harvest bread in his lunchbox. I don't blame him, so I stop in here every week now. Completely worth it."}
{"text":"Wow, wow, wow. Just went in for the first time to get my husband a really good reuben sandwich for his birthday. They did not disappoint. Love that I have a place so close with amazing sandwiches. My son got the BLT and was equally happy. I'm not a fan of pumpkin but sampled the pumpkin bread and ended up leaving with a loaf. Amazing people and customer service to. Loved it all."}
{"text":"Love all of their bread! Especially the low carb whole grain."}
{"text":"Having recently discovered they have an extensive gluten-free menu (and baking day), I have fallen in love with this place. I've only been there once, but the cinnamon chip bread I got was incredible! I toast it and put cream cheese and cinnamon sugar on the top, but that's beside the point. They have an extensive menu of gluten-free items and bake all of them fresh on Tuesday afternoons. I will most likely update this review as my gluten-free bread bliss here develops."}
{"text":"Seriously the best bread I have ever tasted. It's Friday night and I went in for a challah. It melted in your mouth! I ate most of the loaf in a matter of seconds . The small piece I did have left was devoured when I got home by my son."}
{"text":"This was my first time stopping at Great Harvest. I loved the breadboard and the fact that their gluten free breads and cookies are freshest on Tuesday and Wednesday was an additional plus.   I got the 3 seed hummus sandwich and it was so good, loved the veggies. Next time will get a bigger beverage though. I forgot how dry sandwiches especially Gluten free ones can be."}
{"text":"I just keep coming back here for this sandwich! I love the Mediterranean madness with hummus, olives, cucumbers, pepper rings, and hummus. Here's the secret: order ham on it and it will blow your mind. The Dakota bread is hands down the best! With sunflower seeds, pumpkin and sesame seeds. Great nutritious sources of fiber and healthy fats too. They also have amazing treats - I strongly strongly encourage you to try the Savannah bars. They are soooo moist and every bite is more delectable then the last."}
{"text":"I come here pretty regularly for sandwiches as I work nearby and their food is usually high quality.  I came here two weeks ago and the customer service was definitely lacking effort, but I chalked it up to an off day.  They weren't even offering samples even though the sample bread was all set up, but then when I left I heard them offering to the next customer and figured maybe everyone thought someone else had already helped me and it was just an oversight.  Today, I went back and ordered my usual sandwich.  When I got there, there were two girls at the register and both were busy, so I stood behind the guests at the far register so I didn't block their soda machine.  The other customer finished first, leaving the girl who had helped them unoccupied.  She made eye contact with me multiple times, as did the girl who was still busy,  and said nothing.  I wasn't in a hurry and wasn't sure of her role, so I continued to wait.  When the other girl was done with her transaction, I stepped up.  She looked at me, gestured with her head to the other girl and said \"She can help you\" and walked back into the kitchen area.  Not a big deal, except they both saw me waiting for a few minutes and neither offered that solution earlier.  Once again, no samples were offered (I didn't see them offer to anyone this time), although when I got there a couple was eating samples so I'm assuming they just do it when it conveniences them.  She took my order, didn't offer a combo or really say anything except my total, so I asked to add a drink.  I probably would have let all of this slide since I usually just get my sandwich and drink to go, and am there for less than 5 minutes, so it's not really the customer service or atmosphere that I come for.  However, when I got to my office about 5 minutes later and went to eat my sandwich, their wheat bread was so stale it kept cracking and breaking off into large pieces every time I would try to take a bite.  I literally ended up eating my sandwich with utensils because it was impossible to hold without it breaking even more.  Like I said earlier, their food is usually very good and their bread fresh.    To sum it up, over the past few months their customer service has taken a nosedive and now apparently their food quality is following suit.  A huge disappointment since they have always been my go-to when I'm in a hurry for lunch."}
{"text":"Perfect for lunch or just for a loaf of a bread. I ordered the Mediterranean sandwich and it was amazing. Everything taste very fresh. I also had the tomato bisque which was delicious. I ate every drop. I also tried the cinnamon bread which was pretty good. Makes great French toast for breakfast. The employees were very nice and patient while I ordered. They answered all my questions and were knowledgeable about the different choices. Great food if you're looking for a healthy lunch or loaf of fresh baked bread!"}
{"text":"Delicious sandwich. Got a free cookie because I checked in. The sandwiches are very big with lots of meat. I'll definitely be going back when I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"this place is amazing! Fresh bread and sandwiches. Also amazing oatmeal chocolate chip cookie! The staff is always friendly and welcoming . And a great atmosphere from the lights to the holiday decorations."}
{"text":"What a great little place. I visit at least once a week. Great customer service. The staff will always ask if I want a sample of something. Hell yes I want a little taste of something! Thanks for asking!  The Cinnamon Chip Bread is TO DIE FOR!!!!! AND thanks to the girl behind the counter I now know that they offer the Cinnamon Chip Bread in Whole Wheat. Yippee! But know this, they only make it on Thursdays.   The Dakota Bread is also a favorite in our house. One slice is like a meal.  Around Easter, they offer large and small Bunny Breads. Honey Wheat bread in the shape of Bunnies. How cute is that? I ordered one this past Easter. It was a conversation piece for Easter Feast and it was very yummy too."}
{"text":"This place is great.  Obviously fresh bread for every sandwich.  The sandwiches are are a great blend of perfect bread and awesome meats.  I even like the veggie sandwich.  I like to pick up a loaf when I can, but my favorites are the tuna sandwich and the turkey sandwich."}
{"text":"I was very impressed with Great Harvest. The customer service here was great, the bread samples were delicious, and the food was tasty. I did order coffee while I was here and would probably not choose to go here just for the coffee given some of the great neighboring coffee shops, but I'll definitely be back when hungry!"}
{"text":"This is a great little eatery. It is a very welcoming spot starting from the curb.  They staff is very friendly and the service is excellent.  They also offer you a free slice of bread - yummy.     It's known for its bread but it has both breakfast and lunch sandwich items on the menu.  The pastries are wonderful especially the cinnamon roll covered with cream cheese frosting.  They also have organic chocolate, gluten free items and a nice variety of specialty butters.  There are tables to eat at both inside and outside the store.I took  my dog Caesar there this morning and we both had some free bread.   Super delicious."}
{"text":"Wonderful service, cute little cafe, great food and they were very generous with samples!"}
{"text":"I love great harvest bread everywhere but this little shop is always friendly and warm. They have free coffee and samples. The bread is delicious as are their sandwiches. I love the popeye and chocolate chip. I still think it's a bit pricey but it's just that delicious."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the breads, the choice of breads and the sandwiches. However, the lady working the counter right now is horrible. Absolutely no customer service what-so-ever! Yelling at guests (from the back) to write down their order. The poor guests behind us had never been here before, and we're totally confused."}
{"text":"This place is great. My office is located across the street and I eat lunch here on the regular. One of my favorite sandwiches is the Turk n Berry and the the sausage soup is amazing. Every bread I have tried is delicious. From the garlic cheddar to the pumpkin chocolate chip is awesome. They offer free samples of bread for you to try. The staff is friendly and you get your food quick. Great place to eat!"}
{"text":"Met here for the latest Yelp book club meeting, at Lisa H's suggestion. I've been by before to grab a bread for a friend, but this location is out of the way for me so I haven't been back since. I really like how visitors are welcomed with samples upon entry, with a choice of about eight different daily breads and sweets such as lemon bars! Great touch.  I tried the Turkey Pesto sando but switched out sourdough for garlic-cheddar, which is incredible! The sandwich held up despite the pesto and balsamic sauces, and was super thick for the $8 price tag. It was filling even without adding on a side, though Lisa and her hubs praised the soup they tried. Their sandwich menu is limited but well thought out, and I will have difficulty deciding between the Beef Chimmichurri or the Vegas Vegan next time I get out this way."}
{"text":"It's usually the case in Madison, that the local bakeries and bread maker products are far superior to any of the 'chain stores' but one of the exceptions just opened their doors today. Great Harvest Bread Co. (which is a franchise business) started baking bread, cookies, bars, and making sandwiches today, right near the edge of the Shorewood/Hilldale neighborhood and the UW medical complex. The store is bright, clean, and very efficient looking. The daily specials and baked goods are nicely displayed and you could get samples of their wares while waiting in line...well, today anyway. The service was good, although not without the first day hiccups that every business goes through. I ordered the Ham and Brie and put it on Anadama bread, which I'd never had before. With apples and apricot relish, it was a wonderful cascade of flavors giving one last push at summer's bounty. The salted caramel cookie that I got was just as delish! With artisan loaves of bread, sweet bakery items, granolas, and sandwich specials changing daily, and don't forget the doggie treats!, I'm looking forward to getting back here soon!"}
{"text":"Amazing place. It's small and the customer service is outstanding! You can't go wrong with any of their signature sandwiches."}
{"text":"Super dry chicken salad without lettuce or tomatoes. No substitutions allowed. Very disappointing for an $8 sandwich"}
{"text":"Solid sandwich place. Their triple seed hummus was one of the best fresh-veggie cold sandwiches I've had in Madison. The cukes were thinly sliced and well seasoned, over rich and flavorful hummus, with julienned carrots, lettuce, tomato, crunchy slaw, and a little red onion to give the whole thing a kick. All those goodies are nestled between two slices of hearty, moist bread, generously studded with seeds.   It comes with half a pickle.   Their chalkboard sign recommended I \"try our iced coffee!\" So I did just that. It was smooth and chocolatey near the back of the tongue, which makes me think it's cold brew (yes!), though a bit too watered down with ice.   There wasn't anything so exciting or special about this place that I feel compelled to come back, but for a healthy veggie sandwich in between errands, I might pop on by again."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with a sandwich from here. I particularly love the BLT. Customer service is okay. I love that they appear to hire first time employees. They are very timid in their customer service, but are sweet."}
{"text":"I love fresh bread  made with all natural ingredients - no yucky chemicals or  corn syrup.  Two of my regular favorites are the Whole Grain Goodness ( Whole Wheat Flour, Millet, Barley, Flax Seeds, Sunflower Seeds, Walnuts, Almonds, & Oat Bran) and the Dakota (with whole wheat flour and pumpkin & sunflower seeds).  On occasion, we also enjoy the Foccacia.  The cookies are a real treat as are the seasonal specialty sweet breads.  You'll have to get your fix Tues - Sat as they are closed on Sun & Mon.  Also, don't wait too late in the day to go or they will be sold out of all the good stuff!"}
{"text":"Sandwich shops are everywhere. So you encounter one that makes their own bread, which you can buy, and the ingredients between the bread are FRESH, you talk about it. Great job!!  Had the \"greenway\", turkey, swiss, lettuce, tomato... Just a simple sandwich that when i bit into, i had to pause to savor the AWSOME FLAVOR OF THE BREAD!  Can't eat anything for a while so i can savor the flavor."}
{"text":"The bread here is so good it will quite literally blow your mind. I got the Reuben, and will probably be dreaming about it tonight. At first glance, the sauerkraut seems to occupy the majority of the sandwuch, but it's mild enough not to overpower the pastrami. Grilled andwiches can sometimes get a really tough exterior that pushes the sandwich fillings out with every bite, but the bread here was toasted just enough to give it a bit of a crust without losing it's soft, toothsome texture. Oh baby. Reasonable prices and friendly staff sweeten the whole deal. Go towards the end of the day, and they'll be especially generous with samples. Tip well and return often."}
{"text":"$6.79, $7.89, $9.99 - no, those aren't the prices of sandwiches, but of loaves of bread. This was a nice little shop and the owners and staff are really nice. They even gave me a tour of the kitchen and cooking area for some reason. I saw lots of milled flour and big ancient mixers. I would have liked to see the bread at $3-$4 because that is what most people will pay for higher end bread. There are plenty of gourmet or unusual styles of bread at grocery stores and they are baked somewhere and I have not seen any of those over 5 bucks. I sampled the Extreme Cinnamon Swirl bread, but perhaps because it wasn't heated, it just didn't taste extreme, but at 9 bucks a loaf, that was kind of extreme. My only purchase was a lemon bar, but I couldn't make it past two bites due to over-flouring on top and no real lemon taste anywhere else. This lemon bar was missing the lemon part on the bottom, but they tried to fold it into the bar which didn't work well."}
{"text":"Having worked at a local bakery/cafe/sandwich shop similar to this in Tucson when I was younger, I can say that I was extremely disappointed with he portions of my sandwich. This was my first visit, and it will take me some convincing to return. First impressions make an impact.  I ordered a Cobb sandwich on Tuscan Garlic bread. When someone orders a whole sandwich, you would expect two halves, right? I ordered this sandwich to go with intentions of splitting it with my girlfriend when I got home. Upon arrival, I found one half of a sandwich, about the size of... well, half of a normal sandwich. I called to ask if there was a mixup or if they could do anything about it where they politely explained that when they slice from the the middle of a loaf, they only make one half for a full sandwich. So is that luck of the draw? I was not offered any compensation or refund except \"maybe a cookie\" on my next visit. That being said, $8 for half a sandwich left distaste in my wallet and no taste in my mouth (because I let my lady have the half).   Employees need to inform customers of these sorts of things in the future. Oh well."}
{"text":"I went here with my gf and we got the Great Grilled Cheese and a Turkey sandwich.  It was expansive and the Grilled Cheese was horrible!!! I rather make my own grilled cheese than buy from here.  Service was poor.  The owner was giving me dirty looks.  I will never go back again."}
{"text":"I love trying new places and Im all for a good sandwich. This seems like a cute little place. The people were very very friendly. Being a restaurant owner and having never been here, I just asked what was good, and she reccomended the Reuben, but they were out of pastrami. I settled with the Turkey melt.   I do think it's cool they give you a free slice to sample.  However, my sandwich was just blah. My three star rating is a combo of high pricing with an average sandwich. For 9.00 I got a sandwich I probably could have made at home in about 2 minutes. The bread definitely tastes great, although I was surprised to not smell any fresh bread or anything going on.  Maybe I'd go back to try something else and hope for better."}
{"text":"I have stopped in here a few times for different things.  I'm usually very satisfied and service is always great!  This morning was a different story.  They seemed very rushed and slightly chaotic.  I decided to go with a bacon egg and cheese bk sandwich.  I asked for it extra toasted which it was not AND got ham instead of bacon :( upon returning to work and discovering this I was quite sad and to top it off the \"egg\" is what looks like a fake egg white patty!  A bakery that uses fake eggs on sandwiches?!!  Idk about that.  The bread is delicious but I do not believe I will be ordering any more breakfast sandwiches.  I always try to support local and will continue to do so but, lesson learned here on the BK Sammy."}
{"text":"In the continued 'Wich hunt in Las Vegas, a friend led me to believe that there was a different side to these 'Wiches. A side that induced a different feeling; a feeling of warmth, closeness, and health.  Great Harvest Bread Company is like the Good 'Wich of the West! Great Harvest promotes for the healthy conscious with their variety of whole-grain freshly baked bread and hearty ready-made products.  Their welcoming offer of a sample of their freshly baked bread when visitors enter their bakery is their way of saying, \"Hey! Try this delicious slice of flavorful goodness!\"  My gf and I decided to give GHBC a try. As soon as we stepped in, we were greeted with a smile and a generous sample of their artichoke parmesan bread and pumpkin spice loaf with butter! We munched on them while we were glancing over their custom sandwich ordering sheet.  You have your different choice of meats, breads which also have a daily special for an additional .50, cheeses, and different deli toppings.  We got our sandwich grilled (an option to choose) with the daily special bread with pastrami, basil mayo, yellow mustard, provolone, peppercinis, and lettuce!  Yuh-meehhh! :P  We took the sandwich to go so it wasn't as fresh as we'd hoped it to be, but judging from how good the sandwich still was, I can tell it'd be even better! I'm excited to try more of their sandwiches and buying some of their loaves.  Cool factor-- What bakery do you know sells food for dogs too?  And that, my fellow yelpers, is why GHBC gets 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Delicious sandwiches. Wonderful staff. Great atmosphere.  Cookies are amazing. The BLT is sooo good"}
{"text":"Best bread and baked goodies in the Valley! Extreme Cinnamon Swirl is my go-to for French toast. I'm obsessed with their glazed sugar cookies and the coconut magic bars are to DIE for. Check them out!"}
{"text":"Excellent bread!  All healthy sandwiches and soups and bakery items.  I had a delicious veggie hummus sandwich on high 5 fiber whole grain bread. If you have never been here before they have you sample the many different breads. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Not too many of these businesses around. If you're a health nut, I urge you to try this place out. Absolutely one of the better places to get a healthy meal. Great menu, great homemade bread. Their Mediterranean sandwich is my favorite.   The service is very decent and everyone that has rung up my order previously has been the utmost friendly.  My only complaint, which is more a recommendation, is the venue. I know they are more a bakery, and I'm sure as they are just starting out the space is appealing financially, but they really need a little more space for dine-in."}
{"text":"I purchased a loaf of Buckwheat bread 8.50 and found long strands of auburn hair in my bread. Are you serious!?!?!?!?!  Hair NETS! That's disgusting. I won't be back."}
{"text":"YUM!!! (and I don't like sandwiches!!)  I actually found out about Great Harvest from a kid that goes to the school I work at. I was really curious because every time he had a Great Harvest sandwich it piqued my interest!   Since then, I have been to the Great Harvest restaurant/store a few times with my husband.  All of the sandwiches I've had there are great. My favorite bread is the Dakota bread.   Yesterday (6/9/16) I visited Legoland Discovery Center and I was happy to see that they had sandwiches from Great Harvest."}
{"text":"I love that they rotate their bread flavors and provide samples. My favorites so far are the lemon blueberry, banana bread, and the chocolate chip coconut.   However, I am deducting one star since there were times I had noticed chunks of flour inside the loaves of bread."}
{"text":"This is a great spot to pick up a fresh loaf of bread in Northwest Vegas. The service is friendly, and they always offer to slice you a generous portion of bread with butter to sample one of their creative flavors. They have a menu that shows which breads are baked fresh each day. So far, I've tried the S'mores, Potato Cheese, Pepperjack, Spinach and Feta, and Cinnamon Burst. The spinach loaf could use more feta. I tend to overlook their quick breads, but I recently tried a coconut pound cake that was delicious and moist. The scones are soft and have good flavor, but lack the flaky, buttery texture I look for in a scone.   Great Harvest's all-natural breads are best enjoyed on the day they are baked, or within a few days, which is the intention of baking them fresh."}
{"text":"Great way to start your morning! Scone and coffee. Great customer. Opens early and I grabbed  A loaf of sourdough bread."}
{"text":"Delicious breads and friendly service.  Be sure to pick up a menu to find out which breads they make for what day. But no matter which day you go (except Sunday cause their closed... =[ ) you will find something yummy to try... from their potato cheese bread to cinnamon pull apart to their spinach artichoke to their scones. And big samples each time! And their sandwiches uses fresh ingredients and they have basil mayo sauce... so good! Been meaning to try their bread bowl soups but haven't gotten around to it... I will eventually.  Just tried their mint chocolate chip cookie.. yummy."}
{"text":"How is it that I am standing in front of the register ready to order and the girl will not take my order ? I'm looking at her and she's looking at me but as soon as someone else walked in they can help someone else but not me. What a waste"}
{"text":"My blt was delish! The bread was definitely fresh and honestly... you could tell the sandwich was just made - including the bacon! We wanted to stop by Trader Joe's but were really hungry and this was an awesome option. The ladies at the counter were very nice. While I wish the sandwich came with chips, I'm actually glad it didn't because I felt healthy and satisfied when I left. My boyfriend also ordered tomato soup and it was a nice tomato soup for a quick restaurant stop."}
{"text":"The greatest bread place ever!!!!  I am a huge fan of fresh baked breads and so far the only bakery that met my match was Great harvest bakery!! You have to try their cranberry walnut bread loaf and their apricot orange marmalade bread, they are delightful! They take breads to a whole new level!!  This is a must try place for bread lovers!!!"}
{"text":"I was looking for somewhere to eat within walking distance from Eagle Heights and this place fit the bill. They had two kinds of bread to sample from, of which I chose the \"Dakota\": a soft, honey-sweetened wheat bread that's given a nice bit of crunch using sunflower, pumpkin, and sesame seeds. I liked it enough to select it for my sandwich, which was a B.L.A.T. (bacon, lettuce, avocado, and tomato). With two people ahead of me, it took about 5 minutes to get my order. Once I did, I walked over to the park just behind the store to enjoy the lovely weather and my sandwich, which was delicious!    At $7.00+ for just a sandwich (with a few exceptions), it's a little too pricey for me to go very often, but I'll probably be back to try their other bread/pastry offerings."}
{"text":"Locally owned baking place.... Made freshly everyday.... They sell what they bake today only... Good breakfast place..  They serve sandwichs, tea cake, muffins, different varities of bread... This is located next to trader joes...."}
{"text":"I was shopping in the strip mall where Great Harvest is located, and I was enticed by the \"breakfast sandwich\" board sitting out on University Avenue!!  I can't resist a good breakfast sandwich!! My son and I stopped in to check it out. I tried the signature breakfast sandwich which was simply egg and cheese (no meat for me) served on their cheesy biscuits.  It was made quickly and the biscuit was excellent!  They heated the biscuit up a little so it was warm and gooey. My son tried a salted caramel cookie, which might just be my new favorite cookie in the Madison area. It was huge and chewy and so, so good.  I don't know that Great Harvest will replace some of my favorite local bakeries, however I am very happy that I checked it out, and I look forward going back to try a sandwich and perhaps grab another cookie!"}
{"text":"Had the little Italian sandwich, it was amazing!!!  And the nitro iced affogato!!  Will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Last week I went in at around 8:00am and bought a Breakfast Roll which has elements of breakfast in it ... ham, egg, cheese, but bakedn in a whole wheat roll. It was stale and hard and ... although I tried ... ultimatedly inedible. I was very sad. I like the \"idea\" of Great Harvest Bread company but in actual life it's stale ... i had a deja vu of why I hadn't been back in over a year ... I had bought a morning muffin or breakfast roll a year ago .. it was stale.  And didn't go back until time passed and I forgot about the bad experience. Now I have 2 things to remind me not to go back in the future. I emailed the company and told of the staleness and ... no reply. So that's why I'm writing this review.  Update: I received this reply from the owner a week later ... so I will up my rating to 3 stars ...  Good Afternoon,    Thank you for taking the time to send us an e-mail about a less than satisfactory product you purchased in our bakery last Thursday.  First I have to appolgize for taking so long to get back to you.  As you may know this little shop is owned by our family, and with that we are always busy doing many things.  From Farmer's Markets on both Thursdays and Saturdays,  to baking 125 loaves of bread Saturday with a Church Youth Group for their moms on Sunday, visiting with folks at a local retirement home yesterday and a seminar I had commited to today.  Wow,  it's been a busy week, and that only covers the past 5 days.  I finally had a chance to check my e-mails.  The business e-mails go to my husband and he forwarded yours onto my personal e-mail so that I may answer you.     Anyways,  I appreciate your patience.  We do bake all of our breakfast rolls every morning.  The one that you purchased wouldn't have been old, but it would have had to have been overbaked to be inedible.  I really sincerely apologize for that.  We do make everything here in the bakery from scratch and with that sometimes leaves room for human error.     So to thank you for taking the time to send us an e-mail, I would like to make things right and offer you - your choice a sandwich or any loaf of bread.   My compliments of course.  I am typically here in the bakery Mon-Wed all day.  Thursday only 'til 1:00 - then off to a Farmers Market.  All day Friday. and another Farmers Market on Saturday.  We are closed on Sundays for family time.  I will be putting your name on our message board with instructions for a Free Sammie or Loaf of Bread.     Warmly,  Leslie Walston,  Owner Great Harvest Bread Co. 1730 ___________________________________________________  [update 5/30/10]: I did go back and unfortunately ordered a savannah bar and iced coffee. The savannah bar was okay but small. The iced coffee I had a sinking feeling as I saw the person pull dig the cut in a bucket of ice and proceed to pour hot coffee over it. This is going to water down by 50% an already weak coffee. I asked if she could give me a little less ice, she obliged but that just resulted in a dishwater, luke-warm watery coffee that was undrinkable. So I was foiled again. I sent an email to the owner again suggesting they serve full strenght coffee that's been kept in a refrigerator then poured over ice ... no reply back.  So I'm sorry to say I've downgraded my rating to 2 starts ** . And I'm sorry to say I will likley not go back. Too disappointing even though I want it to be better."}
{"text":"It was so much better a few years ago."}
{"text":"If you want anything bread, Great Harvest Bread Co. is the place to go. They cater, take online orders or you can just visit the shop itself and grab a bite. Great Harvest handcrafts bread daily using only pure and simple ingredients and never uses any chemicals, preservatives, conditioners or additives. This place is family owned (Ward and Leslie Walston) and has been serving the East Valley for some time now. I stumbled upon this place awhile back after visiting my dentist next door and ordered a pumpkin roll for a Fall party. Now I stop in regularly here and there for coffee and a pastry (they have a coffee and latte bar). The staff is very friendly and they have little store up front where you can pick up various items like jelly, bread mixes, etc."}
{"text":"My family has been going to the location in Tempe for about 6 months.  We come here about once a week for lunch.  The store has indoor and outdoor seating available which is nice in the cooler months.  Unfortunately, it does not have a lot of indoor seating which means during lunch hour in the summer, you might have trouble finding an indoor table especially if you have more then 2 people in your party.  The parking lot is also small and crowded, but that is just a result of the shopping center they are located in.  The food here is really good.  They often are giving free samples of the bread out when we come in.  I would say the food is moderately healthy.  The spicy turkey sandwich is really good as is the tuscan chicken sandwich.  They do have a lot of sweet treats though here like yummy lemon bars, giant cookies, and ice cream sandwiches.  I would give the food five stars for taste definitely!  Why we give it 4 stars over all is the service.  It is sometimes hard to get the staff's attention as they are too busy chatting with each other to attend the register.  They forget to give you your cookie or iced tea.  They are really slow to help you out sometimes.  I wouldn't recommend coming here on your lunch hour if you have to go back to work as you might not get fast enough service ie. 30 min + wait for your meal.  If you are retired or just going over to chat with your friends and eat a leisurely lunch, it is fine."}
{"text":"The bread is phenomenal here!!  We've been fortunate enough to get GH Bread at our favorite place in Mooresville, Josh's Farmer's Market.  This was our first stop to try their sandwiches.  he sandwiches were piled with delicious meats and cheeses and the freshest, tastiest toppings!  We are glad one just opened in Cornelius, which is a lot closer.  This is an absolute, \"MUST TRY\" lunch spot!! Thank y'all so much for a fantastic dining experience!!"}
{"text":"Who doesn't love bread?!! I am so hooked on this place its a bad habit!  I've been to both locations and their equally as delicious! The staff here is more friendly and outgoing! I really love how generous they are with the samples! You can come here everyday and have a free sample of different breads and loaf and never get tired of it! I came in looking for their Zucchini bread but they already had sold out by the time I got there BUT.. they had a mini sized version of the zucchini bread! I was so happy!   Also I found out this location has fresh baked doggy treats! Made in house and my dog King Louie LOVED it! I only brought him one because I didn't know if he would like it but I was wrong! They have a crunchy outside with a soft filling on the inside!   I have yet to try their sandwhiches which I know are probably crack just like their bread! Awesome customer service and such amazing bread! Once you try it you'll be hooked!   I've never had a bread here I didn't like! I am sold on GHBC!  ^__^"}
{"text":"Stopped in today after seeing several positive reviews. Totally agree with what's been said!  We had 2 great salads...a chicken salad and a ham/brie. Both were outstanding...the bread has good flavor/texture and each of the ingredients in the sandwiches came together to create a great flavor profile.  Super friendly staff handing out samples of a variety of products.  Best part...they were running a \"buy a sandwich get a loaf of bread free\" promo, so we left with 2 free loaves of bread! We sampled (and took) a loaf of the cinnamon chip...it was outstanding!  The sandwiches run around $7-8. They are decently sized, and the quality of the ingredients warrant the price. With a promo like we experienced today, we felt like we got a steal.  One thing to note...Great Harvest is closed on Sundays...we previously discovered this the hard (and sad) way :)"}
{"text":"This is the Best Bread place in town. Have always loved these guys for years. Came by this location to bring a friend for the 1st time. We came in a little after close without realizing it closed at 6. I explained my friend was coming for the 1st time. Kim was so nice & insisted she stay & look around. We each got a complimentary bread slice & a loaf of pumpkin spice bread. Which I now understand why they call it bread crack lol. Such a wonderful experience for me & my friend Bii. I think they just made a customer for life."}
{"text":"My family insists on this bread for sandwiches, toast, etc. at home. The sourdough is delicious toasted, but we also love the Dakota and 9 grain. I love that it is made with whole grains.   We love getting sandwiches made at the bakery as well. I prefer the Chicken Berry Pecan, but I also love the grilled cheese with soup. They put a garlic spread on it that puts it over the top.  My two other favorites are the Banana Walnut Bread and the sugar cookies. Oh my goodness, the sugar cookies!  I love them sooo much.   The staff is very friendly and willing to help. I've never had a bad experience there. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I love this place. The customer service gets better every time. They seem to be a little more friendly with their regulars but it is worth the wait. Yummy sandwiches,breads and pastries!!"}
{"text":"Had the Turkey Pesto sandwich, it had lots of flavor and bread was toasted perfectly. Turkey was moist too. Staff was inciteful and very hospitalable. Had a sample of a blueberry & cranberry bread, very soft and tasty as well. Dont forget the free jumbo cookie with a Yelp check-in!"}
{"text":"Good sandwiches with ample sizes. Prices are a bit high for a sandwich. I wish their menu was more extensive."}
{"text":"Quite a scrumptious place to grab a gourmet crafted sandwich. affordable food and friendly environment, also a quite place to simply relax and have a bite!  The staff is really friendly and the greet you in the way in and they say farewells as you leave, is just a nice nice place to grab a sandwich, also they offer all kinds of freshly, same day made bread! Try out a sample of their bread variety,  I guarantee you'll enjoy this place"}
{"text":"Great Harvest is an occasional treat for me.  I live alone, and it's rare I can finish an entire loaf of bread on my own, so every once in a while I will pop in for a Snickerdoodle, a loaf of Cinnamon Chip Bread or a scuffin.    Located right next to Trader Joe's, parking is a NIGHTMARE.  I have lived in the apartment complex behind this shopping center for 11 years and it has gotten almost impossible to find a parking spot on the weekend.  In particular if it's a pretty weekend when the greenway will be busy, so I walk whenever possible to avoid an incident.  (I also get my nails done a few doors down at Best Nails - that is a great little place too).    The good parts:  there are always samples available.  I have always found the staff to be friendly and helpful.  The cinnamon chip bread is delicious - when fresh, I could eat the entire loaf as-is.  Once it has a couple of days on it, I toast it with a smidge of butter or maybe a schmear of cream cheese.  Delish!  I have also had the cheddar garlic bread and it was quite good with a big plate of spaghetti and meatballs.  The garlic was a little strong for my taste, but I am weird like that - I am sure the bread is perfect for people with normal taste buds.    The sweets:  They have giant snickerdoodle cookies, which I am a big fan of.  They are good, nothing phenomenal, but they cure my cinnamon-sugar jones.  Cinnamon rolls are good (especially after being in the microwave for about 10 seconds).  I had some sort of peanut butter chocolate chip scuffin once and it was yum, but I haven't seen that one on the menu online for a while.  Had a sample of a turtle bar, so I got one of those - too rich, too much, and the sample was better than the big ole bar.    Be aware - they are closed on Sunday and Monday, and I believe they close at 6:00 during the week.  Since I have a full time job, unless the traffic gods are with me, I cannot get here during the week, which leaves Saturday when everyone and their mother is trying to cram into Trader Joe's.  While the stuff at Great Harvest is good, it is not worth the TJ/Greenway weekend battle to me.    In my head, the breads and sweets are always better than they are when I actually purchase them - but everything is fresh and flavored well, and I have never been disappointed with a purchase."}
{"text":"First time at a Great Harvest Bakery and was very pleased with the visit. The Turkey Pesto sandwich was spot on with quality ingredients and full of flavor. Their bread sampling station was a nice treat, and the fresh, still warm sourdough was delicious. The shop was clean, the staff welcoming, and they had a mix of kitchen items for sale as well. Looking forward to the next. Is it."}
{"text":"Sharon, get yo sandwiches together oh ma gawd :-( and the Christian music... I bet all the stars are from ur lil congregation next door. You can't even make a cookie right. Your employees were super awkward but 100% it's bc you were there. Ps i only wrote this review bc the 4.5 stars on Yelp are not deserved. At all.  Everything i ordered went in the trash. Literally. As in literally i threw it in the trash. Cookie also. What I don't want is for you to blame your employees (bc i can tell you do that): this is your shitty sandwich shop, girl."}
{"text":"I'm a little disappointed. Something changed. I was absolutely floored with this place when I first went (see previous review) but everytime I went back, it lacked a little bit more luster. They must have cut back on what breads they have because the last few times I went, all they had was white, wheat or sourdough. They're always out of the specialty breads. And the sandwiches - bread is dry and the whole sandwich is a little bland. What changed?! Last time I went, I had to go back up and ask for a side of hummus because the sandwich was soooo dry. This made it palatable but nowhere near deserving of the high price I paid. I think I'll just go to Port of Subs across the street. I'll only go here if I need a loaf for awesome french toast when we have guests - but other than that, I think our relationship has ended. :("}
{"text":"This isn't just a bakery. It's a part of the community and it serves up slices of heaven. The honey whole wheat is delicious and healthy. The same can be said about the whole wheat south dough (Wednesdays only). The whole wheat cinnamon raisin walnut bread is to die for (Thursday's only). All the treats are amazing. They have always been extraordinarily nice to me. Big smiles and hellos. It's an experience! Love. Love. Love."}
{"text":"I don't know how I've passed this place a million times and never gone in!! But today I finally did and boy am I glad I did! The staff was extremely nice and helpful to explain the different types of bread they had and how their made fresh! I tried the pumpkin spice bread and it was really moist and delicious and I ended up ordering a loaf to go along with a loaf cinnamon bread. Oh did I mention they make sandwiches and salads?? I tried the BLT and it is probably the best I've had! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We stopped by for lunch and ordered two sandwiches. We also redeemed the free cookies for each of our meals. The first sandwich came out it was excellent it was the roast beef sandwich. Delicious. After waiting for about 10 minutes we realized that the other sandwich was forgotten about. We stopped one of the waitresses and let her know that the sandwich was still being waited on. At that point they came back out and said they will reimburse us for the sandwich and give it to us for free. Excellent customer service they definitely did not lose a customer due to forgetting my sandwich."}
{"text":"The cookies are as big as my face !!!!!waaaaah !!!! I know really nice staff as soon as I came in they were attentive ....this place is a small little gem inside little Knick knacks of farm animals ,dogs ,cats etc ...snack items like popcorn and a section of variety of breads and a couple chairs and tables not a restaurant it deli feel .:::I ordered the breakfast sandwich with ham / cheese/ egg on honey oat bread and the snickerdoodle cookie both of which were really good !"}
{"text":"I would have taken a picture of the delicious Veggie Harvest sandwich I ordered, but I ate it too quickly because it was that good. I ordered my sandwich to be made with white bread (diet be damned!) and it was clearly very fresh, along with the vegetables. I sampled the cinnamon raisin bread as I waited for my sandwich, and that too was very yummy. They have an interesting selection of honey and fruit spreads that I didn't notice until I was already on my way out, so I guess this means I'll have to go back!"}
{"text":"Great tasting bread in a variety of tastes and textures. Some sweet or dessert types are available as well. This is a retail location only, does not have capacity to bake own bread. I enjoyed the complimentary tasting because I was starving. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place has one of the most friendliest staff! Great customer service! I got greeted coming in and was asked if I wanted to try a sample of their bread. It was not a small piece of sample neither; it was literally a whole slice of bread!   I ordered the following:  The Ruben: husband loved everything about it   Chicken n cran: my daughter absolutely loves this sandwich! I just wish it was more of a shredded chicken rather than cubed chicken just because it would've been easier for a toddler to feed themselves with.   Turkey sandwich: I loved it! Their sourdough bread is delicious! All freshly made bread!   Corn chowder: I absolutely love this soup! I'm a huge fan of corn chowder and this place has one of the best! Love it! I can eat this all day, everyday!"}
{"text":"Five stars for their cinnamon chip bread hot out of the oven!  Coffee is so-so but their bread is awesome!    I also had a chicken salad sandwich with their whole-grain oat bread which was also very good.   I believe they have a sandwich special during the weekdays.   I am told they have gluten-free bread on Wednesdays."}
{"text":"I guess I get to be the first to tell you that that this place has the right stuff! If you've been to the location on Mallard Creek in Charlotte, you should be glad to know that it's the same owners. This location is a house turned restaurant with an authentic rustic feel right on the main strip in Cornelius.  Walk in and you are immersed in sweet and savory smells of quickbreads, muffins, swirled cheese loafs, brownies, the list could go on and on! My favorite treat at Great Harvest is the Savanah Bar. They have a different flavor every day but my favorite is the berry blend, made with whole grain and rolled oats, it's great as a filling snack or an after lunch treat.  This past week I tried a hot sandwich for the first time, the Smoked Turkey, it was fantastic. They toast it in a beautiful pattern (seriously, check out my pictures) and stuff a mountain of turkey on top of lettuce, tomato, peppers and onions, and drizzle a sweet balsamic glaze on top. It's the best sandwich I've had in Cornelius.  Their speciality loafs are great crowd-pleasers for your next dinner party. Take a look at the daily menu on their website and try to go on a day when they have the pepperoni and cheese swirl loaf. Toasted with butter it's great to use as a gourmet sandwich at home or just to munch on it's own. As with the sweets, they do different loafs everyday so be sure to check the menu!  Cornelius, I envy you. And I hope that you take the time to go and see why Great Harvest is such a unique spot. Their friendly staff will let you sample all of the daily specials and make you feel right at home."}
{"text":"Fresh bread, great service, and a free cookie with check in!!!! Do I need to continue? You walk in to really friendly greetings! They had four breads to choose from for samples and you get generous slices with the option of a layer of butter. I chose the pumpkin bread and he got the spinach. We were both hooked! They have different breads baked daily and at 9am they were all just coming out the oven for the day! So their list is posted online and in store so if you want a specific kind of loaf you might want to check. We saw today was challah as it's Friday so that makes sense. They cut a fresh loaf as I had asked about the quality. She then offered it to us in three different ways, rolls, braided loaf or regular loaf depending how we wanted to serve it and for whom. We ended up getting the cinnaswirl, the last from yesterday but the little ones fave as like a big cinnamon roll- it even falls apart like one! Also a braided challah to make into French toast.  The place is clean, customer service is top notch and the quality is great. They gave us a punch card too! The free cookie we chose was like a giant lofthouse sugar cookie and it was so good and fresh! Definitely will go back as the sandwiches look and sound great too!"}
{"text":"This location is great!!!!  It started with Tim who took my preorder on Wednesday. He was quite helpful and efficient. Then when I got there today the place was quaint and neat. Unlike other locations you can see your bread options and drink options on the customer side of the counter which is nice. Lori was quite helpful and friendly. She took our order, helped mke choices and explained it all. Then she gave us our bingo cards for August which if you buy certain things and get bingo you get a free loaf of daily bread in August. Then they enter you into a gift card drawing. Nice!!! The menu is nice for a quick breakfast or lunch sandwich. I got a turkey melt essentially with build my own and grilled it. So yummy on light wheat! My friend got a build your own salad and it was nicely done. We got combos and it comes with a muffin or cookie and we both got one for the kids otherwise too much food! They have four bread options to chose from at this location to taste.  Got three different special breads as had buy 2 get 1 coupon from the downtown farmers market. The breads are fresh and good, the cinnamon swirl makes good French toast and they all are good in the freezer for awhile. This location has more specialty bread options nice variety! The only reasons not five stars is soooo far away and more healthy options would be nice! This location has different owners than the other one I visited and I like the service and perks at this one better."}
{"text":"Seriously? Get me away from this place. I am addicted! Every time I come in I buy more than what I originally showed up to get and I blame that on the free samples.  I love love love everything that I have tried. The staff is so friendly and their baked goods are off the charts.  So far I've tried the ham and cheese breakfast roll, the mud bar, the oatmeal chocolate chip cookies (yes chocolate chip because reasons don't belong and cookies!), the cinnamon chip bread, the Tuscan herb, sourdough and the breakfast blast is to die for.  Don't pass this place up. I highly recommend a weekly visit."}
{"text":"I'm a regular at their new Cornelius so I thought I'd refresh myself with the North Charlotte store today.  Its tiny! Well, maybe cozy is a better word. There's very limited seating and if there are more than 3-4 in line then the seating is sure to feel cramped. Oh well, I'll manage for breads and baked goods that are as divine as the ones they crank out! Well maintained and friendly staff are a plus.  I tried the Sweet Potato Muffin today and was charmed with a light and moist Muffin that was very filling! It had just the right amount of sweet potato to give it that Late Summer- Fall flavor I've pined for since the end of the holidays last year! Just wait till October for the pumpkin spice madness to start please!   I've got a berry blend savannah bar for an afternoon treat. What is a savannah bar? Why don't you find out for yourself, they give our generous samples of all the daily specials!  Be sure to check the menu for great breakfast and lunch sandwiches and soups as well. I know I'm going to have a great day when it starts with Great Harvest! Their bread's are synonymous with the Cornelius location's menu as that location gets all their bread baked here (The sweets are made on-site at each respective store)."}
{"text":"On the way into town, I googled \"best sandwich Henderson Nevada\" and this was one of the first places that popped up.  The two sandwiches I had were heavenly, and the service was so extremely friendly that, quite frankly, it makes most other places pale in comparison.  I don't live in the area, but I will definitely be returning here again next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Great service and excellent food. Wish I lived in the area. I'll be back before we leave and in the future when we visit."}
{"text":"Ordered a simple BLT that had 4 very skinny pieces of fatty bacon on it and a sliver of lettuce and tomato. I wish that I would have taken a picture of this sandwich because it was the thinnest sandwich I have ever seen. I'm a little upset with myself that I didn't take it back to the register and ask for my money back. Basically it was two slices of bread with mayo, because that's pretty much all I tasted."}
{"text":"Excellent Craft Sandwiches  Took them forever to open but now they are open. Seems like every restaurant that moves into the space has some sort of problem with the City.  My Hair Stylist  is in the building next door and last time I had my hair cut, she gave it a great recommendation. I no longer pay  to have a hair cut but rather pay a finders fee because it has gotten king of sparse.  In any case, we voted early at the Cornelius Town Hall, made a trip down to Huntersville and and came back here for a late lunch.  It's an old house that I've dined in three times, each time was a different restaurant.  It's billed a bakery and we did not get any baked goods other that the Bread the Sandwiches were made of and I will admit, the bread was excellent.  Walked in and picked up a couple of menu and sat down to review. I'm have problems with my hip so my wife went to the counter to order.  She came back with our drinks and a tent for the table with the number 6 on it.  She ordered the Ham and Brie Sandwich while I went with the Hot Smoked Turkey. Both came with a small cup of three bean salad.  Must say, i was impressed with my sandwich and my wife was happy with her's as well. Plenty of meat and excellent topping and again the bread was excellent.  Somewhat small and the front stairs are a bit difficult to navigate for someone having trouble walking or climbing stairs but there is a handicapped ramp in the back.   Two sandwiches and two Iced Teas came to $19.75 before tax and $21.38 after tax. Not the least expensive sandwiches in the are but one of the best in terms of quality."}
{"text":"Stopped by on a Saturday while exploring and we couldnt have been happier with this hidden gem. The woman behind the counter offered us free samples of their breads and we each got a HUGE slice! I even got a second slice to sample and bought a loaf. Prices are very fair and the bread is delicious. Im planning on going here every week!"}
{"text":"What a pleasant and bustling little bakery! I can't go near the Trader Joe's next door without peeping in its windows to see what fresh baked goodies are screaming at me from the display case. They change daily.   The fresh breads are excellent but I really go for the sweets, my favorites being the Savannah Bars and the ginger spiced cookies. The muffins are huge and flavorful (and can be very filling). They serve sandwiches but they are just okay.   Service is always friendly and helpful. This place is a Gotta Try (especially if you go to Trader Joes)."}
{"text":"I've lived and worked on the corner of McClintock and Warner and never stopped here, today was the day. Shame on me.  Adorable little sandwich shop, bread, cookies, sandwiches, sweets for sale. Today I decided to get a couple different sandwiches. One hot, one cold and eat them both throughout the day. Normally I would roll my eyes at the amount of bread on a sandwich, but the panni bread was outstanding, messy but a great sandwich. 2nd was the cobb on wheat, a little disappointed when opened my 2nd sandwich and it was plain old wheat bread. BUT....the sandwich was great, great avocado and spinach on it. I'm a fan of both. I always try to support the little guy, so I will dump my usual sandwich place and make the hike across the street to here!! I was so tempted to grab a package of cookies, but I didn't see and macadamia nut around, so I saved myself a 1000 calories today."}
{"text":"What am I addicted to here? What am I addicted to here? What am I addicted to here? What am I addicted to here? OK so I like there bread. Maybe I have a problem. It could be the cinnamon swirl. It might be the Spinach Feta. I'm  not sure. My biggest problem is when they're  closed or when they're menu revolves and then I  have to start a new addiction because the bread I'm currently addicted isn't being made and they say here's a free taste. It's ok. Just try it. It won't hurt you. Then the cycle starts all over again."}
{"text":"Best sandwiches ever! Ive eaten here 3 days a week at times.  Get the turkey with cranberry and basil mayo grilled.  Then take home a loaf and a cookie... Nom nom"}
{"text":"I was on my lunch break and decided to stop in and try a sandwich. It wasn't busy and I was greeted by a very nice woman, I was offered a slice of bread to try. I chose the pumpkin chocolate chip. It was delicious and very fresh. I then ordered their chicken salad on sourdough bread. It was the best chicken salad I have ever had. Home made and very flavorful. I'm so excited to go back!"}
{"text":"Love this place for their fresh bread, because who doesn't love delicious fresh baked bread! Haha however, I dread coming here do to customer service. It's always slow, never really personable, AND when I was in this morning, the lady working was wearing gloves, I'm thinking great! NOT! Instead of changing gloves after handling money, or fixing food, or dealing with another customer, she just washes them. You know, like you'd wash your hands, then drys them off, and continues on with her tasks or whatever else she has going on. Not very hygienic! AND, I didn't even get asked if I wanted a sample!  But it's not about the sample, lady, please! Just change your gloves in between taskings!!"}
{"text":"I was in the mood for a good simple fresh turkey sandwich and this place really delieved! The bread is fresh, very fresh actually :-) They make it there plus they will give you samples of it. When they asked me if I wanted a sample I said sure thinking it was a small peice but he handed over a large slice! I would have been happy with a nibble ;-)"}
{"text":"Just tried this place for the first time. So so so impressed. The owners Leslie and Ward were so sweet. Found out they've been there 9 yrs, which is awesome for a small business. I got the chicken salad sandwich with their fresh sourdough. It was prefect. The veggies in in were fresh and crisp, the house roasted pecans were delish. Hubby got the chimichurri (I know that's prob spelled wrong) roast beef. Just as delish. Plenty of meat and the sauce was not over powering. He chose their fresh jalapeño cheddar bread... so good. Soft and chewy texture like a good bread should have. The absolute key to a great sandwich is the bread. This place hit it out of the park. 100% will be back."}
{"text":"Great Harvest Bread Company is one of our favorite places to eat for a casual, healthy lunch. The food is delicious, the staff friendly and expedient."}
{"text":"For under $10, you can have a meal: sandwich of your choice, with everything picked out by you, including the type of bread, drink, chips and freshly baked cookies!!  I had the turkey avocado sandwich on whatever was the bread of the day. The place is cute and the workers were friendly and welcoming. I had a great time chatting with  a friend while eating. Located on 215/Decatur next door to Cici's/Best Buy across from Walmart shopping plaza."}
{"text":"An excellent option with many different lunch-meats available. I recommend the Chimichurri Roast Beef. The sandwiches and pricing are fair. You're getting a good quality sandwich. The bread is fresh and staff is helpful with their recommendations. There are also a few secret off-menu items. Kid friendly and also a nice outside option for your meal.   Service is friendly.  Parking is easy."}
{"text":"Hands down the best, home made type sandwich I have ever had, real comfort food.  It's real bread slices, not that sub crap.  The bread selection is great, different recipes made each day. Customer service is also spot on and you get to try what they have on the cutting board.  Awesome place!"}
{"text":"Great service at this location!  After the horrible service I received at the Marks Street location, I had decided that I would never enter another Great Harvest ever.  However, their products are so good and I need an already baked bread for a recipe I've found, so I went to this store.  The two women that were working were courteous and provided me with information regarding the amount of time they guarantee their bread before it goes bad.  When I entered, they only had a few loafs of bread to sample and the girl behind the counter assured me that she was willing to open a new loaf of bread from the shelf if what I wanted to sample wasn't currently on their cutting board.  I live near Blue Diamond and will make the drive to North Las Vegas in order to purchase from a store that is well versed on the proper treatment of paying customers."}
{"text":"Stopped by to pick up some baked goods after shopping the farmers market across the street on a Saturday morning. Excellent baked goods, friendly staff, and nice ambiance. My grandson sampled one of their cinnamon rolls and liked them so well I took a couple home. I also got a lemon bar for my lemon loving husband (he said it was extremely lemony without being overly sweet). I will stop by again in the future when in this neighborhood."}
{"text":"love love love great harvest bread. the service is always friendly and helpful. right when you walk in you get to sample a huge slice of one of their fresh breads of that day. the bread is amazing. baked with lots of love. my favorite is the oat bran and high \"five\" fiber. since a whole loaf is too big for me to eat by myself in the fresh of days i have discovered that freezing half of it and putting it in the fridge for when when i am ready to bring the other half on works out really well. i don't mind spending 6 dollars on a loaf of this homemade bread. i know what i am getting when i pay for it and being the little health nut i am i can't beat this. don't plan on making a trip on sunday though. the only day they are closed."}
{"text":"This bread shop offers a wonderful variety of delicious breads and treats. Their special breads for the different holidays are unmatched by any other bakery. My favorite is the cinnamon chip or extreme cinnamon, toasting it makes it melt in your mouth with so much flavor. Their muffins and scuffing are also great breakfast  treats. I would recommend going in and trying their samples and I guarantee you will be hooked. Also, the staff is friendly and anxious to help."}
{"text":"I work in the same complex as Great Harvest, so I end up stopping in out of convenience for a coffee on occasion.  Pretty decent coffee, but I'll drink anything that isn't weak like Dunkin Donuts (sorry Dunks...love your donuts though!) coffee.  The best part about this coffee ritual is the \"sample\" of bread they offer you.  Seriously, this has been my breakfast on more than one occasion.  So so tasty!  There is nothing better than freshly baked bread topped with flavored butter/jam, and the fact it is a good sized portion is a bonus!  I have also had their turkey sandwich, and found it to be good as well.  The bread definitely makes the sandwich taste very homemade.  I like that the store is family owned (within a franchise), as it is obvious a lot of hard work goes into the workings of the store.  In my opinion it's worth shelling out an extra buck if it's going to a family vs corporate america.  But...on the money note....I had to dock a star for the prices.  I would love to buy their bread, but really can't afford $7 for a loaf.  Their jams are also a bit more than I am willing to spend, or I'd have one of every flavor in my fridge! It doesn't keep me away...I just try to keep my visits spaced out a bit more.  Kudos Great Harvest!"}
{"text":"It's a great, homemade feeling sandwich, that makes you feel good about what you ate. Not like panera, where I'm worried about how many calories are on their butter-encrusted bread.  They give out free samples as soon as you walk in. My fav bread is the red, white, and blue. Plus, they're super friendly!"}
{"text":"I have driven by this spot for the past nearly 10 years since I've lived in AZ, but today was my first time calling in for a take-out order after reviewing several positive yelp reviews...  The staff member who took my call sounded very sweet and she was helpful.  Since I called approximately 20min before closing I told her that I would like to order their most popular hot sandwich, she informed me that was theTuscan Chicken Pannini.   I would have liked to try one of their soups, but she told me that they already dismantled their soups for the day since they were closing shortly ... It is a pet peeve when businesses do this, especially in the food industry.  Simply put ... If your open until 6:00 I should be able to order soup until that time, unless you ran out of product, which simply was not the case....   I also would have liked to try an egg white breakfast sandwich, but she said they ran out of egg whites ...  This business is very pleasant to walk into ... It has character and personality - very cool spot filled with all sorts of freshly baked goods.  I informed the person behind the counter that this was my first time in .... She kindly offered me a few samples of their freshly made breads, which I will admit all tasted quite good.... Definitely impressive, and I could tell the product was fresh!! ;)   The Tuscan Chicken Pannini was quite tasty for the most part ... The fillings were plentiful and the focaccia bread was yummmy, but the actual chicken meat was just okay tasting for me ... Which is why I rated 4 stars ... It just didn't taste like excellent quality meat.    Overall, I will return here since its only a few miles from home, and I will try out some of their other sandwiches and hopefully soups .... Definitely the place is the \"GO TO\" spot for bread, but I try to stay away from all the carbs ... The price was reasonable for the portion size. I would highly recommend others to try out Great Harvest Bread! :)"}
{"text":"Great Spot! Great food, wonderful, friendly staff!!!!! Only negative was all the eating area was pretty dirty, just needed a little TLC in the cleaning department."}
{"text":"Best bread around! I grew up eating great harvest bread and it has  ever disappointed!"}
{"text":"Been quite a while since I reviewed this place.  Honestly we don't come here that often.  It's not really on our way to anyplace we usually go.  But this time it was, so we stopped in.  The format is basically the same.  Their basic breads are same as always.  We got a loaf of 9-grain.  If I was rating on just that I'd go with 4 stars.  But we tried a few unique items and they weren't really \"4-star\" items.    The Mexican chocolate bread was interesting.  I didn't like the pumpkin seeds.  I wish it had been a bit more chocolatey.  I ended up putting some chocolate sauce on a slice and nuking it for 10 seconds.  It helped.  There is a bit of a chile kick in there, too.  The other unique item was \"stuffing bread\".  As the name implies it tastes just like turkey stuffing.  Kinda weird, actually.  Sandwiches are not \"right\" with this (though I didn't have any turkey or I might have tried it as a turkey sandwich).  We ended up stuffing some game hens with it, and it came out like stuffing.  Their cinnamon babka was \"just ok\".  Not bad.  Not four stars, but not bad.  I would say this is my second choice for a bakery right now.  My first choice also isn't on our way to anywhere, so we don't go there often either.  I like their breads a bit better, but they don't do experimental items like the Mexican chocolate bread.  Great Harvest is actually a bit closer to our office, so I'm sure we'll keep coming here from time to time."}
{"text":"Very Disappointed!  Worse customer service ever!!!  To the owners Stop hiring teenagers they don't care about your business .. We have been coming here for years   But  the past few times have been Bad we stopped coming but decided  to try again . The heavy blond girl was very rude  I asked  her about the  different kinds of Breads  that they carry and all she said was that's all we have  she was very short and snotty ,I was trying to ask her when they would have other kinds  but she really didn't  care ..    Don't waste your time on the overpriced dry bread and rude teenagers..."}
{"text":"I have ordered their box of treats multiple times and WOW it is amazing. Every time I call they are always so friendly and they offer a free sample when you pick up. Called one afternoon to pick up the next morning and they said no problem. Great place for a treat and looking forward to trying lunch there as I have heard lunches are amazing and fresh."}
{"text":"After several referrals I decided to visit this location. Cashier was welcoming and very  informative about menu items. However, I was not pleased with her coworker. She was eating product while packaging food. (Without gloves) After we made eye contact she then went into the backroom behind a rack and then started to eat a cookie."}
{"text":"This delicious gem never disappoints. The staff is so very friendly and accommodating! My husband and I LOVE their California Cobb on Dakota. Unfortunately because of their hours, we don't get to eat there much, but it's probably better for our waistlines! And the smell, oh my goodness. I wish I could bottle it up and make a candle out of it! Highlight recommend! They have salads, sandwiches, sweets and everything in between so it is definitely a high recommendation on my list!"}
{"text":"This 5 star rating is based on the sandwiches, which are fantastic. I came here twice the first week I discovered it. In particular, I like the chicken salad sandwich. I'm also very fond of the roast beef sandwich. Service here is super. It's a neat environment. And the parking lot is easy to get in and out off."}
{"text":"Well Great Harvest, you outdid yourself today, Ill tell you. Thanks for wasting my time, and I hope others heed the warning.  You proclaim you're open at 7:30am on Saturday, I was in your parking lot at 8:20am and you were closed.  An instant 1 star review.  It's no wonder small companies like yourself don't stay in business, your asses can't even open up on time on a Saturday.  What a joke"}
{"text":"They make really high quality bread here.    I've been buying their bread for a few years at the Saturday Farmers Market on Roadrunner Park.  I love the pumpkin seed bread.  This weekend, I loved the gingerbread snap cookies.  So soft, chewy, and yummy.  Goes down great with a cup of cold whole milk (organic lactose free is what I drink).  Also their mini cinni buns are really good."}
{"text":"Great stuff!   My \"go-to\" favorite is Honey Whole Wheat, but the Jalapeno Cheese is fantastic, and the Apple Scrapple is just delightful.   I recently tried blueberry cheesecake bread.  This is \"Heaven in a Bread Store!\""}
{"text":"Great Harvest has the BEST breads and goodies. And don't miss their great sandwiches, filled with all the fixings. The staff is ultra friendly and you can't beat the free large \"tasting\" samples. You can't go wrong at Great Harvest."}
{"text":"The staff was nice, not overly friendly but a nice bunch of teenagers. I had the pastrami sandwich and it was okay. I wanted to purchase one of their specialty breads but decided against it after spending $11.00 on a sandwich combo that was just okay. The next time I go, I'll forgo the combo and just buy the bread, it looked very tasty."}
{"text":"Morning Yelp! Tall lady in search of YUMMMMMY Peach Honey I bought at a Great Harvest in Colorado. They didn't have it here BUT I was offered Cinnamon Honey but took a sample of this Cinnamon Bread with butter, Bread Pudding, and Coconut Loaf. My favorite was the coconut as it was fragrant and tasted slightly sweet.  I checked in and used the soft drink voucher and had breakfast in my car. Walked away with a Salted Caramel Cookie and a new place to hang out with friends.  Atmosphere: Reminds me of Colorado Coffee Shops...very chill music, folks come abd go, quiet and calming with caffeine and food. Great potential for a meet up or a \"get to know you\" kinda date.  Cost: About $8 for a loaf BUT its the best tasting bread you'll ever have. They have sandwiches and honey and jams too. Inexpensive-Slightly Expensive.  Samples: Are a thing and you should always try with butter bcuz...BUTTER.   Service/Staff on my visit: Sweet ladies, kind smiles, great spirits.  Verdict? Will be returning."}
{"text":"I walked by this morning and decided to check it out. Very friendly greetings!  They offered several samples - the raspberry&blueberry bar was really good.  I ordered a Chai latte (skim) and scone of the day (chocolate chip with macademia nuts). The chai wasn't as spicy as I'm accustomed to, but it's very smooth and creamy. The scone was definitely my favorite. I usually get scones from Panera and Whole Foods (the harder and dryer ones you need to dip into milk), but this was super soft and delicious.  I recommend trying out this place."}
{"text":"Saw a recent review from one of the trusty Yelpers giving this place a 5 star rating, so I had to give it a try.  Besides who can pass up the carb overload with so many options.  The store is very easy to find and super clean when you walk in.  I was met with a friendly smile and hello from Caitlyn and Kim working the counter.  The place was packed with various breads and the smells from everything baking was amazing.  Kim guided my little man over to the sample bread display, and after some short consideration he made his choice.  (which he loved).  Thank you to both of you.  Your customer service was amazing.  Besides bread they offer a variety of sandwiches, deserts, ect.  On this occasion I went with a toasted Turkey Pesto sandwich, a cinnamon swirl (for the morning) and I made sure to check in for the free giant cookie; which was oatmeal chocolate chip today.  The sandwich was super simple with thinly sliced Turkey, lettuce, tomato, and onion.  What put this sandwich over the edge was the slightly toasted bread and amazing sauce.  Defiantly will be having it again.  The cookie was perfectly cooked and I am in anticipation for the morning coffee to partake in this cinnamon swirl delight.  With a super friendly staff, great food, and a mellow atmosphere; I must agree with my fellow Yelper, five stars for you Great Harvest Bread.  Only regret is I didn't find you sooner.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Yummy bread, different types and flavors, they have a menu that changes depending on the day and season.  They also give out free samples with butter if you want, and it's pretty tasty. I think I definitely enjoy the asiago sourdough bread, and the lemon blueberry cake.... There's also a cherry white chocolate bread that's delish!  They have a ham sandwich that's good too..."}
{"text":"4.5 stars.  We've had bread, muffins and scones from Great Harvest Bread a few times and their baked goods are delicious. I particularly like their sweet potato muffins, blueberry streusel muffins, and cinnamon chip bread. Whenever we visit Trader Joe's next door we can't resist stopping in to buy something. They have a nice selection of breads, scones, muffins, sandwiches and more. You're sure to find something you'll love of their offerings.   Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"This place is a pure jewel. I have never been to such an excellent bakery.  Everything I have had, from the scones, muffins, and cookies, to the breads, is so fresh and wonderful tasting.  The staff is very friendly.  To top things off, you get free coffee!  I am hooked and a regular."}
{"text":"Best sandwich place in town!!! My workplace even won a box of bread for leaving our business card and they delivered it. This is definitely my go to spot when I'm craving a sandwich."}
{"text":"This place is seriously thee best!  Never along wait, very friendly staff and a big variety of food. They have different breads every day so if you go on a Monday don't expect the same thing on a Wednesday same with their soups they change from day to day. They also make their own jams, jellies, ect. LOVE their chocolate chip pumpkin bread and red white and blueberry or something like that both were very good! Tip for if you don't eat a lot of bread but want to purchase a loaf to take home, cut it up in slices, put in freezer bags, and freeze. Take a bag out when you feel like a sweet treat! Oh and they make their own dog treats so you can treat your pooch too! It's a win win win WIN!"}
{"text":"I've found my hidden gem for bread!   Was headed to Subway for some soup and saw the great harvest outdoor signage from the corner of my eye .. Decided to try this place out instead .. Ordered the grilled cheese which was to die for! I love anything cheesy .. Mmm ..  they were also giving samples of their daily bread and it was so fresh and delicious that I decided to purchase a loaf (caramel apple). Which BTW is very inexpensive  Service was great as well .. Two thumbs up   I'll be back for more, probably this week :)"}
{"text":"Great little bakery with all kinds of delicious goodies. The employee behind the counter was very helpful and there were plenty of items for sample.  The loaf of Cinnamon Burst bread I chose is incredibly moist, not too sweet, and great just by itself. A little pricey, but definitely worth it. Looking forward to trying more of the menu here in the future!"}
{"text":"This place is now my new favorite sandwich spot! Their food speaks for itself. Customer service also gets 5 stars"}
{"text":"Oh my the bread here is AWESOME yall. My family LOVES their bread, doesn't everyone though? They literally make it fresh/daily, every time I go buy a loaf it's so warm & it has that fresh bread aroma. I tried their honey whole wheat, farmhouse white, and cinnamon bread. Your missing out if you haven't check this place out yet! When your eating their bread you KNOW your eating like real bread not just the basic bread from your local grocery store- trust me you can just tell the huge difference between the taste & texture! (Trust me, I know my bread lol!!)"}
{"text":"Food was good and it was a great place to set up to get some work done. Good coffee, food, and free WiFi. Much better alternative to Starbucks."}
{"text":"This is a good lunch spot. It's kind of hard to find, hidden in a shopping center. The store is a bit cramped, but they have a nice patio. The people that work there are quite friendly.  The roast beef sandwich was great. The beef itself was lean, and the fresh honey wheat bread was good too.   In addition to the cafe menu, they have cookies, breads, and other treats that all looked really good."}
{"text":"Always a great experience here with really delicious samples to try out along with goodies like fresh baked cookies."}
{"text":"Ordered 4 sandwiches and all were wrong. Every sandwich had pesto and mayo on them. Don't waste your time if you want a breakfast sandwich."}
{"text":"I used to live a couple miles away, and I didn't realize how lucky I was until I moved about 15 minutes away.  I still try to stop in here most weeks for a loaf some of the best sandwich bread out there.  Yes, they are just a little bit more expensive than a store bought loaf, but I will take a family owned, quality, non preservative laced loaf of bread any day rather than the crap you can buy at the grocery store.  These loaves easily last a week or more without going moldy too, at least in my experience, and with NO preservatives.  Look at the ingredient list on the Honey Whole Wheat:  Whole wheat flour, salt, yeast, water, and honey.  How can you get better than that?  Trust me, you get one of their sandwich loaves and toast it with some high quality cold cuts and veggies, and you've got one of the best healthy meals out there.  I've had the Honey Whole Wheat, Harvest White, Sourdough, Challah, Cinnamon Raisin, and many of their special swirled loaves over the years, and you can tell this is a place that cares about what they put out.  Just good people.  Also, the Virginia rolls that they only seem to make around holidays are the stuff my dreams are made from.  And don't even get me started on the Pumpkin Chocolate Chip dessert loaves...just one word for them:  damn!  Now if I can just get them to open up a location in SE Chandler..."}
{"text":"Great bread! I love the roast beef sandwich and chimchurri sauce. Had it a few times now and I'm always happy with my lunch. Cute little restaurant and home feel decor. I love coming here. Very simple order process. Will definitely keep coming back!"}
{"text":"One of our soon to be regular indulgences!!  Can't seem to get past the cinnamon chip bread to try many of the others delectables yet but that's the goal!"}
{"text":"This place makes 'THE' best bread I've ever tasted.  They use just plain, traditional ingredients with no preserves or other crap you typically find in factory produced breads --they even grind their own whole wheat!  I've had several of their breads, cookies, and brownies, all of which were amazing.  If you're unsure about something, they have a full range of their products you can sample.  Here are some I'd highly recommend:  *Whole Grain Goodness *Honey Whole Wheat *White *Peanut Butter Chocolate Chip Cookie *Cosmic Brownies  Since the first time I shopped here, I haven't purchased baked products anywhere else."}
{"text":"Cozy, friendly -- and wonderful bread. Cream cheese frosting on the cinnamon buns is so yummy! Free samples too!  GH is the kind of business that neighborhoods need."}
{"text":"Wow. I wish I came here sooner!!! The customer service is fantastic to say the least! The bread samples were nothing short of mouth watering and my sandwich was way more than I expected. I got the Little Italy and it was far from little, and all delicious! This is my new favorite sandwich place without a doubt!"}
{"text":"Great place, great eats, plus they have a rewards program. The more you buy, the more surprises you get, like a free  cookie,  free loaf or a free sandwich, who doesn't like free yummies. Love this place."}
{"text":"The bakery is small but impressive, especially for a bread shop like theirs.  My husband and I walked in not really knowing what to expect.  We got there late in the day so there wasn't much selection, but we got a loaf of their cinnamon chip bread.  The loaf was gone in two days.  Needless to say I went back and got 2 more for our family.  Clean location, well maintained, great staff & service, definitely get there early to get the best selection of products.  Oh!  They also offer tastings as well.  :)"}
{"text":"VERDICT: Come for the delicious bread, leave for the atmosphere.  I really like Great Harvest Bread Co.  They do regular sliced bread a service, by making it fresh, preservative free and delicious.  The difference between Great Harvest Bread and Panera is dramatic.  Great Harvest shies away from croissants and danishes.  Instead they focus on white, wheat, and various other basic sliced breads.  They are really good though.  It really makes you detest going back to the normal grocery store fodder.  The downfall, as is with quality, is the price, about $5-$6 per loaf.  They also have cookies and a few bready desserts.  Part deux of this review really has to focus on the experience and atmosphere.  First, I was really excited to find a Great Harvest over by my Costco on Decatur.  I forced Greg to pull over and rush in.  However, there was a group of six or so teenage n'er-do-wells also approaching the store at the same time.  I was determined to get to the store before them and told Greg to hurry or they were going to beat us to the door.  He said, \"don't worry, they'll eat up the free samples and you'll get a fresh loaf to sample\".  He just said that because he is a lollygagger and hates to \"pick up the pace\".  I must be getting old since I've already used the terms \"n'er-do-well\" and \"lollygagger\" in this post.  Anyway, I let the hooligans beat me to the store.  Inside the narrow store, the teenagers turned out to be less of a threat.  It appeared to be closeted gay boys with their Christian-youth-group-approved girlfriends out having a wild time by venturing to the bread store to get a couple of sandwiches and get an inappropriate amount of free samples.  You know, basically being complete rebels.  They were kind of too outwardly excited about their bread samples in a wholesome way, saying things like \"I love bread\" and \"bread rocks\".  It was like those Totino pizza roll ads where the kids wax feverishly about their love of frozen food.  This process actually took a long time, giving me an ample amount of time to give Greg the I-told-you-so eye for being a lollygagger.  Something I'm sure he was oblivious to noticing.  During this time, I was also able to look around at all of the customers sitting at tables.  There were quite a few of them.  I would say at least ten people scattered through the sitting area.  Then it struck me as being incredibly odd.  Every single person was facing the counter.  Every single person was not eating, drinking, or talking.  They were just staring at the counter.  I felt this existential feeling like I was starring in Sartre's \"No Exit\".  They were the audience and I didn't know that I was in the play.  It was bizarre.  I know, I know, I often accuse restaurants of being cults, as in crEATe and the nearby Salad Creations, but I think I'm on to something. It was odd.  I have no idea what is going on there.  In any case, I get the counter with my Dakota wheat bread (sooooo gooood).  I get my choice of free samples and the girl behind the counter offered me the heel of the bread.  Those n'er-do-well, hooligan, gays and their beards stole my chance for a decent sample.  And Greg's lollygagging didn't help either."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Everyone needs to know that not only is this bakery an amazing place to get breads, desserts, sandwiches, etc for your whole grain loving friends, it is also a great place to get gluten-free breads and cookies on Tuesdays and Wednesdays! The GF goodies are specially baked on Mondays at their Rea Rd bakery so as to avoid cross-contamination issues. Amazing. Check it out and spread the word...   House favorites ... ** Cinnamon chip bread. Great house-warming gift. Excellent in French Toast. Also comes in a gluten-free version. ** Dakota - Vegan sandwich bread!! Also comes in a gluten-free version. Sooo good!   They aren't making GF sandwiches because they have not sorted out the cross-contamination issues yet, but I have my fingers crossed that a Great Harvest sandwich will be in my future very soon..."}
{"text":"My friends brother recommended this place for a good sandwich or salad and it did not disappoint! I got the BLT and it was such a yummy sandwich! If I lived locally I would eat here every chance I got!"}
{"text":"I love this place.... Way too much!  Everything is fresh and delicious.  Ingredients are real and wholesome.  The sandwiches are amazing!    Awesome breads, cookies and treats!  S'mores bars....woahhhhhhh.  I have two gripes... Be open on Sunday when I do my grocery shopping at neighboring Trader Joes, and also please have Gluten free consistently!  The sign outside is misleading and makes people think you have it on all days.  One day I was enjoying a snack inside and heard about 5 people ask about it.  It must happen often!  Also, please offer sandwiches on the gluten free bread to!  :)"}
{"text":"I'll never forget how I felt after the first time trying this place. I actually bought a loaf of bread among other things, and after eating it could not recall a time where I had bread so fresh. I then moved on to the scones, which I believe are actually made by God. They have a weekly schedule that gets posted online and in the store, but I usually don't bother because I've never had anything that tasted bad there. My favorite scones are the pumpkin, white chocolate raspberry, apple, and I believe they've done a cinnamon. They also occasionally do various kinds of pastry bars and cookies that are really good. I've been here for breakfast and had a tasty bacon, egg and cheese sandwich, with complimentary coffee. To make things even better, they also have a rewards program. Stop by this location or the location in midtown, pick up a dozen scones, and be an office hero."}
{"text":"Went on a Friday for lunch and had one of the most incredible sandwiches. The food was fresh and the cookies delicious. The staff was genuine and attentive to everyone in the resturant. The place was packed however everyone was given the attention they deserved. A hidden gem! My favorite little bread shop."}
{"text":"Bread! Yummy, delicious, real bread! Loving my carbs, I'm a fan of anything bread! I discovered this company through the Roadrunner Park Farmer's Market on Saturday mornings. My fave is the honey wheat bread, which has 5 ingredients- wheat flour, water, honey, salt, and yeast. It's delicious, and well worth the $6. I've tried other things as well, such as the pumpkin spice cake bread, which is amazing, the holiday \"stuffing\" bread which is awesome for turkey and cranberry sandwiches, and the Virginia herb rolls, which go great with meatloaf. This vendor is one of my regular stops at the market, and I've always had great service from Leslie and Esther. Getting into healthier eating I thought I would have to give up bread, but no! This company makes real food using simple and classic ingredients. I have not been to the store yet, but I do want to go there when I am in the area."}
{"text":"Good sandwiches! The only thing I feel is its a little expensive than what it's worth! The food is undoubtedly good."}
{"text":"When you walk in you are treated with samples. Today they had a blueberry cheesecake swirl bread, absolutely awesome. for my meal I had the steak and cheese special on jalapeno cheddar bread. The sandwich was good, the service was unbeatable, I'll be a new regular."}
{"text":"Got a loaf of Cinnamon Chip bread from here which is great toasted. Saving the rest for the weekend and planning to make french toast with it. Can't wait to try their sandwiches!"}
{"text":"I've sung the praises of the Great Harvest in Portland, Oregon for years.  I have finally been to this Phoenix location, and it blows the Portland location out of the water!!  There is a huge selection of cookie mixes, jams, jellies, kitchen tools, breads, and other amazing looking and smelling items to purchase.  They even have wrapped gift baskets for easy, spur of the moment gift giving.  My hubby got a little sample happy at the bread sampling center because he wanted to taste it all!  We ended up taking home some jalapeno cheddar hamburger buns that added a ton of flavor to the burgers we made the next day.  We tried two different toasted sandwiches and were pleased with both of them.  The inside is a little cramped, so taking away your sandwiches would be a good idea, unless the weather is nice outside.  There are plenty of tables to enjoy the food and the weather on the patio."}
{"text":"This place is great for a fresh sandwich or sweet treat. They make fresh bread everyday, with a decent variety. You may sample the breads and treats before you buy. I think they even have small cups of coffee for free. My favorite bread is the Popeye and I like the fruit bars and fresh cookies.   They also sell jams, apple butters and other locally made products. Give them a try for lunch or just to feed your sweet tooth before you go shop at trader joes which is right next door."}
{"text":"A great Bakery that's close to home!  I went in with my husband and we both received a fresh slice of bread. Mine was sourdough, and it was delicious with a dab of butter. The lady at the counter was very friendly and helpful, and gave us some literature on the company, which includes the fact that they grind their flour fresh. We ended up getting a scone and a cinnamon roll, both of which were delicious. Next time we go we'll most likely be getting a sandwich and a loaf of bread to take home."}
{"text":"It's been a few months since I had lunch at this place, but from what I remember it was really good, fresh food and the staff were super nice."}
{"text":"Gawdddd I love this place. First, the service is outstanding. They treat you like a true guest. Second, the food is fresh and delicious. I'm obsessed with the breakfast roll with meat and cheese and the turkey sandwhich with with melted cheese, red onion, tomato and special spread rocks my world. I love buying special goodies here too like avacado oil and soup starters. I am so grateful for delivery for my Netflix binge days when I need real sustenance and delicious treats."}
{"text":"I always drive by this place and decided to see what it's all about.  I wasn't hungry, so decided to buy a loaf of sourdough bread.  Granted it was a few days before Christmas, so I guess it was busier than usual.  There were less than 10 people when I came in, but I waited about 10 minutes to pay for my bread.  Maybe I was a little impatient, but if I waited any longer I would've walked out of that place.  In my opinion, the workers were really slow.  I've worked in retail and you never want your customers waiting too long to pay, especially if it's bread!  I'm mean, don't they want my money?    On a positive note, the sourdough bread was really good and would probably continue buying my bread there.  Hopefully their cashiers become more efficient."}
{"text":"Good place for breakfast.  Will be back. Had the huevos rancheros. Very good but a little on the cool side( temperature)."}
{"text":"AMAZING! I walked in this past Friday to preorder bread bowls for my lunch guests on Saturday. Since I was already there, I ordered the chicken salad on honey wheat. When I picked the bread up Saturday morning they were still nice and warm, talk about oven fresh! I was tempted to order another lunch sandwich on Saturday, but decided against it since I was hosting lunch at my home within hours.  My guests thoroughly enjoyed soup in the bread bowls. I can't wait to have more lunch guests; I will definitely order bread there from now on."}
{"text":"This was my fist time. I was immediately greeted and asked if I wanted to sample something from their bread bar. I sampled a flax seed bread that was amazing and a lemon blueberry cake (that I ended up buying) she told me about the company, bread and sandwiches and fast too. Everyone in the restaurant was so friendly. My wait was about 5 mins total I believe. They brought my food to me calling me by name  and said thank you and goodbye. I ordered the \"little italy\" and my husband got the grilled cheese. My sandwhich was amazing!! Although they did forget my cucumbers on my sandwich. The grill cheese probably would have been better if he ate it there instead of to go. Definitely going back and leaving a tip. 5 stars because I didn't want to take a whole star away for my cucumbers but....?i really did want those. Try this place out"}
{"text":"Well, I am trying to stay away from carbs but it's so hard when this place is so amazing. The breads are so delicious. My favorite is this Italian pizza kind of bread. It's amazing. The muffins are so delicious too. I think I just gained a few lbs  just by this review!   Seriously though the place is outstanding and all of the employees are nice and friendly as well!"}
{"text":"Wow! That's how I'll start this review. First we were met and greeted by a very very nice young man who graciously shared all of the must knows! We were first timers and curious as to the rave reviews and decided to try it out.  I tried the whole wheat honey bread and it immediately brought me back to my grandmothers homemade bread; with butter and just yummy! My boyfriend had the chicken berry which was delish!   We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great bread & great sandwiches. They are fresh and don't keep as long as store bought breads so be sure to freeze anything you won't be using within a week of purchase. Also, they'll slice most loaves if you ask!"}
{"text":"What really sets Great Harvest apart for me is the sandwiches. It's so nice to have a reliable sandwich spot that uses great bread and fresh ingredients and allows full customization of the order. It's such a dependable lunch spot that I've printed out a copy of my usual sandwich orders and leave it in the office so I don't have to fill one out every time I go (saves paper, too!).  Add in the quality of their breads and this is an easy 5*. The pumpkin bread here truly is delectable."}
{"text":"Such a yummy place for bread.  I normally just don't go somewhere to just get bread but the bread here is so good and unique.  They have a really good chocolate cherry bread.  If it's not made yet, you can order it.  There is some seating inside for lunch too."}
{"text":"I have been here several times for lunch.  They have 3 or 4 salads on the menu and probably 8 or so hot and cold sandwiches and a build your own option.  It is mostly a take out place, although they have a few tables inside and more outside.  I have never not found a table during lunch in one place or the other.    Everything is freshly made with quality ingredients.  I especially like the chicken nut salad which features several nuts and dried fruit in the mix.    Great Harvest is really more a bakery than a café. I have not bought the breads and other baked goods to take home but they sure look good.  The bread is great on the sandwiches so on my next stop I play to buy a loaf.  They also have other packaged and prepared things to go including artisan food products (jams, soup fixings, biscotti, etc.) and other items for sale.  Since I am really there for lunch I am going with 3 stars because of the limited menu.  If you are a bakery customer you might rate it higher."}
{"text":"I stopped in Great Harvest Bread Co for lunch for the first time today. It was AMAZING. The bread was so fresh and the lady at the counter could not have been any nicer. The Smoked Turkey sandwich was perfect, I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"You know when sometimes you get tired of all the fancy or intricate food options in Madison and just want a simple, but great, sandwich? Well look no further than this place. Great bread, great sandwiches, low key vibe. I had the Baja turkey and it was fantastic. Incredible bread, great flavor with just enough kick.   They also give you free bread samples when you come in, which definitely doesn't hurt. Of all the lunch options on university ave, this is one of the better ones. I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"We've been here a few times but it's just been an average experience. If you're waiting in store it seems like it takes a long time to make your sandwich. To fix that I've called ahead for pick up a couple of times.   Their bread is really good but their selection of veggie sandwiches is just ok. More than once I asked for avocado on my sandwich and they forgot it. Both times I didn't notice until I got home so what could I do? I suggest you check your order before you leave the store or just get a loaf of bread and make your own sandwich."}
{"text":"They give you hugeee sample slices.   But they are slow and expensive and not very tasty. The bread is great. The insides, average.  You would save yourself a lot of money and time if you just bought a loaf and made your own sandwiches. Because I think their deli meats are like...just regular cold cuts from Smith's. And if you get the breakfast sandwiches here, the eggs are always SUPER well done."}
{"text":"One of my friends raved about this place so I had to try it out.  I got a loaf of American Rye.  Now, on the one hand, this place does supposedly keep its bread recipes simple without all sorts of additive junk, and they supposedly grind their own wheat right there.  So that's a plus.  The bread I bought tasted really fresh, and had a strong caraway flavor which I like in my rye.  But on the other hand, the crust was limp and soft like grocery store bread-in-a-bag.  It's not bread geek bread.  It doesn't have any chew to it other than what you'd get by toasting it.  I guess it depends what you want in a bread.  This bread rates way above the grocery store, but way below what you'd get at Sunflour or Nova's."}
{"text":"For home-made carby goodness this is your one stop shop.  Besides a small and rotating selections of freshly baked breads, this shop also offers a number of sweet treats and other baked goods, all of which deserve a try.  They also offer lunch sandwiches, made with their bread and your choice of meat and/or veggies.    For me, this is usually a breakfast time stop, especially on Saturdays.  They make some of the biggest cinnamon rolls I have ever seen- in both a low fat and a fully-leaded version.  If you're not feeling so sweet, their scuffins (that's a mix between a muffin and a scone) are a solid choice.  Add in a cup of their fresh-brewed counter culture coffee and you're all set to start the day in the right way.  Do check their web site or stop in and pick up a monthly calendar to see what their baking for that month.  Speciality breads change monthly, but there are standards that remain- such as Friday's cinnamon chip and their honey wheat loaves.  On certain days they also do gluten free breads, for those who need it.    Be aware that on some baking days breads may not be available until about noon  You can always stop in and place your order early to make sure you have it waiting for you.  You can call in your order too.  Price wise, you'll pay a little more than your average supermarket, but then I think you are getting a better product that you know was made locally and fresh.  Their speciality breads are also things you won't find at the average market (cherry and white chocolate chip anyone?).    I also love that the owners are big supporters of the local running scene.  If you have done any local 5K or greater, chances are better than not these guys are at the finish line offering you a fresh slice off one of their loaves.  That they invest in a healthy community just makes me love then a little more."}
{"text":"this sandwich place is super good!! it is a little bit more expensive than subway but its worth the money. I'm never disappointed when i go here! and the service is good too!"}
{"text":"I visit this bakery about once a week to buy bread for my family. The staff is friendly and the baked goods are amazing! I don't ever buy bread at the grocery store because GH makes fresh products with minimal ingredients. Our favorites are cinnamon challenge, honey whole wheat and pepperoni swirl. The mint chocolate brownie is to die for!"}
{"text":"Great service and food! I've had the little Italy, roast beef chimichurri, sourdough, and seafood bisque. The Little Italy is my favorite and I think the roast beef would be better on a different bread for my own taste."}
{"text":"Great healthy bakery with gluten free options! I love this place. Every time I'm in Tempe, I make a point to grab some cookies and bread from Great Harvest. Plus the sandwiches are fantastic, too. try the chicken salad."}
{"text":"BREAD, real bread to that is healthy and tastes better. I also had their BBQ sandwich and it was perfect. The ladies working were really nice and I felt like I was home. I don't like supermarkets so I've been looking for a good bakery, and I will be back."}
{"text":"I use to love this place BUT THE QUALITY IS NOT CONSISTENT!!! I always order a chef salad and each time the portion size gets smaller and smaller. The last couple of times, I have called and they have corrected but enough is enough.  My salad today was pretty much empty and I am a small girl and I had about 4 bites and the salad was GONE.  It was a waste of my time, money and energy for the parking.  Don't waste your time"}
{"text":"I love it here.  Great sandwiches, friendly faces, and a clean shop.  I love the Chicken Salad sandwich.  Ian makes them the best though.  Some of the other employees don't get the chicken salad all the way to the corners."}
{"text":"After a great workout with the girls it was time to replenish and decided to try something new that is close to the house. Pulled out my handy yelp app and this sounded sensible about a great workout and run. I discovered that they are a full bakery and sell all sorts of yummy treat too.  The inside of the store is very welcoming and so pleasant. The music is so upbeat and they adjust if it is not to the employees liking. This is a great moral booster. I need music and feel the rest of the humans on the planet do too. It's great that the employees here are able to pick and choose the music they want to listen too, within societal standards of course. Some music is best left to the buds.  I ordered the walnut muffin and you better believe that they made it here. Plus with my yelp check in I was able to pick a huge cookie all for free. Thanks Yelp and Great Harvest your awesome and so are your sugar Vegas Strong cookies. They were also selling cookies decorated with Go Knights go too! Love that they support our amazing hockey team. The staff here is witty and so friendly I found my new bread company. Yeah!"}
{"text":"This place has terrible customer service. I use to enjoy picking up lunch from here, but half of the time they got my order wrong. So I stopped coming, which was saddening because when they get it right it's good.   For some reason we started coming here again, on the weekends when we were in the area. I forgot the frustrations I experienced previously. They never just refund you, you have to come all the way back for them to remake and they still don't refund just for the inconvenience. I didn't even bother to ask for my money back this time I just wanted them to make it right because we hadn't ate yet.    I wouldn't bother with their food, just get the loaves or desserts for in and out service. The bread is good and they have a variety.  However I am beyond frustrated with this place for their lack of attention to detail on a consistent basis. I'm usually very forgiving, but there's been more times I can remember issues than having a good experience, it's just a sandwich if you can't get that right consistently then don't make them."}
{"text":"I don't understand the hype surrounding Great Harvest. Their breads are dense,  undercooked, and have a doughy inside. I make better bread at home and for a fraction of the cost.  For $6 a loaf, I expect this bread to knock my socks off. It doesn't."}
{"text":"Thank goodness Great Harvest is in Charlotte. The quality of their bread is first class. Forget the grocery stores, make a special visit to Great Harvest. As a plus, they believe in corporate philanthropy."}
{"text":"Wheat flour milled onsite each morning. Lots of whole grain varieties. The best, BEST, pumpkin chocolate chip muffins EVER. Seriously. Why are you still reading this? Go get a muffin!!!"}
{"text":"Cute little place, sandwiches are tasty and fresh, and they offer gluten-free options too.   Now for some constructive criticism. Like so many in the food business these days, Great Harvest sells mostly the illusion of health and wholesome-ness than the actual reality. Few or none of their ingredients are organic. There is nothing that says that the meat and eggs they use are at least free-range, which suggests that they're from CAFOS.   It's nice that the conventional ingredients they use are freshly prepared and sourced from family farms, and no chemicals are added, but unless those family farmers are organic, all that wholesome, fresh food is still going to contain glyphosate and other dangerous chemicals.  Dear Great Harvest: please show that you mean it and go organic. It's the only way your food can be as good as your marketing."}
{"text":"I love yelp!  When I'm bored I come here for suggestions and I've never been stirred wrong.  This place has amazing bread and sandwiches, plus excellent service!"}
{"text":"Have you ever had a piece of fresh soft chewy bread with soft whipped butter slathered all over it for free? If the answer is no then take a drive to a Great Harvest Bread Company and turn your No into a Yes. Your free sample is not even tiny, it's a good sized thick piece. So if you haven't visited this place before please do, get your free sample and I guarantee that you'll leave with a loaf of bread or a goodie. It's hard to resist!!!  Even though the bread here is pricier than the bread at a grocery store, the extra few bucks is so worth it. They have really good lemon bars but it is only made on Mondays and Wednesdays. They make different breads and goodies on different days and their schedule is posted in the store and online (I think-if not should be). The red,white and blue bread is yummy if you like blueberries and cranberries. I like the cheese bread, sweet orange rolls, chocolate cherry pound cake and they have gigantic cookies but I'd rather get a lemon bar. They also sell a variety of sandwiches and on Easter they sold bread that looked just like Bunnies with eyes and everything-too cute. One star off for being closed on Sundays....."}
{"text":"Potato Cheese Bread is the shining star here..... So soft and so yummy and so worth the over $6.00 bucks that it costs!!! The Gingerbread cookie is yummy and I don't even like gingerbread - All the cookies are huge and soft..... The cinnaburst bread is perfect with a slab of butter. The Marzuka bars (granola N raspberries) are yummy but may need to be cooked just a little bit longer. Their other bar is called a Kahuna Bar and it's made just like the Marzuka bar but instead of raspberries they put chocolate chips,caramel and coconut. I don't care for coconut but it's a yummy bar!!! My disappointment is with the Smores Bread -  Dosen't Marshmallows,chocolate and graham crackers all mixed into a bread sound just sound delicious ? Well it did to me but man it didn't taste good to me or anyone at work. The concensus is that it tasted like wheat bread with mini chocolate chips in it. The lady also told me that she couldn't put this bread into the bread slicer because of all the marshmallows - boy that got me excited. Well, no one spotted or even tasted a marshmallow. FYI-They will hand cut this bread for you if you want. I love fresh bread and I'm happy that there is a place close to work that I can buy fresh bread from and just from Walmart or Vons. Great Harvest is not cheap but sure is tasty. Don't forget that they have a bread slicer  and a frequent buyer card.  Just yesterday they had for sale green colored bread made to look like fingers with red nail polish and orange colored bread that looked just like a large spider - Very cute.....  Because certain things aren't there everyday you can special order what you like and pick it up the next day. I only wanted 2 pieces of their Kahuna Bars and they said sure so you don't need to order dozens of something to do a special order."}
{"text":"If fresh, yummy bread is what you're looking for, then this is the place. Each day there's a new flavor or two in conjunction with their usual standards of Country white, whole wheat, sourdough, etc.  they have excellent cinnamon rolls that are huge, enough for 2-3 people to share. They also make great sandwiches and soups. There are tables should you want to have lunch with a friend.  The place is clean, staff is friendly, offers free samples of different breads, and prices are moderate. The better quality of food, I'm willing to pay a little more."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Employees were friendly. A lot of interesting bread types to try daily and they gave you a huge slice to sample. I had the breakfast panini and it was great. Could have used some Tobasco! Didn't get to try any of the sweets but they looked delicious."}
{"text":"Love their food! They always have good customer service and samples. I had a sandwich for lunch here one day with apples on it and it was amazing."}
{"text":"Good bread. We like the honey wheat. Fruit bars too sweet for me. Just tried chocolate chip cookie mix. Wayyyyyy too sweet."}
{"text":"I spend my time and my money driving to your store to buy food from your store and you don't have turkey and you don't have the bread that goes with the little Italy sandwich so then I have to get a refund while watching your employee sneeze all over the food line.  I used to come here all the time now I'll think twice... I don't want to hear excuses about why you're always out of cheddar bread or you're always out of turkey every time I go to get a sandwich you guys do not have the cheddar bread every time for the past three times i've been..  it's unacceptable.   I'll give you two stars because I used to like this place.  -----------  Update:  Just got some Italy's with cheddar bread no problem.  Coffee coconut bread is delicious. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"So I stopped in for a quick pre-workout snack.  I ordered a breakfast panini on high five fiber bread...and while the panini was quite tasty and the bread was great...I ran into two...yes two different colored hairs cooked in to the egg whites.  Why does this always happen to me?  The first hair specimen is definitely from a small white dog.  The second hair appears to be of human origin.  Someone hit me back when they get their quality control issues fixed...cause I won't be back until then...if ever."}
{"text":"This is an ok place, but seems to be a bakery first, sandwich shop second. The staff were very friendly and attentive even though I came close to closing, there was no awkwardness at all. Overall, it was a forgettable sandwich that felt basic and overpriced."}
{"text":"This place works hard to maintain their product and establishment. A few things can be tweaked but in all, it's good. I enjoyed a tuna sandwich that I had them turn into a melt. The sandwich came on wheat bread and that was good but cut a bit too thin. The amount of tuna salad is bountiful but it lacks flavor. It tastes like tuna and nothing else, not enough mayo, seasonings, or onion/celery. The sandwich also comes LTO but the lettuce is shaved iceberg. There are only a few sandwiches that should have shredded iceberg and this isn't one of them. Moreover, as a hot melt, the lettuce shouldn't have been on there at all. The sandwich was very unimpressive. The snickersoodle cookie to make it a meal was overlooked, dry, and too sweet; it was however very large.To add, the prices are a bit steep for the quality. The total for my sandwich to be made into a melt and then added with drink and cookie as a combo was over $12. Loaves of bread are anywhere from $6-9 which is way too high. I will say that the women are wonderful that work there and their business is strong."}
{"text":"This place is so cool!  Where else can you taste yummy home baked bread?  Their sandwiches are delicious too!"}
{"text":"The Italian sandwich here is great when I was in Madison - hopefully this place opens back up somewhere."}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't reviewed this place before.  I stop here at least once a week to get my carb on.  I absolutely love this place, and let me tell you why.  I first discovered their delectable bread at the farmer's market a few months ago.  I'm forever on a quest for a good bakery.  The had samples of everything they offered that day, so I got to try a few different things.  That first day, I purchase their spinach and feta bread (like a savory, moist challah bread - so good!!).  The texture was perfect, and the eggs made it such a moist bread.  I also tried their blondies that day.  For two dollars a piece, you get a 3x3x1 (or slightly bigger, depending) bar cookie.  It was so buttery and fantastic!  Since then, I've tried many different styles of their bread and desserts.  Their garlic cheddar bread is divine, and they have some of the best whole grain breads I've ever tasted.  If you like a nuttier bread, their Dakota is chocked full of pepitas and sunflower seeds.  Even their low carb whole grain bread is fantastic, and it doesn't taste like the light bread you buy in the store.  Best of all, they don't use any preservatives in their bread.  They use freshly milled grains (ground within 24 hours), which apparently retains some of the natural protein found in the grain.  They also sell all of their goods within 48 hours and donate unsold bread to charity.  Their ingredient list and nutrition information is readily available on their website, along with a schedule of days when certain bread is produced.  The rotate their menu every month, although they do have some bread they offer every day.  The staff has always been patient, friendly, and helpful in answering questions.  When you go to their bakery location, you can try anything they have out that day as well, including desserts, cookies, and \"scuffins\" (a cross between a scone and a muffin).  They also offer sandwiches, homemade jelly, and coffee, but I've not tried any of them.  For the holidays, you can purchase pies or their \"jewel bread,\" which is basically a super delicious fruit cake.  Their prices on bread are about $4.50 to $6.50, which seems a little steep until I think about all the bread I end up wasting when I purchase store-bought loaves.  It's a rare occasion that the bread I buy here doesn't get eaten.    If you're looking for healthy, fresh bread, this is definitely the place to go."}
{"text":"Pretty good for a quick sandwich. Very fresh and unique bread flavors. They also have other goodies to shop for while you wait. They were also very pleasant!"}
{"text":"Incredible food. Amazing service. Informative employees who genuinely care and know what they're doing. Do yourself a favor and fill up on all this goodness"}
{"text":"Free slice of bread while you are deciding what you want to eat or buy. Awesome. I did see a couple of random kids run in just to get the free slice and leave. But it is their policy.   I had the Roast Beef Blue sandwich. I loved the blue cheese spread that they used on the sandwich, it really complemented the roast beef.   The staff was super friendly and helpful. The counter gal almost forgot to ring me up for my sandwich and when I told her that I hadn't paid, she was very thankful for me being honest. Karma baby, it comes back in the end if you are honest."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! They give you generous size samples of whatever breads they have fresh that day & they are delicious. I had the banana pumpkin bread & a blondie! They were both great!   I have never had a sandwich from here. I just grab some bread or goodies to go but I would assume they are really good!"}
{"text":"I felt really positive upon glancing at the GF options.  Heck, even having GF bread options, cookies or cinnamon rolls in the fridge was quite a surprise. So I decided we might as well give them a try cuz they certainly had stepped beyond all of the other places yelp reviewers had said were GF.  So we order our breakfast to go, I grabbed a snickerdoodle for myself, and off we went for our beverages and other errands. When my son said the egg was just egg white I was surprised.  Obviously that didn't catch my eye on the board.  Why don't they include that.  My GF bread was $1 more -not a huge surprise, but I didn't see that on the menu board either. My sandwich was egg (white), cheese and veggie with a cream cheese spread.  I saw no sign of cream cheese spread and the young man wasn't able to tell me exactly what veggies, and how there were prepared, are on that sandwich.  He did go on to ask what kind of bread I wanted my sandwich on so I reminded him he told me there's only one GF option. So I'm now eatting my breakfast sandwich which is on bread so thin it adhered to the paper it was wrapped in.  That slice may have been 3 times thicker than the provolone slice and just a tad thicker than the egg white product they use. Now I know I've eaten at Great Harvest in the Midwest and it was good.  Of course I didn't have restrictions then.  Today they're serving a more compicated.  My taste hasn't changed and sadly the gluten free options fall below my hopes.  This place does have more options AND they handle it properly.  This from a novice perspective. Breakfast today was -Okay. Heck, 100 times better than what I had at another popular bread type restaurant just up the road.  I mean they don't even have a GF option. I will say the shop is cute, service is polite and regular menu items look good and prices are competitive.  Because my bread was so thin it stuck to paper wrap, no mention of egg white on menu board and missing that cream cheese spread on my egg white sandwich, they get 2 instead of three stars.   Seriously,  it shouldn't be called egg if it's not a whole egg.  I've got hens, the only time they kick out just an egg white is when there's a glitch in the system and they produce tiny, witch eggs.   Back in the day they probably hung or burned those hens at the stake for such things.   Fix that menu board."}
{"text":"My kids and I just tried this place. It's AMAZING!  Best. Sandwiches. Ever. We'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Their sandwiches are very good. Super fresh tasting. Their fresh baked breads are soft and delightful as well. A good variety of breads to choose from and some baked treats to pick from too. Cute little shop and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Some of the very best cinnamon pull apart bread everrrrr. I've had other breads as well which are all pretty good. But that cinnamon pull apart..... OMERGERRD"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing!!! I work nearby, and I try to get there before closing. On my days off, I come to get a sandwich and cookie!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had a very tasty lunch. She had the California Cobb sandwich on Cheddar Garlic Jalapeno bread. It was real turkey not cold cuts. I had the Smoky BBQ cheddar chicken on grilled sourdough bread. The chicken was roasted (one again not cold cuts).Both sandwiches were very fresh, healthy portions and great tasting. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I can't believe I didn't try this place sooner! Staff is friendly and the food is delicious. I absolutely love the turkey pesto sandwich and the triple chocolate scones are amazing!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love the breads and sweets from here! I bought some cinnamon rolls and chocolate chip scones today. I went early evening so they didn't have any pull apart cinnamon rolls by then (so sad!!) The lady I dealt with today was very nice. I just feel bad that I didn't get her name! Will definitely be making my weekly pilgrimage next week"}
{"text":"We've tried a couple of things here. Spinach feta bread is amazing and some kind of maple iced scone is also good. Loved everything I've tried here, will definitely be back to try a sandwich during lunch. Ladies working were quite friendly and they have samples up front to try before buying. I recommend stopping in."}
{"text":"I have been here three times and while the service is friendly, every single time the air has been thick with a burning smoke smell. Is this normal? I try to come in at off times, because once I came at lunch and there were no available tables so I had to get my order to go and do a desk lunch. I will come back though, the bread is tasty business. Baja Chipotle Turkey is a must try."}
{"text":"In addition to their great breads, they have awesome cookies... I HIGHLY recommend you buy a batch of their chocolate chip cookie mix. It's RIDICULOUSLY easy to make... soft butter, 1 egg and 2 Tbsp water in a mixer... the cookies taste scratch made (they practically are since there's nothing artificial in the mix). My ONLY complaint is the instructions say 12-16 minutes to bake... they need a legitimate 20 minutes in the oven at 325 degrees (which is the temp the instructions said to bake at).  If you have kids and you need to bring snack for sports or school for any reason... get that bag of cookie mix!!"}
{"text":"Can you please post on yelp your summer hours? I drove across town only to see the summer hours posted on the door and closed. Disappointing."}
{"text":"Hi all.   I am here to edit my review. After writing this I got an email from the owner and well turns out there was a lot of miscommunication with the staff and myself. Seems the staff that day didn't I understand the policy. Well after speaking with the owner Maria I will be giving it another chance and sticking with what I know I like  I am giving three stars thanks to Maria for making things better and communicating with me.     So I went there today with a friend to ha w a great lunch. It had always been good. Well today I went with the recommendation of the cashier and got the meatball sub. I get my sandwich take a bite of a meatball and spit it back out. It was totally disgusting. It tasted like freezer burned meatballs with a touch of wet dog. I take it back to the cashier and ask if I can get another sandwich because I didn't like the meatball. She starts to make a different one and then says she needs to call someone and ask. Then tells me that to get a new sandwich I'd have to buy a new one because they can't afford to remake. So basically if you hate your food or they mess up you have to pay for another sandwich. I then say I would just take a refund minus the drink. So they can afford to give me a refund and lose my business but can't afford to make a customer happy. I will no longer be going there for food or even the bread I love so much. I will now go to Kneaders for my bread cravings. You can afford a bad review it seems as well. You have lost two customers"}
{"text":"My family has been buying bread here for years, and we've never been disappointed with the selection or quality available of homemade-style baked good. I'm a huge fan of the honey white bread, it's probably the best white bread I've ever had. They also do really awesome sandwiches if you need hardier fare. The spicy bacon apple grilled cheese is amazing, it's just the right blend of spicy, sweet, and savory."}
{"text":"We were walking by this place, looking for some place to eat, considering just settling for Cici's Pizza. As we stopped in front of this location, the woman waved us in encouragingly. It was 6:30pm on a Thursday and probably getting ready to close. When we were still waiting outside debating on what to eat, the son came out to let us know that they have some free samples and tasty bread. We like tasty free things, so in we went.   SO was given a very generous slice of pumpkin bread to try and I was given a lemon and rasberry slice. Soooo delicious! We bought a loaf of the pumpkin. Unfortunately, they were out of the lemon raspberry, but the woman working was so kind to give me half of their tester block since it was close to closing time and it was all that was left.   Absolutely lovely place and encourage you all to visit."}
{"text":"I have stopped in a few times for a sandwich and taken a loaf or two to go.  The bread can seem expensive but once you pick up the loaf and realize it is 3x heavier than the typical stuff you buy, you realize you are getting a great bread for a decent price.  The cinnamon swirl bread is awesome.  They sell out fast since they only make it once a week.  I enjoyed an entire load of the honey wheat bread by toasting it and spreading on some homemade honey butter (honey+butter=honey butter).    Very friendly staff, yummy iced-tea, tasty sandwiches, good bread and free samples.  Can't go wrong."}
{"text":"My sandwich was amazing. But customer service wasn't too great. The female cashier was complaining about her hours and another employee."}
{"text":"I love great harvest! They make one of my absolute favorite sandwiches. The staff is very friendly and you can't get better bread anywhere in town.   The deli meat on the sandwich is fresh as are all the produce and of course bread....  ( try the turkey on sourdough with pepper jack and fresh tomato lightly toasted....."}
{"text":"Never new about this location, but Groupon enlightened me  I usually go to the location off of Tropicana and Hualapai, it's quite a bit bigger.  I think this location is about half the size, selection a bit more limited.  No worries though, was able to get a couple loaves of lemon poppy seed cake, a banana chocolate chip cake, and a cinnamon chip loaf of bread.  Their breads are always great here, baked fresh daily!  This location is a bit small, so it looked like their selection was smaller.  Store was nicely set up given the space, and staff was great.  Now that I know they are here, will stop by whenever I go to the Costco in same parking lot or Winco foods across beltway."}
{"text":"8/13/13  Went for a walk intending to shop at Trader Joe's and to check out Curry 'n Cakes (previously Cakes 'N Flakes), when I noticed there was a Great Harvest Bread next door to TJ's!  (I've bought bread from a couple of franchises in AZ years ago.)  I dutifully checked in to Great Harvest and entered the store to see if there were any bread loaves and sweet treats I could buy after shopping at TJ's.  It was great to see smiles on both of the employees manning the front.  One of them asked if she could help me and readily obliged when I asked to see the book of ingredients so that I may know which non-allergenic varieties I could take home with me.  The space was small, but cheerful and inviting.  (There were even a few tables to accommodate dining patrons!)  This store will be on my regular rotation whenever I visit The Queen City."}
{"text":"Great breakfast sandwich. Offered us 2 saamples before we ordered. Badger bar was delicious. Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"Always offer samples and have many options for whatever your taste may be. Their bread pudding is better than the cinnamon buns in my opinion though"}
{"text":"Really enjoy me some Great Harvest. The free sample of bread that you get when you walk in the door is nice, but here's what happens to me every time I go there:  I walk in and go to the counter where they ask which type of bread I would like as my sample. I quickly make that decision and get my large slice of bread with butter on it, then proceed to order my sandwich (which will most likely have waaay too many toppings on it). While I wait for the sandwich, I eat the bread. A few minutes later, they bring out my sandwich, which is great. And it looks so good! There is one problem, though; I'm not that hungry anymore!   I literally do this every single time. I know, a little self-control would go a long way in my situation, but all of the bread is so good! Maybe there's something I haven't tried before. How could I pass that up? The sandwiches here are great, and I've thoroughly enjoyed every loaf of bread I've had bought from Great Harvest. The potato cheese is probably my favorite.   The one issue I have with this place - and another review has already mentioned this - is the smell. It doesn't smell like a bakery, a sandwich shop, or even a food place. I don't know what the smell is in there, but it doesn't smell like food. At all. It's a little off-putting, but the sandwiches here are great and more than make up for the olfactory confusion. I go here whenever I'm looking for a sandwich, and it's pretty close to my house, which is great!"}
{"text":"Have not been here for a while and they have new people working here so when I came in today, they guy behind the counter explained the process.  They have a menu you can select pre-made items from or you can build your own sandwich.  They also have salads and soups.  One thing the guy brought my attention to was a menu of what they bake and when they bake it.  Today being Friday the option is a cheddar cheese bread....I inquired about this bread to which he explained the 3 different loafs they make and then proceeds to tell me they don't have it because it has not been delivered???  Why explain an entire process and then say oh we don't have it today?  Also I ordered a sandwich that the menu CLEARLY says is grilled and when I got home my sandwich was not grilled...food preparation is not rocket science and I did not ask for anything to be done that was not on the menu yet it was still wrong."}
{"text":"I honestly could not tell you why some people review this place so poorly.... GREAT food, friendly service, cute decor, and a nice outdoor eating space. I get cravings for their chicken salad sandwiches once or twice a week! I hope more people stop to give this place a chance so it sticks around!"}
{"text":"My fiance and I recently just moved to this area of town and wanted to try something new for breakfast. This gem was top of the list. When I saw they made homemade breads they already had me sold - reminded me of home in the midwest and traveling through Minnesota.   From the moment you walked in, till the moment you walked out we had some of the nicest, most polite service.  The air was filled with smells of different breads.  They offered us about 10 samples to choose from.. ranging from different flavored breads to desserts.   We ordered both soups, potato bacon and vegetable - and both got a breakfast sandwich. While waiting we met a couple that made the overall experience the best. They visit Vegas once a year and come to this spot... 6 years in a row. We talked about how amazing all the food sounded on the menu and I was actually getting hungrier as I was eating!!!   Afterwards, we couldn't leave without get the desserts we sampled! Simply delicious.  We will be return customers and highly recommend this gem!"}
{"text":"My sandwich was missing a crucial ingredient and they made it right! It smells just heavenly when you walk in. The entire staff are friendly and will answer any questions you may have. The cookies are delicious. I've had some ladies from work bring in scuffins, Savannah bars and Hummingbird bread - its all delicious!"}
{"text":"LOOOOOOVE THIS PLACE!!! One of the best hole in the walls up in this area. The bread samples are always unbelievable and end up leaving with a random loaf ya had no idea you needed!   The grilled cheese with the garlic butter stuff is a killer easy sandwich which I con my son into getting so I can eat the best crust parts!   Huge fan of the BLT (extra mayo, add the garlic herb from the grilled cheese and extra toasted)   The turkey pesto is another good one.   Great concept. Always great food. And has turned into a go-to when we can't decide what we want as a family."}
{"text":"I just moved to the area and have tried this place 3 times now.  2 of the 3 times were just \"eh\" Today I got an egg and cheese panini breakfast sandwich. For all the homemade baked goods(and the time it took to make my sandwich- I was the only customer there), I would have expected to actually have a real cracked egg on my sandwich.  What I got was some type of microwaved dry tasteless egg patty.  Pretty disappointing. Skip the breakfast sandwiches and just get baked goods for breakfast."}
{"text":"It is official, I am in love with this lovely little spot for bread and a sandwich. I pick up a loaf for sandwiches or just a snack all on its own - gouda and guiness, screams fondue making to me!  The bread is what you will find at every Great Harvest, hearty and always tasty. The also do sandwiches, great coffee, tea and smoothies. The brownies and cookies are excellent and are also hearty in both taste and size. Enjoy this spot."}
{"text":"I decided to give this bakery another try for lunch. The space is huge but only a small portion of it is devoted to seating space which makes it feel a bit cramped if you are dining in. They do have outdoor shaded seating if you want more space though. I decided on the special for the day, the spicy turkey and pepperjack sandwich on focaccia bread, and had a bite of the roast beef with chimichurri sauce. The turkey sandwich was a hearty portion with tender turkey, a light punch of spicy heat from the cheese, peppers, and sauce in the sandwich and the romaine lettuce provided a nice temperature and textural difference. The bread had good flavor and was grilled to a delightful crispness. The roast beef was good too, and I liked the piquant chimichurri that went with it.   They have various bread and baked goodies for sale and I couldn't help taking home some mint pistachio biscotti for some treats to go with my coffee.   There is a soda fountain with Coke products. Our order only took a few minutes to be made and we had a lot of time before needing to head back to work after lunch.  Upgrade one star!"}
{"text":"The sandwiches are delicious an the bread is cooked to perfection. Clean faculty with a friendly staff. There isn't much traffic through there, but the food is delicious! I would recommend to all my friends."}
{"text":"I love all of the fresh bread. The fact that they give you free samples is a plus! They also have sandwiches and coffee. They do special breads per day of the week."}
{"text":"This is the only bakery near me in NW LV, so I was delighted by its opening in 2011. I drop in periodically just for my \"sample slice\" of the day. That is Lunch for me, and it's fabulous.  One day soon I'm splurging for lunch and guess where I'll be!  I've never experienced any of the negatives listed in other reviews, and encourage everyone to at least drop in and give it a try!"}
{"text":"I thought I had review for this place a long time ago. Obviously, I have not done my part to give this company a 5 stars. This is the place I will think about first, when I am hungry. They sandwich are fresh made in front of you. I alway ask them to toast my sandwich, so they taste even better than cold.   I also like to add 2 extra shots to my 32oz. super sized iced soy latte. It's the best combination. Looks like there will be a new Starbucks cross street, but the coffee at Great Harvest Bread is still my favorite choice."}
{"text":"Well I eat out often. Normally I love this place. Never been to this location. The person that rang us up wasn't very personable. When I go out I look at the entire experience so I can provide an accurate review. My credit card declined, even though I just used it across the street.Gotta love technology.  Once that happened I must say my experience went downhill. I provided another form of payment, it was accepted. The person walked away never said anything else as she saw me just standing there, as she went in the back. So I figured I will sit down and wait for the food at this point. Another person brought our food, I had to ask her if I can get my receipt as the other person just watched us and never gave it to me. Not happy with this. The food was fair. Now the bright point to this, the lady that brought our food very personable,  the taller guy awesome customer service. He gave me the takeout bags,  and was very courteous."}
{"text":"Run, don't walk, and sample and get yourself some of this amazing baked goods. Staff was helpful and freindly and the bread is just perfect. This will be added to our must shop at local businesses."}
{"text":"A community favorite, Great Harvest Bread provides fresh locally made carb goodness. The store has a country chic feel to it and the variety varies by day. There is a weekly board that lets you know what breads are made for each day of the week. For example, Challah bread is made on Fridays. Popular seasonal items like the pumpkin spice bread are sold by the mini loaf.   There is also a cutting board behind the counter where they let you sample some of the bread. Off to the left, there are honey sticks, jars of local honey, fruit jams and even stylish greeting cards if you decide to gift some of their goodies. They also offer some sandwiches, but I have yet to try them. Definitely would recommend the breads though."}
{"text":"How has Great Harvest escaped notice? It's a franchise, but....  This place feels like a casual, local spot, with a friendly counter staff. They ply you with bakery samples when you walk in the door. Try one of the unusual breads, like Guinness-cheese, or jalapeno-cheese. Slather your chunk with an appropriate amount of soft butter or preserves.  In addition to delicious breads, rolls, cookies, and other sweets, they make great sandwiches for lunch. They offer usual suspects, like turkey, ham, and roast beef. The chicken salad was a bit iffy, but the club is tasty. Great Harvest goes a bit heavy on the red onion on most, so take some breath mints for afters.  A box lunch comes with chips, a large drink, and a dessert from the pastry case. Try a Savannah Bar. They are delicious oaty crumble bars, rich with butter, sugar and fruit like blueberries, apples, cranberries, or peaches. Because they dish up your sweet right after you order, you generally get to finish your dessert before your lunch arrives.  My only complaint is that the place can feel a bit disorganized at times. But they usually aren't terribly busy, so even during the lunch rush you can generally grab a table and a quick lunch."}
{"text":"Delicious breads & cookies! I'm not usually an oatmeal cookie fan, but I prefer their oatmeal chocolate chip cookies over a plain chocolate chip (& oatmeal is good for you right?!). If you want to try something before you buy it - just ask! They freely give tastes without hesitation!"}
{"text":"I had plans to meet a friend here for breakfast and arrived a bit early so I went inside to take a look and grab a drink. It's a cute little restaurant, with a lot of local products in the front available for purchase and you can look into the kitchen to see all that they are baking. If you're looking for a big breakfast menu, you're not going to find it here. Besides the baked goods, they just have 4-5 breakfast sandwiches. I ended up just getting an iced chai and met my friend elsewhere, but when I am back on a bread kick I will stop by and give them a try."}
{"text":"The grilled little Italy was delicious and the lemon bar was amazing - the only thing to top it was the friendliness of the staff!"}
{"text":"This is the nicest store with wonderful bread and good people.  I was having a tough day; car would not start and I had lost my charge card so one guy was particularly generous.  Thank you."}
{"text":"I love all their breads! Especially the cinnamon chip bread. My kids love going in there to sample it every time we are in the area. If you love fresh bread, you must try it!"}
{"text":"Carbo looooooooooad!  It's oh-so-fun to carbo load at Great Harvest...a delicious little shop filled with the tastiest bread, sweets and cookies. I see that they also offer fresh sandwiches, but I have yet to nosh on one. All employees are very sweet & friendly and I *think* they still offer punch cards for frequent bread buyers!   Some of my favorite items from Great Harvest...  Rosemary garlic: ZOMG. I could eat this at any time of the day...the perfect amount of salt and carb. The bread is great as is and even a bit better toasted up. Trust me. Get some.   Dakota: Perfect, substantial sandwich bread with pumpkin seeds on top!  Cinnamon swirl: A lower cal option to a cinnamon roll. With butter, yes please.  Cookies: In general, I have not come across a cookie I haven't loved here.   Check out their website for different bread bake days and make sure to score yourself some carby deliciousness. Nom."}
{"text":"The extreme cinnamon swirl bread is DELICIOUS ! My husband brought it home after chaperoning a 3rd grade field trip to their impressive operation. I'm amazed that they grind their own flour. We learned that an acre of wheat will give a family bread for 10 years and are now considering making a mini crop of wheat at our home, since the little loaf my Daughter made there turned out delicious too :) I can't wait to get back there to see what other treats they have !!!"}
{"text":"Its always great when you walk into a place and you arw greeted w a warm hapoy welcoming smile! Then you are offerd samples of theie fresh daily breads. Many choices to choose from but all are so good! They have seasonal iteams also"}
{"text":"It's All Good! but the \"Dakota\" bread is our favorite! Get Some, get some today!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a quick mid-morning breakfast today, after reading another review that said they serve Kickapoo coffee.   Indeed they did, my current favorite Winter Solstice blend, and well brewed. Not fancily, but freshly made. I also grabbed their breakfast biscuit sandwich, which is a pretty great deal at $2.95. The biscuit is more of a scone, really, or what you would call a drop biscuit. It's made from whole grains, cheddar, and herbs, and is really tender and tasty. The egg inside was well seasoned with cracked black pepper, of which I am huge fan. They offer three cheese options and I went with pepper jack, and your choice of bacon or ham. I chose ham, which was the very light, super thin-sliced deli style. Overall the sandwich was very tasty and satisfying, but the ham and the biscuit were overly salty, and that's saying something, coming from me. They could stand to cut it back by about 30%.  Six bucks for a large, quality coffee (I had my own mug with me) and the sandwich was not too shabby. The place was empty, and they had some cheesy 70s disco music playing, but the staff was friendly and welcoming. They also have lots of prepackaged mixes for sale to make your own breads, soups, etc. and a large selection of jams and suchlike, just a bit on the pricey side."}
{"text":"We enjoyed a slice of the Spinach Feta while we were contemplating what to bring home and ended up buying a loaf it was so good!  Needs no butter, it tastes great just by itself.  Also bought a Sin-Amen loaf and it was awesome.  I love that it is made of whole wheat.    The cost of the bread is more than in a grocery store but it is good stuff and the loaves have a heft to them that leave you satisfied.  With all natural ingredients, friendly staff, a company policy that encourages service to the community, and a welcoming atmosphere, I say \"dive in\" to your favorite loaf and indulge while feeling good that you are eating fresh bread."}
{"text":"Love this place! I always get the Rueben grilled! They have a point system using your phone number and after a few sandwiches you earn enough to get a free loaf of bread! The quality of bread they bake in shop is amazing! Be sure to check the schedule tho because certain veranda EG: cinnamon burst are only made and available sat like....fri/sat. Which is amazing for French toast! I don't know the exact schedule but def worth a look!!!! They also have pastries they make you can pick up and they're cinnamon rolls and they're so good! Honestly given the chance you should def stop by!"}
{"text":"I'm in Madison for work and this has been my go to for lunch. Great sandwiches on their fresh bread. They might have the best chocolate chip cookies around"}
{"text":"The turkey pesto sandwich is my favorite sandwich here! However yesterday it seemed to be soggy on one side with vinegar. My boyfriend got a turkey cranberry sandwich and said it taste like thanksgiving. He always ends up liking the turkey pesto more though! Yummy place."}
{"text":"They have the most amazing bread I have ever tried in my life. Pumpkin chocolate chip is one of my favorites, it's SO delicious."}
{"text":"The best place I've found since moving to Arizona! Incredible food fantastic pastries and the bread is so good I cannot ever buy from the market again"}
{"text":"Look, I know you won't believe me but this place is the best in Tempe and maybe the East Valley. Their selection of custom breads is absolutely STELLAR! Cinnamon rolls are money, their gluten laden sweets would make even the most sensitive digestive system willing to roll the dice.  Oh yeah and their sandwiches are exactly what you want from a great bakery. The Italian is one of my top 10 AZ sandwiches. They actually pack all corners of the bread for your tuna fish, no empty bread only bites here (though here the bread is good enough to not complain)."}
{"text":"3 words:  cinnamon chip bread. You will not regret it. A fluffy loaf speckled with melted cinnamon chips. The perfect amount of sweetness. I eat it straight from the bag but it also works great for French toast. They came out with an extreme cinnamon chip bread that is very sweet and very cinnamony since there is a swirl of the filling they use for their cinnamon rolls.  If you are lucky, the bread has just come out of the oven and is still warm by the time it reaches your kitchen counter.   Of course, there is a large selection of other bread, along with sandwiches and various dessert items that you can sample at the counter. The girl working at the cashier was super friendly and bubbly, answering all my questions patiently."}
{"text":"Warning: once you get the cinnamon chip bread you won't be able to stop eating it."}
{"text":"If you aren't afraid of carbs then DEFINITELY check this place out!  I had some of the most delicious bread today I am soooo full it's disgusting! I walked into this small bread shop because the owner had given me a coupon earlier this morning so I went in for lunch.  He was very friendly and the staff seems to truly enjoy their job! So needless to say as I walked in they were joyful and cheery.    I walked up to the counter and they asked if I wanted to sample some of their bread - I first tried the potato cheese bread and almost died in heaven.  It was so soft and delicious, it didn't even need butter! I ordered my sandwich - I got a turkey on honey wheat grilled with lettuce, tomato, banana peppers and cucumber and it was wonderful.  After he gave me my sandwich he gave me another piece of bread to try - it was pumpkin. Wow... I don't have anything negative to say about this place. I've already recommended it to friends and family!   They also sell loaves of bread as well as homemade granola, flour, pancake mix, chocolate chip cookie mix, dog treats, etc etc etc... I can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"The bread here is always good. First time we had sandwiches here. The order taker seemed very disinterested in doing that task. For some reason half way thru our order she called another girl to take over??? Will continue to buy bread, don't know that I'll be back for lunch tho."}
{"text":"I've enjoyed Great Harvest in Cornelius a hand full of times... and I just love it.  I live in the small town of Cornelius.  On the semi-yuppy side of town where we like to have our cake and eat it too: a decent quick (ish) order restaurant, must have good food, walk-able, nice people, options to sit and chill, open all dang day long, friendly staff with a few tattoos and piercings that tell story... Yup, we're not picky here at all.  Did I mention the stuff has gotta be fresh?  I am usually the type of person that walks into any restaurant (esp, If I have been there a few times) and I know exactly what I want to order.  It isn't because I am not adventurous in my meal options... I just go there because of what I know is amazing on the menu.  Great Harvest has so many beautiful options that I often struggle to find what I want.  On the days that I eat meat, I eat the Spicy Apple Grilled Cheese.  Anytime food can make me feel like the man-child that I am but still look like a respectable adult while eating it, I am all for it.  You get to pick from whatever breads they bake that week.  They change daily so don't fall in love with just one.  However, they are all delicious.  My favorite is when they have the sun dried tomato bread available.  Being new to this whole plant-based diet thing, it is always amazing when a restaurant that I frequent already has decent options... not just an option but optionS! And thank you Great Harvest. The Veggie Three Seed Hummus Sandwich is my current food situation at this establishment. I love hummus.  It like like a crazy vegan's ranch IMHO... it goes on everything for me just about.  So a sammy dedicated to it?  Heck yes, wodie. With hummus, the texture is EVERYTHING to me.  And Great Harvest slays in all the right ways.  I had to be a little extra and slap  some avocado on it this time because it is 2018 and whats and you can't have enough avocados in your life.  From the outside, this is a hipsters dream come true as it is located in a beautiful old brick bungalow.  The inside has minimal seating but I don't usually stay and sit so this really isn't a concern for me.  It is walk-up order style and pretty quick for the most part... not subway quick but they do a great job for making sure your order is as fresh as it can be.  If it is traditional breakfast or lunch time, the line will be long... so plan for that and just accept the fact that it is part of the experience.  And enjoy."}
{"text":"Smells and samples Fill your mouth  Bad haiku. Good food. Great Harvest is the guilty pleasure of carb avoiding dieters. The bread is phenomenal. The sandwhiches good.  They brought me my coffee! This place is so delicious that I am purposefully limiting myself to twice a month. If I didnt i would go home with a giant loaf of cranberry orange bread. Every time."}
{"text":"??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Really yummy breads and sandwiches!  One of the nicest things about this particular Great Harvest is that they are happy to do special orders presuming you give them plenty of warning. My favorite bread of all is the RAISIN CHALLAH (moist and tender egg bread)! Usually they only make it in September but they are happy to accommodate. For almost a year they made it for me weekly - YUM!"}
{"text":"Great bread! Everything fresh.  I love this place.  Try their samples and you will see what I mean.   Love the service!"}
{"text":"Yo, they gave me a free sample of the cinna swirl bread. Bribery with food? My kind of people. Excellent food and service. They had elementary age kids in the back for a \"field trip\" baking bread, but I'm pretty sure they're using them for child labor. The kids' salty tears must be the secret ingredient."}
{"text":"Always freah and amazing. Such wonderful treats that hive that escape from a hetic day. From freshly made loves if speciality bread to sinfully delicious cookies."}
{"text":"I didn't get bread at a place with the word \"bread\" in the name, but got some bakery goods. The Kahuna is a blonde brownie with chocolate chips, butterscotch, coconut and  walnuts.   It's not too sweet or greasy and for $2.50 you get a large square. I will probably get that again.   The service was quick and friendly enough. Maybe I'll try the bread next time. They offer samples when you come in of the breads of the day which is awesome.   The downside is the selection is loaves of bread, and some cookies so not a full bakery. They do serve sandwiches so if you are in the area it could be a good one for a fast sammie lunch."}
{"text":"10 stars!!! Hannah was amazing, greeted us with a smile as soon we walked in and samples of fresh bread while we browsed the menu. We had just left SkinnyFATS after being treated super rude so this experience turned our moods right around!!! Food was delicious! Will be regulars for sure"}
{"text":"Great place to grab lunch.  I have been eating here regularly for 3 years.  My fave is the tomato bisque and turkey goddess on dakota bread.  Their fresh brewed tea is also really great too.  Nicest people you will ever meet as well!!!"}
{"text":"Yes, they bake bread fresh daily, but watch out-the bread you're buying at full price isn't always made that day!! After reading all the great reviews I thought I'd have to try this place. The slice of bread upon entering was great, & I got the free cookie using my Yelp app. (Haven't tried it yet.) BUT the loaf I purchased at full price wasn't fresh or tasty at all when I got home & tried it! I called & the girl answering the phone said it wasn't \"day old\". I asked for a manager who also said it was \"fresh\" but after a few more questions from me admitted the owner calls the bread \"fresh\" until the evening of the day AFTER it was baked (day two)! Only then is it taken off the shelf!? So I paid $6 for what I call day old bread that didn't taste anything like the sample they gave me at the store. The manager said several times \"We bake our bread fresh everyday\". Well, that's exactly what we want to buy-the bread that was baked that day!!!!! BTW, there was no date on the bread label.  She did say I'd get a free loaf when I next came in & told me I should always ask for bread baked that day. Really? I'll update this review after my next loaf."}
{"text":"I love the smell the fresh baked in bread!! It opens up my senses and more importantly it makes me feel good.  They make the fresh bread daily and have lots of varieties of breads ranging from the standard to sweet. Every month they also have different specialty breads that are made for that specific month. I feel the prices are reasonable for the quality of the food, it tastes remarkably better than those you get from a grocery store.  I come here for lunch every so often to eat the delicious sandwiches.  The perfect pastrami and The Jodi are my favorites. The staff are very nice people and provide great customer service.  I'll definitely be going back!!"}
{"text":"I came to Great Harvest for lunch the other day, and it was just OK. I think it's a nice alternative to Panera if you're in the area but not a place I would rush back to.  It was really nice to be greeted with samples of bread upon entering the place. They had 3 different breads to choose from, and the person working the register was kind enough to let me try 2 of them! They also keep butter and honey out to put on the bread samples. I tried the challah and the Dakota (a whole grain bread with grains and seeds in the crust). Both were pretty good.  I ordered the Baja Chipotle Turkey sandwich to go. The sandwich had a TON of turkey in it and a lot of pickled onions but not much else. Sadly, the avocado that's supposedly in the sandwich was nowhere to be found. The bread was not toasted, so it was not able to hold the contents of the sandwich without getting very soggy and almost falling apart. Overall, I was unhappy with my food, particularly since it cost me $8.75 and came with no sides.  I think if you're just looking for bread or a pastry, Great Harvest will probably do the trick in a pinch. They also serve Kickapoo coffee, so this could be a nice spot to grab a quick breakfast. However, I probably won't be back for lunch with so many other options not too far away."}
{"text":"Called on a Friday to hold 2loafs of bread they only have on Fridays/spent 30minutes driving to get them on Saturday... Only to find that they had either never held them... Or sold them.. I suspect it was the later cause the girl stated 'we had some this morning'.  Very Disappointing... Not the customer service you want from the 'local' bakery:( And read the review on day old bread... They don't discount day old bread or even late day purchases... It's Full price even a day later!"}
{"text":"Very good service. A welcoming atmosphere and friendly customer service. A good selection of sandwiches, breads, and salads. My tomato basil soup tastes fresh and was delicious. Good prices. I will be back."}
{"text":"We have been here twice and loved it! Bread is very good. The Little Italy and Turkey Pesto sandwiches were delicious. But most of all, the customer service was exceptional - warm and friendly!"}
{"text":"I have been in here a dozen times over the last couple of years. I usually stop in for a high priced sandwich that is worth every penny! The sandwiches are fresh and can be customized to order. The bread is fantastic, and usually end up buying a couple of loaves. The cinnamon chip seems to be my favorite, but is not made every day!"}
{"text":"The aroma of the fresh baking bread is mouth watering! The selection of bread was great. I got the breakfast bread roll that was baked with ham and cheese and a dash if rosemary. I will definitely be craving that for the next few days! I also got the drip coffee which was perfect. It was not bitter and not mouth scolding hot. I was able to drink it right away which was nice. My friend and I also split the cinnamon roll with frosting. We thought we would only have a bite each, but ended up eating the whole thing! My friend got the breakfast sandwich that was pressed on a panini press. It was tasty but there was more herb butter than she liked. They didn't tell her about the herb butter so if you get it, just a heads up that it is tasty but if you aren't a big fan to let them know to go light on it."}
{"text":"The parking lot is very tough to navigate because of Trader Joe's next door. Also, there are only a few tables (inside and out). It's not a restaurant. Those are the only real negatives.  The customer service is excellent, and the food is super fresh. The vegetables on my wife's veggie sandwich were incredibly fresh, even memorable. My BLT was solid. My son had a turkey sandwich, which was good, but they did put a lot of mayo on it even though we asked for a just a little mayo. So, you might want to stress that point if you eat here.   The most important factor here is that my wife gave her sandwich a 5 (of 5), which is extremely rare. It means the food is high quality.   Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"I'm torn in writing this review because I actually love the product. The issue I have is a persisting issue where they do not have sufficient quantities of Dakota bread ( available on M-W-F). As a consequence I've have 6-7 instances in the past two months where I arrive before 1pm and they are sold out of Dakota. They simple remedy would seem to bake more of that type - I've said as much at both the Horizon Ridge location and the Water street location ( where the baking is done) to no avail!! Get this squared away or you lose me as a customer."}
{"text":"A few months ago, I saw a video on Facebook about Great Harvest.  I was intrigued, and being the carb lover that I am, I decided to have a Yelp book club meeting here.   Great Harvest has a really amazing selection of breads, sandwiches, sweet treats, and drinks.  They have a daily bread selection, and also a different specialty bread for each day of the week.    When we came in on Saturday, we saw the beautiful bread tray, and were offered a sample of whatever we wanted.   We tried the lemon bar, the challah bread, the pumpkin bread, and the dakota.   Each different bread (and bar)  was mosit, delicious, and soft.  the dakota had a crunchy crust, and was a thick, dense bread that was absolutely delightful.    For our meals, we tried:  The Roast Beef chimichurri:  Roast beef, Swiss cheese, Chimichurri sauce, red onion, lettuce and tomato on Honey Whole Wheat Bread Clam Chowder, served with cheddar garlic loaf.  The sandwich was amazing.  My husband and I split it, and split a medium chowder, and that was definitely a filling meal.  The roast beef was delicious, there were plenty of toppings, and the honey whole wheat was soft, but didn't get soggy.  Loved the chimichurri too, it had just a tiny little kick to it that was wonderful.  The clam chowder was delicious.  Very flavorful.  Paired with the cheddar garlic bread, we were very happy,  let me tell you.  We ended up purchasing a loaf of the cheddar garlic bread.  It was too good to pass up, and for $7.95, there's a lot of bread there.  I want to make grilled cheeses out of it tonight!!  Also...the salted caramel cookie?  To die for.  Chewy.  Sweet.  Salty.  Perfection.  Can I talk about service?  So nice!  The young man and the lady that helped us were both super friendly and super nice.  My sandwich took a little time to come out, but I'm not mad.  The quality of the food, and the friendly service was more than enough to compensate for a little wait.  And it wasn't even that long of a wait anyway.    Great Harvest also sells apple butter, syrups, jams, and other goodies.    All in all, this was a great visit.   I'm going back tomorrow to try their Autumn apple loaf!!  I can't wait!!"}
{"text":"We tried stopping by this place on a Sunday afternoon. Although it was closed the owner and her family were \"hanging out\" so they invited us in to try some things gratis. While the bread itself truly does merit 5 stars, I'll keep this one to 4 right now until I've tried this place as a paying customer! It is a chain, but it seemed the family that owns/leases this particular location takes pride in what they do.   We had the pumpkin bread with chocolate chips and a loaf of the honey wheat. Both were to die for! The honey wheat has all natural ingredients including wheat they grind themselves. No HFCS - just the good stuff. The bread is high in fiber and very filling. I adored it. It was a bit pricey ($4 if I recall?) to justify buying on a regular basis, but it's definitely a nce splurge when you want special bread."}
{"text":"Love this place! The samples are fabulous! Nearly everything is exceptional on all products from bread to bars. Please move closer to campus!"}
{"text":"Fresh quality sandwiches with impeccable service - that's what Great Harvest is offering up. Specialty bread loaves of bread ranging from pumpkin chocolate chip to honey whole wheat are also available for purchase, priced at $5-8 each. Let's not forget the giant cookies and desserts either! I've ate here twice within a month and have not been disappointed thus far.  GRILLED CHEESE ($6.95): Comes with 3 types of cheese - you get to choose between cheddar, swiss, provolone, and pepper jack. Grilled on sourdough bread. Super cheesy and filling. 4/5  VEGAS VEGGIE ($6.95): Comes on honey wheat or cheddar bread, with sliced cucumbers, tomatoes, spinach leaves, purple onions, balsamic vinegar, and some kind of hummus spread. The only thing that's missing is cheese! Technically a vegan sandwich I guess but it was delightfully crisp, flavorful, and light. 4/5   LITTLE ITALY: ($7.95?): My husband inhales this sandwich. As he's demolishing it, he gasps in between breaths, this is SO good!!  CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIE: If you get a combo the meals comes with a drink and your choice of a cookie or chips. The cookie is huge but a little sweet for me. More cookie for the mister! 3/5 FUDGE BROWNIE?: This square chunk of fudge and caramel was an upgrade option to the combo for $1.50 more. It's a super heavy dessert item, but it was fun to try just once. 3/5  SERVICE: They greet every customer that walks in, and say bye as they exit. The staff are super nice. On our first visit, the manager gave us a complimentary coconut muffin because she said the wait was too long (it wasn't). There's a couple of loaves by the register - ask for a sample! They'll even add butter if you'd like. 5/5  VIBE: Small, quiet cafe seating inside and outdoor seating as well. 4/5   VALUE: For two people and with the 10% military discount, it costs about $17.    Worth a Return Visit? I see many sandwiches from Great Harvest Cafe in my future.  YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #249"}
{"text":"Bread was fresh and there were good options. It was easy to order my sandwich exactly how we liked. It was a great sandwich.  Definitely a place we will come back to and recommend."}
{"text":"A warm welcome from the staff and free samples of their bread! This place is a great!!!!"}
{"text":"Eat all the carbs!! I love Great Harvest Bread. Free bread samples are the coolest thing since... sliced bread. Their pumpkin chocolate chip is the most addicting thing ever. I love the turkey pesto sandwich. The cookies and pastries are delicious. It's too bad I'm off carbs... otherwise I'd eat here all the time. There's a check in for a free cookie. And join their rewards program for free bread loaves and sandwiches. The downsides: closed Sundays and, like, every holiday. They don't put milk or half and half out with their coffee (just non dairy creamer)."}
{"text":"This place has the most amazing bakery items.   Stopped in for a sandwich today which was also very nummy.     George was exceedingly helpful and friendly.   As all of his fellow employees.     Love the place."}
{"text":"Great bakery items, cookies, muffins, scones, breads. More than the usual large chains"}
{"text":"The service is hit or miss. During the same shift, my friend had one girl who seemed put out by her questions about soy free products and a girl who continuously apologized for not being able to answer her questions. The girl who tried to help was super friendly and that is what people remember.   The breads are amazing. Not only do you get to try a free slice of bread, but it is the same stuff that they are selling that day. No way are you getting old product, no, they are pulling it off the shelf if they run out of a tester. I had got the double chocolate cherry bread. The same nice staff member asked if I was ok with the heel end. Of course, I love end pieces. It is like getting a corner piece from a batch of brownies. This thick monster piece that no one else wanted was mine for the taking and came with a light spread of butter. If you are a butter lover, they will smear the heck onto it. Make sure to clearly state how much you want because you can never have too much butter is their theory.   After eating this generous piece of over indulgence, I got a loaf of cinnamon raisin bread ($5.50) for French toast making. My friend got the cinnamon swirl bread ($6.50) and a grilled cheese on Asiago sourdough (Around $7). The cinnamon swirl was like a giant cinnamon bun minus the super sweet cream cheese frosting. It was perfect. The grill cheese was beautiful, the quality of both the cheese and bread was amazing.   For those who have soy allergies; the sourdough, cinnamon swirl, and red, white and blueberry breads are all safe."}
{"text":"I have been to this business twice.  I want it to succeed but it just does not register highly on my radar.   Location is not great.  You would think being in the same store grouping as Vom Foss and Penzey's would drive traffic here.  But it is around the corner and out of sight so it's easy to forget about.  If you do make it there, the inside of the business is cute and comfortable.  There are comfy chairs or tables so you can relax or do work.  The bread is good.  They let you sample before buying which is great.  Kinda pricey but anything outside of a grocery store will be, due to overhead and the pure freshness of the products.  Sandwiches are hit and miss.  I've had the PB & J twice and they have been different both times.  I did like my most recent one because the jelly didn't drip all over me and my hands.  At a past visit my friend had tried the Chimichurri Roast Beef and she enjoyed it.  I believe she managed to keep all the fillings inside the bread.  I tried the breakfast biscuit sandwich today.  Too doughy for me.  I don't think I will get that again or I would see if they would put the egg on a firmer bread choice.  Great Harvest is a good alternative to Panera if you don't require a lot of choices.  You just have to remember it's there."}
{"text":"The bread is tasty but the customer service stinks.  They act like it's an imposition to actually wait on you, and to make a sandwich.  There was only one other customer in the store when I visited, and it took 15 minutes to make a sandwich.  When it was made, the young woman threw the bag on the counter and turned her back on me.  Incredible."}
{"text":"Love this place!!  Every time I'm anywhere close to this part of town, I have to make a stop and pick up a loaf of fresh bread.. okay, who am I kidding - I have to pick up two loaves at least! One has to be either the simple white or wheat bread, and the other - is always a surprise!! Their sweet breads are just as delicious as the savory ones. My favorites so far have been the spinach-cheese, and salsa-jalapeno ones. They are very generous with their in-store samples - giving you an opportunity to try and fall in love with their creative flavors before committing. They have a good variety of sandwiches as well. I like their vegetarian sandwiches, but for me - their breads are what get me in to the bakery! With all the bad press that bread has been getting lately around the un-natural ingredients etc. etc. , I had almost given up eating bread until I stumbled upon Great Harvest. And now, I've resumed my love-love relationship with bread! I feel good knowing that I'm eating bread that was baked fresh, with good ingredients, and the right way."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Always fresh and delish!  The lunch sandwiches are pretty tasty too.  Only caution would be to not buy the popcorn they sell in the shop (from a vendor).  The bag was small,  crazy expensive (probably organic or whatever)  and only a few kernels popped.  We have popcorn for dinner at least once a week so we were extremely disappointed with this batch.  Had to pull of the faithful Oriville kernels to get full!"}
{"text":"Focaccia roast beef sandwich was dry as bone, and the sandwiches seemed small for the money.  The cookie and desserts looked really good, but we did not try any because of our diet. Might give them another try down the road."}
{"text":"Awesome place for homemade breads and sweets. I usually only get cinnamon rolls from this spot but if you go to their store in Tempe they have always samples of bread. So after coming here multiple times (also seeing them at the gilbert farmers market) I changed my rating from 4 to 5 stars. Staff is super friendly and inviting, the beard is amazing, and it's an overall good spot."}
{"text":"I've stopped at this location and the one on Stephanie a few times for an after school snack for my little one. They have the best blondie and brownie that I've had in a very long time.  They offer you a slice of bread to try (you can have it w butter, if you choose). The breads I've tasted are so delicious--although I've never actually bought a loaf from here. Like I said, I come here for a treat for my son.  The cookies are very generous portions! Each time I go, the bakery has a diff cookie out. I wish there is a list of the cookies being made on what day, like how the breads are.   I've had lunch here before--and its very similar to Panera. Try it if you haven't already!"}
{"text":"Challah Bread, spinach, pumpkin bread as free samples. Come here now!  I have never felt so welcomed walking into a business.  We immediately walked in and started to look at the bread that was on the racks.  There was one cinna-swirl loaf left and we pounced on it.  We also looked at the menu and found out they had Challah Bread, but they didn't have any out.  They just finished making it and brought a loaf up and gave us a taste.  We were cut a huge piece and it was heavenly.  We also were handed spinach and pumpkin bread too.  One of the bakers asked us what we were going to do with the Challah bread, make french toast, or eat it plain.  We said both.  She gave us a choice of the braided bread or the loaf.    The staff was really helpful, the place was clean, and with a check in you get a huge cookie.  I recommend this place.  Places like this are the reason that I enjoy giving out great reviews.  Please check it out and have some yummy bread."}
{"text":"I love, love, love Great Harvest.  We've had a love affair of nearly 15 years now, starting in Chico when I was in college.  Once I started working I would pick up a cinnamon swirl and share it with my cube mates if I was in town.  I was thrilled when Great Harvest opened a location in Chandler, not even very far from me.  Their breads are all fantastic and they give you samples.  They would earn five stars if they weren't so expensive, seems like the bread in the California stores is a little cheaper, strange.  They also have great sandwiches."}
{"text":"Put moar of deez breads in my mouf.   Turkey pesto sandwich: delicious. Roast beast sandwich: so good (roast beef was rare, could have used a little more seasoning)  The pumpkin chocolate bread was so, so good. It was more like a pound cake than a normal bread--you could totally eat it for dessert.  I got a sample of caramel apple bread (something like that) and it was also super delish.   My mom lives in this area and I'm glad, because I will absolutely be back."}
{"text":"I am allergic to gluten and this place offers gluten free items certain days of the week, every time I go in on those days (around noon-2pm) they say they are already sold out! Make more or stop advertising it!! It's terrible that I drive all the way there to get it and they're sold out."}
{"text":"In a town that has few true bakeries baking bread, Great Harvest Bread is a shining star.  Sure it is a franchise but the staff is clearly proud of their product and the variety of bread choices is vast.  Whether it is the Chocolate Brownie Bread or Hummus Wheat Bread, or the White Chocolate Cherry Bread, Cinnamon Crunch Bread, Sourdough, Whole Wheat, even white bread.  The Hummus Wheat bread is my current favorite.  My daughter loves the cinnamon crunch.  Problem is the store is right by my house, on my way to the gym, supermarket, and just about everywhere else I need to go making it hard to resist.   They also make great sandwiches.  They close at 6 and some of their breads are only made on certain days (Chocolate Brownie Bread on Tuesdays) and those sell out fast so call ahead."}
{"text":"Went here based on yelp reviews and I was not disappointed. Place is very clean and they offer samples when you walk in. I ordered the turkey pesto sandwich on wheat bread and it was very good. My husband ordered the BLT and he enjoyed it, wanted the bacon to be a little more crisper though. I also had a salted carmel cookie and it was soft and chewy. I will definately visit again. The young man at the counter was very nice and informative since it was my first visit."}
{"text":"Giving two stars ONLY because my visit a few weeks ago was awesome. Had a GREAT Little Italy sandwich then.   Went today with a friend. We both had BLT's. Substandard at best.  Sourdough was supposed to be toasted.....it may have been on the grill for two seconds at best.  Bacon in the sandwich - literally a single piece of bacon, cut in half.  Bacon was undercooked.  Saw the lemon squares. Had to try them.  My mom makes them and they are a favorite of mine. I made some at Christmas and I thought I had failed. Nope, compared the the $4 lemon square I had today at GHB, I should be selling mine for $10.  Seemed like yellow food coloring was used in place of lemons.  Looks like I will be going back to Capriotti's."}
{"text":"After getting another awesome reflexology next door at the Golden Feet, we decided to try the Great Harvest sandwiches for lunch.  Their store sells lots of local products such as honey, jam, oil, preserves... We ordered our food at the counter, one Cobb sandwich (roasted turkey, bacon, tomatoes...on jalapeno garlic bread) and one bbq chicken sandwich.  Sandwiches come without any sides unless you ask for it.  It was very nice to have a real sandwich! No cold cut, no bread that you can use to play according with! Bread is wholesome, inside is like a homemade sandwich.  It was plentiful and tasty.  It hit the spot, l will definitively return  soon."}
{"text":"Such a lovely lunch! The food was very very good, the waitress were very nice and accommodating. We sat outside under this beautiful tree and got to enjoy the nice weather. There is more outside seating so I'll definitely be coming back during the warm months"}
{"text":"Purchased Hot Cross Buns for Good Friday. While they had a lovely flavor, they were like bricks!  Dense, heavy little rolls that are nothing like how a Hot Cross Bun should be, which is light and airy."}
{"text":"I haven't tried enough to validate 5 stars, but I did buy a loaf of wheat bread from here, and it was very good. I will certainly be back to try more and will update when I do!"}
{"text":"I come to this place for lunch and it is always a good experience. The staff is very welcoming and helpful and the food is great. You can't leave without a loaf of the pumpkin chocolate chip bread."}
{"text":"One of my favorite ways to start the day. The cheddar garlic loaf is a staple for me. It lasts a half week if it stays in the fridge and it is so versatile; as a breakfast sandwich, with soup, by itself. My favorite thing about this place are the employees. It feels like a big happy family."}
{"text":"Phenomenal bread!! Sandwiches are wonderful,  as is the staff.   Love the mixes and kitchen tools.  We bring home several loaves for ourselves and neighbors every time  e come,  which isn't often enough.    Order the turkey avocado goddess sandwich this time, and added bacon and extra goddess dressing.  Yes."}
{"text":"I don't know what took so long to check this place out. Delicious homemade bread! I felt like Oprah in the WW commercial. I LOVE BREAD!  Went in for the Cinnamon Bread and also got the Spinach & Feta bread which was AMAZING! So delicious and fresh."}
{"text":"First of all,decorate in side store is so nice,and clean!!  Got 2 type of sandwiche which is roast beef and pastrami .Both of them has slots of veggie and meat.and I don't know what kind sauce they used.But it's so good!!  I thought it's kinda pricey but worth it! Stuff was so nice ,they offered me a lot of sample!"}
{"text":"Terrible!!! Not even worth 1 star! My sandwich was sloppy and disgusting looking when I opened it to start. Meat & cheese & bread sliding around couldnt hold the sandwhich together. The bread looked like thin white bread when I ordered sour dough toasted which is always thick! Ended up Throwing it all away & went to Cafe Rio which was amazing!"}
{"text":"Great Harvest is a cute local bakery with some pastries, sandwiches, coffee and tea.  Mainly they have a good selection of fresh bread that you can try and have for your sandwich.  I can endorse them for a quick breakfast or lunch.  They have a variety of sandwiches and the fresh ingredients make it for consistent good quality.  I also think they make for a good take out working lunch place.  Just copy the menu and have people circle what they want to order for a crew.  If you want to give this a try, don't forget to call ahead and find out what breads and cookies are available.  This adds the custom flair to a set of boxes lunches that you really can't get at a typical chain like Kneader's or Jimmy John's.  You won't spend all that much more here, but you'll impress your office guests with better food while still having easy lunch sandwich ordering.  Lastly, I already have go evaluate the ice tea.  One word, excellent.  Ok, I'll add, they have a few different ones, I only tried the black, but it as excellent.  It's always nice when a good lunch is paired with solid ice tea."}
{"text":"They're open again!    Hours Mon-Sat 7-7 Closed Sundays (702)597-0550  Love this place"}
{"text":"Best GF bread you've ever had is baked on Tuesdays.  LOVE LOVE this place."}
{"text":"This place is a gem, you walk inside and it smells like Bakery Heaven! The lunch was fresh and delicious. I enjoyed the salad but highly recommend anything with their bread!!"}
{"text":"Let's just say I'm not a big fan of chain restaurants at all. However, I don't know how these guys instilled the \"can-do\" & \"love every customer\" type attitude in the workers but it feels like the tv show Cheers every time I go in here.   The oatmeal choc chip cookies are my weakness and pumpkin anything there is amazing.  Any of my friends reading my reviews, feel free to buy me My bday presents here. Yum, yum and more yum."}
{"text":"The 5 stars is for the service & loaf bread I purchased only.   Unfortunately, the sandwich (Turk N' Berry) was just barely ok, skimpy and flat and something I could have put it together in a rush at home. Definitely NOT worth $6.95 at all. I would say SEVERELY overpriced sandwiches for the quality.   I honestly didn't know this was a chain, and expected a lot more out of the food here. The girl at the counter and the young man making sandwiches were very friendly and helpful and their attitude was great. I love to come across service people who are doing customer service right, and they really do. They saved this place from being one star. Very pleasant experience.   It's a little out of the way, so probably won't be back. Unfortunately not worth the trek."}
{"text":"What can I say that hasn't been said. Great sandwiches and baked goods, with very friendly service! Some free samples too!"}
{"text":"Used to work at a place in the same shopping center and every Saturday I'd go and get myself either a cookie or a Savannah bar or muffin. Some of the best baked goods Charlotte has to offer."}
{"text":"Yummy in my tummy. This place has theeeee best, homemade bread in Vegas. From pepperoni stuffed bread, to the pumpkin chocolate chip loaf, white wheat bread to my personal favorite the cinnamon roll bread, they have a wide selection of yeasty treats. Ugh, it's just so bad for my hips but it's to die for. Just heat it up with a little bit of butter and you're good to go. In addition to bread they also have cookies, rice krispy's, biscotti and tons of other items you can grab on the go. Note: they even have low carb options *gasp*  Great Harvest has a cute, little dining room. They offer up a variety of sandwiches and have a soda fountain to quench your thirst. Also just for coming in you get a free sample of their bread. They give you a huge slice too! They used to slather it in butter for you but they recently took that away due to a SNHD visit. Baloney I say! Let me have the butter!!!!!!!  The staff is so friendly and warm. They greet you as soon as you walk in the door. It makes the price of $6-$7/loaf sting a little less :)"}
{"text":"Friendly service, great bread and food options.  Take home their cinnamon swirl loaf and make French toast, phenomenal!"}
{"text":"Bought a groupon and they didn't honor it even though it hadn't expired. It took forever for me to get a refund. I blame them and haven't been back since. I was a loyal supporter and loved their food. Bad customer service can destroy a business."}
{"text":"This is such a glorious little cafe and bakery! They kindly give samples of any pastry and bread in stock and change the menu daily. The pastries are divine and the staff know exactly what ingredients are in each because they are the ones baking them daily. You can buy your favorite bread by the loaf (I highly recommend the cinnamon challenge and Dakota) and choose which bread you get with any of their delicious sandwiches. They even have a rewards program for their regulars to earn a free pastry or meal. Besides the fabulous food, the staff are very welcoming and helpful and remember your name, which gives that lovely small town feel in such a populated area."}
{"text":"Delish! Bread samples are so good, the sandwich was amazing and they make will make a recommendation  on what kind of bread would work best for the sandwich you want!"}
{"text":"This is a great little bread bakery, not fancy, just good.  There are a lot of bakeries popping up around Charlotte, but lots seem to be filled with fancy pastries or loads of donuts at a hefty price tag. While I'm all about supporting local business sometimes I can't / don't want to spend 4.50 on a sugary french concoction. I know that GHB is a chain, a rather large chain, but I really, like this location.   Right next to Trader Joe's and on my way to work, I've stopped here a few times in the morning. They aren't usually very busy, the staff is very friendly and their pastries are the perfect sidekick to my morning coffee. A little taste of happiness on my way to work. They are extremely fresh as well!  For my waistline, this bakery is a bad place, for a sweet treat it is perfect. I've never tried the breads, but I have tried the scuffins ( scone-muffin combination) and the mini cinnamon rolls both delicious.  The scuffins are the size of your palm and $2.15."}
{"text":"We walked into this place cause we saw a sign for the nitro coffee and wanted to try it, when we went in we were greeted with a hello by a friendly guy I wish I got his name. He offered us a bread sample which was delicious. We ended up ordering a sandwich because of that experience it was the roast beef chimi curry which was absolutely delicious. Leiha was our cashier and didn't make us feel comfortable at all, no smile or a thank you and the nitro was flat. If we had a cashier as friendly as the guy was when we walked in and had just ordered a sandwich I would have given 5 stars."}
{"text":"Glad this place opened! So close to my office too. Their bread is amazing.... so are their muffins and scones. Basically everything thats bad for you to indulge in \"carbwise\"... but they are health conscious as well.  They get their whole wheat from family farms in Montana so that is a great selling point and statement about what they stand for.  Their lunch sandwiches are pretty darn good.  There aren't any tables and chairs, so it's a dash in and out type set up... but there's a bar in the corner and four stools to take a load off while waiting for your order.  I ended up eating there.  The staff is super friendly and know a lot about their products... it's a tough job since their recipes keep rotating on a seasonal basis."}
{"text":"My first exposure to Great Harvest Bread was from running 5K's and having something to munch on after running.  Now that the Run For Your Life store has moved into the same shopping complex, the two of them go well together...especially during the week when I run at 5:30 in the morning... and they usually open up at 7am... [sometimes a little earlier since they see a pathetic looking running running waiting outside the door].  Aside from having some super friendly people serving up products, this location is super convenient and you can look upon the Uptown skyline after making your bread/treat selections.  One thing I noticed my last visit was that they set out cafe tables and chairs on the side of the building (not seen from the front).  They have a couple tables inside as well, but they have a ton of other products you can choose from on their shelves... from the jellies and dry soups in bags.  Don't forget their sample board!  I always walk in and find something new here.  I'm pretty sure this is the location that sponsor a lot of the race events in the Charlotte area where you will find Jeff slinging out yummy stuff after races.  My favorite is the cinnamon chip with a little honey drizzle on top..... definitely negates the running I just did, but so worth it."}
{"text":"This is 3rd time I have been in the place and gotten day old Bread!!!!   Really, really....  You're a bread company, don't charge $6.75 for day old bread.    I have been to great harvest in Utah, Oregon and in Green Valley.  It is the most awesome bread on the planet.    I have to say I am very annoyed at the Decatur location.   The first time, I went with my kids and got it on white and when I said something to the empoyee about it, she said it wasn't baked there and came in the day before.     I just went there and spent over $20.00 on 3 loaves of bread and it's DAY OLD.  I will never go back!!!!!"}
{"text":"Our whole family loves this place. Whenever I go back to visit my family in Spartanburg I am requested to pick up loaves of bread to bring with me. Honey wheat is our go to sandwich bread and I love the Tuscan. If you are looking for crusty artisan breads this is not what they specialize in but if you want great every day bread then this is just the right place!"}
{"text":"the food is always so good here a little slow service but overall good. For being a sandwich place they should get a bigger variety on their menu."}
{"text":"I don't do bread often anymore but if I am going to do bread - you will definitely catch me here.   Yes, this store is tiny and it gets crowded - quickly. But the people here are kind and helpful. They really do their best to ensure that they help you quickly and if there is going to be a wait, they address you and apologize for the delay.   For Thanksgiving - I wanted a loaf of stuffing bread and wasn't sure if they would have any when I got off of work and made it there, so I called in the morning and they were very kind in helping me and made sure that would set aside a loaf for me to have to pick-up. You guys, that stuffing was a hit at thanksgiving. The bread was so deliciously seasoned. They recommended that you set it in a paperbag for 2-3 days so that it would become \"stale\". I did this and was worried it wasn't going to be stale enough, the bread I started with was just so fresh and soft - I was worried. But it worked out and everyone loved the stuffing. I didn't even have to season it much because the stuffing loaf was so delicious as is.   The sandwiches and soup here are pretty amazing too. The sausage and kale soup is my favorite and the gouda and red pepper is super tasty too!  I haven't had a sweet treat here that I didn't like. The sweet potato muffin is hands down my favorite and the pumpkin bars are a cream cheese lover's delight.   DO NOT FORGET about their jams, jellies and butters here. They make the perfect accompaniment to their breads."}
{"text":"Great Harvest bread was a favorite of mine when I lived in Vegas. Since moving to Reno four years ago and not having been back here in two years, I was craving my favorite sandwich shop!  It was my first stop when I came back to Vegas, and boy was it worth it. We were greeted immediately upon walking in the door and were offered a free sample of some bread that was on their cutting board. I had the lemon poppy seed bread and it was delicious! I got the chicken berry pecan sandwich (always been my favorite) as a combo meal. My boyfriend got the turkey pesto as a combo meal as well and the total was about 22 dollars. Food came out within probably 8 minutes. We sat outside as the weather was incredible. My boyfriend loved his sandwich, and I loved mine as well! I just wish there was one in Reno again!"}
{"text":"There food is absolutely delicious. Amazing bread. The food is 5 stars, but I'm writing this review because of their service.   My boyfriend and I were grocery shopping one evening and decided we wanted to get a loaf of Great Harvest bread instead of a loaf from the grocery store. We walked in and were not greeted at all. Not even a hello. We were the only customers in there so there really is no excuse. We eventually decided on a bread from the rack and approached the register. Still, no physical words left the employees mouth. I saw that there was a loaf of bread on their free samples cutting board and expected to get offered a slice. Never happened. But, what really irritated me was my boyfriend specifically asked, \"Oh, that looks really good ! What kind of bread is that ?\" The employee told us it was coconut. My boyfriend then proceeded to say, \"Oh that must be amazing, I love coconut!\" .... STILL DIDN'T OFFER US A SAMPLE !!! We will not be returning to this location. I will drive to the other side of town before I step back into this location.   (btw, all the other locations I have been to go out of their way to greet you and offer you a sample before you even make it to the counter)"}
{"text":"We tend to drop by here whenever we make the trek to Trader Joes.  I've never tried any of the sandwiches but read good things in other reviews.  Our favorite bread is hands down the cinnamon chip.  It's like dessert for breakfast.  Very good slathered in butter (But then, what's not good slathered in butter!).  Don't come expecting artisanal breads but do come expecting much better than your local Harris Teeter bakery fare.  On the whole cinnamon chip bread thing, it's good that Great Harvest isn't closer to home.  My waistline appreciates it..."}
