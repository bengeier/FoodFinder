{"text":"went for lunch, had the chicken teriyaki ramen. chicken was tasty, ramen was good. decent prices for under 8$"}
{"text":"The chef is very warm and welcoming. Great atmosphere and the food is DELICIOUS. Their sandwiches and stir fried udon are divine and the prices are absolutely fantastic"}
{"text":"I go here for lunch on a regular basis - it's a good choice when you don't feel like getting pho or fast food, which is the majority of the restaurants in the area are. The main reason I'm writing this review is that I feel that they deserve more business.

First of all, the sandwiches are really good - this is coming from someone who lives downtown Toronto a block away from Banh Mi Boys and Burger's Priest. There are 3 choices of sandwiches: beef, chicken, or shrimp and they're all made like philly cheesesteaks(ie. they have melted cheese & mushrooms on top). They really need to work on their advertising because if anyone thought that they could get a philly for $3 in the area the place would be a madhouse.

The specials are alright too, basically your average meat/vegetables/teriyaki sauce on top of rice and usually hovering around $5.

For the ramen they advertise in the window, don't expect Momofuku, it's probably closer to a soup that you would expect from one of those Teriyaki places you would find in a mall food court.

In short - go here if you want a philly at a ridiculous price"}
{"text":"Passed by and went in for a try.  The prices at a glance are real cheap.  Special is only under $5.  Beef sub is under $3.

Ordered Ramen.  What can I really say is that with such a cheap price, don't expect anything fancy.  It's decent.  The noodle is between Ramen and tastes a bit like instant noodle.  The soup, of course, is not the milky broiled soup.  It's just a soya bean soup!"}
{"text":"My husband ordered the beef sandwich with swiss cheese (only $3.49)and it was really good. I ordered the pork cutlet ramen and it was just mediocre. Noodle bowl was small for $7.99. They definitely should change their name to teriyaki house instead of calling it a ramen house. I saw another man ordered their \"Yoki Special\" and the portion was good for $6.49 but don't think we will come back unless it's for the sandwich."}
{"text":"The owner is sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo nice. Customer service was A+++.

However, the ramen was bland and underwhelming. Everyone at my table was not happy with their dish. It's not the caliber of ramen in DT Toronto. We will not be going back, but wish the owner the best of luck as again - super nice guy. Just wish the food was better."}
{"text":"The owner Allan is a delight, and more importantly, so are the meals he makes! I went here for the first time last week and I've been back two times since. I've tried the salmon teriyaki (yum), seafood udon (yummy) and seafood ramen noodle soup (YUM). The seafood and vegetables are fresh and Allan is very passionate about his craft. This is my new go-to spot for a tasty and filling meal under $10!"}
{"text":"Eat here once a week. I enjoy the shrimp, chicken and beef sandwiches. Clean, efficient and the owner is very friendly."}
{"text":"I went here for dinner with my parents recently and everything was great.  The owner was really nice and friendly and made us feel very welcomed.  The food was also pretty good.  

I had the Seafood Ramen ($7.99), my dad had the Teriyaki Beef Ramen ($6.99), and my mom had the Beef Sizzling Yoki Sandwich ($3.25).  The food was so good that when we finished, my dad wanted to get some food to go for a midnight snack later that night, lol, so we got an order of the \"Beef and Shrimp Mix It Up\" ($7.29).

The owner told us that the ramen broth doesn't contain MSG.  This is good news.  The broth was good.  It was flavourful, but not too salty.  It's a shoyu (soy sauce) broth though (not tonkotsu (pork bone), unfortunately).  Nonetheless, I enjoyed my soup.  My seafood ramen had 3 good sized shrimps, 2 thin slices of kamaboko (fish cake), 3 large pieces of surimi (imitation crab), and 2 very large mussels (without the shells).  It also had half a marinaded egg, mushrooms, seaweed (kombu), bean sprouts, cabbage and green peppers.  It usually comes with corn and sesame seeds, but I can't eat these items, so I told them to exclude them.  

My dad's ramen was basically the same as mine, except instead of the seafood items I mentioned above, he had tender slices of beef.  The ramen noodles were good, but they weren't super chewy and curly the way I like my ramen.  

My mom's sandwich was also very good (I had a bite).  It's very similar to a Philly Cheese Steak, except the beef has some teriyaki sauce on it.  There's mushrooms in it and I think either cheese or a mayonnaise sauce drizzled on.  It also had lettuce and tomatoes in it and it's served on a submarine bun.  

The Mix It Up plate was also good. A generous amount of tender beef slices, 4 medium sized shrimp, a pile of cabbage, bean sprouts and green peppers, and a bed of white steamed rice.  We even got some extra teriyaki sauce on the side.  

The place is not that large, and it's a casual eatery where you order at the counter, not a full service restaurant.  The restaurant is clean, including the washrooms.

I love going to Vaughan Mills Mall when I'm in Toronto, and after all that shopping, I get hungry.  I used to go eat at the food court, but no more!  I would much rather venture across the parking lot to the strip malls close by and eat at one of the smaller independent restaurants like Yoki Teriyaki Japan!  

The food here is much better than at the food court in my opinion, and the owner is so awesome.  Love it!  :)"}
{"text":"Cheap and cheerful is how I would summarize this place. Previous reviews were spot on with a friendly Vietnamese owner who makes you feel welcome. Sandwiches are a fusion of Philly cheesesteak meats Bahn Mi with a Dash of Japanese, surprisingly works well."}
{"text":"The best teriyaki sandwich I ever had. Make sure to add Swiss cheese on it! Very Reasonable price."}
{"text":"The guy that works there is sooo nice! The food is delicious also! If you're looking for something not too pricey, as well as healthy, you should definitely go here!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The chef here is amazing. It's a small quick place to grab a bite but the food is fresh and cooked right in front of you. The owner is a genuine person who cares about the quality of his food and customers."}
{"text":"Very sweet people,  food is excellent,  price is amazing you must try this out! I love this place,"}
{"text":"As mentioned in other posts, the owner is super friendly and if for no other reason I hope his business survives and succeeds as the food is not terrible.  I had a chicken sandwich and beef sandwich, both with cheese.  The meat is actually grilled to order (as opposed to regular banh mi which is cold or subway which is warmed under the toaster for 60 seconds).   The price is excellent considering what you are getting.  Any other questions you have can probably be dealt with by looking at the pictures of the sandwiches.   It is fast friendly comfort food."}
{"text":"I go to Yoki Teriyaki pretty regularly and I absolutely love it. The guys that own the place are really nice and welcoming. Even though it's a take out place, they will go as far as to personally serve you your food and bring you utensils and hot sauce to the table. The food is great, my fav being the Beef Teriyaki (made spicy) with brown rice. The beef sandwich is also really great!
It's overall a little hidden gem and I would suggest it to anyone."}
{"text":"Amazing sandwiches!!! Enough said!!! You will be blown away from the heart and soul put into this simple sandwich place!!! Trust me. . . You will want seconds as well!!! ............DL"}
{"text":"Teriyaki Banh Mi Sub Crossover might be the most popular item at Yoki Teriyaki Japan. I do like how the bun was toasted so it was nice and warm. And for $3.29? Don't expect much substance as there was hardly any protein in my chicken one (don't look at the photos on the menu for sandwich with all the meat overflowing from the bun, then you won't be too disappointed). Swiss cheese reminds me of cheese dip with nachos. 

I would try the beef next time. Maybe that will be more like a \"Philly Cheese Steak\" Sandwich. And I would ask for less sauce (mayo or whatever they put on it)

The owner was nice and friendly and the food all made when order. Not a bad option for a cheap snack!"}
