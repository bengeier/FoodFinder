{"text":"Best bolognese sauce I have tasted.  Bread was late being served due to back up at oven.  Management should think about another oven to accommodate customers.  Service was great, salad was awesome, and manager was attentive.  Would definitely would return.  A very pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Terrible. My wife and both ordered soup. Mine came out 5 minutes before my wife's did. Then my main course came out 10 minutes before my wife's and daughters did. I had the clam bake and had t0 send the corn back because it looked like it was dropped on the floor several times. Then my daughters pasta came with the wrong type of noodles and the server said my wife's food would be out shortly. Then as I was paying the bill my server took my beer before I was finished with it. What a disaster."}
{"text":"This place is loud and over priced. The lunch special that features a house salad and personal pizza is VERY small . And be aware there is an upcharge for a different salad. In other words, and we weren't told this before hand, you pay for the meal PLUS another salad, and the pizza was about 5 inches across. Ridiculous. Told the manager about it, he pretty much said oh well, tough shit. Never going back."}
{"text":"My new favorite Italian restaurant in Avon. Great food, great staff. I will have them cater my company outing at a local sports venue."}
{"text":"Overall the place looks cute, but it is way too noisy and slow. Sounds like you're at a crowded bar not an Italian restaurant and then it took at least half an hour before the food came out (I lost track) we were there for over an hour. Not worth the wait. The food is in no way impressive."}
{"text":"Very Impressed. Sandra was great we had a party of 6 with no reservation and they immediately sat us. Thanks Sandra :)  The pizza was delicious the dough, cheese and sauce were all great ingredients you could taste the difference.    Sangria was refreshing. I recommend trying a glass"}
{"text":"Great, fast service for lunch. I had the personal pizza w/salad lunch special (photo below) and my husband had the chicken parm sandwich w/fries. Everything was delicious. Well definitely return next time were in Avon. Two lunches, from a local place, under $35 is great considering we'd Spend just as much at Panera."}
{"text":"Meatballs were huge and tasty. Eggplant appetizer was yummy. Lasagna was tasty but served in a large bowl and awkward to eat. Pizzelles were good."}
{"text":"The arugala salad was good but not a fan of the pizza. It was undercooked, they took it back, and then just cooked the same pie and served it back to us! Not impressed for a new place."}
{"text":"I would like to give 3.5 stars but it's not an option.  My husband and I dined here last Friday.  We had a 7:00 reservation and did not have to wait.  Our waitress took our drink order promptly and was very friendly.  We ordered the mussel appetizer and while the broth was delicious the mussels were fishy...disappointing because the broth was really good.  I did advise the waitress of this but she really didn't comment.  The breadsticks that come to the table were good...especially dipped in the broth.  I ordered the eggplant parmesan with a side of pasta aglio/olio.  Eggplant was wonderful!  Very flavorful and cooked perfectly with regard to tenderness of the eggplant.  The sauce was also very good and I am very picky about tomato sauce.  Pasta had a lot of flavor but was very dry...really needed a bit more oil.  My husband enjoyed their version of Bolognese made with short rib meat...really, really good!  Spumoni and cr√®me brulee for desert and both were good.  The manager did stop by our table to ask how everything was and graciously accepted our comments and acknowledged they are still \"feeling things out\" and working out the kinks.  We will definitely give it another try and it's really nice to see a non-chain restaurant in this area.  We hope they do well!"}
{"text":"Visited Cafe Piccolo for the first time tonight. Wednesday evening and got there at about 7:45pm.  Despite the restaurant being pretty full, we were seated right away. Our waiter was quick to bring water for everyone.   We had the bolognese and the pork osso buco. Both were equally delicious. The meat in each dish was fall apart tender. The pasta was homemade and very good as well. All of the pasta dishes and meat/fish entrees came with a house salad which made the meals nicely priced for such a tasty meal. The focaccia bread that was served with the salad was warm, served with seasoned olive oil and was also very good.   We didn't have room for dessert, but they have some tempting options for next visit. Great addition to the community."}
{"text":"No thanks!  Please don't claim to be \"authentic Italian\" while serving subpar, bland food without garlic, basil, or oregano - or any seasoning for that matter.  The eggplant parmesan was breaded to death, and charred on the bottom.  The house salad was very fresh, but the bread was not and the overly breaded chicken picatta was soggy and the lemon sauce was gooey.  Please hire some real chefs!"}
{"text":"First timer.  The food was excellent.  The prices are good.  Service was a little slow but they are new.  Wait person disappeared for a while several times but the food delivery person made sure we had what we needed and kept the bar up to speed with what we wanted from the bar.  Definitely will be be back soon!"}
{"text":"Really excited to try this new spot in our town!  Loved the environment and the outdoor patio!  The food was very good!  Burrata appetizer got us excited.  Carbonara pasta was a hit. Everything was very good, but the service was slow and seemed they were still trying to get their flow.  Will definitely give them another chance to work that out!"}
{"text":"First time visit for lunch with a party of eight. It was a bit crowded which would account for the slight delay but the delicious food made up for it. I had the chicken Parmesan and it was out of this world. The pricing was typical of a full service meal."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty solid, and done very well. They have really good bread, and the most amazing bolognese I have ever had before. I dined in one time and it was a little awkward and seemed to not be as smooth running as it could be. There were lots of stagnant staff and things unattended to. The second time we got take out, and it did not disappoint. Happy to have this option close!"}
{"text":"Great FRESH  Italian dishes!  Menu has a a nice variety with seasonal/daily specials.  Moderately priced, great dining experience with attention to detail. A local favorite.  Bolognese a must and fresh hand made lasagna enough to take home for a night of no cooking.  Tiramisu devine while tge flourless chocolate cake with chocolate mousse soup a chocolate lovers dream!  Truly a gem of the far west side!"}
{"text":"My family enjoyed our dinners very much! We all got something different and each dish was delicious. Suzanne was a attentive and fantastic server. Food came out in perfect timing. Will be back, wish you all the success Cafe Piccolo!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were there on a Monday and it was surprisingly busy. The server was quick to get us refills, and was just really attentive. The food was a little slow coming out. I'm guessing because they were so busy, but we thought it was well worth the wait. I had the Lasagna and I thought it was delicious although I thought the plate it came on which was more of a bowl was kind of strange, but now I'm just nitpicking.   When it came time for the bill I thought everything was pretty reasonably priced especially for the amount of food we both had. We will be going back again."}
{"text":"The place is cute. Well decorated and spaceious. The menu wasnt much to look at and everything seemed to be a bit expensive in my opinion. But the food was delicious. After Looking at the drink and wine menu i wasnt too impressed  i did not spot anything sweet and when i asked the server about a few wines she really didnt have any suggestions . So we will definately go back for a bite to eat. But will stop for drinks somewhere else"}
{"text":"Stopped if for a quick bite. It was very quiet at 6:30 when we arrived. The server was less than enthused to be waiting on us, even being a little short at times. We ordered drinks. One guest ordered an espresso martini.  She complied and eventually brought out what appeared and tasted like coffee and vodka. The guest made an unusual face or two and asked if they might put a splash of Baileys in it to give it some body or creaminess. They obliged floating it in unstirred. It did help. Later we discovered they added a $2.50 up charge to do so.  Calamari was ok. It loses it crispiness with the sauce added.  The Pizza was fair. My chicken piccata was lackluster and tepid. It was sent back. The chicken Parmesan was actually a bit tough and also fair. Overall, a miss for the money.  At the end of the meal, it was still the server that stuck out most."}
{"text":"A very good Italian option for Cleveland's Westside. I am Canadian and enjoy poutine and was happy to see that they have an Italian version as an appetizer. I would recommend it as it was very well executed and blended Canadian style with Italian tastes. We shared it as an app but I suppose it could be enjoyed as an entree if you are feeling particularly glutinous!  For my main i opted for the burger. It was one of the better burgers I have had with that same Italian infusion into a traditional staple of a dish. Very clever."}
{"text":"The food was OK, not as good as Wood & Wine. The ambiance was horrible. It was like eating at a sports bar. Very noisy. So much for a romantic evening out. Won't go back."}
{"text":"For being a new restaurant, things were running pretty smoothly. Food was good, service was good. Drinks good as well. The place was a little cold. AC blowing right on the tables."}
{"text":"Went there with 3 adults and 2 kids on a Friday night. The food was very good and the waitress was very friendly. The problem was with how slow it was. From the time we were seated until my bowl of spaghetti came was an hour and 20 minutes. Thats just too long, especially when you have kids. Hopefully they can fix this."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to this restaurant, and I wasn't incredibly impressed. Our waitress seemed a little more concerned about entertaining us than actually serving us, which isn't what I personally come to a restaurant for. The food was a bit hit-and-miss for me. We ordered an eggplant appetizer that looked really nice but was bland. When actually ordering entrees, I had asked if I could get a dish made without peas in it and was told no, and that the peas weren't a huge part, so I could just pick around it. Instead she suggested I build my own pasta and talked me into quite a bit of food. The italian sausage was definitely worth it, while the meatballs were not. For dessert, I got the tiramisu, which was okay. It didnt have the coffee flavor to it, and the lady fingers weren't soft - it was pretty much all mascarpone cheese. I may try this place again, but I definitely wasn't sold."}
{"text":"Rude greet staff. They would not even offer to seat us at 5:30 on Friday evening due too many upcoming reservations. Empty seats everywhere  Greeter was annoyed by us."}
{"text":"Fourth time we have tried this place. Keep hoping we just got them on a bad night, but nope, it's just bad. Waitress reeked of smoke, food very mediocre, red sauce tasted like Ragu. Really wish food was better because decor and location good."}
{"text":"We went in a Tuesday evening around 7.    Seems to be ample parking.   1st impression upon walking in was that it seems well decorated, warm and inviting.   Hostess was super pleasant.  Actually, everyone we encountered was super nice and a accommodating.   I had a persecco that was very good. My 17 year old had water, our server left a bottle of water, but if she walked by and noticed any water missing from his glass, she stopped to fill it.  It's these small details that are such a nice classy touch.  They serve a complimentary focaccia bread and homemade dipping sauce.  It was very good and I tried to only eat one piece but could not resist more! We got the calamari app.  You get a good amount, and it too was very tasty.   My 17 year old ordered the chicken Parmesan which comes w/a salad but he opted to upgrade to the wedding soup for a couple more dollars.  He enjoyed both.  I tried both and they were good.  Only thing is that wedding soup had chicken instead of the little meatballs.  Breading in chicken was spot on. Marinara sauce was good too.  I got the chicken piccata.  It was good, one of the better ones I've had.  But very rich.  They could actually hold off on so much sauce .  Next time I would probably ask for sauce on the side if possible.  Or at least half the amount.  My piccata came with a house salad but I upgraded that to a Caesar which was totally worth it!! Probably my most favorite Caesar salad ever!  The dressing was sooo creamy and delicious and the croutons were so good too!! Drooling just thinking about it!   My piccata also came with a side of pasta w/marinara which was fine.  Both if us could not finish and have a meal for tomorrow.    Dessert menu looked good, unfortunately we have to wait till next time to try and save room for it!"}
{"text":"Food was great; service was slow and wait staff unfriendly. We were sat in a section by the hostess then asked to move. Never had that happen before. Waited 15 minutes after we were done with dinner just to get our check."}
{"text":"I recently dined here with my parents during a visit home and enjoyed my meal. We arrived on the early side of dinner time and were quickly seated at a large booth. Our waitress was by soon after to take our orders. The service was great and our orders came out without a long wait.  The herbed bread and oil before the meal was delicious. I had to stop myself from filling up on this. My Chicken Piccata came with a house salad, but had the option to get a different salad for a small upcharge. I went with the Panzanella Salad and really enjoyed it. There was plenty of mozzarella and it was heavy on the balsamic vinegar (a good thing to me!). The portion was large for a pre-meal salad. The Chicken Piccata was also a large portion, enough for two servings for me. The chicken was good and I liked the sauce. They didn't skimp on the delicious capers. There was also a side of pasta with a nice tasting marinara. All of the meals at our table were very large portions for the price."}
{"text":"Cafe Piccolo has great, fresh food! The eggplant appetizer was delicious along with the italian wedding soup! We also tried the meatballs and homemade pappadelle and they were a nice surprize as well. We had a nice long lunch at the bar and also brought home the wild mushroom, truffle pizza that was to die for!  My reason for 4 stars instead of 5 was due to the service. I sat at the bar for several minutes, then decided to ask the hostess for a wine list because no one was around. The bartender finally came out, but she was in no hurry to serve me a drink. We also had to ask for water, which should just be automatic once you sit down. We had to flag her down from end of bar because she was busy talking to another emplyee and eating a sandwich.   I would definately recommend this restaurant because the food is delicious, prices are good, but the service needs polishing! I will definately get take out on a regular basis!"}
{"text":"Was expecting to be disappointed but I actually had very good meal. Ordered the Italian wedding soup which was delicious and full of flavor. The salad that accompanied the meal was surprisingly tasty and fresh, but the thing that will bring me back is the Bolognese. So so good and huge portions as well for low price but quality at the same time. Only reason not 5 stars is because the waitress was too busy to ever check on us."}
{"text":"Wife and I stopped in for dinner and food and service were great. I would recommend cafe piccolo and I will return."}
{"text":"Top notch five stars for food, friendliness and service. Our food had such great flavors and we loved our waitress she was so friendly and courteous and was very helpful in navigating the menu. Kudos to the chef for a great meal and kudos to the staff for being so awesome. Calamari to die for, chicken Parmesan was tasty and I had the short rib bolagnese so yummy!"}
{"text":"All presentation, no flavor. Nice environment, friendly staff, and the meals looked delicious. However, everything was noticeably under-seasoned on all five dishes our party ordered, and there wasn't salt and pepper on the tables. A previous reviewer was spot on with the calamari; the first bite was good. The breading had zero flavor, but the sauce they drizzled over it tasted good. By the time you finish, the calamari is soggy from the sauce. Set all that aside, I won't go back just due to the upcharges. I'm not cheap, and I don't mind paying for things that cost a restaurant money, but a $4 charge to switch mixed greens with romaine is ridiculous. The salads that come with the meals are basically just lettuce on a saucer. We had a kid in our party who \" doesn't like purple lettuce\", so we asked for the Caesar. I've never been to an Italian place that doesn't provide that option free since it costs them the same, but Piccolo charged us $4. It was basically three leaves of lettuce! If it was larger than the house salad I might understand, but it was three leaves of lettuce! I really wanted to like this place."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Piccolo in Mayfield and was excited to see they were opening a second location in Avon.  The food here is good, but I'm disappointed about the very open and loud atmosphere as well as the slow mediocre service of the Avon location.    Nothing at all like the ambiance and service they have on the east side.  I sure hope they figure it out because I really like their food, but service/atmosphere is key for me to frequent any restaurant.  A warm Italian feel just makes the food and experience so much better."}
{"text":"First visit to Cafe Piccolo  Tuesday evening, cafe was half empty.  Soup was cold, was returned. Water was empty for most of our dinner. We ordered at 7 PM and have two children... our food arrived over 45 minutes later. this does not work in a family neighborhood.  My lasagna was burn to hell (see pic) and pizza was bland.  My wife enjoyed her salad.  Overall, NO GRAZIE! --- we won't be back."}
