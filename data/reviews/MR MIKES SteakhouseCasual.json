{"text":"Food was good and service was good. The 3 star rating is due to the kitchen being slow .45 min wait for our meals glad that the food was good when it arrived maybe it was just because I was starving by the time it arrive but it was delisious,  we had the salmon neptune and the steak salad."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely horrible. Party of 6 had to wait over an hour and a half. The staff was unfriendly and inattentive. Some dishes arrived cold, others arrived well before others. Will never be going back again. Avoid."}
{"text":"Went here my first week living in Airdrie. Great food !! However, the service wasn't overly great. We decided to sit on the patio and usually you don't get the greatest service out there, but there were about 3 waitresses/waiters, so it didn't really make sense as to why it was such brutal service out there. But overall, they did have excellent food and drinks. Just need to work on their service skills.  :)"}
{"text":"Came here for nice family dinner. Service was a bit slow to start off. 15 mins to get drinks started but the place was packed when we got there so, I wasn't surprised. Once the drinks came though, things went pretty good. From order to plate was about 15 min. My burger was excellent. Sometimes Mr Mikes burgers can be hit and miss. But everything was cooked properly from bun to patty. Server was good as well."}
{"text":"Incredible service, amazing meal. We had the steak and shrimp, bacon wrapped scallops and stuffed mushrooms and all of it was soooo good. I'm highly impressed with the quality of service and quality of food. Cooked to perfection. Polite and courteous staff right from the entrance to the good byes ."}
{"text":"A group of about 20 of us went to Mikes for our staff Christmas party. That's no small task for any restaurant. The serving staff did a perfect job. They made sure all of the guests were able to order exactly what they wanted and didn't make a single mistake. The kitchen did forget one of the steaks which arrived about 15 min. after everyone else's but the server offered complimentary soup or salad to make up for it. I've been to this restaurant before and the quality of both the food and the service are consistently excellent. I recommend Mr Mikes to my friends and family."}
{"text":"My steak was delicious, I will give them that! There were zero complaints where food quality was concerned. HOWEVER, my daughter requested to go here for her birthday and proudly announced to the server that it was her birthday today. There wasn't much acknowledgement, then at the end of the meal after receiving our bills I asked about their birthday specials (?).. the server replied \"I, uh, guess I could get her a little ice cream or something\"..  Thanks for offering a 99 cent ice cream on our easily $200 bill. I mean I don't need anyone to roll out a red carpet but thought it was pretty lame. My daughter was a little bummed that she wasn't offered a somewhat decent dessert. There are pretty few restaurants that don't offer a little song or something. Needless to say we won't be back."}
{"text":"We actually went to a Mr Mikes in Red Deer, AB, and had a great burger (the Classic) so we decided to try the location in Airdrie and it was just as good.  

The burgers here are juicy, messy, and saucy good.  I had the Classic with mushrooms but as my husband pointed out, I should have gone with the mushroom burger, taken the lettuce, tomatoes, and onion off, and paid way less because there was a $2.99 charge for the mushrooms.  I would have thought that was for a side with a steak or something.  I won't be doing it that way again, that's for sure.  But the mushrooms were fresh and cooked perfectly and the french bread it's served on is divine because it's like grilled garlic bread with a good burger on it.  

We did attend the Okotoks locations and had a very good experience there as well.

The service is always very good.  They care very much about your dining experience."}
{"text":"I can't tell you what the food is like, as we sat for 10 full minutes without a soul coming over. There were several people working the dining room, and not one of them even glanced our way. They were not rushed, there was plenty of opportunity for someone to come over.  We mentioned on the way out that they must not need our money. The hostess response was \"Oh, did you want me to get someone?\" . No thanks."}
{"text":"Service was good. However it was way to expensive for sub-par steak. Can get better at Walmart accross the street. I will never return nor recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"The clam chowder is amazing. And the steak bites are great for a group appetizer, very flavourful. The prices are average for a sit down restaurant. The only complaint I would have would be when with a larger group. I completely understand that big groups get slower service, its a lot of work! But it seemed longer then most restaurants that can accommodate, twice!  With a very large extended family when we need to sit at all different tables because they can't move them around, a really long wait can feel even longer. Overall, a good chain restaurant but not the be all and end all of Airdrie."}
{"text":"Stopped for after dinner drinks never having been to a Mr Mikes and was hoping for a new north end fave. The coffee was cold, took a couple of tries to get other menu drinks mixed properly. Restaurant looked nicer on the outside than the inside - it was hard to believe there were so many people in the bar area on a weeknight. Service barely passable. Have zero desire to eat here from the surrounding food sights and smells, will not be back. Just not a comfortable, feel good kind of place to us. 
2 stars."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a \"fast\" bite, and the service was dreadfully slow. While the food was decent enough, it took almost 45 minutes from getting our order taken to being served. 

The waitress, during the wait, only checked our table twice, and never bothered to reassure us that we hadn't been forgotten. 

Overall, the restaurant gave a very unpolished vibe - there was confusion at the hostess stand as to where to seat us, our chairs and table were EXTREMELY wobbly, and it was cold enough that our whole party was shivering. 

I'd skip here and check out the adjacent Boston Pizza next time we're in a hurry."}
{"text":"Went here with my dad for supper. Was the worst steak I have had in a long time. Almost left it for the trash. I finished most, paid the bill and got the hell out."}
{"text":"Food was so so the staff patronizing asked for a half litre of wine and told I could not have it at the table that they had to keep it behind the bar and pour it for me one glass at a time, such bs"}
{"text":"Came here on Wednesday night and the steak bites were really good along with the chips and chipotle dip. I'd go back just for those chips and dip alone. Service was good as our waitress was very friendly"}
{"text":"Steak and burger were good but nothing special. Service is always good though so will defenitely come back again. And oh i love thier bulldogs! One of good restaurants in airdrie, considering theres not many good restaurants in town."}
{"text":"Stopped on our way back from the mountains and wanted a sit down restaurant along the highway.  Mike's proved to be the best choice available. Our waiter walked us through the menu with an overly long spiel about everything. Totally unnecessary as the menu was easy to understand/

Had a Mike's burger: patty was good; pickle crunchy. But all it it was pricey, the additional mushrooms were almost $2. 

The steak sandwich was an unadorned triangle of sirloin steak on a piece of garlic toast and came with fries. Totally lacking any presentation.

The most memorable thing about this place was the overwhelming odour of vomit that greeted us when we came in.  It seems someone had been very sick in the bar the day before and the stench lingered on."}
{"text":"excellent burgers steak and the best chicken phylo yummy. terrible ceasars served in tiny glasses and not seasoned properly total rip off. one ceasars salad had hardly any dressing at all and the server didn't even check on us. bad service the 3 times we went but the food is good"}
{"text":"First time here and the place was very warm and inviting. 

Decor very modern and restaurant is also kid friendly. 

Very clean and staff are super friendly. 

Order steak sandwich with fries and gravy. Tasty well cooked and priced well. 

Service was very good. Menu choice is huge and kids menu is decent. 

Missed trying their sticky toffee pudding as it was  unavailable and not told till we tried to order it. 

Overall great family restaurant but also good for night out."}
{"text":"This particular location is in quite a decent spot, easily seen from just off of the highway nestled with a few other restaurants.  I was feeling a bit hungry so I stopped in for lunch.
It was a very nice day out, so I opted for the patio.  From my spot on the patio, I could see my truck, and it took all of my willpower to not set off the alarm when people got close and scare the crap out of them.  No, this time I'll practice a bit of restraint.
The server arrived fairly quickly and it was the perfect weather for a beer.  These menus always have me looking at them for 10+ minutes.  I can never decide what to have....steak, a burger, pasta etc.  I opted to start with the soup from their summer menu.  I don't recall the name, though I believe it was a chicken Thai soup.  It was pretty good.  It had a spicy kick and was chock full of chicken and rice.  For my main, I went after the chicken cajun fettucine with a salad.  Now I'm really impressed.  The salad was fresh and dressed with a light vinegarette.  The fettucine was deceivingly filling, with chicken that was cooked through and still moist.  Yummy.
All in all it was a very good experience, and definitely a stop next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Kudos to a kitchen crew that can cook a good steak and are open a couple hours later than most Airdrie restaurants."}
{"text":"Food is delicious here. Service is fast and friendly. Not cheap, but good value for standard bar & grille fare. Lobster dip was good and the burgers are big and tasty."}
{"text":"Ate here three times in the last few years on the way back from skiing, every time the service is descent, the house beer is really good but the food just plain sucks, it's like frozen pre prepped, even the ribs taste like they're from a box, no dice, so if you're going for the beer, which by the way is really expensive, it's good but stay away from the food"}
{"text":"Delicious steak with a great atmosphere . Worth visiting while in the area. Clean with lots of friendly staff."}
{"text":"This is a fairly decent restaurant.  It offers up basically everything from steaks, to burgers to salads and sandwiches.  

Service was very good and the waitress knew the menu very well and was on her game all night so bonus points for that.

Kids (not the 12 and under) decided on the burger offerings and although generous in size, were underwhelmed by the crisped potato offering instead of fries and priced somewhat steep at about $16.

Steaks were also decent, not fantastic, found mine a bit on the tough side but that could have been that is was cooked way over the medium I asked for and was more like a medium well.  I didn't complain as it was still quite tasty -just taken a little over for me.  Underwhelming side veg though.  I think they were just steamed and lacked any real imagination and I love veggies and I kinda just picked on them throughout my dinner.

Dinner companion said the cajun rib eye ( I think!) was excellent but it is just too much meat for me.  All in all a solid 3.5/5.  Great family resto in Airdrie which will probably please everyone in a large group."}
