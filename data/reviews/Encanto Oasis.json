{"text":"If I could give this place 0/5 stars I would.  After renting for almost a year, we had to leave. 
The good things:  The apartment size and price are reasonable.  The location is good for us.  Other than that everything else is very bad.
The washing machine does not work and they charged my credit card for it many times.  Parking is very limited and they started checking for assigned parking space.  The management is terrible.  We could NEVER reach them by phone, web, email, in person... If something is broken, you have to fix it yourself.  We tried to contact them for over a month to tell them that we are moving somewhere else.  We could not reach them.  The voicemail was full.  The office never has anybody there.  The management doesn't communicate.  We could not get our deposit money back.  
Recommendation:  Stay away from this place.  Don't be tempted by the lower than average price.  It's not worth all the troubles you have to go through.  You don't want to deal with the management.  They just want to take your money and do nothing."}
{"text":"This apartment is a pleasant surprise  first the units  are very spacious and beautifully done on the inside  the patios are huge you can fit an entire patio set out there and still have space the kitchen.
