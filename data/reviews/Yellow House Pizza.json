{"text":"So I went in yesterday, and I went in a little hostile just cuz I feel bad for Damien, and I asked the new owner what happened... Respectfully he said he didn't know... He was obviously uncomfortable with my hostility but that's not the real me so I started more conversation to break the awkwardness after he placed my \"bigger than usual\" slice into the oven. I Asked how he heard of this place he said he heard from his business partner, whatever. He just came in, everything was ready to go except for he mentioned he had to do A LOT of cleaning. 20 years of experience in two different countries he had never seen a dirtier restaurant, and was confused as to how inspection let him pass.  Nice guy, the dough is a little thinner, less cheese and more pepperoni. Otherwise seemed like the same ingredients. I will definitely let him know about my opinion on how the pizza was made for the last 13 years I've been going there to help him out. Long live yellow pizza. -A.s"}
{"text":"No cheese, I went to the new yellow house pizza. Not sure of the new name. New owner. I ordered just a slice of Hawaiian. Got home and noticed no cheese on the slice. Maybe he forgot, but I doubt it. A friend was in there a few weeks back and said the same thing.  Maybe if you order a whole pie you might get some, but I won't be trying. Please let me know if anyone else notices."}
{"text":"We finally tried Yellow House Pizza after having driven past it for 5 years. It was certainly better the the chain pizzas. The crusty was crispy but not dry and the pizza itself was very tasty. The only disappointment is that this place doesn't offer unlimited toppings like Gino's Pizza down the street. However, this certainly become one of our go to places if we're craving pizza."}
