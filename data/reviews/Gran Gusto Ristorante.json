{"text":"Came here after a close friend recommended this place. Was even considering having my son's baptism, based on my friend's referral. Thank God my husband and I decided to come for date night, because after our experience at this restaurant we will never ever come back, and will not be having our son's baptism here. The service was pathetic, and the food was a let down. There are so many other italian restaurants in the area with exceptional food. The only positive experience that came out of going was the fact that we know never ever to host an event here."}
{"text":"Very down home - humble italian food.   Visited this restaurant with my big italian family. They are picky eaters, particularly about dishes they can easily make at home, like penne with meat sauce and veal parm.   However, this restaurant knocked it out of the park.   RE: Food -the calamari is amazing. Huge portion. The rings themselves are huge and the batter is not heavy.  -The kids had penne all a vodka - a staple at home. They loved it. A classic recipe done right. Just wish I knew how big the portions were. 1 plate would have been enough for two children under 10 years old. We ended up taking home a plate, but it warmed well the next day.  -lots of choice for pizza, I had the Americana with green peppers, mushrooms and pepperoni. So good! One of my guests had the bruschetta pizza  with melted bocconcino on the bottom. I would get that, looked light and fresh -spaghetti all chitarra  - a huge hit with the two guests who ordered it at my table. The sauce is very similar to what we would make at home. The pasta was fresh and cooked to perfection. huge portion!  RE: Service -attentive - no complaints   RE: Ambiance  -this is NOT a fine dining restaurant. It's more of a trattoria - a casual place where you can bring children"}
{"text":"Simply marvellous. Here's our take-out experience.  Service:  Fast, courteous, and friendly, both over the phone and in person. I was given options I never knew I had and it allowed us to have our meals prepared just the way we wanted.   Restaurant: We didn't dine-in, we couldn't, but could see it's a family restaurant, not overly classy but clean, cozy and quite nice. Great for families.  Food: Very good! The hand made pasta was excellent, great texture and flavour with a very home-style sauce that we loved so much. Calamari was good, crispy outside and soft inside, not rubbery at all, lovely dipping sauce. The star of the show was the pizza, it looked just as beautiful as it tasted, fine quality ingredients, thin crust, just the right amount of cheese, and tasty pizza sauce! The best part is, everything tasted perfect without being overly salty or overly greasy. Well done. I have to say the calamari portion is huge. Over the phone, when I was ordering, the gentleman asked me if I wanted the regular size or large calamari. I ordered just the regular, but what we got was a very generous helping that could have easily satisfied 3 or possibly 4 people as an appetizer. Thanks!  Bottom line: if you're in Woodbridge, and you want home-style Italian, go check out Gran Gusto.  We did not try any dessert so can't comment on that."}
{"text":"This place was amazing.  Went here for a late Valentine's Day dinner.  Pasta fagoli was to die for.  The girlfriend had Stracciatella soup and a pizza which didn't last long.  Chicken parm with penne pomodoro massive portion.  All in all, great bang for your buck!"}
{"text":"Great authentic Italian food! Large portions of pasta and salad which taste very home made. My only suggestion to the restaurant would be to upgrade their furniture and appearance. The place looks like a run down coffee time and it needs some Renos, even for a mid scale restaurant."}
{"text":"This is a premier little Italian eatery, which says a lot given it's rich competition in Woodbridge. The food is absolutely top quality, delicious, and plentiful."}
{"text":"First time here on Friday, March 3, 2017 with a friend. We were greeted by friendly staff. The vibe was great and as more people came, it felt more like home. Definitely some regulars at this restaurant. Sat near the entrance but there was more of a dining room area around the corner from where we sat. Decor could be updated but the food was undeniably good. We ordered the Tilapia dish and Napoli pizza. Good portion sizes. We would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"My experience:  Cozy atmosphere and a delicious meal.   Bookmarked.  Yelp asks me to write more so I would like to add a special thank you to the chef for a featured daily soup that I will most likely remember next time I am hungry."}
{"text":"Gran Gusto was a big let-down. I was ready to be wow-ed given some of the high praise I've read/heard about this place. And upon entering, my expectations rose even further as the first two things that greeted me were the sight of a large wood burning oven for the pizza, and the sound of people speaking in Italian. And so we eagerly sat down and ordered, and... were hugely disappointed. We got: - Arancini (rice balls) appetizer: These were nowhere near the great arancinis I've had in the past. This had too much rice and I couldn't even taste a hint of cheese. So while the bread crumb coating was fine (just the right amount of thickness), the inside was unflavourful. - Penne Alla Vodka: We got 2 pastas and between them, this was the one I preferred. Good cook on the noodles and the sauce had just enough of the vodka taste (though would have liked if it had been a bit stronger). There was supposed to be bacon on it but hardly tasted that as its flavour was drowned by the sauce. - Gnocchi Piemontese: This was labelled as home made pasta on the menu so was expecting much more. The potato flavour of the gnocchi didn't come through, the tomato sauce was bland, and the ground beef was non-existent.  -  Frittura Mista: A medley of fried seafood (calamari, shrimps, fillet of sole, cuttlefish) that was ok anf at least broke the monotony of the bland pastas. - Chocolate Fudge Cake: Gran Gusto said their cakes are fresh but this was definitely not the case here. The fudge had frozen hard and this tasted like it had been in the fridge for days.  Even if I had never read any of the previous reviews and bought into the hype, it's sad to say that Gran Gusto would be average at best. Lots of better Italian restaurants elsewhere in the city."}
{"text":"Great bowls of food. Classic Italian fair with a nice one pizza. No fancy dining here.  But great food and good service.  The place has great potential."}
{"text":"We ordered take out: crispy calamari, gnocchi and Quattro pizza.   It was so good. The calamari was crispy and the inside tender.  It was even better with dip although next time, I will ask for two dips with our order because one wasn't enough. It was put in a box with vents to keep it crispy. Gnocchi was homemade and better then what I tried to make from scratch at home.  They wrapped it in plastic saran so the sauce wouldn't leak in the car. The pizza was also pretty good with homemade pizza sauce.   They were kind enough to put our order in a box so our food wouldn't tip over in the car.  This is much better then a take out bag where all your food can cause a mess in the car when it shifts around.   I overall, highly recommend.  This isn't \"Eastside Mario\" but a real Italian restaurant serving great food. Definitley going back to try their other dishes."}
{"text":"This place seems like a family-owned restaurant. Located in Woodbridge near Weston and Highway7. It is a very quiet restaurant with an authentic family feel to it. They host private functions. A little bit on the pricier side. We ordered the Penne Alla Vodka, Mussels and Lucia pizza.  Mussels: tomato sauce was very flavourful, we put some of the house special oil into it which made it taste so much better  Penne Alla Vodka: pasta was cooked to perfection - al dante style, tomatoey creamy sauce was the right consistency and it tasted like maple bacon in the sauce which gave it a different taste that im normally used to in pastas   Lucia Pizza: cheesy and proscuitto not too salty like it normally is (wished there was more meat though) i like more meats on my pizza so we shouldve ordered something else   Overall it was a good experience, always nice to try something new when youre in the area"}
{"text":"Incredible service. Food was very nice. My friend had the chicken breast and it was moist and tender, I had a clam based pasta and it was very tasty. I would go back. Price is on the fair side. Great portions. You'll definitely be full. We also had their beer, which is some Italian name that starts with an M, but it was awesome."}
{"text":"The decor is nothing fancy, but the food is amazing. Real, delicious, authentic Italian food. They have a wood burning pizza oven, and their veal medallions are awesome."}
{"text":"The waiters said that its a really nice, Cozy place for Italian food and I felt the same way. Cozy, small place with awesome food. Pizza was really really delicious. Calamari was delicious and huge portion. I am definitely going back again! :) many choices in the menu and really good portion size. I would say, I found a gem in Woodbridge"}
