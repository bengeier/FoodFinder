{"text":"Super super good food at amazing price. Their empanadas is a must try !! Very authentic food and great service. The portions are big, so we split 2 entres and a main meal. We had as desert the 4 leches and it was amazing. Definitely recommend this place !!"}
{"text":"one word to describe this place 
HORRIBLE !
Waited more than 20 minutes for the food to be served, once me and my mom got our food the server forgot my dad's order,  after 45 minutes waiting my dad finally got his food BUT the FISH was still frozen. Disgusting service, and they still charge full price.

don't waste your time or money here !!

there are better Colombian places than this."}
{"text":"Personally I think Tardes Cale√±as is the best Colombian restaurant in the Montreal region: small, authentic, good Ingredients and price is affordable.

Being a Colombian is the best I've found so far, their empanadas are excellent! 

The restaurant itself is small with authentic Colombian decor, if you are a big group make sure you have a reservation. Will definitely  (already have) come back!"}
