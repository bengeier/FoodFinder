{"text":"Great little independent place. The owner is there most days and makes sure everything is to your liking. When in town I try to eat there a few times a month. I don't deviate on my choices but everything has been great and made to order quickly. They have beer by can or bottle if you want and a very diverse menu. Its hard not to find something you will like."}
{"text":"Authentic NY style (jersey) pizza.  Honestly the best in town.  It's a locally run business by the guy who moved here 20 years ago!  Thin slices made from whole wheat and fresh mozzarella. 

If you like this style of pizza then this is the best you will find.  Oh BTW the cheesesteaks rock!  Fresh bread, good steak, great flavor.  I got mine with the fresh diced hot peppers.  Just like you would find at the places in Jersey or Philly.

The owner and staff seemed really friendly.  Good experience."}
{"text":"HUGE fan of the food! Everything is really good here.  I do wish the atmosphere was a little trendier....it's such a great local place. HIGHLY recommend!"}
{"text":"Just stopped in for lunch and had an awesome Italian sub. Nice people, good food,good price. I will be back."}
{"text":"Joe Mamma's is a nice little place in the Food Lion shopping center on South Tryon.  I've eaten take out food from here a couple of times and eaten in as well.  They tend towards the greasier/heartier fare with a focus on Northeastern street cuisine like cheese steak sandwiches, pizza, and calzones.  Most recently I had a calzone and it was good.  It was very cheesy, slightly greasy, and came with a side of marinara.  I left satisfied!

There are also some salad and various sandwich options as well.  When you come in you order at the counter and they'll call your number when the order is ready.  They have a small sitting area near the front/kitchen and a more expansive dining area in an adjoining room - with booths and tables.  The staff is friendly enough, though they kind of have some Jersey brusqueness to them.

Expect to pay about $10 for a meal - most of the menu items are $8 or more.  With a drink it'll be more."}
{"text":"Really good, little Mediterranean place next to Pinky's nails in a strip mall. They do typical lunch stuff, gyros, pizza, calzones and salads. Always fresh and satisfying.  Order at the counter, pay, get a number and go sit in the dining room. They will bring it to you.  Self service soda, yay as much diet coke as I can drink!!  Grilled chicken salad was yummy, nothing fancy but delicious. Staff is efficient and nice (could be a family run business?).  Tables are clean, a little on the worn out side but nothing offensive. Great place to hide from the heat and not have fast food in Steele Creek area."}
{"text":"Great people, great pizza!  A bit more of a dive than Luigi's but the pizza just tastes better.  I get a single slice of cheese a couple of times per week.  Sprinkle a little Parmesan cheese on it, a bit of crushed red pepper, and a healthy amount of garlic, and then enjoy!"}
{"text":"Big fan!  The pizza is great and tasty and the garlic knots are excellent.  Delivery service is also timely and professional."}
{"text":"I order a 8 inch  hot veggie sub, side order fries and water.
When I got the sub I noticed that most of the sub was the bread. I still wanted to give it a chance and tried the sub. Well the sub was pretty grease to be hot grilled veggies with a light amount of cheese. The veggies were paper thin, really paper thin cut. I shared my thoughts with the owner or staff members and a woman told me to calm down. I wasn't yelling. I advised that the sub is basically bread. They advices that you didn't get meat so that's  the amount of veggies you get. Really my veggie sub is the same price as the meat subs. You would think they would pack the sub with veggies as they do with the meats. They also stated the this sub shop is New York style, wrong. I have visited New York and the food is always great and lots of it. Well as I left the woman yield something at me that i don't get. Well they don't like customer feed back. The price was $10.55 also this is my first time review."}
{"text":"I come here for lunch sometimes since I work nearby.

I try to eat healthy so I've only eaten their salads, but they never disappoint.  The grilled chicken tastes very fresh.

However, my coworkers frequently get subs from here and they always look and smell amazing."}
{"text":"I saw a sign outside the restaurant, it said (PHILLY CHEESE STEAK LUNCH SPECIAL $4.99)
The other sign says (Pizza by the slice $1.50).
I went in and ordered the Philly and she charged $9.99. I thought maybe it was a mistake but, she said the \"lunch special\" is a salad!!!! BAIT AND SWITCH!!! I should have left :/
 I ordered two slices of pizza and was charged $5.00, when I asked why, she said its only $1.50 after 5Pm. Again BAIT AND SWITCH. The very fine print on the sign says \"after 5\". Why didn't I leave?!!!!  The Lady, may I add just walked in with me from outside, never washed her hands was angry because I questioned the price.  I saw a picture near the register it was hamburger and fries, I ordered it add bacon. Then because all of the bait and switch I asked if the burger I ordered looked anything like the picture. She said and I quote what you see in the picture is different from what I see.   

The food: burger dry, bun stale,  no mayo, pizza ok and Philly just ok.
They tried to charge me for Mayo!!!!
NEVER GOING BACK!! Waisted my money!!!!"}
{"text":"Let me tell you something, I've been eating here for years! And never have I experienced this type of service from this restaurant first off $18.00 min for Delivery is a rip off, and the owner is a GIANT PRICK I called to place and order for delivery and I asked what else I could possibly get to make my order an $18.00 min. He yelled and said \" I DONT KNOW WHAT YOU WANT\" I immediately hung up the phone and called back and asked him what was his issue he repeatedly hung up on me. My wife then called from her office in NYC to ask what the problem was and he disrespected her as well. Don't spend your money here the owner is rude and disgusting."}
{"text":"Really cool staff and their specials are pretty reasonable. Never had more than pizza and subs from them and each time were great."}
{"text":"Smaller portions and food is pretty bland.  We got a calzone and chicken cheesesteak.  Just not very tasty!"}
{"text":"We ordered bacon cheese burger, chicken philly and chilli cheese fries. Everything was super delicious the chilli cheese fries are to die for. Wasn't expecting the to taste good but was very surprised of how good it was."}
{"text":"This is my third time eating at Joe Mommas, so I think I can be truly fair in my review now.
 The first time was a few years ago when we first moved to The steele Creek area. The food was great in my opinion. I had a meatball sandwich and my wife at a steak salad that she loved. 
 The second time was a miss. I went back for the great meatball sub, which was subpar no pun intended. I also had a couple slices of pizza, which were nothing to call him about. And my wife had the same steak salad. but she enjoyed again. 
 Today I think will be my final trip to Joe Mama's. because the pizza was not good. Maybe worthy of $1 slice special, but not for $2.50. The meatball sub was just OK. Seems like the quality of the food has just gone downhill since my first visit."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if they're working on changing their name because the sign in the front is \"Joe Mama's\" but the menus and all the interior signage is \"Joe Momma's\". Odd, but I guess we'll see.

I opted for the 8 inch cheesesteak with onions and that's what was brought to me a little later. It had the right texture and the right taste, but yeah, I'm going to have to throw a flag on the play for the yellow American cheese.

Otherwise, it was A-OK."}
{"text":"So i have been going to joe mommas for months since i work right up the block. personally i love their \"big ass\" chilli cheese fries and their steak and cheese is to die for. I stick to what i know here and just order that. they never get it wrong. sometimes a salad to switch it out but nothing too fancy. i love their bread its fantastic and made in house i believe. i was craving their bread and decided to stop by and ask for a side of like 4 pieces of bread. (this is not a menu item). I called first and they said its no problem they would accommodate.

 I strolled up there this afternoon and tried to pay with my card when the guy at the counter said it would be a dollar. a dollar for these 4 pieces of bread. Their fairly large bigger than biscuits i'd definitely.say. But when i asked if there was a minimum for card he said $5. Then he looks at me and says just go and enjoy them. 

I looked perplexed like \"huh\"? Free.... Is he serious. and i thanked him over and over. Before making my exit. Joe mommas deserves 4 stars alone for the food i have tried there. They earned an extra star today for excellent customer service. Go here!!"}
{"text":"Tasty pizza, yummy garlic knots, fantastic chili cheese fries, and a pretty killer stromboli - what's not to love about Joe Mama's?  And they deliver too?  Oh heck yeah!

I'm a little embarrassed to confess how many times I've ordered from Joe Mama's this month, but they have some pretty good grub.  Their pizza is pretty good - a decently thick crust that doesn't fall apart in the middle, good sauce that is not overly sweet, and a good amount of toppings.  The garlic knots are buttery, soft, and have plenty of garlic.  I like the chili on the chili cheese fries.  It's pretty mikd but smoky - I really like the spices they use (the fries are typical crinkle cut and pretty standard).  Their stromboli is probably my favorite thing and I really like it with pepperoni.  It's a flaky crust with a ton of cheese and pepperoni inside. 

I have not ever dined in, so I can't speak to the interior.  However, we have gotten it delivered and ordered carry-out and it's been ready to go fairly quickly.  On a Saturday night we got it delivered in less than 45 minutes and everything was still hot and tasty.

Joe Mama's is definitely my go-to pizza delivery, stromboli, and chili cheese fry place."}
{"text":"Love love love this place. Best cheesesteaks in Charlotte coming from a life long Long Island, NY native."}
{"text":"Well its been a long time since I last ate at Joe mama's. Kind of soured on their decline in pizza quality at the time. 

BUT HAPPY TO SAY they are back!   It was good NY Style pizza this time around. Just like they used to make it when I first tried their food. I am glad they got back to the basics and started making good pie again."}
{"text":"Best pizza I have had in a long time!!! Service is always great. I love the ny style pizza and the cheese steak sandwhiches as well. They also mls homemade ranch like you find in the north. We have only lived here for 3 months and this is our go to place for a quick bite or pizza! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The food is not bad but the wait staff is not the best. They also charge you for extra ranch dressing if you want some to have for your pizza which is very unheard of. I admit I almost walked out till my food was brought out finally from complaining a few times."}
{"text":"Came here last night after hearing about it from a few people. I can't say I have the same raving review they gave. The pizza was just pizza. Nothin special. Standard size slice. I just find it ehhh. They are friendly so that's a plus."}
{"text":"Fantastic people and great food. Terrific for a sandwich, soup, salad or slice of pizza. We use them regularly for lunch and dinner catering for our business. A real pleasure to be at and eat at this family owned business."}
{"text":"Great pizza and convenience is exceptional near my workplace and the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Great spot for lunch! A huge selection to choose from & great deals! These guys are quick and the food is delicious!

Best tip about this place: the store-front looks small, but they have a big area with tables and seats inside."}
{"text":"We got a flyer on our door a couple of days ago. All the times I've driven past this place, there has never seemed to be a large crowd in there so I always assumed the worst and maybe I was right because apparently it's \"Under New Management\" now. I finally succumbed to the picture of chilli cheese fries and went there yesterday to try it out. It wasn't teeming with people probably because it was close to shutting down. I got the chili cheese fries and a slice of pizza, still don't know what type of pizza it was. The lady in there was very friendly and conversational (got my stuff to go), unlike some of that customer service you get at some of these places nearby. The food is very reasonably priced, I paid less than $10 for something I would expect to pay $15 at a chain restaurant. The full size pizza prices seemed a bit high but after tasting the one slice which I bought, I would pay that in an instant. THIS IS THE BEST PIZZA I\"VE EVER HAD IN MY WHOLE LIFE!!! I thought Dominos had transformed the pizza industry with their new crust but I guess that's probably because I had never tasted the real thing. I guess it's like comparing a Whopper to a Bobby Flay burger, try it once and you'll understand what I mean!"}
{"text":"Philly cheesesteak was made with American cheese, that was the first no-go. The size was small and not worth the $6+ since that's all I ordered was a sub. Also there are plenty of \"specials\" posted inside but EVERY order (varying one from the next) some how summed up to $9.99. That in itself was a bit odd. There's room for improvement for sure. 

I'm rarely on this side of town but shall I find myself over this way again... I doubt I would pay another visit."}
