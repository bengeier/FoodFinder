{"text":"First of all, this restaurant is small and waiter didn't explains to us since everything is in French and I'm from Boston. We just order from what the waiter put down for us. I ordered Steaks and pasta since he said should be good for 2 Adults and 2 Kids. The bill came out $148 I order Steaks on for his suggestion $50.00 on board but somehow he put down $100 steaks. Plus we waited for the food to arrived at 45 minutes. I would defintely not going back ever gain. Bad service and rip off prices."}
{"text":"Always a consistent and delicious meal. Definitely great for meat lovers, but once had an amazing salad with burrata here too."}
{"text":"I had a great brunch here.  Make a reservation since the place is pretty small.  One of the best brunches I've had in Montreal"}
{"text":"Le Chien Fumant? Rien à dire, si ce n'est que j'y retournerais. Et plusieurs fois. Et surtout le mardi ou le mercredi, pour leur menu degustation à 30$, qui en plus d'être intéressant financièrement, ôte toute pression de devoir faire un choix. Faîtes confiance au chef et laissez vous guidez. * Chaleureux et intime * Belle liste de vin * Parfait pour une date avec sa blonde * Bar original (levez les yeux, les bouteilles volent) * Penser à réserver"}
{"text":"Food = great ambiance = great  service = my very worst experience of all time Cocky Waiter told us we could have wine by the glass but left the bottle on table after opening it up ripping the bottle rim like it was giaconda trash, then kept serving it to us until I told him that we had agreed to just have a glass.  He literally called me dude, man and said: come on man, I leave you the bottle and you know what that means...I replied no and was honest. He insulted me repetitively calling me (man) with a condescending posture like I was some guy transacting in the street.   I honestly will never return to this place as it tells me that restaurant is willing to risk all it's effort and reputation and hire some off the street disrespectful idiots."}
{"text":"Our visit on a quiet Sunday night did not quite meet expectations. We were one of about 4 tables, so the joint wasn't quite jumping.  Between our party of 4, we had the famous Chinatown Calamari, which is the only item permanently on the menu, zucchini flowers and lobster in grape leaves for apps.  Mains: ribs & scallops, turbot dieppoise.  The calamari was good, overly sweet and the zucchini was good, if a little heavy on the bread stuffing.  We all agreed, the lobster in grape leaves was a fail.  The  mains were both well executed if not especially stellar and unfortunately the Korean ribs were sold out.  It's not that we didn't enjoy the meal; as a neighborhood resto, it's very good but given it's out of the way for a lot of folks and tourists almost certainly, it may not be worth the trip.  The service was good and I can imagine when busy, it could be a fun place."}
{"text":"L'ambiance raffiné sur le coin d'une petite rue. On a commandé plusieurs plats pour partager."}
{"text":"was supposed to go here for a date, my date canceled so i took a friend...  we went on sunday night, i heard about this place from a friend of mine who wanted to try it, at the time i read about it, but thought it was a bit iffy... so i told her well i'm not too keen on it...  we were there at 6pm on sunday and we were the only ones, for over an hour... maybe it was unsusual cuz i usually hear that it's packed... it's an open kitchen place like salle a manger and pied de cochon, but much smaller, and darker.  i had the gnocchi, my friend had the chinatown calamari... hands down the calamari was the best dish of the night... it was light and crispy and well accompanied, with a nice sauce, the gnocchi was well made, but just too mushy for my taste... i heard mushy was good for gnocchi, but this one kind of fell apart on the plate.  i had the rack of lamb and my friend had the ravioli for our main dishes. this is where it all went to shit. The ravioli was bad, bad texture bad taste, just bad, can't save that one, i make better raviolis....  rack of lamb was a big mess with sauce and all kinds of things... i was hoping for a nice rack with a crispy crust cuz that's what i was craving, instead it had more of a stewed consistency, and it did not taste too great...  we skipped dessert because the portions are big here... didn't have room for dessert...   all in all, the calamari will bring me back, but i'll be trying something else and hopefully i'll find a good main dish here yet...  The staff were very friendly and the place is welcoming, i like the atmostphere here."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of this small, cozy restaurant just south of St. Joseph. I took a friend there and we both had the korean short ribs, which were made to perfection with an excellent kimchi side.  The food was perfect, but I was loved the atmosphere and am excited to go back."}
{"text":"I feel like I'm in Brooklyn when I have boozy brunch at Le Chien Fumant.  Yummy Caesars.  They have an ever-changing menu for brunch, which keeps it interesting but can also be frustrating if you have something so amazing you go back wanting it again but find it's not on the menu.   The first time I went I had melt in your mouth blueberry crepes with a dollop of lemon curd. The second time I had melt in your mouth trout gravlax with fresh greens.  Yesterday I had 2 eggs cooked in a ragu sauce with a parmesan crisp, pesto and soft charcoaled bread. divine.  about $ 50-60 for 2 people for brunch.    I went for dinner only once, and I wouldn't go back.  Brunch is a better bet."}
{"text":"Menu très créatif. Les portions sont généreuses. Le service est bon et l'endroit petit mais chaleureux. Essayez le tartare de boeuf style coréen, en entrée. C'est délicieux. Bon choix de cocktails."}
{"text":"Depuis que j'ai mon blog (la boufferie), je fais beaucoup de recherches sur les endroits intéressants à Montréal. Le chien fumant revenait souvent. J'y suis allée il y a peu de temps et wow!  Je suis tombée amoureuse de ce restaurant! Une allure de bar, peu de places et tellement de saveurs. On sent tout de suite la passion des cuisiniers dans nos assiettes."}
{"text":"A true gem of Montreal. Passion for food and drink is evident, and each time we are here becomes a celebration, even with no occasion! The charcuterie boards highlight Canadian delicacies and we love to bring visiting friends to sample local or made-in-house specialties. Definitely a menu for meat lovers, try the tartare and steak. For a vegetarian dish, I recommend the 'halloumi cheese, cruncy salad, dates & tahini' We have yet to try their famous brunch, but will be back without a doubt! The classic and experimental cocktails are also lovely, and this is a very sexy place to sit at the bar solo, and sip something strong while the world goes by. Their website describes them as being ideal for \"restauranteurs, nightowls, curious and 'bon vivants' that never say no to a surprising dish.\" I would agree wholeheartedly; bring your curious side and you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Went there for brunch and totally loved the decor and the food! excellent! It's a pretty small place, so be sure to get there early for brunch!"}
{"text":"Despite reading recent negative reviews, I decided to finally try out Le Chien Fumant against my better judgement. What struck me first was that it was empty for Sunday brunch. Brunch in Montreal is usually synonymous with long lines and high volume. One table of customers was being served while the rest of the staff awkwardly loitered at the bar. When we were ready to order, I asked if my eggs can be done \"over easy\", to which the waitress responded that they are done sunny side up. Confused, I asked whether the chef can flip the spatula and turn over the egg, to create an over easy egg. The waitress came back and said that the restaurant \"does not have the equipment\" to do my eggs over easy (sarcasm noted). Meanwhile, an unshaven and disheveled-looking manager and kitchen staff at the bar stared at our table, smirking, and seemed to enjoy watching our confused reaction. It was very awkward and we felt like we were being attacked. Needless to say, we walked out after the snide remark from our server, as we have never been treated so rudely in a restaurant setting. Nobody stopped us from leaving nor apologized.   I understand a chef that does not want to change his cooking method, but I will never condone the staff of a restaurant treating patrons with sarcasm and disrespect. An establishment that is this small, empty, and off the beaten path should be very weary of letting a customer walk out with such a bad taste in their mouth. You've received an onslaught of negative reviews recently (particularly for service), and it is now blatantly obvious why. Word of mouth is a POWERFUL THING, and we will make sure to do our utmost to dissuade family, friends, and colleagues from funding your unmerited arrogance.   As a Montrealer and food lover, I can easily say this was the worst restaurant experience in my own city."}
{"text":"When people from restaurants recommend this place and actually go here to eat themselves, you know you've found a gem! Do yourself a favor and sit at the bar, salivating at the dishes being prepared in front of your eyes. The beef tartar was amazing and so was the chinatown calamari (served with salad greens FYI) but the pork belly fried pita/taco thing.... I could have married the chef, Maks, over that one! HMOG!"}
{"text":"Recently tried this place out for the first time. I enjoyed it, it's definitely a nice small \"unique\" restaurant. Went there with my girlfriend, we shared the chinatown calamari (very good, a different twist on the typical calamari entrees). We both got the pork, (the menu is written on a chalkboard, so it always varies). The food was good but the plate was definitely very small.  We then shared a brownie desert which was very big and really tasty. Overall I would recommend this place, not too expensive and definitely a cool ambiance. I also noticed there is no information on what to expect price wise anywhere onlime ( their website menu does not post prices, and since the menu is on a chalk board we cannot know what to expect, so to help you het an idea I will give you the prices of what we ordered: - calamari entree 16$ - main dish (pork woth octopus) 30$ - brownie dessert 11$ Hope that gives you an idea, the main dishes range from 20 to 40$"}
{"text":"Ordered the waffle with fried chicken which was Incredible!!!! for 30$ it was very reasonable priced especially since it included a dessert and a mamosa and a little amazing appetizer...."}
{"text":"J'y suis toujours allée des samedis soirs, et nous avons toujours eu la même serveuse dont je ne me rappelle jamais le nom. Mais elle fait chaque fois de notre expérience un pur voyage gastronomique. Je lui fait désormais confiance aveuglément lorsque vient le temps d'accompagner nos repas de vins et elle ne s'est jamais trompée. Toujours ravie de revoir ses habitués et visiblement aime son travail. Oh, et la bouffe est à tomber par terre aussi !"}
{"text":"W O W. Recommended to us by our bartender at Dieu du Ciel for a solid late night; said this is where the industry eats, hence, good sign. A simple asparagus app blew our minds. Beautifully seasoned cornish hen and potato entree, followed by a choco tarte. Perfection! If you don't love this place, afraid I cannot trust your opinions. :)"}
{"text":"I confess, I'm totally bias when it comes to this place. Love everything about it. Wednesday is my fave...but then again, I Always preferred going out on Wednesdays.   Entrees: Korean Beef Tartare + Chinatown Squid = heaven.   Main: Cavatelli veal shank, Greek yogurt, Lemon confit + Hanger Steak, mash, Provençale Tomatoes  = Devine, we could not finish...  Desserts: Classic Queen Elisabeth Cake with Home Made Vanilla ice cream + Lime Pie, coconut, marshmallow and chocolate- coconut syrup = my date needed a moment to gather herself, let's leave it at that.   Champagne and wine kept us company throughout the nite. There are many restaurants in Mtl...but only a few good ones. Le Chien is part of my top 5."}
{"text":"I got to say that I'm biased.  I've been to this place a couple of times and always enjoyed it very much.  It's very small, very cozy and you would most likely never stumble upon it unless you know exactly where you're going.  A typical \"bistro de quartier\" but with a great, ever changing menu.  Also have very nice unique mixology drinks.  I'll keep coming back!"}
{"text":"So our friends who live in Montreal made a reservation here for the four of us on a Saturday night and it definitely did not dissapoint. Restaurant was tiny and only had 3 tables which could accomodate more than 2 people.  They had several two-tops. Our firends had been to the restaurant only one time previously and enjoyed it (obviously).  Living in DC with some of the best restaurants and variety of cuisines, we are always slightly cautious about what people think is good.  We ordered some drinks, the smoked meat appetizer, and discussed our dinner options.  We decided to do the \"small\" tasting menu.    We ended up getting four appetizers and four entrees which were SUPERB!!!  The amount and quality of the food for the \"small\" tasting menu was overwhelming. Every one of the dishes was delicious, had interesting flavors, textures, and was cooked to perfection.  I generally dont like lamb and my wife does not generally like any fish, but we both loved the lamb dish (one app & one entree) and the halibut entree dish.  My favorite dish was the korean bbq tartare which was awesome.    I wish that they had some more wines which were under $50 a bottle.  We ordered one of the cheapest bottles and it was still $57.  With the four of us we ended up spending quite a bit in wine.  Also, they did not have any wines by the glass so you either had a whole bottle or drank cocktails.    Probably one of the best meals which I have ever had and definitely in the top 3 or 5 of all time."}
{"text":"Le Chien Fumant -can- be mind-blowing.  This is a small (let's not say tiny) restaurant at the corner of Gilford and De Lanaudière. They offer an early and late service; customers are the expected to only attend one of them to allow new patrons to come in. This can be off-putting for slow diners and people who like to talk a lot.  The strength of the establishment is its menu. The chefs of Le Chien Fumant make much of their ingredients in-house, and the dining menu--written by hand on a blackboard--is frequently refreshed according to the seasonal availability of fresh items. You would have to go every day of the week before you could possibly have the same dining experience twice.  The arrangement of the restaurant is fair and attractive, but can create some snags. During the winter, tables near the exit are subjected to cold air with some consistency, and all year long customers will have to deal with a somewhat cramped space and only one restroom.   This is a minor inconvenience if you dedicate yourself to the tasting experience, however. Meals are always exotic but accessible, and diners are invited to discuss their tastes and adventurous leanings with the staff and chefs to take smart decisions about what to put in their mouths.   Provided you are ready to trust the presentation, you will be rewarded with a fine foodie experience. The chefs of Le Chien Fumant have laid in front of me plates in which I recognized nothing edible, and plates in which I immediately identified everything I hate. In both cases it was stupidly delicious and eatable.  This is evidently not a cheap place. Le Chien Fumant bets on quality and all of their items are priced above casual dining averages. It's worth it to reserve and plan in advance so that you do not end up ordering the dish you can afford instead of the one you really want. The same can be said about the cocktail and wine list: very good, but somewhat pricey.   That being said, I can only give Le Chien Fumant a warm recommendation. It would be best to bring along a friend with foodie leanings to discuss the presentation and texture of meals, but regardless of background or tastes, Le Chien Fumant offers a decidedly above-par dining experience."}
{"text":"Great service, amazing food , extensive wine selection, should I say more? We are from LA and this was recommended by locals, and for sure did not disappoint - big plus - the place is open late!"}
{"text":"Awesome brunch, very very tasty, master chef pay attentions to the details of every ingredient..staff is friendly with a sense of humor and my friends and I were impressed they actually been to NJ where we hail from albeit they visited the crap hole known as Atlantic City when they were there. Food was impeccable and I'll be back next time I make the trip up north."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant gastronomique ! Le plus raffiné de tous ceux que j'ai testé à Montréal. Service parfait, grosse carte des vins, rien a redire, seul tout petit bémol : la température était un peu trop haute."}
{"text":"Super place pour le brunch, endroit très agréable et chaleureux Par contre, c'est petit, le mieux est de réserver (ils prennent les réservations!) pour être sûr d'avoir une place.. Choix original de brunchs, tous les plats avaient l'air très bons.. J'ai été un peu déçue des ufs en mollet qui n'étaient pas très copieux, j'avais encore faim après.. du coup, j'ai pris le pain brioché, qui vient tout chaud, en 2 grosses tranches avec un beurre parfumé, pour 3$ seulement Le service était très bon, seule une serveuse n'était pas très aimable, mais pour le reste du staff rien à dire Je recommande vivement!"}
{"text":"The best in Montreal culinary clichés with Lovely twists ! & the cocktails the best .  Also the decorum is perfect for a date  night"}
{"text":"La salade de tomates est excellentes"}
{"text":"This was a fantastic meal. The cocktails were excellent, the wine selection was modest, but of excellent quality, and the food was delicious.   The steamed buns were quite tasty, and the hoisin-heavy dipping sauce with them really made the dish sing.  The veal sweetbread paprikash was revelatory. The sweetbreads were perfectly cooked, and the sauce was velvety and unctuous.  I highly recommend this restaurant. It was one of the more memorable meals I've had in the past year."}
{"text":"Went to have brunch there past Sunday with my friend. The food left us speechless. We ordered breakfast enchilada with pork and homemade pancakes with strawberries to share and both plates turned to be delicious. They also have a great coffee-inspired cocktail list for those who feel like having a drink. I definitely recommend this place to everyone who cares about great food & superb service."}
{"text":"First-time for me, and I will definitely come back for another meal. A mixed of old and new combining classic meats with super fresh ingredients.  The service is rapid as the restaurant is very small and intimate.  Tried baby backs (boneless) accompanied with fresh and crispy vegetables.  Had to go for a throwback and went with a long Island iced tea to top it all off.  Food food, food service, if you're around the plateau area a must go on your list"}
{"text":"I had a good time at this off the beaten path Restaurant.  I came early and sat at the bar without a reservation.  The waitstaff was very friendly and spoke about the entree, apps, and cocktails.  My meal was excellent and unique enough to satisfy different tastes.  It was a little pricey in my opinion, especially for the out of the way location.  But I'd go back and enjoy another meal when I visit Montreal."}
{"text":"Beaucoup de potentiel ici. Je n'ai eu l'occasion d'y aller qu'une seule fois, en fin de soirée. Moi et mon amie étions installées au bar, donc le service fut très rapide. Avant de commencer notre repas, on nous apporte deux ÉNORMES tranches de pain maison. Délicieux, mais si grosse que j'avais peur de ne pas avoir assez faim pour le reste! Notre entrée de calmars frits était parfaite, mon highlight de la soirée. Par contre j'avoue avoir été très déçue par mon sandwich Schnitzel; la viande était caoutchouteuse et dure à mâcher, et ça a tellement gâché le sandwich que je l'ai pas terminé. Les frites étaient A+ par contre. Les cocktails étaient aussi excellent, mais très petit pour leur prix exorbitant. En gros, je donnerai volontiers une autre chance a ce charmant établissement, surtout pour leur brunch(!) et pour un second souper. Peut être que ça me fera changer d'avis, mais pour l'instant je trouve que c'est trop cher pour trop de flafla."}
{"text":"Brunch was the goal. I'm not really sure what I left with. I was full, but I would hardly call anything they had on the menu as brunch. The food was average. The prices were a little on the high side. I did have an incredible coffee!  Here's the problem in having a bathroom in the middle of the dinning room... when one coffee drinking patron went in for evacuation everyone HAD to smell it. Ouuffff.... Luckily I had paid but was on my way out. Not cool."}
{"text":"This was the PERFECT Valentine's Day dinner spot. Amazing steaks. The atmosphere is warm, hip, small & cozy and the menu is definitely gourmet and specialty. Service was impeccable, too. Tucked away off the busy street on charming Gilford, it's the best little romantic retreat. I can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"Review is most helpful for tourists, not for locals.   As a tourist, I heard about this place from someone on the DC metro who overheard us talking about going to Montreal. The food was overpriced (waaaaaaaay overpriced) and so were the drinks. Overall, though, the service was really pleasant and our server helped us pick something off the menu (we understood almost nothing).   The ambience is amaaaaazing. Really great place, hole in the wall, but with personality. Also, a guy sitting at the bar got so drunk that he fell off his seat and backwards INTO someone else's table. It was a great way to start our debaucheries is Montreal."}
{"text":"It small place with great dishes. I would suggest you ask for the chefs selection, that would change  each time, and will give you a taste of their great food. Note that their portions are not generous, however they're delicious and their service is polite and professional."}
{"text":"We went to Chien Fumant on Wednesday. Three business women, one of us who has been going there for years. We had been warned that we had the table for two hours only, and the reservation desk had asked for a credit card number to hold the table which was quite unusual for a neighborhood bistro and only three guests. We sat and the waitress recommended the tasting menu. For 30$ each, the chef was to select plates and courses. We decided to go for it. We wanted to order a bottle of wine but the waitress insisted that we tried their cocktails. We did. She brought our drinks and before we could taste them, she brought all the food, probably 5 plates. We asked her to slow down the pace and let us have our drinks, that we wanted wine with our food. In no time the chef was at our table, asking us to leave not to complain in front of other guests. It happened so fast we were completely floored and in disbelief. But we left. It was the first time anything like this happened to me. I think this chef needs a serious break. Behavior like this is enough to sink a business in no time."}
{"text":"Friends of mine took me to Le Chien on a recent trip to Montreal and boy am I pleased to friends with such great taste!  Le Chien Fumant is a compact and packed little space with a daily fresh board offering perfectly prepared plates and entrees. Portions are generous so consider sharing. We had a Chinatown Calamari salad - superb - and shared half a roast chicken complete with mashed potatoes and peas. Wow, simple yet divine.      Also come prepared to wait OR make a reservation. And order a cocktail, their drinks are creative and well executed."}
{"text":"We came here on recommendations and I have to agree with the other comments, this place is awesome!  The atmosphere: She really loved the setting of this place, it's nestled in a neighborhood like it was a little corner store. The atmosphere in the place is great, there's a bar central to the main seating area where you can see the cooks at work. The other seating is by the window where you can look out onto the neighborhood. Very romantic setting, 10/10.  The food: we started off with the beef tar tar which was excellent! It was a Korean style plate with kimchi and an egg, very creative. For entree I had the lamb and she had the pasta. The lamb was served as an Ethiopian dish with collard green and beans served on a pancake. For creativity alone I was very impressed! The meat was tender and the sides flavorful. The pancake wasn't really that close to an Ethiopian Injera but it was good, more like Aunt Jemima ;) her dish was very good as well, the only issue was it was so tiny (look at the picture, mine was literally 4-5x larger!). She did order the smaller size but the difference between the small and large were just too much. And the price wasn't that different.  Overall we were both really impressed! The only downside and the reason I can't give it 5 stars was the pricing. While the food was great the prices are too high. The quality was good but our dinner was over $100. Otherwise, the waitstaff were excellent and very friendly, we both highly recommend the place!"}
{"text":"Que dire ? J'y retournerais tous les jours si je le pouvais. J'ai adoré l'endroit, son long bar et sa cuisine ouverte, son atmosphère de pub-bistro à la fois chaleureuse et décontractée, et puis la bouffe...tout est absolument délicieux, quoique parfois trop salé. Et puis un établissement de cette qualité ouvert aussi tard, c'est une bénédiction. Très belle carte des vins et un très bon choix au verre, service irréprochable"}
{"text":"We celebrated our first wedding anniversary with dinner here this past Saturday. We usually stay in the Plateau when we visit Montreal, and my husband had noticed this restaurant several years ago and always wanted to eat here.  It's a tiny, lively restaurant with an open kitchen and maybe 10 tables plus bar. The food was a knockout win-win for us - everything was incredibly rich but not excessively so. Highlights for me were the chanterelle appetizer and the tagliatelle with lobster in a rich lemon beurre blanc. My husband loved the entrecôte soaked in butter topped with rich escargots confit."}
{"text":"Les rumeurs sont vraies : le chien fumant est incroyable !  Nous y sommes allé un dimanche soir d'été, et le redtaurant n'était pas complètement bondé. Nous avons commandé un tartare de boeuf corréen en entrée (dont les morceaux étaient gros et savoureux), ainsi que le steak pour plat principal. La viande fondait dans la bouche , avec une acidité parfaite. Les plats sont arrivés TRÈS rapidement. Le service était courtois et agréable, mais j'aurais aimé légèrement plus personnel pour un endroit si petit dont la clientèle semble être composée majoritairement d'habitués. Bref, un resto de quartier incroyable , si vous avez les moyens . À retourner !"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. Cute little corner restaurant in a very French neighborhood. The veal chop was a top 10 meal I've had in my life."}
{"text":"Le Chien Fumant is a bit out the of the way, reservations are a serious consideration given its teensy tiny size, and it is a tad pricey considering brunch for two cost close to $50 without any of their signature cocktails added to the bill and before a tip was added in, but these are just trivial worries when you factor in the flavors, freshness, quality, and the uniqueness of the dishes offered here.  Everything is homemade, from the English muffins used in their lobster Florentine Benedict, to the cured meats and sausages they serve up during the day. Who does that anymore?   The food offerings are as unconventional as this restaurant's decor that welcomes you with a giant poster of the 1957 B-movie classic \"Attack of the Crab Monsters\" at the front door, features Wild Wild West flourishes straight out of a Frontier Town bar, and places 8\" religious candles on each table in place of the typical tea lights one might find elsewhere.   Their ever-changing yet playful menu was the impetus for this first visit. I've checked out their website often over the last few months, just to see what was on the menu after hearing about this place, and have been teased with dishes like rabbit done gumbo style and pork belly served up as a doner kebab.     Their brunch menu this past weekend was no less eclectic. While you could order some \"basics\" like ham and pineapple, or eggs served with homemade country sausage and biscuits (Biscuits? Real Southern-style biscuits in Quebec?), I indulged in two quivering chunks of boudin (blood sausage) served atop an apple waffle that was accompanied by a frisée salad with lardons and two perfectly poached eggs.   Worth the trip and spending a good 45 minutes on public transportation and a 15 minute walk under dark, ready-to-burst, cloudy skies to get there? Oh yes, yes, yes.  Worth making a reservation even though a credit card was needed to secure it? Fine by me and perfectly understandable given its limited seating.  Worth the cost? Hell yes, especially when you factor in their choice ingredients and how they handle them, the attentive service, and the fact I've only seen breakfast and brunch items this creative in Las Vegas.   Worth a return visit? Already booked."}
{"text":"Dinner experience here was the highlight of my Montreal trip! The waitor was super friendly and could speak both French and English. I had the duck confit and mt husband had their rib eye. Both were wonderful. This restaurant bar is tucked away from the main streets so it made our experience more authentic in some ways. Definitely would recommend!"}
{"text":"Dinner here was amazing! I learned of the place thru the travel magazine AFAR and I'm so glad we went. It's outside the touristy neighborhoods so I loved the very local vibe and the fact that the menu was only in French. The staff were all very nice and helpful so we had no problem ordering.   We had the mushroom puff pastry appetizer (5 stars!) which was so delicious. The mushrooms tasted so fresh and aromatic. It was a very flavorful dish. We also had the oxtail stew (4.5 stars). It was hearty but not heavy and the use of different textures made it delightful. Then we had the duck with cherry sauce with lentils and green beans (4.5 stars). Also delicious. The meat was tender and moist and the accompanying lentils and beans made it a very satisfying dish. For dessert I had the strawberry bavarois (4.5 stars) which was very yummy and light but the portion size was too much.   Since we were sitting at the bar we watched as the chef prepared the dishes and so many other things looked amazing. There was the carpaccio and bone marrow plate that looked amazing, the escargot, and the rib steak for two that looked divine! I wish I could go back! Interestingly the experience made me think of M. Wells in NY not just because M. Wells was a Québécois diner but also because the dishes there were all exciting, unpredictable, and bursting with flavors. That's exactly how Le Chien is.   The restaurant is very small so I highly suggest you call for a reservation. And the menu changes often which only makes the place even more likable. The wine list is excellent but their cocktails are also very good. I had the boulevardier and I enjoyed it very much. I was also surprised how reasonable the prices were. Dinner like this in NY would easily cost a lot more. Especially considering the generous servings.   This definitely made our visit to Montreal memorable. I would go back again if I'm ever in Montreal again."}
{"text":"Love the decor dislike everything else. I love good service, I tip well when it is deserved.... Almost to excess. However I can tell you that there was absolutely nothing to tip over at Le Chien Fumant. The food was not very impressive and the wait staff were dreadful, rude and un helpful. It would have left a bad taste in my mouth if the food hadn't been so salty that my mouth shriveled up. Overall unpleasant.... And I am a glass half full kind of person!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The atmosphere in a little neighborhood restaurant is captured here so perfectly. The bar well hanging above their heads, pots and pans too. The house Tonic & Gin is great. Had the 4 course tasting for 30$ what a steal!!!  Everything was seasoned well, cooked proper and had a unique twist. I am definitely coming back before my stay ends in Montreal!"}
{"text":"The rating is based my dish and preference. My party made a reservation a couple hours before hand, it wasnt that busy and the crowd was extremely friendly. My party shared the Korean Steak Tartare, which was so balanced in flavors and well seasoned. I ordered the Duck Confit which was phenomenal. It was fried so it had a crispy outside and the vegetables surrounding it were so fresh. My mother ordered the seabass which was just as good, a little salty for her tastes, but tasty none  the less.  When we went there the staff did not speak English very well, but we were able to get our points across and engage in conversation. They were friendly, respectful, and attentive to us awkward Bostonians. In conclusion we had an amazing time and I would definitely go back next time I visit Montreal."}
{"text":"Vous avez dit Brunch du dimanche ?  Ne cherchez plus.  ZE PLACE TO BE IS : Le Chien Fumant.  J'ai toujours été \"contre\" le fait d'aller \"bruncher\" au resto et de payer des prix exubérants pour manger des oeufs brouillés, des toasts, des saucisses, des cressons et quelques tranches de fruits.  Quant à moi, je me prépare rapidement tout ça à la maison (ça prend pas plus de 5 minutes à faire tout ça dans ma cuisine) ou je vais dans un resto de type \"grasse joint\" pour me faire préparer une assiette de ce genre à quelque 7 ou 8 dollars... pas plus !  Aussi, et par définition, pour qu'un repas puisse être appelé un brunch, il doit combiner et des items du BReakfast (petit-déjeuner) et des items du lUNCH (lunch, hah !).  Look it up !  Et arrêtons de nous faire berner, bon !  Quant à moi, mon opinion sur les brunchs de ce type tient (et tiendra) toujours.    Évidemment, je ne peux m'empêcher d'aller dans ces établissements où l'on sert de faux-brunchs, des déjeuners à la fausse identité, lorsque par exemple je suis invitée à un anniversaire ou une réunion d'affaire ; j'ai mes opinions mais je ne fais pas *toujours* ma princesse. ;-)  Ceci dit, depuis bientôt un an, je suis fière d'avouer que le brunch est un de mes péchés mignons.  Ouiiii !  Mais attention.  Pas n'importe quel \"brunch\" ; celui du Chien Fumant particulièrement (et presqu'uniquement).  Le Chien Fumant, à ajouter à son carnet d'adresses si : A) Tu aimes bruncher ;  B) Tu aimes te régaler ;  C) Tu te considères \"foodie\" (ou gastronome, pour être correct ;-) ; D) Tu veux épater ta douce-moitié / tes parentes / ses parents / tes amis ;  E) Tu veux du WOW dans ta bouche ;  F) Tu as besoin d'une nouvelle adresse dans ton carnet.  Prendre note qu'il faut réserver pour s'assurer d'y manger pour le brunch (servi uniquement le dimanche) ; l'endroit, de mémoire, assoit une trentaine de personnes à la fois seulement.  Avec sa déco rustique, son mobilier de bois, ses ardoises noires, les conserves sur les étalages comme des bibelots, sa vaisselles aux motifs qui rappellent la campagne (vous savez ces dessins à l'encre bleu marin, rouge presque bourgogne ou même noire ou bleu indigo ?), et sa grande cuisine a aire ouverte, le Chien Fumant est un petit resto bien chaleureux et convivial.  On se croirait chez les chefs-mêmes !  Je n'y suis allée que pour le brunchs ; waffles, poulet frit, saucisse maison, croque-monsieur, pulled-pork, jus d'orange fraichement pressé et servi dans un assortiment de carafe et de verre à Campari... MAMMA MIA, tout était vraiment un pur délice autant pour les yeux que pour les papilles gustatives et la panse !  Alors, ma prochaine rencontre avec Ze Smoking Dog sera très certainement le soir pour le souper... j'ai très très hâte (et il va sans dire que mes attentes sont élevées)."}
{"text":"Three course brunch anyone?  This place is phenomenal!  As mentioned by other Yelpers they have a 3 course brunch special for $30.  The price is hardly much for the type of food you get.  We went on a Sunday around 12:30pm.  Be warned if you speak english, this is a part of town that is predominantly french speaking.  I'll let my pictures do the talking."}
{"text":"Déçu du menu en soirée ! Je m'attendais à un petit resto de quartier, prix raisonnables & bonne ambiance. Ce fut le cas pour la bonne ambiance, mais par contre pour ce qui est des prix, c'est assez dispendieux  pour ce que c'était, la qualité était là au moins. Bref, je ne pense pas retourner au Chien Fumant en soirée car je pense qu'il y à Montréal d'autres restaurants plus abordables et aussi bons."}
{"text":"J'ai uniquement essayer le brunch. Trop cher. Tres peu de choix. Tout est en extra. Mais original pour ceux qui veulent tester des nouveaux plats."}
{"text":"Un beau dimanche de printemps, je suis allée bruncher avec une amie qui est fan du Chien Fumant depuis longtemps. L'endroit comme tel est très petit mais aussi bien joli, alors prenez le temps de faire une réservation. Le menu change avec les saisons donc si vous avez un plat favori, profitez-en pendant qu'il est inscrit au tableau car il n'y sera pas pour toujours. J'aimerais bien y retourner en soirée car la liste de cocktail était bien tentante et les bouteilles suspendues derrière le bar me soupiraient \"Marie-Pier, il est déjà passé midi! C'est l'heure du cocktail non?\" J'ai été sage alors ça sera pour une prochaine visite."}
{"text":"One of these little wonderful spots that I almost do not want to give away, because I live just around the corner, and love its local neighbourhood feel and the quality of the food. They have amazing drinks and are doing some very creative things in-house, drink and food-wise. The ingredients are as local and great as the people. It is a great place for a night out alone just sitting at the bar, a date, or a small group; very unpretentious. The menu changes each month, and I am always excited to see what they come up with next."}
{"text":"Le Chien Fumant is a quick 3 block stroll from my place and I always looked in longingly wanting to eat there, but was waiting for the right opportunity. The day finally came and I brought a friend for what I was hoping would be a quaint, original, tasty meal but what I got was mediocre at best.  The thing is, I wanted to love Le Chien, but it kinda let me down. I had the gnocci (very average) and the doré (fairly tasty). They do have a decent number of vegetarian choices but the menu on the night I was there was fairly meat-heavy. I am going to come back and try brunch next time as the menu looks ever so promising.  Come for the cute looking staff, quaint location/decor and the kick-ass cocktails, but don't come in here expecting the best meal in Montreal by any means."}
{"text":"Tiny tiny tiny restaurant but food is big and bold. Try the beef tartare with kimchi and the doner for appetizers. The fried chicken with kimchi was recommended by our waiter, and I normally don't go for fried chicken, but I'm sure glad I did. the kimchi was a perfect pairing for the fried chicken. It's a pretty large portion, so you can take it to go. Wine selection is pretty lean."}
