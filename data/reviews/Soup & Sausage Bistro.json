{"text":"The Best Place to try Eastern European Comfort food! The staff is very friendly and helpful. The food is fresh and has many vegetarian items for those who don't want sausages and meat . I grew up eating all of this food and it was like eating  in my Mother's kitchen . I will recommend this restaurant to  everyone I know . We ordered way too much food, excited to try everything  and  tonight  are enjoying another meal from the food we took home. The  portion size is great."}
{"text":"My wife and I are new to the area and stumbled onto this gem of a place.  I typically only eat soup when I am sick but with a name like soup & sausage, I couldn't resist.  We had the borsch soup, pork meatloaf, cabbage wrapped beef, and a slice of berry pie.  It was all amazing!  We will definitely be back.  The meatloaf was some of the best I have ever had and the soup was very flavorful and hearty.  The cabbage wrapped beef was my favorite!  I highly recommend dropping in to try it out if you are in the area.  Next time I will try  one of the sausages, which they have several to offer."}
{"text":"Ive been here a couple times and the food is always fresh and super tasty. If you enjoy eastern European cuisine this is the place to go for some good old home cookin food"}
{"text":"This place is a must!! Had the beef cabbage roll, hot Italian sausage and fried dumplings. Everything was authentic and top notch service to go with it."}
{"text":"The food was excellently prepared and the taste was remarkable. By far the best cabbage rolls I have had in some time. Friendly service and reasonably priced. I never had borsch soup before. The soup was great. If you don't visit this restaurant you are missing out on some fabulous food."}
{"text":"Very good Eastern European food.  Good service.  The cabbage rolls were delicious."}
{"text":"Stopped here to eat a few weeks ago and neglected to write my review until I saw all of the 5 star reviews, which is exactly why I stopped here in the first place.
Unfortunately my experience with this restaurant was not the same.  I ordered a cabbage roll with an order of potato pancakes.  First the cabbage roll was huge, but it had absolutely no flavor.  Give me less, but give me flavor that my taste buds can enjoy!  The potato pancakes were definitely not fresh!  They appeared to be frozen imitations that hau.   d the feel and taste of what you would expect if eating a hockey puck!  They were way over cooked, hard as a rock and again like the cabbage rolls had absolutely no flavor.  I order cabbage rolls and potato pancakes at the local Jewish deli's around town and they are world's apart from what I had here to eat.  
Maybe it was the time of day, the cook or whatever might have been the case, I plan to stop again just to see if this experience was a onetime thing.  Otherwise all of you that rate this a 5 need to see your doctor to have your taste buds checked!!"}
{"text":"Went back for sausage and pierogi (I chose the potato and bacon) and for the sausage I chose the \"heavy smoked\" both were excellent."}
{"text":"Great fresh, homemade foods. I have tried several of the soups...all good and loaded with fresh vegs."}
{"text":"I have been here several times and each time no disappointment! The beef stuffed cabbage is so delicious, make sure you ask for the homemade bread, yummy! Potato pancakes are good with applesauce but need extra applesauce. The Polish sausages are good also. One can dine in or takeout. Small simple eat in but clean! Ethnic food at its best! I have been back several times since this review, I just wanted to compliment Soup & Sausage once again. The food here is delicious! Reminds me of my childhood memories with my Polish families cooking, absolutely delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Polish sausage and sauerkraut were the best!
Quaint setting and friendly service. So much more on the menu I must try so we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great place to eat. Clean, friendly service good homemade food. The borscht soup was delicious. Wonderful cabbage rolls and the smoked sausage is perfect. If you're looking for good Ukraine and Polish this is the place to try."}
{"text":"This is the third time I've eaten here.  Great, fresh natural food is a welcome addition to the neighborhood.  Had the chicken soup which is exceptional.  Loaded with lots of chicken and vegetables.  Had the polish sausage with sauerkraut.  That was really good but not my favorite.  Stuffed cabbage roll is a real winner.  Very close to my mothers homemade stuffed cabbage. Highly recommend this dish.
Potato pancakes are great as well.  And don't forget to try their pies for dessert.  Overall excellent.


Just recently had the green borscht.  This is an amazing soup with 
Lots of flavor.  Real home cooking quality.  A light soup with spinach and potato.  Yummm. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The flavors where so good on every dish we ordered. I would come back to this place again and need to as I want to try every dish. 
We ordered a couple soups, beef cabbage, meatballs, dumplings, and a beet salad. It all was so delicious! We didn't even order a sausage but that's next on the list."}
{"text":"On my first visit I tried the borscht and the Polish sausage - both very good and flavorful. Boscht can be served hot or cold; this bistro serves it hot, though my order could have been heated a bit more. Perhaps the dollop of sour cream cooled it a bit. Nevertheless, it was very tasty and I enjoyed it. The Polish sausages were superb and made me determined to try the other sausage varieties for future visits. On the second visit I ordered the pork cabbage roll. It was huge because of a very generously portioned rice and pork stuffing, and the tomato sauce was well seasoned. Overall it made for a very satisfying (and inexpensive) meal. The service is friendly, you get Eastern European comfort food at wallet-friendly prices, the bistro is conveniently located at the commercial plaza near the North Mountain Preserve on 7th Street and parking is plentiful."}
{"text":"Food is excellent. Had the chicken soup, cabbage roll, chicken schnitzel, borscht and pork ribs. Everything is great and good price. Definitely recommend if you want authentic European food."}
{"text":"Fresh, homemade everything. 

The chicken soup was made fresh when we ordered it. The smoked sausage  was perfect. The meatballs were fabulous. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Yam! Yam! Yam! Food very delicious, I am Russian and cook Russian food, well tell you straight you I was happy with meal, soup like my grandma cook many years ago, my husband told me it was delicious and the borscht was as good and maybe better lol. Do try the ribs in cherry sauce excellent, portion size may be large, but hoot news you can have in doggy bag!"}
{"text":"Just a wonderful service , great choices on the menu and fabulous tasty foods. 
With a friend we shared borscht, meatloaf, two kinds of pierogies   And we finished with sweet pancakes with cottage cheese.... Yummmm
We ordered a bit too much for just two of us but everything looked and sounded delicious ,so we had left overs which made us even happier.
It's in my neighborhood so I will eat there couple times a week for sure. Thank you Soup and Sausage ."}
{"text":"I have had this little place bookmarked for a while now and we finally checked it out. It's small with just a few tables and you order at the counter but the service is excellent. They were very friendly and accommodating. My teenager took one look at the menu and announced he was only eating French fries but that was his loss.  I had the sausage platter with two potato pancakes and instead of the tomato salad they let me get fries for my son. I had my choice of sausages but when with the Polish. The meal came with two and they were delicious. My husband had a chicken calzone and although he couldn't identify what exactly was in it he said it was delicious. 

This place is definitely worth trying if you are in the area. They do a lot of take out so it's a great option to pick up something different on the way home for dinner."}
{"text":"Such lovely and excellent tasting eastern European food.  Enjoyed every bite of it. Potato Pancakes, Borscht with the sour cream, Solyanka with smoked sausages inside, the Pork Ribs with Cherries and we absolutely love the Cabbage Rolls!"}
{"text":"This is definitely my new favorite place to open in the Phoenix area! 
We stopped in for a late lunch/early dinner a little over a week ago and thoroughly enjoyed it.  I enjoyed the chicken soup, a pork cabbage roll (maybe the best I have ever eaten and am craving it as I write this) and shared the boiled potato dumplings with bacon and sour cream with my husband.  Amazing food and wonderful staff who were so concerned with ensuring we had a great experience...and we absolutely did!  We'll definitely be back again and again!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Some of the best food I've had in the valley. I'm hooked on the borcht and hot sandwich, but my buddy ordered the hunter stew and said it amazing. If you're in the mood for some good eats, this is your place. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Definitely give this place a try if you want to get your Polish on. I'll focus on the soups, pierogi and cabbage rolls. The cabbage roll is one of the best I've ever had. The sauce that goes over it is sublime, and the whole thing just melts in your mouth. (Frank F, my taste buds are working just fine.) The pierogi are good... nothing special... but you get 10 nice plump frozen units for $10 and I always have some in my freezer. The soups, at least the two I tried, are delicious. The tripe soup (flaki) could probably benefit from a little more salt and pepper but is nice and rich, and the tripe pieces are like little bits of silk floating in the broth. The solyanka is absolutely perfect. Get some to take home. Hearty but not heavy, it's satisfying and pretty to look at. I also tried the Pork Ribs Under Cherry Sauce. The ribs were fall off the bone tender, but I didn't really taste any cherry and the potatoes were little more than an afterthought. Finally, I haven't tried any sausage from their menu but they get it from Schreiner's, so you can't go wrong there."}
{"text":"Amazing food and affordable prices. Glad to have more European food out in this area... you don't get much out here other than a McDonald's on every corner or your local pizza place. Extremely pleased with the staff and environment. The service is quick and friendly. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a quick bite to eat or people looking to sit and eat a while. :)"}
{"text":"Luv luv luv the food here! Truly European! Tasty cabbage rolls and authentic sauerkraut! Pirogies are scrumptious! Hope they do well!"}
{"text":"The food here is so tasty that we drive from Scottsdale to eat here.  It's remarkably cheap, too.  $5 for sausages, for example.  You can fill up for $10.

There is no alcohol and it's service at the counter, but the food is so worth the minimal ambiance.  

I highly recommend the cabbage rolls.  Also, the linguisa sausage is great.  Stewed sauerkraut and stewed cabbage were excellent.

I wasn't too fond of the dumplings.  The fried dumplings were hard little rocks and the boiled ones were pretty bland.  

On the whole, it's a great investment of time and money."}
{"text":"Excellent place to eat!  If you haven't tried it, your missing out. We frequent this place often. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Delicious food! Good friendly service.  We had the Solyanka, chicken soup with stuffed bread and sausage in dough.  The soups had lots of flavor and the bread was fresh."}
{"text":"This place is awesome in every way.  First of all, I walked in not even knowing it was 15 minutes after closing time. They took my order and said nothing about being closed. When I learned it was passed closing time I felt bad, having previously worked in the food industry. However, they had no problem whipping up a meal to go for me. Got the soup and bread combo. Not even sure which soup I got but it is unbelievable. The mushroom calzone type dish is also really good. I will definitely be back. Great food, service, and vibe."}
{"text":"After some thought I decided to modify this review.  First, let me make it clear that I am an Americanized Slovenien/Bohemien via my ancestors. 

We like a lot of sauce/gravy.  The area that this restaurant represents doesn't eat a lot of sauce or gravy.  Cathy and I like creamy soups.  The area that this restaurant represents does not offer a lot of thick, creamy or sauce loaded anything.  It's mostly fresh vegies, meats, filled doughs, boiled and fried items, sour cream and spices.

As long as you understand the above you will thoroughly enjoy your meal.

VERY clean and simple decor.  As a career commercial real estate broker who has brokered many restaurant deals I can tell you that some money was spent on the 100% stainless steel kitchen, which is immaculate.

Cathy had the chicken Schnitzle + mushroom soup and thought it was very good abiet the soup a little watery.  I had the beef stuffed cabbage & Borscht.   The stuffed cabbage is huge and tender, but the amount of sauce offered with it was not on par with my nationality taste.  I also had the borscht, a first time for me, and I thought it was was excellent.  

Be aware that the portions here are generous, the prices are reasonable,  the staff is friendly and responsive.  We brought dinner home for tomorrow with the leftovers.  We'll be back soon to try something new.

We recommend this neighborhood restaurant."}
{"text":"My first visit to this little eatery was today. First off, I love eastern European food. The menu was fairly extensive, allowing me to choose from good number of options.

I chose the soup and sausage meal, which comes with fries and a drink. The chicken soup was excellent and full of tasty meat and veggies. The broth was nice but not overly salty. The sausage I chose was the Italian and it was nice with a slight spice kick at the end, but nothing that anyone would be concerned about. I loved it. The fries were hot and very nice and crispy. I also got bread for the soup as well (it was extra). The bread was homemade, slightly dense and tasty, though it wasn't warm.

The location is hidden slightly within a strip mall off of 7th Street just south of Thunderbird. The staff were very friendly and helped explain the menu and options. The restaurant itself is small with about a half dozen to 10 tables, just perfect for a lunch with a friend. The prices seemed reasonable and in line with what I would expect. The experience was pleasant and the food was good. I will return to try out the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"I am compelled to update my review, as this restaurant has expanded their menu, and all to the good.  They have a couple of new dinner dishes that are worth mentioning:  Hunter's Stew and Pork Ribs under Cherries.  The Hunter's Stew is a succulent bowl of very tender beef stew, served with bread and green onions.  Delicious.  I would have rather had  potatoes, to soak up the wonderful sauce, but the bread did a nice job.  Enough for lunch the next day.  The Pork Ribs are fantastic.  I was hesitant about the cherries, but wow! what a great sauce.  The cherries are very subtle, really just a great enhancement for the generous portion of fall off the bone ribs.  Served with some nice baby roasted potatoes.  Two new winners for this place.
The restaurant continues to be sparkling clean and the service very gracious."}
{"text":"This is a great little place tucked away in a non-descript little strip mall area.  The food is wonderful, the pork roll was a generous size and very tasty.  Same with the side of cabbage - huge bowl.  We also had the Solyanka soup, again a hit.  All the prices are extremely reasonable.   I would recommend this place to anyone looking to try some food that is not run of the mill."}
{"text":"This is a real European food bistro.

I had pork meatloaf and sauerkraut that was fantastic (My wife HATED it, so I know it was authentic!)

My wife had chicken in dough, which she really enjoyed as well.

It was so good, we can't wait to try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been coming here since they opened.  Being from Europe myself, I find their food delicious and comforting as if it had come out of my Oma's kitchen.  The sausages are well above average in taste and all soups have a depth of flavor with Solyanka and it's smokiness being my favorite.  I've recently discovered their tomato salad and have to say it's even better than my doctored up Knorr seasoning recipe, which is pretty good! While the minimalist approach to decor and cheap utensils may detract some, this place is a gem and a welcomed addition to our Moon Valley community!"}
{"text":"We received a glowing review from a friend...  She completely missed the mark.  This is not just good, it was fantastic.  We had the special - soup and cabbage roll with pie.  The food surpasses expectation.  We have never had better food.  Service is excellent, prices are fair and it's in our neighborhood.  Nice work...  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This sweet little bistro has room for about 20 customers and the menu is exciting,  I tried flaki, my favorite soup in Poland,  It was fine but must have been a recipe from a different region than my home.   The cabbage roll was what I expected and was HUGE.  I have never seen one three times the size of the homemade  ones.  A meal in itself.  The 52 steps dessert was wonderful and surprisingly not too sweet.  I found the soup and cabbage roll to be very salty, though.  Portions are ample."}
{"text":"I love soup and decided to try this place with my mom. They have a bunch of different types of European soups and dishes. The soup I got was the Solyanka which is a pork sausage with bacon and potatoe. It had a great flavor and came with a rolled up sausage. 

The workers were very nice even when I had to make a small change to my order they were very accommodating and helpful. 

Overall, I recommend this place as its a small family owned shop and I like supporting local business."}
{"text":"Coming from a German family I long for a good bratwurst and sour kraut, this place is amazing and conveniently located just down the street from me. It's so good, everything is fresh, the staff is always pleasant. If you love European food I would highly suggest this place. Also, try the beef cabbage roll and the mushroom is also amazing. Try this place, I went on a whim and was not disappointed now I go weekly!"}
{"text":"All the food was excellent. Our group tried all the different sausages and a few of the soups and were not disappointed by anything. We can't wait to go again and try some of the other soups and menu items.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This food was delicious! I was surprised to see the cabbage rolls were huge! But tasted just like my grandmother's.. The potato pancakes were also awesome as well as the sausage and sauerkraut. I will sure be back!"}
{"text":"First time trying Ukrainian food. Got the sausage in waffles and they were tasty. I very much enjoyed my food. Will be back"}
{"text":"New local gem. Polish, German, Russian, Ukrainian combo. Some of the dishes our family tried were the chicken soup, mushroom soup (very good), meatballs (very good), fresh bratwurst (very good), potato pancakes (very good) and fried dumplings. I would definitely recommend the meatballs, soups, and sausage! There was a rush when we got there so we had to wait for our food a bit, but it is a must return for us."}
{"text":"The stuffed cabbage was great and so was the tripe soup. Both recommended by one of the employees. The staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick taste, had the Beef Cabbage roll with Lecho sauce, it was delicious!!! The two young people at the counter were helpful, respectful, and very professional.  So glad to find a neighborhood restaurant with Eastern European choices, I don't live in the area, but I will be back!!!!!"}
{"text":"The food was really good and the place is very neat! We will be back again! I want to try the Linguisa."}
{"text":"Soups are really good! Fast and clean establishement with very cool cuisine. Def reccommend trying the borscht."}
{"text":"This place is a welcome addition to the neighborhood. My wife and I ate here and had a wonderful time and experience. Food was top notch (had the green borsch and smoked sausage) it was just like Grandma used to make (better actually) and the ambience and decor were also nice. 

I am glad to support these folks and will be returning in the future. They have a great customer loyalty program."}
{"text":"We have been here twice now, the European food is excellent! I would highly recommend if you like German food!"}
{"text":"Food was authentic, which can be a bit boring imho, I'd like to have seen some effort with the presentation. The pie was heated in a microwave I think. I hope they step up their game with the presentation a bit and maybe Americanize their menu a little, works well for Thai, Japanese, Chinese food restaurants."}
{"text":"I have just had a lot of dental work so soup sounded good. My wife and I went down there today for lunch and got two bowls of soup. It was ok we spent $15.00 bucks and left there hungry.   My suggestion if you are hungry go elsewhere. If you are on a diet and want to cut back it might be your spot, good flavor, just not much to it."}
{"text":"Yummy food! Authentic flavors! I had the olivie and beef cabbage roll! Reminded me of the ones my Polish mother used to make!!! I can't wait to go back and try more items off the menu!! Great customer service!"}
{"text":"Yep, its legit.  Had the sausage plate.  Polish sausage and sauerkraut.  2 decent size links that were cooked perfect.  Great flavor.  Sauerkraut was a little different than what i was expecting... not a vinegar flavor more sweet but still flavorful.  Getting the soup combo plate to go for thw wife at home... meatloaf, mushroom soup, tomato salad.  Will be back for sure.  Fresh cabbage stuffed bread in dining room while eating as well."}
{"text":"Authentic Ukrainian food. The restaurant was clean and the staff was friendly and the food was delicious! Definitely going back for more solyanka, borsch, and potato pancakes with sour cream!"}
{"text":"I saw the sign on the back of the building that said Soup and Sausage and had to check it out. Prices are very reasonable. I ordered to go and the service was quick and friendly. The boiled potato dumplings were excellent. I ordered the Italian, Polish and bratwurst sausage and tasted each one and they were all excellent as was the stewed cabbage. We will definitely order from them again. It's a new business only open for four months so I hope the word gets out and the community shows them some love."}
{"text":"Excellent. I grew up eating this kind of food at home, and was surprised to find Ukrainian food in Phoenix, of all places. The dishes are all home-made and very fresh, with a good variety of things to choose from. Last time I was here they were giving out samples to customers as well (potato and onion pirozhki, which I don't think is on the menu, but should be!) I have been here a few times already, and will definitely be coming back again. Highly recommended for anyone who enjoys, or wants to try out, Eastern European cuisine. The prices are great too!"}
{"text":"Had this delivered by Door Dash (not a plug) because I wanted some soup. Everything was boxed well and for what you get it is a wonderful bargain ! I had the dumplings, meatloaf and the chicken soup. You can tell it's all homemade even delivered it was just outstanding.  I'm going to go there today and try the other items ! Great place !"}
{"text":"Small, casual place but with table service. I'm not familiar with Eastern European food but I think I love it. Ordered a cabbage roll. Huge and flavorful. Best ever eaten. Wanted to try borscht. Did. I thought borscht was made out of beets and would taste like beets. This soup was red, said it had beets in it, neutral tasted like very good tomato and onion soup. Not even a whiff of beet. Ordered short ribs under cherries with baby potatoes. Don't know where else in town you can order that for $9.99. Ribs were fall off the bone tender, bbq flavor, but the grease pooled on the plate. Ick. Ate them all. Yep, had the potato salad - euro-style. Mayo-y and darn good. I'm definitely going back."}
{"text":"We've been to this restaurant a few times. Last night we had two full dinners. My husband ordered the meat loaf dinner and the best boiled dumplings with bacon that I've tasted in a long time. You can get the dumplings fried or boiled. I had 3 meatballs dinner with potato pancakes and applesauce and sour cream. Very tasty!!!! 
After sharing bites of each other's dinners we both agreed that the meatballs are less spicy then the meatloaf. We had way too much food and will finish up leftovers tonight. $20 for both of us. Give it a try for when you're up for an adventure.  The atmosphere is plain and the people are so friendly and really go out of their way to please."}
{"text":"Delicious! 
Don't be turned away by the seemingly high prices. The quality is higher and the food is made from scratch. Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"Nice change of pace for food. They serve eastern Mediterranean food. They have wifi and great tasting food."}
{"text":"The pierogies are absolutely awesome!!! I had a ton of questions as I was not familiar with the menu and they were more than helpful with explaining it to my family and I.  Oh and there are 7 of us. We all loved our food and will definitely be back. 5 stars all the way! Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"The stuffed cabbage was the best I've ever had (I got the red pepper sauce and it was amazing). The borscht was also very delicious. Super friendly staff, and the atmosphere is relaxing and laid-back."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a bowl of the borsch and the olivie. The olivie was very good. It was funny that the gal working the front didn't know the russian names for things. Olivie is similar to potato salad. Anyway, everything was perfect. The potatoes, eggs, peas, mayo all great. The only thing I would add was a sprinkle of cilantro or parsley or a sprig added just before service. The photos on the website have these and the bright green really sets the dish off.

The borsh was ok. The flavor was good. My bowl didn't have any meat and the potatoes were too soft. I know it's tough for a place to have soup cooking all day, but maybe they could separate the meat and vegetables from the broth after the primary cooking then add them back and quickly reheat just before serving. Again, I thought a sprinkle of fresh parsley or cilantro on top right before servvice would have improved the presentation.

The location itself was really small with kind of generic furnishings. It reminded me of similar places I'd been in St. Petersburg."}
