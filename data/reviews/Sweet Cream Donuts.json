{"text":"Hands Down the best service and donuts..i spend a lot of money here...Bless this business and may they stay safe and prosperous...!"}
{"text":"OMG!!  We have been in desperate need of a fresh donut shop on this side of town for years.  This place is great.  Friendly service?  Fresh delicious donuts?  It's a win-win situation.  Pros; convenient, friendly, delicious  Cons; I will probably gain 500 pounds this year....LOL"}
{"text":"Out of the hundreds of donut shops in my area, I drive 30 minutes out of my way to eat the donuts here. I guarantee the quality of Sweet Cream Donuts is light years ahead of the guys at Bosa, Dunkin, or Krispys.  Soft, fluffy, great consistency, and actually tastes really good the day after. Basically if you know what a quality donut should taste like, you will see why I get a dozen here once a week."}
{"text":"Love that we have a freshly made donut shop on this side of town. They are great!!!!!! I've gone at different times of the day and they are always so soft. Great service too!"}
{"text":"Best donuts south of the 10! Pirron is awesome. Only bad part is......my belt no longer fits. Too tasty to deny!"}
{"text":"The owner is extremely friendly. Love taking my sisters here when they visit. Great food and service!"}

{"text":"I just discovered this place and it's right down the street from my house. OMG!! I have been missing out. The donuts here are so fresh and have do much flavor! This is definitely my new spot and I highly recommend it to anyone!!"}
{"text":"Awesome Lil joint. Great hang out spot for lunch.great fresh made sandwiches and donuts. Nice friendly environment."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!! The Boba and Thai tea are great and I plan to come back many more times to try everything they have to offer!"}
{"text":"They have the best donuts in the area! The people are very friendly and the donuts are soo fresh and warm!!"}
{"text":"This is a small donut shop but they make fresh donuts everyday that are so delicious. basic types, bars, chocolate, cream filled etc. also very good pricing and fresh coffee. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. Friendly Family owned business !! Will definitely return !!"}
{"text":"Purchased half a dozen donuts and two caramel coffees and it only came to be 12 dollars. The donuts are sweet and dense but not in a bad way. I will be returning to this location"}
{"text":"Stopped by Sweet Cream donuts today and let me start off by saying the staff is really friendly here when you go to corporate places they have to be friendly because they are paid to say hello most of the time they dont care to greet you at the door but they do it because they have to.  Not the vibe here we walked in with a genuine hello, good morning! And then ordered a few donuts some donut holes and a few smoothies the strawberry banana, strawberry, and caramel.  The strawberry banana is much better than just regular strawberry. The donuts are pretty darn good i will definitely be coming here again."}
{"text":"I am not only excited there is a local doughnut shop this place is really really good. They are so fresh and tasty and staff is sooo nice."}
{"text":"Bomb! I normally wouldn't eat donuts unless they were like the Cali ones and these are it! Will forever be coming here!"}
{"text":"Wow! By far the best donuts in town hands down. The service is great and man the donuts melt in your mouth. This has been my spot since the place opened.  Thank you sweet cream donuts for bringing these donuts into town."}
{"text":"My colleague said Sweet Cream Donuts hands down are better than Dunkin Donuts. I was sceptical...being from NY double Ds has always had the best donuts around. After trying a Sweet Cream Boston cream, glazed twist and chocolate cake donut hole I'm a believer. I expected super sweet crunchy sugary donuts like those i've had in Asia. Instead I got delicately crafted donuts minus the heavy taste of sugar. Thank you for the great donuts!"}
{"text":"Food: 5 Service: 3.5 Value: 4.5  These are very delicious donuts and pretty cheap too."}
{"text":"This place is great since it's close to home, I don't have to make those rare drives to get to a donut shop. The donuts are delicious. I also ordered their iced coffee. The only reason I will give a four star and not 5 is because it's very sweet, too sweet.  I know it's a donut shop but I think they over did it with sugar in everything, yet again i rarely eat donuts."}
{"text":"Amazing donuts, great prices, and quick friendly service."}
{"text":"All Donuts are Not Created Equal  If you're under the impression that donuts are donuts, then you havent been to Sweet Cream Donuts.  We needed a quick breakfast before heading out for work and stumbled upon Sweet Cream Donuts.   Sweet Vream Donuts offers delicious  donuts in various flavors and fillings. These donuts have the perfect texture and taste. I had regular glazed, chocolate cream filled, and a cinnamon sugar donut, and each was delicious.   Sweet Cream Donuts is a nice shop with wallet friendly pricing."}
{"text":"Everything from the interior set-up to the menu is akin to a Bosa, with a critical distinction being that this place ensures that their doughnuts are fresh and soft. They offer the typical choices as expected. The coffee was average but the other drinks looked intriguing and may be better. Prices were fair and service was friendly! I would certainly suggest this over the other (limited) options in the area."}
{"text":"Amazing!! Loved this place!! Great service and fresh donuts!! Also enjoyed my Thai iced tea with boba! I'll definitely be back soon!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic donuts and breakfast croissants. Family owned and very friendly. Donuts are fresh and taste great! Sandwiches on toast croissant or bagel. Smoothies , ice tea coffee, cappuccino, and hot cocoa. Open early and prices are very reasonable. Welcome them to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"I come here all the time. Kids love it and I usually get breakfast for co-workers. Staff are always welcoming and friendly. Great fresh donuts with a good variety."}
{"text":"Good donuts and sandwiches.  Quick service and the owners are very friendly.  Seating not the cleanest but I think it's because they are always so busy..."}
{"text":"I am writting this review with a heavy heart as the owner (Cambodian lady) and owners niece at this donut shop were very nice to me the few times I went here. On Monday 4/25 around 3:15pm I went across the street (as I work at Walmart Pharmacy) for a roast beef croissant sandwich and a couple coffees. Within 2-3 hours after my meal and coffee I was severely food poisoned. Been vomiting with fever for the last couple days and now it's turned into severe diarrhea (I have been glued to the restroom for the last 24 hours). I had to cancel my shift at work twice already which cost me hundreds of dollars and have been bed ridden.  I would never viciously leave a bad review on yelp, but this experience has been a nightmare and this place needs to learn and improve it's sanitation and food handling and needs to be visited by the department of health. I suspect there was cross contamination of some sort and most probably e coli (I am a health care professional by the way). If the owner of this place is reading this review, please do yourself, and future customers a favor and look into this matter as I would not wish this nightmare on my worst enemy."}
{"text":"Was looking for a sandwich shop close to work. Saw the Yelp reviews on this place thought I'd check it around 1230. They have about 4 small tables with some counter space. The tables & chairs were sorta scattered around It was if they just got hit with a bus load of people or something. Which was kinda weird cause I was the only person in there with the guy behind the counter sitting down on his phone. Floors needed a good sweeping. I'm not trying to be to picky. But if your business is dead wouldn't you want to work on the dining area? I was sorta skeptical about the sandwich situation before I got there. Because I mean with a name \"Sweet Cream Donuts\" obviously you specialize in donuts not sandwiches. But they do advertise they offer sandwiches so time to eat. It was good. I had a Roast beef croissant, Fritos, jelly donut and an iced tea, $7.88. My 145lb self could of probably ate 2 of those sandwiches. The next time I find myself tired of Subway, I may go back again."}
{"text":"Delicious donuts that are fresh and tasty. They have smoothies with boba in a variety of flavors that I no longer need to drive to Avondale to enjoy. My family has tried three flavors and they were all good. The service is friendly and they are open later in the evening to take care of after dinner dessert cravings."}
{"text":"Best donuts I have ever had.  That's really all I can say about this place.  Come here during the mornings when it's fresh and you will be blown away."}
{"text":"I live down the street and always come for the doughnuts, there really good! Soft and almost melts in your mouth. I recommend them. Plus owners are super nice!"}
{"text":"Wow. So happy I stumbled upon this place. Their honeydew boba and Thai tea boba are so good. I also ordered the twisted glazed doughnuts. It's soft and delicious. Yummy"}
{"text":"Good, fresh donuts, great prices and friendly workers.  What more could you ask for?  This area really needed a place like this so I am super happy to see it pop up and to see all the good reviews."}
{"text":"Love this place! I'm glad they opened. They're friendly and we are loyal return customers. Help out this small business to keep them in our local community. Like most small businesses they have a lot of room to grow so I hope they don't go out of business."}
{"text":"Nice to see more donut shops opening up in Phoenix!  I've had better donuts but the glazed donuts were pretty good. I wish they had pig in the blankets!"}
{"text":"They always have the freshest donuts and yummiest Thai tea! Although I asked for easy ice once and they rolled their eyes but whatever lol"}
{"text":"Sunday morning. Everyone is still asleep. What is a dad to do? Pick up donuts for breakfast. We drive by this shop all the time and I have always said that we should try it some time. Well, this morning I decided to get some. Now, I'm not a donut snob - a gas station donut will satisfy that sweet craving for me, but I have been raised on Dunkin' Donuts all my life. I have to say, the donuts at Sweet Cream are amazing. So soft and flavorful, you can tell these donuts are not made from a mass market recipe. I picked up a variety of different kinds including the Boston Creme, which some places have trouble getting right. Not Sweet Cream, though. It tasted just like biting into a Boston Creme Pie with the perfect mixture of chocolate a creamy filling. Also picked up a mango smoothie with mango boba. Great flavor and not overly sweet. The staff there was friendly and helpful - i reccomend this place to anyone who loves a great donut. It definitely makes the list of places to go all the time."}
{"text":"Straight flames!!!!! From donuts to sandwiches shoot they smoothies are the nectar of Gods!!!!!!! #bobaordie"}

{"text":"Omg best donuts around they are always so fresh and soft  and cheap!!!!! Love this place glad to have it close to home and work ...the ladies are always friendly here"}
{"text":"I searched this place needing a donut shop to buy donuts for a work meeting! Thank God I found them. The girl was super nice and super quick..donuts taste amazing. I wanted a mom and pop shop style donuts and that's exactly what I got. I will be back often as it's on my way to work!!"}
{"text":"Ladies that work there are always super nice and give us free bite size donuts when we go in. The donuts are nice and fluffy and always taste great! Nice little donut shop!"}
{"text":"My family and I love this place. The staff is so nice and the donuts are amazing. I actually have friends from Jersey who request Sweet Cream every time they visit. They have a wide selection of donuts and a variety of other foods, as well. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I want to love it. I really love that it's family owned more power to them. However i had a couple concerns that i had hiccups with. I came in at 5:00pm ish and i don't know if the young lady had had a bad day or didn't want to be there but she generally looked annoyed not talkative or friendly in the least bit. No problem we all have our days. I ordered two small boba's and 2 donuts set me back at about 10 dollars. I don't see what people are raving about the donuts are too starchy and not airy for me like too much flour and tasted like margarine. The chocolate glaze was meh. The boba's were way too watered down with too little flavoring. I was drinking it and sucked on several that had a deformed hard edge grossed me out. Overall i want to love it but i just don't see what all the fuss is about i don't think i'll give it a second chance or maybe i will but not likely."}
{"text":"So glad this place opened and great location. Salina is awesome and friendly. This is the go to spot for breakfast for fresh ham and cheese croissants with jalapenos mmmm.  Way better than Dunkin Donuts"}
{"text":"Awesome donuts! The smoothies are OK, but their Thai tea is wonderful. Clean and friendly. I'm so glad we have a donut place nearby."}
{"text":"My favorite Boba place  I love their milk green tea boba  I can drink it everyday! The owner is so nice, finally a decent place in this area!!"}
{"text":"I am new to the area decided to try these donuts and I'm hooked! They are always so soft, and delicious! Staff is really nice! I'm definitely gonna be a regular!"}
