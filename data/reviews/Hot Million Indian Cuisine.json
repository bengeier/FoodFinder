{"text":"Clean restaurant, friendly and prompt service.  Casual atmosphere and decor.  Food was very good with generous sized portions.  Coconut rice was very coconutty (this is a good thing), and the naan was a perfect mix of crisp and chewy (with a large variety to chose from).  Can be pricey outside of lunch buffet hours but so are most Indian restaurants in Calgary."}
{"text":"The service here is phenomenal! The staff are friendly and attentive. The food is rich in flavour and taste. The spicy dishes  keep the rich flavour without sacrificing taste for the sake of spicy heat. We eat at Hot Millions once a week and our kids love the staff and food."}
{"text":"Incredible place. Have only ordered take out and delivery and the customer service is great. Vishal and his family shows a genuine care to ensure the food quality is consistent. They go the extra mile to take care of their customers!! Highly recommend !!"}
{"text":"Fantastic first visit. Have been missing out of good Indian food for a while (not much we've found in South Calgary) and this both satisfied the craving and will have us coming back. Started with the Hot Million Veg Platter. Butter Chicken, Hot Million Special (Goat) Ishtoo and Mixed Veggies with a few orders of Garlic Cilantro Naan for mains. Enough for some leftovers. No room for dessert. We're across town so next time will try takeout (we're told Skip the Dishes will deliver to us). Good stuff!"}
{"text":"We were so pleasantly surprised at this little gem we found, we have been to several Indian restaurant but none have compared to this one, the food was fresh, flavorful and delish !!! They didn't have the most items on there lunch bar but this is a case of quality over quantity!  Very very very much worth the drive across town, we will definitely be going back!!!  They are not afraid to show there spice! Very very good."}
{"text":"Horrible name, amazing food.  We went here for mother's day and it was the best Indian food we've had in several years.  The naan and the pakora's were among the best in Calgary, challenging my former favorite Indian restaurant, Mango Shiva.  My wife really wanted the Chat Papri, having not had it in a long time and it was delicious.  We had an all veg meal, so I can't comment on their meat selections, but everything we had was excellent.  Their prices were on par with most other restaurants we go to, and their portion size was above average.  The server was very pleasant and the restaurant was clean and well maintained, though on the dark and bland side.  The only sad part is we live in the deep southwest, but will definitely trek to the north east to enjoy the food they offer here."}
{"text":"I don't know what has happened since my last review but my spidey senses point towards a change in ownership or chef. The quality on the sauces seems to be going down with the tikka masala being the shining light. The spices were bland, massive chunks of bell pepper, and overloaded with ginger. The butter chicken has been inconsistently seasoned. Everything out of the tandoor is still on point though. Still one of the better Indian places in the NE, but I no longer order the tikka masala and my patronage is decreasing."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! My Dad and I have been here quite a bit this month (and we don't live close). I found it a little hard to locate the first time because it is around the back squished next to Apple Bees, but once you find this place you'll have a hard time forgetting it. We always get great service, and the staff is so friendly. The buffet has a great selection of items from curries and lentils to desserts. The price of the buffet includes naan bread and a drink, and is very affordable! When you order the naan it come right out of the kitchen, fresh and hot! We've been looking for a good Indian buffet for a while and I'm happy to say this place hits the mark! We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"I'm from Vancouver and have really missed Indian food since moving to central Alberta.  From time to time I find some adequate curry here and there, but Hot Million is more than adequate.  It's by far the best Indian food I've had in the five years that I've lived here.  It tastes like food from back home.  In fact it tastes better than food from back home.  Hot Million may be the best Indian food I've had, ever.  Their lunch buffet has an excellent selection of curries: vegetable, cheese, red meat, poultry, and fish.  Spice was extremely mild but very flavourful which was good for my kids.  If you like things spicier, just add some \"green sauce\" (don't know the name).  Besides curry, there were salads, rice, naan, and papadum, and for dessert, rice pudding, gulab jamun, and fresh fruit.  The meal was so good it left me truly sorry that I was no longer hungry after two plates.  Their staff were extremely friendly and happily interacted with our kids.  We'll be back next time we're in Calgary."}
{"text":"It was one of the most amazing buffets that I had in a long time.  It had a good variety for appetizers and entree.  It had Rasmalai, Gulaab Jamoon in desserts.  The staff was really courteous and gave us Naan with the the buffet.   I rarely go for Indian buffets and this did not disappoint me at all. The food was extraordinary to say the least.  I loved everything about it."}
{"text":"I've been to about a half dozen Indian places in Calgary and was beginning to despair. I recently went to Hot Million however and it was far and away the best Indian food I've found in Calgary. There are even a few \"Bombay chaat\" items on the menu, which I haven't seen elsewhere in Calgary. The food was excellent, the service was very good, the restaurant was very clean, and the prices were decent. I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"This place was so good. I went here hungry and they didn't dissapoint! Everything seemed fresh, their staff was nice and most importantly it was a delicious buffet. The goat was my favorite dish. Best of all, it was a pretty good price."}
{"text":"One of the best Indian food I've ever had! We stopped by Calgary after our flight and on our way to Fernie. We loved their lunch buffet!  Service was fantastic, quality food: fresh and delicious. It beats some of Toronto's finest Indian restaurants. My favorite was the zucchini and the lamb. My friend loved their butter chicken.The Nan is to die for! It was the food we went for, not how fancy the interior is. if you are looking for a fancy interior, this may not be your place."}
{"text":"Pleaselty surprised food is very fresh and each dish has a unique flavours as it should. Service is excellent!"}
{"text":"My wife and I usually try and stop in our once a year pass through Calgary (originally my hometown).  Everything is so similar to British-Indian food, and so very well prepared. The dishes are very traditional Curry house and fresh. You can tell they pay attention to quality ingredients.  I would mention that each entree is more than enough to share between 2 people especially if having naan (order the peshwari) and rice."}
{"text":"Love it. I've been three times now (in one week) for the lunch buffet. The buffet turns over daily with some mainstays, including the salad bar, pakoras, gulab jamun, certain meat curries and so on. I had to come a couple times in order to get the chicken tikka masala as part of the buffet.  I believe the food is among the best that Calgary's northeast has to offer. The environment is very modern and very clean. The owners are very friendly and truly appreciative.  Definitely recommended if you're in the area. The lunch buffet, which is about $15/person, comes with a free drink as well. I'd recommend the masala chai!"}
{"text":"Indian food has a tendency to be one sided in flavour profiles which is why I find Hot Million to be outstanding. Each and every dish I've ever eaten here is complex and rich and flavourful. The owners are the nicest and friendliest around which only makes the dining experience here that much better. I'm here weekly and it never fails to impress me."}
{"text":"Pretty good Indian food however they are pretty pricey compared to other restaurants in the NE. Although it is called hot million so perhaps it's for millionaires."}
{"text":"Tried the lunch buffet. The options were limited but good. The matar paneer and mutton curry were delicious. The unlimited Naan was great as well. For the price...about $15 a person, you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"At the request of a follower this is my Haiku to indian food  Gramasala dreams Tasty morsels in my mouth Curry sweats uh oh!     I hope its right.  There you go Dale.    Anyways,  the service here was excellent.  Our server was a sweet young girl who gladly answered all our questions.   Asked if we'd like more ' gravy' with the Tikka Masala to eat with the butter naan.  I had delicious vegetarian paneer dish.  Portions are large could be enough for two.     The Aloo tikki starter almost blew me off my chair.   Chana on a potatoe patty.  The potatoe is the stream boat that delivers the chana into my mouth.    14.95 lunch buffet.   Also they have take out"}
{"text":"Their food is amazing! My SO and I went for their lunch buffet, incredible. My SO said, \"I need to go for another round, it's so good but I can't stop,\" and we heard another man behind us say the same thing. The service was hospitable and swift, indulging in casual yet comfortable conversation. The naan was fresh, crisp, and fluffy. I forgot what the green sauce was called, but it is amazing. All of the curries were pleasantly spiced, fish pakora was great, all potato/vegetable items were delicious. My SO was exploring Indian cuisine for one of the first times, and he is now a big fan. We will definitely be returning! For 15 dollars a person, you definitely can't go wrong."}
{"text":"I've only been here a couple of times and was blown away by the food! The flavour profiles are so in depth compared to the monotone, stereotypical flavours you find in your average Indian restaurant. If you're into Gol Gappas, theirs are probably the best I've had in Canada (I've tried amazing ones in India and these are up there!)"}
{"text":"Great lunch buffet for an inexpensive sat/sun meal at a smaller location.   The highlight was their delicious garlic naan.  I can't eat it but my lunch party said it was outstanding!   Good quality food although the butter chicken had more tomatoe than I prefer.  Very clean and friendly ."}
{"text":"I think their lunch buffet is one of the best in Calgary, and very reasonably priced. A friend and I went on a Saturday and received some great service as well as some well prepared food. There was goat curry, butter chicken, tandoori chicken, fish pakoras,  vegetable pakoras,  and four vegetable madras dishes as well as the fresh salad bar with a couple of veggie yogurt dishes to sooth your palate, and gulab for dessert. Just a very nice variety of food to have for a nice lunch buffet."}
{"text":"Great service no doubt, out of 3 entree i ordered one was great. Palak lamb and other two so so.   Waitress was friendly and engaged us in conversation. Looked like a family owned restaurant. There was a conference going on for 20 odd people and they were so loud and no respect for ther tables around. Restaurant management did not botjer to tome them down. That is why its a 3 star."}
{"text":"We tried this restaurant because it had the highest rating on skip the dish and we are in love! We ordered the chicken chow mein which had the perfect medley of veggies and the chicken tikki masala (hot) it was so delicious!! I couldnt get enough sauce on my naan bread. Careful because spicy means spicy, but in the most flavorful way! We really enjoyed our meals."}
{"text":"Excellent Food! And very Good service. The lunch buffet is AWESOME! Best pakuras I have had! Great variety! Very fresh. Super satisfying!"}
{"text":"Good Indian lunch buffets have been lacking lately in the NE (very odd).  Clay Oven was my previous favourite; Hot Million now takes its spot!  Their dining area is rightly sized and organized for mid to large sized parties (6-12) people at a table if needed.  As soon as you walk in the aromas take you to the place you want to me, India.  The gentleman who helped us was very friendly.  In a lot of ethnic restaurants you get the cold shoulder, not at Hot Million.  Our person was able to strike a conversation with us and it didn't feel awkward or contrived.  We pounced on the buffet right away.  Their salad bar is quite good with an assortment of fruits, veggies and cold pastas.  There was a wide assortment of main dishes as well.  From paneer to masala your taste buds will thank you.  The pakora was amazing and butter chicken was there too!  A lot of lunch places skip the butter chicken at lunch and only put it out at dinner.  Not this place, they go all out.  If you have a sweet tooth they have really good gulab jamun and ras malai out for the taking.  I enjoy mixing these in with my savoury dishes to balance everything out.  With a nice, clean and well decorated dining room, great food and good service it is well worth the $15 (approx) price.  My mouth is watering right now for Hot Million!"}
{"text":"We stopped here while visiting Calgary.  Picked it based on reviews and we were not disappointed.  We est Indian frequently and this place is top shelf.  Somosas came with yummy sauce.  Marsala and Butter chicken were both really good.  Nice naan too.  Everything was flavorful.  I asked for spicey and they got it perfect.  Restaurant was stylish and clean.  Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"First time ordering from this place and definitely my last. The food didn't taste good at all and the roti bread was burned. Tasted awful."}
{"text":"We had a special request of the restaurant: to cook dishes with no salt in them due to a diet restriction.  The restaurant obliged and the 3 dishes we ordered came out made with no salt!  We ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala, Okra Masala and the Chickpea Curry.  There was basmati rice as well.  The food was so tasty even without the salt!  Amazing chef and we applaud the restaurant!  We'll be back for more no-salt food."}
{"text":"After dining here for dinner just over ten times now, I can honestly say this Indian restaurant consistently creates incredible Indian dinner cuisine. My wife and I are Indian food connoisseurs, and we rate Hot Million both a top Indian restaurant and a top restaurant in the city. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Good buffet. Service could be a bit better and buffet choices are slightly limited for the price. Good place to start if you are new to Indian food."}
{"text":"Yummy enough and not very busy most of the time.  I'm not a big fan of their malia kofta, as I usually really enjoy it. Not my go to for Indian food but if I'm in the area"}
