{"text":"I keep wanting to like this place, but every time I come I am disappointed by something. The food is fairly tasty and different than the typical deli. But for example, today I ordered a BLT and got a sandwich with a bunch of bacon crumbs thrown on it and 2 tiny tomatoes. BLT's I've had here before were not this bad. It's stuff like this which frustrates me about The Spot. It's not consistent. I think they were busy and literally threw my sandwich together. But that's no excuse."}
{"text":"Came for brunch.  Was able to get a table pretty quickly.  Diverse menu and food was very tasty.  Got the gorgonzola bacon burger    Usually gorgonzola can easily overpower the food it's served with but it was nicely balanced."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I love locally owned restaurants. I would much rather give my hard earned dollar to a mom and pop restaurant than a large national chain. However, after our multiple disappointments and frustrations with our visits and delivery orders, my wife and I are done with the Spot.   The food is overpriced for what it is, but when the planets perfectly align you can get a good meal. The problem is that every order is gamble and too often we have lost.   Portions, consistency, flavor and customer service are spotty at best. Of the 6 or so delivery orders we have made only 1 has been error or hassle free. Food has been delivered cold, with extremely small portions and consistently missing ordered items or food that was not remotely close to what we ordered. We have placed lunchtime orders, then received a call indicating that they had run out of meat and would have to come in to receive our refund.    I can live with the terribly cramped dinning area and understand that everyone has a bad day, but the complete lack of professional customer service is mind blowing! They make customers  feel responsible for their error and make it clear that it is an inconvenience  for them to rectify mistakes.  I hate leaving negative reviews but after giving the Spot so many chances, I do not feel as if they values my patronage. And honestly, they don't appear to value their business much either."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a great dinner last night and plan to return soon. Love the atmosphere and the service was flawless.  But what about the food?  Great value and delicious. Highly recommend the potato chips and the new take on tuna and noodles.  Our group also loved the chicken paprikash and the poor man's paella.  Wonderful addition to the east side."}
{"text":"Even though this place is very tiny, I really like the feel of it.  It kind of reminds me of some of the restaurants in San Francisco and since that was home for me once upon a time, this place evokes feelings of nostalgia.  I had the summer salad and a side of fries.  Both dishes had huge portions of food.  The description of the salad was better than the actual flavors.  That's not to say it was bad; it just sounded better when I was checking it out on the menu.  The fries were big steak fries served piping hot with just the right amount of salt.  I'd go back just for the fries.  They have a lot on their menu, so I definitely want to go back to give some other dishes a try."}
{"text":"3 for 3 so far - a cozy and delicious spot to eat! Great dinners, tried the skate and the chicken paprikash, yum... Will definitely be back. You could go here solo, on a date, or with friends."}
{"text":"Meatball sandwich was okay. Kale potato salad disgusting.  Tastes rotten.   Weird vibe...I was only person in restaurant at 12.30 pm.   Will not return."}
{"text":"This place is very cute. We stopped into buy a drink while out and about and the girl at the register was having a tuff time taking a phone order. While waiting to pay for our cups the owner chatted with us and eventually she gave us our drinks for free. Such a cool spot with awesome decor and a fabulous owner; can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Great new place for the neighborhood. Tenney needed another non-bar food dinner restaurant. Creative entrees, good wine list, and delectable desserts. Service was excellent, and the ambience is very cozy. We've made it a weekly tradition. Nice looking outdoor patio that will be a great addition next spring!"}
{"text":"A family member brought a sandwich from here and found a pubic hair in it. When she took it back and told them, they laughed at her. If I could shut this place down I would! Disgusting, immature staff."}
{"text":"Thinking I would play it safe my first time here, I ordered the Asian Steak Salad.  You can't ruin salad, right? Bleh! The steak was a cheap cut that was chewy and fatty. The mandarin oranges tasted like they came out of a can and the lettuce was wilted. Oh the apple bread was stale. Won't be paying a visit here again which is too bad as I live within walking distance."}
{"text":"We like it! We are here for the first time tonight and my wife and I both really liked the sandwiches we ordered. We live right by it. Took the sandwiches home and enjoyed them. Awesome work you guys!"}
{"text":"I went to The Spot about a month ago.  I am due for another visit back.  I had the sliders (one of each kind) and my wife had a chicken sandwich.  We both agreed that the food was good.  The atmosphere is very cool inside, but I wish it was a larger restaurant!  I love that they offer happy hour.  I had beer from a local brewery and my wife had a glass of wine with our meals.    This is a great place to have a nice casual meal, especially when the weather is nice so you can enjoy the patio seating.  I wouldn't expect to be in and out of this restaurant as fast as you would a McDonald's, so plan accordingly.  Also, they deliver to a very restricted area via beach cruiser...very unique!  I would hate to be a delivery rider in 110+ degree weather!"}
{"text":"I need to give it another try because a lot of folks I know like this place. Everyone was super friendly, but it took a long time get our food and she. It arrived it was very average at best. If you look at my other ratings, I'm not a negative nelly but was pretty disappointed with the value/quality for the price ratio. I'll probably try it again at some point and based on what others have said, I'll probably have a better experience. Give it a go and see what you think for yourself!"}
{"text":"First the good.... cute, good location.  Now the rest.  We decided to try The Spot after hearing how great it was.  We arrived at about 4:15pm on Friday Halloween.  We decided to tak it to go, to ensure we were home for the tricker treaters.  45 minutes later we got our order (classic sliders and the bike rider BLT).  There were 2 males working in the kitchen, one with a beard and no hairnet/beard net over it and another.  Although everyone seemed very nice, they chit chatted more than they seemed to cook.  Boys, if you would move your hands as fast as you move your mouth, amazing things could be accomplished.    I realize it was a Friday, however after observing them for a bit, it appeared that they were making one meal at a time.  No multi-tasking going on here.  Food was ok, certainly not worth a 45 minute wait, especially when Joe's Farm Gill is right across the street.     I think they should rename the bike rider BLT to BLTN - better late than never."}
{"text":"This place always manages to mess up our order. EVERYTIME. I don't know HOW, but they do and I still gave them many chances.   Well, today is the day I stop. I ordered a Southwest scramble and had it delivered to my house: I only got the steak and no eggs. My husband had to run back out to get the rest of it after we tipped for a delivery. Seriously? And on top of it all, they don't ever offer to make anything better for us. They have horrible customer service. Absolutely horrible.   Oh, and after we picked up the eggs, we got a tiny piece of scramble that looked like somebody's left overs.  This place is a joke! Never giving them my business EVER again. I rather go to McDonalds."}
{"text":"A strong start for a promising place.  Billing itself as a neighborhood pub with European flair, The Spot hits the mark.  The building formerly housing Mildred's Sandwich Shop has been beautifully redone with wood booths, a cozy back bar, and lovely outdoor enclosed deck.  The menu is small, reasonable, and inventive but not pretentious.  Appetizers include fresh potato chips with creamy Gorgonzola cheese, artichoke spread, scallops, a fantastic cheese plate, and a vegetable charcuterie.  The chef, Joe Tachovsky, built the menu at Samba when it first opened, so if you know how amazing their salad bar is you can guess how confidently he handles vegetables.  The prices are reasonable, along the lines of 8-14 for entrees.  The burgers are rock solid, (try The Spot burger, with a wedge of chevre tucked into the meat), main dish salads are lovely, and the churrasco from Samba makes a well loved appearance.  There is a small but well balanced beer, wine, and cocktail list.  They have only been open for a week, and I will add to this review once I've tried a few more things and the staff has rolled out all of the regular specials and settled into a groove.  For now, especially if you live in the neighborhood, head over and welcome a place where you are pretty well guaranteed a polished meal.   A nice midpoint between Forequarter and the pizza/coffee houses/bars that are otherwise in walking distance for Tenney neighborhood folks"}
{"text":"I'm on the fence between four stars and five...but I'll give The Spot five since it just opened recently.   The food is excellent and incredibly affordable. Top-notch entrees for $8 or $10. I tried the burger, to get a benchmark against other restaurants, and it was delicious.  The beer list is what you would expect at any good Madison restaurant, which is very good, but the cocktails list stands above most places, excepting places like Forequarter that are known for their cocktails. I could see going to The Spot just for drinks (but beware - there are only five barstools...it's not what you would call \"a bar\").  The only possible downside was that some of the staff was perhaps a little *too* attentive, which makes sense when you realize they only have nine tables to give all their attention to, and they just opened and are trying to make a good impression. But they definitely are making a good impression...so hopefully in another month or two they'll relax into their stride a bit, and will be worth each of the five stars.  $40 for two entrees and two fancy cocktails."}
{"text":"i always hit a place multiple times before i write a review...I love local owned food concepts.  non-chain.  Wanted this place to be a home-run...i've been here 4 times.   Decor is nice, but location is small and tight.  downstairs seating you will be surrounded by people in line.  Upstairs IS cool...if you can get it.  But most seating upstairs is for \"hanging out\" not super easy to east.  Again, if you have a group and can take over the loft, you'll enjoy it.  except for the \"stink-eye\" you get from everyone else coming in that can't sit there.  Otherwise, you sit outside.  The Service: basically, you'll only encounter staff at the counter when you order.  neutral.  Food is made to order.  Menu: promising.  lots of options for breakfast and a different menu for lunch/dinner.  Price:  $1 - $2 high for each item.    Food: 7/10. we've had multiple sandwiches, flatbreads, Breakfast Burritos.  We liked the Mac'n'Cheese (topped w bread crumbs).  Still looking for SOMETHING here that makes me want to come back once a month.  haven't found it yet..."}
{"text":"The place is small, very small, and when I went with my 2 kiddos and hubby it was busy. We wanted to look at the menu before we ordered, but we kept getting moved around because the soda machine needed to be adjusted and then people were trying to get to the restroom, and others were trying to find a place to sit, and finally another group came in and wanted to look at the menu as well. It was a little hectic just getting ready to order.  Once we ordered, we went upstairs to eat, because my daughter thought it was totally cool. Well, it was cool. In fact, when the air came on, it was FREEZING! The door was open and it was February, so I don't know why the air came on at all.Our napkins and anything not nailed down ended up flying every where. The poor people under us got a napkin shower. The upstairs is cute, but not friendly for eating. The tables are tiny and couches are comfortable but hard to eat flatbreads or salads at. As you go upstairs they have a chalkboard sign saying that you can rent the upstairs out for company meetings and mom's groups. It is not that big.  The food was pretty good. I got the turkey sandwich which was yummy. My daughter got a grilled cheese, and the cheese wasn't even melted, and her fried were cold before they were exposed to the arctic blast. My husband got a the bbq chicken flatbread, and it was pretty good as well.  I am not dying to go back, and I don't think I really will."}
{"text":"The first time we had dinner at The Spot was on Valentine's Day and truth be told it was terrible. Our Salad looked like bad left overs and didn't taste much better. The chicken sandwich and fries were greasy soggy and heavy tasting. I was so disappointed.  HOWEVER 2 nights ago we decided to give it another go. I'm a big fan of local resturants plus I get that all new businesses take a minute to work out the kinks. Anyways our meals was FANTASTIC! Chicken sandwich was so yummy and the fries were crispy perfect. The Aegean flat bread is to die for it was so good! Also the staff is kind, polite, helpful and everything was super clean. Kudos to the owners on a well trained staff. There customer service was flawless!"}
{"text":"My gf and I stopped in for dinner thinking it was \"the spot\" to be. Wrong! My grilled sandwich was cold and the cheese wasn't melted, and my salad was rubbery. My gf's Philly cheesesteak sandwich was the worst I'd ever seen / tasted. There were big slabs of dry meat up in there. The only consolation was the sweet potato fries. I won't be going back to \"the spot\"."}
{"text":"I don't usually give multiple second chances, but I have with this place.  The food is good and it's near by, but the service is the worst.   I cannot believe this is a family run business.  They treat customers worse than any fast food chain out there.    I'm done.  Joe's will get my business instead."}
{"text":"Well I gave this place one last try! After 4 visits in the last year I can't say anything good. The food is poor, not fresh, no attempt to even make it look appealing on my plate almost looks like it fell on the floor and someone scrambled to pick it up and put it on my plate. (Didn't really happen at least I hope not!) lol They make it clear the moment you walk in the door that they don't really care that you are there so I definitely didn't bother to mention the food was so bad we didn't even eat it! Just took it as a loss and moved on. I would suggest that whoever the owner is hire a good manager to supervise the immature teenagers that don't care about your business and clean up the place. Then crack the whip and get things on track before this little restaurant fails. Hate to be so harsh but the menu, service and cleanliness has been horrible on all visits. Good luck to u"}
{"text":"The spot  was the spot. . Omg amazing  sliders and the onion  rings  were  out of this world.. very  friendly  service cool hang out to with pastries.  Yummy"}
{"text":"Had lunch there today. Good food, however the girl at the register could have been much friendlier. Much improvement needed at the register. Again food was good."}
{"text":"Just came back from dinner here -- wow.  Everything was superb.  A pan-fried walleye over risotto was tender, with an eggy crust that added to the flavor.  My cioppino was similarly delicious, cooked perfectly (which can be hard to do with mixed seafood), great flavor to the broth.  Service was attentive without being at all obtrusive, and prices were reasonable.  We will be back."}
{"text":"As a new person to the area, I'm constantly looking for great places to go to in Gilbert. I went into The Spot on Wednesday. First of all, may I just say that the vibes in this restaurant are fantastic! The colors, the little area upstairs, all amazing. I was greeted by a very nice woman by the name of Christi, and she immediately made me feel welcome. She was very helpful on helping me decide on what to get. I ordered the original sliders with onion straws and mac and cheese, then went upstairs to relax on their sofas and relax. Quickly, the food was delivered, and it was fantastic! Some of the best mac and cheese I've ever had! It was a very satisfying experience at The Spot. I can assure you that I'll be going back!"}
{"text":"This place is wonderful! I had the egg whites veggie omelet and it tasted fantastic! I find it cool that you can see them preparing your food in the back, gives me a reassuring feeling. It could use more seats but since winter is coming, sitting outside won't be a problem. Quality food for the price."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Ordered delivery and the food ways good, but the order was incomplete. They said they would send someone back, but never did. I called  to speak to the manager but he wasn't there and I was told he would call me the next day. Sadly that did not happen. After calling a second time I was told again he wasn't there. It must be nice to not have to work, or care if you even have customers. I suppose they can do that since they charge you for a full meal, you pay for it, but you really only get half."}
{"text":"Great food, service, and atmosphere in Gilbert! Shared a wonderful steak sandwich on the patio. They even offer local bike food delivery."}
{"text":"Good food l got the breakfast burrito called the California Big Daddy burrito.  I liked it a lot cool place. It's a hole in the wall type of place but really nice and clean.  Everyone was really nice. We will be back again. Also when we checked in we received 10% off our meal so if you try it its worth checking in."}
{"text":"We live about a half mile from this place, and I've been waiting for it to open! My husband, 5 year old daughter, and I stopped in on their opening weekend, and man was it crowded, which was great news. Clearly, lots of others were waiting for it to open too! Even though the line was long and it was loud in there, the cashier and the owner were all calm, cool, and friendly--very warm, in fact. Didn't get flustered. What kind of stinks, though, is that the restaurant is so narrow, those in line are breathing down the necks of the diners to their left. Plus, the servers can't get out to deliver the food to those waiting. Not sure how they could re-do that, but it's worth considering.  We ordered ours to go, and I was disappointed when I got home to find that my veggie sandwich was merely mushrooms, spinach, and onions, thrown on dry bread. Nothing like the description, which included goat cheese, avocado, and toasted bread with some sort of aioli or dressing. It wasn't very good at all. My husband and daughter both enjoyed theirs, though, so I decided to go back and give them the constructive criticism. Not to be a pain, but to honestly let them know what I thought so they could improve. I get it--they're crowded, it's opening weekend, etc., but how will they know if we don't fill them in? And I want local businesses like this to succeed! I expected nothing--it was just a friendly bit info, but the owner insisted they make me another one. That was very sweet of her, and I was very appreciative. Even with all the trimmings, I wasn't a huge fan of the sandwich, but there wasn't anything wrong with it at all, it was just personal preference. I'm glad I tried it!  Side note: I don't know if they bake their own desserts or if they get them from somewhere else, but they are amazing. My daughter had the cherry Dr. Pepper cupcake and it was delicious.   I'm anxious to try this place again...and have them deliver! Good luck to you, The Spot! We're rooting for you! (and thank you for giving Joe's some competition in the area--they need it. But you didn't hear it from me!)"}
{"text":"Saddest day ever. They took poutine (fries cheese and gravy) off the menu!  I had just told all of my Canadian friends that this place has the best poutine and now it's gone.   This place, although now poutine less, is still pretty good. Quality and tasty food at pretty decent prices. It's not a big place but it has charm. And the employees are very friendly!    Great BLT today but would have been better with some poutine.   I'd definitely give it 4 stars but without the poutine it's lost a star for me just because now it doesn't have that unique dish you can't find anywhere else in the east valley."}
{"text":"Good food..the chicken sandwich is pretty good. The salads look delish. The turkey sandwich would be good if they put it on some real bread.. (they put it on a thin piece of bread and it just falls apart and ruins the whole sandwich..what a mess)."}
{"text":"The concept and wanting to support local business is what brought us into The Spot this afternoon. The place is very small and has charming trendy urban decor that I really liked and the loft area I thought a brilliant use of a small space, unfortunately that was the end of  my excitement over finding a new local  eatery.  I ordered the Bike Rider(I think) a BLT with pesto mayo, avacodo( additional 1.50)  and spinach on Texas toast  with \"creamy\" Mac n cheese.  It came with no spinach, no pesto mayo,incredibly greasy and just cooked enough bacon to be safe to eat.   The Mac n cheese was bland and looked as though it was from the day before and reheated.  The entire meal was incredibly greasy. The place was so dirty.  I could not sit comfortably because the bench style seats kept flipping up and you could see all the food and filth. I wanted to sit in the loft area but it was full of uncleared dishes which no one cared to remove the whole time we were there. The teenagers working the register and kitchen seemed bothered by customers and unwelcoming. They changed a huge trash can and dragged the bag full of garbage practically over my husband while we were both still eating to bring it through the dinning area to the back . Disgusting!  I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Quick and casual. We ordered a couple of sandwiches and sat upstairs in the little nook over looking the entrance. Young and friendly staff. We'll be back to try the cupcakes."}
{"text":"The Spot is like many Madison restaurants, in that it can be totally hit or miss with both the food and the service. Sometimes, it's phenomenal and others it's incredibly awful.  This past time, our waitress forgot about us (and two other tables) so after waiting 15 minutes with no sign of her after she seated us, I went in to check. She and the other waitress/bartender were hanging out at the bar and playing on their phones. To their credit, they were apologetic but it was still annoying. She finally came out, took our orders, and then disappeared inside for another prolonged period. We had to ask her to bring us waters twice, because she again forgot, and then when we got our mussels, they were rotten.  Yup. So rotten that other customers thought someone was taking out the garbage because they smelled so revolting. Finally the waitress came out to check on us and we told her they were rotten and she didn't believe us and finally agreed to take them away. She offered to make more, but clearly the whole batch was not fit for eating. She didn't offer any way to make it up to us or offer any other items we could order. She didn't even apologize, and brought the check like she was trying to rush us out the door.   I'm really disappointed in The Spot. We've been loyal to them for 2+ years, and are sad not to be going back."}
{"text":"Low key, high quality, relaxed service and a simple noveau-bistro style menu that delivers a lot of bang for the buck.  Want to get away from the crowd at Sardine and have a better meal for less?  Enjoy."}
{"text":"Get away from the Capital Square for dinner! We love 'The Spot' for a nice date.  Small and cozy Atmosphere. Great food selection priced well for the high quality. Service has always been friendly and informative."}
{"text":"I am sorry to say I cannot agree with all these positive reviews.  My husband, mom, and I tryed it tonight and can guarantee you I will not return.  The service was horrible.  We waited 35 minutes for a turkey sandwich, blt, and flatbread.  There was one family that ordered ahead of us.  Also, running around the entire time were about 7 children all under the age of about 12 and all appearing to be related to the owners.  They seemed to be enjoying their dinners, while we were still waiting for our turkey sandwich.  I had to go ask where ours was and was told they didn't put the order in and couldn't find it.  Several minutes later it was determined that they had made it, it was just sitting on the counter.  They claim \"it had just come out\", however I find it hard to believe it took that long.  Also, I don't think that health inspectors would care much for a young child with a cast on her arm serving food.  I certainly didn't.  Doubtful she had a food handler's card.  Not only is the space ridiculously small, there is not ample seating.  To make things worse, the owner was taking up seats while he sat and chatted with a friend and talked on the phone.  If you see your customers standing waiting for tables and having to take their food to go because you and children are taking up tables, perhaps you should make yourself an office.    The food was poor to say the least.  The macaroni and cheese was hard, tasteless, and cold (my guess would be because it sat on the counter for quite some time).    Overall,  It seems like a great hangout for the owner's children and friends, however the food is overpriced and it is very poorly run.  Joe's Farm Grill-don't worry...no competition here!!!"}
{"text":"I went with my fiancé and best friend to The Spot last weekend and we had a 100% amazing experience. I cannot wait to go back.  We only had to wait about 15 minutes for our table, and the host directed us to the bar, showed us where we could put our coats, and would update us on the status of our table (which I really appreciated).  We all immediately got a crush on the bartender lady - she was super nice, seemed like a badass, and seemed to really care if we liked our drinks (and she said she makes them how she would want them made for herself, which was really nice to know). You HAVE to try the George Brown cocktail - it's gingery and passion fruity and delicious.   We shared the Gorgonzola chips and the vegetarian charcuterie (which was such a cool idea and everything on the platter was exquisite). I got the Spot burger which blew my mind. I will definitely be back for another one. We didn't get dessert since we were too full, but I'm sure that would have knocked our socks off, too.  Can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"Great food had the sliders with one of each different kind. Green chilli definitely my favorite with bacon slider a  close second.  The Blu cheese is definitely  strong u really have to like Blu cheese. It came with Mac and cheese which was pretty good but the onion fries/rings were the bomb."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place out for sometime. It's hard not to find a chain out in these regions unless you eat across the street at Joes or head downtown. So I was disappointed. I ordered the chicken salad sandwich. The best part was the fresh grilled meat they used. However, it had WAY too much mayo dressing for my taste. There was other things in it but I couldn't taste it because all I could taste was mayo. I also ordered to have avocado added but that was missed. Probably for the best. The pasta salad was ehhh.  Not good but not bad, bland for lack of a better word. My husband order the club that looked great and he liked it. However his salad, the greens were rotting. You know the green slime you get when mixed greens stay in a container. That was half his salad. Yuck! Unfortunately, there are no wait staff and the girl that brings your food is not interested in hearing what you have to tell her. So no chance in fixing the issues.  So I will give them one more chance to try a different sandwich but I'm saying away from the salads."}
{"text":"Really excellent service. The inside is very sweetly done with lots of wood (although Mildred's had charm, too) and made for nice ambience on our date. My bf had the Spot burger (a different bun might hold up better but it had great flavor and prosciutto was tasty) and we both had tap beers that tasted great (not flat pours here). I had the scallop entree that was on special and it was fabulous...scallops were done to perfection and the figs were a yummy touch. Will definitely be back, hopefully with room for sorbet or pecan pumpkin cheesecake next time!"}
{"text":"There are a lot of restaurants that have great food or great customer service here in the Valley but very few places that offer both.  The Spot is a rare restaurant that offers both.  It is not super-duper fancy or anything but the food is SO worth it.  Plus, it is so hard to find a good restaurant that delivers out here in the suburbs, but these guys do!    In fairness, I have only ordered delivery from this particular establishment so I cannot review the \"in dining\" experience.    Disclaimer:  I RARELY order a salad from a restaurant because they are all pretty much the same....lettuce...tomato...diet meat....blah blah blah.  I can whip that up at home.  If I go to a restaurant I want something TASTY.  I have not, nor will I likely EVER, order a salad from this, or any other, restaurant that has SO MANY other great options.  Anyway, here is the review:  The Burger: GET DOUBLE MEAT!!! You won't regret it....extra bacon, extra burger...totally worth it.  Somehow, this place manages to cook the burger all the way through (no pink), yet keep it SUPER juicy.  Idk how they manage this but the result is AWESOME. The first time I thought it was some magical fluke...but then it kept happening.  I love it.  Mac N' Cheese: It is PERFECT.  It has become my new \"go to\" condiment, replacing ranch dressing or nacho cheese.  I put it on the burger AND on the fries.  You WILL NOT regret it.  It is even good cold.  My only complaint is that it doesn't come in a big enough size.  I want to buy a GALLON of it.  Poutine: Fries with gravy AND cheese curds!? Who thinks of this!!!  Full disclosure....I can't tell if the gravy is homemade or from a mix but it is so good, I don't even care.  Put the Mac N' Cheese on this too and you have a SUPERFOOD!  Sliders: Small, juicy and served on a bun that is a little sweet.  VERY good....also served with fries.  Get the Southwest Sliders and PUT MAC N\" CHEESE ON THEM!!  Fries/Onion Strings: Run of the mill.  Basically both are a means to get the mac n' cheese inside my face. Fries have always been crispy when delivered which is pretty solid when it comes to delivery for french fries.  Other stuff, wraps, omelets, etc: My girlfriend orders some of the healthy stuff sometimes and she always says it's good.  I don't know....probably will never try it unless they run out of burgers, mac n' cheese or poutine.    Customer Service: True story: We had a very negative experience once with this restaurant (very late delivery, cold food).  I emailed the restaurant and got a response THAT DAY from the OWNER, who actually offered a decent explanation.  He was EXTREMELY apologetic and rectified the situation within the week.  Sometimes the best way to judge a place is how they deal with a negative experience or feedback.  This place nailed it. Every employee we have spoken with has been friendly and kind  BOTTOM LINE: The food is OUTSTANDING. It is even good cold. They serve breakfast all day.  They deliver so I can enjoy this food IN MY UNDERWEAR.  If you are a man and you are taking a date (or ordering food from home for a date!), she should be able to find some salad or wrap to enjoy...they even have vegetarian options.  If you are a woman, you can take your man there because he can get a HUGE burger and slap mac n' cheese on it to make it a SUPER BURGER.  EDIT: Just ordered from The Spot again....super hot and yummy and fast delivery (just under 30 mins!). It is worth noting that Girlfriend ordered the \"California Breakfast blah blah blah\"....to be honest, I stopped listening after she said the word \"California\" and the words \"egg whites\".  Anyway, it came hot and fancy looking (with sauce drizzled in a VERY fancy way on it) but had too much green on it for me to pay attention.  Clearly it was really good because she finished it, and she NEVER finishes any meal....she is all into fitness and health and stuff so evidently you can get healthy AND delicious food here too.  It should be noted that I did actually eat her hash-browns.  They were crispy (even delivered) and hot and they soaked up the cheese from my mac n' cheese and the grease from my burger. Also, they lady on the phone that took our order was super nice."}
{"text":"I really hope nobody finds out about my spot, The Spot. Original sliders with onion rings, and mac n cheese is soooo good. It is a must try for all new customers."}
{"text":"I am giving it 5 stars. The back patio was cozy and comfortable. The staff was gracious and friendly, and provided great service. The food was great, the wine & cocktail selection was also terrific. Indoor ambiance, a bit mixed. The back bar, super cute, the front booths a bit awkward but hardly a deal breaker.  I went in mid-October, and it was the perfect time to enjoy it!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and the food is ok. I say just ok because you can tell they are trying to be fresh but I feel like a lot of the food I can just pull out of my freezer at home. I really did enjoy they're desserts they have the cup cakes are great."}
{"text":"Dirty tables, soiled floors, and bad food.  According to a dated publication posted on the restaurant's wall,  it was the owner's long time dream to open a restaurant.  The publication shocks me for two reasons: the restaurant is dirty and the food is awful... that doesn't feel dreamy to me.   I ordered the sliders.  The wife ordered a turkey club sandwich.  Safe bets considering this is our first visit.  It was hard to find an open table and that's not because the restaurant was busy (at the top of the lunch hour, we were the only patrons)... we couldn't find a clean table.  I guess the dream didn't factor in employees who would rather drink lattes and watch football games than clean tables and floors.  Then came the food. The sliders were clumsily made, the onion straws were cold,  and the mac n' cheese was unseasoned and bland.  My wife's  sandwich was mediocre and  elementary (in my lazy college days, I made better sandwiches with half the sobriety of the restaurant cooks... granted I'm making a big assumption). In short, save your money and spare yourself the nightmare... find another spot."}
{"text":"The Spot strikes me as the kind of place that belongs in a hip urban neighborhood.  The bikes parked outside with delivery baskets make me even more jealous of the people who live in one of the nearby neighborhoods as they can get eco friendly delivery of tasty food.    The menu tends towards classic favorites with some twists.  My sandwich was delicious; the toppings were clearly fresh.  I didn't try any of the desserts (yay self control!) but they looked delicious.  Like I said, a place like this as a sidewalk cafe in a hip urban area wouldn't be at all out of place."}
{"text":"Yuck. Went there for breakfast. Breakfast is the most basic and simple meal to execute in a restaurant setting. What they produced was an insult.   To start with, the coffee plunger pot was empty when I arrived and I had to tell the staff. When I went for a second cup, it was empty again, and they were not very busy!   The potatoes were deep fried. Not even \"real\" home fries. The scrambled eggs were dry even though they had the jalapeño sauce on them. Really? This is breakfast folks.   Then I watched a staff person bussing the tables. Brilliant to remove the dirty dishes and didn't even wipe down the tables! Oh, and the empty salt shaker,  just moved it, rather than fill it."}
{"text":"You definitely WANT to like this place because it is cute and friendly, and darn it, the spot should be the place to meet! right? The menu consists of salads, sandwiches, and basic, simple american food.  I was treated to lunch, so I wasn't paying attention to pricing, but about $9/sandwich w/fries before drink.  The first thing you notice is that this place is tiny, not the type of place you except in Gilbert. It would be normal in SF or NY size wise.  So small that it makes it tight to get around the self-serve beverage section, the tables set up nearby, and the ordering counter.  But the counter person was friendly and nice. I ordered the BLT, which came on Texas toast.  We sat outside, which was enjoyable. Maybe they can consider misters in the summer, or heaters in the winter along with a overhead cover or umbrellas? It is Arizona, so the weather isn't super ideal most of the time, and that would alleviate some of the tight seating indoors.  On to the food: it was brought out by one of the servers.  Flavors were decent, and the BLT was hot.  Bacon, bacon, delicious bacon. So hard to go wrong! Fries were thick cut steak fries, not what I expected, but crunchy and hot.  We sat, ate, and talked for an hour and no one bothered us. Overall, cute, but rather expected american meal. Would be great if they had some daily specials that stepped outside the lines."}
{"text":"We went here recently on a Thursday evening and got a table with no waiting.  Choosing a cocktail was difficult as there were several intriguing options but I settled on the Lorraine, a gin and elderflower liqueur concoction.  It was delicious and well crafted, with just the right amount of \"punch.\"  My companion and I split the Albondigas appetizer, which was a small serving of meatballs simmered in an amazing tomato sauce.  The sauce was rich and tangy and, after we raved about it, our server brought us a serving of bread to sop up the rest.  I ordered the chickpea goulash, which was surprisingly rich, given its simple ingredients.  I also had the sauteed greens, which were a bit salty for my taste but still good.  My companion ordered the Chrurrasco beef, which was definitely the best thing we ate there.  The chimichurri sauce was perfect and the beef was tender and cooked to order.    We split that evening's dessert special, an apple and carmel bread pudding, served wam with vanilla ice cream and whipped cream.  Delicious.  if you know this place from when it was Mildred's, you'll recognize the layout of the booths, but everything has been redone in beautiful wood, dark, rich colors, and indirect lighting.  There's a small bar in the back now and a nice little patio.  If you're thinking of going here, do it now.  I'm sure that once word of mouth starts to spread on this place it will be difficult to get a table, especially since they don't take reservations."}
{"text":"Not a bad little spot!   We went on Saturday night in a group of 8 and it wasn't busy at all. Other people came in, but it seemed like most of them took their food to go. We sat upstairs in the loft area, which was nice, but not anything too special. There are only 2 actual \"tables\" up there, and they are barely big enough to hold 2 plates of food. There are a couple couches and single chairs, with ottomans and for keeping your food/drinks on. It was generally kind of an awkward arrangement.   I got the classic sliders, which were basically 3 small patties (obviously cooked with onions) with cheese and bacon on dinner rolls. They tasted great but were pretty greasy. They also came with some fried onion straws (again, good taste, very greasy) and some macaroni and cheese (I didn't think it was dry, like others have mentioned, but it was very bland).   Based on my meal alone, I probably would have given the place 3 stars, but my husband got the BBQ chicken flatbread, which was very large and quite good, despite the bread itself being a little hard. A couple people in our group ordered salads, which looked great and were served in nice bowls, and someone got the chipotle chicken sandwich and said it was great. We didn't try any desserts but apparently should have.   Overall, the food was decent, and the atmosphere (decor, music, etc.) was pretty cool and relaxed. I can see it being a frustrating place to eat if you go when it's crowded, with the awkward arrangement and limited seating. But we're glad we tried it and will probably go back!"}
{"text":"I have passed The Spot many times and figured I would give it a try.  I arrived at 8:45 on a Saturday and to my surprise, not a car in the parking lot.  The hours posted on the door said they opened at 8, but the \"Open\" sign was not on.  One quick phone call and they confirmed they were in fact open.  We walked in and the girl behind the counter was having a hard time with the computer.  She said \"I just keep hitting the wrong buttons.\"  Meanwhile, there are more people coming in and now the phone is ringing.  Another female employee answers phone, standing right next to the register, so nobody can hear what another is saying. The \"phone girl\" is taking orders, but has not written anything down and is going by memory.  In fact the second phone order she takes, she laughs that \"It's a to go order so if its wrong they won't know until they are gone\".  (A pad of paper would probably help you write down an order to ensure accuracy.)    After finally getting our order paid for we chose to sit at one of the long tables on the first level.  This is  mistake since there is only a small walk way to serve as a line, as well as people bringing out orders and others getting their drinks.  My chair was continually bumped as people moved around. I also felt bad as our party of 2 was now taking up a table for 8.  At least we chose an end so others could have joined us if they didnt mind being part of the line/counter order area.  Food was good, but not great.  I felt it was quite expensive for the amount served.  Toast was dry and no butter or jam was anywhere to be seen.  Went to order another orange juice and stood in line so long that my food then was cold when I got back to it.  (Really pricey for a small bottle of juice $2.85?)   The air conditioner was on full blast so we sat shivering through the meal.  Many people went to sit outside after ordering.    A young man came in and was talking to the other employees that were working.  He must have been an employee as he was talking about the new Yelp reviews.  They kept talking about how they \"keep getting removed\".  This was a reminder to me, that they do review their  reviews... Very important since it could help them.  I could see the seating becoming a problem.  Not sure if there is another way to get more seating in there or not though."}
{"text":"What a cool atmosphere, the owners were awesome and the food was just as good...could'nt ask for more personal service, the big chains could learn from these folks...Thank you guy's for the great experience!!!"}
{"text":"I really like the place and I really like the food. I think it has the potential to be a great restaurant but it is not great. It is slow. It is beyond slow. I went there and ordered 3 burgers to-go. I spent an entire hour waiting for 3 burgers to be cooked. That is absolutely unacceptable for any place. I really want this place to do well but they need to change some things before that happens. I will at least try to make the free dessert assuage my frustrations.  Update: they messed up 2 of 3 orders."}
{"text":"So I have to update that while I still love some of what The Spot has to offer, I am sad to say that the food quality isn't as consistent as it used to be. The menu has some great offerings and wonderful flavors, they just don't pay quite the attention to detail that they used to. For the price points they have, the quality should be on point.   In my initial review I suggested that Joe's Farm Grill had some new competition in town, I must say that is not the case anymore. The bacon used to be so crisp and now it is limp and greasy. The steak sandwich once full of great cuts of meat is now met with gross amounts of fat and grizzle.   I will still continue to eat here as they still have some items that are usually consistent. Another thing that they have going for them is that they are excellent about replacing your order if you are unhappy. I am hoping to see The Spot make a comeback as the food they were serving when they first opened was AMAZING!!!"}
{"text":"A co-worker and I were looking for a new lunch place and were pleasantly surprised by this \"Spot\". Fun atmosphere, good food, and great desserts. The California burrito is definitely my favorite. And I cant leave without getting an apple streusel bar. Biggest downside is without question limited seating. All in all a fun place and recommended."}
{"text":"Just moved here a few months ago and it was one of the first places we tried.. Its really close to our house. Ill start with the positive first, we love the food. We have already been about 7-8 times. We like the sliders, the steak sandwich is really yummy, the steak pizza is out of this world, also love the summer salad with chk and strawberries!!  Its always clean inside.     So the things that could be changed... They only have  2 large tables on the main level unless you sit outdoors or upstairs is seating with coffee like tables. The large tables are fine for a large family, but can be awkward when only 2 people are using it and your family of 4 needs t sit and eat.. I guess its called, eat with your neighbor style.. I think they could put a few smaller tables instead, or high top with stools. In most cases I see only single people or two people eating in there..   Its usually the younger kids working the register, they're not overly friendly.. Just kinda blah.. Today I also noticed a frequent visitor punch card behind the cash register area.. I had to ask for one myself, nobody offered it in all the 8x I've ate there. Weird! I would've been near a free meal by now, or whatever you get since she never explained..  I like this place a lot for the food, but with all the competition in this area I think the service at the cash register could be improved and more inviting and as mentioned the seating inside needs HELP!!! Other than that, the food has been awesome and yummy every time!"}
{"text":"Awesome place. Reminds me a lot of restaurants in Asia and Europe. Casual, good food, loft. Very cute food was good, I like the steak sandwich, and I believe this will become the new \"spot\" no pun intended to hang out at in Gilbert they are pretty crowded on weekends"}
{"text":"They have gourmet style sandwiches, salads, burgers. The sliders and turkey sand were great. Small restaurant and you order at counter. They also have wine and beer!"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING. Quiet, intimate environment. Sophisticated, personal service. And a delicious selection. They made modifications to the meals as we requested and even gave us a free bowl of sorbet.  I cannot recommend highly enough.   Quinn- you are awesome. Brandon and Erica- best chefs in Madison. Thanks for a great meal."}
{"text":"We love the spot! They have great food and feature delicious soups on a daily rotation. The wood floors and booth tables are warm and good looking, and the service has always been spectacular."}
{"text":"Liked this place 2 years ago but went back for the first time in a while recently and this place has gone downhill. We came here and ordered breakfast. The place feels dirty, sticky, and needs to be dusted. Our order took 30 minutes to get to our table. People who came in way after us received their orders first, and when my husband finally asked what was the hold up he was told other people before us were waiting too. They didn't seem very busy, but it took a long time. When our food came, it tasted decent but my husband and I both found hairs on our plates. Looked like an eyelash or something. And, my cup of fresh strawberries were clearly defrosted frozen strawberries. Tasted horrible. We could have made a way better meal at home in half the time for half the cost. Disappointing experience.  The only positive thing was the man taking orders was nice and seemed to be working hard. The issues seem to be something the owner needs to address."}
{"text":"Maybe 3 stars is a little tough but I guess I would have given it a 3.5 if that was an option.  I live close by so I decided to check them out and see what they had to offer. I ordered a BLT sandwich and the steak fries. I also got a cupcake. I wanted a coffee to go with my cupcake but they don't serve coffee. Uhhhhhhhh Really? How do you have a selection of deserts but no coffee? I was told that they \"used to have it but no one wanted it so they got rid of it\". And here I was thinking that they just opened last week. Seems like it would take more than a week of being open to determine that your customers really don't want coffee with their desert.  The sandwich and the fries were good. Not to die for but good for lunch. The cupcake was a whole other issue. It was very very dry. I don't know how long it had been sitting in the case but it was so dry it crumbled everywhere as I took off the wrapper. This is the tough part- there is a place around the corner that is famous for their cupcakes. To compete with that your cupcakes just can't be dry. The service was good but a little much. I was just trying to eat and read my book. I appreciate that they kept asking me every 5 minutes if everything was ok but it was a tad overboard. There is a thing as too much!!  Lastly, I think the people behind the counter need to be trained. I realize they just opened and its a bunch of teenager working but when you have ONE kind of cupcake in the case and you are asked what kind it is- the person should know. Then when they find out what kind it is- it should not be followed up with \"oh I don't even know what that ingredient is\".  My positives: The atmosphere is nice. I will say if you don't like sitting close to other people you don't know, then sit outside. Inside is just one big long table.   The frosting on the cupcake was really good. It really is too bad the cake wasn't so great but the frosting was right on. I have high hopes for this place as it is really close to my house and I will try it again. I don't want to base my opinions on just one experience so I will give it another shot!"}
{"text":"Really good breakfast! The eggs are my favorite and the potatoes are fresh and crispy! I love the cost atmosphere and fun music. My son loves the little pastries. I would recommend this place to my friends."}
{"text":"First time here last weekend.  It's close to my neighborhood, very easy to find. They weren't busy , so we got our food very quickly.  We loved it, small place, yummy food. At least what we got were really good.  My friend got a breakfast sandwich, which looked delicious.  I got the French Toast. Huge portion!!! Very yummy."}
{"text":"I've been to The Spot twice now, and have had pleasant experiences both times.   The first time I went was a beautiful Friday evening, and my boyfriend and I sat on their back patio and had a pre-dinner drink. I had a cocktail called something like the Northern Girl, which had whiskey and hard cider among other things, and was strong and tasty (a hard combination to achieve!). The back patio is very comfortable, and has about 5 tables, one of which has what looks to be a grill. You're right up against other people's back yards, but there is a barrier to give everyone a little privacy.   We enjoyed our patio drinks so much that we decided to come back for dinner another night. My boyfriend and I like to share items at restaurants, and I usually state this when I order. The chef actually divided both of the entrees in half, giving us each our own portions. This was super considerate, and is actually the first time any restaurant has done this for us.   The highlight of the meal was the \"Saltimbocca-wich,\" which we got with the potato salad and mustard greens. YUM. The potato salad is made with a light oil and vinegar dressing, whole-grain mustard, and diced red onion and carrot. Flavorful, light, delicious. The sandwich has a sage-infused chicken breast, prosciutto, mozzarella, and a caper aioli. Not diet fare, but really flavorful and really good. It made me want to come back and try their burger, so I can have an excuse to try another of their yummy-sounding side dishes (braised red cabbage and bacon? OK!).   The \"Poor Man's Paella\" was just OK. There was a nice amount of shrimp and chorizo, but despite that, it just lacked flavor. Perhaps it is named that because it lacks saffron (a really, really expensive seasoning)? But this could have been made up for in some other way, perhaps with a little more heat, or more acid. There just wasn't that richness and depth of flavor that I hope for in a paella.   The decor is well done. For such a small space, they make use of every square foot, and the booths are made from a well polished, beautiful wood. If you're in the neighborhood, it's worth stopping in for at least a cocktail! They have a happy hour Monday through Thursday, 5-7, half off on beer and wine and $2 off cocktails. I know what I'm doing next week."}
{"text":"For a place open just a matter of weeks The Spot seems to be off to a great start.  We arrived to a full house on Saturday evening and settled onto some stools at the bar to enjoy a beer before a table was ready for us.  The bar selection was good and the bartender was enthusiastic and welcoming.  Built within an old house, The Spot is small; there were only about 10 tables and about 4-6 spots at the bar.  Rumor has it there is some outdoor seating but it was a bit too chilly to take advantage of that!  They aren't currently taking reservations but who knows if that will change down the road.  The ambiance is quite nice; freshly done woodwork, soft lighting, and lined with black & white photos on the dark red walls.  If I had my choice, the best seats in the house are probably in the bar area or the booths up by the front windows.  Two of the booths are right by the kitchen window which has pros and cons; some people love \"seeing behind the curtain\" and watching the action.  I, on the other hand, find fluorescent kitchen lights to be my kryptonite so I'd rather stick to the more romantic corners of the space.  The menu had many tempting options on it for both the vegetarian and the carnivore. Prices were reasonable and a lot sounded tasty.  We started with the Baked Artichoke Remikin ($6.50) which was served with pickled carrots and crusty bread.  We enjoyed it thoroughly; it was a good portion for two or three.  For entrees I had the Portabella stew ($11) which I enjoyed and the Mister settled on the Wild Boar Sausage ($14) and was also pleased.  Portions were fair sized, enough for dinner for each of us, not really enough to take home for lunch the next day.  Both entrees were served with a side of cooked greens and polenta.  The greens were good, the polenta was so salty even Mr.-High-Blood-Pressure himself wasn't interested.    This is where The Spot's interest in customer service became evident: our server noticed both of us were bypassing the polenta & asked for feedback, which we provided.  He did say the kitchen team is still tweaking things and trying to improve everything, of course, so they appreciate hearing customer's thoughts on the food. (Well, you know we're not shy!).  We provided feedback on the polenta but assured him that overall they seem to be in great shape.  A few minutes later, the owner offered us a complimentary dessert due to the polentapalooza.  Yum!  Dense chocolate cake, rich and sweet, a perfect end to the meal.  I liked the cozy space, it looks like they'll have some fun specials during the week, there were several things that tempted me on the menu, parking was easy, prices were reasonable, service was great... all in all, we look forward to heading back again."}
{"text":"This place has huge potential but it's very inconsistent. Almost every time we order food for take out we get it home and it's wrong. We aren't even asking for modifications. We often order the spot chicken sandwich. Menu says it has bacon on it. This is the 3rd time we've gotten it and there's no bacon on the sandwiches. The lettuce on the sandwiches is wilted. Another favorite in theory is the classic summer salad. Great when the chicken is good. Not so much when the chicken is overcooked to the point of not being able to chew it. I really want to like this place because I love the concept and the tasty recipes but not sure how many more chance we are willing to give it."}
{"text":"I love the spot and come here regularly. Workers are nice and the food is good!  The BLT is the best!"}
{"text":"It's so good - we've agreed to write this review together.   Authentic truly good food, something to be said for just taking awesome ingredients and not making them so over the top, good, knowledgeable service, and a menu that doesn't confuse - and even offers sides for sandwiches! Takes the best of foodie Madison and makes it accessible.   Cocktails were generous, wines well selected. Smart and kind all the way around.   The best salmon I've had in Madison - getting it truly medium rare made me nervous so I asked - is this OK or too rare - the smart server explained because it's sashimi grade having a cool center is safe. Having the OK that it was safe I could enjoy it. And made us all the more committed to coming back - he addressed a concern, we knew why it was delicious, and we felt OK asking questions.   Because every good review needs to be balanced - the chip appetizer was uneven and has so many competitors in area who do it so well - choose another starter.  Cheers to The SPOT - try it."}
{"text":"This has got to be the newest hidden gem in Madison! How could I have missed this for so long. Thank you to fellow yelpers for pointing this treasure out! Please, it is worth effort to come by even though the roads are torn off right now. It is right next to Sophia's bakery. I'm surprised how pretty it is, wooden floors and wooden booths. the table is kinda wide but if you wanna be intimate, you can sit next to your favorite person instead of on the other side.  Service was top notch, Emily is one of my favorite servers in Madison. She was really humorous and attentive, friendly, making us feel right at home. She even gave us a coupon at the end of the meal to encourage us to visit again! That, and the happy hour Monday to Friday 5-7pm..   The food was amazing, I can't wait to try more!  Artichoke ramekin - the best rendition of artichoke. so good you can't stop dipping. I do prefer the crostini and bread for dipping than rice crackers Quinoa risotto - flavor was amazing. loved the mushrooms and asparagus. quinoa in a risotto, the best idea ever!!!  Salmon - it had good flavor, but I might not get it again next time. loved the pairing with mushrooms, spinach and rice  The best part, they are open on Sundays!! I would like to try the patio next time, and I can't wait to be back again! Thank you for making my Sunday a better day!"}
{"text":"It was yummy and the decor was adorable! Limited seating but worth it to get take-out."}
{"text":"Read reviews and had open mind. Didn't stay to order. Went in for lunch and it wasn't that busy. Totally confused on how to proceed. No greeter so stood around till we figured to get own menu. The people behind the counter totally ignored us. Waited for a while and figured it wasn't worth it. Plus not that clean. 4 stars please.  Must be friends"}
{"text":"I really, really wanted to like this place more, but it fell pretty flat for me.  I got the steak salad and it was so boring I could cry.  Large pieces of thin steak (that should have been chopped down for a salad), iceberg lettuce, mandarin oranges, slivered almonds and a bland vinaigrette.  There was a serious lack of flavor and I was super disappointed.  My husband had the steak sandwich and that was a little better, but it could have used a little bit more oomph.  More gorgonzola or seasoning or something...  His fries were good though; steak fries with just the right amount of crispiness.   This place is super small and the vibe is really fun with a trendy and fun decor.  I will give them another shot and I'm hoping to to be pleasantly surprised the next time.  It would be a shame for a place with such a great local concept to fall short..."}
{"text":"The spot is a hidden gem. It's a small place with some outdoor tables. We went for lunch. I had a salad that was light and fresh and it came with a slice of the best cinnamon bread I have had in a long time. My husband got a sandwich and loved every bite. They have gluten free options as well."}
{"text":"I am happy to report that The Spot has regained my approval and my business. Four of us arrived around 5:30 on a Sunday evening. A few tables were busy but we were able to score a window table. The server was prompt, helpful and friendly. Two of us had cocktails which were excellent and reasonably priced.  I had the evening special, walleye, which was served with rice and kale. The fish was one filet, nicely spiced with a lightly crisped skin. It was delicious.  Two of my companions had the salmon which was served with the same sides and one had the pasta and added chicken. Everyone was very satisfied. The fish eaters joined the \" clean plate club\". Half the pasta went home with my friend. I am glad The Spot survived the never ending construction on Johnson St. I look forward to going back soon."}
{"text":"I love this place. The food was good as was the service.  With that said, the only downfall is that I could see this place being downright horrible for business meetings and being horribly congested during lunch - get it and go!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like the Spot a bit more than I did, just because of the design and decor. The Chipotle Chicken sandwich was tasty when I had it, but on a return visit a friend said it was dry, and not as good. Consistency may be an issue here. I found the flatbread to be nice and garlicy, and I enjoyed the service and music.  You can read my full review here: http://forkvsfood.com/thespot-boldroost/"}
{"text":"This was a great choice off the beaten path in Madison. The home fried kettle chips were a great appetizer. I had the salad with salmon & my friend had the steak. Small place with wine & beer available . Would be a great place for a date"}
{"text":"I finally tried The Spot this afternoon when I had some time to kill before work. It's just across the street from me, and I've been wanting to try it since it opened up last month.  As other reviewers have said, the place is very small and awkwardly arranged. There was only two other people in line while I was there, but I still had to manuever around them to get water from the soda fountain. The two tables downstairs were already occupied by a dad and son in one and an employee in another. Why is an employee taking a table away from a customer? Shouldn't they be provided a break room or at least eat outside?  I got the veggie sandwich, and it was sorta good, sorta bad. The bad part was the soggy hoagie roll that it was served on. It couldn't stand up to the filling, and after a few bites, I had to eat it with a fork. I loved how generous they were with the avocado. That's a big plus for me. The baby portobellos were cooked perfectly, not slimy or underdone, but they could have used more seasoning. The side salad included with the sandwich was bad. It was iceburg lettuce (ew, ew, ew), tomato and cucumber dressed with some sickly sweet vinaigrette.  I'm not sure why customers aren't given the choice of sides (fries or salad), instead it's determined by the sandwich you order.  I was hoping to fit The Spot into my rotation of neighborhood restaurants since it's within walking distance, but it's not good enough to sway me away from The Coffee Shop or Joe's Farm Grill. Not even close."}
{"text":"Not only is this place 5 mins from my home it's a very cool place to hang with my kiddos.    We always sit in the loft area, my kids wouldn't have it any other way.  :)  The food is good, (mac and cheese is TO DIE FOR) and even though I encourage my boys to try something new they usually just stick with sliders or burgers.  Either way, I have never ever had anything bad or even mediocre here.  It's all great stuff!  The atmosphere is fun and hip and while seating is VERY limited, we've never had an issue with finding the loft mostly vacant so we can find our favorite spots.  The loft is a favorite because we can sit on the sofas, put our feet up on the ottomans and relax.  I like that they play music that is a mix of top 40 from 80s to current although my kids LOVE when they are playing 80s music since they keep reminding me how OLD I AM because I know all the songs.  :sigh:  The only issue I have (deducted one star for it) is that their staff looks to be mostly high school students.  Now, I don't have an issue with teens working to make some extra money but nearly every time we've visited they are kind of clueless.  (or maybe it's cool to act that way...what do i know, I'm pushing 40)  They don't really know the menu, can't make suggestions, aren't sure about substitutions, things like that.    We visited a couple times and I asked if we could order the kid's meal with sliders instead of a full adult slider meal (too much for my little guy to eat) and was told yes and they gladly accommodated.  The very next visit was told no, that they don't offer sliders as a kid's item.  BUT they don't even offer burgers on the kid's menu.  huh?  Anyway, I quit asking and being told no so I just order the regular slider meal, paying double when my son will only eat half of it.  Otherwise he would starve because he LOVES their sliders and doesn't like any of the other options on the kid's menu.  I'd really like to see this be added.  They have a nice selection of San Tan Brewery beers (in cans) which is nice as they are always ice cold (you can grab them right out of the cooler on the counter when you order your food) but I don't like having to get up from my seat to get another and pay for it separately.  Last time we were in, I ordered two beers the same time we ordered our food and asked the gal at the counter if I could come back for the other one a little later.  Sure.  Not a problem.  So....when I went back to the counter to get my other beer she started to ring me up for it.  I reminded her I had paid for it already (this was the same gal that rang us up earlier).  Again, the clueless teenager thing.  Kind of annoying and not very professional.  Other than that I love this place, my kids love this place and we eat there at least 3x a month.  Haven't tried breakfast there yet but will do that soon!"}
{"text":"i stopped by today for a late lunch. I chose the summer salad & was really impressed. . The glass bowl was a nice touch. The shredded chicken was plentiful, strawberries were fresh & the dressing was yummy. The candied walnuts were also really good. It came with a slice of sweet bread that I assumed was raisen bread.It was good but  because this salad is a bit sweet I would have traded it for croutons. I loved this salad & will be back & will order it again.  Btw, I appreciate that their clean bathroom had a dresser for me to sit my purse on. So many restaurants have us sit our purses on the floor or sink & then we come back to the clean table & sit it on top. Not good.   Nice job Spot."}
{"text":"So when you hear of a place named \"The Spot\" you think.. well it must be pretty damn good and assuming it's \"The Spot\" to go to.. and based off other yelpers reviews, I was expecting some awesome food. Unfortunately I was a bit disappointed.   Not saying my whole experience here was a bust, the service was fantastic, and the environment was great!   Walked in and they were fully packed with people at every table, so we waited by the bar and got a drink to pass time. I ended up getting the Double Apple Old Fashion.. pretty good.. It had a cinnamon kick to it.. which reminded me of Fireball whiskey almost ( Which I love. ) After waiting for about 15 - 20 minutes we got a table and started to check out the menu. We started off with the Gorgonzola Chips which were homemade potato chips, topped with Gorgonzola cheese, white pepper crema, and basil. They were pretty good, I had to add a little Tabasco to mine though.   I ended up ordering the Saltimbocca-wich, which was a Chicken breast on a chiabatta bun, topped with prosciutto, arugula, mozzarella, and caper aioli. With a side of their potato salad. Sadly I was very unimpressed with my sandwich. It sounded so fantastic, but it had almost a fishy flavor to it... which sounds so weird, but  they had their fish fry going on that night. I just couldn't get over the taste of fish on my chicken sandwich.   But like I stated above.. The service was truly outstanding, which didn't totally kill my experience at The Spot."}
{"text":"Excellent! The best veggeterian sandwich! Clean, friendly and chic. Loved it!"}
{"text":"I was a lot like the other reviewers here, so excited for a non chain restaurant with good food.  Well, I was sorely mistaken.  My husband and I tried The Spot for the first time and while the food wasn't terrible, it was slightly disappointing.  I had the sliders and while the Hawaiian Sweet rolls they came on were soft, it didn't make sense and the flavor wasn't good.    We decided that we were going to give them another shot as everyone has their \"bad days\".  This was the worst food I've had in a long time.  I got The Original Spot chicken sandwich- who ever cooked this sandwich has to be afraid of under cooking chicken because it was cooked to shit.  I have never had chicken so burnt and over cooked in my life, seriously.  My husband ordered the Chipotle Chicken sandwich and his chicken was also so extremely over cooked.  I've never seen my husband not want to eat something, as he is a guy and we all know guys don't have taste buds, but he passed on his food.  Seriously.  Unfortunately, we will not be visiting The Spot again.  It's too bad, Gilbert truly needs great local restaurants.  It looks like we'll be exclusively visiting The Coffee Shop."}
{"text":"I ordered food to go and it took about 25 minute after I ordered to actually get the food.  That's a little long to be waiting for two sandwiches to go when there were only 10 others in the restaurant sitting down to eat.  I had a chicken cheesesteak sandwich which was pretty good.  I think the other sandwich was a turkey something and it was pretty good also.    I think the food is really good but I can't wait 25 minutes for a to go order, and the inside of this place is crammed and muggy.  It might help to get a fan going, the A/C, something."}
{"text":"I live right down the street from this place and have wanted this to be our new \"spot\" so bad! It's a super convenient location with a decent sounding menu, but it has fallen short every time we've tried it.  Today I went for the fourth and final time and I WILL NOT be going back. I called in my order ahead of time, was told it would be ready in 2 minutes. I got there and my order had not even been started. The lady at the front was not interest in her job in the slightest, she barely will speak and only answers questions with the shortest response possible. When my chicken salad sandwich was done I was happy to get out of the restaurant. I check out the food in my car and noticed it was a salad, if you consider rotting slimy lettuce with nothing on it a salad, instead of chicken salad as it says on the menu. I went back in and asked for pasta salad. I was told it no longer came with pasta salad, but I could pay for a side of it, absolutely ridiculous! I paid almost $10 for a meal that was basically inedible.   My suggestion is to skip the spot and go to the Coffee Shop. Unless the owners make big changes in service and quality of food this place won't last!!!"}
{"text":"My husband & I have eaten here twice, once this winter & once earlier this week. We had a great meal both times. The atmosphere is lovely--this time, we ate on the small, pleasant back patio. The cocktails, with a creative menu that changes (seasonally?) are as good as any in town (and yes, I've enjoyed Forequarter, Merchant, Graze, etc). The wine & beer list are small but nice, and everything we've tried on the menu was delicious. The first time we went, we had been to Forequarter the week before, and we agreed that The Spot had equally good food, but larger portions and more reasonable prices. It's our favorite new restaurant this year and we'll definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"How do you describe the best breakfast, lunch or dinner in all of the land???? Two words! THE SPOT!!! Every time I eat here I smile like a fat kid in a cake factory!! This place never disappoints! They even have a Hangover breakfast plate !!! Don't wait in line   At Lenny's or any other chain restaurant when you can get top notch food from a locally owned restaurant ! The food is cooked within eyesight of you  and the also have a file very bike for neighborhood delivery (Higley ). If you leave feeling like you got bad food it's becuase your taste buds suck and your life hates you!!"}
{"text":"I anticipated The Spot would be a very friendly stop for my friends and I to catch up and get a tasty bite to eat. HOWEVER this has been the most dissatisfying and disrespectful encounter I've ever had in an establishment. All four of our food orders were served incorrectly, missing sides and when asking the unpleasantly and inconvenienced server to correct the orders no apology was given. Additionally when addressing the issue that a a side of avocado was never served, the same server  again did not apologize, pulled a dollar out of the tip jar and so rudely waved it at us to take. The attitude from the server was overbearing and unprofessional. Clearly she had a bad day and blatantly stated it for us to know. I would never go back to this cafe and highly suggest that no one bothers taking a second look at it either."}
{"text":"The spot is a hidden treasure on the east side! Their food is fantastic, and made with fresh/local ingredients. The person who is in charge of developing their menus is innovative and masterful. And their backyard patio is a wonderful space to chill. Definitely check it out if you haven't already!"}
{"text":"A little over priced otherwise 5stars, I eat here weekly and the desserts are awesome love the breakfast/lunch menu!"}
{"text":"I tried the chipotle chicken sandwich and my wife had a BLT. Neither sandwich was anything special. For as much mayo as they laid on the chicken sandwich, you would think it would be somewhat rich. Not so. Nor was it particularly savory. For a sandwich featuring chipotle, it was all around under seasoned.  Judging by some of the other reviews, the quality must be hit or miss."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday morning for brunch. Sat on their back patio on a beautiful day and started with $2 bloody mary & mimosa.  When we decided on what we would order our server decides to mention some special, so we ordered those instead. Bbq prok belly sandwich and chorizo breakfast burrito. The pork belly sandwich was good, but maybe a tad too much bbq sauce for me- I suggest serving it on the side. The chorizo burrito, however, was a clear winner. This is cured chorizo (Spanish?) and it was AMAZING. Really good stuff here.  If the chorizo burrito is added to the menu, then we will definitely be back for that."}
{"text":"A friend and I went here on Friday for lunch and were unfortunately disappointed. Also unfortunate was the fact that we both ordered the same exact thing!    And that thing was the Pesto Chicken sandwich. The pesto seemed fresh and tasted pretty good, but the chicken was a little lacking in flavor and quite squishy. The sandwich just seemed to be lacking and was not memorable. I chose the potato salad as my side, and that was actually very good.   For an appetizer we had the Baked Artichoke Ramekin, and it was delicious. I'd definitely recommend that to start.  The space has gotten quite a face-lift since Mildred's closed, and it's lovely. The little bar in the back is a cozy little space to hide. Love it.  Service was fine. Our waitress was nice and our food didn't take too long.  Overall, we weren't' too pleased with our visit, but will have to check it out again. The ladies sitting at a nearby table were gushing about the Spot Burger, which is something I'll likely try next time."}
{"text":"No sauce on pizza. Philly steak sandwich was very dry. Burger bun was stale. Not coming back."}
{"text":"I had the club with a salad. The salad had a spicy oil and vinaigrette dressing that was good but surprising. Club was good although I'll agree with a previous reviewer that the avocado slices were the quite small. Service was friendly. Outdoor seating was nice but music was too loud to relax with while eating lunch."}
{"text":"Went to The Spot the other morning with my girlfriend for brunch. Let me just say, AMAZING!!  I ordered the veggie scrambler and it was a blend of flavors that truly impressed me. Will defiantly return!"}
{"text":"I liked this place a lot. It's cute, it's not a chain and the people there are super friendly. We went there for breakfast and had a nice time. The place is small, but it felt very warm and cozy.  I ordered the three-egg breakfast, which was a screaming deal at $6. I asked them for only two eggs, since three is a bit much, and they were happy to suggest adding fruit since I wasn't getting all the eggs. I also got a $1 bloody Mary -- which were small and mostly tomato juice, but heck for $1 it was perfect.  I will go there again because I liked the atmosphere and attitude. The only reason I didn't give them five stars was because I ordered my two eggs over easy and they came out scrambled. But I also got bacon and sausage (I was supposed to only get bacon) and so I didn't complain. The food was tasty."}
{"text":"The Spot is a good place for a lunch date or a quick bite to eat. If you are lucky enough to live close by (within a mile radius), they can deliver food to your house on their old school cruiser bikes...so eco-friendly. I tried their BLT \"Hit the Spot\" Salad, served in a deep square bowl,  and it was good. My wife tried the Classic Style Spot Sliders and it filled her up. Great job!!!"}
{"text":"Why am I just now finding out about this cozy little spot?! My girlfriend and I stopped in for dinner tonight. The Friday walleye was a fantastic dish.  The fish was flavorful, slightly crispy and wonderful with their tartar sauce. The slaw was perfect- not drenched in cream sauce like some places.  We loved our salads and clam chowder, and my girlfriend loved the tomato broth mussels.  The space is small, but not cramped. Cozy and comfortable. Besides the great food, they had kombucha which made me happy. And the service was everything I hope for when eating out. I forget her name, but she was perfect. Always checking in at the right time, knowledgeable about the menu, fun and kept the water glasses full. Her male co-server grabbed empty dishes as he walked by which shows that both servers know how to work together to bring the best service possible to their tables. The Spot will become a regular place in our rotation thanks to their great food, cozy atmosphere and awesome service!"}
{"text":"Definitely a two star place. Very dirty (chairs, tables, floors and all bottles were filthy) along with marginal food. Nasty French fries, browned avocado, hard gluten free buns and no mustard for burgers."}
{"text":"The service was good. The restaurant is nice and clean. But the food is WAY over priced for what you get. Their chicken sandwich was great, however the fact that they charged $2.50 to add 3 of the tiniest slices of avocado i've ever seen, is ridiculous. Also the portion of fries that comes with it was tiny as well. I got the steak fries which were around $7.99 for a small basket of fries with some cheese and fake bacon bits. Not worth it. The place wasn't horrible but definitely far from amazing. We won't be going back."}
{"text":"Went for a nice lunch with my wife since we like trying new places and like to support the community. I was actually impressed with how we could sit outside or make it a little more private and fun in the loft area on a love seat. As we approach the counter a young man says \"Hold on, I'll get someone.\" Um, OK. I thought since he was standing behind the counter that HE was \"the one\". As he shuffles to the back and a young girl proceeds to walk up she was polite but more interested in the other young man sitting at the table near the counter. We figure, oh well they're teens and probably just killing time. So we decided to sample their steak sandwich under the Signature Sandwiches and also an order of their Lone-Star Steak Fries under the Shareables. The steak sandwich was good sized but bland, at least it came with some steak fries with it. The Lone-Star Steak Fries WERE A JOKE!! On the menu it states \"Serves and satisfies 4 folks\". GOOD LUCK!!! There were less fries in the Shareable order than with the steak sandwich & it wouldn't satisfy 1 much less \"4 folks\".   The service was mediocre at best. The food was bland & WAY overpriced. So if you enjoy bland and overpriced this is the place!   I feel Gilbert needs The Spot remover on this place..."}
{"text":"Awesome little place for breakfast! Food is really good and the people are really nice. Seating is limited because it is a small place but I have never not had anywhere to sit. Staff is usually really nice as well."}
{"text":"Wanted to wait and visit here on a nice Saturday evening in order to sit on the back patio. That was last week.  Was able to make a reservation about an hour befoe, so lucky they were not overly busy. We were immediately seated, I started with an old fashioned and she a glass of chardonnay.  We then had the gorgonzola chips.  WOW!   Absolutely fantastic, but the plate is hot. Entrees were the pork medallons which were like butter, they were so tender.  And the spot burger, done just right with Knoches beef and prosciutto , not bacon. A fantastic meal, and great SPOT!"}
{"text":"I like this place when I don't know where to go for lunch! Small place with a little menu but a good random lunch spot for sandwiches and soups! I recommend the chicken sandwich!"}
{"text":"Oh shoot, I wanted to love you, but I don't.  Part of my experience with The Spot was great, don't get me wrong. I came on a Wednesday night and they were booked with reservations, but tried their very best to fit my party of three in. I really appreciated that level of hospitality.  While we waited by the bar, we tried a couple of drinks. The kind bartender whipped up my order, Boo's New Dog, which consists of local vodka, campari and a passion fruit puree. It was made well, but not for my taste. My cousin ordered the double apple old fashioned, which was very reminiscent of her favorite whiskey, fireball. She seemed to enjoy it well enough.  After a short while, and what I'm assuming was a cancellation, we were seated. We had a kind server, ordered our appetizer of their Gorgonzola chips and our meals. The chips came out very quickly, sprinkled with tasty bacon, but that's their highlight. They were quite unflattering in taste and presentation, in my opinion.  We ordered the Fish Fry, the Spot burger, and the Saltimbocca-wich for our entrees and the presentation was nice. The sandwich and the burger came on a ciabatta bun but our meals fell flat. The chicken was odd in texture - very squishy and unpleasant. The burger was very small compared to the bun, and the meat did not taste like it was worth $10.50. I tried the fish and it was very bland. For my side I chose the potato salad which was just too sweet and hard to stomach.  This is all quite subjective as we all have different taste, but it's definitely not the spot for me."}
{"text":"Menu never changes. I keep hoping they will have something new that I would like, but the food is average on a good day and the service is awful. Called and asked about a menu item - was told she didn't know and it was too busy to ask."}
{"text":"It's been about six months since we've been to The Spot. We were frequent customers to the point where we burned out on it for a while. We woke up craving the Californian breakfast burrito this weekend -- it's quite possibly the best breakfast burrito either my husband or I have ever had. Something's changed in the last six months though, and we knew it as soon as we walked in the front door. The place smelled like dirty fryer oil. We ordered and sat down at the only free table downstairs just as the parties at the other tables finished and left. The cashier disappeared for a while, coming back after another family walked in. The tables remained un bused for another 15 minutes, leaving a VERY pregnant customer to climb the stairs to find a table. As we waited for our food, we noticed the tables were new, and the bright orange plastic chairs were filthy, the backs are covered in black grime from repeated and many hands moving the chairs. As we looked around, we really began to notice the details....the restaurant is so much dirtier than we've ever seen it in the past, what happened? Our food arrived, without the fruit cup it has always come with...the server let us know they no longer offered it (shouldn't the cashier told us this when ordering?), we could have more potatoes (already in the burrito) or Mac and cheese (?). We were really disappointed, and chose the latter just because we already had potatoes. It was all too heavy without the fruit pairing. The server, cook and cashier openly discussed that Mac and cheese wasn't an allowable offering, within earshot, and the server was even confused. The burritos were incredibly rich without the side of fruit to balance, the Mac and cheese was bland and dry, we barely touched our food and took most of it home to share with our dogs. It was so many little things, but overall a poor enough experience that we're inclined not to go back. What's happened to this place, new manager, new owners? Something has changed, not for the better."}
{"text":"Great service and the appetizer and chefs catch were amazing. However, the spot burger was the worst burger I've ever had. The prosciutto on top of the burger was all squished together into a big plasticy pile. The bread was soggy because of all of the \"pepper catsup\" that both sides of the bun were dunked in. The meat (kNOches) was awful, tasted metallicy and made me feel sick. This burger had a lot of potential but it was incredibly disappointing. I really wanted to love this place!! Everything else was great, but the low quality of the burger was disappointing enough to make me think twice about coming back."}
{"text":"We love this place! Such a great addition to the area. We typically call ahead and pick up but have eaten in a few times. It is on the smaller side but like the outdoor option.  I typically get one of the breakfast burritos or the veggie sandwich."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner last week and found The Spot to be an okay place. The ambiance is cozy, and the service was spectacular. The food, however, was nothing special. The Spot Burger had a lot of good stuff on it, and the burger was cooked well, but the bun seemed like a regular store bought bun and the sauce on the burger made it soggy. If the bun had instead been a nice roll, I think it would have been awesome. The prices for the food are very reasonable, but the wine and cocktails are a little pricey. I'd come back and give it another try, but I don't think I'll end up being a regular here."}
{"text":"I love this place! I took my sister here one day for a \"girls day\" breakfast before pedicures and it's fantastic. Very friendly staff, great, fun menu. Wonderful, friendly atmosphere overall. I've only been here for breakfast so far, but the portions were large and filling, and the mimosa was perfect. :)  I have yet to try their delivery service, but definitely plan to do so. They hop on their bikes and deliver your food to you by BIKE. How cute is that?!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch, love the spot! So cute! I ordered the club and fries, delicious. My friend had a yummy salad, portions are large. We sat outside, it was still cool enough to sit out. The entrance is surrounded by a gated area, not obvious where the gate opens, could use a sign or something and the ketchup bottles were all empty. But for the food I am going back!!"}
{"text":"Quick review. Had a few items here since they have been open. Their breakfast is really good and they have this really good Carmel cheesecake dessert. Friendly staff. Quick service. Always clean."}
{"text":"I have never written a Yelp review for a restaurant, but felt compelled to do so for The Spot. There are so many reasons for witing this review.  Let's start with the food. I ordered two chicken sandwiches (one for me and one for my son).  My daughter ordered the burger. The chicken sandwich was decent, but nothing to write home about. The burger, on the other hand, was a different story.  I knew the burger was not going to be good as soon as the server/cashier brought it to the table (it looked weird). After a few bites, my daughter refused to eat it. She said the meat tasted bad.  I decided to order extra fries for her since she wasn't going to eat the burger.  When I ordered the fries, the server/cashier asked about our food.  I said \"the burger does not taste good\". The server/cashier's response was \"that's because you ordered chicken\". For a second there, I thought I was in the Twilight Zone. I know I ordered the chicken sandwich.  I know what I ate, but I am now referring to the burger. I know the difference between a burger and a chicken sandwich. I told the server/cashier that my daughter (who ate the burger) did not like it because the meat tasted terrible. Instead of offering to replace the burger, the server/cashier tried to rationalize why the burger tasted bad. Her response was \"that's because the beef is pre seasoned\". OK! Whatever! I then proceeded to order fries and I paid for them.  When I got them, they were coated with so much salt, they were inedible. I placed the fries on the counter and told the server/cashier about the large amount of salt on the fries (you could see the salt piled on the fries). She offered to make more, but never offered to refund my money.  At this point, I was DONE!  I will NEVER eat here again. Do not waste your time or your money here. I think the customer service was worse than the food."}
{"text":"This place rocks! I often travel to this side of the valley for work and when I do I try to come here! The breakfast scrambles are fresh and have amazing flavor-packed with protein! You can modify any item to be healthy and it still has tons of flavor, and I think you can get breakfast all day...any place that serves breakfast all day wins in my book!   For lunch I ordered the chipotle chicken sandwich But as a burrito to try and limit the bread. Full of flavor and they even subbed a salad for my fries and didn't charge me an arm and leg! Although the fries smelled absolutely amazing as I waited for my food I had to chose the healthier version! Torture.   The cupcakes and deserts look beautiful...I want to try them every time but battle  against the beautifully sculpted sugary and artsy cupcakes!! One day I will cave! I like to sit upstairs as it's a cozy little area, they even have a couch and I've hung out up their during slower hours and plugged in my laptop to get some work done.   Customer service is always great, accommodating with a friendly smile! I hope you enjoy this place as I have!"}
{"text":"I tried the poutine classique which I thought was quite good.  It is obviously tremendously unhealthy, which is part of the attraction ;).  Anyway, I thought that the pricing was a bit high here, and the seating arrangements are pretty much nonexistent.  I would certainly warn against coming here with a group of any size.  As it was my wife and I were exiled to the outdoor seating area which bakes under direct sunlight and is helped little by the misters they have out there.  If you are local and are looking for something to go, this place is probably a much better bet."}
{"text":"I have now been twice. I want to like it. It's near our house and very cute. The first time we went I had a soggy, bland $8 sandwich. Today we tried happy hour. The red wine was served very warm in a plastic cup. The pastry tasted like it featured canned apple pie filling. The employees were very nice, and it's cute, but we will not try it again."}
{"text":"Flatbreads were great. Wife got 4 cheese and loved it. I had the steak and mushroom which was amazing. Service was wonderful. Steak Fries could have been cooked a little longer. Not a lot of seating. Curious to see what will happen in the summer since they rely on outdoor seating a lot."}
{"text":"Gave this place three chances since it is across the street and convenient, however, during the LAST visit, my mom found two long hairs intertwined in her food....I looked to the open kitchen and the young girl cooking on the grill had her hair back in a braid, but her hair was still all over the place and no hair net.  Yuck! The sliders were greasy gross and my steak salad was more like thinly sliced fatty lunch meat, not steak. Don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"This is mine and my husbands FAVORITE Spot!!!! The BEST made to order food you can get quick! We love the small quant environment and always choose the Spot for a yummy breakfast, lunch or dinner!! Kia they give you 10% off if you check in with Yelp!! :-)-"}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here and in our opinion it is horrible.  This was our first and last time eating at The Spot.  I ordered the Original Spot chicken sandwich and it was still pink in the middle.  So I ate around the middle.  We also had the sliders and they didn't even taste like meat to me.  My wife also had some onion strings with her order which were overcooked and tasted really bad.  The mac and cheese was ok.  The chairs were also very dirty.  I would not recommend this place to anyone ever.  As I write this my wife is now getting herself a bowl of cereal at home instead."}
{"text":"This review is more of a 3.5 than a 3. With the success of places like Forequarter, I can't quite figure how new restaurants open with the same derivative menus: half sandwiches, the other half predictable entrées like mussels, steak, risotto. Although the veggie burger is one of the best in town, The Spot doesn't offer anything new or different. The dining room is charming and the service is good, but its all-around sameness is frustrating. There is clearly a competent, thoughtful cook in the kitchen, but s/he needs to take greater risks for greater rewards. This place has great potential to be a high class neighborhood joint if it pared down the menu to a few classics and a few gutsier show stoppers."}
{"text":"First impression was great... been slipping a little since. Let me explain...  I had waited a while for this to open as I heard about it through a friend who was involved in their marketing stuff. When it did open and I ordered food from there within I think the first week of them opening.. the food was stellar. The bacon was excellent and piled very high on the chicken sandwich, the chicken breast could have been a little bigger imo but it didn't end up being an issue because of the amount of bacon. The chicken sandwich was great... better than the farm grill as it had more to it than just a chicken breast slapped on bread. The applewood bacon was plentiful as I had mentioned and it was delish.. made the sandwich.   I've had the sliders too and those seem pretty good, I'll get those again soon. The shoestring fries are really good too. The chicken salad is really good... not a huge fan of walnuts in it... but it's not bad and compliments the rest of it well.   Decor makes it a nice little place inside. Modern deco and a small upstairs loft to eat in that's pretty cool. It is however too small and congested for any type of business lunch.. had some friends not eat there for a company lunch as the 8 of them just couldn't fit and talk about work.   If you live hyper local they do delivery on bicycles... I'm just out of range but that's cool.  ======// The issues.... First and foremost is the lack of consistency. When they first opened, bacon was piled high (as described on the menu) and subsequent orders have lacked said 'piled high'... to the point where the wife doesn't want to eat there anymore because she's felt jipped twice now on BLT's w/ only a couple strips per side of bacon... which... when the whole sandwich is about bacon... kinda sucks. And if she doesn't want to eat there then that drastically limits my ability to do so as well.  Ordering on the phone.... sometimes they want a CC number, and sometimes they don't ask. Once the number was given over the phone and then they wanted it on pick up as they hadn't billed it and they lost the number... um... why aren't they running it when I give it to them?? I'd rather not have my info written down and 'lost'... so I've been saying I'll pay when I get there since but... that's concerning.   The only food thing I've had there I didn't like so far is the mac-n-cheese. It was not very cheesy and more like noodles with some crumbly stuff and a little tiny itsy bit of melted cheese in it... not creamy... just dry.. didn't even eat much more than a couple spoonfuls.  ======// Overview... I'll go back but not as easily as before... the wife doesn't want to but I'll probably order from time to time on my own."}
{"text":"I've only been here once, but it was great.   A nice cocktail selection, including some very good gins.  I had the Spot burger, vegetarian version and it was one of the best veggie burgers in town.  The lemon cake was delish!  I can't wait to go back and try more items from the varied menu."}
{"text":"I had the meatball grinder with a side of polenta.  This meal was good, but it was not a \"Wow\" moment.  The meatballs were flavorful and were topped with sauce, fresh mozzarella and basil.  The polenta lacked any flavor at all.  The sandwich was delicious but the portion was small.  For $10, I was expecting something just a little bigger.  It was good but it was not great.  I had a glass of the Chardonnay.  It was pretty delicious and generously poured for $8.  The space is small and while it would intimate for a date, it was weird earlier in the day.  Families go there and it just seems kind of cramped at that point.  I have not tried the patio or the bar.    I would consider it again but truthfully nothing about this place really stood out."}
{"text":"Hidden little gem! Absolutely love their $1 Bloody Mary's and Mimosas on Saturday and Sunday! Honestly, who does that? Their food is always great. It's familiar in flavor but with unique flare and combinations. C'mon beer and a brie sandwich, um Yum!"}
{"text":"I love this little quaint restaurant! Have had great food and experience every time I've gone for lunch.  The chipotle chicken is my fav!! I wish there was more inside seating, for when it gets super hot, but outside seating was great for good weather."}
{"text":"What a great place!  Found it on the Around Me app while looking for a place to take my niece and nephew. The \"kid's burgers were huge and I had the southwest scramble. Amazing. Would be great place to have a drink too. Our server Christi was fun and quick. I'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"X MARKS \"THE SPOT'! Oct 25. Just had the most enjoyable lunch. A delightful Salmon BLT, with potato salad. The atmosphere was relaxing and intimate. Our server, Carley, was polite, professional, courteous, and displayed a knowledge of how the dishes were prepared.  I found the menu to be refreshing and inviting.  I will be back to try The Spot Burger and Gorgonzola chips......in addition to the Adult Beverages.  Thanks Tiger."}
{"text":"We tried The Spot for lunch, and it was just eh. At the end of the meal, it reminded me more of like a short-order restaurant.  We ordered the Spot sandwich (a plain chicken sandwich with mediocre quality bun), and a chicken salad. The best part of the salad was the little piece of apple cinnamon bread that came on the side. Otherwise, it was little more than salad with deli turkey/ham in it, and some walnuts.   The seating was uncomfortable, and there's only 2 tables inside downstairs, and 1-ish up the stairs. Not great for summer eating in AZ. We ended up outside. The misters helped a little, but it was disappointing that most of their seating is outdoors.  The dessert case looked pretty good, but not good enough to make me want to try it.   I doubt we'll go back, it wasn't even compelling enough for me to write this review on the same day we went."}
{"text":"I've dropped in here a couple times since it's so close to home. I'm looking for that place we can ride our bikes to, grab a bite to eat & chill. This place has the potential but it's just not their yet. Family owned is great but I've never seen the owners so maybe thats why its lacking that personal touch.....  yesterday my daughter & I decided to ride our bicycles to dinner so we agreed on The Spot. It was an hour before closing so there were friends of the employees there grabbing a bite to eat and some guy playing with his camera, for what turned out to be an hour, without touching his pizza in front of him. Food came out in a decent amount of time. I had the loaded fries & my daughter had the grilled cheese with fries. The grilled cheese tasted great but the fries were a bit on the salty side. Today's visit seamed to go ok. Nothing really stuck out or went wrong. The last 2 times we visited, our food was slow, orders were wrong, tables were dirty & questionable behavior out of the employees preparing the food. I would visit more if they food was better especially for the pricing. As of right now its a hit or miss for us"}
{"text":"Meh is all I can say when they first started it was awesome, now it's MEH. Use your money elsewhere. Also, got rid of poutine."}
{"text":"One of my favorite \"spots\" in Madison. Cocktails are good, Gorgonzola chips are great.  Good is always tasty and has a cozy atmosphere."}
{"text":"Came here when they first opened after viewing their menu online. Decided to give them at a try one weekday evening and dine out. Wrote down the family's order and decided to go order in person and take our food to go.   Mom got citrus-asian steak salad, brother got bike rider BLT and I ordered the steak sandwich. When I walked in, the place reeked of burnt grease and the air was filled with smoke. I tried to enjoy the uniqueness of the restaurant as much as I could without my eyes watering from the smoke. After ordering I sat outside and enjoyed the weather as I eavesdropped on other tables, fiddled with my Blackberry and watched cars drive by on Higley Rd.  The wait time was probably 35 minutes, and it wouldn't have been so bad if my Blackberry hadn't died halfway through waiting for the food (/sadface)... but I suffered through and saw those dining in immediately get served (another /sadface). It was funny, there were a group of us \"diner-outters\" (add that to the Yelp dictionary *wink wink*) who sort of got shoved to the back of the order line! Aren't all customers created equally?!  So, I got the food home and was really dissatisfied with initial appearances. Our food came in take out brown boxes, not really the classiest of dining out boxes, but quite economical for the restaurant as we were served much less food then I saw come out on plates! I mean really this box was probably 5 inches wide, 4 inches long and 2/3 inches deep - i'm no architect but these boxes are small!  Mom didn't particularly enjoy her citrus-asian salad and brother though the BLT was okay. My steak sandwich was the highlight of all our food since I ended up sharing with everyone else as their meals left much to be desired."}
{"text":"My wife and I have dined at the Spot on 3 occasions now.   Each time we've been pleased and quite satisfied.   We've had something different on each visit and so far all of our dinners have been very good.   I gave it 4 stars but would easily say 4.5 on the 5 point scale.   The service has been excellent.   The atmosphere is cozy and relaxed.   This is one of our favorite new spots to hit when we feel like going out."}
{"text":"First, I have to say that I am shocked there a few reviews with disappointment.... Things happen, I won't deny, nor will I dis those, with their opinions.  Today was my 4th experience with The Spot and it was another very pleasant one. Their menu section is unique & amazing, their food is excellent, ambiance is cute & cozy and the service is friendly & professional. Their prices are a 'little higher' than average, but that's okay- In this case, you get what you pay for and it's well worth it!  Best yet for me, I live in the development right behind them... Walking distance is 5 minutes and delivery takes them 15 minutes.  So happy to have such a perfect little place, so close to home."}
{"text":"We are from NYC visiting Madison. We came upon The Spot by accident. This is a great spot with creative dishes that include many gluten free items. We loved the Quinoa risotto the black bean and lentil veggie burgers d the root salad. We came in from the rain and found s real gem. Barry"}
{"text":"The restaurant came well recommended...however, we won't be going back! My husband's sandwich had old, dried out chicken on it and the amount of fries that came with his sandwich barely covered the bottom of the plate.  My sliders were good but accompanying them was a dish of mac and cheese that was absolutely flavorless and mushy.  The onion straws were not hot or fresh either.  I ordered poutine, being Canadian, and that was tasty.  Other than the sliders, the food was not  cooked fresh.  We will not be returning."}
{"text":"A coworker told me I just had to try this place, and to definitely have their French toast, so we went. After we were told that it would only be around 20 min wait, they finally brought us our food 45 min later. The good news was, their French toast was pretty dang good. Bad news was, it was cold. Must be awesome when it's fresh off the grill.   I figured that maybe it was just an off day and to give The Spot another chance. It's a little hard finding something I can eat off their menu since I don't eat pork, and I finally settled on a burger because there was an option to remove the bacon from my order. It would've been nice to know that they mixed in bacon bits with the hamburger, which I found out halfway through the burger. So now since I've never eaten pork, I have myself some fantastic stomach cramps right now, and I'm thinking that I'm done with this place for good."}
{"text":"Is there such a thing as 0 stars??? I love supporting local businesses- but this place is just not a place I will spend my $ again! Went there around 12:15pm there were just a few people there- no lines.  I ordered  to go - a simple chicken salad sandwich.... I waited and waited- it started getting busy 15 min after i ordered... which i should have been put of there by then- cold  sandwich with made chicken salad- not hard to make- right?  Waited and watched orders pile up in the little \"order up\" shelf... No one there to give people there order but the girl at the counter kept taking orders... So finally at 12:40 i asked about my order and the owner... No owner around-- seriously? A small place like this and no owner around- but they could take my number and he could call me.... Finally at 12:50 i get my food and an apology and the owner will call me...  Sandwich was not good- bread soft like wonderbread- just bleh all around.    Sorry Spot but you are not my favorite spot:(."}
{"text":"Pretty mediocre. Service wasn't the best. I wasn't happy with my food. I got the ciopinno, the scallop was burnt and the salmon was dry. This is one of my favorite dishes and I was really disappointed. I left with a bad taste in my mouth. I wouldn't come here again."}
{"text":"The spot is hit or miss. I also feel like it's a little overpriced, but worth it to support a local business. I really like their original chicken, when it's done correctly. There are a few items that we've gotten one time and they've been wonderful, then other times and they've been barely edible. One that has always been good it's their BLT. Their chipotle chicken and southwestern salad were pretty good too."}
{"text":"I was so excited to see another non-chain eatery open in our neighborhood. My first visit was great and each time thereafter has gotten a bit worse.   Visit #1 - I ordered a BLT - it was great - piled high with bacon and the fries were steak-cut and cooked perfectly.   Visit #2 - I ordered a 4 cheese flat-bread over the phone. She insisted that she needed my credit card number for phone orders (which I don't like doing over the phone for security purposes). Upon picking up my order, I had to wait 15 minutes to get to the counter to pick up my food because of the line. By the time I got home (I live 1.3 miles away), my food was cold. On top of the coldness, the flat-bread was not covered with cheeses (the outer inch and a half had no cheese on it and was hard as a rock). A $5 grab and go pizza from Little Caesars (which I dont like) would have been better  Visit #3- ordered the BLT again because I wanted to eat something I knew I liked. This time, they only had 2 pieces of bacon on each half of the sandwich. The bread to bacon ratio was far to low... disappointing. On top of that, the fries were undercooked and soggy. Doubly disappointing.   Visit #4- I ordered the sliders. However, after tasting my husband's Mac n Cheese during our last visit, I asked for the fries instead of the mac n cheese (the mac is dry, clumped together, and bland). And, of course they messed it up. They substituted the onion straws for the fries instead of the mac, so I got the fries and the mac. The mac was gross, just as it was the last visit and the fries were undercooked and soggy... also like the last visit.   Three strikes and you're out, The Spot. I shall not be returning."}
{"text":"I could go on and on about how good this was! We had a party of 5, and although the place is small we were comfortable. Relaxed atmosphere but seemed intimate as well. We started with the Gorgonzola chips and artichoke appetizer, both incredibly reasonably priced at 6 bucks apiece, and delicious. Lots of vegetarian options for our friends and all our food was fantastic. Friendly, attentive staff (brought us more bread with our appetizer when we ran out) and cheerful bartender. Could it get any better?"}
{"text":"Absolutely friendly place to visit! Chipotle chicken sandwich and the turkey club were terrific. Big portions for a great price. Definitely recommend the various desserts. (you can't miss with any of them)"}
{"text":"Meh..very small place. There were crumbs all over the place, the tables were not bussed and there were no napkins. The girls who were working there were more concerned about what they were wearing than knowing anything about the menu. The food wasn't terrible but definitely it wasn't great. Don't think I'll be going back"}
{"text":"This was a random pick. My roommate and I were starving and we were excited to make this an adventure. It had good reviews on yelp so we decided to meet our friend there.   The beer selection was great, but my favorite summer drink (Oberon) was not available. It was the first on the beer list and unfortunately they were out of it. I ended up ordering the Two Women and it was delicious.   We ordered the Gorgonzola Chips (no bacon) and it was pretty good but the chips taste burnt but we're not physically burned. I ordered the Bacon Gorgonzola Burger medium well. It was great. The bacon was delicious and the burger was cooked perfectly. The citrus mash was unique...different. I wouldn't get it again. Go for a different side.   One of my friends ordered the clam chowder and I wished I had also ordered it. It smelled delicious.   It wasn't as busy when we arrived but after a while it picked up. It's a smaller space and they do take reservations.   Service was excellent. We had Quinn who was attentive and very knowledgeable.   I'll be back for sure. It seems like their specialty is seafood and I love seafood. I was just in the mood for some bacon. :)  The only reason is didn't get high reviews was because of the citrus mash and they ran out of Oberon. :( other than that, excellent service, good location, and good bacon!"}
{"text":"I love The Spot. Brian & Tracey did a fantastic job, and are fantastic people! Check this place out!"}
{"text":"I made my first stop at The Spot on October 1, 2013 for a friend's birthday dinner. It will surely not be my last. I was overwhelmed by the options for Celiac's and the staff's knowledge of what it means to be gluten free. I was excited to learn the chef purposefully does not use a roux in the stews, making pretty much every entree celiac-friendly (they also have GF bread for the sandwiches.)   Everything on the menu sounded delicious, such that I had trouble choosing. I ended up with the Poor Man's Paella, a scrumptious mix of rice, spices, chorizo, sausage, and shrimp. The three shrimp were large sized and the chorizo to die for. I was hesitant at my first bite--believing it might need to be a little more seasoned, but as the chorizo started to blend, I quickly learned the error of my ways. The flavor profile only grew throughout.   My companions ordered the Churrasco Beef and the Portabello Stew. The sear on the beef and the corresponding chimichurri were a perfect blend with the homestyle rice and beans. The polenta with the stew was the best I've had in years.   My companions also ordered the chocolate cake and cheesecake for dessert. Much like with our entrees, every plate was clean.    The atmosphere was lovely. It was a beautiful night, so we sat on the patio, where other diners seemed equally pleased with their meals. I cannot wait to try everything else on the menu, including the gluten free desserts and drinks that I did not sample this time around.   It may have been my first visit, but I'd be hard-pressed to find a way it would ever be my last."}
{"text":"I love this place!! The French toast is to die for!!! Very small inside."}
{"text":"Support local business. Ok, with that out of the way let me tell you a little about The Spot. I placed an online order for lunch today, and I should say that this option is fantastic for parents with small kids. And as a first timer, it was nice to take my time figuring out what to order, without the stress of doing it in front of a line at the register.  First impression walking into the Spot: it's small. Real small. It's a split level with very limited seating on 1st level where you can place your order, and then a bit more spacious seating on the 2nd level (stairway leading up as you walk through the front foor). The downsides to a smaller establishment like The Spot- it gets warm inside very quickly, and stuffy. The other downfall is that much of the menu is cooked on a flattop grill so you get the \"smoke and smell\" permeating throughout the place. I was inside for no more than 5-10 minutes and walked out smelling like a burger joint.  The food is decent- the menu options include sliders, grilled chicken sandwiches, chicken salad- your average pub grub fare. We ordered a side of Mac n Cheese, and it was luke warm with minimal flavor. Meant for our 19 month old daughter, most of it ended up on the dining room floor, another sign of its less than stellar presentation. My wife was disappointed with the chicken salad, as it used grilled chicken and gave a strange combo flavor. The bacon on my Classic Spot sandwich was undercooked, and the fries were extra greasy. For some, this might be a good thing?  The staff was very friendly, and courteous. I stood around waiting for my order to finish and the front counter was chatting away with other patrons. The Spot offers a text message club where you can receive specials via SMS on your smart phone. It's a cool idea, and today there was some sort of \"all you can eat\" deal that others were excited to take part in.  All in all, I'd be hard pressed to give The Spot another chance. We only paid $22 for three meals, which is a great deal for lunch. And the portions were large. But the food was just o-k and the menu options were lackluster (nothing to blow you away). I always want to support my local businesses, and maybe down the line I'll keep an eye on additional Yelp reviews to see if they pick up their game a bit."}
{"text":"Cute restaurant space but doesnt make up for the staff thats not friendly at all. We waited at the counter for 15 minutes before someone walked in out of nowhere to take our order. The soda was all flat and when we mentioned it to the worker he just stared and walked away. Food was horriable. Our buns for our \"bacon burgers\" were stale and the veggies were all wilted. I was very disappointed to see a local hole in the wall be so horriable on service and good when we were the only customers at the time."}
{"text":"Casual and intimate diner offers interesting combinations and tasty favorites. We were very happy with classic sliders and the chicken bacon jam sandwich. Chicken tenders on the kids menu were excellent.  Friendly service and funky decor make this a welcome change from the usual fast food lunch options nearby."}
{"text":"This place is so so good. We came here searching for poutine and found it. It was some of the best poutine my fiancé and I have ever had. Came here today and they took it off the menu! What! No! You guys please bring it back. It was so delicious. The food is great here no complaints except for that great poutine that is now gone!! Great sandwiches and a really cool layout."}
{"text":"What has happened to this place?!?! 2 1/2 years ago, we loved it...we have given it THREE \"last chances\" in the last year and the third strike you are out. There used to be love in the food, now not so much...at all. And it feels like no one behind the counter cares if you are there or not :("}
{"text":"Definitely a spot, a fine spot, but I'm not sure I would call it THE spot.  Some friends and I went for brunch after trying to go to Sophia's when it was closed. The service was notably slooooow and the food was decent, but pretty average. Nothing on the menu was super enticing so I went with one of the scramblers. It was tasty and well seasoned, but overall a small portion that wasn't much to write home about.   I wouldn't take stars off for this or anything but the menu isn't really cohesive. In addition to some breakfast items you'll find a Mediterranean platter...and scallops....scallops? Lol. I wonder if anyone's ordered them for brunch there.  Anyway, I wouldn't hate to go back, but wouldn't go out of my way either."}
{"text":"Super cute little restaurant next to Fresh and Easy. You must try their Poutine french fries, which are covered with cheese curds and gravy. Delicious!!! The dish is big enough for two or three people to share."}
{"text":"Service was very friendly and our meal was delicious! We had the Salmon and the Beef Sirloin, both portions we generous."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a cinnamon roll and it was great! We've also called in a few orders for delivery on nights were feeling lazy and it's always delicious and a nice change from pizza!"}
{"text":"I've tried to eat at this place a few times, but every time I go the food doesn't really stand out.  It makes me feel like is be ok not ever coming back to eat what I ordered.  I'm a big supporter of privately owned businesses, but the food needs more love and the menu has to have more banging options.  It's hard not to turn around and drive down the street to the coffee shop instead.  They do deliver if you live around neighborhood which is great on those lazy days."}
{"text":"I've dined at this location and I've used their delivery service multiple times, and here are my thoughts.  Dining in: The place is cute and quaint, but it's not a good place to have a business lunch or a deep conversation,  If you're going for good food, a friendly atmosphere and a low-key environment, then it's a winner.  But I wouldn't go there to dine in if you're looking for a quiet meal or a place to eat and relax.  Delivery: Amazing.  I live in a nearby neighborhood and use the delivery service frequently. They only charge $1 for it, which is well worth the price (and, of course, whatever you decide to tip).  My food always arrives as ordered, hot, and quicker than their time estimates.  I probably do this about once every couple of weeks and I'm never disappointed.  Food: The food is good quality.  I like the flavors.  My only complaint is that there is too much cheese on the pizzas (but I fully realize that others feel the exact opposite) and a few times the fries have been overcooked.  But 90% of the time I'm thrilled.  If you haven't tried this place out, I'd definitely give it a go!"}
{"text":"Good food and cute place. I don't recommend going during busy hours because there is nowhere to sit, I either go when it's slow or pick up!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, excellent service! Loved the laid back family-owned appeal.  I only deducted a star for he lack of seating. I hope you guys can score a bigger place because you sincerely deserve it!"}
{"text":"Have eaten here six times, now, and I'm struck by how much I've enjoyed each meal.    Happy hour in the bar area comes with half-priced beer and wine.  Always a decent offering of craft beer at the Spot.  A big snifter of Lake Louie - Louie's Reserve for just $3 bucks is hard to beat.  Lately, Friday fish has been the draw for us.  My favorite fish special is the seared cobia.  Perfectly prepared -- seared with a nice crispy surface and a wonderfully rare core.  (Note:  this is a fairly adventurous dish.  Anyone squeamish about sashimi or tartare might want the salmon or walleye, instead.)  The super tasty pesto cream sauce seems an updated version of the traditional mustard-mayo sauce of tuna carpaccio, so it's perfect for the sushi-like fish.  The filet floats atop a fluffy cloud of seriously yummy parmesan risotto.  The whole dish gets drizzled with an excellent balsamic reduction to tie it all together.    At first blush the fish filet seems small.  But that mild disappointment is only relative to the portions of restaurants that charge twice the price of this dish.  There won't be anything to take home in a doggy bag, but with the risotto and the nice pile of broccoli, it's plenty, especially at just $16.  Dessert is awesome:  a savory pumpkin cheesecake, whose low-sweetness allows the pumpkin to really stand out.  The dish gets its sweetness instead from the candied pepitas, which are so flavorful and chewy, they must be fresh-roasted.  The bartender tells us the pastry chef is formerly of Harvest and Graze.  When we first started eating at The Spot, I was addicted to the burgers.  I've tried all three of the burgers on the menu and would be hard-pressed to pick a favorite.  They're all half-pound patties, cooked to order on a beautiful roll, with a side of wilted mustard greens (or any side dish).  $8 for the basic burger, including the side dish?  No wonder I was addicted."}
{"text":"Like other reviewers, I really wanted to like this place.  On our first visit, shortly after they opened, I ordered the Homestyle Turkey Club, my husband had the Chicken Salad sandwich and we ordered Chicken Tenders for our 2 year old.    My son's CHICKEN ARRIVED RAW IN THE MIDDLE.  Luckily, we had broken the tenders in half before giving them to him so he didn't eat any of it.  My husband took the chicken back to the counter and the manager came over and apologized.  She was extremely nice and I could tell she was mortified.  She assured us they would be slicing the chicken more thinly in the future.  She brought back the chicken now cooked perfectly and offered us a free dessert.  Our sandwiches were delicious but it took a long time for us to go back again after that,    We chalked it up to a new restaurant, new cooks, etc, and recently decided to give them another try.  We decided to get lunch to go and my husband went to pick it up.  When he got home we opened it up to find that the bread on my sandwich was completely burnt.  Not dark, burnt.  It's sad because the menu is good, they are friendly, its a good location.  They just seem to have no standards.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"It is really cute inside, despite the small size. The food was very tasty! I will be back to try more items. The staff was friendly & we even chatted with the owner. Great experience!"}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp. The breakfast food is great and the Desserts. I have never tried anything but the breakfast menu. The service is good and the food is fresh. Really happy I found this place and I love their check in offer."}
{"text":"Used yelp's 10% off! Very impressed by how good the food is here ;) Only downfall was the plastic utensils and uncomfortable plastic chairs. Atmosphere is like a loft and staff was friendly.  Cant wait to come back and try breakfast!"}
{"text":"I love the food at this place. Today was the 3rd time my boyfriend and I have been here. The veggie sandwich is my favorite by far but today was a little sad for us. There are reasons some restaurant owners don't have open kitchens for their restaurants and at most places I prefer that they don't. Today we saw the gal cooking and prepping the meals without any gloves on. Okay,no big deal some places do that but then she was wiping off the meat scooper on her apron which was the same apron she was wiping her \"hands\" on and then prepping our meals right after. She also wiped her hands on the rag that she was cleaning off the stove and cutting board with. The one that got me the most was banging the cutting knife off on the garbage can to get the left over avacado peel off. I was actually a little put off by seeing this...I am sure those are health code violations of some sort. I gave this place a 4 because I like the food and the service is great. We haven't gotten sick and I am sure things like this happen in other restaurants I go to all the time, the only difference is these other places don't have open kitchens and if they do they are careful what they do knowing the customers are watching. I hope someone that works at that place talks to the staff. I really love the food here and have not had any issues with getting sick at all. They are less than a mile from my house too so I don't want them to get shut down."}
{"text":"Went for dinner on a Friday a couple weeks back. It was just okay. The service was good, but awkward. The food was okay, but not great.  Had a burger and some wilted greens.   The greens were so salty and heavy with garlic, I couldn't eat it.  It wasn't the worst experience, but not the best either."}
{"text":"Really good lunch spot for a burger or a sandwich, but also their French Toast is amazing as well.  Cool atmosphere, good food, great place."}
{"text":"The Spot is a cozy place to grab a meal in my area, The menu is phenomenal, I've never had anything bad here. And service has always been good, I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Went there for a date night. Very nice Spanish-infused menu. The fresh baguettes complimented all the dishes that we ordered. Overall a very tasty meal. I recommend the Spanish meatballs as an appetizer."}
{"text":"This might not get read but I feel the need to write it anyway. I work in the plaza where you're located and we've ordered from you numerous times over the years. Our orders have been messed up more times than I can even tell you but we continued to order anyway because you're close and I'm all about supporting small businesses, however, after today I will not order again. I just spent $10 for 2 skinny little chicken tenders, some fries and a container of Kraft mac & cheese. Really? I'll take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"We order delivery from The Spot about once a week. We have never had anything we didn't like.  The BLT is one of our favorites. The salads have been delicious and most recently I had the chicken salad sandwich. We have never eaten at the restaurant but the delivery service has been fast. And the prices very reasonable.  It's our favorite take out place."}
{"text":"The service here was amazing, but the food wasn't exactly what I want in food. My favorite food is mashed potatoes, so I ordered the citrus mash... The citrus taste lingered in my mouth and I had to salt the food to be able to eat it. I also ordered the chicken sandwich (without prosciutto because I don't eat prosciutto),  and it was okay. Good, but not a very different taste.. The reason why I didn't want to rate this place lower is because the service was really great. The waiter was very helpful and the food came out quick. They also have a pretty good selection of beer!"}
{"text":"Excellent food - from the cocktails to soup to the walleye to the flourless cake. The staff are very friendly and competent."}
{"text":"Very bland food. They need to incorporate some good flavors like spices and maybe even a good salt in their cooking.   The desserts are the best thing to order here. They are made by a 3rd party company and brought in. By far the best thing about the place.  Whatever you do, when you're ordering, don't look at the floor of the kitchen or the cooking area. Trust me."}
{"text":"This place is very cute and inviting but also relatively small.   I went here for a friend's birthday dinner, and she made reservations for a group of 8 - good call.  I ordered the Poor Man's Paella, which was very flavorful and unique. The shrimp were cooked perfectly and the chorizo added just the right about of Spanish style spice.  If you're in the mood for a fresh, clean drink, I highly recommend the Basil Gimlet.  We also shared three appetizers for the table. Albondigas - delicious, Scallops - perfectly cooked and accompanied by a cilantro pesto, and Gorgonzola chips, good but I didn't love.   My fiancé ordered a burger (man of simple taste but knows his burgers) and he was a bit underwhelmed.   Overall, service was great and my friend genuinely enjoyed her dinner."}
{"text":"Nothing spectacular, they only had one high chair so had to hold my baby, food wasn't very good...and found a hair in my sandwich and glass of wine tasted spoiled if that's even possible.  I wouldn't go back"}
{"text":"Great little local food business.   The Spot reminds me of a place in san diego. The colors and layout anyway. Seating is very limited so if your in the mood for this place make sure not to go during busy hours. We went on a sunday late afternoon and had to say we had the entire place to our selves.   The Service: For the young staff I would say they are well trained and very very nice! Providing a restaurant feel and making sure everything was enjoyable.  I give them kudos for their effort to make it such an experience.   Food: 7/10. The food is very tasty and has alot going for it. The wife had the chipotle chicken sandwich and was very delicious. Full of flavor, but does not make good leftover food. I would say that the portion is enough for 2 people. I had the spot original, felt like a fatty but I enjoyed it and does make me wanta come back and try other foods.   Cost: It is on the costlier side of places where 2 people will set you back $20-25 for both. The deserts look a little to expensive for our blood to try, plus we were to full from our meal there to even try it.  Overall: I was very pleased with this place and will be back to try other items on the menu, so yes I would recommend atleast trying it out!"}
{"text":"Went for the first time today at lunch. The place is small. I ordered the Chipotle Chicken sandwich which was barely OK. There were not a lot of fillings for the bun. I didn't taste any chipotle anything either. The fries were not cooked enough but were seasoned well so there's that. I won't go out of my way to return and may just pass it by anyway."}
{"text":"A year ago, The Spot was our favorite place to go for Friday fish fry. They HAD a nice piece of Walleye spiced well and pan seared perfectly. The past two times I have been there, I was served 3-4 small pieces of greasy fish, maybe 2 ounces, definitely not more. The order typically comes with sweet potato pancakes though I often order seared greens instead because I can't eat gluten. But, my partner has ordered them off and on in the past and they HAD always been large, well seasoned, shredded, pan fried sweet potato pancakes. This last time, they were small, deep fat fried white potato discs. Clearly not the same quality or even the same food for that matter.   The Spot is in our neighborhood, we have been frequent flyers, and while for the most part we have had other decent meals, ( some inconsistency), will never again order the fish."}
{"text":"A friend that's native to Madison recommended this restaurant for an early Saturday dinner, and I owe him thanks for that.  This very unassuming, yet simplistically charming place boasts great food and service.  It's in a place that may have been an old corner store or deli years ago.  One must traverse a large set of brick stairs from the street to access the dining room.  The layout is a bit odd but appears to have been confined by some immovable structures.  What results is a small front dining room and a smaller back dining room with a bar.  But the outdoor patio deck is certainly the coveted location.  It's a beautiful oasis and you won't even know you are in the city.  More simple decor, like the interior, creates a warm and inviting environment.  Cocktails were pretty fantastic.  My friend ordered a Vodka and Tonic ($6) for a tall with call Vodka from local darling Yahara Bay.  And my Bloody Mary ($7) had a great depth of flavor.  There was a definitive garlic taste but that was nicely balanced by worcestershire and celery salt.  A sold cocktail for sure.  The friend I was dining with is celiac, and we had no problem ordering within those limits.  Our server was very knowledgeable and extremely accomodating to our questions.  We started the meal with an order of Gorgonzola Chips ($6).  Thick cut house made potato chips are topped with a melted gorgonzola cream sauce built with cream, white pepper and basil.  This version of this dish fared much better than others that I've had elsewhere.  This sauce did not seize and stayed creamy and decadent the entire time we noshed.  And the basil was added in the perfect amount to been seen and tasted, but not to steal the show from the bold blue.  Our second starter was the Vegetarian Trio ($10).  Three spreads; white bean and herb hummus, black olive tapenade and mihara were served aside house pickled grapes and carrots, goat cheese stuffed dates, figs, gluten free crostini and rice crackers.  The spreads were all great, each with a very deep and distinct flavor.  The pickled items balanced the richness of the spreads well.  And the figs and dates added just a touch of needed sweet.  It was very apparent that this was a very well thought out dish and for that we were very appreciative.  Our shared entree was the Poor Man's Paella ($16).  Large shrimp, spicy chorizo, and basmati rice were seasoned by a blend of fresh diced tomatoes, bell peppers, paprika, fresh garlic, chili paste and fino sherry.  The base flavors were good but the overall dish was slightly overcooked and dry.  Just a tad more tomato and a bit less cooking and it would have been perfectly delightful.  All three dishes were very plentiful and we could have been satisfied ending out meal there.  But two words changed all that:  Panna Cotta.  Specifically Homemade Mango Panna Cotta with Coconut Cream ($6).   This was one of the best panna cottas I've ever had!   The consistency was nearly that of flan and mango permeated every delectable bite.  The coconut cream topping was comprised of a lightly toasted coconut that brought out the richness which was a nice compliment to the naturally sweetened mango.   It was a great choice that I would make again in a heartbeat.  With great service and a nearly flawless meal I will certainly make the choice to return here next time I'm in town.  And within minutes of leaving we were certain to send a message of gratitude to our friends that made the awesome recomendation, so I'm happy to pass that favor along to you and encourage you to check this place out."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! I came here with a friend about 3 weeks ago for a quick bite to eat and let me say.. I'm so glad I did!! They even have a healthier menu for those that are calorie conscious. I LOVE that they serve breakfast all day and it doesn't have to be a certain time for you to be able to order eggs.   On my first day in, I had the veggie spot scramble. Oh. My. God. I'm kind of a health geek so this was perfect! Who doesn't love avocado, mushrooms, onions?? So delicious! The lady sitting next to us had the french toast and said it was absolutely to die for! I can't wait to go back and try more entrees, its the perfect spot! (Pun intended)  I would GLADLY drive from Phoenix to Gilbert to visit this place.  My only complaint is that its a bit small (kinda like a loft). Its wonderfully designed though, I would just be cautious of when you're coming in so you can beat the rush! Never hurts to call in advance. But its perfect for about 2-4 people!! :)  Ps you can also opt in for deals! And they have a great happy hour!"}
{"text":"My friend and I split our meals for double the fun. We had the summer salad (they were kind enough to split it for us) and the mini sliders ... The summer salad was very refreshing on this very hot saturday afternoon in AZ. I loved the pecans, strawberries and gorgonzola cheese that  hit the spot with a San Tan Brewery Epic Center (Amber), the onion strips and mac & cheese were perfect with the delicious slider burgers where we had one of each that were offered (3) to choose from. Of course sitting in the loft made it even more fun!"}
{"text":"Over the past few months, the service has gotten worse.  Upon reading some of the recent comments, I'm seeing the same issues with inconsistency.  Usually there's something wrong with the order.  For example, we ordered the \"spot\" chicken tonight with no bacon or onions and add avocado.   It came with bacon, onions and no avocado.  How do you mess that up?  Sometimes it'll come with a fries instead of a salad, even though the menu says it clearly comes with salad.      The food is mediocre at best and when the order isn't right, it's just not worth it anymore."}
{"text":"Fun little place, though seating is REALLY limited so if it's busy best to get your meal to go. GREAT sandwiches. If you weren't looking for it, you would pass right by it on Higley next to Fresh and Easy. Don't pass by- stop and eat!"}
{"text":"OMG! YUM!!! We have driven by this hardly noticeable place so many times (they really need a big orange sign out on the road). Some friends had told us about it but since they only talked about their sandwiches, we paid it no mind.  Well, today the place down the street had  a mile-long line, so we decided to give this place a try. It was destiny, not coincedence btw.   It is definitely a small place (which I'm fine with), it took my hubby a minute to figure out where the door was (lol), you order at the counter and find a seat. We had the burger, sliders, kid's pizza and chicken tenders: the burger and sliders were amazing, as of now, the best I've had in this side of town.  The onion straws also some of the best I've had.  The mac 'n cheese was delicious.  The pizza was more of flatbread with cheese (it was tasty but different). If they start offering some good specials and healthier options, we will be going there a lot!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a quick sandwich and someone had highly recommended. i ordered a bacon egg and cheese on a roll. I was told \"we don't make that, its not on the menu\" LOL. They made it for me and charged me almost $7. come on guys, although it tasted good the presentation look like a  four year old made it. It was served on a burger bun, not a roll and it was a mess of cold cheese bacon and egg, not layered like a sandwich should be. I personally made sandwiches for a living and I would have never served that to one of my guest. Something to work on .Very disappointed"}
{"text":"I came here six months ago when I was visiting friends in Wisconsin. It was busy when we got there, so we ordered some (awesome, really awesome) cocktails, and waited for a table on the patio. I'm taking off a star for their lack of vegan options, but putting it back because the waiter we had was super nice, and worked with us to make something off the menu that my vegan boyfriend and I would both like. The patio at night is really lovely, I will definitely go back when I'm in the area again."}
{"text":"We had a very enjoyable dinner at The Spot on Friday evening.  We had a short wait at 6:00, but the place is really cute and cozy, so we didn't mind.  Our table opened up much sooner than the 30-40 minutes quoted.  They have a large drink menu that includes beers, wines and specialty drinks.  My three dining partners all opted for beers and I had a specialty drink called The Foosie Woo Woo (Plantation Rum, fresh lime juice, ginger liqueur, cane sugar, lime: up) I was not disappointed with the Foosie.  For dinner, I had the pan fried walleye that came with mashed sweet potatoes.  The fish was cooked just right and the sweet potatoes were very good also.  The others had the Poor Man's Paella (which I got a taste of and enjoyed very much!) Pulled Pork Meatloaf served with mashed potatoes, and The Spot Burger with greens.  Everyone enjoyed their meal, and our waiter, Adam, was very knowledgeable and personable.  There were two things that disappointed slightly...my water glass did not get refilled until we were almost finished eating, and the sides are a little strange to me: Black Beans & Rice, Mustard Greens, Potato Salad, Seared Greens, Polenta or Mixed Greens with Vinaigrette.  Call me crazy, but I need a french fry option to go with a burger.  All in all it is a great little place.  I hope they do well."}
{"text":"The menu is small and cohesive, you really can't make a bad selection. Make sure to get a window seat so you get the best view of Madison's finest architecture."}
{"text":"Holy hell, The Spot is amazing!  My girlfriend has been bugging me to come check this place out for months, so I finally came in on a rainy day... It's a cute little narrow corridor of a restaurant sandwiched in a strip mall next to a Fresh & Easy, but there's a patio outside and a cute upstairs loft area with comfy couches and chairs. It's  tastefully decorated and it just feels like a nice inviting place conducive to socializing and eating.  I ordered the soon-to-be-famous sliders. Wow. Probably the best sliders I've had in my life - or at least up there. They came with a generous amount of onion strings (sort of like a cross between a seasoned curly fry and a regular onion ring), and a copious side of baked Mac and cheese. It was all really delicious, and a huge amount of food.   They are really punching above their actual price range here... My ticket total was pretty cheap. Everyone here seems super friendly... I would expect a place like this in Austin, Portland, or someplace else hip and cool. I suppose in some ways Gilbert is becoming that. Growing up in the valley, I'm having trouble seeing it...  Anyway, I love this place. Worth the drive."}
{"text":"Decent little place. The poutine was a little disappointing as the gravy was super dark and not creamy and cheese not very melty.  When I order poutine I have high expectations and was just more like tasty fries. I'll recommend a burger and a local craft beer. The service was great. ..staff super friendly and prices were great"}
{"text":"The Spot is definitely a hidden gem in Madison and easily one of my favorite restaurants. I've never been disappointed with any meal I've had. They have an adorable back patio, but the seating inside is also nice and cozy. The back room with the bar is a great place for a group meal. For brunch, you get $3 off your first drink (I think that's the deal) and I highly recommend the chorizo omelette...it's my fave. On Mondays, they have half off wine all night!! I love their grape salad and albondigas, but honestly anything you get will be a win because it's all delicious. They also always have great specials. The staff is extremely friendly too. You won't be let down!"}
{"text":"We were attending a holiday theater event on Capital Square so we wanted somewhere close for an early dinner. We wanted nice but not self-important, precious over-expensive \"fine dining\". We wanted modern, neighborhood place with a calm feel and decent wine. The Spot hit .... (wait for it).... the spot!  The spousal unit started with a vodka basil gimlet (nice) had the Cioppino (very nice) and a roasted root vegetable salad. The roots lacked a 'roasted' taste and needed a bit more tarragon vinaigrette dressing (which was quickly provided). I had the excellent poor man's paella (giant shrimp!), a simple Caesar salad and a glass of very nice Oregon Pinot Noir.  The Spot offers an extended happy hour 4-7PM and half-price wine Mondays. Go check it out. Every neighborhood should have a place like this. Spot on!!"}
