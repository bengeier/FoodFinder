{"text":"The bar is dark and smokey, but they have a fantastic patio.  Food was very good, a lot better than expected and service was wonderful. Will definately be back.  I was pleasantly surprised because I was expecting the typical dive bar, and this place is definately not that."}
{"text":"Went to the bar today at 7pm on a Saturday with 5 of my friends to order some food and drinks. While we were eating the bartender came over to us to tell us to lower our voices. Not only were we on the bar side of place but we were not that loud. Our bill was over $100. It's 7pm. Of course a group of 5+ would be loud. It shocking to me to have service like this. My cousin held her rehearsal dinner here and we did not experience anything like this. Annette the bar tender was the rudest person I have ever experienced at the bar ever. Deseray our waitress was super nice despite this incident. She offered to help us in anyway she can. However I can not believe how Antoinette  treated us. I have come more than once and Antoinette's attitude for no reason does not make me want to come back to the bar despite my many interactions with the owner James before.  I am so disappointed after this.  Additionally, the bartender Antoinette told us to take our business to Remedy's, the bar down the street. I have never ever in my life been advised by the people who work there to take my money to another bar. I am shocked and appalled."}
{"text":"The environment is great n the bartender n waitress were so wonderful. Have to try their french toast w/ bananas on top because its so good."}
{"text":"We come every Sunday to watch football and have their great breakfest. Chelsey and the owner joe are amazing with helping set up tables and get everyone's game, which can be very confusing haha. Great place, recommend it for everyone"}
{"text":"@ Bermuda & St Rose  Well...let me first say that the only reason why my  and I come here is because of the people and definitely the food!!! Yes, there are video slots, and a dining area (if you have anyone 20 and under with you) as well.  You are always greeted when you first walk through the door. They make sure you are okay before you leave. Everyone that work there are super friendly!!! They are very attentive and always take care of you.   Everyone NEEDS to try their deep fried pb&j!!! And also, the deep fried oreos!!!  Prices are not too horrid. But then again..it is Vegas right?! If you are NOT willing to pay for good service, then why bother stepping into the place?!  Bottom line, this place is phenomenal!!! Great food! Great customer service! Great staff!!! Definitely a place to visit!!!  xOOx"}
{"text":"Food is pretty good and the staff is okay. The machines are junk- been here 3 times and never had a good hand. Tried multiple games and they are super tight. Unfortunate for such a good looking place."}
{"text":"It was my Wife's Birthday and we decided to try to go there for a couple of drinks, and maybe have something to eat. We got there at 6:00pm on Tuesday, and sat at one of the tables in the bar.  We waited and waited for someone to come over and ask us if we wanted a drink or just to say welcome. After 14 minutes waiting we decided to walk out. As i drove out of the parking lot I  counted 12 cars, Guess they where to busy to handle 13 cars. SO SAD !!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I stopped in on Saturday for the first time. I used to go to The Bar at  Grand Canyon  but recently moved to Henderson. This location is a lot bigger than the other one which means not as smokey. I'm a smoker but still don't like walking into a cloudy bar. I gambled a hundred and left with 200 after paying my tab. There were a few people hitting big jackpots as well. The girls took care of the drinks I ordered and still bought me a shot on top of that to \"welcome me to The Bar Family\".  I'm sorry I can't remember their names. Both very sweet and welcoming, which is unusual woman to woman. I ordered the meatloaf and it was delicious! I know meatloaf doesn't sound appetizing but it was. Overall, I had a great time. I'll definitely be back with my husband very soon."}
{"text":"Good drinks & food! Service however wasn't the best part. Every time we needed a drink we had to go around and look for servers or straight to the bar ourselves"}
{"text":"Love this place! We are accommodated very well here, the servers are awesome and the food is excellent! My favorite dish is the shrimp tacos. The taste is very flavorful and definitely hit the spot :) we also always get the tempura asparagus, very delicious!  Drinks are also amazing. Overall always a good experience here and recommend to everyone to try out for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"LOVE this place!! The food is AMAZING and the prices are great! It's a very nice bar with 2 seperate sections"}
{"text":"The best bar in town! Local friendly, always warm welcome! Keoki and Karla are the best!"}
{"text":"Though my check in says \"1\" I have been here many many many times. BY (before Yelp). Anyways... Every experience has been wonderful. From day, evening & graveyard service from the staff has been top notch. The bartenders have become friends & the owners are super friendly & down to earth. My Mother & her girlfriend practically live here lol   The food is simply NOT your typical \"bar food\"  Tempura Asparagus is amazing. The sauce is bomb.   Turkey Burger is loaded with flavor & a great alternative to your standard burger considering I don't eat red meat.   Fried PB&J dessert needs no words. Just order it.   I have yet to stop into their new locations but I'm sure you can expect the same greatness there. It's a very classy bar, and a nice break from your typical Vegas joint.   Congrats on the success!!! Well deserved."}
{"text":"Food isn't all that great, played $35 bucks on the slot machine at the bar and lost it all,then to top it off when I leave the female bartender charged me for the 3 beers I had..never ever coming back to this place..Remedy's is 100 times better and it's just right up the street from this bar,better food,better service and way bigger too"}
{"text":"The Bar is exactly as described below. Great food, great atmosphere, great people, not to mention the place is beautiful. The entire building is constructed in a red stone which comes from Las Vegas Rock located in Jean, NV. The outdoor patio which is equipped with a fire pit is pet friendly. The bar is a local bar for sure, and the dinning room is beautiful with a home like feel. The service is great, and sometimes if you are lucky the owners will run your food. This place rocks, there is no doubt about it. The bartenders will make you whatever drink you want and the servers will do their best to have the chef prepare and modify anything you are looking for to eat. There are tons of machines in the bar along with smoking and a jukebox. Hours of operation for the dinning room are 8AM-9PM M-F, and 7AM-10PM Sat & Sun. The Bar is open 24/7 and food is available to order and pick up 24/7. These are some of my favorite menu items below.  For Breakfast: The Huevos Rancheros $9 For Lunch: The Philly (their chef is from Philly) $8 For Dinner: The Carne Asada $21.50  Prices range from $5-$38 (the 22 oz Ribeye is the most expensive thing on the menu)  **ALSO, EVERY bottle of wine is half off on Saturdays, every Saturday, all year long!"}
{"text":"Don't go here to gamble! The food is good, but the bartenders are awful. They spent the whole night gossiping in the corner and talking on the phone. I'd rather take my money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great local BAR! Love this place, I walk in and they have my drink ready! Love Keoki, Carla, April , David(bar back), Stacy, Annette, Kyle!! And Jay (the chef) this is the place to be!"}
{"text":"Moved to a neighborhood right by this restaurant so we decided to try it. Really good food! Good service too. A little smokey inside the restaurant, but they have outdoor seating so that helps. Try their Caesar salad and the wings. Fantastic!"}
{"text":"My third visit was very positive. I was pleasantly surprised by a happy upbeat bartender named Chrissy. She offered me food, made a mean coffee drink and downloaded some free play  (very generous) I'll stop by there again.  She is awesome ."}
{"text":"What a great bar, with an amazing staff. I haven't met all of them, but Chris, Karla, Staci, Kevin and Annette are ridiculously awesome. So far I've had the jalape√±o burger, the shrimp tacos, and the prime rib sandwich, all of them were incredible. Great beer selection, and it's a great location for a local bar on the south side. Give these guys a chance!!"}
{"text":"I had a very poor experience.  Bartender was disrespectful and did not show any customer service skills.  She talked down to us as if we were incompetent and did not make our night out pleasurable.  I am hoping her lack of respect was due to a bad day and decided to take it out on my friends and I.  The tone she used to speak with us is one that no one should experience as a patron. Sadly I will not be returning...which is a shame because I live nearby."}
{"text":"My wife ordered the breakfast burrito. Was just ok. Service was spot on! I chose the banana fosters French toast w/crispy bacon. Why was my French toast on the dry side??? I could taste the rum ... Uh huh, a li'l overpowering that rum. Bacon as you can see my my pic was not crispy at all. Coffee was good tho. Service was spot on! Maybe breakfast is not their strong point. Unfortunately, great service couldn't save the breakfast."}
{"text":"My whole family LOVES The Bar. They have great food, a classy and clean environment, and a friendly and helpful staff. They have a great menu with a lot of options, and will accommodate special requests and changes happily. I highly recommend the mini corn dogs, tempura asparagus, and chicken bites."}
{"text":"This is the best bar in Henderson. Great food and awesome service. This place always has a great vibe and is a nice place just to grab a drink or meet up with friends."}
{"text":"The meatball sliders are great!  As for the other food I've tried there...not so much (chicken parmesan sandwich? burger (okay)).  However, based on the other reviews I will keep trying the menu, perhaps my selections were unlucky.  I also find the quantity of food lacking given the price charged for most items.    The specialty drinks are good but again a couple dollars higher than I would expect in a nice, but neighborhood bar.    However, the service is excellent and the hours are very convenient when there are not a lot of late-night selections in this area.  They also have decent football specials if you are going for the game and a lot of seating."}
{"text":"The food is bomb.com but the service is the BEST.  Chris is absolutely amazing...he's very personable, professional and super cute with that ginger beard of his . Just kidding,  but seriously he has superb customer service."}
{"text":"We are very needy.  And we were accommodated.  Thank you beautiful waitstaff for putting us in a side area and letting us watch the ducks game with the sound on!!!!!  Fun food, and yummy drinks.  Loved the asparagus with dip off the starters menu, and the pizza and the seasonal lemon beer and the bottle of wine and the 4 hours we spent with you.  Oh, and loved the FREE internet.  :)  Definitely, coming back for the next ducks game!!! This place should be packed and it's not.  The women are sooooo beautiful and witty!!!  See you soon"}
{"text":"Our bartender's name was Kevin and he was the most disrespectful person ever. I usually never write bad reviews cos I have worked in the industry and know we all can have a bad day. But this guy had a very disturbing vibe. Our first time and he made sure it was the last.  All we inquired was if any of the appetizers on their menu is meatless but his response was \"how the hell would I know I'm not a vegetarian\". He later went on to share how crappy their food is. Ridiculous!"}
{"text":"IDK how I have never written a review for The Bar as it is our frequent happy hour spot. We always have April as our server and she is the BEST! She remembers our drink & food orders every time and is just a great server overall. They have daily happy hour and really good food. I usually get the southwest chicken salad but have tried a large amount of the menu items. You also cannot go wrong with their breakfast menu, a lot of food & a good price! Hangover cure every time."}
{"text":"Stopped in after flying on the only flight worthy B-29 Stratofortress in the world.  The Bar (@ Bermuda & St. Rose) was in the area and seemed a decent place to stop to celebrate such an occasion with Zack M.  The beer was ice cold and the service was lukewarm. If your looking to be a regular this just might be the spot for you. Unknown at this time if I would visit again."}
{"text":"Love this Bar!!!!! Great food with Beautiful and Friendly Servers/Bartenders the food menu adds a couple of twists to your normal bar favorites! Try the Tots with anything.... including replacing the potatoes in the Burritos with them! Keep up The GREAT work \"Bar\" now if only the dining was smoke free....but I'm guessing they aren't busy enough fro pay someone to stand around when it's not lunch hour."}
{"text":"Food is great, drinks are better.  The beers is almost a slushy, which I love!  Service could be better, server seemed put off by questions... Never a good sign.  Service affects my experience immensely, so this place gets two stars  Service much improved!"}
{"text":"Second trip to the bar v ased on a promo of free play.   Gambling was good, great Pandora music, and plenty of tv. Bar keeps are to much chatty kathys among themselves."}
{"text":"Great food, great service and great atmosphere. The Bar earned every one of these 5 stars. Thank you for always showing your customers a great time!"}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of coming here for dinner on New Year's Eve after a long adventure with a friend (!) who happened to be a girl (!!!).  Already in a chipper mood, the service was slow but the company was good, and the food just happened to be delicious.  I ordered the pulled pork sandwich which was exquisite for $8; she had the salmon, which at $17 was a little on the expensive side, but tasted wonderful nonetheless.  A memorable experience on my part."}
{"text":"I like this bar. Nice modern feel to it. The food here is GREAT!!! Not your typical \"bar food\". They definitely take it up a notch. I really enjoyed the wings.   The ONLY thing I dislike.....the smoke can be a bit overwhelming. But, it's a bar. What do you expect??   You must try the fried Oreo's!!! They're delicious"}
{"text":"The bar.  Yep, that's the name of this place.  Creative, eh?  Well, they keep with the theme inside.  There's 2 sections of this place, a bar area and a restaurant area.  Bar area is called \"The Bar\" and restaurant area is called, \"The Restaurant\".  When you go to the restroom the sign says, \"The Restroom\".  At least they keep it consistent.  So this is a local regulars spot for sure.  It has a cheers kinda feel, because everyone who walks in is recognized by the bartenders, and when they walk in the bartenders will yell hello to them using their first name... \"Hi James!\".  When we sat down the bartender was quick to reach out her hand and introduce herself, and ask our names too. Obviously, this is how they get to know everyone's name.  Came in for Sunday Football.  Lots of TV's.  Accommodating bartenders with changing the channel as needed.  Lots of machines at the bar so you can gamble and watch and smoke and drink and eat if you want.  Sensory overload ... love that!  PS - I saw a bartender taking shots on the DL without involving customers or anything.  I'm all for a wasted bartender but why don't you at least have some shots with the regulars?"}
{"text":"Love the food here! It's delicious! The bartenders are great too! Karla rocks! Love coming here on a Saturday night for a nightcap on my way home since it's so close to my house! Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"First of all a big shout out to the hot bar staff, it almost goes without saying but I said it anyway. I must give it up to the kitchen crew because as a man that loves to chow I like the menu ( tater tots, hells yeah) good wings, cold beer, I like it all. Great place to watch a game."}
{"text":"We went here to watch the World Series game. Yay Cubs!! It turned out to be a great experience. It wasn't too crowded. It was quiet enough that you could actually hold a conversation and entirely hear the game. They have a variety of TV screens throughout the bar in various sizes. They also have a couple of games like Golden Tee or whatever it is. It's laid out nicely - plenty of space and tables aren't too crowded together. The beer offerings are alright, but not great. The menu is plentiful and everything is tasty. And the service is very friendly and attentive. So all in all, this is a great neighborhood bar."}
{"text":"This is such a cool place to hangout. Honestly one of the best bars I've ever been. The ambience is so cool. The music, the drinks and the food was so amazing. The waitress, April was the best. She was so kind and she already knows what is our drink. Honestly the best person I've ever met after moving to Vegas last month. Guys check out this place. I'm learning what's it like to be a Vegas local and this bar is a good start for folks like me out there.  Cheers, Batman and Raj"}
{"text":"Good bar food... Better hung over food! Came here after a night of drinking and ordered a chicken sandwich. Food was good, and help soak up all the alcohol. Would recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Our favorite bar! They do not serve your basic bar food, the menu is fantastic! The Totchos are well worth the 10lbs you will gain! We absolutely love the staff as well! Keoki ALWAYS takes amazing care of us at the bar! So happy this is our neighborhood bar. Love this place!"}
{"text":"This location is not the greatest; however, it is off the strip and a relaxing, chill place to hang out if that is what you are seeking. The servers are nice, food was good; however, I was not impressed with the drinks. I asked for one Margarita, tasted horrible, so I had a glass of wine instead. There is not a lot of room for plenty of people, so it may feel a little tight.   Overall not too bad of a place, there may better out there, but for a quick stop at a bar, or a place to hang out with a friend, this may work for you =)"}
{"text":"THE best bar in Henderson! The staff is super friendly, the food is AMAZING, and the people are fun to talk to!! I LOVE this place!"}
{"text":"I was recommended here by a friend and was pleased by this bar.  Food was excellent and different .  Good service and also very friendly service."}
{"text":"I love this place! Their hamburger and tater tots ROCK! The team always make me feel like part of the family."}
{"text":"We have a second home in Anthem that we visit about once a month.  We make a point of hitting this spot on each trip over.  Great food, great service...April is always a pleasure to see and she makes sure we have an enjoyable experience each time.  We're working our way around the menu and have yet to find a dish that we wouldn't order again.  Great stuff, highly recommended."}
{"text":"Always a fun time at The Bar! Good company, good eats and always a stiff drink. Whoa! The staff is welcoming to both regulars and newcomers, which rocks when you don't have to wait for either service or a witty observation of an unsuspecting patron."}
{"text":"Ordered a drink, and mini corn dogs from a really nice girl bartender, but ended our visit unhappy   We only had time for one drink, and didn't finish our corndogs because we felt extremely uncomfortable. In the middle of our visit a song came on that we liked, and my daughter started to whistle to it. I make fun of her for whistling all the time, and eventually we were trying to whistle to the song together but we're laughing because we couldn't finish one line of the song. Keep in mind we didn't even finish our first drink so we were not drunk at all. We then heard a comment from a bartender who hadn't talked to us since we sat down saying \"no one wants to hear you whistle..\" I thought she said something like \"we like your whistling,\" but she then said something along the lines of \"everyone wants you to stop.\" We were both a little shocked so we asked for our bill. She made another rude comment and that made me even more upset, because there was no reason for it. We then paid our bill and left, sadly I left a dollar tip because of her rude comments but our bartender was good, in fact we enjoyed the food and the atmosphere until the comments from the blonde bartender started.   I can understand if whistling in a sports bar is annoying, but the way the bartender handled the situation was very catty and unprofessional. If she was to ask us to tone it down, or let us know others were complaining (which we did not get that vibe from any of the men at the bar, in fact they were laughing along with us) we would have gladly stopped.   It felt more like a catty girl moment, and it's disappointing because that was our first time trying out The Bar, and again we enjoyed everything up until the bartender was unprofessional.   Also, it's a sports bar on a Friday night during march madness...If whistling bothers you that much I hate to think what would happen if people start singing along to a song in your bar."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Come here a lot when family is in town.  Everyone always loves it.  All types of awesome sandwiches.  Drinks are always good as well.  Great bar menu.  Also have shuffleboard which is fun.  Only complaint is if you eat there early and can't sit in the back side, the bar side is very dark.  Must work out for drunk guys trying to get laid."}
{"text":"Hands down best local bar in Las Vegas! My bartenders name was Kevin, and he rocks! Kevin suggested the French dip w/ truffle, next level! Kevin also made one of the best old fashioned I have ever had! Can't wait to come back! Thanks Kevin!"}
{"text":"great place good food and @ 3:00am RYE did a good job."}
{"text":"When I moved a few blocks  away 3 years ago, I was totally excited about having a local bar to hang out at nearby. I walked in here one night with my girlfriend and we went and sat down at a table. After 10 min and not a SOUL even acknowledging us, we got up and walked over to the bar. After another 5 min of being ignored, we walked out. I've never been back and never will. Mind you, I managed restaurants and catering businesses for years in SF. I expect the same treatment I would give. And I dealt with all types of people too. Guess if you're not a regular, you should just avoid the place... newcomers NOT welcome...."}
{"text":"I've lived in the apartments next to the bar for a year and it's been, hands down, one of the best spots in town. From last minute food pickups to all night drinks, they've always been able to accommodate. Food aside, which is fantastic, the best part about this bar is the bartenders. Chelsea, Chris, Karla, Stella, and Annette all have friendly and magnetic personalities that make each drink an enjoyable one! It's only now that I'm moving that I appreciate the gem I had next door!"}
{"text":"Great staff! Good environment. Good food. They have a healthy menu that always taste better there than when you make it at home. I have started going here about once a week."}
{"text":"This is a fantastic bar, the food is great and so is the staff!  I feel very welcome there as I'm sure everybody else does!"}
{"text":"The bartenders are always nice, and the service is quick. The food is really good, and the prices are reasonable. I usually have good luck on the machines as well!  The place doesn't seem as smoky as a lot of bars, and they have a separate nonsmoking area, and one area that's what I would call partially nonsmoking. You can't smoke in that area, but you're not sealed off from the smoking area.   We always know we will have a good experience here!"}
{"text":"My husband and I live nearby and only stopped here initially for a few drinks. Once we tried the food, we couldn't stop going back for more! The mac N Cheese bites with cheese dipping sauce is AMAZING! Nachos, huevos rancheros, pastrami sandwich, burger, sweet potato fries with a side of honey.......We've had everything from breakfast to dinner here and loved every meal! The food is a fair price too. This is NOT your typical bar food. Every time we go in we have the best service. The staff is always there to ensure you have what you need, super friendly, and always make great recommendations on the next great meal to try. When we had family in town, we even hopped on over and had them try it because we are so impressed. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants to have a drink with good company or just sit down for a good meal anytime during the day."}
{"text":"The meatloaf was awesome! Wedge salad didn't have blue cheese crumbles but was decent. Turkey avacado wrap was huge and tasty.  Overall very satisfied with taste of food, thought some of the food was overpriced though"}
{"text":"This place is my go to for happy hour for several reasons: 1) you can't beat the $2 wells and $2 drafts. 2) Great, quick service. 3) it's close to my house.   I really like the dark loungey style. They have a lot of TVs, slots at the bar, and a shuffleboard table.  I've always had a good time coming here with family and friends.   I've only been to the restaurant section once, but the food and service were both great. I really liked that they brought out warm chips and dip to the table."}
{"text":"Yes, this place is out in the middle of nowhere. . . nothing else around it.  I read the reviews and thought I'd give it a try with a couple of friends. The bar is fine if there are few people, but once there were more than a handful, it was a different story. We were asked to move because one of our seats at the bar was in front of a slot machine. I was playing and my friend said that he'd put a couple of dollars in but the waitress disapproved so we had to move to the back.  I think there's better service at a PT's..."}
{"text":"I just ordered lemonade and it cost me $5.50! Are u fucking serious!   Never coming back here again Like seriously... Disappointed"}
{"text":"This is by far the best bar this town has to offer. Take it from someone who was born and raised here. The food is amazing and the service is top notch. If you have not been here you need to come in and experience the outstanding service this place has to offer. I guarantee you won't be disappointed. The server is awesome.     I have commented about this place before and have to say that it is the by far the best bar in town. The food in this place is hands down the best. The service is outstanding and every time I come here the bartender (keoki) is epic she has a way of making you feel like you are at home. The hospitality in this place is outstanding. I would recommend this place to the best of my friends."}
{"text":"Came in on a Friday after a stressful week at work (5pm-.7pm) no fault to the staff but there was a drunk woman in a group of people that was so loud and obnoxious, she made my ears ring.. you know the type.. why do people get louder the more they booze up.  There was two of us, 3 beers one appetizer and we split one sandwich and it was $43.. that's more than BJ's / Lazy Dog Prices. Food quite not to par to the previous mentioned establishments   French Dip.. not roast beef... I swear it was   a philly cheese steak with ajus sauce  Cheddar cheese tots.. not sure what their idea of shredded cheddar is but that was not it.. it was cheese sauce and bacon...  The service was slow but it seemed like our server was the only one working so I can't complain too much  No happy hour pricing or specials -1 star Trying to pawn off a philly as a frenchy -1 star Cheese sawse instead real of legit cheese -1  Would -1 for the lack of mixed music but that's not fair I couldn't really hear it.."}
{"text":"Never again. I've been wanting to try this place since I live close by. Last night my friend and I stopped in and were greeted by the bartender. I explained to her that this was our first time here, so she went over the beer menu with us. I asked her if she recommended the chicken wings and she said, \"they are pretty good.\"  When she delivered my beer she said, \"here ya go grandpa....\" I am 48 and my friend is 25 years old. Hmm... That was all the service we received. Our beer glasses sat empty for over 15 minutes. She walked around the bar several times without making eye contact to us. Finally another bartender came around and I had to stand up and wave my arms and I asked her for the tab. She didn't ask if we wanted something else to drink nor did anybody take our food order, so we paid and then we left."}
{"text":"Had the best service with KYLE! He handle our party without flaw! Always good food , great fun appetizers (not off the typical bar menu)good burgers,   good variety menu. Returning customer."}
{"text":"I was soooo disappointed!  We went here because it was close and I THOUGHT I read something positive about it.  So we decided to try this place.  Horrible choice!  The friendly greeting was not.  \"What can I get ya?\" I don't know if that was a waitress or the bartender but she seemed irritated. Hoping for a creative drink menu (which is what I heard) I was so disappointed..  We tried the Blueberry Lemonade.. not bad if you like super sweet and syrupy.  I don't but that was the only slightly creative drink on there. Then hoping the food would make up for it, we ordered from the menu.  Actually, we thought it was the bar menu and learned it was the actual restaurant menu.. disappointment number ?  Typical bar food.  So, expecting good bar food I ordered onion rings.  Ooops, sorry, out of onion rings.. what? They can't cut up some onions.. NO, because most likely it is a frozen bag of onion rings.  Ok, I'll try Buffalo wings.  Can't go wrong with that right? Wrong! Another frozen bag with a sad excuse for sauce and watery ranch.. it actually just tasted like milk.  My husband ordered their raw tuna concoction and said I shouldn't even try it because it seemed a bit old.. and I'm sensitive to old fish.. that's ok with me.  So, here's the suggestion..DON'T GO THERE!"}
{"text":"Not wanting to take my negativity to a social media outlet, I refrained from writing a bad review for this place for a few weeks. Then yesterday, visions of that horrific experience resurfaced and got another episode of PTEED (Post Traumatic Eating Experience Disorder).  In all seriousness, I do feel compelled to write about how disgusting the chicken sandwich I ordered for lunch was, as it is dishonest to sell such repugnant chow.  Imagine going to the 99cents store, buy some type of boiled subpar pre-cooked rubbery chicken breast, cut is up in slices, keep some fat on it, keep it for 6 weeks and serve it cold on a baguette that looks more like a 20 days old gas station dinner roll. Well...it tasted even worse than that. You also pay $10 for the privilege of eating rancid food.   Thinking of it, I am not even sure it was chicken or if I was the victim of a joke or the cook quit that day. It sounds dramatic, but I can say that this had to be one of the worst eating experience, because 3 weeks later, I actually still think about it. I get borderline angry when thinking that anyone in their right mind would ever dare serve this vile sandwich. I had lunch there previously a long time ago and things were tasty then. I also had food at their other location lately and it was ok. Nothing to write home about but in all fairness, would not expect sensational food from a bar.  Positive: Bartender was nice and friendly."}
{"text":"Great bar!! This place has it all. The food is seriously good... like seriously delicious. The staff is overflowing with super hot girls that are fun and friendly. Some are a little feisty (I'm talking about you, Staci), but that just makes the place that much more fun. I love coming in here for a quick bite and a few drinks... usually that turns into taking a cab home. Those are the best nights. This bar seems to have a good mix of fun drinkers and quality gaming. There's definitely room for both.   I highly recommend the braised pot roast and the jalapeno mashed potatoes. Some seriously good comfort food. The prime rib sandwich is pretty amazing too. So far I've never had something that wasn't delicious. Great atmosphere. I'm not sure if wings are on the menu, but I've ordered them and they were really good. Kudos to the kitchen."}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favorite local bars for when I just feel like having a few drinks in a fun, yet relaxed atmosphere. They have great food, the kitchen is always open (I recommend the Edameme) and amazing service. Christian is always an excellent host. I recommend this bar for your causal date night or whenever you may be in the mood for great food at reasonable prices. 5 stars all the way"}
{"text":"Stopped here with the BF for football and happy hour! We sat in the Bar side of the location (not the restaurant side.) The decor is very dark but cozy because the whole back area features bar height booths with banquet seats on a wall side of each booth.     We sat in the large back booth (all banquet bc it was in the corner) with views of multiple tv's so we could watch various games. The waitress greeted fairly prompt and brought over menus. She also explained the hour specials before leaving us to decide on our orders. Waitress was very bubbly and nice so it made for a good experience.   The Food: I ordered sliders which were really good. They were even able to add bacon to them (per my request. No issues and I don't believe we were up charged either.) BF had the Fritos covered chilli dogs with fries (one of the happy hour specials. Which was a lot of food for the price.) I also had a taste of his and they were really good as well. The food came out in a reasonable amount of time which always makes me happy.  Overall a great experience! I would go back and I believe this is would be a great place to do a group event. Relax, fun, friendly, and good food the prefect combo for a good time!"}
{"text":"Happy Hour has to many rules, certain drinks are happy hour prices, appetizers are regular price!  What?????  Won't go there again, there is many places that happy hour is drinks and appetizers are $5. Follow suit or suffer!"}
{"text":"45 minutes to get food and there are only 7 people in the bar. Ridiculous! Way over-priced!"}
{"text":"One of the best local joints in Vegas. The owners are down to earth and hire a great staff with awesome food.  Every location they manage seems to hit the gaming bar expectation right on the money."}
{"text":"Love coming here to relax, grab a drink and have some of the best bar food in town.  This is one place you don't wanna miss to try.  True gem in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Really great service! Was greeted right away at the bar. All the drinks were reasonably priced and tasted good. David the barback was very attentive and came to our table often to check on us. We will be back :)"}
{"text":"Great food, Great atmosphere. Weather you want the vampire no sunlight bar, or the nice dinning room and patio. Food Speaks for itself. I have never had anything bad here for either Breakfast, lunch or dinner it's all good!"}
{"text":"Bad service... was never offered a drink menu. Annette (bartender) poured a rail gin and ginger so fast i couldn't get out the fact that i wanted Bombay. Was getting my day started with work on my phone; the drink sat there at least 15 mins before i could get a hold if her. Not a busy place but she seemed more into entertaining the guys at the otherside of the bar.. wont be back; lots of competition in the area"}
{"text":"We've been coming here for years. The staff is always great. Recently they added some great food options....I highly recommend the hard shell shredded beef tacos! If you're looking for a night out in a relaxing environment with great food, drinks, and gaming...come to The Bar!"}
{"text":"I come here once in a while and everytime we get great service.  The bartenders are always great.  I love this place!:-D  Especially love the wings.  Yayyyyyyy!  Lol."}
{"text":"Damnnnn.... where do you go that you gamble and still get charged? Lol well this is the place! Lol thanks stacy! Talking about gambling 500+ and still have a tab? & even bought you a shot cause how dead it was! What a joke I don't care to pay a tab but I could go anywhere else and gamble at their bar & get comped lol... trust youll never get our service & I'll pass the word! BELIEVE THAT!!!"}
{"text":"This was the first and ABSOLUTELY the LAST time I will ever go to this place. My friend and I walk in and the bartender never greets us in fact the first thing she said to me was \"what are you having?\" So I told her then after I got some money to play I asked her what machine she recommended for keno and she said\"I don't give recommendations every machine has keno\" all as she was walking away from me. She never came by to introduce herself never asked if we were hungry or anything at all in all honesty, the only reason I even know her name is because it's on the receipt. She didn't speak to anyone the entire time we were there except to get a drink refilled but that's literally it.  Keoki  is by far one of the absolute worst \"bartenders\" I've ever seen. I've been a bartender for 20 years and if I treated ppl like she does I wouldn't have lasted a week.  She should just sit in a cubicle in a basement somewhere so nobody has to deal with her.  As I said before I won't be going back there again and I'll make sure I tell everyone I know to do the same."}
{"text":"I live across the street from this bar so it is very convenient for me to go there. I love this barZ drinks are reasonably priced and the food is great! This is a great place to go watch the games or to just relax after a long day."}
{"text":"Great food, amazing staff. Went in for lunch and played a bit and left up a couple hundred dollars. The bartender was very attentive and was always on top of everything. Will be going back, I highly recommend this place if you're looking for something delicious to eat or just a friendly environment to gamble a little in."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad experience here. the food is good and the staff are friendly and always willing to pour you another drink. the chairs at the tables are very comfortable. I like going here for football games during that time of the season. I like a place that is focused on taking care and conversing with their guests. and they do exactly that here."}
{"text":"This is a great bar to stop in to no matter what time of day it is. I've had the pleasure of trying breakfast, lunch, and dinner here and each time I was always satisfied with the food I received. The bartenders and servers are always friendly. Plus they make sure your food comes out fast, even if the bar is packed full with guests. Also, you can order food to go at the bar and sip on a drink or two while they prepare your food. Always pleased with this location and look forward to coming back in the future."}
{"text":"Food is always delicious, friendly staff, great machines. Chris the bartender keeps us coming back, he is great!!!!"}
{"text":"Met with some friends last night, service at the bar, poor (Carla) and some bald bar back with an attitude, I paid him for the tab for my two friends and they ordered one more drink, they then asked for their bill and the received a $84 dollar tab, when I got upset about their obvious blunder they 86'd me from the bar and then claimed they did nothing wrong.  No loss, what used to be a good bat has lost the plot, there's a reason they work behind the bar."}
{"text":"I always though it was impossible to royally mess up breakfast. Tonight I learned I was wrong. Decent wings though. Never again shall I return."}
{"text":"Great little place. It can be a little bit busy and fun on the weekends. The waitresses from the M sometimes hang out here, so if your game is tight, give it a try.  I had the bananas foster French toast this morning. What a great dish! Sweet and tangy with a couple strips of chewy bacon. It really hit the spot and help my (slight) hangover.  Now I gotta go pick up my car..."}
{"text":"Worst gaming in area. But is good. I don't care nice your tits are! A female bartender with a dirty mouth is only attractive in movies. Really shitty sadly!! I'm not gonna say her name but this needs to be remedied   I've met the boys/twins that own this place back in 2007 and thought they were awesome. I know it's hard when you experience success to weed out potential hazards but this girl is offensive and I'm very open.   Thanks Me"}
{"text":"One of our favorite neighborhood bars! Really good food and drinks. Every time we come here April is our server and she goes above and beyond. She remembers our order every time and gives great service. There are a lot of tvs including a big screen which makes it perfect for games."}
{"text":"We discovered the BAR a few weeks ago and LOVE IT!  the service is great!  we love Cathy and Charly and everyone has been nice.    In vegas most bars that have poker machines just take your money for the free drinks.  These machines actually PAY.  we've always left a winner and one day i even got 4- 4ofakinds in one day.   the food is YUMMY,  you can build your own sandwich, or chose from some creative options.    Its close to home, affordable, and friendly.  what more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"First time here and we loved the food the atmosphere was great, but the only reason it didn't get 5 stars was because of our server she was a total space case."}
{"text":"It's v-day left the kids at home for a little quick bday for my husband ( he wanted their chicken fingers) we had a sweet waitress April she recommended the fish and chips which were Ahhmazing!!! For vegas bar food this place is bomb! Good waitstaff!!! To top it off they brought me a rose !! How sweet is this!! I will def be back.  Come here if you want real bar food!!!"}
{"text":"I frequent this place every so often because it is close to where I live. I will get their take-out and sometimes meet friends at the bar. The bar food is pretty good, but if you get take-out make sure you check your order because it seems like every third time they are missing something in the bag (e.g., salad dressing, etc...). The service is hit and miss depending on who's working. Sometimes the servers are real attentive and sometimes you get the bitchy female who is not even friendly and does not check on you. I would give this place 3 2/3rds Stars if I could."}
{"text":"This place is over rated.food is good but when I ordered a steak which was highly recommended it had a lot of fat in it and the portions were very small for the dollar amount attached. Def a miss and have been back since. I'm not a drinker so the food was the only shot."}
{"text":"Everytime we drive by this place on our way to the M we say we are going to stop in.  The other day we finally did.  I have to say that most of the reviews for this place were absolutely worthless so I really didn't know what to expect.  First off, this place is very dark but that doesn't really bother me.  I can drink beer in the dark.  The beer prices are pretty good.  $3.75 for a domestic 16 ounce and I think $5 for an import.  They also have 22 ounce glasses for only a buck or so more.  They have about 12 beers on tap including Newcastle, Ranger IPA, and another Brown Ale I've never heard of.  Their bottle selection seemed to be a little bigger and I saw they had one offering of Stone, not sure which one.  The waiter for our group of five was on top of it and we drink a fair amount.  At our table we had wings, boneless wings, a bbq burger, a patty melt, tater tots, fries, and nachos.  I tried most of the food and we all seemed to agree that all of it was pretty great.  The boneless wings were a little dry and the sourdough on my patty melt was a little too toasted.  Other than that, we were pretty pleased.  They have a happy hour M-F from 3-6 that seemed pretty awesome.  $2 light beers and some cheap food."}
{"text":"Been going here 2 or 3 time per month. Large portions and fantastic food! Staff is the best in town, friendly and fast. Best neighborhood bar I've ever been to."}
{"text":"Have you ever had a Reuben sandwich??? Unless you've been to \"The Bar\" here on St. Rose & Bermuda, then NO you haven't!!! Trust me, get the Reuben with the sweet potato fries and you will understand why this review doesn't need any more descriptions. Thank you."}
{"text":"I'm changing my review to zero stars so far this was our worst dining experience since we've arrived in Las Vegas I was trying to give this place the benefit of the doubt because it seemed to me that this place was mostly a bar not only was the service terrible as I stated in my prior review The food was not so great either The reason why I'm going back for a second review is because my wife actually became sick shortly after we ate there and it lasted for a couple of days coincidence maybe but I don't know I really hope this place straightens up their act it seems like it would be a decent place to hang out and it's literally minutes from my house"}
{"text":"Rude bartenders. All 3 times I've gone. But if you can withstand it the food is great."}
{"text":"This bar is phenomenal.  There are many bars in Vegas, tons.  Particularly gaming bars.  This one takes the cake.  Their cocktail waitresses are attentive and friendly and their food is above par.  Susie was the cocktail waitress taking care of me and my friends.  She was clearly aware of everything that was happening with my friends and I at all times and offered all of the right things at the right time.  If you visit many bars, then you know how fantastic that is, particularly in Vegas.  Many Vegas cocktail waitresses these days seem to have an attitude of \"I will get to you when I feel like it\" while making you wait till they remember you are there.  Susie was there before I even thought to look for her.  Not just once, not just twice, but over and over again from the moment I got there till I left.  She might be the greatest cocktail waitress I have ever witnessed, and I have visited many bars.  I can't think of a single word except perfection.  Sounds a bit over the top, I know, but I am a service junkie.  I can only dream that every bar I go to has a cocktail waitress like Susie.  This is coming from a guy who hates gaming bars.  I can't stand them.  Here though, I recieved better service than many upscale bars I attend regularly.  Notably better.  Is that all?  No.  I was hungry and in the mood for spinach.  Yes spinach, I like spinach and on occasion I crave spinach.  A spinach salad at a gaming bar? \"I will just hope for the best\" I thought.  Then it came.  A perfect looking, fresh spinach salad that also had a touch of personality.  Strawberries and glazed walnuts with goat cheese and a maple vinaigrette.  I was astonished how great this salad was, and I am a tough critic with food.  The only downside to this bar is that it is very far from my home and on the complete opposite side of town.  I hope that the fundamentals that make this place great are maintained and expanded upon with success and new locations closer to me.  The only suggestion I would give is to give your bar and future bars a more unique look and feel to astetically separate them from the mess that is the mass of other gaming bars in Vegas that are no where near your level.  Thank you for the refreshing experience.  I wish you great success."}
{"text":"Third time here and had the same bartender who is such a joy. (Don't know his name but he's always here late night) such a nice clean bar, great music, food is yummy, and good price range here. I live right down the street so I'm glad this bar is a on my good list! Lol."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years. The food is always amazing and the bartenders are great. So fun to watch football here. By far one of my favorite neighborhood bars. Always feel welcome."}
{"text":"The greatest spot ever to just have a meal and etch the game. Not to mention they're never crowded, lots of sports TVs on, very spacious and clean. Annette is one of the severs /waiters there and she is just amazingly sweet. The prices are affordable for the amount of food they give you. Plus they offer military discount and that's always a plus!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This was today's sunday football watching spot:  *Football setup: awesome. They have sunday ticket and 3-6 games are visible on flatscreens depending on where you sit. *Atmosphere: Bland (marroon walls and not much else), but it did have a certain sophisitcated feel. *Beers: 18 on tap. Stella was $4.50/pint. No football specials - WTF. I will say my Stella was served in a REALLY COLD glass, so major points for that. *Food: Sadly the cool entrees (carbonara, etc) are only served after 4 PM, so we were limited to bfast or bar food. We tried a platter called \"the Goods\". Buffalo chicken bites, pulled pork potato skins, and mini corn dogs. All were fabulous (duh, it's fried stuff!), but they do get special props for the pulled pork potato skins. They were relatively original (don't see those much) and quite tasty!  A nice local alternative to PT's and the usual suspects. I'm anxious to get back to try their banana brioche french toast and the carbonara on the dinner menu. Still bummed they don't have footballs specials!"}
{"text":"It was a chill environment in the restaurant. Smell of smoke strong from the bar. Came in through the restaurant side, but I believe it's all connected. Food was just okay. We had nachos, sliders and wings. Wings by far the best option of the 3"}
{"text":"April was wonderful. Very quiet on this Friday night on the restaurant side. Bar was awesome busy. Food was really good and affordable. Entrees a little pricey. Didn't order any to find out if worth it. Maybe another time.  Love the homemade potato chips. Ask for a side of BBQ sauce with them. Yummy!"}
{"text":"This Bar is near my Real Estate office in Silverado Ranch and yet I have never chosen to visit because I am always in a hurry to meet a client. Serendipity and a cancelled appointment offered the opportunity to stop in recently and give it a try.  Rumor had it that they had won an award for best local pub /or pub food, so it was on my radar. Friendly bartender, Chelsea, was hosting when I stopped in.   There was no one at the bar so I had the opportunity to converse freely with Chelsea.  No airs or graces, just a down to earth decent, hard working girl who recommended a wonderful burger and a decent IPA. Kudos to the chef. Restaurant quality burger! So many low energy people tell me that they don't like Vegas because it is full of poseurs...They need to get out more. Little neighborhood bars like this one are a privilege to visit. You walk out of here feeling better than you did when you went in and that is a sign of a great establishment."}
{"text":"I live about a mile from this bar and for years I've driven past it but I finally went in for some appetizers and a beer. I will definitely be back, great atmosphere and good bar food. Don't pass up the fried Oreos! MUST HAVE!"}
{"text":"So went here to watch game 4 of playoff for vgk. Come at least once a week more often than not 2 times a week sat down at poker machines like we do every time we are in there .... So bartender karla comes over almost as soon as we came in and got drink orders on top like they usually are! Then there was a guy behind the bar a bartender i asume as he walking by he ask if we need anythin i have a half beer setting in front of me and ask for menus for me and the guy with me.. he proceeded to pull out one of the sighns that say players only and puts it on the machine infront of me... i understand these rules but how ever i think i had like $40 in the machine in front of me he just covered up in an attempt to tell me i need to play to set there again$40 in the machine currently playing i had to move his sighn to continue to play the machine i had already put the 40 in..... so then i ask for menues from Karla i beleive her name was she puts a menue on her beer drain in front of the taps i seriously didnt know if she needed it for something else or was that an attempt to hand me a menu only one menu 2 grown men... then my friend ask again for a menu YOU NEED ONE TO was karlas responce  IN NO WAY SHAPE OF FORM did we share anything much less a menu....well thank you miss karla because your nice and welcomeing demeanor we wont be comming back we have player catds u can check out how much we have spent not a fotune but enought to be treated just a little nicer"}
{"text":"A luxurious but relaxed bar atmosphere; excellent bar food; stellar service.  I don't know what more I could ask for in a place like this!   There is the bar/lounge section of the restaurant and also a dining section (separate from the bar and gaming, it's on the smaller side with some large, comfortable booths and tables).  Both are well-ventilated and surprisingly don't wreak of smoke, unlike some of the other gaming bar/restaurants in town.    Service was top notch.  Our server was so friendly.  You could tell that she needed to be in both the bar and dining room but she did a fantastic job of keeping drinks full and being there to check in on us at all the right times.    The food came out SO quickly and was just the ultimate of bar food!  Even the most basic things like the mozzarella bites as an appetizer were simply delicious!  Hubby had meatloaf sliders and I had burger sliders and they were both incredible.  Being able to sub fries for tots was a very nice change.   The menu is large and there are so many things I want to try.  And I'd love to sit on the patio when it cools down slightly.  My only problem: this place isn't closer to home.  If it were, I'd totally be a regular.  Give this place a try - it's even worth driving a bit if you don't live in the area!"}
{"text":"The Bar is a cool, laid back place with large flat screen TVs everywhere. I might not be the biggest fan of sports, but when a tennis game or the Olympics comes on those gorgeous screens I cannot help but watch in awe. The banquette seating along the walls are comfortable and lounge worthy. After a few sets of volleyball, I was slouching down as if I was sitting on my couch.  The beers are reasonable at $4-$5 for a pint and $5-$7 for a 22oz draft. When drinking, it is hard not to snack and their pretzel bites with cheese sauce are definitely a winner.   The staff was considerate and checked in on us often. Our waiter started to slow down close to the end of his shift. It was still pleasant because we were just chilling. I liked the fact that he was not put off with us ordering a few drinks and a snack. Coming from the service industry, it can be frustrating. We were there to relax and he didn't hassle us."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place!!! I've gone twice in the past week.   1) it's a dark and chill bar 2) they play music from Steve Miller Band, Dave Matthews, Led Zeppelin, & Country 3) they have fried corn dogs as appetizers 4) they have a grilled cheese and tomato soup on their menu for $5.99 5) they have sandwiches under $10 & entrees over $15 6) they comp your drinks when you play 7) patrons are really friendly, classy, and well mannered 8) their food is good 9) it's close to my house 10) they have a ton of TV's for sports  Go Try it !!!!"}
{"text":"My husband & I decided to go have a couple drinks (which we don't get to do often) after our kids went to bed on St. Patty's Day & we ended up having one of the best times. The Irish mules were delicious & the fried pb&j was heavenly. Our bartenders (Karla & Keoki) were awesome! They made our visit to The Bar extra fun. They were extremely attentive & were so sweet with the most positive attitude. They mesh well together & the whole place was enjoying their entertainment. Thank you ladies for taking such great care of us. We will most definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"The Bar is an amazingly great find. While it is a locals hang, outsiders and visitors are welcomed with open arms. I get a sense if someone comes back a few times it would be easy to be considered a \"local\". The food is great, the bartenders are super friendly and the owners are cool. Try the sliders, the wings, the steak and the new Cuban sandwich. Bring your A game, a great attitude and you will have fun. Be sure to play the machines and tip and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I have been here about 4-5 times.  The food has always been good and the service is friendly.   Great bar in the middle of nowhere.  I've sat at the bar and at tables, and the service was equally as good at both.     Too bad it is so far from me. Recommendations: Chicken Sandwich and Jalape√±o Burger."}
{"text":"While scrolling over the rating bar of stars above this review I was planning on selecting 3, but next to the side Yelp described this as \"A-OK.\" The Bar wasn't, so we move down to 2 stars \"Meh. I've experienced better.\" Yep.... That's it... Totally correct. I live inches from this place and we obviously were struck with some short term memory loss when we decided to go to dinner here last night. We knew going in that the menu is limited. How many pizzas and versions of tots covered in something can you have?  The beer selection isn't very good, I will admit they have added a few more \"craft\" brew options since the last time I was here.  Last night our server wasn't the greatest. She seemed overwhelmed. She was serving us (we were the only people at a table on the bar side) and apparently serving the restaurant side too. That's not her fault, but it's totally not ok. That's like running a day care and having all your kids in separate rooms. How can you watch over everyone's needs properly? She forgot to put one of our meals in with the proper removals (after she wrote the whole order down), and our appetizer came without it's cheesy dipping sauce. She knew she wasn't on point. She did bring the dipping sauce after a few minutes and she admitted after we paid that she forgot to put in the sandwich without avocado.  Girlfriend, stop. Slow down and think about the service you are giving right now. Work smarter, not harder.  My martini was so fresh to the table it hadn't even touched my hands yet.... during a poor post ordering menu hand off at what I believe was 50% fault of boyfriend and 50% fault of server, 50% of my drink covered 50% of the table. Damn martini glasses! It was grossy sticky from alcohol and sugar rim explosions, and maybe just maybe I would have liked to have been offered a fresh one.  Upon tasting I would have really liked a new one. It was the worst Raspberry Lemon Drop I have ever had.  Over all: let down. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"I'm impressed so far... Sitting at the bar and its not smokey.... Food is good, I had the nachos! Hubby had philly cheesecake and love it and got the tators over the fries.... I found out they have a dining area for kids to go which you couldnt tell by just driving by... I wish more bars and resturants sent out coupons from time to time.... I would of tried this bar out like 3-4 yrs ago if they would of just sent out coupons.... When your married there is NO shame in using a coupon.... Take note of that THE BAR!!"}
{"text":"I have driven by this spot many times, and finally decided to go for dinner late last night.  \"The Restaurant\", which is adjacent to \"The Bar\" serves the exact same food, but is closed at 10pm most nights.  \"The Bar\" however is open 24 hours and serves the exact same food.  It was great!! Comfortable atmosphere, great service.  I had the tomato soup with grilled cheese and a Chairman Salad, which was amazing.  I am not a huge salad fan, but in my attempt to be healthy, I ordered it.  Probably one of the best salads I've ever had.  Perfect meal!! I am probably going back again tonight for more!"}
{"text":"Well we moved into the neighborhood almost a year and a half ago both of us like to get out and drink gamble and socialize this place is awesome in every way the food is top notch the machines pay back and I saved the best for last the bartenders are incredible they remember your name what you drink it's so nice its truly your bad if you don't enjoy this place"}
{"text":"This place is bad @$$!! Nice and dark for some decent day-drinking action, great food, and not too smokey! Not the cheapest, but definitely not super expensive, great service too!"}
{"text":"Not bad for a corner poker bar. The decor is nicer than you'd imagine, and I was there for a match play which netted me $100. The staff was friendly and if my favorite place to play wasn't right down the street, I may have returned to The Bar after my initial visit.  Offer me another match play, however, and I shall return!"}
