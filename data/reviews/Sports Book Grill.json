{"text":"5 stars based on what it is. Quality fries and the California chicken sandwich was well cooked with lots of avocados.... Could use some sort of sauce. Can also order from cocktail waitresses. Great for a sports book all day session."}
{"text":"This quick eats place is located in the race and sports book area, right across from the Lion King theatre.

We were looking for something tasty and not so hoity toity place when we found the eatery.  The BF was in the mood for philly cheese steak and voila! They do serve it.  The sandwich is good for 2 people and it comes with good fries.  When you buy a drink, do they offer 1 free refill but be wary what time it is.  I guess we got there close to closing time.  The lady told us about the free refill, but she didn't mention it to us that they were getting ready to close.  

By the time I finished the drink and went back up, she said \"Sorry we're closed!!!\" and  I was like \"I just wanted to get a refill\" and she said no.  So the BF goes up to her and ask her for water and she said no, that they have already cleaned everything and there's no more fluids in the soda machine.  BIG BUMMER! I wished she would've told us in the beginning =(

The price range for the food could be like $8.50 for a chilli hotdog to less than $18 for a nice salad.  They also have small tables that you bring your food to or you can sit  and eat at the leather chairs if you wanted to watch the sports game."}
{"text":"We went to this Sports book not knowing what to expect since I read reviews on this being overly priced and not that good. Well to our surprise it was super yummy. We ordered a turkey sandwich and it came with french fries. The turkey sandwich was so yummy and with a lot of turkey! Totally worth it! I recommend this place for fast and normal food on the strip! Cant beat a good sandwich/food and great place to watch sports."}
{"text":"At Mandalay Bay there aren't many casual places to get a snack and I'm always eating... Sports Book Grill is hidden in a corner and was a good place to grab a quick bite.

The turkey club sandwich for $11 was stacked high and the fries were tasty.

No complaints here.  I would come back if I stay at Mandalay Bay again.

{"text":"Pleasantly surprised by this out of the way stand. Food prices were pretty good - we got a burger and chicken fingers, and found the portion sizes to be generous. The fries were good, as many other reviewers have mentioned.

Since it's in the Sports Book, nobody under 21 can eat here. They do offer takeout though. Their menu is probably among the more kid-friendly of the restaurants. We had a food & beverage credit with the room and this was also one of the only places open later at night.

Service is somewhat slow so they lose a star. Beverage/dessert prices seem out of proportion compared to the reasonable food prices."}
{"text":"I came here because of a recommendation from one of the bartenders at the Mandalay Bay.

The food is actually really good.  The fries were perfect.  As long as you get there before the rush, your order comes our pretty quickly.  Since it's in the sports book, be prepared for a rowdy bunch."}
{"text":"We didn't eat, we just had drinks at the bar but it was a great experience. We were looking for a bar we could gamble at, and this is one in Mandalay Bay that has machines at the bar. Drinks are free if you're gambling. Lots of tables and waitress service at the tables. Food looked good/fattening sports bar food. Ain't nothing wrong with that.

The World Series is going on right now so that was on all the TVs. Customer service at the bar was great. They had beer, wines and hard liquors. The bartenders are prompt to refill drinks and polite."}
{"text":"While You can't expect 5 star food or service at a snack bar/grill there's next to nothing positive;

Positive:
- staff is friendly enough

Cons:
- poor menu selection 
- food is not cooked as ordered
- payment systems are either broken, slow or both
- staff not knowledgeable 

I won't be back, definitely wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"I got the hot dog and fries ($7). It comes with a pickle too!

Staff is wonderful.  I ordered it to-go, sat down and ate it while watching ESPN.

I will come back here."}
{"text":"Decent food but it takes FOREVER to  get it especially when crowded.  It may not look crowded but be careful.  You order and pay and then you realize there are 50 orders in front of you.  And you can't cancel the order. They should tell you that it will be awhile before you order.  I will not return."}
{"text":"Quite as kept, one of the best places to eat in Mandalay Bay casino.

I frequent Mandalay Bay \"a lot\" and for the price & taste you can not go wrong!!

Plus you are right next to the sports book! Watch a game & enjoy some tasty food

It has a limited menu but I am 3 for 3 on great dishes"}
{"text":"There are better options that are similarly priced.  Go grab a slice of pizza or a Nathan dog (5 min walk)."}
{"text":"Sports grill food for the sports book out in Mandalay Bay, if you are looking for anything beyond that this is not the spot for you.  But the food is plentiful and very much fits the sports grill niche if you are just down to watch some sports on the big screen in the sports book.  the staff is pretty awesome too and they made the experience that much more enjoyable."}
{"text":"Overpriced. Food wasn't that great. Basically what you would expect from the place. Good if you're in a rush and just want to grab a bite but don't expect too much."}
{"text":"All the tables have a great view and despite de fact the place was full for Thursday night football, the waitress was on point with our drinks."}
{"text":"Amazingly this was the best value for food at Mandalay Bay. It is your basic burger, sandwich, fries type of place but it really works.   Located just off the sports booking area it is a hidden gem. Service was friendly and quick and although it is more cafeteria style than a sit down restaurant, IT ROCKED!  If you are more impressed with a good meal and being full than the fancy stuff then you found your place."}
{"text":"Cheapest place in the hotel to get a good sandwich or burger. Pretty good if you ask me. I went here twice during the week that I was working a convention here"}
{"text":"We love this place! If you want a quick, tasty, filling meal while at Mandalay Bay go here. You can get take out and bring it up to the room (way less money and 100x tastier than room service). 
The turkey club is delicious. It is piled high with turkey and bacon. The burgers are great and you get mounds of french fries. 
The people working at the grill are always super friendly too. This place is the best hidden spot at Mandalay Bay if you want great food without the hassle of a restaurant."}
{"text":"The plates here are huge and can be split! I ordered the turkey club, which was good for the price and fresh, it came with A ton of fries for $12, the sandwich could have been split, but with out knowing this my boyfriend got the chicken tender meal which came with about 12 tenders and could have also been split. Good price for the serving sizes and even with out splitting meals still probably the cheapest meal around."}
{"text":"For how much you are paying, this is a legit and viable option when in Mandalay Bay! The food is good. And its cheap (well, Vegas cheap).

If you are looking for selection, avoid it. You should probably avoid anything that looks like a snack bar if you want a huge selection.

The offer a mix of pub and deli finger food. Burgers, sandwiches, etc. 

Its a much better burger than the fast food alternatives in the casinos, and when you add the casino premium to the fast food price, the Sports Book Grill is a much better decision, and far less regrettable later on in the day....If you know what I mean."}
{"text":"It is inside Mandalay bay sport book, go to the sport book and turn left...good price for something inside a casino, generous portion of food, got a turkey club sandwich and it comes with whole bunch of frys too, lots of turkey and bacon, well worth $12.00..."}
