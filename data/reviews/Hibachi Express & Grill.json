{"text":"I have to give a review because this place does not, from my experience, deserve such terrible reviews for what it is. (Are you looking for authentic, expertly prepared Japanese cuisine? Don't expect it here!)  

The parking was easy at dinner time, staff was friendly enough, the service was quick and accurate. The price for shrimp and steak hibachi with double fried rice, no veggie, 1 generous portion of shrimp sauce, and a drink was $11, which I thought was fair. I have a big appetite and the portion size certainly filled me up. It was a lot of food for a fair price. 

The food was good. It was not amazingly fresh like a \"real\" hibachi restaurant, but I was satisfied with the quality of the steak, and the shrimp was surprisingly DELICIOUS. Rice was good. Shrimp sauce good. But, I do not like a lot of flavor in my food, so I enjoyed the relative blandness. It's probably not good for someone with more adventurous tastes! 

The cook/cashier allowed my substitution no problem/no charge because he said he wants to make the customer happy. The ambiance of the restaurant is appropriate for the food, maybe even nicer than I expected. Nice enough to look at while you eat but it's definitely casual enough to wear whatever. They had a decent amount of seating, tables and booths, but it would maybe be hard to find a table at a busy lunch time. Silverware was plastic, napkins cheap, little packets of extra soy sauce available. 

I wouldn't probably take a guest here for a lunch date, but it's good enough for takeout for me when I have that craving and don't want to spend $35 and two hours waiting for it. I just think people who gave this 1 star have absurd expectations for a hibachi express place! 

There is one TV, password-protected wifi, and restrooms as well. 

Major Cons: When I went to fill my soda (Pepsi fountain drinks if you're curious, free refills), the Pepsi was out and running completely clear carbonation. He fixed it in under 5 minutes, but I can imagine it would've taken longer at a busier hour (7:00 pm and there were two of us in line.) They also asked me three times whether it was here or to go, and still got it wrong."}
{"text":"Visited for lunch with my co-worker, and we were both disgusted in the food quality. We both ordered chicken teriyaki, and it had a distinct stale taste. The rice and vegetables were also very bland, and the price was way too high."}
{"text":"Their food is great. I order takeout from here pretty often. They lose a star bc I have gotten overcooked chicken at least twice."}
{"text":"I normally don't write too many reviews but this place was terrible! The food had no taste, the vegetables were so bitter to the point my fianc√©e and I couldn't eat it."}
{"text":"I ordered the hibachi chicken and steak for dinner. The steak and chicken both tasted bland and void of flavor. I'm not a fan of shrimp sauce, so I couldn't just drown the meats in it. Service was quick and efficient, but this sits in my memory as one of my most wasted $ spent on hibachi ckn and steak. For similar price points, almost anyplace I've been locally is better.  This was my 2nd visit to Hibachi express. I just thought I'd give them a second visit on the odd chance that I had caught them on a bad day the first time around. They got me twice ! Lol

I will Not be back."}
{"text":"LOVE this place. I'm definitely a regular. Best lunch spot around, delicious hibachi chicken (I get extra mushrooms) Large portions for totally reasonable prices. And they have a stamp card so when I buy 9 I get one free. cha-ching"}
{"text":"I'm an avid Asian food eater. Especially in regards to hibachi. While it is a more fast paced restaurant I did expect somewhat decent food. But I got BARELY decent food. I ordered the hibachi chicken & shrimp while the food is eatable and filled my stomach there was hardly any flavor, and 4 packets of the soy sauce they supply there was underwhelming. Maybe I didn't see it but usually hibachi establishments have the traditional ginger sauce. There wasn't any... 

In the end, if you're stuck at the Hyatt hotel next door and you don't feel like traveling a distance to get some distant food, this place would suffice, maybe the other menu options are better than what I received?

P.S. Panda Express tastes better than this place..."}
{"text":"I am a vegetarian and I went today to try out the new restaurant with high hopes. Found the place dirty, crowded, very poor service. They served the Teriyaki Veggie delite and there were no veggies in it !! They stir fried some noodles and threw them together and called it veggie. Yuck to this place, no pride or care in what they serve. I called the manager to complain and they give an excuse the manager is out. When I asked when he will be back- 'I don't know'. Would not advise going here."}
{"text":"It was my second time eating here and I only went because Anita's down the street had a long line. Hibachi Express nickels and dimes you. They charge 25 cents for a cup of water and $1 for an extra cup of shrimp sauce. I don't think they should profit on a condiment. I think 50 cents would be better. They also wouldn't accept my stamp card on vegetarian entree. The food is ok...Hibachi Express serves its purpose for lunch during work hours every now and then. However, there are a few better lunch spots in the area. During my visit, a woman complained that there was shrimp in her chicken & beef dish. I understand it's sloppy hibachi but it would be considerate if they were to use separate grills for vegetarians or people with allergies to seafood, dietary restrictions, etc."}
{"text":"I would definitely not return to this restaurant.  We ate here for a work day lunch recently and regretted our choice.  

I had the hibachi shrimp, and my husband had the hibachi chicken.  Neither of us liked our food.  The hibachi flavor just wasn't good.  Additionally, all of our food smelled and tasted like it had been cooked on a grill with oil that was old.  Like if you were to stir fry some food and then stir fry again in the same oil another 50 times.  It simply did not taste good or fresh at all.  

With regard to the shrimp sauce, it tasted fine.  However, it was room temperature, leading me to believe it had been sitting out for some time.  If it had been either hot or cold I would have felt better about it!

And another note on temperature:  the day of our visit was an unusually warm December day, and the temperature in the restaurant was so hot and muggy that we were totally sweaty by the time we left.....not a good way to return to the office for the afternoon.  Yes, it was an unusually warm day.  But it did not appear that the restaurant had turned any air on at all.  

We arrived early - around 11:45, and only had to wait about 5 minutes for our food.  By 12:15, however, the line snaked through the entire restaurant, and we saw several patrons who had been waiting at least 15 minutes for their food.  Given the long line, it makes me wonder if most people like their food more than I do.  I'm more inclined to think it's simply because there are many businesses in that area contributing to the lunch crowds, and not enough restaurants......every restaurant in the area seems to be packed at lunch hour.

Wish I could give a better review, but it just wasn't good."}
{"text":"The steak doesn't really taste like steak ... tastes more like beef tips? Not sure. The shrimp sauce is really watered down so even though I always buy an extra it just isn't enough. I decided to try this although my intentions were Nana's soul food which is next door. I think I'll stick to Nana's next time."}
{"text":"Fast, fresh, hot, and healthy. Each plate is prepared to order. Miso soup is enough for two people. The ambience leaves something to be desired."}
{"text":"We were checking out our new office by the Belk Corporate Building and decided to swing in for some food.  I had the seafood hibachi and it was cooked surprisingly well.  It was still juicy on the inside and the service was fast.  The scallops tasted amazing and shrimp/crab was good as well.  My only qualm were that as the seafood pieces were big, there seemed to be 3/4 to 1 ratio of rice.  Normally I wouldn't have a problem with this, but for paying $12 i would have expected a little more.  My friend said his hibachi chicken was a little dry, but the teriyaki was right on the money."}
{"text":"I was in the area and wanted some hibachi without the hassle. Blahh. I wasn't impressed. They definitely gave me more of the veggies I don't like, ie mushrooms and carrots, vs the good stuff like cabbage and broccoli. I've never seen big chunky mushrooms and chunky carrots as part of a veggie stir fry in hibachi. The food wasn't prepared fresh, it was pre made, so all they have to do is basically reheat it on the grill and serve it. One good thing is that 1 shrimp sauce in included with the order, extras are $1. The rice is a bit dry, so you made need more than one. Also reconsider this establishment for a bite to eat on a Sunday because they're not even open!"}
{"text":"Food was decent; just you're normal Asian fast food. 

Pretty clean on the inside. 

My biggest issue is the guy taking orders had his earbuds in and talking on the phone. Even when I was standing in front of him ready to order, he just stood there, looking at me, and STILL talking on the phone."}
{"text":"It was just ok. For 10 bucks for lunch with a drink I had hoped it would be a little better. I had hibachi beef, which seemed like some low grade cut, no sirloin here. Shrimp sauce and rice was good. Carrot slices and broccoli were both very tiny. Not horrible, but for the money there are much better work lunch options around here."}
{"text":"This place is close to my job so I decided to give it a try. I ordered the hibachi chicken. Not the worse taste ever, actually the lack of taste is the problem. My dish was very bland. The lack of flavor is something I have never experience with this type of food. The portions are generous and you can definitely eat it (if you add a lot of shrimp sauce)In conclusion, I won't be eating here again."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong....always a good meal. Family and kids love it.  Starting to get a little worse...as time goes by. Not sure if they changed ingredients or not. Prices also went up."}
{"text":"Amazing food with amazing help!! First time in I was unsure what to order but was told 2 of the staff members favorite orders. I ended up with the Hibachi Chicken combo and then the miso soup. The chicken combo came with so much chicken and didn't skimp of the mixed veggies either. I asked for extra shrimp sauce cause usually it is my favorite and they had no problem with this. The shrimp sauce was actually the BEST I've had in the area. Traveling back and forth from my office is usually a pain but I will do it for this place. Undeniably my favorite in the city. Also the miso soup was a great side and a wonderful recommendation. On days I can't eat a whole combo I now order just this and am very satisfied."}
{"text":"Ordered take out on my business trip. Everything tasted great. Service was excellent. I only wish I could have come by once more before leaving out of town."}
{"text":"Have to give 2 stars shrimp sauce is delicious but chicken is terribly dry. I ordered hibachi chicken. Fast service yes, pricey, yes. will I eat here again probably just want order chicken."}
{"text":"Not a great place to eat. The food lacks flavor. I got the chicken and shrimp combo. The shrimp and chicken were good. Carrots were over cooked and too sweet, rice was sticky, and cabbage was bland. Egg roll was basic. Surprisingly they have a long line at lunch time. The prices are good. They are clean and you get your food soon. There is plenty of seating and parking. The staff are friendly. They are in a strip mall with other places you can try. Keep your options open. Good luck!"}
{"text":"I love love their shrimp sauce. You can put that on everything. I don't want my entire review about the shrimp sauce, but it is delicious. 

The portion sizes for the rice and noodles are huge. Enough for two servings. Their location is prime because of the other stores in the strip, plus they have outside seating w/ coverings. So during the Spring and Summer, it's really nice to sit outside. 

Again, the shrimp sauce is good on everything."}
{"text":"Fast, good, reasonably priced. Been here several times. Be careful placing large orders because a couple of times they have been screwed up. But the food has still been really good."}
{"text":"I forgot something very important today. Checking on Yelp before going in here.
Since I had not had Asian food for a while, the word \"Hibachi\" caught my eyes and I went right in. I ordered Hibachi Salmon, and watched the cook cooking my salmon (which did not look like salmon at all by the way) on the iron plate, and I was regretting that I ordered it. They were very thin slices of whitish color fish pieces and did not have any orange or pink color even before it was cooked. Although I was brave enough to try it but it came back right out of my mouth. Yikes! If I were Gordon Ramsey, I would say, \"Are you trying to kill me????\" I'm sure.
I really should have read Yelp reviews first. I usually do that, but today, I only had 10 minutes for this quick bite, and omitted my usual routine. Look, Yelp is getting more and more useful and strong. I am glad I'm one of them to help guide people to better restaurants and shops.

But thanks to this non edible salmon lunch, I can eat full dinner tonight without worrying about gaining weight. Thanks."}
{"text":"Give this place a shot! I'm never disappointed by the hibachi chicken with steamed white rice. They are super fast and the meal is tasty and the price is reasonable. What more could you want for a fast lunch??"}
{"text":"This was my first time to hibachi express & grill and I couldn't have loved it more. We started with the Crab Rangoon dip & each got a miso soup. The crab Rangoon was delicious & they gave you a great amount for being an appetizer. Miso soup is one of my favorites and this one did not disappoint. My husband ordered the chicken & shrimp hibachi and I got the vegetarian soba noodles. My husbands meal smelled incredible & he said it tasted even better, his shrimp were huge & it was full of chicken and lots of veggies. My entree was also incredible, I always enjoy when there are vegetarian options since I'm not a huge meat eater. We both were stuffed and still had enough food leftover to take home for lunch the next day! We will definitely be returning soon!"}
{"text":"Not good at all. The only reason I am not giving this 1 star is because I didn't get ill from food poisoning. I debated writing a review at all because I don't want to hurt anyone's business. However, this is a case where the food was so bad it could potentially cause people to get sick. 

I ordered the salmon teriyaki. The \"salmon\" did not even look like salmon. It was white.  The fish also smelled stinky like it was sitting around for days. 

The manager at one point came over and asked me how was my meal; and if you ask, I'm going to be honest. I told him the fish was not fresh. He then went on to explain that he just cooked it fresh on the grill. I replied by saying the fish tasted and smelled like it was sitting around for days before he cooked it. Then he explained to me that fish was expensive and that they had to buy it frozen and could not buy fresh fish. I disengaged at this point and he walked away not offering me a refund. I tossed the fish and just ate the white rice. 

My message to the restaurant is if you don't want to serve fresh fish, then don't offer it on the menu."}
{"text":"I have to echo others opinion that the mixed veggie portion they give you is super small (like two pieces of broccoli and carrots that clearly have a glaze on them defeating the purpose of healthy veggies). I definitely was left with a lot of white on my plate.Yes, they give you a lot of rice, noodles, and chicken. 

The noodles were pretty mushy and the fried rice lacked any veggies or egg...overall the food was flavorless on its own.  I did like the shrimp sauce but I didn't want to dowse my food in it. I did notice (too late) that people made special requests for extra broccoli or what not, which I wish I did too.

The health rating was also a 91.4 ....so I most likely will not be giving this place a second chance even though it's super close to my office. bummer."}
{"text":"Worst food ever! I was warned it was terrible, but I was forced to try it cause it was the last place open within walking distance of my hotel, and it is terrible.  One of my colleagues got sick from his left over seafood for about a week from this place. The chicken tastes like it's been cooked, then frozen, and cooked again (in front of you on the hibachi no less). The fried rice even tastes strange, definitely not fresh, and I can't quite figure out what it is about the taste. The veg, is a mess, scared to try it. Overall, stay away!"}
{"text":"This place is decent. Nothing overly amazing. It's like subpar basic mall hibachi . I ordered the hibachi combo. They give you mainly rice, with a cabbage vegetable medley, protein of your choice and a side of strip sauce. It also came with like a candied carrot that I'm not a big fan of, i would have opted for more cabbage if I knew. The staff was nice, service was quick, someone even brought my food to me once it was done. Nothing bad to say, good for a quick bite."}
{"text":"It was convenient to a conference I was attending, so we walked over. It wasn't crowded upon arrival, but business boomed while we were ordering/picking up food.  Because of this, my order was taken incorrectly and I received the wrong plate to-go when I clearly told the cashier I was dining in. The food was decent, although I'd have loved to have gotten the fried rice I wanted instead of plain white rice.  There was a lady working who yelled at the customers to move down and to hurry up. Very rude. With other options within walking distance of this restaurant (in the same strip mall), you best believe I won't be returning here, no matter how tasty the cabbage was. Cabbage and carrots earned 2 stars...nothing else about this experience did."}
{"text":"It's unfortunate that this area doesn't have a yummy Japanese takeout for the huge business crowd during lunch hours. 

Hibachi Express will most likely last because sometimes you have that craving and you rather just stomach the dry chicken, steak, or seafood because you can drown it in white/shrimp sauce right? I rather not have to load up my meal with containers of sauce but there is no where else to go on a 30minute break. 

I'm giving 2 stars because they are quick and efficient in their services, the food is just not something you salivate over. I wish they served the sweet carrots, but instead you will get a heaping portion of bland cabbage and mixed veggies. There are other options on the menu if you aren't craving Hibachi , I'm just not willing to try another menu option and be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great spot for a quick lunch. Close to a lot of businesses and easy to get in and out. Soba noodles is their best deal for portions as well as quality.  Some of the chicken can be dry but that's an easy fix by dumping a bunch of shiracha and shrimp sauce on it. The owner is very friendly and enthusiastic!"}
{"text":"Worst hibachi food i have ever had. The only thing that tasted decent was the cabbage. Nobody else was in the restaurant and all the workers were on their cell phones. It took 15 minutes with them standing right in front of us on their cell phones and telling us to wait before anyone took our order. Another worker was outside on the store phone outside and he took our order when he came inside. We had to serve ourselves because they left our food sitting on the counter and didn't even say it was ready. My daughter ordered chicken and steak hibachi. Her chicken wasn't cooked properly and was still pink inside. I will never come here again or recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Love this place! Very convenient and delicious. Great place to swing by for a lunch at work or dinner on the way home."}
{"text":"Got take-out here & it was great. Plenty of food and cooked to perfection. It was quick and convenient for us to take back to our hotel boom. We got the hibachi chicken with noodles and added on fried rice. Along with the shrimp sauce. Yummy!"}
