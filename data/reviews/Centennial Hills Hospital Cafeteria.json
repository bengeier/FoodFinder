{"text":"Currently in 2nd floor third day here. I have barely slept. 3 days later I get Eddie a CNA who brought me coffee. \" the only cna who brought me a coffee I asked for. I'm very happy now and  He's great I can  stay awake and take care of my son. Great nursing staff and our doctor/midwife was amazing as well"}
{"text":"I have been a patient and visitor in this hospital. 
As a patient the food was surprisingly good. A lot of choices, salad, cold sandwiches, full hot meals, deserts, fresh fruit... The food is delivered by a friendly, well dressed staff of people that seem genuinely happy to just be alive. It was nice to experience a smile with every tray that was delivered. 
As a visitor I found the cafeteria to be pleasant. It is very clean and had hot food as well as vending machine choices. The coffee used to be free but is now 81 cents for a small cup. Salad bar, hot pizza, full meal choices are all competitively priced. 
The star is lost because the frozen yogurt machine has been been broken on and off for a few years and it happens to be one of my comfort foods."}
{"text":"My first time at this hospital was great  the nurses were nice  always made sure i was okay and took very good care of me I recommend this hospital and the food was amazing"}
{"text":"It's there when you need it! What else can I say? LOL. I stopped in during off hours while the cafe was closed and they had some pre-made Sandwiches and salads out. I was thankful to have them although I thought it was strange that all flavors of pre-made salad were spicy."}
{"text":"OK, I see you hospital cafeteria. I see you and I respect you.

This is inside a hospital so nobody expects anything and I feel like it's just a weird atmosphere for obvious reasons, but the employees are still happy and upbeat and the food is pretty good!

I had a tasty meatloaf supper with squash and mashed potatoes and a nice, cold cup of water.

What can I say, I really enjoyed it. Thanks!"}
{"text":"While its a very small cafeteria (almost a cafe), the food here is excellent.  Recently had 10 meals here due to a friend in the hospital.  The staff is friendly, and its never too crowded.  Food has good variety (they change the menu every day), but given its size, its usually a limited selection.  BEST FOOD IN A HOSPITAL CAFETERIA I have ever been to!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best food for a hospital cafeteria one could ask for. It is very clean and they have a cook that will make it to your liking."}
{"text":"I work in the medical field and once a week on Wednesdays I work at the medical building attached to Centennial Hills Hospital... So, almost every Wednesday I am able to get breakfast before cases start with the doctors who I work for.

I like because:

1- It's a convenient walk through a hallway connecting our building with the hospital & cafeteria.

2- We get a discount off the already inexpensive food that they offer.

3- I don't frequent hospital cafeterias often, but I think that their food is relatively good, particularly their breakfast.....which includes the following:  Buffet-style BISCUITS & GRAVY (my personal favorite item on their morning menu), HASH BROWNS, BACON, SAUSAGE, FRENCH TOAST, & SCRAMBLED EGGS, along with eggs made to order.

4- Service is nice...(you can usually see the same little, older lady at the cash register).  Just this morning, the guy who checked me out said, \"We have a policy here at the cafe... We expect everyone who comes through to SMILE.\"  =)


Oh, and FREE COFFEE all day...complete with a selection of creamers and sweeteners!"}
