{"text":"We weren't smoking shisha, so this review is just for the food. The atmosphere is nice and the service was great. We ordered a lot of food! Two of their smoothies, which were huge, fresh and I would highly recommend. The Briyani was also delicious. The lentil soup was good and easily a meal on its own with a side of bread. The fried, flaky bread they serve is AMAZING. The review loses a star because the chicken on naan my husband ordered was just ok and I wasn't wild about the dessert (some kind of soft cheese in sweetened cream). Overall, a very good experience. I would certainly recommend the food to friends and will likely return."}
{"text":"the place is not bad.. it actually has a nice environment and great place to chill, however not a place to eat. food is not thier forte!! i have had bangali food, and that wasnt any authentic bangali food nor delicious.. also ordered the daal which was very salty.. great place to chill, the sheesha was great, also the drinks were great, had the mango lassi and lemon mint drink. will def go back just to chill and drink but not to eat."}
{"text":"Loved their service! Food was great and amazing different varieties of shakes. Also try their double apple shisha. I will definitely recommend this place to all my friends."}
{"text":"I had a really great time at House of Bengal. The food and shisha were both really good. The staff was very nice and did a great job making sure were we well taken care of. A friend of mine said the Mango Lassi was very flavourful and refreshing. I would recommend this place to anyone interested."}
{"text":"I'm very happy to say that this is going to be my regular shisha spot. They're extremely friendly, great service and their variety of shishas including their cold shisha and fruit head shisha; I was very pleased. Their food is also quite good: savoury and delicious with a twist on their dishes including their drinks and desserts. The shishas are priced well and they last quite long. I can't wait to go there again!"}
{"text":"First time here and was a good experience.  Great smoothies, excellent selection of hookah flavors and excellent service. This is a great place to relax and unwind alone or come and enjoy an evening with friends."}
