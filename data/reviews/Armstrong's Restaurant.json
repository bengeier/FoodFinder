{"text":"Nice place for casual Italian. Food is always good and they give you massive portions. All the staff have always been really friendly and quick with service."}
{"text":"We come here often and usually have no complaints, but the food seems to have gone downhill lately.  Stopped by last week on a Thursday and ordered Fettuccine Alfredo with a side of meatballs.  Pasta was mushy and the Alfredo sauce had absolutely no flavor.  Meatballs came out lukewarm and were so salty I couldn't eat them.  Maybe I should stick with the hot turkey sandwich!"}
{"text":"Nice restaurant in a small strip mall. They have a good selection of dishes, mostly american and Italian foods. The portions are huge, so it's a good idea to share. Their salads were very fresh and loaded with toppings. The stuffed banana pepper appetizer was phenomenal, as was the extremely cheesy pizza bread. I would definitely go back if I lived in the area."}
{"text":"Being from NY where Italian food reigns, I guess I was just expecting a bit more authenticity. I had the eggplant parm platter.  Lots of food with side dishes, but nothing worth a second trip.  Eggplant was fried hockey pucks. Pretty hard to grasp that this was the eggplant parm that I was used to.  Like I said earlier, not worth a second trip here."}
{"text":"I thought the food was great, our waitress was good - but as we left another employee was extremely rude to us, apparently he wasn't pleased with us bringing in little kids.  Spoke with management this morning, and they were appalled and apologized, and said they would talk to that employee."}
{"text":"Say 2.5 stars. There's an equal amount of plus's and minus's. To start - there isn't one healthy item on the menu and it's not vegetarian friendly.  Basic menu with nothing creative at all. Very yummy baked ziti and manicotti. Clean place. Big portions. Family place."}
{"text":"People have been telling how wonderful this place is..  I'm wondering what they are smokin..  If you're going for dinner somewhere..  I suggest anywhere but here.  If you're looking for mediocre food with poor service, you hit the jackpot with this place."}
{"text":"Huge portions, good service and a family friendly atmosphere. The extensive menu has something for just about anyone. They take \"reservations\" but when I arrived, I was informed that my reservation was actually just a \"Call ahead\" and we waited an additional 15 minutes to be seated."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with family.  All four of us got something different and it was all fantastic.  Large portions. Will definetly be going back."}
{"text":"Everyone kept telling me, YOU HAVE TO TRY ARMTRONGS. I'm beginning to wonder if I'm just unlucky or local people here have no taste buds.   For those who haven't been, Armstrong's in a mainstay in Coraopolis, tucked away in a strip mall at Thorn Run and Beaver Grade roads. It's basically a family restaurant that, if not for a view of the kitchen and a missing fire place, would almost have an \"inn-like\" feel to it with the stone walls.   On a huge menu with many American and Italian dish, I ordered the veal parmagian, which came with the choice of soup/salad and pasta/potato for $18.95. I opted for the Italian Wedding soup as my introductory offerings.   Armstrongs hits a home run with their soup. It was a very large bowl, which was a pleasant surprise, but the taste was outstanding and might be the best I've ever had. It was loaded with white meat chicken, small meatballs, pasta, escarole, and a delicious broth. Coming from a very Italian area outside Providence, RI, I was literally in shock.   Unfortunately, it went down hill from there. I soooo wanted to give this a 4/5 star rating. My food came out fast -- almost too fast. The portion size was enormous. However, food is clearly about quality not quantity. The veal and breading (while crisp) were both unseasoned. Note I didn't say under seasoned, I said unseasoned. The type that would make Robert Irvine throw the dish on the floor. It was completely tasteless and an absolute travesty to the poor calf that died for this meal.  Next I tackled the portion that had sauce and cheese, hoping for a save. Their sauce is an insult to every Italian grandmother in the world. This watery red mess had NO seasoning whatsoever (which should be evident by bits of color from basil, oregano, etc...) It tasted like a mass produced variant of Chef Boyardee's sauce. Gross.   The same sauce was drenched all over my linguine, so you know how I feel there.   The service was great and soup was excellent, so hopefully I'll give it another try for scrod, open faced roast beef, or something else. For now, I recommend you try another Coraoplis local for Italian offerings."}
{"text":"Armstrongs is one of my favorite places for spaghetti (with meat sauce of course). For about $10, you get soup/salad, Mancini bread (yum), and a large portion. And that is for the half order of pasta. I always end up taking half of my food home. Always have loved Armstrongs."}
{"text":"I have traveled far and wide through these United States and love Italian food even though I am of German and Irish decent! I can only say that the Chicken Parmesan is the very best I have eaten ever. So much so that I actually dreamed about it last night, woke up craving it and am going back tonight for seconds. Well prepared and most excellent! Thank you for such fine food and friendly staff."}
{"text":"I am Italian. I know good sauce. This place has it. This is the ONE and only Italian restaurant I've been to in Pittsburgh that serves food like I ate growing up with Italian cooks. Born in Italy. The penne pasta with vodka sauce is to die for. The servings are gigantic too, very generous!  And the desserts are delicious. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I am late to the Armstrong's bandwagon.  I can kick myself for not coming here more often.    It's kind of mind-blowing to me how they stay in business considering the portion sizes they serve and the prices they charge.  But whatever, as a customer it suits me just fine.  The restaurant is BYOB with no corkage fee.  None.  Awesome.    Penne A La Vodka ($13.95) is excellent and a totally craveable dish.  It's perfectly cooked penne in a pink tomato basil and vodka cream sauce.  This is easily an entree that can feed two adults.  This seems like a pricing mistake and a portion control mistake.  But it's in my favor!  Saturday is Prime Rib Night at Armstrong's.  The queen size cut ($18.00) is perfect for one very hungry adult.  The king size cut is completely unfathomable for me - but they were still leaving the kitchen no doubt to feed a family of 4.  The prime rib is well marbled, moist and seasoned well.  I got to choose two side dishes.  I went with the Italian wedding soup (perfect) and the baked potato.   Just a great meal altogether.  And with the lovely L'Ecole 41 red wine I brought from home, it went perfectly with the pasta and the prime rib.  Again, no corkage fee, so I won all around on this one.  On a different visit, we ordered two desserts.  One was split between our party of 6 and the other was ordered to go.  The chocolate banana pie was excellent and the pudding tasted homemade.  Crust was thin and flaky and just great.  The coconut cream pie was enjoyed later at home and it was incredible.  There was an enormous meringue on top of it which was impressive and the coconut creme was just right in the middle between bland and way too sweet.  Pretty great desserts on both counts.  There you have it.  Be sure to get there early on the weekends or be prepared for a 20-30 minute wait."}
{"text":"Ordered chicken and an eggplant parmigiana sandwich for take out. Can't wait to take time to eat in the restaurant as well. Sandwiches were truly excellent, great tasting all the way around. It's been years since I've been to Armstrongs and it's only because I don't think about the place since I don't really head in that direction too much. Will certainly go back and would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"make sure you specify exactly what you want because the servers that do not pay attention to you will for sure bring you out the wrong stuff....  if you dont want a bowl of weeds as a salad ASK FOR THE ICEBERG lol the wedding soup....save your money..go home.....pull some more weeds....mix it up with some chicken broth and eat.  the spaghetti noodles..are over cooked and the portions are huge which would have been nice to know so my wife and i wouldnt have got so much.. the fried ravioli is good tho"}
{"text":"Have always loved this place but waiting an hour while people that phone ahead get right in is bs. Lobby at capacity at dinner rush and it's annoying as heck."}
{"text":"First time visitor. Good food and service. The stuffed mushroom caps were great. My wife has the veal parmigiana and the serving size was enormous. The beef barley soup was excellent. My only suggestion would be to offer sugar free desserts."}
{"text":"Service was quick. Wait staff was pleasant and attentive. The place was clean. The price is affordable.  At the price range it serves, this place meets or exceeds all expectations."}
{"text":"I've been going to Armstrong's for years. They are reliable, consistent and serve great tasting food with large portions at a reasonable price.  The answer is: the Italian Calzone."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  Love, love, love the Vodka Sauce.  The portions are HUGE so you will def have left overs for the next day.  It's BYOB, so make sure you stop and grab a couple bottles of wine on the way!"}
{"text":"I had the chicken Romano. It was great and tasted very fresh.  The restaurant itself (I'm imagining is a family diner) but has a fancier atmosphere.  Even midday on a Monday there are plenty of people here."}
{"text":"We had a false start here, but it was well taken care of and we ended up having one of the best meals here. Penne ala vodka was great as was pasta putenesca- really both world class-huge portions and perfectly prepared. The desserts here are worth their own drive-mile high pies -home made, great crusts and the raspberry cream is just out of this world."}
{"text":"I love this place, I eat there at least once every time I visit Pittsburgh. Best calzone in town and they have something called chicken romano I think and it's delicious.  Portions are huge. But I don't think they have a liquor license."}
{"text":"this is the only place I have found that has really  good Italian sausage. I'm here again for it."}
{"text":"I love this place!  Must visit if you are in the area. Great portions. I use to work nearby and visited frequently. I am back in town after many years and it's still just as good. Going back today for my last meal before leaving town."}
{"text":"This is a good family restaurant that featured tried and proven dishes that are more for comfort than foodies.  Just a business traveler want after several days of either fast foods or business dinners.  The breaded scrod (a white fish) was very buttered, lighted browned, and with just the right crust.  Cole slaw was watery and sweet.  Mesh potato and gravy was excellent, but also artery clogging.  I will definitely come here again, probably once a year if I live here."}
{"text":"I don't know where some of these prior ratings are coming from?? This is a locally owned business that my family and I go to quite often. We have NEVER gotten anything other than the highest quality food and the quantity is HUGE. We have tried many entrees on their menu and have never ever been disapointed. The service has always been prompt and courteous. We really enjoy this restaurant and highly recomend it. You will not be disapointed. Excellent Great Tasting Food and Great Service. Treat yourself and your family and put this place on your list---I guarantee you will go back for more."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Armstrong's.  I recommend: the steak hoagie, steak salad, Cajun chicken lunch special, turkey devonshire etc. I  TOTALLY recommend their Cajun style wings.  They have the best!!!    I know what you are thinking... Armstrongs? Wings?  Oh yes my friend.  They have the best Cajun wings I have ever had.  Make sure you ask for well done or crispy.   Prices a little steep for some items but its worth it."}
{"text":"I have never been disappointed at Armstrong's.  I spend a little bit more money than I would like for lunch, but the portions are large and I usually get at least one more meal out of it, so it is justifiable.  They usually have at Wedding Soup and at least one or two other homemade soups.  They serve fresh bread with your meal and the menu has something for everyone.  This time, I ordered the lunch manicotti which came with soup or a salad.  The manicotti is homemade and really good.  Much better than the frozen stuff you get other places.  Cauliflower Cheese soup was on the menu for the day, so I tried that and was not disappointed.  My co-worker ordered a chicken sandwich and it was HUGE.  She was very happy with it and said that the chicken was tender and flavorful.  I would definately recommend giving this place a try!"}
{"text":"I tried Armstrong's for lunch with a large group.  We arrived at 1115 on a Wednesday and was seated immediately.  I ordered the lunch baked ziti and it came with a soup or salad, I got the salad.  10m later the food arrived and no one complained of the portion or taste. I was unable to eat all of the lunch portion and was told the dinner portion comes in a bowl.   Very good."}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite restaurant growing up. When I came home for the holidays, I was disappointed to discover a menu full of upcharges. Over half of the available sides were only available with a $2 upcharge, including a side salad. Pasta is available as a side, but if you ask for baked ziti instead of ziti, there is a $2 upcharge (not listed on the menu) for the cheese they add on top. I disagree with misleading prices on the menu, while \"nickel and dime\"ing the consumer on the backend. I will not be back until this changes, which is unfortunate."}
{"text":"I rarely leave reviews, however, the food was delicious! I ordered a side of meatballs and cheese as well as mashed potatoes with chicken gravy. The meatballs were light and almost fluffy with great taste and the sauce had a nice depth of flavor with job at the right amount of melted cheese on top. The mashed potatoes were creamy with a not too salty but homestyle chicken gravy that reminded me of something my grandma would make. The service was on point as well. I would absolutely recommend this place to anyone looking for somewhere to grab a bite to eat! Oh and yes it sounds like a strange meal but I can only eat soft food and this was beyond perfect for someone on a food restriction!"}
{"text":"In a nutshell: typical American Italian restaurant serving up huge portions.   When I think of American Italian, Armstrong's comes to mind. There's nothing fancy about the restaurant but you can tell the folks that dine here aren't here for that. The diners seem to be regulars because the wait staff seem to know everyone and treat them as if they're family. At first look at the menu, most entrees are between $10-$20 but you're basically getting 2-3 meals out of it, so it turns out to be a great deal. The food is simple and it tastes decent, nothing to really complain about. But it's also nothing to rave about. If you're in the area and looking to stay away from chain restaurants, this is a good place to try. And come hungry."}
{"text":"Good American (burgers, chicken, wings, grinders) and Italian (pasta, calzons) options. Very large portions -- even the salads and cups of soup are huge. This place is impossible to leave hungry and without take-home. Service was good. Prices are high but they give you a ton of food. Interesting, no pizza. Worth visiting"}
{"text":"Consistently great tasting food, large portions and reasonably priced.  Doesn't get much better than that!"}
{"text":"Great waitress who was attentive and detail oriented. She made sure our entree order was placed before two 8 top tables submitted their tickets. Unfortunately the food was bland and the pasta mushy."}
{"text":"Very good baked ziti, other food is ok. Prices are a bit high for the quality of the food. Service was good, nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"It is a bit pricey but absolutely worth it.  The portions are huge and I have always gotten something that I enjoyed.  The steak salad and calzones are especially delicious."}
{"text":"Was here yesterday for our Cousins Luncheon.    As our food was very good and the portions generous.  I had their Italian Hoagie with Fries and side order of Fried Zucchini.   Needless to say I took half of my sandwich home for later.  Will be back again another time soon."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful food in my opinion.  There vodka sauce is amazing!... And surprisingly for an Italian restaurant they have great wings!"}
{"text":"We try to stop at Armstrong's any time we are in town visiting family. Classic western PA fare from wedding soup to steak salad to chicken parm to calzones to pasta dishes. Huge portions. Tastes better when wearing Steelers/Pens/Pirates gear."}
{"text":"This place didn't blow me away, but it was very good.  I had a steak salad.  The steak was very tender and tasty.  It had fries on it (thank goodness) which made it a \"Pittsburgh salad.\"  Nice atmosphere.  The staff / service were friendly and attentive.  This is a solid place for lunch."}
{"text":"We are never disappointed when we visit Armstrong's. Plan on splitting your dinner or taking some home. Try the fettuccine alfredo or the penne alla vodka if ure looking for pasta or the Italian calzone. Yum! Great for fams with kids. Plan on waiting on the weekend."}
{"text":"Know that that their portions have always been huge, my husband and I decided to share the veal parm.  But he decided he wanted it to have alfredo sauce on the veal & pasta.  The upcharge was $4 which I thought was a bit pricey.  In fact, after looking over their menu, most items seem overpriced for what this restaurant is.  Its nothing fancy.  Dinner was ok; I personally didn't think the alfredo was anything spectacular.  Wedding soup was good."}
{"text":"Great restaurant- have enjoyed it since I was a kid. The steak salad is great. Also the Roast beef sandwich, chicken parm sandwich, and stuffed banana peppers. Only thing that isn't great nowt hat I'm not a kid eating there is that they don't have a bar, so you're enjoying your delicious dinner with Sprite instead of Chardonnay."}
{"text":"I am a native of the area, it's probably been about 22 years since I was here last, and I remember why. I ordered my beverage, and the waitress had brought the glass and set it down on the table holding the top rim of the glass, which after working in restaurants for 11 years wouldn't have done on my first day.    Ordered the Italian hoagie, and I requested no onions, but to substitute banana peppers instead,  and there's an additional fee for a veggie substitution. Really.   Received our food, my hoagie was a sad excuse for a hoagie. There was more lettuce than meat on the bun, and the fine Italian meats were bland. The cheap cuts at Giant Eagle has more flavor. They try ed to cover the small size of the sandwich by putting a mountain of fries on the plate.  I had seen much nicer, larger, meater sandwiches from Subway for $6.00!  The Ranch dressing must be stretched, as it's almost as runny as milk.   The locals that come here must never experience \"fine dining\" or really good food. If you're looking for good food I would suggest looking elsewhere... possibly Mario's or ordering delivery pizza.  I would prefer McDonald's more.  My lunch mate ordered a buffalo chicken sandwich, it looked fried past the point it needs and looked as if it was a pre frozen chicken filet prebreaded in Buffalo chicken crumbs.  And what restaurant doesn't have a coffee pot to refill coffee cups."}
{"text":"Come hungry. Some portions can feed 3 people I'm sure. I had buffalo chicken salad there twice and it was amazing."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Armstrong's since 1991. It is an institution. Consistently good. Whether take out or eat in. Even the remodel 15 or so years ago not much has changed.  Wifey got her always standard chicken parm sandwich. I mix it up because there are so many great choices. This time I got the roasted artichoke hearts for appetizer. Tender and flavorful. Followed up with a steak salad. Once again consistently good.  Drink glass rarely goes below half full before it's topped off. Desserts also great. Although if you can get through your ample dinner. Finishing a huge dessert would be a super hero event."}
{"text":"This restaurant is very good.   On the plus side, the portions are huge, the food is fresh and tasty, and the menu is pretty broad (Italian food, sandwiches, steaks, etc.).   The setting is a mix of new and old. The booths and tables are very dated looking. The stacked -stone wall in the dining area looks freshly renovated.   Service is quick but a bit abrupt, as if all the servers assume you've been here a dozen times and know their drill. They are in a hurry and don't linger to second extra for you to swallow and ask for more water.   So it's an old-school experience. I prefer their Italian food, especially if you can figure out which dishes are made with their house-made pasta, which is excellent."}
{"text":"We had lunch with friends. The waitress was very friendly and attentive. Food took some time but was really good. There were many people from the offices in the neighborhood ordering for take out. It is the typical family type of a restaurant. Portions had a good size. We liked the place."}
{"text":"Great food! Chef doing a great Job! Not over or under cooked Everything is perfect!!! Please work on your interior  It looks old and and not in the Best shape Bring some light in to this place"}
{"text":"Armstrong's is the place everyone used to go.  They are generally crowded around lunchtime.  The prices are really reasonable and the portions are gigantic.  But there are lots of other choices available, and the food is just average quality.  The sandwiches are very popular here.  The staff is very attentive.  There is often a wait to get seated at peak dining hours."}
{"text":"First the cons: My wife ordered the chicken parmigiana with fries and the wedding soup.  The food was nothing special.  She ordered the lunch special and it came with two chicken breasts instead of just one, so pretty good bang for the buck.  Just not that tasty.  And we had to pay an extra $2 for the soup.    Also, the restaurant was very hot.  We were sat just outside the kitchen, so I'm not sure how it feels if you are sitting further away from the kitchen.  Pros:  The waitress was very attentive.    I ordered the chicken and spinach salad and it was delicious and satisfying.    The price was very reasonable.  After taxes and tip, it was less than $35 (we did not get drinks).  The booth seats were comfortable.  And the restaurant seemed pretty clean.  Unfortunately we probably won't be going back since my wife's meal was not that great and it was so hot inside."}
{"text":"Place looks very clean and nice.  No problems on service.  Got a burger and a calzone though and while the burger was normal, the calzone was huge.   While this usually is a good thing......the entire calzone was filled to the brim with ricotta cheese (very potent and pungent).  I'm not sure who could stomach eating the sheer amount of ricotta stuffed in these, I took two bites and felt nauseous."}
{"text":"I'm giving this restaurant a terrible review because the manager confronted us and was extremely rude. I ordered pick up and decided I wanted to sit down and have ice tea and a nice dessert. He immediately came over and told me this should never have happened and implicated I would not give a tip. He did this in front of everyone in the restaurant. Thank God our server Shawna was sweet or else I would've zero stars if I could  If you want to have lunch and be treated like crap I suggest you come to Armstrongs"}
{"text":"Order the chicken parm with the two sides both pasta and you got two meals! The portion size is huge, but for $16 I'm not complaining. This place is so good I took my family here when they came to visit and they've taken me there ever since. The only thing I didn't care for was that you have to bring your own beer or wine, I just wish I could order it there however now I know. This is honestly one of the freshest, most delicious chicken parms I've ever had and I've had a lot of Italian food from all over the country. This place isn't classified as an Italian place but it could've fooled me for sure! The Cajun grilled chicken sandwich is bomb as well, I can see why this place is known so well by locals I look forward to getting my chicken parm there soon!"}
{"text":"I tried the buffalo chicken sandwich, which was good. A little overpriced for a pretty basic sandwich....but still good. Fries weren't fresh cut or anything. Overall, a little disappointed!"}
{"text":"It's hard to find an Italian restaurant that can compare to homemade cooking but Armstrong's comes pretty close. They are easily the best Italian food in the area. Their pasta dishes are huge and delicious and they have my favorite wedding soup from any restaurant. They also have really great sandwiches, salads and other non-Italian dishes."}
{"text":"A pretty average strip mall restaurant. The food is good but nothing special and the portions are really big. I had a buffalo chicken sandwich and was pretty satisfied with it. I was starving when I came in and was so full when I left."}
{"text":"food is good at fair prices. entree dinner salads should be considered. only complaint was the hoagie was warm. in philadelphia, hoagies are cold cuts."}
{"text":"Stopped back in for Fish Friday :-) -   Beer Batter Fish, Mac&Cheese -  Awesome - Fish was cooked perfectly.    The Mac&Cheese was yummy as well (noodles were dense, cheese did not taste like it was issued by the government or from a powdered form).  I topped it off with a Raspberry and Crème slice of pie.      All was very good - now I need a nap :-)"}
{"text":"I have given this place several tries. I can't complain about the quality of the food, it really is very good, but if you're looking for fast, courteous service,  skip this place.  Everytime I have been here,  the servers have forgotten major parts of our order. Today, she forgot to put our order in entirely. Our server was no where to be found. I asked for the manager and when the server finally reappeared,  she reeked of cigarette smoke. There were no apologies offered and the manager never came back to follow up.  Food is good, but not worth the aggrevation that accompanies getting it."}
{"text":"Honestly, the food here is tasty. I've had the open faced roast beef sandwich and a variety of the Italian dishes. Seating is fairly quick, and service is good.   However, every single time I've eaten here, I haven't felt well afterward. I haven't eaten anything that I wouldn't get anywhere else, so I don't think it's my choice of food."}
{"text":"I recently moved to the area and missed the little Italian place by my old house.  A friend recommended Armstrong's and I am SO glad she did!!  Everything that I have had so far has been delicious!  Portions are HUGE and the price is perfect.  I get take out at least twice a week!  Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Pretty much anything you get here is good. Wedding soup is good as is the English Scrod. Vodka Penne is also very good.  Pumpkin Cheesecake was amazing. Stuffed mushrooms with crab was just ok. Good place to grab a better than decent meal."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch during the work week a couple months ago and was pleasantly surprised. They have a huge menu with tons of choices. The prices are extremely reasonable and the portions are huge. I went with a huge group and we all had separate checks. The staff was on point and did an excellent job.   We started with bread and butter for the table and then almost all entrees came with a side or a salad. My co-workers ordered salads, soup, cole slaw, pasta dishes, parm sandwiches and fish and no one was disappointed. My friend and I shared pasta dishes - baked ziti and sausage casserole. Italian food can be tricky but I think that they nailed it. This was not gloppy and the sauce was not tasteless.   Now I haven't been there for dinner so I'm not sure what their prices are like but if their dinner is anything like their lunch, you should definitely try this place out."}
{"text":"Holy moly, this place is so delicious! Homemade, big portions. Had the Italian calzone, and I kid you not, it's as big as my face!! Lol"}
{"text":"I tried different pasta dishes from here and was disappointed. It lacked the flavor you expect from italian cuisine, it was so bland. However the scrod dishes they have here are really good, that is the only thing I order from this restaurant.   The service is good, the waiters/waitresses are pleasant and helpful."}
{"text":"Great place. Huge portions, good service, and a great take-out process. It's BYOB but other than that, it's a wonderful family oriented atmosphere."}
{"text":"Always a family favorite and has been since the original location was on Mt Washington. Some of my favorites are their chicken salads( by far one of the best I've ever had ), chicken parmesan, baked and stuffed scrod, crab stuffed shrimp and the meatloaf which is a special only on Wed or Thursdays. The desserts are all homemade and the coconut cream and assorted  cheesecakes are some of the best. I look forward to their pumpkin cheesecake available from October to December as it's one of the best I've ever had. I craved it so bad that I made a habit of just stopping in to get a slice to go almost weekly. OCTOBER can't come soon enough haha."}
{"text":"Was at RMU for our sons Lacrosse tournament and yelp reviews steered us toward this place. Everything we had was quite tasty from the wedding and beef barley soups to our main dishes of Lasagna and Chicken Romano. Ordered buffalo chicken tenders as well since I must try every new places buffalo sauce..;) They were excellent!  Would eat here again for sure"}
{"text":"Great food, great staff, great prices! I would recommend this place to anyone. I'm giving it a four because last time the buffalo chicken  calzone was a huge grease ball ended up taking it home And throwing it away."}
{"text":"Great little Italian family restaurant! The stuffed peppers and artichoke hearts were absolutely delicious appetizers. The Salmon was delicious and a very large and generous size piece of fish with a nice side of fresh penne. Someone else ordered stuffed eggplant parm and it looked incredible... the BYOB aspect is very nice on top of everything. I would definitely come back here for a meal. Come hungry!! It truly is family style size portions for everything."}
{"text":"Huge portion of all your favorite comfort foods. Quality is average but the value is good."}
{"text":"Excellent food, HUMONGOUS portions for a very reasonable price.  No serious complaints.  VERY busy at lunch - expect to wait for a table at peak times."}
{"text":"Came in town for Cubs game. Dinner here the first night. Service was good and the food was amazing. Had the Pittsburg steak salad. Hands down the best one I have had. Only downside is that there is no alcohol served. Would return for that salad next time in town."}
{"text":"Excellent soup !!! Atmosphere is great  and a great decor.  Waiter took great care of me.  Bread basket was fresh and had a hard crust with a chewy texture internally .  Had the classic Cesar salad which was fresh and delicious.  Would definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food and some of the biggest portions of ANY restaurant, period.   In a strip mall type of plaza, near the old PIT airport.  Upscale casual atmosphere, where you would be as comfortable in a t-shirt as a shirt and tie.   The food is outrageously good. The pizza bread is basically a small French bread pizza, we got ours with pepperoni.  Their homemade red sauce is awesome.  The zucchini strips are thin and tasty, and again, huge portions.    Their stuffed eggplant may be the best thing on the menu:  thick slices of eggplant parmesan towered with ricotta between and covered in their marinara.  Amazing.  I couldn't finish half of it. AND it comes with a side of pasta--in a bowl the size of a cereal bowl!  I took that all home.   Pasta dishes were huge and yummy, and the chicken Ramano was a standout, with fluffy egg batter, and three large breast slices per order, plus two sides.   We decided that next time, we would do family style and order maybe 6 dinner for a party of 8, and share them.  We will surely Still take some home!"}
{"text":"The penne vodka may be the best pasta dish I've ever had! It's so good and they give you such a big portion. I always get that. They also have a nice lunch portion. Attractive dining room and great service in my experience. Definitely give it a shot for generous portions at a friendly local place."}
{"text":"First, let me say I've been eating at Armstrong's since the 80's when they had one location on Grove Road in Castle Shannon.  I live in the West Hills now, and I go to the Moon location.  This place is a Pittsburgh Classic.  The food is delicious.  The food is ALWAYS delicious!!  The service is great.  The service is ALWAYS great!!  The catering and take out tastes just like in the restaurant and they give you all the extras - this is ALWAYS the way they do it!!  It's great for date night, it's a great place to take your growing teens/young men because they won't leave hungry!!  I have never thought to write a review for Armstrong's before, but I must say that I cannot understand the reviews that are even 4 stars or below.  This place is the best, you can't beat it!!    What would I recommend?  Anything, everything!!  I've had the wedding soup, the salads, the sandwiches, the eggplant parm (OMG) the chicken parm, the fish, the pasta...  Suffice to say that whatever you get you will love.  Of course, like with any other GOOD restaurant, you will hit a wait if you go during lunch or dinner rush.  So just use some common sense and plan accordingly.  It is worth it!!"}
{"text":"We've gotten food here for 15 years.. I can't say that I've ever had a bad meal. I have to give it 5 stars for the value and quality. Atmosphere is nothing to brag about. I always get the chicken parm and it's in my top 2 or 3 including some high end restaurants. It's cooked perfect, tender, thin, fat removed, etc... I haven't tried many other dishes but I have to say the meatloaf special on Thursdays is delicious"}
{"text":"I am the parent of a performer and we tend to eat out A LOT, mostly in large groups after our kids are done performing or competing.  We have been to MANY restaurants in the Pittsburgh area in the last 5 years with our group and I have to say that ARMSTRONG'S gets a platinum award for treating us THE BEST!!!  They handled our party of 16, which grew to 20 by the time we got there, like seasoned large crowd pros.  I utilized their call ahead seating and when we got there during prime time dinner hour, the manager didn't even wince when I told him we found 4 additional guests along the way!  We were seated within 10 minutes of arriving and from the start our server, John H. was on the ball!  The place is BYOB and there is NO corking fee!!  You do have to open the wine bottles yourself, so buy screw caps if you find that task daunting.  I bet John would have opened the bottle(s) if we asked nicely!!  The food was delicious and served both promptly and correctly.  I must say the service actually made the food taste better!  Please raise your hand if you agree that terrible service can make a gourmet meal taste like you know what!!!  I brought a cake in for a birthday celebration and they delivered it to the table with candles glowing and voices singing.  For a minute I thought the employees knew us personally, that's how great they made us feel!  We also had a perfect ending to our meal when John informed us that he ran individual checks.  WOW, what a novel idea!!!!  All each family had to do was combine their singular checks to pay the bill.  One of my biggest pet peeves in the service industry is the BS that you can't do separate checks for large crowds.  I served for many years, YES you can if you know how not to get in the weeds with your tables and jeopardize the guaranteed 18% tip that allows you to do.  John actually was tipped FAR MORE than 18%.  Yes, he is a smart guy and a great server!!  All of our group will dine at Armstrong's again.  Our experience was a good as it gets!!"}
{"text":"We love going here for some classic pittsburgh italian eats.  Some dishes we love to get are the fried zucchini, wedding soup, and chicken parm, but the menu is extensive and offers many options. They serve very big portions, which make great lunch leftovers the next day.  The servers are very kind and down to earth.  An added bonus is that it is BYOB!  The atmosphere is more casual and relaxed like a nice neighborhood spot where the locals go."}
{"text":"This place is delicious.  I get the stuffed eggplant every time i go.  For about $14, you get a salad or soup, fresh Italian bread a side of pasta and a huge plate of eggplant layered with ricotta cheese, sauce and cheese.  Enough for two or three meals.  The service is wonderful most times, but there are a few slow waitresses."}
{"text":"I work close by so I was happy to find a good place for lunch.  I checked the internet for their menu.  However, discovered there really isn't one.  I did find a menu online and ordered from it.  When I picked up my food, I discovered my meal was $5.00 more than what I expected.  When I asked the cashier about the price discrepancy, she replied with the menu online is very old and they haven't updated it so the prices are all wrong. Sooo, they do not honor those old prices from the internet nor care about the mis-information.  Not a good business decision I think.  Anyway, I do not know how I feel about my lunch today.  There are too many places nearby for me to return to Armstrongs'..  boo"}
{"text":"Home cooking and large portions.  We usually come here with extended family, So 6-8-10-12 people.  We choose Armstrong's since they have a large variety on their menu and most is very good.  The tomato sauce is a bit disappointing  All the dinners come with a salad and the portions are large.  maybe a bit to large, but then again you have enough for lunch the next day.   you can call ahead to put your name on the list and bring your own wine or beer, they do not have a bar"}
{"text":"We came here for my birthday.  I ordered the pasta with vodka sauce and I added chicken.  I will definitely be returning.   Portion was huge and the service was great.  I had 3 more meals after my dinner.  Another cool aspect is that it's byob! This is a huge perk!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this place a three because I used to love it, crave it & come here all the time.  On a recent trip back to the 'burgh, though, I found it...lacking???  The prices have gone waaaay up & although okay, everything we ate was missing something & a bit...bland?  For example, the eggplant parm sandwich had no sauce?  The fish sandwich was just...that???  A piece of fish on a Mancini roll?  I don't know.  Service continues to be phenomenal.  I'll probably give it another go b/c...see first sentence...."}
{"text":"Armstrong's is a solid and reliable restaurant that will give you good food with large portions.   (They basically give you a half a loaf of bread per person... I'm not mad about it)   They have some REALLY good daily soups... Give them a try!   My one and only complaint..... THEY DON'T HAVE AN ACTUAL WEBSITE... like, COME ON, Armstrong's, you have Facebook, now just make a real website so people can actually see your menu.  Therefore, I have taken the time to make a copy of their menu, scan it and upload it for the convenience of all your past and future customers."}
{"text":"Really great spot.  Traveling in the area for a couple of days.  It is a great restaurant, but not much competition in the nearby area.  I had lunch, liked it so much had to come back for dinner!  Had a hot turkey sandwich for lunch, and the sausage and peppers with linguine.    Service was awesome, come hungry."}
{"text":"We come here often, great food, huge portions, reasonable prices and close to the house. Save room for the desserts they are awesome. No spirits,wine or beer but you can bring your own."}
{"text":"Today I took my 3 year old little man to lunch at Armstrong's. I had the BLT and when it arrived it was HUGE, loaded with fresh crisp Bacon and oh so yummy. I had to ask for a \"to go\" container right away. lol We also had the moz sticks, which are large. Little man had the kiddos pasta and meatball. They ended up bringing him two HUGE meatballs. We ended up taking a lot of food to go. It was a great visit, great service, relaxed atmosphere and friendly faces.:0)"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants - I just only gave it 4 stars (rather than 5) b/c they raised their prices a while back and they are not as reasonable. Italian dishes are AWESOME - I love their meatballs, meat sauce, and baked ziti. YUM YUM YUM!!!"}
{"text":"I've been going to Armstrong's pretty much since they opened this location...um...a 'few' years ago. It has never disappointed. Well trained staff coupled with terrific food - who could ask for more? The lunches are terrific and out quick for those of us who who are working and had limited time. Eating later is casual and comfy, and the food? Great salads, soups, pasta...just all around a great place to go with colleagues, friends, dates or family. Wonderful!"}
{"text":"Armstrongs is a local FAVORITE!  I have never had anything short of a fantastic experience.  The atmosphere is kind of like a nicer, cleaner, better diner.  Portions are huge.  Prices are reasonable.  Service is on-point.  Pssst, the restaurant is BYOB and the pies, try them!!"}
{"text":"I went to the Armstrong's in Whitehall a number of years ago, well before I even knew what Yelp was, and back then I found it somewhat underwhelming. After luncheoning here this afternoon, my feelings about the Armstrong's franchise  is about the same.   I recall ordering a burger at the Whitehall franchise and hated how the bread tasted stale and fell apart. My Buffalo Chicken sandwich suffered the same fate. The chicken itself was tender and juicy, however, even if the ranch dressing was a bit watery.   Our Baked Artichoke appetizer was a simple winner. Tangy, oily, madly in love with garlic, we found that the remainder of the sauce for the plump thistle hearts went great with the complimentary bread.   I liked Kay's Penne A La Vodka, but I would have liked to have tasted more of the vodka. Other than that, it was richly creamy, and the penne itself was boiled perfectly al dente.   Two large wedges of their housemade pies came for dessert; Raspberry Creme and Chocolate Mousse. The RC was a basic pudding pie merged with a strawberry cheesecake topping. The CM's filling was light, airy, only mildly sweet with a layer of fudge and sprayed-on whipped cream rounding it out. They were both impressive to look at but were a bit undistinctive and boring tastewise.  When I was at the one in Whitehall, I wished I had ordered a steak. As we were on our way to this one in Coraopolis, I told myself to order a steak. As I sat down, I told myself to order a steak. As I dined, I wished I had ordered a steak. When I left I wished I had ordered a steak.   Why the hell didn't I just order a steak?"}
{"text":"I love this chicken salad, but I will say this.  A couple yrs ago I ordered a chicken parmigiana & all I got was 3 pieces of chicken.  No, pasta...I was like WTF"}
{"text":"Wife and I were in Pittsburg looking for a house. Got in later than expected and went to hotel to check in and then decided to go to a restaurant near by. Armstrongs had great Yelp reviews and was bitterly down the street from the hotel. The place was moved and the hostess told us there was a 30 minute wait. That was disappointing for the wait but we stayed as we were starving. Turned out to be about 15-20 minutes and we were seated. The waitress was super friendly and a real bubbly personality. I had the chicken parm with salad and french fries. The chicken farm was delicious and the fries were very good as well. If in the area definitely worth a stop. If in the are again I will definitely go here again Great food and great service."}
{"text":"The food is always good.  I've never had anything here that wasn't top notch on flavor.  The service can be hit or miss.  I know they get busy, but when you feel that they don't have time for you, it makes me uncomfortable.  I'd probably go there more often if the staff was better.  This past Saturday night I had the stuffed Eggplant Parmesan.  It was wonderful!  Our waiter, AJ, was fantastic.  He provided probably the best service that I have ever had at Armstrong's.  Overall, the food is great and huge portions."}
{"text":"Wanted to find a quick lunch place close to my hotel.   Luckily I chose Armstrong's.   Lunch was fabulous.   I had the hot sausage baked casserole which came with a Caesar salad.  Both were delicious.   Will definitely come back next time in town."}
{"text":"Armstrong's is good for Italian with red sauce.  You receive generous portions for your dollar and the service is always good.  I am a fan of the Chicken Parmesan, the Ziti with meat sauce, and the Meatball Casserole.  They serve Mancini's bread, which is my fave, and the chocolate banana pie and coconut creme pie are delish!"}
{"text":"Love this place, had a huge steak salad for lunch along with the mozzarella cheese sticks."}
{"text":"The Penne Pasta with Vodka Sauce is off the charts. So good!  Great with chicken. This will feed two adults no problem. Tons of food."}
{"text":"No doubt about it, the food is 5 stars. I could eat every meal of every day here. And the staff is friendly, too. They open my wine bottle for me if there is ever a wait so I can enjoy a glass while I wait for a table.  However, it holds true that one bad apple ruins the bunch. There is one waitress there that has been outwardly rude on two separate occasions. The first time I let it slide. Everyone has a bad day. Second time was worse. I was actually stunned when I asked if I could have white clam sauce on my side of pasta and she just said \"no\". No apology, no reasoning, no counter offer, just no. When she walked away, my dinner guest and I actually discussed the fact that neither one of us could remember a time when we were just told \"no\" to something that was on the menu. (Granted, this would be an exception being that it was a side dish- but the ingredients were available). I would have gladly paid any required upcharge. I would not steer you away for this reason, because the food is the bomb. But I was pretty disappointed in my last two experiences with this particular waitress."}
{"text":"The buffalo chicken sandwich was awesome. It had 2 patties on it. It's a massive sandwich. Every bite was yummy!"}
{"text":"Update:  Never again!  I always try to give this place a second, third, and fourth chance, but never again!  We went there last night and were served by Kristy.  We weren't even sitting for a minute and she pretty much demanded our ENTIRE ORDER!  Hardly looked at the menu.  The table was still dirty.  Kristy was more interested in sitting down and talking with some guy at another table, than serving customers during dinner rush.  The food was fine, but another server had to bring out the food, because she was too busy chatting it up with the guy two tables away.  She was very rude not only to us, but also was saying rude things about other tables at the drink fountains, probably loud enough for them to hear, too!  She threw the check on the table without asking if we wanted any dessert.  I like to take a piece of cheesecake home, but evidently it wasn't meant to be.  Honestly, I used to think the bad service was always a one off, but not anymore.  They have been consistently rude to us every time we come in.  Plus, I think they put something in the food.  I live less than a mile away, and by the time I get home, I am almost ready to shit my pants EVERY TIME I GO THERE!!!!!  So, we won't be coming here anymore.  Everyone in Moon loves this place, but I think it is terrible!  Either I'm a snob or everyone in Moon has no sense of taste!"}
{"text":"Traveling from Michigan and decided to Armstrongs due to good reviews. I was Extremely disappointed by the bland flavor of food. My chicken Parmesan I make at home blows away what I ate for dinner. I would rather have small portions of flavorful food than gigantic portions of so so food."}
{"text":"The food is great and comes in large portions. Plan on sharing or taking some home. They have great chicken parm and their vodka sauce is delicious."}
{"text":"Quality food that has stood the test of time. I haven't been here for years and it was exactly as I remember it. The steak salad was full of steak, french fries and hard boiled eggs. The pasta dishes were flavorful with a thick meat sauce. The meatballs are large and garlicky - two could easily make an a meal. I was happy to see the peanut butter pie was still on the menu. The familiarity made for a good meal."}
{"text":"Have been here several times a year for three or four years. Never disappointed. Warning to first timers: you will be served a lot of food. The portions are enough for for three servings so plan on a take home container. I'm generally not impressed with huge servings but since the food is pretty good, I eat leftovers from Armstrong's. The specials are usually good. Much variety on the menu. If you get there between 4-5 p.m. you won't have to wait for a table."}
{"text":"I love Armstrong's. I really do. Been a customer for so long now.  The portions are insane. I've come home with leftovers that last a few days. No joke. Their red sauce is so flavorful. Definite authentic tradition in their cooking style."}
{"text":"I've come to Armstrong's numerous times. I've always had great service, big portions well worth the money, and a quiet environment."}
{"text":"The only thing that would be nice is if they had a liquor license. And in spite the name, this is the place to get great Italian food.  The portion sizes are HUGE. I recommend the chicken Romano and the Italian wedding soup. Eggplant parmigiano, pizza and calzones are also great."}
{"text":"Nice Family Italian Restaurant; Had stuff peppers, tasted great (may use MSG, do not know). Good service"}
{"text":"I really like this place, it has authentic Italian food. Even though it's very pricey but the food is very delicious, me and my grandmother come here all the time, ain't nothing better than having a bowl of wedding soup and some breadsticks along with some pasta."}
{"text":"I love this place. The penne vodka is the best I have ever had. I am always craving it! We always get the fried provolone as an appetizer. My husband loves the stuffed eggplant. The portions are huge!! Service is great! Also it is BYOB."}
{"text":"We came here with some long-time locals and can see why it is so popular and boy, is this place popular.  We got here at 6:00pm on a Saturday evening and it was already packed.  We were told their would be 30 minutes but was more like 15...  Our waitress was a seasoned professional moving efficiently around the restaurnt.  They don't served wine buy we called ahead and were told we could bring our own.  We were quickly brought proper stemware! YEAH! We chose from the Italian side of he menu, Chicken Parmesan, Sausage, Peppers, and Onions over penne, Ravioli, and the house Red Sauce over spaghetti.  The portion sizes we're just on the side of large, not huge, with only a portion of one entree making it into a take out box.  All entrees came with soup or salad and were fresh, tasty and a perfect accent to the meal.  I would definitely recommend Armstrong's for local flavor and families."}
{"text":"I could write a book about Armstrongs. Here are the basics.   Delicious Food- yes! Attentive Staff- yes! (John was on excellent last night)  High Quality- yes!  Huge Portions- yes!   If I had to choose one item to pick as a favorite- I couldn't. This isn't a place known for something, Armstrong's is known for everything they do.   Calzones - delicious and huge to the point of being ridiculous. I've been ordering  them for over 20+ years. They don't  get any better! Fresh, high quality ingredients. Made to order. Perfected sauce. Fresh dough done right. Amazing meats. Enough for the whole family, yet made perfectly specific for one. When I order this I know I've invested in meal not for just one night but also maybe a little snack later, lunch the next day, and maybe even dinner the next night. It's so good.   Wings. So good. Despite the plethora of amazing wing options nearby & amazing other options Armstongs offers, the wings are a favorite. Often when attending parties they're my go to pick up. Always a crowd pleaser and never a wing left in the pan! Tons of compliments abound when Armstongs wings arrive.   Chicken Parm to go- yes please! Could it get any easier to feed a crowd a \"home cooked meal\". Not when you have Armstrongs. Another family secret for serving a crowd at our home when time is crunched and we want an excellent meal. A tray of Armstrongs Chicken Parm is the answer! Quick, ridiculously easy, ridiculously cheap for a large crowd, ridiculously always given TONS of complements for barely lifting a finger."}
