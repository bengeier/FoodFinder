{"text":"Without question, the worst Chinese meal I've ever had. Place needs a major overhaul. So does the food. Won't consider going back."}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese food I've EVER fucking had. The general Tsos chicken is so damn good. Fried rice is the fucking shit. Prices are legit too."}
{"text":"I've ordered multiple dishes from Hunan King and they are always delicious. For the area, I won't go anywhere else. Their service is prompt and polite, and always generous portions. Prices are great. Don't be deterred by the interior... the food is worth it."}
{"text":"I personally was underwhelmed. This place has no ambiance whatsoever. There was no music playing in the background, not really any kind of decorations, nothing. It was so silent the whole time I was here to the point where it was downright weird. For my meal, I ordered the pork with Chinese vegetables lunch special and chose hot and sour soup. The other order in my party was pepper steak with an egg roll. We both had hot tea to drink. I tried the egg roll and it was pretty bland. It tasted like the ones you find at Chinese buffets, just bland and not crispy. The hot and sour soup was actually pretty decent and I did enjoy it. As for the meals, my pork was just average, but the pepper steak was pretty good; the sauce was decent and it came with pretty good quality peppers. Portion sizes were alright (not a ton but just enough) and prices were reasonable. Our bill for two was $12.15. As far as the service, our waitress was attentive, but had such little customer interaction. We'd ask for something and she'd bring it back fairly promptly but never really said anything at all to us other than \"ok\" and \"sure\". She'd just do the minimum interaction and then hurry back to the kitchen. Overall, the food was ok and the prices were right, but there are definitely better options nearby so I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I frequent hunan king. I'm a really big fan of their beef lo mein. general so's is good too."}
{"text":"For as long as I can remember now, my family has ordered take out from Hunan King on Christmas Eve.  Partly tradition, partly convenience and partly value.  For around $5 their lunch special includes an entree, steamed or fried rice and soup or an egg roll.  The food is always good and the portions are large for the cost.  Definitely worth a stop if you are nearby around lunch time."}
{"text":"This is one of the best chinese restaurants. Don't be put off by the interior. The food is excellent. My favorite is the chicken and brocolli."}
{"text":"Below average Chinese food. It's not too expensive, but there are plenty of better options in the area. Food was edible but I wouldn't order it again."}
{"text":"We ordered take out here last Friday night.  I had the beef with broccoli which was inexplicably slimy, and the meat was gray but the broccoli was the best I've ever had.  My friend had the sesame chicken, and that was very good.  I also ordered hot and sour soup and I think because it was the end of the night they gave me all the hot and sour soup on hand because it was in a full quart container.  It was good, I've never had hot and sour soup that tasted as theirs did.  I'm not sure what was going on, but all the elements were there.  There was tofu, mushrooms, and it was spicy.  I think I liked it?  I'm not sure!  The deliver was quick and it was relatively inexpensive.  Overall, I'd say it was just ok.  I'd order from them again, but would avoid ordering the beef with broccoli."}
{"text":"The interior of the restaurant is a total dive so I wouldn't take any potential romantic partners here but the food is pretty good.    Sure, it's not the absolute best Chinese food but it's decent and quite inexpensive.    I eat here often for lunch.   They have great lunch specials."}
{"text":"Excellent food for take out! We always get the chicken with veggies and sauce on the side and the general tsos. It is excellent! Fast service and they always answer the phone. I would not recommend eating at this place. Best for take out!"}
