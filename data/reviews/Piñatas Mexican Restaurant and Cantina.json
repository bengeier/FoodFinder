{"text":"I ate lunch here with clients. They said they are regulars, and since I love Mexican food, I met them there.  There were three of us in the party.  By the time I arrived, they were already eating chips and salsa which were very good.  I ordered the camarones diablos (spicy shrimps), and they were amazing.  Everything I ate was delicious with large portions.  It is very authentic Mexican food and I highly recommend it.  The service was a little slow, but nothing to get upset about.  5-stars for sure!!"}
{"text":"OK....filled the gap which was what we were hoping for. Tacos w no tomato or sour cream?  Flautas chicken and beef were good.  Sides were OK...eh.  Great friendly service."}
{"text":"Came in with low expectations for the food that were properly met. Large potions however, if you are trying to fatten up. Had the jalapeno poppers and shrimp tacos to go. They give you bland chips and salsa too, because Mexico."}
{"text":"This place has been closed for at least a month. I tried to call today, and the phone is disconnected.  Has anyone heard anything?  Is it undergoing a management change, or is it gone for good?"}
{"text":"The guy that's the owner was extremely rude. He gets an attitude because I asked about a complimentary appetizer for Browns Sunday that was on their flyer..He was clueless about what it was..So he left and never returned 2 my table. It was only 2 tables, so it wasn't busy.He comes 2 the end of the bar, say something in Spanish,  then the waitress came 2 my table with my bill. I asked her where did he go?..She gets a attitude and say he left the restaurant. I had 2 let her know that their customer service was terrible. She states that if I don't like it then don't come back..So rude & unprofessional. .Who gets aggravated with a customer that's spending money at their restaurant? ..No patience & I hope they don't be in business for long!!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious! I was kinda scared to go here because of the reviews i don't know why people are complaining. Service was good. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was because I thought it was a bit pricey for the food. The place was empty when I got there so I don't know if that had to do with the other bad reviews or because I went at an odd time"}
{"text":"This is a fine Mexican restaurant and I don't like Mexican but the man that has his place knows how to cook also no sound and just if you don't like the food authentic Mexican food"}
{"text":"Food was very good. Huge portions and reasonably priced. For two (hungry) people, we couldn't finish the appetizer or our entrees. Strawberry margarita was delicious, we preferred it to the margarita azul. Service was extremely quick and friendly. Will definitely be visiting again!"}
{"text":"Pinatas used to be Mi Pueblos years ago, and yes I had eaten some takeout dinners from Mi Pueblos, and I wasn't impressed. So when my client told me he wanted to meet me at Pinatas, I told him, hey, I know exactly where it's at !  But to be honest, I have not been a fan of Mexican food myself because I somehow don't have a taste for beans. Plus yes I do realize the importance of eating vegetables, and O that wholesome guac !!!! I got friends who will die for good guacamole, but hell yeah, I will give my best shot to eat that healthy stuff, but I won't give up my taste for good meats for some greens. I confess that, If I was a plant, I would be carnivorous one.  So the reason I was at this restaurant was not to discover some gem of Latin food, but to see if I can perhaps lay my hands on that legendary Aztec gold  through my Mexican client.  Yes, my client was a Mexican, and he generously offered to treat me even. I sensed that perhaps my sixth sense was right. My client may indeed have connections to some extra money (a tingle) if not Aztec gold. And I can't be rude to him.  So I took up the offer, and ordered \"Special Monterrey\" according to his recommendation.  Voila! Achtung! Sayonara! Muy Bien!!  I was pleasantly surprised by what followed.  I don't even know what it was that I ate then. He said it is called \"flautas' and it is authentic Mexican dish !!!  Speaking about authentic, I must blame my ignorance of Mexican food. Yes there is Chipotle, and yes I like their food too. But the flautas that I found there was a huge leap to the moon as far as my knowledge of Mexican food goes. I don't claim to be the Marco Polo of Mexican Restaurants and expand stories of my adventure. After all, I was there to see if I could put my hands on the smoldering and shiny piece of Aztec gold, and sorry to say that I haven't gotten a clue on how to get to those gold as yet, and once I do, I will generously share with everyone I know, especially with my fellow Yelpers.   Anyway, to make the long story short, I found the service to be fast and good. The food was very fresh, flautas(that I tasted for the first time) was just amazing. The portion was huge and I could not finish it, so my plan is to go back there after a gigantic workout session and I know I can consume all that healthy greens and feel healthy. After all, Mexican food seems to be in now, so I dare say I shall return to this place definitely !!!!"}
{"text":"Mi Pueblos gets a new Yelp page because they renovated the place? My bad experience still stands - overpriced crappy food and bad service. Do yourself a favor and find the old Mi Pueblos review page."}
{"text":"My husband I have been to Pinata's 3 times now, and each time we have the same feeling when we leave: the food is great, but the service is awful. Our water glasses were empty for half of our meal; the bus-boy dropped queso off to our table (after the waiter forgot and yelled across the restaurant to him to get it), and didn't bring a chip refill (and we only had 5 left in the basket); at the end of our meal, we asked for containers to take the queso and chips home, and the waiter asked us if we'd also like to take the chips...he then brought us the containers, but forgot the chips! We're just always so disappointed because, no matter how busy they are, the food is excellent but the service is just horrendous."}
{"text":"If you have a car, head to Cozumels or Barrios. Nothing special. Waitress was rude and no one was there. Two stars for the gigantic margarita though! Something that big usually gets me tipsy but I'm assuming they skimped out on the alcohol because it didn't effect me at all. The chips and salsa were okay. I can't even remember the main course. Bathroom is pretty ghetto. A forgettable overpriced place."}
{"text":"The portions are large, the food is surprisingly good, and the staff is polite. GREAT,  CLEAN establishment reasonable prices."}
{"text":"This place wasn't that bad as the other reviews made it out to be. The staff were all very friendly. The food was like every other Mexican place on the planet. It is what I was expecting. No one at our table was disappointed."}
{"text":"After renaming it got better for a minute. Now the margaritas are margarita mix with little to no tequila.  The salsa taste like tomato paste. We had to find a server and use a take out menu because no one seated us. Then we used a coupon and our meal cost more than normal. Don't bother going there's better service and food all around."}
{"text":"Typical americanized mexican food. We ordered queso, quesadilla and steak fajitas. Plenty of food and everything was tasty. I know some of the other reviews said they have bad service but I've been here twice and both times they were super friendly and working really hard to make sure we were having a good meal. Only 1 waiter for about 10 tables but he was busting his ass and did a great job. I live right down the street so I'll be back."}
{"text":"Well yesterday was my second time here and my last! My boyfriend and I tried this place several months ago and we were pretty impressed. This time...not so much!  We both ordered the Pollo Loco #69. The chicken was clearly processed as it came in rectangle sheets (pretty odd description, right? but SPOT ON). When it first came out my immediate thought was that it looked like the McRib. It was gross! I also felt like the \"housemade Mexican rice\" was the stuff that comes frozen in a bag at GFS...if I wanted microwaved food I would go to the grocery store and purchase $4 frozen meals...I can be sure that they would've been better.  I would consider myself somewhat of a Mexican food connoisseur as it is by far my favorite food so I was really bummed that I wasted a Mexican night on this place.  DON'T DO IT!"}
{"text":"Should have read reviews before going - yelp is always right. Plenty of other options to explore in the Case Western area. If you find yourself craving Mexican fare and landing at this location - ask for their homemade hot sauce. It's very hot and tasty - the only positive experience to an otherwise tasteless meal."}
