{"text":"This place is amazing! Wonderful flavors to choose from (samples to try them all) and even Vegan Honey with health benefits like willow bark for pain and local sage for your allergies! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"When I planned a visit to the indoor swap meet to check Vegan Honey out, I didn't expect the product to be as superb as it is! All of the artisan honeys on display are crafted locally by Jennifer, the owner of the business. The variety of exotic honeys on display is truly impressive, with dozens of unique flavors and health benefits. Willow honey, pomegranate honey, jalape√±o honey, sage honey, and blueberry honey are just a few of the types of honey on display. Jennifer was very helpful and kind, offering information on each type of honey along with free samples. This is a tasty one-of-a-kind product in the Las Vegas valley, so I will definitely be back for more honey when I am in the area.  From the front entrance, the Vegan Honey booth was located in the far back-right corner of the indoor swap meet when I visited on 04/22/2016. It had a lavender-purple theme and was very clean and organized, so it was hard to miss."}
{"text":"The vegan honey company is hands down my favorite. The lady there is always so sweet, and friendly. Her honey is the best, I always go back for more. The tea stand next to hers is also amazing. Great environment, and just a great place to be"}
{"text":"What can I say about vegan honey? I am not a vegan, and I probably never will be. I found this place by accident, just wandering around the Fantastic Indoor Swapmeet on Decatur, and thought I would sample some of the honey. My expectations were not very high at all but I'm so glad I stopped there. The shop owner let me try sample after sample and each one was really good! I was surprised at how amazing they all were!   She probably has around 30 flavors and I tried about 10 of them. I ended up with lavender, cinnamon chaga (which is a medicinal mushroom) I know it sounds gross but it is amazingly delicious, chai and ginger. I have been putting them in my tea and I can't get enough. I'm going to use them in barbecue sauces and desserts. Her prices are reasonable too. The jars I bought were $5.00 and there is one size smaller than that. They have larger ones too.   Whether you are vegan or not, check them out! You will love the product (which is also safe for babies because of their method of making the honey)."}
