{"text":"Amazing hidden gem in Lachine. Great menu and a frequent delivery go-to spot. Friendly staff and quick service."}
{"text":"Cooked really well, nice and tender meats. I had the sichuan shrimp which was suppose to be spicy, but I didn't found it was, so people who don't like to burn their tongues would like it. I also had the broccoli beef, which was very tasty and fine the way it was. I felt that this restaurant dulled down their recipes to not overwhelm their french quebecer customer base in the area, because I see this non-confrontational set of flavors in many restaurants that are in french areas, and see friends and others enjoying it. But as for myself, it isn't for me. I'm from the west island.. I'm more use to heavy cooking. I've spoken with the owner just in a casual conversation, and she seemed extremely kind and friendly, and I feel like she wouldn't mind if I asked them to make their spicy dishes really spicy for me. I was surprised with the amount of shrimp they put in my dish, and both of what I ordered came in pretty big quantities, and the price was decent too. I had ordered 2 meals, with a serving of white rice and white rice vermicelli noodles, and it all came up to about 29$. Definitely going back and giving them another try."}
{"text":"So I'm here on business and visiting a construction site and after a while I'm starving.  I see a bunch of Italian places, burger joints and then my colleague says \"hey, there is a Tai place over there, let's try it\". 

So we did.   Wow.  I got the General Tao chicken with rice and a spring roll. Boom!   This must have been the best General Tao chicken I have ever had and I have eaten that 100 times in 5 countries and countless states.  The spring roll was also really good and the price was the best part!  

If I end up over here again I'm definitely coming back.  What a nice little find!  

Enjoy!"}
