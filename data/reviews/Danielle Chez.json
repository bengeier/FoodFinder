{"text":"My friend and I were wandering Madison, taking a short writing break from our cabin at General Butler State Park (about 15 minutes away), when we stumbled across this little French bistro.  And it's a French bistro.   The food was amazing (her salad, my turkey sandwich). It's hard to describe how great this was so I won't try. But it was so just trust me and let's move along.  There's limited seating -- maybe 10 tables -- and you won't have the food delivered quickly. But it's worth the extra few minutes wait. And the coffee -- oh the coffee.   The wine selection was amazing (I'm told, I don't drink). I know the tiramisu for dessert was awesome. It lasted for about 5 seconds once the waitress brought it out."}
{"text":"Out of Business. Dined there once and never went back. Food was less than mediocre and overpriced.  Made reservation a week in advance for a special occasion, but were seated at the worst table right at the kitchen door. Service was awful. Very disappointing and not surprised that it didn't last long"}
{"text":"Ditto Brad K  Surprisingly excellent food...very much an authentic French Bistro..or about as authentic as you will get in the midwest given the dearth of ingredients :-)  Very nice and approachable wine list.....terrific value and at least one very knowledgeable wine babe !  Honestly....this place and a couple of others are well worth the trip from afar"}
