{"text":"Love the tea here. You will not want to go back to Panera tea after you've had the brewed mint tea. Iced tea is just as good. I don't know what he does or puts in it but this man knows his tea.   The food is simple, a little plain but good. Never gotten fries here but the hummus is smooth and has a nice flavor with good quality olive oil, the pitas are warm and fresh (and you get  two so they will fill you up) and I actually like the kufta here better than Layalina's which is saying something because I love that place (but am not a fan of their kufta). Lentil soup is also tasty and filling. The  falafel does leave something to be desired.  I also don't mind the guy behind the counter. If you absolutely must be kowtowed to with fake enthusiasm and mock-pleasure to serve you this is not your place. This guy smiles at you its genuine."}
{"text":"Of all restaurants in Chambana, this is by far my favorite. I used to go several times as week for either lunch or dinner when I was still in the area. The food is homemade-like, which was always a big plus for me. I prefer to be on the healthy side, and Jerusalem offers that option with the bonus of being cheap. And this fact makes it unique in a college town, where most people are craving for cheap junk food.  I would go most frequently for the \"plate of the day\" #202 with chicken. It is a big tray with an assortment of tasty items. So big, that sometimes you would end up saving half of it for dinner.  I can more simply define Jerusalem as: tasty, tasty, tasty. Totally love it.  Ah, yes, the owner. Some people complain about him. Well, after going for so many times, I found out he is a very warm person. He might not give you a fake smile the first time you walk into his restaurant, but he will give you a genuine smile the fifth time you go there."}
{"text":"Honestly, my expectations couldn't have been faltered this much. My first and last time. Overpriced for a small portion and bland."}
{"text":"The food is quite good and reasonable. It can get busy at lunch and the owner does seem a bit frustrated at times, but he is always very kind and gracious. I love giving him the business and I love the taste of his food! I give it 4 stars because service can be hit or miss."}
{"text":"Great food and good specials! I recommend the lunch plate - it's a ton of food for $7! The spiced tea (hot or cold) is delicious, too."}
{"text":"This restaurant serves very healthy food. Love the plate of the day. Best option for vegetarians in Champaign-Urbana."}
{"text":"Inexpensive, solid falafel and fries. Good mint tea. Nice to have a place with solid cheap eats in the middle of campus town."}
{"text":"the food is just about as authentic as you can possibly get at a very fair and reasonable price point"}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat in Urbana-Champaign.   (+) extraTASTY; healthy; both the owner and the cook are very nice; calm and quiet environment (-) sometimes slow;   The best deal is probably the plate of the day. For $7 you get a share-sized (or after-workout-sized) meal consisting of various sides (rice, cooked veggies, legumes, hummus, salad, pita bread) and your choice of meat.  When I come alone, I usually get something smaller. Most often: 1. falafel sandwich ($4)    Delicious!!! 2. rice and veggies (small for $3) 3. lentil soup (small for $2.75) Dolmeh (Stuffed Grape Leaves) is great too, but rather expensive.  Their tea (especially the cold mint tea in the summer) is excellent and is included in the plate of the day."}
{"text":"I really like this place. It's inexpensive, quick, and always very filling. It's not the very best Middle Eastern food that I've ever had, but it's definitely up there. I usually order the lamb shawarma sandwich and a side of falafel. There are two men who work there, and both are pretty serious, but it doesn't bother me."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place in C-U for a quick, cheap lunch. I always get the falafel sandwich combo ($6), which isn't anything mind-blowing but also never disappoints. Atmosphere is very relaxed and the restaurant is never too crowded -- I am always comfortable here. The guy at the counter is pretty stony-faced, but he's always polite. When you order he'll give you a number that (as far as I can tell) is totally random. I wonder if there's some kind of secret pattern to them..."}
{"text":"The food was INCREDIBLY good, I highly recommend the chicken kabob sandwhich. You come in here and don't expect much, but the food is phenomenol. Going to come here more often, and the prices are great too. Great food for a great price! Chicken is cooked to a perfection! Came here for a quick eat and left with a new appreciation for middle Eastern food! Daily specials get you full with less than $10."}
{"text":"Pros:  Shawarma sandwich was decent.  Kefta Kabob meat was not bad (ordered Kefta Kabob plate).    Cons: Ambiance.  Plate of the day was not that great (the day I went in at least).  Rest of food being mediocre.    Passed by this place every day, went in to check it out at the suggestion of a friend.  Though I had friends who went there often, I didn't go back, and don't really plan to."}
{"text":"My classmate and I went here recently because we hadn't heard anything about it and were feeling adventurous.  The food was actually pretty good and I, at least, left satisfied.  But this may have been for of the same reason I thought the 5th fast and the furious movie was pretty good   -   I wasn't expecting much.  highlights: -fairly cheap -probably not as bad as you think"}
{"text":"I know other reviewers took issue with the interior of the restaurant or the attitude of the owner, but I absolutely love Jerusalem for its excellent food.  The hummus is to die for. So creamy! We usually get the dish of the day. All the vegetable dishes I've tried are very yummy (especially the spinach dish), and there are many options if you are a vegetarian. My personal favorite is the fish. It's fried tender and juicy without being greasy and seasoned perfectly with a hint of spiciness.  The most important reason why I always prefer Jerusalem to other restaurant options in the area is that all dishes taste like home-made food, prepared according to traditional recipes with great care. It's cheap, but definitely not cheaply prepared!"}
{"text":"I hate to give bad reviews, especially as it seems the owner tries really hard (as seen in other reviews). However, this just cannot stand. I ordered the combination meal during lunch today with my friend, and, although it looks pretty in my picture, it really just wasn't good. The food was almost flavorless, the chicken was very pink inside, the hummus was thin, and the salad was cold. This is coming from a Middle Eastern person, mind you. Also, for some added protein, I got a free ladybug in my salad! I'm so, so happy I looked at my fork before eating, or else I would've eaten this little (dead) guy. I really wanted to give this place a try, as Mashawi Grill is gone now, but it just isn't great. I don't think I'll be going back. The owner was nice about giving me a refund for my food, though, so there's that."}
{"text":"Jerusalem was my favorite place to eat the 4 years I was there. Amazing, fresh and healthy food that is prepared in a no nonsense sort of way. Hameed the guy who works there does everything and does a remarkable job of running the place. If you go often enough he is kind enough to give you a little something extra with every meal order. The fish is excellent with the lunch special."}
{"text":"This is our favorite restaurant in Champaign, IL when we drive down.  The food is very authentic and deliciious.    Haven't had a bad item here.  The Baba Ganoush is delicious and the Dolmas are one of our favorites.  The Chicken Kebob sandwich is outstanding.    It is probably one of the worst looking restaurants I've seen inside all the way around, but it's fine.   It's still a great casual place to eat.  Not sure if the man behind the counter is the owner.    He seems to be a good person, he recognizes us and with much effort sometimes we can get a few words out of him, but  just has zero personality, no smile, no life to him, nothing.    It would be nice if he could be more outgoing and social, but might not be possible for him.   It's fine though.  Service is slow, but again the food is authentic and delicious, so it's worth it.  If you appreciate good quality food, then I'd highly recommend this place. If you are looking for fine dining in a modern restaurant, then you won't like it."}
{"text":"The restaurant itself is small place, with a bad lighting. Looks like an old and unloved place by its owner. The owner usually has an attitude towards the customers! He's angry and look fiercely in your eyes, as if you shouldn't be there to taste his cooking! It is not irritating though, I feel it's more funny and something to laugh at with friends!  It's a one man show by the way, he is the cook and the counter-holder. Works almost like a fast food, except for the fact  that it is not fast!   Now the food itself. I've had Shawerma here, as well as Falafel and some other stuff which I can't remember their names. By far, the meal you want to order in this restaurant is the Shawerma. Having said that, I prefer the Gyros from \"Zorba's\" which is just 2 minutes walking south of this place. They are more tender and juicy, and the bread in their Gyro is much better."}
{"text":"I tried the Chicken Shawrma Sandwich. it was good! But wait time is too long! :("}
{"text":"I have been to a lot of middle eastern restaurants so I believe I have a bit of an expectation. THIS PLACE IS TOTAL LETDOWN. Waste of money! Chicken shwarama sandwich had 3 pieces of chicken. Falafel sandwich was drenched in oil & whole lot of sauces."}
{"text":"The quality of the food is inconsistent. I used to love their falafel, but the last time I had it, it was so bitter it wasn't edible. The guy who works there seems very stressed and angry. He doesn't ever smile. The prices are good and when the food is good, it is decent."}
{"text":"Very good food! The one guy that works there and takes the orders does a good job at cooking it all too. I always get the steak shawarma! He closes pretty early for dinner, so be sure to not get there within the last 15 or 20 minutes because he will only let you order it to-go."}
{"text":"The ingredients are very fresh, and the food is tasty and healthy. Price is very reasonable. I go here almost daily."}
{"text":"Ordered the grape leaves appetizer + lamb/beef shawarma plate with rice and vegetables (the other option was pita/hummus). The plate came with a side choice of soup or salad - we went with lentil soup. After tax the total was $16 something. A bit on the pricey side compared to places like this in the northern suburbs of Chicago but the food was tasty and the crowd was diverse. I would have preferred everything to be a little less salty. For 2 people that was enough food. We left very full, satisfied, and thirsty. I would come back to try their sandwiches."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite restaurant in Chambana!  I've now tried the falafal,  shawarma and lamb kebab sandwiches and they're all some of the best I've ever had.  The falafal is very fresh and moist.  Not your typical dried out American falafal.   The yogurt salad is homemade and the perfect side for any of their sandwiches.   Also, the samosas are lightly fried and delicately delicious.  This place is also incredibly cheap. Really too cheap, I don't know how they stay in business with these prices.  The actual physical space is modestly decorated with middle eastern art and photos.  It's sort of subtly charming.  It's a casual and comfortable place to sit and it's nice and cool during the summer.  Give this restaurant a try, it rivals the best middle eastern food I've had in New York and Chicago and even the middle east itself!"}
{"text":"I'm surprised by some of the positive reviews this place has received. The food is horrible, and having lived near Jerusalem, let me tell you - the food here has nothing to do with Jerusalem. Just not worth going!"}
{"text":"Awesome lentil soup, tasty entrees. Yes, the owner is an interesting guy. I have had similar experiences as other reviewers. Excellent value."}
{"text":"Not sure I'd evem give them 1 star..false advertising. Menu on Yelp states Lentil soup is made with Olive oil.   Upon driving out of way here I was informed by an authentic looking & sounding Soup Nazi that it's Soy oil.  There will be NO soup for me here!"}
{"text":"I entered, ordered at the counter, and only then did I look around and notice every single person had ordered the special that comes with hummus, salad, and chicken. Every one of them. Wish I had noticed that before I ordered the lamb kebab.   The food itself was the only disappointing part of my experience at Jerusalem. The lamb kebab was a decent sized portion - not at all generous, but totally within the realm of \"decent\". The flavor, and particularly the texture, of the kebab was a totally different story. It was somewhere between \"acceptable\" and \"gross\" and possibly the worst kebab I've ever had.  It is worth mentioning that I didn't have the same experience other reviewers had with the owner. He was not at all rude. I hadn't even decided yet before he asked if I was ready to order, and he gave me all the time I needed to read the menu. The decor that other reviewers complained about is unpretentious and perfectly fine by me. There's absolutely nothing wrong with the place except the kebab. I do want to return to try the special - it looked like lots more food for the price. I will update this review if I have an experience that changes my opinion, but for now, I'm giving this place a solid \"meh\"."}
{"text":"There are so many diverse cultural experiences to be had in Champaign and that's what really makes this community so great- we integrate together by sharing stories of home, through our food heritage. Today brought me to Jerusalem Middle Eastern Cuisine. Parking was very convenient; call it luck, but I got a wonderful spot right outside the restaurant with metered parking. The interior is decorated in middle eastern Arabic themes, some telling stories of being at the mosque, others depicting cities in rich watercolor or Arabic writings. The menu is tasty and varied; lots of options of meats vegetables and other middle eastern delights. I choose the special beef and lamb shwarma to-go with Turkish coffee and the owner was super nice compared to what some reviews say. I waited about 10 minutes and done, done; my food was ready.   The Turkish coffee was piping hot and lightly sweetened, yet the taste was out of this world refreshing, delicious and politely sweetened. The notes smelling it were of sage, turmeric; as well as other spices. The shwarma had a similar flavor and it was still pretty delicious yet different; I will say I wish the lamb had more body and wasn't so...falling apart, there wasn't much tenderness. The beef was very tasty and I loved the sauce. Overall I will return to try something different. I did however commit the crime of putting my coffee over ice; living a little. Still very flavorful and delicious."}
{"text":"This place is usually empty for a reason. Like the 3 other restaurants adjacent, it is dated and unattractive. That would be fine though, if the food was any good. It's not. The meat (lamb) was dry and stringy; overcooked and with a texture like cotton. The bread is meh. The fries? From frozen, and they're no good either. A waste of my time (took a while for my order to be ready) and money. To top it all off, service is abysmal. The owner, who is probably the only employee, is cold and withdrawn, speaking little to no words, even when taking your order. This is not a comfortable place to eat, and the food doesn't help."}
{"text":"I want to love Jerusalem.  I really, really do.  Here are the reasons why I can't:  The tabouli is the worst intentionally edible thing I've ever tasted.  By any stretch of the imagination, if it were good, it should be called a tomato and cucumber salad.  But it is awful. The rice tastes like Uncle Ben's instant rice.  Here are the reasons why I gave it three stars:  The grape leaves/dolma are delicious. The guy always seems stressed out and I feel empathy for him.  Everything else there that I've tried is really just okay.  My argument should be that it's fast and easy to get, but it's not because with just one employee during the day the service takes forever.  I guess I just want to support the business in hopes that it will some day improve."}
{"text":"Just awesome.... vegetarian plate is great,cheap and  healthy"}
{"text":"Food is very fresh here ! I am a big fan of Jerusalem these days. I can see the one and only guy cooking, taking orders and cleaning. Freshness of food and the guy's dedication to serve quality food impressed me.   Nonetheless,  I see some reviews complaining about an absence of \"smiley\" welcome or food being served late. It's up to you, folks !!... Go to a chain restaurant if you want it \"fast\" with lots of \"smiles\". Whatever makes you happy."}
{"text":"Amazing falafel, hot and fresh! and their chicken shawarma? with tahini is good and healthy?."}
{"text":"Wonderful hummus and everything else, too!  Take your chances with the plate of a day, it's a bargain and an adventure!  And you'll get delightful hummus, pita, salad and rice along with the special items of the day.  The service can be a little slow since it's ONE MAN running the show but he takes his time with each person's order and serves up tasty plates!  The Arabian tea is also delish!"}
{"text":"Great food, great place to get together with friends, great prices! Don't be intimidated by the owner... He might come off as anti-social but he is a nice guy once you get to know him. Give the place a shot... You won't regret it! I personally love the falafal!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic- I eat lunch here at least once a week (have not tried it for dinner).  I know middle eastern food well, and have eaten falafel in many cities.  The falafel sandwich is one of the best I've ever had.  The yogurt salad (yogurt with cucumber, mint, parsley, etc.) is delicious, and the lamb kebab sandwich is also fantastic.  The prices are AMAZING.  This place is so far above most of the junk you find on Green St.- I highly recommend turning on to Wright St. instead of continuing on Green when looking for a tasty, inexpensive lunch near campus.  They also have incredible meat and spinach pies, and a samosa with the most delicate, tasty shell I've ever had.  It's definitely a hole in the wall, but the owner plays jazz, blues, and middle eastern music, or the news, which makes it a pleasant place to sit and eat.  It's a must try."}
{"text":"This place was way worse than what I expected. There's only one grumpy person running the whole place, so it took forever for the food to get ready. He doesn't talk or even smile. Servings are small for the price ($14 for my meal), and the food was not fresh. Falafels were like subway's and I think they were frozen (no spice or taste at all). No silverware or glassware whatsoever; everything was disposable. We ended up paying $45 for 3 people without any drinks. He has shawerma but no gyros machine, all I saw was shredded pieces of meat that he heats up. I'm never coming back to this place."}
{"text":"Possibly the best value in the whole Urbana-Champaign area. The food is prepared on a daily basis using homegrown veggies, it is very delicious and healthy (for the most part). The 202 meal is an amazing deal and I do not understand how it could cost so little. Favorite items: 202 meal with beef or fish Dinner menu with lamb or kufta Vegetarian - Okra, Falafel, Lentil soup"}
{"text":"Alright, the owner really tries. The tea here is excellent and the falafel has improved greatly."}
{"text":"The complaints I've heard about this restaurant are numerous, ranging from bad food to the infamous Soup-Nazi-like owner.  So why did I give it so many stars?  Many people would hesitate before eating at Jerusalem Restaurant, and I can't blame them if they have been spoiled by American restaurant standards.  In defense of these kinds of restaurants everywhere, I would argue that you have to be at least a little adventurous (and patient) when it comes to eating ethnic food.    I've become a regular customer because Jerusalem Restaurant is just so STRANGE, and kind of endearing in its own way.  I know that there are limitations to excusing poor service/attitude because of cultural differences, but I have never thought of the owner as malicious or incompetent.  Every visit, one of my friends makes an attempt to get the owner to smile (I've witnessed it, and it is a truly uplifting sight).  Below, I've documented some of my observations while eating there.  I know that these are probably factors that cast the restaurant in a bad light, but personally, these are the type of experiences that have made me come to enjoy (at least for humor value) my visits to Jerusalem Restaurant.  Read on:  * I first came into Jerusalem Restaurant with friends, and we all decided to order the daily combination plate.  When we got to the counter and placed our orders, the owner just asked each of us, \"Meat or vegetable?\"  We all requested meat, assuming that we would just receive whatever he was making for the daily meat dish.  To our confusion, when we received the meals, we each had been given a different meat: lamb, fish, and chicken!  (We learned later that you can just request a specific meat.)  * I have struggled to decipher the numbering logic used at this restaurant; this is the first example.  When you look at the front counter, there are sheets of paper that show a condensed menu, just the most popular items served at lunch.  Instead of writing Combo #1, Combo #2, etc., their items are listed as #576, #708, etc. (not even in sequential order!).    * This is the second example involving weird numbers.  After you order, the owner will write a number on a piece of scrap paper and hand it to you.  This number is separate from the receipt, so it does not correspond to the price of your meal.  My friend and I thought it over, and we interpreted this as the same system employed at fast food restaurants, where your number is called when your order is ready.  When we looked, my number was 16 and my friend's was 28 (again, not sequential, even when he had ordered right after me).  Then, when our food was finished, the owner just waved at us instead of calling our numbers.  ...Huh?  * Unlike most restaurants, the owner doesn't leave unlimited boxes of napkins at the silverware station or your table.  Instead, he leaves just a few napkins (less than 10) at the front counter, so you always feel bad about taking more than necessary.  Great economic/environmental tactic...?  I'll briefly summarize a few more important points if you decide to try Jerusalem Restaurant:  (1) Order the spiced hot tea in the winter, (2) the restaurant is only open for lunch, not dinner, and (3) no matter how much you're initially intimidated by the owner, he is actually a warm person once you become familiar with him."}
{"text":"I'm new to the area and wanted to try the local middle eastern cuisine, as back home I am blessed with a nice variety of it in the southwest suburbs.  I went into the (just about empty) Jerusalem Restaurant and looked over the menu before being silently greeted by the notorious owner. I stepped up to order and he turned his back, apparently cooking someone else's food. I patiently waited and eventually ordered the daily special of kufta, salad and hummus.   After observing my meal being cooked and assembled, I dashed home to try it.  I opened up everything and was initially let down by the quantity I received for about $9.   I started with the salad which looked to be a combination of many different vegetables including onions, celery, carrots, spices and a couple of other unrecognizable things. Even though there was a large array of different ingredients for this salad, it was unbelievably bland and some of the vegetables pretty hard in consistency. I couldn't figure out why, there was some kind of a dressing on it, but it wasn't much more than some type of oil, maybe a really light olive? I'm not sure. It then occurred to me that this salad was probably sitting for a very long time before I had eaten it. I wouldn't get it again.  Next, my order came with Kufta (lamb & beef), 2 pitas and a very small dollop of hummus. The Kufta had a pretty unique flavor to it that I did like, but the quality of the meat was fair, at best. The pitas were decent but by far the best part of my dinner was the hummus. The hummus had a very nice taste and was complemented well by a splash of olive oil. It was not bland and definitely the highlight of my meal.  Overall, I was disappointed having spent almost $. The portion size wasn't much, and the starch (pita) is really what filled me up.  I will be back in sometime just to try something else and see if my review is consistent for all the food, rather than just what I had. This place has a variety of options and maybe I just picked the wrong one."}
{"text":"Chicken shwarma was ok -- the chicken was cooked remarkably well (super tender), but the seasoning was fairly bland."}
{"text":"The heart and soul of Mediterranean is falafil, which was mediocre in that place. The baba Ghanouj was very bad! It tasted bland like frank raw materials mixed together without any salt/seasoning. The guy behind the counter was a bit angry, I don't know why. I'm not coming to this place again. I hope they can read this so that they improve."}
{"text":"Great place if you're looking for healthy food. My favorite here is their okra curry and their hummus."}
{"text":"I always got the lamb dinner. The lamb was flavorful and the beans that came with rice were tasty as well. Salad was fresh and healthy. Soup was authentic. But it often takes the owner 10 min to make a meal, so I won't come in when there are more than one people waiting in front of me."}
{"text":"I always walk past this place but never thought of trying it because it looks kinda shady. It is usually pretty empty, lunch or dinner time. So, I have no clue how this place survives. One day, my friend ordered some falafel and grape leaves wrap for takeout just for the heck of it. She was a little unsure if she wanted to try them and I ended up being the scapegoat. The food wasn't fresh and my friend saw the guy reheating the food in a microwave instead of preparing them from scratch. The falafel ended up a little dry and the little leave wraps were sour. I was not sure if it was supposed to taste like that but I found it awful. Maybe I should try the shwarma instead."}
{"text":"Restaurant review Do you remember that episode in Seinfeld at the soup restaurant. I won't refer to the name given to the owner of that restaurant but this experience is very similar. You go up to the counter to order from a surly man who is cooking and running the register. He will ignore you for a few minutes and finally come over to take your order. You sit down and after a few more minutes or more he will yell your food is ready with only the bare minimum of words. Not the best customer service, but I digress. The upside is the food is inexpensive compared to chicago. There are daily specials. I ended up with the lamb dish with rice, split pea soup, and some beans. The flavors were very authentic, not too salty or spicy. I just wish the lamb was not cooked way through. For the price you pay it is good, but the food would not be acceptable restaurant quality in a big city. All said and done, I will be back if I crave Mediterranean food.  Pro: inexpensive, authentic middle eastern food  Cons: average food quality, overcooked, poor customer service, NO free refills...  Hidden gem: Daily specials are a bargain, check out my picture for the menu"}
