{"text":"Di Manno Cheese Garlic Sticks  ** (2 stars) 326 g frozen in a box, 5 sticks.  Bought from Giant Tiger I got sucked in by the picture on the box of yummy-looking cheese sticks bursting with cheese.  In reality the cheese sticks are mostly cloying bread with tiny amounts of cheese inside.  Cooked as directed, they are dry and a little hard to get down.  Won't buy again.  The store in Concord sounds interesting though."}
{"text":"This review is specifically for this gem that saved me in my new job... I recently got hired in the area, and as an event planner for all the functions we host, people told me how they have tried Italian catering places and food was not good at all!  So I had a lot of work to do to find a local spot that's great and can impress my colleagues.   I got a flyer in my mail and it looked proper, I contacted them regarding their lasagna and pasta, and they were very quick to help.   I ordered their Meat Lasagna, Vegetarian Lasagna, and Eggplant parmigiana with a chickpea salad, and pasta salad.   I ordered for 30 people, and let me tell you something, their prices are very reasonable and the food was enough for all, we even had left overs and everybody fell in love with the lasagnas and eggplant parmigiana. The salads were perfect, and the chickpea salad is great for any vegans or Vegetarians. The main meals are great for vegetarians but not vegans.  I ordered as well an assorted sandwich platter, that comes with chicken, turkey, prosciutto, and a vegetarian. They were all on focassia bread, and holy smokes this bread stayed ALL DAY FLUFFY, and not hard like these other restaurants that you go to, people were having them at the end of the day and their teeth weren't breaking like other focassia bread, and we ordered a lentil salad, and it was perfect, great for vegans too.   They also didn't take charge us delivery charge unlike subway who is actually across from us and charged us $20 delivery charge!!!  Their desserts are great, cannelloni are amazing, so are their cupcakes, and tiramisu.   Honestly for corporate catering they are great and food is clearly fresh."}
{"text":"Had lunch with co-workers here the other day. I'd say it's definitely the most pleasant casual dining experience you can get directly on the Portage strip between Jane Street and Weston Road. As long as you're not die hard on chicken wings or a submarine sandwich instead of some Italian options, this is definitely the place to choose from over the other limp options lying around.  The hours are tailored around the typical business weekday, i.e., they're open quite early in the mornings, and do breakfast and lunch, Mondays through Fridays, although the hours sometimes seem erratic - they sometimes seem to close if it's not a very busy end of the day. I had the impression they should be open over weekends but, there have been many times I have driven by, hoping to be able to stop in, but found it closed. Maybe I'm not early enough driving by on weekends ...  The food is typical Italian offerings (although you can get bagels in the morning) - you have the typical panini and pizza, and there are daily lunch specials that are better than your average hot table options. You don't just get a couple of choices of pasta - you will find options like roasted lamb and pork, and a nice selection of fresh vegetable sides and salads.  The bonus with coming to a place like this during the work day is that it's cafeteria style service, so, as long as the line-up isn't too bad, you get served quickly, and pay at the cash before you eat - no muss, no fuss with waiting on cheques, tips, etc. The space is quite roomy with lots of tables inside, AND - yay for summertime - patio tables outside the restaurant. HOWEVER, caveat to the diner - you can't have your beer (or any alcohol options) outside.  As you might expect of an Italian bakery establishment, you have plenty of great options for espresso drinks, baked dessert items, and gelato, although, I limited myself to my grilled panino for the lunch. Speaking of which, it was a grilled giardino (veggie) and goat cheese sandwich, and it was great! The vegetables (eggplant, red bell pepper, zucchini) were well cooked but not soggy, the slices were a good thickness, and the goat cheese was tangy and fresh tasting. The bread, no surprise that it was tender crispy with a fluffy inside - you can't expect less from any bakery worth its salt! Speaking of bread again, when you take your meal from the cash, you can pick up your choice of white or whole wheat buns and butter to go with the cutlery for your meal. That does mean that you do have to collect a glass and water yourself as well, no table service whatsoever, but, this is very conducive to the business breakfast/lunch setup of the restaurant. You aren't expected to bus your table yourself, either. The staff do clear the tables quickly because of the high volume, so that is perfect for the setup.  I'm glad this is a lot closer to where I need to be during the workday than say, the Panera over in the Colossus plaza, because I'd choose this over that anytime. The value for the money is a lot better, and the atmosphere is a lot warmer, fresher and livelier in comparison.  Definitely my go-to place for the area. No reason I had not to give 5 stars - I usually reserve that for something above and beyond that distinguishes a business but in this case, it's definitely because it's so obviously better than all the other options in the area. They've reached out to new business customers in the new subway centre with flyers and coupons, whereas all the other business sitting around here do nothing to promote themselves, or offer a good customer experience. This place shines like a gem in comparison."}
{"text":"Hubby came home last night with lovely takeout lasagne, vegetables & potato salad and we both enjoyed the heck out of it.  Extremely reasonably priced, too!  Fantastic dinner for 2 for $17.96!"}
{"text":"Love this place. A staple lunch spot in my office. It's always busy, and always good.  Everything they serve is delicious, the hot deli, pastas, salads are all great. I recommend for a quick, and very tasty lunch. They also serve espresso and gelato."}
{"text":"I can't think of any reason not to give this place five stars...it's never disappointed me. Since they seem to consistently serve fresh, flavourful and quality Italian entr√©es, pizza and sandwiches along with good and attentive service, I'd say that is the type of establishment that deserves five yelp stars.   I would recommend visiting for low key quick lunches (take into consideration that weekdays are loud & busy), take out or catering. I was really impressed with the breakfast basket and grilled meat and veggie sandwiches that were prepared and brought to us in time for our clients to enjoy throughout meetings. The catering pricing was quite affordable and competitive and the ordering process was headache-free all the way through. Thank you, Di Manno ladies :)  Side notes: Cannolis are filled upon order so they stay fresh (I could watch that all day lol, mmm). As far as favourite meals, I would recommend the pizza or the grilled paninis."}
{"text":"Accidentally drove past.. But coming in was NO accident! (cheesy)  Latte was terrific, almost went right back in for 2nd. Had a great slice of pizza.  Helpful and friendly staff. I'll be back next Saturday!"}
{"text":"Excellent italian restaurant with lovely staff who make you feel at home. Fresh bread, coffee, great atmosphere, good food - what else do you want?  I haven't tried too many lunch or other items but will do so soon."}
{"text":"Great bakery place for drinking a coffee and having sone good sweets. Cheesecake was a great hit and latte was amazing"}
{"text":"A decent sized bakery serving coffee, lunch and baked goods. It does get pretty packed, both inside and out, around lunch time so time your arrival or mentally prepare your order in advance! The cannolis were filled to order which means they are fresh and crunchy, the coffee was very mediocre though. The pasta with meatballs was amazing, some of the best pasta sauce I've had so zero complaints there."}
