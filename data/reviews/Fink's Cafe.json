{"text":"Really good food.  Excellent Cole slaw.  I'd give it 4 stars too but sometimes the regulars do ruin it for the place"}
{"text":"Breakfast there and it was horrible and terribly overpriced  Ordered biscuits and gravy and got dinner roll cut in half and was so hard it could serve as a NATO bullet...."}
{"text":"Old school, small town restaurant with big and classic flavors.

Stopped in for lunch.  The ambiance is cosy, wood paneling, simple table layout, and your grandpa might still be there from breakfast.  Owner greeted us immediately and seated us right away.  No kids menu's but said she would accommodate my little guests as needed. 
We ordered the french toast with all of the meaty fixin's and a blue cheese burger on special.  
French toast was delicious and cooked to perfection.  Powdered sugar, couple of blueberries on the side.  My little people were set with this, the bacon and sausage patties.  
Burger was cooked perfectly as requested at medium.  Bun was a beautiful kaiser with cornmeal crust.  Blue cheese had the perfect tangy zip I love.  Coleslaw was hand made. The little people thought it tasted like it had whipped cream in it... as long as they are eating foods with veggies in it, it's all good.  Crunchy french fries. 
Service was great, food was great, we will be back.

** As I passed by this evening, the place was packed for Fish Fry on Friday Night. Note to try it out! ****"}
{"text":"Quick and friendly service in this hometown diner. Decent prices too. Food was good with some interesting combinations. I had the Irishman's skillet, the sauerkraut was a welcome touch against the corned beef and swiss cheese, though the hash browns could have used a bit more time on the griddle to get them crispy. I would go back and order it again though."}
{"text":"Went in and sat down, was greeted by a really nice waitress and the menu looked great....sadly, within five minutes a group of five daily regulars were yelling and swearing so loudly that I couldn't enjoy just sitting even though I was as far across the restaurant as possible. After five more minutes of cursing I canceled my order and left. Too bad too because the coffee was excellent and the food looks good.  Such a nice sweet little caf√© but until those regulars can learn how to behave in public I'm never going back there again."}
{"text":"My new breakfast place, the new owners have great energy & have done a nice job w/ the space! Classic American diner, they've even added a Fish fry on Fridays!!"}
{"text":"A non-tourist place on Main Street. Offers a breakfast or lunch menu for lunch. Had a very good BLT with fries for lunch. The fries very extra crispy. I have never had fries like this. They were very good."}
{"text":"A pretty good little breakfast and lunch diner. Some mornings it can be a little crowded and there may be a wait but it's certainly not too long. 

The food is standard American \"diner\" fare. My only complaint is that everything seems to be cooked in butter."}
{"text":"Very small inside, but big plate of food for price.  I had Tuscan chicken sandwich and will say best sandwich I've ever had.  Friendly staff!"}
{"text":"This place has really turned itself around. The food is good, now serves breakfast and lunch and Friday fish. The main problem is quite honestly, the regulars. We live in town and I'm embarrassed to have our kids in there some mornings. Loud, rude, dropping F bombs. And these are grown men! I would go way more often if they cleaned up their act."}
{"text":"Tried this cafe just because the small amount of people waiting outside peeked my interest. It was breakfast and I ordered the corned beef hash. A must try if you typically like it! The coffee was fresh tasting and service was alright. I'd return if I were local and give it another try."}
{"text":"If I gave it 4 stars it'd be because every time I've been here it's been after a couple of hours on the bike trail, and everything tastes good after that!  Classic American diner-fare, breakfast served all day (they close @ 2:00 pm).  Friendly staff, crispy hashbrowns, pancakes for the kids-- what more could you want?"}
{"text":"A little place to call home. Small but great food.. I had the fink burger.. well I am into burgers.. I loved it. Will come again.."}
{"text":"Excellent place.small, cozy snd quaint. you get greeted as you come in but get to choose your own seat. The ambiance is excellent. the food delicious. home cooking type menu. meat is fresh. Best place in Town"}
{"text":"Very nice local breakfast-lunch spot. Unpretentious and comfortable, with good service and fresh, filling food. The omellettes are terrific. The Baja Burger is good too. Fries aren't great."}
