{"text":"I don't normally review coffee shops, but this one is stellar! I walked by on my way to work, and popped in because I was charmed by Juliet B's review. I've been to Blenz in Vancouver a few times and haven't honestly been too impressed, but I thought I'd give this one a shot to mix it up. I was super pleasantly surprised! The staff was very nice and friendly, which is always a good first impression! They were sampling a Chai Spiced Apple Cider which was so, so, so tasty. I am going to make a point of going back and ordering one next time I'm there. I got a London Fog and it was great. They steep the tea while they're frothing the milk, so there's no tea bag in your latte. I'm a big fan of that system because I usually find my London Fogs oversteeped by the time I finish them, but there's no risk of that happening with the way they make them here."}
{"text":"This location is closed. No advance notice. So glad they scammed me on over 100 dollars in gift cards. Called the number on the sign and was told that I could use the gift cards in Vancouver. No. I want to use them here. Glad they are gone if this is the kind of business practices they have."}
{"text":"Very nice staff and the drinks are awesome. We stopped in for. Warm up drink. I got a chai latte and my husband an ice latte and both of us are very happy with our choice"}
{"text":"Blenz opened today! It was the cutest lil cafe opening. The whole team was excited and ready to go and the owner, Bo, welcomed people off the street for free drinks all afternoon. They gave away a lot of gift certificates and balloons were everywhere. I ordered a matcha latte and they mixed up real matcha with a bamboo whisk and blended it perfectly. As the name suggests. I'll definitely be back.  Welcome to the neighbourhood!"}
