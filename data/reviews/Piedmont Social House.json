{"text":"Came here on opening weekend and have been back several times and customer service still has not improved. Although Strike City or Park Lanes is more expensive I believe the experience as a whole is better."}
{"text":"Visiting from California- this place is amazing - food was incredible - first timer with the chicken and waffles....won't be the last...a great time was had by all."}
{"text":"Went here on a Thursday evening to enjoy drinks with a couple of friends. It was my first time here so of course I want to check the entire place out to see what all they had to offer. This was very difficult to do considering every corner I turned there was another employee asking me if I was part of \"the party\". Every part of the place was reserved expect the outside bar. Sorry but I find this very annoying, we came to play games an hang out but was unable to do so due to the ENTIRE place being reserved! I think they should have at least posted a sign on the front door warning customers that they were booked for the evening. Due to this very bad first experience I will probably never go back."}
{"text":"I am giving PSH a poor review because of the food. The first time I went to PSH it was so crowded we went across the street and ate at Portofinos which is always amazing. Tonight however when I invited eight of my friends to go to PSH and have dinner and games our experience was horrible. When we got there we were set right away as there were plenty of open tables. We ordered drinks which were great. Then we ordered food and we waited at least 40 minutes for the food to come out. The waiter came out before the food came out saying they were slammed and our food would be put in a bit. Ok they'd fine. The problem was when the food came out I took one look at it and it was all dried up and I took a bite and it was cold like room temperature it looked and tasted like it had been sitting I the back for 30 minutes. Our entire table had to send our orders back because they were cold. Mind I'm not the type of person to do this typically if the foods a little cold I'll suffer through but this was beyond acceptable. Then when they finally brought our orders back out by burger was burnt to a crisp it was dry and crumbly and tasted like grocery store frozen burger. I think it may have been the worst burger I've ever eaten and that's saying a lot because I'm not picky. I only ate  a portion of my food and my other friend who also got a burger said the same thing and barley touched her food. One of my friends who got the loaded fries was without ranch which was supposed to cone with the fries and which he asked for multiple times. He was done with his meal practically by the time they brought it out. We all thought they with how horrible or experience was that they would offer a discount or something but nothing was offered. 

As far as the bowling, bar and ambience it's great but the food is a no go. I will not be eating there again. Also they should invest in some more games they tend to all be being used leaving a lot of people standing around waiting for other groups to finish."}
{"text":"Really fun environment. Love their patio and the games. Good and drinks are so so for the price."}
{"text":"We have lived in the Arysley neighborhood for over 6-years and have been waiting for something like this to finally show up.
We went for the first time last night, simply to grab a dinner, drinks, and check it out.  I have to say, it's impressive!
Much on the lines of Park Lanes off Montford, but Piedmont Social House offers even more.
Aside from the food and drinks being creative and good(there is a whole menu of boiler makers), the large bowling alley, there are also several areas with pool tables, shuffle board, and old school video games.
The clientale is decent too. No crazy drunks or riff raff which makes it family friendly in my opinion.
I can see us planning a group outing with several couples and/or kids to take advantage of this great new venue right in our backyard!"}
{"text":"Much needed social hangout in Steele Creek ...Great food! Excellent drink selection.  Great option for lunch dinner or late night!"}
{"text":"I went on Tuesday night, not realizing that it had opened the day before. We were looking for something else but decided to try it out.  There were people outside having a good time, but we didnt realize there would be a bowling alley in the place!!

The food was pretty good, I got a chicken wrap with pimento cheese (unfortunately can't remember the name of it) and a side of mac and cheese (which was a sub from the fries that were supposed to accompany the dish).  Our waiter was very friendly, the food was really good! (My friend had the spinach as a side, and it was seasoned pretty good!).  The drinks looked good, but we didnt try them this time. 

We will definitely be going back! Its nice to have a place like this closer to where i live, as opposed to having to travel all the way to uptown or Dilworth for something like this.  Would recommend, but not if you like quiet!!"}
{"text":"Living in Ayrsley we were excited this spot opened. We have been here on multiple occasions and each time has been worse than the time before. We just walked in on Friday night they are not busy. We sat at the inside bar and multiple members of the staff walked by us and it took ten minutes for somebody to stop and give us a menu. Then, we sat for another ten minutes again, staff walking around and nobody stopped again to take our order. We got up and left. As we walked to our car all members of the bar staff were outside talking to each other. Other people left as well complaining of poor service."}
{"text":"HORRENDOUS CUSTOMER SERVICE! We were just at PSH enjoying ourselves watching the game with friends and our kids. We were upstairs and right in the middle of food, drinks and the game and were told to \"wrap it up and go because they were setting up for someone else.\" They also told the group next to us. We were told sorry and they tried to offer us a free bowling pass when we came back. Needless to say, I told the manager we wouldn't be back. Do not go to this place that does not value every customer. Absolutely the worst lack of customer service I've ever experienced! I don't even want to give one star."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good. But seriously watch your check. Ours showed $40 (food) plus $36(drinks) =79 subtotal with no explanation. When asking waiter...he went to check, came back & said \"oh the sides you chose had an up charge\" then we asked to see the menu again since we couldn't believe we didn't notice that. But when he brought the menu, he said \"I'm sorry it's not printed here, but IT IS an up charge\" we then asked for the manager & instead the waiter came back, threw the corrected check on the table & walked away.  It wasn't about the few dollars, but more about honest business practice. You can't simply add $3 to someone's tab without any explanation or choice up front. Also btw, this happened to 3 people at our table of 8. Hmmmmm"}
{"text":"Great place to eat, hangout and drink beer!! Joe our waiter was awsome!! Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Drink prices are OK. 2.50$ certain bottles everyday.  Got a chicken sandwich and app of ber cheese dip. The pretzles served with dip were good.  The dip tasted like just beer and little cheese. The chicken sandwich was large and cooked well. However it was advertised to come with siracha ranch and pickle. Sadly both of those were missing and had to be requested. The sweet potato fries were good, that is the ones that were actually cooked. It is still new so some kinks but its gotta get better. I say skip food stick to the bowling and drinks."}
{"text":"Chicken and waffles!!

I checked out Piedmont Social house with a friend on the Sunday before Labor Day.  We walked through and checked out the bar, bowling alleys, pool tables, foosball, and the arcade corner with Mortal Kombat and Galaga!! There were lounge areas, and plenty of space upstairs to chill or engage in games. But the weather was perfect so we ate outside. High top and low top tables were available in a fully covered outside dining spice. Flat screens lined the wall of the building, and the outside bar had plenty of local brews on tap, along with the usual buds, millers, and Belgian wheats. 

Good service. Fun atmosphere !! And the chicken and waffles were surprisingly good for a spot that I would classify as a bar style game room.  

I'll definitely be returning for some bowling with friends in the near future !!"}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting PSH, but I had heard good things about it. Well that it was a cool place and the atmosphere was good at least. 

I booked a bowling lane for a late birthday outing last Saturday night. It was a little pricey, but overall not too bad. A few hours before the party was supposed to begin, I got a call from one of the staff members requesting that we push back the time of our event due to a request from a performer that was performing that night. This was perfectly fine and we had no hesitation to agree to this. 

When we arrived, we spoke to the person that booked the reservation for us and things were fine right off the bat. We spoke to the girl that said she would be our server and taking care of up on our bowling lane. We grabbed a drink from the bar and went upstairs to watch the performance. After that, we went directly to our lane to begin bowling. 

We realized that our server was nowhere to be found at this point and waited around for a bit to see if anyone would come over and help up. After about 20-30 minutes of bowling with no service, and trying to get a drink at the bar with no service, I finally went to talk to a manager to see if we could get some help. The girl finally came over to take our order.

We ordered a round of drinks, an appetizer and food for the 7 of us. The appetizer came out pretty quickly, but still no drinks. Then the food came out about 15 minutes later, but still no drinks. We tried to ask a couple people for napkins and silverware, but did not receive these either. I ended up having to go into the bathroom to get paper towels for us to wipe our hands on. Finally, half way into our meal, our drinks arrived. Well some of our drinks arrived, because they were out of one of the beers we requested for a bucket. 

The service was ok after this, and the girl would come around about every 20 minutes or so to see if we needed anything. We finally realized that she was also waiting on the party of the performer at the same time, and that our party was kind of put on the back burner for this other party. 

After our 2 hours of bowling ended, we decided to close out our checks. I stopped the server as she was walking by once to see if we could get our checks. I told her exactly what should be on the checks and went back to the lane to wait for them. After about 10-15 minutes, she came over to the lane and asked how we wanted the checks split, even though I had already told her. We told her exactly how they should be split again. We then waited and waited. After a legitimate 40 minutes, I decided to ask to speak to a manager. I told him what was going on and that we just wanted to get our checks and leave. He said that he would get them over to us as soon as he could. We waited another 10 minutes or so and he came over to our lane, but still did not have the checks. He asked what was going on and I told him what had happened over the course of the time that we had been there. He offered no help and pretty much told us that the checks took so long because they were trying to figure something out in the computer.

The server finally brought the checks over as we were speaking to the manager. We all put our credit cards in the slips and waited for her to pick them up. Another 10-15 minutes went by and she finally came back around to get them. Overall, it took us at least an hour to tab out once our lane was closed. 

I am not one to complain or write a review about a restaurant because I was a server for most of my life, and I understand what it entails. This was different. This was just a blatant disregard for our party due to another more important party of a performer that was there. The manager that was on duty was also not helpful and did not provide a solution at all when told of what happened. I think that this place has the potential to be really great and a fun place to hang out, but it is run very poorly. I do not plan to return or recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Asked to leave and offered a \"to go\" order as members of my party were under the age of 21 ... So can't eat or bowl if under 21 on a Friday / Saturday ... Got it ! Great policy ... So I suppose none of the members of our alumni association who have families... Hence people under 21 should not meet here for alum events and watch parties as well ... Got it ... Great policy"}
{"text":"Great spot to watch the game and have fun! Cool spot and amazing ambiance but the food is ok. It's not freshly made and just average. We ordered the chicken nachos, wings, and loaded fries. The chicken nachos tasted like pulled pork and wings were frozen. Would definitely come back to watch a game or have a fun night with group of friends but definitely not for the food."}
{"text":"Great concept! I had a really good time at the PSH with a group of friends. Lots of TVs, comfortable seating and the games; yes, lots of fun games! Ping-pong, pool, bowling, and board games. This is a great venue for people who want to do more than just sit and drink. Perfect for watching any sports. Lots of TVs. The food came out very quick and was good. Not overly impressed with the outside bartender. My first beer she added a $1 to the total price, which I did not realize until I saw the drink menu and the prices later on. I guess she figured she would just include her tip herself. My food tab was $15.70;  I gave her a twenty and she rounded up and only gave me $4. back. It may have only been .30 cents, but that was not her decision to make on keeping my money. As a former server, I always overtip. However, I also really resent the servers who ruin it for the good ones! Unacceptable staff can ruin an establishment and its reputation. I hope that is not the case with Piedmont Social House because it is a really cool place to hang out!  Check it out with friends. You will have fun!"}
{"text":"Just went there today to go bowling with a few friends and it was a pretty great experience. Very friendly staff, even though they made us dispose of outside drinks that we had brought in. Although very understable, in fact after walking over to the bar to get a coke I was told that it was on the house anyways.

Not to mention that the bowling games were only a dollar durin the time that I was there, so only $30 for about 3 hours of fun. Have to say it won't be my last time visiting there and might even try out some of their pool tables as well as their food next time."}
{"text":"A friend of mine invited me as her +1 to a Yelp Elite event to check out PSH. I am glad I decided to take her up on the offer because I had a great time. The place reminds me of a mix between Strike City, Duckworths, and VBGB. There are several areas with pool tables, ping pong, and several bowling lanes, and conversation areas. 

There is a full menu which we got to sample, the best dish being the chicken and waffle with maple butter. The inside bar area had several large tables and high tops and there was also a large area upstairs with conversation areas as well as  flat screens, additional pool and ping pong tabes.

We also got to sample a drink, called the ice pick, which was probably the only negative thing I can say about the place cuz it was very watered down and weak. :-( and when I say something is weak it's pretty bad cuz I am a lightweight.

hopefully this is not the quality of drink served in a normal setting or their bartender may need to be a little less stingy with the good stuff.

There was a good mix of people which I love and sometimes find it rare to have such a diverse crowd of people in social settings in Charlotte. This place is welcoming to all with pretty good food and a place to converse and have a good time.

Did I mention they have a cool outdoor bar space with  pretty ample seating and cornhole.. I will definitely be back soon. It's a unique venue for Charlotte and glad to see place like this open for something a little different."}
{"text":"Had a great time here for my husband's birthday dinner. The food was great and the staff was helpful. I would like to especially give a nod to Christa for her fantastic customer service and welcoming personality! We will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"In town on business staying in a nearby hotel and went here for drinks and dinner based on a recommendation from a co-worker. The service was friendly although a bit slow but the food and drinks were both mediocre, really not very good at all to be completely honest. 

Drinks are small and have a microscopic amount of alcohol in them. The food was, in my opinion, likely frozen and reheated rather than prepared from scratch. The burger tasted like a Bubba burger and the mac and cheese tasted like it came out of a box with a Kraft label on it.

Two stars are for the decent service and modern-ish atmosphere and amenities but I would not consider ever going back unless I knew the food had been completely changed."}
{"text":"Horrible treatment. For the second time in six months  I have been told their outdoor seating is full. Both times there were about 10+ empty tables. So insulting, and such a shame as I loved this place but I will not come back and will advise the same to all my coworkers. We work less than a mile away and used to come here."}
{"text":"Great place to take friends or coworkers and let off steam.  It has a little bit of everything you want to do socially in one spot.  I would say they could use a few more employees to expedite the games area."}
{"text":"We went on a weekday so it was nice and quiet! Had the loaded fries which were delicious! 
FYI...They usually have specials during the week or early in the day!"}
{"text":"AVOID AT ALL COSTS. 

Came tonight to the absolute worst customer service I have ever experienced. I left without sipping my water. My I stayed here 0:07 too long, and I regret not getting our server's name. We were a party of 7.  My date and I had come in a few minutes after the other 5 having had trouble finding parking.  We were not acknowledged upon arrival, and no hostess was to be found. After standing around uncomfortably for about 0:04, a nice group of folks, whom had been waiting for the elusive server to return to their table, offered theirs that was adjacent to ours.  Our party had been previously seated, but for whatever reason, shorted our table by two chairs. We were grateful to have been offered the recently used table. 

We pushed the table and chairs together, waited about three minutes, and with no greeting, the waitress comes to the table to ask \"who is new?\" Our party found this odd, but we answered the question. This was now the time to give our drink orders. The EXTREMELY limited menu for late night (it was 20:30) was ridiculously overpriced. 13:00 for chicken wings that don't even come with sides? Please. 

I'm getting frustrated even replaying the night in my head, trying to relay what happened tonight. Long story short, she scolded us for pushing the tables together, asked if we had gotten permission from the non-existent hostess, and neglected to get the table cleaned off before she brought us our waters. She was visibly and audibly frustrated when we asked questions about the menu. The last straw for us was when we asked if she could get someone to clean off the table. She rolled her eyes at us, said \"sure\", and stomped off. We made the executive decision that our hard earned money would not be spent at this establishment. 

When we brought the matter to the attention of mgmt, they were just as helpful and friendly. They questioned why we thought this was \"bad customer service\" and noted that they would have a talk with her. The \"bouncers\" who constantly told us we had to clear the way as we were waiting to speak with mgmt were a joke too. 

Not worth the frustration. We were served our drinks in dirty glassware, no host to be found for proper seating, and customer service was completely absent. Would have given a zero if I could. Never again."}
{"text":"I've been to PSH three times. Visit one was during the opening week for dinner: Food was amazing and the service was fast and friendly. In fact, it was such a great visit, that I started telling my friends and coworkers about it. Visit two was during lunch a week later: The food was still good, but it was missing the special sauces (we had ordered them on the side) for at least 3 orders in our party. Also, service was rather slow and we did go over our usual one hour lunch time. I was a little disappointed then. Visit three was this week for dinner with a group of out-of-town coworkers. It took 15 minutes for us to get noticed in the bar area; it was completely understaffed, yet there were people with PSH shirts everywhere! The waiter was very friendly when he was finally able to take our drink orders, but it probably took a good 20 minutes for drinks to arrive and our water took another 15. We ordered dinner then. The food was delicious, but the whole dinner took 2 hours! To be honest, I felt embarrassed for recommending PSH to my coworkers!"}
{"text":"Nice establishment I've been a number of times! A little disappointed that the menu changes after a certain hour! A friend and mine went to eat after an outing were ready for the main menu but got the after hours menu .. It was only 8:30 :( ! Other than that I recommend this place all the time"}
{"text":"Great food, great drinks and Ivan is da best!
PSH is part me my coworkers Friday ritual. :)"}
{"text":"Once they get better staffing and learn how to operate a business with a larger crowd I think they will be okay. Need to come down on the prices for bowling."}
{"text":"The food is great, I've never had anything bad here. The sweet potato waffle fries are AMAZING! My favorite! Was a bit turned off by the hostess who seemed annoyed that I didn't want to sit at the bar, or a barstool, as the chairs aren't comfortable. I wasn't asking for much, just that I sit at a low table. She may not have realized that I could hear her sigh, or see her roll her eyes."}
{"text":"It is really cool to have something like this in southwest Charlotte.

The décor is very cool, but comfortable, which is rare. You won't run into good looking furniture that is not comfortable to sit on for some time like other places. 

I cannot believe the fit 12 bowling lanes in that space without making it feel tight.

I think I counted at least 4 pool tables.

The local beer selection is awesome the signature cocktail we ordered came in a  what looked like as small old school milk jar (nice touch).

The shuffleboard table is sweet.

The old school video games are a really nice touch.

The COVERED patio is huge and rare,it has its own dedicated bar with a ton of taps. 

There is a lot there were able to fit into the space without is feeling tight at all.
I enjoyed the food a great deal, the sweet potato waffle fry app was very good and the tenders were very good, not run of the mill bar tenders. The \"Awesome\" sauce is amazing.

Last thing of note, I sat at one bar, opened a tab, it was accessible elsewhere which is really nice. There was not need to close out one place and then reopen just because you moved from one place to another. I understand why other places need to do this, but was just nice not to have to do so."}
{"text":"How disappointing! My four friends and I tried out this establishment on Saturday, March 3rd, 2018 around 7pm. The drinks were watered down, we were told we had to wait 15-20 minutes to place an order (supposedly so our orders wouldn't get lost in the system, because it was so busy), and to top it off - my food came out 20 minutes later than the rest of my friends. I still tipped the waitress even though I felt the management and experience was horrid that night. He didn't even offer to comp or reduce the cost of my meal. I won't be back again."}
{"text":"Horrible first time experience. Ordered a flat bread which was not cooked through and raw. It took 30 minutes to track down our waiter to have it exchanged for something else. They never checked on us again. Took another 20 minutes to get refills and we finally asked the hostess to bring us our drinks.   The waiter was missing in action... our check was finally given to us again by the hostess after waiting and waiting for the waiter to show.  The only bonus was the cocktails were delish.  As for service and food quality, don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Great beer and wonderful atmosphere! My boyfriend and I had a blast playing ping pong, pool, foozeball, and shuffle board which only cost about 2 dollars or less for a game which was nice. I'll definitely be back! I usually go to Saffron right next door for food and then go here for drinks and games!"}
{"text":"90 minute wait when there's 8+ tables available? I don't understand this. I've been to PSH several times in the past, and the level of quality and service continue to diminish. It's a shams"}
{"text":"Honestly, from the outside I didn't know what to expect, if anything it just looked like another sport's bar. Walking inside, you're greeted by a bowling alley and a view of the dining and upstairs areas. Walking around, you'll find rooms full of pool tables, a ping pong area, and several arcade machines upstairs, as well as two bars in the front and back. My friend and I sat down to eat, and we were pleasantly surprised by the choice menu selections and very quick service! I definitely plan on bringing a bigger group during my next visit!"}
{"text":"Hands down the worst service I have ever received. The bar staff was not nearly as adept as they should have been for a Friday night. The bar was really not crowded. They barely brought our party drinks n didn't bring napkins never mind silverware with our food. As cool as the place seems on the surface by way of bowling and games it's not worth wasting your time. Don't go here unless you want the worst service you have ever got in your life. No joke."}
{"text":"Out of socks to buy for bowling at 8pm on a hot summer night  - ewwwwww! I didnt know I was bowling Tonight"}
{"text":"Very good chicken and waffles! Mac and cheese wasn't my favorite but otherwise going back. Watermelon mojito was top notch."}
{"text":"The bartender needs training. The tap ran out and she gave us 1/2 a beer & charged for a full one. Customer service not their strength for a the cost of the place."}
{"text":"I think it stinks that we went to play all the games offered and turned out there were private parties going on.  The web site SHOULD have that kind of info on it.  The only bar open was outside, there is cornhole boards buts they are Community boards around Ayrsley and can not bring your drink or food out to where they are.  2nd time coming here and honestly, I will never go back.  Great concept but execution by ownership is horrible"}
{"text":"Nice place with decent food but horrible customer service. Had a night out for bowling and dinner planned on a random weekday night. We checked the website and social media before to make sure the social house has open. We showed up to find that PSA was completely reserved by several random companies. This place decided to rent out all of their facilities to several companies and didn't bother putting this info on any social media or their website. The only post on social media was a post advertising their heated patio and even that was booked!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here today. The barbecue was dry, mac & cheese was just like the orange stuff you make from a box. My husband got the truffle fries, which were supposed to come with aioli and they did not. When he asked for aioli, the server said \"they put it on the fries and it dries while cooking\". He apparently does not know what aioli is.  

This was the 3rd or 4th time we've been to the Social House, and each time is disappointing. We thought we'd give it another shot but this time was our last."}
{"text":"Ok. Great concept just lacks in service. Food was good. Order the wings with awesome sauce! Truly amazing! Recommend coming during the summer months to enjoy the outside patio."}
{"text":"It's a very nice space but the waitstaff is subpar. They are much more interested in themselves than the customer. It's such a nice bar I wish they were more attentive. Be prepared to have to get their attention for anything."}
{"text":"Casual atmosphere, good food, and a great place for a corporate or holiday event! Must See!"}
{"text":"Appetizers are all good for the money, and pretty fun place to go when it's not too crowded. Definitely make a reservation if you're not cool drinking or eating while waiting for bowling."}
{"text":"Go for the games & beer but skip the dinner food. Ate dinner inside first then bowled. Only gave it a 2 b/c I enjoyed the bowling & beer but the food was not good."}
{"text":"I went here for a work Holiday Party. They catered the food that was there as well. It was delicious and my favorite drink was the Cinnamon Toast Crunch shot!"}
{"text":"PSH deserves an update! I attended a few more happy hours and have been nothing but pleased with the service and food! 

But I was especially blown away by their level of service and detail for an event we recently had for my work department. Everyone we worked with was responsive, and kind. The day of the event they introduced themselves, checked to make sure we were okay and took care of our entire party! 

Hands down...I'm recommending this place for another event! If you're looking for something new and fun for an offsite event this is the place!"}
{"text":"The food was just okay. The atmosphere was fun and exciting. They need better drink prices and to change the menu or cooking style. The main level for eating with a large group isn't the best it's right. I suggest eating upstairs or before you come. If you've been drinking then you can tolerate the food. I'm just not a fan after eating for lunch and a few other times with friends."}
{"text":"I had to bring my husband back here after I visited with the other Elites for their Sneak Peak night. I knew he would love the Foosball, ping pong, and shuffleboard, but most importantly he would love the Mortal Kombat 2 on the og arcade upstairs. 

When we went the change machine wasn't working, and as an FYI the arcade games are $.50. We went downstairs to get some change and to grab a drink and something to eat since I couldn't stop talking about how good the chicken and waffles are and how he should try the chicken and waffles.

Something else to keep in mind is that the bar closest to the front door has a full menu, while the bar in the back does not. The bartender said that is what they are doing for the first month they are open, so it shouldn't be too much longer. 

I got the OMB Hornet's Nest for $4 on draft and the chicken and waffles appetizer for $7. They have it as a meal, but it comes with 2 sides, and just seemed like a lot of food, and I don't think waffles reheat.... Anyways my husband ordered a lager (can't remember which) his was $5, and a burger (because of course he didn't get the chicken and waffles) which was $10/$11 I think.

My food came out first and was delicious. I subbed the moonshine apple butter for the maple honey mustard and was very glad I did. The waffle was perfect and so was the chicken. I definitely ate all of it, and again was glad I only got the appetizer. My husband said his burger was also really good and that he was surprised at how good my chicken and waffles were (although I said they were). We ended up getting quarters and going up to battle each other in Mortal Kombat, where I ended up losing 2-1. We then played Ninja Turtles and were promptly out of quarters, so we had to say goodbye and until we meet again. 

By the way ping pong is free."}
{"text":"We had a bad experience the last 3 times we went. Bad service, bad food, bad overall time had by all. We decided to give it another try a year later, and wow! They fixed their mistakes! The service was great, manager was awesome and the food was great! We'll certainly go back without hesitation now!"}
{"text":"Recently moved to the area and I'm so grateful that this place exists! Great hang out place in the Steele Creek area. We always have fun when we come out here. Wish they had a larger food menu and better drink specials but overall a cool place."}
{"text":"I'm not quite sure how to describe this place - it's built to be a playhouse for adults with pool tables, bowling alleys, games, bars, two floors, etc. It is huge! It was pretty dead on a Saturday night, and I found the food and drink to be just average. You order your food/apps at the bar and take a number and they bring the food to you, which is nice. The Classic Burger was just ok, nothing special. Prices are reasonable. I'm not sure why it seemed so \"off\" when I went, but I think it has potential to be great with a large group of friends, or if you're looking for one place with lots of options where you can play board/arcade games, pool, ping pong and/or bowl, and even better, eat and drink while you do it. They are open late night, until 2 am on the weekends"}
{"text":"Dinner on the patio which is ok but surrounded by roads and parking lots. No ambience.  Server was very sweet but slow. Menu is all bar type food. My pizza was luke warm on hard focaccia toast. The server did discount it but I still had to eat it.  I won't go back."}
{"text":"I have to say, I am extremely disappointed in my visit this past Friday to PSH. I was there two weeks ago for the Yelp Elite event during their grand opening week, and everything was absolutely amazing. There was over 80 people in the Yelp group, and the food was still cooked perfectly and came out pipping hot despite the craziness. After having such a great first experience, I've been telling my family how awesome this place is and talking it up as if I was on PSH's payroll. After our experience this weekend, my in-laws may have serious doubts in my restaurant/social event decision making.

We got there about 8:15 on Friday night, it was busy, but nothing crazy. The 6 of us were able to get a table on the patio with no wait. Our server (Tilah) was very friendly, but almost seemed like this was her first serving job. After about a 10 minute wait, she finally came over and we were ready to put our drink orders in ASAP. Now, I understand that PSH is new and wants to make sure everything is done by the book, but my mother-in-law had lost her driver's license, and Tilah would not take her glass of wine order without an ID. Mind you, she's 60 years old, CLEARLY well over the \"if you look under 30, we ID\" policy most restaurants follow. Ridiculous if you ask me. The server took our 5 beer orders while my MIL searched for her id, and came back with the beers 15 minutes later. Another 15 minutes after that, the wine finally came out. 

Luckily the food came out pretty fast ... much faster than the beers & wine did. Unfortunately, none of the food wowed any of my visitors. My chicken & waffle (which was AMAZING the first time I had it here two weeks ago) was awful. The waffle itself was great, and the sauce was just as I remembered, but the chicken tenders served on it were almost burnt to a crisp. In the 10 minutes between uploading a picture and writing this review, a fellow Yelper already commented on it with \"how did they even let that leave the kitchen?!\". My father-in-law ordered the Veggie Patch Wrap, which he said was very little veggies and all wrap. My mother-in-law ordered the Winner Winner Chicken Dinner, and her chicken was as burnt/crispy as mine was. My wife's PSH Signature sandwich was also extremely crispy, albeit not as rough as mine was. My other two in my group also got the PSH chicken, and neither was impressed. 

Again, I think I'm the most upset because I know how good the food was the first time I was here, so this was just a total let down, especially with having brought my in-laws from out of state here. I'd love to give this place another try and write this off as them having a bad night, but everything about this visit was just bad."}
{"text":"My experience at the Piedmont Social was amazing. The staff were very  accommodating and friendly. I would recommend this place to others. A good social spot to hang out play games, meet and greet and let loose. Thank you guys for an amazing time. See you soon"}
{"text":"3rd time in all with kids.  It took about 8-10 mins to be approached.  The bartender came over and was extremely nice but he was obviously perturbed at the wait staff for not coming over.   

I most likely won't come back because the service staff looked pissy and it's always been a slow wait.  The Food is delicious the two times I've had it prior.  The service just stinks except the hard working bartender."}
{"text":"Awesome place! They have games for all ages and spend real tasty drinks! Strongly suggest!!"}
{"text":"We ate at Piedmont Social House last night. The service was absolutely terrible. The drinks from the bar took forever to make (as the female bartender was too busy joking with other patrons to make drinks) and then we watched the made drinks sit there and get watered down as the waitress was no where to be found to bring them to us from the bar. I ordered a salad and she forgot the dressing and again was missing to ask her for it and had to flag down another worker. The only plus was the food tasted good. They didn't seem busy but our server had us outside and apparently tables inside which seems like poor planning.  Disappointed as this place used to be spot on."}
{"text":"Me and some friends went on a Friday night to celebrate a birthday.

For those under 21, it is 21+ after 8pm!
So, we got there around 8 and it wasn't too busy. When we told the guy at the stand, where you buy your game and get your shoes to play bowling, that we were celebrating a birthday, birthday boy's first game was free. Awesome.

I ordered the pretzel bites with beer cheese and I wasn't so much of a fan. I liked the beer cheese however, I think it would have tasted better if it were hotter.
The pretzels were okay. They were a little dry.

We then ordered the loaded fries with all the fixins which never fails. It was great. I love fries.

I would have liked if they had a larger menu. 

I feel that my experience deserved 3/5 stars."}
{"text":"We went to the Piedmont Social House and we were pleasantly surpised at what a cool venue it was, since we never heard of the place. It had a nice patio with a bar, a green space with games, tables inside, a back bar and 6 bowling lanes. It has so much potential...Unfortunately, the service was completely unacceptable. It took 15 min to get our first order of drinks, and then we could not find our waitress for long periods of time throughout the night. We all just started going directly to the bar to get our drinks. One time, we did that our waitress came back with the drinks that we had ordered 20 min before that must have been just sitting on the bar. Even as we tried to close out our tab, we couldn't find our waitress for more than 30 min. We finally told the bartender to have her come find us since we were going to bowl. Overall, the place has potential, it just needs a massive upgrade in its customer service to get people to come back."}
{"text":"Good concept but poorly executed. Hopefully they'll work out the kinks since this place is pretty new. 

We parked in the (FREE!) parking garage and walked over to Piedmont Social House. It looked nice from the outside with lawn chairs and corn hole. Unfortunately, it was too cold out to play and you had to be standing directly on top of the heaters to feel any warmth. 

Once we went inside it was a bit confusing. The hostess just stood their assuming we knew what to do..just wanted to eat and drink. We asked for a table for two and she led us to the isolated, enclosed bar away from all the people and the tv screens. Upon our request, we moved to a seat at the main bar. The bartender all seemed a bit socially awkward or really sad to be there.

The beer selection was good and the drinks were tasty but the food was not good at all. The \"famous\" chicken and waffles tasted like it came straight out of a indian restaurant and was full of curry seasoning and cumin. Good thing I like Indian food, but this was definitely not what I was expecting. 

My dad had the veggie wrap and truffle fries. Neither of these were good.

I might return if I'm in the area just for drinks but definitely not for the food. Yuck!"}
{"text":"My new social spot! Love the drinks!"}
{"text":"Great food, nice drink specials and WONDERFUL service! My coworkers decided on this place after the other place we were going to, decided to change their hours. The menu at this location was much better than the original restaurant and the salmon was pretty good."}
{"text":"We got here often it's walking distance from home, best margarita I've ever had and they have them on special. Only down fall is the liquor prices they aren't listed and they are really high as far as bourbons goes. Always great service though"}
{"text":"I typically don't post reviews on Yelp, but after the way my coworker was treated while we were at this restaurant, I refuse to eat here again. We were in Charlotte for training and staying nearby, so stopped at Piedmont House after work for a late happy hour. My coworker from Mexico tried to order a beer, using his valid Mexican license AND passport, and was denied service twice. It was only until we called the manager that the situation resolved itself. As someone who is from the south and encounters such bias often, I am very disappointed with what occurred. Two stars because the manager resolved it - OTW it would be one."}
{"text":"Best place ever! My coworkers and I come here all the time and have the best time. Ivan is the best bartender he has fast service. Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Was here on the first Saturday afternoon/night it was open, so may have still been working out a few things, but overall great experience.

I would skip the smoked Mac n cheese, there was absolutely no flavor and it was cold.  The beer cheese and pretzels were excellent though. same for the sweet potato fries \"loaded\" w/blue cheese and some type of sauce.  the chicken and waffle enter was good, but too much for me.  Friends had the sliders and that would've been a perfect portion.  My husband said he would get the hamburger every time we go back, it was that good - and very big.

There was a nasty beer on the menu, but I think they took it off that same night - it was pretty horrible (think: pickle juice and/or wet dog taste).  The grandma's cough syrup was NOT a lemon drop martini, wouldn't get it again as an avid lemon drop drinker.  The liquid marijuana and nature boy were good though.

we were able to play pool, ping pong and Jenga the whole night and ended up staying about 6 hours.  Would definitely recommend checking it out!"}
{"text":"I was really hoping to find a new spot to hang out and have a drink play pool or Bowl.  It's okay but I don't think I'm in any hurry to get back.  I had the chicken fingers I think they were a little bit spicy but I was probably just anxious because they messed up my order and I had to wait a while.  Very weak drink not what I would have expected ordering a Long Island Iced Tea."}
{"text":"PSH was a bit confusing in the beginning as they were carding but children were present??? The ambience was nice and spacious. The bowling space is cozy and modern with IPad's for scire keeping along with nice sized overhead Flat screen TV's  to view scores or watch sports.  

The large space is divided into several sections to accommodate large parties or comfy enough for a date night. We enjoyed 2 games of pool on one of the 4 pool tables that you can rent for $10 per hour.  There's several ping pong tables on both levels and outside on the patio. There's plenty of fun board games you can choose from off a shelf or enjoy playing your favorite old school arcade game like Pac Man. The patio are is huge with its own bar and TV's

Food selection was typical bar food with a twist,  ($8-$13) the Nachos we ordered was topped with shredded BBQ chicken, yum yum yuuuum!  I will be trying the Chicken and Waffles on my next visit; they look yummy. The mixed drinks were a bit pricey at $10-$13 and they have a good selection of beer on tap $5. 

The reason for the 3 stars is because of the extra extra large space and only 4 pool tables and the  $10-$13 mixed drinks."}
{"text":"Horrible horrible experience! Stay away. The first time I came here was great, the last tim I went was the complete opposite. My husband and I arrived and were quoted a 30 minute wait for a patio table. We placed our name on the list with the hostess Phaedra. We went to the bar to get a few drinks and wait for our table . After one and a half hour I went to the host stand and Phaedra stated she lost the list and did not know how long the wait was. She then walked away. My husband and I walked away and will never return!!! Horrible and even the manager we spoke with was unapologetic"}
{"text":"Garbage service, party of 20 + with one draft list, that's outdated at that.   Food average.  Just a bad experience overall."}
{"text":"After a initial visit, the second time going to Piedmont Social House was a much better experience. I went for lunch, the food was excellent (chicken sandwich especially), service was good, and the building and atmosphere are great..actually tried their bowling lanes and shuffleboard...lots of fun"}
{"text":"I have enjoyed this place since it opened.  Great place to bowl with friends.  Drinks are great.  Service with a smile.  I absolutely love the outside area with bar."}
{"text":"I was happy that something fun opened up in Ayrsley although I don't live in the area but I have friends who do. It's a good spot to hangout but don't count on being able to hear the conversation. It's pretty loud in there. My friend was sitting next to me and I could barely hear what she was saying to me. I do like how they have the upstairs loft area where you can play board games. I don't like how their after 10pm menu doesn't have appetizers. What late night menu doesn't have appetizers? I oredere the fries with all the fixes. They were good but the chopped up chicken tenders that come on the fries are a bit over seasoned.  I did have an issue. I asked for no peppers on my fries and the runner brought it out and it had peppers so I sent it back. 15 minutes later I still had no fries nor had we seen our server. I got the manager and she took care of it and comped the meal. So big shout out to management."}
{"text":"I had the vegetable wrap with added chicken.  There wasn't a lot of flavor and it was kind of soggy."}
{"text":"I went in with high hopes and we were disappointed. Getting our drink ordered s took too long. Getting our drinks took too long. Forgot my food order completely. Upstairs arcade was closed. The food was ok. The waitress messed up our tab (forgot the drinks) and it seemed to be super loud. Might give it one more try."}
{"text":"I had my daughter's sweet 15 party here this pass weekend and we absolutely loved it. The staff was super friendly and the food was fantastic. I am very happy that I booked my event with them because they did all of the work  for me and it all came out great! We had about 20 teenagers and they all had something to do from pool tables to foose ball to ping pong tables.  I highly recommend this place! Even to just stop by for drinks and food.  My guest all talked about how good the food was.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is a great place for a decent meal and drinks with some friends. If you're looking to do reservations, please do them at least 48 hours prior to your event. Also, ask about the policy for bringing bday cakes."}
{"text":"Came here for a corporate event. Not so great food but the ambience is good. A tidy bowling and pool table area and a decent choice of beers. 

I would definitely come again to explore more food options and play bowling."}
{"text":"First time here and had a great time. Our bartender ivan gave us some great service, very accommodating and overall just a job well done. The manager Balil came by to check on us and upon hearing it was our first time did a great job of informing us of all the great ammenities available and ensured that we had a great time. All around great place."}
{"text":"My company picked this place as our evening hang out location during our company conference. Upon walking up they have a pretty nice patio area for customers to hang out and have drinks. When you walk in you immediately see the bowling area. I believe there are about 6 or so lanes to bowl on. After you pass the bowling area you can either head up stairs and hang out or go straight a head toward the bar area. I guess since my company rented this place out they were a little over whelmed and it took me a while to get a drink. But we rented the whole establishment and toward the ends of the night, my coworkers also had a hard time placing their drink orders, even when no one else was barely at the bar. A couple of bartenders passed by my coworkers while they were trying to get their attention. They also had a DJ, and  towards the end of the night every time he cut a song on after five seconds or so, he would shut it off and talk and then move to the next song-- which was annoying. For the Charlotte area, I would have to say this place could be a pretty cool chill spot. I did not get to try the food, but the rum punch was pretty good."}
{"text":"this place used to be pretty great but it has gone down significantly in the last year. the food used to be great but now is sub par. they downgraded their nachos from pulled pork to ground beef. also the nacho chips were stale. very disappointing. their fries with all the fixings used to be served on a large plate with tons of meat but now is a tiny plate with scraps of fried chicken. also beware of their beers - the menu said $6 for Highland seasonal but I noticed when I got home that we were charged $8. the service wasn't great either. the place wasn't very crowded and it still took us almost 2 hours to get out of there. won't be going there again any time soon if ever."}
{"text":"I am so super excited about having this place in the area. I'll be honest there aren't a lot of good places for a person to hang out or even eat at around here. The food so far has been fantastic and a huge surprise. It looked good in pictures but as you know it rarely lives up to a photograph. I have to say PSH really almost has their menu on lock. It definitely has that NODA hipster feel inside with their beer and drink choices living up to that ideal. Honestly I don't hate it because it just all tastes and feels good. One big flaw in this place is their chairs. I have to say sooo many high tops and tall stool seating. I HATE this and it detracts from my experience. I'm short and find sitting in seats like that extremely difficult and uncomfortable. My best friend is 6ft tall and she found them to be highly uncomfortable as well. I didn't actually sit as getting up into one is awkward.  They have bowling, pool tables, video games, tv's etc. It's just a great hang out spot. The outside area should be really great once it cools off around here (although again with the high stool seating??) Get one giant screen tv and this could be my new Panther's spot assuming I can find a regular seat lol. I'm giving 4 stars as I test and feel this place out I think it will definitely jump up to 5!!"}
{"text":"A hipster bowling alley & the food ain't bad to boot.  It had a great ambience & who can resist old school video games like Ms. Pac-Man.  TVs abound that are visible from any location to allow for easy viewing of any game.  The food was A-Okay.  Watch out for the sweet tea unless your sweet tooth is akin to looking for a diabetic coma.  The veggie wrap next time I would get it w/o the red onions & ask for lighter on the lettuce.  The green goddess dressing did not overwhelm the natural flavors of the veggies.  The carrots & celery that accompanied the chicken tenders should not have left the kitchen - white celery unless that is a new delicacy.  The chicken tenders themselves area ok.  Service is a little slow which is to be expected as the staff is covering multiple areas of the bar/restaurant."}
{"text":"Food is descent and fairly priced but service is awful. Don't expect to get out on a small time frame. Maybe it was just my server but he never checked in on us. I asked him for lemon for my water twice. Took 45 minutes to get 3 lemons and by then I had very little water which he never refilled or anyone else did. Then my friend did not like the honey carrots (btw, they are horrible. Save your taste buds and get the sweet potato fries!) And we asked 2 different serves for our waiter and he never showed up. Eventually, an order of another set up fries showed up but by then, we were done with our food. He seemed lovely but did not actually try to make us happy. I want to think they are better then this and I will come back but i am highly disappointed."}
{"text":"Great new place! Awesome patio! Prices are a little high. And some of the waitress were rather awkward.... But we'll definitely be coming back! (We'll just stick with the male bartenders outside lol)"}
{"text":"I vowed that whenever I'm in that area I had to go to Piedmont and get those chicken and waffle sliders! So I went on Saturday after 9pm just to discover that the chicken and waffle sliders were not on the after 9pm menu! Boooooooo! So, I went for wings and sweet waffle fries. But first, I had the Thai Firefly cocktail! I loved it! Then, I ordered the dry rub wings. The wings were cooked very well, the dry rub was just not enough flavor for my likings. The sweet potato fries were good,  though. Overall, a very nice place to go bowling and hangout on their patio. I was just very disappointed cause I was eagerly anticipating eating those yummy chicken and waffle sliders..."}
{"text":"So of course this place lis located within the \"Town of Ayrsley\". I came in on Friday night to celebrate my sons birthday. A sign place outside simply states after 8pm 21+. This is great to know that there is an adult friendly place to go to without kids after hours. My son and a friend went bowling, and they had fun. I appreciate the fact that they also are ada friendly with access to the lanes for a wheelchair. Ive never been here before but does appear very promising with plenty of different options for  things do to include pool. While I didn't sample the menu for drinks or food I will be back to try some things out. Its really nicely decorated on this inside and it is also split level."}
{"text":"Good concept, terrible execution.

If you want to attract large groups (with pool tables, bowling, drinks, sports games, etc) then you need to be able to provide adequate service. Either they need to hire more people or be able to train the ones they have now for better customer service. The food is okay, but stick to the wings/fries/bar food. 

Good atmosphere, good drinks/beer selection, TERRIBLE service"}
{"text":"Everything on the menu seems delicious. I love the shrimp tacos! Whatever sauce on top of the shrimp is so good. I have also had the chicken and waffles which was filling. Also the classic chicken sandwich with the awesome sauce. I got the sauce on the side at first because I'm picky. But I ended up loving it. The chicken was so tender, juicy, and hot. I'll definitely be back. I have a few more items I want to try."}
{"text":"Had a pretty bad experience here.  Went in during a semi slow time.  Our server took our drink order, returned with drinks, took our food order, and never returned.  Someone else brought the food (not the issue), and we never saw our server again.  No one checked on us, our drinks were completely empty, and managers were walking around looking like there was nothing to do.  I had to get up to ask for a box as well as my bill.  Another 10 minutes went by before a manager came by with our check, and said, \"sorry, your server wasn't feeling good.\"  Not a great excuse.  If she knew the server wasn't feeling well, someone else (anyone else quite frankly) should have been checking on us.  Over 45 minutes with nothing.  I'm a server, and that would never be okay at the establishment I work at.  As someone in the industry, I'm very understanding, but this was pretty bad.  The manager really didn't seem to care much either.  Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"I really want to love this place!! The concept is fantastic... the service and food? Not so much. I've been in 4 times, all in a group of 6 or more girlfriends. We always have to beg for a beer and the food is just ok.  We came this past Thursday and when I sent a text to my girlfriends to meet up the text said \"ok, the food is ok and we'll have to order two drinks at a time but they have live music!\".   Like I said, I really want to come here often but live music just isn't enough after a while."}
{"text":"I want to rate this higher but service wise, I just can't. The food is very good. The drinks are OK. But the service is always awful. Waiters pass you buy and it takes over 20 minutes to get acknowledged after being seated, even when the place is half empty. I've given this place a try three times already and this is a persistent problem. $40 a lane is also pretty steep and you have to walk to the desk to request that they restart a person's turn when the bowling ball gets stuck, which is often."}
{"text":"We stopped in because of some pictures my husband found on Instagram and I don't usually go for that, but glad I did!!! It is a delicious hidden gem. It's a great place for a family gathering or even a group of friends! In the afternoon you can enjoy a limited meal selection and 2 games of bowling for 15$! Great portions!"}
{"text":"The service was okay and the food came in giant portions but taste wise, they were all over the place.

My oldest son no longer orders off the kid menu b/c the portion sizes are typically smaller. So he ordered an $11 burger with fries. Well my friend's son who was with us ordered the kid burger and his burger and my sons were the same size. That made no sense, especially since there was a huge price difference between the two. 

I ordered a cup of soup and they bought me a giant bowl of the saltiest soup next to condensed Campbell's chicken and noodle soup. It was horrible and I told the waiter but he didn't even acknowledge my disappointment. 

Fun place as they have bowling, a few arcade games and nice seating areas but beware of the KIDS MENU PORTION SIZES and salty soup."}
{"text":"I only stayed outside at the bar, so I can't speak for the inside.... The service was a little slow, but I wasn't in a rush or anything. I enjoyed a delicious burger and sweet potato waffle fries, and gluten free chocolate lava cake. It seemed a little pricey, but there are daily drink specials. Lots of high top tables, and the green space with corn hole and chairs to relax outside."}
{"text":"Awesome new spot for bowling, games, and good food & beer.  Love the outside and several inside bar locations.  Great Beer list!!  A must is the Chicken Sandwich, the thing is huge and taste great.  Great spot for after work socializing as well."}
{"text":"If you've visited Queen City Social, then you've pretty much been to Piedmont Social. They are very similar in quality of food, prices, and indoor games. 

Hubs and I went for an outdoor screening of the Sandlot (one of the best movies ever). Very cool sounding concept except they took about 30 minutes or more to figure out how to set up the projector. They set up chairs and seating on their turf lawn, but they don't allow dogs on the turf so we had to sit in the way back since we brought ours. 

After things got rolling, it was a nice night. I ordered wings and hubs ordered chicken fingers. My wings were pretty dried out and hubs chicken fingers were okay. If you wanted drinks, you could only order beers in cans to go on the turf. 

The staff were not really the friendliest, but the events they host are pretty cool, so check it out for yourself!"}
{"text":"I went to Piedmont Social House tonight with a party of 10.  Girls night for dinner and drinks.  Sat on the patio.  So far so good.  Ordered an appletini with Tito's vodka.  When it came, it was incredibly watered down.  I have not once in my almost 50 years complained that an appletini was too watered down.  I usually need more sour.  Seriously, I could taste water in it.  I didn't want to make a scene in front of the whole table, so I didn't complain.  Figured I had just blown $6-7 bucks.  When the bill came, it was $11.00!!!!  I then decided there was no way I could pay that much for that terrible drink, so I shared my concern with my waitress and she had a manager come to the table.  I told him I didn't mind paying some because I drank it, but it was watered down.  He basically told me that was not possible because of the way they pour their drinks.  He said he would take some off for me.  I got my corrected check and he took off a whopping $1.65.  I paid $9.35 for water basically.  Needless to say I won't return.  There are plenty of other options in Ayrsley.  Doesn't seem smart to me to nickel and dime customers instead of making them feel valued and heard.  The amount they lose now on my many future visits would have greatly offset even the $4-5 he could have taken off the drink.  Oh and I still had paid for about $20 in my food not to mention the other 9 at my table, so it wasn't like I (we) didn't contribute something to their bottom line in sales for the night and throw in that was 9 more people that witnessed my bad experience and walked away with the wrong impression.  Icing on the cake...  The receipt plainly says give us your feedback for a monthly drawing at piedmontsocial.com/survey.  Yep, you guessed it, dead link."}
{"text":"I went Saturday with two family members and we had a terrible experience. There was no host/hostess present when we arrived. We waited around for someone to greet us, and after about five minutes, I finally approached someone at the shoe rental desk to ask who would seat us.  She walked us back outside and a hostess then tells us it's a 30 minute wait to sit inside. Before going inside, I called from the parking lot to ask about the wait inside and outside. I was told there was no wait for inside seating.  He hostess seemed confused, then sat us inside immediately. Once seated, we waited 11 minutes without anyone acknowledging that we were there. Service was subpar. The server, when she finally came, quickly said sorry for the wait, are you ready to order? She'd been at the table behind us and could have let us know she was our server and would be with us soon, but we felt ignored. Once we finally ordered, one of the meals brought out was wrong and we were never given silverware. By the time we received silverware, food was getting cold. Then it took a really long time for her to come back to check on us so that we could advise that the order was wrong. Then once the order was corrected, the chicken was super salty! My sister ordered a burger and wasn't asked how she wanted it cooked. When it came and she'd taken a bite, it was completely raw inside. Brown outside, pink/red inside kind of raw like it was seared in the manner of an ahi tuna. When we reported it, she was given a 15% discount and the salty chicken dinner was free. Normally a manager comes around to check tables to see if everything is ok, but not for us. It seemed like we were a bother for even complaining about the food mishaps, even when we didn't complain about the lack of professionalism and lack of timeliness. It even took forever to get our checks!Needless to say, we will not be back. I had my infant with me on this outing and while caring for him, I failed to get a picture of the undercooked meat."}
{"text":"Service is complete trash. Staff is so disorganized and inefficient. I will never go back. Avoid at all costs. There are many similar style places in Charlotte that are wayyy better."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place in town. The food is just phenomenal in taste, originality, and budget. Drinks are super yum! So many great areas to enjoy yourself: bar inside, outside area, bowling area, uptop... The staff has always been friendly and well trained. Easy to park and enjoy a great night out."}
{"text":"Often times I've tried to do to-go orders and they are closed to the public. This is frustrating because I don't see what it would hurt to just be able to walk up to grab a Togo order. The food however is good."}
{"text":"We checked out this new and much-needed addition to Ayrsley with some friends over the weekend.  As we walked up to the place, I was amazed with how big it is!  It takes up the whole freakin' building.  

There is a big outdoor patio area with tables and TV's.  If outdoors just isn't for you, there is a good amount of seating inside although they didn't have a big enough table inside to accommodate our party of 8.  One issue with the outdoor situation:  there were people standing around all over the place smoking out there.  I don't know if they have yet to define a \"smoking area\" or what, but they need to do something about it because it's obnoxious to the 90% of us who do not smoke.  

As you walk inside, you'll get a real perspective on just how massive the PSH is.  There's a bar to the immediate left and booths and tables, and there are tables scattered all about the place as well.  You'll also notice the bowling lanes!  There are 12 available for use, if my memory serves me.  In the back, there are pool tables as well as another pretty large bar area.  If you're looking to have some beverages while you're here, you shouldn't have a problem at all!  Speaking of beverages, there is a pretty good beer and cocktail list at your disposal.

When you go upstairs, you'll find some old-school arcade games like Mortal Kombat II, NFL Blitz, and Pac-Man.  There are just a few so far, and I hope they plan to add to the collection.  There are also more pool tables as well as ping pong tables.  If you're looking to play pool, you're going to have a pretty good chance at finding a table.

We had food while we were here and it was pretty decent.  The menu is essentially bar food with a Southern twang. I had the catfish and grits which was pretty on point.  Our waiter was good but had some issues when it came to splitting up the check.  There were a few kinks with the service that I'm sure they'll sort out.    

All in all, this is a really cool addition to Steele Creek and I think there is tons of potential for this to be a really popular spot!"}
{"text":"Such a fun place! Food was great and the bowling is better than other places I've been! There are big screens or projectors at the end of the lanes so you can watch your favorite team while you bowl! They also have technology to take a picture of yourself to display next to your score...very neat!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time tonight. Super cute area and it was a beautiful night so we walked around the area after dinner. The food was good, not amazing but good. Lots of games to play also. Really cute and fun atmosphere! Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere. The food isn't the best. Lots of games to choose from. Wouldn't suggest going on a date there. More of a group thing to have fun."}
{"text":"Here's the thing.... The place itself is pretty cool! Lots to do, and something we definitely needed on this side of Charlotte BUT the staff are lazy, not trained well, and not focused. Every single time I come here, I'm disappointed! The waiters have no idea what's on their menu, they actually discourage you from certain items, takes foreverrrrrr to get drinks, and often times, I've had the order wrong or part of it not even put into the computer and a friend left without a meal! The staff runs this place down... It's a shame, and I've stopped going because 10x of crappy service is enough for me. The management needs to seriously clean house."}
{"text":"Great venue for team building event.  Bowling, billiards, table tennis and other activities in this full service bar.  Cool atmosphere."}
{"text":"Very cool atmosphere! Lots of game to play and TVs to watch games. Tasty food, too! However, our waiter was not attentive. We got the mimosa special and only asked for 1 carafe but he brought us a 2nd we didn't ask for. My dinner was incorrect, I was brought an entirely different dish. When the table was finally brought a round of waters, placed the straws in our glasses...He touched them all without a wrapper. He did not bring water refills and when we were ready for checks, he stood at the bar counting his tips instead of cashing us out. 4 stars for atmosphere, 1 star for customer service."}
{"text":"I was not impressed or pleased with my experience at Social House.  I went with a group of friends and we later had three people join us.  We asked could an extra table be added (which were all empty to the left of us) and we were denied as it was stated the table belonged to another waitress/section.  That didn't make any sense to me as I believe you should always be accommodating to your guest(s), especially if every one is ordering.

One of the ladies at the table ordered an adult drink and she did not receive it until being done with her meal while others at the table had already received theirs.  She even reminded the waiter.

Another person ordered chicken & waffles and requested more syrup and was told extra syrup costed $0.75.  First, the amount of syrup they provide you for Belgian waffles is ridiculous.  Who wouldn't need more?  Second, a 24 FL Oz bottle of syrup on average cost about $2.00, if not a little more, so where is the absurd price coming from?

I could provide example after example as to why this was not a satisfying experience.  However, I will conclude my review here. My two stars are solely based on being pleased with the taste of my chicken and waffles. My wish is that management will take the reviews into consideration and reevaluate how they can make their business a more enjoyable place."}
{"text":"Great place lots of space lots to do, food is nice and service ain't bad either. New so pretty busy"}
{"text":"Great location  - we live right around the corner...but it is expensive.  Beer prices and food prices are high. Patio is nice with good weather.  Service is sometimes ok sometimes the servers act like they are doing you some kind of favor.  Good place to go if looking for something fun to do indoors."}
{"text":"First and foremost, I have only tried a few options of food (which were all good), so this review is more of the place overall... 
Employees are always friendly and provide great service. Their drinks are great, and reasonably priced. Now to the best part.. the amenities! The new addition is the park (used to be parking lot) and outdoor space! We've been bowling several times and always enjoyed ourselves. It has been a great spot to bring people from out of town, and be able to have a variety of things to do! (Arcades, table shuffleboard, pool tables, ping pong tables and more!)
Great spot to go with just one person, or a large group!"}
{"text":"Food is average in quality and  way over priced for the portion.  The drinks are over priced as well.  2 beers, 2 shots and 2 tiny appetizers cost $51.00 plus tip.  Not worth the money.  Should have gone to Wild Wings instead.  Took 30 mins to get drinks and then the shots were brought to the table AFTER the food came out....and we were sitting in the bar area...."}
{"text":"I was excited to try the Piedmont Social House but left disappointed in the food. My boyfriend and I each ordered the Winner Winner Chicken Dinner. I had it with mac and cheese and carrots. He ordered it with mac and cheese and asparagus. The food came out very fast. I\"m not sure if that was a good thing or a bad thing. The portion was a good size, but the chicken was totally underwhelming. The menu describes the chicken as being \"double dipped\". I'm not sure if that was the problem, but the chicken has a ridiculous amount of breading that did not adhere to the chicken and was just flaking off. The temperature of the food was warm but not hot. We were there for lunch around 1pm and it seemed like maybe the restaurant had cooked a bunch of chicken earlier for a lunch rush and we were getting what was left over - the chicken was definitely not 'fresh out of the fryer'. The mac and cheese was okay, very creamy if you like that style. 

I can't speak to the games as we didn't play any. If you are going there for the games, then you will probably have a great time.If you are going for the food, I would not recommend it."}
{"text":"I have been here three times. First two at the bar were great. Service good, food delicious (riverboat tacos and grilled asparagus). Third time was with group from work (8) and we sat outside. The food didn't come out at the same time, and the last three meals took an extremely long time with two servers checking to see what was missing. The drinks were not refilled. Not impressed with lunch service, and hate that I told all these coworkers how much I like PSH. I was let down."}
{"text":"Let's start by saying it's a great concept. However, the food is mediocre and the service was worse. We started by trying to order beers-our waitress disappeared and then was not able to tell us ability the specific beers on tap. Our orders were messed up, and they attempted to charge us for the extra salad that arrived halfway through our meal. We didn't get water refills, nor did the beer we ordered ever arrive. The 5 people that sat at the table beside us left as they never got waited on. Maybe it's a bad night, but we won't check it out again."}
{"text":"Fun Concept - Bar, Bowling Alley, Pool Hall

Billiards ($12) and Bowling ($45 w/o shoe rental) is by the hour. So you may have to move fast to get 6 people through 10 frames. 

Few service kinks to work out. And the food is what you would expect from a food court or theme park."}
{"text":"I discovered this place by accident.  It is great for families and it doubles as a place for date night.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is the waiter was terrible.  He couldn't get the order right and he had issues."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE! Do not go here! The staff has no idea how to work the equipment or trained in ANY DECENT form of customer service! We first went during opening weekend, all the employees were rude and acted as though we were putting them out, not to mention they didn't know how to work their equipment or have change for our tab! We decided to try again hoping that they had worked out the bugs, turns out the employees were just as rude if not worse! Save yourself and go to 10 Park Lanes instead for better service, drinks, food and bowling. This is a complete waste of time and money!"}
{"text":"Our visit was horrible. We waited for seating for an hour. The waiting staff and manager refused to accommodate our party, which included a disabled person - which prevented us from seating at the high top chairs. Waiter, Seth, then berated us across the parking lot when we left, unserved.

This venue is not welcoming!"}
{"text":"My friends and I decided to go here for a bite to eat before our movie time . The set up of the place was nice and inviting. Sadly we had a waiter that was more worried about talking to his coworkers than serving us . He took a long time on getting us just plain water then we told him that we were in a rush because our movie time was coming up. Our food took a long time to come then once we got it it was cold. I order the seasonal salmon the salmon was good until I got to the cold part in the middle and the sweet potatoes under my salmon were cold and undercooked. The only thing good was the string-beans on my plate. I wouldn't come back"}
{"text":"This is a rather fun concept... bowling/lounge on the inside and game watching on the outside.

The story:

1. The staff is hand off amazing. Jorden at the bar works her butt off and is so friendly and helpful! 

2. The food is rather good - waffles and chicken gave me a lot of attention among my friends - but nothing too creative or original here.

3. The place is super clean, new, and modern - and I really appreciate how they have lots of walking space...

4. It would be nice if they had some specialty cocktails that were actually unique... 

5. Parking is doable... but expect to use the deck, which can be a bit annoying..."}
{"text":"Food was fine by the service was pretty poor.  Sat at the bar and got almost no attention for 10 minutes (on a nonbusy Tuesday).  Management and staff should work on providing better service to customers, especially when its not busy."}
{"text":"Their food is really good, and I love the atmosphere. It's a nice place to hang out, and I think that it is decently priced. I'm not too crazy about the drinks from the bar, but it's ok because the food really does make up for it."}
{"text":"We had a company social gathering at the PSH. We had a good time. The food we had was catered there by the staff and was delicious. We played pool, bowled a few sets and there was even a ping pong table if you were so inclined. The outdoor setting has corn hole and a great seating area for nice weather. This is a place I could see coming after work or on the weekends with friends."}
{"text":"Piedmont is a nice little spot located in Ayrsley. They have lots of tvs with a few bars and outside seating. They also have ping pong, pool tables, and bowling. We went here primarily to bowl so that is where my review will be focused. First it took 20 minutes just to get a lane with only 1 person in line in front of me and no one currently bowling. The 20 minutes was just waiting to check out as it appeared the cashiers were having issues with the system. Here you pay by the hour, and your hour starts 10 minutes after you checkout which isn't all that great if you have people running a bit late as the rest of our party waited in line to checkout 20-25 minutes as well after we did. The price is really expensive for the time you actually get to bowl, not to mention you have to go to the bar yourself for drinks which cuts down on bowling time once again. They need to rework this whole process. Their food and drinks are ok so I'd probably go to eat and play pool, but not for bowling again."}
{"text":"Good food, SLOW service. Enjoyed my meal. The chicken and waffles were delicious(except my waffle wasn't warm). It took almost 40 mins for my full order to arrive. Waitress but nice but nonchalant and lackadaisical. It's also very loud inside because of the bowling but there is outdoor seating available which is nice pending weather conditions."}
{"text":"At long last I was able to check out Piedmont Social House after the Yelp event there!
Groupon had a sweet deal that included Bowling and shoes for four (one game - weekend costs a little extra), 2 Appetizers and 4 nonalcoholic drinks.

Let me say, this place looks totally different in the day! Lots of light and a crazy amount of space!

The lanes here are new, well-oiled and well maintained. The computer system has all sorts of additional features, including bumpers that go up and down for kids.

The bar(s) have a sweet selection of Draught Beers including 2 or 3 from NODA (Hop Drop and Roll me). Prices are reasonable and there's always some sort of drink special. Pool tables and video games upstairs. Fussball, darts and lounge downstairs.

The front end (the bowling part) and the bar were run pretty efficiently - our waiter lane side was nice enough but a little awkward handling the Groupon and not the best server (also forgot my to go drink I ordered). The appetizers (pulled pork nachos and pretzels with beer cheese were both yummy - I just wished the portions were a bit bigger, especially the four nachos...)

We did have a blast! Very family friendly until the clock strikes 8PM then it's adults only! Discount or not, this place is pretty cool!"}
{"text":"This place almost received a totally 2 star rating until a GM and a Night time manager took over our party and made things ok. We went on a Weds night..we were told about a  week before that we did not need a reservation because \" Weds are not ever busy\" Well, we had a big party- 10 people plus a baby. which we had told them the week before ..we got there and there was NO TABLES, NO LANES ( all league bowling) And a Private party in the back bar. There was a long table in the second area of tables...which we proceeded to sit down at and we were  told we would have to move because that room was closing and they had no staff to work the room. The ladies in the hostess stand were not the least bit helpful, they had no answers for us, except to stand ...( remember this is a party of 10 and a baby ) until a few separate tables came available. Well, the Birthday Boy, went out and saw that the shift was changing as far as Management goes. He had a big talk with the GM who was extremely helpful, he placed us at the big table again..gave us a great waiter ( Wayne) and also a bottle of wine because they were out of the one we had ordered a lot  of us ordered the Chicken and Waffles which was great, the Burgers were good and, so are  the Fried Green Tomatoes! We then went bowling and had a great evening. It just goes to show you that One manager is not the same as the next. The GM is great there...the whole premise of the place is fun and has great food and drink! Try it!"}
{"text":"They are still working out kinks both in the kitchen and with service, but we LOVE the atmosphere and are happy to have such a great place close by. Our kids have come to love the bowling alley as well. We have been 4-5 times for family fun, in addition to the several adult only evenings we've enjoyed."}
{"text":"Great place, concept, look, and location... I think they still have a lot of long time competition surrounding them that locals are a custom too. 

I love the bowling ally, pool table, games and spacious environment. I just wish more people would go to them during game days. But of course Panther fans will be as lose to the stadium as possible if they don't have tickets. 

I think PSH should truly spend time promoting theirselves better during game days, so more people will know they exist. If you want the business you have to go out there and get it. Otherwise they'll never find or know who you are."}
{"text":"Brought lots of family to bowl on Christmas Eve. Thoroughly enjoyed it. The staff were so helpful and friendly. Food was great and very timely. It seemed as if they were super happy to have us there. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"I think this place might've given me the worst experience I've ever had. I don't even write reviews, but this cannot be ignored. I don't even know where to start regarding how trash the service was. So my girlfriend and I met up with some family and friends for a birthday dinner. I think we showed up around 9:45. Nobody came to us, so we had to ask for a waitress, she didn't show up until 10:10, then had the GAUL, to tell us the kitchen closes at 10. Mind you, this place doesn't close until midnight, and it's a Saturday. After we explained to her that we had already arrived before 10, she reluctantly took our orders. We constantly had to ask them to refill our drinks, which only got refilled once. The rest of the times we asked, she never got back to us. After we were all done eating, we figured we'd bowl a bit. There were multiple open lanes. I go up to the desk and ask to reserve a lane (around 10:50), only to be told that they stopped booking people at 11. At this point I've already decided that they're getting a 3 star review, but there's more. So instead of bowling I ask if my conglomerate can reserve a couple games of corn hole, what do you think their answer was? They said it was raining so nobody else could play. Mind you, EVERYONE else was currently playing corn hole, and by rain they meant the drizzle drop of water that hit the top of my head one time. We literally tried to do everything this place with amazing potential had to offer only to be turned away every time. Which I found peculiar seeing as everyone else around us had no such issues doing all the things we wanted to do. They say they close at 12. But they really want you to leave around 10 so they can get out at 12 as well. Their saving grace was their wings which were pretty decent. I couldn't finish mine though so when I went to ask for a box (yes I had to ask for a box to someone else, our waitress was that horrible), the man in the back even blew a gigantic sigh in my face as if him getting a box was the tallest of tasks before he went and grabbed one with the worst sense of urgency I've ever seen in my life. As we were walking out around midnight, we saw another group of people up in arms because their bowling game had just been cut off mid game. I wouldn't recommend going to this place ever, under any circumstance, which is really disappointing because the between  venue, the games, and the food, there's so much potential here. The one thing they did a fabulous job of was making us feel unwelcome and unwanted."}
{"text":"After three attempts to make a reservation for a party if 10 at 7:00 for 10-9-15, I have not received a return call yet? I also sent 2 email messages. Each call I made was transferred and I was told to leave a message. I sure hope we will be accommodated this evening at 7:00? I which I will change my review at that time! So far, poor team management!"}
{"text":"Came here with a couple friends from out of town and it was a blast! They have a ton of games to play inside like pool, bowling, corn hole, darts, and shuffleboard. They also have an arcade on the second floor but they closed off the second floor at 9pm, so we didn't get to try it. Great drink selection and all of the staff were nice. Will definitely be back next time I'm in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Yesterday I had my 21st Birthday party at PSH.
I had gone in a couple days before to reserve a spot outside on the patio for my party.
When I got there at the time it was scheduled, it was not set up. I went inside to ask what was going on and they informed me they had moved it somewhere else. OK? 
Come to find out, they had put my party on the other side of the patio that was completely roped off and covered with awnings and there was heat! Management came and informed me that they did not want my party outside due to this random May cold weather 58° that I worried about throughout the day.
This by far was impressive. They took the extra mile to make my birthday wonderful.
Food was out on time like I asked, hot and tasted amazing!
We had an awesome server, Jake (not from state farm lol), he as well made the experience great. He's definitely someone that I would come back to see! 
This place treated my family, friends and myself fantastically and made this day special!
Thank you PSH!
SAMANTHA BRAUN!"}
{"text":"I have mixed feeling about this place.  Went there once for a work function, had a nice time.  The game areas were nice.  The staff was very attentive and the appetizers were tasty.  The second time I went there with friends.  A few of us had the chicken tenders and chicken an waffles.  The chicken tender (which were also on the chicken and waffles), was overly salty and peppery.  I couldn't drink enough water.  The server got all but one of the checks wrong.  The server got frustrated with us when we tried to explain who had what.  At the end, some of us paid more just to get out of there.  I'll try them again, maybe it was an off night..."}
{"text":"Went there last night to see what the buzz was about. This place is huge...lots of TV's everywhere. This should be the go to spot to watch football games on Saturday and Sunday once football season starts.

There are multiple bars so it was easy to get a drink. There's an outside patio, bowling lanes, and pool on the main level. There's an upstairs area with a couple couches, chairs, etc. There are more pool tables, ping pong , and table games like jenga/scrabble also. 

The only downside is there was no bar on the second level so you have to run downstairs every time you need a new drink. This is an awesome space and def.worth checking out."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times--first time was a date, and the other was to watch the game.  It's  in a nice location and I like that they have games to play as well.  My friend and I had a ball playing ping pong; haven't tried the bowling yet but I'm sure it's fine.  The menu is pretty varied--the mac & cheese was decent and the drinks are pretty good.

I'll definitely go back...very soon."}
{"text":"The service is terrible !!! I've given them many chances in hopes that one time was just a mess up. The few times I've been there they haven't been busy. My orders always get messed up."}
{"text":"Fun location looking forward to hanging out in the summer. Bowling is a little pricy- $40 per hour. Lawn looks fun. Looking forward to coming back in the summer and playing corn hole. Also excited to come back to play darts!"}
{"text":"Great Social Location.  Good Drinks And Food.  Upstairs Has A Few Arcade Games And Sitting Area.  The Bowling Is Sticky Tho. Seems To Stick When Doing Your Approach To Let The Ball Go.  Other Wise A Good Time When You Visit."}
{"text":"Food was good.  Bar food standards... Somewhat pricey, but acceptable.  Piedmont Chicken sandwich was good, and nachos were huge.  Service was HORRIBLE!  Lots of people with PHS service shirts on, but mostly standing around talking to each other.  We were there for nearly 2 hours watching a half of football, and server never refilled water, never checked on us... Ever!  I had to go to bar to ask for another beverage.  Won't be back based on that."}
{"text":"I won't be returning. My entire experience was literally ok.... I spent $41.00 at the bar. Sometime told me not to try the food..... here was my order: 

1-glass of wine
1- Mojito (which taste like sugar water)
1- appetizer of Truffle Fries
1-side order of asparagus 
1- side of smoked mac and cheese (no flavor)

Meh \"OK\" to everything. Don't order the food or the Mojito..... stick to wine."}
{"text":"My date and I went here last week. Good and drinks were pretty good. Had a nice time. The flow of how everything setup is kind of confusing. It's hard to explain...you just have to see what the majority of people are doing and kind of fall in line. Again it was decent time and will probably go back if nothing is is available."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is good but the food is mediocre and the service at the bar is terrible. I would not recommend this place. I sat at the inside bar to watch the Cavs game and the bartender was MIA for nearly my entire visit. He never checked on me the whole time I was there. And, when he finally came back after I had been sitting for 15 minutes, waiting to cash out, it took another 10 minutes to get my check. (Two people sat next to me but left after sitting for 10 minutes without service.) When I complained to him, he blamed it on the computer being slow. Honestly, take some ownership, dude! I asked to speak to the manager afterwards but she was unavailable too. Guess it's the culture of the place."}
{"text":"Me and my friends came here looking to bowl and get some good food with it. It was a 2 hour wait on the bowling. A 25 min wait turned 45 mins after 30 mins pasted to sit and dine. Customer service was horrible at the bar, control desk, and check in. Good service at the bowling lanes. Great decor overall  with almost every adult bar activity but the Saturday night waits were crazy and not delivered well. Pricing was okay for quality besides on drinks. The food was good but with customer serv for sure would not return."}
{"text":"Great selection of cold beer,  amiable bartender and football on almost every TV. Am I in heaven?"}
{"text":"This is what you get when you cross a bowling alley, pool tables with good food, great beer, a game room and an accommodating staff - a great place to enjoy an afternoon or evening with friends, coworkers or just random new people.

The place sits in the Ayrlsey complex in southwest Charlotte next to the Indian restaurant and across the parking lot from Portofinos. They have plenty of seating if you want to enjoy a meal and 3 bars, 2 inside and one on the patio,  There are 2 sets of 6 bowling lanes, pool tables in the back and a game room upstairs.  There is comfortable seating throughout if you want to just relax and chill.  

The food menu is broad and very diverse with salads, burgers, wraps and southern specialities like shrimp and grits and fried catfish.

The staff was amazing when I was there but it was their grand opening too.

But a couple of flaws that made this short of a 5 star review.  First, in the mens bowling shoe selection, another group took all the size 12s and our group was forced to go smaller to 11 1/2 or much larger to 15s and 16s. Seems like they only have 2 of each size shoe.

Second, the casual play bowling scoresheet software does not allow you to add a new player to your game. They had to change your game to a league game.

And third, the beer prices are a bit pricey here. $6 to $8 for local craft beer that you can get elsewhere for $4-6.

Another bad thing is that parking can be a bear here. But I blame that on Ayrsley, not this business.

Still, I liked this place and I work close to it so I can see myself coming back here once in a while."}
{"text":"I heard about this place and was excited to try it out. 1. Place seemed chill loved the out door area. 2. Bar outside was packed so we chose to go in and take a table. The hostess showed us to our table. 10 mins went by before anyone ask us for drinks..15 mins went by and we got tired of waiting. I kept looking to the bar and the guy there wasn't making any drinks. Finally we got up and left. Nice place horrible service. We ended up at wild wing instead. We got served within 5mins of being seated. I would rate it a zero if I could."}
{"text":"Don't believe the crap people say about the food. It's great, one of the best Mac and cheeses in Charlotte. I live right across from it and frequent PSH, frequently.
Their dry rub wings are awesome as well as their Bang bang pulled bbq chicken sandwich. Want an appetizer? You can't go wrong with the beer cheese pretzels, delectable! My fave is their meatballs and mash. Sitting outside is cool especially with the live events!
Very cordial staff, sometimes it can be lengthy to get a seat, also since I live here parking is not a problem but for anyone coming in it can be the biggest headache. I suggest you park in the concrete jungle ON THE FIRST FLOOR otherwise you can get ticket our towed, or behind the YMCA."}
{"text":"Came in tonight and had a wonderful experience! Great food, and mostly amazing service. Our first waitress was a bit of a nuisance and very short with us. She came to our table once and we never saw her again. We almost got up and left but ended up being convinced to stay. Our true server was a young man who went above and beyond to serve us and all of our needs. Very polite, very fast, and an amazing server! A great experience overall, and we plan to come back often in the future! THANKS GREG!!!"}
{"text":"I feel like every time a new business comes to Ayrsley we all get excited and build up expectations over months of waiting, so I am not sure if that is clouding my opinion. 

The experience started out with an intense ID review at the door. It has been a bit since I have been underage and I have no idea what to do when a bouncer furrows his brow and compares you to your ID. I usually opt for a cheesy smile but the scrutiny caught me off guard. 

The space they have set up is really impressive. They have tons of square footage, shiny new bowling lanes and a neat upstairs area with arcade games. We went on a Saturday night and karaoke in the corner was in full swing in the back corner but we couldn't hear them at the table we found by the bar. The floor was very sticky and the chairs were a little uncomfortable. 

Our waitress was super friendly and got our drink orders out quickly and our order of chicken tenders made it to our table in good time. They were delicious! Freshly fried and tender with the amazing awesome sauce and the maple honey mustard. 

The food was good but the prices were a little steep (the beer we were drinking was $2 cheaper next door) and our server was prompt. I just wish there was something *great* about it to warrant the inflated price."}
{"text":"We made a stop here for my sister's 30th birthday party pub crawl, and chose this stop to surprise my sister with a birthday cake and cupcakes.  The manager and staff were very accommodating and had everything ready for us when we arrived.  They brought out the cake, with candles lit, and sang Happy Birthday to my sister.  Afterwards they provided us with everything we needed to enjoy the cake and get us on our way, as we had other bars to stop at.  The atmosphere and service was great!  I'll definitely go back to enjoy the bowling."}
{"text":"Went there last night, they were having a private event in the back bar area, so no one was allowed there.  We chose to sit outside, where it was hot and humid.  Our food came, and was over-salted.  We couldn't eat the $8 loaded fries due to all the salt.  We ordered the shrimp skewers and received 3 little shrimp on a skewer.  They were not done, and the skewers looked pathetic.  I will no longer patronize this establishment."}
{"text":"Came here with a few people and we all had a really good time! Easy access to the parking garage. You can eat inside or outside. We walked around the inside just to check it out. They do have bowling. There aren't a lot of lanes so I suggest you get reservations. There is also an area to play ping pong and arcade games. When we walked towards the back we saw another bar area. There was someone there from Noda giving away samples. There is also a bar area outside and towards the front. The front area was closed to the public. 

Hostess and server was very nice. Our server was on point. Drinks were good and they do have daily specials. We started off with the cheese dip and pretzels. It was very good. Pretzels were lightly salted and soft and not chewy which I like. Cheese dip was garnished with green onions and tomatoes. I got the chicken tenders. Tenders were very fresh and came to the table piping hot. The breading was good but very thick around the corners. I got the hot buffalo sauce and ranch dressing for dipping. My husband got the chicken wrap. It was grilled chicken with pimento cheese. The pimento cheese was so delicious. It had a great kick to it! Everyone else got chicken and waffles and they all cleared their plates so I know it had to be good. 

Can't wait to come back again!"}
{"text":"There's really not a place like the Piedmont Social House.  It's kinda like a hipster country club crossed with the basement of the rich friend that you grew up with.  You know the one: you were only friends with him because he had arcade games, a bowling alley, and a pool at his house.  Otherwise, he was intolerable.  Well, PSH doesn't have a pool but it does have a two bars (plus one outside), two bowling alleys, pool tables, ping pong, old school arcade games, and various spots to just hang out.  

The menu is good and I highly recommend the Foghorn.  Plus, their mambo and awesome sauces are killer.  

If there were a few head scratchers, it would start with the overwhelming amount of guys wearing yellow \"security\" t-shirts.  They are imposing like bouncers and spread throughout the place; which seems unnecessary at 6pm on a weeknight.  Maybe 2am on a Saturday but it's a bit much early.  This is something I expect is still being dialed in.  

The other head scratcher are the bowling alleys.  I love the idea but the sound of balls hitting the floor is all-consuming - especially for people who think you literally throw a bowling ball.

Still, the place is cool and definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch! Service was fast and the food was hot! It was not that busy, however, we arrived a little before the Charlotte lunch crowd. Definitely recommend if you're looking for a lunch place with coworkers."}
{"text":"The bowling physically was fun. The tablets are really updated and food is above average. The pricing is average but as someone else stated in another review for larger parties the customer service is really poor. I felt like I wasn't suppose to be there. Staff was constantly watching and when we did interact they were either confused or spoke rudely. I understand that being a larger crowd it is louder and more demanding but there was no need to be rude. It sucks because this place has a lot of potential but for the lack of hospitality I will not come back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my food, good beer selection, fun atmosphere. Our server Bo knew the perfect beer to recommend to me. My chicken sandwich was super good and loved the sweet potato fries. I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Piedmont Social House has been good to me... so here's the thing I've always gone with large groups, who have always arrived separately and in small groups at various times and we've always been accommodated which at times can be difficult to find. Like hey can I get a table for 15 but only 5 are here now...lol 

PSH is a place for drinks and a good time! They have food, good bar foods menu, I love the fries with loads of toppings, can't think of the exact name and the wings are worth having repeatedly. If you are looking for a place to hang out with friends have some drinks and bar eats, this is totally the place."}
{"text":"Piedmont has very good food and service. The venue can be a little loud (particularly with the bowling lanes all going) which might bother diners looking for a bit more quiet conversation. But if you don't mind the more \"social\" environment you'll enjoy eating here."}
{"text":"Great space, great service and the food is decent. Fun for family and or friends the bowling alley is a great attraction."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere, standard food. We ordered a lot of food to taste everything and it was ok.. good enough for bar food but not if you're a foodie. Kids love it of course! There are tons of games to keep them entertained. I would go again to keep the kids entertained but not for the food/drinks."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in our visit. Went on a Friday to bowl and eat/ drink. The staff was not welcoming and even forgot to tell us which lane to go to. 

At the lane we waited for 10 minutes for a server before finally asking a girl if she could wait on us. She said we weren't here lane, but she ended up waiting on us. Needless to say, service was SLOW! 

About halfway into our bowling somebody puked over the balcony onto our lane. It was 20 minutes before anybody came to clean it. They proceeded to clean the puke with a rag and a bottle of spray cleaner, even though we told them it was vomit. The manager said she thought it was just a spilled drink, even though several people saw this happen. The manager only offered to add 30 minutes to our bowling, but after the horrible cleaning job we declined. She then said she would email us coupons for free games......we never received them. 

It seemed like a nice place but they really need to get their act together and work on customer service before we consider going back, especially since they were pricey!"}
{"text":"Good service. Weird charge on the bill but good experience overall. I loved the Southern Caprese Salad that I ordered. Very delicious."}
{"text":"Update: 8/30/2017 @ 1:55pm

I tried to call to make a to go order and the phone rang and rang and rang. I called 3 times from 2 different numbers and no one answered. Unless you all changed your business hours, there should be someone by the phone. You lose customers this way. Come on PSH get your stuff together."}
{"text":"On June 21, 2018 I met my friends at Piedmont Social House for some food and drinks. What happened next was unbelievable and very unprofessional. The waitress and her managerJessica refused to address our complaints. Instead they gave us attitude and snickering remarks. The service was extremely horrible and I recommended staff and manager going for sensitivity training.."}
{"text":"I was really excited to visit this place since it opened up but was very disappointed after.  I went on a Saturday night around 10:30pm.   Note; there is a ton of construction going on around the place.  They do check ID so have it ready at the door.  Once inside the décor was a mixed between strike city and hickory tavern restaurant.  We decided to get a bowling lane and order food there.  
The Staff registering the bowl lanes were polite and helpful but seem nervous about not making mistakes.  Which they did with us by not letting us know which lane to go to.  Note: this was out first time here so we don't were to go.  I asked her which lane are we supposed to be at and she kept apologizing and told me to hold on.  I ended up figuring it out on my own and just confirmed it with her.
Once we got to our assigned lane we got our balls to bowl and were looking for a waitress to assist us.  No one came!  So I decide to bowl and keep an eye out for a waitress, still no one came!  Then to top that the bowling lane wasn't gloss properly so it would make you trip up if you tried to roll your ball.  We were so hungry for food with no service that I didn't even mention that to the staff.
I decided to look for someone to serve us at the bar and still I got no service!!! All of the staff seem so concerned with talking with each other instead of trying to serve a customer.  So by this time I was upset and went looking for a manager that I have to wait even longer for.  Once she did arrive I explained to her that we haven't had service since we go to our lane.  She apologized and said she would handle it but that's what she is supposed to do.  By this time, I already had a sour taste in my mouth about the place.
She tried to smooth it over more by giving us an extra game of bowling but I ended up sending 73.00 that night on bowling and food.  So comping me a game means nothing to me.  All I will say is first impressions last impressions and I will not be going back again.  I have been to many mixed entertainment establishments (Strike City, Ten Lanes, etc.) and by far this is the worse."}
{"text":"What a fun place to go, I came for lunch with a friend during work, so we weren't able to stay and test out the games - he got the burger with sweet potato fries and I got the chicken salad, grilled instead of fried.  The food was awesome and pretty big in size.  There was a good amount of people, but the restaurant could have held many more.  Looking forward to going back at a time I can grab a drink and relax/play some games."}
{"text":"This place has a really cute atmosphere and a great patio with a nice beer selection. (Yay white zombie!)   The service that I received here was very very slow.  It wasn't busy, yet it took us forever to get our beers and food, and to place our orders.  I got a hamburger with sweet potato fries.  The sweet potato fries were good, but they had a little too much sugar on them for my liking.  It was more like a dessert.  The burger was good except it was really undercooked on one side. I was not asked how I would like it to be cooked so maybe that's why.  I'm not sure if I would return, if so it would be because of the atmosphere.  It would be a nice place to watch a football game though, they have a lot of televisions and I did really like the patio."}
{"text":"Went for a weekday lunch.  Food was delicious and were large portions.  I ordered a side salad and bowl of soup.  The server came back to clarify what I wanted.  Apparently a side salad may have meant full portion and bowl of soup could have meant \"cup\".  The server said both soups come in bowls.  Well so do other restaurants but call them cups, so I'm hoping this server was having a \"duh\" moment.

Service was nonexistent.  The server never checked back until I was finished eating and even then asked if I needed anything else.  I said no, thinking the check would be brought but it wasn't.  Once the check was dropped off, my companion, who was paying, left to use the restroom, came back, and the server still didn't pick up the check.  A manager finally walked by, took payment, and cleared the table.  On the way out, the server stopped us thinking we were dining and ditching, and even though the manager said we paid, the server wanted to be \"extra sure.\"  I felt humiliated by that action.

Drinks are overpriced."}
{"text":"I was at PSH with a group of friends and we had a blast. We had plenty of space to be comfortable and plenty of options on how to spend our time. The food was great and the wait staff was nice and kept our orders correct. I'm a PSH Fan."}
{"text":"It's a great place to grab drinks and socialize with some friends but not so much on the food part. I've been here a few times since they've first opened their doors and the food has always been a hit or miss. The first 2 times the food was on point, but several times after that it went downhill. I think i gave up on the food after this one night we were there and it just went all kinds of wrong. My group of friends and i ordered the winner winner chicken dinner that turned out to be the loser loser no dinner  
The wait on the dinner itself took forever and then after all that waiting our fried chicken came out raw. Not once were we offered a complimentary appetizer or anything for our time. The chicken also came out raw the 2nd go around after they offered to fix it from the original error. To top that off, we weren't even offered to have our meals comped, i had to escalate it to a manager to have it done. On that note, I've taken a step back on dining here but will stop in for a delicious drink or 2. I gave them 2 stars because of the food being a disaster but the drinks are at least a 4 star."}
{"text":"Had a great time bowling here. I was part of a group for someone's birthday. We had two lanes reserved from 5pm-7pm. We had platters of wings, meatballs and gouda mac bites. I tasted the meatballs and the gouda mac bites and thought they were good. The waitress that was serving us was great and attentive. The bowling was great! Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Went opening night food was good drinks we good only thing is..they don't have wings!! I will be back for the steak and chicken and waffle sliders.."}
{"text":"Cool new spot. Expensive as fuuuuuuuuuck for food and drinks though. $95 for 2 orders of tenders, 2 shots, 1 craft drink, and 5 bud lights....wasn't very crowded for a Saturday..maybe due to Restaurant Week. A couple of the bartenders were friendly (Jamie and her fit brunette friend)...the tall skinny brunette upstairs had a HUGE d/stick up her ass though. The girls at the concierge stand were nice and I felt very safe as it was well lit and easy to navigate the different levels...food was good. Tenders and awesome sauce..outdoor bar was fun and the dude recommended a ginger beer/ vodka drink that came in a copper cup...pretty cool.  Might try it again."}
{"text":"Date night on a Wednesday not crowded. The chicken fingers were the best I've ever had which was surprising but they were. Shot a little pool and they were closing. Outside bartender was too busy she asked if we wanted salt we said no and of course salt. Other than that good time , nice layout will be back."}
{"text":"Went on Friday 9/15/17 around 6:15. There were 4 of us and 2 of the people had never been, but we told them the food was very good and we were all looking forward to a cold beer. When we walked in, the hostess told us that there were no more tables available outside, only inside. We said that was great because we didn't want to be outside anyway, since it was so hot. What she didn't tell us after seating us with menus, is that no one would ever come back, even to at least take our drink order. The hostess walked by our table a couple of times and never said anything else, and the bar near us was closed. Thought this was strange on a Friday night. After several minutes, we finally got up and left. No one even noticed us on our way out, and we didn't see anyone around who worked there to complain to. We walked across the street to eat at Wild Wing, where we were seated immediately and had great food with great service. Not sure when or if we'll be back, even though we live close by."}
{"text":"This place is cool but food and service sucks. I've been a few times and food was horrible. First time got fried chicken salad.. Chicken came out cold. Second a bunch of apps. Fried tomatoes, don't have any flavor. Nachos we ordered without pork and came with it. Chicken tenders were what you expect anywhere. I can't imagine returning other than to drink."}
{"text":"During a recent work trip to Charlotte I stopped into Piedmont Social House twice, simply because of its proximity to my hotel. PSH is more of an entertainment complex than a bar and grill, they have everything from bowling, shuffleboard, darts, etc. In addition to all the entertainment there are two bars and a pretty decent food menu available too, which makes PSH the perfect place to unwind with friends or co-workers after a busy day in the office.

My first visit I arrived solo, and took a seat at the bar. I figured that I would order dinner and have a drink or two, as they had a large selection of North Carolina beers available on draft. For my entrée I went with the Fried Chicken & Waffles, which was their signature fried boneless chicken tenders served over a fresh Belgian waffle drizzled with maple syrup mustard and served with a side of smoked gouda & cheddar man-n-cheese. The food was pretty good and the portion size was pretty generous too. The following evening I returned with a co-worker after having dinner nearby, we caught up on the day's events all while enjoying several local craft beers.

Overall the beer selection here is pretty diverse, however the focus is clearly on local beers. While I didn't have a chance to bowl or anything else I can see how this would provide an excellent evening out with friends, family, or even some co-workers. PSH provided me with two fun evenings while in town, and I will be back next time work brings me back."}
{"text":"I like this place. It's a new-ish spot in Arsley that does it all. There's a bowling alley inside, some cornhole games set up outside and good food to boot. The service has always been great for me and the food is classed up traditional bar food.

You have to try the chicken and waffles appetizer it's worth the diabetes. 

Last time I was there a group of women had just come from seeing Girl's Trip and immediately bonded with my wife over how good the movie was. We didn't even know them. This has nothing to do with the restaurant but you should really go see Girl's Trip or get the Bluray when it comes out."}
{"text":"I live close to PSH, so I've been a few times for lunch and have really enjoyed it! However, I went in tonight to grab a quick beer 20-25 minutes before the site said they close and even though the patio was packed and the bartender was serving other guest she let me sit there for 5 or so minutes and then told me she could not serve me because they stop service at 10:30. Even though she was still serving others and it says they close at 11 not 10:30. As someone who works in the service industry and just wanted ONE drink after working....I was very disappointed by this. Hopefully it was just the blonde female  bartender, because every other time I've visited PSH I've really enjoyed my experience."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with my BFF. We sat outside which was nice. I ordered the Raft salad (half portion) which was very tasty. Thr salad had alot of bacon..grape tomatoes and bleu cheese. Next we split the fried chicken tacos and southern fried chicken sandwich with sweet potato fries. Yummmmmmy. We paired it with a Irish cider beer which was deeeelish. 

We really had a nice time and enjoyed all of our food."}
{"text":"On June 22, 2018, I had dinner with 3 of my friends and I experienced the worst night every in Piedmont Social.  We have finished eating our dinner and paid our bill I asked for a styrofoam cup with water to take outside with me to go play corn hole while my friends continued to finished they beer. The waiter told us we cannot take any alcoholic beverages outside but we can purchase can beer and that will be allowed outside and we totally understood. The waiter gave me a water and me and my friends proceeded to go outside. I was approached by the manager Jessica and she said you cannot take alcoholic beverages outside, I informed her that this is water not alcoholic she said to me \"that is not water\" I told her this is water in the cup so she said you cannot take the cup outside the premises and I said ok no problem and I went back to my table and place the cup down and proceeded outside with my friends to play corn hole. Approximately 2 hours later I went back into social piedmont to use the bathroom and the waiter was in the restroom as I walked in, I was on the phone laughing and I said Im from NY to the person I was talking to on the phone and the waiter said \"Im from up to too so I don't know why the fuck you laughing for, so apparently she must of thought I was laughing at her.   As I proceeded to walk out  Piedmont Social to only have the manager Jessica to come up in my face and tell me I will not allow you to be disrecptpful and threatened my employees. I looked at her and asked what are you talking about, she proceeded to say you mad from earlier because I didn't let you take your cup outside I said absolutely not your rules is your rules
But Im very upset that you approached me and accused me of being disrespectful and cursing your employee out. I would never do that. I asked the manger can she give the waiter name with corporate email because I would like to write them and let them know how Im being handled and treated. She refused and wouldn't give me the waiter name or email I asked her twice and she said \"No\", I than asked her why is you treating me this way is it cause I'm black she just batted her eyes like I wasn't even talking to her at that point with no cooperation with the manager I just walked out the store. I will never ever spend my money in there.

The manager in Piedmont Social Jessica is very prejudice.  Jessica approached me and accused me of threatening her employee which is a serious allegation, as being a manager her approached was not professional at all."}
{"text":"You want to come here for the fun, not the food. PSH has a diverse after work crowd during the week and an Ayrsley party crowd on the weekends.

Food - Visited w/ a yelp event and none of the food was impressionable. Most said the chicken and waffles were the best. Unfortunately, I never got to taste them. The chicken tenders were tasty. On my 2nd visit, friends ordered chicken tenders, which were COLD, but they didn't want the hassle of sending it back. One friend had a side of green beans and while fresh and flavorful, she felt they were undercooked. Another friend had Mac & cheese and really liked it, stating that she usually doesn't like m&c in restaurants, but she liked PSH's. I had the white chocolate cheesecake, which was good. I was impressed with the presentation. Entrees are priced reasonably at $12-16.

Venue - The venue is large, with 12 lanes of bowling (6 in 2 locations), two floors, several pool tables, and various arcade and ping pong tables throughout. Tried to play ping pong, but found it to be a scavenger hunt after one waitress said that there were two downstairs in addition to the ones upstairs that were occupied. She simply didn't know what she was talking about, which we realized after searching high and low, even finding ping pong tables in storage behind the building, and security finally explaining she was wrong. 

Drinks - Mixed drinks were extremely weak for average price of $10. I HIGHLY suggest you drink beer or wine.

Service -One floater asked me if there was anything our table needed. I told her I wanted to order some cheesecake. Her response \"Oh, I can't do that. You'll have to tell your waitress.\" It seemed like she was asking to be polite, but was in fact useless. While she may not have been able to input the order, the proper thing to do would be to simply tell my waitress. Nevertheless, OUR waitress was on top of things, despite having several tables to take care of. Can't remember her name. Thicker black lady w/hair pulled up and red lipstick. She was on top of things and obviously experienced and a hard worker. They do work as a team here and several people interacted w/our table getting random things.... Napkins, silverware, straws, etc.. So with time, I'm sure things will get better.

While you're always going to have kinks with a new restaurant, management needs to force its staff to at the very LEAST familiarize itself with the lay of the land and the menu.

That being said, it isn't Piedmont Social Restaurant, it's house and you don't come here for the food...  (At least you shouldn't. While the menu is more extensive than a normal bar, don't be fooled. It's bar food.) You come to socialize. Expect an environment where you can have some laughs, play some games, and have a good time socializing."}
{"text":"Visited this spot last Sunday to watch a football game and I was impressed.  We ended up grabbing dinner there as well.  I thought the food might just be regular old bar food, but those chicken & waffles proved me WRONG.  They were amazing, the waffle/chicken/honey mustard/syrup all went perfectly together....I would definitely go back and order it again.  My husband and I shared the appetizer size, it was pretty big and definitely a plate to share with someone.  Glad this place is down the street from us because we will be visiting again very soon!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Get the chicken and waffles!!! Mm mmmmm!!! Good atmosphere, yummy drinks. Mac and cheese taste like boxed Mac on steroids but is passable. Chicken and waffles were best had in a while!!"}
{"text":"The drinks were good/standard.  The fries and burger were as good as expected.  However, we are thankful for the accidental free drink. 

The five star rating is for the band the chicken strips. The band was like playing my ipod. OMG and they nailed every song and mash up. The chicken strips were some how better. I now don't understand why all chicken strips aren't that good. Consider me ruined. Anyway, I'll only be here for a week but I have the feeling I'll be back."}
{"text":"We were very excited to check this place out after seeing all of the early pictures on Facebook. The layout is great and there was a decent crowd for a Thursday evening. Our group each had a beer and then we split chicken fingers and the beer cheese with pretzels. The beer cheese was delicious! I highly recommend it. The only negatives were that they were out of the garlic dipping sauce and a Noda beer. With just opening this week it was disappointing that they were already out of a product. Will definitely try it again!"}
{"text":"What a great spot for all ages, we ate dinner (I had the chicken & waffles first time ever). The kids menu was good and fair priced. The rare Red Oak Lager was found here on draft. Very happy with the food. The service was a little slow considering our server was covering tables all over the establishment which was probably eating up all his time. On a side note the bowling is a lot of fun so there is typically a wait put down your name ahead of time if your going to dine at a table. The nearby parking garage was easy to enter and find a spot in easy walking distance. We happen to come during the Bacon and Beer festival and was able to benefit from the amazing live music that was coming from the court yard. Would love to visit this place again if were ever nearby... PS if your bringing kids they don't have apple juice."}
{"text":"This place has everything you would want to from bowling to shooting pool to even playing darts.  I will return here in the near future and recommend others to check it out.  I am so glad I found this place and had no idea it existed. All they need is a cigar lounge here."}
{"text":"They only get two stars because of the laid back atmosphere. We sat in the restaurant/bar area and ordered drinks and appetizers. The food was terrible! We got the chicken and waffle sliders which come with a spicy mustard sauce on the side instead of syrup?!? The chicken tenders were alright and the waffles were actually good.  We asked the waitress for syrup and she returned with two small dishes of it, it wasn't enough and by the time we realized it and asked for more the food was cold.  I ordered a side of Mac and cheese which didn't come out until I asked the waitress about it.  When it did arrive it was lukewarm at best and was nothing more than noodles in a thin cream sauce, yuck...so disappointing. I ordered one of the cocktails, it was green, I forget the name but it tasted like cough syrup and I had to send it back. I drank my husbands drink instead which wasn't much better. When the check came she charged us for the drink I sent back, when I brought to her attention she took it off but overall this place is best I would say for bowling and shooting pool, please don't expect good or even alright food or cocktails.  If I ever return it will be with a group for the games and recreation and I'll order something they can't mess up like a soda!"}
{"text":"So... I came here for the Yelp Elite Event and this place is freaking awesome.  My mind was blown. 

Location: its great having some where cool to hang out that's on the south side of Charlotte. It's trendy enough to be in Noda and cool enough to be in Epicenter.  But  I'm glad that it's not.  It feels good to have something this cool in Ayrsely. 

Amenities: they have plenty of pool tables, ping pong tables, board games, arcade games, shuffleboard, foosball table, corn hole in the patio, tons of TVs, and bowling lanes.  Again...how cool is this place.  

Food: I was able to sample some of their food. The chicken and waffles was really good. The pretzels with the beer cheese was magnificent. The chicken tenders with their spicy Polynesian sauce was the perfect duo. The chicken and pimento cheese wraps and the veggie wraps was just as good. 

Beverages: we were able to try some of their vodka drinks with sweet tea.  They were sweet but strong.  A definite crowd pleaser. 

Service: its great to know that a place with great amenities can still provide excellent service.  All the waiters and waitress was tentative to our needs and they were really friendly.  I even found out that one of the waitress lives across the street from my neighborhood.  And the manager, Todd made sure that everything was perfect. He even gave a hug to my husband and I.  I'm so glad that he put everything into this establishment. It shows.  It's rare for me to give a perfect rating, but its a honest and accurate rating. 

Parking: its not the best, but its free parking and ample amount.  It's a busy area but I was able to find  parking. 

Everything was perfect here. The only thing that I didn't inquire about was security.  If people gets rowdy, I'm not sure if they have security.   But I'm sure Todd has that figured out already.  :)"}
{"text":"We started out really liking this place but every time we go something makes it not as fun as the last time we went. The parking is terrible, don't waste your time looking for something close to the place, you have to just go straight to the Parking deck. Food is uniquely different ( a reason that makes us choose this place) 

When the place is almost empty we go in to bowl before 6pm on a Fri. to play \"two for one bowling\", 2 people 3 games each (6 games total) some how totaled 18.00 with no shoe rental (3.00 per game not \"two for 1 bowling\").I didn't care about the price, we ended up buying 4 more games at regular full price.
 
We were placed between 2 groups of people, one side, all grown ups & non respectful bowlers & the other group with kids. The entire other set of lanes had no one on them. 

When you request a lane, you have to tell them how many games you are going to play & you can not go over that, you have to get back in line & be put on a waiting list & wait your turn, I have no problem with this. However, we waited at our lane with 3 other lanes empty for 30 min. then they came back to us & said that we were next to bowl. they loose so much money here on the process of waiting & getting people to bowl.

There needs to be a faster bowling counter for service, someone is always waiting in line there. Every time there is a Question at the Bowling shoe counter, they have to go find a manager to answer the question. Very time consuming & costly.

We will go back but not as frequent & they need to get more confident workers that know Math & know how to space out bowlers."}
{"text":"Had a great time at Piedmont Social House tonight. Our bartender Ivan made great drinks and was very friendly and accommodating. We tried several appetizers, all delicious. Also enjoyed talking to the manager Balil. He was very informative, gave great suggestions, and checked on us frequently. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Food is ok, not great. But okay enough. 
Drinks are great, bar tenders aren't so great. Great Craft beer list, good cocktails, okay wines.
Games, fun, atmosphere- all worth it. Other so-called Social Houses or Clubs (QCS) can't get it right. They get it here. Love this place. So Easy to enjoy yourself, friends, family...just Easy and the staff is super helpful."}
{"text":"First time here.   Nice place. Good mix of family and social time.  $40 bowling one hour."}
{"text":"This place is cool in concept, but it's execution has gone downhill since they first opened. 

We most recently went there for a team event and just bowled. Only minor complaint about the bowling was that 6 people can play but only 5 scores fit on the screen. 

The drink selection is pretty bad. They did finally get an NC cider instead of just Angry Orchard though. Their cocktails are quite pricey and not worth it. 

I've never been that impressed with their food. Everything I've had is pretty mediocre and nothing stands out. 

The most disappointing part is the games. They used to let you play a handful of games for free -- pool, point pong, Cornhole. Now they seem to charge for everything. 

I don't think it's anywhere near as good as Queen Park Social except that it's open more often during the day."}
{"text":"Good place for drinks and bowling, not a fan of the food. Atmosphere is good and so far the demographic is pretty diverse which to me is a huge plus!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and works for kids. Have enjoyed this addition to the area. Could use some work on the food and cocktail menus. Not overly impressed - but not terrible either. Nachos were were pretty disappointing.... Very dry - like a plate of plain tortilla chips :("}
{"text":"My coworkers and I LOVE this place. It's great to hang out after work, and we've even held private functions there. Good beer selection and some nice app choices. You can do so many activities here... There are small clusters of bowling lanes scattered throughout, pool, ping pong, shuffleboard, darts, foosball, video games, etc. There are nice clusters of furniture here and there, so you can sit, drink, and chat, just like you're in your own living room. The outdoor area is nice, and they often have live music out there. Cool new concept for this fun section of Charlotte (Ayrsley)."}
{"text":"A very cool place with pretty good food. Lots of games to play.  

The fried green tomato wrap was amazing.  Was a little sad when I came back at dinner time a few days later and it was not on the menu.   The service was not the greatest.  We ended up with three different waiters within the span of three hours. (We were there watching a game). Overall a great spot and worth checking out."}
{"text":"This is a cool spot to check out. Me and the boyfriend came here due to a Groupon- bowling for 2, bowling shoes, appetizer, and 2 nonalcoholic drinks. 

Staff was very friendly and polite. If you do go bowling, you have to trade your shoes in to get bowling shoes. The bowling lanes are average and there were plenty of bowling balls to choose from. 

The 2 nonalcoholic drinks that the Groupon mentions are soft drinks. I was hoping that they would have some sort of speciality lemonades or sparklers. We also ordered beers that were on special for $3.50 (Tuesdays) which wasn't bad at all. For the appetizer, we got the pork nachos. I thought they were just okay while the boyfriend loved them. They were freaking huge and could easily feed 4 people. 

The only downfalls was that there were a good amount of gnats/flies near the bar area where our food and drinks were being held. Also the bowling lanes are closer together than other alleys which was uncomfortable because 2 other groups came shortly after us and we were sandwiched in although there were other lanes open. 

Overall, I'm glad that I visited. There are equivalent options if not better options that are closer to me so I won't be visiting again due to location but I'm glad I came."}
{"text":"The place looked nice. My friends and I came to try and bowl. Haha well the wait was 3 1/2 hours. Needless to say we ate but didn't get to bowl. This was our second place and we were tired of waiting. Make reservations cause you will be waiting on the weekend. We all were from out of state and had no idea Charlotte had a huge bowling life. The bar was nice, upstairs they have TVs and pool tables but the pool tables had waits too."}
{"text":"I work just two miles from Piedmont Social House so was pleased when it opened as I'd now have another lunch option.  Have now eaten there four times (for lunch) and have yet to eat any menu item I would consider good.  I've had the burger, salads, the tacos, the green tomatoes, etc. The food is fair, but I'd not go there to eat again unless forced.  Too many options.

Having said all that, it's a great venue if you want to hang out, try some games, drink a few beers, and enjoy your friends."}
{"text":"My friend had her birthday get-together here this past Saturday. Being my 1st visit, I did not have much of an expectation. I was surprised to find the size of this place: 8 bowling lanes, pool table, arcade games, dart, shaffle board (coin operated) & plenty of room to roam around. 

Honestly I like to have loved this place more, but my two main disappointments are: 1) $12+ tax for a cocktail and it was TINY in my opinion - I swear I can get cheaper & better drinks in NYC at this rate 2) half of the beer on tap printed on the menu was out - guess what, use a chalkboard instead. Nothing kills a beer buzz like playing a game of \"do you have this then?\"

The food overall was good - the glazed carrots could be cooked longer (it should be soft, not crunchy). The chicken fingers were solid (and appeared fresh, not frozen). 

This is a solid 3.5 star place"}
{"text":"Can't review much but food was solid. Ate at bar so service was good. Good beers on tap. Loved the wings, nachos, pretzel bites. Yes, we ate a lot. Tried to go back for bowling and fun but half the place was reserved for a large party and hostess was MIA so we left."}
{"text":"Bowling Review: 

We walked in last Friday with a few friends to enjoy some bowling, I was looking forward to this since we had a great time at the Yelp event here a few months back.  

0 stars for Jess Johnson and Geri who were manning the cashier desk in the front of Piedmont. Piedmont has some weird policies regarding their bowling service and these two were very unhelpful and quite frankly, rude. Geri was better than Jess, but dealing with them was a hassle and just put a damper on my experience. We had a big party and wanted two lanes, apparently this was a problem. A few wanted to pay for multiple people but, Jess (with an attitude) kept insisting this was impossible and that separate transactions were needed to pay for each bowler. I'm sorry (not really), but that is messed up..what if you brought your family of 6 and had to pay for all of them... you are telling me that I can not pay for all of them together and must swipe my card 6 times to cover my party.... get out of here. She argued with us for a good amount of time, my friend eventually got sick of hearing her argue and just swiped his card multiple times. 

4 stars for everything else. Other than that, we had a great time. The bowling was fun, the servers were friendly. Though was a little irked at the fact that a car bomb was $10 and no drink specials were available, but that wasn't a huge issue. 

Piedmont, check the attitudes on your employees manning the cashier desk. Especially Jess Johnson. I understand that Fridays and weekends can get hectic, but there is no excuse for treating a customer as poorly as Jess did."}
{"text":"My husband, kids and I took his mother to Piedmont Social House for her birthday lunch, this past Sunday.  We had never been and wanted to check it out, as it's in a great location w/ a small park beside it with different games to try.  The greeter was nice and let us know we could seat ourselves, inside or wait for a table outside.  We took a look around, inside, and were impressed w/ how the bowling alley and bar was set up.  When we were seated outside, it took a while for our server to get to us and the area around us needed sweeping.  Once we got our order in, the food arrived quickly; however, some of the order was incorrect and the food was okay.  I was expecting a bit more flavor, especially in the BBQ dishes.  I think overall this establishment is a nice hang out, but not so much for a sit down meal."}
{"text":"I had lots of fun there; would go back if I can. I was invited to the place for an internship event, didn't know what to expect, but it turned out to be a really fun experience. They have a bowling alley, pool table, arcade games. 
I had their chicken tender, cocktail shrimps, and queso dip, which in my opinion was pretty good. I thought the chicken tender was really soft, and their food were above average in general. The atmosphere was ambient and a great hangout for groups/team building and friends. 

Slight complain though is that there aren't enough seating/tables by the bowling alley so if you are trying to eat while bowling, you might have to stand and eat. Really wish they have more tables."}
{"text":"Dislike almost everything about this place. Service, poor. Counter assistance helped person behind us before us and then dismissed me when I mentioned we had not been helped. Layout, poor. Everyone and everthing is on top of one another. Expect to have at least one beer spilled on you and get bumped a dozen times. Food, ok. Tasty but expensive."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is nice to hang out with friends for a few drinks. Drinks are a little pricy and food is very mediocre. Nothing horrible but nothing fantastic about this place. Just okay."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere and drinks. Food was okay but relatively expensive for what you get. Great neighborhood events and outdoor area."}
{"text":"I've been a few times and wish it weren't so far away from my place! Such a chill hangout spot, had a great time every time. Servers were super friendly and loved the atmosphere. Definitely recommending to friends! Loved that ping pong was free, along with corn hole, giant jenga, and darts! Bowling was a blast and it's set up super cozy and nice."}
{"text":"My family loves this place.  Our twins love bowling and we like the food and drinks. It's a win win for everyone. Unfortunately, it get too busy for us after a while with the kids but that's a great thing for them"}
{"text":"Best items: Nachos, wings, pretzels 

If you just want somewhere to hangout this is the spot... bowling, pool, games, darts, ping pong, they have it all!  

Sucking during winter when they have a party booked because the outside bar is closed and you can't do a lot but other then that love this place!"}
{"text":"The menu looks good, but the execution was lackluster. We had a large table (8) and our service was slow and unfriendly. Our food took over 40 minutes to arrive and was missing a few things we asked for. There was no attempt to compensate us for the poor service. They can improve on ticket times and staffing as it seems they have lots of security but the waitstaff struggles to keep up. Not super impressed but will give it another shot in a few months after they work out the kinks. The space is well planned and has a lot of potential."}
{"text":"Probably one of the coolest hang out spots that you can eat and play on this side of town. We went here last night to partake in some games,food and drinks. My honey enjoyed his chicken sandwich i had the wings which were good as well i played it safe and ordered wings because i really don't  see how any one can mess up wings to be honest. Our waitress/bartender Brittany was great and super witty. Wasn't crazy about the margarita was a little watered down house made tasting to me i more so like specialty margaritas so i will have to maybe try one of their specialty drinks next time i go. Im thinking about having my birthday party here this year.They have bowling, pool tables, ping pong and even more outside. Highly recommend Piedmont Social House to go on your to do list if you're looking for fun and games."}
