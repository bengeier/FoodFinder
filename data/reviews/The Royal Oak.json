{"text":"I have visited for lunch on three occasions and all were very enjoyable. The server is pleasant, informative & efficient. The steak & mushroom pot pie is excellent & the price is fair. I'll be back"}
{"text":"Great food and great environment.  The servers are friendly and know the menu and drinks well.  I would recommend the Oak to anyone."}
{"text":"Go here quite often and have always had great food and service.  My girlfriend and I have both enjoyed everything we've ordered off the menu thus far, and we've ate at quite a few places in the area.  Prices are also good for the quality and portion of food!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch attracted by the 5 star Yelp review - felt obliged to write a review to insure others are not similarly attracted.  Ok beer selection but could have a few more crafts and a few less foreign taps.  We all had burgers and they were consistently overcooked.  Buns were stale and dry.  Perhaps some of the other sandwiches, wraps or regular pub food would be a better choice.  Service was slow given there were two servers and only four tables in the place."}
{"text":"Great Pub... Food is good... Service is great and the atmosphere is really nice... And very kid friendly... The only thing I don't like is if you go there in the evening and on the weekends it gets quite loud and there was a few times that me and my wife couldn't hear each other talk... All in all and great place to go... :) :)"}
{"text":"Steak and mushroom pot pie was amazing, especially if you are really into traditional style English pub food staples. Want to make it even better, pay the extra for the Stilton cheese! Delicious!"}
{"text":"Sub par food quality. I've been to both the Whitby Shores location and the Garden and Taunton location. Both lack in quality and excellence."}
{"text":"An authentic pub it's not, but good beer and snacks abound. The Yorkshire pudding appetizer in particular is noteworthy."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times over the last two years and their food is always really great. Most recently I took my intern here for lunch and I got a steak sandwich. It was slightly overcooked to my liking but it wasn't chewy so I was okay with it. Taste was great, a hint salty but I loved the spicy fries!  We ordered the trio dessert. Peanut butter cheesecake was amazing! The chocolate is just as good and the carrot cake wasn't too sweet which was a perfect balance.  Would def come back again for lunch sometime :)"}
{"text":"Went to the Royal Oak with my wife and 5 year old daughter for lunch.   As Brits, we were expecting something fairly well aligned to a British pub.   I ordered the fish and chips. I have to say it was terrible. It tasted like it had been pre-cooked and then reheated in the microwave.  It really was poor... Dry, soft, chewy etc. not light and crispy as you would expect and hope. The tartar sauce was its only redeeming feature.   Sadly, the server also seemed totally disinterested in whether the meal was in any way enjoyable.   On the redeeming side, my wife had the chicken pie and thought this was fairly good. Nothing spectacular, but a nice crust.   The kids meal we had was cheap crap, eg Kraft dinner, although to be fair, this was advertised in advance.   I can see that this pub could be a good venue to watch football (soccer), but I'm not really inclined to rush back and try anything else on the menu!"}
{"text":"I normally visit the one in south Whitby, but my friend wanted to see how this one was so we gave it a try. It was not good.  I don't know if our server was new, but she was extremely rude and rolled her eyes a lot. We got some kind of chips and dip for an appetizer and the chips were over salted and dry.  Then my friend and I timed it. It took 25 minutes for her to take our meal order. We had our menus closed and to the side for that time and she walked by about 3 times before I said \"excuse me, can we order now\" AGAIN with the eye rolls. I got a Caesar wrap with no chicken or bacon (I'm a vegetarian) and of course 20 minutes later it came with chicken.  It's a good atmosphere, mediocre food, but unfriendly staff. They have the personality of the dirty napkins you leave on the table."}
{"text":"Not a go back to. Took a long time for food after ordering. Their \"new\" beef dip had deli meat folded over in the bun and gravy inside made for mess and not needed with dipping gravy which is thick type not jus. Fries kind limp. Sheppard pie was deemed only average while the price was not. The chicken fingers overall were thought to be fine."}
{"text":"I love a pub with a good atmosphere and this place has got it. The fact that the food is also good is a bonus. I've been here several times over the years with friends. IMHO, you can't go wrong with good food, good drinks, and great friends. Anyway, I normally get the wings when I'm here and they're awesome. I've had the Sirarcha and Thai (because I'm notorious for sticking to honey garlic wings and am trying to change it up). But I've recently discovered (check: yesterday) the joy that is Cajun Dusted. Those things were delicious-ly awesome. They could be a bit spicier though, but really, it wasn't a huge issue. I also hate messy fingers and these were the least messy of the choices that I had. Lol. So good! To drink I had Strongbow Cider, which they have on tap. I've also heard their wraps are great but this comes from a friend. And while I trust her judgement, I might have to try them myself the next time I'm here so I can add to this review. I've also had their chicken fingers, which are also good, but chicken fingers are chicken fingers. :) The wait/bar staff are really friendly but I'm not sure if that's because a friend in our group is a regular at this establishment or if the pub is really this friendly. I'd like to assume it's the latter because every time I've been here they've been great and I haven't encountered any problems. So if you ever do make your way to the east end and find yourself in Whitby, make a stop in at the Royal Oak."}
{"text":"Over the years I haven't come to expect much from the original Royal Oak's in Ottawa, but figured I'd give one a try in the GTA and have to say I was less then pleased by the experience.  Let me ask you this. When you order a drink, should it take 20 minutes to arrive? Should a burger take another 30 minutes? Thats how long we waited, mind you we weren't in a rush to get anywhere, but still.   It's a shame, because the Royal Oaks used to be great places for food, but that was many years ago  Food for thought"}
{"text":"Big and a bit corporate, but first rate food and service makes for a good spot!  The Royal oak is a Franchise and opened in June 2010 with more of a restaurant than pub feel as it is quite open and big, rather than cozy. They do however have a solid menu of gastro style pub grub without deep frying everything and whatever I have tried so far has been excellent ( Really loved the lamb burger).   They also have a big patio which looks over a \"lovely\" view of Thickson Rd. traffic..LOL.. but it is outside and very airy.  Cheers"}
{"text":"The Royal Oak is located just East of Taunton and Garden near the Target plaza. My boyfriend and I came here for dinner after some running around in the area.  A lot of people in my circles go to the Royal Oak solely for drinking. It's a nice looking and well located pub but I'd never been so we decided to try it out. On Mondays, they have a wing special, 1lb for $6.99, which is a good deal when 1lb is normally $11.99, so we ended up getting 2lb to split, 1lb honey garlic and the other Thai, along with an order of spicy fries.  It wasn't too long until our food came out and I was pretty pleased with the portions. Not only are the wings large and breaded, they're not ALL breading. There's a really good amount of meat on these wings! The thai had a nice bite to them and the honey garlic were quite tasty as well. But those fries... good lord those fries... I would come back here JUST for those fries! Waffle cut spicy fries served with the same garlicky dipping sauce as the wings, I couldn't stop eating them. Not only do I love waffle cut fries, because they're just better than any other fry out there, but the spice and sauce was perfection.   The service was good, we could have used a drink refill near the end of our meal but our server didn't' come back until we were done. My only complaint here is that in the evenings, all the windows on the west side of the restaurant make it super bright when the sun is setting. i came here for drinks about two weeks ago and had to move because I couldn't see the people sitting across from me. Blinds would be a good thing!  Overall, this was a good pub meal and we'll be back to try out more of their menu in the future. The price was right and the food was good!"}
{"text":"So, not so busy (only 1/3 capacity) but waited 45 min for three apps. The waitress was apologetic but there's really no excuse for such slow service. Apps were hot and good but not outstanding, just ok. Won't be back."}
{"text":"The food was delicious here!  I got the chicken fingers and sweet potato fries. The ranch and the chipotle mayo sides were really good, its like they made them in-house. My friend got the buffalo chicken sandwich and poutine which was great. She's a poutine-aficionado so for her to say its amazing, it must be.  Service was agood. The waitress was pleasant and attentive."}
{"text":"The royal oak has good food but the service is lacking. You shouldn't have to flag a waitress to get a refill. Loud pub, just servers need work thats my only complaint"}
{"text":"For a drink and watching sports this place is great....but most of the food is subpar, most offerings are not fresh and you can tell it's from frozen.  I hope the owner turns the menu around because they have a great location and an amazing patio, now the food has to catch up."}
{"text":"Markets itself as a British pub. It isn't. However, if you want a Canadian bar serving Canadian bar food and North American beer, this is a good place to come. Food is ok, not bad for the price, and service is friendly and efficient. There's a decent size patio which is nice on a summer's day, but the noise from Taunton Road can be quite disturbing."}
{"text":"It's a Canadian Pub with an British feel.  Not quite an authentic pub.  With State&Main sharing the retail mall, I guess this is the more Public House of the two. The place wasn't all that busy when I was there...at peak Lunch hour, however, it still is the winter break.  I get the feeling that it's mainly a night hang out though. They have the standard mess of brews from all the major players and of things, they did not have Innis and Gunn!  Shock...Horror...it will be available for Rob Burns day though!  Whatever. I had the steak and ale pie.  You know what, I haven't had one in a looooooooong time and I liked it!  Surprised eh?  I know it was Fish Friday but I felt like some soup baked in a pastry.  My guest had the fish though it looked like a healthy chunk of fish with gravied chips. All in all, a nice to place to hang out.  The service was attentive and good.  I have a place to go if I'm somehow in Whitby again.  Cheers!"}
