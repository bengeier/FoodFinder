{"text":"Fun! Came a long way and was pleasantly surprised to find a fun local bar!  Bartender, Kris, was very friendly and eager to ensure a good time for 7 girls from the city. This place was memorable and the jukebox was fun!"}

{"text":"Best local dive bar I've been to in awhile! Great service, great drinks and great music! Chris the bartender was awesome!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here as they were advertising that they were open for breakfast.  There were a couple of guys at the bar drinking, but no one else in the \"restaurant\" portion.  First of all, it took 40 minutes to get the breakfast food.  The scrambled eggs that I ordered cooked \"soft\" were brown, dry and had a weird spice on them like some kind of seasoning salt. Inedible. Plus, the cost was not competitive with other restaurants in the area which serve breakfast."}
{"text":"Not really sure what this place is.   
It's a bar
It's a Internet cafe.
It has a stripper pole but no strippers in sight.



FYI - Cash only at this joint."}
