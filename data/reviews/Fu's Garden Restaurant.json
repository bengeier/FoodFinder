{"text":"Tried this place out tonight, delicious! They opened a month ago. Very friendly service, fresh food. Everything we got was great! 

Chili chicken #74 (you can get dry or with gravy - we got both, preferred with gravy). Also got green beans #125, Hakka sweet chow mein #50, and steamed rice. We were given 2 hot sauces - the red one was spicy but the clear with hot peppers was super spicy!!! If you cannot handle spice, don't try this one. It will burn your intestines. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere! We'll be back... it comes second only to our faves in the north and east ends of Toronto: Kim Kim and Frederic's."}
{"text":"THE best Hakka food in GTA west. Flavorful, perfectly seasoned, and delicious. I personally recommend the chili chicken, chili shrimp, and Manchurian fried rice. 
The owners are Hakka from India. They are very polite and friendly. The prices are reasonable and the restaurant is clean."}
{"text":"We were a few minutes away and were really craving something spicy and perhaps a nice hot soup. Searched and found this place and it fitted our needs. 

So on the night of Saturday we reach the plaza, which does not have any restaurants and mostly has stores or offices that were closed, but the parking lot was full. Towards the end there is a Bingo place, that probably explained it partially. Had to park very far and walk on a windy cold night in a snow covered lot.

The restaurant not busy and were seated. Quickly ordered a medium Hot N Sour Soup, a Vegetarian Hakka Chowmein which we had to replace the noodles from regular to rice as the regular noodles had eggs. All the Indian Hakka restaurants have egg free noodles as Indian vegetarians don't consider eggs as vegetarian. Also ordered a perennial favourite Vegetarian Manchurian.  

We rate all Hakka restaurants if they can make, Veg Manchurian and Hot N Sour Soup. On both counts, the restaurant did a poor job. The Soup did not taste Hakka style, it tasted more like traditional Chinese Hot N Sour Soup. The Vegetarian Manchurian was poorly done as well. The fritters tasted really different and the sauce very minimal and red rather than the Soy Sauce coloured gravy at Hakka Restaurants.  The noodles I could not blame because on our saying they changed the noodles. However the dish was a write off. 

I am not sure this restaurant can call itself Hakka. Very poor food. The costs were low, the service was good. Food was a big letdown."}
{"text":"Had a nice family dinner out. I have driven past Fu's Garden since it opened. In reading the 2 reviews that were posted and checking out the pictures, we decided to give it a try. We were great as soon as we came in and found a table for the 4 of us. The owner and staff were very pleasant. Water was brought to our table right away along with the required place   settings. We browsed the menu and placed our order. The food was all brought at a fairly quick and steady pace. We enjoyed all of it. We will definitely go again and recommend it to others. Thanks for a nice dinner out."}
{"text":"Great food and authentic Hakka cuisine. Not many options near Etobicoke for Chinese food. The Chilli chicken was very good :) service was excellent and my family and I enjoyed our dinner. I definitely recommend eating here if you are looking for some tasty authentic Chinese food."}
{"text":"Ahhh how I love Hakka and how happy I was to see a new place Open not far from me ....
Woa is me ...you know that old woa is me saying !
I wish I could give it a better rating cause the server or owner was very pleasant and nice !! Everything came out quick although it was empty !
The food was bland I got the chilli chicken lunch special and a hot and sour soup my friends got pakoras and a sweet and sour chicken 
And again bland not much flavor .
The price is decent and place is clean just needs more Hakka spices and flavor .
I'll just have to take the extra 10 minuets drive to my favorite place but how I wish this one would have worked out !

{"text":"I was happy to see a Hakka place open so close to my work.  The food is delicious and the portions are big for a great price.  The staff is friendly...it has a family vibe"}
{"text":"We have tried a lot of Hakka places in Toronto, and I am happy to say that this was one of the good ones. Glad its close to Etobicoke too! 
We had Hakka Chowmein, Chilli Chicken (extra crispy) and one with extra Gravy, Manchurian Fried rice with chicken/shrimp, Chicken corn soup, Chicken Pakora and garlic broccoli/ mushrooms. Everything was great, Pakora and Hakka Noodles being my favourite. Prices are decent and service was great. Chef stayed back after 10 pm to serve us and provide fresh hot meal. 

I would go back here for sure."}
