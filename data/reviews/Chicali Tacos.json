{"text":"Gabriel is awesome. He was responsive, professional, and well priced. He was able to accommodate all our requests for our party.  His tacos were AMAZING. The meat was flavorful, the rice was out of this world, and his salsas (all 3 of them) were perfect.  He had all the sides you could want.  This was our menu: carne asada, Chicken, rice, beans, onions/cilantro, 3 salsas, limes, cabbage, grilled onions [we added this to our order], corn and flour tortillas with the option for melted cheese on them or not.  Truly the highlight of our party.  I would highly recommend Chicali tacos, you won't be disappointed!!!   Thanks Gabriel!   We are still eating all the leftovers and loving every bite."}

{"text":"Gabriel was amazing! He was so kind, and a wonderful cook. We loved the care he took in creating the food for us for the Christmas Party. His set up was great, and he took the time to explain how he'd be keeping the Vegan food away from the cooking area for the meat. The taste was amazing. My friend with a gluten intolerance was a bit hesitant because sometimes the spices have gluten in them, but she said she felt great, which was a sign they use high-quality spices in their food. I would definitely book them again for any large gathering."}
{"text":"Gabriel catered for my friend's daughter's first birthday and the food was INCREDIBLE!!! He set everything up in the backyard and cooked up the most delicious tacos ever!!! We took his business card to use him for my son's first birthday in September. I'm not sure yet about his prices, but for food this good and taking the responsibility off of our own backs for cooking the food for our party, I imagine it's worth every penny!"}
{"text":"If you need the perfect catering service for your event look no further than Chicali Tacos.  I do declare that These Tacos Are the BEST.  The taste of the food matches the presentation and you can sauce them up anyway you like.  Mouth water steak,  delicious chicken and saucy rainbow veggies this food is INCREDIBLE!!! Everything is perfectly seasoned.  And if you still want to make your own masterpiece plenty of toppings are provided. Don't forget the rice and beans.    Gabriel aka DJ Taco is full of laughs, highly personable and professional to boot. He blends in perfectly to any atmosphere.  Thanks for all the great food.  Can't wait to see you again!!!"}
