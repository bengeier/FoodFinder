{"text":"Had an iced dirty chai and a cactus shaped macaroon, and it was amazing! Baristas were extremely friendly too. Atmosphere is nice and modern, plenty of natural light. Would highly recommend if you're looking for a switch up from Starbucks."}
{"text":"Stopped by about 8 AM for some coffee and a snack. Place was not really busy, one new customer every 10 minutes or so. I had a so-so espresso which might have been better in a ceramic cup, wife had a very good hot latte. We both had the quiche which was ok but only $5 a piece. Cashier was friendly but she was the only visible employee. Had to ask for napkins as there were none to be seen. Not sure why I bother leaving $$$ in the tip jar since so many people do not even bother saying thanks. Maybe they are wealthy and do not need my measly $2. I would like to see a better selection of food here, a few cupcakes, one quiche option, and unseen bagels/donuts are not going to bring in hungry people. This could be a 5 star coffee house with just a few improvements. Lets start with ceramic cups for people dining in."}
{"text":"In A Nutshell:

-Driftwood Coffee is a brand new local coffee shop in Peoria.
-It exudes minimalism 100%, however don't let that fool you.
-Their Nitro Cold Brew is one of the best I've had.
-It packs a caffeinated punch much like a Vietnamese coffee does, but better taste.
-The service was very friendly too.
-I like to collect t-shirts & ended up purchasing a tan colored one (the cotton is so so soft!)

Overall, they have a punch card so I will plan on coming by often when I visit my dad."}
{"text":"The coffee was good! I got an iced chi latte. The place was really cute and the guy there was super nice and helpful!"}
{"text":"Good to see the west side of town get a good local coffee shop. Coffee was great and the aesthetic is on point. Good place to work and bring a laptop."}
{"text":"Nothing like sippin' on a good latte in an aesthetically pleasing atmosphere!

My husband and I love discovering and trying out new coffee shops. We came across Driftwood Coffee, when we were in the Peoria area and decided to check it out.

After one visit, we can say it is definitely one of the best coffee shops in Arizona!

We had drip coffee and a dirty chai (chai latte with 2 shots of espresso) - both were great! And to top it off, the chai latte had a cinnamon stick on top?! I've been to tons of coffee shops in LA (where I'm from), around Arizona, New York, and many other states and none have topped their chai with a cinnamon stick. So it's a nice, little unique twist on their chai!

I'm a sucker for clean, modern, minimalistic decor. Driftwood is all about that. It's rare to come across in Arizona too. This is probably the 3rd coffee shop I've encountered in the area with minimal decor. So this place is perfect if you love minimal coffee shops!

Also, they have a walk up window near the entrance of the shop. So if you're in a hurry, no need to walk inside, you can order outside, grab and go. Although if I were you, I'd go inside because of the lovely atmosphere haha.

Overall, this coffee shop is 5 stars all around!
Absolutely perfect for working, meeting with someone, having coffee with a small or big group, etc.
If we're ever in Peoria, we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great coffee good service and trendy looking place. I liked it will definitely recommend it to friends and family."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a coffee, sit and read, or have a small meeting. They have a round table and sometimes you can have a random conversation in the shared space. And those cactus macaroons in the picture are D-lish!"}
{"text":"As soon as you see the building, youre gonna say \"woah!\". The building is really aesthetically pleasing compared to the rest of the buildings. You definitely could take a few instagram worthy pictures outside!

The interior design is so nice. Their menu is painted onto the wall, the furniture and the tables are all nice and they have a few shirts, candles, and little things that you can buy as well!

I tried their espresso and their matcha latte and they are amazing and smooth. Beats starbucks plus theyre a local business!

Will be coming back!"}
{"text":"In town for the weekend so as usual searched for a local coffee spot rather than going to the corporate giants who often give me drinks I don't love anyway.

As everyone else has said, the space itself it sleek and aesthetic. Parking was a bit difficult because there seems to be a few churches in the area and it was a Sunday. From the reviews and website I did not realize this shop was connected to a church, which I have no problem with but walked in and they were blaring the church sermons (if that's the right word). Also no problem there but it was unexpected and so loud that everyone was talking super loud to compensate. From other reviews it sounds like they usually play music so this may just be a Sunday thing?

Ordered a chai latte from under the \"espresso bar\" part of the menu but seem to have just been given a chai flavored milk with no espresso so I unfortunately spent almost $5 for a drink I did not finish. Maybe a miscommunication but still a bummer since I just grabbed it and had to run and could not get it fixed.

The barista was super sweet. I would probably give it another chance but I unfortunately don't live here so it seems it'll be a one and done for me."}
{"text":"We had the cold brew coffee. The coffee was very good. The owner was very helpful and pleasant. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"For as long as I can remember, there has been nothing to remember about Old Town Peoria. Now, Driftwood is doing something different on the West Side, in the best way possible. Driftwood brings a surge of \"cool\" to an area in desperate need for something of the like.
   Coffee. Even though the beans rotate from different roasters, the quality never changes. I frequently get a honey vanilla latte, or honey lavender. Driftwood has quenched the desire for a great lavender latte that doesn't overpower and taste like dish soap, so kudos. 
   If you're in the area, and even if you aren't, you should make Driftwood a priority. The friendly staff will greet you and make sure you find the drink you are looking for.
   Go to Driftwood, for your health."}
{"text":"Love this little spot in Peoria. Keep up the good work! Peoria could be so awesome if they had more places like this. This place is an awesome addition to downtown. Staff is friendly and tea was good. Their pastries looked yummy! I can't wait to try the honey lavender latte next!"}
{"text":"My husband and I just checked out Driftwood Coffee for the first time. It was everything I hoped it would be! Clean and inviting, with a simple menu that any coffee lover  would appreciate :) My cappuccino was perfect! The best I've had in a long time. Thanks Driftwood!"}
{"text":"Amazing coffee place! The workers are very kind and helpful. The prices weren't too high, and the drinks were wonderful. I would definitely recommend this place for a fun hang out with your friends!"}
{"text":"Today I took a little drive to Peoria to check out Driftwood Coffee. Located in old town Peoria across from the Peoria Central School Museum or 85th Ave and Jefferson to make it easy . Bad for my wallet since I foresee coming often, but great for me because this place is fantastic! Why have I not been here before and why did it take me so long to get over here to check it out? Locally owned by two guys Luke and Lance who happened to both be there today, outstanding customer service, so friendly and offered us great recommendations so I did what I do best and tried all I could lol. We ordered a Black Mango Tea which was phenomenal without adding any sweetener of any kind, a honey vanilla latte iced and again amazing. It was such a pretty color. Literally picture perfect. I also got a hot chocolate for my son. He wasn't as much of a fan, but I thought it was perfect and not over sweetened like so many places. Last but definitely not least a cute cactus macaroon and a muffin. What's the point to life if you don't try all the desserts ? The building itself is cool. Great photo ops, walk up order window for those in a hurry and on the go. The inside has great vibes the second you walk in.  Music, great art, couch and tables with plenty of space for working out of the office, and with the menu painted on the wall which made it very easy to read. Lastly a great feature wall with open shelving where items such as coffee mugs, candles, coffee grounds, and shirts may be purchased. Such a breath of fresh air this place is and I didn't have to drive 40 minutes through downtown traffic to get to it! Thanks guys for a great first experience!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! They asked what I normally like and recommended to awesome drinks for my wife and I. If you come in definitely try the honey lavender late and the vanilla late. The people that work here are really nice and welcoming and it's a cool environment. We will be definitely coming back on a regular basis."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. With a great atmosphere and vibe, it surpassed my expectations as a coffee shop that is just opening up. I have been coming to coffee shops for a while and I have branched out in my regular ordering while coming here. I have never asked a coffee shop to surprise me with a drink until my frequent visits to this coffee haven. I have had 5-6 different drinks out of here and have been pleasantly surprised each time. Today I am trying something called the Hemingway. It may become one of my favorite drinks. I would highly recommend giving it a try if you're looking for a minty espresso to surprise your pallet."}
{"text":"Highly recommend. If you're stuck on your order the barista is always super helpful, just ask for their recommendation!"}
{"text":"Great spot, clean, and most importantly, awesome nitro....need I say more? As a native to the westside it's awesome finally seeing local coffee houses like this pop up!"}
{"text":"Great little shop in old Peoria - finally good coffee  in this area! 
Check out the different coffees from multiple roasters and try the new espresso tonic for a refreshing summertime hack. 
Worth the drive!"}
{"text":"I've been coming since it opened in February and I've been nothing satisfied with the products I've been offered. Great little coffee shop in downtown Peoria is exactly what we needed"}
{"text":"FINALLY a quality coffee shop in the Peoria/Glendale area. Very knowledgeable and friendly staff. Multiple brew methods to choose from with a lighter roast than those other guys, cough cough Starbucks. Stoked to have Driftwood in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"This place is alright, you can definitely tell it's new. Don't get me wrong, there is a ton of potential here and maybe I just went on an off day, but the Internet was really slow and they had no food. The environment is great, it's neat and cute and the people working were very nice, but they still have some room for improvement."}
{"text":"Drip coffee is perfectly brewed. Lots of body, not weak! Also, it's very fresh. Tiny caramel cheesecake is the perfect accompaniment. Very exciting to have a great non-chain coffee shop in the west valley."}
{"text":"It's a great environment and the cashier did a nice job of explaining the drinks. They featured a Hemingway (espresso, tonic water, mint) and it was delicious. Will be back for sure"}
{"text":"Very beautiful place the white walls makes everything pop, the only thing that stood out at me was that it was a Saturday morning and they didn't open until 8?  A coffee shop, i would imagine, opens early... so i had to wait outside for 15 minutes to order and I got a cup of water with a shot of espresso poured in ... i will try this place again since i want to like the since it's right around the block from me ..."}
{"text":"So cool! Great neighborhood coffee shop with good espresso and press coffee. Count me as a regular"}
{"text":"First visit of many more to follow. Their espresso is very good. 
Being in downtown Peoria is s big plus as I try to spend my dollars locally. And being a local owned place is an even bigger plus. You will not be disappointed with their espresso."}
