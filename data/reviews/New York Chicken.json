{"text":"I went in tonight (against every fibre in my being) because I had been sick in bed all day and just wanted something fast and cheap. First impressions are lasting, and, as such, I'll never go back. Among the litany of complaints: the counter person barely spoke English and knew nothing about the menu; the fries I was served were cold; when said counter person went to get someone else's food, she barehanded everything (no plastic glove) despite everyone being able to see what she was doing.   To add insult to injury, the place was generally messy and the two employees were rather rude to a few customers right in front of me (the customers were being difficult, but still...).   I will never go back to this place. I will walk on the other side of Bloor so as to not have to ever walk by this place again."}
{"text":"The food is sub par ...super greasy and  had an odd almost dirty taste... I dont think it will last ...even if it is cheap i wont be back yuck!"}
{"text":"The Toronto Lover system: 5 stars = Must visit! 4 stars = Really good. I take my friends here. 3 stars = Somewhat worth it... if you have nowhere better to go. 2 stars = Below average. Attend only when necessary. 1 star = Do not visit!  Exactly what you expect. Greasy fast food at major chain prices. Disinterested staff serving you deep fried \"whatever.\" It's really a shame this arrived just as the neighbourhood was trying to polish up a bit.  1 star"}
{"text":"This is some good fried chicken for great prices. In a neighborhood where I can easily walk the extra few minutes down Bloor for Popeyes or down Dufferin to KFC I choose to go here. Also the staff has always been super nice to me anyways. I will go back for sure."}
{"text":"A KFC moving into the neighbourhood would put this place out of business fast.    The chicken isn't really spiced in any way that makes it particularly good.  It was just okay, but it's hard to make BAD fried chicken. The fries are good however.  No wet wipes to clean your hands up afterward, which I think is simply silly.  A serve yourself soda machine but no free refills, odd as the two usually go together. I believe there was no washroom, which I didn't know you were allowed to do, and when you're eating fried chicken its nice to wash your hands if they won't give you wet wipes.  Also the serving trays don't leave you room to place the bones. It's missing a lot of small things that make fast food a comfortable experience.  There a lot of cheap food options in the neighbourhood that are much better. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"If you really feel like fried chicken keeping walking to KFC or Popeyes..they aren't competing on quality here, just price. Menu is limited and the ambience makes you feel greasy even before you've tasted the food."}
{"text":"Fast, cheap, and good chicken. Fries and slaw not quite up to snuff, but at the price only an idiot would complain: $3.99 for a two-piece meal with fries and a fountain drink. Slaw is extra, only $1.29 for a large single-serving, if you insist on something resembling a vegetable. Best to do take out; under $10 for eight pieces of perfectly good crispy, greasy fried chicken. It's not like you're going to want to hang around for the atmosphere - although the clientele can be pretty entertaining in their bizarre way..."}
