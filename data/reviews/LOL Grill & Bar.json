{"text":"A couple friends and I went here a few days ago because: 
1. It's one of the only places within walking distance that has a terrace
2. The first warm/sunny day of the season!
3. New restaurant, ooh :)

So I'd looked up the menu on their website before and had a general idea of what they had. But lo-and-behold, when I get there the menu is completely different (nothing like the website), prices had changed and they didn't even have the same things. Maybe it's because we were sitting outside?

Beer wasn't priced too bad ($7/pint for Heineken), but the sangria was $11. I asked if they could do a pitcher, but when our waitress came back and confirmed they could do it, she had forgotten to ask how much it was. Ended up being $35 for ONE liter of sangria. I haven't ordered sangria here in Toronto, but usually a pitcher is two liters and more like $25-27, probably less? Anyways...

Mains were expensive, so we decided to go with a couple apps. Regular beef sliders were $14, which I ordered (I assumed there would be 5), and the philly cheesesteak version of these was $35, which I found odd, since even a regular cheesesteak isn't that much.
My boyfriend ordered nachos for $12 and our friend ordered three skewers for $5.99. 

We get our drinks - good. When our food arrives we are all surprised.
-I get only 3 sliders/$14 (which had bacon in them and were very good, despite the exorbitant price). 
-My boyfriend's nachos/$12 was a heap of off-brand broken Doritos, half-melted/unmelted shredded cheese topped with a glob of sour cream, salsa, a sparse sprinkling of dry jalapenos and a chickpea (yes, a chickpea).
-Our friend's skewers were small, sickly and full of fat. The spice mix was the same for all of the skewers (chicken, lamb and beef) and were I him I would haven been more satisfied to get two of those skewers with much larger chunks for $5.99.

All of this cost us roughly $50 without tax. I couldn't help but feel cheated and was regretting not going to some of the very good asian restaurants in the area for a fraction of the price.
Would not recommend this place unless you have the money to burn."}
{"text":"I don't really write reviews anymore for Yelp, but my family kept asking and reminding me to write one for this place. To warn you. And I agree, you only have to know one thing: DON'T GO HERE!!!!!!!!!!

The service is so bad, it's funny. Maybe that's why it's called LOL. As soon as you walk in, they're thinking \"LOL GOT 'EM\" because you're paying them to cook your own fishballs over a cool-ish spinning grill. Yeah, fishballs because half the menu (ie. the good stuff) doesn't exist. And they think eggplant is called zucchini. Oh yeah and the mantou were mouldy.

I could go on and give you more examples... But there were too many and I've already started to block this whole experience from of my memory.

Yelp needs the option of 0 stars. This establishment is a prime example of why."}
{"text":"I don't even wanna rate it one star! I'd give it a negative. The floors are sticky! Seriously, my flip flops were literally sticking on and off and making this sticky noise. Gross! I ordered a pineapple juice and it came with a few pieces of \"fresh\" pineapples... I swear they've gone bad. I spit it out right away! The taste is soo wrong! Then, the table is greasy and the grill... I don't know if it is supposed to be like this? But there are grease and oil on the bottom as always. They don't clean it. It's there when u sit down. Seriously? And the waiters ask me to write down orders myself. Sure. I can read Chinese but I can't write it! I had to ask my husband to write down everything! And where is the air conditioning? It's 28 degrees outside and humidity is high! They just open the doors to patio and that's it... This is a grill! It's hot and greasy! We need AC!"}
{"text":"I dont normally write reviews and rarely negative ones but this one needs to be stated.

Terrible service, server cant even speak english. Half the menu is \"sold out\" and only takes cash

This is my first time leaving ayce not full."}
{"text":"NEVER in my life been served by a server with one hand holding my order and the other hand sipping a Starbucks Frappuccino.... the service is beyond ridiculous of mainland China people without any manners...  (only one of the female servers that worked mostly in the kitchen and take-outs was well mannered and friendly) 
Just shows poor management of any training to their servers.

BEWARE. Food is limited..  I went in on a Friday night and the place was barely occupied (4 tables including mine) My friend and I ordered the all you can eat.
 Notice they don't list the price on the website or store menu( probably do this purposely to attract customer) and the items are different from the website... 
  it's $29.99 per adult on limited orders.Barely halfway through our orders, we asked the server what's up with the missing items, and finally informa us half the items are \"Sold Out \". I found that amusing as 4  tables on a Friday night and the kitchen is sold out on half the all you can eat items ?... Also notice they don't have any of the listed desserts on the menu ( green tea , vanilla, mango , etc all sold out )  instead they served us a cheap strawberry ice cream which wasn't even listed on the desert menu lol 

If you hapoened to be eating here, i suggest to ask which items are available before placing your first order but I strongly advise you to not eat here as the 
Food overall was greasy and nothing but cheap all you can eat fatty meat. nothing special except the fancy interior design..don't be fooled by the decent decor. 

Will not be coming here EVER again."}
{"text":"Whenever I drive around or on the bus commuting, I have seen this huge robot in front of LOL many times.  I always wonder what kind of establisment it is.  When a friend from school asked me to go, I was really excited until I actually visit the place.  I really have to say that, it is rare to have so many parking on the back side of restaurant on Yonge.  I didn't count, but there are more than 20 parkings.  However, they really need to fix the pavement since there is a large pothole on the parking entrance. And it was a one way street with slanted parking, so I had to back out of the parking lot when I was leaving.  

When I entered the restaurant, I thought couple of the people were servers and they were actually customers.  How embarassing?  I couldn't really tell who is the servers since nobody greeted me.  But I did take a close up picture of the robot.  

When I found a server five minutes later, she was really polite and sat me down on a table with rotisserie bbq.  The cooking device looked really interesting.  But when I was told that, they didn't have food from half of the menu, I was thoroughly disappointed.  My favourite  food chicken wing all sold out, chicken skin sold out, Taiwanese sausage sold out, etc.  Too many to remember.  And when the servers put the orders to our tables, they didn't know whose stuffs is whose.  We are a party of seven, so we always needed to move our food around to the correct side.  And I think they sold out of nestea too.  I was grilling away the skewers on the rotisserie; however, the food were not trimmed to the correct size or they were placed off centre of the skewers.  Some part of the skeweres would be overcooked and some part would still be a little raw.  And when they put the coal into the grill, it would be so hot that all the food burned really quickly without thoroughly cooking the inside.  And after a while, the coal would become too cold and it didn't cooked our last several lamb skewers.   Yikes!  And the washroom was just not sanitary at all.  There is no soap and no way to dry off your hands.  I am glad that I didn't get food poisoning.  Thank God! I wonder how the chefs prepare the food inside the kitchen.  

What was more awkward is that they didn't change their operating hours on their website, or yelp or google or even on the back door of their restaurant.  The server randomly told us they are closing at 12am instead of 2am.

The food was okay, but I wouldn't come back again for sure.  The one star was for the cool metallic robot outside only."}
{"text":"They were extremely slow, the taste of lamb and shrimp was terrible and some of the lamb went bad, they had to switch something fresh.... It took almost 40 mins to get our ordered chicken wings.... Live singer was terrible too.,,,, can't believe this is so called Chinese style ??......"}
{"text":"We went here today and it took a while for us to get our water and menu. They acknowledge that they are opening up and were sorry for the mix ups. We ordered one pound of beef and one pound of lamb. The first round the meat brought to our table was not ours. The salad, fries, and wings/fries took a while to come. I believe the kitchen is doing its part to push out the food but they need more servers to attend to the tables and bring out the food. The charcoal person was great adding charcoal but can see they would need more people to bring our charcoal to tables. We asked for our smores but they didn't come until after when we got fed up and asked for our bill, and by that time our charcoal was done already, so we didn't bother to have the smores despite being asked if we got everything. We also had to ask for our spices and keep checking in to see if our food was coming. The place has potential bit they need to fix the logistics with the wait staff."}
{"text":"First time here, my friend has tried to convince me to go to another places for the whole week.  I insisted to try out this place and ended up we have had a great experience.  

The atmosphere was not bad, nice place to chat and eat.  They were not busy today even on a Saturday which was surprising.  I kind of know why they got some bad reviews.  My friend came 30 mins early and the waitress told him there was a 2 hour seating limit.  There was only total 5 tables occupied and my friend didn't even order anything yet.  When we arrived, after we placed first order, waitress told us any left over food, will be charged $2 per 3 skewers.  I guess that how all Chinese owned restaurants are.  

It was fun cooking the skewers on the table, must try experience.  Food was great too, good varieties. The only advice is if they really have a 2 hours limit, best is to have 2 person per table/grill.  It takes some time to cook the skewers, each grills you can cook around 13 skewers at a time.  The only disappointment was marshmallows were sold out after we ordered total 6 pieces, all ice cream (4 kinds) and pudding, I should say all dessert were sold out.

Overall we had a great experience, will definitely recommend to friends anand will come back again."}
{"text":"terrible restaurant. must be from the top down.
overcharged and would never ever go back.  they seem sketchy. inexperienced and do not treat ppl with good customer service or respect."}
{"text":"It used to be so good when it first opened. It wasn't all you can eat before, so their value and quality is way higher than now. I used to love this place, they had the live singers and grill on stone dishes. I don't know what happened, one day they changed to AYCE bbq and they ruined their brand. To be honest, they are more like a 2 stars."}
{"text":"I have been to this location twice. The first time was the first week it opened. I went there on a date and we had a great time, the servers were friendly, the food was great. I rather enjoyed my experience and the giant mech was pretty awesome. 

The second time I went there was yesterday, and it was the worst experience I have ever had, I walked in around 5, and waited, and waited, and waited. it wasn't until about 15 minutes later that I saw someone come out the back, but they weren't a employee as far as I could tell and they were a customer, a minute or two later another person went and joined the first person. 

I waited longer still, until finally a server came walking out of the back and came over and threw a drink menu at me and told me to write down my order and she will be right back. Not only had a i waited 20 minutes just to see and employee of this establishment she tells me to do her job for her? 

So I looked at the two menus, one for drinks and the other for food. having been there before I was looking forward to some wings, and oysters. the first item I see on the menu is heart, brains, and it got progressively worst. The establishment apparently rebranded itself from an all you can eat bbq to a make you wait around until they are ready to serve you Korean bbq place.

After being disgusted I decided to leave. I went down the street to another restaurant to where i was greeted at the door, shown a table and treated with respect. I had a very enjoyable meal there where the atmosphere was pleasant. 

No Manners
No Customer Service
Rude
Long waiting periods
If I could rate this place lower than 1 I would. Never have a seen a place that had great character turn into a absolute shit hole."}
{"text":"Cool place for kbbq experience. Nice funny atmosphere inside! Loved the neon blue ambiance. Grilling of food wait tine = awesome chat with friends.

Food was good although we couldn't order one or two things because it was out of stock. 

Yogurt was absolutely cute in a jar and delicious, but would not eat the dessert pudding or ice cream as they were frozen hard with ice chunks in it."}
{"text":"The place advertises itself as a  restaurant with oysters, cocktails, and korean bbq. Their menu online is fabulous, so is their robot sculpture at the front door. I decided to check it out, and was very disappointed.  
It smells of kerosene, the tables are sticky, and dirty, the insert for the bbq has dirty oil and water, and something looked like insects(?) floating in it. It was a very unpleasant experience! The menu looks nothing like the one they have on their website, so it is only bbq options now. It is badly written, the headings are in Korean with no English translation. We ended up not ordering anything, and left to find something where we would feel comfortable ordering food."}
{"text":"i probably won't go back...  overall it was a little disappointing depending on what you order.  The wings and fries were pretty good.  I went during a Monday, so  Malpeque oysters were only $1 each.  The pricing for the wings, drinks, oysters were all pretty decent.  This place is pretty clean & they have a pretty looking robot that shoots lasers.  The environment was decent.  This place mainly sells skewers.  I have had much better skewers in my experience.  If you are looking to BBQ your own food over a charcoal metal machine, this place has it.  Very few places have this, so I was pretty excited to try it.  The quality of the skewers weren't that great... The portions were small but that's because the price is lower than many other places averaging on $2-$3 per skewer.  The weird part was the menu... they have a Chinese menu where you can order the skewers on a per skewer basis...however on the English menu you had to order on a per pound skewer basis.  I think both menus should be the same to be fair.  (I ordered on the Chinese menu only so the pricing i am stating is based on the Chinese menu.)"}
{"text":"Walked in here at 10:30, looked interesting, but they wouldn't take us in, said kitchen was closed and wouldn't even let us sit at the bar,

Came back the next day, the lamb skewers were really good and fairly priced. Same price as other places, but it's cooked on charcoal and the skewers \"turn on its own on a pulley system\" so I would prefer to come here instead of other places.

Beef, chicken knees, shrimp, were ok

the lamb skewers were reordered 3 times 

But place is still too new and waiters and waitresses need more experience. Service was slow, took 10 minutes for our pitcher to come and items ordered were missing

3.5 stars, would come back to see if their lamb skewers are still good

******* updating my review,

Sat here for a while thinking we were going to chill after dinner instead of bar hopping 

They ended up being sold on marshmallows, sausages, muttons, skors, fish balls, pretty much felt like they were sold out of everything...

2 stars 

********** updating my review again

All the items which were out of stock were all on the bill and when we checked with the waitress, she was clueless

1 star"}
{"text":"What just happened on a monday evening at this place!? The one star's for the unique cooking station,and roomy table for two compared with other places that stick you eating off  a postage stamp. Our server had no idea what meat was which.For a Korean place,NO beef ribs in sight, odd.They had literally a whole portion unavailable from their menu. I am not expecting Katsuya ,or Sushi Ye standards,but for around $25 ,you can do a LOT better,even paying a bit more for it. Problem,I didn't know the area,and just wanted to eat before heading back to the hotel. Cash or debit, but this isn't clearly listed BEFORE you dine."}
{"text":"What I can say is, good quality, good environment, and good service. 
they brought us the food while we are writing down the thing that we want, services are excellent! we came in at 1pm, but it actually opens at 3pm, but the owner of the restaurant still serve us?and they got everything that we want. The servers are friendly, as well as the chef, yes, the chef. He came out to give us the fresh food, since there is only us, not busy.
Definitely gonna come back."}
