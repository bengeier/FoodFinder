{"text":"The man who owns the place is super nice. He's friendly to my kids, and my son LOVES the rice pudding. I like that it's quiet here and there's free wi-fi too."}
{"text":"Finally able to stop in. I tend to be fairly nocturnal which means places that serve at dusk or later. 

Place has a delightful charm and prices are excellent for what you get. I ordered a shot in the dark. Its coffee with an espresso shot and it was excellent. 

Did not yet try the food but took a cashew baklava home and the gf loved it. If i wasn't on no carb i would have tried some of their food. It looked appetizing and was inexpensive.

Only thing i would ask is to make better note of your sugar free syrups or other low sugar stuff. I adore when places offer unsweetened almond milk!"}
{"text":"This a great little neighborhood coffee shop. The owner is very friendly. He serves La Prima coffee, a Pittsburgh favorite. I have not tried the food, but the coffee is good."}
{"text":"Fabulous espresso, among the best in the city! Excellent coffee too! Friendly service, roomy with reading materials."}
{"text":"I had an Americano here after eating lunch up the street. The Americano was fantastic. I really enjoyed the flavor and the temperature was perfect. We enjoyed our coffees at a table near the street and found it a relaxing and calm space with a lot of natural light. I am looking forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"Nice little cozy cafe. I stop in here when I get a chance. I love their back porch for outdoor sitting. Looking forward to enjoying the weather on that porch this summer."}
{"text":"Large and lovely coffee shop with a fantastic patio! Came here as part of a local Pittsburgh foodie tour and it was a great break.

So if you are a light roast fan, unfortunately u are in for a disappointment as that is unavailable. But the Medium- dark roast isn't too bad and the coffee beans are freshly roasted so the aroma is very nice.

I'm not a massive coffee drinker and the owner was nice and kind enough to give me an off the menu Milk with just enough drip coffee to keep things interesting. 

We also got baklavas to try here - my table had x3 ladies and we decided to share -/- so split a pistachio, cashew and pecan (so the walnut is the only one I didn't try but it's also a nut that becomes rancid very quickly so I was okay to skip). 

My fave was the pecan baklava, followed by cashew and then the pistachio (the rose water in here threw the taste off for me). The view from the patio is very reminiscent of the houses found in Amsterdam/Denmark and so you get a very European feel.

Oh also great artwork on the walls as well as jewelry - basically the owner has kept aside space for local craftspeople to sell there wares. There is also a piano and I loved the eclectic variety of seating option which not only looked inviting but also where very comfy. 

I'd definitely come and hangout here if I was a local.

Yelp Review 44/2017"}
{"text":"I was here before, when it was Cannon. They served Commonplace then and it was good. With Commonplace, coffee was the focus, but now, the coffee has lost its luster. What they use now is La Prima which actually speaks very well to what Caf√© De Noir's principle is. La Prima creates classic Italian brews and that is Cafe De Noir. I actually purchased an Italian soda. S. Pellegrino water plus a bit of vanilla syrup and cream. 'Tis an effortless drink but actually kind of nice for what it is. 

Three stars for the charm of old school Italian brews (plus delicious baklava!) and the charm of a space that is quaint and beautiful. And I have a hard time giving bad reviews to genuine people who try, and accomplish what they're trying to do. I hope the customer base for these type of espresso drinks is large and rewarding for these guys because they don't deserve to be pushed under by snobs like yours truly."}
{"text":"Decent coffee and drink selection.  Nice ambiance for working.  No gluten free treats."}
{"text":"Great little shop on the strip in Brookline. Been here a few times, and just noticed there's a patio out back! Win.  Friendly owner and great coffee make it a place that I love to visit. Also, there is a lizard that lives in the front window display. FYI."}
