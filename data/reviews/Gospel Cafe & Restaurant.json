{"text":"Great, great place for our Wedding!  The photographer said  he had never seen such a great background perfect for photos. The Artist who sang loved the venue and all accessible audio equipment and available video screens!  The decor all included in $300 venue fee was of the best quality. All we had to do was show up!... Not to mention the food! Out of this world! The spicy soup was superb! Escovish Fish delicious, Jerk kitchen finger licking good, rice and peas and of course fried plantain completed the dish!  My guests loved the food and will definitely be back for more. The service was great as always! All in all a memorable event! They even allowed us to bring our own Wedding cake and served it for us with non-alcoholic champagne... of course! Thank you Lorena and Collins! (Owners of The Gospel Cafe)  We will definitely be back each anniversary!"}
{"text":"If you like Carribean Food this is the place to be. If you lime a Christian atmosphere this is definitely the place to be.   A few friends invited us to ride with them to this place in the suburbs of Toronto. We were not sure where we were exactly going but we were well pleased.  As stated it has a Distinct Christian atmosphere, which means Christian and Gospel music is played. When there are live shows or music it is Christian. There are no alcoholic drinks. It is a niche that some people appreciate.  That staff was friendly and accommodatable. The night we attended, Thursday night was Jazz Gospel and it was very classy and moving.  There was a $5 cover charge per person.  We were very pleased with our food selections. The six of us had no complaints and plan to go back very soon.  We met the owners who talked to us and explained their dreams for restaurant. We were very impressed with their sincerity and faith."}
{"text":"I went here at the request of my boyfriend for take-away, he was really in the mood for some good Caribbean food and it sounded like a good idea to me. The place was easy enough to find considering I'd never been there before, and the service was decent.  Not overly friendly, but I was acknowledged. Walking in I noticed how different this place was set up to other restaurants, as they had a little cafe-type area to the left, and a pool table/stage in front/to the right.  The whole place was very bright and clean, and had music playing softly in the background.  I didn't realize until I was leaving that it was gospel music; which in hindsight makes sense considering the restaurant name.  I ordered the large jerk entree, chicken fingers and fries, and the slushie special.  The slushie was a pina colada flavour, about 16oz for $1.00, and it tasted AMAZING.  After finishing it, I wished I had gotten another for myself before leaving the store.  The chicken fingers and fries to be honest, were horrible.  They tasted worse than something I would have ruined at home.  The chicken was the same kind as nuggets from a slimy fast food chain or low-cost frozen nuggets, and the fries were unseasoned.  For $7.99, I was extremely unimpressed.  The jerk entree my boyfriend ordered looked fantastic.  It was a huge portion (4 hefty sized legs) tons of rice and peas, with a spicy coleslaw.  I tried some of his meal, and while the jerk was too spicy for my taste everything was cooked wonderfully.  His $8.99 was hands-down worth the price, and made my meal seem worse by comparison.  He was able to eat his portion for three separate meals (lunch, dinner, lunch the following day).  My meal,  I tried eating what was left for lunch the following day, and I got about 4-bites in before I started feeling extremely sick.  Overall I would definitely go back to this place, but I would steer clear of the \"American\" dishes, as I feel the love and attention is more placed into the Caribbean-style dishes. Also: if you are sensitive to spicy food, avoid the jerk and go for the fried chicken instead.  I assume it would be just as nicely cooked, only without the spice ;-)"}
{"text":"So I decided to go here after seeing that it was a new place that opened up around the area.  Based on the success of most of the west-indie places around the area I thought that it couldn't be bad at all right?  When you go inside, you're not really sure what the deal is.  It's half cafe, half bar.  On one end you have a cafe with cakes and cafe tables; on the other end you have a stage for a band and a pool table.  Weird.  Oh, did I mention that the place is also filthy?  I'm not really a big stickler for a really clean restaurant or sparkling floors but a pair of spring rolls and some napkins underneath my feat is going a bit far.  Maybe that was the appetizer?  To give it to them, a 5.99 daily special is pretty enticing, that's what I ordered.  It was a plate of jerk chicken with coleslaw and rice & peas.  It also came with a soft drink of your choice.  It was a pretty good deal in my mind.  The chicken was dry and not really flavourful... I'd almost put it on par with chicken from metro that had been sitting out for a while.  That's about what it tasted like.  Same thing with the rice and peas.  Not exactly the best thing in the world; in fact, far from it.  Being in a plaza with pretty strong contenders, this place isn't going to win anyone over at this rate.  If you want to have some jamaican food, drive 2 minutes down the block and you'll get something way better."}
{"text":"Five stars for super delish food and super friendly owners. The decor is always beautiful for their events, and they always get the best entertainment. Totally recommended."}
