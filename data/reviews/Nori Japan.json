{"text":"Ate here three times and it was great.  Fourth time I noticed the cook had very long fingernails. He was just chopping and flipping the food on the fry plate with those long fingernails.  No gloves.   A guy with long finger nails cooking food- come on.  Something turned in my stomach and my mind at that point.  Never again going back."}
{"text":"Very delicious place to eat! The chefs special is the way to go. You get chicken teriyaki, rice, vegetables, egg roll, and a drink for $7.99. For the price you get a lot of food to. I couldn't eat all of mine."}
{"text":"great food, BTW this isn't closed...eat there weekly as i work across from the mall and its never been closed..great food for the price and big portions!"}
{"text":"You get a lot of food!  What the rice and noodles don't have in taste is made up for in volume.  It's not bad, just not very Japanese.    I ordered beef with fried rice but they made chicken and I had to tell three different people, who then had to confer with each other and wait ten minutes for them to cook the order again.  I get the feeling this happens often and they hope with the teriyaki sauce you won't notice it's not beef and just accept chicken even though beef is obviously a higher price point.  Most people picking up their orders add a ton of the spicy Sriracha sauce from the giant bottle on the counter.  That speaks volumes for the flavor of the food.  Have not tried the sushi but saw a lot of people ordering it.  Maybe that's the real deal to go for here so I will give them a second chance..."}
{"text":"Big portions. Great low carb option, just tell them No rice and just veggies and meat and avoid the fish sauce.  Eaten here and lost weight!"}
{"text":"Second time eating here in a long time and I work at this mall.  I waited in line next to the register and some guy made his extensive order when he jumped in front of me.  No apology made from either side.  I made a simple order of eel avocado.  I understand it was busy but the cashier jumped from the register to make drinks then took my money.  Then anyone before and after me got their stir fry entrees first.  Meanwhile I'm still looking for my 8 pieces of sushi and was told to stand near the stir fry end.  The girl that made my sushi was the one putting ready-made rice on people's plates.  I asked for a free spring roll because of the wait (at the least..).  She responded no with a sorry excuse which I barely heard.  Never again.  And sushi wasn't that great.  Quite dry."}
{"text":"Best $5 spent! A full plate of noodles, steamed vegetables, and chicken terriyaki, all prepared fresh to order.  The sauces are pretty standard, and a little salty, but worth the cost by far."}
