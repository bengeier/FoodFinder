{"text":"Amongst all of the hustle and bustle of over-the-top Las Vegas there is a nice down to earth wine bar hidden in an unlikely location. Located in the Masquerade Village at the Rio Hotel, The Wine Cellar & Tasting Room offers a classic old world wine experience for those looking to unwind and relax over a quality glass of wine. As you walk downstairs from the casino floor to the \"Wine Cellar\" you are instantly removed from the bright lights and noise of Vegas and enter into a quiet relaxed environment enclosed in rustic rock tile and brick archways.
Showcasing around 50,000 bottles, valued at more than $10 million, there is sure to be something on the menu that catches your interest. Or once you have your glass spend some time wandering around taking in some of the rare museum pieces located on site, including a bottle of 1800 Madeira from the cellar of Thomas Jefferson. If you're in the mood for some California cult or other very collectible wines then you're in luck because that's exactly what The Wine Cellar caters to. With more than 100 wines by the glass you're also free to sip here and there until finding that true gem. The professional wine stewards on sight have no problem offering up a taste before committing to a full glass pour. If you feel like some munchies then pair your wine with a multitude of cheese options, served with a basket of freshly baked bread.
Even though they claim to be Las Vegas's most famous wine bar and retail shop I would have had no idea that it was even there unless I happen to glance at a small sign in the parking lot of the Rio convention center with the magical words \"Wine Bar\". And to my astonishment this wasn't like your traditional Vegas cool & contemporary swanky hang-out but instead a nice classic wine bar. Of course the prices are still on par with the rest of Vegas the atmosphere can't be beet if you're looking to escape and savor a glass of wine as you unwind from a days worth of sight seeing or are looking to start the night off."}
{"text":"Staff are accommodating but the selection is mediocre and the prices are ridiculous.  I agree with an earlier reviewer that it's absurd to charge $XX for a glass of wine you can find in a supermarket.  When you tout yourself as having the best wine cellar in Vegas, you need to go a little deeper than Cakebread.

That said, you can find some interesting things in the wine-racks.  Interesting, but priced at restaurant prices, less 15%.  That's not interesting to me."}
{"text":"I had been here quite a few times and never dissapointed. The wine selection is unbelievably amazing, makes you feel like you are in Wine Heaven. Management is always around interacting with the guest. And talking about the stuff, they are very friendly and helpful if you can't decide about choice of wine. Atmosphere is intimate which makes your wine experience even better. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I highly recommend this place if you are beginning to enjoy wines or a wine connoisseur. They have various flights from $30 to about $60. Also, their bread, cheese, salami, olives, oven roasted tomatoes, dried fruits, and nuts are a great accompaniment with the wines. They have bottles as cheap as $10 to collections in the thousands of dollars if you are interested in buying wine. The service from Jose was fantastic and amazing! Thank you Jose!"}
{"text":"This place is a nice change of pace from your typical Vegas bar.  Its downstairs from the Masquerade Village and can be hard to find.  

Once you're downstairs, it looks like a genuine wine cellar.  They've got jazz music playing and you can easily have a conversation in there.  It's such a 180 from whats going on upstairs.  They have a wine shop with a wide variety of wines by the bottle and of course a wine bar.   I recommend getting a flight  as their pours are very very very generous.  

The bartenders are very friendly but also give you your space.  Overall, its a nice hideaway and much better than that wine bar at Mandalay Bay."}
{"text":"Wonderful experience in The Rio Casino complex.  Quiet and romantic atmosphere.  Ornate but reasonably priced flights of wine and a broad selection of flights.  We enjoyed the side platters of cheese and breads with our wine.  Will go back!"}
{"text":"Nice wine cellar. Enjoyed an improv magic show by the Amazing Brian. Great selection of pinot noirs on the tasting menu. Awesome experience would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"If you like wine, this is a must visit. This is probably the coolest place in the Rio. They have an incredible selection of wines to choose from and you can walk around the whole place looking at what they have. There's lots of comfortable seating and tables, but I like to go to the tasting bar to sit. 

I love to nibble on stuff when I drink wine and they have plenty of that here. Plus their wine flights make it really easy to try out different types of wine and not spend a lot of money buying bottles you might not like. I've tried several different types of wines I've never had before because they had flights to try them out. The service here is great and they are very knowledgeable about the wines. Even if you know nothing about wines, you can tell them what you like (e.g., fruity and sweet) and they can pick out some good wines to match what that. I went here years ago with some friends and did just that (when I knew nothing about wines). I would probably say that this is the place that turned on my fascination with wine."}
{"text":"Chill and classy. Excellent selection and wonderful relaxing atmosphere. The staff knows their stuff and gives excellent recommendations. I will visit again."}
{"text":"Have come back for the second time in 2 days. The sommeliers are very friendly. The selection meets any budget and the atmosphere is cozy and romantic. It's a nice break from the casino scene."}
{"text":"I'd give this place zero stars if I could. We read the reviews and most of them were positive. Since we had dinner reservations upstairs at Voodoo we decided to check it out. We sat down and looked at the flight menu and were actually horrified when we saw the prices. We go to many wine bars and have been to various wineries and found the prices completely obscene. 3-2 oz pours were the flights and they averaged $40-$90. A glass of Stags Leap was $47. The labels were all recognized. Cakebread, Silver Oak, Stags Leap... All great wines but why would I pay top dollar for a wine I can get at Von's??  We ended up paying for our bottle of Pelligrino and leaving without ordering anything. We hopped in a cab and went down the street to the Palazzo for drinks at Double Helix. 
Here's a tip: If you want to charge those kind of prices, bring in wines that you can't pick up with your cold cuts."}
{"text":"Amazing little spot in Las Vegas! 

Basement of Rio. You would never guess that such a spot existed in a Casino. 

As you walk down the spiral stair case, you suddenly find yourself in a quaint santa barbara or napa style wine cellar. 

Staff was helpful and informative. 

About 30 different flights.. you can even mix and match your own!"}
{"text":"I have been to this bar a few times on visits to Vegas and have loved the atmosphere.  I enjoy good wines and  they have a good selection. I went in tonight with my husband.  We described the type of wine we liked and they recommended one.  It was beyond what we wanted to pay at $100 but it was so highly recommended that we went for it. Turned out I didn't like it so much .  While talking to the sommelier we started talking about other wines and some blends I liked. He brought one out for me to taste and I said I liked it better than the $100 bottle. My husband said to pour me some.  I thought he might have been  trying to give me something because I so didn't like what he recommended   When we got the bill we were surprised to find that it was $50.00 for that pour.  Really?!!  We were stupid to not have asked but  I think they should really let you know before pouring you a $50 glass especially  after you balked at a $100  bottle.  I'm feeling taken and will never go back again. Beware of thus place and make sure you know the price before you even taste anything"}
{"text":"Well worth the trip! Great wines, great cheese selection. Perfect get away from the strip!"}
{"text":"Great space that just makes you feel comfortable and you're surrounded by wine which is never bad.  My largest issues with The Wine Cellar are its lack of food (although the cheese & salami they do have is excellent) and lack of any reasonably priced wine bottles.  This place is definitely focused on doing tasting flights of wine along with some cheese and when you're talking about flights it's normal to charge a higher markup due to the small tasting portions.  However, the bottle list is focused on aged wine with exorbitant markups and there is very little under $100 which is really what most people would be looking for.  Did I enjoy my expensive time at The Wine Cellar with a group of friends?  Yes.  Will I be back?  I doubt it."}
{"text":"Quite simply, one of the best places to drink a bottle of wine in Vegas. The staff is a bit snobby, but in my opinion, every wine drinker should be a little snobby considering some of the prices for a good bottle of wine. 

The tricky thing is knowing when this place is open, considering the drive from the Strip (unless you happen to be staying at the Rio).

Other than that, it's got a great atmosphere and a great bottle selection."}
{"text":"Love this hidden gem!  It offers everything you need if you enjoy wine and cheese like I do.  Amazing ambiance as well.  I cannot go there enough!"}
{"text":"Others have mentioned in detail the ambience and decor so I'll focus on the service and what I ate and drank.  Shout out to nice conventioners in for a convention show (don't ask)  who shared tastes and provided conversation before heading for sushi.

The menu is organized with wine flights, cheese flights and various appetizers.  They have recommended pairings but I wouldn't be afraid to order the food according to your own ideas if you know your own palate.

I won't attempt to drill down too much into the individual wines since everyone has such different palates.  Half the fun of this place is learning about everyone's different likes, dislikes and food bigotries.

Started with flight 5 Grassy Fields and Flight 1 Fresh Cheese.  Cheese was served with sliced baguette french bread.    Cheese was good but nothing wowed me.  Enjoyed the Frogs Leap Sauvignon Blanc, Craggy Fields S.B. was just ok, Surprised by the Compte LeFond Sancerre!  Not usually a big Sancerre fan but this one won me over.

Mentioned to our server that I liked stilton and she produced some to try next.  It was delicious and worked perfectly with the red wines we ordered (Frei Bros Merlot, Grgich Zinfandel, Atardi Tempranillo Rioja).

Had some grapes, cheese and the reds and was in heaven.

The Rioja was easily the best wine I tried and inspired me to order some extra Manchego cheese to pair it with...YUM.

At this point the entire bar was covered with wine glasses, cheese and smiling happy customers.

Servers here are knowledgeable and friendly.  They were happy to let us relax and joined in conversation when they weren't serving other customers.

Overall made it one memorable evening and it was a happy stroll back to the Palms on a Monday evening in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a comfortable place to go enjoy some good wines, this would be an excellent choice. The Wine Cellar at The Rio is a good place to stop in for drinks either before of after going to dinner in Vegas and has become one of our regular stops when we go to Vegas.

The Wine Cellar is located downstairs from the Masquerade Village in the The RIO. You really need to look for it to find it. The Wine Cellar keeps the noise from the casino floor to a minimum so you can sit and enjoy your wine.

Once you get downstairs, you'll find yourself inside an actual wine cellar where you can either sit at the bar or plop yourself down in one of the several couches they have there. 

There is a wide variety to choose from. You can order wine by the glass or if you're up for experimenting a little, one of the several wine flights they have.

We trusually get the flights when we visit there. Surprisingly, we found the prices pretty reasonable and the pours rather generous.

There is a limited menu of cheese and snacks if you want a little something to nibble on with your wine.

The servers are pretty friendly and knowledgeable and are always willing to make some suggestions if you are having trouble picking out a wine."}
{"text":"This is a great place to unwind after a day of shopping, gambling or just walking the strip.     It's DOWN a flight of stairs from the Masquerade Village at the Rio and once you get down there, you forget that you are in one of the noisiest casinos in Vegas.

The wine selection is excellent, the cheeses are great and the ambiance make it a favorite spot for us.      It's well worth a trip to the Rio just to go to the Wine Cellar."}
{"text":"Great place.  I love the way they have flights set up so you can try several different wines within a particular style.

My wife had Flight 5, Grassy Fields.  This consists of 3 different Sauvignon Blancs.  I had Flight 16, Planes Trains and Cabs.  This consists of 3 different Cabernets.

We also ordered a cheese plate which compliments the wine nicely.  Our server was Lita.  She was very fun and easy to talk to and enhanced our experience greatly."}
{"text":"I agree with the  reviewers who state  this place is overpriced.  You are truly paying for the cool atmosphere."}
{"text":"Besides shopping, this is my favorite place to relax & unwind in LV.  They have a ginormous list of flights ranging from reds to whites to sparkling wines, to dessert wines, to every other category you can think of.  

I really like the ambiance & the near silence, which is surprising since it's close to the casino area.  The assortment of wines for purchasing is so extensive that I get lost looking through the many racks of wines.  

The prices are very reasonable as well. 

This place is definitely a must see if you love wine, like me!"}
{"text":"Great wine flight selection!!!  We split a flight and then split a glass and it was the perfect portion!!!  They serve the flight with bread and they have cheese flights as well.  The coziest place ever to drink wine.  The only downside is the casino noise is not completely drowned out and neither is the smoke.  It's faint, but still present, which is not good for wine tasting.  We tried the best Malbec we've ever had here.  Looking forward to trying more of their flights.  Kind of pricy, but the mark up isn't bad at all!"}
{"text":"LOVED!!  Was one of the best parts of our trip and we go to Vegas often.  We have been wanting to try for year and our expectations were exceeded.  Can't wait to go back and try other flights.  Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing for some wine and cheese. Love the atmosphere and viewing the $1,000+ wines they have on display. Really good."}
{"text":"The Wine Cellar at the Rio hotel has such a beautiful exterior and winding staircase. I've wanted to come here for quite some time. 

The Cons: My concern is with the quality of wine and appetizers served. The (3) Red Tasting Wines ($30) they served tasted cheap, cheap, cheap. What they call wine, I call VINEGAR. Screw top wine for a tasting??? How very low class and sad. :( They might as well have served box wine. The ($12) charcuterie was boring too (cold bread, cheap olives)

The Pros: Staff was nice and the ambiance of the cellar is lovely. Come for the atmosphere but lower your expectations on the quality of wine and food."}
{"text":"Great place with a real big emphasis on great staff! I really believe that makes any restaurant even if the chef is not always to my taste, a great staff can always make up for it. However with this place you get the best of both worlds they accommodate all kinds of picky diets the best they can and the bartender is always happy to help you with pairings."}
{"text":"Great selection of wine.
Staff is friendly and helpful
The Som is a amazing man to speak with."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem inside the Rio! I came here for a post work celebratory drink with some colleagues and I absolutely adored the flight options. I ordered the champagne flight and it was really wonderful trying multiple types of champagne and exploring types I probably wouldn't have ordered otherwise. They also have a heavy pour ;)

The only draw back is there really isn't any food options besides bread and cheese (which they didn't offer, we had to ask for it). Unfortunately the bread we did order was below average and cold, not much of a compliment to our flight selections."}
{"text":"So glad we made it here, to a place that caters to several things I love most in life: tranquility, great wine and cheese, charcuterie, and a single malt. During a staycation earlier this year, I noticed that the Rio had a Wine & Cheese cellar: what?! 

It truly feels like a cellar, you descend a grand staircase, and are in elegant surroundings lightyears away from the casino chaos above. Comfy overstuffed chairs, dim lighting, and great service by a knowledgeable and personable Sommelier await you. The aforementioned light bites are a stellar accompaniment to any libations you choose; the cheese offering more options than the charcuterie. 

We truly enjoyed having wine flights, fromage and conversation in this lovely space. I'm just bummed that I didn't know about it sooner, because I would have been a regular when I lived in Las Vegas. (insert sad oenophile face :( 

Note: they close at 11 most nights, so it is not a \"late night\" haunt. The Sommelier told us that they host private group tastings, and have public events occasionally throughout the year."}
{"text":"Great selection of wines but there is a miss here. The couches were not comfortable my knees felt like they were in my chest.  When I'm spending 85 dollars a person on a wine flight I expect cloth napkins not cheap paper cocktail napkins. The music was not appropriate for the setting. This place could be excellent if they provided better descriptions of  the wines or a full time sommelier to advise the pairing especially since the have wines that cost over 10,000 dollars."}
{"text":"What great night. The service was excellent. The history on champaign fascinating. Such a personable gentleman behind the bar- from Oxford if I remember correctly. Even showed us a bottle of $25000 wine. Maybe next time lol. Just a great atmosphere to come Salome amazing wines and champaign with friends. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Yeah, this place is a nice change of pace from the flashing lights and bustle of Vegas.  None of that made a difference though because the service sucked ass.  

I was hopeful at first.  You walk down a spiral staircase into a dimly lit, spacious, and pleasantly calm wine bar with comfy couches and chairs.  There were maybe four other patrons, and we were immediately greeted and given a menu by a friendly staff member.  Unfortunately, she was apparently the only one working.  We settled on two flights after about 5 minutes of looking at the menu.  And then we waited.  And waited.  And waited.  The employee was literally passing back and forth in front of us, not looking at us and busy . . .doing what?  I don't know what she was doing, but she couldn't possibly have been THAT busy because there were only 6 people in the entire bar.  It literally took us a good 30 minutes before even being able to order.

After ordering, we waited more.  And longer.  And more.  At this point, I was about ready to guzzle down my wine and go to one of the normal bars where at least you are given booze quickly when you order it.  

Oh, and the wine list wasn't impressive either."}
{"text":"I'm torn here... There were some things about this place that I really liked (the wine and cheese), and others that I disliked enough that I will never return (the atmosphere)... 

Upon first descending we thought \"this place does look like a napa cellar, how cool\"!  A couple of cowboys warned us that the service was slow as molasses, so after a while of waiting at our table we decided what we want and approached the sommelier.  We ordered two flights, and he helped us pick out some cheese to accompany.

During this process, \"it\" started... The reason for which I will never return... The show.  The Rio show where gals and guys in skimpy outfits ride around on a float on the main floor with blaring overplayed pop music. It was loud - REALLY LOUD - down in the \"wine cellar\".  The engineers/architects/managers/designers that came up with the concept of a wine cellar in the Rio missed a CRUCIAL aspect that absolutely ruins the atmosphere.  They should have installed sound proof doors at the entrance.  

Imagine standing in a winery and all of a sudden they start blaring cheesy pop music so loudly you can't talk.  Yeah.  You would leave.  ASAP.  We were out for a birthday celebration so we stayed, but this turned a pleasant evening where we were willing to drop some dough into an \"if it weren't for this, we would like this place\" kind of evening. Maybe they only do the show certain nights, then it would be worth going on off nights.

We switched tables to another part of the area where it was a bit more shielded from chaos above, and giggled at the absurdity and discomfort.  After our wine and cheese was delivered (along with a very nice bread basket), the wait staff was relatively attentive, and friendly when we did talk with them (although remarkably absent for only one other table present on a Saturday night).  The wines were wonderful, the cheese accompaniment was delightful and exactly what we were hoping for... But, I will not return.  If I wanted to yell at my friend while drinking, I'd just hop up to Voodoo instead of the Cellar."}
{"text":"An oasis amidst the bright lights and loud noises of the casino, this wine tasting room is a wonderful find in the subterranean space of the Rio hotel right off the Las Vegas strip. Descend the wooden stair case bound by a beautiful wrought iron railing and grab a seat at the wooden bar or in one of the comfy club chairs at one of the numerous seat groupings. 

My husband and I were looking for a quick drink and snack before seeing Penn & Teller at this Vegas institution. We didn't expect to find such a place, but were pleasantly surprised when we stumbled upon the wine cellar. They offer several different flights of wine which are grouped by grape and sometimes region, red vs white, light vs medium to full-bodied and on and on... and the 3 oz. pours are unusually large! Prices for three glasses range from $19-$55 depending on the selection. And they are wonderful--- you can savor your basic sauvignon blancs or chardonnays from California and France or sip on the more medium to full-bodied reds like the Prisoner and David Lust. You can order olives or a cheese plate with some dried fruits and nuts to nibble on. The food is not super gourmet but is just perfect for enjoying with your wine flights. You can also opt to taste sparkling, scotches etc so there is something for any beverage drinker. The gentleman behind the bar is just lovely...accomodating and knowledgable.

This is truly a welcome respite from the hustle bustle of sin city and the high prices of the celebrity chef restaurants that pervade all of the strip hotels. Would definitely recommend seeking it out!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to escape the over stimulating Vegas casinos.  It is hard to find but and under signed within the Rio.  Once inside the staff was very attentive and knowledgeable.  Enjoy a great glass of wine in a quiet comfortable setting."}
{"text":"So disappointed.  Sorry this place is not at all what I was expecting.  If you love wine, I would not recommend this place.  While they have a great selection of wines if you are going in for a tasting/flight they need to open NEW bottles of vino and not ones that have been sitting on the counter for days.  I have sensitive palate and enjoy good a nice glass of wine and the tasting I had were awful.

As a tasting room, once you open a bottle of wine and you expose it to oxygen the aromatics and flavor start to reduce dramatically. This is the first step of your wine going bad.  After 24 hours a bottle of wine is pretty much shot as it starts to develop stale flavors. 

I have traveled all over the world and this way by far worst wine cellar/tasting room.  My tasting was gross and the wines tasted like sherry and pumpkin notes. This was not very pleasant.

Oh, did I mention we were the only ones besides the employees?"}
{"text":"One of our favorite stops when visiting Las Vegas. Hidden underground the Rio casino floor you wouldn't even know it was there.  Great service and conversations with our waiter.  The atmosphere is light but the room has mood lighting.  Wine tasting, order a bottle of wine or do a flight.   This is my favorite place."}
{"text":"\"hidden gem in the basement of the Rio\" is much like being impressed by a nice piece of corn in the middle of a turd.  it's still in the middle of a turd.  and this little piece of corn is old and moldy.

oh, it smelled like mushrooms and puke - and the 'flight' my friends ordered was chock full of meh

another reason to never cross the highway"}
{"text":"Rio's hidden gem. Beautiful little wine cellar at the Masquerade Village of the Rio. It doesn't even look like it belongs in the Rio AT ALL. So glad I came here for a drink.

They have several wine flights as well as cheese boards. Every single thing I ordered from here was super good. Their gouda and parmesan are AMAZING and their bread is equally as delicious.

It gets a bit chilly in here so bring a jacket!"}
{"text":"The Wine Cellar is an enchanting wine bar located a floor below the casino in the Rio.  I stumbled upon this place while I was waiting for the Penn and Teller show.  Once you walk down the stairs you feel like you've been warped to a gorgeous wine cellar in Napa, it's like walking into a different world from the casino.  The walls are lined with beautifully displayed wine racks filled with wine and the lighting sells the \"underground cellar\" feel.

You can choose to sit at the bar or one of many inviting couches, armchairs, and bistro tables.  The menu offers many flights of differing varietals and varying prices.  Flights come with a basket of varying breads and of course some water to cleanse the palate.

If you're in the Rio, I insist you take a break from the bustle and noise of the casino and slow it down with a flight of wine...or two ;)"}
{"text":"Wow!!!!!   A wine lovers utopia...... This might be the best kept secret/hidden gem in Las Vegas.  If you want to get away from the smokey casinos and enjoy a top notch glass (or flight) of wine(s) this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Wine flights were great!  Nice pour too.  I've always wanted to try this place and am very glad I did!"}
{"text":"The Cellar is the perfect escape from the craziness that is Vegas. Our sommelier was extremely professional and knowledgeable. You could really tell he loved what he did and wanted to share it with us. There is nothing better than that."}
{"text":"This place is awesome for wine lovers. They have different wine flights and some insane cheese to go along with it."}
{"text":"Good place to get away from it all smoke free calming music.  Nibbles were great the wine was pricey but excellent."}
{"text":"I just have to say....I want this place at my house! Hah....

I really wish I had tried the Cheese Plate....my friends were raving about it the other night....and knowing me with the love of anything cheese, I know I would have asked for a trough of the stuff lol....

But you won't be disappointed with the selection of wines....not sure if it's the largest selection in the world, but it does have a nice ring to it when you mention it to your friends...

When you enter you have to go down a short flight of stairs...really great atmosphere, comforting energy....great customer service....they really catered to our every needs....I would have loved to try out more of the wines....we only ordered a bottle tween the three of us, but it was quite good...

If you love a good wine and are willing to be a bit adventurous....try the Wine Cellar =P"}
{"text":"The wine cellar was my favorite part of the Rio hotel. It took me a minute to find the entrance, which is located near the small Rio stage in the masquerade area of the casino. Descend the winding, wrought iron stair case down to the cellar. There is a feeling of being removed from the rest of the casino. Another reviewer mentioned that they could still hear the band upstairs. It was quite quiet during my visit, but with no band playing, this may have been good timing.

The bar tender greeted me warmly. The offer flights of wine, either red or white. Each of the three glasses had a decent sized pour. The prices vary from $19 to higher, one of the most reasonable options in Vegas. They also have cheese plates with dried fruit and bread to nibble on. The bar tender was able to make suggestions based on personal preference.

I highly recommend checking out the Wine Cellar and Tasting Room."}
{"text":"Awesome ambiance and service, but overpriced even for the The Strip.

I've wanted to come here for awhile. My husband and I were seeing a show at The Rio so we came in before our show. There really wasn't much information about what's offered on their website so we went in not knowing what food and drinks were offered. 

Walking in I immediately liked the ambiance. Located downstairs from the main casino area it is a cozy space with a rustic winery feel. Seating includes a long bar, tables, and couches. Seating areas are nicely spaced out. My husband and I opted to lounge on one of the couches and thought it was a comfortable way to enjoy our wine. 

The woman that helped us was friendly and attentive. As soon as we walked in she greeted us and offered us menus. She encouraged us to sit anywhere we liked and she'd be over soon to take our order. We were given the perfect amount of time to look over the menu without being rushed. She continued to check on us enough that we felt taken care of, but not so much that her presence was intrusive to our experience. 

The menu offers many different wine flight options as well as wines by the glass. Flights start at around $30, but most are $50-$60. Each flight comes out to about two glasses of wine. I saw on Yelp that they were working to improve their food menu so I thought they might have a few appetizers. On our visit the menu only offered a couple of cheese flights, a couple (literally two) meats, and items you'd get with cheese plates like olives or nuts. 

We wanted a glass of wine each so we shared a flight of Pinot Noirs. Three of the wines in the flight were good. Ironically, the most expensive wine in the flight was not good at all. We ordered a cheese flight that included gouda, cheddar, and Parmigiano-Reggiano. This was a sad display with some dried fruit around the cheese. It did come with a large bread basket featuring the same breads served at Voodoo. For $30 and a nice wine bar you'd expect a nicer spread with mustards, jams, or nuts. We also ordered the meat plate which had five pieces of two different meats. The meats were delicious, but again the presentation was sad with just a small cup of olives on the side. 

All said, we had the equivalent of two glasses of wine, some cheese, some meat, and a lot of bread for around $140 with tip. I realized later that this spot offers 25% off to locals, but even with that discount this spot would be a hard pass. Next time I'd just skip this spot, spend a little extra money, and have a full dinner at Voodoo Steakhouse."}
{"text":"excellent selections of wine flights, amusingly named. assorted cheese tastings to accompany.

--wine cellar fridges are a delight to explore; filled with mid-'80s french reds in magnums and double magnums. paradise just a pane of glass away. (does a yelp review count as pre-meditation?)
--delightful barman loves wines and loves to talk about them with you.
--\"sparkling\" flight a refreshing pick-me-up after some hours of crap shoots
--soft cheese selection with dried fruit and
--basketfuls of salty if spongey thick-sliced bread

{"text":"The ambience is lovely. The wine selection is mediocre. The guy behind the bar(sommelier?) was NAILS!!!! It seemed as though I was bothering him, not helpful, not personable. And the bread they serve was at least 2 days old."}
{"text":"Wine Cellar & Tasting Room is my favorite place to wine taste in Las Vegas! You would never imagine such a beautiful wine cellar hidden down a spiral staircase inside The Rio. Reasons why I'm loyal to Wine Cellar: 

- Lovely ambiance - very rustic, cozy, and inviting
- Incredibly friendly and knowledgeable employees - Hung the manager always welcomes us and Joel is one of our favorite sommeliers! They always have great wine recommendations and keep us engaged 
- Complimentary bread is offered if you would like - definitely helps cleanse your palette between wines  
- There is an enormous selection of wine (enormous is an understatement) 
- Decent pours which is always a plus!

Wine Cellar is an excellent choice for a classy night out with close friends or a date. The service and wines here have never disappointed! I've visited more than handful of times and look forward to coming back soon."}
{"text":"This place is EXPENSIVE!!! For a flight (3 wines, 2 oz each), you could buy a whole bottle of wine!  Most of the flights were in the $20-30 range and some were even over $60!  I realize this is Vegas but damn!!!  I had a bubbles flight for about $22 which was okay but nothing to write home about.  The best part about this place is it's awesome location. It's actually a cellar and very cold which was a respite from the heat of the summer.  They also have an extensive collection of wine which is fun to peruse if you're a wine nerd ;)"}
{"text":"This place was amazing. Such s cute cozy little cellar area at the bottom of the Rio. They have many wines to choose from and several wine flights. I loved having the option to sample several wines. They have nice cozy seating areas to relax and enjoy your wine. Will be coming here again on our return trip to Vegas. Love it!!"}
{"text":"Bottom Line: Great place to savor some wine or maybe a scotch ... key word is savor; if you simply want to grab a quick drink, stick with the multiple bars scattered across the casino floor.

Service: Very friendly and professional staff; sommelier was very knowledgeable; service was a little slow at times given the long bar which was broken up by stone columns, making it hard for the servers to see you at times.

Atmosphere: Cozy downstairs setting ... reminiscent of a cellar (surprise); however, music from the band which plays upstairs is somewhat loud and intrudes on the setting.

Pricing: Yes, it's overpriced ... but it's also Las Vegas; I can't think of a wine bar or cigar lounge located in a Las Vegas casino that isn't overpriced.

Selection: I like the wide variety of flights they offer.  I ended up having a glass of Silver Oak (2006 Cabernet Sauvignon) and a tasting of scotch."}
{"text":"The Wine Cellar at the Rio is in the lower level in the carnival wing. Down the winding stairs, to a wine basement with room for private parties as well as a long bar where we sat at the end.  Waitress was very helpful with our selections and you have an option of multiple flights of wine and multiple flights of cheese, and orders of homemade Salami 2 Oz's each per order. 

3 Flights chosen.  1. The Pinot Noir flight which was two good wines and two pass wines.  The Chardonnay flight had 3 wines all excellent and the Cabernet flight $70.00 was 3 Cabernets and 1 huge Boudreaux.  Really generous pours considering the price of the wines.  We had 1 cheese flight which our sever allowed us to substitute some other cheeses into the brie / blue cheese flight and 1 order of homemade salami was plentiful and excellent. Complimentary baskets of bread were provided as well.   I have to say I love wine tasting and this is unique in Las Vegas.  Good value on all the flights with great pours and our server was knowledgeable and very nice and helpful. 

If you're in or near the Rio make this a stop!!! I loved it."}
{"text":"While visiting Vegas, my husband and I stopped in the wine cellar. We both enjoy sweet wines but they only serve wines on the dryer side. We did try one of their desert wines, but it was like drinking syrup. If you are a fan of dry wines then I'm sure you will love stopping in for a flight but it just wasn't for us."}
{"text":"Thought this place was a great detour from the usual \"Vegas\" nightlife.  Not very crowded when we were there, had our choice of sitting at the bar or choosing comfy couches.  Server was helpful, we each order a couple wine flights and split a cheese flight with salami and bread.

Delicious but pricey, but then again arn't all wine bars?  Would go back it was a nice start to the evening before we went to see a show on the strip.

Loved the decor and looking at all the really old wines in the cellar."}
{"text":"My wife Jojo and I have been frequenting The Wine Cellar for over a dozen years and have never been disappointed ever. Jose and the staff run a casual, intimate and wonderful wine tasting experience. Jose is an integral part of the fun and we always make sure he's on to be sure we get to catch up with an old friend. 
The wines are great, the Charcuterie is delicious and it's a great brief escape from the fast pace of Vegas. 
We love The Wine Bar!!

{"text":"Everything was perfect except for the noise level. The band mixed with the flair bartenders was awful in the cellar. They really need to build more walls or something to help block the sound upstairs. The server Jose was nice also. He was knowledgeable of the wines. The cheese was very delicious also."}
{"text":"This hidden gem is located in the basement of the Rio in Las Vegas. Open to the public, this once private venue holds rare and special wines. 

Perfect for celebrating a special occasion.

This venue has an ornate bar. Sit at the bar when possible. For a more intimate experience, check out the spacious seating throughout the room. 

Staff were friendly and knowledgable.

Features a lovely charcuterie board as an easy addition to wine flights or a few glasses. Dried fruit, fresh bread and several cheese options to fit any pallet.

This was my first visit but won't be my last. Excited to check out other wine offerings from this business."}
{"text":"This is a nice little hidden (literally) gem!  Even the RIO employee I talked to wasn't sure how I could get there. I eventually found the elevator, and really enjoyed my time.  I had an excellent flight of four red wines and some snacks to go along.  The bartender was really nice and knowledgeable. The only problem is that I don't get out to the RIO very often."}
{"text":"This was really a cute little place.  I popped in here and had a couple flight tastings of wines one night, when I was waiting for my dinner reservation.

clean, well rounded wine list. knowledageble staff - and a great enviorment - going to put it back on que for this next trip."}
{"text":"This was a great spot. Service was great and they had a great wine selection. Just didn't like that it was inside Rio."}
{"text":"The Wine Cellar is a hidden gem at the Rio in Vegas. Located at the lower level of the Rio, the wine cellar is dressed up just like a sophisticated wine cellar or basement should be. Several little areas in a cool space surrounded by a magnificent selection of wine.  

We sat in a little corner specifically set up for a group of 4 or less. We tried 4 diff kinds of wine flights complimented by an excellent assortment of cheese, fruit, and cured meat. Our server, Jose, has apparently been there for 15 years and the experience showed. Great advice on the wine and did a great job of creating the cheese and meat tray for us. 

Exceptional time and will come back here next time for sure."}
{"text":"I went to the Wine Cellar as part of a group from my job. This is the kind of environment I really enjoy- beautiful colors, warm lighting, quality furniture, leather and wood- I'd love a room in my house to look like this!  I enjoyed looking through the old collection of wines and finding ones bottled the years my parents were born (1930s).  We enjoyed a couple of different wines (I'm not much of a drinker) and some nice hors d'oeuvres.  Because this was an event hosted by my job, I have no idea about pricing.  All I know is that I would love to come back and curl up with a magazine or two in one of those nice, cozy chairs."}
{"text":"Excellent experience! We had great service and delicious drinks. I had
a flight of bubbles and the BF had a glass of Pinot Noir. We also had
some cheeses, which come in good-sized portions and have suggested
wine pairings listed.  Huge selection of wines and cheeses. This place
was the best part about the Rio. My flight, one glass of Pinot and three cheeses came out to $130 with tip, so I'm dinging it a star for being spendy."}
{"text":"I took a painting and wine class here and had a blast. Great ambiance and quiet setting to paint in one of their private rooms. Food and service was also excellent."}
