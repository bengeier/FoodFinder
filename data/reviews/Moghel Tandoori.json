{"text":"Nous avons partagé un combo AA à deux adultes et un enfant. Le poulet au beurre est savoureux, la présentation des assiettes est soignée. Bel ajout au paysage culinaire de St-Lambert. Apportez votre vin."}
{"text":"Très bon resto indien. Un menu très élaboré. Les menus à partager pour 2 font office de menu dégustation et font en même temps de ce resto  un endroit privilégié pour une petite sortie de couples.  Lors de ma dernière visite, j'ai vu qu'il y avait un peu plus de personnes du 3è âge ce qui dans mon esprit est une preuve de bon goût. Je vous le recommande."}
{"text":"Been here a few times at lunch, first time for dinner when I'm town. Had the Chicken Dhansak which was delish. Will definitely come again."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed! Do NOT go here if you are looking for the authentic Indian taste! The food was horrible, and stale, the tandoori rotis were extremely high priced ($8/each) for what was served, they were dry, flaky and not soft at all. We ordered vegetarian dishes and they were totally not what indian dishes taste or even look like. In lieu of navaratan korma (which the server gaurantedd was a dish with gravy) they served us a dry dish of sautéed veggies, bland with no curry, no spices,not even salt, just oil!! When inquired the waiter got us extra curry, which was of a non vegetarian entree!! Can u guys believe it, they knew we r vegetarians, we repeatedly told them while placing the order. when we confirmed with the server and asked for it to be replaced,they did replace it but seemed totally non-apologetic. The overall customer service was rude and non welcoming at all. Going here ruined our evening, was a waste of money as their Prices are EXTREMELY HIGH!! for what indelectable food they serve and left us with bad memories of montreal, as we were leaving back home that night."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my time there. The waitor helped me choosing my meal. I had chicken tandoori from dinner menu. The plate looked very nice with different vegetables. The amount of spice was very well balanced, not very hot spicy at all as you may experience at other Indian restaurants. The amount of food was enough. They were very hospitable!"}
{"text":"Very delicious and very popular! Nice workers. You will most likely need to reserve ahead of time. I love their vegetarian options. This is my mother's go to restaurant. It's bring your own wine which is great too! The SAQ is just a block and a half away!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, some of the best indian i've had! Lots of vegetarian options. I highly recommend the vegetarian meal for two, you can even customize it and it is very affordable."}
{"text":"Excellente cuisine indienne de grande qualité. Plats présentés façon nouvelle cuisine moderne . Original, belle salle, atmosphere sympatique, merci a Taj pour son accueil souriant. On y reviendra surement"}
{"text":"The  ambience and food is awesome. However the service is really slow. They need to improve on their service. Other then that do visit them. Not too far away from Olympic Stadium and planetarium."}
{"text":"Très bonne cuisine! Bonnes portions, service rapide. Excellente valeur. Ambiance correcte. Un endroit à découvrir à St Lambert!"}
{"text":"Coming from the UK, where there are probably more indian restaurants than any McDonalds, I was complaining to my husband about how much I missed spicy indian food. My bday was around the corner, so my hubby and the in laws planned me a surprise dinner party. Being not familiar with the roads on the south shore, we were driving around all over the place between boucherville and longueuil, until we finally arrived at Moghel Tandoori. The dimmed lighting, decor, ambiance, friendly staff, food and spices were to perfection!
We had such a good time with the waiter that at the end of the evening, he escorted us to the car - we found that extremely polite and respectful! This amazing service made the food even tastier! I truly believe that Moghel Tandoori beats any indian restaurant in parc-X!"}
{"text":"Food was good but unfortunately the service was only fair, therefore I'm giving 3 instead of 4 stars. Will try again and hopefully have a different experience."}
{"text":"Having eaten here almost weekly for over a year, there is plenty to keep you satisfied!  

Everything that you could expect from a great indian menu, with a friendly staff willing to make any necessary adjustments (light cream, extra spicy, etc.)!

The chicken sandwich is a great choice for someone that isn't too familiar with Indian food.

If you're looking for a consistent choice for lunch that's a little bit different, Moghel is a great decision!"}
{"text":"Petit restaurant apportez votre vin. Le restaurant est visuellement beau à l'intérieur et il y a du parking facile proche puisque c'est comme un bloc de restaurants.

La nourriture est correcte, je dirais un 2.5-3/5. Le service est bien, un peu lent pour un vendredi soir. On a arrêté ici pour laisser passer le traffic avant de rentrer à Montréal. Il y a des meilleurs restos indiens sur la rive-sud (et à montréal!!!), mais ça a fait l'affaire le temps d'une soirée :)"}
{"text":"Service très long. Certains plats dans les entrées goûtent le congelé. Les plats pricipaux sont ok et les portions sont raisonnables. Nous étions assis sous une bouche d'aération et c'était très desagreable. Bref ce n'est pas un coup de coeur pour l'amateur de nourriture indienne que je suis."}
{"text":"Fancy looking restaurant in a not so fancy area- I'm guessing it's popular among the locals as it was quite full on a Friday night with large groups celebrating birthdays.

Decor is tasteful, clean, booths and table are a little cramped and it gets very loud, easy to hear everything going on next to you.

Presentation of food is what I liked the best, minimalist plating with eye popping colors but as expected from restaurants that try to be upscale, the portions are very small.
I ordered the evening table d'hote with included an appetizer, meal and dessert for 22$. My simple butter chicken sauce was mild and creamy, great hint of coconut milk but the cubed chicken was dry once I bit into it, could have used longer marinade.

Not the best Indian food, and you can get far more for less elsewhere- if you come here, you're paying for the decor and ambiance."}
{"text":"My first time here, a very well-decorated upscale restaurant with reasonable prices.  The service was pleasant and bilingual, although a little slow which is the only reason I didn't give the restaurant five stars.  The portions were big enough that I even took some home.  If you're on the south shore and and want to save yourself a trip into Parc-Ex, try this place."}
{"text":"Très bon restaurant indien, plats raffinés, service agréable, prendre le menu pour deux c'était parfait ! On le met sur notre liste à St-Lambert ! Bon rapport-qualité prix qui plus est"}
{"text":"Another BYOB Indian restaurant but this time in a more \" elegant \" dining setting. More expensive then all the other Indian restaurants that I go to (perhaps rent is ridiculously expensive in St Lambert) I personally don't know if I like it or not. We chose vegetarian table d'hôte for two and to be honest it was bad. It was just not that good either. Ok. Ok. This is just MY opinion (I grew up and work in the restaurant business). So here's my problem. All three main dishes seems to have the same base sauce that has been tweaked with by the addition of different spices for each of them. The texture of the sauce (that's what gave it up) is exactly the same as those bottles Indian sauces that you buy at the grocery store. Like it has been thicken with some sort of commercial emulsifier. It felt like they had tubs of it in the back. Something wasn't right. Another thing is that it wasn't spicy at all! We had to ask for hot sauce. Probable because the place is in St Lambert and they try to cater to the clients taste buds. Americanized menu?? I think so. Another thing is that I could taste the fake powdered chicken bouillon in the food. Everything seemed to be on the sweet side as well. Like I said, not bad but not good at all. Not worth the price. I guess it's like the Chez Lien but Indian version. 

The service was shall I say...weird!?! They were polite but I felt like I was being served by robots. One of our waiter, because we had the whole wait staff (5) waiting on our table, only pointed things. No one word came out of his mouth. 

One last thing. WHERE IS THE STAINLESS PEOPLE!!!"}
