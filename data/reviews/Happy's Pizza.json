{"text":"The Service out of this establishment was Good. The person the took the order over the phone was funny and polite. Service was quick, specially with the large group orders at I do. The Delivery Drivers was nice and polite as well. Also the orders are always correct. Give this place a shot, you'll be glad that you did."}
{"text":"I don't know! Happys Pizza, what do I say its not bad but its not the best. First thing I have to say is the menu is so big for a place that has pizza in it's name, I can understand the wings and even the sandwiches. But shrimp, fish, burgers, fried chicken, hot dogs (or as they call them Happy Dogs) etc.  And with such a big menu I know that about 100% of it is all frozen food. Yes even the pizza tastes like it was frozen. But I did get some things you might not find on a pizza shops menu, like fried shrooms and chili cheese fries. First of all the shrooms had heavy breading and watered down ranch dressing. The fries are good, but something you can do at home with some frozen fries a can of chili and some frito lay nacho cheese sauce.   I also ordered a steak sub (that came with fries and about 1/2oz of cole slaw, that I did not touch), and some wings with two diffrent flavor sauces. I opened the box that the sub came in, and the thick white styrafoam container the wings came in and just like everything else frozen food. The sub bread was nice and soft and was still soft even after a good heating in the micro. But it was nothing but pressed together beef, with un-cooked red onions and un-melted cheese, and super sweet steak sauce.  The wings, well................ again something they cooked out of a bag from out of the freezer. Heavy breading I couldn't find any of the chicken on the bone, and when I could it wasn't much. The sauce was ok but because of the heavy breading on them you couldn't taste the sauce. The sauce in the bottom of the container was good if only it could have made the breading taste that way.   So maybe I will order Happys pizza again if my freezer is empty, and if I need super fast delivery of food. But other than that I will keep my money in my purse. And cook even on the nights I don't want to."}
{"text":"staff recieves 5 stars.. although i am rating this review for one reason and one reason only i was craving banana pudding..! heard they had some of the best LOL yeah right.! nothinh about it was homemade.. right out the jello box.. disgusting. stay away from the pudding."}
{"text":"Called for pizza and after two hours and 15 minutes of waiting driver returned back to the store with our pizza returned here with cold pizza and no exclamation as to why it wasn't delivered do not order from here"}
{"text":"This place was really amazing. Great service from the staff, food was excellent! Cannot ask for much more than that. I will definitely be back on future trips to Las Vegas."}
{"text":"First time for a true Las Vegas deep dish pizza and I can say that I really liked what we ordered! I went and met a classmate and we ordered a small Meat deep dish pizza. Tip- a small pizza between two people will still leave about 2 pieces left over. It is very filling! The wait time to get a table was 30 to 45 minutes, but you get to pre-order your pizza. So, we sat at the bar and ordered some drinks. It actually was 45 minutes to get to the table on a Wednesday night, but pizza came out quickly after we got seated. Pizza was really good, but the crust alone needed a bit of salt or spice, kinda bland by itself. But with the sauce, toppings, cheese and crust married together was well worth the wait. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Ordered for delivery .. My mother just got home from surgery so she is now on bed rest and I'm looking after her . we were hungry !!! Could go for anything we thought let's order happy pizza its 15 minutes away (walking) 5 (driving) we ordered a large pepperoni and wings.  You can really screw that up . its called \"happys pizza\" known for pizza . well our pizza showed up at 4:53 I ordered at 1:57. It was freezing cold . the crust / dough was not even cooked thoroughly . the wings were ok nothing to write about . my total cost was 26.56 I have 2 '20s he had no change and literally asked me could he keep the remainder of the change . hell no . learn to cook u guys its terrible"}
{"text":"The shrimp and fries was good. The fish was so bad I will never eat fish at happy pizza, again. Coleslaw was just nasty. I called the order in the lady spent more time rushing me than taking the order. They only brought half the order. lol -5 stars"}
{"text":"We made an order before 10, used our credit card and everything. We called after 11 and they said they were closed and will credit us 5 to 7 BUSINESS days.   If you was closed, why didn't you call us and tell us? Their excuse was \"they was cleaning up\""}
{"text":"We like their food so much. The cheese pizza was good and the fried fish with fries is fried well and didn't absorb a lot of oil. The salad vegetables were fresh and yum.  We stopped by randomly and were so hungry driving from Niagara Falls to Cleveland."}
{"text":"This place is pretty unique, You can get a pizza, fried chicken, sub sandwich, hot wings, french fries and more. I work near by the Flamingo location and have had lunch and dinner here a few times.   I want to first point out there subs. I can not get enought of the italian sub with fries. It is toasted to perfection and price is great. For under 6 bucks you can get a good meal that taste like it was a $20 plate! The meat and bread was fresh and the flavor and portion is worth eating again!   The service was fair, fast and easy. There are a lot of pizza shops around town and this is one you should try out.   As I said above I have had lunch and dinner there. I ordered the family meal pack that had a bunch of fryed chicken, bread sticks fries, wings, and pizza. All in all for the price you cant beat it. I paid under $35 bucks and it was more than enough for my family of 5. We even had left overs!!!  I will say that the fryed chicken was a little dry, but the wings, pizza and frys were great!"}
{"text":"Your food and your service is sh$t!  The only thing you have going for you is your delivery guy who was great.  The rest of you ideots mess up every order, take way to long, and the food is crap!  I will never ever ever call your business again.  I would start off by fireing your girl that picks up the phone because she is an awful human being.  Ramsey would not even be able to fix your garbage establishment."}

{"text":"Happy's Pizza had the best price per pizza for a large catering order.  I ordered 21 pizza's, they were delivered on-time and hot!  The Manager, Dave ensured the order was correct.  The delivery girl, was very pleasant and curteous.  I recommend Happy's Pizza, as they made my event very HAPPY! Lynn C."}
{"text":"For a fast food Pizza (and more) place, we were totally happy.  Living in Colorado, but having grown up in WNY, we are pleased to say the the pizza is much more like The later's.  You don't go here for ambiance, but there is a small, simple sitting area where we ate in.  The staff was very nice, and prices were VERY reasonable.  Stopped back again a few days after our first visit and had a similar, positive experience."}
{"text":"A midwest chain that is much better than most of the national pizza chains. Great combo deals. The pizzas are just above average but the extensive menu and late hours make up for it. The garlic BBQ XL whole wings are my secret guilty pleasure."}
{"text":"I've ordered from a different location years ago and had the same horrible thing happen as this time. Ordered delivery and no one came. End of story. Was told about an hour. An hour and a half later I'm ordering Papa John's because I didn't have the sense to think the same thing would happen this time. I guess I shouldn't give this place the benefit of the doubt.  The person on the phone answered and spoke as if he didn't care about what I wanted of if I got it at all. I've learned my lesson will never order from this place ever again. If you want food delivered to you DON'T call this place to get it. You'll die starving."}
{"text":"Should be sad's pizza very bad customer service. They put the wrong topping on my pizza and their worker offered a 3 dollar credit but Leroy the manager didn't want to honor it. Just lost a repeat customer who ate there twice in 1 week"}
{"text":"Good service at the Garfield heights location way better than the one in east Cleveland one time I order service from the east Cleveland location and the delivery women was bitching all because she didn't get a tip I could not afford to and we got into an argument she threatened to report me to the manager I quit ordering from the east Cleveland one customer service was bad but Garfield heights is incredible"}
{"text":"Contrary to the banner on the top of this page, this business has not moved. It still serves the same horrid disgusting pizza and other food made to clean out your digestive tract and send you to the pharmacy.   I ordered a large pizza from them. I ate a part of one slice, then a part of a second slice then threw it all in the garbage.   What more can I say about them? Save your money and get pizza elsewhere."}
{"text":"I ordered the lunch special burger and fries. It was as good as advertised. The lettuce, tomato, and onions were perfect. The bun was very good. Of course the burger itself was flavorful, tender, and juicy.   My mom order the lunch special pizza. She has an extremely high standard when it comes to pizza. I didnt taste it as it was a veggie, but she absolutely loved it.  The first thing I do when I enter a resaurant for the first time is look and smell for cleanliness. Happys was great in both areas.  Good quality food at a good price. I will be returning."}
{"text":"I was making lasagna one night, and realized I didn't have any bread or salad for side dishes. Since I only live minutes from Happy's Pizza, I decided to order a Greek Salad and their Cheesy Bread. I did order delivery since I was in the middle of making dinner.  (Mind you I could drive there in 2 minutes) 1 hour later my Greek Salad and Cheesy Bread arrived. Thank God lasagna takes forever to cook!  The cheesy bread was very large for the price, (around $6.00) I believe. However it was dry, and their marinara sauce was very bland. The ranch that I paid (.75 cents for) was broke, and was spilled everywhere. The Cheesy Bread was not really that cheesy, and the taste of it was kind of weird.  The Greek Salad was around $7.00 and was disgusting! The dressing they used was really gross, and the salad didn't even have feta cheese on it....  Overall my total was $21.00 with tip, for a salad and cheesy bread- and we didn't even eat half of it!   Pretty disappointed on the quality and taste of the food. Will most likely not be going back."}
{"text":"LOVE this place.  My family and I were visiting my husband's family in Cleveland.  It had been a VERY long day.  The kids were super whiny and hungry when we saw this place and decided to try it.    This place was SUPER busy!  Phone was ringing off the hook with call in orders and there was a steady trickling of people coming in to place to go orders (you cannot sit down and eat here).    We place our order.  For the amount of business they were getting, I would say we got our food in more than a reasonable amount of time.  The employees/security guard were talking to our kids trying to entertain them while we waited.  All the employees were very nice & welcoming.  When our food is ready to go, we scoop it up and head to the hotel.  We all are starving and can't wait to dig in.   The kids all ordered pizza.  I tasted it (of course) and it was delicious.  It was nice and hot.  My husband ordered wings & a sub.  He said they were both very good (I hate wings so I'll take his word on it).  I ordered a turkey sub.  It was dynomite.  Loved it.  They even gave us a few extras for our wait.  If I lived in Cleveland, I would make this a regular place that my family would order from."}
{"text":"Quite frankly I don't see what the problem is with this place. The food is good, the location is right in the middle of town and there is delivery so I love it."}
{"text":"We ordered a lot of food this past Sunday the 21st we got mushrooms breaded which were good got a extra large pizza Hawaiian which was so so was very soft we had onion rings excellent french fries good we had boneless chicken wings which they were horrible had too much breading to him very disappointed the food was hot when we got it and on time but I would consider not trying it again but the person that was for he had fun eating it but I'm too picky in next time I ain't paying that much money"}
{"text":"Also don't believe when they say they will give you a credit for unsatisfactory meal because for some reason they have a tendency to forget they said it.  They no longer have to worry about my business."}
{"text":"I ordered Happy's pizza through grub hub. I ordered the 2 rib tip dinner which comes with 2 lbs of rib tips,2 cups of macaroni salad, 2 pieces of garlic toast and french fries. The french fries were good but, the ribs were really fatty like it was a cheap cut of meat and tasted old. The garlic bread had good flavor but wasn't very toasty and was kinda soggy.I also ordered a piece of peach cobbler which wasn't at all a cobbler but more just piece of cold peach pie. It was cold and the peaches tasted canned and the pie crust was very doughy. The quantity of the food was fair for the price but, the over all quality was not great at all. I would not recommend eating here and I would not eat here again."}
{"text":"This place was ok...not my favorite. They  make everything pizza, bbq ribs, fried chicken, fried fish...nothingvto write home about"}
{"text":"RUN AND RUN FAST! I get it. I realize fast food is fast food. Really I do. I have an iron stomach and take into consideration that the people preparing these meals for us either don't care of just don't know any better. Fine.   Having said all that....HAPPYS PIZZA at this location, is ridiculous. I have given this place FIVE chances to redeem themselves. Each time was delivery and each time it was AT LEAST 20 minutes late and something was either missing or wrong. The last meal was comped by the manager (Mike) and was then WRONG again...even with notes on my account supposedly putting some extra attention on the order. When I complained, I was laughed at and talked down to by the idiot they put in charge of the restaurant. VERY GHETTO and VERY HORRIBLE!!!! STAY AWAY!!!"}
{"text":"This was not that good. The pizza is something like from Chuck E. Cheese. The wings were not great either. Just bland. The BBQ ribs were decent."}
{"text":"I love this place would have wrote a review maybe a month or two about it but never got around to it.  Anyway the service is excellent the pizza is okay I would say its average or maybe close to little caesars pizza quality.  But I really just come here for the wings they are so good and cooked to perfection and the fries, every time I get them they are fresh and crispy and the customer service is top notch not like many other take out places I have been to where it's either really bad or average at best I really like this place and would recommend it to anybody."}
{"text":"It's not really fair that I critique seafood in Las Vegas being that I'm from Louisiana. But, that's what I eat and I expect it done right. To sum things up Happy's serves cheap frozen seafood. I do intend on coming back to try the pizza. The staff says it's great. What's good about this place is friendly staff, prompt service and a large menu. This place might be great. I just know their popcorn shrimp and tilapia is not. I could've gotten the same result in walmart's frozen section."}
{"text":"Head's Up:  The eat 24 specials do not work for the 2 deep dishes for $19.    Pizza is not bad; The place still honored the 2 deep dishes for $19 though they said that it is not a real deal.  The pizza is crispy but doesn't have much cheese on it.  The staff there is very friendly."}
{"text":"Menu looks great food made me VERY UNHAPPY  had no flavor tasted like it had been microwaved  Stay away"}
{"text":"Driver got mad at me asking for money when I had paid using Paypal and tipped him using Paypal as well.  I explained him but without trusting called his store.  Lack of communication between management and drivers.  Food is good."}
{"text":"Have waited 2 hrs multiple times for pizza, it's good but not that good to wait this long."}
{"text":"Terrible, just plain terrible... If no stars existed this place deserves it. Don't eat the food, you're better off with a DiGiorno instead. That's the only tip you will need for this place! Needs to be renamed Crappy's Pizza!!!"}
{"text":"The food is really good. I always order the pizza wings and rib tips. The location is not far from my house but being that I am a busy parent I like to order delievry. They use a system called EAT24 to place your pick up or delivery. The system is pretty accurate but this location never gets my order on time. Each time I wait the full hour for delivery before they notice my ticket. This has happened 3x. I like the food so I keep ordering but this is becoming ridiculous. I'm currently waiting now a hour and 15 mins and still no food."}
{"text":"ordered 29 mega deal with another 8 peace chicken meal at 4:30 started out they didn't have the ribs were that included with the meal that should have been the first warning anyway they said they'd substitute extra chicken which they didn't.. forgot the fries  with the other .. my food got there at 6:30 was cold and burnt..the cookie was substituted for a brownie which was burnt like charcoal.. I called and let them know I was upset about my food and wanted it to be replaced I brought it down myself after I had it delivered and tip the delivery guy $5..the girl at the counter went to get who( I believe was the cook)dark hair glasses and a beard..threw my money at me told me to leave.. horrible customer service..they should fire this guy..not an ounce of decency"}
{"text":"Not good, at all. You could dig in a dumpster and find better more fresh food. Out of everything only the fries were edible.  The fish were old, taste like an old fish tank smells. Most of it we didn't try bc there's white all over it, looks like mold and the inside was a dark brown when we broke it apart.  This place needs a visit from the health department. Absolutely terrible."}
{"text":"Who could give this a good  review? For the first couple of months the place was ok, food was cheap and  pizza is clearly premade frozen. Georgios is not. The only good food here is fried. Their staff consists of rude teenagers. This is pretty much the formula for every Happys. Garbage."}
{"text":"These reviews should be much higher... delicious pizza and ribs/wings at a super affordable price, and it's open till midnight!  My friend and I came into the restaurant at around 11:55pm (5 mins before closing) and had a terrific and quick late night dinner courtesy of Happy's Pizza.  There was some confusion regarding the menu at first (the menu signage above the counter is not accurate, maybe due to the new management, use the paper menus instead), but after that was sorted out, we were genuinely impressed by both the quality and the price of the pizza, and the rib tips and wings we ordered.  The cashier allowed us to sit down at the table to enjoy our take out food even though they were about to close, and one of the employees was kind enough to give us free cans of Pepsi on the house!  It was absolutely worth the price of $25 and change.  I'm surprised by the current Yelp rating of this place and disagree strongly with it--maybe the new ownership is looking to turn things around, but we had a terrific experience and most importantly, quality food.  If you're up late at night and need some great food for a great price, I'd highly recommend checking out Happy's Pizza, and disregard some of the negative reviews until you give this place a chance.  I believe you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I give the food a 6 1/2 out of 10 but the staff there is zero someone needs to tell them how to greet the customer how to smile and not act like they're in the middle of a zombie apocalypse. I don't think I will return to this business again the name does not do this place justice it's happy Pizza not Disgruntled employees."}
{"text":"Yum! If you need a quick pizza come here, or better yet have them deliver. I love the thin crust pizza, will never get papa john's again when we order in. The pizza is always hot, flavorful, and fresh. Plus you can't beat the price and they mail out coupons too!"}
{"text":"Happy's has an eclectic menu, so to say, pizza, sandwiches, ribs, chicken, and I am reluctant with the 5 rating having only been there once.  It's a cramped space at the end of a strip mall, so it works best for delivery or takeout, and that phone rings a lot.  We ordered the medium \"everything\" pizza.  I'm pretty sure the sauce came out of a can, as did the olives, but what makes it is the bread and the assembly.  I'm a fan of thin crust pizza, but as far as the flavor, my preference is a hybrid of New York/California - meaning a New York flavor without the excess grease. And Happy's achieves that.  The bread is a thin crust, and it's chewy without being doughy.  The pizza itself wasn't smothered in sauce - and that was good because the flavor of the bread wasn't overwhelmed, and for the amount of veggies on it, the bread wasn't soggy.  Happy's makes pizza right. I'd take theirs over most pizza joints, gourmet or corner-shops."}
{"text":"I have delivery-ordered a Veggie Pizza (with spinach and sausage) from Happy's Pizza on three occasions within the past few months over your mainstream pizza joints, such as Papa Johns, Pizza Hut, Dominos, etc due to the fact I enjoyed my Veggie Pizza (with spinach and sausage)!   Every time I have ordered a Veggie pizza from other places, I usually complain how there is not enough veggies (what can I say? I love my veggies!) but Happy's Pizza has proven to be different. From the three occasions I have ordered my pizza, it never fails - FRESH veggies are overflowing on top of each other!   I should try other dishes to give it more reviews, but what can I say? When I'm in the mood for pizza, I call Happy's!"}
{"text":"So the bf had a coupon for this place. I noticed that they had SQUARE PIZZA! ( remembering high school when we used to order little Caesars and I would fight for those crispy corners) So we ordered a square pizza with half pepperoni and half mushrooms... (Canned) boo... Opened the box( look of disappointment) smaller than expected.. but we still fought over the corners... The pizza was decent. The sauce was a little too sweet for my taste. So we ordered an \"Italian\" sub they also come with fries. The sub was supposed to have ham,salami,and mortadella..all we could taste was ham..the sandwich was decent and the Italian dressing was weird. It would be a GREAT choice for a lunch special. Also, the fries were GOOD! Hot and potatoey! (I know not a word) not sure how else to describe it. Then we had dessert.. banana pudding YUM!"}
{"text":"I don't know any pizza places near my work so with a quick google search I came across Happy's. The lady on the phone was pretty friendly and I ordered a Hawaiian pizza pie. The pizza itself wasn't bad but wasn't great either. With a name like Happy's, I wasn't really expecting authentic Italian pizza. Hah! Although it wasn't the greatest I have no complaints!"}
{"text":"I was trepidatious about ordering from Happy's. I ordered from a different location and was not very pleased with the food or the service. I ordered online , and when I got there 15 minutes later the food was ready. I got it home and it was so good. The ribs were done perfectly, the french fries were crispy and the coleslaw was nice and creamy. Very happy with this order."}
{"text":"Best pizza ever!  Yummy thick crust! Mm mm mm !   But they wouldn't give me a water cup cause they were out and said I could buy a soda for 1.25 and put water in it... Yeah no.  Super parched.  But either way the pizza is DANK!"}
{"text":"My first visit to HAPPYS and it wasnt good @ all.I ordered rib tips and fries but they just didnt have a good taste to them.I will say go here only when you need something quick to eat."}
{"text":"Pizza is great 5stars  service is okay 3 stars  location really bad 0stars. Place is near a gas staion and doesn't look safe."}
{"text":"I was at a friend's house one Saturday night and he decided to order pizza, so of all the great pizza places in Greater Cleveland, he decided to go with Happy's! What a HORRIBLE decision! When he returned with the pizza, the bottom of the box looked like someone solid it across a grease lot, and the 'pizza' looked like something out of failed experiment. Simply put, this place is a JOKE and has no idea how to make pizza, so, if you want to save your money, and preserve the sanctity of your tastebuds, go elsewhere!"}
{"text":"The biggest pro for me was the service. I felt terrible making a delivery guy go out in an awful snowstorm, but I had no car. Still, the delivery guy was so nice! The food arrived within the time frame they told me to expect. I ordered a small salad but it was still a huge portion. The roast chicken is tasty, it's better with ranch in my opinion. The fries weren't that great though."}
{"text":"1 1/2 hrs for a Sub and Salad Delivery order and still hasn't arrived. When I called to check the person who answered told me the time I called was 11:18 (Time I called to check on order was 12:34). Originally I called at 11:06...was on hold until 11:15 and once on the phone I repeated the order not 2 times but 3 times for a Sub and a Salad. To top it off I even tipped them an extra $5 in advance because I have a service industry background...which is the right thing to do.  Not only were they short and rude...but unapologetic... I wouldn't advise anyone ever to order from there. The price savings are not worth the BS. It is 12:48 now and still no order... 2 hrs for a Sub and Salad? Seriously."}
{"text":"I am very disappointed with the service. I had to call twice. The first time some one hung up on me. The second time they were not sure whether they had a six piece wing meal or a four piece.  I decided on the four piece jumbo wing dinner. When I went to get my order, it was all mixed. They ended up giving me two drum sticks and one wing with one large white piece of chicken. It was not what I ordered. They decided to give me what they wanted me to have."}
{"text":"The menu looked good... We tried several items... Everyone tried a bite of everything.  The \"best\" review went to the kids plain cheese pizza.  Everything else (Ribs, Delux pizza, wings, hot links) was tasted then ignored because... Well... It was just not worth the bother of chewing. Nothing truly BAD to say about the place... Just nothing good to say either.  Meh... Next."}
{"text":"The crust was good & it pretty much stops there! There was so much sauce that it was squishing out everywhere! The beef tasted like it was drenched either in teriyaki sauce or soy sauce. The cheese was cheap, rubbery imitation cheese product. We will not be returning to Happy's Pizza as it made us very unhappy!"}
{"text":"Although most of the staff that I observed were unprofessional and after waiting for my order I realized they were drivers so customer service was good not like the previous reviews I have read.   The store wasn't dirty but there were left over customer receipts on the floor still not a deal breaker.  (DISCLAIMER) I am a fan of Italian and New York style pizzas  The pizza I ordered was a combination pizza they called \"The Supreme\"  Crust was bland, but their choice of cheese was good and it was topped decently.  I wasn't impressed by the pie but still for the price it was ok for a return trip the next day to give them another shot and ordered the \"Everything\" and while this pizza tasted a bit better than the previous \"Supreme\" I will not be returning for the pizza.  I was impressed by their menu choices and am curious about it so when I do decide to give them another visit I will comment on that."}
{"text":"Rude people specially name m.c no customer service skills at all .. It took 2 hours to deliver my pizza & my soda & the delivery driver asking $5  tip so i gave him 5cents i told him share that  to youre co workers,...."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch the other day and was shocked at how bad the service was. I stood there for about 10 minutes waiting to order for dine in and both guys behind the counter were on the phone taking orders. I get it. They were busy. But when one of them got off, he proceeded to go and make orders! He didnt even acknowledge me! As a matter of fact, neither of them acknowledged me. So I wait for another 5 minutes and still the same scenario. I left wondering what the heck were these guys doing? I know both of them saw me but did nothing. Def will be awhile before I even consider coming back if at all. That's too bad because I thought their food was really good.  Yelp 365 Review Challenge #142 \"Saddy's Pizza\""}
{"text":"So I constantly get ads in the mail for this place and finally decided to try it. When we called they were friendly but were placed on hold twice... in one call. Fast forward to almost 2 hours later. (We called after an hour to see what the hold up was, guy claimed the driver had left 7 mins prior.) So the driver hardly spoke english and couldn't find the place. We opened up our food which was 2 medium pizzas, wings, and breadsticks. We also added on fries which were in the same container as the wings so the fries were soaked and soggy. Wings weren't good at all and neither were the fries. Pizza was ok as were the breadsticks. But I wouldn't ordered here again if they paid me, not for a 2 hour wait."}
{"text":"So I was so excited when my roommate texted me to tell me she got pizza for dinner...until I got home.  :(   So we had an antipasti salad, ham pineapple pizza, garlic bread things, and chix nuggets.   The salad was barely edible...cheap bagged nasty iceberg lettuce with unidentifiable lunch meats.  The nuggets were practically sauce less, and the pizza, ewww.   The sauce had a funny weird taste and the cheese on it very plasticky.  The pineapple on it was good..lol.  Guess a bowl of Cheerios it is, I am sure my dogs will be happy though."}
{"text":"I've always had a good experience here.  For fast-food pizza, this place is tops for me.  I always do carry out, so I can't speak to delivery, but my orders are done fast and correct, and the service has been fine.  It's not fancy, artisan pizza, it's fast-food pizza.  As far as fast-food pizza, the price to quality ratio is great.  I can get a large pizza with a few toppings for super cheap.  I usually order my pizzas with extra cheese and a double bake (well done) and it comes out perfect every time.  I'm super happy with this joint."}
{"text":"Simply awful. Boneless wings were piping hot, but nearly black.  They were so overcooked they were inedible.  Their soda fountain offered several bugs in my drink.  Stay away unless you want to tempt fate."}
{"text":"I ordered a large pizza with three toppings, pizza sub, chicken wings and fish.  lets start with the pizza sub 90% bread no little filling. Bland pepperoni and sausage even sauce tasted metallic out of can. The pizza was and same level as the sub. The chicken so over cooked and dried out tasted like grease has not been changed in month. I think that I normally look forward to some left overs I tossed it all out. Sorry."}
{"text":"Well, screw you guys.  Thanks to current management, you'd get zero stars if I could give that. Three bad orders in a row either with things missing or undercooked (despite requesting well done) and then on a Wednesday night they didn't even pick up the phone. I'm done."}
{"text":"This place is awful. I live three minutes away and wait at least an hour for my order each time. When I get my pizza it looks like it has been sitting under a heat lamp all day. It's so disappointing because I've had great Happy's Pizza before. Someone needs to come in and take control of this place. There is no excuse for running a garbage business. It's time to stop making excuses and put this place out of business.  Stop allowing people the belief of entitlement."}
{"text":"The service and professionalism was absolutely pitiful. Cold pizza that was burned an hour ago. Cold burnt pizza. See photo. Fail fail fail."}
{"text":"I have ordered over the phone and through Hub Grub .  I have yet to get an order that was correct.  I tell them NO Peppers on salads and every time I get one there they are.  Ask for a sandwich with no mayo and when it arrives..yep mayo every time.  It's like they can't read or understand English.  Their pizza is over loaded with sauce and it's all you can taste.  I have asked for light sauce and when the pizza arrives there's no sauce.  It's like they're trying to make me angry.  I keep trying.  Hoping someone new will be brought in to manage this store.  The food isn't bad it's just they don't fill orders the way the customer wants.  I'm paying for it so I want it the way I like it.  It's not rocket science."}
{"text":"Omg.  Very clean, very bright. Horrible food except for the fried chicken..ordered a corned beef sandwich. The meat was old hard and petrified like stale beef jerkey.. $9.95 down the frigging drain. I tossed it out the window. What an insult..."}
{"text":"I've ordered here a few times. I have tried a variety of their food from rib tips to popcorn shrimp, fried chicken, chicken tenders and their happy wings. I have ordered thru Uber Eats twice and I just ordered online for pick up over an hour ago. When I walked in to pick up my food the lady upfront was on the phone for a while before another guy walked by to speak to me. I didn't notice until I got home my garlic bread & macaroni salad was missing from my dinner combo. Everything else was great! Will order from here again since it's open late, cheap & close by to my home!"}
{"text":"Woohoo! This food is so good. I ordered the 3 item dinner combo, I chose 3piece cajan perch fish, 1lb rib tips and 3 whole wings  dinner also comes with macaroni  salad pasta and garlic bread. I had plenty to share with family. Delicous.This is my first time ordering and using delivery from this place and it will Not be my last. I just wish I had ordered from here sooner."}
{"text":"Happy's has grown on me since the last review.   Delivery times can be wonkified, but that happens everywhere. Their delivery range is actually fairly large (they deliver as far south as Snow Rd.). Not sure where they intersect with other franchisee's though in the other cardinal directions. That's what phones are for though.  The hand-tossed pizza is ok, but the real deal is the pan crust. It's as thick as a hand-tossed, but crispy without being oily and better than anyone else. It stays crispy even cold! They cook the cheese to the edge, so browned, crispy, cheese lovers pay attention! Spicy coined sausage is where it's at too. My best guess is it's their hot links sliced in house.   Cajun perch is also crispy without being greasy, and a good value. Polish boy has the same issue everyone has - that darn bun won't hold up. Not that I wouldn't order it again. Breadsticks are still meh, but most of the time they are free if you order online.   Something that hasn't been addressed is ordering online. Between the deals, the coupons, and the meal deals, it takes a while to order. Not because of the system, but because there are soooooooooooo many ways to order deals.  And they cater."}
{"text":"Best pizza in East Cleveland...It's has really great food,great workers and now a better manger"}
{"text":"The chicken fingers were salty. The fries seemed stale... maybe reheated.  The burger... well, I don't know what they were trying for.... but they could have kept that too.  Waste of $15..."}
{"text":"You really can't beat the price. I'm a fan. What can I say.  This place is fast and you get a ton of food for what you pay.  I got 2 sides of rib tips, side of hot links (3 dogs) and chicken fingers (fries included) and brought them to a cook out......people loved them.  all that food was in a HUGE box and less than $20.  This is not a restaurant but more of a carry out place"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery. The wings were ok but nothing to write home about and the pizza was mediocre. The ribs didn't seem fresh. I was surprised at the high delivery cost and even more surprised the deliverer stated that they didn't carry silver when I was paying with cash which means you won't be given change back unless it comes out even."}
{"text":"There's an interesting adage among men that goes, \"sex is like pizza, there's no such thing as bad pizza.\" Well I'm not going to ruminate on the former right now, but the latter myth about the pizza has been completely debunked by Happys Pizza.   I'll start with the highlights. I was drawn into the store by an empty stomach with a pizza craving, the \"neon light sign on acid\" Happys Pizza pizza parlor decor, and the promise of a large specialty pizza for a mere $10 bucks approximately. It gets better. Three \"barely-legal\" young ladies happily welcomed me into the well-lit, hiphop-music filled point-of-sale. These things are what earned my one star rating but sadly, from there it was downhill...   Barely after I entered my order, paid, and retreated to the window sill seating, I noticed just how \"Happy\" the staff really was to be there. The counter staff immediately began texting, loudly gossiping all their business, and actually serving themselves soda in paper cups directly from the 2-Liter customer cooler behind the register. I half expected them to put the half-drained 2-liter bottle back in the cooler when they were done, to keep it cool.   My comfortable perch on the window sill allowed me to also observe the staff preparing the food. Things weren't quite so festive back there. First of all, the ethnic divide was stark and more than obvious. Trust me, walking from the counter to the back seemed tantamount to walking into a different neighborhood or maybe even a different country...and they were consistently working. I was p!$$@d for them, so I could imagine how they felt. I was just hoping at this point that they weren't taking it out on my pizza.   Surprisingly the pizza was finished on time, although I wouldn't have known it if I was relying on the counter staff. I had to interrupt one of the girls who was on her cell phone when I realized the box that had been placed on the rack behind the counter had my name on it. Without interrupting her convo she handed me my dinner...she did give a big smile and mouth the words \"Thank You\" tho.  Now for the food. I'll make it quick. I'll just say that the pizza was like nothing I have tasted before...not in a good way. The pizza sauce was a weird kind of sweet, much sweeter than any I have ever tasted...makes me suspect ketchup, and the crust was very bland...and I am a crust guy. I got a vegy specialty pizza and we'll just say the veggies were nowhere near the level of let's say a Dewey's, let alone a Papa John's or other chain. They seemed canned.  What should I expect from a $10 specialty pizza right? I couldn't eat more than one piece. I didn't bother to take it back.   For a second, I was a bit worried about my unique name attached to this review and having to take on an alias if I ever went back to Happys, then I had to check myself...I'm never going to be going back to Happys."}
{"text":"\"Mediocre reviews.  Terrible service.  Decent food.\"  Our expectations were tempered by these previous Yelp reviews.  But it was late night and we were hungry, and food quality was more important than service.  Bracing for the worst, I called ahead to check to see if they still had food available.  \"Hello?\"  answered a soulless voice from the other side.   \"Do you still have pizza?\" I inquired.   \"Yes.\"   \"Can I put an order in?\"   \"Yes.\"  Another one word answer.  I wasn't expecting much, but I gave my order, and at least the human on the other side was able to function accordingly.  We drove to Happy's, and as expected, we went unacknowledged by the cashier.  To get our food, we had to be proactive.  So we politely asked about our order.  Finally, as if awakened from a daydream, the lady looked up.  She smiled, and suddenly we were in a different world.  Sure, the menus posted are wrong, and the staff is missing the instinct for meeting our standard expectations for service, but they are genuinely nice people trying to do a good job, and are warm and friendly once they open up.  They let us sit in the dining area after hours, got us our food quickly, and even gave us free soda.  Furthermore, the food was really, really good!  We not only got pizza, but also ended up adding the rib tips and wings.  Everything was hot, tasty, and great value.  Went well beyond our expectations.    Recommended - but you really need to give them a chance in order for them to shine."}
{"text":"Very UNHAPPY with Happy's. My son LOVES their pizza, and that is the ONLY reason I put up with them. It always takes at least one hour for food to be delivered. Twice it took them 1 1/2 hours, and when we got the food, it was cold... DUH. Three other times the pizza we ordered arrived with toppings that we did not ask for or want. Really Happy's? Hire some more delivery drivers if this seems to be an ongoing issue with lots of people. Service is not JUST for tourists who eat your food once. Locals need decens places. BTW- Food, when it does come , is average. Not worth all of the hassle"}
{"text":"Seriously. ..how do you run out of ribs on a Sunday at 5? First they are way overpriced, but to not have any. .then instead of saying something like \"we're sorry,  but right now we're out of ribs\", she says \"oh we don't have ribs\". I told her I was looking at a menu, and you do offer ribs. She says to me like an idiot,  \"I said were out of ribs\". Not like any of the food here is that good anyways. ...last time for me. ..."}
{"text":"Called to order pizza a few days ago my first time ever trying Happy Pizza. The actual owner of the business gave me coupons to try them out. Of course it gave me idea to try them even more! Well so I was hungry it was 1 hour before they close and I asked for delivery and they said we don't deliver 1 hour before closing. (The MENU the owner gave me said Delivery ALL DAY) ok fine understandable. So I ask for carry out and the employee once again declined me for ordering the pizza saying it was too late in case I didn't show up. I offered to pay over the phone to secure my purchase and he seriously declined me. Happy Pizza lost my business and I was never given the opportunity to even purchase from them. I have free pizza coupons that will be destroyed because that's how disappointed I was. I was basically refused business after attempting to order delivery and pick up. The employee stated he didn't want to do it because sometimes people order and they don't pick up even when I told him to take my payment over the phone."}
{"text":"I don't like to beat up on restaurants, but in this day and age it shouldn't be difficult to find a good pizza dough recipe. You know the owners know what good pizza is and they probably don't eat this.    I don't know a lot about making pizza but this dough is that flat white cardboard type dough (probably easier to prepare and cheaper) and the toppings just sort of sit on top and fall off if you move one of the slices because there isnt enough cheese to hold it all together. The pizza was $10 for a small which is cheap but not cheap enough to overlook the bad dough, low cheese and not enough sauce. Dough sauce and cheese are relatively cheap. It was covered with toppings (mushrooms were those canned tomatoes ones you see on cheap pizza) but I could have done with less topping and better dough, cheese and sauce.   As a business traveler if I found a good pizza joint with fair prices I'd order again in the future. I won't order pizza from Happy's again unless they take some.of this as constructive criticism and update their recipes and buying practices.  Salad was good.   Rib tips good.   Delivery was fast."}
{"text":"I've enjoyed eating whole chicken wings at Happys Pizza for several years. I enjoy it so much that I drive from north of Ann Road and take out of town guests.  Unfortunately today was an UNHAPPY DAY for my $30 chicken order!  The chicken was dark and appeared over cooked! When I told the chef, his 1st response was \"it all looks the same and if I leave it in any shorter time it'll be uncooked. So I'll give you your money back. \" I said many times that it was unfortunate because I'd waited patiently and I had people waiting. When I noticed that some pieces were \"good\" the chef said the other pieces probably were \"breaded\" different. I'm not sure what that meant so asked if the breading was good - of course he said yes.   I was disappointed that he didn't offer to cook another batch.  At the end I took the \"OVER BREADED DARK CHICKEN \" home and we weren't happy.  IT WAS A STEP BEFORE RUBBERY"}
{"text":"Better than I expected! Ordered the wings, large round pizza & deep dish large pizza. The wings were great, the round pizza tasted good, yes they use like canned mushrooms but my family liked it n the crust was tasty. As for the deep dish I would pass on it next time. It was like biting into a big piece of bread there wasn't enough sauce cheese or toppings, definitely not worth the extra $1 they charge for it. Well can't wait to try the many other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"While the food was okay & I purchased 3 different times, the stress of having to deal with this company isn't worth it. And make note that they have closed down their other location which begs the question why. The owner told me he was here from out East to expand the name. Beware franchisees.  1. First time I ordered they made mistake after mistake. The corned beef wasn't on an onion bun as advertised. The all drumsticks I requested came with wings. The thin crust wasn't thin.  2. When I called the second time, I found out the owner George was now in town from Michigan & had only been here a month. Oh & I had left a message in MI at the head office re: what happened & no one returned my call.  George said he would make my next order right, but didn't give me one thing to compensate me for what had happened. I even suggested he give me a piece of cake on the house & he didn't. Fine, I accepted that.  3. Then the fish I ordered for $10 didn't taste good like after the first time I had tried them, so I called again. I mean that's a lot of money.  This time George gave me a pizza on the house if I ordered $10 worth of other items.  4. On my 3rd time just before I ordered my very last time as I just moved out of the area, I thought they got the order correct, but they forgot to put banana peppers on my pizza which I was charged for. I called up & the guy said he would give me a $3 credit for my trouble. I said on my credit card please (I knew I was moving).  Well it never showed up on my credit card & so I called just a second ago & George ended up being an as*hole.   He tried to play games with me as if I'm stupid & he can pull one over on me.  First he said his credit card machine can't do refunds. LOL, yeh right. Then he wanted me to get there to pick up the $3 all the way from Summerlin even though I told him 3 times I HAVE NO CAR & it takes 20+ minutes by car to get there. And if this idiot thinks I'm going to take a bus just to recoup  $3, then he really is an idiot.   Then he tried to up it to $5 as if the $5 would even compensate the $5 bus fare AND around 4 hours of lost time.  I told him if he doesn't know how to do a refund on the machine, to call his bank & they will show him. His next BS was about how he doesn't have my card so he can't give me a refund. I said when I buy you don't have my card either, but you take it over the phone. Here you want it I asked him? He didn't want to take it down.  He said he'll come to me & drop it off. I said do you want to? Sure, fine, I don't care. I even suggested he mail me a check.   When he didn't follow through on either suggestion (his or mine), I asked, \"are you refusing to give me my money back? Just say so.\" I was already on the phone arguing with this p*ick 10 minutes now. I said when you figure out what you want to do, call me back & let me know.   Then about 2 minutes later he parroted what I just said & told ME to call him when I figure out what I want to do after. LOL Yeh try to play mind games with me George, it ain't going to work.  Oh & at some point he said he doesn't have the authorization to do a refund (another lie). I said you are the OWNER, how can you can not have the authorization. He then lied & said I'm NOT the owner, & asked me, \"who told you that?\"  I finally hung up the phone on him when I realized this cheap bast*ard is a chronic liar, he will do everything in his power not to make good on anything. I'm surprised now he even gave me the free pizza. Probably because it costs him so little to make one & he knew I'd order $20 more of other food which I had. Every time I ordered the bill was around $25-30."}
{"text":"My first contact with Happy's Pizza did not bode well for a good experience. When they first opened their Detroit Avenue location someone came buy and put a delivery menu on my front door. I live off of Detroit Avenue.. In Lakewood. Since we basically live on the same street as the restaurant and someone from Happy's placed the menu on my door, I naturally assumed that they would deliver to my house. Wishing to try them out, I called and was told they don't deliver to Lakewood (which is five minutes from them) to which I pondered why did you put menus on every door in a town you don't deliver to? But I digress.  Last night I was in the mood for something new and had just got (another) menu for Happy's, this time in the mail. I decided to order the deep dish pizza with an order of BBQ rib tips. I even decided to take the five minute drive to pick it up.   My order was ready when I arrived and I headed home (skeptically)  to try it out.   I have to admit I was not that disappointed. I reminded me of a slightly more robust Donato's (which I like) and definitely quenched my appetite for some new pizza. The rib tips were hot and sloppy (that's a good thing) maybe slightly overcooked and not very tender, but not bad for a \"fast food\" kind of place.   They have a very large and eclectic menu and very reasonable prices, some of the deals are downright crazy. I am sure I will repeat again if I get tired of the few places to choose from in Lakewood."}
{"text":"I am new to this area of Las Vegas so checking out some of the less known eateries is always a scary event.  Today we tried Happy's Pizza.  I must say I was more than pleasantly surprised!  On the website they have a coupon for a large two topping pizza, stuffed cheese bread and pop for $15.  A great price!  The guy on the phone was very friendly and personal nothing like the major chains were I always feel like I am bothering them.  I was told 45 minutes to a hour, in the back of my mind I was thinking yea right its Saturday nite.  Right on time at 46 minutes the delivery guy was at my door.  Sadly he forgot my Coke but said he would be back with 2 Cokes to make up for the mistake.  The pizza was hot and tasty.  The onions were actually cooked and not raw like they can be.  The crust was hand tossed and not doughy.  The stuffed cheese bread was the best!!!!!  The crust was perfect and the combo of garlic butter and melted cheese was right on!    Not in the mood for pizza?  No problem!  Happy's Pizza has burgers, sandwiches and even deep fried seafood.  And dessert!!!  I highly recommend and Happy's Pizza has a new fan and made me Happy!"}

{"text":"Well like everything in Vegas nothing is consistent ....i was trying to treat my staff to the great food I experienced and im sure the food would've been great except I ordered 60 bucks worth of fried food and they forgot my ranch so I called and they apologized and said it was on its way well after I called 5 times over a period of an hour (each time promising 10 mins it would be there) I had cold soggy food that no body wanted I ask why I was lied to and they (Jessica and a manager) explained to me I should be happy they didn't charge me for the ranch and said they can't stop everything just to bring us ranch. I asked why I drop everything for my customers when they need something fixed that was my fault (good business practices I think that's what it's called) so I explained that I had nothing but great things to say about this place on yelp and I would love to keep it that way and they told me have fun changing it and then I requested them to come pick up my food and refund me it was two hours into this now and i felt severly insulted and decided to take my business elsewhere"}

{"text":"Whenever I visit my Aunt, she seems to order from this place. Why? I have no idea. I'll ignore the fact that the place is in East Cleveland, the most dangerous little suburb in the world.  The pizza is just weird. I mean, it's not inedible or significantly handicapped. It's just strange. It looked kind of like the play pizza little kids play with. It looked perfect on the outside. The sauce is sweet, like, really sweet. Sweeter than BBQ sauce. Like, if I ate enough of the sauce I would be diabetic. The cheese was thin and flavorless. I have reservations about the quality of the meats and vegetables used as toppings.   I mean, I wouldn't refuse a piece of pizza from here, I just wouldn't spend my own money here."}
{"text":"I literally just picked up my order from here. When I walked up to the door it was filthy, upon entering I was hit with a foul stench of sewer. There were 3 young men and a young lady all standing around, cleaning products were unattended in the dining room, the restaurant was very dirt especially the floors. I didn't want to be rude so I payed my 31.00 for my family meal (large pizza breads ticks salad and a 2 liter, we added boneless wings on) when I got home my pizza was cold and disgusting,  the bread sticks also cold ( when I got there they forgot part of my order so pizza and bread sticks sat for about 10 mins.)  I gave our whole order to our dogs because we just couldn't stomach it.. I'm only giving 2 stars because one of the young men was very polite. The young lady had an irritated look on her face .. I won't be back. They can't even fix this one. ."}

Seriously, I wonder if the manager knows about shutting down a full half hour before closing."}
{"text":"Up until tonight I ordered from this location at LEAST twice a week. Tonight they made my order wrong, not the first time, but the first time I decided to call and ask them about it. The woman who answered the phone immediately got an attitude with me, insinuated that I was lying, and then passed me off to someone claiming to be the owner. He proceeds to tell me that he made my pizza correctly and that the problem was me. Obviously I won't be spending my money there again. If you live in Old Brooklyn, save yourself the time and the hassle and spend your money at one of the many other pizza joints in the area that actually care about their customers."}
{"text":"Absolute garbage so I called and placed my order over the phone since their website keep saying I'm not in their delivery range even though I can see them through my window. I was told over the phone that it will be 45 min- an hour. Fine they processed my card over the phone. An hour later no food so I called back, now he wants to claim he told us an hour and 20 minutes which is complete BS who would agree to that?!! So he said he'll send some one over with the food which still took over the hour and 20 minutes. The order for the food was on my card but I made it clear I was paying for the drinks in cash. The driver they sent had no change on them, then had the nerve to tell me I can't get my drink because she came unprepared! She went in the car and spoke to the guy who was driving for over 10 minutes just to come back and tell me he same thing. So I told her she can take the food back I don't want it and to refund my money back to my card. I called the shop after to request my money back for him to get smart and say I was lying how he told the young lady to give me the drink. Keep in mind I have 3 witnesses starting from the phone call. Then he said he needs my card number again to issue the refund. I told him no worries I'll come up personally to show him the card because I don't trust them with my card info for a \"refund\" I want a receipt as proof. When I went up he just told me hold on and turned his back on me to answer the phone. He tried to do it a second Time so I just told him whoever it is just going to hear my voice in the background and that seem to get his attention. TLDR NEVER EAT HERE!!!"}
{"text":"Ate dinner here and it was amazing. The pizza was good the sandwich I ordered was awesome. The prices are great four of us split a pizza, sandwich, and a huge portion of chili cheese fries for under 20 dollars. The location isn't the best if you are staying on the strip without a car but with a car it is just a few minutes down the road."}
{"text":"Ordered first time here for delivery. Took 1 hr and a half for my order. Time ordered 12:28, estimated delivery 1:43, arrived at 2:10. Called to request for refund because estimated delivery was over 20 minutes, a lady answered and said the driver should be there soon and that if he isn't there to give her a call back. Waited 10 minutes so I called back and as she transferred me to someone else, the driver got here. The guy on the phone excuse is \" when u order online through eat24 we don't get the order until 20 minutes later\" are u serious??! Then if that's the case find another way to set up your order on line.but then again they are liars because my receipt shows order receipt or receive printed  was 12:33pm. That's 5 minutes not 20 minutes! Please don't try to excuse yourself with a lie. Pictures attached. Now let's talk about the food. Nasty! Soda was not cold, fingers / fries soggy. Pizza tasted like a frozen pizza and not made fresh. Not ordering here again!"}
{"text":"I have had the pizza and wings many times, but it's just because of family purchasing it. It's just boring.   Not enough toppings, sauce is exactly as the same as all other pizza companies.   They just don't stand out as anything fresh or different."}
{"text":"We ordered from the new Happy's on Puritas. My boyfriend loved his rib tips and for $8, we found it to be a good value. My veggie sub was pretty bland and lacking in veggies. Great sandwich if you like just bread with little filling. We'll probably not be regulars as there are many other pizza/sub places that offer better food in the area. Not the worst food we've ever had though."}
{"text":"This review is for delivery only.  Every time I went to the old Smiths that (was) in the same parking lot, I always would say to my roommate \"We should try that place.\"  Well, this past Thursday, we ordered delivery.  Or I should say, he did, while I was still at work.  The delivery time was long.  It took over an hour for the food to arrive, and we are literally around the corner.  Now...we did order 2 pizzas, a piece or two of fish, and chicken wings, but...still...that just seems like a long time to wait.    The fish was gross.   Not my favorite at all. I'm not a fan of wings, but my roommate enjoyed them.   The pizzas were good, for the price.  But it really bothered me that they used canned mushrooms instead of fresh.    For the price, I'd probably order here again.  It was pretty cheap, and decent quality.  The pizza reheats REALLY well, too.   Not my favorite place, but not too shabby."}
{"text":"Happy's pizza.. None of us are happy right now. We ordered a deep dish and got a regular pizza. I mean it's not that hard to  push some buttons to get an order right. But apparently it seems to be for these people.   I wish I could post a picture of this but yelp isn't letting me"}
{"text":"Time-Day 7pm Wednesday. For mid-week, we waited 1 hour and 15 minutes for delivery - from Det. SW to OHC. 1 med pizza w/two toppings and 1 large \"Hawaiian\" plus a 2 ltr. was $30. Yeah I thought that was kind of ridiculous, but it was 90 degrees outside, I have no car, and our microwave is broken. So it was either pizza delivery or walk to the convenience store at the corner of Fulton and Lorain to get overpriced junk with a side of crazy, drunk panhandlers. Well, having had a sandwich from that Happy's location that was mediocre at best, I wasn't expecting miracles. The pizza was passable at least. Toppings were all in place, and unlike the pizza we got from Nunzio's and sent back, it wasn't so greasy that it could qualify as a colonic. Overall, if I had little other choice, I'd order from Happy's again. It just seems kind of pricey for something that wasn't really much better than Little Ceasar's $5 round. The search for good delivery pizza in OHC continues. Damn Marco's on Memphis won't deliver over the bridge, so for now my money's on Guy's pizza on Superior. (by the way fellow Yelpers, just know how happy I am to be back in CLE writing about all these places I thought I might never call home again!)"}
{"text":"Oh man. I wish I had put a tarp down first in my car.  I had houseguests this past weekend, arriving right at dinnertime. Because I also had to run into Marc's on Puritas (never again, but that's a different story), I decided to pick up a pizza from Happy's next door. Apparently, there are a few of these places around town, but I've never really noticed any other locations.   Verdict? It was both awesome and horrifying. I mean, on one hand: everyone enjoyed the food (which was super cheap for the size of the order), but I'll be scrubbing the smell of fried chicken grease out of my car's hatchback for the next few months.   All in all, I probably would order from them again if I needed cheap, good pizza for a crowd."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery and was quoted a time of 45/60 mins. At the hour mark I called and they said it was on its way. I check and they were .04 miles from the place I was staying. 20 mins later I called back to cancel and they told be delivery driver would be there in a min. Long story short everything was cold and no very good. Won't order from here again."}
{"text":"Ordered through Uber Eats and had a ridiculously long wait time. Called the restaurant to see if our food was still being prepared, and we were told the order was ready but they were waiting for a driver. Then they told us the driver was there and we'd get our food soon. We asked if the food was still hot and the person on the phone told us, in a stroke of utter silliness, that she didn't want to touch our food to check. We were asking if there was a heat lamp or something of the like, not for her to touch our food--their customer service is terrible.  I wish I could say something about the food, but after they got us off the phone by saying our food was on the way, our order got canceled five minutes later. DO NOT order here."}
{"text":"I ordered the $29.99 deal. Chicken was great, ribs were okay, my cookie was hard as cement and my pizza was not done and this was after waiting 35 mins for my food when they said 15 mins!"}
{"text":"First time here. Welcome relief from Marriott food (.2 mi). Wide variety from pizza to ribs. Prices are reasonable and the deliver to local hotels. I ordered the chicken Hani special (chicken in pita). It was pretty good. I would of used a thinner pita and shredded cheese.  Restaurant and bathroom  was clean. Overall, I would eat here again. For the health conscious this is not for you"}
{"text":"Yestereday as we were debating what we wanted to do for lunch one of the managers of Happy's Pizza stopped in to drop off some menus and let us know they opened last week. Their menu was impressive with the range of food, and the prices were extremely reasonable.  My growling stomach talked with a co-worker's empty stomach and we decided on: - Pizza Sub - Chicken Parmesan Sub - Cleveland Polish Boy Hot Dog - Mac n Cheese wedges - Chicken Fingers & fries - Peach Cobbler  We opted for pick-up as I wanted to see their restaurant, and I just love to drive. The inside of the restaurant is basically a counter, soda fountain and a couple 2 person tables. However, they do offer an outdoor patio, which for this  weather would be a perfect place to eat.  By the time I made it back to work with the full-sized, brown paper grocery bag, my car smelled so good, I am surprised I did not eat everything while I drove.  The portions were very healthy sized, good value, friendly staff (if a bit overwhelmed during their first week), as I type this and look at the menu, I want to order more for today!"}
{"text":"Horrible. The first few times I ordered the food was hot and favorable. But the last time I ordered the food was old, cold and took over 95minutes to get to my house. I contacted 24eats and explained to them that the food was inedible and that my dogs wouldn't even touch it.  They said they would have Happy's make fresh food and bring it out never happened. Instead Happy's said that since it had been over an hour they were not going to fix it. It wasn't my fault it was over an hour since they didn't get it to me in the 45 to 70 minutes they promised. It was over 95 minutes before we got our food. Ended up throwing out over $40 worth of food I Was pissed.  My family will never be ordering from here again. Horrible food horrible customer service. They really need to do something about the store."}
{"text":"Seriously the best service ever!!!! I called and ordered a delivery,  got a bacon cheese buger, spicy chicken fingers and regular chicken fingers, and fries!!! So good!!!! Friendly lady that answered, amazing delivery driver!!(seriously you were the best) !! Seriously the best one yet!!!!!!! I ordered at 5:56pm and I had my order at my house by 6:30pm seriously amazing people!!!!!! Thank you so so so much!!!!!!!!  The McAllister's!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"First off, AWESOME PORTIONS! Lot's of flavour in the fish and shrimp and they include all the necessary condiments. It was like having a seafood restaurant delivered to your doorstep."}
{"text":"Think... Polands Great Depression. They were feasting compared to this joint..."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good food. Try the rib tips!! And the Cajun fried cod. The restaurant looked clean and well-cared for, too."}
{"text":"Ok so had passed this place previously while they were pretty much under construction. I was thinking oh great another pizza joint set up on a crappy corner.  Well I decided to check it out once opened...so here I am after getting a taste of the goods :)  First of all the place has a massive menu! I mean MASSIVE in every sense of the word! lol  It was almost impossible to decide on what to try, as I reviewed one item after another, each became more desirable and so on.  Decided to do the lunch specials since we were there between 10-3pm why not plus we can try multiple things and not break the bank! lol All lunch specials are $5.  We ordered three lunch specials and split them between the two of us.  1. small pep pizza, can't go to Happy's pizza and not order a pizza pie! 2. Jumbo fried shrimp dinner w/fries and coleslaw 3. any 6 inch sub and fries, we tried the Italian which came with a yummy Italian dressing! Mmmmm yum!  Three lunch specials at $5x3 plus two drinks our total was change short of a $20!  The pizza was good, a nice sweet sauce, fresh, cheesy and the crust was chewy and good.  The Italian sub was great, good flavor.  The fried shrimp were good, makes for a nice appetizer.  They have good french fries, enjoyed them lots.  Their coleslaw is different and delicious! I suggest trying it!  Next time I will save room for dessert, def want to try their banana pudding!"}
{"text":"Love love this place. Amazing food amazing service and now under new management new hours clean place and a lot of delivery drivers. If I can give more stars I would easy parking and right I front of the rta station. I see change.. and you can taste change. This is my new go to place."}
{"text":"Happy's Pizza is our new favorite delivery place. I am thrilled to be able to say goodbye to Dominos and Pizza Hut!   First of all, they run great specials that make it affordable to feed your family...plus, it's delicious. The crust is soft and delicious. The sauce is flavorful and the toppings are generous and tasty. We literally devout these pizzas when they come.   We have also tried the wings, and they were crispy and flavorful, with plenty of sauce.   We order from Happy's just about every week. The staff is also friendly and courteous."}
