{"text":"I was dying to try this place being of German/Polish decent, boy was I disappointed! Hubby had the German Bockwurst & fries, it was like a giant boiled hot dog, fries OK. I had the Schnitzel Vienna Style, the pork was very dried out, no taste. Now I have eaten quite a few potato pancakes in my day, my mom used to grate them by hand, and fry them in a pan. These were like the took leftover mashed potato formed them into a patty and deep fried them! MUSHY!  Needless to say my long awaited adventure clear across town was a bust, save your money!"}
{"text":"We have dined at the Bavarian Castle at least four times.  I love this place.  When I have a craving for schnitzel, I head right over.  Their schnitzel is better than any I have had in town.  My husband is a bit more adventurous.  He has had the Sauerbraten, Rouladen, and Sausage Platter.  He has enjoyed every plate.  We took my sister in her birthday and she loved this place as well.  We all love German food.

This is a small family run business so you should expect the challenges that small family run restaurants may present. This isn't a large chain or strip restaurant that hires more employees than they really need. The family is very kind. I think they really appreciate their customers.

If you come I would advise a reservation...you never know when the surrounding neighborhood is going to have a crave for german food.  We came one Saurdy at 5:00PM and it was full!

Don't forget dessert...we had a chocolate bread pudding with sauce and it was amazing.  The apple strudel is out of this world!"}
{"text":"Wonderful service and shockingly delicious food. Do not pass this place up if you are in the neighborhood. Very rarely do you actually feel like an invited guest in someone's home, but here I was welcomed warmly and had pleasant conversation with the staff and other guests throughout my entire meal. I am first generation in the US with my fathers side hailing from Germany. I know the cuisine well and here it was delicious! I highly recommend the strudel to everyone. Wonderbar!"}
{"text":"Food was great. Expensive but you honestly get a home cooked dinner at a restaurant which isn't easy these days"}
{"text":"Just finished the most amazing Rahmschnitzel, served by the fantastic crew of this German gem. Will definitely frequent often."}
{"text":"I'd say 2.5 stars. Decent but odd dining room. Food is better than the looks of the place would lead you to believe. 
If you're just interested in good food this place will fit the bill. If you're looking for more of an \"experience\" then another place may be better suited for what you are looking for."}
{"text":"Did lunch there,  table had 4 Schnitzel's 3 different ways.  Ail of them were tough. Grew up in Germany so it was diaapointing. The taste, however,  was good, as was most everything.  German beer on tap was a treat.  Not sure if it was due to lunch time chef or what. Chewy schnitzel. I'll have to give it another try and see if we got them at a bad time."}
{"text":"Authentic German food, charming decor, and great service. Will definitely be coming back. If you're in the mood for a home cooked meal, Bavarian Caste won't disappoint. Kristy was our server. She was super friendly and made our meal extra special."}
{"text":"This restaurant has very authentic and high quality German food.

My mother-in-law is a native German and a fantastic cook.  We visit Germany often and love German food.  My favorite dish, which my mother-in-law is a master at making, is Rouladen.  The Rouladen at Bavarian Castle was every bit as good and a recommended dish.  I only wish you got two of them for the price of the plate (one of the more expensive entrées).

The Red Cabbage and Dumpling that came with it was also very good and similar to that found in Germany.  But I do think my mother-in-law's is a bit better.  So do try the Rouladen.

My wife got a Bratwurst and it was definitely a good one.  The sauerkraut was good, too, just like in Germany: not overly vinegary like the stuff in jars at the grocery store.

I really wanted to give the place 5 stars but there are a few things that hurt it a little.  The ambiance is not authentic and a bit to be desired.  Standard textured gypsum-board walls with monochromatic (light blue) paint, tera cotta tiles, a hot, bright summer sun coming through the glass, a noisy refrigeration system on the soda machine (which is in the dining area and shouldn't be), poorly cushioned bench seating, and several other things dampened the ambiance.  And they really need a beer Garden to get the true German experience!

I also thought the dinners were just a bit expensive.  (Actually, they are cheaper than the German prices, but in Germany the service is included in the pricing).  I think they need to consider that Americans are a bit cheaper (in every way).  The German beer is also more expensive, considering the bottles are only 330ml.

I hear their lunch pricing is better, though it is a simpler menu.  Might be a great place for lunch.  But I imagine we'll be back for dinner, should my mother-in-law need a break from cooking!"}
{"text":"The food is excellent, but the service is just terrible.   They are just not friendly enough to warrant the prices.

No smiles, no chit chat, nothing."}
{"text":"Wonderful dining experience - prices reasonable, service good. From Deutschland native: \"best Deutsch menu I've ever had on this side of the pond.\"
We keep going back. Gerlinde D.

{"text":"Hands down the best German restaurant in Las Vegas. They were out of the potato pancakes but everything else was excellent.  Save room for dessert and get the strudel, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Adam W

Unfortunately I wasn't too impressed about the restaurant and the food.. Nevertheless I will start with what I enjoyed.. German cuisine is not Always the most popular but to prepare the many exotic dishes... It's going to be tough to compete.  The service and atmosphere was nice.  But when it comes to the food. You better win the customer over on the first visit if you want repeat customers. The presentation is and must be atr
Attractive to the eye and and the taste must be able to stop the talking at the table but afterwards not stop by getting the word out.  I had the pretzel dumplings with gravey and mushrooms. . Sounds good and tastes good... But I just wished they had put real pretzel Instead of rye bread. Will I go back... Probably not... There are just too many other eateries that will give you a better experience."}
{"text":"Our second visit to the restaurant was as good as the first.  Home cooking.  Friendly service. we've samples the sausages, beer and the cutlery with mushrooms along with sauerbraten. Alm have been good."}
{"text":"I had a cup of Lentil Soup, a small basic House Salad, the Schnitzel with Cream Sauce and Spaetzle plus the Apple Strudel for Desert. The Soup was Excellent, nicely flavored broth with a hint of Bay Leaf, Beans, Beef plus Sausage bits flavored this Soup just perfect. The tender Schnitzel was lightly Breaded and perfectly cooked then topped with a Mushroom Cream sauce (again far better than expected). The home made Spaetzle after cooking was buttered and lightly Fried for an extra bit of lightly done crunch. The Apple Strudel had a perfect combination of Tartness and Sweetness cooked in a Flour Dough Roll (Not Philo). This place is Authentic German Home Cooking with almost everything cooked from Scratch - even the Sauerbraten (which takes Days). My only complaint was Price and Atmosphere. Counting Tip this meal was $ 35.00. The Atmosphere is very Basic in a nondescript Strip Mall and the reason I did not give it 5 Stars."}
{"text":"My friends and I went there on Saturday and was so disappointed in the food and the service needs improvement as well.  I have never tasted sauerkraut like that or the German Potato Salad was like mush, tasted like the mashed potato's and my friends got the Schnitzel and it tasted like it had been soaked in vinegar...all in all not a great experience and a total waste of money.
My friend was raised in Germany and I was raised eating some German food as well and I am a better cook than that, if that is what it takes to open a restaurant then I know mine would be much better.
And the girl looked underage to be serving beer.

Save your money and go elsewhere"}
{"text":"Great place to get German food. The owners, Rainer and Ulrike are friendly and attentive. The food was hot and the beer was cold. I came in on a Sunday night and there was only one other couple that was seated. After they left, we had the entire restaurant to ourselves. That was nice but also disheartening as well. The pretzel was perfect and I enjoyed the schnitzel as well."}
{"text":"I was really excited to experience this restaurant, but left feeling a little disappointed. The ambience is fair for a strip mall location. The food was served luke warm and did not have the flavor we have come to expect from the likes of finer quality German restaurants such as the Hofbräuhaus or Cafe Berlin."}
{"text":"I've got to set the record straight...  I believe the glowing reviews of this place have GOT to be plants -- friends and family who are trying to do the restaurant owners a favor...

We went there last night and the food was absolutely dreadful.  The meat in my dinner had a terrible texture and taste to it, and was very dried out.  It was (fortunately) slathered in some kind of brown sauce so I could try to disguise it and sorta' choke it down.  The noodles on the plate were totally flavorless.  The cabbage was just okay.  I wound up mixing all three components together and hosing the entire dinner down with salt three times to try to make it semi-palatable.

Normally I take leftovers home, but not last night...  I left it half-eaten for the busboy to return to the kitchen, who apparently sees that behavior a lot because they never even noticed that the dinner had pretty much gone uneaten.  Considering that the entrees were priced in the mid 20's, that's some pretty expensive crappy food.

My husband's dinner was also pretty inedible.  Even the salad was terrible...  sounds crazy, but I challenge anyone to try to eat that salad and not come away with a thought process along the lines of \"what a waste of calories.\"  

Even our WAITER was bland...  and their processes were a mess.  The father was apparently responsible for running payments, but only did so AFTER he quit circulating through the room chatting with those patrons who speak German.  We waited a good 20 minutes just to get our check and then another 10 minutes just to get our credit card slip back.  

If I could give this place ZERO stars I would... NEVER going there again.  Yuck!!  :-("}
{"text":"New customer lost to greedy owner.
First visit today for a quick lunch.  Ice tea came, my wife took one sip and said she did not like it and  sent it back and only had water.  Schnitzel was bland and Beer Bratwurst was sub-par.  The lentil soup however was delicious.  Check came with charge for tea which I questioned and was told that owner said she had a sip so we had to pay for it!!!  You've got to be kidding...will now not go back. Also, pre-packaged yellow mustard in a German restaurant."}
{"text":"Excellent food and very friendly people. I spent a summer in Germany and this took me back! Quite authentic and delicious!"}
{"text":"Excellent service. Authentic atmosphere. Amazing food. This is my second visit, I would eat here everyday if I could."}
{"text":"I grew up eating German dishes on occasion, but it wasn't until I had a layover in Germany that I began to really appreciate the cuisine. I was excited when I learned that Bavarian Castle opened in my neighborhood. We stopped in for dinner. When we walked in there were no warm greetings. Staff was a bit stand offish, just as we were about to turn around and leave another gentleman appeared and invited us to sit down. Boy! Am I glad we didn't go.

Immediately, we were pleased to see they had König Ludwig Weissbier. It is one of our favorite beers that can sometimes be a rare find. We ordered the Schnitzel with mushroom sauce and a Platter of Sausages. The platter isn't on the menu, but we wanted to sample all the varieties so they put it together for us. It was a great presentation showcasing all their delicious offerings. We loved the sausages. The Schnitzel was a bit on the tough side, but flavor was good. We were much too full for dessert, but we won't miss the strudel next time."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I had dinner here this evening. I ordered the wiener schnitzel and he got the goulash. Our meal arrived within five minutes of ordering. My schnitzel tasted like it had been sitting in an oven waiting and his goulash was some of the toughest beef I have ever tasted. He told the waitress and she immediately took it away. We then heard arguing in the kitchen....the owner then came over and said that the meal was fine and said that it is not tough and he would eat my fiancés meal. The owner also said \"Let me explain to you how beef should taste..\". I lived in Austria and Germany and know what these meals should take like. This was not a good representation of German food. I've also had goulash cooked by a real Hungarian. The cook then came out and said \"oh...I found out that the owners wife bought the wrong cut of beef and it was very tough.\" That apology and the repeated ones from our very sweet waitress were the only ones we got. My fiancé ordered the schnitzel instead and his was fresh and hot. (I even heard them fry his meal. I did not hear them cook mine. It is a very small restaurant and we had a table closest to the kitchen) It was better but still not great. We finished our meal and I chugged my beer so we could leave as soon as possible.

     I thanked the waitress and we paid our bill and left quietly. I adore good schnitzel and Vegas has a lack of German food already. I will NEVER return to this restaurant ever again. Never."}
{"text":"We are so happy to have a German restaurant so close to home now. Our first visit was during their first week after opening. The waiter was very friendly and helped offer suggestions from the menu. They have German beer and wine selections available that both of us enjoyed. My wife ordered the schnitzel with mushroom sauce and I ordered the sauerbraten. Both were prepared quickly and we enjoyed every bite. This will definitely be a do-over for us so we can try more of the menu."}
{"text":"The best German restaurant in the valley period. I have now eaten here 4 times and it just gets better and better. 100% authentic German food. This is the real deal. The German family that owns and runs the place are some of the nicest folks you will every meet. The food is so good I can't get enough of it. The soup is home made and out of this world. I had the Vienna Style Schnitzel it's the best I've ever had in Vegas or anywhere else in the USA. For desert I had the apfel studel with ice cream. Everything here is made fresh and you will taste it. I will be going back many times over. Bringing some friends with me this week for lunch. They can't wait. Also looking forward to Oktoberfest end of September."}
{"text":"This place is really good I had the champignons schnitzel and the pretzel dumplings in mushroom sauce. They had a great selection of German beers and the price for the beer was very reasonable. The food is a little pricey but the portions are big, except for the pretzel dumplings they only give you 3 and no side dish so you're hungry after you finish, I wish they would add a few more dumplings to the dish considering the price. The staff is very friendly and everything seems authentic. They don't have a great vegetarian menu. Also they seem to be using frozen french fries but they're still good, you'd figure a mom and pop spot like this would have homemade style fries. All in all it's a must try."}
{"text":"Went for lunch (our 1st visit).  We were seated without menus, waited long for our drinks AND no one came to offer any assistance on explaining the menu items once we got the menus.  I kept waiting for someone to approach our table so we could ask questions.  Fortunately, a very nice German lady seated next to me scooted over to explain the entrees to me and my husband. Once we ordered, we waited a VERY long time.  Service is less than efficient.  I happened to see a past customer's photo of the item I ordered today (Schnitzel Vienna Style) and my order did not look anything like hers.  My cutlet was not thick but very thin, overcooked and bland. I received much less potatoes than shown in her photo.  The potatoes were bland as well.  I also ordered their potato pancakes.  Bland and 50% of the patties consisted of oil.  I like greasy foods so it didn't bother me.  I used an awful lot of salt to flavor my lunch today.  My husband liked his bratwurst lunch.  We will return only if a friend wants to try this establishment."}
{"text":"I spent six weeks in Germany, spending time roaming Bavaria, hitting Oktoberfest and eating the cuisine. I've had my share of the different styles from casual to expensive German food. With that said, this is a pretty good German restaurant in LV. I've been here a few times ordering the sauerbraten which was a good choice for me. The red cabbage and spätzle were great, really enjoyed it. The staff is friendly and the atmosphere is very Bavarian."}
{"text":"came here lunch time. prices are good. got schnitzel in creamy mushroom sauce. it was really tasty! great German restaurant with home style cooked meals."}
{"text":"Authentic, family run German restaurant just before Anthem. Very authentic in every way. Excellent traditional German food and hospitality from a very friendly and attentive staff."}
{"text":"Very disappointing.  The server, with multiple facial piercings and hair hanging in her face, was slow, stating she would be right back after getting our drinks, instead she chatted with another table for several minutes and finally made it back to our table to take our order.  The food arrived over cooked, mushy fried potatoes and cabbage and schnitzel which was also over cooked and tasteless,  My husband had the schnitzel with the mushroom gravy and spaetzle which he said was tasty. Over priced -we won't be going back."}
{"text":"Soooo MUCH FUN! The food was good and ABSOLUTLY 'd our server, Nicole~ she is charming, funny just a joy!!!
    The potato pancakes \"THE BEST\" a DEFINATE must have~ I ordered the weinersnitzel with the creamy mushroom gravy & mashed potatoes. It was OK~ my husband had bratwurst w/ warm German potato salad and raved how delicious it was. He also had a German beer that was FAB! I don't drink beer  BLEH ~ nor sausage double BLEH, BLEH! 
   Be sure to order the desert, apple  strudel....INFRICKINCREDIABLE!! REALLY!! Served warm with ice cream,  topped with whipped cream and dusted with cinnamon.
   This is a small family runned business, check it out I don't think you'll be disappointed.....ask for Nicole"}
{"text":"Food: We ordered the typical bavarian food which are schnitzels and sausages. The food was tasty, and the side dishes which are the potatoes and sauerkraut were seasoned just right. Although my gripe is that the amount of food served in relation to the price wasn't really good. Overall as far as taste is concerned it was good. My only reference with regards to taste is the other well known German Restaurant here in Las Vegas which is Hofbrauhaus and it definitely is better than hofbrauhaus

Ambiance: Homely Establishment, where your eating at a family friends house.

Overall: Would definitely come back and try other foods on their menu."}
{"text":"My wife and I had lunch at Bavarian Castle and it was awesome. The service was great and the food was amazing. We had the pretzel dumpling with creamy mushrooms and the bratwurst with sauerkraut and mashed potatoes. The sauerkraut is the best I have ever eaten, even better than the when I was in Munich. Don't miss this great restaurant."}
{"text":"Due to an apparent problem paying the lease, the landlord has posted the restaurant as locked out. Dunno if it will reopen. We were really hoping to try it."}
{"text":"Good food with good sized portions. Service was friendly. A little pricey, good for special occasions."}
{"text":"The cutest little German place on sunridge heights and eastern. Right down the street and we finally decided to come and we're so glad we did! Everything was great and my boyfriend has been dying for some Currywurst and the one here was identical to the ones I've had in Germany. The sweetest older man and young girl helped us and we recommend this place now to everyone. MUCH better in price than Hofbräuhaus and more intimate"}
{"text":"What a great find! Delicious food, authentic, and reminded me of time spent in Germany. Will be coming back very soon."}
{"text":"Love this place!! If you are in the mood for real German food this is place to go. So delicious. Felt like i was back in Munich and they have killer draft beers."}
{"text":"This  are for Iris, the Chef. She is not an owner. After speaking with her and hearing of her rather impressive resume, (she was a personal chef to a couple of magical Germans, yep those Magical Germans)

Her food is authentic, pure, you can taste the love she puts into every dish. As I deduced, the waiter is not a relative, just a guy who speaks German so they hired him. 

I asked if they prepared food for \"to go\" orders and she said most definitely. Lunch prices are a smidge less expensive. And you don't have to to deal with the \"ambiance\" or the slightly odd gift shop of dioramas that they sell. 

I have the feeling you should enjoy this establishment while you can, the last 4 places lastly about 6 months.

ps....did find out the lease agreement should be a red flag. Their AC went out 3 weeks after signing the lease, and the renters are responsible for ALL REPAIRS TO THE BUILDING. Ex: HVAC, plumbing, etc. explains a lot as to why great places like Bread & Butter just bailed instead of fighting \"The Man\". Where I come from, they're called Slum Lords. Oh Well."}
{"text":"I love this place.. I just love the beer brats.Yummy sauerkraut and mashed potatoes... I will definitely going back. Friendly workers.Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"This is a small spot in a strip mall. As a fan of (good) German food, I was excited to try this spot. Good German food has been next to impossible to find in Vegas. It was empty when we went around 6pm on a weekday evening. There was one staffer/server. She was incredibly nice and friendly. Absolutely excellent service. However, it seemed to be a bad cook night? Everything was good, but too overdone. Had the pretzel been warmer and not so tough, I would've liked it. Had the schnitzel not been overcooked, I probably would've loved it. The creamy mushroom sauce was good. The warm potato salad was good. Perhaps this is just a hit or miss place? I'd be willing to give it another try another day and see if the food is better. This spot has promise, but it failed to deliver. The decor was cute. The menu seemed pretty authentic."}
{"text":"Very good food! Finished off all of our plates. Service a little weird but good, will 100% come back again!"}
{"text":"A restaurant or a retreat? When you step into this restaurant you forget you are in the hectic city of Vegas.  

Food is exotic, authentic, and good. The food is made from scratch and delicious! The apple strudel is to die for! The staff here are very friendly and kind. 

Overall experience is very pleasant. I would come here again."}
{"text":"Was highly dissapointed. I went there about a month ago and I felt the prices were high and food was not good.  I got the sausage plate which was good but came with spaetzle that was dry, tasteless and seemed like it was fried not boiled. Maybe it was reheated in the frying pan. Either way not good.  We got the potato pancakes which were expensive and lacking in flavor. Just felt like they were just fried potatoes.  No onion, no seasoning, not flavorful. My mother got the sourbrauten which she said wasn't that good and the portion was tiny for the price. Also her red cabbage was more of a brown color. So, we had a coupon for buy one, get one entree. The owner tried taking off the potato pancakes instead of one of our meals, which of course was cheaper. I'm sorry but an order of potato pancakes are an appetizer, a side dish maybe but not an entree."}
{"text":"My friend and I visited this restaurant in September based on a good review in the local newspaper. She is from Switzerland and is familiar with what good German food should taste like. She ordered the Bockwurst for lunch and I had the Rahm Schnitzel. We both ate the salad that was also provided. We both came away with the same impression - sub par to say the least. I also ordered an Octoberfest Beer which turned out to be the best part of the meal. The Sausage was not firm like traditional Bockwurst and lacked flavor. The Schnitzel was also so so in flavor. The restaurant next door had a sign that read \"Best Thai Food in Henderson\". We should have gone there. The RJ reviewer must had had too much wine before the meal to give it such a good review!"}
{"text":"Great little German restaurant. 
Spaetzle was outstanding. 
This place is a little difficult to find,, but well worth it.  
Nice treatment by the waitperson.  
I had a König Ludwig Weissbier. 
Loved it"}
{"text":"Excellent German food.  Small and personal. Great service.  Everything we had was very reminiscent of trips to Germany and eating in small family owned village restaurants.   Definitely we will be back."}
{"text":"This was a hard one to rate. My 3 stars are based on the food to price ratio. The service was 5 stars.
I went here with a group of 12 other people and they closed the place just for our group since the place is on the smaller side and they were short handed that day. We were treated like VIPs. Always on top of filling our sodas, I must of got at least 4 refills, and letting us taste samples to see if we would like something. The table all ordered a mix of different dishes and I believe everyone enjoyed what they ordered. I had the beer bratwurst with mashed potatoes and sauerkraut. I am not a fan of kraut but this one had bacon in it so it wasn't that bad. Overall the price for my plate was $12.95 and I thought that was a little pricey for the portion on the plate. The brat was cooked good and was tasty, I just wish I had another one. I also had apple strudel for dessert and it was super good with whipped cream and vanilla ice cream."}
{"text":"Been here recently and the food has changed and prices have gone up. In the beginning their schnitzel used to be pan fried but now its deep fried and it was over cooked. The mushroom sauce is good but not as good as before. Not sure why the recipes are changing. I'm not too happy with the changes."}
{"text":"unfortunately, I haven't even had the pleasure of trying this restaurant. I went in and the woman not being so nice said they had no room. Ok, I said I'd try later. I have called this place on numerous occasions to make a reservation, and no one answers. I finally gave it up, for any restaurant isn't worth the time. Not only that, it sounds if the number to call is just a cell phone."}
{"text":"What comes to mind with the meal we had here is \"meh\".  It wasn't bad but it certainly wasn't great.  The location is way off strip and the decor is cute.  My wife is Austrian and she felt the schnitzel wasn't fried as it should have been.  It was not crispy as you might expect.  Her mom ordered the kinder frankfurter and she enjoyed it.  

The owner of the restaurant isn't very friendly but he appears to be the cook so he is probably busy.  We asked where the frankfurters were from and he wouldn't tell us.  Um..OK whatever buddy.  Vegas is lacking when it comes to German restaurants so this is a viable option.  We have tried Cafe Berlin and enjoyed it very much.  Hofbrau is great for ambiance but the prices are very high.  

This place is just ok. I wouldn't drive across town to come here."}
{"text":"This is the only German restaurant in Henderson, so I want them to do well. Good food and decent service."}
{"text":"Great service but very average German food.  All was on the bland side and Portion size was way too small for the price paid.   Pretzels were great."}
{"text":"So glad they opened in Henderson.  The dining room is fairly small so you may have to wait for a table.  My advice is to go off-peak time.  Our first trip there was on a Saturday about 6pm and the we were told the wait was about 30-45 minutes so we left and returned the next weekend about noon and got in right away.  The menu was typical german cuisine and very tasty.  My husband's sauerkraut was really delicious, dark and savory, rather than the really sour dish that many places serve.  We both had sausages and mine came with german potato salad.  We truly enjoyed it and will definitely return."}
{"text":"Just finished a fantastic meal here.  I feel like I'm in Germany!  The service was amazing.  Excellent recommendations from my server."}
{"text":"Overpriced small portions.  No bread either. Definitely not a place to go unless you want to overpay for mediocre food. A small pretzel for $3 and served with butter and packaged yelow mustard. A menu of items that are made with cheap ingredients."}
{"text":"A nice family-owned restaurant in the Anthem area of Henderson. 
The schnitzel was good, the beer was delicious :-)
Unfortunately, they were out of: sauerkraut and potato pancakes because they had a very busy day, with only one cook, and we arrived (like most of their customers that day I imagine) without a reservation.
The server who recently came here from Germany, was friendly and fun."}
{"text":"It's not hard to argue that options for German food in Vegas are pretty limited. Bavarian Castle, which is located on Eastern just off Sunridge Heights, has only been open for about 7 months now. In that short time, it seems as if they've made quite a name for themselves for locals in the area. We visited on a Saturday night around 6pm, walked in to a packed house and were informed that reservations are normally required for weekends. They told us it just gets too busy, and with only about a dozen or so tables total in the place, we were lucky to get squeezed in. Just after we walked in, they actually ended up just straight turning down two other couples. The weird thing is that by time we were done eating, which took maybe 30 minutes or so, basically the entire restaurant was empty. So, while reservations don't seem necessary in the normal way, I'd recommend it so you don't get told to turn around and leave.

The service we got during our dinner though, was amazing! This restaurant is family run from kitchen to table. Our waiter, who is the daughter, was extremely friendly and nearly served the whole restaurant herself without missing a beat. Her mom was in the kitchen cooking the entire time, and when it slowed down, came out to talk to us and thanked us for coming in. You really just get a great feeling from the place, and that on its own deserves 5 stars!

It's really too bad that the food just didn't quite get there, and for me definitely didn't meet all the praise it's gotten. We started off with a pretzel, which is one of my wife's favorite items. Her grandmother is from Germany and she always raves about the ones she ate when she traveled there with her. At $15 (yes, fifteen) for 1 giant pretzel, this was something I definitely can't recommend ordering. It seems as if they might make these at an earlier time, then freeze and reheat when needed. Besides the larger portion of it, the texture was about as close to rubber as you can get and pretty much inedible. For the parts we were able to eat, I did like the flavor and slight crispness of the outside. It's also served with 4 decent dipping sauces, including a nice spreadable French cheese.

For dinner, I ordered a Beer Bratwurst plate and she ordered the Schnitzel w/ Mushroom Sauce and a side of Spaetzle. I took a few bites of her schnitzel and it too was hard to eat. The mushroom sauce on its own was very good, but the whole dish was so beyond greasy that you couldn't even taste the meat. My brat was decent, but had very little flavor and was a bit on the dry side. The whole plate (served with mash potatoes and sauerkraut) was pretty small portioned for $13 too. I wasn't a fan of the mashed potatoes because they were greasy as well and again, had just about no flavor. The sauerkraut though, was very good! It looks like it's made in house. Has a nice crunch to it, it's not overly sour and is even a little bit sweet. It's really good enough to where you could eat it on by itself. I'm just disappointed that it was pretty much the highlight of our meal.

For those seeking German brews though, this place has quite a few to offer. Not only do they keep a good list of bottled beers, they even rotate a few on draft. I ordered a medium sized Warsteiner Pilsner, which was priced good at only $5.50 and tasted great. They don't serve it ice cold and you won't find any frozen glasses in this place! Just the way it should be.

Our bill with 1 appetizer, 2 dinners and 2 beers came out to a little over $70 with tip. For the price, I just didn't think it was worth it. Even with our limited German options, there's better out there and it won't cost you as much. I really do love and appreciate that feeling like you're just eating over at a friends house, but I think they fall too short on the execution. And maybe we didn't get the whole experience since it was just so busy, but it'll be a while before we give Bavarian Castle another shot."}
{"text":"Decided to try Lunch at the Bavarian Castle while I was in the Henderson area. The restaurant is a  cozy place among many stores in busy strip mall. Decorations and background music make you feel like you are in Europe. 
Service was prompt and friendly. I ordered the Bockwurst which comes with Potato salad and a choice of soup or salad. I chose the soup of the day which was Lentil. The cup of soup was a hearty style with pieces of potato and sausage. A good warm you up comfort food. The Bockwurst is served with a tasty mustard on the side. The Potato salad was a familiar German style with with bacon and served warm. A separate item ordered was the Potato Pancakes. These were nice and crispy on the outside but lacked flavor and needed seasoning.
If you are in Henderson and looking for some authentic German food give it a try. I do not think it's worth a drive across town for a meal."}
{"text":"My aunt and I just had a great lunch at Bavarian Castle. It feels like a mom and pop shop, the kind of place you want to succeed. After we ate the owner/cook came out and chatted a bit and we really felt like welcome guests that were fed from the heart. We tried the potato pancakes as an appetizer and they reminded me of my grandfathers. crispy and perfect.   I had the schnitzel with mushroom sauce and spazle on the side. It was perfect - rich and filling but not heavy. My aunt had the rouladin and I had a taste, super tender and flavorful. I'd have either again in a heart beat. We both had the Warsteiner pilsner which paired well and we were given a free sample of the desert, a brioche pumpkin bread pudding and it was as good as any and better than most. It was a very pleasant surprise and I'll be back."}
{"text":"Gave this place a try for a weekend lunch.
The good:
Service was friendly and attentive. Beer, vegetable soup, French fries were good.
The meh:
Potato salad was overcooked (closing in on mashed potatoes) and bland, mushroom schnitzel was ok, but sauce had way more herbs in it than I'm used to. Apfelstrudel was ok, but was killed by too much cinnamon on top.
The ugly:
The mega something pretzel for almost 16 bucks was inedible. It was like a frozen chunk of dough left in the microwave for too long - the thinner parts rock hard, the thicker parts chewy and gummy. Total fail ! The amount of German sweet mustard coming with it was insufficient, so we asked for some more, and were informed that there would be a 50 cent charge. We expected another little condiment cup, but what we got was the size of a thimble. Totally ridiculous. Fortunately, we didn't really need it, since we gave up on the pretzel 1/4 way through.
Summary:
The prices are on the high side, so the food should be up to par. In light of the crappy pretzel, I feel three stars is being generous."}
{"text":"Tasty food, fast service.  Most menu its are well worth there value in pricing in relation to proportion  sizes.  Exception is the Rouladen at $22.50, tasty but minimal food in relation  to the meat portions. You only get one meat roll. 

We had the mulled wine--excellent choice on this cold and blustery day."}
{"text":"So this review is from an OLD visit. I'd been meaning to write this and am just now getting around to it. Better late than never right?

So, I've been a diehard Germany soccer fan for a few years now. I was really excited this World Cup and had already watched 2 games at the Hofbrauhaus which cost me more than I'd like to talk about. Let's just say I have no qualms with drinking at 8am. SO on a whim I decided to check out if there were any other German joints that were: 1. Closer to me and 2. More affordable. Lo and behold this place popped up on my search a WEEK after they opened! Talk about fate!

I call them asking if they'll be showing the game that morning, to which I was told, \"If you're here for the game, our door will be open!\" So next morning I show up, decked out in my jersey and facepaint, and they let me in before operating hours to watch the game (Germany vs. France, we won of course) and serve me and my boyfriend beer. Talk about service! And getting to smell all the wonderful smells from the kitchen as they were preparing for the day made the day even better!

Not to mention the food is SO GOOD. German cuisine, in my opinion at least, is the ULTIMATE COMFORT FOOD. The potato salad (Kartoffelsalat) is a different variation of what I'm used to making or getting, but YUM! I wanted spaetzle, but the machine was broken that day, thankfully I was not disappointed with the salad at all. Topping off the whole experience is the expertly made from scratch Apfelstrudel. DO NOT HESITATE TO ORDER THIS! It is just like my Tante used to make, SEHR LECKER!

I'll definitely be back here not only to enjoy the wonderfully authentic food, but to support the lovely people who accommodated a wild soccer fan on the day of the World Cup Quarterfinals. I appreciated the hospitality more than you know! :]"}
{"text":"Terrible.  Will not return.  Went down hill from the time we entered.  The male who \"greeted\" is pointed to any table we wanted.  He put the menu's on the table and left.  Two other tables occupied. Waited for about 10 min before he returned.  Not very helpful with menu.  Meals were not very good.  Veal was over cooked and dry.  Spatzel was burnt!  The best thing about the meal was the beer."}
{"text":"This place really has some great German food. The prices are very reasonable. The wurst was fresh and homemade. I would recommend that everyone try this place if you like authentic German food."}
{"text":"We ate dinner at the Bavarian Castle last Saturday. It is a darling mom & pop restaurant. Our server Kristie was very attentive and knowledgeable. She gave us a little background on the owners and how they came to Vegas. I'm so glad they did! We enjoyed Vienna style schnitzel, Jäger schnitzel, (I could bathe in that mushroom cream sauce!) a variety of sausages and delicious spätzle, all cooked by the owner Uli. I grew up eating my Grandma's German food. This was a reminder of all those delicious meals. We will be back on our next Vegas trip. The Bavarian Castle was a perfect fit for our family."}
{"text":"Service: Not very friendly, definitly no customer service as you will receive in other restaurants.
I am german and I was looking forward to a nice german dinner with my family. Schnitzel is beyond the quality you would get from any fast food place in germany. Please do not compary this to real german food - it is not! Way overpriced for what you get. Final, I will never waste my money again to take my family to a place like that, no pride in german cooking. Definitly can NOT recommend at all."}
{"text":"We went last night and loved it. When we arrived there was only one table left. Fortunately we were seated. We should have made reservations. We were greater immediately and made to fill at home.
The food came out quickly even though they were down a cook. Nicole took great care of us. I had the rouladen and my wife had one of the schnitzels. All was great. I want to try the sausages next.
Just make sure you try the strudel. We will definitely be making a return visit."}
{"text":"Good food. A little expensive but delicious. Portions are sizes so that you can enjoy desert."}
{"text":"Fantastic snitzel and spatzle. Mushroom gravy is wonderful.  Nice little mom and pop, hole in the wall place."}
{"text":"first of all, we too were happy to hear a new german rest in hendo. But the atmosphere was like we were being eyeballed the whole time. got there bout 430 to avoid crowds and 3 tables had old ladies from anthem. beer was ok but warm and I heard a women complain about warm white wine also. yea I know its german but this aint Germany. salad dressing was tasteless. had pork cutlet with mushroom sause and spatzle. was ok but not tender and tasteless. Waitress was older lady, wife maybe? and was rather short with us when asking about the menu. plus $6 for literally a small cup of soup. maybe 6 oz. Just overall uncomfortable visit. didn't seem welcomed at all and im german/scott. Might go back one more time just because we want it to be avail to us."}
{"text":"Really love this little spot. I've seen a few German restaurants come & go in this town, so when I read about this one I was quite pleased. Both times I came for lunch, and both times were consistently as good (however that could be due to ordering the exact same meal lol.) Everything seemed authentic & freshly prepared. Friendly server was informative, friendly and efficient. 

Can't wait to come back for dinner. Time for some Romanian style goulash! There are 50% off coupons sometimes in local advertisements, so keep an eye out."}
{"text":"Just happened to pass by the place tonight and decided to give it a try.  My wife had the goulash and I had the pork with cream mushroom dish.  Both were extremely fresh and very good!   The dinner salad was OK, but I say that only because I don't like frilly salads like theirs (with dandelion, etc.). The service was excellent and the waiter was very friendly.  It feels like a family owned type of place, where a lot of love and hard work was put into it.  It's not easy to spot and it's made even more difficult to find because they have outdoor screens covering their storefront...can't tell they are open.  I would definitely recommend...  Very good!"}
{"text":"Friday Afternoon 3/3
Went for a good German meal on the 1/2 price coupon we had
Arrived 12:30-1PM
Dark, locked doors
Sign says CLOSED even though the hours are 11-9PM
Another couple of people arrived and were disappointed
Not good!"}
{"text":"My mother and I decided to try the Bavarian Castle last night.  First the not so good news.  No one seemed overly interested in seeing us, no one greeted us despite the fact that they were not busy at all.  We sat down at a table for two and our server arrived to take our drink orders.  She was very, very friendly, but not German, which I guess I sort of expected. She knew the menu well and also knew what beers were offered. The decor was nothing to write home about at all.  One thing that did turn us off was the location of the bussed dishes.  Two tables had been pushed together on a wall in the dining room and those two tables held the bussing pans with the dirty dishes, glasses, etc. inside of them.  We couldn't understand why they weren't being held in the back somewhere out of sight of customers.  While there, a number of people came in and that I could tell, no one greeted them either.  Now, for the GOOD news.  We both ordered the Schnitzel with creamy mushroom sauce.  I asked for fried potatoes, rather than fries, and my mother asked for spaetzle, rather than fries, and that accommodation was made for us with no problem whatsoever.  We also asked that our sauce be on the side rather than on top of the meat. Thought that it was very terrific that our substitutions were met with \"no problem\".  We also ordered a side of sauerkraut.  The salad that came with dinner was lovely, but unfortunately had no taste.  I was hoping that this was not the case for the rest of the dinner, and it wasn't. The moment I laid eyes on the schnitzel, I knew that I was in heaven.  It looked and smelled exactly how it should have...and that was wonderful.  The sauerkraut was the best that I have ever in my life eaten (I'm German and I have had my fair share of sauerkraut in my life).  It was so darn good, I wanted to marry the chef.  Chef turns out to be one of the owners.  She came out to say hello and to acknowledge our compliments of the food.  She was very, very nice and spent a bit of time chatting with us.   Before we left, everyone that worked here came by to say good bye to us and hoped that they would see us again soon.     Will I go back?   Absolutely, I have plans to dine there tomorrow night with my aunt and cousin. Will I recommend it?  Absolutely.  I'm making plans to have dinner there with some friends.  Recommend the food very highly."}
{"text":"Horrible food, don't waste your money. Ordered the meatball special & literally for $13 for 1 smaller then a softball, overcooked! We almost walked out. Should have,"}
{"text":"Very disappointed in pricing and serving size. Left actually hungry. Service was so poor as the waitress was so unprofessional she actually put meals at a different couples table and realized she had made a mistake and took them to the customers who ordered those meals. I would of demanded to have fresh food. Also, some people came in and looked at the menu and left and she started talking about them to the customers there in the dining room behind their backs- so very rude. I would not return as food wasn't even tasty and very small portions for a nearly $25 dinner with no soup or salad or even a roll."}
{"text":"This is the only German restaurant in town worth visiting! The staff here is friendly, the food is authentic and delicious, and the owners are extremely accommodating. I've been here many times, and I intend to continue to give them my business. I overhear many patrons commenting that the Haufbrau House has NOTHING on this place! I'm inclined to agree! 

Keep up the great work guys! I love the Bavarian Castle!"}
{"text":"Authentic. I lived in Germany for 4 years and I was pleasantly surprised that the food was just as good as I remembered when living overseas. Great little German restaurant and the Spaetzle was outstanding. Nice treatment by the waitperson and the beer was delicious -König Ludwig Weissbier."}
{"text":"We have been increasingly disappointed with our experiences here, in service, price, and quality of food.  The owners are very nice people and there is a family medical situation occurring now, which could explain the changes, but still...

The older blonde waitress does not have a pleasant way about her.  She is abrupt and hard of hearing.  She was downright difficult tonight, which left us feeling frustrated and angry.  

The prices are ridiculous...way too much for the quality and amount of food.  We paid $129 for three people tonight.  That included two entrees, four sides, two glasses of wine, and two desserts.  

Portions are too small and my husband and friend said much of the food was not seasoned.  Twice now, my husband has been ill (vomiting, nauseous) after eating here.  That's not right. 

We have been told they won't sell a kid's meal to an adult (even when we wanted it as an appetizer).  They won't do chicken schnitzel. If you go in with a coupon, they'll take the price of an appetizer off when it's supposed to be an entree (and when are potato pancakes an entree?)  What else, what else could they be inflexible on?  Who is the customer here, Bavarian Castle?  

We really wanted to patronize this place, but after getting stuck with high bills, illness, and inflexibility, I guess we will just start cooking at home...the German food in this town leaves a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"Love this place!  The Bavarian and the beer bratwurst was really good as was the schnitzel.  I would also highly recommend anything with the mushroom sauce it's to die for!  And I am very picky.  Sauerkraut is off the hook!"}
{"text":"We have been here several times and like to take out of town visitors there for a meal. We really enjoy the comfortable atmosphere, friendly staff and great food. My favorite is the Roulade and red cabbage. My husband always enjoys the Schnitzel. My two sons, who can be quite picky, always find something to enjoy and have tried many items on the menu. They are a bit pricey, but it is a unique meal and freshly prepared so we don't mind.
We have noticed that there is not as big of a crowd as when they first opened, which is usually expected. We hope they can keep regulars coming, so that they stay going. With so many options in Henderson, it seems like the good ones disappear. Love you Bavarian Castle!!"}
{"text":"Went with hubby try it out. He used to work in a German restaurant, so he was a little more critical about the food. He kept telling me how things \"should\" have been done.  We both thought it was overpriced, under portioned. We were the only ones in the restaurant  (other than staff) the night we went, which should have been a warning to us. Everything was meh.
We did enjoy the apple strudel with vanilla ice cream, but hated to hear the microwave door slam shut before the strudel arrived at our table.
I wonder how long they will be in business...so sad cause we love local mom/pop restaurants."}
{"text":"Das Restaurant ist sehr gut . Ich gebe es eine solide 4 Sterne.  Yes, 4 stars for sure.

Ambiance - Very small, nice and pleasant.  Good soft lighting and very home style. This is a casual place for friends to go and enjoy.

Service - very, very good.  Nice, quick and knowledgeable.  This was an added plus and considering there was one waitress for about 8 parties while we were there, that was to me very good.

The Beer - Had the Konig Ludwig Weissbier on Draft.  Enjoyed that thoroughly. Not too much carbonation and a very deep taste while light at the same time.  Draft beers are so drinkable!

The food -  

Mega Pretzel Dip Plate - So, they don't have the mega pretzel any longer because it doesn't stay nice and soft very long.... But they did give us three pretzels and they were good with dipping mustards and tons of salt...

Goulash and Spaetzle - This pot roast was very tender and melt in your mouth. The waitress recommended we try this on top of the spaetzle dumplings and that made it tasty.

Giant Sausage Plate - this had a curry sausage, Beer Bratwurst, Bavarian Bratwurst and the Bockwurst.  I ordered mine with two sides and had the spaetzle and the french fries.  Those fries were amazing and while I am not a huge spaetzle fan, come on, you gotta try it.  This was a rather large plate and I ordered it to try the different sausages and to bring the rest home. Three different mustards are served. Huge portion too.

Schnitzel with Creamy Mushroom - My son had this and it was very good. The veal was tasty and when you add the creamy mushroom sauce on it, what a great combo.  Good size portion.

The Apple Steudel - Flakey, moist and melts in your mouth. Not very tart and not too sweet. Comes with ice cream and whipped cream. This is a great rendition of an apple streudel.

Bread Pudding with Toffee - Yeah, a chocolate bread pudding with Toffee.  This was darn good.

GK says get your lederhosen on and come on down and try this place. Just remember, German food is more comfort food and down home basics.

If they had daily specials and some real German liver and other organ type dishes, I would have enjoyed that very much."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and i gotta say i will definitely be back! The restaurant had a nice decor, laid back atmosphere, the waitress was kind and the food was delish! I had the schnitzel with creamy mushroom, fried potatoes and a nice cold Paulaner Hefeweizen. Overall i recommend giving this place a checkout!"}
{"text":"What a hidden gem. You can tell every dish is homemade. The food service and everything about this place is worth 6 plus stars. I highly recommend and will be coming back!!"}
{"text":"Oh. My. Goodness. I am in love with this place, the food, and best of all, the staff. My husband and I went for lunch and were pleasantly surprised by this quaint little spot. The waitress, with her beautiful German accent immediately seated us as soon as we walked in. It's so cute inside, very much how you would think a little diner in Germany would look. 
We both ordered delicious beers, mine was mixed with sparkling lemonade, which made me happy. 
Lunch specials started around $6-10 dollars, and that included soup or salad. 
I had pretzel dumplings soaked in mushroom gravy...so savory and mouth watering. I wanted to lick the plate clean. The hubs had brats and sauerkraut with the most delicious bread, obviously homemade with love. 
Then the dessert. Apple Streusel, so many layers, so much apple cinnamony deliciousness. Heavenly. I didn't want to share, not at all. 
All in all it was fantastic. I have never enjoyed German cuisine as much as I did today. I will return here as much as possible, I am already planning what I will be trying for future meals. 
Dankeschöen for the food!!!!"}
{"text":"Great local place!  Good food, service and atmosphere!!  Have been there three times and have never been disappointed.  Owners are so friendly like eating a family dinner:)"}
{"text":"We came for dinner and ordered 2beers and 2 main dishes.They are good enough, but overpriced.It was almost $70. Decoration of restaurant looks cheaply done with uncomfortable chairs and clatters.Portion of foods are small and pricy for quality.Service was not good even it was not busy that night.We are not going back."}
{"text":"Let's start off with the portions. I ordered the schnitzel, plain. For $19.00 I would expect the whole entire thing to cover my plate. But no. It was about a 6 inch long by maybe 2.5 inch size. I thought there was more schnitzel hiding under my fries, but I was highly wrong. Such a tiny portion. Pretty much the same size as the kids meal, and that only cost $7.95.  The pork was pounded so thin and cooked for so long you couldn't even cut it, it was so tough. This was even smaller than the lunch portion at Cafe Berlin. Whose spot on with their food. Anywho, The taste was something I've never tasted before, and did not taste like authentic German schnitzel. I also ordered the curry wurst. Terrible. I'm use to getting a bratwurst with my curry wurst but god forbid you tell that to the waiter, she just kept snapping back at you saying that was the German way and since I tried it I have to pay for it. That made their customer service terrible. Why wouldn't you want to help someone so that they come back? Well I will not be coming back. Good luck staying in business with that attitude. Looks like your trying to hold on to every single dollar, so y'all already struggling."}
{"text":"Great German food here. Nice selection of beers. The waiter was very informative and answered all of our questions. We tried the Vienna Style Schnitzel and the Pretzel Dumplings with Mushroom Sauce. Both were delicious! We especially enjoyed the fried potatoes with the schnitzel. The apple strudel was great for dessert. One suggestion is to have suggested beer pairings with the entrees."}
{"text":"I don't know much about German food but I was very excited to try it. I had the pretzel dumplings in mushroom sauce and I also ordered a beer brat. I can't explain how pleasantly surprised I was. It was delicious!! Here's the more impressive part. As great as my meal was the service was even better. I can not wait to take my friends to this wonderful little gem."}
{"text":"We did enjoy the food,Everthing was good except....I felt the mushroom sauce was way to spiced up with to many herbs....Maybe be a little lighter on herbs...Staff very nice,this should be a real hit!"}
{"text":"We were hopeful about finding a close German restaurant in Henderson' we will try again here...
We went on a Sunday afternoon; apparently a slow time. We were glad to see a lunch menu.
I ordered the schnitzel w/ mushroom gravy; JB ordered the Vienna Schnitzel. 
We opted for salad - it was a very good interpretation of a German salad, especially the dressing.
My Order: Looked great; it came w/Pommes Frites. The fries were very good, but not particularly what I consider a German side. The Schnitzel was tasty, a few tough areas requiring lots of pressure to cut. The gravy was LOADED with mushrooms (YUM), but also pieces of bay leaves - not expected.
JB's Order: Unfortunately, she experienced a tough cut as I did. The potatoes were a bit dry, but tasty. 
Having just been on a river cruise in Germany last year, we were a bit disappointed; but will try again. We don't like the noise at the Hofbrauhaus. Cafe Berlin is a bit far and hours are not attractive for us to go for lunch."}
{"text":"Upon first walking into the place we were greeted by the guy they refer to as Shultz I believe.  He asked if we had a reservation ,then asked the group that walked in behind us if they had one.  Neither of us did and told us it would be about a 30 minute wait.  There were 3 empty tables and only one had  a reserved sign on it.  After a few minutes of figuring things out, the waitress (Nicole?), came over and seated us right away.  Then the man guy came to each table dropping off menus and told both our table and the one next to us that everyone showed up at once and it would be a wait to get our food.  After a few minutes looking at the menus we placed our orders, which arrived rather promptly.  If I was a business owner, I would not want someone with such a downer attitude greeting the customers, it seems like he didn't want more people there.

Onto the food.  One person in our group ordered the Vienna Style Schnitzel, which was good, it does say it comes with a salad though, and all that it came with was one sliced tomato on the plate.  I tried the Rouladen, which was good, but for $22.50 it was a little small.  The warm potato salad was warm on the outside and cool in the middle, be nicer to have a consistent temperature.   Based on all recommendations and every other table getting the Apple Strudel for dessert, that's what we got.  It was great and I can see why everyone orders/recommends it.

I would go back again, but like some others have said, making a reservation is a good idea."}
