{"text":"When this guy makes pizza, he really means it! It's the only place on the square to get amazing food and really reasonable prices. Although their regular pizzas are great, I recommend getting a specialty. I've tried most of them, and right now I'm stuck on the roasted red pepper primavera which has a roasted red pepper sauce; before that it was the honey mustard chicken. 

You gotta try the wings. The wings here are not any ordinary wings, they are marinated and baked, locking in the juicy delicious flavor (ask the owner,  he loves explaining it to you!) and its only 4.50 for six and 8.45 for twelve.

Even though I'm surrounded by pizza restaurants I always choose Captain Tony's in Shaker!"}
{"text":"This might honestly be the worst pizza I have ever eaten!  I threw out the pizza after one slice each.  One for me and one slice for my wife.  Didn't feel like driving back to Captain Tony's to complain.... 

The young girl I spoke with over the phone needs to do a better job at explaining the different style pizzas! I ordered the stuffed pizza and it looked nothing like she explained to me.  I will never even try the other style pizzas they offer because I was so disappointed with the one I ate:(

I don't understand how anyone could like the stuffed pizza from this place.  They also give you sauce on the side to put on top of the pizza because they don't put sauce in this style of pizza I ordered. 

Also, the entire staff at Captain Tony's in Solon are Asian.....just seemed weird to me for a pizza place."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE Captain Tony's pizza!!!

The owner is always very nice, the food is amazing. I only get one thing there anymore -- it's not on the menu but if you ask for it they'll make it. Ranch pizza. Yup, ranch sauce switched out for red sauce. They usually add chicken and bacon, but I get mine with onions and spinach instead. Sounds horrible, but it is the best. Thank you, Tony's!"}
{"text":"The pizza was awesome!  The service was timely and the owner of this particular spot is really cool.  He made me some very hot, hot wings!  He's always been friendly and has a great memory.  This is a spot that we frequent over and over again!"}
{"text":"Honest review. The pizza was fresh it was hot but it's just gross. Like it doesn't Taste good. There style their ingredients the cheese is not good and then $20 for a large pizza. Come on. And they don't known how to cook it way to much cheese that ends up globbed up on the side of the pizza. Little caesars which is absolutely awful has better tasting pizza"}
{"text":"We tried it slightly after they opened. Just not very good. Sauce was meh, crust wasn't much better. Might try again after they have been open for a little while."}
{"text":"While placing an order the employee that answered let out an audible sigh when I asked my family members how many wings they wanted... 
SMH awesome customer service, good way to lose out on a customer. Pizza BOGO it is!"}
{"text":"As the pizza place around the corner from me, I go here often, and can say wholeheartedly that if you want basic, cheesy, American pizza, you cannot go wrong. They are timely, friendly, and serve up good pie. They even have no problem accommodating weird requests: having a vegan day and want no cheese--just on half?--no problem! Craving veggies and want a side of broccoli that is, of course, not on the menu as such? You got it! Live a block away and decide to walk over with your dog? She can have a treat, too. Pepperoni for the pup, coming right up! This is a good place, all around. Their jalape√±o poppers are the shit, too."}
{"text":"I really like Captain Tony's because the owners are great, it's an amazing neighborhood hangout in Shaker Square, and their deep dish pizza is delicious.

My first order of a deep dish pizza was amazing because the meat was at least 2\" thick, no joke. Now, some of my favorite pizzas are on the secret menu, including kimchi pizza. :)

I think it's some of the best pizza I've had in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"I'm more than happy to keep adding my review of this establishment and it's owner, since he tries to take it down so often. 

The owner is a volatile, aggressive, violent man who yells, screams, and gets up in people's face and physically threatens them.
He has apparently done this to multiple people, as he recently confused me for someone else that he's harassed before.

Do not go here, folks. Bad food, bad management, and a mentally disturbed owner. He even left me a wonderful post on my FB in response to my review, which I will post below as a reply, rather than behaving in a professional manner to resolve the issue."}
{"text":"My favorite beef pepperoni pizza in Cleveland! Always hot and fresh and fast delivery. I've literally never been dissatisfied with my food!"}
{"text":"Worst pizza I ever had.  Cold, no sauce, cardboard-like crust, toppings were raw.  They must  pre-cook the pizza then throw the toppings on after you order.  How else could it be ready in 15 mins?  That should have been my first clue.  Can I give less than 1 star.  Totally agree with Carmen g.  Wish I would have read his review first."}
{"text":"Captain Tony's is solid. 9/10 times I get the same thing. Chicken Parmesan sandwich and a mini side salad. This comes out to $7.50. Sure the \"salad\" is about all iceburg lettuce and two small slices of tomato, a few strands of onions  and some bland cheese grattings, but the lettuce keeps you regular, that's the point.

Anyways, I always have my chicken parm craving satisfied, and for $5.50 out the door, the price is a steal, so the value is great. I'm also a fan of the bbq chicken sandwhich, it's got a few onions, has a delicious bbq sauce, and is appropriately messy.

The bread they make their sandwiches on is also better than poor quality and is pleasantly soft. This way you don't have to worry about destroying the back of your gums when you take a monster bite, and you will want to when the smell hits your olfactory sensors.

The pizza is good too. I had a small with artichoke hearts and something else for like $10, but it was enough food for two days. There's enough sauce to make the sauce to cheese to dough proportions well within the reasonable ratios.

I also like that I can call ahead, make my order, and it's usually ready in 15-20 minutes. They asian couple has a tendency to underestimate on the phone, but so does everyone.

They even gave me a free coke on christmas eve lunch.

The min on a credit card is like $8.00

You should check this place out, you get a good return for the dollars you spend.

10/27/2011 edit: My new favorite are the wings. I can't get enough of the terriyaki flavored wings for 8.70ish. They are not fried, and half are surprisingly large, half are meh size, but I can honestly say that not a week goes by I don't order them."}
{"text":"Worst slop I have ever eaten.  I have never had pizza this bad. Even the cheese tasted stale."}
{"text":"Ordered a vegetarian medium sized pizza around 930 pm. The service was quick but the pizza was not worth the 13.50 dollars. it was average at best."}
{"text":"Pizza--pretty darn close to pizza in Italy!!  (Thin crust)  It is really tasty, tender, and quality ingredients.  
Cons:  Got my order wrong- pan crust instead of thin)
and could use some more sauce all around.  
=)  OH and I drove an HOUR to get it--so its pretty good!"}
{"text":"I've been eating year for years and the owner is always so sweet and even after my living the state for years then coming back he still remembers. Awesome experience and flipping yummy pizza!"}
{"text":"I've been getting take out or delivery from Captain Tony's for close to 5 years. Its one of the closest lunch spots to my office in Shaker Square. The food is pretty typical fast Italian food and subs. Its solid and reliable, but nothing to write home about. Their customer service, however, is a disappointment. 

Because I've been ordering food from there for so long, you'd think they'd give a crap when I didn't receive an item that I order over and over twice within one week. I called to complain that an item was missing from from my multi-item order, and they actually denied that I ordered it and were rude to me. I had another worker in my office hear me place the order, so I actually have proof that it was initially ordered.

Hope you don't mind losing me and my office's $1500+ a year worth of business, Captain Tony's! 

Pizza Bogo, Marottas, and Dewey's are nearby if you want kinder and better tasting pizza, and if you want subs in this area, go to Dave's Cosmic on Coventry, Subway in Shaker Square, or get a sandwich from Dewey's Coffee also in Shaker Square. Don't deal with people who don't value your loyal business."}
{"text":"Great pizza, went in to try something new. When I walked in two police officers were sitting in the cozy seating area enjoying a pie. To me this said, \"yeah this is good food\" lol. Anyhoo, got a great pizza in under twenty minutes,
 almost as though I made at home myself. Prices a little steep but its worth it. Try 'em out!"}
{"text":"I remember back in the day, this place had the best pizza! There were comfy booths in the window to chill and eat your pizza in and the atmosphere had that great Shaker Square feel. Since Zesty's on Buckeye closed (had the best, greasy, cheesy, yummi pizza of ALL time...PLEASE COME BACK), I came home to CLE+ to get a pizza and all I could think of was devouring a Captain T pizza. Walked in and my mouth dropped open and nose immediately turned up! The place looks like S#@!; it was dirty, there were a handful of gross tables stashed in a corner that looked liked they were salvaged from someone's garbage and the \"new\" management (not sure how long they have owned it) was NOT what I expected! The lady lazily asked what I wanted and I think the look on my face said it all, NOT A DAMN THING. I just turned around and left out. Has so gone down the drain!"}
{"text":"Have had pizza twice now from the Solon Captain Tony's after becoming a fan of the location in Shaker Heights. The pizza has been good.  I'd say it's the best among a field of pretty poor options in Solon (pizza hut, dominos, gionino's, etc.)"}
{"text":"Hot sticks (are not sticks) but still good. Deep dish isn't really a true deep dish pizza but good none the less. Owner was funny and friendly. Staff is friendly as well. I give 4 out of 5 because the menu is miss leading but the food is still good."}
{"text":"Super amazing joint great service best people the couple who runs this place is sooooo sweet
We got the honey mustard chicken wings, steak and cheese sub, BBQ chicken sub and chicken parm sub, everything was super delicious and definitely recommend!!!"}
{"text":"seriously, what are so many people ragging  on this place. The girl that takes the orders as well as delivers is amazingly nice and the pizza is good and always consistent. Leave these guys alone. seriously."}
{"text":"The pizza was delicious! Loved the crust & sweet sauce. We also got the BBQ wings which were really really good, especially since we're from Buffalo & we are tough wing critics!"}
