{"text":"Terrible experience, ordered through ubereats, normally no issues when i use this service, half of my meal was forgotten, waited 2 hour from original order time, food never arrived, spoke with 3 people, kitchen manager was dealing with order, wait staff also, everyone was extremely rude, unapologetic and would not remedy the situation. AVOID and spend your money elsewhere, many great local business, do not waste your time, money, energy here. Really terrible management skills, food could have been good but there was no attention to detail, the food that did arrive was either over cooked or cold, wing flavour was not great. Would give 0 stars if I could."}
{"text":"I come for the burgers and the burgers only! By far the widest selection, patties are always seasoned to perfection and the toppings are plentiful... avocado, mango, prosciutto. Amazing. I can't really comment on fries/sides because again, I come for the BURGERS but usual pub fair!"}
{"text":"Repeat, repeat, repeat. The Yellow Griffin's range of options is truly awesome.  Everyone in your party can go in and get a burger while enjoying a totally unique meal.  First you choose your burger, they have a full range of meat options but I of course go with the veggie.  The veggie burger here is simply Yves garden burger, although it seems to be twice the size and thickness than the grocery store variety and is hence more satisfying.  (Normally Yves would not be my first choice but I think it works here, though to be honest I like almost all veggie burgers with a few notable exceptions, ahem, Dangerous Dan's.)  So onto the toppings, the thirty-five combo list excites me greatly.  My first time out I had the New Mexican, which was a creamy blend of guac, peanut butter that was tempered with sweet potato and spiked with cilantro (love!) --sounds weird but was completely wonderful.    I was tempted to get the New Mex again on my second visit but knew I had to give some other burgers some play.  Next up was the Bollywood, another interesting combo that I figured was unlikely for me to experience elsewhere.  My burger got a tandoori rub down and was sauced with a tangy green onion mayo/yogurt.  It was zesty and delicious but less so than my third choice of the ploughman, basic yes, but there's a reason for classics.  If the burger choices didn't overwhelm you, you still have to decide on your side.  My usual standard is regular ol' french fries that I can pair with ketchup and mustard --yes, I like to dip my fries into a blend of the two, especially if that mustard is dijon -try it!      Note: I haven't had a real problem with the service here and have visited on slow and on hectic days.  It can be a little erratic and a slightly longer wait than average but is certainly not extreme nor anywhere near the worst service I have experienced in our lovely city."}
{"text":"We sat on the patio here on a lovely Wednesday evening.  Although the table was a wee bit small we had a lovely time.  I had a hickory bison burger and my boyfriend had a caramel creme on beef.  The burgers were tasty.  Our only complaints were about the quantity of the sides.  Four onion rings for him and a handful of sweet potato fries for me is a bit ridiculous.   Otherwise, yum!"}
{"text":"Make sure to catch \"Johnny Devil and the Screaming Demons\" live every Tuesday night at around 10pm. Probably the only regular live musical act  in Bloor West Village as far as I know. They're a really perfect bar band to listen to over a pitcher. They have a really good selection of beers on tap, but it's all very pricey. The burgers are great, and it's not a bad deal considering the quality and uniqueness of the burgers, plus the fact that you get a tasty side. The waitstaff are nice, but not as friendly as I prefer. I'll be looking forward to the next time I pop in to hear Johnny and the demons again!"}
{"text":"The amount of options on their menu is overwhelming but I'm afraid I have nothing positive to say about this place beyond that. Can't really call this a decent burger place if they don't even know how to properly cook a veggie burger patty. I've had the Bahama Mama variant and it was disgusting."}
{"text":"Everything that Ramanan said in his review of the Griffin is true. The unparalleled burger selection alone is worth the trip. Ever had peanut butter or caviar on a burger? Well, they do that too. When you multiply the options for burgers, toppings, and sides, there are literally hundreds of different meals to be had here.  I've been coming here ever since they opened, and the Griffin has always been one of my Bloor West faves. Even when they had their hiccoughs (whoever thought of putting two-foot stools on the second floor when it first opened must have been watching too many Lord of the Rings movies), I've been sympathetic. Besides, some things have improved: they used to overcook the burgers (so that they were a little dry to my liking), but they seem to have gotten the hang of it more recently. I've gotten some great service here over the years, but with the turnover in wait staff, your mileage may vary.  PS: Smithwick's fans beware! That beer used to be on tap, but due to popular apathy, they discontinued it. A Smithwick's-loving friend of mine will no longer go to the Griffin for that slight alone. The lesson? Order the good stuff, or it may not be around forever."}
{"text":"It really is amazing how many burger shops have opened up in Toronto. So many in fact it would seems like hamburgers are \"Canadian food\". NOTHING touches the Yellow Griffin! You can choose  various amazing, creative toppings for your cow, lamb, bison, fowl, or veggie patty. I always get the mango avocado cheddar hamburger which mysteriously isn't ham at all! The burgers are for real the best in the city. The pub is small, dark and woody. I like that.  The only down-side it that it is QUTIE small there seems to be limited seating - I know there is an upstairs but I am not 100% what lurks up the steps! I hoisted myself up one day to find a private function or a dart tourny er something going on. Patio is also tiny. BUUUTTTT, even if there be a line up....tis worth the wait for the burgers of ecstasy!"}
{"text":"Terrible. Not worth the 1.5 hour wait for a burger. The owner is a total flake, and ignores you since she's running the place on her own. Here's an idea, hire another g*d d**n waitress so you'll give refills and take orders properly. I went to this place 3 times, and all 3 times I was waiting 30 minutes for drinks, and another 50 minutes for my food. I don't care how  good the burgers are here, they're over-priced, take forever to prepare, and the staff are generally rude and dismissive. Avoid."}
{"text":"Hate to be the Spokesperson for the Bloody Obvious, but this place sure has a lot of burger options. With 35 types of burgers to choose from (not to mention with your choice of what meat/non-meat patty to put on there), it might make your brain 'splode.   Though I treated myself to a tasty burger (Under the Tuscan Bun w/ chicken: A fresco of balsamic reduction with grilled red peppers, finely painted with cheddar and mozzarella cheeses), this place might fall victim to relying on its gimmick rather than providing a solid eating experience.  The food was good, but if you've read any of my other restaurant reviews, you know I can get rather passionate (borderline orgasmic) when talking about REALLY good food. All I can say is: the food was good.   Then there was the service. On a Monday night, it was not busy in the small establishment with two servers but once we sat down, it took a very long time to just get a copy of the menu. With the numerous options this place boasted, it would've been nice to give your customers as much time as possible with the menu. Slow and inattentive service makes me grumpy when I'm already hungry. Now here's the thing, everytime I was ready to huff 'n' puff about being neglected, the waitress would show up and even told jokes and was generally very pleasant... then I felt bad.  This may seem like a lukewarm review (and it is), but I think I would likely be back since there are still technically 244 types of burgers left to try (not including the salmon burgers).   Don't worry, heart. I have no intention of trying them all."}
{"text":"Having hit the Griffin once or twice a decade ago, I was excited to move to the neighbourhood to have frequent chances to work my way through the burgers list. Can't say enough about the food at the Yellow Griffin - I don't eat beef but have plenty of choice for patties otherwise, and all of the toppings combos make for delicious dinners! Plus my fav sweet potato fries and Tennent's on tap never hurts.   My fella, a newbie to this place, wondered what upstairs looked like - I didn't even know there was space up there! Beyond a great pub feel up a flight of stairs, the space has a pool table and darts, rarities in the neighbourhood. Margaret, the bartender/waitress upstairs, is incredible - she is so friendly and has remembered our names and beer of choice since our second visit! We held the fella's 40th birthday there last Dec and again, can't say enough - the munchies we ordered were tasty and Margaret juggled food and drink orders with ease for 40-50 people, impressing long-time hospitality types. A friend was looking for an impromptu venue that could host her karaoke birthday party and the Yellow Griffin fit the bill with their drop-down screen and decent sound system. Can't say enough about this place, thumbs way, way up!"}
{"text":"MAPLE SPICE BURGER  amazing a must try .  Maple poached golden pear, caramelized onion, Italian prosciutto, smothered in brie. How amazing does that sound.  Serve made them lose a star. Waitress was slow and didn't seem to care."}
{"text":"First off, super delicious burgers, but you'll wait for it.  You'll wait for drinks too, and you bill.   Everything is good but the biggest thing keeping me away is the very slow service. I can't seem to get more then 2 drinks anytime I go. My pint glass will sit empty forever!   It's a combination of lack of staff and the staff being frustrated by it, that translated into the long wait."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night, and the main floor was jammed with people. So we decided to go sit upstairs. Some of the tables upstairs felt like it's for little children. You have tiny stools surrounding what looked like coffee tables. Not ideal to have a meal. Fortunately they have 'normal' bar tables with bar stools. Which we decided to sit at.   On to the food, the wings we ordered were surprisingly really good. I would recommend to order those. My friend and I split 3 burgers. We had the Calypso, Gringo and the English Breakfast burger. I thought the burgers were ok, the patties could use a bit more seasoning, and were dry. Of the three I would pick the Gringo and English breakfast. The Calypso, we were told was one of the popular ones. Avocado, mango and cheddar cheese, that taste combination didn't float my boat. As many yelpers have already noted, the wait for your food is ridiculously long, we waited close to an hour for our burgers to show up. On the fence about coming back here."}
{"text":"A nice family run restaurant. They have a huge selection of tasty burgers, but the service is very slow."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner around 7pm on a Thursday.  Service, this area definitely needs work.  The restaurant is very large, holds maybe 30 people but there was only one server.  This caused huge problems for if you wanted any service at all.  I don't fault the server since she was the only one there but it was confusing since it was clear that they needed at least 2 more servers to provide decent service to all the people at the restaurant (the place was full).  Decor/atmosphere, nothing special here.  There is a small bar (looks like it sits about 5 people and a small patio outside that I think had maybe 3 tables).  Looks like it will fit maybe 30 people in total both inside and out.  There are two TVs that happened to have two different games on for anyone interested.  The washrooms are tiny and only available for one person at a time (one male, one female).  There is mention of a party room which I think is upstairs but I never saw.  Food, you do get a choice of having any type of patty with your burger which is nice (beef, veggie, lamb, and a few others).  The pre-set burgers all come with sides and it was nice that they don't charge extra for sweet potato fries like other places.  Food was okay, nothing special.  It did take awhile to come, but the menu does state that it may take up to 20 minutes.  Cost, burger + side is roughly $15.  The burger is a good size, so at the price, it is inline with my expectations.  I don't think I'll stop by again due to the poor service."}
{"text":"Went to the Yellow Griffin for lunch on Sunday. We were one of the first customers there that day and it wasn't busy, so our server was very attentive.  I ordered the beef hickory stick (hickory smoked bbq sauce, caramelized onions, and melted mozzarella and cheddar) with onion rings for the side. I'm usually very picky when it comes to burgers, because I can make pretty good burgers at home, but this one was really good. The beef patty was pretty big and taste really good. The onion rings are really big too, they have good batter for it as well; they're kind of like A&W's onion ring's batter, except better.  My friend ordered the Big Jerk (Jerk seasoning, fried plantain, sour cream, and a couple of roasted Jalapeno peppers) with salad for the side. He said he enjoyed it and it wasn't too spicy (although they looked spicy to me and he really likes spicy food). The salad looks standard...  My other friend ordered the Ploughman's burger (sliced pickles, melted white cheddar, tomato, balsamic onions). She ordered the sweet potato fries for the side. I tried the sweet potato and it was good. The burger looked messy to eat.  We didn't ordered any alcoholic bevies, because we were all still pretty much hungover from the night before.  For the price that you're paying, the quality of food and service are really good. I would totally recommend this place. Would love to come back at night when the pub is more alive."}
{"text":"I am not the biggest of all burger fan.   I usually find most burgers joints to be fairly moderate in my overall food desire.  However, my girl is all about burgers.  I will definitely be taking her to the Yellow Grif for a tasty patties .    I tried the \"Hold the Port\" burger.  6oz beef pattie, blue cheese, decent sized slice of portobello mushroom and a leaf of lettuce.  It had no sauces on it.  I am used to using sauces to add flavor to my burgers which I find usually bland and dry.  This burger was perfect with the pre-determined toppings.  The patty was extremely lean.  I did not chew any gristle or extra fat.  There didn't seem to be any filler in the burger either.  Just ground up lean beef!!    Can't wait to go back to my favorite burger pub!"}
{"text":"Yellow Griffin is one of those places that you go because nothing else is opened and you're craving a burger that's not from a fast food joint. Food is ok, nothing to rave about, and service is very slow. Overall I don't think i'll be back, especially since the Bloor West Village now has tons of other options."}
{"text":"Came here for a private party (note to Party Organizers! they have a largish top floor that can be booked, with a bartender and all) Not the hugest fan of pub food by any means. But I was hungry, and everyone around me was drooling over all of these burger options.   For Beverages; decent beer selection, 30+ variety of burgers (all can be made veggie with the awful-and-ubiquitous-garden-patties) and for side.. among other things, deep fried pickles.   I enviously admired deep friend pickles, although my fries were alright. My burger was Magna Jakarta $11.95 \"Satay spread, roasted red peppers with garlic and topped with cheddar...\" Which was by FAR the best awful-ubiquitous-garden-patty-burger I have ever had.    Not really worth the drive to the other side of my universe, but A-Ok if you find yourself far west."}
{"text":"this place is over hyped. burgers are not bad but as great as some people claim."}
{"text":"Known for their adventurous burger driven menu. Three dozen burger combinations from turkey to salmon.  Their burgers are pretty good. Unfortunately, I would have to agree with many of the other reviews. The service is slow and inconsistent.  I love the small patio at the front, the second floor is really just a spill-out area for their busy nights. A good place to visit if you have a craving for a burger/beer and are not in any particular rush."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now, and the quick summary is this: the burgers are great, everything else is so-so.  I love the fact that there's a huge selection of burger choices, especially for the different types of meat. The burgers are big and tasty, well worth the added preparation time. Fries and onion rings were about average. Kids meals were also of generous portions and good quality.  However, the rest of the experience leaves a bit to be desired. The atmosphere inside is shabby and a bit depressing. The service leaves a lot to be desired. Multiple times the waitress had to come back and ask our orders again, and we were often waiting a long time for her to even be in the room, let alone come to our table.  I'll probably go again, as the burgers are still worth the other troubles."}
{"text":"Lunch time with co-workers. This is my second time here, there are not a lot of burger places around so this is like our go to place. There was only a few tables but as they state on their menu, we have to wait 20 minutes for the burger so it is not a place if you need a quick lunch. I got the Hickory stick burger - Hickory smoked BBQ sauce, caramelized onions and melted mozzarella and cheddar with sweet potato fries. The only other thing I expected was some hickory sticks on it to have some crunchy bite to it. The beef patty was very thick. At first, I thought I could finish it, but then as I was two thirds into the burger, was getting full and full. At the end, I just finished the patty and had to sacrifice the bread and some of the fries."}
{"text":"An ok place for burgers. Lots of selection but nothing to make one break their oath of vegetarianism. I would say its a pub with better ha your average burger ."}
{"text":"This place actually has only one kind of burger: the kind that takes forever and a half to arrive. I tried to like the Yellow Griffin--really, I tried, because I like lamburgers and bison burgers and other unconventional burgers. But every time I've gone (four times over the last few years) the service has been inexcusably slow and inattentive. I could almost understand waiting 30 minutes for my order if the place were slammed, but waiting nearly an hour at an off-peak time is just plain ridiculous. So is having to get up and stand in the way of the cash register to get my bill and pay, after trying fruitlessly for ten minutes to catch the waitress' attention. Glass of water didn't arrive until fifteen minutes after I'd sat down and once I'd emptied it, it remained empty. And the hell of it is, their burgers aren't even especially good, nor are they worth the price. There's no excuse for this halfassed, lackadaisical effort. You can do far better in Bloor West Village."}
{"text":"Food was not terrible!  $3 cans of pop kind of are.  The *ambience* was absolutely lovely. The *atmosphere* was full of cigarette smoke from the patio.  Waitress wrote down my friend's order correctly,. Kitchen produced the wrong thing.  Kitchen fixed it by scraping off the wrong toppings and putting on the right ones. (They stuck the sliced pineapple on the grill, to make it look grilled, but it was still cold.)  My friend tells me his bison burger did in fact taste like bison."}
{"text":"Oui on peut y déguster une bonne trentaine de burgers différents : boeuf, porc, bison ou agneau et les combinaisons proposées sont originales et bien pensées. Cependant le lieu mériterait qu'on le nettoie un peu et le service quoi qu'amical n'est pas forcément le plus assidu. Dommage, c'était mieux avant !"}
{"text":"This was one of my favourite spots in Bloor West.  Sadly since the renovations, its lost that British pub feel.  The food is lackluster ( they haven't changed their menu in15 years) and the server appeared overwhelmed even though the Griffin was half empty. Too bad, it used to be so good!"}
{"text":"I have been here more times than I can count.  Lovely owners.  My favs are the maple habanero pork sausage and the jackisback beef burger.  $5 Pints make the patio a hit all summer.  Service takes time when they are busy but who cares, enjoy the atmosphere or go to mcdonalds down the street."}
{"text":"Was disappointing. The beef burger was dry and had no flavour. The greek lamb burger tasted a bit better but it was too salty. The mixed salad with cranberries had no dressing or salt. And the iced tea tasted like they made it using powdered tea. Won't  be visiting again."}
{"text":"Follow these directions for a yummy Yellow Griffin burger!  Step 1: Select type of burger Beef, lamb, chicken, veggie, turkey, or pork (pork has a super thin patty).  Salmon burgers are available too!  Step 2: Select toppings Leave lots of time to read the 35+ descriptions!   Step 3: Select side order Fries, sweet potato fries, zucchini sticks, onion rings, etc.  Step 4: Eat delicious burger and decide to come back to try other toppings.  This place is a lot of fun! A great pub to enjoy a pint and some unique burgers.  I had The Jerk burger.  Jerk seasoning, hot peppers, jalapenos, sour cream, and a fried plantain!  I really wanted the plantain.    The beef burger was huge! I had a hard time with the stems of the jalapenos though. Items with jerk seasoning are never as satisfying as jerk chicken.    The sweet potato fries were crispy and tasty! But, they could have used a bit of seasoning... and I hate skinny fries.  This place is great, but the service sucks.  I found our waitress not very friendly as we asked for recommendations. Regardless, this place is now part of my regular burger rotation!"}
{"text":"Went today with a friend. I got the chicken version of the Kung Fu burger. Noticed it says on the menu that it takes 20mins to cook a burger, implying that that is why it's good. Now I don't mind waiting a little extra for fresh food, but when it came out it didn't rock my socks off after the wait. So I'm not sure exactly what their process  entails?   The Kung Fu burger comes with scallions, peanuts and 'nut sauce' which just tasted like peanut butter, though it looked more saucy. My point with this is.. I was expecting like a satay-style sauce, but I didn't find it was seasoned and came out a little too sweet for my taste. It wasn't bad so I was like \"Whatevs.\"  The main thing was that my chicken was good but pretty dry. It was just an \"ok\" kinda deal.   My friend had ordered a beef patty and she liked the topping but hers was pretty dry as well. We needed water to finish our foods.  The best things about this place were the homemade mayos. If you go, make it a point to order one of the battered sides with the mayos, because they were delicious. We had the onion rings and battered pickles. It was probably the best part of the meal. : ) And the service was fairly good too."}
{"text":"35 burgers WOW!!!  Lot of choice of toppings and cooked to perfection.  The only problem was that for lunch they were understaffed.  Poor woman had taken orders and cleaned tables.  Not that we were in a rush but I felt bad for her.    Anyway I ordered a lamb burger with the picante toppings with a side order of sweet potato fries.  My friend ordered  a turkey burger with onion rings.  I would go back again."}
{"text":"I only ate here once when I was hung over and needed some satisfying food. It was a pretty long wait considering I had a standard order (no exotic meat or any irregular toppings) and there was barely anyone in the place. Not a big complaint, more of a funny story - there was this unruly girl who came in and started arguing with one of the employees over an unpaid tab of over a 100 dollars the previous night. This apparently wasnt her first time doing that. She even seemed drunk at the time as well, and was angry that they wouldnt give her more drinks. She came back in a few minutes later and gave them 40 bucks and they gave her a drink or two. There's always a few characters like that smoking outside the restaurant during nighttime as well.   The food itself was not a good value at all."}
{"text":"This place is a maze and you will be lost in burgers! Yap over 35 burgers to choose from. It took me around 20 min to decide what I wanted. I have no idea on how they manage to keep doing so many burgers and make sure they get them right!  Well I had their Big Jerk burger and it was quite nice and the right size. The stuff was cooked well and was still juicy. The server was quite nice and friendly in taking the orders. The pricing of the burger is easy on the pocket as well.  Its like a local bar with 2 floors and a pool table. The place is located just beside Runnymede Station so its quite accessible and they have a green P behind them as well.   Do check it out!"}
{"text":"Hungry? Don't come here.  They have some of the worst service. You'd think they'd have some more staff for busy nights or if they know there's an event happening. Came here on a Friday night. Apparently they had an event upstairs. Took over an hour to get seated (we were committed to eating here). Service was slow. Took a while before the server even took our order. She was no where to be found after that. It was impossible to tag her down for a refill. Took almost another hour for the food to even arrive! The waitress never came by to check in on us. We were starved and at many times wanted to leave but we're hoping the food would come soon. Even trying to get hold of the waitress to pay the effing bill took ages. At many points we thought of getting up and just leaving without paying. We won't be returning to yellow griffin."}
{"text":"I have zero complaints about my recent visit to the Yellow Griff. I was having a lunch meeting and this was a great mid point between us. I'd read lots about the burgers and truth be told was a little dismayed to see they're only rocking a 3 star. This is misleading.   If you follow my reviews you know that if there's one thing I pride myself about more than anything it's my taste for two things: i) pizza and panzerottos, and ii) burgers. So I felt confident reviewing YG based on my 2,000,000 budgets consumed to date ;)  They're a smaller location with a BIG menu taking up most of the space, with damn near 40 burgers made from a variety of meats. I had a bison patty (one of my personal favourite kinds of meat) with a blue cheese standard topping combination while my dining companion had a CAMEL meat burger done like a cheese burger.  Both were outstanding, the bison a moist meaty cut while the camel was a clean flavour, no at all game-y and just a little drier (likely due to a lesser fat content).  We were the only ones here so service was attentive and food provided quickly. I definitely thing they're worthy of a first visit if you've never been or a revisit if you're been previously and feel like they may deserve a second (delicious) chance after reading this review  Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"The mega burger choice, mega topping choice (takes 20 minutes 'cause it's so good) format has been done elsewhere and better but it plays pretty well in a pub environment.. It is a nice alternative to middling shepherd's pie, mediocre fish and chips and one or two stock burgers. Place was busy, as expected for a Friday.  We got seated quickly but it was three around a tiny round coffee table with tiny stools.  We looked like a brownie meeting.  Eventually the neighbours moved and we colonized their wee table.  Service was friendly and capable.  Unfortunately, it was one server doing the work of two and she seemed to be run off her feet,.  Burgers -- I had the veggie New Mexican -- some spicy stuff, some fresh stuff and a little peanut butter -- pretty tasty all in all.  From the choice of sides the sweet potato fries and the fried pickles were the winners at our table.  Ordinary fries were quiet ordinary.  A willingness to pay for parking in the municipal lot out back makes this place much less of a parking hassle."}
{"text":"I've been to this place about 6 times and every time the service gets worse and worse. All they need to do is hire one more person.  Two people working both floors is just not enough.  I love the burgers (but not their buns), love the sides (sweet potato fries too thick) but just not the service.  Please hire and/or schedule one more person per shift.  If you are in a hurry I'd say take a pass and wait until you have tons of time on your hands."}
{"text":"I like this place! Only been there once, because they were doing a trivia night on Thursday, and it was really fun.  I ordered a chicken burger with blue cheese and choose onion rings as side dish, everything was very tasty and the service was quick, very welcoming and nice. Yet the funniest was the trivia night - we really had a very good time eating our burgers, drinking our IPAs and trying to solve the trivia enigmas!!  Would not recommend it if you are looking for the best burgers in the city but the trivia evening is a very funny experience."}
{"text":"Love this joint.  My default place to go to when my friends are in the neighborhood and want some burgers.  The selection is amazing and prices are fair.    They have over 35 different burgers, but once you start picking different meat patties then your options grow even bigger.  Every time I go there I pick something different.  Once  tried their burger with crunchy peanut butter.  It took me a few visits before I felt so adventures, but damn, it was surprisingly a great burger.  Their beer selection is decent too.  And if you have a big party going on, make it at Yellow Griffin, they have  enough space upstairs as well.  I would have given it a perfect rating but, sometimes the service is slow. It takes nearly 20 minutes for your burger to arrive."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite spots to eat in bloorwest village. The amount of combos for burger toppings and beers to pair with it is impressive. Always have had friendly service. And pricing is fair"}
{"text":"The selection of both meat varieties, toppings, and sides at the Yellow Griffin is nothing short of impressive. Warning - it may take a while to decide what you want!   They have Shock Top on tap, which I love. Their prices seem fair. The washrooms could do with a reno...  Why I am giving this place 3 stars instead of higher is that after careful consideration, I finally picked my meat, topping combo, and side... and it was all just OK. Perhaps when you have to consider which of 35 burger combos to choose from, once you do make your selection you really build it up in your head to be this amazing flavour combo. But everything I've had there has just been OK. I would definitely go back again to try new combinations for fun, and they have a room upstairs that apparently you can book for free. Seems like it could make a good place to host a get together. Just wish the food blew me away a bit more."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible food and service. It took well over an hour to get food and there was only one other table in the restaurant. Buns were stale. Meat was WAY over cooked. DO NOT EAT HERE. SAVE YOURSELF."}
{"text":"Oh the Calypso bison burger, what a great dinner specimen you are! The avocado, the huge lettuce, the yummy fries. All good!   The wait is a little long, but this is not a fast food place, good things come to those who wait. Our party of three had three different wait staff...odd, but we got our proper orders, so that is really all that mattered.   If you are in the area and want a burger - recommend a visit!"}
{"text":"This place could only have come to be if a great burger cook was in the middle of a LSD trip while then suffering a schizophrenic attack AND then deciding to write down the recipe's that randomly popped into his brain.  I mean, this place has over 30 different types/styles of burgers, and, depending on your tastes, reading a few of them will automatically make you wonder if the toppings in them can, do or should go together in the same burger. But hey, that is part of what makes this place fun!   Quite honestly I do not even remember the burgers I have had, I just try to avoid the Italian inspired ones and go for the ones that have avocado and lots of cheese. Which by the way, avocado & cheese in burgers? What an inspired choice.   Seriously, this is one of the highlights of Bloor West. With it's two floors, it's laid back pub/wood inspired decor, The Griffin is a fun place where you can go with your friends, have a beer/drink or two and have an awesome burger. Prices are fair although the beer is a buck or so more than I would have expected from a regular pub which does add up ...but the sweet potato fries are fun to eat.   This place is truly an unadulterated  Burger Joie De Livre!  You heard it here first!   PS:. I actually went to check their website, they have over 35 burgers now!"}
{"text":"We were headed to Bloor West Village/High Park last week to buy some paper at the scrapbooking store, so decided to try out a few venues while were were there.  The boy was in The mood for wings, so we had already checked out the options on-line. we had narrowed it down to the Yellow Griffin, or Shakeys.  The atmosphere at the Yellow Griffin was super \"pub-by\" when we walked in, so we decided to stay there.  The main staple on their menu is their burgers. They have two pages of different topping combinations to choose from, with a list of different meats (and veggies) to form your burger. Apparently all the burger orders take 20 mins (a great ploy to get you to drink more!).  I went for the \"Calypso\" burger, with avocado, cheese and mango.  It wasn't worth the wait. The meat was over cooked, and the avocado and mango had no flavour. The boy did get wings, which he said were \"ok\".  The beer was good though, so i would definitely go back for a drink!"}
{"text":"I came here a few times for a Sunday breakfast back when they did that, but they stopped doing so. I like the surroundings, and the small patio; however the reason I do not stop in any more is that a place with a choice of 35 burgers holds no interest for me. I love pub food; this is not it - strictly a personal preference. I regret that they changed so completely to stricly a burger place."}
{"text":"Took a nice stroll on a weekday afternoon and ended up here for Guinness and a burger on the patio. What a selection of burgers... amazing but so hard to choose... decided on the stilton burger with roasted garlic and walnuts... hey I wasn't going out that evening - something I cant make at home so why not take a chance ... so glad I did!!! . It was fantastic... just perfect!!! I need to come back and bring the boys!!! My onion ring (side) were crisp and not greasy... Love it... so nice to find a burger that isn't a frozen patty!!! I will be back!!!!!!"}
{"text":"After pretty much exactly 20 minutes, our burgers arrived!  I ordered the Hickory Stick Burger with 8 oz Canadian Grade A Beef with a side of Fresh Greens.  The Hickory Stick Burger came with Hickory smoked BBQ sauce, caramelized onions, and melted mozzarella and cheddar. The burger itself was gorgeous with its melted mozzarella and cheddar in huge slices on top of the grade A beef and the Hickory smoked BBQ sauce drizzled over it.  I was very impressed with the size of the included Fresh Greens side.  There was a lot of it and for that, I was very grateful to have so much greens with my meal!  I really liked the Hickory Stick Burger.  It was very savory and the ingredients melded together very well.  The Fresh Greens salad was fresh, leafy, and great as well!"}
{"text":"Still a fan.  TOO MANY CHOICES.   After about 15 mins of reading everything on the menu, you finally make your choice. Each one of these burgers come with a choice side (see the text on the right side of the menu) and don't forget to ask for your dipping sauce (little known fact on the back of the menu - I forgot this time!).  Was here for an event last night to celebrate Melanie C. and other girls new hair. The upstairs is a great place for a private event and fit about 30-40 people comfortably, with standing room, the bar area and seated areas. There are a few servers and a bartender who will help take your order and you pay at the bar.  Other than them bringing you your food, everything else was self serve.   I had the one with Mango and Avacado with Cheddar cheese on a lamb patty. It was good, but not the best. I'll try something else next time.    Can't wait for another excuse to go again."}
{"text":"Well, that was awkward.  This place isn't cheap and it fancies itself on being a burger joint and a bar.  Burgers + side is anywhere between $12-$20 depending on what you get.    I ordered the Calypso burger (bison instead of beef) with zucchini stick.  A Calypso burger basically has mango, avocado, tomato, lettuce and a bit of sauce on it.  The bison tasted fresh and didn't seem frozen, which was great, however, the overall mixings of the burger didn't give me a \"WOW\" moment.  I think that I paid close to $18 prior to tax.  Value to taste wise - maybe 3 stars.   -------- So why I am giving this place only one star? Because I was sitting by my lonesome and wanted some privacy on the small patio and then this \"regular\" just sits down at my table. He was an older gentleman, maybe in his 60's and told me he was just waiting for someone and sipping Starbucks.  I said \"umm...sure...uhh....ok\".  I thought he might order food, but after 5 minutes, he was just staring at me and the surroundings and it got really awkward.  The waiter knew he was a regular and I said \"umm...this guy just sat here\" and he asked me if it was okay.  I said \"I guess\".  I didn't understand why he couldn't sit inside or sit at the Starbucks next door.   The fact that the waiter didn't tell him that he had to sit inside or that he can't just sit at people's table is baffling. He got preferential treatment (which I understand for regulars, but shouldn't be infringing upon other's meal enjoyment) even though I was the one paying close to $20.  I was a bit scared he would steal my food or spit in it.  Now if it was really busy inside and the guy wanted to somewhere to sit, I would have no problem sharing a table.  Being a person that dines regularly at Asian restaurants, I'm no stranger to sharing tables, but they always ask you first. And by they, I mean the waiter/host(ess), etc, not the customer.  I honestly felt so uncomfortable, I thought about leaving even though I already had ordered my food.  I thought about it and while I do still feel slightly bad about kicking the guy off my table, I really just wanted to dine in peace.  He had plenty of places to sit inside.   -----------  Verdict: Not a bad burger, plenty of selections (over 35 types of burgers), but they let regulars run all over them, so probably not the best place to dine.  I would much rather go to some more communal burger joint where it's known you'll be sharing seating space."}
{"text":"Waitress (manager/owner as well?) was nice, attentive, and helpful.  But that's about all I can say.  1) out of camel burger, when that was one of the main reasons I wanted to check it out 2) burger had a medium-well cook and was slightly dry, also slightly too big (in my opinion).. otherwise, quite average and palatable 3) poutine (+$) was one of the worst I've had.. oil-soaked dark brown fries 4) two burgers, the upcharge on poutine, and zero beverages somehow came to just over $50 with tax+tip  I would most definitely pick the Firkin across the street over this place for just about everything."}
{"text":"I can't really add much more than the lovely yelpers have already but I will say this - GET THE PB&J BURGER!!  I've had it twice and since then I've tried something new and the burgers have been okay but I get really angry food regret when I realize that I SHOULD have gotten the peanut butter burger!!! SO GOOD."}
{"text":"I recommend this place. Good food, good draft beer selection, prices are reasonable. The service, however, is absolutely terrible. The staff themselves are great, but anytime I've gone, they only seem to have 1 server, which equals a lot of time spent with an empty glass. This place REALLY needs to hire more servers. That's what would have brought my 4-star rating up to a 5-star rating. Other than the lousy wait times for service, great pub. Try the breaded dill pickles. They are excellent. And worth the wait. =)"}
{"text":"Stepped into this place to grab a bite to eat while I was running errands in the west end.  I was initially intrigued because they had a sign that said they now offered bison burgers.  The inside looks just brings a regular pub but their burger patty choices are extensive along with the combinations of dressings for your burger.  I asked the server what they would recommend and they said the lamb patties are great.  I decided on a lamb patty with the Bloor St special (argula, garlic aoil, blue cheese, onions, and tomatoes).  The patty (along with fries I believe) were cooked to order which was worth the wait and the way I would always prefer it tbh.    The burger was very tasty and you could taste the lamb patty.  It was ever so slightly pink in the middle which I appreciated.  If I am out in the west of end of Bloor again, I would definitely give Yellow Griffin Tavern another visit and this time try the bison burger."}
{"text":"My favourite burger joint in the entire world (thus far)! I discovered this place a few years ago when visiting High Park (it's a 5 minute drive), and it's become a tradition to eat here every spring before checking out the cherry blossoms at High Park. I would love to come more often but I unfortunately live quite far away.  Beginning with parking - there's street parking right in front or you can park around the corner on one of the side streets for free. This place is quite small, but there's also a top floor which you can book for large parties. Despite its size and there only being 1 or 2 servers, I've never had to wait to be seated. The only downside is that burgers take anywhere between 20-40 minutes, but that's how you know it's made as fresh as it can be.  This place is known for burgers and sausages - you can choose anything from turkey/chicken/beef to wild boar/camel/bison. I've only gotten burgers from here though. There are a ton of preset topping combos and then you just choose what meat you want. The burgers are simple, but oh so very juicy and fresh! Each one comes with either sweet potato fries or onion rings and your choice of dip. Prices are quite expensive at around $15-$20 per burger, but it's definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"35 choix de burger, rien que ça!  Et en plus choisissez votre viande comme vous le souhaitez pour n'importe quel accompagnement! comptez entre 10 et 14$ HT le burger!  gros point noir: 2,70$ la canette de Coca, non mais oh, ou va le monde!!!"}
{"text":"I have been to Yellow Griffin quite a few times over the last couple of years, but last night was my first visit back in about 6months. My first experience was just in passing by on the way to somewhere else and seeing their sign advertising the new boar and camel burgers. So I looked them up on Yelp and went back the next week. As a pub, it's a quieter change from other places that I tend to go to watch sports. It is much more laid back, each group having its own conversations, while either background music plays (Steely Dan, Joni Mitchell, some blues) or sometimes one of the regulars programs their own choices into a digital jukebox. Whatever Toronto team is playing will be on the smallish TV screens, but usually no volume. The servers and regulars are friendly enough to talk with.  As for food, the main focus seems to be specialty burgers, but I think that their sausages are actually better. There are lots of different themed toppings that are available on any type of patty, beef / chicken / turkey / lamb / vegetarian or boar and camel for an extra charge. A few options that I have enjoyed are the English breakfast burger (with baked beans and fried egg) and the pulled pork burger (pulled pork on top of the burger patty). In addition to the side of fries, there are sweet potato fries or breaded pickles or salads. There is also the usual pub fare sometimes with a twist, such as poutine with chicken and peas or beer-battered fish and chips.  But I think their best meals are the sausages: wild boar with truffle, venison with chili, cherry duck with fennel. Each one comes on a toasted pretzel bun, with about a dozen different toppings to choose from, such as chipotle aioli or brie. Last night, I had the wild boar with truffle and pistachio sausage with mango relish and sweet potato fries. One of their best.   The bar is stocked with all the usual bottles, and the beer selection has some common options plus a few specialties like the Polish Tyskie that I had once. With a couple of drinks last night, my bill came to $35, a little more than I would pay elsewhere but acceptable for the unusual menu selections."}
{"text":"Some careless person threw bread crumbs into oncoming traffic. People are so rude/gross!!! Everyone knows that the Bloordale-Parkdale pigeons' #1 weakness is breadcrumbs. And you're gonna put breadcrumbs on the road during the morning rush?! You monsters.  On a typical day I would consider this a bad omen, but unlike those pigeons, my day was GREAT!  The original plan was to go to The Works up the street, but fortunately The Yellow Griffin just happened to be closer.  I ordered the Calypso burger with onion rings and they were too delicious to describe. My bf had the Canadian burger and he thought it was amazing as well.  Even the beverages were fresh and delicious.   There was a HUGE and THICK bee flying around the windows inside the restaurant.  The bee was slow; I actually think it was a wasp.  Wasps are the ones with the child-bearing hips and the terrifying dangly legs.  This wasp is my only constructive criticism.  Next time either escort it off the premises or get a clip board and slap it down from the air until you hear that thud sound.   For all of the above reasons, I give The Yellow Griffin, 4 stars.  The star that elevates it to 5, is the delightful gentleman who wears the hearty smile and pleasant disposition. Another delightfully symmetrical man serving on the west side. He didn't even fumble when that big ol bee came around. I love that guy but he probably wont call.  5 STARS!!!"}
{"text":"i have probably been here 10 times, I don't know why I come back.  But I do.  Part of it is that I live in the neighbourhood so it's always a last-minute, easy, convenient pub.  Here's the rub:  they're generally busy and even when they're not you have to wait at least 30 minutes for food and probably 10 for a server to greet your table.  The food is average.  The menu seems amazing but it's actually just fair.  The sweet potato fries are good.  The beer selection is pretty good but they're often annoyingly out of some.  Don't come here for the customer service--it's perfunctory at best.  You have to ask for everything that you need (drink refills, napkins, menus (!), catsup (it's a burger joint!), cutlery, app plates, etc.).  No one thanks you for coming or is visibly pleased when you've arrived.    With gourmet burger joints being all the rage and popping up everywhere, it is definitely worth it to investigate some of those.  But if you're in BWV, and you're hungry and have time to wait, this place won't kill you (or your pocketbook).  Oh yeah, this place could use a REALLY thorough cleaning!"}
{"text":"Dining Experience: Lunch Specialty: Burgers Menu items: Gringo Burger, Calypso Burger &amp; Hold the Port Burger   I have officially started my quest to find the best Burger joints in town. It seems that Toronto with its diversity, multiculturalism and its many food options flowing from all over the world, would definitely have many spots to choose from. That will be wrong.   I have been to so many burger joints in the hopes of having my \"aha\" moment with no such luck; so I have decided to blog and review my top burger spots as I go on with this quest.   Some places have passed the test, others have not. Yellow Griffin Pub (YGP) is one spot that has officially made the list, along with its crazy and out of this world menu of over 35 burgers to choose from. That said, there will be more reviews coming in the next few months. As I continue to stuff my belly with the precious delights, I will be advising you of where the best places in the city can be found. And when I finally find the \"it\" place, I will be sure to let you know of it too.   For now, here is my review of Yellow Griffin Pub. By the way, at the end of this post, you will find a list of \"been there done that\" joints that did not make the cut. This is for your reference, so you know which places have not hit the spot with me. Feel free to also send me a note with recommends on your fav joints, that will really help me in my quest.  Ok Gringos, let me start off with YGP's Gringo burger. With the option to choose from 8 different patties (like beef, bison, chicken, lamb or veggie) and 10 sides, I go for the beef version of The Gringo burger with onion rings. This comes with mixed Mexican beans, lettuce, sour cream, chili sauce, homemade guac (aka guacamole) and cheddar cheese. The meat is very well done and the bread is fresh. I would have liked I bit more juice on the beef patty, but with the many sauces topping it off, it actually help the moisture level, so the overall experience is great. This is of my favourites yet.  To try and keep up with the many burger options, we decided to add a little colour and go for the beef version of the Calypso burger.  Naming this burger after a Greek goddess is actually kind of cool. The menu at YGP has the Calypso burger topped off with desirous bacon, jealous avocado, envious mango and covetous cheddar cheese. Although not my personal favourite, we did find the choice of ingredients quite good and mixing in well. I never thought avocado, cheddar, bacon and mango slices can go this well. Kudos to YGP for making it work. I almost wonder what an Odysseus burger would have if they had it on the menu.  And from Greek, we go to the Hold the Port burger. Now, this is where I get lost in translation with YGP's menu. Most burgers have an interesting story or theme to them...and then all of the sudden they hit you with a \"Hold the Port\" nonsense. Thank goodness the burger was good, 'cause I was about to minus some star ratings here otherwise.   This burger holds its own with a nice big portobello mushroom topped with fresh crumbled blue cheese. Once again, the juiciness coming from the mushroom and the strong flavour deriving from the cheese make this burger a great choice. Definitely holding the flavour port here.  YGP's sides are also something worth mentioning. Even though this is a burger quest, I find that any burger review could just as easily be affected if one has saggy or plain sides to accompany it with. This is yet another reason why YGP made it on the quest. All sides we tried, the Onion Rings, Sweet Potato Fries and the Poutine were well executed. Nothing was too saggy, salty, plain or oily. If I had to choose, I would always go for the sweet potato fries.  As promised, here my list of \"been there done that\" burger joints that did not make the cut, meaning...ok, but not amazing.      * Burger Bar     * Craft Burger     * Apache     * Sliders     * Grindhouse Burger Bar     * Retail Chains like McDonald's, Burger King, Harvey's, etc.  Until next time Foodies!  Buen Provecho, Viviana."}
{"text":"This place does burgers. It does them lots and it does them well. And it does them in about a million combos. Try something different. Just go for it. You will be pleasantly surprised. If you're not...please don't blame me!  Nothing crazy to report. Food was good, service was good. Yum."}
{"text":"I've visited this place a couple times since moving to the High Park area and have been fully satisfied every time.  If you're looking for a good burger give this place a try!    The variety of burgers is the best I have seen in Toronto - everything from a plain burger, to spicy burgers, to peanut-butter and jam... Hopefully you get the picture!  I think there is something for everyone.  Also each burger can be done with beef, lamb, chicken, turkey, vegetarian, or bison.  And there are also a variety of cheeses that can be added, including brie which is a personal favorite.    The burgers have all been really tasty!    Also, the variety of sides are pretty great too and everything I've tried has been good - potato salad, garden salad, coleslaw, fries, poutine (tried it and it was good - real cheese curds and good gravy), or sweet potato fries.    The Yellow Griffin also has a nice selection of beer on tap which is nice, and a small patio out front which is a nice bonus.    The prices are very decent for a burger and side - around  12 or 13 dollars.    Finally, the service has been really good each time I've been here.  The waitresses have been attentive but not overbearing.    A really good burger place!"}
{"text":"Probably the best burgers in the BWV 'hood, and surrounding.  Takes awhile because they are prepared & cooked fresh, but well worth the wait."}
{"text":"NOT WORTH THE MONEY   stop here to eat dinner and sat at the bar  and ordered a regular beef cheeseburger and the cost was $18 and change. The Burger and fries where good but nothing you can't get at hero burgers.  Waitress was friendly and helped me with the menu and service was fast.. but when the waitress went to inquire how much longer for the food the chef yelled at her and said \"if people don't want to wait tell them to go to McDonald's I'm sick of people bothering g me\" sad thing is I never asked her how long I was enjoying my beer while waiting for my food... definitely won't be going back"}
{"text":"I went here with a number of friends for a World Cup game, so the place was busy and understaffed. That may have been why the food was not good and they messed up my friend's order.   I had the Bahama Mama with lamb and a side of zucchini sticks. The burger was very disappointing. The lamb tasted like it was one of those pre-cooked burgers available at the supermarket. The zucchini sticks were ok, but anything deep fried is usually good.   My friends ordered other burgers and all felt the same.   I definitely will not be going back."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time last night as they claim to have the best burgers. While the selection of burgers is large, their sides are somewhat lacking. For appetitzer, got the nachos, was given a pretty small portion of sour cream. Nachos were soggy and bland not very good at all. I got the Ploughman's burger and fries, the fries definitely were out of a bag, but tasty nonetheless, the burger's sauce was DELICIOUS! Very yummy, but the burger was kind of dry. Service was lacking, one server on a busy saturday night, place is VERY small, washrooms are very narrow and down a steep staircase. Was kind of grossed out by the fact that they didn't have liquid soap, but a bar of soap on the sink. Iced tea was brewed daily, but from a powder. Overall it was decent, nothing special tho."}
{"text":"Three and a half stars.  Four stars for the meat patty by itself.   On a good day I have trouble just trying to figure out what pair of socks to put on let alone pick up a menu that has 35 burger options staring me in the face. Someone over at the Yellow Griffin has way too much time on their hands and must have consumed a ton of pints the day they sat down and came up with all these goofy burger names. Why do people think a pun is fun on a bun? The kvetch included burger names such as the Burning School House, Skippy Dipper, Don Juan and St. Peter's Burger.   My Decemburger quest continued, this time in the trendy Bloor West Village at Runnymede and Bloor. The YG is really more just a local watering hole with just as many beer options as burgers. More challenges for me. In the end I opted for the Creme Caramel which is the burger with caramelized onions, sauteed mushrooms and a tangy BBQ sauce and sided it with fries. All the burgers range price with the cheapest being $9.95 and it escalates from there. For a bison burger you add $2.75 to the bottom line. The price tag includes a side (fries, sweet potato fries, greens, potato salad, onion rings) which you choose. I opted for the fries with a side order of gravy.   You have no burger patty size options at the YG. Everything is 8 ounces and let me tell you 8 ounces is a pretty hefty burger. I'd even go as far to say that this burger was 8 ounces cooked which means it probably started out at almost 10 ounces raw.  It was a two hander all the way.  I had read Susan C.'s review on the Burger Bar where she complained about the bun overpowering the meat well this is totally not the case at the YG. That patty is huge and what was even nicer was the middle of it was super juicy and pink. Now this might scare the crap outta those paralyzed in fear of being poisoned by improperly cooked meat but I didn't flinch. Mamma was loving her some meat on Bloor Street.   On the patty alone I would have given this spot five stars. What knocked a a star off was that the \"tangy\" BBQ sauce which really tasted like out of a jar Kraft sauce.  It was cloying and distracting to taste of the meat. Good BBQ sauce should enhance not distract you from the meat. Fries were decent. Hot, crispy and plentiful. I have had better but then again I've had a lot worse. The gravy was delicious and actually tasted as though it had been made from beef drippings. A rarity for gravy in restaurants these days.   Service was spotty. It wasn't all that busy when we arrived. We got drinks right away but it took a few minutes to get our waitresses attention to order food. After she brought me my plate it took me another wait to get condiments. The condiment rack arrives and I say to her \"do you have any relish\" to which she replies \"relish? I don't think so.\" What the eff? A burger place with no relish but a menu that has hundred of other toppings for your burgers? I don't get this. Eventually she comes back to me with a little plastic cup. in it a splotch of relish.   After a couple of weeks of gobbling up ground beef on a bun I'm reaching the point where I'd like to pick an oleo of the burger elements of the different restos I've been in and out. The patty from the Yellow Griffin, the bun from the Burger Bar, the caramelized onions from Craft Burger, the sweet potato fries from the Original Motorcycle Burger and so it goes.   My quest continues. I'll tell ya, after a few weeks of this, the thought of eating turkey at Christmas is beginning to look pretty damn good. (urp)"}
{"text":"Server was a little cray cray today. She was overwhelmed by the amount of people here tonight and quite frankly this place was under staffed for a Friday night. There was one bartender and one waitress.   I enjoyed my burger. It wasn't the best but I come here because I like their red pepper dip! I got it with onions rings and sweet potato fries. I had a burger with caramelized onions, mushrooms, cheese and a beef patty.  The burger was fine in my opinion but my picky boyfriend said it was a bit dry in the middle.   Besides the moment the waitress was in a hurry to take our orders and rolled her eyes when I asked my boyfriend whether or not I should get the onion rings or sweet potato fries...(yeah don't think I didnt see -_-\") I will give this place 2 stars. The food was decent. The place is small. Service was slow. Customer service lacked. BUTTT..  I'll still come back because I love me some of that red pepper sauce and onion rings :)"}
{"text":"It's been quite a while since I've gone back to the Yellow Griffin. After moving away from Bloor West, I haven't really felt the urge to go back. Last night my friends wanted to try a 'new' burger place, so we headed off to the Griffin. This place has been around for ages, serving fancy-ass burgers before it became cool, so it's funny that it's now playing second fiddle to Craft Burger, BQM and all these new burger shops. I suspect being so far West doesn't help matters.   Anyway: the burgers are still pretty damn good. They are gigantic and tasty, but served on buns that are probably just a bit too small for them. Your meal will be messy. The sweet potato fries are still really good.  The service is still slow as fuck. You can't eat service, so I wasn't too bothered."}
{"text":"Sometimes, too many choices can be a bit overwhelming.  35 to be exact!    I am not one to argue about having choices. Some places are so limited that you wish for more. In this case, although it may take time, I plowed through the style of burger then the choice of patty.  Overall, it was not too bad. I will say, the burger was a little too under done for my liking. I love a juicy that isn't overcooked. In general, a satisfying and healthy sized sandwich. In addition, I was quite pleased with sweet potato fries."}
{"text":"$15 for a hamburger that the kitchen screwed up, the wait staff refuses to correct and a 20-30 minute wait for THAT much.  No thanks.  See other reviews here and note that your recession dollars are best spent on a business that at least pretends to care about doing a good job."}
{"text":"I've always wanted to like this place way more than I do.  I was there even before its official opening and I've spent many an evening there until the wee hours.  I've partaken of their over 35 different burgers (and really, shouldn't that be 35 different toppings?) and they're fine.  It is a family-run business which is a great thing to support, but sometimes the staff can go from the polite to the impertinent.  There were attempts to bring stand-up comedy to the upstairs room (which would definitely suit an event) but there was no publicity or even a sandwich board or flyer in the bathroom to indicate that comedy would be performed.  It typically finished in tears.  Admittedly it is a quaint spot and I have enjoyed many of my moments there, but it appears to be consistently inconsistent.  On their website they have a related link to TorontoBrides.com and DiscJockeysUnforgettable.ca.  So they get a lot of wedding traffic now, do they?  Must be the burgers."}
{"text":"I had some hope for this place. Their menu online looked decent, and there have been some decent reviews.  My friends and I scoured the menu before coming, since people have mentioned it takes up to 30 minutes to cook the darned things. Upon arriving, we learned that they had changed their menu, and jacked the prices up by $1-2 per burger. We had to spend more time looking at the menu since they removed 12 burgers from the menu they have on their website, and added 12 new ones. Ugh..  I also read they had a lot of beers on tap. When we got there, I found they only had 6. A lot of their other taps were emptied.   Menu changes, reduced beers on tap, jacked up prices.. are all signs that point to a struggling restaurant to me. And I can see why..  I tried the Gringo burger, and it was nothing fancy at all. A regular patty with a dollop of sour cream and store bought guac on it... the patty was a bit dry.   They had a coin operated pool table and dart board upstairs. Great right? Well, it would be if the pool table wasn't missing a ball (which we found out AFTER we paid $1.50 for it) and if the cues actually had tips on them. And if the place actually owned some darts!!! We asked the bartender for darts and he told us they didn't have any. What, did you have to hock off the darts to keep this place afloat?  Save your time and money."}
{"text":"Far too many people wander into McDonalds, without giving a second thought to Yellow Griffin next door. Maybe it's because they want to save their wallets the agony of the price tag here, but the burgers are generally well worth the wait and cost.  The Griffin offers a wide selection of burgers, both in terms of meats (beef, pork, chicken, turkey, veggie, lamb, salmon and bison) and topping on the burger (mango slices, hot peppers, peanut butter). The burgers come with clever names like the Bollywood Burger (tandoori rub, gree onion, and mango chutney yoghurt), and the New Mexican (New Mexican (Santa Fe salsa, tabasco, guacamole, peanut butter, diced sweet potatoes, and chopped coriander.)  Burgers are cooked up fresh, so the average wait time is something around 20 minutes after you order. Sides include the usual suspects like onion rings, fries, coleslaw, and breaded pickles. Fries are usually plentiful and tasty, while onion rings are decent, you get less than a handful.  The one problem with the Yellow Griffin is consistency. In terms of both food and service, you're not sure what to expect one trip to the next, although both trips recently have been good. Maybe there's new workers? Sometimes portions of fries come very small, and burgers just don't have same zing. Other times they pile on the toppings, and the burgers taste extremely fresh.  As for the place itself, they open a patio up during the summer, but inside they have numerous booths in which to sit, lining a dark wood interior. They have a couple of televisions and a bar near the back with numerous beers on tap. This place is not always the cleanest when it comes to what you'll find when you sit down, so you might expect some sticky tables.   I definitely recommend this place, but be aware that it might take a couple of trips to experience the best they have to offer. For the price of the burgers, and the wait, I would hope you could expect more, but alas. If the next few trips I find they've really improved with their consistency, I'll bump them to four stars."}
{"text":"A whole lot of hoopla over nothing. Turkey burger with caramelized onions and mushrooms was oddly tasteless. Zucchini sticks had a weird taste. Menu says Belgians would be proud of the fries - dreams! They are average at best. Go for drinks. Don't waste your money on the food."}
{"text":"Sometimes you just feel like a burger, whether it comes in veggie, beef or even lamb form. The Yellow Griffin Pub is one of my favourite places to grab life by the buns, especially when BBQ season is long gone (your once flame spitting grill now covered in a foot of snow). There are over thirty five different kinds of burgers that you can choose to make either with chicken, turkey, salmon, pork, lamb, veggie, bison or traditional ground chuck. The toppings range from plain (absolutely nothing) to fancy (stilton cheese, jalapenos, grilled red peppers) to weird (peanut butter and jam). One of my favourites, The Waldorf Astoria, has topping with celery, walnuts, apples and mayo. Sounds weird, I know, but it's oh so good!"}
{"text":"This place has your average pub fare with the WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!  Came here on a Sunday for a meet-up and the owner immediately started to harass me about how I had to order something because she was being so gracious to let us use her space (and I had ordered something, just not an entire meal). I then proceeded to ask her if anything on her menu was completely gluten free, and she berated by by telling me that people were dumb for not eating gluten and implying that I was an idiot for doing this. Firstly, I am a grown ass person, and do not need to be lectured about what to put in my body. Secondly, Celiac disease is a real condition where one's own villi and micro villi are destroyed when they ingest gluten, and this is sometimes irreparable damage, so no, I do not think it's stupid to avoid gluten if you have a condition. Ignorant hate speech really grinds my gears, and so I will not soon be coming back,"}
{"text":"We've been here many times over the years and love the variety of burgers to try. The burgers are great, sweet potato fries are great, have ordered a few varieties and have enjoyed all of them. Good selection of beer . Great location on Bloor West"}
{"text":"This place is now on my list of top burger places in the city. I would have never suspected their extensive burger selection had a friend not told me. There's at least 25 different kinds of burgers on the menu, and you can choose the kind of meat. Lots of interesting options. Besides beef, there's lamb, bison, chicken, salmon.  I ordered the waldorf astoria with lamb, as advised by my friend, a regular. Its got a apple celery  and walnut garlic sauce (more like a little salad actually) on it. thats it. fantastic. The onion rings ain't half bad either.  If it wasn't so far west, i'd go more often."}
{"text":"The Yellow Griffin has a lot going for it -  It seems trendy, it has a patio, you can rent out the top floor for parties, free of charge.  And there is the burger menu.  But - this review, it's about the food.  And the food is not great.  I've been to the Griffin six or seven times.  When you live in Bloor West you, at times, find yourself attracted to it.  But six months ago was the last time I was there.  A hamburger should not cost more than 10 dollars.  It doesn't matter that you've come up with a nonsense amount of toppings, it's still a hamburger.  And a hamburger should taste great - especially at the prices you're paying.  But sadly, Yellow Griffin does not satisfy.  A good burger can be found at the Burger's Priest.  Why the Griffin hasn't learned to make a tasty treat like that is beyond me, unless of course, they don't have to.  It's always crowded - which is, of course, another issue.  And the service is beyond slow.  If you're looking to impress someone who will be distracted by the fantastic menu, then this place is for you.  If you're there for the food?  Well, it's more than a bit of a let down.  Still - like I said, I'd been there a number of times.  It's hard to resist the allure.  Just know you've been warned."}
{"text":"Nice cozy place.  Burger takes 20 mins. to cook but they have a selection of wild meats including boar and camel. I had the boar and my friend had the camel."}
{"text":"Tons of options (some really great) and everything is fresh and simple. The service depends a bit on the day of the week, but even the menu tells you it'll be a bit of a wait. I dig an honest menu.   Hickory is a favourite, New Mexican and the Gringo. Calypso is popular, but I've never been with anyone who ended up disappointed regardless of their order. Sweet potato fries with curry mayo dip is the winner side dish, though.   It's definitely a burger bar; the drink selection is pretty much entirely Labatt, so it's basic. The party room you can rent upstairs is great for small groups, and the staff has always really friendly. The new renovations are a bit odd, but they always seem to be improving their menu and ingredients... They seem really into making it as good as it can be."}
{"text":"Good burgers, everything else below par.  They got a great selection of burgers.  I tried a few burgers there: 3 cheeses and LA Louvre.  (20$ each taxand tip) Both were good, the burger itself was a bit dry, but the topics on it made up for it.    The locale: almost breaking down.  The washrooms are the worst I have seen.  The hallway to it is too narrow for two ppl to go by each other.  The actual washroom stalls are cramps and low ceilings.   The tables upstairs were small and looked like it has not been renovated in 20 years.   Service: the waitress came to ask us for food, deliver it and take away the dishes.  I liked thaat she did not disturb us but was in the area if we needed something more  Suggestion: go there I'd you want good burgers, but don't expect to be amazed and hope u don't have to go to the washroom"}
{"text":"So, apparently The Yellow Griffin's big claim to fame is that it has over 35 burgers on the menu for you to choose from. If you are someone who likes to be overwhelmed with choices, then that will surely be enough of a draw. I can attest that burgers do make up the bulk of the menu, and that the options will provide your tastebuds with a journey about the globe, spanning from Far East flavors to those with European flare, to your standard North American toppings as well. You can also choose from a wide assortment of meats to make up the patty (beef, lamb, salmon, veggie, bison... if you can get it in the butcher section of your supermarket, then chances are this place will make it into a burger for you), so the burger permutations are somewhere up in the hundreds, and you are sure to find a few things on the menu that sound good.  When my husband and I had lunch here with a friend, we decided to take a gastronomic tour of the British Isles:  I opted for the Ploughman's burger while he could not resist the sound of the British Breakfast burger; both of us chose lamb as our meat. I can't help but wonder if this was our downfall - we weren't asked how we would like our burgers cooked, and both of ours came out well done, and rather tough. I have never seen frozen lamb burgers, but something about these ones struck me as not being handformed patties, and they had a flavor to them that was rather strong. I did like the toppings on my burger (and they were quite ample), but my husband's were way off the mark: the egg was overcooked, so rather than the yolk oozing when he took a bite, it was hard and chalky. The so-called baked beans were an odd mix of kidney and pinto beans, definitely not what comes to mind when you think of British baked beans. All told, my burger was passable, my husband's was a disaster.  As for the sides, my onion rings were very good (nicely breaded, crispy, not soggy at all), but I hardly think 4 onion rings (2 large, 2 little) is a fair portion size, even for a side. They were more generous with the fries, but they weren't anything special.  I am always leery of places that seem to subscribe to the \"more is more\" mentality, and I think The Yellow Griffin goes a fair way to prove my point. Although the number of burger options on the menu is truly staggering, and most of them sound good enough to make your mouth water, in the end, the actual execution matters most. I would rather a restaurant made 1 or 2 burgers perfectly, rather than 35 burgers poorly. Yes, the burgers are big enough to last you 2 meals, but if they aren't cooked properly, who cares? Proper burger cooking aside, obviously the attention to the condiments and accoutrements is somewhat lacking, which results in a final product that is ho-hum and doesn't quite live up to the succulent promise posed by the menu. Based on my experience, it seems like the meals here are somewhat hit and miss, so while there are some burgers on the menu that I'd be interested in trying, who knows what you might get. I have to assume there are better burgers to be had in Toronto (exotic condiments or no!), but if I did come back, I would absolutely stick to beef and see if I had better luck on that front."}
{"text":"After our walk around High Park, Gord and I walked to the Yellow Griffin in Bloor West Village for supper.  They brag that they have over 35 burger to choose from ... so of course, we had to have burgers!  You can choose from beef, pork, turkey, bison, chicken, lamb, salmon or veggie,  After spending the afternoon walking around, my draught tasted good!  Gord ordered the Reuben burger (bison) and onion rings.  He said it was good and would order it again.  I got the Papa Giogio burger (beef) and fries.   It was a good burger and I would order it again.  The fries were so-so.  We sat on the patio ... a great spot to people.   This was our fist time at this pub and we'd go back the next time we're in the 'hood.  The only negative is that people from inside sit on the patio and smoke :("}
{"text":"I've only been here once, but I definitely plan on going back! I had the Le Louvre burger with spinach, brie and bacon. Absolutely delicious. I went here for a birthday party, we had the upstairs for our group. I don't remember what time it closes, but I know some people got there late (around 10pm or so?) and couldn't order food, which I found a bit odd, most places stay open late. There are 35 different types of burger or topping groupings rather. With so many ways to have your burger, how could you not go back to try more?"}
{"text":"I love it when a pub find its niche and stick with it. Sneaky Dee's for nachos at 3am. Crown & Dragon for wings. And the Yellow Griffin for burgers.   There are too many choices on the burger menu and deciding which burger to get is an effort. Which is okay because it will take forever for your server to come. The burgers are big and tasty and I love the variety. But the slow service and the fact that they seem to be on Bloor West Village time and close the kitchen earlier than I'd like means I just can't give them 4 starz."}
{"text":"Been to this spot twice as a meetup I attend is hosted there. Sadly there is a major disconnect between the order taker and the kitchen staff, twice now in 3 months so if its better if your there on weekdays as opposed to weekend *Sunday* no clue. First time the burger wasn't done right, this last time I was pretty loud when I asked that it have no tomatoes, raw ones make me sick on the spot so I call it allergic to, faster than explaining. I watched the woman write it and it came with them on anyhow. The chicken breast was rushed and underdone. Place wasn't tidy, dirty tables and upstairs is full of table/chairs that are ridiculously small. I mean sorry if I wanted burgers on a toadstool I would go to McDonald's Playland - I won't be back."}
{"text":"Walked in on their slowest day last week [wednesday 8:15pm] we only saw about 10 people in the whole place. Nooo server or hostess. But we weren't in a rush...    ...  20 minutes later on standing and waiting to be seated by Noo one?!? EFFF THAT!  We walked out."}
{"text":"I wish I took a picture to show how amazing the food looks and it tastes even better! (and so I could stare at it every night)   I had the Bahama Mama burger with lightly grilled pineapple, with curried mango spread. My partner had the plaughmans. The burgers were so good you didn't need any condiments. You can change up the regular fries for sweet potato for no extra charge! Mind blown! The burgers are so juicy and well cooked without over cooking. As a matter of fact everything was cooked to perfection and the portions were generous.   Really awesome little place. We were headed to the works which we both also love but decided to try something different and I'm glad we did. The waitress was just adorable and very sweet. The restaurant itself was clean and cozy with a nice little patio.  Around $35 for 1 soda and 2 burgers but hey, they were excellent.  Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I went to The Yellow Griffin a few weeks ago and I have been craving another one of their burgers ever since!  When I went I ordered the Le Louvre Lover (it's topped with brie cheese, cooked spinach, and bacon) burger and had it made with Turkey. It was REALLY good! The burgers are huge so I had to take 1/2 home for a very satisfying late night snack! :)  As much as I love all of the options that they give you, it can make ordering a very daunting process! There are 35 varieties of burgers to choose from and when you finally decide on one, you then have to make your meat selection (Beef, Pork, Chicken, Turkey, Veggie, Lamb, Salmon or Bison). If you're as indecisive as I am, I'd suggest looking at the menu prior to your visit so that you'll have your choice nailed down upon arrival. http://www.yellowgriffinpub.com/images/griffin_menu_web.pdf  Awesome place! I will be going again soon for sure!"}
{"text":"If good things come in small packages, the tiny burger pub called the Yellow Griffin is  a very good thing. We turn up in Bloor West Village for dinner regularly and hope there's 4 seats left for us at the Yellow Griffin. What with the endless choices of beef, chicken, bison, lamb, turkey and veggie burgers plus dozens of toppings combinations, not to mention mouth watering onion rings, breaded dill pickles, sweet potato fries and poutine, plus beer or soft drinks, you really can't go wrong. Unless, that is, you want a fancy cocktail.  It's a beer and burger bar,  people, plain and simple."}
{"text":"Normally, I wouldn't consider service in my restaurant rating.  But, the wait was just horrible.  It was ridiculously long (over30min).  The burger was probably 3.5 stars.  The waitress didn't give all 5 of our food at the same time either.  She said that she only gave us half our orders bc we wanted it 2 bills.  We never told her that and we got one bill at the end.  overall, I would not come back."}
{"text":"Well, though whether it is the best burger on Bloor (which it very well may be, it certainly feels close) remains to be seen, but it is quite certainly the most burger anywhere I've been. After opening their menu, I saw these guys meant business, to my absolutely insane delight!  The entire inside of the menu consists of yes, 35 differently-topped and prepared burgers, a selection so overwhelming that I literally couldn't process it. We got down to business when the waitress informed us that the very large party happening upstairs would delay our order beyond the customary 20 minutes (their standard cooking which they warn you about on the menu), if we didn't order ASAP.   My friend was dismayed that there was no goat-cheese-topped option, and while I love the stuff myself, I feel kind of like it's becoming too omnipresent in mid-priced eateries, so that their lack of it almost seemed rebellious. I will give them some creativity points, combining the all-American with the French, Indian, Greek, and Mexican, among others. I also have immense appreciation for the prevalence of Balsamic vinegar, which I can't live without, and yet couldn't have previously imagined being the main condiment on my burger as it was tonight.   Now, if only they had free refills..."}
{"text":"We had to get our own menus from the bar because we were never served them.  We then had to wait half an hour for the waitress to take our order after going to the bar to ask for service.  Had to wait another half hour to be served our drinks after asking and finally another waitress brought them after we asked again.  Waited another half hour for our food to arrive.  I had the big jerk and it wasn't bad but the bun was hard in some places and soft in others.  Waited another half hour when we asked for the bill and had to repeatly go to the bar to ask for it.  Almost $60 for two hamburgers and two beers.  Everyone around us had the same service.  To the right the lady asked for her drink after waiting half an hour after ordering and the waitress said of course and then never brought it.  The couple to the left sat and waited for menus and waited and waited. I advised them they may want to get it themself at the bar and get ready for a long wait.  It seems by the service that they think it is a privledge to get to eat their hamburgers."}
{"text":"If you are in the mood for meat between a bun, and options, then the griffin is for you. I'm never disappointed, but I also do go in expecting much more than a whole bunch of different burgers, some risky, some guaranteed hits. Overall good service."}
{"text":"You may have seen the ads for Yellow Griffin in subway stations across Toronto advertising 35 different burgers, and they're not joking. The menu features 35 (or more?) different options from all over the globe, including The Gringo (my favourite), a Greek option, peanut butter, blue cheese and wing sauce, four cheese, indian curry style, etc.   After you've chosen from the 35 options, you still have to pick your meat (turkey, pork, lamb, beef or veggie) and then a side (potatoes, fries, sweet potato fries, salad etc.). Basically you have a lot of decisions to make.  I always get The Gringo because I love Mexican food and I just think pairing these toppings with a burger is an awesome idea. It's got sour cream, guacamole, salsa and refried beans as toppings. Tangy and really, really filling.  Only three stars though because the service is slow and the servers are rather inattentive even when the place isn't busy."}
{"text":"first impression, the place is of decent size...its not...their might be 20 seats on the first floor...not sure about the second calamari to start which the sauce's for it were bland and weird. gotta be greek with lamb was the burger i picked, which was AMAZING with a sub par poutine on the side. they make the ice tea by hand...which is a bit off, the fries were defiantly from the freezer, same with my friends order of onion rings...but the burger was absolutely fantastic... the menu was a bit of a pain to read and didn't include pricing for the drinks... the waitress was very slow with getting us our bills  would i go again...maybe, maybe not  defiantly a lot of choices with boasting over 35 different burgers to pick"}
