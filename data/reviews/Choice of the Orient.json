{"text":"Ordered a meal for one person, veg fried rice and wings, and it came up to $18.90. Asked if it was for one person, he said. \"Yes that's what it comes up to \". Call me cheap but wow.!."}
{"text":"Just finished a great, three-dish delivered meal, and I have to say, it far exceeded my expectations for delivered Chinese food.  This was not your run-of-the-mill, lukewarm, bastardized Chinese food.  By the same token, it certainly wasn't Morimoto, but neither was I looking for that.  I just wanted some decent, tasty Chinese food, delivered in a reasonable amount of time and at a decent price.   Well... I got that, and a whole lot more.  Starting with the gentleman who took my order, to the fortune cookie, everything exceeded my expectations.  The fellow who answered my call was courteous and knowledgeable and answered my questions easily and happily.  The food arrived apprx. 20 minutes sooner than quoted and was piping hot!  The deliveryman was friendly and courteous, and was quite thankful for my reasonable (20%) tip. I ordered Moo shee pork, peppered squid, vegetable fried rice and an egg roll.  The egg roll was your standard delivery fare.  Not great, but tastier than most and nice and hot and crispy.  But that's where the standard fare left off.  The moo shee pork was tender and moist, combined with cabbage and carrots that were sweet and tender, and tasted as fresh as any I've had.  Cooked absolutely spot-on, and seasoned perfectly.  The pancakes (wrappers) were extremely good, and better than some higher end restaurants I've been in.   Tender, moist and warm.  Large enough to hold a very generous portion of pork and veg.  Nearly see-through, yet strong enough not to tear.  They were melt-in-your-mouth delicious! The peppered squid was absolutely scrumptious!  Perfectly crispy yet tender and cooked to perfection.  A wonderful combination of salty and spicy, not over-bearing, witth a perfect balance in textures.  The best I've had in quite a while! The vegetable fried rice was also surprisingly delicious!  The rice was tender and perfectly moist.  Tossed in were a generous amount of mixed vegetables - julienned carrots so uniform in size, you'd swear they were grown that way.  Mushroom, onion and peas rounded out the mix.  All cooked spot on with just the right amount of seasoning.  Not over-dosed in soy sauce as so many do. Usually, one doesn't expect too much from delivered food, but this dinner was miles beyond what you'd normally find. Two nice little surprises were the side of hoisin sauce for the wraps.  I'd bet it was homemade.   And the wee packet of spicy, Chinese mustard.  I've had it often in higher end Asian restaurants while dining in, but have NEVER had it in a delivery, and I was just tickled to see it when I opened the bag.  An absolutely perfect little touch to the meal! All in all, a delightful experience and I would highly recommend this restaurant (at least the delivery side of it, as I've yet to dine in there) to anyone looking for some wonderfully delicious Chinese food, delivered hot, and quickly to your door, at a VERY reasonable price. I give it a solid 4 1/2 stars for sure!"}
{"text":"Clean white table cloth dinning... food is hot and fresh every time. Pepper Chicken... Cantonese chow mein.... Pepper shrimp...Singapore noodle.. Everything is tasty."}
{"text":"food has always been good here.  never a bad experience.  been here ( least 15 times.  lo mein, chow mein, sweet and sour and egg/spring rolls are very good.  staff is friendly"}
{"text":"We order from here all the time, the food is great and it's very good quality.  Fan of the beef with mushrooms and their fried rice is very light and not oily.  Lots of parking and great service."}
{"text":"Never going back to this place. I have never left a review but this place was horrible. My wife use to come hear when she was growing up in the area, so we decided to give it a go. Tonight we ordered almost $60!! worth of food and all was either tasteless or funky tasting. The Szechuan chicken was very bland, did not have much taste and the chicken itself tasted like it was reheated. The worst was the crispy beef. I kid you not it had a fishy taste to it like they reused a pan they fried fish in just before. The lo mien was bland. Very bland. The chicken with it was tasteless like it was just boiled and packed. And it had a reheated taste to it as well. The tofu was soso but that was because the sauce it was in was almost tasteless. Im glad we got such a variety of dishes so this way we confirmed this place is the worst chinese restaurant in the GTA. No joke. Avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"I dropped in to order takeout. Great food at decent prices for the Woodbridge area. You won't really find a better Chinese restaurant in Woodbridge.  There is a discount if you order over the phone and pick it up. You may have to pay in cash, though."}
{"text":"Tasty, low (or no) MSG in most dishes, clean (food, waiters, restaurant overall).  What else can you ask for?  Keep in mind that this is not your typical Chinese food restaurant.  Food doesn't have as much MSG, and thus the taste is not as intense, but it's healthier as a result.  Other than the intensity of the taste, food is tasty and feels like it has quality ingredients.  Place looks and feels upscale (if somewhat dated), even though prices are quite reasonable and  most clientele is dressed casually."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and the restaurant is nice, very clean. The waiter was super friendly and seemed so happy to be serving us. They have this counter-top on top of their tables that spins so that you can share food more easily with people! Such a great experience there. I had their Shanghai noodles, Stir Fry Beef with Broccoli, BBQ ribs and a bunch of other amazing dishes. I particularly enjoyed their Chicken Vegetables with Almonds! Will definitely be going back and highly recommend!"}
{"text":"All I wanted was some good Chinese food and I'm from out of town. My boyfriend and I stumbled upon this little place asked someone coming out if it was any good. They said \"it's the best in town\" and that was no lie. Excellent chow mein, beef an broccoli, pork fried rice and delicious chicken. As it always is, the next day it was even better all mixed together. Average price, but totally worth it! If I'm ever in the area again, you bet I'll be back.   You're best to call ahead then pick it up, although the hockey game kept my boyfriend entertained while we waited about 20-25 minutes."}
{"text":"I am not surprised that I get first dibs on this Chinese restaurant's review. Apparently it is not even good enough to comment on. Allow me to be the first. The food is forgettable at best. The place gets pretty empty and I tried this place once and that was that. Game over. For a place that tries to dress itself as a high-end resto, the food was mediocre, the service was so-so. Parking was abundant though."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints. The atmosphere is great. Love the white table cloths and service is wonderful."}
{"text":"The food is disappointing, even for americanized Chinese food. I wasn't expecting authentic Chinese food, but when compared with other american-chinese food restaurants, this place is pricey and mediocre."}
{"text":"Best take out/delivery Chinese food in the area period. This place is on our speed dial. They always accommodate and delivery is quick."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from here using Skip The Dishes.  Weak.  Very weak.   Order was Shanghai noodles, spring roll, and Chicken in black bean sauce.  The spring roll was okay.  Noodles were barely edible, but chicken was not.  It was disgusting."}
{"text":"I had a very disappointing experience today. Coming in after reading the reviews, I had high expectations. Everything tasted bland and proportions were super small compared to the many Chinese restaurants I've tried. I ordered a Shrimp Fried Rice, Shanghai Noodles, Peking chicken, Tiger Shrimp, and three bowls of Hot & Sour Soup. This may seem like a lot of items for a whopping $81 but it was in fact not. Peking chicken was basically sweet and sour sauce dumped on grilled chicken. The shrimp although was a fair size, they basically just tossed in with onions over the stove with a pinch of salt, and threw it on a skillet. Nothing I tasted was impressive. Service however, was good hence the two stars, but man I am so upset I came in to pay for an $81 meal that tasted like something I got from Manchuwok."}
{"text":"Excellent supper here. We came because of the reviews on Yelp.   Food was hot and fresh. Excellent variety. Staff was very attentive without being overly involved.   Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Good Chinese food. I like the egg foo yung. Can't get that  in a lot of places and it tastes great!"}
{"text":"Fast delivery had the chicken corn soup - house fry rice and chicken balls sea food lo mein every thing was a 10. Thank u really enjoy packaging is pretty thank u, friendly service"}
{"text":"I came in with a high expectation but was let down. Decor is good but taste of the food doesn't meet my expectations at all. There are much better places around the area to eat, won't look as great but will definitely taste better."}
{"text":"Was ok, but we're not going back there. The soup disappoint us and their tea is not good at all. We got the deluxe dinner for two but i only like the fried rice, the seafood is ok. It is quiet, owners and staff are nice."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in years and forgot how good this place is.. So Great place with upscale feel but very reasonable prices. Awesome staff.."}
{"text":"Decided to check out this place after seeing it a few times while going to Service Ontario in in the same mall. In terms of service and ambience, it's definitely not your typical Chinese restaurant! Very fancy looking with classical music playing in the background. Although it was a weekday afternoon, there were a fair amount of people having lunch there despite the actual mall being dead.  I ordered Chicken Curry from the lunch menu while my sister had Ma Po Tofu. Servings were large and also came with a soup. Although the curry was good, I preferred the Ma Po Tofu more, so flavourful! Overall, the price was pretty fair and we enjoyed our meal. If I had to be picky, I would suggest replacing the fortune cookies at the end with something else like fruits."}
{"text":"This is by far the best Chinese food place we have been able to find in the Vaughan area, and we've been trying.   We've been to the location on Yonge St many times and have always been pleased with the taste,quality and consistency of the food. When we moved to Vaughan we were looking for the same quality and found this location.   Time and again we try other places, but nothing has come close to compare to Choice of the Orient."}
{"text":"The tenderloin with black pepper sauce is melt in your mouth good. The atmosphere and service can't be beat. I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Pretty good fast food. The rice is not that dark brown or extra fried, it's a nice golden colour. Good quality, egg rolls are nice and full. I would order again."}
{"text":"The only Chinese restaurant I will eat at in Toronto...it's The BEST!!!  Incredible food and professional staff"}
{"text":"I am originally from Richmond Hill, but moved to Toronto almost 3 years ago. I have not found a Chinese restaurant that can compare to Choice of the Orient. I absolutely love their food and the customer service is excellent."}
{"text":"Good food, freshly prepared and fast service. We had the sizzling seafood dish, crispy ginger chicken and fries rice, all was great and cooked to perfection, fish was tender, chicken moist inside and crispy outside and fried rice was light and not oily. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"My family and I have been going there for the past 20 years. Excellent service and great food. Portions are amazing and so is the price. Every time I go there I feel at home. Best wonton soup, everything is very fresh. Good for take-out and dine-in. I highly recommend this place it hasn't change at since I was a little girl."}
