{"text":"Cute little coffee shop in Scottsdale. The service is super friendly, the coffee is fresh ,and the food is delicious. They have the best avocado toast!! The portion of avocado is very generous and sooo fluffy. They drizzle olive oil (I presume) and chili flakes to add a little kick. The bread is never over toasted and is sturdy enough to hold the avocado spread without toppling over. It's a great meal to start your day, without making you feel too stuffed. I would definitely recommend Berdena's!"}
{"text":"Visited Berdena's today for the first time and I was so impressed! Loved the interior design and the friendly staff. They use local fresh ingredients for their baked goods as well their beverages. Ordered a latte and I couldn't have been more pleased! I've been to tons of coffee shops and Berdena's makes the best vanilla latte I've ever had!!! Definitely a place you need to check out!"}
{"text":"Berdena's is the best thing that ever happened to downtown Scottsdale. It is the perfect coffee shop - great coffee, the most friendly staff, beautiful ambience, and fantastic food. Jonathan and Grace are the nicest people in the world - I always feel at home there! Thank you for gracing Scottsdale with your existence, you are the best !!"}
{"text":"Really good coffee.   Cute, clean, nice place in an excellent location.   Friendly staff.  So far I am echoing the other reviewers!     For me, the star was the waffle.  Best. Waffle.  Ever.  It was light and crisp and gave new meaning to the term \"melt-in-your-mouth\".     I will be back.  Often."}
{"text":"My first time in and at first I was a little skeptical because it was not what I expected it to be but everything was absolutely delicious and I am especially surprised with how good and smooth their espresso is! (I ordered a cappuccino) i'm a big coffee addict and I must say, it's a big thumbs up for me. Not to mention their avocado toast was out of this world, simple yet tasty.. and their house made waffle? Probably the best I've had yet. I definitely will make this my go to spot when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Cute place in old town with a limited food menu that focuses on a few things done well. The avocado toast and waffles were both delicious and so were the drinks. Vibe is nice, airy and open. Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Guys, there's avocado toast then there's Berdena's avocado toast. I can't even begin to explain the deliciousness. How something so simple can be so darn amazing blows my mind. Just do yourself a favor and go order it. Your mouth will thank you.    I also had the honey lavender latte. It was a perfect complement to the toast. The lavender wasn't too over powering or too subtle. And the honey gave the drink just a touch of sweetness.   One thing this place could do better though is to have a menu. They have a list of their coffees and teas but no mention of food. Had I not known before I got there to order the toast I wouldn't have known they offered it. I'm not sure if they have other food items or not. But now it doesn't really matter, because I will forever order the avocado toast."}
{"text":"Amazing avocado toast and delicious iced chai latte. Friendly staff and airy space. Wonderful place in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! Very friendly & amazing staff. Everyone working here seems so happy to be at work. I felt welcomed & cared upon entering. I walked here every morning for my entire stay in Scottsdale. They have the best Avacado toasts & very I interesting selections of lattes"}
{"text":"Best espresso I have tried in Arizona. Great coffee and I would recommend the avocado toast for breakfast."}
{"text":"I loved my lavender honey latte. The barista was spot on and worked their manual machine seriously. Everything I saw in there was done well- from the aesthetic to the customer service. I'm looking forward to coming back again."}
{"text":"Not much room inside and orders seemed to take a while. Layout is a little odd. Food was great - portions could be a *little* bit bigger; otherwise, really good. Avocado toast and waffles were very good."}
{"text":"This place has amazing coffee, great espresso, and the best atmosphere to hang out or get some studying/work done quietly. Reminds me of coffee houses back in Portland, San Francisco, and L.A. They do have a great vibe there and the avocado toast is done right, more than just the trendy thing to do. The owner is always very inviting and the staff knows a lot about coffee and is very nice.  With that being said the only downer I can claim is that it seems like there's always five or six people working on something but nothing is getting done. Service is a tad slow, and unfortunately, if you're a guy, your drink is going to come after a pretty girl's drink, no matter the order of drink tickets.  Great coffee, wonderful attitudes all around though, great location, etc."}
{"text":"Loved visiting Berdena's today! The space was open, bright, and wonderfully decorated. The cold brew was perfection- love that they brew Ritual Coffee. Staff is friendly and welcoming, next time I'm planning on trying one of the amazing looking pastries. Happy to have this spot in Old Town!"}
{"text":"I visited this place for the very first time today, and all I can say is - I was impressed. A cozy  atmosphere with wonderful service. The owner was patient and friendly and chatted with me while providing great, quick customer service! Great tea, great cookies, great service! I'll definitely be back - often!"}
{"text":"Very clean and such a cute place to meet for a date or a nice morning meetup with a friend. They have a limited food menu, but what they do make, they do very well. I had the waffle which comes with REAL strawberries( not the can or syrupy kind) and powder sugar on top. I also ordered their lavender honey expresso. I will be back. So good and such friendly staff. Not a super filling breakfast, but it was perfect for me and my plans for the day."}
{"text":"Bright, fresh coffee shop in Old Town Scottsdale.   Needed a place to kill some time before yoga class, and Berdena's caught my eye. Small, basic menu with only a couple breakfast options, but the waffles smelled delicious. My iced almond latte was perfect and unsweetened with simple syrup available at the counter (nothing worse than a frappuccino sweet latte). Free wifi (no password). Saw a couple people posted up with laptops, but probably not the best place to park all day since it's a small space. Service was awesome. Great addition to the area.   I'll be back to try that avocado toast!"}
{"text":"This little cafe is so sweet, a good find in the heart of old town. I am pleased to say their avocado toast is off the hook. The set up of the cafe is clean, cute and the barista was pleasant and friendly. It is pretty convenient to get to location wise but I am almost certain that when old town fills up it would be hard to park. Easy access by bike. I can easily see myself coming back to this cafe because their customer service and chill, modern atmosphere are something not found everywhere."}
{"text":"A new must-try! The ambiance embodies Scottsdale chic-  cozy classic design with modern undertones. This inviting establishment is further complimented by its high quality products and sourced ingredients, whether it is coffee or pastries the owner puts tender care in providing a superior experience. Cheers!"}
{"text":"If you are into coffee this is the spot in Old Town. Without question, the best waffle I've ever had. The avocado toast is awesome too. Pretty much everything is solid so you can't go wrong. The owner is super passionate about what he's doing and it shows in the quality. My only complaint is that they only serve waffles on Saturdays. Probably a good thing though..."}
{"text":"I live near Berdena's and my only disappointment is that I didn't discover this place sooner. I love the ambiance and really enjoyed my latte. I wish they had longer hours and were open later on weekends too! Highly suggest Berdena's if you're a coffee fan!"}
{"text":"I would like to keep this spectacular little coffee shop the hidden gem it is and hope it doesn't become too crowded to get into.  BUT,  I have to give serious props where due.  Berdena's is tiny,  maybe a dozen seats inside and another 6 or so outside.  It is very clean and modern,  no frills but great.  They make the best lattes and avacado toast I have ever had,  anywhere!  They also have a random selection of 1 or 2 other pastries each day that are good but the avacado toast is unbeatable."}
{"text":"Giving a 3 stars as the place is nice and so are the people, didn't have breakfast as the only items they offer is very limited; no real breakfast. Just a nice place to enjoy a coffee with a light meal. Give it a try."}
{"text":"Food was so good, it's a simple place with the best service! So worth the 30 minute drive to it! Have the avocado toast!! This place deserves to get noticed."}
{"text":"Their honey lavender latte (I got mine with almond milk) is amazing! Yummy avocado toast, of course. I will be coming back for sure because the people are SO friendly."}
{"text":"What a cool little coffee shop! I went here with a friend and. She thought it was pretty cute and nice. I ordered an iced coffee and it was on a verge of sweet and bitter, which is what i prefer. The atmosphere is small, so hopefully people talking can drown out your voices. It's very quiet in here when I went. The location is also my favorite since I'm in Old town pretty often"}
{"text":"Berdena's makes the best lattes in Scottsdale hands down!  I'm not usually one for a flavored latte because a good bean doesn't need anything but some milk but their honey lavender latte is what dreams are made off. So good I crave them and make the 30min drive from my house just to get one.  Their baked goods from leDinersaur are yummy and they make a solid avocado toast.  It's a great little place to hang out and have a killer latte."}
{"text":"This is a cool, small place. Coffee and food is good. Great for quick, small meal. Baked items are amazing. We had the smashed avocado toast and rice and beans dish. So good. Friendly staff and great concept. We will be back."}
{"text":"I heard about this cute place from my friend and I must say, it's amazing! From the service to their drinks/food, obsessed. I ordered a dirty almond chai, and their granola and berries. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Cute and clean ambiance, great coffee, pleasant customer service, and different cute pastries everyday."}
{"text":"What a nice surprise to find such a cute cafe...! Yummy chai latte to cool off and devoured the best avocado toast I have ever had! Super friendly service, local ingredients, this is a must stop if you have a few minutes!"}
{"text":"So friendly! Get the honey lavender latte and avocado toast. Fabulous, fresh and addicting. Cool vibe, good music. The waffle was the best I've had in years. This place is amazing."}
{"text":"Berdena's isn't as ordinary as it may appear. The food, drinks, and atmosphere are all executed with tasteful precision."}
{"text":"Visited Berdena's today. Wonderful little spot! Loved my coffee and the pastry was  delicious. Everyone was so friendly. Enjoyed meeting Jonathan! And it's still nice to sit outside"}
{"text":"Googled breakfast near me and found myself wandering into this lil gem located in old town Scottsdale. It's more of a coffee shop than a breakfast place, as they only have 3 things on the menu but the Avocado Toast was large and filling! Delicious toast that came on whole grain bread with a side of lemon. I felt very healthy and was not disappointed. Great service as well, both workers were very friendly and outgoing. I can't wait to see what you guys expand to! I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"Oooooh. I have found a new love in Berdenas. It is everything you want in a coffee in Scottsdale. I was hesitant to post about them honestly, because it's my new sanctuary but I must share everything good and bad with the yelp fan!   I work right around the corner, and saw them start posting things online before they opened. As soon as I saw they had opened, I rushed over, only to be greeted so warmly I almost fell over. Sure- it looks like the Pinterest cafe of your dreams, but the coffee is just as good as it looks! I've had almost everything on the menu, and you can't go wrong. They are incorporating seasonal beverages, for summer they had this iced cherry coffee that tasted like a chocolate dipped cherry! It was so interesting and refreshing. They just added a lavender latte which is every bit as good as it sounds.    They added some food items, and my favorite avocado toast in the valley thus far is here! Trust me.   Also.... the pastries! Le Dinesaur, the ninja baker, drops stuff off here weekly. Buy the shortbread if it's there, and thank me later."}
{"text":"I have heard the name Berdena's for a while and wanted to see what this little shop was all about.  Berdena's is a coffee shop with gorgeous white backsplash tiles, fun organic decor and a nice hip place to get a drink. The decor is instagram worthy and a great shot for anything you buy.  The drinks are interesting because they have your typical chais and espressos but they also have a list of specialty drinks as well. I decided on two drinks, the lavender latte and the maraschino cold brew for my husband. I also ordered some of the LeDinersaur pastries as they are one of my favorite pastry vendors in the valley.   I waited 20 minutes for my two drinks and there were two people in front of me. Thankfully I wasn't in a rush but that is a long time for two drinks especially when one is a cold brew. My lavender was alright, I wasn't in love with it but it was still good. It was missing something to make all the flavors blend. The Maraschino cold brew was intense, I mean I took a sip and the bitter bite of the cherry flavor was too much for me. My husband is a huge coffee person and usually drinks his coffee with almost nothing in it. He even said it was bitter and overwhelming. He said it took 4 hours to drink it. I can see the direction they were headed but the implementation just fell short. I figure I will give them another try when they change their specialty drink menu as I feel they are so close to making it. I just hope they can fix the amount of time it took to make the drinks in the future.   There's tons of parking to get to Berdenas and its in a good location. I didn't get to try their food but next time I visit I'll give it a try."}
{"text":"Absolutely awesome! Almond milk latte with the most fabulous avocado toast I've ever had!!!"}
{"text":"Four Stars. I've been going weekly on Saturday since November 2017.  Their latte is not only beautiful when served, but it's also delicious. The award for the avocado toast is well-deserved and it's consistently excellent, week to week.  The waffle is great, too, although might not be the hottest by the time it gets to you (waffles don't hold heat well, in all fairness).  The young men behind the counter are very nice and easy going.  That is where the loss of the fifth star comes in... Saturdays attract many parents of young children & toddlers. Berdena's is small, with several tables scattered about and window stools.  There are some tables outside as well.  Some parents let their toddlers/kids sit on the table while they feed them. Eating at a table where a diaper wearing toddler was just sitting isn't appealing in the least.  I've witnessed other parents who will leave their books/toys/food on the table and step outside to play, leaving some patrons to wander looking for a place to sit & wait for their food/drink all the while the empty but taken table remains.   Plus, it can get loud because the sub-three age group hasn't mastered the art of the inside voice. That said, some parents haven't either.  Others have commented on the service being slow. I prefer to think that's because someone is literally making my coffee/food right then, like at home, and it takes time. I'm okay with it since I know what I'm getting.  The noise level and the trend toward all the little ones running about and the unsanitary practices of parents are a turn off. The owners need to suggest to these patrons in some way that seats are the only places to sit, to please be considerate of others and clear the table if not present, and to corral the little ones.  It's a romper room on Saturday mornings starting around 8:30. Bummer that the missing 5th star is due to the bad manners of some guests, but I believe better monitoring of the tables would solve the issue."}
{"text":"Very very friendly, relaxed and super adorable environment. The owners and staff are so helpful, welcoming and attentive to detail. Real quality and commitment to a great customer experience.  Great place to relax and get work done"}
{"text":"Food was good didn't have much of a selection coffee was also good nice vibe small place a bit too small."}
{"text":"They offer cold-brew as well as hot. The latte was expertly prepared. First coffee shop I've been to in a long time that served a latte ready to drink.  One could tell that the milk was steamed correctly & the pour was artfully done. They offer a few pastries if desired, probably changed daily. I believe John said they're made on site & based on the taste of the crust on the quiche, I suspect they'd be worth a try.  There was a quiche offering today, served with a side salad & a slice of buttered toast. The quiche had thinly sliced pepperoni, whole tiny tomatoes & kale. The crust on the quiche was done quite well; still flaky & buttery. The toast was buttered edge to edge, the side salad was lightly sprinkled with chopped walnuts & perfectly dressed. If I lived here, I'd be a regular. Thank you for a light & delicious repast!"}
{"text":"Berdena's is the kind of place that is easy to love. Charming, contemporary, and in the heart of downtown Scottsdale, Berdena's offers all of the serene luxury one would want from a neighborhood cafe. With the kindest (and cutest) baristas I've encountered in a while, and a menu with drinks as creative as they are delicious, Berdena's instantly makes you feel like you made the right decision. They were also open on Christmas Eve, despite normally being closed on Sundays!! It was a clear gesture of kindness and holiday spirit that was so refreshing to experience.     I tried their winter spice latte iced and it was one of the most unique and delectable drinks I think I've ever had. Flavored with hints of orange zest and rosemary, they make all their latte flavorings in-house which only adds to their superb quality. They also served me my drink in a Mason jar with a candy cane striped paper straw and offered me vegan milk alternatives also made in-house. My friend ordered the avocado toast that I shared a few bites of and was equally impressed.   High quality food and high quality staff. Such a lovely place to spend a Sunday morning!"}
{"text":"Berdena's is a quaint coffee shop with welcoming staff, exceptional coffee, and incredible pastries (who doesn't love waffles?). This is my new go-to coffee shop in Old Town Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Berdena's is a great spot for a delicious coffee and light breakfast, my favorite vacation breakfast. They feature a small weekend menu with oatmeal, avocado toast and granola.  There are also a handful of pastries available to pair with your coffee.  Everything we tried was delicious and I thought the prices were really fair.  If you need a suggestion, go with the granola and almond milk! It was amazing."}
{"text":"I love Berdena's! I consider myself an avid coffee drinker and pro coffee consumer, but I fell in love with Berdena's instantly. It's got the right vibe that makes you want to take a picture every time you're in there. It's bright, open, aesthetically sharp, obviously well thought out and inviting.  Even better, the coffee is delicious. I believe the true test of a coffee shop is ordering their black coffee. They definitely passed because it was a smooth cup without any needing of adding anything. They also happen to carry the best almond milk latte in town!  Now the BEST aspect of Berdena's is the service  the entire crew is above and beyond friendly! They're always so cheerful and excited, and it's contagious! Coming into Berdena's almost everyday is a sure way to brighten my day"}
{"text":"What a cute little coffee shop! I was instantly greeted and helped as I walked in. Staff was very helpful not to mention the coffee is amazing. I have yet to try their food but have heard great things about the avocado toast.. will have to try next time I go! Super cute inside, lots of seating. One of my new favorite coffee spots!"}
{"text":"I've never been a huge fan of avacado toast... until now! Berdenas is literally the best I have ever had. The espresso is super smooth, but not overpowering when I went they were using a seasonal blend from Honduras. I got an iced  vanilla late. If you need an upscale place to get work done, just hang out, or grab a snack. Check out berdenas! It's definitely a new favorite"}
{"text":"Almond latte!!!  Soooo yum!!!!!    Now for a pastry!  Such a lovely welcoming place!  The first few sentences were from my first visit. Now, I'm a regular. Whenever I'm in town I need to stop by and get a fix! This is a can't miss coffee place!  Such a calming, but energetic vibe here!  If you are in Old Town, treat yourself!!!"}
{"text":"They're all right, the avocado toast is the best I've had. At $6.50 it's not exactly cheap. Add $4 for my fancy black tea and my breakfast was $13 with tip, and I think I'm still hungry. This is a cute, small, place that takes their time doing stuff right. There are a couple other food items I'll be back to try."}
{"text":"Such a cute and quaint, place! Great place to get quality coffee and a good snack. They also collaborate with other local small businesses which I really appreciate about them!"}
{"text":"Delicious coffee and a beautiful atmosphere. The owner is very friendly, as are all of the staff. The Winter Spice Latte is incredible!"}
{"text":"I love Berdenas!  They have the best quiche ever!  The avocado toast is amazing!!  There coffee is great too. No disappointment over here."}
{"text":"Loved this place. The avocado toast which I'd read was wonderful did not disappoint. All in a friendly and comfortable atmosphere. Four sta8lty6s rather than 5 because menu is limited."}
{"text":"Love this place, it was so quant. I worked out across the street, and this cafe caught my eye. After my class a friend and I went over to grab a coffee. I got an iced latte and it was delicious! I loved the fact they supported locals, the milk was from Danzeisen, and the pastries were from a local bakery. Can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"Tried Berdena's for the first time this morning. It was amazing. The decor was great the coffee was even better, and both employees ( a guy and gal) were very friendly. I had the almond milk latte and it was perfect. I would definitely hit up this new gem in old town if I were you!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here since they opened and typically don't write reviews. But it's worth letting everyone know how great the coffee and food is. The waffles. Oh my."}
{"text":"A weekend tradition of mine! Every Saturday morning starts at Berdena's! Amazing coffee, you can tell they know what they're doing! Also, the avocado toast!!!! This is the best thing to happen in Scottsdale.. little dramatic... but so true. It is delicious! Perfection! The whole vibe of the place is also very cool. Clean, no fuss, yet artistically designed. Love it!!"}
{"text":"Great coffee spot in Old Scottsdale.   The pastries are fabulous with a cappuccino.  I must try if you're strolling through old town or on your way to work."}
{"text":"I ran into this place on our exploration of Old Town and had to go in. It's a beautiful space with all the modern and simplistic decor.   The first visit I just wanted a cookie. The chocolate chip walnut isn't just a cookie. It was absolutely divine. If you love cookies as much as I do, I guarantee you'll love their cookie. Shoot, Try the other creations too. Don't think you'll go wrong with anything.   The next visit, I intentionally went there on our walk back to our Airbnb bc I had to get a latte. Y'all, they have honey lavender. It was soooooo good. Like totally craveable.   I highly recommend this coffee shop if you want exceptional service, a nice spot to chill after shopping or just need a break, and all the feels.   Love the orange table and chairs outside too. Like I said, this place has modern vibes. I think you'll love it and it quite possibly might become your favorite."}
{"text":"Great baked goods and not to miss avocado toast make this a wonderful place for a breakfast bite. The specialty latte was a miss the day I was there, but such is life. The staff are friendly and very attentive. Seating is limited."}
{"text":"I'm a coffee snob and not apologetic for it.  If I buy beans for a great cup, I will have them shipped in.  That being said I can honestly say I have had the best macchiato ever at Berdena's.  In addition, the people who work here are knowledgable and super nice!  The pastries are wonderful and the waffles are light and beautiful compared to the thick heavy typical kind.  We had their lavender cappuccino special today and I can say that they were able to pair flavors that really work with an already great espresso bean."}
{"text":"Berdena's is the cutest coffee shop to grace Scottsdale in some time! It's so cozy with impeccable decor, and the staff is amazing! They are SO nice - they've really done a great job of attracting an incredible team.   I experienced their delicious avocado toast because we've ordered it at work, but it took me a while to find time to come in during their hours (they close kind of early on week nights and have very limited hours on weekends).   This Saturday we finally made it in. I enjoyed an Afghan Chai with cream and honey and it was delightful! I wanted to stay longer to order an avocado toast and maybe a coffee, but we barely made it in before they closed at 2:00 for the day, so I just enjoyed my chai.   This week we ordered some avocado toast and yogurt parfaits for the office. I love their granola! It has dried blueberries in it, and a really amazing depth of flavor. We've also ordered their quiche, which was perfectly cooked and just so delicious. I look forward to enjoying their quiche next time I can make it in.   I also LOVE that they have pastries from Le Dinersaur! So delicious. You can really tell that they pay close attention to detail when creating both their drink and food menus, using only the best ingredients. It's a good reminder that food doesn't have to be complicated to be delicious.   About the hours.. I love to go sit in a coffee shop in the evening or on the weekends to nosh and have a tea or coffee while I work on my computer, read, or just relax. I was so excited to hear that a great coffee shop opened in Old Town, only biking distance from me! But it has taken me months to make it in because of their limited hours. I really hope they extend their hours so we can enjoy Berdena's amazing avocado toast, yummy chai, and delightful coffee whenever we want :P"}
{"text":"The food and ambiance here is rad. The people working here are incredibly nice and accommodating. I especially love that they serve LeDinersaur here now! I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Adorable California-feel, small coffee/ breakfast spot. Limited menu included avocado toast, waffles, rotating quiche and bakery items. They are known for their avocado toast so I gave that a try... the bread was toasted perfected and delicious. The avocado was topped with a sweet/salty glaze. Overall it was filling, unique & made with quality ingredients. Only thing that would make it better is if there was a fried egg on top of it. The drink selection was fun featuring some floral beverages. The lavender honey tea was too sweet for me but true to its flavor. Earl gray tea was great. I wish they had larger drink sizes. Will definitely go back there!"}
{"text":"First time in and loving the very cute and friendly atmosphere here!!! The coffee I got today was Honey Lavender Latte! The settle after aroma of the lavender is nice, try it out if you can!"}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best coffee places in all of Phoenix. The honey lavender latte has been said to be \"the best latte in the whole valley!\" The shop is simple, clean, and modern with a modest sophistication. The only bad thing about Berdena's is that it's not nearer to us."}
{"text":"Yum Yum yum. Amaze balls. Is tomorrow too soon to come back? Best avocado toast ever!"}
{"text":"Coffee and Waffles are amazing. Menu is pretty limited"}
{"text":"One of the best coffee shops I've been to. Got a delicious quiche breakfast and an amazing cup of coffee for less than $13. I live on the east coast, but next time I'm back, I'll make a point to spend some more time here. Great stuff!"}
{"text":"I love lattes and more than that, I love a good espresso bean! Berdenas is brand new to old town, and it is fantastic! Was able to speak to the owner today, and his passion for good ingredients and quality is evident. It's nice to see someone with so much dedication and passion in their business! I also tried the avocado toast this morning, which was tasty and toasted to perfection! The latte was smooth with a heart on top. Barista was extremely friendly. This place is brand new, and for 3 weeks old, it's doing awesome! I'll definitely come back to visit! Awesome shop guys!"}
{"text":"Truly a breath of fresh air. I like this coffee shop for their nice atmosphere and great customer service. Their avocado toast was tasty and delicious. Latte had a nice smell and taste so good. With so many coffee shops around, its nice to drop by a new location from time to time. Worth telling to friends about this one."}
{"text":"The service is excellent! The baristas are friendly and upbeat. I appreciate that they hustle to get your drink finished quickly. The avocado toast is out of this world! I could eat it daily. I don't....but...I could!"}
{"text":"Excellent little cafe near old town! We thoroughly enjoyed our breakfast! The latte with honey was perfect and the quiche was light and airy. My wife had the avocado toast and also loved it. This is a must stop if you come to Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I love the tres Leches cupcake here! The right amount of sweetness and cream and walnut on the top. I am not a big sweet person but that cake was so delicious. Everything here is done with quality - from the decor to the pastries to coffee, it looks amazing. I would say come early though because we showed up at 2PM and almost all of the pastries were gone.  The coffee was super strong and too potent for me but my boyfriend is a coffee lover and he loved it."}
{"text":"Believe the hype.   I was visiting the charming Old Town Scottsdale area because I wanted to hit up some local coffee bars and after a less than stellar stop at the nearby Cartel Coffee, I found Berdena's. It's tucked away and a bit tricky to find, but I'm so happy I decided to stop in.   The unassuming little coffeehouse is small with just a few tables. There aren't any sofas or fluffy chairs with that \"please hang out for hours\" vibe, yet I noticed several locals hanging out and working on laptops or listening to music. In fact, the locals were super friendly while I was an obvious visitor, they even chatted me up.  The super cute and friendly barista welcomed me in and offered to help me with the small menu. He made several suggestions and told me all of their specialties (including hot tea and avocado toast), but when I settled on a boring cappuccino, he gave me the warmest smile and said \"it's always a great choice to go with the classics.\" Swoon!   He also talked me into the special baked good of the day, a tahini chocolate chip and sea salt cookie for $2. This cookie -- oh my god, it was full of salty, buttery goodness. Not too sweet either, and the chocolate chips were incredibly delicious. I loved this cookie (although it didn't really look as tasty as it actually was).   When I got my coffee, I was shocked at how unbelievably gorgeous it was. No, really. Look at my photo: there's no filter. This was taken my me, an average photographer at best, with my iPhone's camera. The picture looks like a professional shot it because the cappuccino was so stunning and Insta-worthy. I almost hated to drink it because LOOK AT THAT BEAUTY!  The cappuccino tasted as great as it looked and was worth every penny of its $3.50 price tag. I love an establishment that takes great pride in its product, and this was one of the most beautiful coffees I have ever been served anywhere on the planet.   There are a couple of minor negatives: they only have real sugar and no artificial sweetener (I know fake sugar is blasphemous in the world of artisan / Third Wave coffee, but some of us have health issues that mean we must use Splenda or Equal), and as others have reported, service is very slow. Although I was the only person ordering, it took nearly 15 minutes for me to get my cappuccino. Great coffee art takes time and I appreciate that, but make note that this probably isn't the best place to come if you're in a rush.   I absolutely adored everything about this place, though. There's zero pretension and it's not a place to hang out all day -- it's all about the coffee."}
{"text":"A friend recommended this place for me, and I was glad that I checked it out.   I Ordered their Quiche with salami which was cooked to perfection. The edges are little crispy and the inside was soft and yummy. It also came a side salad and a butter toast. THAT BUTTER TOSAT BY ITSELF IS WORTH IT. It's simply delicious.   About half an hour or so after I had that meal, while I was talking to the barista, he offered me to check out their white tea then I ended up ordering one. It has a very smooth and subtle flavor that I very much enjoyed.   The atmosphere is clean, minimalistic, and inviting. While it's a small coffee shop I was completely comfortable staying there for hours getting some work done.   Overall, I had a positive experience and I will be coming back for sure. If you're in the area check it out."}
{"text":"Two words: avocado toast! You wait a little bit to get your coffee and food,  but it's worth it. Simple cute shop with a few menu items that are all yummy!"}
{"text":"This is a fantastic and friendly stop off for a great and unique cup of coffee. I went with my friend for a quick breakfast and were delighted to find unique concoctions such as a honey lavender cappuccino and a spicy chai latte. Everyone was super friendly and the food, while limited in options, was excellent. A delightful surprise for what we just thought was going to be a quick stop off."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this amazing place by accident and I am so glad I did. I love their tea and have yet to try their food. I will be back to do so though. The atmosphere is perfect and I love the look of the space. Really nicely designed and decorated. Nice place to take a friend or to have a meeting."}
{"text":"Love my daily spot! Absolutely the best avocado toast I've ever had. Their quiches are always delicious and include toast and a side of berries. Their cappuccinos are consistently perfect. The whole team there is friendly. It's very apparent that they care about the quality of all of their ingredients and love what they do."}
{"text":"Way.. overpriced. Good coffee and the food was pretty good as well. But it did take a long time to come out. There's not many places to sit either."}
{"text":"I never leave reviews, but this is a worthy exception.  I found myself traveling for work in Scottsdale.  This spot was an oasis in terms of the food, staff, and ambiance/decor.  Simple menu, but everything was done perfectly (breakfast of champions: avocado toast, fresh oj, and cappuccino).  All of the staff were knowledgeable, enthusiastic, and genuinely really friendly. I went back twice during my stay and would have gone every day if time allowed.  Really wish I could take this place back home with me."}
{"text":"What a cute little spot off 5th Avenue in Oldtown Scottsdale.  If I hadn't eaten breakfast at my hotel, I would totally have had the quiche and avocado toast.  I had an almond milk latte and my daughter had her crave, an Americano.   Both perfect.  We sat in the window seats to people watch before we had to head to the airport to go home.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I had an awesome experience at Berdena's! I ordered an iced Dirty Chai with Almond Milk and it was absolutely delicious. I also ordered the avo toast... I can't exactly pin point what it is that makes it so good, but it is probably the best avo toast around! The staff was nice, location was hip & clean. All and all, this is a great place to sit outside, get some work done, and grab a coffee and bite to eat! I'm looking forward to my next visit here."}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast, coffee, and work spot in all of Phoenix. The staff are the friendliest you can find and always make you feel at home. The avocado toast and waffles are to die for!!!! I would 10/10 recommend!!!!"}
{"text":"Berdena's is a lovely spot to do some Ber-dining! The space is airy with lots of light and there is a little area outside with seating in addition to indoor seating.  After reading some other reviews I figured I'd get the most popular items they are known for: the avocado toast and honey lavender latte.   The avocado toast was overall really good. The bread was a perfect light toastiness and there was a plentiful amount of avocado on it, with some chile flakes and sea salt. The only real criticism I had about the toast was that for me the salt flakes were too large so in some bites I didn't get any salt but with others I got salt overload.   The honey lavender latte had a perfect balance of lavender flavor with light sweetness from the honey, and the espresso was rich and smooth. I'd definitely get this drink again!  Service was friendly and polite."}
{"text":"Solid coffee program. Friendly staff. Small but thoughtful selection of food was simple and very flavorful."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place.  Amazing coffee and delicious pasteries by Le Dinersaur!   Really loved the people watching-- there is a crossfit gym across the street and I love stuffing my face with quiche while watching people doing crunches in 110° heat."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a cold brew and a slice of avocado toast - so simple but it is amazing what happens when ultra ripe avocados mash it up with olive oil with crush red pepper sprinkled on top of artisanal toast.  Friendly staff & well worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Blueberry muffin is good! I want to try the avocado toast next time."}
{"text":"Best coffee shop!!! Amazing coffee, tea, and the food is made fresh and original. I'm Addicted to the avocado toast. Staff is always friendly and super cute!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times now, and every experience has been amazing. Their avocado toast really is the best in town and they always have an interesting and different latte available. Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"This is definitely a cute little coffee shop.  They were actually out of food when I visited except for a few pastry items, but that was OK by me, as I came in for a drink. If you need their famous avocado toast, I'd suggest coming in early or you might be disappointed.  I had a chai tea latte. It had good flavor, but it could have been a tad warmer. If you like your beverage on the hotter side, be sure to mention that to the barista.  There is a seasonal menu for specialty drinks on the counter, so you'll want to check that out.  I watched three different baristas when I was there sipping my drink and reading my book. They were all friendly and happy to be there.  Not a lot of seating options, just tables and chairs and a few outside too.   Overall, a good experience."}
{"text":"When you walk into this minimalistic cafe in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale, you will quickly notice their limited menu.  Don't let that steer you away!  Berdena's waffles are perfectly executed from a batter to a tasty, garnished treat.   I've been eyeing the avocado toast, but most of the times I've been in it's for the waffles and my tummy can't fit them both.  Don't have an appetite? Grab a coffee to go and enjoy a walk in Old Town."}
{"text":"This place is super cute and serves great coffee. I have only been here once and I ordered the lavender latte. The only complaint I have is that I ordered it with almond milk and they used regular milk; for $1 extra, that was really disappointing. I can't have dairy so I traded with my friend whose did come with almond milk, so it was fine, and the latte was great with both types of milk. It's pretty expensive but I am willing to spend ~$6 on a good drink."}
{"text":"Seriously need more places like this. I love the feeling of a small, personally owned coffee shop with little snacks and delicious drinks. I'm hooked!"}
{"text":"Can't recommend this place enough. We are only here three days and I want to go back! Beautiful interior, such friendly staff, and amazing pastries and avocado toast!!! The coffee was of course amazing too!"}
{"text":"First time only had pressed abacado toast but - great service, best abacado toast I've had"}
{"text":"Berdenas is hands down my favorite coffee shop around.  They serve great coffee and amazing food!  I love honey lattes and theirs is the best in town.  Their avocado toast is my go to weekday pick but their waffles, served on Fridays and Saturdays, are a weekend treat I look forward to.  Employees are always friendly and the shop itself is so clean and cute making it the perfect spot to grab a coffee with friends or get some work done on my laptop.  Thank you Berdenas!"}
{"text":"Definitely not a breakfast place but you can certainly.play pretend. At three food items on their menu, it more closely resembles a cute cafe that tries very hard to aspire to a clean friendly hang out spot  across from a busy gym.  I would say that this place oozes \"yuppy\" vibes with its niche and the well constructed avacado toast, no fancy flourishes but certainly fancy compared to small dinky hipster cafes.  I would say this place is fun if you are pretending to write  a book and need people to see how profound and cultured you are as they watch you type away on your Apple Airbook (tm) while sipping coffee and munching toast.  Don't let this detract from the fact that this is a fun place to go to recharge and plan your weekend :)"}
{"text":"Simple spot and limited menu but man was everything great. I will dream about that vanilla latte in days to come. The saddest moment was when I saw the bottom of the cup and still tried to get another drop out. Avocado toast was delicious, great bread huge amount of avocado. We also go the ham quiche which came with big chunks of ham, two pieces of toast, and a little dish of berries. Hidden gem for sure...would it be crazy if I go back in for another latte right now?!"}
{"text":"This is a cute little coffee shop! I ordered a lavender honey latte and a quiche. Both were yummy! Beware it does get a little cramped since it's a smaller space!"}
{"text":"Well...it may be good avocado toast but our wait was ridiculous. 25 minutes!!  And we heard others tell us this as we arrived. But it's toast and quiche that has to be reheated!!! How does that take 25 minutes?  We watched every other customer experience the same wait and/or mixed up orders. Crazy, given the simple menu.  The food is good and the ambiance is lovely...they just need to work on the service."}
{"text":"I don't have enough good things to say about this place. The coffee selection is unique and the quality is amazing. The workers are always extremely friendly, kind, and willing to answer any questions you may have. I've also never been disappointed by the food I've gotten here. I was hesitant to buy avocado toast that was $7, however after tasting it I will gladly pay that much for toast that good."}
{"text":"I was super looking forward to Berdena's. It's located in Old Town Scottsdale. I  understand they're still fairly new, and think they have some potential, so please take my review with a grain of salt. I ordered the iced filtered coffee. It had bourbon in it and had a fruity flavor with hints of cherry and limeade in the brew. I had it black; it was good on its own and I enjoyed it. The staff was nice, and I ordered an avocado toast in addition to my drink. The avocado toast is where they have room for improvement. The toast was filling, but overall, pretty bland, and it did not do anything for me, flavor-wise.  In addition, the aesthetic of the café is modern and clean. I don't mind cafes like this but sometimes for me it is a fine line between feeling like you are in a septic tank vs. a modern space. For me, Berdena's walks that fine line as it seems like the thing missing most from their café is character. What exactly is it that sets Berdena's apart from other cafes? Sadly, I'm not sure, but I do hope the staff figures it out soon, there's a ton of other coffee places here in the Valley."}
{"text":"Lovely little spot. Had a delicious almond milk latte here, and my husband enjoyed a great drip coffee. We didn't have any of the food, but it looked tasty. Clean shop, nice music, kind staff. Definitely will go back."}
{"text":"Love this place and the coffee! Always top notch service when I go and the coffee is so rich in flavor. One of my favorite little coffee shops!"}
{"text":"I'm not much of a reviewer these days but people need to know about Berdena's! My friends agree that you can't find a better avocado toast in town. The toasted bread is thick and crispy enough to handle the heaps of avocado and seasonings without ever getting soggy (and sometimes I reallllly like to take my time eating it). I overheard someone praising the waffles as \"so light and fluffy\" and saying they didn't feel like they over ate. They have free wifi and the beautiful, clean design lends itself to a nice work environment. There aren't a ton of tables so I would just be cognizant of others who want to eat. There's a counter eating area and a few outdoor tables as well!"}
{"text":"A friend of mine showed me this place recently. Their lattes are amazing and I always seem to run into nice people at Berdena's. I wish it was a little bigger of a coffee shop but they do have seats outside as well.  If you are in Scottsdale and need coffee give this place a try."}
{"text":"I am so happy this coffee shop showed up on my Yelp Suggestions! A friend and I wanted to grab a Thursday morning brunch, and decided Berdena's was just the place. Parking was a breeze on 5th, and the weather was perfect! We ordered a vanilla latte almond milk latte and avocado toast. So yummy! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Best oat milk latte I've ever had!!!!! Traveling from jersey and there was nothing like it."}
{"text":"Really wish we could have tried the two drinks we ordered, but the barista was rubbing/picking his nose while preparing them. He did wipe his hands on a cloth next to the coffee machine, but then went back to rubbing his nose a few more times. There were a lot of people in there so we didn't want to make a scene... just threw the drinks away and wasted $12"}
{"text":"The wife and I stumbled upon this good looking, recently-opened coffee shop selling Ritual Coffee from SF. Coffee was delicious, the design was clean and modern, and the staff was friendly. We didn't try the pastries but they looked amazing. Wish they were closer to home so we could visit more often."}
{"text":"Fantastic service from Sid and delicious coffee.  Vibe is very cheery and a really nice addition to old town.  Have to try there waffle on my next visit- everything is made from scratch and a very simplistic but fresh and delicious menu.  Thank you for such a great start to my Friday!"}
{"text":"I am a barista at another specialty coffee shop in the valley, and this is easily my favorite shop in Scottsdale. I've been in twice (would have been more, but they're closed Sundays), and both times the coffee, pastries, and tea have been absolutely on point. The food is phenomenal. They serve waffles on Saturday, and they're easily the best waffles I've had.  The owner is a delightful Costa Rican fellow, and he and his staff have incredible energy. Highly recommend this shop."}
{"text":"Love Love Love this place . Hands down the best avocado toast I have ever had in my life ! I drive all the way from Tempe to get it . Cute little loca shop amazing food and coffee\"s and teas !"}
{"text":"Instagrammers, this will be your new favorite spot. The decor is so clean and photogenic, it made me want to go get the new iPhone just so I could use the camera in there. The staff is friendly, and overall there is just a great vibe. It's a small space, so seating it limited. But it's worth it. The drinks are original and delicious. The honey lavender latte, OMG. So Good! Not to mention the food options. I tried the avocado toast, and it was almost too perfect to eat. But, don't worry, I did. And it was amazing! A cute, original, great place to meet a friend or just enjoy the views of Scottsdale. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I'm from CA, and the avocado toast here is fantastic. Also a great value at $6.50. Waffle is amazing, latte was a work of art. If I lived in AZ, id move close to B's and eat here every day."}
{"text":"Such a wonderful little coffee shop, more like a family experience than an actual business. Barista was top notch and the coffee is of the highest quality, not to mention the freshly made pastries. Out of this world!"}
{"text":"Simple and good, I only give them 4 stars as they need to add some mixes to their menu. Coffee great, avocado toast is very high quality, almost too much avocado to be honest. Cinnamon rolls some of the best we have ever had anywhere. Cute place"}
{"text":"OMG! Love this little gem! The lavender latte is my absolute favorite. Oh! And don't forget to share the avocado toast with a friend! YUM!!!"}
{"text":"The cold brew and the blueberry scoop/cake thing was to die for. So happy to have another great coffee place in Old Town!"}
{"text":"Ok you Ninety Plus fans, (you know who you are if you know what that means) this place has a convenient location with easy parking most early mornings.  The most important thing about this place, apart from the nice decor, the modern finishings and the cleanliness is this: they have Matahara, from Ethiopia; it is one of the absolute best beans ever grown.  Absolute perfection.  They have whole bean or will ground it for you no problem.  They ground Matahara for our recent vacation to Hawaii.  That's right: you read that right:  we took ground Matahara to the land of coffee because it is THAT good.  Try it!"}
{"text":"Small, quaint breakfast nook with a good atmosphere and good coffee. Limited options for food, but we ordered the waffle, quiche, and avocado toast and all three were fantastic! Would definitely go back next time we're in town"}
{"text":"Excellent coffee. Small place. Good for personal time or meetings with a few. No major line. Kind of hidden but that's what makes it great. Love the cups. Good hold on the handle.  Like quiche?  Come here for a balanced breakfast. Nice vinaigrette blended salad with savory quiche and buttery crunchy toast. Makes you smile."}
{"text":"This place is adorable and their coffee is amazing! I got the honey lavender latte and it was SO good. The presentation is great and the staff is very knowledgeable about all the products. The staff is also super friendly!! Old town has needed a cute coffee shop and this is it!"}
{"text":"The coffee gets 5 stars !!! Great job on that but everything else was useless !! We waited 15 min for them to put a cinnamon roll on a plate and 20 min for a yoghurt!!! Meanwhile the guys were too cool to give a shit !!! I ll not go back there"}
