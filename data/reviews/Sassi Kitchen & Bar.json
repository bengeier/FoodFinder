{"text":"Went for dinner with friends last night. The restaurant is decorated absolutely amazing!  The food was excellent. We ordered the mushroom risotto and the filet steak.  Both were prepared perfect, and the waitress suggested perfect wine pairings for the food. We will definitely be going back here for dinner!"}
{"text":"Overall, I do like this place. In terms of decor and a change of scenery in calgary I think it's great. My biggest issue with Sassi is the staff. Every time I come here, I hope that the service will be better, but I keep running into the same issues. It can take a while to be greeted at the door, sometimes it takes a while for the servers to come to take your order, and the level of service during the meal can be hit or miss. 
Last Saturday we dined here and there were little things that happened where you could tell the servers weren't very professional, I.e. After our entrees came out, the server brought our cutlery and placed them up against our plate, partly hanging off our plate and the table. Then the knife would slip a bit (why did you place it here to begin with?) and she would try to make it sit against the plate.... Then, nobody ordered wine and when our mains arrived and the table was tight, she didn't think to clear our empty wine glasses to make room for us....There were times during the meal that I had to find her to ask for more water... eventually we got a pitcher which was great but why did I have to repeatedly ask. 
At the end of the meal, she apologized on how slow she was during the course of our dinner and proceeded to tell us that she was so overwhelmed because it was a busy night..... it was a typical Saturday night and the restaurant wasn't fully packed. 
I want to like this place, I really do. I want it to survive and do well in mission because there are some positives too. I just wish they would focus on improving the level of service and maybe put the servers through some basic training.  My only other thing would be the menu items. It's nice when a restaurants changes the menu (or just a few items) from time to time. Often times their \"specials\" are items from the main menu!! That defeats the whole purpose of a specials list."}
{"text":"A group of 7 of us went here for a friend's birthday. The decor is really nice and the ambiance is cozy and chic. The menu is definitely on the pricier side and we decided to share a bunch of appetizers. This is where a decent experience turned not so good. Our server had a major attitude problem to the point where I didn't want to order anything else. I've served so I get the upselling piece of the job however, this was like a used car salesman and it made everyone at the table uncomfortable. I was teetering on ordering the calamari but wasn't overly hungry and no one else really wanted to share so we just decided to go with fries to munch on. Our server was like \"um really... So only one order of fries between the three of you\" in a very snarky manner and we responded \"yeah we are just kind of picking at things\" and she then proceeded to push the calamari on me relentlessly. Not how to make your customers feel comfortable. The rest of the night had the same tune. At the end of the evening we were ready to settle up and just got everything on one bill to split it up ourselves (because she didn't) and as we were ready to pay she said \"so you can just tip on top of that\" and \"there's a tip option on the machines\". We are well aware of this feature and it was again in poor taste to even bring this up at the table. We were all taken aback. Needless to say, I don't think we will be back. The food was good but the service gave us a very bad taste in our mouths"}
{"text":"Can't see these guys lasting in the competitive restaurant industry in Calgary. Overpriced, poor service, no attention to detail. Save your dining dollar for a worthy restaurant like Charcut, The Nash or Shokunin (right next door)."}
{"text":"Terrible service and terrible food. The owner is very rude and refused to compensate us for our food."}
{"text":"Def not going back.  Capers were stale in the beef carpaccio and the clams in the spaghetti were so fishy and not fresh.  Nice ambiance but the food lacks."}
{"text":"If you like it real.  Great kitchen. Great wines.  Great servers and management.... Really classy place.  You'll love the elegant touches!  I come here all the time...."}
{"text":"Food was great, service was great and the ambiance was very nice. My wife and I will deffinetely go back again. We had the charcuterie board for appetizer, very nice. My wife had the zucchini pasta with red sauce and I had the Osso Bucco. Both meals were great and the portions were plentiful."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for a while now love it used to go down the street before, Sassi is much better owner chris and Mary are real people they really take care of customers a bit price  but like I said earlier much cheaper than the expensive place in mission .I recommend everyone that's looking for a good place to go to Sassi you will not be disappointed.way to go Chris and Mary"}
{"text":"Had lunch here very nice ambience had a 14.00 Mojito mint leaf wilted black at bottom such trashy quality Charcuterie was a complete wreck could have had a better one at Walmart meat that should have been in the garbage THIRD rate not willing to say food do not eat here you will leave and feel completely disappointed"}
{"text":"It's nice place for small group of hang out. It's little bit dark And cold. (Heat was not enough ). Appetizer we had lamb lollipop, bacon wrapped dates and risotto deep fried ball(it's not the name on the menu). They are all good and great portion. You might feel it too cheesy for the risotto ball. Entrees are decent and not as wow as appetizer. Decent I strongly recommend Greek yogurt cheesecake. You won't disappointed."}
{"text":"Excellent food & service!!
Disappointed that the $27 pasta dish had only 3 shrimp in it. Everything else was amazing!"}
{"text":"Better than anticipated! Read up on the mixed reviews so wasn't sure how it would go. Went for a girls dinner and found the decor nice and different and perfect for a night out. Food and service were really good. Had cocktails and the pappardelle calabrese, crab cakes and lobster and shrimp ravioli. All of us were happy with our food. Would return! Also the menu has changed from what is posted on here in photos, see Sassi's website instead."}
{"text":"5/5 for food. Everything is homemade here and the pizzas are made to order with hand stretched dough. Proper thin crust Italian pizzas with very generous toppings. Saw the table next to ours ordered the charcuterie board, which looked amazing. Pasta is also really really good.

5/5 for service. The manager really cares about its customers and takes the chance to greet them when she can. Service is friendly.

Posh decorations with marble and pastel colors. Gets busy on Fridays but noise level is still kept at bay. (And may I say the bathroom smells so good!)"}
{"text":"Really great place to come for a  meal out with the girls. The decor is very pretty. I had the kale appy and lobster ravioli.. both delicious. Everyone meals were amazing. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Walked in the first time and thought I'd stumbled into a movie set. After asking about the food with the front desk waitress, a fairly tall super made-up older 'model' came over, announced that she was the owner, and could she help. I took one look at the high-nose attitude that she exuded, and after making an excuse, I left.
The second time I thought I'd check it out afresh, but before I could get into the food side of the place, the same puffed up blond-haired woman appeared. Her ostentatious demeanour again turned me off too much to even consider sitting down, let alone ordering.
There won't be a third time. 
I am not sure why some owners can't recede into the background so that those of us who don't consider ourselves 'elite' aren't put off by attitude. Now I read that the food is only so-so, so nothing much missed. I think that some places along 4th consider themselves a step-up from 17th, Kensington, and it shows. Certainly this place does!"}
{"text":"This place is great! Beautiful decor...and very comfortable. Employees are very friendly and the food was delicious! I had the caprese salad (the added pesto was amazing!) My friend had the eggs benny, which was also very good. And honestly, it was just regular drip coffee, but it was one of the best cups I've ever had! Will definitely come back, looking forward to trying more of the menu! The only thing I found unusual was that the worn paper menus really took away from the otherwise beautiful atmosphere."}
{"text":"First of all what bothers me is that I don't know how to pronounce the name of this restaurant.. Is it sassy (used in a sentence: the sassy personality matched ...) or is it pronounced saucy. What bothers me even more is the fact that the friend that when my friend that I went for lunch with today and I asked our waitress how the correct pronunciation is the server did not even know... how is that possible??? 
I liked the decorations and atmosphere of the restaurant. Everything was very white and black with oldies but goodies as in modern but very Marilyn Monroe and Elvis Presley. I also like that they have a long brunch hour in the day from 10:00am - 3:00pm. What I did not like is the fact that it is a Saturday and they only have two servers for the whole restaurant- a guy and a girl- therefore, it took us a long time to be seated as we stood at the front for a while until we were eventually told to find a seat anywhere, then it took a long time to get menus, a long time to get our order taken, the for came fast thankfully but then a long time for the table to get cleared for us to pay so when we were asked if we wanted dessert or coffee we said NO! because who knows how long that would have taken. 
On a positive note, the food was delicious! 
I will have to give this place another chance to see if I get the same service or not :)"}
{"text":"I popped in for breakfast on a Saturday. The atmosphere looked promising, and the service was excellent. Sadly, the food was unappetizing. It is difficult to screw up a simple breakfast: scrambled eggs, toast, bacon, and potatoes. Nothing tasted fresh, and the quality was equal to a diner two blocks away for half the price. It is unlikely I will eat here again."}
{"text":"I love this place! It's so pretty and decadent inside. My friends all loved it too, now it's our weekly brunch spot. The food is fantastic, especially the lattes, $5 mimosas on the weekend, and the staff is great! Love this place"}
{"text":"I have mixed feeling about Sassi. The decor is super swanky, like a five star hotel bathroom lol. They have white/grey marble tables, marbled lined walls, French style bird cage chandeliers and French chairs with dead celebrity throw pillows at the couches..(wtf?) 

The menu is weird and expensive. I don't really know what cuisine they're trying to go for? 60% Italian and 40% gouge-you-on-everything-else sounds about right.

I had the Maria pizza (proscruitto and arugula) and it came out on a board in ONE BIG PIECE. I saw a pair of scissors on the side and I asked Jeff, our server, why they don't slice the pizza like normal people. His response  was, \"we want you guys to explore your pizza.\" (Wtf?) 

The crust was light and crispy but edges were too crunchy. It wasn't too soggy and they were generous with the arugula. 

Jeff was a great and attentive server but I got the feeling the restaurant in general was suffering from an identity crisis. I don't think I'd be back again with so many better options in the area. I'll still give it 4 stars cause the food, service and ambience were all decent."}
{"text":"Beautiful place, however the food very disappointing . The salad was not crisp. Felt like it was expired. The beauty of the restaurant does not hold the same standards for the food. Unfortunately"}
{"text":"Great food, service and environment. My server here was super kind, accommodating, and funny!"}
{"text":"Terrible experience, the food was very disappointing.... Feedback given to the owner was not well received. It seems they are trying to be an upscale restaurant but can't quite get it right. Rethinking the laminated menu would be a good start."}
{"text":"The space is beautiful! It's really sleek and modern and you feel like you stepped into an episode of Sex and the City. The food is good depending on what you order. I went with a large group and the overall consensus was \"meh...\" I was the only one who ordered something that was really good: chicken liver pate as a starter and gnocchi as my entree. For me, I had a great food experience, but everyone else felt their food was just ok. Nothing special but very expensive. Everyone had a taste of my dish and agreed it was excellent and wished they had ordered it, but I think when you're in a group of 13 people and only 1 of the 13 thoroughly enjoyed their meal...indicates to me that the menu may need improving.

Where Sassi did shine was their desserts.  The salted caramel chocolate brownie, the butter cake and the flourless chocolate cake was DELICIOUS. So I'd recommend this place for drinks and dessert, but perhaps avoid dinner unless everyone orders the gnocchi! 

Service overall was good. He was friendly and attentive. Some issues arose around billing, some people were charged for items they weren't responsible for and he was reluctant to remove from the bill. In the end he accommodated. Like the meal, there was mixed reviews on how the group found the service. 

So my personal experience was nice but seems to be an inconsistent experience with others."}
{"text":"Ambiance was great and the service was good but the prices for the food are quite high. I had the shrimp pappardelle in a rose and sun dried tomato sauce with mushrooms. It tasted fair and the shrimp were cooked perfectly but I have had better seafood pastas and at a $29 price tag (three large prawns), that was steep. My date had the beet salad and that was $18. Way too much for salad with no protein."}
{"text":"My wife an I made a last minute reservation on 11/13.  The owners greeted us at the door with enthusiasm.  It is clear they want to succeed.  The wine list is short, but chosen with excellent taste.  The hummus was our selected appetizer and I must say it is the best we've had in Calgary.  I had the veal chop and I give it a 10 out of 10.  The veal jus was so good I continued to dip my vegetables in to savor the wonderful Rosemary flavor.  I look forward to returning and believe this place is the best we've found on 4th street.   
   The only reason for me not giving this 5 stars was due to my wife's dish.  She ordered the Pappardelle Calabrese.  The sausage had a seasoning that gave the dish a fishy undertone.  I like seafood so this didn't bother me, but the wife was not a fan, but still ate the dish.  
   Bottom line, great people own this and the food is great aside from the one dish.  We will certainly be back."}
