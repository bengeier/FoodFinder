{"text":"Newest coffee shop in town but quickly has become a favorite.  Homemade baked goods, excellent sandwiches and wraps, and of course great coffee and coffee shop type drinks.  Open longer than the other shops with great breakfast sandwiches. Check it out."}
{"text":"Wonderful atmosphere. The food is made to order so it takes a little bit but it's great. The full sandwich combo allows for you to get a sandwhich, soup or salad, and a drink for about $10. The Morgan's Muenster is fantastic. They have a different soup every day. The best soup they have is the French onion soup. The dressing on their ceaser salad is fantastic as well. Every month they have specialty drinks which is fun and give you something new to try each month. Not too pricy and very good."}
{"text":"Good sandwich and coffee shop, a nice stop when touring Madison, IN. The coffee was dark and robust. The sandwich I had was called The Mainstreet Melt. It had turkey, Canadian bacon, smoked Gouda and mayo. Served with chips and a pickle. It was toasty, melty, deliciousness. A friendly clean atmosphere wrapped it up."}
{"text":"My fiance and I came down to Madison for a long weekend getaway. We love Madison! Stopped in this small coffee shop and had lunch..Delicious!! Would recommend this coffee shop for some good food! Very nice people who work there."}
{"text":"This coffee is delicious!! I am an avid coffee drinker and I couldn't not drink my iced americano in 3 minutes-do yum!  They roast their own beans and their passion shows in the flavor.

Going home with some beans and will definitely be back when I visit Madison again.

Also super friendly staff and knowledgeable about java-thanks!!"}
{"text":"Cute little place. I enjoyed a relaxing lunch and afternoon working. The food was ok. Wasn't anything to scream about but it was pleasant. I also had a cinnamon roll. It was a bit grainy and because it was heated in the microwave, it got hard pretty quickly. I was pleased with the friendly staff and cozy atmosphere and would definitely spend another afternoon here, just probably only with a drink next time."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was cozy and warm. I really enjoyed the look. But, whoever the barista was made awful drinks and was rather rude. Took forever to get the coffee too. Paid 20$ for some terrible coffee that none of us drank. It's sad because they had this awesome older lady there when they first opened up and she made some bomb ass drinks. Blah. Go to Red Roaster, their super chill and actually care about your experience.

I usually don't write reviews often, but this place... nahhhhh."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast sandwiches, gelato, and of course great coffee.  As the 3rd coffee shop in downtown Madison I was worried it would have trouble finding enough customers.  It is different enough and good enough to draw a health crowd.  Nice but rustic sitting area with mismatched seating but a good hangout."}
{"text":"Great Coffee shop in Madison, IN. It's always been hard to get a great coffee when I visit family in Madison! No more, I found GH Coffee, and it was great! A fun little cafe/coffee shop, I had a soy latte and a regular coffee on my visit, also ordered a veggie wrap which wrapped a smile on my face cause it was great! 
As far as layout they have a nice room solely dedicated to seats and tables and it's very comfy! As well as a few tables in the coffee area/entrance..
The staff was super nice, ladies one day and a rocker the other who I talked about touring with! All in all good stuff here! Well done GH!"}
{"text":"It's a cute cafe with plenty of seating and a nice sidewalk patio. The bf enjoyed his cappuccino, however, I got a cinnamon roll and it was unfortunately dry and the filling was super grainy, even after being warmed up. I'll try a different cafe next time we are in town."}
{"text":"Cozy spot to grab gourmet coffee and the best cinnamon rolls you'll ever have. My husband loves the homemade poptarts.  All of the bakery items are made in house. Friendly service and comfy chairs and couches to relax with friends - a great addition to Madison's Main Street!"}
