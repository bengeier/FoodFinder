{"text":"The food here is just superb! Both for lunch and for dinner.  Combos are good deals and come in a wide variety. I highly suggest their steamed seafood as they always seem to get it spot on without overcooking. Stuff from the wok is as good as I've had anywhere else as well. Service is decent, but the food is what I come for."}
{"text":"It was the looooongest wait for our steam fish.. a full hour!!  We kept seeing all the dishes arriving to the table next to us including a steam fish...those people came at least half an hour later than us!  We had to ask three times where about our missing fish.  It's not even busy time, many empty tables."}
{"text":"Ordered steamed spareribs at this place. It was 80% fat and 20% tough meat that I couldnt even bite through. Keep in mind this was pork, not beef. Also took ridiculously long to arrive. Its healthy because there's really zero flavour. If you didnt add seasoning to your cooking Im sure you could cut down a lot of calories too."}
{"text":"Steam Kitchen changed owners, so name now changed to Steam Legend. Same staff, chefs, and menu. 

Good place to get Chinese food that isn't overly greasy. The food isn't very consistent though, and depending on which chef prepares the food that day can be better or worse. We order the short rib with pumpkin a lot and sometimes the sauce is thick and creamy, other days it is like water. The majority of the time, the food is good, but on those days when the food isn't quite as good, I should see which chef is working that day to know when to go somewhere else on those days.

Also, the quality of service is quite inconsistent. I find on days when we order the expensive seafood and special dishes, we get fantastic attentive service. But on days when we go cheap and order a simple meat and veggie dish, I find the service is noticably worse and we have to specifically ask to get the complimentary daily soup and ask multiple times to get water/rice. 

I also don't like the fact that they make excuses about the credit card machine not working (can't imagine it takes 2 years to get the thing fixed). If you don't want to accept the card to save on transaction fees, just put a sign up that says cash only clearly on the front door. Then people know ahead of time what to expect and can avoid a potentially embarrassing situation when they are short handed on cash. 

But overall, I still like coming to this place as the majority of the time, the food is quite good and the service is acceptable... And I always have cash just in case..."}
{"text":"Tried this place last night and i was pleasantly surprised that it was home style Guangdong food. Tasty but also felt healthy.

It was busy on a Friday night and I really enjoyed the sesame chicken. So moist and juicy with the savory geung cheong. Second place was the apple marinated beef ribs, slow cooked and infused full of flavour.

If you are looking for nice home style canto food, give it a shot."}
{"text":"It's a good place to get some different types of Chinese food in Richmond Hill. We ordered a steamed rice with shrimp, sesame chicken, mixed vegetables stir fry, steamed eggs and a stir fry noodle with seafood. The food was great with good presentation and taste was amazing as well. 

However, just like other typical Chinese restaurants, their service was horrible. Servers were unfriendly, even the owners were not up to par, no thank you or aknowledgement to customers whatsoever. Honestly I'd have given this place a 3-4 star if it was for their nonexistent customer service."}
{"text":"The food was good, price was great for quantity and partially quality. We got one of the sets that was ~200 that fed 7 people comfortably. As with Asian restaurants in this area, service was sub-par but still better than most."}
{"text":"Pro: very friendly owner

con:Too much msg in the food, it gave me an upset stomach for the whole night"}
{"text":"Its northern chinese style food but specializes more on the seafood part. Can be pricey because of just that, but their food is less oily than most. Decor is nice but that means that the price drives up just to subsidize that. 

Can be nice to take a family"}

{"text":"The star rating gives the average yelper scrolling through a bad outlook on the restaurant. My family comes here often and we quite enjoy the food. I find that the service is pretty much the same as any other Chinese restaurant, not too shabby but they're not overly excited to serve you. 
Tip: there's an entrance from the underground garage at the back of the restaurant. It's like walking through the service area and out the back"}
