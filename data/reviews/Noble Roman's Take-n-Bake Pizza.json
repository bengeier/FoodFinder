{"text":"Just went here for the first time! There pizzas are beautiful! The food is delicious. the staff was wonderful! All around great place!"}
{"text":"The staff was super friendly,  and had good service. This was our first time getting pizza from here. Good prices. Unfortunately the pizzas were not that great. Not enough sauce and the sauce that was there was bland. Crust was pretty tasteless. Just average at best, was hoping for better"}
{"text":"i went there thinking they had FRESH ingridients, when the lady brought out the crust it looked a bit dry and stale. she thossed it in the trash and tried another, then explained to me that the ingridients are shipped from indianna...for 15 bucks i got a pizza that i could have made a better one myself with boboli crust and cheese from albettsons.i wont go there again i make better pizza myself"}
{"text":"Eh.  This place isn't worth the hassle.  The sauce is good but everything else is pretty blah.  No better than frozen pizza from the supermarket.   The breadsticks were terrible.  Tasteless."}
{"text":"The staff was very friendly except the owner/manager guy.  He was obnoxious.  He handed me a stack of coupons and asked me to hand them out to all of my friends who will get free breadsticks for coming in.  I bought 2 large pizzas and 3 salads and handed him one of the coupons.  He refused to honor it for me.  Let me get this straight, you want me to advertise for your business, but I get nothing?  Okay, here is your free advertisement.... the pizza is bland and the dough is tough."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite local take and bake pizza joints. It's close and a great price. We are regulars."}
{"text":"Warning this pizza is literally not cooked. Being out of town we googled pizza place and this was closest. The website never mentioned it was literally not cooked pizza and the worker never mentioned it on the phone. Why did it take them 15 minutes to not cook me a pizza?  Really I want to know.  She kept mentioning to me it'll be really fun well it's been fun making fun of this place.  Next time go with digiorno."}
{"text":"Another one bites the dust this pizza was really good when I came here several months ago the manager was really cool store was clean I got the thick crust and it was very very good unfortunately today I pulled up and there's nothing left inside of the store but a counter unbelievable"}
{"text":"All around great experience. We were greeted by staff welcomed and helped ordering our pizzas. Our family has been papa Murphy's take and bake customers since 1997 and we were leery of others but my wife and I agree that this summer noble Romans will be our new family favorite! The sauce was flavorful and the ingredients fresh Mgr Kevin from Indiana really was an informative touch. See ya soon guys the pizza was \"WOW\""}
{"text":"Just bought a medium pizza what a waste of money should have gone to the Thai place next door the medium is so small. 7 eleven pizza is better then this $10.50 for a \"medium\" the guy working there looks like he hates his job he kept telling us that the pizza was only to take home and bake yourself. We just had a craving for pizza should have gone to little caesars. the pizza  was not good at all I was very disappointed  who would open a restaurant that only does half the work and you have to take it home and finish it. Overall if I could rate with 0 stars I would have DON'T GO HERE spend your hard earned money somewhere else."}
{"text":"Very generous on toppings always very friendly the thin crust is amazing and easy to follow instructions to make a great pizza"}
{"text":"They offer gluten free crust. I like how the crust is not chewy. I usually eat gluten free and the crust taste great here. Staff is super friendly. Definitely will come back again."}
