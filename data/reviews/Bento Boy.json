{"text":"Unbelievable. The pork softbone beats a lot of ramen places for sure. Portions are great for the price. I can see this place turning into a full restauraunt very soon. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Stands out in the plaza ! Bento box choices are Excellent for quick lunch ! Quality and portion sizes  are outstanding ! You can eat your lunch keeping it under $10 !
Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Great food, a hidden gem inside a plaza you don't expect to have such quality food! I ordered the ramen, the soup was hot and flavorful, and the pork soft bone was juicy. My wife had the curry katsu rice, the curry was not too spicy and very tasty, the katsu was fried perfectly and the meat was juicy as well. The garnish was good, overall good price with good portions, I would go again."}
{"text":"First off, I must commend Bento Boy on their choice for their wooden chopsticks supplier. These come prepackaged as 2 separate round chopsticks rather than the flimsy always-breaks-apart-unevenly type which always ruins my eating experience as it puts me in constant fear of being immortalized on youtube as the guy the stabbed himself with his chopsticks while eating ramen.  

Now on to the food: good portions, flavourful soup and ramen still a bit chewy (not overdone) are always good descriptors for ramen, but top that with soft, meatty, soft bone (pork) rib on top for ~$10 (tax incl.) and you've got all the makings of a tasty and filling lunch.

My only gripe (if you can call it that) is the sizes of the pieces of the soft bone ribs aren't consistent -- sometimes I get one large piece + one medium sized piece and sometimes two medium sized pieces. Which is supposed to be the standard? Am I supposed to be \"just full\" or should I be \"stuffed\"?!"}
{"text":"I'll give it 5 stars, in consideration that its a fast food restaurant.  If you compare its food to other places, it doesn't keep up, but, the prices are reasonable, drinks can be included to meal at a low cost ($0.50 for coke), and the serving size is enough.  Not only that, its served pretty quickly too.  Food comes out good, and consistent, and i dont ever really feel like i'm not getting my money's worth.  

The only downside to this place is the location.  Parking can be annoying, and the food court's seating area is rather depressing.  But there is always room, and surprisingly clean.  If you want something quick, and you want something thats is japanese theme thats not sushi, this is a good place to go.

I tried a few different things here, and it has been all good.  Just dont come here expecting authentic ramen, or perfect food.  I personally think they are a great place, and will continue to come back."}
{"text":"Very clean and good quality food. Ordered the bento box with soft bone pork and it came out just like the picture.

The lady taking orders was very friendly and service was great. 

Will definitely come back and try some of the other dishes."}
{"text":"One of my favourite place to visit whenever I want a value meal, without spending too much money on something filling. 

This place is tucked away at the Food court of the Shoppes of Parkway. You can either dine there at the provided seatings or just grab it to go. 

Two of my favourites are the beef striploin and the chicken steak bento with their teriyaki sauce. Portions aren't the largest but it is more than enough for a filling meal, especially that it's only $8 for the protein, rice, veggie, salad and spring rolls. 

The services of the owner is also exceptional and is always very attentive of the customer after they have received their purchased meal."}
{"text":"If you want the bang for your buck, then this place probably nails that perfectly. The place is located inside a dying indoor Asian mall and the food court looks to be the only thing alive.

I got the curry pork bento and the chicken karagae. Both were pretty good for the price you pay. However, there just wasn't that wow factor that you get when something jumps out and surprises you. 

The karagae was seasoned and tasty but given with the wrong sauce. It was given with sweet and sour when I'm more used the the mayo sauce. The curry bento was overall decently tasting, just wished I could mix the curry and rice together (bento box separates).

Come here for a quick and tasty meal for cheap!"}
{"text":"Overall - 3.5/5.0

With the recent reviews given to this new food court establishment, I decided to give them a try to see how it is.

I ordered the Soft Pork Bone Tonkostu Ramen and overall it was a decent bowl of ramen - although their take on ramen is more towards an HK fusion style. 

Soup Base - The soup base was piping hot and creamy. Its flavour profile is similar to Sansotei's broth but not as complex. 

Noodles - The noodles had a decent amount of chew but slightly under portioned compared to the amount of soup that you get. 

Toppings - The soft pork bone meat was done very nicely and super tender. The soft boiled egg was perfectly done with a runny yolk. The vegetables however seemed very out of place as they appear to come from a prepackaged frozen vegetable medley (carrots, broccoli and corn). 

I think they can totally elevate this bowl of ramen if they used more relevant vegetables (i.e. seaweed, sprouts, enoki mushrooms, pickled veggies etc). I know the vegetables they picked are intended to simplify their operations and cost but these little things really do have an impact on the overall impression on the food you're serving."}
{"text":"I ordered the curry pork katsu bento box and the portion size was very generous. The pork katsu was tender. The yellow curry had a bit more flavour than typical Japanese curry. For $9 including tax, it was certainly a great deal!"}
{"text":"Bento Boy is located in a food court on the first floor of a commercial building. I know people who work around this area are always eager to try new places for lunch and my office happened to be just across the street. 

First time visit was a recommendation by a colleague and I ordered the infamous Soft Pork Bone Tonkotsu Ramen. The portion was great I gotta say. Last time I ate at some so-called ramen place when I had to order extra noodle just to fill me up and I'm just an average eater and it costs me almost $20 but here I got the same portion around $10! The soft pork bone was really good and meshed with the soup very well. The ramen was al dente and I personally liked it the way it is.

Being a ramen fan I got to order another ramen today and I chose the Pork Katsu Tonkotsu Ramen. The pork katsu was fried nicely it was tender and crispy unlike some B class restaurants' pork katsu that gives you a thick, hard and bad oil taste from their reused oil. 

Besides food, I think the staffs were very happy and warmhearted. The young cashier lady was really helpful when people have trouble choosing from their menu and always kept her smile on and the chef knew and enjoyed what he was doing. 
Also the kitchen was very bright and clean and this gave me a lot of trusts eating in a food court.

I'd definitively recommend the Ramen here and I'll try their bento box next time. If you have any questions regarding their menu don't be shy to ask!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best value meals in the area. The bento box includes your choice of a pretty large selection of protein/sauce combinations and also comes with rice, potato salad, spring roll, and veggies. I've tried the soft bone pork and chicken with curry and both were winners. They get a bit backed up sometimes so better to call ahead."}
{"text":"3.5/5

Came here around 7:30 on a Wednesday night, which probably explains why it was so quiet. Ordered a pork katsu bento while brother got the soft pork bone ramen. Service was extremely friendly and attentive! The bento had a good amount of pork and rice, with corn, spring rolls and some vegetables as sides. The katsu was fried well and the sauce was not overpowering. Didn't try the ramen myself, but the portions seemed good and broth was alright. 

Wish the bento could have been a bit hotter when served and the pork in the ramen was less chewy, but otherwise it is definitely a value pick when considering its location in the food court. They also have a daily special (2pm on) with karrage + fries (and fish+fries?) for $4.95, and drinks for $0.50.

A good budget option for those looking for a quick meal."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with a friend. Bento Boy is located inside a food court, so I had low expectations, but I was pleasantly surprised by the value! 

I got the pork katsu bento box for $8.80, while my friend got the soft pork bone ramen for $9.90. The pork katsu bento box came with one generous portion of pork katsu, a bowl of rice, broccoli and carrots, a spring roll, and a cold corn salad. The pork katsu was perfectly breaded and tasted delicious. The soft pork bone ramen came with an abundance of meat, ramen noodles, and an egg. My friend was surprised at the portion size and said it tasted amazing. His only complaint was that the pork was a little too fatty. 

There was quite a number of customers during lunch hour, but the food court was pretty empty, as most people took their orders to go. Bento boy is definitely worth trying if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I came back today to try their soft bone pork tonkotsu ramen. It seems they've really listened to their customers and replaced the mixed veg with black fungus and corn which are more authentic ramen ingredients. I got mine with extra meat for $2 more and it was SOOO worth it.  Honestly, I could eat a whole tub of that soft pork bone cuz it just melts in your mouth and has so much flavor.

Let's talk about the components. The meat is super succulent (and strangely, I could see myself wanting it more than authentic chashu in my ramen). The egg is done properly (runny yolk). The soup base is still an authentic tonkotsu and tastes really good but maybe slightly less complexity as the kingpins (sansotei, ryu's, isshin, santouka, etc). The noodles were not bad. I still think sansotei serves the best ramen noods but it's an ez thing to improve on haha. As a whole, my bowl tasted awesome. Get extra meat and you'll be full. Trust. 

Overall, I'd still have to say sansotei's ramen is the best in toronto (because of that little bit extra complexity in the broth and their noodles) but these guys do a great job, nevertheless.

Value-wise in terms of ramen? ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE. A bowl of ramen with extra meat and extra noodles at sansotei would EASILY cost me upwards of $15. I got a bowl here with extra meat (no extra noodles) and it came to $12.45. And the best part is, I was actually full. I'm starting to think the extra chashu at sansotei is a giant rip-off tbh. Customer service ALWAYS friendly and cheerful here. Love it.

Anyways, I think this place has found a loyal customer in me. It's a pity they close so early on saturdays though (6pm)."}
{"text":"Tried the pork katsu tonkotsu ramen. Broth was decent (creamy and smooth) and noodles had reasonable amount of chew, but was disappointed with the toppings: only a few pre-frozen vegetables like broccoli, cauliflower, carrot coins instead of more authentic pickled veg or sprouts. Pork cutlet was nicely fried: not too greasy, well seasoned, crunchy outside and moist inside. 
Very friendly staff. Just not sure I'd make the trip back since the price is only a few dollars less than a sit down ramen joint and here you get your noodles in a plastic bowl with plastic cutlery."}
{"text":"I got the Soft Pork Bone Tonkotsu Ramen for take out. I love how flavourful the meat is! It came with lots of soup and I'm happy about that! Saved it to eat with rice xD I've tried the Chicken Steak Teriyaki Bento Box before this and it was pretty good too. Good pricings and great tasting food! I'd definitely come back to try their other items!"}
{"text":"Bento Boy is the only place where I can get something that I love to eat, and that is a monopoly they have on me because I don't know anywhere else to get it!

I'm talking about their soft pork bone ramen! Man, the meat in this meal is so tender and comes loaded with soft gooey soft bone and collagen. This is absolutely delicious and delightful in texture.

It also comes with an egg cut in half with its yolk running out onto your noodles. I'm not sure what the soup base is (tonkatsu?) but it's the non-clear type which I tend to favour.

Their karaage was light, crispy and flavourful. I like to take a few bites here and there while eating the ramen to get a contrast of tastes and textures.

Drinking a nice cold Nestea is like a fresh cold blast of iced tea, giving a similar effect to ginger with sushi. Cleans the palate well and then eat more ramen lol (it's so sad that I have this all figured out)

As others must've mentioned, Bento Boy is in the plaza with the Sheraton Hotel and The Host restaurant. Watch out for crowded, diagonal-type parking spaces in the lot.

I'm salivating while writing this, so I'll be visiting Bento Boy again in the near future."}
{"text":"Food: 2/5     Service: 5/5     Atmosphere: 1/5 (food court in a run down mall) 

Ordered the chicken karage bento box with curry sauce on the side. The portion and the presentation looked good. However, after tasting it, the food wasn't all that special. The presentation of the chicken karage reminded me of \"popcorn chicken\" because of the way that it was cut. But it was not flavoured well, it just tasted like salt was added. I also got a latte for $1 extra which was a good deal but again nothing special.

I probably won't be returning to try the other items. Parking here can be a mess too."}
{"text":"I came here because I saw all the positive reviews on yelp and decided to give it a try. I'm very impressed! 

I ordered the pork soft bone and the Japanese style too sirloin. Each bento is around $8-$9, and if you add 50 cents you get a can of pop. The total for both combos came out to a little over $19. 

The pork soft bone was very delicious and it melted in my mouth, and the sirloin was tender savoury. 

Would definitely come back tomorrow or any time. The service was great, the food came out fast, and the portions were huge too! 

100% recommend to try!!"}
{"text":"Went to the foodcourt looking for Thai food but then that owner/staff? Was kinda hiding at the corner so end up trying bento boy.
I must say I was pleasantly surprised! 
I ordered the curry pork cutlet bento box ($7.95) and one chicken karaage with fries ($4.95, not the bento).

I was surprised by the presentation and portion given it's located at the foodcourt. It's served on a black plastic tray rather than white styrofoam. And it feels so clean and well presented.

The pork cutlet was quite thick, curry was a bit spicy not like the sweet Japanese type but it still tastes good. On the side it comes with a fried spring roll that is piping hot (store bought tho), the corn+fake crab salad was a bit bland and the broccoli was a bit overcooked. But these don't really bother me since I love broccoli and fake crab meat.

As for the chicken karaage it was pretty good as well. 

I could almost give a five star if it can offer a free small drink that comes with the bento. 

Also it looks like it has a machine so I think it accepts credit card. 

Will come again to try other bentos."}
{"text":"Before I get into my review I just wanted to point out something that a few other reviewers have noted.

Bento boy is a little food court stall in the Shoppes of the Parkway mall. If you are not staying in the Sheraton, work nearby or heard through word of mouth (I found it through Yelp) you more then likely would pass this place by. I know this place more for the Host then its food court, but was pleasantly surprised by this place.

Having said that I am really not sure why other reviewers would compare this place to an actual full sit down ramen noodle place. You really can not compare a food court to an actual sit down restaurant. Also, other reviewers noted that its only a few dollars cheaper then an actual sit down. It actually is a few dollars more + TIP on an actual sit down.

Having said that, this place for what it is definitely gives you bang for your buck. Im not one to specifically seek out food court food, as usually they are notorious for being underwhelming. But for what it is, I think that this little food stall does have the potential to take it to another level (sit down restaurant) if they kick things up a notch.

For only $7.95 you get your choice of a bento box (soft ribs, pork katsu and chicken karaage to name a few options) or $8.95 for a ramen bowl. The bento box includes a small potato salad that is not overpowered with mayo, you can actually taste the potatoes with just a small hint of vinegar, some veggies, rice and a spring roll. The spring roll did not taste overly oily like other food court food out there. 

The ramen bowl was tasty, but felt a little bit undervalued given the variety that the bento box offers. 

When I first came here, I had heard about it through Yelp. My first visit was on Saturday which unfortunately they had closed early as they had apparently sold out of everything by lunch. No matter I still made the trek back as I had really wanted to try this place even more now since I was denied the first time and it was well worth the visit. I first called ahead to make sure that they would be open around the time that I was thinking of going and was greeted by a very perky friendly girl. This same girl was also there when I arrived. While I was deciding to order the girl was very nice in talking me through what they offered, and the various options. I had mentioned to her how I had paid a visit before but they had closed early that time. She instantly apologized and explained what had happened. She also offered a side of chicken karaage to make up for the fact that they closed early on a Saturday. This in itself speaks volumes of the ownership. I have been to much more expensive sit down restaurants where I received far less courtesy and service then this little food court stand. 

My wife and I ended up getting a bento box, ramen, poutine, and the chicken karaage. For the price that we paid (~$25 in total) for a dinner like this, you honestly can not compare to a full sit down restaurant for the value that you are getting here. 

I wouldnt recommend this place for a large dinner party obviously, but if your looking for a quick bite with a few friends I would not hesitate to recommend coming here and giving this place a try. Its quick, pretty tasty, and good value. An excellent little place that I would definitely visit again for a quick bite.

You really can not go wrong, but of course keep your expectations in check.

I will definitely be back soon. As my wife liked the ribs so much, she actually asked if they just sold the ribs on its own (which they do!).

The only suggestion I may have for them is to possibly offer some more \"sides\" with the ramen bowl. As the bento box includes a spring roll, some veggies and potato salad. while the ramen bowl just came on its own. It may make it more appealing if they were to include a small side of the potato salad or spring roll with the ramen. Or alternatively maybe include a small bowl of their ramen broth with their bento box. It gives the best of both worlds really then with a bento box.

I really hope that they expand their menu in the near future with some more creative combinations. I had heard they offered \"curry fries\" which is very very tasty sounding. Sweet potato fries and chicken wings would be good. Skewers of veggies, meat or deep fried squid would also be welcome on the menu. Tempura as well, but these are just a few ideas Im throwing out there.

I look forward to coming back, and hope that they continue to grow and expand. They are after all only 2 months old, so lots of ideas!

Bonus is that they accept credit card - a lot of places in this food court seem to take cash only."}
{"text":"First time ordered food from this restaurant and I was satisfied with the food. It was above average quality for the price. I ordered through SkipTheDishes for delivery and from this app I knew that this restaurant exists. I ordered braised pork bone bento and it was a good portion and it was delicious. My colleague ordered soft pork bone ramen and she said it was tasty too! The pork was very soft and we got 3 big chunks for each of us. We also ordered a side of chicken karaage and they were pretty good too. We're very full from these. We're sure going to come back again and try different dishes!"}
{"text":"Bento boy is really great.  You wouldn't expect they serve great ramen from a food court but I must say it taste better than most ramen restaurants that are around.  Their prices are a lot cheaper as well.  Another must add is their fried squid balls, it reminds me so much of the ones that are in Taiwanese night market.  I highly recommend this to everyone and definitely will visit again soon!"}
{"text":"Ordered lunch again and called in for pick up. It was ready in 30 minutes,  we ordered 13 bento boxes. The lady on the phone sounded very nice and accomodating.When we went to picked up the food...guess what,  she gave us free karaage and spring roll. 

This time I had the fried fish bento box but requested curry sauce on the side. Taste real good!  Really love this place! Good service and Large serving at very affordable price."}
{"text":"Was in the area today and stopped by the ever dead mall that is Shoppes of the Parkway.  

Didn't get a chance to see what was good but decided on Bento Boy and boy was I glad I did!  Didn't know what to choose so the guy working suggested the Braised Pork Soft Bone Ribs Bento Box as it was their most popular meal. 

Okay as a disclaimer I normally don't like pork ribs that much.  Yes I'm weird but I'm more of a beef rib kinda guy but these ribs were fantastic!  Tender, savoury and flavourful with the highlight being the soft bone cartilage.  Not only does it taste great but its great for my future arthritis when I get old!

Overall really enjoyed my meal here and will come back next time to try all the other items on the menu.  Great job!

4/5"}
{"text":"Really great pork katsu here. The sauce is really good and not overdone either! Eating for two will cost you around 20 bucks. Keep in mind this place is in the food court of the small mall next to the hotel."}
{"text":"The service was great. The girl at the counter was so sweet. I had the soft pork bone bento and it was delicious and filling. The meat was so tender it doesn't require too much chewing. It was an amazing value too and I can't wait to come back and try something else."}
{"text":"Everytime I come I have to order the pork sparerib ramen. Cheap and good and fast. The soup base is very good and sparerib is so tender and cooked so well!"}
{"text":"I can't say anything bad or even worse about this place. I had it once when my company suggest should trying and it was the bomb. I have tried it many times possibly 4 times now and every time it is the best. I had the Japanese Sirloin strips and the chicken teriyaki. The poutine and the chicken Keragi is amazing. I will try the soups out next time. Price is right and you can never go home hungry! I will support this restaurant as long as it is there!"}
{"text":"Update : 
Just ordered myself another set of bento this time I tried the Chicken Karaage with the curry sauce on the side . Though they forgot to put the curry sauce to the side it was okay because the dish all came together like one YUM !!! Belly and Pocket satisfied !!
****

Worth every bang for your buck! For under $10 you get a full cup of steamed rice , main (good portion), 2 salads. Talk about A mouthFULL lunch . I had order the soft bone ribs as was recommended by most and it didn't disappoint the partner had curry cutlet which of course I had a bite of and was equally good even though it wasn't spicy . Overall a good lunch and now curious to try their ramen ..."}
{"text":"I can't find a single bad thing to say about my experience here! 

Came in for dinner and was warmly greeted by a girl at the counter who, upon noticing we were having a hard time choosing what to eat, offered to provide some suggestions. My heart was set on the braised ribs that everyone seems to rave about and my brother went with the curry pork katsu. 

Our food was ready in about 5 minutes and from the look of my food, it looks like someone cared about the presentation even though this is food court food. The bento box comes with your meat selection, as well as rice, potato salad, a spring roll and some carrots and broccoli. The braised pork ribs were as good as the reviews say. They're rich and flavourful and just lovely. The potato salad and spring roll are a nice side dish, the veggies are somewhat an afterthought but I appreciate that there's something green on the plate! There's a nice large portion of rice that should fill up the hungriest of diners. The pork katsu was quite good as well. 

I notice they also have some specials for around $5, which came with karaage and fries, or a piece of fish and fries. Seems like a good deal! The bento boxes are all $7.95 which comes out to just under $10 per person including tax. The value is truly there, the portions are good and hearty and the food is really excellent. 

Not much to say about the location as it's in a food court but it does appear clean. The lady working there was extremely sweet and seemed to take a lot of pride in their little spot. 

The only downside is their hours, I wish they were open past 8 just because I can see myself craving this food after hours! 

I can't wait to come back and try some other dishes!"}
{"text":"I'm in love with the soft pork bones (aka the pork tenderloin ribs) here! I've been following the owner's soft pork bones from restaurant to restaurant, and turns out he moved here. Was really excited to hear he opened a new place as I was afraid his recipe would become extinct.

Soft Pork bone Tonkotsu Ramen ($8.95) 
Comes with 3 big pieces of soft pork bone, a soft boiled runny egg, a lot of corn and veggies in tonkotsu broth. The soft pork bones were really tender, so soft, so good. The pork was braised long enough that the tendons are really soft, tastes like jello and dissolves in your mouth. Portion was good, decent amount of toppings which balances out with the ramen. Doesn't look like a lot but the pork can get pretty heavy so it's just the right amount. Pop/bottle water is an additional $0.50 which is very fair.

Braised Pork Soft Bone Bento Box ($7.95)
Comes with 3 big pieces of soft pork bone, rice, veggies, spring rolls, and potato salad (which tastes exactly like the Costco one lol). I will say the sides are slightly random but I wouldn't complain about having more food. A really good deal in terms of portion and quality of food. The soft pork bones were really tender and soft. The sauce was more on the salty side but goes well with the rice. 

Perfect spot for a quick lunch!
The staff are super nice and friendly. :)"}
{"text":"I order the curry katsu, meat was dry, and not fresh. Also, rice was totally over cook. I feel like this place is overrated, not really worth a visit."}
{"text":"[Good]
Food - Been here only twice but the food here is pretty good.  The flavours are nice and the portion size is appropriate for the price.  The spicy soft pork bone here is the winner and is a must get if you're into that kind of texture.  It also comes with some sort of creamed corn.  It's a little odd but I don't like normally like corn and even I'm a fan of it.

Stamp card - Bonus for having loyalty card for free food every 12 meals.

Service - Usually reserved for eat in places but this place stands out to me in terms of friendliness.  It's always a nice touch to see a smile and polite behaviour, especially from a Chinese run place.

[Neutral]
Parking - Can be a little odd if I nitpick.  Not many spaces up top but they do have a free multi tier parking lot.  The lot is hella confusing though when you try to navigate in and out of it.

[Worth it?]
Yes!  It's a nice spot for takeout or eat in the food court.  The portion size is great for the sub $10 meal that includes starch, veggies, meat.  Most importantly the food is tasty enough to warrant repeat visits."}
{"text":"Bento Boy is a new addition to Shoppes of The Parkway's food court. 

I had the Pork tenderloins ribs Ramen ($8.95). There was a lot of ribs. Maybe a little overload as those can be a little heavy. A little more noodle instead would have balanced out this bowl of noodle. The vegetables tasted a little awkward and out of place.

The pricing is simple with almost all items priced at $8.95 with option of upgrading to include a  pop/tea/water for $0.50. 

This is more an Asian Fusion Hong Kong Style Cafe take on food. You cannot really compares to Kinton or Sansotei which is a real sit down ramen place with just $2 more a bowl."}
{"text":"This place gives you the best food for your money easily. The Pork Katsu bento box is delicious and absolutely worth it. Will continue to go back weekly. They also have a unique poutine there that is worth trying and gives a delightful twist on a Canadian classic. Eat well friends!"}
{"text":"Would recommend the ramen and pork cuplet. Soup was a little oily, but was not salty. The pork cuplet? was very well done. Would not recommend the poutine, it has a bitter taste to it and very different from your typical salty poutine."}
{"text":"Glad I got to try this hidden gem today! Excellent food at a fair price point and super friendly service!

I really wanted to try their pork katsu but they ran out by the time I got there so I tried their curry chicken bento instead - actually not even sure if it's on the menu but the owner suggested it to me since they ran out of pork and I was craving curry. For $9 (after tax too), I had a big portion of rice paired with a veggie spring roll, some veggies, creamy corn salad, and the chicken. For this price and what you're paying, it's definitely a deal and enough to fill you up! The bento had more of a Chinese feel to the taste than Japanese - something to keep in mind! This would be the perfect place to grab lunch for those working nearby! 

For sure going to come back and try their ramen and other items that they offer!"}
{"text":"Bento Boy is located in the foodcourt of the Parkway Mall. The staff are really friendly and make sure you get your order without waiting for a long time. The is a nice selection of Bentos to choose from. I got the teriyaki chicken lunch bento and it was good. Portion sizes were fair."}

Wouldn't hesitate too come back.

The bento box comes with potato salad, spring rolls, some broccoli and carrots and big portion of rice. The curry was very flavorful. Happy that it filled a belly of two. Can't wait to go back and try their noodles and snacks."}

The meat was so tender and the sauce had just the right amount of salt. It's great to mix the rice into the sauce. For the chicken karaage, I was surprised at how juicy and tender the chicken meat was. Overall, the food was amazing and given its low price, it was definitely worth it!"}
