{"text":"Kare kare was a 1 star , sauce tasted like an instant powder and beef was thinly sliced and way overpriced. Lechon kawali was ok. Sorry but not recommending."}
{"text":"If I could offer a lower star I would. The place was empty when I arrived. It was just me for a late lunch. I ordered the lechon which was tasteless but I was too hungry to care. I then waited 15-20mins for a server to come by so I could ask for my bill and for a takeout box but noone came by so I got up to ask. But the person at the bar had to ask someone else to do it because he was on a call so I had to wait for the other guy as well. By then, I didn't care for the takeout box, I just wanted to leave. I was SHOCKED that there was a 15% tip included in my bill. What service?! You brought my food and didn't once come check up on me and I was the only customer you had! Never again! I wish I had the energy to fight against that tip!"}
{"text":"Went to this place the other night. I really liked the beef in peanut butter sauce. My friend got the grilled chicken breast. It was nice and fresh. They had a comedy show that Thursday night. Some of the comics were really funny. Worth checking out. Overall i would come back again."}
{"text":"I went to Dampa with my boyfriend tonight and have to say that it was pretty good! Ordered the pancit canton (noodles with pork belly), lechon kawali (fried pork belly), BBQ chicken skewer and garlic fried rice. Food was well prepared and the restaurant was very clean. Service was excellent and portions were generous.   Most people may not know what Filipino food is but I do encourage you to give it a try. The noodles tend to be more on the salty side and the BBQ meat is more on the sweeter side, but the flavours are great. I really wanted to order laing (taro leaves cooked in coconut milk) but unfortunately, they didn't have it this time around though they said they will bring it back.   We will definitely be back and hope to see more items added to the menu. I also wanted to try their halo halo dessert (I'm a sucker for colourful desserts) but we were way too stuffed by that point, so guess we will have to return in the near future!"}
{"text":"This is a clean and spacious restaurant with very attentive and caring staff. My friends and I visited quite late at night, an hour before closing. Their kitchen was still open and they did not rush us at all even though we were the only ones there.  My boyfriend is very allergic to peanuts and they were very careful to explain which dishes were nut-free.  The dishes I ordered to share were the mixed pansit and fired pork belly with side order of rice. The pork belly was super crispy. In hind sight, I should've just ordered pansit bihon since I like the thin rice noodles a lot more than the thicker canton noodles. The food was good but I wasn't really used to the flavors, hence the 3 stars. My friend ordered the BBQ on a stick and she said that was really amazing. If I visit again, I would want to try that and also the boodle fight."}
{"text":"Went to Dampa for comedy which apparently they have every couple of weeks. The food was okay, but they deserve a 1 star review for adding a 15% service fee for a table of two people, and did not inform us about it. I gave an extra 15% tip on top of that original amount.  If you go there for dinner be careful and inspect your bill before tipping.  I will never come here again."}
