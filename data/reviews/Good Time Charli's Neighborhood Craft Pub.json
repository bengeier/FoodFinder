{"text":"Great food! I had the Rueben and it was so yummy! Very cute inside. I went on a Saturday in midafternoon and there was live music. I will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Second time here.  Really nice beer list on draft and wise on tap as well.  The interior is very nice. The food is similar to a gastropub.  Had the Sonoran dog with fries.  Thought it was very good.  I'll update after this visit. It so far it nice to have a new place nearby."}
{"text":"I created a yelp account just to comment on the service we received this evening. The overall concept is amazing - Love the live music and vibe. Probably the worst service I have ever received. Management was standing outside yelling at workers for our whole dinner. Our \"server\" was Adam (I think - name on check) but he only took our order and never came back. We had to ask multiple people for drink refills and the tea he forgot. Drinks from the bar took over 15 minutes. No one came to check on us so we never had the opportunity to ask for the condiments we needed. Had to ask a different server for drink refills. I think the main problem was that we didn't really have a server because multiple had people helped us. Asked two different people for our check and sat forever waiting for it. Noticed that the people next to us never received their drinks either and they were clearly frustrated as well. Looks like they could have really used the staff that was being yelling at for over two hours during their dinner rush. Went inside to get away from the very unprofessional team meeting (yelling match) outside to yet again wait another 20 minutes for a round of drinks. We spent over $200 on food and drinks and really tried to have a good time. Even changed to inside the restaurant to see if things could get better. I REALLY wanted to like this place. The food is very good and the atmosphere is great but if you don't have good staff it kills the whole experience. Looks like management really needs to reevaluate where meeting are held and set a better example. I love supporting local businesses so I will probably be back but I really hope that these issues get worked out."}
{"text":"This location has been so many sub standard bars in the past. We decided to give it another try when we saw it changed to Good Time Charli's. What a pleasant surprise! The d√©cor is awesome and unique! The food is above regular bar food. They have great lunch specials and weekly dinner specials. The chef Ron is almost always on site and continuously asks you on your thoughts of the menu. Happy Hour prices are great, but works for  my spouse and I is that he likes craft beers and I like wine, so this is a location where we can have both. It is a sports bar as well, but mainly they have a great area for musicians and bands to play. This is a great neighborhood bar with a big outside patio. We live in Maricopa and would welcome a place of this caliber in our neighborhood. We really love the owners Charli and Jeremy they really value your opinion and are always willing to listen to your feedback"}
{"text":"\"Pinterest walked into a bar...\" 

Great local brews and tasty bites! Enjoyed a draft Four Peaks Peach Ale with a green chili pulled pork quesadilla!"}
{"text":"Nice decor.... service is terrible..... staff is dressed sloppy in yoga pants covered in animal hair.... yes, multiple staff members looked like they sat in a petting zoo....

Breakfast was greasy and all of the food tasted like griddle grease.... I would not recommend for breakfast"}
{"text":"It was a Friday night, All I ordered was a sandwich and fries waited for an hour and a half, and still no sandwich. Was there for over two hours and got only one glass of iced tea.  When I asked the waitress about my order all I got was attitude she could care less. Will never go there again and will tell anyone who will listen not to go there. Too bad the food don't look half bad."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, excellent food, good place to go for a happy, positive experience. There is a lot of lights and trinkets that make the place interesting, along with the bar top being made of solid pennies (really cool). I have been waiting for a good bar to arrive in Chandler, think I finally found one here."}
{"text":"If the bartenders spent as much time taking care of customers as they did jibber jabbing they his would be a 4-5 star place but service is TERRIBLE the guy next to us left after waiting forever for food. Good drinks and food but my god get some real help!!!!!

And for gods sake stop putting the receipts in the drinks it's disgusting."}
{"text":"First time customer, we will come back for sure.  They give an above average military discount, which is awesome. They also have great specials through the week and a $4 dollar kids menu. The food we had was delicious; kids loved chicken and fries. Chicken tenders were well above average, I had a couple bites.  Wife liked the bruschetta, nice change of pace for a bar menu. I had burger and fries; fries were unique and awesome. Burger was above average and spicy. The atmosphere is awesome; it provides an ambiance similar to to some of the up and coming bars in central Phoenix, but casual enough for the family. You should check it out! I would love to see more places like this in the east valley."}
{"text":"My husband and I purchased a Groupon and decided to try this place out, omg it is absolutely adorable. The decor is beautiful, the live music was wonderful and not too loud. I had the buffalo chicken sandwich and it was delicious. My husbands Patty Melt was good as well!
We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We got as far as the outdoor patio and the music was deafening.  Love craft beer but not loud rock...so if you are looking for something like that..it looks like a real hoppin' place!"}
{"text":"You will not have a good time at Charlie's.  Arrived around 7:30, the place was dead (maybe five total tables), service was absolutely terrible. Our server took our drink orders, brought us our drinks and then disappeared. 45 minutes later I turned around and saw him drinking at the table behind us with his buddies. Apparently he was no longer working. I went inside to find a new server. She was not interested in serving us so I went to the bar. The bartender took our food order and 30 minutes later delivered cold, tasteless and soggy food.  She also refreshed our drinks. Two hours later, we weren't sure if we needed to pay for the food and drinks or if we were just supposed to leave. I went inside to ask for our tab and no one knew what was going on. Don't know why this place has four stars. 

UPDATE: Upon reading my review one of their drunken employees sent me a threatening message full of homophobic remarks."}
{"text":"What a at place this little corner bar and eatery is! The foods is great and the draft beers are cold. 

We've been waiting some time for it to open and we're pleasantly rewarded for our patience!"}
{"text":"This place is so great! First time here since change of ownership. I was amazed at the change of interior. Everybody is super nice, but Brittany is just a doll. Sit in her station! The music was great, the food was surprisingly delish for a bar! I would come back in a heartbeat!!"}
{"text":"Great local bar. Solid beer selection. Food was excellent. We had the mushroom swiss burger and the bruschetta. Our bartender Casey, was the best! We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Great food great prices. Best place to eat and hangout. Always have good bands and great daily specials. Favorite place to go no matter what day"}
{"text":"I love coming here! My family comes here often for all occasions! Its a fun atmosphere to go on a Friday or Saturday night! I just wish I hadnt moved so far away otherwise I would go more often!"}
{"text":"Awesome place! Our server Adam was very attentive and really cool. Yummy food! Great band and great crowd! We will definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"Stopped in for the first time for Thursday Night Football. Great ambiance and a good crowd on a Thursday night. The live music was a plus. Beer was cold, food came out hot. We had the wings and pizza; wings were good, pizza was good but greasy. Only real complaint was with the Happy Hour pricing- website advertises $1 off all beer/wine, $10 wings. We were charged full price for the beer and $12 for the wings. When we questioned the price, we were told that the $1 off only applied to domestic drafts and the Happy Hour wing price was for a half-dozen and we had ordered a dozen. Except the half-dozen is only $6 at regular menu price, so... Charging more for Happy Hour?  Or maybe the Happy Hour changed and the website wasn't updated? Anyway, we will definitely be back to give it another try."}
{"text":"Great place for drinks and food plus the bar tenders are rock stars thank  you Brittany and Ariana for good food and service."}
{"text":"We've been there a few times over the last month or so for happy hours. Staff is very friendly. The patio atmosphere was fun.  Happy hour specials are ok. They have a tater tot nacho dish that is a fun twist on regular nachos-they do charge extra for some toppings so check that with your server.  Pretzel bits were tasty too. Our only complaint was slow service.  It took forever to get our drinks, food & checks. It didn't matter the size if or party or the day of the week.  There were 6 of us one time, 2 the next and 3 another time. Obviously it's something we have chosen to work around, IE: asking for checks early on, going to the bar for drinks, etc., and will go back for all the other positive things."}
{"text":"Love love love this place!!!!! Good food great music AWESOME staff! On the rare occasion Charli's not there to make you feel welcome her staff is more than capable! Brittany has been a friendly and FANTASTIC new addition to Charli's team!!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing!! Tried it from a Groupon. SERVICE was extreme slow!!! 2-1/2 hours for family dinner was way to long, wasn't even a weekend night. They definitely need extra kitchen help!"}
{"text":"Finally was able to try GTC and was amazed by the design inside, very comfortable with numerous tables inside along with a great patio outside including an outside bar.

Great decor, I don't usually care about decor (Don't want to lose my man card) but you can really see the work and thought that went into the design of this bar/restaurant.

Live music just about every night with a stage positioned where most will be able to see it and numerous TVs.

The owner Charlie and her Manager were very attentive and took the time to talk and meet us even though the place was very busy. 

GTC is brand new and is currently working to become a great neighborhood bar, so I would ignore the negative comments that have been posted.

Give them a try"}
{"text":"Wow. I think Chandler blvd and kyrene finally found a place that might stay! Great food, local wine on TAP?! Wait, what??? Az stronghold great wine and local, very nice touch! Food was awesome, hubs had pork belly quesadilla and I had sliders, with sweet potato fries. YUM!  
I'm just bummed were old and couldn't make it for the band. I'm totally taking a nap next time and will be ready to do some  dancing!"}
{"text":"Very good food, SERVICE SUCKED! Also watch out for your bill. We never asked for ranch and they gave it to us, charged us and not only that there was a MIC charge of $0.75 on our bill that they couldn't explain! When I asked one of the servers about it he didn't know and then he told our server we had complained about the $0.75 and started laughing with her about it! I can't complain about the food even though it was our first time, but just keep a eye on the bill and prepare for horrible service!!!!!!"}
{"text":"SO EXCITED for this place to open its doors!! Ownership knows what guests want when they are out for a great time, food and drinks! Had opportunity to look at menu and it looks amazing! Live music?! What?! Was told they will stay open till 2am every night! Yessssss"}
{"text":"Great food.. had the garlic knots, bruschetta, buffalo chicken sandwich and another chicken sandwich and they were all delicious. Even the Bloody Marys were good! All reasonably priced. Ambiance was amazing and loved the decorations especially the Jack Daniels soap dispenser in the restroom. The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because of the overwhelming spicy floral(?) type smell. It unfortunately takes away from the atmosphere and the smell and taste of the food. We came with a party of 14 and everyone seemed please with the food as well as our friendly waitress. I would come back!"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast lunch or dinner. Awesome service.Great beverage selection, five stars for me."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and had a great time but tonight was a poor experience. A group of us came for food, drinks, fun and to listen to the live band. The night started out great until the bartender decided to tell the band that they were playing elevator music. The crowd was singing and dancing- not elevator music at all. 
The band is packing up and so is the crowd. The band deserves an apology ! Not likely to be back!"}
{"text":"First time in, after hearing great things. Came in for a late Sunday breakfast and Bloody Marys. Whoa! $4 Bloody Marys that are garnished with half of a meal!
Excellent! We each had a breakfast skillet and were very pleased. Tons of white meat chicken and very savory. 
Loved the decor, especially the liquor bottle lights. Very cool.
Service was good. Had a few people waiting on us. Not the warmest but they got the job done. 
We are hoping this place sticks around! Reading past reviews I hope they can get their service issues fixed, even though we had a fine experience!
Go Charli's!
P.S. My only complaint is smoking on the patio. We would've loved to sit outside as it was a gorgeous day, but can't stand cigarette smoke while trying to eat. That's just me!"}
{"text":"Sports Bar atmosphere.  Very noisy.  Good beer selection.  Had the jalape√±o cheese curds - would order again.  Rueben was so-so. Meat tender but cold.  Sandwich was fairly dry.  Service fair.  Timely, but nothing special."}
{"text":"Very average food, but 2 stars because some items went missing. Chicken was very forgettable, and portions were small. Pretzel sticks were decently good, but nothing that would warrant a second time eating this food. Better options exist."}
{"text":"A great place! All the staff are so awesome. 
 Thanks so much for being a sweet place I can stop by for lunch on my day off work and a place I can stop by after work."}
{"text":"Great food great drinks great bar! Service was ok, but the bruschetta was amazing! Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Always a fun place with good food and live entertainment. Their grilled wings are fantastic and margarita Wednesday is fantastic. Only $3. Also recently tried the Trashcan drink and it was amazing."}
{"text":"The food is good, but I am highly disappointed with one of the servers named \"Adam.\"  Twice I have in this establishment and there has always been a mix-up with my bill.   He is the only person I have had a problem with at this bar.   Therefore, if you go here, make sure you double check your bill if Adam serves you - Because he is liable to over charge you."}
{"text":"Great place - great food - great lunch prices - awesome atmosphere - the staff was wonderful and the neighborhood needed a place like this - absolutely"}
{"text":"My family and I have enjoyed this restaurant many times throughout the past year.  The menu is extensive and the food is delicious; especially the tacos! The service and atmosphere are both comfortable and accommodating. Don't take my word for it, stop by this gem of a restaurant/bar for a \"good time\"!!"}
{"text":"Not impressed at all !! Rude bartender food was ok not anything to write about !! Disappointed all around !! Won't be back !!"}
{"text":"Terrible service, we sat along the wall and saw tables around us get service. We had to wave down the waitresses for water, to order, to get our food, to refill our drinks. 
I was hoping after waiting 30 minutes for hamburgers it would be worth the wait, it wasn't. My burger was undercooked, my food did not come out hot, it had cooled down. (But it was taken off our check when asked how the food was, so thank you for that). Happy hour doesn't include craft beer, only domestic. We learned that when we paid our check. 
Would I go back? No. If the waitresses acknowledged us with a smile or a glance, I probably would. But we were COMPLETELY IGNORED.
The table beside us, as they were leaving, saw friends coming in. They told their friends the food was not good and eat elsewhere. When we saw our neighbors, we told them the same and they left as well. First impressions are everything and their not off to a good start. 
The 5 star reviews have to be family & friends, because this is not a 5 star place."}
{"text":"The kitchen was backed up, the service was very slow, but the bloody Mary's were great. The food was very pricy and they charge extra for everything and th don't tell you. will we will not ever go back there again except for a drink"}
{"text":"First time in here. LOVE the decor, the atmosphere, and the people! Bailey was our bartender and she was FANTASTIC! The music was great, it was busy but not uncomfortable.  The patrons and staff were all really friendly! I live quite a ways from here, but I am excited to come back again and again!!!!!"}
{"text":"I seriously haven't seen so much love put into a restaurant and bar before. From the handcrafted tables and chandeliers to the fresh ingredients in their food.  
I've been here a handful of times and there's always something cool going on; live music,  paint and plant nights.  I never know what order when I arrive because there are so many options"}
{"text":"We had to wait 30-40 minutes for our food, as there was a miscommunication with one of our orders with the kitchen. When the food came, it tasted good, but pricey for some of the items.  My salad was huge and only $5. meanwhile the \"basket\" of garlic fries for $5.50 was not bigger than a side order.  The taco combo came with 3 tacos and a side of beans for $15, not $14 as it stated on the menu. The bruschetta came with 4 little pieces for $9.  On other positive side, the water was cool and entertaining, and got us our bruschetta on the house as it came 10 minutes after the other items, which were already taking a long time.  The bar is cool with the lights, and the music selection was unique, you never hear Clutch anywhere. I like the place, I may try again, hope they can come out with the food in a more timely manner and either lower prices and enlarge portions :)"}
{"text":"Thank you Charlie you made my day this is one excellent restaurant bar entertainment center whatever you like it even has a patio with the pool table OMG the food is excellent actually loaded potato soup baked potato soup oh my goodness the reuben sandwich is the bomb the French fry The BLT I can't wait to go back and try something else thank you"}
{"text":"We live in Scottsdale and stopped into this quaint little pub on my brothers advise - he suggested the pizza as the chef is a 15 yr pizza chef we had pepperoni mushroom and cheese - it had a sweet thin crust - three grilled tacos one Cajun all excellent bruschetta new castle beer ice cold the on every inch of every wall lots of energy service a bit slow with a new server but price was great food quality great nice large patio with outdoor patio bar hands throughout the week and a dance floor amazing for a little neighborhood pub highly recommended moment it Kimberly"}
{"text":"Food was decent, but getting any kind of service was a chore. After standing awkwardly at the entrance for an uncomfortable amount of time we were told to sit anywhere. Chose a high top and waited while servers walked by, passing us off to each other. Finally got one who took our drink order, then disappeared. When she brought our drinks, she asked if we wanted menus. We ordered, but the beer and appetizers were served at the same time as the meal. We still didn't have napkins or silverware, and the runner said we'd have to ask someone else for that because he didn't know where it was. The order was wrong and never corrected. Still waiting to see our server and get the check so we can head out and never come back. There's someone arguing with another server that he wants his ID returned, so at least that's entertaining.

There's so much focus on the daily events that service feels like an afterthought. Big mistake.

Update: Got the bill and we were overcharged. Surprise."}
{"text":"I want to like this place, I really do. The decor and mood are really nice and I believe that Good Time Charlie's could be great with better service and food. We had three servers help us, the third eventually became our server after drinks and meals were ordered. She did not introduce herself or say anything despite the weird start to our visit. She came up to us several times while we were still eating and drinking asking if we wanted boxes. 
When we were ready to pay she was less available. 

Now for the food. We ordered wings (honey hot and honey BBQ) and the Doc Holiday burger. 

The good: the wings were large and cooked well. 
The seasoning on the fries was great

The bad: the burger, despite being undercooked, was not juicy and was basically tasteless. The honey BBQ wings had no flavor, I mean none. Perhaps a hint of sweetness but no BBQ flavor. 
Lastly where we were seated we could hear the music from the kitchen loudly playing. 

This place could be great, it just needs to work on a couple things."}
{"text":"I'm a little on the fence about this place, been here a couple times, love the live music factor, light fixtures overall VIbe of the place.  The service was pretty underwhelming both times I've been.  I'm generally a very generous tipper when well taken care of.  I still tipped well despite long wait times!  The star deduction is for the mediocre service and the really bad pepperoni pizza I had that made me sick.  Something not right with that sauce on the Pizza, not fun puking it all up!  Willing to go back, but will definitely stay away from the Pizza, and hope the service is stepped up a few notches!"}
{"text":"The drinks were good (I had a Moscow Mule) and the food was good enough but not super exciting. I'd still go there to drink and play pool and eat if I was hungry but it's not on my gotta go there for the food list. We went there on a holiday so the waitstaff was limited and they did pretty well considering."}
{"text":"Good food, cold beer, friendly staff. Food is typical bar fair but the servings are large.."}
{"text":"The wait staff needs to be better trained as you are over attended to or not attend to at all.   There does not seem to be a system in place.   Last week I sat and waited for service only to have to walk to the bar for my drink.  Last night I was approached by 3 different waitress .. this was good until I needed anoter drink.  none of the wait staff checked if i needed anything.  I decided to leave since service was slow and had to wait over 30 min for for my tab.  Great music and great sound system."}
{"text":"Love this new neighborhood gem!! The decor is amazing! From the exposed brick walls to reclaimed wood tabletops no detail went unnoticed! My favorite part were the light fixtures featuring Jack Daniels bottles. They had a great selection of local brews on tap at the beautiful bar top made of pennies! Now to the important part, the FOOD! We tried the pick 4 bruschetta and all of them were unique with perfectly balanced flavors, it was impossible to pick a favorite! I had the tacos, the Salmon and Avocado was my favorite, but the Cilantro Shrimp was a close second. My boyfriend enjoyed a Rustic Italian sandwich. We can't wait to go back and catch some live music!"}
{"text":"First dine in experience.  Local neighborhood biker / bar.  Met the owner Charlie, very nice.  Staff was friendly and the feel of a good old music bar/pub was relevant.

The food was mediocre to good.  Wings were done very well, $13.50 for a dozen with veggies.  Boneless wings were tasty but rock solid.  Chicken ceasar (lettuce was grilled and you could taste the grill) was okay, not my thing.  Dressing was a bit different tasted like mayo and anchovies with garlic.  

It's what you might expect."}
{"text":"I'd like to give this place a better review because it looks like they are trying to be successful. The decor is outstanding and ambiance is perfect for a nicer bar setting. My husband and I visited during the lunch hour and took over an hour and a half from beginning to end. This is unacceptable if this establishment expects to cater to someone on their lunch break. The server was friendly but hardly prompt. Our drinks were empty longer than they should've been and my chicken sandwich looked and tasted like an old piece of cardboard-like chicken had been sitting around and the cook dropped in in some hot oil and put it on a bun (it didn't get eaten). The only upside is that the cheese curd appetizer was outstanding... the decor and the cheese curds are the only reason I gave two stars.. this location has seen many different restaurants come and go and I hope this place gets it together soon so they will succeed."}
{"text":"Met here, on a Wednesday night, for drinks & nibbles, with a friend from out of town.

The staff was challenged, due to no-show employees.

But Charli & Mike, and others did their best, to make us happy.

The food was good, the mules were very good, and the musical entertainment was solid.

We enjoyed our evening, on the patio, and I'd give Charli another go.

Fun, neighborhood spot, with good food, drinks, and caring folks."}
{"text":"Service pretty good. Awesome food menu! What we've had off the menu was delish! Decor & atmosphere pretty cool."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. The band was decent but not great. We came here hoping to dance but the \"dance floor\" is teeny tiny. Not a place you can let go, be free and dance. If you do, the whole bar just sits and stares. Our male bartender was friendly (and cute!). Fun place to have drinks."}
{"text":"Super cute place however, we sat ourselves and nobody acknowledged us. There was more staff than patrons and we didn't even get a hello. The patio bartender finally asked if we'd been helped. We had a drink and bailed. The servers were more into doing their makeup in the bathroom than serving. Probably won't be back... it's too bad because I really hoped this could be our new neighborhood bar but the staff seems to think they're working in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"This is the third time I've been here and I will definitely come back often! Great food - such a variety, too, and a decent wine list. Entertainment options are many and the staff really does a good job. The best part - they reward us veterans with 15% discount on our bill - and we appreciate it!"}
{"text":"This place is great. Friendly service and above average pub food. The live music is good and not too distracting for anyone just wanting to grab a bite. For their food, the pulled pork, tacos, fries and pretzel bites are all definitely good. They just expanded the menu which helped a lot. I'm not a huge fan of their nachos (the cheese gets to be too much too fast), but I've been impressed with the place. They also have local wines on tap which I appreciate. The atmosphere inside is good too - they did a great job redecorating from the past owners."}
{"text":"Haven't yet tried the food, but choices look fabulous! We only stopped in for drinks. Loved the Sunday night jam session, but feel it should start about 7pm rather than 8pm--it's Sunday night! And the chairs aren't the most comfortable. Still, would go back to try the food!"}
{"text":"This place is great, first time here. I mean effin well done. The band was good, more important was the sound level was spot on. You could actually enjoy the music and the people around you. The filet mignon sliders were just short of amazing, wait, actually amazing. The quesadilla feeds like 12 people, salsa excellent The staff is well prepared, they should be proud working here. The staff hiring is really spot on, no matter whom serves us, they have tried most of the menu, refreshing. Alex, well done"}
{"text":"This was our first time in, and we were so impressed at how much attention to detail they made at making the atmosphere comfortable and eye catching. The beer selection was amazing, and the food was great. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Local place, used Groupon for first visit. Lunch salad was delicious, very fresh and good combination for the grilled chicken fruit salad. Good environment, great service, will definitely return."}
{"text":"Had a great time at GTC! Adam, our server, was great and we had an awesome night. If you want to hear great live music & eat some good food then this is the place."}
{"text":"I love this place! Great food, and the staff is awesome! Brittany and Casey are the best!!!!"}
{"text":"Went to try this new place, looks good,nice inside. Place was packed for a first Friday since it opened. Waited a few mins (no problem) for a table even though we see a few tables open, was told they were under staffed, which was concerning. But when we sat down at our table, we waited about 10 to 15 mins for service, which was upsetting and ruined the mood in trying out the new place. We were ready to leave but stuck it out. What was frustrating was the waitress serving the two tables surrounding us plainly ignored us since it was not her assigned table. 

Well finally we got service after we called out and grab one of employees. Ordered our food n beer, but the waitress did not know the type of beers on the menu and did not tell us only certain beers were on their happy hour special. We unluckily found out when we got our check. I wasnt expecting much off but it was during the happy hr.  Anyway got our burgers we ordered, after waiting about 30mins and we had too ask our surrounding waitress to check on it cause our assigned waitress was hardly around.  My burger was good, fries were good, no complaints. My partner's burger was under cooked and did not want to finish.  Luckily the Manger stopped by for a greet and took it off the bill. 
We well try to go there again, since it's in our neighborhood, but probably sit at the bar only for hopefully better service."}
{"text":"Insanely horrible service. Took 45 minutes to get an appetizer- and the place was not even busy. 
Our server was just plain terrible and inattentive. 
We checked in at 6:15 and just left at 9:00- that was how long it took to get our food. 
The food was good. Band playing was great. 
Great company because I had my family with me! So still a great night.
********
I am changing review from one star to four because the manager reached out to me, asking how they might improve.   To me, that extra step tells me they want to ensure better service ...and that matters to me.  That effort alone is worthy of an improved rating."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, people and staff. Food was fresh and tasted fresh. This is a place I'll definitely come back to visit. Good Time Charlie sets the bar for what a neighborhood hangout spot should be like and that's always striving to deliver the best to the customer."}
{"text":"The food is always amazing and the staff is awesome.  This is our favorite place to eat and hang out."}
{"text":"Awesome Bloody Mary's and good specials for football Sundays :)"}
{"text":"I just discovered this place and I've been there 3 times already this week.  You cannot beat their lunch menu and all that food for $5.99! Food is amazing, service and the girls are awesome... but the decor of this place is everything. From the light fixtures, the bar, the wood walls, love it all! Modern contemporary with a southerner flare at its best.  Def keep it going, hope this bar is here for a long time!"}
{"text":"A dive bar that is anything but! Great food and drinks. A fun brunch place that I can't wait to go back to. Can't wait to try all their many specials.  Total win!!"}
{"text":"Good Time Charli's is awesome! The atmosphere is very nice and comfortable.  We had a group of 5 of us. All of our food was amazing! Burgers, salad w/fillet mignon, grilled fish tacos - we each loved our meals and our drinks - especially the selection of beers (and Bonus, they have Heineken!). Our service was fantastic and the waitress was very attentive. We sat in the front near the stage. When the band started, the acoustics were perfect! Not too loud... The band \"Tick, Tick, Boom\"  was very, very good playing 80s, 90s and current music.  

The place was very busy from the time we got there until we left. This place is a Gem. Five stars!"}
{"text":"What a great place!  The staff was wonderful , the food delish and atmosphere was awesome!"}
{"text":"Awesome environment! Service was great. The Thai Coconut Mule is awesome! Loved the chicken enchiladas.  My husband had the chicken ceasar and we would not recommend that. It was really dry. Other than that I highly recommend this!"}
{"text":"The previous reviews are spot on service is painfully slow ( if you sit at the bar it's quicker ) the food was so so we had chicken tenders that were over breaded and a little greasy, the ranch dipping sauce was like water and the fries had a hint of granulated sugar that was gross. The basil garlic fries were ok . We were done with our food and our drinks were empty and we waited once again the service is slow finally the waiter came around and asked us if we wanted another drink and we're like no just give us our check.  Been there done that now we'll move on"}
{"text":"Nothing better than a Wednesday Evening at Good Time Charli's ( or any night of the week for that matter). Cool night on the patio... the atmosphere is amazing! There's a huge family (old and young alike) having a Birthday Party!!! How cool to have a Neighborhood Hot- Spot that can make everyone feel right-at-Home. Love this patio!! Sometimes the games on, but it's awesome after a long day at work just to relax, mood lighting from the trees ~ just the right company... For the record every night there's something for everyone:
*Mon-Wed ~ Solo Music Act (kinda chill stuff)
*Sun&Thu ~ Jam Session (Open with Charli's Live   Band)
*Fri&Sat ~ Headliner Bands
And that's just the music!!! 
*Sidewalk Art Sales every week
*Balloon maker for the kids!!!
Now onto the food: tonight i had a Barbacoa beef taco. Spicy beef guacamole, lettuce, onions, queso fresco topped with cilantro lime crema... for the low, low price of $3!!! My friend always has the White fish tacos - blackened or grilled. I've also had the Surfin' Safari Pizza - sausage, pepperoni Canadian bacon and pineapple and the most incredible sauce!! Only $14. For being a new place they've found a comfortable groove. The waitstaff is knowledgeable and fun - tonight was Danielle & Alicia, but Hannah, Donnie and Myria are all awesome!!! I highly recommend GTC ~ Thanks so much Charli and Family... and welcome to the Neighborhood!!!"}
{"text":"They have a $6 lunch special. I thought it would be safe to go try. I asked the waitress what she recommended between the sliders, Ruben and the buffalo chicken. She recommended the Ruben. I ordered that but told her to have them go light on the dressing. When the Reuben came out it was covered in so much dressing that I had to take my napkin to wipe it off. The pastrami was also very fatty. The waitress noticed what I was doing and she offered to  make another sandwich. I should have accepted her offer. I needed to get back to work so I said no. The sandwitch was barely edible the french fries were prepackaged and freshly fried. I may try it  again. The service was good. I can give their tacos a try. I will definitely stay away from the french fries and Ruben."}
{"text":"I really want to give GTC 5 stars. It's in our neighborhood and I qant it to be successful. Stopped in about 2 weeks ago on a thursday night around 7:30pm with a friend. Wanted a drink, a bite to eat, and to listen to some music. We were seated right away. Drinks and food took forever. Forever. It was painful. Multiple staff came up to our table asking if we were being helped so there were definitely enough staff for the people in the bar. I'm wondering if the kitchen was understaffed. Drinks tool forever too and all I ordered was captain and coke. Food was good. Decor was amazing. I will try again and hoping for much better service."}
{"text":"Been here 3 times now. The wings are really good, but thats the only thing (food/drink) above average here. Not a bad place, just not amazing. You can get door dash delivery until 2am (1 am?) though, which definitely sets them apart.
Service has always been great, the patio is nice too. 
The front dining area is kind of separated from the back area which is great - because the front area can be pretty loud with music/tv. The rear dining area has plenty of tv's - and you can hold a conversation too!"}
{"text":"Had a good experience with the server who first greeted us but soon after we got harassed by a second server as well as the owner of the restaurant when trying to order a drink. After showing three forms of identification (because we are from out of state) The server litteraly yelled at us to the point where we got up and walked out without ordering a thing. I've never experienced such terrible customer service before in my life. They are rude and do not treat their customers with any respect. I would expect a lot more from a place like this. I wish I could give them less than one star."}
{"text":"I WAS having a good time until Str8 up was kicked off the stage.  I'm still trying to wrap my head around why a bartender would make a band leave when there is a dance floor full of people.  Needless to say, I thought this was my neighborhood bar but I won't be back.  Come on Good Time Charlie's...Sad.  Definitely not elevator music."}
{"text":"Great place with life music and delicious food, we will definitely come back. They have so many different beers on tap that matches the food perfectly."}
{"text":"After a second visit I have found that the food was better than I had expected. The menu varieties were more than would normally expect from a bar. One thing that did surprise me is that they serve breakfast from 10-2 each day. Not many bars do that. The staff as was during my last visit happy to serve and we had not issues with our server, Jen. She was very attentive and took great care of us during our stay. We arrived at 11:30 AM and it was Happy Hour. The Bloody Mary's were only $3 and they were more than worth the price. They add bacon, olives, asparagus, beans and spiced yellow peppers. One of the best I've had in the Phoenix area. 
I will be going back to have one of those."}
{"text":"Good food and good selection of beers. We will definitely be back here. It's probably very hard to open up a new bar at first and have it be flawless on its first week. The place was packed and I wouldn't put too much stock in the negative reviews."}
{"text":"When this place opened my friends and I were excited to finally find a place close to home. The decorating looked so inviting and creative. The menu options are pretty on point for bar food. The entertainment is great. The one thing that bothers us is the service. It ranges from long wait times from bartenders or servers, orders being wrong and when it comes to asking to split a check be ready to send it back a few times.  How do things get added if they weren't even ordered? We have visited during busy and slow times and it's all the same issue. The thing that calms us down is Charli walking around asking how things are and fixing them. We decided it's a place to go once in a long while instead of making it our frequent meeting spot. :("}
{"text":"Went here recently with a friend and my girlfriend.  Normally the service and food have been wonderful; however, this last time was something to be desired.  Food was not very good (Tacos and chicken burger) and the service was very very slow.  This is despite the fact that it was a Monday and the place was fairly empty at the 6:30-8pm timeframe."}
{"text":"Food is good and people here are really cool. If your looking for a chill bar this is the place to be."}
{"text":"Tonight was my first visit to this place since it reopened as Goodtime Charli's. I went there to try out their 50 cent wing special on Mondays. The owner has done a great job with the d√©cor! It's the nicest looking place of all of the previous iterations this place has been by far! 

I got in there about 5:30 before the big happy hour rush, and that was a good thing since they got very busy shortly after I arrived. I liked the fact that they has a nice patio area where they actually allow you to smoke. I like having a cigarette with my beer. 

I got service very quickly, and since I knew what I was having I got my order in fast as well. I tried out their Hot wings, and their dry rub Cajun wings. The wings were large, and they were nice and crispy, but both of them lacked any real flavor. The dry rub was almost nonexistent, and had no taste at all. They just tasted like fried wings with nothing on them. The Hot wings were not much more flavorful. I would call them mild, to medium at best. There was not a whole lot of sauce on them, and it just didn't have any real heat to it at all. Thankfully that had Tabasco out so I could add a little heat, but that's not my favorite thing on wings. I'll be standing them a better recipe here tonight, and hopefully they'll give it a try. They served the wings with the traditional celery, carrots, and ranch dressing. They claim they make their dressings in house, but the ranch dressing was very thin and runny, like they had used 2% milk instead of buttermilk like you are suppose to. 

I'll go back again ad try out their burgers next time. I saw one go by, and it looked decent. I can't complain about the service here like many others, but I did notice that others around me were not getting what they asked for very quickly. They do need more help it seemed to me."}
{"text":"I have been to many restaurants in my day, but this was bar far the worst ever!  We waited forever for service and when ordering the waiter seemed put out to find out the \"soup of the day\" for my friend!  I had gone on their website before coming and saw that they have tap wines $1 off.  So I thought thats what I will get.  The waiter comes back and says oh sorry we dont have wine on HH anymore.  I told him I just saw it on the website!  So he checked with his mgr and gave me the $1 off.  I have to say that the food there is excellent and so is the place inside and out, but the staff has a lot to be desired.  We got our check inside so that we could move outside to an available patio fireside table, but waited forever and was charged for the glass of wine I never got.  I told the waiter and he said \"oh, yeah, I forgot!\" and brought it to me.  We all went outside and were hoping for better service, but unfortunately that did not happen. We flagged down a waitress and she sent out a waiter/bartender guy.  The first thing out of his mouth is, OK, so whats the deal with the checks out here?  Is everyone paid inside or what is the deal?  Not Hi, everybody, sorry for the wait, did you settle everything inside or are we starting new checks?  What can I get you?  He finally takes some of tables order but walks away before getting everyones order.  So my husband and I go inside to order the wine and he is waiting forever for his change.  I went back outside to the table while he waited and wondered what was taking so long.  The finally come out from the back room and ask my husband if he has another $20 bill!  He said yes, but what is that?  This $20 is not my bill as he proceeded to show them the bills in his wallet were neat and crisp from the ATM and the bill they were giving him back was washed out and crumpled.  The bartender that was waiting on us outside got in my husbands face and said \"Are you calling me a liar?\"  and my husband said that he was because that was definitely not his $20 and he wanted his $20 back.  The situation was escalating and he did not want to get into a physical altercation with the bartender so he gave them another $20 took the one they gave him and left extremely angry and upset.  I spoke outside to the manager on duty which was very nice, but really needs to get a handle on his employees because they definitely do not know how to treat their customers!  The bartender even came out and yelled at me in front of his mgr and did not even take care of my friends.  I am so sad because I heard such great things about this place.  The food was good but that all.  We will never be back.  Worst experience ever!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is great. The food is excited and tastes great! The people are very good. It's a great place to have a get together with friends or just a small dinner. They have great drinks!"}
{"text":"We had a bad experience a few weeks ago.  We really wanted this place near our home to succeed, so we gave it another chance last Friday.   One of the owners made sure we had a good table, and the service and food was excellent.  The owner explained to us they had experienced problems with servers and had made new hires, and their efforts toward better service were obvious.  Great service, delicious food, and a charming atmosphere will make us want to come back here often."}
{"text":"Food always excellent - No one quite as exemplary as the bartenders and wait staff - shout out to Ariana"}
{"text":"Great ambiance, very attentive service. I come on late night on the weekends sometimes send Ariana always takes care of me. If you're looking for a laid back spot in west Chandler, I would definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Well we attempted this place three times and they have struck out.... love the atmosphere but the kitchen is slow and lacking.... takes over 40minute for appetizer. I thankful for a third attempt of a good and joyful visit....I wouldn't recommend this place.... maybe for a cocktail but that's it. Very disappointed...."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast. Offers military discount and dog friendly patio. Good Bloody Mary too."}
{"text":"Such a fun local bar! Always looking for a country bar where you can catch live music during the night even on week days, this place is what I've been searching for. Wait staff is awesome (shout out to Brittany), super knowledgeable about the background of the bar and supportive/loving of the owner. You feel like a part of the family coming here and the drinks are great. Awesome
beer selection and specials (who doesn't love a $2 marg with good tequila)! Will for sure become a regular at this local gem!"}
{"text":"Note to owners or music coordinator. 
I have come to the Sunday \"jam\" several times. I have never seen more than 4 people in here for this thing.........Hmmm.....what could be wrong?
1. Waiting for football to end. THERE IS NO ONE IN HERE WATCHING IT, WHY ARE WE WAITING?
2. Such an incredible trio of musicians, hands down F'ing incredible. Do they always have to play for 45 minutes FIRST? This is a jam right? WE AS CUSTOMERS get to play too right?
3. It's a Sunday night.......most of us have to work the next morning. I'm not going to stick around until midnight to hopefully get stage time.

Your \"JAM\" isn't going to be profitable. Relabel Sunday night as the GTC Trio night.
Several stops on a Sunday to play, I won't be back,
YOUR STAFF IS AWESOME THO!!!!"}
{"text":"Went with a group of friends for lunch and the lunch specials were Awesome! And food was great!! The interior of the restaurant has been remodeled and looks clean and contemporary!  Live Music! Lots of TV's, service was excellent!! Charli the owner was very personable and nice!! Best wishes! I will be back and tell my friends!"}
{"text":"We really wanted this place to work for us, after we Tried 3 separate times and all struck out. Bar staff is great, wait staff is good for the most part, but the kitchen needs some major improvements. First visit our order never got put in and an hour later we ordered without the appetizer, second time kitchen was massively under staffed and we literally got no food, this past time we ordered the pretzel knots and didn't get them for 40min. We were told the first ones got burnt then I pointed out the second ones were not even close to being done on the inside and said we were done only to be told the rest of our order that we placed only a few minutes before was done (trying to say to bad you have to take your order). We talked to the manager and she was apologetic and understood unlike the waitress. Sadly we won't be returning for a 4th time."}
{"text":"We came here to check out the dueling pianos on Thursday night from 8 to 11. Very talented piano players, voices not quite as talented but overall was a fun evening. They kept the audience entertained with some interesting requests. We only had drinks, so no comment about the food. Liked the decor in the bar especially the light fittings. Lively place for a fun evening out."}
{"text":"First time here... great food, good drinks, but I won't be back. One of the bartenders told the band they were playing elevator music and now the band is leaving. How completely unprofessional of the restaurant. You hired the band, the patrons were enjoying the music. It was NOT elevator music. Yup... unprofessional as I won't be back."}
{"text":"Top notch food and service.  The bar staff goes out of their way to make you feel welcome. The cilantro shrimp tacos are my favorite item on the menu. Great selection of local beer, whiskey, and other spirits. Good Time Charli's is locally owned and they do a great job of supporting other local business. My favorite spot in Chandler!"}
{"text":"I was expecting a dive bar when we pulled up to Good Time Charli's, but was surprised with what I found.

Don't get me wrong - I absolutely LOVE a good dive bar, but this wasn't that. The menu is pretty extensive and they have tons of beers to choose from. I enjoyed the wings, but the rest of the food fell flat for me.

They have a ton of bruschetta boards, but honestly I wasn't impressed. Leave the bruschetta to Postino's.

Overall, the bar food was good and the craft beers are great. Charli's should stick to being a solid bar and leave the fancy menu behind."}
{"text":"Wow! The interior is decorated with a lot of car nostalgia and quaint. The menu has a lot of yummy things it was hard to choose a meal. I had the quesadilla and it was so big I found the finish it all! The service was attentive but never over bearing. We were in a large group so I don't get to taste others food. I definitely will return !"}
{"text":"I want to remember this place next time I am traveling thru Chandler.  The Bloody Mary was just the right Spicy for me.  The bacon on the other hand was a tongue scorcher   Very spicy. Sunday $4 Bloody Mary.  The breakfast tacos were excellent I just have to remember to remove jalape√±os.  The coconut cream French toast was amazing.  If I was solo I would have a tough time choosing"}
{"text":"Monday afternoon it wasn't too busy, sat ourselves. We ordered pizza, fries, and wings. Order came out with just one order of fries that didn't have the garlic it was supposed to, be brought us a second one. Got another ranch and the wings were grilled. The bill is where we were a little shocked...$6 for fries and then $2 more for garlic? I must have interpreted it wrong but the back said a side of fries $2. Then I got charged .50 for ranch and .50 for grilled wings...wish I would have been told this prior to ordering. The food was very basic, ranch almost tasted like mayo. We won't be back, maybe this is just a place for drinks on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"Love this place but today, tried to sit outside and was overwhelmed by dogs and smokers.  So moved inside and noticed that one of the dogs crapped on the patio and so the owner picked it up and stuck the bag in the garbage right behind the bar.  This is really not the kind of thing you want to see, smell or be around while eating!!!"}
{"text":"A friend and I went in at 4 PM. About 5 tables were full. Only ONE server, who was also behind the bar. Needless to say, service was S L O W. I asked for 2 samples of beer. Took a while, but they finally arrived. Server never returned to get my order, so I stood at the bar for a good 5 minutes before she noticed me. Another server finally arrived about 5:30, and the service got better. Good beer selection. Good pizza! Monday night special was $7 for a 12\", 2 item. Also got 50 cent wings. The cajun rub, boneless. Not much flavor, but good size. We decided we would go back again; as long as we had time to spare."}
{"text":"What a cute little gem of a bar! They have live music in the evenings and a great happy hour. I have tried this place twice and each time the food has been satisfactory. The reasons for a 3 star review is the wait staff is SLOW. Both times I waited for a long time after being sat before anyone came over to take my order, my beer went dry between each glass, and getting the bill in a timely fashion was an issue. Second reason is the tables have way too many items on them. It's like playing Tetris when the server brings the food, you have no room for anything.I will definitely try this place again and hopefully update the review with more stars."}
{"text":"It would be a 5 star for me if the damn high top stools we're not so uncomfortable. Foot is fantastic, and great beer selection.  Live music, just a good time like the title."}
{"text":"The band had an early show here tonight. Stayed for the next band and grabbed some grub. Very good food and atmosphere. I got the Aireanda Grande Burrito."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Lots of fun for all ages it's elegant yet barish. Thursday night is dueling piano night. Friendly service we enjoy visiting."}
{"text":"Yesterday we had to wait over an hour for food that shouldn't have taken more than 20 minutes to cook. We went here in the mid-afternoon when there was not many other patrons. It shouldn't have taken NEARLY as long as it did to prepare. We won't return."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time last week, had driven by and always wanted to stop in.  Atmosphere is top notch, nice furnishings but not pretentious plenty of TVs for sports.  Nice stage on the inside and acoustic duo on the patio.  Menu is fantastic thought it was going to be simple bar food but it was so much more.  A whole section just for Bruschettas.  Got a steak sandwich and green chile quesadilla and was very happy with both.  The steak was perfectly cooked and seasoned and the portion size was just right.  Beers were ice cold and had a good selection.  If there was a knock on this place it would be the service.  Wait staff was knowledgeable and attentive but I don't think there were enough. Food came out fine but drink reorders were very slow.  Overall a very good find will be going again."}
{"text":"The good: when it finally arrived the food was good. 
The bad: incredible slow. 15 minutes to get a drink, even water on the table in addition to alcohol. Food took over 45 minutes to arrive after placing our order. Not many people were eating either. Server never checked on us, apologized (not her fault), offered anything or even refilled our waters. It seemed like she was the only one working besides the bartender. FIX your service issues, have a roaming to make sure people's beverages are topped off, you might even sell a few more rounds, hire some more attentive servers. We have been going to Teakwoods for 20 years. They still pretty much nail it every time with service and food. The one time that they goofed bad the manager proactively came over to our table and comped our meal. The remodel from the old bar to Good Time Charlie's is nice but it was too dark inside. Hope you can fix these things because you can tell the locals want it to be a success."}
{"text":"We came tonight to follow the live band Straight Up. We are less than an hour into the playlist and apparently one of the bartenders or staff members are complaining about the music selection of the band. They are packing it up as we speak. I guess we will spend our money elsewhere this place is a joke!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch  ordered the chicken and dumplings. What a mistake. It wasn't fit to feed my dog. Sloppy mess and over cooked. 
I lost my appetite.
My drink was a mojito it had no mint in it. Sweeter then sugar? I asked for mint and it was given to me on the side. Nothing could save this drink. 
Then my server asked how was everything I said this doesn't taste like chicken and dumplings.  It's over cooked. Looking more like chicken stew with carrots in it too.

Then the owner came over continued to ask me questions about how I make chicken and dumplings. Over 20 minutes just continue to try to justify the food and cook.

My husband couldn't even enjoy his Hamburg. 
We were very hungary and only wanted to enjoy our time together. 

Charlie did take the  mojito and dumplings off the bill. Then handed  us a 10.00 gift card. 

I just wished I used it to pay the balance of our meal. I don't plan on returning to this bar.
After giving it some thought and time.

I still have the 10.00 gift card.
And we paid for our coke and burger my husband did eat and drink. We did tip the waiter he tried to do his job.

This is why I am giving it a 2 star review."}
{"text":"23 minutes for a glass of wine. By that time I wasn't going to order anything else. I gave my card the moment my wine finally did arrive. Been here 40 minutes now and I just got my check back. I wouldn't want to see how long getting food here would have taken."}
{"text":"My first visit was on Customer Appreciation Day. Great music, great food and excellent staff! As packed as it was I was very impressed with the staff. Quick service, food delivered as ordered timely and staff cleaning up as quickly as possible. I've managed a bar many years ago and trained staff in customer service in previous career for 15+ years and the staff all deserve an A+! My new neighborhood haunt."}
{"text":"Husband and I wanted to go watch some live music on New Years Eve after reading rave reviews. We went at 6PM and was looking for a table outside to sit. The server who was outside never came and greeted us. We sat there for 15 minutes waiting for her. She KNEW we were there the whole time because we originally asked her where we should sit. I ended up asking another server who brought us menus but he never came back to take our order so we ended up leaving. So disappointed as we were excited to try something new. I don't recommend this place as the servers do NOT care about their customers. When we decided to leave, another group of ladies came and sat RIGHT NEXT to us and the first server went right over and gave them menus. Horrible service."}
{"text":"Friendly service, if under staffed. Prices are high. Even at Happy Hour. Live music Friday at 4pm is awesome. Bring extra cash and be ready to wait."}
{"text":"This is a happening live music nightlife spot with better than average bar food. The decorations are interesting. The inside is amazing. You would be we guess it was a divey sports bar before. 
The food was better than average bar food the menu has interesting items like quinoa bowls and pizza. The dry rub wings were awesome. If you want blue cheese and ranch it's a buck more. :-( the running en was eh the two buck upgrade to Sweet potato fries was ehh. The fifty cents side of ranch to dip them in was also not great. French dip was nice and meaty but au jus was way to salty. The tater tots were crazy salty. 
I would try it again for music and drinks and maybe the wings as a appetizer.  Maybe a burger and fries."}
{"text":"We've eaten here twice in the last week now and LOVE this place! Cool decor, great live music and superb service both times from Vince. Best pretzels ever! So far we've tried the pick 3 Tacos (salmon was my fav) , patty melt, salmon pesto sliders and Big Mac style cheeseburger and HOT fries. I say hot as some bars don't seem to be able to get this right. Like that it has more than just your standard sports bar food, and all so fresh ! It's definitely going to be our go to place!"}
{"text":"What an amazing restaurant/bar!! Been here a couple of times, never disappoints! Great food & specials, oh and amazing live music! Super chill atmosphere and the staff is super friendly. Brittany was friendly and made us feel like part of the family. Make a stop by here, grab a beer, catch some tunes, and make sure you ask for Brittany!"}
{"text":"Food is AMAZING! Service on point!! Sooo busy and everyone on staff has obviously BEEN HERE BEFORE! Congrats charli and my good buddy justin! Good time charlies is TRUELY A GOOD TIME!!!"}
{"text":"Charli, you are a genuine sweetheart and a business owner who truly wants to succeed. We have talked a few times since our initial meeting over 40 minute fish and chips. You draw great musicians and have some friendly people on staff, Dove is the best. My suggestion would be a smaller menu as is traditional in a pub. I hope things improve as you want them to and wish you all the luck I'm the world."}
{"text":"Good Time Charli's is really nice. I really like coming here for the nice atmosphere and pleasant staff. The bathrooms are real clean and nice. The burgers are really good and they often have good drink specials. I would really recommend this bar."}
{"text":"Awesome place, way cool vibe, really great specials every day (check their Facebook page), and CASEY is AMAZING!!!"}
{"text":"First time eating here, a little small inside the fire pit was awesome! Beer prices and selections were reasonable! Food was ok service was mediocre hopefully when I go back I get a different server."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today.  Got our drinks quickly.  But then waited over 20 minutes to place our order.  Finally got to order.  Waiter apologized when  we complained about the wait.  Computers were down.  Someone should have informed us?  We did get $10 off  our bill.  Husband's cheeseburger sliders had no cheese.  Waited awhile to pay, husband finally had to catch a bartender's attn to pay.
Had long wait for food the last time we were there too.
Guess that's it for us for this place."}
{"text":"Four of us went here on a Sunday night.  Sat down at a table.  Waited 15 minutes.  No one came by for drinks or food.  We were never even acknowledged.  One and DONE!  Will never go back.  Maybe this dump will close and something with service will take its place."}
{"text":"Entertaining atmosphere on a Thursday night with the Dueling Piano Guys. Had the chicken wings and an avocado chicken sandwich. Military gets a discount which was nice to see as well."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. The garlic knots were amazing and awesome beer selection. Come see Casey!"}
{"text":"Went for a quick stayed for an hour. The place was fun food was fantastic. I had Italian Beef. Scrumptious. Daughter had filet sliders. Great great meal service was  quick and place was very nicely decorated. I highly recommend the food service and atmosphere"}
{"text":"Breakfast is so delicious and no long wait like most nearby places on weekends.    Drink specials are great...cant beat a loaded bloody mary for $4.     Staff is friendly and efficient but not intrusive.  Highly recommend this neighborhood gem."}
{"text":"I came in last week and had Ariana as a bar tender. She was so sweet and made amazing drinks. You can tell she really cares about her customers. I got the fuzzy mule and my friend got a regular. The fuzzy was made with peach was was delicious! She made us some specialty shots as well which were seriously great! I will be back ASAP with friends. Just wanted to compliment how great of a bartender and person Ariana is."}
{"text":"The service here is horrific if you don't sit at the bar. We've been here several times and the food and drinks are great if you sit at the bar. If you have to sit anywhere else in the bar, you might as well be sitting in your car on the parking lot, since they never get your order or ask if you need another beer. You have to walk back to the bar to ask for something. We walk into the place and walk back out if there's no seats at the bar. It shocks me that management doesn't recognize this as a problem."}
{"text":"JC  from KC, thank you for the great service! Steve, nice to meet you- thank you for checking on Mike and me! The decor is bomb Charli!  We'll be back to check out the pizza! Wings & corn fritters- yum!"}
{"text":"Great place to unwind.  Service and food are excellent.  You can enjoy live entertainment or go hang out on the patio."}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere, good service, and such a great time. This place is just what I have been hoping for this side of town to have---a cool local bar. To make it better, they have fantastic live music! I don't know who wrote those negative reviews...they're nuts! It's definitely worth checking out and saying hi to Bailey and Dove, our awesome bartenders!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! Great food and awesome drinks! Not to mention happy hour is from 11-7!"}
{"text":"So glad to have a nice place like this come to the neighborhood.  Great selection of beers, still have your Budlight, Coors and so on, but craft beers from local brewries as well throught the US.  Tried three of the burgers, they were great. Servers were new and in training but handled themselves very well, lots of people checking on us when it was crowded. They take service seriously and were working the kinks of a new business out.  I cannot complain because they gave it all they had and made it work well.  Very happy so much we went back, played 36 holes of golden tee for $10, had a great time. Can't wait to see a band there.  This place will erase your nightmares of local drunk that use to inhabit the Regal Beagle.   Love it."}
{"text":"I'm sad to downgrade my rating here. After our first visit we were so enameled that we returned several times-often bringing one or several new people to try what we had thought was in the running for our new favorite place. The first time I was understanding of the slower service due to having invited over 10 people to meet us there. However, each time we have returned, we continue to be underwhelmed by the service-and yet, we keep going back HOPING that all those last half dozen visits were anomalies. Here is the great things about the place:  as most people mention, the decor is just really cool; the menu is extensive and interesting-haven't had anything that wasn't very decent-the other night, a BYOB burger with lettuce wrap and a fried egg and basil garlic fries-OMG; great beer selection and awesome daily drink specials; THE ENTERTAINMENT!!!  Now then, Charli I really hope you take this in the spirit I'm giving it, because again, we WANT to love it. But we haven't been in there once since our first visit where we were even acknowledged by a server before having sat for 10 or more minutes. It makes customers feel small and unimportant when they sit there awkwardly even waiting for a greeting let alone a drink order. I will say that a few times, our service has been perfectly fine AFTER that first long wait. We typically come between 4-6 pm and it's not always terribly busy. Unfortunately, a few times, our service has continued to remain slow for the entire visit. Two days ago, we had the first experience-it took awhile to be noticed (and several other parties who came in after were greeted before us) but afterward things were good-until half our table of 4 was done eating, and then we had a hard time locating our server again for drink refills. Honestly, in the 15 minutes we waited to be helped initially, we considered leaving but in retrospect are glad we stuck around. I hope this place can get their service act perfected because it really has so very much potential. And to be truthful, I will deal with less than stellar food, but, call it my deep-seated and long-lived personal insecurities, being ignored when I'm ASKING to pay for service feels really wrong. Thanks for listening :)"}
{"text":"The food is not bad, but the DJs and sound is garbage.  Also the bar has horrible service.  I get it that it is your 30th Bday, but give me a break; take the night off.  Don't sit back there and complain about having to work on your birthday and whining about it every time that someone comes in that knows you.  Locals seem to be taken care of while anyone new is neglected.  Oh ya did I mention those illegal poker room."}
{"text":"I came here for a Saturday afternoon lunch with a friend, and I was immediately impressed by the atmosphere (classy rustic). We ordered burgers and chicken fingers for appetizer. The burgers were perfectly cooked with onion straws adding a crunch to each bite with an expertly balanced combination of ingredients. The chicken fingers were tender and lightly breaded, and the French fries were thick enough to provide a nice balance between a crisp outside and soft inside. Basically, I'm really impressed an I'll return for sure :)"}
{"text":"The decor, the live music and the Moscow Mule were the best part of the experience. The service was slow and not attentive. We were sat between to the Golden Tee game and an empty table. Where the hostess and wait staff were rolling silverware commiserating about work.  The 2 men playing the game were practically on our table. We had the pretzel bites, which were good. But the beer cheese sauce served with them was disgusting. I didn't think cheese could be ruined. This was my second visit. The street tacos I had on my first visit weren't good and the service was slow and inattentive, but I gave it a second chance.  I don't think there will be a third."}
{"text":"Cool looking place, just don't get the burger, way undercooked and super pink/red, full of gristle on a soggy bun, one of the worst I've ever had..."}
{"text":"Follow up review. Decided to give this place another opportunity but the service is still bad...not someplace I'd recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"I have been to GTC for lunch a few times and always received excellent meals and service.  My favorite item on the lunch menu is the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich which, at only $6, is a delicious, smoking deal.  I do not want to know what they put on their delectable Rustic Potatoes because if it is heroin (as I suspect) then I'll need to go to rehab where they will definitely not serve that side.  

A bartender at another establishment that I frequent recommended GTC for music and a server at a different bar mentioned she liked to hang out at GTC as well.  Now, if industry people are into the GTC night scene I thought I should give it a try.

I arrived at 7:30 on a Saturday night and managed to get a seat at the bar.  Ariana was kind and patient with a stranger who was not familiar with the beer list.  The people around me were very open to including me in their conversations, and the wings were crispy, juicy tenderness.  The massive beer list lends itself to a variety of palates and the mixed drinks looked impressive.  

As Fett's Law so aptly states, \"Never replicate a successful experiment.\" But who am I kidding; I know I will be back for more of the wonderful food, beer, music, and banter."}
{"text":"We went for a Happy Hour as a team to this place. Server was slow and the food was alright.
But I heard some good things about the place. Will try it sometime again and check out their live band performing."}
{"text":"We came from Santa Fe, NM for the weekend. Found this place online it seemed like a good choice at the time.  The food looks great online but I was quite disappointed that I never got a chance to taste it. They told us a 20 minute wait and an hour later we were still waiting and watched as they sat other parties.  We were extremely disappointed in their service.  We're going to Phoenix next year and I can assure that we will not be visiting this local business"}
{"text":"This place is OK. Nothing like I thought it would be. The live band is nice the service sucked and the food sucks. I sat at the bar and the service wasn't that great and the dark black hair bartender was rude. She kept talking to the other bartenders talking about the customers calling them idiots. Anyways We got the nachos and the wings. The nachos weren't too bad but not worth $12 not even piled high or real cheese or salsa and the wings absolutely sucked that's probably what did it for me I was craving to have some wings before we even got here and when we got them I had 2 and my wife had 1 and we were done the waitress asked me if I wanted a box and I told her no that's OK she asked if we weren't that hungry and I told her how bad they tasted. The wings tasted like they had a little soap in them very dry and the taste was horrible and then what did it for me and made me decide never to come back here again was the waitress charged me for them. I love wings and have never thrown wings out or wasted them bit these were horrible don't get them. Then when I asked for my tab it took 15mins to get my tab, and I was sitting at the bar. It was almost like she was mad I told her I didn't like the wings. The best part about the night was the band, that's it. I will not be coming back here. The old place here was Beef O Brady's and they had better food."}
{"text":"I loved the vibe here. We ate the buffalo chicken pizza. It was delicious right down to the crust. Also had the cheese curds and they were tasty too. Beer is always good, but I discovered a new favorite here...Big Blue Van. Now if only I knew were I could find it in Kansas! The live music was also enjoyable!"}
{"text":"Such a great spot!!  Charli hit a home run with this place.  Food menu is SO YUMMY and the vibe and feel of the place is really special.  

Live music too... hellz yeah!!!"}
{"text":"I did not have a Good Time at Good Time Charlie's.

First time here was Saturday night about 830 we arrive to a surprisingly busy restaurant --like I think we got the last table in the place kinda busy--so I'm not going to harp on the speed of service, though it is 9:52pm and I'm still sitting here with an incorrect order. 

So, let's cut to the reason for the rating. 
I ordered 12 traditional wings extra crispy 1/2 Medium 1/2 BBQ. What I received was 12 traditional wings (not even kind of crispy) all BBQ. My friend ordered 12 boneless wings in medium sauce, but received boneless wings with no sauce at all. We notice this immediately, and bring it to the servers attention. We are told our orders will be remade and out right away, no big deal, simple enough! 

However, they didn't remake anything. Instead of remaking 6 wings properly they took my incorrect, already sauced, BBQ wings and just tossed them in medium sauce thinking I wouldn't notice... I did notice. I don't like BBQ, they were for my boyfriend, so I noticed the sweet taste right away. I made everyone at the table try it to confirm I wasn't crazy, and I wasn't. 

I then sat there waiting for the server to check on us or at least take notice that I hadn't really touched my food, but no one came back. When the server finally did come it was to offer a check at which point we brought to her attention the fact that the order was still wrong. She runs off, comes back, and says we'll remake you 6 medium wings to take home. 

At this point I don't want the wings, my meals been ruined, I've officially filled up on cheese curds and tatertots and am over the whole experience. You'd think a discount off the wings since I didn't eat them, offer to remove them from the tab, an apology for trying to pull a fast one, a manager to check on us and assure us it wouldn't happen again, something! ... but no, nothing. 

Maybe my server, the manager, and owner don't know this, but patrons actually choose to dine out instead of eating in. True story-- some people cook at home. Not just that, but out of the endless options of restaurants and bars they chose to visit your establishment. So I figure do your best to make it an enjoyable experience, or get out of the industry. 















The Food:
The food is really just ok. On a high point, most of the food came out warm... not all, but most.

Corn Fritters: Just take them off the menu. These little sugar dusted fried balls should have been magical but they were so far from that. Tasted of a bland batter, maybe even undercooked. Very unappealing. 

Wings: Well, you know my feeling on the wings. Traditional (bone in) wing size was actually pretty decent. However, boneless wings were no good. Teakwoods wins this one hands down. They do have a number of sauce choices though. 

Ruben: No complaints, solid sandwich."}
{"text":"Went to this place on a whim for Thursday night football with a girlfriend. Love the atmosphere, could have done without the dueling pianos but the food and service was great!"}
{"text":"This is the best bar for any occasion! Food is delicious, beer selection is stellar! Not to mention Ariana and Brittany are the greatest bartenders in all the land!"}
{"text":"I heard so many great things about this place and was excited to try it tonight. I came in with my girlfriend and was seated right away. The patio was filled with smokers so we asked for a seat inside. After 15 minutes sitting down, I had to flag down a server to place a simple drink order. Order was taken begrudgingly and then delivered incorrectly. Had to flag another server to run our payment. Place is dark inside so recommend to sit next to a window. Not the best first impression."}
{"text":"We come here several times a week and never once had a bad experience, not even close. The interior is very well done with lots of warm lighting, tvs, great music, Golden Tee, ideal prices, and a large patio. A great place to take friends for lunch/dinner/brunch :) The food is delicious and staff is beyond friendly."}
{"text":"We were very excited about visiting this place as we have heard that they have great bands and decent food. I'm honestly hoping we hit it on an off day.  We walked in to a smelly aroma of perfume air freshener.   I ordered a French dip sandwich that was below average. My husband ordered a hamburger that was below average. The clientele around was getting in verbal fights around us. This seems to be a rough joint!!  I wish this place the best but we won't be back and I hate to say it... don't waste your time or energy on this one...."}
{"text":"Went here during an event called Plant Nite. The place was nice and all the waitresses were very sweet! Our waitress was very attentive and caring! I had the pineapple pulled pork tacos and they were SO good! I asked for some BBQ sauce to put on top and that was like icing on the cake! I don't like my food to be too dry. If I'm ever on that side of town again I will definitely come back to visit! I loved it!"}
{"text":"I was super excited for this place to open since I live down the street but I was pretty disappointed. I came on the opening weekend and like other reviewers stated the service was subpar. We also sat down for atleast 15 minutes and watched everyone around us get service. We finally went over to the host to see if we could get some service then five minutes later someone finally showed up. We ordered the nachos and they were terrible. Hardly any cheese and hard as a rock and rubbery when trying to bite them, they were absolutely uneddible. I would have let the waitress know but by the time we flagged her down I was ready to get my check and move on to another bar. The crowd also seemed older, around 50's and the music was bleh. There also isn't much room to dance since the tables are packed in everywhere. It would be nice if they moved out some of the the tables later, say around ten to open up the dance floor more. This place seemed pretty understaffed and overwhelmed. I'll probably give them one more try in another month to see if they got their act together because it would be nice to have a local bar."}
{"text":"Good time Charli's should be called GREAT TIME CHARLI'S!!
Came on a packed Sunday night. I was able to call ahead to reserve a table for 8 near the stage for dinner. Alex was our server and did a fantastic job. The food and drinks kept coming all night. 
The MUSIC was outstanding!!! Didn't know what to expect being our first time, but after watching multiple musicians kept switching things up it was a night we will never forget. They played everything from Johnny Cash, ZZ Top, Bruno Mars to top 40. So much local talent we were very impressed!!! If you want a local bar with great people, service and talent come here. You'll be glad you did!!! :)"}
{"text":"Checked this place out tonight at about 6:20. with a Groupon.  First impression was, nice patio! Entered to a welcoming hostess who informed us it would be about 10 minutes for a table so we walked around and checked the place out. Great decor, atmosphere & busy staff running about. .We spied an empty table against the east wall and wondered why we could not sit there. After 30 minutes, we got that table. So we were a bit frustrated at this point. Almost immediately our waiter, Vince, appeared and gave us our drinks at Happy hour price even though it was now 7:01. We then ordered the Phoenix Phiilly  & Tacos combo. The order came out within 10+ minutes and both entrees did not disappoint!  Phx Philly was not huge but was really filling. The meat was moist, tender and the heat (spice) was spot on! Yum! Loved the fries too! The Barbacoa , pork belly & shrimp tacos were so flavorful & the beans had a nice smoky flavor but were just a touch dry. All in all, great job chefs! We were all around pleasantly surprised with Good Time Charlie's and really wished we had the energy to stick around for the dueling pianos!  We will definitely be back! Thx to all the staff :-)"}
{"text":"Had plans to go elsewhere until I got their email that said Chad Gregory was live on the patio. If you haven't seen this musician you need to, he's good. Anyway, went with family and had a seat on patio. Smokers everywhere like most bar patios. Really too bad but we managed. Had the wings, tacos, chips and salsa and was pleasantly suprised. Actually, the menu is way above bar standard. As The patio music ended, the music inside was starting. You can see the owner they take pride in food and music  which is why this place will make it."}
{"text":"Great burgers and strong drinks. Saturday night is a bit of older crowd,  but the vibe is positive. Really enjoyed a relaxing time here"}
{"text":"The blond with short hair may be the rudest person I have encountered this year at a sports bar.  She ignores people standing at the bar and seems to connect only with the regulars who she seems to know.  The  few minorities who pop in on occasion are treated as they are not welcome and seem to be a bother to her and a few of the wait staff.  
I appreciate  the quality of entertainment and sound system they provide but don't expect a warm welcome especially if you are not of a  light complexion.  Sad to see this since  Charlie's has the best entertainment  in East Valley."}
{"text":"Great place day and night. Exceptional food. Try a Sunday brunch on the patio with a mimosa and a great acoustic music. Lexi is a fantastic server by the way."}
{"text":"GTC lives up to its \"neighborhood pub\" rep. We walked in around 11:30 on a Friday night and there was live music and a decent amount of people were there dancing and singing to the live music. Such an awesome atmosphere and it seemed like the people there were really enjoying it! The beer list consisted of mostly local drafts. The service was awful, though. Our server triple-checked our IDs and so badly wanted to accuse us of being underage. Ahh, the perks of looking young! We probably won't be back, but it is a nice place to hang out."}
{"text":"Service is very slow. 20 minutes to order, 20 minutes to get a check. Understanding it was peak time, I won't be too critical but at least let me out of here.
3 stars for good ambiance, clean surrounding, and decent food. May try again another time but not likely."}
{"text":"Cool neighborhood bar & grill .. live music on the patio outside or sit inside and enjoy music on the jukebox.. 

We stopped in on a Saturday afternoon for early Happy Hour!! And half of the bar was celebrating a patrons 80th birthday .. as they made their way to the indoor stage to hear his funny speech and thank people who had traveled from various states to be with him.. we all got to join in and sing happy birthday to him!! What a great experience!!

I enjoyed a couple of jack & cokes (nice pour) and then the low carb Mex plate with a combo of pulled pork and shredded chicken .. lettuce for faux tacos, shredded cheese, sour cream, guacamole, pico de Gallo .. all fresh items!! 

Lots of healthy options on the menu if you're low-carb or Keto.. they have low carb items !!

We'll definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Went for the first time Friday Night. This place was packed! We were seated quick (two of us). 

Our server was Alex. He was attentive and never left our drinks dry. Great service!

Had the chicken wings. The plumpest, biggest wings we've had yet! Impressive! The Habanero has a kick of heat & the Garlic Parmesan were tasty too!

Great Happy Hour Deals- Mixed & Well Drinks $3.50. Beer Specials @ low prices as well. They offer about 6 menu items at half the cost. Hours are Mon-Friday 5PM to 7PM. Special Brunch offerings on Sunday's.

Pizza- Pepperoni had them add fresh basil & garlic. It was delicious.

Menu had quite a bit to offer. From burgers & sandwiches to salads, burritos and more.. 

The restaurant feature live bands Friday & Saturday's from 8PM-12AM, Lounge Piano Player Thursday's evenings. Offer plant & paint classes. Also, feature a local live DJ that plays from 12AM-2AM on Friday & Saturday Nights. 

Fun spot that seems to have many locals and is always busy!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is amazing service and food  bad! Ordered a patty melt it came with nothing but a burger and bread ... no onions no cheese no mayo! They offered to redo it and brought back Same,with cheese and not melted. Still no onions like a patty melt had! Many times I have tried this place and the food and service continues to be bad. I think I'm done trying after 5 visits, Shame"}
{"text":"First time here. The food food was good for bar food. We had 3 different servers and the original server took our food order and it came to us wrong. We didn't get utensils and had to ask for napkins. Will return but the service on a Saturday afternoon need to improve or at least show that they care."}
{"text":"2nd time coming through for lunch with a coworker as the lunch specials for $6 are pretty good. The selection of beers can be a bit overwhelming but it was lunch time so drinking wasn't on the menu for us. Initial greeting could of been better but other staff members were eager to jump in and make sure everything was good for us. 

Sat at the bar this time to key an eye on the TV's which was a plus. The menu appears to be in a state of change, but change for the better as lunch this time around was good. I ordered the lunch special Sliders against a few others who had before. My lunch was good and even my coworker was looking and saying 'yeah, looks better than before'!! 

Local neighborhood bar with live music in the evenings is an added bonus over other neighborhood bars of looking for something different."}
{"text":"We have been to Good Time Charli's about 5 times now and have had a pleasurable experience each time. We usually arrive later in the evening and have hung out at the outside bar.  This past Friday we met some friends for the end of Happy Hour and dinner. I'm sad to say the service was terrible!  Our friends arrived before us and had a table and they had received their drinks. We arrived and it was 10 minutes before we could get the waitresses attention so we could order drinks as well. We placed our drink order and my beer arrived quickly but any mixed drinks that were ordered took a long time to arrive. Our food was delicious and came to us hot, but that was the only good thing about our visit. The waitress never came by to see how our food was or if we needed anything else. I certainly can't speak for the whole staff but this particular waitress was not very good."}
{"text":"Been here 3 times and I gotta say Adam was awesome!! He was quick, knowledgeable on the beers and drinks and all around just awesome!! Thanks for the great time!! We love it!!"}
{"text":"Just stumbled across this place while killing time before a flight. Great beer, live music, service and food."}
{"text":"Friday Happy Hour.  Good sized crowd but not all the tables were full.....was able to park close to the door....not bursting at the seams, not crazy-busy.  Food was good but not great.  Had boneless wings, nachos, and 5 kinds of bruschetta at the table.  Wings were good but dipping sauces were sad (cilantro lime crema had no flavor beyond crema; pub cheese dip had fantastic smoked cheddar flavor followed by what tasted like a belch of hot Guinness in your throat...definitely awful); bruschetta was well made but not always well conceived..... sometimes flavors did not go together as well as one might have imagined.  Nachos were only half eaten.

Service was terrible.  One in our party ordered lemonade and it took 15 minutes to get to the table.  Bleu cheese dipping sauce never made it to the table even with 2 reminders.  Asked for a fork and napkin; was never brought either; ended up using someone else's napkin when she had done with it.

I have to comment on the uniforms worn by the female employees.  I understand the spirit of the outfits, a-la Hooters.  Not all bodies are made for booty shorts and tank tops, and no respectable boss should expect their 45-looks-like-60 year old bartender to wear them with pigtails.  From a distance of maybe 50 feet, she looked like a cute 23 year old.  Up close she looked like the Cryptkeeper.  I'm sure she's a crackerjack bartender; please let her wear something age appropriate.

While we didn't feel a strong negative about the place, we generally agreed we would probably spend our happy hours elsewhere."}
{"text":"It's just a bar with bar quality food. Not sure what makes anyone say anything more about this place than exactly that. It's just a bar. 

The downside is its got some marginal characters. Bunch of 40 and 50 somethings that are chain smokers and power drinkers, heavily tattooed crowd. If that's your thing, then this is the spot for you!

I felt like I was on a Carnival Cruise eating buffet food."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday night, it wasn't very busy.  But, still the service was horrible.  There is absolutely zero hustle in our waitress, and seemed more interested in hanging out than taking care of her customers.  Our waters  were never refilled which was annoying because we were eating very spicy food.  I'm very disappointed, because this used to be my favorite date spot.

On top of all that, our Burger was severely over-cooked. We didn't complain because we were so hungry we just wanted to eat. The fries are awesome, and the wings were good as well.

Pros: Decor, great bands, good drink selections

Cons: very poor service, hit or miss on the food."}
{"text":"Very impressed. Extremely local to me, which is always a plus. DOG FRIENDLY. Daily specials, excellent food, good people, great service, quality is on par with price and if it's on special, know you're getting a deal. The house cured Ruben sandwich was by far one of the best I've eaten. The portion was substantial and it happened to be on lunch special for 7 bucks. Live music with dancing some nights. Dueling pianos, acoustic duos, two stepping, great patio, once again EXCELLENT FOOD for a neighborhood spot. I could go on and on.. Probably will over time as I'm certain I've found my new local haunt."}
{"text":"I would normally never expressly state this about a bar in town, although many do this,  but this place waters their distilled alcohol...bought several straight shots tonight...ALL were watered.....very disappointing....and likely contrary to AZ law."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. On the patio with a friend for over 3 hours, and NEVER ONCE saw a waitress outside. Had to find my own ashtray. Had to walk inside and wait at the bar for every drink. Felt like the owner hired nothing but buddies and no one really cared about servicing patrons.  One star is being generous."}
{"text":"Horrible, non-existent patio service. Had to get my own drink from the bar after a 30 minute wait. Then requested a menu from a waitress, it never came. Had to get a menu from the bar and ordered from the bar. When the waitress brought the food she asked if I had a tab, no. Then how did you get your drink? I paid for it, CASH! Also had to go back to the bar to pay for the food. Unbelievable!"}
{"text":"Visiting my family that lives in Chandler and bought a Groupon for this hot spot. Fun decor on the inside with tons of flat screen t.v.'s and a good amount of space to accommodate groups. Servers were very friendly and the food was pretty good and tasty. The basil garlic fries were yummy and burgers and sandwiches were to everyone's liking. Happy hour is pretty awesome 11am-7pm, and they have a great drink selection including wine on tap!
Next visit, I'm definitely coming back! Oh, this is a kid friendly establishment before 7pm...don't let the outside fool you!"}
{"text":"The hamburgers and fries were very good.  The only problem was we came for lunch and it took over an hour to get our food.  There were six of us and only one other table that also ordered food that we could see.  Really need to get the food out in half an hour or less for lunch, unless you are not wanting a lunch crowd."}
{"text":"Hey Adam...thanks for the great service this evening! All is good and I'm true to my word. Thank you for yours."}
{"text":"Brittany is awesome makes great  recommendations and  great menu options.  A biker bar that makes everyone feel comfortable...live music...great specials...and they ensure you enjoy your time.
Neighborhood bar good food, awesome specials, easy listening music, and energetic service. AWESOME happy hour."}
{"text":"Just try  pizza for time since place open, I don't  have date off for pizza special. You know what it doesn't disappoint. Almost good as Grimaldi but didn't have to travel to New York or paid extra for that. Trust me they multiple food dishes or happy hours dishes that accommodate or satisfied need."}
{"text":"My honey and I went to Good Time Charli's for the first time tonight. The food was good, but their alcoholic beverages were not that great. The drinks were weak and tasted like medicine. The atmosphere is good, but their seats are a bit uncomfortable."}
{"text":"Great food, great drinks but the slowest service that I have ever seen in a local restaurant bar with about 10 people in the place.  This is about the 5th time we have been here hoping each time that the service gets better just to be disappointed. It's really a shame because the food is fantastic!!"}
