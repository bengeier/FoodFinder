{"text":"Tucked behind the Filiberto's, in a strip mall formerly anchored by a Radio Shack, you will find this gem. Once inside we were greeted by friendly staff and noted that the interior was nicely decorated. The Poison Ivy roll was really great, and we also loved the choco flan and horchata. Also got some shrimp tacos, which were good too. Will definitely be going back! Sure, the name is kind of funky, but the food is great!"}
{"text":"I been to this place a few times. It is the only place close by where they sell \"Mexican\" sushi. The sushi there is great. Can't complain. But last two times i have gone i had to wait more than an hour for my food. I like to call in orders ahead of time so they are ready. Last time i went i called, which they told me 25-30 min wait. I said okay great. I get there after 30-35 or so. Food was not ready. Giving it time since i figured they were busy i waited. Not until another 25 min passed and nothing. I asked the lady if it was ready and she kept saying 15 more minutes . 3 other ladies complained about the waiting time as well and mentioned they were there for more than hour. One lady even left . Did not bother to even get a refund. After another 15 min went by to realize my order was not even close to being made. I asked again and said they were working on it . At this time more people seemed to be annoyed for the waiting time. There was 2 ladies working in the grill & one taking orders. After 1:10 min waiting at the place. My order was finally done. That is why i given it a 2 star review. Ladies working there are nice and food is great. But i don't know if its worth waiting for an hour. I plan to give it another try and hopefully the waiting time improves!"}
{"text":"Finding this place took us about 30 minutes driving up and down main because we had lost the flyer from the grand opening! & i have to say it was well worth the time we spent going back and fourth before we spotted it!!! Absolutely amazing the sushi is on point and you get 12 peices per roll! The fruit was definitely fresh but you definitely have to try this place out for your self!!"}
{"text":"Ignore the location and be sure to get in here, the food is well worth it!  We got the MV roll and the carne asada fries- I highly recommend both. The inside looks brand new and was very clean"}
{"text":"Delicious!!! I just brought my family here to try something new and the food was fantastic! If you haven't been here, you're missing out!"}
{"text":"Food is great service was good as well more pieces of sushi than any other sushi place fruit was fresh this is my new sushi spot love how they close at 10pm."}
{"text":"Best Mexican sushi in town! The prices are reasonable and the sushi rolls are super huge! The owner was great came out and said hi to everyone talked to us! So friendly and the super clean! As my mother has always said \" if the door is clean before entering its a great place!\" And I couldn't agree more! The tres leches cake was super moist and delicious! I recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"Although this was truly an experience I'm glad I tried... Mexican Sushi fusion... the outcome definitely left me unsatisfied.   To start with the good:  The atmosphere was clean and the staff was very nice. I'm sure the Mexican food would have been great, but we came with sushi in mind and that's how we found this place on yelp.  Now the cons: The salsa provided was only green salsa that was watered down. We ordered the MV Roll, Cordon Blue Roll and La Bomba. I love a deep fried roll every once in a while, but the taste was the same with all 3 items... the grease was a good flavor, but the rice covered the taste of all the flavors that would be complimentary, leaving it bland. Although it was very filling, it left my wife and I wanting a different food afterwards.   To sum it up: The idea of Mexican Fusion was great, I just feel like it wasn't executed properly. I hope they pay more attention to their salsas and learn to work with the rice more sparingly."}
{"text":"Great place and great food my favorite shushi bomba Also thank you Maria Vega for your great customer service!"}
{"text":"The Sandia Loca is worth mentioning, you cannot even begin to imagine how much fruit it is, and it's good fruit too, sweet and juicy!"}
{"text":"I had to go back... Don't judge me. I was craving the Chamoy and I'm so glad I did. I got 2 of the manzana locas to go and decided to get a lunch here too. I ordered the tostitos with carne asada, pico, cabbage all the fixings. Squeezed fresh lime on it and was in total heaven. When the chef/cook/goddess tells me i should put Chamoy on it to?! I quickly tried it and fell in love even more. We got to talking and she brought me a piece of flan to try and the girls even gave me a Mexican coke! It was the perfect compliment to the tostitos locos.  It was so great to talk with people who are passionate about their food. She makes her Chamoy and the Flan and cakes here. The Flan was fantastic, you could taste the milk and time and effort in it. No heavy overpowering sugar flavor either which was great.  Looks like I'm going to have to bring all the work girls here to spread the love. This place is a gem and even though I'm greedy, I hope you come here and share the treats with your friends."}
{"text":"Have good sushi, the staff is nice, don't recommend the fish tacos . The salsa is good too."}
{"text":"You have got to try this place. Period.  When my wife and I were looking for a place to have lunch last Saturday, we looked up what was local and recommended on Yelp.  This place came up, and I confess we made all manner of jokes about the name, the concept of Mexican food and sushi together, that there were only a handful of reviews posted.......  Even when my wife and I pulled up to the restaurant, I saw the pics on the front and wanted to leave (it looked like a Mexican restaurant trying a gimmick of sushi.)  Shame on me.  I am happy to report that we did decide to at least go inside and \"order one thing\".  Best idea I've had in awhile!  I can only assume this is a family run place, because everyone there was incredibly nice and outgoing.  Turns out they were running a charity even that day for a local police group, which was awesome by itself. But, I'm a foodie, and this is a restaurant review: the food was incredible.  I had no idea what I was getting into. I didn't even know \"Mexican sushi\" was a thing. I thought this place was going to service Mexican AND Japanese food.  No, they serve a complete fusion of the two.  The \"sushi\" is Mexican versions of everything.  They make all their sauces, and the result is absolutely amazing.  My wife doesn't like cream cheese, so they quickly offered to make their rolls without it.  We started with one roll (we were just ordering one thing after all), and it was absolutely amazing.   I can't tell you the name, but it had shrimp and cheese on top -- and yes, that shouldn't ever go together.  Ignore what you know about food, this was just delicious.  The second roll we got had beef and asparagus in it -- I didn't like the asparagus, but the overall flavor was excellent.  You've got to try this place, you'll be glad you did!  I can't wait to make the trek up there agin."}
{"text":"We got a restaurant.com certificate to try this place and we will definitely be back! The sushi was soooooo good and so unique. The inside of the restaurant was very clean and had a fun vibe. The service was very, very good. I've never had Mexican sushi before, but I am so glad we gave it a try!"}
{"text":"Es riquísima su comida !!! Tienen mucha variedad !  Y todo está muy limpio si pudiera diario comería hay"}
{"text":"They had really good Mexican sushi! I've had Mexican sushi a few other times this is one of my favs And the also had fruit with chili on it to die for so good!"}
{"text":"A place to get tacos and sushi. Yes it's that amazing. Mexican style sushi is cooked and it's delightful. We found by accident and will definitely be back. Met the owner and she explained the concept to us beautifully. Our food looked and tasted great. I was so happy. Chicken Cordon-Bleu sushi. YES YES YES."}
{"text":"MV Snacks and Sushi is a little eatery hidden in the faded looking Radio Shack plaza behind the Filibertos. The restaurant itself is in an odd little section of the strip mall with a copier business, a hair salon, and a barber shop.  The menu consists of Mexican style snacks, sushi rolls, and desserts. The sushi rolls are similar to Las Vegas rolls in which they are breaded and deep fried with cream cheese.  We walked in and were acknowledged by a curt nod by someone working here, possibly one of the owners? The interior is simple but neatly appointed with IKEA furniture. There seemed to be an air of tension about the room though as the cashier (Who was maybe the other owner?) had to attend to a crying sobbing kid sitting in a chair behind the counter, possibly her daughter?   The menu is extensive with Spanish and English descriptions of the items. I noticed that although there were a plethora of options for the sushi rolls almost all of them had shrimp in them, were deep fried, and all of them had cream cheese in them. In general, there only seemed to be minor distinguishing characteristics between all the rolls since they all appeared very similar.  We placed an order for carne asada fries, an MV roll, a spicy roll, horchata, and a diet Coke. We checked our receipt after we sat down and noticed we were never rung up for the spicy roll so I went to the cashier again.  I said to her that we had ordered a spicy roll with our meal but it wasn't rung up on the receipt. The cashier then looked at the receipt, parroted what it said and looked at me. I said \"Yes but we wanted another roll, the spicy roll.\" With brow furrowed, she then awkwardly acknowledged a \"Sorry about that I only heard the MV roll.\"  So I went back to my original request.  \"I'd like to order the spicy roll\"  \"The chili roll?\"  (I pointed to the part of the menu board where it said spicy roll) \"The spicy roll, with the chilis in it. The one that says horneados after it.\"  Apparently even the cashier has a hard time recognizing the distinguishing characteristics of the menu because she rang up the chili roll when I checked the receipt again after sitting down. Looking at the menu the spicy roll is essentially the chili roll but baked (horneados) with sauce on top. Seeing as that the cashier seemed to have other things on her mind than to actually hear what I was trying to say to her, we decided to keep it simple, let it go and eat it regular style instead of baked like we had wanted.  The carne asada fries ($8) came out first. It was a huge mound of fries, carne asada, pico de gallo, pickled jalapeños and cheese. The starchy lightly crisp fries went well with the earthy deep marinated flavor of the carne asada and the fresh pico de gallo provided a nice temperature and texture difference. The gooey melted cheese was perfect.  The MV roll then was next. The roll seemed to go on forever it was so long! It was lightly breaded and fried, with chicken, beef, bacon, cream cheese, cucumber, avocado, and manchego cheese. The main components of the roll that I could taste were the crunch of the outer breading, the slightly mushy rice, cream cheese, beef and bacon. The chili roll looked similar in size but had shrimp and chilis with cream cheese, avocado and cucumbers in it. I was confused by the shrimp. Did they mean to make them raw or cooked? They tasted like they were halfway between the two states. Kind of odd if you aren't able to cook (Or not cook?) shrimp if it is such a ubiquitous ingredient on your menu, no?  The horchata I had was too sweet for my tastes, but it did help cool down the slight spiciness from the chiles in the chili roll and the spicy heat from the roasted peppers that came with the rolls.  I was sadly disappointed here. I want to help out small businesses as much as I can but unfortunately I wasn't impressed with my experience. Hopefully in time they'll improve on a few things."}
{"text":"My wife loves this place so for her birthday I invited a bunch of her friends and we went for dinner. I called ahead to make sure that they could take us. The lady I spoke to was very friendly and assured there would be no issue. We arrived and everything was great. It wasn't busy that evening and our party basically occupied the entire place. We arrived later than others so they had already ordered and the food was starting to come out. The wait was short and the food was good. I ended up having some to bring home. Everyone seemed to have a good time and enjoyed their meal. It was my first time having Mexican sushi and I will be back."}
{"text":"Stopped by Saturday afternoon and I was the only customer. I ordered a spicy roll and Coke. The place is nice and clean. The cook looked angry the whole time, but the cashier was nice. TV on the wall didn't have anything on it and there was Latin music playing. The cashier gave me an impromptu lesson in how to eat Mexican sushi which I appreciate as I have never done it. I really did enjoy the food. It was a different experience. Recommended!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I really enjoyed this place. The food was great and it was definitely unlike anything we've had before. My girlfriend had the cordon Bleu roll and I had the nacori roll. I would recommend both, but if you're not crazy about sea food, the cordon Bleu is pretty good.   Check out this hidden gem and try this new take on mexican food and sushi."}
{"text":"Attention all my Arizona people! Are you sitting down? Well sit down! I'm going to brag to you about a new place i just found up the street. It's called Mv Snacks. It's all about Mexican style sushi and snacks. I saw this place last weekend and I had a hunch that it was going to be good. Man was I right! And what an understatement! The food was great and the concept is original. The place was clean and the employees were friendly. I had a chance to meet the owner. She has good business acumen and she's sharp. But lest you get the idea that she's new to the business think again. She's been catering for close to half a decade. And the proof is in the product. Check out my photos but most importantly give them a try! And remember, you heard it here first!"}
{"text":"Do not let the outside complex be the judge of whether or not you try this place, the inside is not what you expect when you walk in! The people are amazingly friendly and the food is really good! Do not be afraid to give this place a try, you will be glad you did!"}
{"text":"Riquisimooo, si van a este lugar tienen que probar el Vaquero Sushi roll, y el Aloha, tienen rollos super diferentes y ricos... Recomendadisimo..."}
{"text":"No recomiendo mucho este restaurante si estas buscando rapides encuanto al servicio serefiere, los postres como las fresas con crema son caras y no abria problema si fueran caras siempre y cuando fueran naturales ricas y telas dieran rapido, pero son fresas conjeladas y la crema esta espantosa!!!!... el sushi si es mui bueno pero tambien demasiadisimo tardado para que teloden, pedi solo 1 suchy y setardaron 30 minutos en aserlo!!, eso es demasiado, es poreso que no recomiendo este lugar."}
{"text":"Came here with my daughters to try something different, we tried two California rolls, the cashier mixed eel, soy, and Chipotle sauce for us to try with our rolls and it was really good. One of my daughters loved it and the other wasn't really into it, I liked the rolls especially with the sauce mixture. We usually go to Kabuki or Benihana for traditional sushi, but this place was pretty good and it's a lot closer to where we live. I would say this place is worth checking out if you're in the area. We will definitely give this place another try, next time I want to try the Vaquero roll."}
