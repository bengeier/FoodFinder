{"text":"Outstanding Indian cuisine!!    My work colleagues from India (both vegetarian and meat-eating) recommended Tadka as the place they go to when they eat out.  So the wife and I checked it out for our anniversary dinner.     The restaurant is in Great Northern Mall, next to the Best Buy, so parking is plentiful.   Its actually two restaurants; the other is Bamboo Garden (Chinese).    The Tadka side has an open floor plan; it has many 4-person tables with built-in seats, and a row of booths.   A large bar dominates the rear.   We arrived ca 530pm on Friday and had the place to ourselves.  Service was extremely attentive.   We were seated immediately; we chose a booth, which seats you quite low relative to the tabletop.   It was a bit awkward but not unpleasant enough to request a table.       The waiter brought us menus and a complimentary appetizer of spicy (maybe 4 out of 10) chickpeas; these were VERY welcome to my heat-loving tastebuds.  We also sampled the keema samosa and potato-cashew rolls.  This samosa pastry was very similar to filo, holding delicious minced lamb.  The potato-cashew rolls looked like hush puppies but tasted infinitely better - they practically melted in our mouths.  Neither of these was spicy in the chili sense, just full of flavor.  The main courses were equally impressive - marvelous flavors without fire.   We ordered Murgh Kalimirch (chicken with cashew nut paste) and Daal Tadka (lentils in ginger garlic cream).   Rice wasn't included, so we ordered 1 basmati rice - this was plenty for 2 people.   We also ordered Masala Papadam, which came with a thick garnish of sliced tomatoes and other vegetables.  The garnish was tasty but made it imperative to eat the papadam before it became waterlogged.     We gorged ourselves and had enough left over for two meals apiece.   And the total bill was $60 including tip.    We're not waiting a year to return!"}
{"text":"This was my first time eating here and I was happy with it.  The food was okay and plentiful. The d√©cor of the restaurant was nice.  The waitress was nice and helpful -- we had the recommendation she made from a menu that was a bit difficult to navigate. I'm not a huge fan of Indian food, but it seemed to be okay. My friend loved it and is ready to go back immediately. I can take it or leave it.  There just didn't seem to be the special something that makes me want to go back."}
{"text":"This review is for Bamboo Garden/ Tadka.  They are both essentially the same restaurant, prepared by the same chefs.  The buffet held at Bamboo Gardens has a fusion of foods from both restaurants.  The decor is great, but that's about it.  Honestly, the food was crap.  Over salted, lacking quality,  lack luster service a few times.  If you want to go to an Indian restaurant based on decor, go here.  You can have a blast staring at their decorations.  If you want to go to an Indian restaurant based on amazing food, and decent decor, go to Flavors of India, located down the street from this place."}
{"text":"Worst service, worst response, I had to wait for 15 min to get water and occupancy was just 10%....!!!!!  Only visit if you are ok with 45 min of wait time for order and another 30 min for food  Very disappointed"}
{"text":"Ok, let me preface this review by stating I have Celiac's. If I eat gluten I get sick. Dinner becomes a not great experience after a few hours. You can stop reading now if you see where this review is headed and don't feel like my issues are relatable to you. Back to the review. After walking in on the Indian side of the restaurant with my sister and seeing literally no one in the seating area at 6:00pm on a Sunday, we were a little nervous. We tracked down a waiter at the bar on the Bamboo Garden side (1 restaurant - 2 sides, 2 entrances, but they connect in the middle). We were seated in a booth only slightly above ground level and given menus. Being somewhat familiar with Indian dishes and starving after Christmas shopping, we made some selections - birbali shorba (very zesty) and samosa (VERY SPICY) to start. I explained, \"I'm allergic to wheat, my sister can't have nuts\". We were planning on sticking with curry dishes with rice for me and some naan for my sister. The waiter assured me the sauces were prepared only with spices, no wheat, flour, nothing. Granted I've eaten Indian before with success, so I knew which dishes had been previously safe.  But we were trying a new place, specializing in southern Indian flavors. My sister tried the Alu Ghobi (not on the menu but still offered if you ask) and the Chicken Tikka Masala (which was delicious). I tried the Lamb Saag (again, not on the menu but offered) which was the best buttery spinach version I've ever had, as well as the Chettinad an earthy dish with whole chilies. The rice was a bit of a disappointment as it was a tad over done, and the spices cooked with it weren't my taste. By the time we had finished our meal and packed up our many leftovers, more customers had joined us so we didn't feel so strange and alone. All was well...until a couple hours later. I'm not sure where I went wrong, if there indeed was gluten in one of the sauces, or what not. All my cherished leftovers had to be thrown away. I would have given the restaurant 3 stars with a warning to fellow celiacs, but then I remembered the bathroom at the restaurant. Let's just say I've seen nicer bathrooms as truck stops. So 2 stars is the best I can do for my personal review."}
{"text":"We just tried to eat here and I'm pretty sure it's closed.  All the tables were pushed together, it was dark, and nobody was there. At 6:30 p.m.... On a Monday."}
{"text":"Weird new setting, before we used to go we could order chinese and Indian food at same time , doesn't matter where we sit. I went today and my whole family of 7 had to go back empty stomach as they don't allow both cuisine at one place. We can only pick one. Such a disappointment! We are local north Olmsted resident . Now this restaurant is no use for our nice family dinner."}
{"text":"Great attentive service with a wonderful buffet selection. Be sure to try a bit of everything as I did my first time here. Spacious dining area and a decor that matches the essence of the true Indian flavors."}
{"text":"I love Indian cuisine and have tried a few in the area but this was my first time here. . I ordered at 745 and was told the wait for my carry out order would be 35 minutes.  When I arrived, I was told I was \"early\" when in fact It was 5 minutes early.  I then waited an additional 20 minutes.  I ordered the Chicken Makani amd the Palek Paneer.  The chicken was all gristle and had bones and skin and there were literally 5 small pieces of chicken in it which was of very Poor quailty compared to others I've had  The sauce had a good flavor though.  The Palek Paneer lacked flavor and was also lacking Paneer, which for $13.00 should've been more of it!  I will not be going back to Tadka."}
{"text":"This is probably the best Indian place in Cleveland area. Their lunch buffet is great. What I liked the most is that the food is always fresh. Unlike other places that often serve stale food. Decor is simple and clean with ample seating."}
{"text":"Food full of Oil and Grease..  I am a lover of Indian food, however this place is real bad - they deceive the taste by putting more oil, you end up with stomach full of Gas later.  There is OLD Indian lady in this place (waiter, owner.. God knows..), is full of ATTITUDE and can be rude. My Indian friends told me, she treats brown people different - RACIST!!"}
{"text":"After a horrendous experience more than a year ago, we have been to this place few times now. Food quality has definitely improved. The taste, flavors and overall quality of food is now very good. We have had their buffet as well as a la carte Punjabi and Indochinese food. And there is consistency in quality. This place did have one of the best ambience of an Indian restaurant in the Cleveland area. They do have new serving staff which is a good change.  But they do have that one guy who casually puts food on your table without a smile or even saying anything.  They still don't check on you to see if everything is OK like most restaurants do.   Just ignore the poor service and go for the food!!"}
{"text":"Update:   Great weekend buffet dosas! Improved service..."}
{"text":"Went here recently with a bunch of co-workers, mostly to try and expose several of them to Indian for the first time.  The Tadka buffet has an extensive selection of dishes to choose from as well as a chef making fresh-made dosas and other rice-based savory pancakes.  The buffet consisted of many of your favorite items (like tandoori chicken and paneer) along with a few I'd never had before and a (small) selection of Chinese items from the Bamboo Gardens side of the house.  Most of their dishes are on the hotter (i.e., spicier) side of the other buffets I've had around town, but many of my Indian colleagues swear by this place as the most authentic tasting of them all.  A little on the pricier side, but a fine meal with plenty of options to choose from."}
{"text":"I was most pleased with my lunch today. Many hours later, and I am still feeling full which is great for me. I went to the Lunch Buffet today at Tadka, by Great Northern Mall in the strip that is adjacent to the mall. The restaurant was booming and I was the only Caucasian there and I really could not care. There are a lot of options for sure and since it was the weekend, it was Dosa day, I was not taken by these crepe like concoctions but there was many being made so it must be a regional thing. The lunch buffet; it had the usual suspects; butter chicken, Tandoori Chicken (Many small bones so be wary with the youthful diners you may drag with you), rice, and naan. No samosa but that is okay. They had some different options from what is normally seen with the indian offering such as Chicken 65 which is one of my all-time favorites, into-chinese gingery chicken which when accompanied by the cilantro egg rice; most special, they also had a takka fish item that was great. They also had a biryani that had a fruitful favor which is something that I am not used to; I typically have a heavy seasoned hydrabadi, but it was a nice touch and it was full of chicken and others. I am allergic to nuts, woe to me, but I have to ask every time that I go out for Indian food. This does not disappoint in that they did not understand what I meant and did not really know for sure. That is okay and almost expected now, the only place that is on top of that is the Bombay Sitar, which is quick to point out the few with nuts. There was also chili noodles that were spicer, the remainder of the food was not spicy to indian standards, American, sure. I would say the level is about a 2 out of 5 indian on most and that is a stretch. That is not a bad thing though to cater to everyone. The Dosas have a marsala option and another which I did not recognize. The naan was well cooked and flexible so not like a rice cake that you bend it and break.  Paneer and lentil options were good, there are a lot of meat options and few vegetarian but both were being exchanged quickly so no problems there unless you are a vegetarian. Onion Pakoda was not as flaky and chewy as others, I prefer crispy padoka but there was subtle, where it was not taking like a deep friend item but instead tasted smoothly of the onion inside. It was $32 for two and they came around enough to satisfy but not to notice. You pay at the register and the plates are at the buffet. You can order a la carte I think too during this time. It was quite busy around 1pm so obviously people agree this place is gear. Not bad, but if you have the means, Bombay Sitar in Canton is my favorite that I have had yet albeit the real thing homemade."}
{"text":"Very scary walked in and walked out! Went to the rail instead!"}
{"text":"The serve is exceptional here. The server was very attentive. The food is fantastic. It is bursting with flavor. I highly recommend the naan. Its served hot. I had the chicken tiki masala and it was very good. Their rice really makes it. I enjoyed the mango lassi; but it was honestly a little too sweet. The decor is very cool, and the seating is comfortable. The manager was kind enough to come over fora chat and ensure everything was fine. The only suggestion I have is they need music. The place is deafeningly quite."}
{"text":"Nice decor, friendly and attentive waitstaff, and good quality Indian food make for a pleasant experience. Not the best Indian place I've ever been, but certainly worth a return visit."}
{"text":"We've eaten at Tadka twice now, and they definitely do not disappoint!  Tadka serves very good Northern Indian cuisine, in a hip, low key atmosphere. Portions are huge; large enough that they could be shared by 2 people. The waitstaff are very nice, attentive, but not intrusive.  Tadka is easily our favorite Indian restaurant in Cleveland."}
{"text":"While this is my first check in and review this was supposed to be our forth or fifth time here. You used to be able to order from with here or Bamboo Gardens next door which was how we used to do since I am not a fan of Indian cuisine. Apparently that is no longer allowed so we will not be returning. They have lost our business. Very sad."}
{"text":"Have been a few times.  The restaurant is connected to Inchin's Bamboo Garden  next door.  You can order from either menu.  First time I went hear was because the Inchin's Bamboo Garden  was booked for a party.  The had a Indian buffet.  We were able to try different things.  There is one word for this place SPICY!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants to taste both Indian and Chinese food (Bamboo Garden).  Buffet is delicious with wide range of varieties of both non-veg and veg. It also include soups, cakes and sweet dishes  like Gulab Jamun, Rasgulla, etc. $15 /person for buffets its worth it.  So also in afternoons you will also get chaats which are my favorite."}
{"text":"We went here on a Friday evening with friends and had a great time. This place is really good for large groups, we had a one year old with us and they were very accommodating. There are a few different types of sauces at the table to try on any of the foods and a little bowl of some really spicy peppers that you can put in soup if you're brave. We got chicken 65 and something else sort of like a falafel mixed with a hush puppy as appetizers. The Chicken 65 was especially amazing. I had to make myself stop eating and save room for the main course. So then we got two types of curry and I don't remember what along with garlic and butter naan and rice. The naan!! Wow. I could have been having just that. The curries were both very good too. We also ordered rice but no one really wanted it when the other choice was naan. It was delicious and we were so full. We also tried the Kingfish beer which we really liked. Then we got Gulab Jamun (I think) which are like better than donut balls served real warm in a syrup. They were amazing and I was even already full. We also got mango lassi to have the next day. We all had a great time. The couple we went with are Indian and lived there in India until their 20s and they say it is their favorite Indian place around Cleveland. I want to come back and try the buffet some time."}
{"text":"no reviews yet?   i'll start the ball rolling.    very good northern indian cuisine. the 4 of us shared a comfy, somewhat low booth and enjoyed the low-key stylish ambiance.  waiters all very nice and attentive.  we had several curries (fish, palak paneer, chicken tikka) with tasty naan and rice.   portions were large.     all 4 of us loved the food and the fact that we now have a good  indian place in north olmsted.   good solid northern indian food in a hip atmosphere.   what's not to like?"}
{"text":"This is a great place which reminds you of good Indian Chinese food and Great north Indian Punjabi food...  I have never been to the buffet (as such I am not a fan of buffets in general) but I have catered from them too... great catering, great service and really good courteous staff!"}
{"text":"I had the Vindaloo Curry chicken set on medium. It was absolutely perfect, my partner had the Tandoori chicken, which I have never had and he gave me a piece, it was great too! No complaints whatsoever, love the mom and pop places. Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"Nice decor, friendly service and excellent flavors. The samosas were among the best I've had and the cilantro-infused hariyali tikka from the tandoori oven was both succulent and sophisticated. Some \"mild\" dishes were still too spicy for the kids so go for non-spicy dishes if that's an issue. The total dinner bill -- without alcohol or dessert -- came to about $90 with tip for a family of four. We look forward to going back again!"}
{"text":"Tadka deserves more than the current 3-star rating it has! Don't be discouraged, Yelpers. I came in for the lunch buffet after debating whether or not to try it, and it was really good. I'm glad I did. They have a buffet every day, 7 days per week, and it is huge. $15 per person, a little higher than most Indian buffets BUT they have about 15 different dishes to try, since it is also combined with Inchin Chinese restaurant.    The service was very good. Everyone was friendly and drinks were filled up constantly. When I was paying, I told the waitress how delicious the food was and she seemed so excited to hear it.    Definitely get out your stretchy pants for this one, and come hungry!"}
{"text":"I was feeling down and needed a hot pick me up with some Indian food... This place had it!!!  I had a traditional goat dish with rice, with Samosa appetizer, I was very happy with the quality of the food!  The service was less then great, but still very good:)  There was more than enough for next days lunch."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed.  I've been here several times with my family and we consider it the best Indian buffet on this side of town (always weekend buffet). This last visit the other day was quite disappointing. All vegetarian dishes were fatty and fried: deep fried okra, deep fried potatoes.  Also the dishes were heavily salted and very spicy. I think I have become disillusioned with the quality especially since it is upwards of 15 to 20 dollars for lunch buffet."}
{"text":"Very stylish, clean decor, one of the larger buffet spreads I've seen at an Indian restaurant, plus a chaat buffet and made-to-order dosa. This place had so much promise.  Specializing in Indian and Chinese cuisine (and even some Thai dishes), they do a lot of things, but none of them particularly well unfortunately. I tried every single dish out of the 15 or so available and didn't enjoy a single one. I was full, though, so I got that going for me. I guess if you want to stuff yourself silly and still not really be satisfied somehow, then Tadka is for you. Tadka is not for me.  You can find cheaper, better options elsewhere. $15 for what is essentially filler food is not worth it."}
{"text":"As a brown person forever in search of good Indian food, Tadka is probably the best place in Cleveland. Their weekend buffet serves south Indian food (dosas), chaat, and a mix of Indian and Indo-Chinese food, which are all very good! My favorites include the dosas and the chicken 65. Come for lunch and be happily sleepy/full for the rest of the day!"}
{"text":"Great find in Cleveland! The ambiance is awesome, and especially good for a large group.  The service is excellent and servers are accommodating. Both the Indian and Indian Chinese cuisines are great here- we had a variety of dishes."}
{"text":"I've had India food a few times in my life before and was never a big fan of it.  However I decided to be adventurous today.  The Food here overall is pretty good if you like spicy, saucy, or not a big meat eater then this place is for you. They do India type food right.  On weekends they have pancake/crepe like station where the chef can add India type food ie. potatoe/pea curry.  I had a quite a few of these as they are quite tasty.   Plenty of Nan and a ton of choices.. probably twice as much as flavors of India.  Afterwards me and my wife were stuffed and had our stomach's turned upside down because we weren't use to so much variety of spices and sauces but in a good way.  If you love India food I would definitely check it out.... as for me it has changed my opinion of India food for the better...."}
{"text":"What an exciting find! The food was delicious and the servers so kind and attentive. Loved the dosas so much and can't wait to go back and try more things on the menu."}
{"text":"The service and ambiance was great. The food was only mediocre. It seems like they probably use jarred / pre-made curry sauces, etc. rather than making the items fresh-to-order. This place is just so-so, but at least clean and a good atmosphere."}
{"text":"Can I fangirl for a sec?  Love Tadka! Love! I haven't had Indian food this good since I moved home from London. I am sure there are other good Indian restaurants in the Cleveland area; I just haven't found them yet.   Both Tadka and the Chinese restaurant next door have a sleek modern vibe to their decor (as sleek and modern as you can in a strip mall); probably hoping to cater to new audiences. However, when we walked in - on a Friday night - the place was empty save two small tables. The host cast my mom and I a sideways glance and asked \"Are you here for Indian or Chinese? Cos Chinese is next door.\" We assured him we were there for the curry and were shown to our very long, very low booth.   Our waiter ending being the manager, possibly the owner, so I went with my gut and had him select our courses. He asked our likes and dislikes and went about with suggestions. We started with an \"amuse bouche\" for lack of a better term of chana masala. It was tasty and pleasant way to start the meal. We moved on to our appetizers: samosas and tandoori lamb. The samosas were perfect - crisp, flaky exterior; soft, pillowy interior - and huge! It was the tandoori lamb that stole the show for the entire evening. Four tender chops heartily seasoned with tandoori spice. I think they were too spicy for dear mom - I do believe her spice tolerance has decreased with age (I hope she's not reading this...). They were amazing - perfectly cooked with just the right amount of gamey-ness in the lamb. And yes, you do need a little bit of gamey with lamb otherwise you might as well order beef (but I guess you wouldn't in an Indian restaurant, but anyway...).  After our starters we split a basket of regular and garlic nan (don't kiss anyone for at least 24 hours after), plain basmati and tikka masala. I know, tika masala is about as authentic as I am, but it's still tasty and a good intro for mom. Everything was amazing and there was plenty to take home for lunch the next day for both of us. Can you believe it all came to under $40?   The manager/owner also surprised us with a complimentary dessert. Now who doesn't love that?"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time today for the lunch buffet.  The people were exceptionally nice, and the place is exceptionally neat and clean.    The food was very good, and they have a variety of Indian and Chinese dishes.  .  I had the paneer and went back for a lentil dish.  Also had the rice and naan, which was very fresh.   The only reason I deducted one star is because I would have liked to seen more Indian vegetarian choices. There seemed to be an over abundance of chicken dishes. However, I will definitely be back. The food is that good!"}
{"text":"I came in here yesterday with a friend to try this place out. I'm giving it a 3 star rating because of a few things that might be due to my American ignorance. We split an order of the veggie Samosas. The flavor was overall amazing and a bit spicy. (No complaints about that one bit). The only draw back was when I took a bite, I bit into a cold chunk of potato. Other than that it was pretty tasty. My entree was the Chicken Makhani. While the gravy was quite tasty, I wish they would have strained it because every bite I took I either was spitting out a clove or other spice. The chicken was a little burnt and made some fat or cartilage attached. I also ordered some garlic naan too. That was tasty but it too was also burnt badly around the edges. Overall it was an average experience but I'm going to go back and give it another shot."}
{"text":"This place is excellent!! And I'm from the north of England, so I've had many good Indian meals."}
{"text":"The buffet is spicier than other Indian buffets in the Northeast Ohio area. They have Chinese food as well since the buffet for Tadka is hosted in the connected eatery, Inchin's Bamboo Garden. They have fruit for dessert as well as fruit custard, sticky donut balls and a Tapioca drink. The buffet is yummy and is around $15.00. I went with my friend on Christmas day and it was packed way past the lunch closing time!"}
{"text":"The only Indian restaurant I've been to that isn't capable of using coconut milk in curry."}
{"text":"Great ambience. I was in hurry so I ordered takeout and the Portion size was huge. The quality was also great. Highly recommended.They were little backed up due to crowd."}
{"text":"I went here recently with my hubby, food was okay, very oily, and waiters dont really listen to your orders and they are rude ,they also behave differently with indians and americans."}
{"text":"First will start with the seating arrangement..chair/table were so low & uncomfortable to sit & eat..now coming to food..we ordered chicken hakka noodle & veg manchurian..the guy told me that they have thick noodle, but he gave me thin vermicelli type noodle..taste was average though..chicken manchurian was also ok..not bad. We tried in tadka columbus which was horrible. Now after trying here, i am confirmed they are bad everywhere. I will never ever visit this restaurant again."}
{"text":"So I went here once and had their buffet and was blown away. So I took my friend from out of town here for his birthday. Ordering off the menu is not an easy task. First off for the first 20 minutes we were the only customers in the restaurant. The waiter/ bartender/ pretty much everything there kept walking away while we were talking to him. Then when we went to order he second guessed everything. I asked for the Aloo Vindaloo and he said: that is spicy. I said I know I have had it several times. My friend then ordered off of the chinese food menu and the waiter stared at him and said, what? you don't like indian food? The waiter also questioned my fiance's order when explaining her the dish several times when she acknowledged she understood what she was ordering. We ordered the potato cashew rolls only to be disappointed that they had no flavor. They just tasted like unseasoned mashed potatoes.  I then went to the bathroom and when came out the main dishes were on the table. I asked my fiance and my friend to taste mine and asked \"does this taste like there is milk in there? I am vegan so i specifically ordered my food to ensure there was no dairy. When the waiter came back he asked if I liked it, and I said \"Yes. It is good, but-\" And he cut me off and said he changed my order and mixed it with another curry. I asked him if there was dairy in it and he asked me why. I told him I am a vegan and then he proceeded to say it was my fault I did not tell him. Why should I have to tell him when I ordered a curry that did not have dairy in it to begin with? Who changes someones order and doesn't ask? Then not only did he charge me for all of the curry's he brought me (he insisted on not just bringing me the Aloo Vindaloo, which by the way tasted burnt, but another chickpea curry. so I was charged for 2 Aloo Vindaloos and a chickpea curry and whatever curry was mixed in the first one) but I was also charged for 2 different rice dishes because someone brought us plain basmati rice instead of the cumin basmati rice we ordered. My bill ended up being outrageous but I couldn't even discuss it because the waiter would just walk away. A friend came later on and asked for a dirty martini and got something clear in a martini glass. When he asked for some olives they told him they do not have olives. We were afraid to ask how they even attempted to make the martini dirty. I will never go back to this place again. It was a horrible experience. The only upside is that we could laugh about how horrible it was after we had some drinks at the applebees next door."}
{"text":"So I do try and hit up Indian places when I'm craving the food so I went here because my fianc√©'s grandfather was talking about this place and said it was very good lol So we convinced his mom to take a trip here and have Indian for the first time.   The place is very big but it's also connected with a Chinese food place next door so it's a bit confusing when you walk in. But I did like the overall atmosphere of the place. Nice and relaxing, looked really clean too. The bathrooms were immaculate too lol We were literally the only people in there at this time so I can tell ya the service was fast haha   I ordered the chicken tikka masala because I'm a coward and always order that when I want Indian food haha. I also had naan bread and we ordered two appetizers. My usual- vegetable samosa and something different this time. I can't remember the name of it but it was a fried patty type hash brown thing that had spinach and potato inside it and it was really good! You'll see it on the menu under appetizers - you can't miss it. Just read the description.   My only complaint- I asked for mild sauce (I know I'm a wimp) but the sauce was pretty hot actually. I'd say it was more on the medium side. I still ate it but I just hate chugging my water or soda after every bite. I like to enjoy the taste of my food- not burn my tongue.  But overall- it was delicious! And we had tons of left overs haha"}
{"text":"Best Indian food in the entire OHIO! Absolutely love the curries! The quantities are good and the staff is awesome. Try the hara bhara kabab, paneer tikka masala and malai kofta. The naan are soft and freshly made. A must try!"}
{"text":"This is the place I was first introduced to Indian food and I have been coming back ever since. My favorite is the chicken makhani. The menu has a great variety and the best part is asking the waiter/waitress for recommendations. I would recommend to anyone. Great service and great food."}
{"text":"Came in and ordered a three course meal with my family with soup, some paratha, and chicken Tikka and rasmalai.  The service was the worst ever and the food was not on point. The \"birbali shorba\" was basically hit water with some food coloring. So I told them to cancel that order as soon as I tasted one spoon. The server said it cannot be done so I told her to call the manager. Some other server came and asked me what's going and I told him simply wanted to cancel my soup order. He said it can't be done so I told him to call the manager.  Both the servers failed to do so and never came back to fill our waters. For a place with less than authentic Indian food and incompetent illegal employees that work under the table, a one star rating will suffice. Not my first time eating here with my family with and experiencing bad service. There are several other times where a larger Indian gentleman with a mustache took our order without writing it down and brought us back the wrong order. I hope the management will hear out these complaints and take them into consideration.   Pros: Excellent ambience  Great decor  Clean  Warm  Smells good!"}
{"text":"Tadka is probably the best place in Cleveland for Indian food. large selection of foods, great decor and atmosphere.You can get both the Indian and Indian Chinese cuisines here."}
{"text":"Major changes happened since I was here last. If I'm not mistaken they're now under new management. Tadka and Inchin's Bamboo Garden are now totally separate. We use to be able to sit on the Tadka side and order my favorite chicken 65 from the IBG side, not anymore. Also they don't have a liquor license anymore so...  This time around we sat in the Tadka side and the food was very good. No issues at all. The menu has a great selection and it was served pretty quickly. We'll be back for sure but next time we'll sit over on the IBG side because the food there is top notch too."}
{"text":"The food at the buffet was cold. We spoke to the staff about it but they seemed helpless. Not going back."}
{"text":"Best South Indian Buffet (esp Saturday and Sunday) in the Cleveland area.  It's not your typical American Indian food with Tikka Masalas, Mutter Panneers, etc...it's much better than that!  Dosas, Chaat and a huge buffet with spiced meats, currys, etc.    I especially liked the option to have a Dosa made fresh in front of us.  Pack it in without the cheese (that's the American flavor) and enjoy the coconut or tamarind sauces with it.  Yum!"}
{"text":"This review is based on the lunch buffet only.  This place has easily one of the top 3 Indian buffets in Cleveland!  They have a huge selection of Indian and Indo-Chinese food to pick from on the buffet.  Everything from the typical warm, fluffy naan, vegetable fritters, Tandoori Chicken, Curry Chicken, and Chicken Briyani to Szechuan Lamb, Mongolian chicken, Chili Pepper Chicken, and these fried fish things.  They also have soup, and bread pudding, kheer (rice pudding), fruit custard, and fresh fruit for dessert.   The buffet includes a dosa station where you have your choice or 6 or so dosa varieties that are made right in front of you!  Dosas are a large, thin crepe rolled up with savory ingredients like paneer, curry potatoes, masala, or a number of other fillings that I have yet to try.  They offer two kinds of dipping sauces to accompany your dosa.  Although Tadka is a chain restaurant, it really is good and the variety of dishes offered on the buffet can't be beat!  Each time I've gone, the place has been filled with Indian customers, so you KNOW it's a good place! :P  Service is great in that they clear your plates and refill your water quickly.  The decor is really snazzy and modern looking and the restaurant is very clean.  The weekend lunch buffet is a bit more than other Indian buffets around Cleveland at $15, (used to be $13) but the variety of dishes makes it worth it!   I'm glad I don't live closer, or I'd come here more often and start packing on the pounds rather quickly!"}
