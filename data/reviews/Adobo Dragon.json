{"text":"I had the chicken and pork bao and it was absolutely delicious. I will definitely be back the next time I'm in Phoenix!!"}
{"text":"This place is freaking weird. Came here after seeing the rave reviews.. Idk how anyone can call this place a restaurant, it's more like a mall food court. The menu is tiny. Two entrees, water, and one pork bao was $30+.. The salmon bento box came out cold and the shrimp in the curried noodles was oddly soft and unpleasant. We sent the box back and are currently waiting while they refund us because it was taking forever to reheat the salmon. The only thing \"Latin\" on my noodles was a sprinkle of what looked like chicharrones. Wound up throwing the noodles out and cancelling the salmon. Giving two starts because the pork bao wasn't bad. But.. even that feels gratuitous."}
{"text":"I went to Adobo Dragon the first time and loved it.  I have since brought friends and family members and they cannot wait to come back to Phoenix and return there. The food is great. I have tasted all the menu options and love it. The fresh salad, crisp and light; the mushroom vegan bao is super and tasty.  The chef explained the options and was very informative.  The cerviche was excellent.  It has become my favorite place to go.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I tried the beef bento box and wasn't disappointed. My picky 9 year old also enjoyed it. It's hard to get beef moist and they somehow did it without compromising the flavors. We will be back again."}
{"text":"I hang out at Desoto at least once a week but I have never tried Adobo Dragon, in retrospect I don't know why! I had the chicken and salmon bao and it was pretty tasty. I had it for lunch, it was light and refreshing. The customer service was great too, very friendly and helpful. I have to say I am a sucker for great customer service. I am glad I gave it a chance and will be trying other menu items on my next visit. They are worth given a try."}
{"text":"Wow I came into the new Dodge cabaret of food offerings and came across this gem of a find. This is asian meets Mexico.  Wow the Bao (Chinese style bread taco puff) was filled with delicious morsels of Pork and one with Chicken.  With a side of mixed unique greens and a light vinegar salad, wow.  I am so impressed with what they have done with food in less then 400 sf.  I certainly will be back to try the Bento Box and the Tapas.  For $9.50 you can't miss.   Bravo to the owner Allan for his creative approach to two fusions.  I am sure he will come up with other tidbits over time. Need a sweet desert to cool down the meal."}
{"text":"The idea is great and an interesting selection but I was just not blown away by what I ordered. My girlfriend and I ordered the curry noodles and was expecting to find noodles in a curry broth/sauce but instead found curried \"dry\" noodles. It wasn't bad but wasn't expecting something more. It was also more of a noodle salad then a curry. We also ordered the vegetarian spring roll which was good! With all this said, I don't think we'd come back. The food just didn't catch our attention."}
{"text":"Pork bao was so bland. The salad that came alongside just tasted of vinegar. Decent value and speed of service but the food was blah."}
{"text":"The food here was amazing.  The chicken bao had great flavor.  The chicken was tender and the mango salsa was fantastic.  The pork bao was also fantastic with the curry sauce.  I will definitely be back in the near future."}
{"text":"To those expecting chow mein, fried rice and burritos, please read the restaurant description again.  This is a latino-asian FUSION restaurant.    Upgrading my original 4 start review to 5 because of the new menu items!  AdoboDragon has been featuring weekly specials and has recently added Tapas to their menu.  Tapas are available starting at 4pm daily.  I love all the vegetarian/vegan friendly options they offer as well as the fish/seafood ones.  I am a vegetarian who eats the occasional fish/seafood so I haven't tasted their meat dishes.  However, the carnivore friends I brought to this place enjoyed the meat dishes.     Traditionally, baos are steamed buns with meat fillings.  The baos at adobo dragon are served like sandwiches with a choice of chicken, pork, beef, fish or vegetarian.  Each filling is indeed a marriage between asian and latino flavors."}
{"text":"This was my first time to here. My s/o and I got two meals and I was kind of disappointed.  We spent almost $30 on food and we weren't full. I really don't eat much in a sitting and I have never left a place still hungry,  but I was still very hungry!  I was actually hangry.  The cost of food is much too high for the amount.  The food was pretty good but I don't think I will return."}
{"text":"I was skeptical at first since i got the gift certificate from restaurant.com and seeing Desoto Market. I said sorry to my hubby for making the wrong choice. But when we get inside of the building, we were in awe as to the difference in appearance inside than outside. we found the stall where Adobo Dragon is. We were greeted by Allan Inocencio right away and introduced the menu to us. We ordered the Bao which is similar to steamed bun/ siopao...and we like it so much..we were impressed that my hubby planned to give his co workers a treat by catering them on the weekend... I would definitely recommend this to everyone. Theirs is one unique type of food that i'm sure people will love."}
{"text":"A refreshing change in the boring Phoenix cuisine. Highly recommended if want to liven up your palette instead of dining at some cookie cutter chain restaurant. Adobo Dragon is located in DeSoto Market which is was formally a DeSoto auto dealership. It's a wonderfully restored building with a quaint casual atmosphere."}
{"text":"2 1/2 stars. Tried 2 different tapas, the meatballs and the carnitas wonton. Wasn't too impressed with either. This was the issue I found with both, the meat in both isn't seasoned all too much. Kinda very plain tasting. Might come back to try the chao but then again I'm from Little Saigon in SoCal so...."}
{"text":"Straight fire!!!  This place is so good, it defys description. The carnitas is spot on and the plates are generous portions!"}
{"text":"Great little spot for a quick meal. The wings where cooked perfectly with an amazing Latino Asian flavor. Portions are fair and the owner was very cordial. I recommend it for a Sunday lunch since it's not so busy. Needed a spicier angle to their flavors. Ceviche was heavy with the tomatoes. Ok place."}
{"text":"Downtown for First Friday and was meeting friends at Desoto. I ordered from Adobo because they had an interesting menu. They were having a happy hour for First Friday so I ordered a bao. Had no idea what that was but when I asked the server said the veggie version was vegan. Ordered it and it was so good. It was a mini sandwich with sautéed veggies and mushrooms. The veggies were really well seasoned and the best part was the sandwich bread was steamed. It was puffy and light and the sandwich tasted super fresh. The restaurant is in an in door marketplace and you order at the counter. It's like a fancy food court. There is seating inside, outside and inside there are two levels of seating. This is a great spot for meeting up with a large groups and if people have different things they want to want to eat. When I came it was busier than usual because there was also a crafts market going on. They had jewelry, clothes, and stalls selling baklava to support Syrian refugees. I really liked the bao and I got my food pretty quickly. Recommend trying bao!"}
{"text":"This place is so good prices are reasonable so worth it get anything everything is great. I have come her 2 times in the past week."}
{"text":"We were trying to find somewhere to eat in downtown Phoenix when I remembered having bookmarked Desoto Market a while ago. We arrived and walked to the restaurant area where there was a yummy Asian food smell in the air! This is how we ended up in front of Adobo Dragon. Now, months ago, one of my friends had mentioned this restaurant to me, so when I saw this is where it was located, I couldn't pass up the opportunity to get something.  It's a very tiny place but as I mentioned, the food they were making smelled so good! Their menu offerings included a few different types of noodles, bao (steamed buns), as well as bento boxes. I was told that the most popular menu items are the Curried Noodles, Chicken Bao, & Chicken Bento Box. I decided to get the Curried Noodles & my fiancé got the Chicken Bao plate.  Firstly, the Curried Noodles were served with 4 grilled shrimp and a small side salad. The noodles had flavorful curry taste and the side salad had a vinaigrette to bring a lightness to the dish. I think the only mistake I made was not mixing up the noodles before eating because there was a bunch of curry on the bottom of my dish which I noticed only after most of the noodles were gone.  The star, by far, was the Chicken Bao though. I immediately regretted not getting those! The plate had two steamed buns and a small salad. The chicken itself had a lot of flavor and made a really tasty combination with the mango salsa. It didn't look like a lot of food, and I only had a couple of bites, but my fiancé said he felt really full after eating both.  We will definitely be back to try a couple of the other Bao options. The menu descriptions sounded really tempting for the salmon one as well as the vegetarian with sautéed mushrooms. They have happy hour specials for $3 as well!"}
{"text":"Get any of their bao.  It's so damn good.  That's really all I have to say about this place.  GET THE BAO!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and great service. Love everything I've eaten here. Fresh and flavorful!! I try to stop by anytime I'm downtown. Very fun place, parking can be weird if you aren't familiar with the area but i can normally find a spot on the south side of the building. Great place to bring friends and family and enjoy the atmosphere. If you are traveling from far to check this place out call to confirm there is not a private event going on, that happened to me once."}
{"text":"Pretty good. You don't find much Bao around here. Or bento boxes, so that is a good feature.  Friendly staff and quick service. Nicely cooked meat. Really small portions for the high prices."}
{"text":"Fantastic ramen. I also had the chicken wings and were definitely the best I have ever had. Ubereats turned me on to this place and I am hooked!"}
{"text":"Terrific Salmon Bento box!  Fresh, and couldn't believe the speed.  4 minutes delivery.  Friendly guy took order.  But... see my review on The Provisionary next door.  Sad attention, asleep at the wheel, and over rated sandwich for the money."}
{"text":"Went here for some posole ramen, carnitas wontons and the chili wings. Food was pretty good, but some of the flavors were not married well. Tasted like terriyaki chicken in posole which was kinda weird. I wish they would have made the broth a more Mexican Japanese blend. Would have been great! The wontons were delicious though!! And the wings were fresh and flavorful!"}

{"text":"I've visited here a couple of times now. If you haven't been, Adobo Dragon offers a menu consisting of Asian-Latino cuisine and is located in the heart of downtown Phoenix at DeSoto Market. They offer a variety of noodle bowls, tapas and baos. I ordered the curried noodles and a side of albondigas tapas my first time around. The noodle bowl was pretty flavorful. I felt it was a good-sized portion and the shrimp was nicely prepared. I felt I wanted a little more noodles in the bowl. The albondigas tapas were very tasty. I ordered a chicken and albondiga boa the second time I visited. The boa was perfectly steamed and had a nice texture to it. I also ordered Plantain mojo and found it surprising light and delicious. It came with a side of chips to scoop it up with. Both my experiences were met with great customer service. I really enjoy sitting at the counter and watching the cook fire up these creations while soaking in the fun atmosphere of DeSoto Market."}
{"text":"Its been about a week into DeSoto Central Market's opening as I write this.  When I came in on opening day the previous Saturday, this place was a madhouse.  Long lines, slow service, glitchy registers, pretty typical opening day bugs basically.  That said, the burger I had at DCM Burger was excellent.  Coming off of that, I decided to take a shot at trying another one of DeSoto's incarnations on a late Friday afternoon.  I was sure I'd find another long line waiting for me when I arrived.  But shockingly this time, it was basically dead.  Score for me.  Adobo Dragon caught my attention when I was here on opening day, but the line was so long I didn't bother.  Today, straight to the register I went.  There were a number of dishes on their menu I found intriguing so deciding between them was a chore.  The prices here are very reasonable which made me wonder whether I'd be getting kid sized portions of their different dishes.  So to play it safe I ordered three different items to go.  I got a small fish ceviche, a chicken bento box, and a bao platter with one chicken and one beef bao.  Total cost for all the food plus tax was about $28.  Food came out in about 5 minutes.  That whole thing about being worried about the portions?  Yeah, never mind.  There was no way I could finish all this food in one sitting.  So I dabbled into each as best I could before finishing them for lunch the next day.  For starters, the fish ceviche was pretty decent though WAY to tart in my opinion.  There were nice big chunks of fish along with peppers and fruit all coated with lime.  No problem with the fish or the accompanying fruit and veggies plus I like a little dousing of lime as much as anyone.  But they need to dial back on the lime as it was a little overwhelming.  Otherwise, a decent starter dish.  Next I tried the chicken bento box.  This chicken was grilled and shredded and cooked with caramelized onions, peppers and a chimichurri sauce.  Also came with a side of white rice as well as small sides of strawberries and greens.  This one was spot on and surprisingly it wasn't spicy at all.  The chicken was super tender and the chimichurri sauce gave the chicken and rice a great flavor contrast.  The fruit and greens were also both very fresh complimentary sides.  Lastly I dove into the bao platter (which also comes with fresh fruit and greens as well).  This my friends was a home run.  I've had asian steamed buns before once at Nobuo (also in Downtown Phoenix) and loved them, but Nobuo's skimps a little on the meat.  Not here.  Both buns were stuffed full of meat.  The chicken bao comes with mango salsa and a chimichurri sauce while the beef bao comes with a slaw and a light coat of sesame.  Both were ridiculously awesome and the buns were steamed to absolute perfection.  I did the right thing this time around by saving the best for last.  Overall, an impressive early impression from this new upstart concept at DeSoto.  While the meal I had wasn't perfect, each dish was full of interesting flavor combinations and the portions are quite generous.  Most of their dishes are $10 or less and are a great value for the price you pay.  Without question the bao platters are what I'll be coming back for.  Chef Allan Inocencio has created a fun innovative menu mixing Asian and Latin American favorites in a way that I haven't seen anyone else try thus far.  Here's hoping he continues to experiment with more innovative, tasty combinations."}
{"text":"They have almost changed their whole menu. Its sad to see their old yellow ceviches gone. Now they only have a seafood mix in a tomato sauce/broth. Don't get me wrong its still good but i loved the mango flavor ceviche and the option to have all shrimp.   Now for the star item. The Curried Noodles with Shrimp. I was craving something fresh and light yet different. This definitely hit all those requirements. The noodles were soft and fresh, the kale salad was definitely a compliment and the shrimp perfectly cooked and extremely magnificently seasoned(WOW!!). And the curry flavor of course tied everything together. Yes it had some oil but it did not bug me. When i saw it i thought i was going to eat half and save the rest. Was i wrong!!! I addictively ate it all and wish i had more left at the end. It was that good. Yes its a $10 meal but definitely worth it(plus I'm sure rent is not cheap for them)"}
{"text":"This place is located in Central De Soto market. You order from the counter and can see the chef making some delicious Asian fusion type food in the tiniest little kitchen space. The mussels we had were delicious and I particularly enjoyed the ceviche. A small cup of ceviche is $5, but that is totally not enough for me, so I had to get the bigger bowl for $8. It came with some tortilla chips and asian hot sauce. i will definitely be hitting this place up during happy hour!"}
{"text":"Of the food selections to choose from at DeSoto Central Market, Adobo Dragon stood out to us so we gave it a try. My girlfriend and I split the Vegetarian Bento Box and weren't disappointed! The flavors were bold and complex - it's worth a try!"}
{"text":"It's a descent place to have brunch. I tried the \"curried Noodles\" and the \"posole ramen soup\"."}
{"text":"Took twenty minutes. Which I don't mind if the food was going to be worth it. But it wasn't. My ramen was cold, I don't know how you serve ramen lukewarm. The chicken bao was also not room temperature. I wanted to like this place based on the picture and yelp reviews. Wasted money. Won ton appetizer was the best thing, but that is not saying much."}
{"text":"We stopped in tonight for dinner after having such a great experience at the Delta & the Larder a few weeks ago.  We purchased a Restaurant.com certificate and decided to give it a try.  We ordered the albondigas tapas and a veggie roll to start and had the curry noodles with shrimp and a beef bento box for our entrees.  The food took about 10 minutes and tasted very fresh and flavorful.  My favorite item was the curry noodles - just the right amount of spice and I love the thin noodles...so yummy!  The staff was very welcoming and even brought our food out to us in the dining room."}
{"text":"Awesome food and great flavors! Started off with chicken and vegetable empanada. Highly recommend the fish bento which is quite flavorful with mango and a touch of Siracha. We also tried the Bao which reminds me of Siopao or dimsum dumpling bread. Overall it's worth dropping by Adobo Dragon which is one of 5 restaurants in Desoto's Place."}
{"text":"This is a food stall in the desoto market, so if you are lost trying to find the place, find the desoto market first.  The salmon bento box was well prepared, I really liked the glaze on the salmon, however the term bento box should not apply to a plastic segmented container. I wish the BAO were a bit cheaper as they along with a bento would make for a quality filling meal."}
{"text":"I was at the DeSoto today, a Saturday, around lunch and ALMOST purchased something familiar and comfortable (burgers, frieZ  breakfast YAWN) but saw Adoba Dragon and the selections and thought, why not? SO GLAD I DID! I guess I'm probably late to this type of Asian Fusion cuisine party, but better late than never.   What caught my eye was the Ceviche selections advertised on the chalkboard. But they have so much more. They have Ceviche, noodle dishes, wontons, bao etc.   After getting a comprehensive explanation of the menu,(I was a newbie after all!) I decided to have the chicken bao and pork carnitas bao. (You have 2 choices with lunch).  Both were amazing!  The bread was so soft, so light and complimented the generous portion of meat in each bao. The seasoning was perfect. And the chicken  bao was filled with juicy chicken and a fresh light corn relish.   I also enjoyed the fried wontons which were perfectly crispy and FILLED with pork!   But honestly it was the dipping sauce that won me over. If you're like me, and love a pickle type flavor with spice, this is THE sauce for you too.   Bottom line, so glad I tried something new and unfamiliar. I don't recommend passing this one up.  About the DeSoto:  The DeSoto Marketplace is Downtown at Central and Roosevelt. There are a ton of little hipster shops, art, etc in the area. Parking can be limited so prepare to look around a bit or valet.   The restaurants are toward the back and line the outer walls of the building surrounding a central seating area in the middle. The main bar is located in the front of the building with floor to ceiling windows for plenty of light.   Ages vary from the college crowd to older business professionals and the music tends to reflect an eclectic mix.   My favorite part? The Saturday / Sunday $5 Mimosas that are 90% \"mim\" and only 10% \"osa\".   ENJOY!"}
{"text":"At the suggestion of the cook, I got the bao. I've never had it before today and it was delicious. I got the chicken and the pork. Mexican/Asian flavors perfectly fused together. It also came with a great little salad with a ginger-ish dressing. That was the icing on the cake. I'm looking forward to coming back and trying the ramen. I'll also be bribing my vegetarian boyfriend here to try their veg options."}
{"text":"What a major disappointment!  I just saw a neighbor of mine who 'highly' recommended this place. I happen to be watching a foreign film and they were slurping on some really good, fresh ramen, and I LOVE ramen! So, I decided to try out this joint and see what my neighbor was raving about.  So I ordered the paella ramen (which my neighbor said was good) and one order of the veggie bao. First of all, it took a while before I got my food and when it finally arrived at my table, from the looks of it, it looked delicious!   So I tackled the veggie bao first. The veggies ~which were mostly over cooked and over seasoned, salty mix of mushrooms, onions, and who knows what else (it was hard to decipher since it was over cooked) was a disappointment. Then I dug in my ramen and it was in between a thick dry soup and a soggy wet noodles. The ramen noodles were over cooked, the edamame was under cooked, the mussels (which I was really looking forward to) did not open at all and I know that when mussels or clams don't open, that they were dead prior to cooking, hence not fresh. The ramen itself was bland, the grilled chicken flavor was only on the skin, which I do not eat. So the meat of the chicken itself was bland as well. I was so disappointed that the food was not tasty at all and couldn't even finish it. Waste of my $23.  I'm a foodie and a super taster and have done quite intense traveling in Europe, especially Spain, and in Asia, particularly Japan. I realized that this joint was trying to be a 'fusion' or eclectic. However, I think they need to re-think their concept or taste the food you're making.   This place is not even recommendable. I would be embarrassed to do so."}
{"text":"The Adobo Dragon is a small food service counter located in the Desoto Central Market. They serve up a limited menu that's sort of Asian and Latino Inspired.   We decide to share a Bao Combination Platter of a Chicken Bao and a Fish Bao. The Platter comes with a fresh salad. We share the Fish First. It sounded the most interesting with guava chili jam and wasabi huancana. The bun was fresh, hot and steamy. I thought that this would be good. But then all I tasted was fish and not in a good way. I didn't think it was spoiled. It just was like fish from Safeway. Not spoiled but off tasting. The sauces didn't mask the fish taste. I don't recommend getting the fish bao here.  Then we split the Chicken Bao. This was more sweet than anything but the chicken in it was sort of dry and lacked flavor.   The salad was the best part of the plate. I enjoyed it.  The girl at the counter was pleasant and ran our food to us."}
{"text":"Really tasty food!  We ordered the Alitas Wings, Papas Bravas, Fish Bento and Curried Noodles.  The Fish Bento box and the Papas Braves dishes stood out and I'll order those again.  The Fish Bento was really a surprise find- so well put together...I could eat one of those everyday.  The Curried Noodles had an unexpected sourness I didn't care for but the grilled shrimp they put on there were delicious! The Alitas Wings were just a \"meh\" and didn't offer anything different I hadn't had a million times before.  Overall this place is a must try if you're craving a little something different."}
{"text":"Beyond amazing, bold and unique. I tried the pork and chicken bao, the ramen, and the carnitas wontons. I cannot tell you how special the pork bao was. EAT HERE!!!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon Adobo Dragon by chance when we were walking around looking for a place to eat and it turned out to be a great place!   The line was a bit long and service can be on the slow side, but it makes sense when you take into account that there are only 2 people working: 1 person cooking and 1 person taking orders, working the cash register, and completing/putting out orders. It was a busy Saturday night so we expected the wait and didn't mind it too much.   We ended up ordering the vegetarian bento and 2 baos. Now in terms of the portion, they're actually fairly large! The vegetarian bento came with roasted mushrooms, potato enchilada, and soy adobo on top of a hefty serving of rice. It also had a yummy side salad and an orange. All of the components of the bento were so good! I literally loved it and was happy that I had food left over for my next meal. The baos were also good and definitely worth having if you're in the mood for a solid snack.   I say definitely drop by if you are in the area! This place may have a bit of wait, but the food is great!"}
{"text":"I got the Posole ramen and the bao combo (chicken and ribs). The ramen was awesome and I loveeeeeeeeeee the chicken bao. It is my first time trying Asian-Hispanic fusion food and it was great!!! The restaurant is inside a complex with other food vendors. Im definitely coming back here next time I visit Phoenix."}
{"text":"Lucked up on this place to get a healthy, yummy lunch/dinner to eat while I study. I love everything about the Curried Noodle Bowl , it was crunchy, salty, zesty, it had shrimp vegetables and noodles - need I say more !!!!!!"}
{"text":"I stopped in here the other day for some trivia and the marketplace itself is a treat. Order your food, head back over to the bar to watch the Home Run Derby and my food was brought over to me as Judge was cranking out some bombs. Awesome.  I ordered the chicken bento which surprised me. The coleslaw was subtle and a nice accompanying side. The chicken was served on a bed of rice and along with the fajitas was grilled to perfection. The mango salsa was absolutely delicious.   There are a few options inside Desoto but I would encourage anyone even remotely interested to try Adobo Dragon at least once."}
{"text":"I ordered their salmon bento box. The taste was good not to die for. I actually thought their brown rice they served me was spoiled it had a funny smell and taste to it which I did not enjoy, I ate everything else but skipped on the rice. I spent about $20 on my meal including the bento and their happy hour price for the bao, $3.50. It was kind of in the pricey end because I didn't enjoy my bento box. However, their baos is amazing!!! I like how the bun is so thick and soft and the fillings tasted so good!!! When you are around Central Phoenix, you should try it. The location is very hidden so make sure you go inside the Desoto Market. Parking is free!"}
{"text":"3.5 -- this tiny fusion joint is hidden away in the back of Desoto Marketplace, a trendy little cluster of restaurants where hipsters hang out and drink vegetable smoothies (or not, the smoothie place was near dead).  The bao here are worthy of a try, we had pork and the albondigas which were tasty and wedged between a perfectly fluffy Asian dough bun.  It's kinda like a dim sum taco :-)  I also had the curried noodles, which came with some yummy grilled shrimp and was packed with fresh veggies.  I simply didn't dig it though - the curry flavors were a bit over the top and just didn't fit with the noodles or the rest of the ingredients."}
{"text":"First time here and I love it ! I will be back for sure. The food tastes great with the Asian/Latino blend.The staff is friendly and their area is very clean. This is located at the Desoto Central Market along with a number of other restaurants. I love the atmosphere of the Market. They have retained a lot of the looks and the features of the building which was built sometime in the 1930's! They have a parking lot on the south side of the building which is located at Central and Roosevelt in Phoenix. There is overflow parking lot at an adjacent church."}
{"text":"Number of times visited?  1 Would I come back? Yes  I've been to Desoto multiple times for Walrus and the Pearl and for the coffee, but have never been here before.  I tried it today for the first time and left very satisfied.   You order from the counter and the food is brought out to wherever you're sitting within Desoto.  We ordered the albondigas and pork baos, the half order tuna ceviche, and the chicken bento box.  The albondigas bao was moist, rich and satisfying.  The pork was not as good but still tasty.  It was shredded and had a coconut flavor, which was interesting.  The half order of ceviche was a good size for only 5 dollars.  It had watermelon cubes in it which added a sweet element to the dish.  Although, I love vinegar and acid, so I would've preferred it to be a little more acidic.  But still, a very good quality ceviche for 5 dollars.  The bento box was delicious.  The chicken was well seasoned, moist and had some char to it.  It was served on top of rice with a mango salsa, roasted peppers, a kale salad, and orange slices.  Everything in the box worked well together and overall created a nutritious yet fulfilling meal for 11 dollars.    The Asian/Latin fusion menu was executed well here in a casual and fast manner. There were a few things I didn't get to try on the menu so I'll definitely be back again."}
{"text":"What kind and friendly owner.  Great service in this little spot and a newly discovered downtown haunt.  I had the Curry noodles and the wonton carnitas.  The carnitas were very tasty balanced with pickled onions and shriacha hot sauce accompanying the dish.  The curry noodles were nice and lite with good balance with the salad/slaw and noodles.  The grilled shrimp was tasty.  The only criticism I have is that it was over salted.  I will admit I am highly sensitive to too much salt so I get that.  This was stop in the middle of the meal and walk over and get a glass of water salty.  I will return because I love the concept, great service by the owner and I know the food is A + overall."}
{"text":"Holy crap the food is delicious! It's a small place inside a large building with many other restaurants like a food court, so there's no server to care for you directly, which was fine by me. I ordered a chicken back & rib bao, they came with a fresh made slaw with Brussels sprouts, kale, and broccoli slaw. They were both good & unique but the rib was the best by far! We also ordered the potatoes which were addictingly good. It's a must visit in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Excellent simple menu with delicious food and great service!   Parking: This is within Desoto, towards the back on the first level.   The parking lot is behind Desoto and usually has spots. I live super close, so I don't drive here.   Service:  Always good.  The staff members at Adobo are friendly and helpful.  They will deliver your food to wherever you are sitting in Desoto.   Food:  I have only ordered the tamale and the bento box, both delicious.   The bento box is a full hefty meal:  rice (brown or rice), veggies, plus a delicious salad with a light vinegar-based dressing, a decent sized piece of meat (I get the salmon).   There are also a few slices of orange included - perfect!  The other foods I have ordered from here have been top notch, fresh and tasty!   Price: I don't know why this is so cheap, but it is!  And it's so good!  The prices are $10-15 for a meal - wow!"}
{"text":"Great fusion food. I recommend ordering many things and sharing! Only downside is that it is not easy to find since first time visitors look for this place and only see the desoto market sign.  To the restaurant owners: make sure people know your restaurant is inside the market. Edit what google shows when people search for your place!"}
{"text":"Went here on a Wednesday night so not too busy. I ordered the salmon bao and the albondigas (meatballs) bao and they were both delicious! The dish also came with a little salad. The price is reasonable for the quality of food. 5 stars for good food and great customer service, they were nice. Would come again to try something else!"}
{"text":"I have heard so many good things about Adobo Dragon, and I love Adobo Dragon's concept, but unfortunately my experience fell flat. I went to lunch at DeSoto a while ago, and got the cold thai noodles with chicken. The dish was fresh and beautifully presented, but unfortunately the noodles were overly chewy (in my opinion), and the sauce really ruined it for me. The flavor was good, tart and fresh, but there was just too much of it. I wish I had the option of adding the sauce on my own, or that they just added less. I think I would have enjoyed that more.  Everything else on the menu still looks good though, and I'll definitely give Adobo Dragon another chance."}
{"text":"Do you know how hard it is to find bao in Phoenix? Pretty freaking hard. I was trying to google \"places to get bao in Phoenix\" the other day and Adobo Dragon didn't even show UP!  ...but then I ended up at DeSoto for dinner and realized AD has bao. And I fell a little bit more in love. (Again. I already love DeSoto.)  If you've never had bao, or you have an insatiable desire to consume a soft steamed bun that seems to be made of clouds and carbs, I suggest going and ordering the albondigas bao and the pork bao. You get two bao and a side salad for about $10, and its definitely enough food for a meal.   The albondigas is a nice Mexican twist on classic bao, and the pork is (from what I understand) a more traditional form of bao. Both are delicious. Both are something I would eat everyday if I could.  Honorable mention goes to their curry noodles. I was just a little disappointed to find half my curry noodle bowl was actually a salad. What are you doing, Adobo, trying to make me healthy?!"}
{"text":"Fresh food beautifully done. Not to heavy and always tasty. If you like Asian and Mexican (who doesn't??), this place is a must try."}
{"text":"They make even the vegetables to die for! I think its worth the extra few bucks and I have never been disappointed. LOVE this place!   Now open one in Tempe, please! :)"}
{"text":"Not exactly to my liking. A few of the items we tried were far too spicy for me. It also took quite a while to get our order. The setting is very hipster and different places to eat so everyone can have their choice."}
{"text":"Finally remembered this place was open, had to check it out.  Currently there are only 6 vendors in place.  The atmosphere is very casual.  I tried Adobo Dragon (Asian Latin fusion): Thai chicken wings, carne fried wontons and 2 Bao special/abondigas & salmon.  Very interesting fusion and really tasty."}
{"text":"Update: I was able to order on the phone and bring in my second certificate. My food was ready on time (I arrived late). Once again, delicious food but I would suggest being careful when transporting the food back. I biked to work and some of the contents shifted around and spilled. Still highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Got 2 buns, the meatball one (albondiga) was good but the bun was too thick. I don't even remember what the other one was...  Too much slaw."}
{"text":"We stopped there for lunch and tried the curry noodles. I liked it and was even surprised my wife ordered some also(she hates curry). The price was reasonable (9$). I had a pretty good experience. My wife on the other hand did not. She has a msg sensitivity and experienced some of her symptoms. We never asked about the msg. I would definitely eat there again. The building was cool. The only reason I did not give 5 stars was for my wife's experience."}
{"text":"Really good food, full of flavor had the curried noodles the shrimp we cook perfectly,  tuna ceviche with watermelon and jicama was refreshing, the bao was good overall was a satisfying meal will go back"}
{"text":"If you're looking for something new to do with great art views and cool seating this is the place. Inside the Desoto Market. Great food. Friendly service. We had a bit of a wait for our food since there were quite a people ahead of us, but was worth the wait. Have been back multiple times."}
{"text":"We came here New Year's Day after FEZ was closed for the holidays. I was happy to see this whole \"district\" because I had bookmarked that very morning. Specifically had bookmarked this place, Adobo Dragon. We walked in, super different, we had never been to a place like this before, kinda cool for a brick and mortar place for numerous food places to open their doors...liked that. Super hipster, not gonna  lie but the indoor/outdoor bar was cool too. Okay, so on to the food...soooo good!! Neither my boyfriend nor I had ever had bao before but always wanted...those little pillows of lovely goodness were amazing!! We got the carnitas and chicken and carnitas wontons. The salad that came with bao's was excellent!! The bao were superb. The better of the two was definitely the carnitas, The carnitas bao had this awesome chimi churri sauce that was boss. It packed and punched you with so much flavor! The price was super cheap, the quality was great and the cust service was equally excellent."}
{"text":"First visit..for lunch, had the Beef Bao and Chicken Bao sandwiches.  Tasty, fresh ingredients.  The hot sauce was good. Had some chips and a tasty dip as an appetizer.  Recommended."}
{"text":"So, any time you see good Mexican or Asian, you get excited. Then you see fusion and it gets even better!  We got the carnitas wontons the posole ramen. Posole ramen was great, but definitely needed sriracha for personal preference. Posole isn't usually a spicy dish anyways, so I totally get it. The wontons were good, but they were just wontons y'know? A little more marinade on the meat or some sweet/spicy action, maybe a glaze on top, and they would have been awesome. Compared to the ramen, it just didn't live up, y'know?"}
{"text":"Chicken Bao was delicious!!! I highly recommend and can't wait to try out other menu items."}
{"text":"Was pretty disappointed. I had the chicken ramen that had hominy, eggs, etc. The noodles were soggy and flavorless. The chicken was the only thing in the ramen that was somewhat good. My boyfriend had the seafood ramen. His was basically butter noodles and over cooked. Overall just meh."}
{"text":"Great selection of Asian and Latin fusion cuisine. Restaurant is within Desoto market. Cool ambiance. We had the veggie and fish bento boxes. Would highly recommend the agua fresca. Owners and staff very friendly and knowledgeable."}
{"text":"Went here about two weeks ago with my friend. I had the cauliflower empanada and a beef empanada. My friend had the chicken bento box. The empanadas were delicious but I was disappointed in finding out they were fried when in the picture it looked like they were baked. They were also kind of small. However, I will say that I never thought I would love a cauliflower empanada. It was delicious! Especially with the chutney sauce it came with. Great mix of flavors. I also saw they had chimichurri sauce so I asked for some on the side. I thought it would be the Argentine kind which is a green raw sauce but it was actually a light orange sauce. It was still good though. I tried my friend's chicken bento and it was very fresh and light with great flavors as well. Can't wait to go back and have another cauliflower empanada and try something else."}
{"text":"Tapas; Albondigas - meatballs, avocado chimichurri Simple, but tasty  Alitas - crispy wings, Thai chili sauce Very delicious sauce  Carnitas wonton - pulled pork, onion escabeche Surprisingly good combination  Papas bravas - crispy potatoes, Chinese sausage The sauce makes this  Fish bento - salmon, Wasabi-huancaina, plantain mojo Delicious, properly cooked, Wasabi sauce was good  A bit on the pricy side, but not prohibitively so. Would consider returning if in the area."}
{"text":"We are visiting Phoenix and love to cross by little spot like this, very small, but huge in flavours and good food! Excellent service and definitely magnificent food! The mix of flavour and cultures shows how the owner has been putting all his heart to bring on the table talent , passion and his heritage for us to be delighted with his dishes. Wish I will be able to come back soon to try out all the menu! Cheers see you one day in Houston. TX."}
{"text":"Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink): 1 star:  Never again. 2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back. 3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad. 4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return. 5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.  So I've only had one thing here, the albondigas bao, so this isn't necessarily the most comprehensive review.  But based on these alone - 4 stars.  They were tasty.  Not too hard, seasoned well, with a decent slaw and a good salad on the side.  Really tasty Asian influenced meatballs.  I would definitely order them again."}
{"text":"Located inside Desoto market, nestled in a small food court. I tried a chicken and a pork bao. The chicken had a sauce that tasted like mango curry and the pork was garnished with coleslaw. My favorite was the chicken due to its unique flavor. This asian hybrid cuisine was a nice find."}
{"text":"This my first experience at Adobe Dragon. I am very surprise at the quality of the food. I got paella ramen. The seafood was really fresh and ramen tasted home made. It was really good. I wish I tried this place a year ago. Very creative dishes and am looking foward to trying other dishes."}
{"text":"This week the Jolly Diners went to a Adobo Dragon. This gem is located inside of the DeSoto Market on Central Avenue in Phoenix. Along with the Adobo Dragon there are other restaurants such as Radish and two other establishments in an open-air food court. The appetizers, or Tapas we ordered were Papas Bravas without the Chinese sausage, and vegetarian rolls. Both were well prepared and flavorful. The entrees consisted of Vegetarin Bento, Veggie Bao, Albondigas combo, and steamed rice with chicken for my sister(she just had a medical procedure and needed to eat light). Each dish came in either a cardboard dish, or a plastic container with a lid. Each had a package containing a napkin and plastic cutlery. Drinks are purchased from a refrigerator next to the cash register and come in cans or bottles. There was one extraordinarily hard working fellow behind the register and doing all the cooking and he did a great job! Everything was well prepared and deliciously flavorful. The Jolly Diners rated the Adobo Dragon at a 4 out of 5. This is a place where you stop for a quick flavorful meal. There are tables in the central area like a food court."}
{"text":"Chicken bao is my favorite. The bun is so soft and perfect with the chicken. My husband's favorite is the seafood ceviche, he says, \"it's good to the last bite :)\". My 5 year old nephew loves the beef bento box including the veggies with it, although he says he kinda like the chicken bao too :). Thank you, chef Allan! I just wish your restaurant's near our home."}
{"text":"I went to the Desoto Central Market for the first time yesterday not knowing what restaurants they had. I looked around and ultimately decided this restaurant sounded this best. The lady who took my order was super sweet and the food came out quick- only took about 10 minutes on a Saturday night! I got the Vegetarian bento box and it was amazing. It was probably one of the best meals I've had. It had some of my favorite foods, mushrooms, corn tortillas, potatoes, rice, and avocado. Yum! Can't wait to go back and bring all of my friends :)"}
{"text":"I've been to DeSoto market numerous times, but have always gone to eat at my favorites. I finally gave Adobo Dragon a try and want to kick myself - the food is so good, and I've been missing it all along!  When I first when up to the cashier, I was nervous, fusion Asian-Latino has always been hit or miss for me - would this be a hit or miss? The staff was friendly and charming, I felt automatically at ease as I placed my order. I'm obsessed with wontons, and when I saw they had beef wontons on the menu, I simply had to try them. As I took a bite into my first beef wonton, a resounding crunch echoed in DeSoto, and a smile lit up my face. The beer wontons were excellent, they were so crisp and fresh out of the fryer. I ordered two buns, too. The chicken bao was good, with the mango salsa being fresh and flavorful, but the ribs bao, the meat was so tender and delicious, it made my mouth melt. How have I gone to  DeSoto numerous times and never tried Adobo Dragon? Lesson learned, put your culinary inhibitions aside, take the leap and just do it."}
{"text":"My wife and I went for the 1st time today(10-6) and it was delicious.  My wife had the salmon dish and I had the Ramen posole chkn.  We sat at the bar and watched thm cook it.  The place is inside the Desoto Market in an historic brick building and parking is east of the building thru an alley with complimentary valet.  The entrance is on the north side of the building 2nd door to the right.  Hard to find the 1st time but easy after.  It's well worth it.  Once in, walk left towards the back or just ask.  We talked to the owner who is Filipino.  Very nice and humble guy.  We will be back."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the Curry noodles on a Saturday morning meeting with friends. Very delicious! The noodles mixed very well with the other spices and the shrimp added to the flavor at a high rate. Really was delicious and I wish I could have tried the other things on the menu! They also had a very friendly staff that explained everything to me just to make sure I knew what I was doing. Check them out!"}
{"text":"The food looks better than it tastes.   The picture of curry noodle looks very tempting.  However, it lacks flavor, and a lot of oil pooled at the bottom of the bowl."}
{"text":"Bento serving is big! We ordered the fish and chicken bento and they're both good. Cashier Juan was helpful. Its located in a historic building with other establishments which makes it more inviting to come here. Ambience is casual and in the afternoon could be a great place to get some work done."}
{"text":"I am not a great judge of this restaurant, as I only had the pork bao; however, I will say it was quite tasty. I had one pork bao at happy hour (3$), a tasty and juicy pork/veg filled light and sweet bun. It was varied in flavors, temperature, and texture. It was overall tasty. My issue is when it is not happy hour, 2 of these suckers cost about 10$.... pretty steep for what you get. Anyway, check them out for HH!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! The asian/latin fusion baos can't be beat."}
{"text":"So we reported to Adobo Dragon  to try something a bit different. We met Allen the owner and Chef and we were pleasantly surprised. We had a vegetarian steamed bun which was very good I could eat those any day. We had a chicken steamed bun and the flavor blending collide just right it was also savory and fantastic. The salad that comes with the combo is crisp fresh and really good it's a nice side item that goes with these little steamed bun sammeys really well. We had the seasoned potatoes covered with a spicy siracha sauce. It was spicy and savory the sauce is more creamy spicy for me they were ok but the hubby really loved them. Allen brought out a Nutella steamed bun just as a surprise and it was just that. It was outstanding we need to encourage Allen to make a dessert line because those little buns are just awesome they travel here from LA and are authentic. Don't miss the taste it is worth your time treat yourself to an original flavor you will love it."}
{"text":"Food was SUPER tasty.  Had the Vegetarian Bento.  The rice was dry, but the rest was REALLY flavorful.  Service was slow- only two guys working and just couldn't keep up with the lunch rush.   I'd go again if I have time to spare.  Also no diet soda which made me sad.   This is counter service in DeSoto Central Market. You have to hang around the food area (which is awkward if they are slow)  to wait for your 'number' or you can sit at the bar and they will bring it to you!!!!"}
{"text":"Had the carnitas wontons. Crispy, plenty of filling, sauce was so so, used soy sauce instead, under $5 for 5.  Had the salmon bento box. It will likely take longer than say chicken because I think the salmon is made upon ordering. Salmon was fresh, cooked perfectly, not dry, sauce drizzle was teriyaki I think and a little creamy sauce. .. Rice cooked perfectly, moist, not undercooked like many places. .. The salad was thin, strings of zucchini, kale, and a sweet but not overly sweet dressing. .. Fruit was 3 wedges of orange.  Not sure the bento box was worth almost $13. But it was tasty."}
{"text":"Curried noodles with the shrimp is officially one of my new favorite meals. So fresh and still so flavorful. Honestly amazing...SO impressed."}
{"text":"I was intrigued by the very creative menu. Asian-latino fusion????? But could they really pull it off?  Their paella ramen includes a cool surprise... delicious and perfectly seasoned chorizo! This chef has chops!!"}
{"text":"Stopped by Adobo Dragon for lunch today. Really welcoming, talented chefs. I had the Madras Chicken Tostada special (curried chicken, blue potatoes, olives, kale salad, corn tortilla). It was glorious. The flavors worked perfectly. Awesome spot!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. The concept was so intriguing I couldn't wait to check it out. First, I had a difficult time finding it as there was no signage on the outside. After several trips around the block and a phone call, we discovered they were located in the Desoto Central Market.  They had a good amount of parking in a back lot. The market is really cool. Loved the industrial feel and the vibe inside. There were several other food choices inside and it was reminiscent of a food court.    We got the Beef Bento, Posole Ramen Soup, and two bottles of water. Add on the tip and that put us back $30.  The portion sizes were okay; a little smaller than I expected. The soup consisted of chargrilled strips of chicken, a hard boiled egg, steamed bok choy, with a sprinkle of cabbage and hominy that I discovered on the bottom of the bowl. The noodles were over cooked in my opinion as they were soft and a little mushy. Unfortunately, the soup lacked flavor. I love both posole and ramen and I thought this would be the perfect marriage of the two.  But overall, very underwhelming.  I felt like it had the makings of something potentially amazing but it just fell short.  My bf got the beef bento which was a pot roast style chunk of beef on rice. It came with kale salad and some orange slices. The beef was okay, but it wasn't what he was expecting.   For the money and rave reviews, we were expecting a lot more. I rated them two stars because we were greeted quickly and the worker was very helpful. He gave us a quick explanation of the menu, made a few suggestions, and was able to answer our questions."}
