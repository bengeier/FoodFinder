{"text":"Bland, bland, bland. I've eaten a lot of generic Chinese food in my time. Something as basic as chicken balls shouldn't be that hard, yet somehow this place messes them up! I've gotten them at different time just to see if it was a one-off occurrence. Nope! I found a better Chinese restaurant a few minutes up the road."}
{"text":"Had a craving for Chinese food delivery on a Friday night and this restaurant was the closest one that showed up in our Just Eat app search.  Saw that the reviews were pretty good so ventured a try.  Estimated delivery time was 1 hr. 20 mins. (from few times we've ordered via Just Eat, I've found that they tend to overestimate the delivery time) but food arrived in 25 mins.  What a pleasant surprise!

It's pretty standard Chinese food but what we loved most was the very generous portions and free spring rolls (order of 5) that were included.  Order was correct, nearly packed with cardboard separators between packages and various sauce packets and fortune cookies were thrown in as well.  Would definitely order again!"}
{"text":"First take out order. New to area. Good portions, BUT, Fried dumplings were like shoe leather tough and stale. General Tao's Chicken was one big glob of sweet sauce, dough and a little chicken. Not very appetizing. The Spring rolls were a soggy mess. The chicken fried rice was one big glob of rice with barely any chicken in sight. Bland, inedible. Save your hard earned money and don't spend a dime in this place. Look at the pics. 

On the bright side. The owner did refund my money after I returned the product to the restaurant. Kudos for that, but I would never order from this place again. The restaurant itself is filthy, so you can imagine what the Kitchen looks like."}
{"text":"i love this place!  cheap and cheerful is the name of the game.  the food is not spectacular--just standard issue chinese takeout--but it is consistent.  the delivery times reasonable, seldom an error, they speak english so if you have a detailed question about ingredients or want a suggestion, there isn't a language barrier.  

when i'm craving fatty chinese takeout, it's my go-to place.  over the years, i've ordered here at least 4 or 5 dozen times.  always back."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem,staff is always friendly and helpful food is amazing. I used to live near by for years each year it's gets better.I moved and now uses delivery they remember me as soon as I give my number even if a few weeks have passed they inquire on how I enjoyed my meal or new item.I love that added touch.Makes no difference if ordering threw just eats or their web site online or calling direct service ,the food and delivery time are outstanding."}
