{"text":"Five stars because:  1. Fair trade coffee, thank you, thank you! 2. Local pasture raised meat/ local produce in their tasty paninis. 3. Outdoor seating and cozy tables inside, can't go wrong. 4. Service. Nice folks working there :)  5. Highland Park is such a sweet place to take a walk.  Love making the reservoir loop before heading out of the neighborhood."}
{"text":"The coffee is really awesome but the brunch wasn't anything spectacular.  It was also exceptionally busy and me and my three friends had to crowd around a teeny tiny table.  All of us felt like the panini/burritos were totally edible and good just not great.  The flavors just weren't super tasty.  I would say yay on coming here for coffee sort of yay on coming for food.  It kind of bothers me that it shows up as the number one restaurant in Pittsburgh.  I mean, it DEFINITELY does not deserve that ranking.  I wouldn't want out-of-towners coming to Pittsburgh and thinking that's the best we have."}
{"text":"I don't drink coffee, so keep moving if that's what you care about. Surprisingly quiet (library quiet) coffee shop, which is nice unless you're hoping to have a conversation without the looming self-consciousness of being overheard. Surprisingly cheap iced/chilled tea. There was a large group of neighbors gathering at the outside tables, and a fair amount of passing conversation, which suggests this might be a community gathering spot for Highland Park residents. Hoping to be inspired in future visits."}
{"text":"Hands down the best cappuccino you'll get in Pittsburgh. I have yet to be disappointed. Consistency in quality in a coffee joint is what I'm looking for! (Oh and alright those delectable treats they always have don't hurt either... Apple dumpling?!?!)"}
{"text":"So, I used to come here all the time two years ago and it was amazing.  I thought I had discovered the Shangri-La of coffeehouses in Pittsburgh, but, much to my chagrin, the staff has gotten ruder and less professional over time.  Seriously, all the people here have major attitude problems and need an adjustment.  I refuse to pay good money (and always tip!!!!) when you people glare and judge all your customers.  Also, have you people heard of showering?!?!  When your smell overpowers the smell of coffee in a coffeeshop there's definitely something wrong.  Their sandwiches taste terrible as well, they've always been terrible.  Never going here again unless they re-staff pronto!!!"}
{"text":"I used to be all about this place before I moved to New York, so I was excited this morning when I decided to get coffee for my girlfriend and I.   Seriously, fuck this place. I came in, and everyone gave me the once over, and I get the brooding barista act, but as a patron and someone who has worked in the service industry, I feel like there definitely should be some sort humanesque emotion displayed from these people. All three behind the counter looked at me like I had ten eyes and dicks for eyebrows.   I asked for Iced Skim Latte, got a hot one, but hey, small fuck up. It was the exasperated sigh when I corrected them, I could've fucking done without. Still didn't get an iced skim latte.   Also, when I point to something and use the proper name of it, I feel like it shouldn't be a problem for an individual of average intelligence. I ordered an apple dumpling, pointed to the apple dumpling, and thought I was watching them put it in there, until I turned my head for a second, and got a fucking Danish. It wouldn't have been a big fucking deal, IF THEY WERENT FUCKING DICKS THE ENTIRE TIME I WAS THERE.   Yeah, five out of five stars, definitely gonna go again and right my next screenplay."}
{"text":"One of the best cups of coffee in pgh.  Great atmosphere for working, studying or a meeting.  Very neighborly feeling."}
{"text":"This is a staple neighborhood coffee house right down the hill from the park. Great outdoor seating. Very hip atmosphere. Plenty of plugs for laptops. Comfy chairs for relaxing. Friendly people. Only problem is finding a seat."}
{"text":"I've put off writing a review for Tazza D'Oro for a long time because I don't like being negative. But when I realized that I go out of my way to get coffee somewhere else that is way less convenient, I realized it was time.   I have heard great things about their cappuccinos and lattes and other mixed beverages, but that's not what I generally want. I want black coffee with nothing in it but coffee. You'd think this would be a cafe's specialty. No. The coffee is undrinkable! I actually bought a coffee and had to throw it away before I left the building because it was so awful. I've never tasted anything like it. That was the second chance I'd given the place. The first time I just suffered through it because it was not delicious, but it at least resembled coffee.   I can't speak to their fancy drinks, but if you want straight up coffee, this is not the place for you."}
{"text":"Hmm, well, if I was in the neighborhood I'd go here but I wouldn't make a special trip. I guess I don't get all of the hype.  I came in and was expecting a lot more I have to say. There wasn't a lot of variety in coffee drinks, and I was under the presumption that they had an actual menu, like soups and sandwiches. Instead, they had a one page list of around 3 sandwiches and a soup of the day. I get it, they're small, but after all I have heard about them, I was a little surprised. So I ordered a mocha. The barista was very nice and very polite.   I sat down inside with my fiancee since the two outdoor seats were taken. It was a little weird. I thought it was going to being kind of an indie/artsy/fun little place, but it was kinda weird for me. The music was so quiet I could barely even hear it. Every time the front door opened, it squealed really loud, and I felt like I couldn't talk to my fiancee sitting right across from me with out the whole room hearing us. Some people were on their laptops, some people reading...it was a unique mix of people, mostly middle-aged. It was a little strange seeing a sad Charlie Brown-esqe Christmas tree sitting on the ground with it's lights still wrapped around it collecting dust, since it is May.   But back to the coffee...my mocha was okay. Nothing like \"wow\" but it was alright. Coffee is cheap."}
{"text":"Not bad, but a bit overrated, I think, but maybe I need to go again a few times.  The best thing about this cafe was that the coffee was served in a large french press.  The atmosphere is a bit sterile.  The baked goods were mediocre.  My friend orders a latte, and she says it's done perfectly though.  I would go again."}
{"text":"first time in the shop! i created a yelp account just for this experience. if i could some up my experience at this cool little shop, it would be one word: WOW! great coffee (and they even do MANUAL POUR!) the shop was humming with clicking fingers and beautiful indie tunes that captured the fuzzy feelings of autumn. local milk, great and ethically sourced coffee, cool art on the walls, they have it al. however, the most important and memorable part of my visit to this godsend was the barista, chris. talking with him made me feel special to be drinking coffee, and he was able to explain many factors of coffee my silly brain previously didn't comprehend (not to mention he's cute, amirite?????) that guy really knows his stuff, and i wouldn't be surprised if he were the manager of this local spot. the other barista was really friendly too, and had cool tattoos (which is something i appreciate about a workplace!) anyways, thanks for the great coffee, information and vibes!"}
{"text":"First-class espresso, with that Italian little hint of sourness. That's praise, by the way! Very friendly and comfortable. I wrote most of my dissertation there."}
{"text":"Best coffee in Pittsburgh, without a doubt. Believe the hype. I've been going here for years, and every visit is a pleasure."}
{"text":"Really hard to find a good cup of coffee in the states... I'd say this is the best  cappuccino I've had since Italy."}
{"text":"Counter culture brand coffee is exceptional! Herbal, green and other tea choices are amazing. Foods: my least favorite is the portobello sandwich. . Great location and ambiance."}
{"text":"Not bad, and I appreciate that there's coffee available a few minutes' walk from where I'm staying.  I ordered a large coffee and a fruit tart, which was over $7.  Kinda pricey for what you get.  The coffee was ok - nothing exceptional (I drink it black).  The fruit tart looked great, but it was bland.    The atmosphere was not bad at all.  The staff was very friendly.  They appeared to have free wifi as I saw several people with computers hanging out inside.  The food and drink were just not that great, and were too expensive for what they are.  3 stars.  I'd go back for coffee if I needed a quick caffeine fix and was in the area, but I wouldn't go out of my way.  I'm sure for some people who like specialty coffee drinks, they probably make 'your drink' just the way you like it - they must, with all the glowing reviews they have on here.  My review is based on black coffee and a pastry."}
{"text":"love this place. great coffee drinks and pastries. they make their own chai so it has the perfect amount of sweet and spicy, unlike what you get at most chain places. they have free wi-fi, too."}
{"text":"Tazza D'Oro has a generally European decor, with dark, rich colors and textures, and a cozy layout that makes the most of the space. The espresso is, bar none, the best I've had - including my admittedly limited travels in Italy. It's stellar espresso - rich, thick, potent without being sour or bitter, with unique nuances that vary slightly depending on the shot and the weather, but are always fantastic.  The coffee is also terrific, and Tazza D'Oro uses Batdorf & Bronson beans - the best I've ever had for home grinding. They have a good selection of pastries and cookies, as well as a broad selection of tasty sandwiches that come with a satisfying side salad.  In addition, they have a wonderful selection of teas; I'm no expert, and don't know their supplier, but the half-dozen different blends I've tried were all memorably flavorful.  All that, and it's a lovely center of community, where you can bring your laptop or a book or a friend and spend the day. No one is rushed out the door, and there almost always seems to be a little room for your studies or conversation."}
{"text":"The beans are great, but some of the men who work there are rude, repeatedly."}
{"text":"I've read countless 5-star reviews of this coffee shop and I'm sorry, but I don't wholly agree with, well, everyone else; so, here's my slightly alternative take on the cafe.  I'm aware, like many reviewers on this site, that not every place is aiming for me as the target customer; but even still, there's no way this is a five star coffee shop. Yes, the coffee is good and if I happen to be lost in highland park someday on foot, I'm sure I'd stop in to get it again.  But the place itself was a turn off, despite the interesting people that it attracts.  Glossy refinished exposed wood beams, fake grape vines over the windows, and odd light fixtures create a tacky atmosphere I can't overlook or sit in.  I think this is a great coffee shop if you happen to own a house in highland park, but for me it's going to be voluto or espresso a mano from now on - it's just not worth the drive."}
{"text":"I love this place, its warm and cozy ambiance and the coffee and baked goods are wonderful!  The staff is so inviting too!"}
{"text":"Finally, a great neighborhood coffee shop that just so happens to brew fantastic coffee. The espresso is incredible, which makes for an excellent cappuccino, and the food is pretty good, too. Croissants, muffins, and other baked goods top the breakfast list, while made-to-order paninis and delicious homemade soups round out the lunch menu.  The crowd at Enrico's is varied, which I really enjoy. My 65-year-old neighbor and his crew of retired friends pull up a chair every day at 3:00 pm next to business folks, college students, techies, and other folks who are looking for a good brew.  No frills, no extras; just nice people in a quaint coffee shop, brewing up warm goodness."}
{"text":"Saw this place listed on a blog--and had to come here. We had tea and cappuccino. It was delicious- but my favorite thing is the neighborhood and the outdoor seating. Great for a coffee date"}
{"text":"The coffee was ok, but the service and ambiance left much to be desired. The place was dirty, with straw wrappers etc on the floor. The light fixtures were too modern to be considered cozy. There were four people on staff but it took at least 2 minutes for one of them to stop gossiping with the others and take our order.  I got the feeling that this place has had a lot of success and the owners have let things slide. It was ok, but in looking for a coffee shop to make my regular hangout, I would not go back."}
{"text":"One of the best coffee shops in Pittsburgh. Easy to miss while driving down the street. Extremely friendly staff, great coffee, good atmosphere, wifi. What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"I stopped in early on a Saturday morning and needed some fuel for a long day of bike riding, and the cycling club meets here to start their ride.  I had a great breakfast!  I had a panini with egg, spinach, and feta cheese with a side of field greens with a light dressing.  The panini was perfect,,and the greens were also topped with feta cheese.  And everything was very good.  For desert ( yeah I know it was breakfast, but a burned 2000 calories riding!) I had a very tasty cinnamon roll with creme cheese icing.  I topped it off with a black iced tea.    The service was prompt and friendly, and the food was favorable and prepared just right.  I cant help but,wonder if the locals realize what a great little gem they have right here in their neighborhood of Highland Park.   I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"It was a bit out of the way of where we were staying, but I was swayed by the Yelp reviews!  You did not steer me wrong.   A nice little coffee joint in a quiet neighborhood, Enrico's was the perfect spot to get my caffeine fix before starting the day at full speed.  My wife and I both got lattes and pastries, and everything was good to go.  It looked like we were the only patrons that didn't plan on spending the whole day there, rooted to a chair.  We got the next to last free table.  Almost every \"two-top\" had only one person sitting at it.  I would imagine it's tough to find a seat sometimes.   Recommend!  P.s. I thought it was interesting that you can also purchase bike tire tubes here."}
{"text":"NEW FAV HANG OUT!  Came for a breakfast date and returned for a Sunday brunch and walk about in Millvale! Really love the space, the open garage door windows just makes it feel so big and airy.  I had an OK breakfast sandwich and a better mushroom flatbread while here. Coffee is always good!   I suspect this will be a great new hangout!  Love you! muah!"}
{"text":"The coffee here was excellent! Had a double espresso. Apparently their roaster is in Santa Cruz Ca. Large selection of French Press Coffees. Baked goods did not look too great but that is not why I came here. Atmosphere is very mellow and comfortable. Also has Wifi which works! Nice to find a place like this when traveling. Is in the middle of a residential area and there doesnt seem to be anything else around here."}
{"text":"I've been here before and had an enjoyable meal. After today, I will never go back. The young lady who took my order was told to give me a prosciutto panini and pot of Moroccan mint tea. The panini was toasted bread with a small slice of prosciutto and was not satisfying. I never got the tea and I finished my meal and just sat there. Another employee apologized and I got chocolate chip cookies instead.  This was a miserable experience, one I will never allow myself to endure again."}
{"text":"I decided to escape and get some work done. I had never been here before, and I'm always up for trying a new coffee shop. I love the personality of this shop as it was small, charming and filled with people of the community of multiple ages. My cup of coffee was great. I tried an apple pie bar; it was delicious. I now know why there were only two left. Originally, I had planned to get food but they were sold out of the spinach and egg sandwich, one of three vegetarian options on the menu. I was slightly disappointed because I had come during lunchtime, but that just means I'll have to go back. Other than that, the staff was very friendly. The wifi was very reliable (this is a big deal folks!). And the vibe was productive."}
{"text":"I've heard a bunch of good things about this place, so I decided to make a trip over there on a Sunday to check it out. While I enjoyed the coffee and cookies I bought, I have to say that everything seems to be a bit overpriced and I did get a feeling of snobbery from some of the staff. However, the venue was actually nice with a nice neighborhood feel. Every time I have been there since it has been really crowded and I've had trouble finding a seat. I would love to go back in the summer and sit outside at one of the tables."}
{"text":"I love Counter Culture coffee :-) The baristas are very friendly and very accommodating."}
{"text":"I stopped here before kicking off a road trip to Wisconsin and the coffee was perfect. Everyone was lovely at the counter. Both hot and iced coffees were delightful. Only critique would be that the quiche was cold. I didn't say anything and that's on me, but it wasn't great."}
{"text":"I want to LOVE this place, the location, the coffee, the food and even the people rock!  But it's the small stuff that matters when you commit to a coffee shop.  When you compare the details of other local shops it's a close call maybe even worth the extra travel and limited space at more popular locations.  You won't get a fancy design a top your latte here, and unless you tell them your here to stay they will put it in a crappy to go cup.  When your spending $5+ for coffee you want the fancy design vs. just having it slopped into a throw away foam cup.  Call me a prude but they have the right idea here just need to work on delivery!!!"}
{"text":"This is where I learned what good espresso tastes like. If you make it to Highland Park, stop there and get some great neighborhood atmosphere."}
{"text":"I met a friend here for a drink around lunch time on a weekday. Tazza D'oro is located on a quaint street in Highland Park near the Pittsburgh Zoo. There is on-street parking and the cafe offers some outdoor seating by the sidewalk. By the time I arrived, my friend had already ordered for herself and suggested the special, Matcha Tea. I have seen this drink offered at several cafes and coffee shops but had not tried it, so I did. She warned me that it tastes like grass and when I tried it, she was not wrong! It wouldn't be \"my cup of tea\", but it was okay. I thought the prices for the drinks were quite high, however,  they may be based on its location and I am not familiar with Highland Park. After our long stay at the cafe, I could not spot an area to place our used mugs. The disposal bin was located behind the counter where the baked goods were and I felt that was not a place where guests should be going.    I would like to try this place again and order something different, maybe even purchase a baked good. It deserves another visit at a later date!"}
{"text":"This, I feel, is more of a personal review, then a general one. Also, I'm aware locals love this place...but I just cannot get on board with that.  This place just annoys the sh@t out of me.   I can't stand the sizes of cups they have...like they must of smuggled there size small cup from some back ally, low rent cup smuggler, because No legitimate cup company is going to make a 'small' cup, THAT small. It's smaller than ANY small you've ever had, and it's NOT CHEAP!  They brew a lot of Ethiopian / pea berry ALL THE TIME...both suck  They don't brew decaf, you have to order an Americano, and it sucks...it's a whole building whose soul purpose is selling coffee, you'd think they'd want to cover all the bases. At least offer a decaf pour over or something....Just more pretentious bs! No music. Small tables.  The food is okay, for a coffee shop."}
{"text":"This is one of those places I really want to love. You walk in, it is super cute, nice ambiance, friendly staff, people are reading and talking... None of these are bad things. I got a regular coffee black and a sandwich, which came close to $15. A little pricey but whatever. The sandwich was just gross. Old bread that was just past stale to the gummy gross stage, almost no toppings and some weird spread (it was the mushroom sandwich). The coffee was just a little off. I couldn't put my finger on why, but it didn't seem right. Then I looked into the back room.... There is bread stacked EVERYWHERE. No wonder mine was stale. I might go back for coffee in a pinch, but I wouldn't get food there again."}
{"text":"Back in Highland Park these days, and this is still one of the best places around.  See original review below!  ONE QUICK NOTE: I was in here recently, working working working on my laptop with headphones, looked up, and the place was empty and the two employees left were cleaning everything. I asked \"are you guys closing?\" \"Yeah... we closed at 9:00\" was the response. It was 9:25 at this point. \"Oh my gosh, I'm sorry...\" and before I could finish the guy laughed and said \"yeah... our website is a liar. It says we are open until 10. We're not.\" They weren't jerks, they didn't seem upset with me. And they earned their final star.   But the note is THEY CLOSE AT 9 (the website says 10). This place is awesome! go there."}
{"text":"I love your place, your drinks, your music selection, the pastries, but I do not love the gaggle of old men that frequent your spot. They loudly talk horrid politics, bash women, scoff at liberals... I stopped coming for a while, but I guess they're up to the same (now charged up by all these harassment allegations in the media). It's gross.  Today I draw the line, though, and write this review, because of this lovely comment: \"They keep getting a bunch of freaks to work here.\"  Don't come here then? I think you are all lovely. I'm all about free speech but this is just bad juju and not a good environment for me."}
{"text":"Pittsburgh's definitely got nothing on Seattle when it comes to a good brew but if you look hard enough you'll find a few diamonds in the rough. Tazza D'Oro is one of them. I wont say THE best simply because coffee is such an objective taste but you cannot deny the expertise and care Tazza D'Oro subscribes to. It brings them millions of miles above Starbucks and (gasp) Crazy Mocha.  I found out about Tazza D'Oro while browsing the blog of an award winning, internationally recognized barista. He conveniently mapped out his favorite coffee houses around the US via Google Maps. I clicked on PA and zoomed it, not even expecting to see a marker. Surprisingly there was -- only one -- and it was for Tazza D'Oro.  Their baristas know how to make the perfect espresso. Once you've done that all of your other drinks fall right into place. They also do french pressed coffee which is a rare treat usually enjoyed at home and, at least in my case, not done nearly as well as it should be. Their pastries and baked goods come straight from one of the 'burgh's best bakeries -- Enrico's in the Strip District; what more could you ask for?  I have a longer article on Tazza D'Oro as well as another great coffee shop, Espresso a Mano on my website. http://eatinginpittsburgh.com/2011/02/11/coffee-pittsburgh-part-2/"}
{"text":"On my recent road trip from Dallas to New Haven, CT, Randy S. and I stopped in Pittsburgh to revel in its charms. This, I must add, was in opposition to his mother's strong protests to the effect of, \"There's nothing *in* Pittsburgh, why would anyone go there?\"   Tazza D'oro is the answer to that question. Especially if you like coffee. This is easily one of the best coffee shops east of the Mississippi, and I've been to a lot of them. So, what's so good about it?  Let's go in order of importance:  Coffee - It is really, really good. They use Batdorf and Bronson beans, where an ex-gf of mine used to work in Olympia. Believe me when I tell you that B&B is good. It's not amazingly great, but it's very solid and they take roasting seriously. When I go to a new coffee place I suspect might be good I always get a latte. Why? This one has a high upside if done well and the lowest downside (lots of milk) if done poorly. I got a latte. They have a few sizes, 12oz was the first one I got. It was fantastic. They did a nice little rosetta in it too (look up latte art on google if you have no idea what this is). The baristo really knew what he was doing and pulled a some good shots with excellent crema.   The coffee was so good (coffee is supposed to taste bold, smooth and rich, which it almost never does and this place had it down) I had to go back for an 8oz, which is another level of trust. It has the same amount of coffee but less milk to hide poor coffee quality. It was always superior.   This is a coffee place that is truly top notch based on the coffee alone, but there was more.   Pastries - They all looked amazing. I had a plain donut while I waited in line. Normally I don't eat plain donuts, because life is too short for plain donuts, but it was really, very good. Everyone was commenting on how nice the pastries were.  Atmosphere - This place has it exactly right. It's a mom & pop feel, nothing forced. Some tables, outdoor seating, maybe some local art, but not in a goofy sort of way. Very friendly employees. Just a complete home run.   Obviously I loved it. Behind me in line for my re-up, I heard a girl behind me in line complain, \"we could just go to Starbucks, it's cheaper!\" then proceeded to order with sugar free syrups and skim milk. That's fine. Everyone has to do what they like... and with the proliferation of bad coffee (Starbucks only being guilty of mediocre, though a little bit interesting coffee) over the past 10 years, I don't blame people for being set that way. But the beautiful thing about Tazza D'Oro (cup of gold in Italian) is that--if you let it--it will remind you that you don't need to make your coffee up like a drag queen on Halloween.  Tazza D'Oro stands as a reminder that coffee can be enjoyed in all its naked glory in an awesome setting on a beautiful street and give you a good f'ing reason to go to Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"A very simple, welcoming and down to earth coffee space halfway up the hill between the heart of East Liberty and Highland Park. As long as you get here early enough to get a table, this is a relaxing place to get a good cup of coffee and read a bit or hang out with your people and chat a bit. Staff is chill and low key, and the selection is your basic variety of coffee drinks and pastries. If I lived here I'd hang out here way too often."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time and fell in love! Im always out looking for nice coffee houses to get work done or socialize with a friend and I think I found my favorite spot! They have a limited but delicious lunch menu and many many coffee options. I had a kale salad that was reasonably priced and VERY filling and delicious. The house coffee was probably the best I've had in Pittsburgh, although I didn't get to try the specialty drinks so I can't speak on those. Such a cute spot with outdoor seating and cute window seats indoors to gaze outside. Very informative and friendly workers as well. SO happy I found this place. I would have no problem going out of my way to come here versus another coffee shop. Definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"Just realized that no one mentioned about their chai latte yet. They make their chai from scratch. The best chai I have ever had outside of my indian co-worker's kitchen. The only thing is, since they premade a whole pot, there's no way you can get a cup of skim chai..."}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying I am one of those bizarre people who does not like coffee. Given that, I consider it a testament to how absolutely wonderful Tazza D'oro is, because one sip of my friend's mocha and I was in silky, smooth heaven. I ordered the hot chocolate, which was every bit as rich and creamy as a hot chocolate should be.   On to the food - don't come here if you expect a wide selection of bites to pair with your drink. They only had a few options, but from what I could tell, each one was crafted with love, skill, and just the right amount of sugar. I had a fruit tart (berries and strawberries), which was a delightful combination of tangy and sweet. My friend had a very satisfying chocolate croissant - but to be fair, it's difficult to make a chocolate croissant anything but. I was so impressed that I took home an apple puff pastry and vowed to return posthaste.   This is precisely the sort of place in which Elizabeth Bennet would while away a dreary day, were coffee shops accessible in rural, Georgian England. I wouldn't suggest coming with a large group; neither the limited seating nor the ambience is conducive to that.  It's quiet and intimate - ideal to catch up with friends or bury your nose in a book."}
{"text":"Reasons:  1. LOCATION and setting: Highland Park is simply lovely - makes you feel as if you are in a small English town, where time has stood still. The art and small tables inside and outside are charming. 2. Socially Responsible:Fair trade and international array of coffee. 3. Fresh Meat:  Local pasture raised meat/ local produce in their tasty panini's. 4. Nice crowd and staff."}
{"text":"Best coffee I had in Pittsburgh. Their Italian Cappuccino is pretty addictive."}
{"text":"Nice neighborhood corner cafe. Friendly staff. Got an iced chai. Very good. Not too sweet.  Their iced coffee was some Honduran \"fica el puente\". Most flavorful coffee i've had in a long time. If not ever. Kale salad was delicious. Blueberry scone was grand. They did forget our simple iced coffee and served 3 or 4 other people theirs before we got ours. But otherwise it was a good experience. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"This is some of the best coffee I've ever had. I've been looking for a local coffee shop that made good coffee and didn't have irritating quirks in their service (I've run into a cash-only, lame hours shop and a we-don't-have-an-espresso-machine shop, which are useless to me.)  The pastry I had was good, though a bit overpriced at ~$3. The mocha I had was absolutely amazing, though their largest size is only 16 oz, which is an adjustment if you're expecting the larger sizes some other coffee shops produce."}
{"text":"A nice place to sit and read, and drink amaaaaazing coffee. I like the atmosphere, and will definitely be a return regular customer."}
{"text":"The espresso is definitely good. Although the interior is strange, the location is cute for Highland Park.   My beef is with the snarky Pittsburgh hipster Employee's that barely even engaged with my jokes made about their Beta Fish \"Vivian.\" Seriously, a boy Beta, named Vivian! That fish needs some recognition and love. After basically flirting with ourselves, it seemed like all they cared about was acting cool and barely providing an engaging espresso experience for me and my friend who were obviously excited to be there!   Next time, maybe there will be different employee's. But I have a feeling their lack of enthusiasm for serving the general public will deter me elsewhere. Sad times Tazza, I felt like I could have really loved you."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. THE best coffee in the 'Burgh. Good atmosphere, great service. The food is really good too."}
{"text":"Spectacular neighborhood cafe that I still commute to having moved to a suburb. The staff is always kind, friendly, and knowledgeable, they serve Counter Culture coffee (and sell bags as well), and have a good selection of teas. Of special note are Bill's homemade baked treats. Definitely a good place for a conversation, or your extended office."}
{"text":"Yes! Awesome soy cap, scone, and atmosphere. Nice place to hang out & read, and free WiFi with no login procedure."}
{"text":"I walked in to this business and immediately knew I could risk a latte without flavoring to cover up poor quality or technique, and I was absolutely correct. The espresso was a perfect balance of flavor with a smooth finish, the foam was stretched perfectly and expertly poured to form a heart in my mug. My accomplice's Americano was equally well made, not a note of sourness but plenty of body and flavor. I regret that I didn't notice the \"Manual\" bar menu before I ordered, I've been dying to try a pour-over coffee, and I know it would have been delicious.   Pro-Tip: There is no sign for the unisex restroom, which is to the left of the service area, past the bulletin corkboard."}
{"text":"I adore this place! The light green walls are serene, the chairs and tables are comfortable, and I love their little brownies with three kinds of chocolate chips in them! The coffee is perfectly smooth and rich, which is the most important thing to get right. (I'm not into masking the taste of burnt espresso with a mocha!) If a place can provide me with a cup of coffee that doesn't taste like it will give me an ulcer, I'll be a fan for life. The only other Pittsburgh place where I've found coffee this delicious was at Commonplace Coffee in Squirrel Hill. I went to college near Chicago and come from California. I count Intelligentsia and Blue Bottle Coffee as some of my favorite places, so I mean it when I say the coffee here is wonderful. Try it out, you won't be let down."}
{"text":"Had a cup of Cappuccino. Tasted good, but not that impressive. Well, it's just a regular cappuccino. Five stars to the street view at a sunny winter afternoon."}
{"text":"I  thought \"cup of gold\" in Italian was a little pretentious when I first stopped here, but it is the title this coffee deserves.  I wanted to use my coffee passport here, but was disappointed that my cappuccino was only 12oz. I'm used to big coffee, but big coffee doesn't equal \"cup of gold\". My entire day changed when I drank this coffee. I was late for work and no one cared. It blocked annoying calls from my phone. This coffee filled my hard, shrunken heart with pure joy.  This place is worth a visit if you are in the Highland Park area or if you need a powerful burst of energy and productivity.   Normally coffee just allows me to tolerate people, but Tazza D'oro gave me a genuine smile of empathy and admiration to everyone in the 2 hours after consuming their cappuccino."}
{"text":"Amazing community coffee shop that provides wonderful coffee, tea, and food. The setting is relaxed and welcoming. The staff are attentive and friendly.  Coffee shops come and go, but this one has survived over the years because it's an amazing part of the Highland Park Community.  The prices are reasonable and the quality is excellent.  I highly recommend this shop."}
{"text":"Do you see how all of the other reviews give this place 5 stars - this place is way more than a 5 star coffee shop.  I am giving all 5 stars to this delightful coffee shop because it is the perfect community coffee shop.  I am slightly saddened that they took out the 2 overstuffed chairs, but they need more tables because people like to come here and people hanging out in their community is a good thing.  It is 11:30 on a Monday morning and the place is almost full - there are always people coming going, getting coffee.  It is a great place to sit and read the paper or to pick up some coffee on your way to some place else.  Enrico's also has become a hub for other community activities - there a a couple of weekly bike groups that meet here.  Other reasons to love this place (I know some of the other reviews highlighted these but I thought they were worth repeating).  - free wifi - outside tables - tasty treats - they have a blog! - really great coffee - the staff are coffee experts"}
{"text":"I love living in Highland Park and having Enrico's Tazza D'Oro around the corner from my house as my new go to coffee shop. The locations is pretty, inviting and quiet; Pandora plays in the background - loud enough to enjoy, but not loud enough to drown out your conversation.  And conversation there is! It's a wonderful community where the regulars meet of all ages, talking about their families or getting together on Saturday/Sunday afternoon to catch up. Otherwise you can come in do get some work done, discuss your newest project with your coworkers or just fill out job applications and yelp reviews like I do.   The Service is friendly and pleasant and the coffee is good. Personally, I have been opting for the Tea which is served in a larger pot if you are dining in. Not the highest of high quality, but after all, it's a coffee shop and not Tea [plus my mother spoiled us with Marktfrau back in the day]. When my roommate vouches for coffee, I listen, and Enrico's has been T' approved.   All in all, like the place and love the community and naturally I will continue to make Tazza D'oro my coffee shop destination."}
{"text":"Super cute in here. I ordered their iced mocha and really enjoyed it. The vibe in the coffee shop is really modern, rustic and very chill. Definitely a place I could return to for lunch and a coffee to study or work. Looking forward to coming back again soon!"}
{"text":"Tazza D'oro is fantastic! I worked with them for coffee catering and the ownership couldn't have been more friendly and accommodating! They have a great selection of hot beverages and always have a variety of baked goods. It is a great place to head on the weekend to get work done, but since it is the place to go - I typically run in to someone I know and end up getting to catch up with people as well! The seating is limited, so with more than 2 people it is a challenge to get space to sit during the busy times.  I also love that they feature local artists. I attended an art show there one evening and it was a lovely community space to celebrate the artist's success!"}
{"text":"This cafe's espresso drinks are on par with the best artisinal coffee houses anywhere.  I always go out of my way to get coffee from here when I'm in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Maybe Tazza D'Oro doesn't need another review, but I guess it never hurts to lend your voice to the chorus of those praising a good, solid and well-run local business.    The coffee selection is terrific.  The baristas are professional and courteous.  No, they are not chatty, but they are polite and friendly.  I'm not there for conversation, but for good coffee.  And that's what you get.    The pastries and snacks are fine.  Good variety.    The atmosphere is JUST what I want when I need a cup of coffee: relatively quiet, comfortable and calming.    When it first opened (how long ago how?) it was mobbed by some of my neighbors (I live in Highland Park) who adopted it as their private club and often seemed peeved at \"others\" who stopped by.   They've either relaxed or found other obsessions.  The clientele is, as folks said, eclectic and invigorating.    It's become our after-dinner spot after a meal at Park Bruges or Smiling Banana Leaf, too!"}
{"text":"local, friendly businesses serving a great product DO still exist."}
{"text":"Best mocha ever! I love their cafe latte too. Americano is okay...(it's too sour for people who are used to Starbucks coffee.) The price is a little above Starbucks range but atmosphere is nice and it sells pastry too. Free wifi provided. Early in the morning could be very busy, but later on it becomes spacious. I liked this place ever since 2011-ish. Many people started to look for Lawrenceville area so there are less people now, but still it's a nice (and only) cafe in Highland Park neighborhood. :-)"}
{"text":"I visited here on a Saturday around brunch time. It was the start of a long date day with my boyfriend. We sat in the window corner and enjoyed the sunshine, while looking at pamphlets that were out showcasing Pittsburgh's finest. This place is on the smaller side so there may be times where seating is scarce. It has an extremely awesome hometown feel. It seemed like 75% of the patrons were regulars who knew the staff and the other customers sitting around.   I tried an espresso macchiato and the pumpkin muffin. The muffin was very moist and delicious. The espresso was actually really good. This was a traditional macchiato with no sweetener. Normally I just have these for a jolt and chug it down, but this one was so smoothe. I actually sipped and enjoyed the flavors.   This place is your typical expensive cafe price point, but nothing outrageous. I definitely suggest stopping by, I know I will again."}
{"text":"What a great addition to Millvale. I really enjoy this coffee shop. It serves a good cup of brew and has a great atmosphere. There is tons of natural light and windows that can be opened up in the warmer months. Pricing is consistent with other locally owned coffee shops. The staff here are friendly and there is plenty of seating."}
{"text":"This coffee shop is a great place to stop by and do work or to hang out for a relaxing afternoon. They have a menu of coffee & espresso drinks, teas, and some light snacks. All of the pastries I've tried, especially the snickerdoodle, haven been very tasty! A very no-frills type of place that's very straightforward and efficient!  Their coffee is awesome and the atmosphere inside is great, in my opinion. Sometimes, depending on the clientele that day, it can be too quiet and awkward if you're there to chat with a friend, but even then, I've never been made to feel like we're bothering anyone working near us. They have some really nice art up on the walls which appear to be local and for sale. Highly recommended for a stop for anyone in the area!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, often crowded, not too expensive, tasty beverages.   Both my husband and I had mochas- delicious!"}
{"text":"This is a cute cafe in an up-and-coming neighborhood of Pittsburgh. There is plenty of seating, free wifi, friendly workers, and they accept card. It seems like a very neighborhood-y type of place. The prices were a little high - a 16 ounce iced coffee is the same price as a 30 ounce iced coffee at Starbucks. I believe they use a local brand of coffee bean. Definitely I would recommend for getting work done but less so for a caffeine fix."}
{"text":"I love Tazza D'Oro! great coffee, excellent baked goods and the food is delicious."}
{"text":"This is a quiet little nook in Highland Park that is perfect for tea, coffee, snacks and getting some work done or catching up with an old friend. I used to frequent this place much more when I lived in Pittsburgh, but I still make an effort to come back a few times a year for the ambience. It is great in the summer and fall because they have a few tables outside.  The staff is great and the prices are reasonable, too. The only change I could think of would be to put on some soft easy listening music. It'd make the vibe a little more comfortable!"}
{"text":"I love this place. It's great to meet up with one (or a couple) of people here but there is very limited seating. It's nice to be able to bring your dog and sit outside in the warmer months, though! The staff is always so incredibly friendly and talkative - always there to suggest things and to make you laugh. Such a \"hometown\" type of environment."}
{"text":"I come in here a lot with my boyfriend to read or study or just hang out. Literally everything they make is perfection. Their mochas are heaven and their coffee is pretty much perfect. Their paninis/sandwiches are incredible, although a little on the expensive side. This is very much a neighborhood institution. There's always the same old guys sitting outside and at least one biker grabbing coffee. One of these days we're?going to buy some of the art they have hanging inside. This is also a great spot to meet up with clients or just generally discuss business. It's a very productive yet not pretentious atmosphere."}
{"text":"BEST COFFEE IN PITTSBURGH!  You might think there is better coffee elsewhere.  You're wrong!  I love this coffee shop, and there is a second location the Gates Building at CMU that I like to go to--their panini are to die for.  I love this place, and you will too!"}
{"text":"I loved Enrico's - talented, friendly baristas and excellent coffee.   Prior to my 3-day visit to Pittsburgh, I did a few searches to find some places to check out. This place soared to the top of my list and I'm so glad my friends were able to accommodate my wish to spend a little time here to enjoy the coffee.   We arrived late afternoon and were able to snag a table in the front area by the side bench. Our group of 4 had a hot chocolate (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/VaQhUU3P4Z5A3oYPsEMbkw?select=uVENzI1bJBnaixbrQhwDxg), 2 small lattes (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/VaQhUU3P4Z5A3oYPsEMbkw?select=b7sSeMMurott79Bf4hK6mA) and 1 medium latte (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/VaQhUU3P4Z5A3oYPsEMbkw?select=UqQ_WNMtHEDrxMpwl6GL6Q) (me). I also had a raspberry truffle biscotti (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/VaQhUU3P4Z5A3oYPsEMbkw?select=63mohShztFN0qKjhFsHFVg). The latte was delicious. Carefully poured, the swirled milk and espresso combination was divine. Oh and the biscotti cookie? One of the best biscotti cookies I've ever had. It wasn't too crunchy actually but the raspberries in the cookie really shone throughout which I loved.   The place was filled with other patrons on laptops using wifi so I would imagine this is a great place to get some work done.  If I lived in Pittsburgh, I'd make a point to come here often. Since I don't, I will just make a stop at Enrico's a must-do whenever I'm in town."}
{"text":"Charming neighborhood cafe with a variety of baked goods and breakfast sandwiches. The service was good and food was delicious. Reasonable prices."}
{"text":"This place has caught my eye a number of occasions and I finally decided to stop in today. I'm very glad I did!! This coffee shop is exactly what Millvale needed! It's so cute, very well priced and they even have food and pastries! My mocha latte was delicious! Thank you!!"}
{"text":"I can remember the time when I used to strictly drink mocha frappuccinos from Starbuck's thinking that it was the be all end all to coffee in my younger teens. Don't we all miss those days of being so naive?   Admittedly, I never finish any coffee that I drink, not only because I'm apparently wasteful now that I think about it, but also because I'm a slow sipper and everything settles at the very end. Make no mistakes, I will finish any coffee drink from Tazza D'oro and at record speed. It is delicious to the very last drop and the best part is, they don't think that third degree burns go hand in hand with their coffee -- it's ready for drinking the moment you receive your order. Let's not forget about the food, which is also delicious. it's clear I have nothing bad to say about this establishment.  Some of the staff remembers your order to a tee and all of them are always very courteous. The prices are reasonable and the location is great, tucked away in Highland Park."}
{"text":"Stopped in for some coffee with Andy P. during our road trip from Dallas to Connecticut.  Andy had been trying to teach me about coffee for much of the trip, and this place served to be the ultimate field trip.  Everything Andy said is right - amazing stuff!  Get a latte, even if it means spending the rest of the day on the can.  Ambiance: 22/25 stars Food: 25/25 stars Service: 20/25 stars Bathroom: didn't use it Probability of going back: 100% (we will meet again!)"}
{"text":"Cute little spot in a sweet neighborhood. Snag a table before ordering and you'll have a great experience. I stopped in for a cappuccino and sandwich. The cappuccino was hot and satisfying (good quality beans, strong). and the vegetable panini adequate (I'm not the biggest fan of artichoke leaves).  Good spot for reading a book and eavesdropping on strangers' conversations."}
{"text":"Still one of the best places to get soy capps, but they no longer have an extensive tea list. What's left is not a bad selection, but there are dramatically less choices, so it's no longer where I would go to sample new varieties of tea. Sandwich menu is even more severely limited and it seems that pretty much all the food is provided by U.S. Foods, or the like; nothing is local. It'd be way cool if they would source their pastries and bread locally. Until then, it is simply a great place to get coffee and espresso, with nice vibes and pleasant service."}
{"text":"This place is nestled in a nice location next to the city water reservoir and highland park, making it a great place to grab a coffee if you are out for a morning walk. It offers a clean and casual interior and draws a more eclectic crowd than most cafes- leans a bit towards the business casual crowd. Still ha that neighborhood feel though. I have never had food there though they offer paninis. Great desserts. Good espressos and okay coffee.Outdoor seating. Good place to study. Plenty of laptop outlets and free wireless."}
{"text":"We ordered a double espresso which looked more like a single shot. Cozy coffeeshop with an ample amount of seating.  There were different types of coffee available for purchase to drink there and beans to take home.  Cute neighborhood coffeeshop type feel."}
{"text":"I had always meant to visit Enrico's, and since my friend recently moved to the neighborhood, it was a perfect opportunity to cross it off my list.  So here's what I liked: the cappuccino was perfect. It's an awesome cappuccino, topped with a cute foam art leaf.  Here's what I didn't like: Sometimes I take my cappuccino plain, sometimes I take it with a shot of syrup. On this occassion I asked if I could get amaretto syrup, which they had. But the barista responded: \"No, you can't.\" He said they only make their cappuccino plain, and if I liked sweet, he could make me something special, but I would have to trust his taste. Here's the thing...I don't like sweet! I don't have much of a sweet tooth. I just wanted a tiny bit of sweet, so I didn't think trusting his mystery concoction was a good idea. I just got it plain.  I'm not a big fan of coffee shop snobbery nor the fact that this guy seemed to have sterotyped me as a Starbucks-guzzling yuppie who had to be shown what a \"REAL\" cappuccino tasted like. Please, I lived in Italy, I've had a \"REAL\" cappuccino...but right now, I want a flavor shot in it. I still tipped because I wasn't sure if it was the barista or just a general rule at this place, and he did offer to make me something different. I just don't get what the deal is here...why do they even bother having flavor syrups if you're not \"allowed\" to add them to your drink?   It's a 5-star cappuccino for sure, but I had to subtract a star for the attitude."}
{"text":"The environment is just what you would hope for in a coffee shop: tastefully decorated with some local art in an old building with a cool ceiling and floor. A great place to enjoy a beverage, book, and music.  I had an Italian Cappuccino. It was well balanced and I enjoyed every sip. On my way out I had a Costa Rican pour over that took me by surprise. It was incredibly smooth with a complex flavor. It rolled off my tongue without the thin taste of a poorly roasted bean. As the drink cooled the flavor profile changed but continued to please.  I highly recommend this shop if you are looking for a place to spend a few hours and enjoy everything from speaking with competent baristas to the last sip of your drink. I will be returning."}
{"text":"Some of the best coffee in Pittsburgh (and many argue that it is in fact -the- best). Really warm, rich blends, especially the espresso. The tea menu is extensive and has a lot of variety, so it's a great place for non-coffee-drinkers, too. It has a relaxed atmosphere with indoor and outdoor seating (is there anything cosier than curling up in one of the window seats with a book/notebook on a rainy day?). I've done it all here-- from writing and filing an article when the newsroom was too loud to meeting a blind date. It's a good place to linger and savor. Its proximity to the park is a big advantage."}
{"text":"One of my favorite coffee places in Pittsburgh. THey also have pretty good sandwiches and salads if you are looking for some light lunch food. Otherwise, they have plenty of pasteries/cookies to eat that are pretty good."}
{"text":"This coffee shop replaced the long gone Kitman furniture store. Big windows so lots of natural light. Concrete floors lots of seating. Two nice bathrooms. Bulletin boards for events. Counter tables small tables. Large tables. What more can you want in a space?  Free WiFi. Baked goods looked yummy but I just left the dentist so I just got a latte. Delicious and reasonably priced. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"While I love getting an occasional Americano here, when I went in this morning to get a special \"start my Saturday early\" drink, the two people working made me feel like I was a total nuisance. I walked in very soon after they opened and tried to be friendly and talk about a commercial shoot that they just had, and they both just stared at me like I had no place being there. It really set a tone for my day and made me feel so unwanted. I'm really disappointed and it'll take a lot for me to go back."}
{"text":"Outstanding lattes. Period.   The service can be *very* slow, but the latte is worth the wait. And, the staff does not seem to care to chat with customers, but they make darn good lattes so who cares.  Tucked in the beautiful Highland Park neighborhood among many historic houses and close to the handful Bryant street restaurants, Tazza D'oro is a fantastic place for coffee lovers like me. A nice short walk from Highland Park is a welcome plus. Get the latte, take a stroll down the street to explore the houses, and take a walk in the park. That is a beautiful and coffeeful sunny summer afternoon for you.   They also have food, but I cannot speak for that. The interior is somewhat run down at places, but that gives it character."}
{"text":"The epitome of 4 stars: Excellent without being perfect. Tucked away in the middle of a charming old residential neighbourhood, you'll likely miss it the first drive by. Turning around is worth it.  Yes the staff tends to be the typical hipster, bike-riding sort that so commonly seems to staff indie coffee shops, but they're friendly and unpretentious, so don't hold it against them.  The patrons are almost exclusively college students (anyone else tends to drive by and take their coffee to go), though hipsters are actually in the minority here.  Anyone under the age of 25 will fit in perfectly, and no one 35 and under will feel uncomfortable.    The noise level is perfect.  Most students are on their laptops with headphones, a few are chatting quietly, and the background (indie) music is just that.  You don't need headphones to concentrate here.  Decor is decent without being great.  The ceiling is crossed by beautiful wooden beams, and the floor is a pleasantly bland creamy ceramic tile.  So is the wallpaper, though the original modern paintings tend to help make things interesting.  Where it loses points is in the furnishings: the mixture of wall lamps, hanging fixtures, and pot lights doesn't work well, the serving bar itself is an ugly cheap laminate, and the touches of plastic greenery dribbled around the place fails misserably.  Iced water is provided, which is decent (plastic cups are a minus), but inferior to the mineral water other places serve. We tried their richly brewed Ethiopian to rave reviews, with the party split on whether the thick ceramic mug was a plus (hefty and warming) or minus (hard to drink from). Truly fantastic coffee, but the lattes were rather disappointing: Beautifully steamed milk in every cup, but a rather bland espresso shot left the latte rather lacking in the nuanced flavour one finds in a 5 star establishment.  The medium latte (12oz, with 2 shots of espresso -- the steongest ratio they offer) should have been far better.  The food looked worth having, but we'd just eaten. Homemade pastries and fresh sandwiches looked tempting, and we certainly will come hungrier next time.  A solid four stars, held back a bit by decor and a lot by espresso."}
{"text":"Quick service, amazing coffee, nice vibe."}
{"text":"I was a little apprehensive & had my reservations about the place when I walked in. This is only due to the fact that all of the patrons were either douchebags / bitches doing their homework/studying/being a hipster, or parents with ugly screaming kids. I rarely get pissed at screaming kids, but I have come to learn that it's because most kids are cute. The ones at the cafe on Sunday were fugnation citizens. The douchey hipster bitches irritated me because they each took up an entire table (reserved for 2 or 4 patrons), and then proceeded to scowl and dart death stares at everyone else who was trying to talk or eat or make noise. LISTEN UP ASSHOLES, IT'S NOT A LIBRARY, SO DON'T GET PISSED WHEN THERE ARE NORMAL SOCIAL NOISES COMING FROM A PUBLIC CAFE. Besides, you are going to fail your exam/write something dumb on your macbook pro anyway, so either put your intellectual props away, or stop being an ass.   Ok, moving on. The cafe was easy to find, lots of parking along the street, and the location is great. The people who worked there were awesome. So kind, patient, and genuinely happy to be working there. The baked goods were phenomenal, and they are all made on site or locally. There were SO many to choose from! The artichoke pesto panini was delicious (just not hot; it actually got cold before I got half way through the first half of the sandwich), and the cappuccino was perfect. The ratio of coffee to milk & foam was exactly spot on.   I did end up eating as fast as I could and leaving because of the screaming kids and jerkface factor, but I would definitely visit the place again and get some coffee and make small talk with the baristas."}
{"text":"What a sweet little spot in a sweet little neighborhood. I remember thinking if I lived here you would see me here every morning and I'm pretty sure that's how it works with this place. Lots of regulars.   The coffee is delicious!! There were a number of hand pours and French press selections it was hard to choose. They all sounded amazing. The pastries were drool worthy. My daughter had the salted caramel brownie and the other a scone. Both were devoured in two seconds flat, so there's that. I on the other hand was looking for a bit of vegan protein which I found in the chickpea salad. It was good. Not fantastic, but did what I was looking for. I would try something else next time. The panini seemed to be a hot seller.   Service wasn't fast, but we weren't in a rush.   Definitely a great place to do work or read a book. We sat at the tables out front on a lovely Saturday morning watching dogs walk by and people ride their bikes. Very cute neighborhood. A stop at Highland Park after was a perfect way to spend a morning just outside of downtown Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"World class coffee and scones with a charming staff. A real winner."}
{"text":"They just opened a spot at Carnegie Mellon, on campus in the Gates building and it has changed my life. My closest coffee option before was Seattle's Best, so you can imagine how delighted I was when this opened next door to where I have class all day.  The first week they were open I think I went there about 4 times.  The Italian Cappuccino will wire you for a few hours, but is totally amazing.  Their basic coffee pales in comparison to their espressos though, so stick with espresso drinks. I have also had two delicious paninis, which I highly recommend.  Knowledgeable service. Great drinks! yum!"}
{"text":"Best coffee shop in Pgh, or at least in the East End.  Tasty beverages and light fare.  Nice blend of local Hipsters and Boomers."}
{"text":"I love tazza.. Their coffees are excellent and its a great place to enjoy a relaxing evening..I also like their Baklawa, sandwiches and Brownies.."}
{"text":"Great variety of coffee and methods (press, Chemex, pour-over).  I did not get a chance to try to the espresso, but it looked very good as well. Verve and Olympia are two very solid roasters and provide a wealth of choices.   Staff was very helpful, location great. All around a good place in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"As if in answer to my prayer.  I'm not basing this review on the quality of the coffee. I had Rooibos tea and a (delicious) apple galette.   I'm basing this on the fact that I love this style of coffee shop (could be in Seattle or Portland). And the fact that since coming to P'burgh for a few days for the first time, it's the first aggregation of non-grumpy people I've been around. Well, to be fair, all the partying college students on the South Side last night were not grumpy. Maybe it's that the folks sitting around me here at Tozza Doro are just chilling, quietly dong whatever they are doing, and not being overly grumpy or self absorbed.   They don't apear to have more than coffee and pastries, but they do have free wireless.  There is not as much in this neighborhood as I thought there was going to be, but if you find yourself here, and you like non-corporate, home grown cafes, this is a great place to chill."}
{"text":"one of the best espresso bars i've been to.  +1 for great espresso.  i had a shot of ethiopian espresso.  fantastic!  grabbed a costa rican pour-over on my way out ... perhaps one of the best cups of coffee i've ever had.  +1 for baristas who pay great attention to detail  +1 for great atmosphere.  the ceiling is tastefully ornate, and the decor is pleasing.  hearty wood furniture used throughout.  +0 for having a location a bit far from downtown.  a favorite for locals and not-so-locals alike.  highly recommended!  i will return..."}
{"text":"Although I am not a coffee drinker, I do love their iced mochas!  They have wonderful teas, cider, hot chocolate.  The servers are wonderful and the brownies, as big as your head, are like crack.  Amy, the owner, has created a wonderful place for community."}
{"text":"Love it here! My boyfriend and I always walk our dog and stop for a latte/cappuccino while passing by. The pastries and sandwiches they serve are amazing! The gluten free snickerdoodles are the. best. Never a disappointment! I absolutely loved that they offered Kistaco local apple cider! By far the best around!"}
{"text":"Millvale finally got its coffee shop. It was a long time ago that Amy Enrico had looked into opening in Millvale, but it wasn't meant to be, and instead it was Highland Park that was the lucky destination for that fine establishment. Something like eighteen years later and Tazza d'Oro is now present in this grungy yet charming little borough. (Sorry, I'm plagiarizing NextPittsburgh. https://www.nextpittsburgh.com/city-design/new-tazza-doro-coffee-shop-to-anchor-millvales-bennett-station-project/ )  With giant roll-up garage door windows opening into a spacious room beautified with an old school ceiling, orange bar stools and white hex tiles, the new Tazza d'Oro is  decidedly more modern than the original. They're still loyal purveyors of that good ole Counter Culture, and I got a pour-over of the Guatemala Sipacapa kind. The congenial barista dude brewed it perfectly and I walked away with a better cup of gold than most places could offer.   Millvale looks like it's set to be heavily revitalized and Tazza d'Oro is at the forefront, kindly leading the way just like it did eighteen years ago. How many Pittsburgh favorites am I allowed to have?"}
{"text":"I would never have found this place if it wasn't for yelp.  It is somewhat hidden among lots of houses and residential buildings.  I ordered a latte and blueberry scone, both were great!  I wanted to order food but I was told that they do not serve food (even breakfast) until 11 a.m.  I would go back if i am in the area."}
{"text":"I can honestly say I've never left this place disappointed. I've tried multiple drinks and baked goods and they are all delicious. Baked goods are all from local companies. Fresh, delicious, get in my belly. Coffee is roasted and brewed to perfection. They have seating but get there early because it's usually a full house. They just opened a new location in Millvale that I can't wait to check out."}
{"text":"This is one of my two favorite coffeehouses in town. It took me far too long to come around and love Tazza D'oro. A horrible ex of mine loved this place and I admit that this soured me. I regret the time I wasted not going here. The dark wood inside comforts me. The small tables outside are a great place to spend the summer.   Tazza D'Oro brews Batdorf and Bronson beans (amazing), provides Enrico pastries (amazing) free wireless (amazing) and one of the most talented and friendly staffs I've ever met (amazing). Everyone who works there is *so* nice and *so* good at what they do.   They have a small menu of local/fresh food that looks amazing, but I have never actually eaten it. The espresso served here is actually better than the average shot served at Batdorf and Bronson locations in Olympia, WA. I talked about this with one of the barristas at TD'o and they were offended - \"we calibrate our machines the same, we use the same beans, the exact same blends and milks and everything, it can't be different.\" Sorry, Tazza D'oro, you are better.   The lines get long on weekend mornings, but they move quickly. There's a sense of community nestled here, just off the \"main drag\" of Highland Park, between Bryant st. and the reservoir. This is where you can pick up your CSA shipment for the week, where multiple weekly bike rides originate, where there are lively discussion groups meeting nearly every day. The percentage of students is low. Like the rest of Pittsburgh, there's a good chance you'll run into someone you know, but generally I see people I like and miss, which is different than the norm in Pittsburgh for me."}
{"text":"Cute little coffee shop with great coffee and snacks. A great place to get some serious studying done cause it's always so quiet. Service is always friendly and prompt."}
{"text":"Great, authentic coffee at a reasonable price. The pastries are really tasty as well but pricier. It is a great atmosphere to catch up with a friend or just relax with a cup of coffee. The staff is also very friendly!"}
{"text":"This isn't my favorite coffee spot just because it's so close to my house... It's my favorite coffee shop because of the coffee!!... And the very nice baristas... And the delicious brekkie sammies... And the chocolate chip cookies... And the outdoor seating... And the nice people who work there. Oops. I said that already."}
{"text":"Tazza, you slippin! When I first came to Pittsburgh, this place was a solid five star coffee joint not as good as I remember. Still in the top tier of Pittsburgh coffee shops but not even a contender for best anymore. Vegan apple cinnamon donuts were great but steamed milk on latte was less wonderful than I remember. Brownies: Still a real surperative. But damn, when I'm going to a place like this, for me it's all about the steamed milk."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times for coffee and to do work. I have never had food but I have tried a variety of coffee drinks. Their coffee and espresso is very good, it definitely has a distinct flavor than a lot of other places. Their baristas take great care in making drinks, all of the lattes come with charming art. It is a good place to sit and do work, they have lots of outlets, fast wifi, and peaceful atmosphere. I will definitely return when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"::Chris Trager from Parks and Rec voice::  This is LITERALLY the best mocha I have ever had in my life.  ::end voice::  Seriously, tho, how is this possible that this was so good?!? I'm astounded!   Just go get coffee here. Just do it. End Nike copyright infringement, begin L'Oreal copyright infringement: You're worth it."}
{"text":"So I went on a marathon 2 hour bike ride right before heading to Enrico's for the first time and on my last mile all I could think was \"iced caffe mocha, iced caffe mocha\" over and over again.  Did I mention that I forgot my water bottle on my ride too?  I was a desperate woman at the end of that one.  So I got home aired myself out and drove myself to Enrico's since a previous yelper mentioned she had the best iced caffe mocha there.  There was easy street parking right out front and I really liked that it was nestled in the middle of a neighborhood and not a loud crowded street.  Tables are large enough for good work space and folks had their laptops out inside enjoying the free wifi while the tables outside were filled with friends.  So why the 3 stars?  Well the iced caffe mocha was a bit subpar.  The syrup was all at the bottom leaving my first couple sips very watery.  Could have been a better mix.  Would I give this another try?  Sure but I definitely will ask for a nice hard shake of my iced caffe mocha before taking a swig.  The coffee place at the Walnut Mall in Shadyside is still my favorite for the iced coffee of the year award.  Try the iced OR blended ghiradelli mocha when you are shopping Shady-style - AWESOME!"}
{"text":"Wonderful place for both great coffee and a cool Atmosphere for working with chill, usually good music and interesting crowd.  If I wrote anything more it would be over kill.  That's all you need to know.  Oh, except it's a good looking crowd and tell them to stay open later at least one night a week!"}
{"text":"I've lived in highland park, right around the corner for 10 months and never went until today. DELICIOUS!! best mocha I've ever had. (Coming from someone who's never gone to Italy seeing as how so many posters here have said that lol). The food is good to. Has a croissant, fruit tart and apple pastry thing. So delicious!!"}
{"text":"This place was pretty cool.  I mean defiantly felt like a place with a bunch of regulars, but i felt welcome inside.    All I got was a cup of coffee and a apple pastry.  My mother got a espresso.  Both drinks were good, but for being one of the top rated places on yelp, I expected more than what I expirenced.   The apple pastry did not seem very fresh, but it was still very good and worth eating.    I guess I was just a little disappointed because I expected so much more than what I got."}
{"text":"I just moved into a new place in highland park and realize this place was right next door. I'm a huge fan of coffee and have never been quite satisfied with the taste ever since my trip to Italy(where there coffee is to die for). This place makes me happy with coffee again. I've also had lunch here and bagels for breakfast both very delicious. This is my new place!"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic. One of my favorite places to hideaway and get some work done or just read a book."}
{"text":"Great new location of an old classic.  Wide open feel and industrial aesthetic. Plenty of tables for working and relaxing. As always, Tazza has a great selection of drinks and alternate diary options and syrup flavors. Pigeon bagels and delightful pastries and available for a quick breakfast. The staff are all super nice and always remember their regulars. Decent amount of street parking is available and stay and check out what Millvale has to offer while you're there!!"}
{"text":"Tazza D'oro is a wonderful Highland Park treasure.  The staff is phenomenal and the drinks are superb, some of the best in Pittsburgh.  Having lived dangerously close to Tazza, the staff got to know our regular drinks which was always nice.  It does sometimes get rather busy/loud on weekend mornings, so if you're looking for a quiet place to study or work make sure you're prepared."}
{"text":"On three separate visits, I've enjoyed three great cups of coffee. No complaints there. Unfortunately, that consistency hasn't been there for everyone. On a visit with my wife, her latte came out far too milky. Probably just a mistake, so we reasoned that this place deserved a second chance. The next time around, we order a pair of cappuccinos, one with vanilla --  Now, before I go any further, I recognize that cappuccinos are typically made without sugar or added flavoring. I have also been to a ton of neighborhood coffee shops, have heard the question \"wet or dry\" a thousand times. Sometimes a \"wet cap\" is really what you're hoping for in a latte. And even when it's not, like most people, I don't snark or complain when someone gives me a cup that isn't quite what I was hoping for. I usually end up liking it anyways. My taste buds aren't that delicate.  Perhaps you can see where I'm going with this story. Vanilla cappuccino. I get it, it's not something that's done. But when someone asks you for something you don't sell, just explain the situation politely. If you feel the need to snark, share knowing glances, or anything along those lines, just stifle it. Trust me, I've seen many professionals perform better with requests far more ridiculous. There's really never any need for snobbery. So I've got to dock Tazza d'Oro a bit. Too bad, because the coffee is pretty good."}
{"text":"My mission before graduating is to try all the independent coffee shops in Pittsburgh. Tazza D'oro came highly recommended from my friend and I didn't need any reason to go to any coffee shop. My girlfriend and I stopped in to grab some lattes and catch up. We also decided to get their baked goods. I never had a mocha that was so smooth and I loved my chocolate croissant. The noise level was relatively quiet and it may become my new study place. I will definitely be coming back for more of their coffee!"}
{"text":"The coffee here is amazing (I love when the baristas take the effort to make patterns in the foam). The baristas were extremely friendly and the pastries looked delicious. While there are a number of tables, Enrico's was busy even on a Friday night...I would imagine that it would be hard to find a table during peak hours."}
{"text":"I stopped in for a latte to-go after eating breakfast at Pamela's. Opted for the featured Lavender Latte. My latte was good. Priced according to most coffee shops in the surrounding towns.  I felt like I was witnessing gentrification with my own two eyes upon entering. It's brand new and modernized. I will always be a sucker for the old steel town charm... and this business doesn't fit into that classic small town Pittsburgh mold. Has a hipster-middle-class-Lawrenceville feel.  Overall it's a very nice little coffee shop."}
{"text":"I really was missing Voluto before its new ownership / management took over, on Penn Ave.  I Needed a new place to try with friends who live in Highland Park for an excellent cup of fancy Joe. I'm a steamed milk kind of gal.  Starbucks bless them when I am in a rush but i have to order a tripple just to get a hint of my fix, but the coffee here is the right strength to cover my caffeine withdrawals. Lovely atmosphere small but not tiny, outdoor seating if you want it. Their espresso shots are not served in steamed cups.  Take note if you're a hardcore ezzzspresso shooter and you like it piping hot. I am sure if you asked they could probably warm the cup. The baristas are so friendly and laid back and funny. Also the staff members let me use the bathroom after closing one time perfect gentlemen :)   A decent selection of yummy pastries to compliment your coffee awaits from apple turnovers to decadent brownies.  I also like the crowd that comes here, there are younger people, older peopler and everyone inbetween (the 30 somethings and 40 somethings) my age group. It has a neighborhood feel but I can tell people come from surrounding areas, Tazza is a great example of merging the old and new in Pittsburgh while maintaining the character of its home borough."}
{"text":"Modern hip coffee in Millvale.   A new thing I do is travel about Pittsburgh like a nomad and work for a bit at these types of spots while sipping coffee and hoping to be inspired.  Tazza D'oro is a welcome addition to Millvale and is just one of the many new small businesses adorning the aging streets.    The drink list is great, and the pour over options are superb.  I did not get a sigh when I ordered it either.  They have pastries and small lunch options, the cookie was awesome.  But the king is the Pigeon bagel!  I would only say one negative thing, because of it's modern decor/space it does get noisy.    Great shop!"}
{"text":"Delish chill creamy latte! Iced latte well done. Casual quasi cozy. Great spot to relax and work on your laptop or like me talk with a dear friend! Great staff and personal service. Yay for GF donuts, triple stars added for that."}
{"text":"Definitely a nice addition to a growing Millvale. The coffee is your basic common place coffee you see in alot of other Pittsburgh shops.  The space is the big sell.  Awesome garage doors that open in the summer, and tons of natural light.  They don't do foam designs on their drinks, which while doesn't change the flavor I feel takes away from the experience.  Staff are friendly, but overall the place is underwhelming compared to what it could be."}
{"text":"Best independent coffeeshop I've ever had the pleasure to visit.  Best americano I've ever had.  Some of the best espresso I've ever had.  Great desserts, pastries, and cookies.  Good food.  The employees are awesome.  The owner apparently put the shop there because their neighborhood didn't previously have anything like it.  The shop is also all about bicycling as transportation, sponsoring regular group rides around town, and also group walks for those not bicycle-inclined."}
{"text":"Wonderful! Lovely! Quaint! One of the most refreshing cafe's in pittsburgh! My visit was a 'surprise' from my boyfriend who knows how much I appreciate fine espresso. I was instantly enamored with the set-up inside and the pleasant nature of the individuals who greeted us behind the counter. The baked goods were absolutely fabulous and we literally would have bought one of everything if we hadn't come to our senses. I ordered a grande cafe mocha and it came with a wonderful rim of whipped cream (I believe the whipped cream was homemade as well.... simply to die for) and a subtle addition of foam art which just shows how considerate the baristas are of their craft. My boyfriend ordered the italian cappuccino and said it tasted just like the drinks he would get in Italy over his 2 week visit with family this past summer. Now if that isn't representative of a solid job in bringing a European Cafe to the States, then I don't know what is!"}
{"text":"Very nice coffee shop!  A lot of seating , they have big garage style doors that open up to outside, we sat there with are coffee and watched the people pass by.   I had a mocha latte it was very good, I'll definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Cute little shop! I take my daughter here after school sometimes for a green tea and a snack. Everything is delicious, we've never been dissatisfied. The staff is very friendly as well! My favorite coffee/tea place in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Refuge from the snowstorm, kind service, just wish it were a bit quicker.  My husband got a shot in the dark coffee, I got a yummy goddess tea, and those were great. The service was excellent and the patrons working away on their laptops gave off a good vibe. I definitely want to come back and get some work done here.  We had a great chat to the barista. The mushroom panini sandwiches took a bit long to get, even though there wasn't a rush lunch crowd. The mushrooms were cold, I think Id prefer them warmer? - the side salad was great."}
{"text":"Cozy little neighborhood coffee shop with a decent cuppa.  They make decaf fresh, as a pourover for no extra charge.  Seems pretentious but isn't too bad.  Could use more outside tables.  In another city, probably would rate higher.  But Pittsburgh has so many wonderful coffee shops, this one just gets a 3."}
{"text":"Perfect little local coffee spot.   There's always a good drip coffee available and a number of pour over options available.   The table of baked goods near the register is not to be passed up. It's always worth trying something new there.   The staff is friendly and helpful, even when the place is packed and the line is long."}
{"text":"Beautiful chill environment, lovely awesome coffee and treats- this is a small gem of a place and a nice respite after you bike the bike route in Highland Park"}
{"text":"Incredible service, amazing coffee. I wanted to learn more about drip coffee so the employee walked through all the steps of the manual brew. She also helped me decide on what food to get. She was so friendly and approachable, it really made my first time in feel like home. I appreciated how much she wanted to explain and inform me as someone who wants to learn--as where I've felt more pretension in other coffee shops before. And the coffee is really very good. I'll definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Little place with a big personality. The staff is really friendly, and everything they make looks amazing, especially the baked goods that are made in house. I got an Americano with their winter Guatemalan roast, which I highly recommend! I can't wait to go back and try their food and other espresso."}
{"text":"I love Tazza D'oro! It is in such a great little area and is a nice place to spend some time with a delicious cup of coffee.  It it sometimes busy and hard to find a table (which is not surprising since it's a great spot), but I like the neighborhood feel and the staff has always been very friendly.  I usually get iced Americanos in the summer and regular coffee or lattes in the cooler weather. All of the drinks I have ever had here have been tasty. I have also had some of the pastries (and maybe a bagel at some point?) and everything has been fresh.  I'm a big lover of coffee shops and this place fits all of my requirements. While I don't live in Highland Park, it's definitely worth an occasional trip."}
{"text":"I'll preface this by reminding anyone who reads my reviews that 3 stars is a good review for me--it means it's good, but I'm not going to go out of my way for it.    Enrico's Tazza D'oro Cafe is definitely very good--I love the location in Highland Park, and the early morning crowd seemed pretty nice and very eclectic.  We even ran in to a friend while we were there and had a nice chat.    My girlfriend and I ordered lattes which were excellent--the space was overall very nice inside and while the selection of pastries was a bit thin I would say the ones they had looked good.  I do wish they had more outdoor seating, though.  It's tough to make the \"I'm a fan\" list for coffee houses.  I'll try it again and may change my review in the future.    While I\"m on the note of Highland Park, I want to join the chorus of people who are dismayed by the recent hit and run involving the two bikers in Highland Park.  Accidents (no matter how horrible) do happen, and as such I'm not as angry about the actual accident;  but to just drive away and leave people severely injured by the side of the road is pretty wretched behavior.  At this point, i only hope that if you are the person who did this, you will at least dedicate the rest of your life to doing good to balance your to-date lousy behavior.  It's never too late."}
{"text":"I love coming here to do work. This place is a little out of my way but if I'm around the area I always like to stop by. I mostly am writing this review because of their consistent excellent customer service. Their food and drinks are absolutely delicious and you can tell by all these reviews. I just want to give a shout out to the wonderful people who work there.  The other day I was so embarrassed forgot my wallet. The staff at the coffee bar told me to not worry about it just come back to pay for it when I get a chance. I really appreciate that. Of course I came back to pay for my drink a week after :-D The atmosphere here is great as well. People love coming here for gathering. This place just gives a very friendly welcoming vibe. I would definitely recommend it to everyone."}
{"text":"Now that's a nice latte. One of the better lattes I've had. I'd highly recommend it. I only got it to go, so I can't comment on much else. But I'd recommend it. Parking is a pain."}
{"text":"Really beautiful new shop! I'd been to the one in Highland Park, but it's been ages. Still, I feel like this shop has a more modern feel to it, but still has that cozy feel the original Tazza offers.  They have a variety of coffee bar bevvies to choose from. They offer up a good chai, so that keeps me happy! Plus, love seeing gluten free goat donuts being offered. They also have a variety of breakfast sandwiches to choose from, as well as pastries.   There's ample seating, and a nice little bar area along the window you can sit and gaze out, while you sip your drink and contemplate life... or work. Whatever fits your fancy!"}
{"text":"What a cute little coffee shop in such an idealistic setting!  I sat amongst the gathered hipsters, moms, friends, ladies who lunch, power business lunch people in a sunny little corner of the room sipping my delicious Indian Spice black tea.  Service was very friendly and looking at the fresh pastries and lunch list of homemade soups and sandwiches made me want to come back and enjoy a leisurely afternoon or perhaps work day here taking in all they have to offer.    I was surprised when I asked to see the tea list and the barista told me they didn't have much to offer.  Still looked like a good amount to me and I was pleased to see a variety of different offerings some coffee shops don't offer (because, well, they're usually coffee focused!).  I also enjoy that they use loose leaf tea, so you know it's not just coming straight outta a generic box of Twinings.    FREE internet is always a big plus with lots of outlets.  Now if someone could just find me an affordable house in Highland Park this could just be my next favorite neighborhood coffee shop!"}
{"text":"My favorite coffee in Pittsburgh.  And now they have a branch open in the Gates Computer Science building on CMU campus!  The food is a bit expensive -- for the same price I'd rather go to Whole Foods.  I come here on my bike, I come for the coffee.  Cappuccinos, Lattes, and Macchiatos are amazing.  I was also quite surprised how good the regular coffee is which includes one free refill."}
{"text":"The people who work here are very rude. I have gone back a few times thinking it may have just been the person working that day was just a rude person, but no it happen every time. I am not a young hip person and felt very out of place there. It is like you are walking into someone's house and bothering them. The people working behind the counter act like you are interfering with there conversation. Plus it is very dirty. Perhaps the people working there should try cleaning the place instead of talking to each other. I will not go back again."}
{"text":"What a great find! I frequent the nearby Bryant street restaurants, but did not even know this place existed until a friend of mine brought took me here today for hot chocolate. I immediately fell in love it. The baristas were very friendly and my hot chocolate was great! There were also some incredibly delicious-looking pastries which I will need to go back soon to try. There was a nice ambience - it was quiet but not uncomfortable so. It would be a great place to study, read, or visit with friends.  You should expect to wait a few minutes for your drink, but it is well worth it :-)"}
{"text":"The gem of Highland Park, a marvelous place for local community to gather.   The coffee is the best, and it's so different than the big chains.   The food is excellent, and the service is friendly.  Definitely the best place to go to see your neighbors and friends."}
{"text":"Some of the best coffee I've ever had.  Ever.  Stick with an Italian Cappuccino and bring a good friend for some good conversation."}
{"text":"Best coffee it Pittsburgh? Maybe, but this place is certainly competitive. French Press, Drip, espresso, or pour over? You name it they've got it. Only downside of this place is a limited food and pastry selection. If it is just coffee you want you this is the place. It is it a bit snobbish sure, but not nearly as much as many of the other coffee shops in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a coffee, was excited to stop in finally. Really cute place inside , beautiful decor and nice vibe for sure. Not busy at 9 15 on a Saturday, about 10 people in the place. Menu for coffee seems pretty normal and the food and snacks they had looked very tasty. Coffee was excellent . The only drawback was that it took 10 minutes for me to get a simple cappuccino. I'll give it another try at some point , hopefully the coffee service gets faster ."}
