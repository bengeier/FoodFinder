{"text":"You won't find a better neighborhood pizza joint than this....family-owned, great tasting pie, and friendly service - all at a good price.

M3 MUST: Do stop in for their fantastic lunch buffet.  Different pizzas, soup and salad....yum."}
{"text":"Well let's just add this to the ever-growing list of pizza I will never eat again. While the picture may not look bad, it's deceiving. This is typical frozen pizza. The crust is paper thin and has that odd, defrosted taste. 

I guess if you're desperate it'd be ok  I mean, I have actually had worse pizza but I won't be going back."}
