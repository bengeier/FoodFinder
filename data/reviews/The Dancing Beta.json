{"text":"Eck!  The tempura is more like 'shake and bake'  vegetables and the vegetable rolls were made with difficult-to-chew/swallow nori that had a detectable fishy taste.  I really wanted to enjoy this place, but will go back to buying grocery-store sushi from Acme."}
{"text":"I ventured back in about 6 months after my initial visit, hoping that the quality and service would have improved.  I'm sad to report that they haven't.  While the owner is a very friendly guy and really values his customers, the quality here remains terrible.  On my last visit I ordered a sushi roll and it tasted sour.  It was absolutely foul.  So disappointed.  :("}
{"text":"I saw the other two reviews of this place from 2010, and I feel like I was in a totally different restaurant. I don't know if there were problems with the launch of the restaurant or if something changed for the owner / chef, but I am being serious when I say I think I just had one of the best meals of my life, let alone one of the best sushi experiences.  At the urging of a friend we went to have dinner at The Dancing Beta, and ordered the Chef's Choice (omakase). When asked to set a dollar amount, I told him $60, and expected to receive three or four rolls.  What we got started with an appetizer of fried crab rangoon balls and a sweet soy dipping sauce, then a brilliant and simple maki roll combining fresh tuna and and thin slices of temple orange that was bursting with flavor, the sweet acid of the orange working amazingly against the fatty tuna.  After that, we had an inside out roll with crab and cream cheese, topped with tuna, sliced chiles, and soft roe, then finished with warm wasabi infused oil. The texture and flavor contrasts were excellently balanced, and provided a wonderful mix of flavors and spice without becoming too hot.  Next up was an inside out philly roll, then a \"crab rangoon\" roll - but the crab rangoon roll had been breaded, fried, and sliced! Amazing crunch and the filling was still cool, creamy, and tasty.  The daily special roll was a \"Jersey devil\", combining fried shrimp, crab, and Sriracha.   The final two rolls were a smoked salmon roll with fresh kiwi slices, a surprising but really pleasant combination, and an edamame, grilled unagi and shredded seaweed roll.   To our surprise, though, Chef Paul wasn't done. To finish our meal, he provided us with a complimentary slice of delicious cheesecake - made in house! - drizzled with warm honey. A perfect and unexpected finish to the meal.  The operation is small - it's Chef Paul, a server, and one runner in the kitchen - but you can tell they are working hard on attention to detail and taking care of the customers. I noticed as we were eating that one table had ordered a tempura banana dessert, and a few minutes later I saw the kitchen runner come out of the back and run up the Acorn Alley street. Then the server came to the table and explained that they had run out of bananas, so their runner had called one of the other nearby restaurants and was going to go pick some up for them!  The willingness to go out and get the bananas, rather than simply saying \"Sorry, we're out\", says volumes about how they want to take care of you.   Seriously, if you are in Kent and want something amazingly good at this tiny, hidden gem, go to the Dancing Beta. Put yourself in Chef Paul's extremely capable hands, and be prepared to be surprised."}
{"text":"I went here opening week and the presentation was bad and the nori was so chewy it was hard to eat. I had been waiting with such excitement to have a sushi restaurant in Kent and after waiting for months after the original open date, I was not impressed but I figured it might just be that they were new. I tried it again this week and unfortunately, nothing has changed. I actually tried to peel the nori off of the rolls to make it edible. I have seen many similar reviews in other places and unfortunately the owners must not believe them. I will continue making the drive up to Montrose to go to Sakura, which is fantastic.  Also, the atomosphere is really bad which doesn't matter when the food is good (for example the Indian restaurant, Raj Mahal). I agree with the others that the prices are way too high. Sakura has similar prices plus they have $3 maki rolls on Monday and the quality is just nowhere near the same.  I really wish that the owners would listen and get more training because I really want to like this place, but I just can't."}
{"text":"Don't go here. Simple as that. The sushi was not fresh at all, overpriced, and the restaurant itself was very awkward and uncomfortable. I much rather would have gotten sushi from a grocery store than eat here. I was so excited about a sushi place finally opening in Kent, but what a let down Dancing Beta  was. If you want incredible sushi, make a 20 minute drive to Sakura in Akron. One of the best sushi places I've been to, and being from NYC, that says a lot."}
