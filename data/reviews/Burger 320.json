{"text":"Set your expectations low.  Then half that.  And that's what you'll get.

Everything about it is just off.  Going for the first time, you'd expect some level of service where they explain how it works and all the various options available.  Nope, none of that.  Order a bbq onion chutney burger expecting that smokey sweet savoriness?  Nope, scratch that.  Would you like a moist burger with no seasoning or flavour?  Oh yes, they have that.  Or how about a bun that is 3 times bigger than the meat and therefore overshadowing the main reason to eat a burger in the first place?  Yep, there's ton of that.  And pair it with some soggy fries that feel and taste weeks old?  Tick that box too.  But wait, there's more!  You asked for parmesan-garlic fries yes?  How about we'll give you just a tiny bit of that parmesan-garlic because we're rationing like it's world war times.  And let's call our plain ketchup misleadingly Balsamic Ketchup because it sounds hip and different.  We'll throw that in too for free.  

Maybe I came on an off day, but based on the moderately positive reviews so far, I was expecting something half decent.  But no, I received only half of that.  Actually, come to think of it, I probably got only a quarter of that at Burger 80."}
{"text":"Delicious! Was fairly expensive but worth it. The parm fries and garlic aioli were amazing. I added the onion chutney to my cheeseburger and it was great! 

Cash only but there is an ATM at the 7-11 next door. 

Staff was really nice. Felt like my mom making my dinner!"}
{"text":"I would give it zero stars if it were possible.  I had a milk shake which was mostly ice and lacked any vanilla flavor.  The poutine - gravy had no flavor and the fries were nothing special.  The burger - biggest disappointment.  The patties were dry and not moist.  The bun was dissapointing also.  Limited toppings for the burgers - onions, argula and tomatos.  They forgot to serve the aioli I ordered on the side. I definitely would not pay $30 again for such a lacklustre meal.  There are better burger places in Calgary.  McDonalds serves a better burger.  There is only room for 4 people comfortably to dine inside. If it's winter there is no where to eat.  In the summer there are two picnic tables.  The space is so small that there is little room for customers to read the menu, order and wait for the food to be cooked.  They only take cash as well.   There is a giant debit machine inside which occupies much of the space as well.  I don't recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"Wow, I had burgers from 320 before, but I think Bruno sold his business, because the burger I had tonite was downright horrible! The patty was so thin, the bun was too thick, toppings, sauce was so skimpy that I had to add more ketchup, mustard at home! Good thing I had leftovers at home to rely on! I had take out and the food was placed into a plastic bag, my burger and fries was soggy when I got home to eat it, I had to broil the fries again to dry and crisp them up. I got so frustrated paying for bad quality food that I threw away the bun and just ate the wafer thin patty. Never going back!"}
{"text":"I've always had a good experience at Burger 320. Love the burgers and the Parmesan garlic fries. I've noticed some people same Chef Mario isn't a pleasant guy but he's always been great when I have been there. Like many others have said, keep in mind that it's cash only and there's no seating inside."}
{"text":"This little burger stop opened just 10 days ago.  I decided to try a classic - cheeseburger and fries.  The bun has the 320 seared into it which was a nice touch.  The burger itself was flavourful.  You can add a variety if cheeses and toppings but again I chose to judge it on the basic cheeseburger merits.  The bun was just a tad dry on the bottom half and the tomatoe slice not yet ripe, but it is still winter in Calgary, so I can appreciate fresh produce can occasionally be a struggle.  There is only seating for one and no bathrooms so be prepared to take it to go."}
{"text":"I visited during Calgary's burger week. I only found out about this event on the last day and after trying Burger 320, I wished I had known sooner and had visited at least a couple of times that week :)

I had a sprouts burger with mozzarella cheese, rosemary french fries and a tiramisu gelato for dessert. All of it was simply de.li.cious! The patty: fresh, rich, made from scratch! The bun: big, soft kaiser bun. The fries: perfect amount of herbs to give it a different flavour. 

The only downside is that the place is tiny. I am totally ok with buying a burger to go, but if busy you may have to line up outside in the cold. That takes away a lot of its charm."}
{"text":"Awful.

Ordered a couple of basic burgers and fries to take home...got home and ended up throwing away half my burger and my boyfriend threw his away.

Watched the meat being cooked, they put a lid on top of the burger patties and basically steamed them. The meat was absolutely awful tasting. Flavorless and bland. The bun they used did not improve the bad taste of the meat either.  The fries were chopped and thrown directly into the fryer which resulted in soggy starchy fries. Could not even eat more than 3 fries they were soggy and oil-filled like noodles. Literally oily noodles.
 (Fries 101: the less moisture in the fries before you fry them, the more crispy they will become hence you need to soak them in cold water and pat them dry)

Everyone was in total chaos in the kitchen for customers to see...kinda embarrassing for them. The guy working the grill looked homeless. I just sat and stared at the mayhem while i waited for my order.

We paid nearly $40 for two burgers and one fries to share. We will never eat here again it was simply poorly done. Yuck.

By the way the \"italian gelato waffle burger parlor\" theme really sucked. No branding or identity here. Very confusing and chaotic. Hire a branding team and fix your food guys."}
{"text":"I like how this little shop is a bit rough around the edges. Like others have mentioned, it's tiny and only takes cash. It was super busy and our order took a good 25 minutes for the portobello mushroom burger and the double up ( two patties). 
The ladies who took our order were very friendly. The owner was being a nicer version of the soup nazi, telling people to take their food and \"be gone\", or would wonder aloud why they were back already, when they were just served their order 5 min ago. 
None the less, it adds to their down home charm. 
While my mushroom burger was on the small side for $11, it was nice to have a different veggie burger option than the standard soy/ oats and bean type. 
My bf's double burger more than filled him up. I enjoy the soft, homemade buns. Being white, they were not doughy and easy to bite through along with the burger. 
The fries were cooked fresh to order and are done shoestring style. It could have had a bit more Parm and aioli on it, but over all I liked the way they serve theirs on the crispy side."}
{"text":"Omg this place is delicious!!! Next time though I think I will split one order as there was no way I could finish. The burger was exactly the way you make it at home and the fries reminded me of my mothers home cooked ones from when I was a kid. I will most definitely be back. I'm really interested in trying the vegetarian mushroom burger next time as it sounds amazing."}
{"text":"I went here today to see what all the hype was about. I am not impressed at all. Typical burger, yeah its better than McDonald's or Wendy's but for the price you aren't getting much. Fairly small burger tasted ok. Fries were heavily overrated. The Parmesan fries tasted only like oil, no other flavour. Took 20 mins to get my order. The gelato again also overrated, flavour was nice but it had ice chunks in it which shouldn't have been there. I spent $15 bucks for the meal and I would honestly say take that money and spend it at Smash Burger or 5 Guys. This place isn't worth your money. I wont be back. Staff was friendly though. Come with cash if you decide to go, they don't take cards and the 7 eleven next door gouges you to use their ATM."}
{"text":"first thing to remember...CASH ONLY!! you won't notice it till you finally reach to the front of the queue after waiting for 10 mins and find out that that there are no debit machines!...its true 7-11 is right next door but you're starting all over again haha

Quality - The burger is decent. Not the best one in the city but it's not as greasy. I can't say much about it other than the fact that its a slider not a burger!! Don't go in expecting to fill you up because it wont :(
The \"truffles\" poutine was something I was looking forward to. It wasn't what I expected as they had deep fried the truffles and added fried potato peels for god knows why. It's not a traditional poutine as there were no gravy nor cheese curds. (Read the menu carefully next time *sigh*) The batter was actually really good and the aioli sauce and the parmesan flakes complimented well. 

Price - the 320 burger was $7. It should've been only $3,50 to $5 (max) or they could give an additional burger :) for that price. 
The truffles poutine was $17! After a few bites, you wonder on the quality of the truffles since its heavily battered and fried. Not sure if the very limited number of truffles justifies the price to be that high.

I will recommend this place as the staff was friendly and helpful. The food is decent and the restaurant will give you a unique experience (unique being no place to sit down haha). Just don't go in with a high expectation as you will most likely be disappointed. I will definitely go again, this time bringing CASH upfront!

{"text":"In the context of fast casual dining, Burger 320 is as good as it gets. We are particular fans of the chicken & waffles. The chicken is moist and tender due to it being so fresh (the affable owner Mario sources all his ingredients from local farms). Also, no dry waffles here, rather they have a texture reminiscent of French cruller donuts, with a moist egg-laden open cell texture. I would suggest eating in rather than taking out as the hot freshness of all the food will turn to tepid sogginess in closed containers and a plastic bag. The garlic Parmesan fries are a prime example of this...perfect in store, but flaccid if brought home to eat. The homemade gelato & burgers are also of the highest quality, so it's pretty hard to go wrong here..."}
{"text":"Very cool place. Has that \"I'm too cool for McDonald's and I know more bands than you\" kinda vibe that I like. I had the sprouts and hemp burger (I think that's what it was called) as part of yyc burger week. It was excellent, and was cooked perfectly. The fresh bun really brings it all together. Only complaints are that the sprouts were so long and stemmy that when you took a bite you ended up with sprouts pulling out of the bun and getting mayo all over your chin. Also, don't go on a cold day because there's almost no room inside."}
{"text":"Great burgers. Got the wickens and enjoyed it thoroughly. Burger was moist and surprisingly refined. If you want a tasty burger that isn't poorly put together with whatever gimmicky toppings some \"chef\" has decided to throw together than this is the place for you. Duck fat fries were good, seasoning salt is a must to really make them pop. 

Note that there isn't seating inside (just a couple picnic tables outside) and its cash only."}
{"text":"I finally lured the family here over the weekend for some burger deliciousness. Though I did try the YYCBurgerWeek Hemp n Sprouts burger I was itching to try one off their regular menu. 
Let's get the not so fun stuff out of the way so we can get to the GOOD STUFF! It's a small place...and cash only. There. That's the bad stuff.
Good Stuff:
When we freed our burgers from their red and white blankies we immediately let out an 'oooooh' and 'ahhhhh'.Fresh, housemade buns stuffed with house ground brisket serve as the perfect base for a burger. I had the Gladys Ridge which was so good I peed my pants. sauteed mushrooms, cheese curds, truffle aioli and arugula...Yes please! Since hubby had wandered off in search of a debit machine I just took the liberty of ordering him a Wickens, specifically because, well....bacon! And rhubarb chutney. He was duly impressed.
We also shared the parmesan fries and that was a bad idea because neither of us like to share and we almost got into a fist fight right there over the last fry.
If you are looking at Burger 320 reviews on Yelp you must be at least interested in trying it out. Just stop now and get yourself over there. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I was pretty excited to try burger 320, because I had read some really great reviews and to be honest... I'm not super picky anyway. 
But saying that.. The burger I ordered (cheese burger w added bacon) wasn't worth the 22$ I paid w a side of \"parm fries\", also not great. Everything was dry and just not up to standard. The only saving grace this place has is the gelato, which is to die for!"}
{"text":"The burger was pretty good but I'm probably not ever going to eat here again because the guy who runs the place is an asshole. While we were waiting for our food, he started calling a girl making fries \"fucking stupid\" for taking too long and implied she couldn't do it because she was Asian (in front of his Asian customers...). Just really unprofessional and super awkward."}
{"text":"Just finished eating our delicious burgers, poutine and gelato at the sunny picnic table outside! Great homemade burgers with amazing tapenades, chutneys, etc for toppings. Owners are very kind. We will definitely return for more tasty treats!  Very few spaces to sit though, so great as a pick up and walk to a picnic bench."}
{"text":"Yummy as sin!  
I've gone here a hand full of times and the food is so delicious. If you're looking for a real burger go here, you won't be disappointed. 
The place is small (only 320 square feet) so be prepared to take your food with you or eat outside on a nice day.
Great homemade burgers, fries and gelato."}
{"text":"The Background:

Full disclosure, I'm a Bridgelandian (some are Bridgelanders... but I'm a Bridgelandian - they're much more hip) and always like to support businesses in the neighbourhood.. self proclaimed 'Chef Mario' has been around in various guises for a number of years... The first try I recall was Pimento Pizza in the (what was then) new strip mall thing on 1st avenue beside the Starbucks... and later he moved to the building that's now Burger 320 and tried again... it just didn't work.  The pizza was decent but you couldn't order ahead, you had to pay with cash, they didn't deliver, there was no seating... and there are half a dozen other places you can get pizza in Bridgeland.  End result was that Mario's pizza shop was almost always empty.

The Resurrection(!!):

I clearly remember my 'first time'... at Burger 320.  It was probably March 2014(?)... I was driving home and I saw the new sign... I thought \"what the heck... let's see what Mario's up to with the new place...\" didn't have to wait... just walked in, ordered a 'Wickens' burger - cheeze burger, bacon, RHUBARB relish (that's crazy good!) and I substituded some blue cheeze for the cheddar...  I wanted to cry.  I literally dreamt of burgers that night.  I went back a few days later and told Mario that he had a serious problem... once word got out he would not be able to keep up... 

...sure enough, over the summer it was tough... lined up every day, lunch mission impossible... I'm hopeful though that at least over winter I might get a burger! 

Things to note:

- it's cash only(!) - but there's a bank machine at 7-11 next door
- there's NO seating - it's take away only/eat at the pic nic tables outside
- cooking takes a while - if there are 6 or 8 in front of you, expect it take 20+ min for your order
- it's not just burgers - the fries are good, the fried mushrooms will kill you but they're awesome
- It's not just about meat - I mistakenly ordered a vegetarian mushroom burger and it was fantastic
- it's NOT McDonalds pricing - maybe a little expensive for a 'fast food' burger but you get a 'Happy Meal' every time ;-)"}
{"text":"Great fantastic food Mario was also the best Piazza maker in Calgary .All the Pizza places in inner city learnt to make pizza from him all his buddies that own pizza places in bridge Inglewood and other area need to thank this man he is the Master of Pizza Burger and probably the best Gelato in Western Canada.
I come to 320 once a week  blue makes his own patties and bread and make his own sauces.
Keep up the good work Mario you deserve it.
Oh forgot to say he used all natural products ."}
{"text":"I eat a lot of burgers and this is hands down one of the best in this city. A bit pricey but worth it. They only accept cash which is kind of a pain."}
{"text":"This place is a huge ripoff. The burgers are no better than fast food quality and are about five times more expensive. $12 for a burger you can eat in about 5-6 bites. Me and the 3 people I was with were all still hungry when we were finished, and our bill came to $90. I will never ever eat here again. 
How does the owner justify charging $25 for a tiny burger and a poutine?! How does this place have an average 4/5 stars??? I am so confused..."}
{"text":"My new fav will def recommend to friends love it's a little small but that burger is so juicy and good like wow friendly staff over all awesome experience"}
{"text":"There is no question that the food is tasty. They have unique choices for burger toppings. 

When you go make sure you expect to wait because it will take some time. Also they only take cash."}
{"text":"Was really happy to see that Burger 320 was opening another location in Kensington and was super excited to hear that they were going to offer chicken and waffles on their menu! I was already a big fan of their burgers, so I knew that I was in for a treat when I ordered their chicken and waffles yesterday. The chicken was the star in my opinion, as the chicken was super moist and had a perfect crunchy buttermilk coating. I was also a big fan of the white farmhouse gravy and appreciated the side of maple syrup and dollops of hot sauce on the side of the plate. It was easily  one of the best chicken and waffles I've tasted in the city! This location offers tables and chairs for you to enjoy your meal, which lacks in their original location in Bridgeland. The only reason why I gave them 4 stars based on this experience is because the fries we ordered were a little soggy, they just could have been left in the fryer a bit longer. Maybe something I would request next time I make a visit."}
{"text":"OMG burger fans...this is the real deal. Blink and you'll miss it so keep your eyes peeled for the little red 320 shack on Bridgeland.

There is nothing pretentious about this place. The menu offers combinations that make sense. For example, the Wickens burger has bacon (three thick and lovely slices of it), block cheddar, and BBQ rhubarb onion chutney...WHAAAAAAT?!! I think my brain just melted. 

The little touch of arugula is fresh and crisp - what a relief from plain old lettuce.  The aioli is subtle but still adds a little something special. 

For all of you fellow glutards out there, they do have a GF bun (which they've called the girlfriend bun lol). But for today, I went with their traditional bun with 320 branded on the top. (Yes, I'll suffer later but so worth it.) There is something about this bun that is pure magic. Soft, yet doesn't get gummy after a bite. Keeps all of the juices in check and there wasn't a hint of soaked bun by the end. Worth. The. Pain. 

Now, onto the fries that are cut right there in front of you. That's what I call fresh! Went for the Parmigiano Garlic fries with truffle aioli on the side. I ordered a small...see the picture and you'll see what value looks like! These fries are perfect without anything at all on them. Add the garlic and Parmesan and you have something super. 

The side of truffle aioli was worth getting. Not overpowering at all and a must have for me. 

The gal at the grill said to me \"we're just a tiny little house\". My answer was \"tiny house, big flavour!\""}
{"text":"The bomb!!!  Best burger on planet earth. Start with lightly seasoned freshly ground flank steak from Alberta beef cows. Best on earth. Grill it perfectly, top it with an array of home made, expertly prepared and imaginative goodies. Add artisan cheeses and put it on a made today in-house bun. How can you loose?

The crew are wonderful, the food is great. 

Bring cash money and an empty stomach and leave sated with a big grin on your face. 

Mario is a serious chef who has turned his skills to burgers and fries. You can't go wrong."}
{"text":"I don't get it... Everybody loves Mario; LOVES him.  I've gone to eat at 320 3 different times; once he threatened a staff member (it was packed and boiling and maybe he was frustrated, but... Dude!), once he totally ignored me while he chatted w a 20 something gorgeous blonde, and the third time he invited a young couple into the back so that they wouldn't be too hot... Meanwhile me and his other customers were dripping sweat.  I didn't mind until he whisked away the others.  I felt like a schmuck.  The food is good, the options are plenty... But I'll vote w my money... And spend it elsewhere.  I won't be missed."}
{"text":"Grabbed burgers and an order of fries on Saturday around supper time. Place wasn't exceptionally busy, but it still took the lady taking orders a bit to acknowledge me being at the counter. Ordered 2 cheeseburgers, one with bacon and a small order of garlic parmesan fries. It was almost 30 bucks! I was floored at the cost. I had heard good things about Burger 320 so I figured what the heck.  Waited about 10 or 15 minutes to get my order and proceeded to go home to eat it. That's where the disappointment set in. Firstly, the garlic parm fries were just their regular house cut fries with a blob of garlic aioli on top and a couple spoonfuls of parmesan. Not at all appealing and frankly the aioli had way too much garlic. My burger was alright, although there was tomato on it, without my wanting it. The other burger was enjoyed, but was noted that there was too much bun and not enough burger. Not sure I'd go back based on the cost for what we got."}
{"text":"Went for a bite to eat before heading next door to PRLR for some cocktails, what a great decision. 

Had a really big lunch so shared a burger with the boy. He loves trying burgers as they come to see if they are really as good as proclaimed. Gonna say this one is. Delicious flavour from the beef, soft baked in house bun, with balsamic ketchup on the side. 

Friends we were with tried the parmesan garlic fries with aoli (giant box full), milkshake, and chicken + waffles. All were proclaimed excellent. Love that we got to see Chef Mario branding the tops of the buns too!

Got to speak to Chef Mario a little too and he is friendly and had all the time in the world to answer all the questions we had before making our choices.

Didn't get a taste of the chicken + waffles so feel that will be happening soon... maybe with different burger accompanying it."}
{"text":"Bring cash. No debit. No CC

NO SITTING 
Picnic table in summer outside orctake out

Good special fries. Ok to good burgers depending on your taste.  Good gelato

Attention: Cooking patties wait time"}
{"text":"Came here for their gelato and shakes. Sooo amazing! Except a bit pricey. Shake was $14 and taco was $9. Otherwise, mindblown!"}
{"text":"Best burger in cowtown!  Have been many times and consistently enjoy the burger and fries.  Everything is always cooked to order so you are guaranteed warm, fresh quality food always!  Fries are not too salty like MANY other places.  Burger patty size is flavourful and just the right size.  Bun is fresh, puffy and love the charcoal branded 320 on top, very creative!  Tried the gf once and prefer the real bun and just make sure to take my enzymes after to digest.  Highly recommend just remember to bring cashola or pop over to 7-11 if you forget."}
{"text":"Hands down best cheeseburger I've ever had. Loved the fries with the balsamic ketchup and tons of vinegar side options. If your looking for a tasty burger this is where it's at."}
{"text":"Went with a friend in a bit of a hurry, we got our food eventually, but everything about the experience was disappointing. It started with the service. The manager played that role of 'deliberately bad service', which I thought was part of the shtick. We asked for specific combos, and both had our orders mistaken. He didn't ask us for any options on the burger and missed some of the basics. He was ridiculous, but we thought he was going with that trend of bad service. 
The food came out sub par, and the orders were wrong. I went back to ask for cheese and he kept up the act and pretended I didn't ask for it. He made the concession but went down swinging, cursing without being lighthearted about it. I was trying to be cool with the guy but he was excruciating. I do not recommend anyone to this place. The food wasn't 100% terrible but the service just took away all the potential. 

I went out of my way to write this because the guy was consistently unpleasant to every customer regardless of the way he was spoken to."}
{"text":"What can I say about my local burger joint, that hasn't all ready been said. Fresh daily baked buns, killer garlic sauce and made in front of you fries. Try the  Witkens classic and enjoy! Yum Yum!"}
{"text":"Went early for dinner. Caught everything at it's freshest; enjoyed a really terrific burger (Wiggins). All the toppings sung! Have had hit and miss experiences here in the past but this was really terrific. Staff are always friendly here!"}
{"text":"So I took my lady out for a juicy Burger the other day and we found ourselves in Bridgeland at Burger 320. I've been before but she hadn't and she wasn't disappointed. She had a traditional cheeze burger loaded up and I went with the signature 'Wickens' burger. We also split a LG garlic&parm fries. The food was fantastic. Great selection of toppings and sauces, cooked to order and served on a beautifully warmed up squishy bun. Fries were perfectly crisp, seasoned and piping hot. My only small complaint is the price. $30.00 for what is essentially 2 cheese Burgers and 1 fry is pretty steep. (We grabbed a fountain pop from 7-11 next door) however if you don't mind spending more for a tasty Burger I highly recommend a visit."}
{"text":"It's a one stop shop for a food junkie- burgers, pizzas, milk shakes, parm fries and ice cream! Good place to hang put with friends. And the owner was very attentive!"}
{"text":"I was in the neiborghood and decide to try burger 320 after hearing so hype about it.
Don t believe the hype. The burger is really average. from the cold bread to the just ok topping and orange craft sheddar.
The place also does not look clean and professional. 
Not in my to 20 burger in Calgary for sure."}
{"text":"We have just moved to this neighborhood. Glad to find this place! Burgers are very decent and tasty. Not junky for sure. And Parmesan fries are delicious as well. We took wickens and glady's ridge this time. Both were great."}
{"text":"IMO the best burger and fries in Calgary. They make their own buns and use authentic Alberta beef. Try it with the grilled jalapeño. To top it off they are warm and friendly."}
{"text":"Pretty decent burger - I had the Glady's Ridge and loved the combination of the arugula, cheese curds, truffle mayo and sauteed mushrooms - all resting on a lean, healthy tasting beef patty.  The soft, pillowy bun with the 320 branded on top is a nice touch! The burger is on the small side, but I was decently full afterwards so if you've got a bigger appetite, you may need to get some fries too! Only downside is they do not have tap water in house - bottled or canned drinks only.  And it's a really small restaurant - three tables of two seaters at best."}
{"text":"I had the Gladys Ridge.  It was good as I like sautéed mushrooms but a bit greasy.  Patty was fresh.  I like their creamsicle milkshake as well.  Owners were very friendly.  I'm not a big burger fan but it was worth my visit."}
{"text":"Burger 320 is a quirky and fantastic addition to the 1 Ave strip!  It's small so don't plan on staying. Burger 320 as in 320 sq. feet. Don't worry if you're driving by and the lineup is out the door, there may very well only be a few people there. They've got a couple picnic tables in the yard so if it's a nice day you can enjoy your burger in the sunshine. I picked up the hemp and sprouts burger special for YYC Burgerweek 2014, and while this burger may be off the menu at the end of the week I know a few things will stay the same. The sprouts were SO good! Very fresh, crisp and flavourful. If the lettuce, tomatoes and the rest of Burger 320's veggie toppings are anything like their sprouts, you're in for a treat. Can a burger be refreshing? Thanks to the sprouts, this one kind of was.
 
I received a good tip that the parmesan fries (for $4) are not to be missed and I couldn't agree more. They come with fresh grated and super potent legitimate parmesan and a good size dollup of mayo. Parmesan Fries: 1. Get them. 2. Have gum or mints handy for after. 3. don't leave the box in your car for any length of time. Your vehicle will smell cheesy fast! Hey, it's just really good parm!

Burger 320 is nothing fancy and everything quality. I can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"What? I'm the first place to write a review for this place? Well then... I better make this good.

I ordered the burger with cheese curds. The bun was freshly made and not your typical Safeway deli bun. The beef patty was lean. The ingredients were top notch, from the cheese down to the produce. I really liked the addition of arugula in the burger. I actually felt somewhat \"healthy\" after eating here.

I tried some of my friend's fries. She loves the fries here as they will cut the potato right in front of you. The fries taste real too, they actually taste like a potato. Crazy huh? Lots of Parmesan shavings and a dollop of not too garlicky aioli topped this delicacy. 

Yay! I'm a fan."}
{"text":"Hot-biggity-burgers this is one fine grill. I hope by now you've had a chance to experience the charm of Burger 320 in Bridgeland, but in case you haven't: burgers crafted of fresh brisket, ground daily on-site from locally raised beef, with fresh local farm ingredients served inside fresh-baked, branded buns, (deep breath...) with gelato to boot, all inside one super tiny, beyond minuscule shack of a building.

The new Kensington location rocks the same concept as the first, but with one big change - no more tiny shack! Epic burgers, to-die-for parm fries, delicious gelato, all in a space that you can kick back in and relax. They're licensed and carry the full lineup of Unibroue beers from Quebec. I'll let you in on a little secret: Beer and burgers go really well together!

With the bigger size comes and increase in menu to go along with it. They've added waffles to the list and feature a list of sweet and savour concoctions ranging from a s'mores waffle to a philly cheese steak waffle. My favourite so far - chicken and waffles. They're expertly crispy, juicy, and come served with a white gravy, maple syrup and some dollops of Sriracha. It's a comfort food flavour explosion.

Fave burger: The Wickens - beef patty, wicked good bacon, block cheddar, aioli, arugula and BBQ rhubarb onion chutney.

Go here. They're open late too."}
{"text":"I can't write too much about this place because I didn't get much when I went here but I was happy to see they had so many flavours of ice cream. Green tea is my favourite kind of ice cream and usually it is hard to find a flavour of green tea ice cream that isn't very strong but this place has an amazing homemade flavour of green tea ice cream! I'm not a fan of burgers really so I won't be going back for a burger but I will be going back for more dessert items. They had interesting facts on the walls to showing that this place is local to Calgary which was nice to see too!"}
{"text":"I came here on a Sunday evening for dinner and I thought everything was very average.  The interior was clean and modern.  If you get just the plain burger, it's $9 but the add ons add up quick ($3 for mushrooms, $3 for bacon etc).  My boyfriend got a combo with a burger, fries and gelato for $20 (no drink).  I thought the burger patty itself was very thin and the bun was too thick.  They had ice cream tacos (gelato in a waffle taco shell) which looked good but we didn't try them.  There are so many good restaurants in Kensington, I probably wouldn't come back here."}
{"text":"nothing special here.  CASH only.  The burger came upside down because I asked for no mayo.  The meat is not flavourful.  The meat is only ground brisket, which is horrible for burger meats.  You need to mix 50% chuck , maybe throw in some eye of the round and then the rest brisket.  

The cashier handles cash (ECOLI laced cash as studies have proven), and then proceeds to make burgers without washing her hands."}
{"text":"Took hubby here for a very late lunch around 3:30 p.m. on a Saturday.  The place was actually empty when we got there, but by the time we left, it was packed with people.  I ordered the burger and DH ordered the duck egg with waffle bread.  Our garlic-parmesan fries order provided us with enough fries for two to share.  We ordered milkshakes too and our order came to $43.  I tried DH's duck egg atop the waffle and it was good.  My burger was good and not greasy.  I was charged an extra $1 to have pickles added to my burger fixings and they forgot the pickles, so I had to ask for them.  The people behind the counter were pleasant enough, but nothing seemed to stand out as being extraordinary.  DH was happy with his meal and mine was OK.  We did get to try the duck egg, which we never had before, so that was a plus.  I liked the gelato milkshake, but it was a bit bland.  I actually could get used to milkshakes made with gelato as the fat content is way down and so are the calories.

Burger 320 has long, large communal tables at this location to suit parties of 6 or so, which is a big plus if you are looking to eat with a group of your friends.  The place was clean, and we liked the background music, which was set at the right volume and did not interfere with our conversation.  The trick is to get there when they are not too busy so you can score a table without having to wait.

All in all, it was a good experience with no complaints."}
{"text":"Well it's been named 320 for the square foot size of the restaurant , I think it's smaller lol . I went with the gf and her son and we all ordered burgers and 1 order of poutine . The gf and I had 320 burgers and the son had the wickens burger . My burger was tasty but I was disappointed in the bun and so was the gf , it was crumbly and I thought stale . The poutine wAs great and the cheese curds and grave were close to awesome . The best was the son who said his burger was\" the best burger he has ever tasted\" . We got lucky with seating when we arrived , when our order was ready the 3 people sitting were just leaving . I felt uncomfortable eating inside as there was a rush of people while we were eating and it felt like we were being rushed ... They need to do something about a seating area ( just saying ) !"}
{"text":"A little expensive but well worth it. Burger buns and patties are made fresh everyday and it really makes a difference in the taste!"}
{"text":"Was lured to Burger 320 by their engineered eat entry at this year's beakerhead which focused on the ingredient eggs.  It was a red velvet waffle with their in-house made gelato which is amazing and they they lit it on fire.  Yup,  flaming gelato!  What the what?  They used whipped egg foam to insulate the ice cream from the flames.  Boom. Science!  So it was pretty awesome to watch this all go down and eating it was also equally delicious.  

Moving on the the main menu (since we were good mom and didn't just eat dessert for lunch).  Burgers are awesome.  Not much else to say -  not all that fancy but very tasty.  We had the truffle poutine and that completely missed it's mark with me.  It was way too big (even to share) and it was just fat of fat on fat and although there was flavor it fell flat for me.  We took it to go thinking we'd pick at it later and we wasted it - sad because it was actually quite pricey. 

Overall Burger 320 seems like a great place for a burger and gelato (which was a wonderful reminder of a scorching summer I spent in italy).  I would skip the sides next time.  

The down fall to Burger 320 is lack of indoor seating, being cash only and being a bit on expensive for what you're getting.  They had classy sit down restaurant pricing for elevated take out food and the bill came to more than we typically carry in cash so there was some awkward change searching from the depths of my bag to try and settle up."}
{"text":"A really good burger. Got the Homestead. It's a cheeseburger, fries and shake for $19.  Chose of fixings and chose you cheese. I had the blue cheese. Friendly service. Fries are fresh cut and good also. They also have balsamic ketchup and if you like balsamic it is quite good."}
{"text":"Pretty decent burger.  I ordered the cheese burger with brie and parmigiano garlic fries.  The bun is freshly baked (and branded) but I found it too big and thick for my liking.  The burger patty was tasty and juicy and I enjoyed the fixins on the burger - including argula!  The fries were thin and crispy with a large dollop of garlic mayo and shaved parmesan cheese on top; however, some of them were a bit overcooked.

There's almost no room for seating here aside from 2 or 3 stools so don't expect to stay and they have limited seating outdoors."}
{"text":"I've read the reviews and had it on my \"must try\" list for quite sometime but finally this past Sunday I found myself in Bridgeland and hungry.  Our plans to make dinner at home were easily cast aside when I suggested an early dinner/late lunch (330).  My husband rarely turns down the opportunity for a good burger.  We opened the door and stepped in to the tiniest space and while I had read it was 320sq feet I was still surprised.  This is also about the time that I remembered it was cash only (thank you previous Yelpers for this tip) and promptly visited the cash dispenser at 7-11 next door.  We each had a cheeseburger (hubby added bacon) and shared a generous order of garlic parm fries.  The two seats were occupied when our order came up so we opted to zip home and were pleasantly surprised when to find our food was still warm after the commute to Parkdale from Bridgeland.  All this without any major traffic violations enroute.As photos will attest the branded \"320\" on the bun is a nice touch but the bun itself is wonderful!  Nice density, not dry and he perfect size for that ideal bun to burger ratio.  Fresh garnish and the home made relish was delish!  The burger was nicely seasoned, not too greasy but certainly not dry.  Hubby equally enjoyed his with the addition of the bacon and complimented the overall savory taste.  The garlic parm fries are just YUM but I will warn you if you  aren't sharing your dining partner better be forgiving as you will have garlic breath to be sure.  The aioli is really subtle but like most garlic sauces it has a slow build to a pretty big impact.  All in all terrific food but I can't finish this review without complimenting the absolutely lovely service.  Who doesn't love being called \"bella\".  Really nice couple that I can only assume are the owners that really added to our Sunday afernoon and another great visit to the great neighbourhood Bridgeland.  This could easily be my go to burger place and I am little bit glad it's not closer to home or I could have a real problem!"}
{"text":"What a great local burger joint! Burger and ingredients taste super fresh. Selection is perfection with good mix of burgers, chickens and side of fries. 

Staff and owner are super friendly. Small location as per the name is the size of the restaurant. 

I ordered the cheeseburger with side of garlic fries with garlic aioli. Fantastic. 

Only draw back only two picnic tables outside for sit down."}
{"text":"Great burger, had the one with blue cheese on it, can't remember the name. Very satisfied with size, taste and price.  The blue cheese was definately not overwhelming, which it sometimes can be. Fries were underdone, mediocre, but I'm guessing it was a one off."}
{"text":"Wonderful burgers, great ice cream, great selection of options, and very friendly staff. I highly recommend this place. Just bring cash and know that it is take out only."}
{"text":"I think this place is over-rated. I came here with a couple of friends, and we each ordered a burger and shared a large fries. I ordered a Gladys Ridge ($12) which had mushrooms, melted cheese, aioli, and arugula. The aioli gave a different flavor which is cool, but I was very disappointed by the thin and miniature size of the beef patty. It couldn't have been more than 2 inches wide and half-inch thick. It was so small that I couldn't even tell if the meat was good or not. The buns were really good which is unique compared to other burger joints. Fries were better than most places I've been to.

For $15 which would include a small fries, I could easily find another decent burger joint in Calgary and not worry about eating elsewhere afterward. And there's no indoor sitting, only a couple of picnic tables outside so I guess you're paying solely for the ingredients. I have beef with this place (pun fully intended!)."}
{"text":"One of the best damn veggie burgers in town. Super friendly service (I'm not sure what the negative reviews are of Mario - he was extremely affable to his staff, myself and boyfriend), veggie burger on a homemade bun and delicious gelato shake. I was really impressed. Arrived after 1pm and the lunch rush had been and gone (it gets lineups out the door earlier in the day). There's only a tiny counter and two stools so chances are that you'll be getting take out. Oh and be warned that they're cash only."}
{"text":"We stopped in spur of the moment after a matinee at the Jub.  So glad Burger 320 caught our eye as we drove thru Kensington.  We both indulged in the Chicken and Waffles.  Unbelievable.  We'll be back for the burgers another day."}
{"text":"We went to the Kensington location for this and it's a nice restaraunt. With a couple wooden tables you can sit at. We ordered the wickets,poutine,and a cookies and cream milkshake.

Starting  with the wickens, I can confidently say it's one of the best burgers I've had in calgary. It looks small but it fills you. The sauce is what completed the burger and make the taste pop out.

Secondly, the poutine was mediocre, crazy wasn't too thick and didn't have much flavour.

Lastly the milkshake, it was alright. Keep in mind it was made with gelato ice cream which made it watery and not thick, wasnt a big fan of it.

Overall i would only really come here for the burger and nothing else."}
{"text":"We had a quick stop in Calgary before heading to Banff and decided to stop by for lunch. This is one of those places that really makes you sad because it's SO FAR from where you live. I was VERY satisfied with this food and could easily say best burger I've ever had! 

The place is very small building and we missed it driving by. At first glance you may think you want to turn around but I highly suggest you go in! There isn't much room for seating so it's best to go when it's not busy or take to go. The place ONLY TAKES CASH so be prepared for that. 

I ordered the Gladys Ridge burger (although I was torn between this and the veggie one) and a side of regular fries. The burger was truly amazing! The bread was soft and fresh, the beef itself was tasty, it was CHEESE overload (always a good thing!). The fries were a big portion and even sharing with my husband we couldn't finish. I saw someone else order the poutine which also was a big portion and looked amazing.

The lady working there was so kind and helpful and in a very good mood. Again, I'm sad this place is in another country and that I can't have it often."}
{"text":"Woman working the counter didn't know how to make a shake on the menu and served it to me with icecream dripping all over it and told me to grab a napkin and wipe it off myself. Giving 2 stars because the shake itself was alright."}
{"text":"Best burgers I've had for a long time. The bread is amazing. The whole store is surrounded by the smell of the freshly baked breads. 
Love the mushrooms. Must try.
Love it. Plus the owner is really nice."}
{"text":"Terrible food.  They don't know how to make a burger at all. Fries are cold and soggy, food doesn't have what you order on it.  If you just wanna get drunk go somewhere with more attractive staff."}
{"text":"Ordered 2 burgers, truffle mushrooms, Diet Coke, root beer slush and a homestead= burger with parm fries and a small gelato. $54. Cash only. They do have an interac machine onsite. 

This place is very small and had 6 seats but we enjoyed our food outside. There's about 6 picnic tables for seating. 

Burgers were pretty good but my hubby asked for half aioli and was unhappy it was smeared on. The parm fries also get a huge dollop of mayo and my mushrooms were also liberally given the sane treatment. Other than that the mushrooms were the bomb! Crunchy batter and sooo tasty/ I'd return just for this item! The parm fries were very tasty if you crave chip wagon nostalgia!  Overall I've had better burgers in the city but we enjoyed our meal overall."}
{"text":"Ate on the patio out back and it was perfect weather, and there was shade too.  I ordered a Wicken burger which was so flavorful and juicy with plenty of bacon. One order of fries was substantial enough for 3 of us.  (We are all light fry eaters though.) One of my group ordered a Gladys burger and said it was very tasty with an aoli sauce.  She said this is her favorite burger place in Calgary and I see why."}
{"text":"Sunday evening at about 8PM when I realize that I'm going to be cuttin' out crap in my diet the Monday so I decided that I want something greasy and delicious. I live in the NW so Kensington was the target area. There are a lot of options but in the end, we decided to go with good ole burger and fries.

Burger 320 more recently got rid of their waffles and chicken options. They still, of course have burgers as well as fries, box of shrooms, milkshakes, gelato and some other desserts available. I noticed that they moved some things around at this location so there's more room for seating.

When we arrived, there was another table occupied but not busy at all. We browsed the small menu and went with a burger and fries each. A went with a Burger 320 where she could choose her fixings and sauce and went with an order of parmigiano garlic fries. I went with the Gladys Ridge burger with a side of extra crispy truffle parmigiano fries and we had a seat while we waited.

It didn't take too long as we were the only ones who ordered so everything came out freeesssshhh! I immediately munched on my truffle fries as they were so fragrant. The fries were freshly cut ands were nice and crispy (as ordered) I wish they had more of a truffle flavor, I found the smell to be more powerful than the taste - good nonetheless. My burger came with sautéed mushrooms, cheese curds, truffle aioli and arugula. The buns are house made branded with '320', the first thing I noticed was the bun.....she thiiiiiiiick!!! I picked the burger up and it was hard to take a bite out of everything because of how thick the bun was. Bun alone is good - soft and fluffy. After making my way to the patty, it was alright. The patty is a bit thinner than some other burger places I've visited and there didn't seem to be much flavor. The truffle aioli wasn't strong enough to really notice it but the cheese curds were nicely melted and stringy. The argula and mushrooms were good but it wasn't a memorable burger for me. A ate her burger but wasn't wow'd by it either. Her parmigiano garlic fries looked very similar to my truffle fries, I thought they made a mistake. Sure enough it was the aioli that is the only difference - I imagined there would have been actual minced garlic and parsley throughout the fries but that's just me. 

Overall, food was good but nothing spectacular. Being a burger place and seeing their Instagram page, I had high expectations. I wished the burger patty was more flavorful and juicy and that the burger bun:patty ratio was more even. Also, it would have been nice if the bun was toasted. I can't see myself returning for a burger but I would definitely order some crispy fresh cut fries."}
{"text":"Oh wow, this is a great place. It is the perfect combination of taste, quality, and price. I got the Homestead which is the cheeseburger, gelato, and parmigiano fries for $12. The only reason it's not five is because I feel like the burger could have had a hit more substance/body to it. 

First the burger...the patty has a great flavor and is nice and moist. It's cooked to well, but that doesn't mean scorched or overcooked. The rest of the ingredients are fresh and flavorful. The only issue is that the patty is about 4 ounces so that is kind of small. But the bun is also delicious, fluffy and fresh. 

OK so these fries....AMAZING. Seriously, amazing. I read the other reviews and wanted to find some fault with them but there are none to be had. They are crispy and not too oily. They are fried and then tossed with parmesian, salt, and garlic. Definitely get the garlic sauce as well. I honestly wanted to buy a bottle of it and pour it on everything. If I was just rating the fries then it would be 6/5 stars.  

The gelato was also delicious. I got peach iced tea which tastes exactly like it sounds. Granted, I wouldn't go there just for the gelato but it definitely was a wonderful addition to the meal. 

This place is small and if it's not warm then there really isn't much of a place to sit inside. However, it's definitely worth it to drive and pick it up. I can't wait to try it again myself."}
{"text":"Good things come in small packages. This place serves fresh local ingredients in their burgers, and you can tell from the first bite. The buns are soft and tasty, but not too soft as not to stand up to the delicate burger and delightful sauces and condiments. The fries are not to be missed, thin and crispy, I highly suggest the parm fries. And once you are done, why not cleanse the palate with their selection of gelatos. If you plan ahead you can get the Homestead (which I did)- a cheeseburger (choice of 4 cheeses; I added cheddar, arugala, and garlic aioli), parm fries, and small gelato. Will definitely return!

Things to note: no real indoor seating, and cash only."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Ordered a dessert this time. A little bit on the pricier side. And their parmigiana fries are really good."}
{"text":"Mario( the owner) make this place as usual. He puts in a ton of time and effort and doesn't disappoint. 

It's just a damn good burger! Parm. Fries are awesome! It's not reinventing the wheel here. The burger plus the atmosphere equals a great dive. 

It does take a bit for the fresh homemade bun and burger but you gotto expect that. No seating so be prepared to take out. 

I though the price was decent for what was included, a burger/ park. Fries and gelato for 15 bucks. 

Really can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"I had a few employees of mine telling me about this place. So I decided to check it out. Best burger I have ever tasted. Staff is so friendly. Would recommend the parm fries (very crispy and thin) and the homestead burger. Also had the strawberry gelato which  is delicious. 
Also note that it is cash only. But there is an ATM at the 7/11. Plus it's a little pricey but worth it."}
{"text":"Just horrible!  Greasy fatty burgers that are small and way over priced.  The sauces taste kick they are out of a jar and the cooking area is dirty. You're not walking out of there under $20 for a burger and fries, what type of cheese does the poutine have??

Definite fail!"}
{"text":"Delicious burgers. I had the veggie burger which was delicious and my meat- loving husband had the double patty beef burger with cheese. Both were amazing. Customer service is mediocre but can be ignored because of the yummy burgers."}
{"text":"Dropped by this diner-like burger joint on Bridgeland's main street, circled by a few freshly painted picnic tables. All products are farm-fresh, including the beef patties and the cheeses, while the buns are baked daily following an Italian tradition. Oh, and don't be gluttonous like me, do actually STOP before biting into the perfect cross bun (where said cross is replaced by a 'branded' 320 logo) to take a picture! 

If you're on a diet and dying for the bikini body, the house chefs will gladly accommodate your request to replace the fluffy, starchy bun for a bed of farm-fresh arugula/spinach, just like In'N'Out would do a little farther south. Disclaimer:  the staff might give you stink eye, because who would say no to a fresh bun for less than $10?

I ordered the regular \"320 Burger\", priced for only $7 (!!!), which is the classic offering: 5 oz of juicy Albertan beef, served with the bun (yes!), a selection of cheese (nothing better than melted blue cheese), a fixing of vegetables for good conscience (tomatoes, red onions, arugula) and your choice of sauce for an extra. For extra cheese, you can order the cheeseburger for $2 more. 

Since I'm a real foodie/fattie, I also ordered a side of decadent parmigiano garlic fries, which, as the name states, are fries topped by a generous portion of freshly grated parmigiano cheese and minced garlic. The potatoes are lightly fried, and retain all their starchy freshness without that greasy aftertaste. 

If you're not feeling fat enough, go for the hot waffles, the gelato or the hot chocolate for dessert. Didn't have enough room for tasting this time, but will be back for those extra tasty calories next summer!"}
{"text":"Okay, I just moved to the area and every time I drive by Burger320 I want to go in. Finally, I had time and we needed dinner so it was the obvious choice.

I ordered a GF (which they list as \"girlfriend bun\" - this makes me laugh because every single time I see \"GF\" written I think girlfriend) which was thin like a pancake with the vegetarian burger (read: mushroom) and the toppings of a Cayley burger (All sorts of goodness that comes with a turnip and carrot slaw). It was DELICIOUS and messy and glorious. 

We also had white fries and they were off the chain. Like so good. Oh god I want them now. And my gentleman friend ordered the classic 320 burger, which he reported was \"legit\"

The staff was friendly and hilarious, gently poking fun at my difficult order. The coolest thing I saw was an older gentleman came in and he ordered his \"usual\" and couldn't remember what his wife wanted. The cashier was going to lend him her phone to call her, but the man who was cooking (who I am reasonably certain owns the joint and a million other joints) was like \"Oh, Lana? She wants the chicken burger but spicy. Don't worry I'll make it\". What the what?! That little old man felt so special and I was in awe of his memory and care for his customer.

Go there! Get cash first though as they are cash only."}
{"text":"Lots of options and customization. Burgers wer e just right in size. Prices were f air. Delicious!!"}
{"text":"Not worth the hype. The chicken burger had so much mayo it didn't taste like anything and there was a weird after taste in the chicken burger."}
