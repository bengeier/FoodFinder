{"text":"Ok I have been here at least 5 or more times.I enjoy their chicken calle tacos and chimis. However I tried the chicken enchiladas combo and was a bit disappointed. The shredded pollo was seasoned good and the red sauce was thin. However the side of rice was literally a teaspoon full. Really? Disappointing for $7 bucks."}
{"text":"Great place good people, was helped by a nice lady on her first day named bryce i think, good place definitely recommend"}
{"text":"20 minute wait for a bean and cheese burrito? You've gotta be kidding. Mediocre food and an unreasonable wait"}
{"text":"Love this place! Eat here 2-3 times a week and always call ahead for takeout.  Food is very fresh and the salsa's are good. My personal favorite are the fish tacos.. however the  Gordo burrito is a close second! Thank you Gordo's for great food!"}
{"text":"I always like to support small businesses.  So when Gordo's opened, we went to them quite a few times.  I especially liked their chorizo and egg breakfast burrito (and always got it without potato).  However, I don't know what has changed, but the last 3 times we got lunch/dinner there, it was not very good.  Specifically,  used to order Carne Asada burritos, and they were awesome.  Just the right mix of beef, onions and guacamole.  A couple of months ago, I ordered 2 Carne Asada burritos, got home with them and found that there was some beef, but mainly refried beans.  I called Gordo's and said what I found when I got home with our meal.  They apologized, and were very nice, but said that they were low on beef, so they added beans.  I explained that I did not want a bean burrito, but a Carne Asada.  If I would have known they were low on beef, I would have ordered something with chicken.  They said I could bring my receipt back and they would refund me, or I could get something different.  I did not have time to return and do this.  So I chalked it up to a \"whoops\" that wouldn't be repeated.   Everybody deserves a 2nd chance!   About a month later, I again went to Gordo's and again ordered 2 Carne Asada burritos to take home.  This time, the meat was kind of crusty dry (like over cooked and kept in a warming device).  Again, they loaded the burrito with refried beans.  Although I do love bean burritos, that is not what I ordered.  I don't know if this little restaurant is having $$ problems or has a new owner, or what.  Sorry to post a less than stellar review, as I would really like to see these folks succeed."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely terrible!!! If you want to pay $12 for 2 soggy and cold chicken enchiladas the size of a pack of tictacs, this is your place! There was no chicken on them and the cheese on top was hard and cold. I couldn't even eat these! I also ordered a side of chips and salsa (simple you would think) and they chips tasted about a week old and the \"salsa\" was practically watered down tomato paste. It was the consistency of water, and absolutely flavorless. This was a bland sauce not a salsa (no chunks of anything or spice just straight tomato water). Oh and should also mention the kitchen looked gross and the staff were just playing in the kitchen as i sat and waited for my cold food that was made well before i even thought of coming."}
{"text":"This was my first visit here. Its close to where I live. I was hoping to like this place because there aren't many mexican food places around.  Went thru the drive through. No one was in line before or after me. I got my \"warm\" horchata in a cup. No ice. It wasn't even slightly cool. I  had to ask for a cup of ice. The horchata tasted nothing like horchata should taste. It was awful. I got my drink right away but the food took forever.  I thought oh good itll be fresh. Wrong.. food was bareky warm. It tasted just ok. Nothing special. No smiles at the window. Just handed me the food and closed the window. I still needed napkins and a fork.  I wont be returning.  Gordos"}
{"text":"I rarely give a bad rating. But sometimes a meal is so shockingly bad my fingers act out on the keyboard out of survival. The filthy bathrooms managed to be the highlight of my visit. One could get a better meal at Petco. I imagine the convenient location keeps them going, it's not the Steak burro."}
{"text":"I normally love little dive taco shops. I will start out by saying that the staff was very nice and polite. We ordered two bean and cheese burritos to go and it did not take long. I was optimistic at that point. Once we got home to eat we opened the bag and it smelled like seafood. The paper the food was wrapped in smelled like seafood and so did the burritos. The burritos were way over filled. With one bite the tortilla tore and it fell apart. We could not finish our food and were really disappointed."}
{"text":"Very average. Not bad, but not good either. There are much better local options."}
{"text":"Terrible! 30 min. wait to start. Didn't give us our drinks. After 25 min. I asked for our cups. Dr Pepper was ..not sure what it was. The root beer was out of syrup. Food came and it was cold. The Gordo had something. .not fat consistency. .not sure what it was, so I quit eating. The kids meal was supposed to come with rice and beans. She said they were really behind, so my son didn't get. We watched 1 guy walk out without his food because it took so long. Mark it...this place will close. 1 star is too much!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why we ate here after reading the reviews, but we gave it a shot. I had high hopes for the green chili chimi, but it was flavorless, as were the rice and beans. My boyfriend got the taco-enchilada-tostada combo, which was like something you'd get in a school lunch. Both salsas were just terrible. I'm fairly certain at least half of our food was microwaved leftovers. It was a disappointing experience and we will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Best California burrito in the game!!! Seriously some fine Mexican food, and it's always friendly in here."}
{"text":"This place so far has not been a disappointment. This is my second time coming for breakfast. This time got a steal burrito and it's bombbb! The price is fair seeing that the size is massive! Thy have a small salsa bar and the red is on point. I recommend you try this joint out if you're in the mood for authentic Mexican food!"}
{"text":"Food is always really good! Fast if you call it in for drive thru otherwise about 10min or more. They have always been really nice & apologetic for wait!"}
{"text":"When Gordos first opened the food was really good. I used to recommend it anyone looking for quality, fast Mexican food. The problem is, now they are terrible. Extremely inconsistent and on a few occasions I have felt that the food was not even edible. The fish tacos used to be the best in town, however the last couple of times I have tried them it tasted like the fish was rubbed on a dirty floor before it made its way into a taco. Even simple beef or chicken tacos are bad now... it really is a shame, but will not be eating at Gordos again."}
{"text":"The sauces are fake and the food is greasy and slicked up with oils.  \: The bathroom is also dark and still under construction. The food is a disgusting excuse for Mexican food. Very sad!"}
{"text":"Chicken burrito had to be one of the worst I've had (Dried out and tough).  The salsa bar needed to be re-stocked as well.  The Fanta soda was watered down and they didn't have the appropriate lids for my cup.  Service wasn't the greatest either, as my cashier could not tell me what was inside the their #3 burrito.    Had tried them in the past and it was pretty good.  Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Have been twice in last 2 months.  This place is on my way home...(work at val vista/202 and live in Queen Creek).  I agree with Renata K's review.  I was not impressed the first time I went.  I had the Arizona Burrito...it was a touch on the greasy side, and really not much overall flavor.  I wouldn't call it bad, just something you could make better at home, therefore NOT worth spending money for.   I gave them another try today.  Ordered a Carnitas burrito, because Carnitas is what I compare mexican places by.   Unfortunately this was again a burrito with no real flavors.  Very big, but very bland.  From now on I think I will just spend my burrito money at Los Fav's down the street."}
{"text":"Yikes! Sat in drive thru for 25 mins. The lady asked me three separate times what my order was....I was the only one in drive thru. I only ordered tostadas....didn't think those were very difficult. This place is a joke. Not coming back...but wish them luck in business."}
{"text":"went there tonight with my wife and 2 year old. We had 6 tacos some rice and 3 waters. $21.00 was what the bill came to. I could not believe that the Tacos were so lights, hardly any meat or cheese for a $2.50 taco. The kids working were friendly, but friendly unfortunately is what I'm paying for. I'm paying a price for a fair value and friendliness is expected. I can't see myself going there again or recommending. Instead I will share my experience and opinion with anyone I can. It's too bad since we are so sick of B King and McDonalds. We were hoping that this place would be good. Thumbs up for starting a business or branching off of Tailgaters. Thumbs down for providing minimal value. Owners are the same from Tailgaters. The food at both places is brutal. The flyers Gordos put out at Desert Fitness are hand written. These people obviously do not share the same passion as other eating places that succeed. Go eat at Trilogy. Kids eat free and you will pay less for way better food."}
{"text":"Great place to grab dinner for the family.  My son had chicken hard shell tacos and he loved them!  I had the Ava and it was unbelievably delicious.  It was definitely worth the trip for this alone! We called our order in and it was hot and ready when we pulled up to the drive thru.  Huge portions and reasonable prices.  We will be making this a regular stop for dining out nights."}
{"text":"was so excited to see a new restaurant opening up in our area. I decided to give it a shot soon after it opened. I love mexican food and haven't been to many restaurants that have disappointed me as much as Gordo's did. The bean burrito I ordered my my grandson tasted like it had been burnt. Threw it away. My burrito with shredded beef had zero flavor so I threw it away. ended up making us lunch. Would have been quicker to walk to my garbage can and toss some money in there then wait in the so called drive thru and then park and wait for them to bring it out. I was hoping that because they were new and still needed to get into the swing of things the food would change but reading reviews from other people I see they pretty much have the same opinion. Very disappointing!"}
{"text":"We ate here about a year ago and it was wonderful.  I went again yesterday, and it was absolutely horrible!  The wait just to order was nearly 10 minutes.  There was just one car ahead of us, and we waited another 15 minutes for our food.  The tortillas used for the fish tacos were cold, and hard, they hadn't been heated.  The rolled tacos were wrapped in a way that all the cheese melted to the paper, and the meat was tasteless.  We won't be back!"}
{"text":"First time we have eaten there so we got the specials, called ahead, so good. Hand rolled fish taco was awsome. Alos,loved the dollar street tacos. The special,cadens platter was good too. I will go back and I am so glad there are food options out here. Everything was great!!"}
{"text":"This is a nice family owned Mexican restaurant.  The food is very good for a quick meal and the staff is very friendly.  The Gilbert Police eat here regularly so you know it has to be good food."}
{"text":"Cashier at this place, \"I don't really like yelp coupons anyways. Well, I don't mind if locals use it, but I don't really like when non-locals use it. Are you local here?\""}
{"text":"Tried out the drive thru today, did not call ahead and had at least a 10 minute wait. Ordered a kids meal bean burrito and Arizona buritto with small chips total came to $14 and some change. My son enjoyed his kids meal and it would have easily fed two kids. The Arizona burrito could also feed two. I thought the carne asada was good, the potatoes were okay and I could hardly see the cheese, a little more cheese and flavor would have been nice. I did not care for the salsa, it was hotter than I like. I would have liked to try the green salsa but it was left out of my bag. I will try this place again in the future to see if it improves, service was friendly."}
{"text":"The service was so-so. Food was OK. Shredded beef was good, carna asada was OK.  It seems like they didn't know what they were doing. Took 20+ min to get our food. People got the wrong order in front of us. They charge 1.50 for chips. Salsa was nothing to be proud of. I will not be coming back as there are better places to go for the money."}
{"text":"Decided to try something new for dinner the other night, and stumbled upon Gordo's.  Their menu was pretty standard for a Mexican food place.  The drive thru is a nice option when you're in a hurry as well.  For a drive thru Mexican food place, I thought the food was great.  It definitely beats Filly-B's and I'll be going back to try their breakfast menu."}
{"text":"Food was really good! I ordered the bean chimichanga and it was huge. :) The people are very nice, great service! I will definitely come again! :)"}
{"text":"Good food. Get it to go. Dining room is dirty. Our high chair was filled with old food. Also, they apparently turn off the A/C at night, which makes for a hot early lunch experience. Cheese enchilada is okay, but shredded beef tacos are awesome."}
{"text":"Great portions, yummy burritos. Try the super fries, better yet ask for a super fries burrito! Friendly service, prices about what you'd expect. Daily specials. I usually have a breakfast burrito add green chile."}
{"text":"The burritos here are the best in the area. I used to drive to Burrito Shack, but now I just get the Gordos or California Burrito here. They are filling and taste great. In fact even my teenager was full. The salsa I think is just okay, not great. They also give you free hot coffee too.  The prices are average for a burrito, but it's definitely a great value. I haven't tried anything else on the menu, but if you want a good burrito, give them a try!"}
{"text":"My family and I love this place! They're Ava chicken burritos are amazing! It's also one of our favorite places to get breakfast burritos, the steak, egg, and potato is so yummy!"}
{"text":"My family and I have been going to Gordo's for about 18 months off and on.  Always had a very good experience...especially the Surf 'N' Turf burrito.  Historically, it had cuts of steak and generous portions of shrimp cooked in a spicy sauce.    Just 30  minutes ago, I ordered one and it was not the same at all.  The menu is different, the employees are different and the burrito was not the same at all.  Did they change owners?  Not happy!"}
{"text":"Better that Filly B's. fresh ingredients. I loved the Tina burro with fresh avocado and pico ! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Probably the worst taco shop Mexican food I've had.  The manager was flirting with some high school girls instead of taking my order.  For the price, the food was not worth it.  I'll go to Taco Bell next time for better quality and a cheaper price."}
{"text":"Great burritos and always a friendly staff. We love stopping here for great food! Make sure to try the rolled tacos too."}
{"text":"This use to be my favorite Mexican place to eat but has gone downhill lately. Their breakfast burritos were huge when they first opened up.  Now you barely get any filling inside at all. They are becoming so cheap in what they give you. Food does not taste as good as in the past.  I will be looking for a new place for my Mexican food. They will not stay in business long with the new owners."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place rated as expensive... average price is about  $6. Staff were  friendly and food was made fresh. Will definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"Great place! went there this morning for a chorizo and egg burrito and they knocked it out of the park. The burrito came out hot and the cheese was perfectly melted. It wasn't this fake cheese that you get at all these other places that is so greasy. This was quality. The taste was perfect. I also tried a street taco(carne asada) was very tasty and meat was seasoned just right and moist. I spoke to Noah and his daughter who handles the orders and counter service, she was very polite and knowledgeable of the menu. Good friendly service and prices very fair. If you haven't done so, you need to try this place out for yourself."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried this place out because it was close and had a coupon deal. My husband for the Ava pollo fundido and was pretty good. The beans have ZERO taste!! I had the enchiladas... They were made with corn tortillas and had a weird taste. So disappointing. Glad I didn't pay full price! Don't think I will be back sadly."}
{"text":"So so BAD!  1st visit- Beans must have been a week old and the rice even older. How do you screw up rolled tacos? 2nd- 20 minutes in drive thru for 2 mini tacos and jr. bean burrito. They initially handed me the wrong order and then took it back.  They apologized and said they had a mix-up with a bunch of orders.  Glanced in the rearview mirror only to be confused that I was the ONLY car in the drive thru.  When I arrived home, I discovered that my order was again incorrect.  Even the incorrect food was terrible.  Never again. Too bad nice building!"}
{"text":"We used to enjoy Gordos but we will not be going back. I picked up lunch and nothing was fresh. Rice and beans looked and tasted a day old. The guac had a dark layer which is clearly from sitting.   I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great place for cheap eats Mex. close to home and seems to be consistent. Specials are good and my kids like it and they usually turn their nose up at Mex food. We'll be back for sure. Salsa selection is good too."}
{"text":"Gordos is great food for the price. The staff is very friendly and accomudating. They're breakfast burritos are as good as anyone in the area. For me it all starts with the tortilla and they have quality tortillas. I also like that they have a salsa bar."}
{"text":"This is a great authenticate Mexican food restaurant. The food is good but the place is a little run but overall a god eat!"}
{"text":"Decent Mexican for the price. We get street tacos for $1. We prefer steak to chicken. Three sauces to choose from, a spicy smokey sauce, green sauce and a red sauce."}
{"text":"This place is gross and sooo over priced!  You really are better off going to Taco Bell. Serve some authentic Mexican food and do it fast, otherwise I see this being a failed business."}
{"text":"Real Mexican food flavors. I really liked the red chili on my chicken burrito. The rolled tacos are also good. It's close to our home and there is no decent Mexican food close by. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Food was meh. Three stars because it was \"good enough\" for a second try. Hopefully it will be better next time. I had the carne asada burrito and it had absolutely no flavor at all. But my son liked it. So, there you go."}
{"text":"Nice Guys,   The Breakfast egg burrito was A-Ok.  Try the verde salsa, unique.  Just a note: the prices even for dinner are all under $8.  Seem to me to be a decent value."}
{"text":"In a few words- a well-priced, convenient alternative to good Mexican food.  First time visiting. Have to echo the interesting/slow service experiences of others.  Food is decently portioned. Although, meat portion in tacos and rolled tacos could be better. Rice and beans (and the meat we had, chicken and shredded beef) are pretty bland... but then again, I get it. It's Gilbert, one of our nation's epicenters of whitebreadedness.   I won't run back here. I think there's too many other places that are better."}
{"text":"My wife drove up today and no one was attending the drive through. She finally went in and everyone was in the back of the restaurant and she had to get their attention. She ordered the two taco meal. There was hardly a teaspoon's worth of meat in both of them. I think there's new management or extreme lack thereof. See the pic to believe."}
{"text":"Gordo ' s is one of my new favorites. They are always friendly and the food is good. I ordered the nachos, 5 carne asada tacos and a carne asada burrito.  It was ready within minutes. They have a new salsa bar that looks good."}
{"text":"I am really happy to write this updated review, and I'm glad I went back to give them another chance! The food has improved significantly since last year, and I'm in love with their red salsa/hot sauce (although I wish they would fill up the little cups they serve them in so I don't have to ask for a million of them).    Prices are a little high compared to other similar places, but for the convenience/location next to my neighborhood it's worth it. Oh, and by the way, the tortillas are awesome.   Way to go Gordo's!"}
{"text":"If someone decided to run a cafeteria out of their garage, it would be exactly like Gordo's. That is all you really need to know, so feel free to stop reading here.  I was very excited and hoping for a local treasure of a mexican food place just a couple blocks from home. I REALLY wanted to like this place!  What a disappointment. I ordered steak fajita taco salad to go. No, I did NOT do that in the drive through since it is clearly marked CALL AHEAD drive through. As I waited (a reasonable amount of time) for my food, I glanced at what people at the very few tables inside were eating.  Everything I saw looked soupy and slushy and pastel colored - all anemic shades of cafeteria food with no eye appeal at all.  My food smelled great but when I got home and dug in, the steak was barely chewable and tasted old, vaguely reminiscent of liver.  No idea why they called it salad - there was the slightest sprinkle of shredded lettuce in the bottom of the taco shell bowl, literally a spoon or so of mushy tasteless rice and about the same amount of whole pinto beans that I swear came right out of a cafeteria 5# can.  The whole thing was like hospital food at best. Geez, if I can't even get lettuce in a dish labelled salad, then I know the Mayans were right - the world IS coming to an end.  Sadly, I am pretty sure that is true at least for Gordo's."}
{"text":"I've driven by many times, but never stopped.  With a restaurant.com certificate in-hand we stopped this time.  It's a very small place.  I would estimate 10 tables/booths.  You order at a counter and they bring it to you when it's done.  The menu is a sign above the counter.  Very \"divey\".  Our group ordered a variety of things.  As always, at  a \"new\" place I order a chimi (or, in this case, burro because they didn't have a chimi).  It was very good.  Everyone seemed to like their food.  For the price this is pretty good.  The ambiance sucks, but the food is what you come for.  Not the best Mexican I've had, but definitely the best within about 10 miles of my house."}
{"text":"The food is so good! I love the drive thru like fast food, but it's restaurant quality food! The rolled tacos are bomb! The employees are super nice!"}
{"text":"My husband was wanting a breakfast burrito and he had recalled getting them from here a year ago. I ran over and picked up 3 of them up.   We we got home and started eating them they tasted awful. The eggs and meat tasted like yesterday's leftovers. No taste to the burrito and the salsas were just as bland.  For over $16 for three of them I will make my own next time.   Tried this place once, now twice and won't go back a third time."}
{"text":"Tried Gordo's out for dinner. Went through drive thru. Took 20 mins to receive food. Ordered enchiladas, chicken chimi, nachos in cheese and a kids meal with taco. It cost $39! Was really surprised! You can eat at Serranos for cheaper and about as fast. Was really hoping for this experience to be different! Staff seemed over whelmed and not very friendly."}
{"text":"This place used to be great but the new owners are running it into the ground. Too bad."}
{"text":"Came here in a good mood with high hopes. Got the food and was excited. My kids cheese enchiladas were ice cold. My husbands burrito was way to greasy and had nothing going for him. The nachos were a joke. Chips with melted cheese. That's it. No tomatoes no nothing. The only thing that was decent was the big cheese crisp that was still dry yet pretty good and if you were to get it then i recommend guacamole because it was very dry. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"I am very sad to write this review.  Was here yesterday with my husband.  I was so pleased to see a place so close to us offering my favorite.  Pollo fundido!  We passed up the drive through because of some of the other reviews on mismatched orders.  Very small place,  but nice and clean.  Good booth seating by the windows with lots of light.  The girl at the counter was very friendly.  We placed our order to go,  with the intention of still eating there,  so we didn't need to ask for boxes for leftovers.  The cheese crisp was brought out to us after just a few minutes.  Not at all crisp,  but with good flavor and lots of melted cheese.   The salsa bar had a very flavorful red salsa, a pretty good tomatillo green,  and a very hot smoked ancho chile red.  Off to a great start,  right?  We had also ordered my pollo fundido,  shredded beef taco, and several carne asada street tacos. After we consumed the cheese crisp,  we waited...and waited.  I kept looking back at the counter and noticed food packaged to go,  but assumed this was for a drive through order.    After 10 or 15 minutes of looking for our order after we finished the crisp we noticed a slight argument behind the counter and I watched as she picked up the food that had been sitting on the counter and brought it to us.  She said the \"manager \" thought she had brought the crisp to the wrong person (no,  we ordered it and there was only 2 other customers inside)  We proceeded to dig in....My refried beans,  while tasty,  were lukewarm,  the rice was cold,  and the sauce on the pollo fundido also barely warm.  My husbands street tacos were also cold.  He asked if we wanted to just take them home to microwave them,  but in an uncharacteristic fashion (normally,  we NEVER send food back,  or complain)   I asked him to see if they could possibly remake mine,  given it was sitting on the counter long enough to get cold in a styrafoam container, and I had been looking forward to this dish for awhile.  And this is where we go into Never -Never Land of food service.  She brought the container back to the table and said the cook/manager said it was. \"Still warm on the bottom, was the inside cold?\"  I said I hadn't tried that,  but the beans,  rice,  and sauce was cold or lukewarm,  and stated I had seen our order sitting on the counter for 10 or 15 minutes.  (Really?  You are bringing it back to the table to say \"its still luke warm....eat it anyway?)  I was very nice about it and she asked again if I would like it remade.  I said \"Yes,  if you would,  please.\"  She left again with the container and then was back in less than 1 minute,  handed it to me and said \"it should be hotter now \".  The cook / manager obviously threw it into the microwave.   And those of us that know about food....Crispy fried chimi with sauce on top and put in the microwave equals a chewy, sodden burrito.  The sad part is that the jalepeno cream cheese sauce and chicjen inside still tasted ok,  but the incredibly poor customer service and the way of addressing these concerns was 1) lazy 2) rude and 3) lacked any hospitality.  Although the food was good,  I don't think many understand the impact of customer service,  because although the food was good and ambience ok,  this response has turned us off this place forever."}
{"text":"This place is terrible... We ordered two bean and cheese burritos, seemingly an easy order for a Mexican food place, and what we got we two tortillas with a sprinkle of beans and even less cheese. The little amount of beans that were in the tortillas were under cooked and honestly not that good. The drive thru menu does not light up at night, so it's also hard to see to even place an order, and the employees look almost annoyed that you are there when you pull up. I really wanted to like this place since it's close to our house, but I will never eat here again."}
{"text":"Wow! Food is awesome! Had a little glitch with using the yelp coupon, but they resolved it."}
{"text":"I just bought a brand new home in Queen Creek, right down the street from this dive..... I must have driven by it 20-25 times over the last few months while watching my house be built. Big bright signage on the front windows, nice area, I kept telling myself I needed to try it. BIG MISTAKE!!!  I should have turned around and walked out at the same time I walked in. The 2 mexican ladies that work there were sitting at one of the booths texting. The floor was dirty. They should have been mopping, not texting. The tables are dingy and one of the had been painted over graffiti. No lights in the hallway to the restrooms. Which were stinky and dirty. When I asked the kid behind the counter what kind of fish they used in their fish tacos and he says \"I think it's cod\", that was clue number two to turn & go. But it was 2 pm and I hadn't had lunch yet. So I ordered the 2 fish taco combo...... The fish in the tacos was breaded and about the diameter of a lead pencil, over fried and tasted terrible. This is one mexican place I'll never walk into again! I can't understand why they have been open since 2009."}
{"text":"The green chile chimi is by far my favorite thing here.  The salsa is a work in progress and they are asking for feedback to make it better (which hat tip to them for doing so and listening to their customer)  The drive thru is a little slow, and when I got home I got a Fajita chimi when I ordered a Green Chile one, but I will not slam them for that here - would be stupid since the food is so good, my only suggestion would be to make sure and not turn into a McDonalds where every drive thru order is wrong - maybe double check and go over again with person while in car?  Who knows, but I would suggest giving this place a try .. really good so far based on what I have had."}
{"text":"I was surprised to see this place is being remodeled, nice floors and tables...more light! The food was waaaay better! New manager, she's so sweet and made sure everything was good, and the cook, Norma is awesome!  The salsas I used to hate here they we're watered down and bland,  NOW THEY ARE GOOD!!! and this is coming from one Mexican girl who loves and knows authentic Mexican food!! ;) will be back again!"}
{"text":"this place should be renamed flacos.  I've stopped in a few times for street tacos.   This place started sucking worse and worse.   Portions got smaller each visit.  Im trying to get gordo pronto.  got tired of the place and never returned.    found a place called polibertos on baseline in tempe.  i can get twice the food for the same price as gordos.    i hope the owner sees this and tries polibertos.  adios!"}
{"text":"Food is terrible. Has no taste, came out cold and when sent back it was returned as if they microwaved the entire plate. Will never go back because it was impossible to get hot food."}
{"text":"Just okay. I was craving Mexican good but didn't feel like getting out of car on way home, so I bought the yelp promo! Thank goodness I only paid $5! The carnitas was tough and dry, the red chile meat was the cheapest cut of meat allowable for human consumption. Not all bad though, the rice and beans were good. And the $.99 tostada was good too. IF I go back, it will be for rice, beans and tostada. Afraid to try anything else!"}
{"text":"This place has gone down hill fast. We go here almost weekly. A few Saturday's ago I pulled up and could not get anyone to answer drive thru com. So I pulled forward and could see some guys in there but would not acknowledge me. Finally flagged down a dude who came to window obviously fired up and Said the owners partner or brother just came in and was totally racist to all he workers and yelled at them. \"Everyone is walking out\" . They were all younger Hispanic men. I literally caught them in the middle of all quitting. I calmed the guy down and told him I was sorry for what happened. Not acceptable. He was cool and still filled my order. But I have been back four times and each time the wait and communication has gotten worse. People have been very polite but today they didn't have sausage and the wait was as usual crazy long. The guy taking order was very nice but couldn't take the order without us repeating several times. Bummer. Ticked off the employees were treated poorly. Wish this place would get it together. Cannot recommend right now. Hit and miss and expect a long wait. BTW we only get the sausage breakfast burro."}
{"text":"The main complaint I would give is the time it takes to prepare the food in drive thru.  Just be prepared to wait as long as you would in the store just that you are doing it in your car.  All the food is good and have not had any issues with quality or taste.  Would recommend if you are looking for some good Mexican food."}
{"text":"It was okay in a pinch.  The greeter/server seemed rushed and a little confused by the yelp deal-didn't feel a good customer service vibe.  Food was okay but the beans and salsa were a little too bland for us."}
{"text":"I'm with Moopet not sure why we ate here after reading the reviews but we did.  We got a green chili burrito which was pretty good but not great. Chips were good salsa is very strong oregano flavor which is not to my liking but my wife liked it. I got the fish taco which for $3 a expected more. The fish was a small once frozen fish stick and was topped with cheddar cheese, cabbage, and a chipolte sauce. Possibly the worst fish taco I have had. Beans are peppery pinto beans just like Rubios."}
{"text":"Do not get too excited about the $5 for $10 Yelp coupon.    When you get there and try to pay using this coupon, all of the sudden some things on their menu are not allowed to be purchased using the Yelp deal.  They claim they can get away with this with the wording in the fine print, I looked at the fine print, and disagree.   Always a interesting experience ordering and eating at this place.  Unbelievable."}
{"text":"I had the sausage breakfast burrito and my girlfriend had the bacon breakfast burrito. Both were fantastic! Not dry like most breakfast burritos from the chains. Also pricing was very reasonable. Service was good from start to finish on our order. Two thumbs up. This is a must try for breakfast if you are in the area. I plan to try a lunch/dinner item next. After which, I will update my review to include the latter."}
{"text":"Went here for thr first time today. I ordered the surf and turf burrito and my hub ordered carnitas torta. You can tell the meat wasn't just thrown on the cook top. They marinate their meat and it was very tasty. My husband thought it was the best tasting carnitas ever. and he has had plenty of carnitas in his life. Its usually it's very dry but here is wasn't.  Salsa bar stocked with good salsa and service was good.  Can't wait to go back and try more stuff."}
{"text":"Great food and really good prices! Staff is good most the time and has always got the order right. 3 words: Ava Pollo Fundido. If you like a Jalepeno kick and chicken chimichangas then that's your dish. Carne Asada Quesadilla is the bomb and they give you guac and sour cream FREE here! Nice little joint and nice to support local places."}
{"text":"It's the closest Mexican fast food establishment to us.  I've had some good meals and not so good meals; such as cold tacos....and I always order the same thing.  We mostly order by phone and pick up our order to take home.  Great chips and salsa.  Chips are additional:-(  Great prices."}
{"text":"This place is one of my go to Mexican restaurants. The options are numerous and delicious. They open early so when you're hungover and just need a breakfast burrito they are your savior! The prices are decent for the amount of food one gets. I visit frequently and will continue."}
{"text":"Good food but I have only been there once, but more expensive that I thought it should be.  Very nice people."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the saddest excuse for fish in a fish taco i have ever seen.  Will never be back."}
{"text":"Ate here once and my bean burro literally stunk like fish! Seemed to come from their wrapping paper. Restaurant was dirty but staff was nice. Too bad the food was so awful, and mexican is my fave."}
{"text":"We have been here many time for a quick dinner. The food has always been good and the staff are really friendly. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I'm really upset that I am writing this updated review, but I know I have to do it.  Gordo's has gone downhill, people.    The food here that used to always be stellar for me is now extremely inconsistent. On the occasions I have received gross food, it honestly has been really bad.  Their enchilada sauce used to be spectacular all the time (perfect consistency, brilliant amount of spiciness).  But recently, I was receiving a thin, gross, tasteless sauce every other time I ordered the enchiladas.  The last meal I had here, I ordered a vegetarian burrito, chimi style.  They neglected to include the guacamole with my burrito.  That's my favorite part of the vegetarian burrito!  [Sometimes when I order it chimi style, they plop the guacamole on top after the burrito is fried.  When it wasn't on top, I figured the guac must be inside -- wrong!]  Also -- and this part really disgusted me -- I noticed that my chimi had seven super-duper, fried-beyond-belief French fries stuck to the bottom of it.    My husband used to be a huge fan of Gordo's crunchy tacos.  The last few times he has ordered them, the chicken has not tasted right and the taco shells were very mushy.  I guess we kept giving Gordo's chances since we were big cheerleaders for this place from the get-go and was hoping the bad experiences we had here we just flukes.  Doesn't seem like it anymore.  Also, they recently changed their menu and hiked up their prices.  Not cool.  So long, Gordo's, you've lost your Duke & Duchess of check ins."}
