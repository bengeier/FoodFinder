{"text":"Despite having a huge chalk sign out front saying \"Sunfest, come in and enjoy our patio\" or something along those lines, the patio was closed for unknown reasons.  I thought, ok they probably just closed it.  But as I ate my relatively dry nachos, I watched a handful of groups enter the bar talking about the patio, only to be dissappointed like I was.  You would think that after group after group came in asking about the patio, they would change the sign ? Just maybe.  It was about 30 degrees out and they just seemed to use the sign to draw people in with no concern for the false advertising.  Sloppy management but the food and drinks were decent."}
{"text":"This pub has some character! Reminds me of some of the old \"locals\" in the UK. For example: decor theme = no theme. There are two entrances - one on either side of an entrance to another business, which I initially used to try and enter Swans. Server was friendly and got some pints to us quickly. We took a look at the \"placemat\" style menus, of which, we were promptly informed, were not to be used as such.   Wings were recommended although they came in sixes which seems odd as they were very good! 7 bucks for 6, why not 12 for $13.55. We devoured these quickly, so decided to try some other appie items. Ribs and nachos - should have stayed with the wings. The ribs were slathered in a teriyaki-like sauce, but the meat was charred underneath to the point where it tasted burnt. The nachos were okay, if not a little too plain. We had a couple more pints and left.   All in all, I liked this place! Good spot to stop in for a frosty one after vinyl shopping at Record Land."}
{"text":"I went back to Swans for Monday night trivia, and noticed they have a new menu and new staff. The food is much improved! Shared some pork ribs which were falling off the bone, some artichoke dip, and had a pretty decent (but maybe too much egg or mayo?) chicken schnitzel sandwich.  Really friendly atmosphere. 4 stars for the service and 3 for the food = 3.5. But I'll give them a 4 because I definitely would go back."}
{"text":"The food is not going to amaze you, but it's solid pub fare with an increasingly creative menu.  Atmosphere is welcoming if not slightly dated, but the friendly staff make up for that.  If you want a relaxed meal in an easy-going atmosphere, the Swans will not disappoint."}
{"text":"The perfect bar. Bar vibes, bar food, bar staff. It's seriously the perfect bar. Chill and no frills, and for \"pub\" food, it's great for your prize and yummy. Swans is a inglewood staple"}
{"text":"Wound up spending an entire afternoon here (thanks to snow), and was pretty impressed.  It's a calm, mellow place, one of the few pubs in town I've actually found where I can carry on a conversation and hear myself think. An extra bonus was the fact they were playing swing and blues music - and their selection was so good that the swing DJ I was with was actually asking them for details on where they'd got the music and running songza for almost every song.  The food is decent - nothing brilliant, but good and effective at filling you up (I ordered the quesedilla, and it was a bit skimpy on fillings, but ok).   The staff are really relaxed and calm about you moving about the place (from table to pool  table to another seating area) and all ordering at different times. I really appreciated that the waitress wasn't fussed about us paying up immediately - she knew we were sticking around for the evening and didn't hassle us at all, but checked in occasionally to see if we needed anything else.  The fact that they let us host a blues dance every month here is also a huge bonus (and the reason I was there). A bar that's happy to give over a full section to a bunch of people enthusiastically flailing their arms around without charging us cover fees to do so? Major plus in my books.   All in all, it's a great place to relax with friends and while away a lazy, snowy weekend day - and an amazing place to go and blues dance if you enjoy that too (second Sunday of every month)!"}
{"text":"Swans of Inglewood tries to be the new hip restaurant, but is only decent at best. The food is too saucy like the fried chicken sandwich for example, and for my first time going there, they mess up my order within the first 10 minutes. Also if you're calling the restaurant be sure to only call once and if they don't pick up wait about 5 minutes then try again. Trust me, they were pretty clear about that"}
{"text":"Local flavor, very reminiscent of a proper British pub. Great service for the regulars and good food and variety.   Good quiet atmosphere and service. Lots of nooks and crannies for quiet talks and darts and pool for the social animals. The staff always takes care of us and make sure that we have the drinks and food that we need."}
{"text":"The service was okay, only one person serving and bartending. The pub food was not good and the food was served luke warm, The interior needs a complete overhaul. Menus were paper and filthy."}
{"text":"Randomly ended up at this place. A friend and I wanted to go for a pint close to his place and he wanted to throw some darts. So we popped in here and it's such a cool place!  There is one pool table, and a couple dart boards, plus tons of seating. It wasn't busy, so we found a nice little spot. It was great that you were able to hang out and have a conversation and not have to yell at someone. Met Johnny, who I'm pretty sure as running the whole place that nice. Very nice gent and took good care of us.   Crowd was a bit older, so less drama that most places. Great place for a drink or just to chill."}
{"text":"Swans is not my cup of tea.  The patrons are kind of depressing.  Strange vibe there.  Friendly staff, though."}
{"text":"Stopped for a beer mid afternoon on a Saturday. Very lively crowd, from very rough locals to families with kids.  Not sure how kids are allowed in there.  Bar itself is dark, seating is random. Beer was good, service was good.  Not my kinda place, but it was ok."}
{"text":"I've always enjoyed going to Swans Pub in Inglewood.  I like the food and I especially like the atmosphere-it's casual and friendly and laid back so it feels like you're hanging out with your friends.  Well now they have something new to keep me coming back- Caprices ART Evenings.  What a lot of FUN!  I went to their first one in April and it was a blast!  It was a fun group of people and the painting we created was really cool-a piece I really liked and put on my wall.  Swans also had food and drink specials. It was such an enjoyable way to spend an evening and I will be going back next month for the next one.  The art evenings are going to be the last Thursday of the month so be sure to check it out!"}
{"text":"Jackie was amazing and very hospitable. Felt like I was at a friends house for amazing food rather than a pub! Everything tasted home cooked and delicious! Cozy is an understatement such a wonderful experience! Thank you for a really nice night in the cold weather! Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"We seem to keep finding ourselves here after a summer day of walking in Inglewood. A welcome respite from the sun and crowded spaces. Excellent service and a general good vibe. Oh yeah yummy craft beer on tap and a board game today while looking out on to 9 ave."}
{"text":"One of my favorite pubs in the city. Strange layout with different areas to sit that works perfectly to accommodate a small quiet meal and a pint or a raucus group.   Beer is selection is good and the food is excellent, it's a mix between classic pub fare and unique specialties. Get the kimchi spring rolls and fried chick peas to start! Food takes a bit longer but they make everything from scratch in house. It's worth the wait.  Staff is very very friendly.   My only real complaint is that you have to go to the bar to pay with card, that always irks me.   It's not the perfect pub and I'd rate it a 4.5/5 if that was an option but because it's not I'll round up because it's as damn close to perfect as I've found in Calgary.  Ask to play Naglin!"}
{"text":"One night we decided to check out the local watering hole at Swans of Inglewood Restaurant & Public House.  Swans has an exterior that hides the standard bar interior with a nice cozy feeling but has a surprisingly large space.  The waitress there was in good spirits, we were greeted, sat and menued promptly and even had coasters flung at us like miniature frisbees.  Getting seated was a blessing because in 10 minutes flat the bar soon filled up.  Our drink orders had already been taken but it took around 20 minutes for them to get to our table and that was when we realised that she was the only waitress on staff and not only that, she was also tending the bar!  Thankfully we were engrossed with funny work stories that we didn't even notice that our drinks were empty and food was served about 30 minutes later.  I think compassion kicks in when you realise that a person is working alone.  \"I haven't had a rush like that in 2 years\"... she exclaimed.    Anywho the BBQ chicken burgers were scrumptious and so was the shepherd's pie, drink prices are reasonable and many beer selections can be found on tap.   Considering the huge rush and the possibility of a huge disaster the waitress had everything under control and was extremely pleasant, kudos to her and to Swans."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible experience. Do not go in with high expectations or high standards you will be very dissatisfied.  Service is just a light suggestion. Cleanliness is horrible,  bathroom was disgusting. Atmosphere is extremely out of date.  The get orders wrong and they don't even have portable debit card machines. Line up to pay. To put the cherry on top of my experience they didn't even know my table or order. Extremely unprofessional staff. Food was eatable but definitely poor quality for a pub. This is not an English Pub. It's a dive bar! Wasn't impressed!"}
{"text":"My sister and I were in the area and decided to pop in for drinks before dinner. The layout here was strange - a lot of open, empty space that could have been filled with tables - and the actual tables shoved into corners. A little bit weird and awkward. We sat down and waited over 10 minutes without a server in sight. My sister actually walked up to the bar to grab us drinks, but came back immediately. The bar area is dark, dingy, and a little sketchy. The vibe back there was just...weird. She didn't feel quite comfortable so we opted to wait, and a few minutes later our waitress came by. Seemed as if she was the only one in the entire place!  We ordered a couple of drinks and they came out quickly. We also noticed that the table next to us ordered food and it looked and smelled amazing! Once we were finished (we were in a rush), she brought us our bill and lo and behold, they don't take debit! We instead paid with credit. While we were standing at the bar to pay, there were a couple of young guys obviously quite intoxicated harassing us. It was really uncomfortable. While our server was processing our payment, my sister commented on how good the food looked and she explained that they made everything from scratch in house, so it takes a bit longer. Something to think about.  I might be back if I'm in the area, but only if I'm not in a rush (and I'll avoid the back bar area)."}
{"text":"I've been to Swans a few times during the day and tonight I ventured over to check out the entertainment.  The service was my only issue, but it's a big one.  Service was slower than slow for both beverages and food.  We ordered messy ribs and wings and were not brought napkins.  The server said she'd bring some over, but within five minutes we went hunting for them ourselves because we all were a mess.    It's just an unfortunate situation because I like the small town feel of the pub but it's not worth going to when you are always disappointed with the service.  Swans needs more staff."}
{"text":"Ended up here while shopping in Inglewood and nipped in for a quiet beer in the afternoon.  Must say I was impressed. The layout is unconventional for Calgary pubs, being a mix of nooks and crannies- probably because the pub seems to cover what was previously three shops- and would probably be considered a bit dark and dingy by many, but it's the nearest thing I've seen to a real British or Irish pub in Calgary. It reminds me of pubs in London and other cities I've been in that have a similar layout.  We only stopped for drinks, so can't comment on the food, but there's a decent selection of local beers, and the staff and regulars were so friendly that we felt like long-lost friends after a couple.  I'd recommend this place to anyone looking for a quiet pint somewhere with a friendly atmosphere and different from the regular bars staffed by young women in short skirts and knee-high boots. Possibly one for a slightly older customer who isn't looking to go clubbing later.  There is wheelchair access, and the washroom is wheelchair-friendly. The passage through the bar wasn't obstructed by tables and chairs for the most part, but it may be a little difficult to access certain seating areas."}
{"text":"My Boyfriend & me just ate the fish and chips and it was the best I've ever had. Service was fantastic, I was to busy eating that I never caught the name of our server. I know she's been working there a long time and it shows. I'd recommend going to swans to anyone. I know I'll be back"}
{"text":"A dingy public house in Inglewood with no real drink specials and no mention of food specials during \"happy hour\".    Considering this place is not underground, it is surprisingly dark and unwelcoming.     The service matches the decor.   The service was not overly friendly or helpful.    We ordered a few small plates of pizza spring rolls, wings, onion rings, roasted chickpeas, and deviled eggs.     The food took an extremely long amount of time.  Our server said the chef was backed up, however there was no more than 10 people inside the place, and almost all of them arrived after us.   Our server apologized, so we waited.  Finally the food came, and it was just okay.  The wings were standard, and the food wasn't anything spectacular.     When we finally finished and went to pay, we were sent up to the bar.  The bartender was seemingly \"busy\" with no one... so much so that she couldn't even set up the debit machine properly for us, we had to enter in our own amounts.     Not going there again unfortunately."}
{"text":"the perfect place for an afternoon pint! stopped in around noon on Saturday for a pint, but as soon as the waitress mentioned 'spicy caesar' i got one of those instead - Martie makes a killer one!  my sister & I shared some little snack type things - bacon wrapped dates, pulled pork slider, deep fried Shepards pie balls - and while none of it was mind blowingly awesome, it was all still good, and together with the setting, the service, and the caesar, it was a pretty great experience!"}
