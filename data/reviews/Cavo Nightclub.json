{"text":"I just moved back here and went to Cavo as part of a bachelorette party and had an AMAZING time!  We did have the luxury of a VIP section which was worth the money! It was so much fun to get dressed up and go out!  Classy place!"}
{"text":"Despite the two bad reviews already posted on yelp, I ventured down to Cavo last weekend for a friends birthday anyway.  I had a great time, the place was beautifully decorated, the service was friendly, and music was good.  Me and my friends had reserved a bottle service section and because of our reservation we didn't have to pay the cover or wait in line, we were promptly escorted in and to our table. Our waitress also brought some complimentary appetizers, which I thought was a nice extra touch. The crowd was older, probably 25-35,everyone was nicely dressed and well behaved. I would definetly go back!"}
{"text":"We are not your typical Cavo crowd. We are a bit older and much more conservative in our perspective. We went to Cavo because Kaya was booked. We are so glad to have done that. We had a marvelous meal that was perfectly prepared by the chef. The fillet was just as ordered with a lovely crust and the scallops were perfectly grilled. The potatoes and risotto that accompanied the main courses were just what you would hope for. It is a very interesting Decor. Not at all what you would expect in Pittsburgh. That made it all the more interesting. We will go again and yes it is okay for the over 50 crowd."}
{"text":"What a great experience.....first time I have ever been to a night club in the strip (I know crazy).  My girlfriend and I had an awesome time.  We loved the atmosphere and the fact that it had two different themed bars (salsa and house music) was a plus.  Will definitely come back"}
{"text":"The service is good, the drinks are responsibly priced and I always have a good time. The crowd and atmosphere is a nice change from the south side...and lastly I looooove DJ Nugget!"}
{"text":"Best club in da burgh.  Music is right.  Nice crowd with a semi strict dress code.  a good nite out if you looking to party or just like their dance music.  People actually dance and the seating area is hip."}
{"text":"CAVO is such an amazing place! It's a great restuarant in the day and evening and once it hits about 10:30-11:00 it turns into a great party nightclub atmosphere! First off, we reserved a table at 7:00 pm for my sister's 30th birthday party. When I first walked in I was amazed!! The atmosphere is so cool! The decor is gothic chic! So gorgeous inside! The service is incredible!!!!!! The one bartender Mike felt like family by the end of the night! He was great!! Our waitress Ciara was awesome as well, so sweet and attentive! The manager brought over champagne on the house with a huge sparkler for my sister's birthday ! I want to have all celebrations here and come here more in general! I will definitely continue to go to CAVO and suggest anyone who wants a fun time to head down to CAVO in the Strip District!!"}
{"text":"5 stars isn't enough. Exclusive. So exclusive.  My bro danced all night! He was dancing so hard it was unbelievable! I've never seen him dance like that! He just kept going and going and going. It was a surreal experience."}
{"text":"Love this place on Fridays when they have salsa nights and no cover. Never ate so can't comment in their kitchen but the drinks are fairly priced and service is prompt. The bottle service is worth it as well and the servers are really nice and courteous. The crowd is a mix but could be skewed towards a bunch of stags who are looking for something to grind upon and not dance. Doesn't bother me as long as the music is good and there is some space to move my arms and legs around. The DJs are pretty legit and play a mix of hip-hop, pop, and some 90s classics remixed. Good beats."}
{"text":"I came here for the Halloween party last week. Although I'm not generally a fan of nightclubs, I had a good time here with my friends. I appreciate the effort they put in to decorate the place for the occasion. They hung \"body bags\" from the ceiling, and they had a creepy actor in a nightgown sitting in a bed in one of the rooms who tried to scare people. Minus stars, though, for the 2 scantily-clad women dancing on stage in one of the back rooms..so unnecessary.  Cavo was packed to the brim! It was a little annoying to keep getting bumped into because there were so many people, but on the bright side, it was great to see all of the creative costumes people came up with.   I wouldn't go out of my way to come back here, but they did throw a pretty sweet Halloween party!"}
{"text":"Requested bottle service. One of our party was stabbed in the leg by a nail sticking 3 inches out of the seats in the area we were assigned. The GM Cody Rasnecough (?unsure of spelling). Was extremely rude and unapologetic. Terrible experience."}
{"text":"Spent one night in Pittsburgh and chose Cavo. No regrets, great music, average priced drinks, great time. Tons of people and no kids. Bartenders were friendly and fast. Recommend!!!"}
{"text":"I've been to Cavo twice.  Once, I stopped here with a friend on a night out.  We were actually going to Kava and the bouncer literally recruited us from the street to stop in. This made sense, because there were less than a dozen people in the ENTIRE place (a.k.a, all of the rooms, dance floors, and restaurant) at 10 on a Saturday. Needless to say, we promptly left. I just went back this weekend with a Groupon to their restaurant.  So, I do have to speak highly of the decor and vibe: it's a trendy yet sophisticated place that would seem very pleasant to spend a night at.  There were only 4 other people at the restaurant when we came in for dinner (does this place just not get any patrons before midnight?).  The menu actually looked pretty tasty, yet overpriced- which is what I expected. My counterpart had the burger, which was huge and he said it was tasty. However, there were only 2 vegetarian options other than salads, which is what I've come to expect from fine dining.  I ordered the veggie pasta- which actually wasn't pasta (?)- just shreds of zucchini completely soaked in olive oil.  I could make this dish orders of magnitude less greasy for a fraction of the $16 it cost.  On the other hand, the homemade flourless chocolate cake and ice cream were scrumptious.  Overall, it was a nice night out, but I was really disappointed with my dish- and because there were very few vegetarian options, I will probably not come back for a meal."}
{"text":"If your looking for the entire pleasure package Cavo is your place! Where can you go for an amazing dinner then enjoy drinks in the lounge and later head to the Dance floor? VIP is always sold out so the place always has a great crowd! If you want the full experience VIP is where it's at ESP if your are celebrating anything. You get a bottle and mixers that are being refilled throughout the night, the service is great! The staff is on point! The bathrooms are clean, service is prompt, staff is friendly and the atmosphere is perfect. This place really does what it takes to make their customers happy and that's why that's my first choice when I head out. I love how there is such a variety that suites all the different needs and expectations of people when they head out on the weekends. If you want to get drinks quick, good service, friendly staff, and dance your ass off to one of the best DJ's plan to spend your weekends here!"}
{"text":"Cavo in Pittsburgh's strip district is a refreshing night club unlike any other I have ever seen there.  The owner is from Los Angeles and she brought that L.A. club vibe to her place. The crowd is always good-looking.  The establishment is sophisticated with a touch of upscale goth.  There is a lot of detail in the decor.   They also serve food which is excellent.   It's not just a dance club.  They also have unique events going on from time to time, like burlesque shows (tastefully done) and drag queen shows. Outside individuals & establishments also use this venue for fundraisers as it's in a convenient location and is a fairly large space with 2 separate areas.    One side has the dancefloor a bar and is high energy.  The other side has a bar and tables and is more low-key & a little quieter where you can sit and have conversation & just chill out with a drink.  It seems like the crowd runs from ages 20s to 40s"}
{"text":"It's a very nice venue, probably one of the nicest clubs in the Pittsburgh area. There are several alcohol counters scattered throughout with a dance floor towards the back. The dance floor was a bit too cramped to accommodate the amount of people in the club. The staff is friendly and accommodating. The bathrooms are pretty clean, but kind of small. The music was great with a good assortment of oldies and top hits. The crowd reminded me of a dysfunctional wedding party with a good mix of cousin Joe, aunt Mae, uncle Ben, and grandpa George--there's someone for everyone!   Though, Cavo is far from perfection. The drink prices were not too bad, average $5-$8 per drink, but there was literally one drop of alcohol per drink. They also did not clean their cups very well because my cup smelled like cockroach poop. The food was mediocre and not even worth mentioning. What's up with the vintage porn playing on the projectors and the lesbian art all along the walls? As a venue, I never want to be in this place sober, but as a club it's not too shabby."}
{"text":"Alright night club, still enjoyed it because I'm fun, but my other friends didn't.  We got bottle service and requested for a table near the dance floor, but for some reason we was put ALLLL the way in the back. So I'm pretty sure they sold our table?   We got all of our drinks, our soda was flat and warm. And we requested for new ones twice, but we gave up because it wasn't happening."}
{"text":"Can we give bonus stars?? The (in)famous Cavo! This is exactly what a nightclub should be. I've traveled the world and partied in some of the best clubs and Cavo definitely ranks in my top 5! Every time I visit my hometown, Steeler Nation, I hit up my homie Lito and head to Cavo... hands-down the best club in the tri-state region"}
{"text":"Not much info on their website. Seating was less than desirable. Show was not what I expected. Venue was ok. Overall a pricey disappointment."}
{"text":"I've traveled around to most major cities and experienced the best nightclubs around! Cavo delivers quality service and an amazing atmosphere. Definitely in my top 5 places to celebrate. A Pittsburgh nightlife gem!"}
{"text":"Came here on Friday night with my girlfriend for dinner. I heard it was a great place to come party. On Friday I found out it's also a great place to eat. We had wine and some cocktails and really enjoyed ourselves. We had the mahi, the bruschetta, and the cheese plate. They were good but what I liked most about the place was the decor and the service. It's dark and romantic and our server was very friendly and helpful with the menu. Definitely plan to go back here."}
{"text":"Ultra cool and overly pretentious.  There may be some who think Cavo is fun or exciting, but it left me quite cold.  The music lacks variety.  The dance floor is small.  This place tries too hard and in the process, loses me entirely."}
{"text":"I could care less what anyone says.  I love this place.  So many people give me crap about going here or suggesting it...calling me part of the \"Cavo\" crowd.  To thee I say, \" so what mofo.\"  The place is perfect for what it is. A bougie beautiful looking interior reminiscent of what clubs in NYC looked (and still look like) with an awesome blend of music everything from EDM, to Top 40, to my favorite part of the night, 90's hip hop and R&B.  The crowd is hype, the music is great, and the overall vibe is deliciously fun.   I came here for NYE for the first time after four years in PGH last this past January and it was a blast.   I used to frequent the salsa nights on Fridays where cover was free and the music hit home but no so much now.  Either way, Cavo doesn't pretend to be anything it isn't. It's loud, it's obnoxious, it's got its select crowd, but every city needs one. Not everything has to be hipster, not everything has to be a hole in the wall, not everyone in Pittsburgh drinks F*&%n craft beer!   Sometimes you want to dress slick, grab a vodka soda, walk through a place that looks like a scene from \"Eyes Wide Shut\" (for all the millennials, I don't expect you to know this, it just shows how much about royalty you don't know), get your groove on, and go crazy.  Cavo is just that.  I won't miss a lot of things when I leave Pittsburgh, but I will miss a lot of the nights I have had here.  True story.  Kudos."}
{"text":"Browsing through Groupon Local Restaurants and I see Cavo. I was confused. I thought Cavo was just a nightclub, but after reading some awesome reviews on yelp, I knew I had to check it out. We visited this past Saturday around 7:00pm. I was surprised to see that we were the first ones in the place. I've been to Cavo before, and was reminded of the beautiful décor and relaxing ambiance as we were seated. Our waiter was really friendly and provided us with excellent service throughout the evening. The menu is small- only two pages, and I was a little disappointed in their selection of appetizers. I decided to go for the grilled filet mignon with mashed potatoes and asparagus. My boyfriend ordered the burger. Our entrees came out in good time and were stunning. The lighting is very dim in this place, so it was hard to take a good picture (yes, I am one of those people). My steak was cooked perfectly, the mashed potatoes were super tasty and the asparagus was delicious. The boyf's burger was AWESOME- there was a TON of bacon, which I loved (I snuck a couple bites in) and it was cooked wonderfully. The chips were SO good. They were long like French fries and tasted super fresh. Delicious!  Overall, we were surprised with how impressed we were with this place. I have to admit I was skeptical about the food, but they sure did prove me wrong. I plan on returning!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a gay bar on Yelp and this was the first night club that came up. Unfortunately it's only a gay bar on Sundays and I went on a Saturday. I still had a great time though and the bartenders were friendly plus the DJ was great! I would go back for sure. Plenty of parking was available as well and at no cost!"}
{"text":"I am not one for nightclubs, but I went here for the first time last night and had a good time! They had two spaces for dancing -  one in the front where people were dancing to Latin music like merengue and salsa, and one in the back where it was just a big, packed dance floor. In the middle there is a bar area and the bathrooms. I enjoyed dancing and thought the music was good! There was no cover charge which is a big plus. There were a few negatives, though: 1. It was SUPER hot in the front room. 2. The drinks were expensive. 3. There is no space to sit down anywhere unless you want to pay for bottle service.  Seems like the dress code is pretty strict. A couple of bros in line ahead of us were turned away because they were wearing tennis shoes and shorts."}
{"text":"Such a great time Friday night. No cover. Good staff and lovely go-go dancers. Good mix of ages. Very reasonable drink prices too. I'll be back tonight!"}
{"text":"First time at Cavo and had a blast.    My friends were in the VIP section which made it nice.  Our server was great.   She made sure our mixers were stocked, ice was available and removed any dirty glasses.  The staff was awesome.    We were seated in the area where there is a dancer in the cage.  I was introduced to the \"Green Tea\" drink - which tasted like green tea (great drink after the various drinks I consumed.  I recommend but call ahead.    They have themes.  It is best to go with a group of friends."}
{"text":"I never was able to experience it here due to the fact that the bouncers not accepting my id. I turned 21 2 days ago and they are convinced my id is fake. I have high hopes for such a bar but the fact that they won't accept my id is embarrassing. I truly wish there was an officer outside who could prove to them that I am 21. It is not right and completely unfair. I hope the best to this bar but I will not return until I have an officer with me telling them otherwise. At that point I hope my opinion changes    I came back about 3 weeks post the incident. This club has a beautiful interior. Great staff. Very apologetic. Caters to anyone. Must say my opinion has changed. Great service"}
{"text":"This place is off the chain!! My friends and I danced all night cause the music was awesome!!   Everyone is so friendly & professional! Going back for another  crazy fun night next weekend!!  this is my favorite spot... Love Cavo!!!"}
{"text":"Pittsburgh isn't a nightclub town. When it comes to the nightclub scene here, there are WAY more failures than success stories. Somehow though, Cavo beats the odds.   Cavo continues to be a place that my friends and I know we can go to and have a great time, receive exceptional service, and leave with stories to tell.   The owners of Cavo take a lot of pride in making sure that every detail is perfect... from the food, to the drinks, to the service, to the atmosphere... my favorite detail being the incredible lighting. Additionally, I love the three different areas. It allows you to really customize the experience you want to have.   Can't wait for another crazy night at Cavo... Is it Friday yet???"}
{"text":"Popped in here for a quick happy hour on a Friday. We ordered a Dirty Martini first and would say that it was so-so at best. Im a fan of blue cheese olives but they didnt have any for us. After the martini we switched over to wine and I was very happy and surprised how good their house pinot noir was compared to the martini. Before we left my fiance and I enjoyed a couple apps. They were fantastic.... The only thing keeping me from a 5 star was the slow service and absense of blue cheese olives.."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good, if not a bit high-end. Came here twice on a Groupon and was very satisfied both times. The place isn't too crowded in the early evening--there were people at the bar, while the club area was still empty. The music was pretty good for the club atmosphere, though the vintage films playing on the wall were weird. The waiter was super friendly and attentive, and he sold the specials really well. The grilled filet was perfect--a thick piece of tender beef, garnished with asparagus, mushrooms, and roasted potato wedges. The seafood market had a couple options, and we went with the salmon salad. Greens and vegetables were super fresh, the house vinaigrette was flavorful, and the salmon filet was a good portion of grilled tasty fish. Just take note that it seems that the menu on their site is outdated."}
{"text":"Went on a Friday night.  Got there earlyish, around 10 and it was dead.  Got settled in to our table/vip.  It was packed by about 11-1130.  The girls were very attentive!  I loved the dancers on the platforms in the wall.  Overall, we had a great time and would go back."}
{"text":"People complain that it's a wannabe Las Vegas atmosphere, but that's what makes it fun! One of my favorite places to go."}
{"text":"JERRY (bartender) IS AWESOME!  Real talk, this night club is not for the faint hearted. Be ready to partay!  There's a dance floor, plenty of bar space for ordering, VIP, and a bathroom attendant. Oh, and a $5 on weekends."}
{"text":"Actually had dinner at the club... accidentally.   Friday night trying to find a spot in the strip to eat after facing my crushed dreams of eating at Gaucho and it only taking 20 minutes to get through the line. I decided to go to Kaya. when my friends and I walk in Kaya we wont be seated for another 1.5 hours- we say no to reservations and walk out. upon walking out we decide to spontaneously try the first spot we see which is CAVO.   We walk in and there is no greeting or waiter to seat us. Just a bar maybe 15-20 people drinking at the bar, a couple lounge tables near the bar- the inside was huge it seemed like a club venue, but it was only 730- no club is really in operation at 730- so after we were interrogated/questioned by a Butch lady who was convinced we showed up for her birthday and felt the right to ask each of us what our current relationship status was... we thought it was a private party.  No one has kicked us out yet and we were all really hungry, so we decided to venture deeper into the building where we saw it open up into a second, event larger room with 2 bars. This is where we caught the waiter, who apologized and took us back to where the bar was to seat us.   So finally we get the menu, not too many items to choose from, but i got fish tacos and a steak salad! After about 15 minutes and a couple refills  the waiter brought us our food... AND  IT WAS INCREDIBLE. The salad was absolutely mouth watering with an array of cheese nuts berries accompanying the steak and lettuce- it knocked my socks off. I wish I had gotten more tacos because they were beautiful and insanely delicious.   The club was clean, service was good once found, to eat it is definitely lively and loud, looked like a fun place to hang out for the night as well.   I will have to come back!!"}
{"text":"Honestly the premiere nightlife spot in all of Pittsburgh.  Friendly staff and a great venue.  If you are looking for the best spot for a Saturday night in Pgh then this is for you."}
{"text":"The best nightclub in Pittsburgh! I am not a fan of night clubs but I love to dance and have a good time. SouthSide is overrated, so this place is great. The ages vary, so it is not all young college students. The decor os fabulous and the music is great. Not too hard to grab a drink at the bar and usually not too crowded to where you cannot move. The dancers in the wall are awesome as well!"}
{"text":"I anticipated coming here and seeing Cavo with a four or five star rating. I can't believe it only has two! Maybe it's because I've only been here for events, but I think Cavo is awesome!  I've been here three times to their \"Vain\" events. It's usually three local drag performers and a headliner from Rupaul's Drag Race. The place itself is beautiful on the inside. There is a lounge area, a restaurant area and the main dance floor that's stands next to the amazing waterfall wall. There's also a second floor that overlooks the dance floor and has a separate bar. It's hard to describe the theme of the place but I would describe it as new age gothic. Once you go, you'll get what I mean.   The bartenders and staff have always been nothing but nice to me. Drinks are good, but can be quite expensive. I spent almost $20 on two long islands (including a tip). They also are a little stingy with the alcohol. I've never gone here and really \"got messed up.\" Maybe it's because I'm too busy enjoying the show?   I will definitely be back here for more \"Vain\" events. As far as coming on a random Saturday night, I'm not sure. From other reviews it seems the crowds are mighty different."}
{"text":"Giving this place one star was extremely generous of me.  Was excited to go here for salsa night with some friends but that quickly soured the second we drove past this place. First - no valet, or at least no sign of valet despite what their website says.  Second - we had to stand outside in the 20 degree temperature for about 10 minutes waiting for the bouncer to find some frat boys ID.  That should have been our cue to run as far away from this place as possible. Turns out, this \"classy establishment\" was catering a party for some frat. As we stood there, 3 overly served, drunker than drunk frat boys pushed and shoved myself and my friends out of their way. One even continued to hit his girlfriend and when I told the bouncer that if he let these kids back in, they were going to lose four paying patrons who actually work for their money.  What did the bouncer do? His response was that \"they were with a party\" and he let all of them back in - despite knowing full well that they were over-served and were already being violent with patrons.  Thankfully the frat idiots never ventured over to the salsa area but the stragglers who did stay in the other room could barely stand up, some were passed out and the room reeked of vomit.  And if there is a dress code for this place, you wouldn't have known it based on the hooker-like attire the girls were wearing.   Needless to say we'll never come back to this place - if we wanted that kind of night we would have just gone to the South Side."}
{"text":"We had a Groupon here for dinner.  Waiter was super cute. Food was a little slow to come out especially since we were the only ones there. Food was good though. Chicken with cornbread, potatoes were a little cold. Husband had flatbread and salad with no complaints.  He said he would have eaten the salad dressing with a spoon and a bowl."}
{"text":"I haven't been clubbing in years (yes, years) and not gonna lie, I actually had fun. We got here at 9:45pm, an ungodly hour for clubbing etiquette, but perfect for us. There was a $5 cover, which I thought was lame but I get it. Sometimes you need a cover to \"cover\" expenses. All the seating areas were reserved but the security guy was nice and let us throw our stuff on one. Typical nightclub and groups of people all had different styles. The huz and I took over the dance floor at 10pm because the DJ was killing it with reggae that took us back to the late 90s. That was my favorite part. An hour later, the club was packed, the music sucked, people were spilling drinks and it reminded me why I hate clubs. My beer soaked jeans and disdain for house music got the best of me and I decided it was time to go a little before midnight.   I like that they try to be pretentious. The decor was pin-up shiek with tuft, velvet couches and ornate, dark frames. There were dancers elevated behind the DJ area and an upstairs we never got around to exploring."}
{"text":"Want some diversity in a city that generally lacks it ,outside of its student population? Cavo is your go to. Pretty much the only joint in Pittsburgh that can boast good food, good salsa/bachata music AND a good Dj in the non-salsa portion.   It's actually incredible. Not sure if they have a house DJ but the guy who was there on Friday the 26th of August slayed track after track really mixing REAL music whilst keeping the pop-junkies satisfied with the garbage you always hear. Having the ability to choose Salsa/bachata and clubaduba is kinda cool. I found myself going back and forth based on what I was feeling. I will return. CAVO FTW."}
{"text":"Pittsburgh doesn't have much of a night life scene anymore. It's either Cavo or like three spots on Carson that have a dance floor. Cavo sets themselves a part with a decent sized dance floor,  reasonably priced drinks and a decor that's to die for. I love how dedicated Cavo is to its theme from the art on the walls to the go girls dancing in the window above the dance floor. I've been here a few times and can never say I had a terrible time. I can see why they are still in business. They have a great mix of old and new music on the dance floor and in the front room they play lots of Latin music. I would most definitely recommend this gem to anyone looking for a great night on the town in Pittsburgh. Sometimes it does tend to get too crowded but there's not that many dance options in the Burgh so I guess they should take that as a compliment."}
{"text":"Aside from being a hopping nightclub scene in a town where there are more failures than successes, Cavo is almost like a little known secret with the food. The menu is inventive, the food itself is amazing, and the staff is incredibly friendly. The bartender seemed to know what was going on and was very attentive for more drinks. The ambience alone is enough to draw someone in and make them want to dance all night."}
{"text":"This club was really nice inside, 3 different bars and a lot of seating and a nice dance floor.  The only thing I didn't care for the music it was all techno music."}
{"text":"Came here for some drinks and dancing.  The music was fantastic and the drinks were strong.  Thoroughly enjoyed the atmosphere as well.  Fun club for sure.  I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This review is for all 30 something year old women who would rather be at home on the couch with their four legged friends ;)  Also, for those who routinely reference The Matrix as their favorite dancing spot....   Nothing will ever beat the Matrix. Sorry.  I haven't been dancing (or to a club in general) in a loooooong time and was hesitant to RSVP Yes to a girlfriends bachelorette party here. I quickly ran to Express to find something half decent to wear.... if any of you have seen pics on FB then you're familiar with all of the half naked regulars at this place...   We arrived around 930-10pm and thankfully had a VIP table reserved. The cocktail servers brought us an assortment of alcohol and mixers. Bottle service comes with real life SPARKLERS attached to them. This was huge because I LOVE sparklers. Anyway.  They refilled everything promptly, so the service was fine.  We had a bouncer stationed in front of the two conjoining VIP areas. This was nice because he used his flashlight to help us find things :) And he helped to clean up a champagne glass that *someone* broke (me).   We danced our little faces off. But typically not outside of the confines of a 5 foot radius outside of our area. Music was great. The dance floor got increasingly packed as the night went on. It was very hard to even move. By midnight we were dancing in our little VIP area because there was more room! (Picture 2 love seats a small table and 10 girls).   Bathrooms were decent. The attendant was nice.  Oh and as I was navigating through the crowd.... I got head butted. But I mean, it was an accident, she must've really felt the groove.   I'd probably only ever go back here for a specific event or to check out the other sides of the club (no dance floor, more low key but still fancy looking, hear they serve decent food).   If you go, get there early, reserve VIP if possible (not sure how much it is, we each pitched $40 bucks), and who cares what you wear... some may be in LBD's and suits... but I saw a handful of girls in riding boots and jeans!   Really missing the 80s room..."}
{"text":"May be one of the top clubs in Pittsburgh...  Came here on Halloween 2014. The place was packed needless to say. There was a long line we had to wait in (about an hour) to even obtain entry. Bottle service was sold out, so we couldn't participate in that to avoid waiting.  The inside of the club is kind of incredible. A huge chandelier hangs above the main dance floor. The decor is very modern with industrial touches. The drinks my friend and I had, were very expensive, but very strong :-)  My only issue is the bodyguard situation... I understand you have friends that you want to let in with their friends, BUT there were people jumping the ropes when your backs were turned to the people actually waiting in line. I could have jumped the rope,  and I honestly could have several times. Let's be honest... This isn't Miami, NYC, LA, or Vegas. There's no need for that kind of line situation. This is why I've deducted 2 stars.   All in all, Cavo is fun. Next time, I may opt for bottle service with friends to avoid that whole line situation."}
{"text":"I don't even know what to say about this place! Everything was excellent! Food and service was outstanding. After dinner we stayed to dance the night away.   Not to mention the decor of the establishment is gorgeous. Our server told us the owner does most of the work herself, even the table tops. IMPRESSIVE! More power to the female owner! Yeah, girl power!  If you are wondering where the \"beautiful people\" in Pittsburgh come to rub elbows, it is here! Will definitely be returning when I visit the city again."}
{"text":"I'm only rating this for my one time experience, but it was actually a great time.  I guess, how else would you rate a club?  We had a table, and the servers gave good service as they were attentive to fill up the ice bucket and replace glasses etc.  We had the table closest to the door in the beginning of the night (by the piano).  Although it was a good space and place for the table (if you want it to be less crowded), my friends and I wanted to be closer to the dance floor.  We asked the server to move us and once a table was open, they moved us to the very front. It was a fabulous time!  Felt very VIP.  That table has a lot of comfy lounge space and felt private even if it was closer to the dj and dance floor because it was a little elevated.    I like the decor of the place.  They had a python at the time, too, and the owner/trainer of the snake would let you pose and take pics with it.  I thought it was cool.  The bathrooms would be what's expected of a club bathroom experience.  The dj played great dance/club music, so if you're looking for that kind of scene, I would recommend this place.  My out-of-town friends from major cities were pretty impressed."}
{"text":"Lots of people seem to love it here. It's ok. I feel like a lot of folks here think they're better than everyone else. It's a super cool club and the decor is amazing. Honestly the best times I've had were for drag events and shows. That's when the crowd is cool and people aren't jerky."}
{"text":"Had a blast! My girlfriend and I went for the first time last night, and this is by far the best club I've been to. The whole staff was great! The music and dj were awesome. The crowd was anywhere from 21-50. I'm 49 and did not feel old! Inside it's like an upscale NYC club. The water fountain wall and go go dancers were a nice touch. We had a table on the 2nd floor overlooking the dance floor. If you go, get there a little early. The place is packed by 11:30. The next time I'm in Pittsburgh, I'll definitely be back."}
