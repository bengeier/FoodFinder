{"text":"I did not expect to like the place but I was quite surprised when I visited for a friend's event.   The service was very efficient and energetic (except maybe the reception at the door which was a snooty and over the top, just ignore and have a good time - that was my reaction). Advice was volunteered by the waiting staff and very rich. The person who took care of us did his best to make everyone feel comfortable and succeeded. He certainly gave this restaurant a better image.   The food was rich. Perhaps a little uneven however. The tartare was delicious and the squid was a little salty. I didn't have a main course but the wine selection was good and there are reasonably priced choices.   The ambiance is loud and happy, especially on weekends. Perhaps not the best place for a quiet date (maybe visit on a Monday or Tuesday for that). It's certainly the kind of place you visit to have a memorable night out on the town before dancing of after a show."}
{"text":"Will not be going back..  The decor of this restaurant is quite trendy. I love the heavy wood furnishings and the 3 tier awning type windows but despise those gargantuan operation room lights above every table (with a moniker like Grinder it feels like I'm in for a Sweeney Todd episode). The center looks nice and overall the restaurant gives me a feel like it might be a hot spot for drinks. Upon entering we were greeted by 3 different people which was a red flag from the start. The menus the were given to us are covered with thick plastic on both sides and is pretty heavy (hate it).  We did not receive our bread and butter like most other tables while waiting on our service.  First appetizer we ordered was the tuna tataki which was quite disappointing. The slices of tuna were very thin compared to what I've had at Ferreira's or Mikasa for example. The garnish did not  bring out the flavor of the tuna at all and bizarrely tasted of tomato salsa. It was just not what I expected or up to par with what I've had before.  Second appetizer we ordered was the beer flavored French onion soup. The flavor was okay and lacked some nice chunks of bread but it was not as comforting as a traditional French onion soup. For a kickass French onion soup made with love I'd say try Bistro Duo D down the street.   Finally, my 'main' was the large portion of salmon tartare that lacked the lime, cilantro, and avocado that was noted on the menu. The salmon was grinded (for shame!) and it appeared as if it was the fattiest slab of salmon that they used. It was awful and definitely no culinary adoration was put into this dish. I was hoping with meticulously diced chunks of salmon with the freshness of avocado and cilantro but alas it was forgotten amongst other things. My husband ordered the short ribs but was given the skirt steak. Surprisingly, it turned out pretty good and so were the fries that came with it, however it wasn't the order that was placed.  This restaurant has so much potential given the location and trendy decor. I see it being very busy during the summertime given that the windows open up and the have a good sound system going on. They might have something promising if they improve their dishes, service, and possibly change up the menu a bit but until then I believe it will struggle once the honeymoon phase is over with the hipster crowd."}
{"text":"I had probably one of the worst experiences at a restaurant ever tonight here. We had come for my mom's birthday; she wanted to take the whole family here because she usually comes for lunch and said it was one of her favourite restaurants in the city. I could already tell when they were seating us that we were pegged as people who don't matter since a family of four didn't match their \"scene.\" The food took nearly an hour and a half to get to our table and when we asked why, the waiter fed us some excuse that the kitchen didn't have enough room on the grills for our food. I would assume that a restaurant of that size would have enough room on a grill for more than one meal at a time. Most likely, if they had to choose which table got their food first between us and a \"hipper\" table, they would go with the latter. Already frustrated, we ate quickly, skipped dessert and asked for the bill. It took us another twenty minutes to pay. You would think after the experience, they would take our credit card as soon as possible. The waiter's answer for that one was that it wasn't his job... Finally, on a side note, valet parking involves getting us our car: not greedily taking our money and pointing us in the direction of the car parked down the road. It's too bad that my mom's favourite restaurant is one she will not be returning to anymore."}
{"text":"I have been to Grinder before just for drinks but last night was the first time I ate there. Nice cocktail menu. The Pimm's Royale was really nice. My friends ordered the oysters to start with and they said they were fresh and delicious. The staff was reasonably knowledgable and helpful with any questions we had regarding the wine, cocktails and the food. I ordered the burger not expecting it to be anything wonderful but to my surprise it really was delicious! You get a nice number of options for the side dish. I had the seasonal vegetables. It was a nice mix of kale, cauliflower, cheese, pecans and almonds. Really nice dish to accompany my very nice burger topped with cheese and bacon. For dessert I ordered the cheescake with a mango topping in a raspberry coolis. It wasn't exactly a NY style dense cheescake. Was more like a mousse but still really good and after a burger, probably a lot better than a heavy cheesecake. All in all I thought the food was better and more satisfying than most of these \"cool\" Montreal hotspots and I'm looking forward to returning."}
{"text":"Décor enivrant! Service personnalisée, sans compte l'expérience gastronomique exquise !"}
{"text":"That is probably the only steak house in Montreal that combines top quality with a vibrant ambiance. although it's not aged neither it's Wagu , but the ribeye was fantastic, it came exactly medium rare as ordered crispy from the surface and jussy from inside, it melts under the tong without compromising on the wonderful honest flavor of the meat , i don't think they marinade their steaks and they shouldn't, it's a culinary crime to mask such a great quality meat with other flavored no matter what they are, you can order whatever you fact with your meat on the side and they aren't short of options ,after the dinner we went to the bar for some digestive shuts , coming from someone who travels the world for dining and wining , these bar tenders are something else ,kindness is easy to learn but these guys are so genuine and true gentlemen , I can right a whole page about how happy they made us feelbut this types of reviews meant to be brief , well done , all stars"}
{"text":"I recently came to this restaurant after hearing so much about how great it was from many friends. We came on a Sunday evening for an early dinner. The drinks were great and the food was phenomenal. My only complaint is there were no highchairs and we were with our 1 year old daughter. Now, I get that this is a \"hip\" restaurant but having 1-2 simple highchairs is pretty basic for any restaurant. When I asked for a highchair the Manager told me they didn't have any because \"they aren't a family restaurant & don't caterer to that clientele\"...honestly, I just think that is lame because just because my husband & I have a child, we still go to all the same restaurants with our baby and this is the 1st place we have ever run into this issue. On top of that, after I sat down I glanced around the restaurant and noticed 2 other tables of couples with kids. So they might not \"caterer\" to families, but their customers consist of families and the least they could do is have a few high chairs.  In the same vein, they should add a baby changing table in the bathrooms. These are really easy fixes and I hope the management makes these improvements!"}
{"text":"Trendy, charming & delicious... Grinder is the new hot spot in Montreal. We sat on the garden terrace on a warm summer night, and I was transported... With its European feel, I was surrounded by gorgeously lit trees and beautiful people. My hanger steak was perfectly cooked and topped with a Chimichurri sauce...unique! My fries were thin and perfectly crispy. This place is perfect for groups, or a hot date, or just for a drink and people watching. The music was perfect. After a couple of chilled white wines, you're not sure you want to leave..."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and great food! The patio was very charming and service was very laid back. Nice wine list with a good selection of roses.  We had a burger, fries, salad and tuna which was very good, but the couple next to us shared the bone in ribeye........looks like that's the meal to get!"}
{"text":"Hi everyone,   Grinder is a fairly new restaurant and usually is quite busy and delivers on a good time however it is APALLING to me that a restaurant in Montreal in this day and age, regardless if they are a steak house or not, has 1 measly green salad as a vegetarian option!! By not offering any decent vegetarian options, you are limiting your market significantly..if only 1 person in a party is vegetarian, Grinder automatically is not an option. Don't let how busy you are now go to your head, in Montreal you are cool one day and completely irrelvant the next. Food for thought."}
{"text":"We tried this place a few weeks ago for appetizers and drinks just to check it out since we live in the neighborhood. I have to say the inside was amazing; trendy, clean, really cool light fixtures, interesting decor and open kitchen.   We sat at the bar and our bartender was less than enthusiastic. Granted, we had a slight language barrier as our French is not perfect, but still, the bartenders could have at least smiled--after all, a smile is universal! It's like the staff thought they were the cool kids from high school and we should be appreciative they even let us come into their restaurant! Very weird...  We tried the calamari and a side of mashed potatoes. The food was okay. The calamari had a really nice flavor, but the potatoes were below average. We had two beers, one glass of wine, calamari, and potatoes and the bill was over 50 dollars!   Though the location is great and the ambiance is appealing; we will not be returning. The service was not friendly at all and it seemed our business was appreciated what-so-ever."}
{"text":"J'ai très souvent entendu parler du Grinder, j'avais donc beaucoup d'attente. J'ai prit le tataki de boeuf en entrée, qui était très bon, ainsi que le tartare de boeuf. J'ai aimé mon tartare, mais j'ai déjà manger un meilleure tartare ailleurs. Mon amie a prit celui au saumon. J'ai mieux aimer le tartare de saumon, question de goût.  J'ai beaucoup aimé l'ambiance et le décor, par contre, plutôt cher.  Bref j'ai apprécier ma soirée, moins ma facture!"}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant.    We really had great service.  They had a new menu so our watress couldn't answer my questions so she took the initiative to ask the kitchen and came back with all the answers.  I ate 2 appeteizers: salmon gravlax which was amazing and the beef carpaccio which was very bland.  Like most people, I would give it a 3.5"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere but extremely terrible service. We were sitting at the bar and there wasn't a lot of room to put our bags so we used the empty seat next to us. The waiter came and told us we couldn't use that chair because someone would be sitting there. I told him that I would obviously move it when someone showed up. The waiter did not look happy. No one showed up until we were about to leave. As for the rest of the night, we had to ask for everything, water, drinks, utensils, the bill, EVERYTHING. The waitress showed up a total of 2 times. To take our order and for the bill at the end. My steak was overcooked but no one bothered to check in and ask how we were doing. Overall a terrible experience, not worth the money."}
{"text":"Forty five minutes to get a menu. A fifty five dollar overcooked steak. Apparently medium rare means mostly grey with some pink in the middle. They helpfully explained that I was mistaken about the level of doneness, since they use thermometers. Total time to receive my grey dry steak was pushing three hours. If you have an evening and a hundred dollars to throw down and you are looking to eat c grade meat labeled as dry aged, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"After arriving at the nicely decorated and boisterous room I was asked what I wanted to drink. I picked regular water and received a small glass of lukewarm water no ice though I noticed bottled water was nicely chilled. Hmm not a good sign but I persevered. Had a rather dreary and greasy burger which I could not finish, then paid the $25 tab vowing never to return.  A very discouraging experience."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and vibe. Limited menu but good if you love steak. We tried the New York strip. There are 8 sauces available to try with the steak. The chimichurri was so delicious... best I've had. Great service in both French and English."}
{"text":"Quelle déception!  Quand j'y suis allée, ça faisait un bon moment déjà que j'en entendais parlé et, étant une fan de tartares, j'avais la curiosité dans le tapis!  Quand je suis arrivée, c'était la folie, tout le monde courait partout et c'était super bruyant. Ça a pris (sans exagération) au moins 5 minutes avant que quelqu'un nous dise bonjour... avant de nous dire que quelqu'un d'autre allait venir s'occuper de nous. On patiente encore quelques minutes... Le \"quelqu'un d'autre\" arrive, nous demande le nom de la réservation et nous demande de patienter. Encore!.... Finalement, on a pris place au bar après plus de 15 minutes dans l'entrée. Ça commence mal.  Notre serveuse était la barmaid... qui était très occupée et bête comme ses pieds. On lui a posé quelques questions sur le menu et elle ne nous a pas vraiment aidé. On a passé notre commande de nourriture et on lui a demandé un vin au verre qui irait bien avec nos plats. Elle est partie et est revenue avec deux verres, ne nous a pas présenté la bouteille, ne nous a pas dit ce qu'elle nous avait servi et ne nous l'a pas fait goûté...   Heureusement, les plats étaient bons... Malheureusement, pas assez pour racheter tout le reste... Je n'y retournerais pas."}
{"text":"Une belle déception! Prix exorbitant par rapport à la qualité... Une ambiance pour personne de type superficielle! Un service déplorable de l'accueil a la facture.  Je ne recommande ce restaurant à personne sauf si vous avez de l'argent à gaspiller..."}
{"text":"It had been a long day, had to say goodbye to my little shih the day before after a beautiful 15 years and I was feeling very sad. My sister and wife invited me out to dinner to lift my spirits and told me Grinder was supposed to be very tasty.  It's in Griffintown on Notre Dame, beautiful place with a decor that stimulates an aesthetic eye. It was very busy, pretty people, attentive, smiling staff.   We were seated outside and our waitress quickly came over to say hello.  The table next to us was being served and everything looked delicious, always a good sign.  The menu had all sorts of tasty, appealing choices, now I'm always an indecisive type and was trying to narrow it down between the tandoori halibut served with a tabouli couscous with cherry tomatoes and the lamb with eggplant and salsa verde.  All dishes come with your choice of sides, fries and mayo, heavenly mashed potatoes with cream and sharp cheddar and some green veggies.  I decided on the lamb rump with salsa verde and the mashed potatoes, my sister had the tandoori halibut and her other half had the steak with chimchuri.  We decided to get some sangria to start and to toast the passing if my little furry beauty...  There were 2 different kinds of sangria, we chose the one with rose wine, spiced rum, cassis, mint and mixed berries.  Our sangria quickly arrived, it was more of a cocktail then a sangria, first taste, bitter and very alcoholic taste. I like my sangria light and fruity tasting. This one was all cassis flavor.  Our waitress brought us some 7up to tone it down but we didn't end up drinking it.  Our meals soon arrived, my lamb was tender and good but the highlights were definitely the halibut tandoori and chimchuri beef.  Both were flavorful and perfectly cooked. My mashed potatoes were creamy, cheesy and decadent. The fries crispy and delicious so was the homemade mayo.  Our waitress was sweet and took our drinks off the bill without us asking.  All in all, I would come back. The food was tasty, nice presentation, filling portion size and a nice atmosphere.   If you like to hear yourselves talk you should avoid Saturday night but it's a lively place and worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Beautiful. Delicious. Efficient.   On Friday we were a group of 20 that were accommodated like royalty. I had their tuna tartare as a main with a side of fries and their delicious mayo/horseradish on the side. As a desert I had their pouding chaumeur to die for. It is rare a restaurant is able to handle a large group so well. The food was hot, came out in a timely manner, staff was nice and everyone had an amazing time. Highly recommended place for all types of events : dinner, business, date, group etc.  Thank you again to the amazing staff"}
{"text":"Food was fabulous! The service was less than for sure. As a recommendation from our hotel, we choose here to dine on our last evening; on the whole Montreal has been beyond amazing - this restaurant minus our server was fantastic. Time to change staff."}
{"text":"The food here was great, and the location is awesome, but sometimes when you start off on the wrong foot it's tough to give a great overall rating.  I was in meetings separately from my team that afternoon and asked that the team pick a place and make the reservations. So they did. I was first to arrive and said I was there for a reservation under the two names that could have made the reservation. The fact that I mentioned 2 names got me an eye roll from the bearded guy at the door (who at a minimum I would guess is a Manager / GM). I attempted to clarify by stating the time....blank look....until I was asked \"for how many?\"  I said \"4 or 5\" as I was not sure what the final numbers were because I was not with my team when they made the reservation. The response back was....\"Well how am I supposed to know which reservation is yours?  Anyways - I got seated. From then on the rest of the evening was great. Our waiter was very pleasant and helpful, the cocktails were reasonable (I am a bit of a snob on that area), the wine list was very good and the steaks, tartares, and carpaccios were excellent.   As the evening went on, the music started to get a little louder and more people were around the bar, so it had a great fun atmosphere, very lively.  Next time I will come a bit later and grab a spot with friends at the bar and I'm sure the rating will improve."}
{"text":"The setting and staff is amazing, but I expected more for this price point ($50+ per person). While my fried calamari appetizer, side mushrooms and vegetables were great, the main course (deer steak) was way too salty. The side fries were also too salty. The salmon tartare was disappointing and lacked seasoning. Basically there seems to be a lack of consistency, perhaps I just got unlucky. Gotta give it to the chef for the perfect cook on the steak though..."}
{"text":"Really cool interior and exterior patio. Enjoyed the food though found it pricey when compared to the quality. Staff were pleasant though not over friendly. The restaurant has become one of the go to be seen places on Notre Dame. People are not going there for the food. Mediocre at best."}
{"text":"If you like meat, this place is for you.  Ate here with a large group. Ordered a few platters for sharing. The meat was cooked to perfection. They had a variety of sauces for dipping as well - green coloured sauce (not sure what it is) is fantastic. The place was packed for a weeknight, very loud with many patrons.  Service was good. Frequent wine and water top-ups.  Decor is nice, with vintage chairs and airy space. Would return for sure."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Montreal!  I have been there twice...the service is excellent even the waitress remembered me.  The second time was for my birthday and was a great time!  The surf 'n turf is fantastic!!!  The lobster was fresh and the steak was perfectly cooked...also comes with shrimp and scallops.  Everything was flavorful and delicious.  My favorite drink is the Cooper Limonade.  I would recommend this place for a nice dinner out with friends!  All of my friends enjoyed everything that came to the table."}
{"text":"Great place.  We loved the food, the ambiance was great and super cute restaurant.  Service was good and friendly staff.  We ordered the surf and turf and was delicious.  Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Wow, that was disappointing!   The owners of this new resto made a major investment in the decor and they did a great job as the restaurant has a wonderful and unique decor. Exposed beams, shinny stainless vents, beautiful wood floors and highlights of glass and copper.   Unfortunately the service is not on par with the care and precision that went into the design and construction. The Maitre d' and our waiter's demeanour can best be described as surely and I immediately felt unwelcome. We were seated toward the rear of the restaurant near the  kitchen and seemed to be directly in line with some sort of cooling fan that cast a chill on our entire evening.   We were a group of 3 and ordered the Salmon Tartare, Beef Short Ribs & the Bavette. The Bavette was the clear winner. The food was good, but not mind blowing in any way.   Throughout the entire evening we felt as if were causing some sort of inconvenience to our waiter who was extremely unattentive. In addition to being generally unfriendly the service we received was not on par with this level of restaurant. The bread was very slow to arrive at our table, 2 people at our table were served their plates and then we waited about 5 minutes for the 3rd dish to arrive. For my friend who ordered the Bavette the waiter did not think to bring her a steak knife so she was stuck trying to cut through it with a butter knife. When we completed our dinner we sat around for an extended period of time and no one asked us if we would like the check. After I flagged someone down the bill arrived quickly and then we were left sitting with my credit card on the table for another 15 minutes without anyone coming by to process our payment. Again I had to flag down one of the staff. Not once did someone say 'sorry for the delay' or apologize in any manner.   The restaurant was reasonably busy, but well staffed so I can't blame any of the above on a shortage of staff or excessive stress on the staff.   Our overall experience at Grinder was poor. Never did we feel that our presence in the restaurant was appreciated in any manner. There are a large number of terrific restaurants in Montreal where you can spend your money and thoroughly enjoy yourself so I would recommend spending your evening somewhere else."}
{"text":"Ambiance is very hip and projects a mature resto/lounge vibe. I'm sure this place is even better in the summer when the windows are open on the terrase side. Waitress was nice and quite helpful when it came to ordering. We ordered the rib steak ( medium rare) with two sides - mashed potatoes and mushrooms. No complaints with the meat. It was more on the rare side but I couldn't care less because I love it rare. Just make sure to order it medium if you want it medium rare because it was very VERY pink Inside ordering it medium rare.  The mashed potatoes were good and served very hot. Mushrooms were nothing special. Portions are very small and I found it overall pricey.  I guess you can say your paying for the location and environment.   The food overall... Not WOW, but acceptable. Loved the atmosphere, I'd come back solely for drinks and appetizers with my friends."}
{"text":"mehhhh. Bon alors oui c'est sûr, c'est fancy... mais bon, je trouve que pour un restaurant fancy, il faudrait aussi que le service le soit tout autant. Le tartare n'était vraiment pas exceptionnel. Très déçue...en revanche le burger relevait un peu le niveau, mais bon pas de quoi fouetter un chat. Je n'y retournerai pas de si tôt. Je suis un peu déçue moi qui était impatiente d'y aller."}
{"text":"Upon enter the restaurant the atmosphere was wonderful. The service was superb and the dinner was spectacular.   We would come again.   Edward thanks for giving up your reservation."}
{"text":"Endroit super snob avec un très mauvais service. Le tartare de saumon était fade et même le Bloody Caesar était raté! Je n'y retournerai plus jamais."}
{"text":"Grinder was awesome. From the moment my gf and two friends walked in, we were taken care from start to finish. The little details in the experience were awesome like: the staff taking our coats, floor manager coming around to top off our wine, and of course, THE FOOD. Great portions, high quality and awesome taste.  Very impressed. Will definitely be back!  Recommendation: if you get a chance, check out Grinders butchery just a few stores down that supplies all the meat. It'll help you appreciate the food you're eating just a bit more :)  We got the 40oz Porterhouse steak for 2 and my friends got the 40oz Rib Steak for 2. They came with 2 sides each as a combo."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great and the valet parking is very nice to have. The food is really bla... was not impressed with the food at all. I think people go there for the atmosphere and not the food"}
{"text":"3 words: simply the best  Love the ambience, the food is simply amazing. Service is good. Love  the cocktails there , they also have a really nice  patio outside with heating lamps. This place is obviously my favorite place in montreal, no doubt about it."}
{"text":"Since I'm from New York, I was told by my girlfriends brother that Yelp in Montreal is not accurate or representative having not really caught on yet as it has in New York  - which I can confirm, because there's no way this place can possibly be 3 stars.   Popped in here after perusing their butcher shop that's located just a block away and decided we needed to try something. Had the burger and couple glasses of wine...it was one of the best burgers I've ever had in my life: Canada AA rated American beef, cooked to perfection with amazing texture and construction. Staff very friendly and hospitable (minus the host, he was actually quite rude when we walked in at 5:30...the place was empty but he considered not seating us due to the incoming evening reservations - eventually he let us sit at the bar but said, \"you need to be gone by 7:30\"). Very cool space as well.  Highly recommend this place for locals and anyone passing through."}
{"text":"Ok, so this is the third time I have been here and each time I wonder what all the fuss is about. Obviously a very trendy place but the food does not rise to the level of the atmosphere. We were three for dinner on a Friday night, valet parking is much needed and appreciated. Started with drinks, wine served right away but my beer took well into the appetizers before arriving, changing tanks they said. We all had salads which were good, not great. I had the short ribs and my wife and daughter both had the salmon. The short ribs had zero taste. Salmon was reported to be good. The vegetable side was mostly mushrooms, again little or no taste, other sides were ok, sweet potato fries were the best of the sides. Didn't have desert. And oh by the way, toilet in men's room is broken, such a turn off when restrooms are dirty. The service is kinda weird, they have a different person for everything, water, bread, order, food delivery, table cleanup...all different people. Other than the waitress who took our order, everyone else seemed ticked off having to be at work on a nice Friday evening. Too much money for a mediocre dinner out. Won't be back."}
{"text":"I thought the ambience,  food and service were very good. I'd recommend this place to my friends."}
{"text":"I went here with a friend a couple of weeks back and overall nothing spectacular.   Good: the atmosphere was pleasant, being that the place was filled with young professionals that were well dressed, the place was properly designed, the staff had great energy, etc. The drinks were well mixed but a little expensive. Due to the upbeat energy, I would pay a premium on the drinks. Great place for a 5 à 7. However:   Bad. The overpriced food was far from the greatest. I had calamari and the sauce was, without  exaggerating, ketchup. The well portion tartar was flavourful however the side I salad was very basic and boring. The salad was prepared as if the cook was in a rush and was late for work.   Conclusion: The place would be better if it was just a bar that served food but their liquor permit would restrict them to do so. I would only go back if I was dragged there for a birthday/office/other party. Would not go back on my own free will. If this was a purely a bar, I would absolutely go back to enjoy its great energy."}
{"text":"Poor experience and terrible service. Waiter was rude and gave extremely lackluster service. They a get two stars bcs the music was good."}
{"text":"One of my best friends had organized her own birthday to be held in Grinder in a special private room on the second floor near the back of the facility.  It's a completely separate room which used to be an apartment that the restaurant just bought out and added it to their own.  It had about 6 large tables and could seat upwards of 40+ people if necessary but this party was going to be smaller than that.   The party was going to be on the Saturday but we were able to come in on Friday evening and set up the place with all the decorations and set up the tables the way we wanted.  I have to say the staff here was very accommodating and helpful which included the valet at the front to the individuals who allowed us access to the room and showed us the set up etc.  We had a menu to choose from for this special event being held in the back and considering this place has their own boucherie (butcher shop) right across the street it's safe to say the quality of meats as well as other dishes served here would be as fresh as could be.    In addition to the variety of starters which were being served the choices for the menu consisted of a variety of meats  with fish choices as well.  For starters we had had the beef tataki which was served with cashews and bacon while my wife had the candied salmon which were perfect as tasters.  For our mains we had the skirt steak and tuna steak.    While this was a still a private function the chef which was looking after the party had a very good variety of choices and the quality of the dishes were great.  I enjoyed both desserts as well, one which was sort of a chocolate lava and the other was sort of a caramel crumble."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurant in Montreal!!  Went seven months ago.  Just now getting around to reviewing.  Will definitely go back next time I am in country."}
{"text":"OH MY GOD! The food here is incredible! Four of us visited from New York. We were not disappointed with anything we got! Everything was absolutely delicious. I recommend the porter house. This steak was just fantastic. The staff is very friendly. Our waiters were Nicholas and a new employee, Justin. They were both great and answered any of our annoying \"tourist\" questions. Would definitely come back to Montreal just to eat here."}
{"text":"Service was adequate. Shrimp appetizer was amazing. Bread was awful, just like something they pulled from the bag. Halibut was soggy, avoid. Atmosphere was amazing. I may give it another try for the burgers but overall a mediocre experience."}
{"text":"When you are ready to dish out $400 or more for dinner, you don't want to be told when to eat (7pm sharp ) and when you need to leave (9pm)  If you are ready to put up with that..then you found the right place.   Otherwise find yourself another restaurant that won't be having you look at your watch while you eat.   Arrogance is not on my menu."}
{"text":"English follows Expérience très décevante avec ce restaurant qui manque sérieusement de professionnalisme. J'ai envoyé une demande de réservation par courriel à ce restaurant 3 semaines avant la date souhaitée. Une semaine plus tard, on me répond que l'heure souhaitée n'est pas disponible et on me propose alors 19h ou 21h. Étant consciente que mon groupe est important (22 personnes), j'acquiesce pour 21h dans l'heure suivant la réception du courriel. La réponse téléphonique, le lendemain seulement fut plus qu'inacceptable. On m'a informé que malheureusement ma réservation ne pouvait tenir puisque dans la dite heure un autre groupe a téléphoné et réserver et que plutôt qu'attendre ma réponse qui je le souligne encore a été fournie dans l'heure de réception du courriel et que plus encore ma demande initiale datait d'une semaine à ce moment, ils ont donné la réservation à ce groupe plutôt qu'au mien. Je trouve inacceptable qu'un resto de quartier nouvellement arrivé fonctionne de cette façon et je vais vivement parler de cette expérience à mon entourage.  I made an online reservation for a group of 22 people 3 weeks prior to the date wanted. A week after the initial email I got a reply that the time wanted wasn't available and two alternative options were given to me. I replied to the said email within the hour it was sent expressing my flexibility and accepting one of the two time slot offered. That was only to get a call the next day telling me that within that hour the space for my group was given to another group who had called in  the meantime and confirmed one of the time offered to me. Remember, I had sent my initial request a week before those people called and I was bump straight away when others called to make reservations. This is inacceptable customer service and I would have understand if I had taken a day or two to reply. Considering I replied quickly and I was open straight away to flexibility, this more than disappointing."}
{"text":"Recently went to Grinder...I would definately recommend this place for drinks and there is music. However, if you plan on having a social dinner with conversation...I would not recommennd as music is quite loud.  Interior decor is very nice and trendy.  Also if you are a big group I would  not recommend getting there earlier than reservation time as they do not allow you to wait in the entrance due to lack of room. We arrived 15 min earlier and were told to wait outside in the rain.  Food was good overall...would recommend Cornish Hen ....very tasty."}
{"text":"The name \"Grinder\" made me expect some lame sandwich shop, but I was totally wrong.  The food was amazing!  Super loud and crowded, it's popular. But, delicious."}
{"text":"I have eaten here about 3 times. I love it, great service great good. I've had the steak for 2 with the bells and whistles. This time I had the beef short ribs which just melted in my mouth. Ahhhh Wonderful! Did I tell you the sweet potato fries are good and healthy.. Good choice if you are going!! Will be back...."}
{"text":"The scene here is phenomenal even on a Monday. A hot crowd sipping cocktails and wine while eating finely crafted cuts of ages beef and tartars. All while backed by energetic beats and an eclectic vibe.   The food and cocktails were of outstanding quality and the menu was condensed and red meat focused, but had something for fish and veggie lovers alike.   It's a must return to restaurant next time I'm in Montreal."}
{"text":"Bel endroit fréquenté par les pitounes à cash et les hommes mariés voulant contempler la vitrine.  Nourriture loin d'être généreuse... Salade de betteraves et de chèvre où on avait emplie l'assiette de verdures pour faire du remplissage à rabais, mousse à la mangue qui a suscité le fou rire de toute la table tant c'était mal présenté (ça ressemblait à un cerveau)... Bref, plus qu'ordinaire."}
{"text":"Grinder is by far my favourite place to eat when I come to Montreal. I love their steak for two and if I'm ever on a date I usually like to sit at the bar and socialize, unless I am with a big group. You should try their mush potatoes, oysters, tartare, steak... everything is very fairly priced. I'd recommend to make a reservation because the place is mostly always full."}
{"text":"This place is just plain fun! Great atmosphere, good vibes! Noisy, packed, delicious food, excellent mixed drinks... Go and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Meh. It's meh. This place is next to my house and is very hit and miss. The highlight of the evening was the oysters (thanks to Dan Notkin!) and the great reasonable wine selection. The disappointment was my main. The halibut was watery and tasteless despite being 'tandoori' and my scallop dish was bathed in what tasted like Italian dressing. BLECH! Stick to the oysters and wine and you won't go wrong."}
{"text":"I'm quite surprised Grinder only has 3 stars.   Sure, the restaurant is a mix of hipster and business-casual, it's located in the hottest new area of Montreal, and the prices are a little higher than they should be. That's been the gossip about this restaurant for as long as it's been around, which is why I had never actively chosen to go there. Well, last week, a buddy of mine was in town and wanted to go to Grinder with a bunch of friends to catch up. It wouldn't have been my first choice, but figured I'd take the opportunity to see what all the fuss was about.   At the table, people ordered burgers, lamb chops, salads, and a bunch of stuff from the raw bar. There were no negative comments from anyone. The burgers were thick and juicy, the fries were crispy and salted just right, the lamb chops were cooked to a perfect medium rare, the salads were fresh, and the drinks paired nicely.  The kicker... the raw bar! My fiancée and I decided to go for an all raw dinner. We started with the beef tartare and shared the salmon and tuna tartares as the mains. Aside from being platted beautifully and being absolutely delicious, the three tartares had completely different flavors. It was really nice to see that some great creativity had gone into the prep. The portions were nice, making the entire meal a worthwhile expense.   Our buddy broke some news that he received a promotion, so we arranged for the waiter to bring him a dessert. Not only did he bring a delicious pouding chomeur, but he also brought a round of hot shots for the 12 of us at the table... all on the house. To top it off, although I was full, the brownie on the dessert menu was calling my name. Unfortunately, it was bone dry and terribly disappointing. The waiter noticed we hadn't eaten it and, without hesitation, offered another dessert saying we wouldn't be charged for either. The service had been great all night, but these were small gestures that went a long way.  (The brownie was replaced with a carrot cake that was delectable... definitely go for that one!)  All in all, I'm really happy my buddy suggested we go there. I'll be back and I recommend you go too!"}
{"text":"A Montreal landmark that I'd surprisingly never been to! I went on a Friday night in early July and got to enjoy the outdoor seating. Reservations recommended. The restaurant was lively, but not too packed. Service was quick, but not in your face. The food was fantastic. It gets quite dark in here so be prepared to be squinting and shouting at each other by the end of the meal."}
{"text":"I had lunch yesterday at Grinder; salmon with mushrooms and soup. The food was greasy. Four hours later I got a very bad diarrhea."}
{"text":"The tuna tataki wasn't great but it may be because I'm measuring it by Vancouver's standard. The waitress was cordial and offered to take back the tuna for another dish. Got the duck tataki which was measurably better tasting which reinforced the advise I received several times in Montreal; skip the seafood and go for the livestock."}
{"text":"Was in town for a bachelor party and had the luxury of organizing all the events including the dinners. As it was my first time in Montreal, I relied on friends recommendations and social media. As I'm from Vancouver, we don't have proper supper clubs so this was new for most of us. Now don't let the name scare you off.. If you are looking for a trendy/hip more mature crowd and great atmosphere then you need to do yourself a favor and come here! I ordered the Duck Tartare, followed by the Beef Short Ribs all while washing them down with my go to drink - Old Fashions. Depending what your purpose is (dinner or lounge) I recommend calling to reserve seats as this place gets packed. We had another destination to go to so I unfortunately didn't stay for the lounge therefore I don't have a review for it however I will definitely make it a point to come here again!"}
{"text":"Grinder is renowned for its beef meat; this steakhouse has its own butcher shop next to it.  They have a nice setting, a cozy inner terrasse for the summer.  We shared the famous Tomahawk rib steak, it's good, however the Burger 1855 is delicious!!! On the other side, service was really slow; food took some time, bills took an eternity, we had to order it several times!!! In addition we asked for bread and butter, they brought us 2 small buns for a big table of 12. Finally the waiter was a bit pushy, he wanted us to order the soonest!!"}
{"text":"From the moment I walked in, I was quite impressed. A mix between hipster and a classy vibe/atmosphere. I went with my boy and definitely could see myself taking out a beautiful woman on a date here.  We were seated, the music was a tad bit loud but enough to have a conversation. I went for the whole cornish hen and unfortunately, it was sold out by the time I was seated at 10pm. So I went for the salmon fillet and mushrooms/sweet potato fries as my sides.  Salmon fillet was good but not worth the price. The mushrooms were okay, also not worth the price but the sweet potato fries were excellent.  The service was great. All in all, I'll give Grinder a 4 stars because of their design, location, service, and good food.  Would I come back here? Possibly."}
{"text":"One of the best steaks I've had while. It was perfectly cooked, tasted just right. The mashed potatoes are also insane! Yes it's pricey, yes it's loud but the food is so good. My husband and I sat alone and enjoyed every minute!"}
{"text":"The steak wasn't the best. I got the aged rib eye. 6.5/10. The elasticity of the steak was horrible, could hardly chew it. The Tartar was good. 8/10. Hans served us and his service was impeccable. I would go back because I liked the ambiance and the service. Got free desert and shots as well. Overall experience was 10/10 even though the food wasn't the best. The desert you see = 11/10. Warm vanilla cake soaked in caramel sauce with vanilla ice cream on the side. Thanks Hans."}
{"text":"Now this is what you call the most arrogant manager and staff .  Was invited by a customer ,  bar tender dropped the Martini on my suit and still an hour later asked us to leave because the bar stools are reserved !!  Food is not bad , but you have like 2 hours to Sit , eat, drink and then they Kick you out because they already booked the table ."}
{"text":"Atmosphere, food, everything all amazing.   I was with a group and we ordered both the t bone and Chateaubriand but both were mouth watering.   The mashed potatoes were served in a cast iron pan and we're the best mashed potatoes I've ever had. My God. Wow. This is a great place and I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"So yes, as my companion and previous reviews suggested, the raw bar here did not disappoint. I remain confused about this place. Packed with reservations from 6-9 we had a meeting with a staff member so they fit us in and we got to watch the place fill up with business men and women with their day to evening outfits. Sexy crowd if you're into that scene and the layout is well setup for the all important sight lines.  The gal at the bar was friendly, laid back and really professional (plus the patience of a saint when it came to helping out the solo guy next to me who wanted her thoughts on every wine on the list.) To be fair the list was extensive and had lots I'd like to try.  The oysters were perfectly prepared, and perfectly fresh. I could have eaten a second dozen all on my own, but propriety and the budget prevailed.. This time.."}
{"text":"Not my favourite to say the least! I came here as part of a large group for a friends birthday, and a few members of the party were vegetarians, so they ordered salads and side salads. Due to alcohol permits (or lack thereof) the restaurant complained to our party that we did not order enough food.  Furthermore, those who did order the salads received romaine lettuce that was browning and not fresh at all.  The management was accommodating and replaced the brown salads with sautéed seasonal vegetables but frankly, this dish too was not very appetizing.   Lastly, and this is real the \"nail\" quite literally in the coffin, my friend who ordered a tartar as a main bit into a small little screw which she was then told was from the pepper mill.   In conclusion, I will not be going back there."}
{"text":"What an arrogant place! Ew! They are empty and yet would give you the shi...iest table! They tell you to leave if you passed 2 hr limit regardless you're still waiting for deserts. They would literally take your plates with food and rush you to finish the dinner. Btw you can't have drinks if you don't eat. Montreal is full of much better options than this crap!"}
{"text":"The food was horrendous and service abysmal. Several different waiters and waitresses kept asking for our orders in triplicate. As if no one knew who was assigned to our table. Very choppy service. Would not go back."}
{"text":"Ambience and the food are great. The concept of valet parking in Montreal seemed a bit odd, given the location and often ease of finding parking nearby BUT still appreciated. Our waiter was very cordial and pleasant. The food was top notch. The place was a bit loud, and slightly over priced. However, I wouldn't rule it out for celebrations."}
{"text":"My new Montreal favorite.  We shared the Chateau Briand and it was fantastic.  The mushrooms were ....no words.  Just perfect.  Can't wait to go back. Service was great"}
{"text":"5 stars for ambiance, 3.5 stars for food. Grinder is great if ur looking for a cool vibe and trendy atmosphere - perfect for a fun dinner and drinks. The food is yummy but the ambiance is definitely what makes it stand out."}
{"text":"Waitresses always have annoyed face, so much attitude, you cant ask them a question about food or anything. A/C is blasted to its maximum, you feel like you are in Alaska. Music is so loud you cant even hear your friends next to you. Food is over priced for its quality, 3 times so far i felt sick after their filet mignon. Cocktails are 70% ice. I guess all you are paying for is their rent, the \"ambience\" (grinder is a place for a hook up, you have bunch of guys in suits and girls almost naked looking for fun) . Honestly, a place to avoid if you want quality experience"}
{"text":"Very nice decor, very trendy layout. Great atmosphere. What I didn't like was out seating area, it was too close to the bar way to much traffic for my liking.      Anyway let's get to the food. We started with the salmon tartar.... Best tar tar I have ever tried. Nice balance between the fresh salmon, coriander , citrus and green onion it was fantastic!  I had the Burger and potatoes aligot, and my gf had the New York strip and the potatoes aligot. Let me just say the potatoes were incredible... The right balance of cream, cheddar, chive... Amazing. My hamburger was also very good. The meat was cooked nicely and the condiments on the burger were slightly elevated... Honestly for a burger it was great!   My gf raved about her steak. She said it was better then a Moishes steak. It was tender and well seasoned accompanied by a ratatouille, pepper sauce au jus and bone marrow.  All in all it was a pleasant experience. Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Very nice resto-bar with amazing decor and music. The food was pretty good, we ordered the surf n' turf (lobster, shrimp, scallop and 40oz tomahawk steak to share) which was alright, but the meat was bland. The burger was pretty decent though, and the cocktails were amazing. Hip crowd, perfect for dinner before a night out. Definitely a place to try if you haven't yet."}
{"text":"Such a great place to enjoy some good food with great friends!   This new restaurant serves modern cuisine as well as classic French dishes with a nice twist! Such a nice environment when you walk in, it has a nice rustic yet home-y touch to it.   We got a couple of orders from the appetizers to share amongst each other, as well as two entrees.   For our shareable foods we chose the calamari, the French onion soup, and the garganelli penne pasta. The calamari tasted normal, nothing that fancy about it but it was still good! The penne pasta serving was quite small, it was still delicious but I feel like it could have been more saucier. The French onion soup was amazing! With the toasted bread in there as well, it gives it a perfect texture with the tasty broth-like soup and the melted cheese!!!  For our entrees, I chose the fried Cornish hen and my wife got the beef short ribs. To be honest, the Cornish hen was alright, and it was more like a rotisserie chicken and \"fried\". I wasn't expecting that. Still juicy and flavorful but nothing spectacular. The beef short ribs were pretty good, very tender, maybe a little bit salty.   All in all, I'll have to come back here to try some more dishes but I still loved the atmosphere of this place. I also really enjoyed the service here!"}
{"text":"J'ai essayé ce restaurant avec un ami. L'endroit est vraiment plaisant, un magnifique décor et nous avons été agréablement accueilli. Nous avons commandé un tartare de saumon et un tartare de boeuf accompagné de bulles. La presentation était simple, la portion quand même assez petite pour le 25 $ chargé c'est à se demander de quoi à l'air l'entrée. Beaucoup d'ambiance pour un mardi à ma grande surprise. Le petit plus: le shooter de café donné en cadeau à la fin du repas comme petit dessert. Good job :)"}
{"text":"Great architecture and trendy ambiance.   Fresh oysters served with vinegar were tasteful. When it arrived, the braised lamb shank was cold. Miso cod, which came half floating in an asian soup was good.   They offer an exhaustive wine list which is interesting. I had a delicious IP (private importation) white Marsannay.   Service and food were in general good, not the best though.  Maybe a bit overrated?  I'd say 3 1/2 stars."}
{"text":"I heard so much about this place, finally got to eat here with couple friends. The place is vibrant and trendy. The staff is cool.  For appetizers we ordered : Calamari with a marinara sauce, kind of bleh, I wouldn't recommend it. The salmon tartare was descent but nothing out of ordinary. We also had sweet potato fries with a good mayo sauce. For the main dishes, I got the halibout, it was blend nothing exciting. My friends got beef short ribs with espresso sauce, and lamb shack, again it wasn't the best meat you could have. There was a lot of it. Make sure you are hungry. We had pudding chômeur with ice cream and a Sunday, they were both pretty good but that just sent us into a food coma and a sugar high. Not the best feeling when you try to get your dancing on"}
{"text":"Awesome meal! Friendly, fast service! Starting cocktails were delicious and the wine list is great, reasonably priced. We had delicious oysters to start! I had the beef tartare - awesome. My friend had the burger which he said was one of the best he's had... and the cheesy mashed potatoes are to die for!! Highlight though was the dessert.. their homemade soft serve ice cream with caramel and chocolate drizzle - wow! I love soft serve and this was incredible! Will definitely go back, super atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I went to grinder at 9pm on a Friday night with my girlfriends. We had to wait a bit even though we made reservations. We ordered wine at the bar. I like that it's open and that fresh air comes in.   We shared two bottles of white wine. I ordered the duck tartare. It was really good and it came with fries which were also really good. I tried my colleagues salmon tartare but honestly I preferred the duck. We ordered a side of mashed potatoes and we dipped our fries in it. Omg You gotta try it! The mashed potatoes were so creamy and cheesy. It was fingerlicking good! We did a couple of shots with the waiter and got a free dessert. The shots had coffee in it. It went down smooth. The dessert was pudding chomeur. It was delicious! I left there feeling satisfied and not overly full so it was perfect.  The food was good. The ambiance was good. What's not to like?!  I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"The name of this place definitely through me off when I was told about it. I definitely though it was some kind of male strip club, but it definitely wasn't. lol.  Grinder is a trendy and upbeat restaurant in Montreal. It has more of a loungey vibe and the crowd seems like that is more so what they are there for. A few birthday groups and overall larger groups were seated throughout.   There is a huge bar in addition to the tables throughout the restaurant, so I grabbed a seat at the bar. I had an order of their salad that came with pecans, apples, goat cheese and maple dressing and it was delicious. Surprisingly one of the more delicious salads I've ever had. I also had an order of their short ribs and sweet potato fries, which were very good.  The bartenders were friendly and they have a very good spirit selection. Between the overall trendy vibe here, good food and good drinks, Grinder is definitely an awesome spot to check out if you're looking to have an overall good time in the city."}
{"text":"Looked like a cool place to come. I did, and the ambience was good. Food came out so wrong and the girls bathroom was flooding and the staff did nothing about it. Also, we made a reso and the table wasn't ready til an hour after. Not impressed at all! I love Montreal, but his was a disappointment."}
{"text":"Une des adresses à retenir si vous venez dans Griffintown pour boire et manger. C'est le petit frère du Hachoir sur St-Denis. Super décor, bien aménagé, bouffe délicieuse, variétés sur le menu, vins/bières, service ok. Ils ont aussi une petite terrasse sur Notre-Dame, bien sympa pour un 5@7 réussi. *À savoir, vous devez commander à manger absolument car on ne peut pas que commander à boire.* J'y suis allé un mardi en fin d'après-midi et ça commencé à être plein. Je vous conseille de réserver si vous venez en début de soirée, ça se remplit vite et l'endroit est connu dans le coin. Pour passer, une agréable soirée dans Griffintown, c'est la place."}
{"text":"This restaurant is both fun and delicious.  The architecture is beautiful and we liked everything we ordered.  We had oysters, tartare (beef, salmon and tuna), beef carpaccio, and scallop tadakis. Cocktails were yummy and they have a variety of wines to choose from.  This place is on the pricey side, but I would recommend."}
{"text":"I had a great time here- came here on a Friday night at around 9PM and it was completely packed. My friend and I shared a dozen oysters and the porterhouse for two with mashed potatoes and veggies on the side. The porterhouse was melt-in-your mouth amazing. For dessert we had the pouding chômeur, which was also really good. I regret making this my first stop in Montreal because every restaurant I ate at the rest of the weekend did not compare to Grinder."}
{"text":"We had a great dinner and loved the ambience! The steak and tuna were both fantastic, as was the dessert (a warm bread pudding-like dish served with vanilla ice cream). Our server, Alex, was awesome and gave us great recommendations."}
{"text":"Been to this resto a few times and always had their specialty: a nice chunk of meat (a.k.a steak). Always cooked to perfection. This last time, I wasn't really in the mood for red meat so I tried their tuna tartare. It was ok, but didn't hit the spot. Lesson of the day: stick to their specialty. That being said, the pouding chomeur was divine! When reserving, ask for a seat outside to enjoy what little we have of summer."}
{"text":"Super cool new spot, really loved our experience, quinoah tabbouleh and fish was amazing. Price was very reasonable."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Ambiance is fun & young. Very big restaurant with cool decor. Dining at the bar was a great experience. You see the bartender and oyster guy work their magic. Food was good as well with nice portions. Both the beef tartare and tuna tataki Were delish. I took the 1/2 lobster as the main meal. Well seasoned and served with a nice butter dip. Hubby took lamb shank which he loved as well. Will go there for lunch too! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Avec un chum pour le souper, un mardi soir.  Il y a des pour et des contre.  POUR: qualité des plats, liste de vins. Tout était bon, assez travaillé mais pas trop non plus.  CONTRE: Cher, pas très généreux, beaucoup trop de clinquant parmi la foule, bruyant (c'est un bar ou un resto? Pas clair).  Pas mal occupé pour un mardi soir, l'endroit plaît, manifestement. Pour ma part je préfère les endroits un peu moins ostentatoires, mais sur un compte de dépense garni, pourquoi pas?"}
{"text":"Grinder is really the type of restaurant that can divide a room--as illustrated by previous reviews, people seem to love it or hate it.   I personally love the hustle and bustle of Grinder; this place is ALWAYS happening and the crowd is always beautiful. The interior is beautiful--especially the living wall on the open air side of the restaurant. Poor service is a common complaint about Grinder but after two visits I don't have anything particularly bad to say about the service--it was not exceptional but definitely satisfactory.   It is definitely possible to eat at Grinder and keep the bill fairly reasonable, but it is also very easy to let it get out of hand. On my first visit I had the appetizer duck tartar (quite big) with a side of mashed potatoes and a side of mushrooms; this was more than enough portion-wise and I thoroughly enjoyed each dish. On my second visit I shared with a friend; we split the beef short rib and raw scallops. The scallop plate was so small I found it to be bad value for money, but the beef short rib was amazing--I would order it again in a heartbeat. We finished off the meal with the soft-serve ice cream sundae--very good and very big (split if you can)."}
