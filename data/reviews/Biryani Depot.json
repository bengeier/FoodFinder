{"text":"Wrote in a mediocre review about their food quality and they appealed to Yelp to have it removed. Therefore I wonder if the reviews are selective."}
{"text":"Crap, just went today for lunch and ask for lamb biryani. They gave me bunch of rice and almost no meat. I had to throw it away and go somewhere else to eat."}
{"text":"This restaurant is located on the corner of Markham and Steeles and has some of the best Indian food in Toronto! Food is served fresh and delicious and prices are really reasonable!  I would highly encourage everyone to check this restaurant out."}
{"text":"Affordable prices and great taste for Briyani! They have daily specials so there are many varieties to choose from. This place is more for take out since its a small restaurant. Service and staff are friendly with explaining and recommending what is good on the menu. I would recommend this place for those wanting good Briyani for under $5!"}
{"text":"Can't believe this place is now closed. We dropped by to pick up some biryani on May 5th and were shocked to see the FOR SALE sign. Will surely miss this place."}
{"text":"Inconspicuous, unpretentious and underwhelming. The biryani is a good effort but fails on many levels; taste, aroma and texture. The rice is overcooked and seriously lacking in aroma (where's the saffron? admittedly that's too much to ask for $3.99 I agree) and the chicken is negligible. While the portions are ridiculous and the price is so 1995 I would save my appetite for the many other good middle-eastern/indian joints in this area."}
{"text":"$5? I only have $5 for lunch and dinner....  But I definitely can be full and happy from that $3.99 Chicken Biryani I got from Biryani Depot.  3 piece of chicken buried in all these rice... a full box packed all the way to the top. Nicely spiced and seasoned... that drumstick for sure is nice and tender...  And it taste better during dinner with I heat that up in the microwave...........  Oh.. I have change left.. enough for me to go to New Spiceland Supermarket at the same plaza to get a Mango Juice ($ .75) as dessert.........  If you prefer vegetarin biryani? $2.99 each! Maybe I can treat my vegetarian friend!"}
