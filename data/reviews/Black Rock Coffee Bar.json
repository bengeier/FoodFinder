{"text":"Great coffee and great smoothies! They give our puppy doggie treats in the drive through."}
{"text":"Great coffee and nice staff. The ambience is pretty good too. 4/5 because the coffee is a bit expensive."}
{"text":"Seriously good coffee!! I had the Caramel Blondie. My husband had the Whiteout. Very friendly staff and cool atmosphere. Check it out, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"We've been getting coffee at Black Rock on trips to Oregon (the original location) for many, many years. To find one here is a real treat that this area is lucky to have. The coffee, atmosphere, and people are all top notch and a breath of fresh air in a world where Starbucks runs the show. Support the folks at Black Rock - and enjoy great coffee and service too!"}
{"text":"So happy to have a good drive thru coffee place closer to home. They remind me a lot of Dutch Bros, friendly and great coffee."}
{"text":"Can you say smooth as butter!  My son now refers to their drinks as throat butter. Seriously good coffee and a great value if you compare to Sbux."}
{"text":"This place definitely won me over and it will be my go to coffee place. Great customer service and the Blackout was amazing. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great with seating for homework or chatting with friends. 
The staff was friendly and even upgraded my drink to a medium for the cost of a small.
The menu options are great and different than your average coffee shop- good variety of flavors for everyone."}
{"text":"Spread out across the valley! Love this place after having my first coffee in Oregon. Always busy but worth the wait. :)"}
{"text":"Got the caramel blondie with coconut milk and it was delicious!! Great customer service here--the cashier was super friendly and helpful! I like the atmosphere too; although, they could do with more seating!! Overall, great pick!"}
{"text":"I love love LOVE BR coffee! They have a simple menu and serve great tasting coffee. I've only had an iced americano and Nitro cold brew while visiting AZ and both were delicious! The staff at the Gilbert location seem genuinely friendly, not overly fake like at those other coffee places. I wish we had BR closer to home."}
{"text":"Might've found my new coffee spot!! A friend had recommended this place to me and I gave it a shot today. Tried the Mexican Mocha and I was in love!! Looking forward to trying the other things on the menu. And for the price is unbeatable. Loved the ambiance but the only thing is they should add more seats since I think the place is gonna be packed (popularity). Also maybe lower down the music a bit for the peeps who are trying to get some work done but other than that it was a great visit!! Will definitely come back and tell my friends about this place."}
{"text":"The coffee is delicious, options for any coffee lover! The atmosphere is great and the staff is super friendly. I can defiantly see myself hanging out here!"}
{"text":"Really mediocre coffee. Their blended drinks pale in comparison to Starbucks and especially Dutch Bros. I was extremely disappointed in the Mint Chip and Caramel Blondie."}
{"text":"Coffee has excellent flavor.  Very fast drive thru.  It's a bit rough with available seating but the atmosphere is awesome.  I feel like there is not enough seating for the space.  On a busy weekend morning, there is not a free seat in the house.  Great establishment."}
{"text":"I'm so excited that Black Rock Coffee is in my neighborhood! Iced coffees are light, refreshing, delicious, delightful and I could go on and on. Whoever designed the look of this coffee bar is a genius because it's fun and inviting! I also love how outgoing and aware the staff is! This is the perfect spot for anyone that enjoys hanging in a coffee bar (which is me)."}
{"text":"Had always wanted to try the other Black Rock location but never got to it, but now it's right down the street from me! 

Tldr; good coffee, friendly people, nice environment. 

I went for the grand opening today where all 16 oz. drinks are free so we got three chillers (blended): Oreo, Irish Coffee, and  Blackout. The Irish Coffee and Blackout were their premium drinks but they graciously offered to blend it. The 20 minute wait in line for our drinks were so worth it! It was amazing to not have crushed ice in or blended drinks, something Starbucks needs to work on. Also, the flavor wasn't overwhelming and the coffee is delicious. There wasn't any food to try but I saw the display cases for them so they might have some soon? The drinks are not super cheap nor very expensive, about the same as all the other coffee shops. 

Better than the drinks were the staff and the environment. When we were in line, one of the employees explained to us how the drinks are categorized and how they can be ordered. Up at the cash register, Jasmine was super sweet when I asked her about blending my drinks which weren't listed as chillers of the menu. She let me know that they will have punch cards and soon, loyalty cards. Everyone was upbeat and cheerful and friendly, definitely brought a smile to my face. 

Lastly, I know that this will be a new study spot for me because of the seating, the decor, and the music! They have a wall that boldly says \"Fuel your story\" and the furniture is beautiful. Nothing is crowded or cramped and the lighting makes it the perfect place for flawless selfies when procrastinating on things that need to be done"}
{"text":"So good!! The Irish coffee is the way to go. Staff is always super friendly, and now that locations are popping up all over, its become my go-to coffee shop."}
{"text":"Best coffee bar around! Very friendly staff and great environment to be in whether you are rolling solo or meeting with friends. Love the open environment, modern decor and music."}
{"text":"First time visiting and I am blown away by the Blackout! It is the perfect coffee to sweetener ratio. The staff is very chill and professional. I will definitely be returning here."}
{"text":"So happy to see a local coffee shop! I prefer to make my latte at home because I use the best coffee beans and organic whole milk for a cupful of yumminess every morning but today my husband treated me to have a latte at Black Rock and I was very happy with it! It was full bodied with a hint of chocolate and made to my specifications! It is very spacious too - they might need more seating as it was very busy for a Sunday evening! We will be back!"}
{"text":"My favorite go to coffee shop!! The staff is always incredibly friendly and down to Earth - it's nice when someone genuinely cares about how you're doing and puts pride into their work and I definitely feel that every time I am here! 

The caramel blondie with soy milk is my favorite but everything there is so delicious, it's hard to choose!!"}
{"text":"the only bad thing i have to say about this place that there is no location in the west valley!!! just sucks because such an amazing coffee place with amazing drinks that we cant enjoy it in the west valley hopefully they bring it to us soon because any time we are in the east valley it is a must to stop at black rock and get a cold brew a redbull sunrise drink and there lemonade with watermelon flavor!"}
{"text":"Totally awesome delicious coffee. No need for fluff the coffee is wonderful all on its own. No bite, no bitter after taste just great coffee!!"}
{"text":"Cool joint. Friendly and personable counter guy. Very knowledgeable and gave me a run down of all my options since I wasn't sure what to get, being that I wanted something low carb and decaf. Ended up with an iced decaf which was bomb and extra kudos for having iced decaf on deck  (Starbucks didn't last time I was there.)
 
It wasn't 5 stars for me just because they didn't offer heavy cream as an option, and that is integral to the keto/low carb coffee drink. Wasn't a huge deal cuz I took my drink home and added me own at home, but hey. We'll be back."}
{"text":"The coffee here is the best in town. The service is unbeatable. When busy the drive thru is still very speedy. I'm addicted."}
{"text":"Best coffee, hands down! I got the White Out (not on the menu) with soy milk and my partner in fun, got the Caramel Blondie w/almond milk."}
{"text":"Love this place! They've never messed up a drink (which always happens to me at other coffee places) and the staff is awesome!!"}
{"text":"Stopped by this morning  and waited over 20 mins for my order, then it was wrong. They gave me someone else's order. Do Not Spend your money not worth it. How can you mix up coffee, REALLY."}
{"text":"Amazing staff and delicious drinks!!! Coffee is smooth and strong! Def one of my favorites!!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere different from most coffee places looks very welcoming and clean. Got the jackhammer my first time in and great flavor and caffeine ruah"}
{"text":"Best coffee around!!  Love the iced Irish cream coffee. Staff is always friendly and knowledgeable."}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to visit Black Rock Coffee Bar in Mesa! The turn off is pretty quick once you're on Power Road, so be on the look out!

Black Rock Coffee Bar is a cool, hipster-vibe cafe. They offer classic coffee items, such as the  americano, drip, latte, and mocha. They then have the \"premium\" coffee menu where you can get some interesting special combos and flavors, like the \"blackout,\" which is a hazelnut mocha. They also offer drinks without espresso and have a children's menu for drinks like hot coco, smoothies, juice and milkshakes. They come in these small cute cups and they add a dollop of whip cream at the end of the straw as a special treat for the little ones. 

If you're not interested in getting out of your car, they have a drive-thru window for you to order your coffee on the go. If you opt to drink and sit for awhile, they have a moderate amount of seating consisting of some small and large tables, a couch section with low coffee tables, and a couple single seats. There aren't many outlets, so if you're looking to do a lot of computer work, you only really have 2 options, one small table and one long table with about 4 outlets. Internet is free, but you will have to ask for the password from the barista. Since it's close to a couple campuses, the barista did mention that it's usually filled with students studying from time-to-time. 

In addition to their drink menu, they offer some bottled drinks in their cooler, as well as some food items to fill your stomach, such as muffins and bagels. If you're looking to represent the establishment, they sell some cute apparel, including snapback hats, shirts, zip-up hoodies, HydroFlasks with their logo, and various mugs and cups.

Overall, it's a great coffee shop with really good coffee that isn't burnt, friendly staff, and a cool, modern-hipster vibe."}
{"text":"I was looking for a good coffee shop and saw this place while driving down the street. So glad I stopped on to give it a try, it did not disappoint. I love the blackout and the caramel blonde. The staff were super friendly and helpful with recommendations. The atmosphere is very relaxed, music is chill. I would definitely come back and recommend others to come here."}
{"text":"Loved the vibe of this coffee bar! It's a little out of my way, but I decided to stop in after hearing such great things. Black Rock did not disappoint! I ordered a Chai tea a little more on the sweet side and my fiancé got the caramel truffle. Both were delicious. I will for sure drive a little out of my way to grab a cold coffee when running errands again. LOVED IT!!!"}
{"text":"Second time dropping by Black Rock Coffee Bar. There's lots of sitting room inside to do work, as well as complimentary wi-fi. Service is great and it doesn't take too long to get your drink out! I love that there is a great range in drink choices for your caffeine addict as well as the beginner's introduction with sweeter options. The atmosphere is also quite nice with a hipster/industrial kind of vibe."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE! They have similarities to Dutch bros but SO much better. Great customer service with out being too in your face and the iced americano is never ever watered down (sorry Dutch )-- it's perfect every time. Also, their locations have a a nice, sophisticated farm house look . I get the large iced americano with cream (it's half&half) and 3 pumps of sugar. 

The quality of Dutch bros has gone down, their lines are just ridiculous and forget about Starbucks coffee -- thank goodness for Black Rock or else I just wouldn't drink coffee anymore. As a momma of two little ones I need this stuff and look forward to it everyday !"}
{"text":"Fantastic coffee coming from a Sicilian coffee drinker. Trever is a very nice and knowledgeable coffee man! I will be back"}
{"text":"Tried Black Rock for the first time yesterday. The baristas were very, very nice and filled me in on their most popular drinks. I ended up getting the iced caramel blondie and it was delicious, good recommendation! I studied here for about 4 hours, and overall I was able to focus pretty well. I will be back!"}
{"text":"I'm so glad they opened up a location in our neighborhood or I'd never known about them! They've replaced Starbucks and Dutch Bros! My go to is iced caramel macchiato with added shot but everything I've had is fabulous!!"}
{"text":"Order the Carmel blonde latte hot, on their recommendation it was delicious.  Gave 4 stars since it's my 1st time going will most likely go again"}
{"text":"Update from their opening: 

The outlet situation has improved! They have a huge extension cord which multiple outlets in the middle area. It doesn't add to the aesthetics of the area, but I'll take it. Additionally, the place isn't too crowded so I had no trouble grabbing the prime table with the outlet. 

The chairs have small backrests which are pretty low. 

The coffee is still just as good as the first time. 

The wifi is secured, they have a password with no time limit."}
{"text":"Some of the best coffee I've ever had. I like that drinks come in bigger sizes. Glad it's close to the house."}
{"text":"Swanky coffee shop from the Northwest (Portland) sets up home in the East Valley. Verdict: Tasty beverages for sitting and staying or getting and going. 

What Black Rock Coffee Bar (BRCB) boasts is a fun and lively caffeinated drink experience. From the Black Rock classics with any number of espresso shots (the Fuel has six!), to their sweet chillers with hardly any coffee taste at all, the menu offers something for everyone. Many drinks even have sugar free options. 

I've tried and enjoyed the Carmel Blonde, a sweetened coffee drink, and one of their most popular. You can order it blended, iced, or hot. I particularly liked the Mexican Mocha with its cinnamon kick. Get it served on ice with whipped cream, and you've got a dessert in a drink perfect for summer. 

Both the drink style and customer service remind me very much of other Northwest-based coffee parlors. The staff is friendly with a young and overall hip vibe. When we sat inside, they had a fairly upbeat mix of hip hop going, which gives the place an energetic atmosphere, but not necessarily one for reading or studying. The drive-thru has a similar feel, with baristas willing to chat it up and not just sling coffee at you in order to keep the line moving. There's a neat open patio setup, couches on the inside, and several tables for different sized groups. High ceilings and lots of space as well. I recommend that they add an extra outlet or two for people to plug in and work awhile. 

Overall, BRCB has a cool thing going for itself and the drive-thru is a necessity for Gilbert folks. They've only been open a few weeks, so go check em out!"}
{"text":"Amazing coffee. If you want legit coffee check this place out. My wife is a bit of a coffee snob and loves this place."}
{"text":"Very nice place with extremely friendly staff. Drive through or walk in. And of course coffee is great all the time!"}
{"text":"Really good vibe. Coffee is really good. They have some options that are lower in sugar. They are very patient and nice people that work there. Pricing is average for a specialty coffee place. I don't think it's out of line. The donuts where a little high priced. Other than that. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"OBSESSED. Been coming here since they opened and I've gone almost every day. Instantly became my new regular coffee spot, replacing Starbucks.

I had heard tons of hype about the location that had opened in Chandler, so I was super excited to try this location which is super close to me.

Coffee: Fantastic, and for a good price (cheaper than Starbucks). My favorites are the Irish and their iced lavender latte, soooo good! 

Service: The workers are incredibly friendly with great customer service, and it's nice having a chat with them every day in the drive thru when I get my coffee. Awesome staff! 

Indoors: Super cute and modern decor, comfortable seating and nice relaxing and chill vibe. They have some great merchandise for sale too. 

I've never fallen in love with a coffee shop so fast before!"}
{"text":"One of the best coffee spots in AZ! Great drinks, great prices and extremely friendly staff that are always happy to serve you some fantastic coffee."}
{"text":"Black Rock is really awesome when it comes to the design of the shop! With the wood walls and the concrete floor it is every hipsters favorite hang out. 

The Wifi is actually pretty fast as well, if you need to get some homework done and need a place to turn that last minute paper in, I would recommend doing it here at Black Rock.

I got the White Mocha and it was alright. There could have been a little bit more whip cream. But the temperature was spot on. Not to hot, I'm not a big fan of burning my taste buds. 

They do need to get some sort of fly trap though. The front door is a big garage door they open. They have a big fan that blows to keep flies out. But, they are still getting in. And they are ANNOYING. I'm sitting here writing this swatting them off me and my coffee. 

All in all if you are looking for a decent cup of coffee and some fast internet, I would recommend this place. If you hate flys I would go through the drive through."}
{"text":"Best Coffee in Town!  The staff is friendly and they have a wide variety of coffee and flavoring which is hard to find.  There nitro cold brew is off the charts.  I go to Black Rock quite a bit and always get the nitro cold brew with chocolate macadamia nut flavoring.  Oh Man!  So Good.  So next time when you are driving down the street and need a coffee pass up that Starbucks on the corner and make your way to Black Rock!

{"text":"Friendly fast service with some great tasting coffee! I guess they will have breakfast sandwiches coming soon. Can't wait for that."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere for getting work/study done. I've only tried the Mexican mocha so far but it was so good the first time that's all I wanted to order since! Even though it's technically a chain it has the feel of a much smaller local coffee shop."}
{"text":"Guest Service needs some work. I tried to order a couple of iced espressos priced at $4.10 each, and was told that their espresso machine is broken. I was offered a small sample of a cold brew instead, as they suggested I could get that instead. It's not as good as what I wanted, but acceptable. They tell me the cost of 2 drinks will be $14.85! I said 'I thought the drinks were around $8?' They tell me that there's an up charge for the cold brews. Oh, I see, so the cold brews I didn't want, and was only taking because their machine was not working...? I foolishly expected that since they were not able to provide what I actually wanted that I would be given the other product for the same price, or at a minimum, that they would have suggested an alternative option that was closer to the same price. Having worked in guest service myself, I would have only charged the guest the amount they were willing to pay for what they actually wanted, and not forced them to pay more for something they didn't want because I couldn't actually give them what they want. Maybe that's just me... so I ended up getting coffee at McDonald's instead. Yippee for me."}
{"text":"I usually stick with the caramel blondie but the peach green tea is also really great!"}
{"text":"Great 1st experience and coffee at Black Rock Yesterday. My wife and I both had a skinny, caramal blondie chiller. Hit the spot on another hot a$$ day in the valley. Service at the counter was very friendly and fast. They had a bunch of people working which I imagine gives them some quality customer service and order times. We had our 1.5 year old with us and didn't feel too intrusive or loud. It is a nice, open space that is family friendly. I would say we were outnumbered though, as the crowd was mostly business/laptop savvy. It is great to have another solid coffee shop on the east side. Oh, and they have a drive thru! Huge bonus!"}
{"text":"A wonderful coffee shop has opened in Mesa/Gilbert Area!! Great coffee...great service! My Drive-thru experience was was superb. Also, it is the ONLY coffee house in the EV that offers lattes and espresso with lavender (my favorite) Yuusss!! Another plus, my husband hates Starbucks and would never go with me and ever since I introduced him to BR is always asking me if I'll ne going so he can join me. :)"}
{"text":"Super friendly staff! Not all coffee's are the same. Black Rock does coffee right. Love they have bold drip throughout the day! Even the white chocolate mocha is delicious without that odd aftertaste some \"other\" coffee cafe's do. 5 stars for Staff & coffee. Wish they had more variety of snacks!"}
{"text":"Since I stopped putting sugar in my coffee, I'm relying on the beans and brew to be the Hall and Oates blue-eyed soul of my morning cup.  Fancy mocha choca latte nonsense? I CAN'T GO FOR THAT!  So, those straight-up grounds better come through.  Black Rock Coffee Bar produced a solid cup.  It wasn't over-roasted or bitter, like a certain chain, which despite my diminishing satisfaction with I'm programmed to go to a couple times a week.  Black Rock Coffee Bar was a cool place that was like walking into a TV show.  It was a perfect little package, checking all the boxes of a hipster establishment that will need to reinvent itself once the fad passes, but for now hits that zeitgeist, circa 2014-20??.  I mean let me run through some features. Garage door entrance, check.  Edison style light bulbs, check.  Mid-century inspired modern furniture pieces, check.  Some reclaimed wood, or maybe faux wood, check.  Photo app editing font on the wall, meant to inspire, while keeping the coffee theme, check.  Plenty of black clothing donned by the staff, check.  Fall Out Boy blasting on the speakers, Fall Out Boy?, well, okay, check.   All this made to be Instagrammed, so you can let your friends know the cool places you go for coffee, check.  I mean, seriously, the designer wrote an equation, and solved for X.  Now, I know this review may come across as mocking, but no, I appreciated this place, seriously.  It was just...pretty.  It beats the chain places though, and isn't that what any independent place should do.  These guys just built a better mouse trap.  Look, I'm from the 90s, when cafe culture almost meant something, and it was organic.  These kids today, I'll give them credit though, so please don't take this the wrong way.  Plus, if I didn't like it, I wouldn't spend this much time on the review.  The staff seemed friendly enough, there were smiles and laughs, and I liked that.  So, in closing, I'll sum it up again.  A solid cup of coffee.  Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Eh....my salted caramel cold brew tasted very bland....kinda like water. Nothing amazing. My wife's latte was very good, but nothing to drive out of our way for. May try again if we are in the area. 

Customer service and speed was a 5!"}
{"text":"My parents have been raving about this place. So we skipped Starbucks. 
They have done a fantastic job with this place. It looks awesome! 
I got a cold brew, the hubs got a black coffee, we got the kids half a dozen donut holes, and a blueberry muffin. +$3 tip =$16. 
The Valley should be proud to have this locally owned business! 
We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Best coffee in town! I used to go here all the time after school and they have the bEst irish creme! The employees are so nice and I love that they remember me every time! This coffee is so good that I even will go so many miles out of my way and wake up even earlier before school starts to get some. I can't remember the really nice employee's name but she had brown hair and was super sweet! 
They always make my coffee so FAST which is really nice. Fastest drive-thru in queen creek (gilbert? mesa? queen creek?)."}
{"text":"Bookmarked Black Rock before my trip out to watch spring training and this place did not disappoint. Located on the corner of a pretty busy street with a huge area for indoor seating, outdoor seating and a drive through. The menu was simple and easy enough to read but the baristas are also super patient and able to answer any questions we had. I tried their caramel truffle coffee iced with soy milk and it was divine. Would highly recommend stopping by for great coffee and a cute little spot to hang out."}
{"text":"Blows Starbucks out of the water. Drive thru is quick, staff is always friendly, coffee is amazing, and they give our dog a cup of whipped cream with a treat in it. You'll be addicted!"}
{"text":"It was a treat to discover this location on our way to Queen Creek.  I love the open concept.  You can enjoy the great weather when the shop has the large garage door open.  I ordered a small Blackout (hazelnut mocha) and my husband (who only ever orders specialty drinks at Black Rock) got a Jackhammer.  Neither drink was overly sweet, but they both packed a caffeine punch and were smooth and creamy.  You can purchase their specialty coffee beans as well as other swag from Black Rock.  I've loved this place since I discovered them in Portland a few years ago. It's pretty great that I don't have to fly 3 hours for it anymore."}
{"text":"Tried this place today at the recommendation of my sister! Love the decor, it's comfy, yet chic, and modern at the same time. I tried the jackhammer and it was perfect. Nice and strong. The lovely ladies behind the counter are so friendly! Even though it's about a 15 min drive from my house I'll definitely be making this my regular spot!"}
{"text":"Love this coffee shop! Always super friendly staff. Order is alway correct. Coffee flavors is amazing!"}
{"text":"Coffee is great, people are super nice, and the atmosphere is adorable, will definitely come back. And they have some rocking smoothies."}
{"text":"By far my favorite coffee shop! Staff is so friendly and always give me recommendations. One I highly recommend that isn't on their menu is called \"White Out\" not sure what all is in it, but if you like a caramel macchiato from Starbucks you will love the White Out. 

Definitely go here, you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"We have tried nearly all the Chiller drinks as well as the hot chocolate and all are very good. The ambience is inviting and knotty --lol--(show up, you'll get it!). It's not that Seattle brand which is over played and over exposed. We like this place and their products."}
{"text":"Great coffee, great staff, great merchandise, great furniture, great aesthetic, great bathroom lights... You get the picture!

I'm glad this location is only 13 min away from me because I definitely want to come back!!! There were so many flavors and options I wanted to try, but I'd jumped straight to the Fuel for a long long day of studying--and LONG day it was. 6 shots across ALL SIZES! This is a graduate student's dream come true I tell ya. Next time I think I want to try something with lavender! Perhaps an Italian ice or a lemonade!!! 

Only thing I'd make note of that wasn't great (although not bad at all)- the music seemed to be really loud at times?? I don't usually notice since I work with headphones on, but I heard it really clearly at times, particularly when it got CROWDED (Friday around 3-4ish). If you're trying to study and you can't in a loud environment, this might not be your place. But def check out the beverages! I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I am obsessed with this place. I am SO happy they are so close to my home and their coffee is delicious. I usually get the iced hazelnut mocha and I LOVE it. Their dark coffee is also delicious and it doesn't have an acidic taste. The staff is also super friendly. They also offer a punch card, buy 10 get 1 free AND a drive thru which makes my mornings a little less chaotic :). Definitely will be going here instead of Starbucks."}
{"text":"One of my favourite coffee joints. Strong coffee. Usually get the jackhammer with almond milk. Keeps me awake throughout my whole 12 hr nightshift! Great staff. Has a drivethrough."}
{"text":"Coffee is just alright for the price. No roasts for pour overs. Bummer. But happenin' place. A little to loud for me to chat. Even with big door open. Service was friendly and ambience is cool. A little dirty though cause it's so busy. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"My favorite coffee place EVER!!! Their drinks are great, and their customer service is incredible. They are always super friendly and always consistent (which my A Type Personality loves). Some of my favorites are their flavored energy drinks, and a jackhammer. Also, they have a great selection for kiddos. My daughter gets a smoothie (in the cutest cup) every time we go there!!"}
{"text":"This is some of the best tasting coffee I have had! My first time going they gave me some suggestions based on my preferences and each time I have ordered the same drink since it's delicious! The drive thru moves quickly and the employees are super friendly without being obnoxious like some other places I've been to."}
{"text":"Great coffee and super friendly staff, but service is really slow! Don't try coming here before work unless you have at least 1/2 an hour to spare! I just spent 30 minutes in the drive thru."}
{"text":"Great coffee and fun vibe for the location. Nice to see young faces interacting with the locals and giving great service. It is obvious the staff likes what they do. And they have a drive thru which is very convenient when I have my daughter with me!"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of the coffee at Black Rock, but I will never be going back because the incredibly rude customer service. I go to EVIT cosmetology on Power road so i alway stop by and grab a drink before. I had called today at around 11:15 and asked politely a question about my account I had set up in the system. A female answered the phone and after I asked my question she replied so rudely and then hung up on me! I have never experienced such disrespect from a worker especially when I was trying to be very kind and polite. My cosmetology friends and I are usual customers  but unfortunately we will never be returning."}
{"text":"Today I ordered a drink with \"half flavor\" because some of the drinks are on the sweeter side for me... unfortunately I ended up not liking it as much! I asked the barista if she could just add the other half (thinking it was syrup pumps), but she insisted on remaking it and said it wouldn't taste the same because that particular drink used powder instead of syrup. I felt terrible about wasting the first drink since it was due to my own bad judgement, but she ensured me it was fine and clearly just wanted me to be happy with my drink. And the remake was just perfect. Always amazing customer service here."}
{"text":"The coffee is great... the red bull drinks are amazing and service is fantastic!  I've been a loyal customer for several months and would not go anywhere else.  Go Black Rock!"}
{"text":"Happened upon this place while I was waiting for my fiancé to get his haircut at the Sports Clips next door. What a pleasant find!

Very modern and sleek interior with plenty of seating. They have large and small tables as well as a few couches and plush chairs to hang out in. I got one of their drip coffees and it was delicious!

I will definitely be coming back to relax and do school work or to meet a friend for a coffee. 

They even have a drive thru."}
{"text":"Staff always in a great mood, real nice atmosphere- excellent beverages, quick service.  chai chiller is my go to"}
{"text":"The espresso here is amazing! A Latte requires no sweetener. It's perfect with just almond milk! I've deleted my Starbucks app because I will never drink coffee anywhere else! And bonus.. you'll experience a real caffeine bump!"}
{"text":"Friendly service, good coffee. But I thought you were suppose to be able to talk to people in a coffee shop. The music is so loud sometimes it's ridiculous."}
{"text":"My new favorite place for coffee!  Coffee always is consistent in taste!  Never burnt!  Cozy inside if you want to relax and drink your specialty drink.  Very friendly baristas too!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places in Arizona! When you walk through that door the first thing that grabs your attention is the amazing wood wall and cool light fixtures! They have the best customer service that I have ever experienced!! Their staff are the best!!!
Plus the menu is killer!! Great options! 
I'm from Vancouver Canada and it feels like home when I go in there! West coast vibe! With super friendly people!!! Love it"}
{"text":"Love it! Great coffee. Great personalities. Fun atmosphere, not too loud like so many places. The drinks are so much better than Dutch Bros, and without the annoying teeny boppers that try to get weirdly invasive into your happenings."}
{"text":"Wasn't the best coffee place in the area, that's for sure. Barista asked if I wanted whipped cream on an Americano..."}
{"text":"Cute little coffee shop. Long line at the drive thru so we ran in real quick. Didn't take too long to get our coffee! We had the iced Mexican Mocha (tasted like cinnamon toast crunch cereal) it was amazing. We also had the iced Caramel Blondie as recommended by a lot of people on Yelp. Both were great and we will be back!"}
{"text":"I'm not a big coffee drinker but this place is fantastic. The staff is super friendly, the ambiance in the shop is spot on and the drinks are delicious. I ordered a Carmel blondie and my son had a strawberry banana smoothie. The only thing I wasn't impressed by was the banana nut muffin, kind of tasteless and dry. We will be going back though when we are out that way. Wish they had one in Queen Creek."}
{"text":"The Coffee is _fine_. The rest of the drinks are *Fun* (my wife loves them). The services and atmosphere is great. Like a slightly more mature Dutch Bros with a place to sit inside."}
{"text":"I have tried this place multiple times and have had a great experience each time.  Every coffee I have tried has been great!  I prefer this over Starbucks any day.  Good service, great coffee, and fast drive-thru."}
{"text":"Awesome, friendly customer service!! I love supporting businesses where people love their job! I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times and unfortunately it has been extremely inconsistent. Tried speaking with the manager But she was basically a witch. Was hoping to be my place especially with all the good reviews but I guess the attitudes and inconsistency starts at the top."}
{"text":"I recently have just switched from my usual Starbucks & Dutch Bros to Black Rock Coffee and so far my fiancé and I are pretty impressed and pleased. We love how they make their coffee I like mine not too strong and they make theirs just right, Caramel Blondie Blended is our favorite we also get smoothies from there for my son and ourselves and we love all their flavors from Mango, Strawberry Banana, and Green apple. YUM!!! 

Recently my fiancé had ordered me a strawberry banana from black rock and the sweet girl at the drive thru was sweet enough to give us credit for our purchase from before because they had forgotten to ask for our number for our loyalty though she didn't have to it was our fault to for not mentioning. Anyways when I got my smoothie it was looking watered down and almost like a slushee and not like a smoothie, so my fiancé had taken it back in and explained to them why we couldn't take it and with no questions he said someone got right on it and made us an entirely new smoothie and it was 110% better tasting and looking. I was not at all upset I just figured they might have been really busy and was making it in a rush, but both my fiancé and I were very pleased at how the staff handled it in such a pleasant manner. We will ALWAYS be a fan/supporter of Black Rock Coffee."}
{"text":"Stopped into Black Rock Coffee Bar a few times while on a weekend visit in Gilbert. 

Used the drive through twice and service was fast, friendly and the coffee was REALLY good! 

The inside seating area also looked adorable, we just were always on the run when we stopped."}
{"text":"First time trying BR. Decided to go with the iced Carmel Blondie. It is absolutely fantastic, you definitely can't go wrong with this. Atmosphere is awesome as well!"}
{"text":"This place is very modern, and cute, a great place to study and meet up with friends. The muffins are great and the tea is good as well. Highly recommend this place, has such a great vibe"}
{"text":"Did someone say coffee!??? This is my new favorite coffee place when I am out and about. The decor is chic and trendy. The employees are very pleasant and rock it! The Manager Bobby returned my call immediately. Spoke with him about sponsoring our softball team to promote the coffee shop and he pulled through. Thank you Black Rock Coffee! So glad we have this in the Valley."}
{"text":"Love this place! Super friendly & helpful baristas are awesome!!! Just gotta have my iced Carmel blondie whenever I can get it!!!"}
{"text":"Checked this out after reading some reviews on yelp.  Very open and airy, and no distractions from products that they're trying to sell on the walls and on end caps. couple of large tables, and then some smaller tables. Probably a little more for the younger crowd. The music was OK, rather basie , and may be a little loud. But, hey, I'm 55, so I'm probably a little bit of a Curmudgeon. I took my daughter for a little daddy daughter date, and she got a rockstar berry smoothie something. No rockstar, cause I don't want her climbing the walls. It was the bomb, as the young people say.  I have some Kinda caramel coffee drink, pretty good. I generally don't get those because they're a little sweet for my taste, but I thought I'd try it out. It was good. Overall I give this u 4 rating for ambience, service, and quality. I'll be coming back, because my kids like it. And I liked it too. Also, it does have a drive-through. Check it out for yourself."}
{"text":"Really great coffee! I never ever drink black coffee but I'm trying out Whole30 so I got an Americano  black and really enjoyed it.  I was shocked. My whole life has been a lie!  It just shows me that when you have truly GOOD coffee, you don't need a bunch of fillers. The staff was so genuinely friendly and helpful.  I just wish this place was on my way to work. It'll be a weekend treat instead!"}
{"text":"This place rocks! Not only is their coffee great, the customer service is always top notch. Super-friendly staff every time I'm in there. Not all places are like this. Usually you find one or two people at your regular coffee spot that are friendly. This place has an amazing staff that is consistently friendly and keeps me coming back in."}
{"text":"The coffee here is sooo good! People are super helpful at the location especially since it was my first time going in! The atmosphere is super relaxing and a perfect spot to get work or studying done. I will definitely be back and dragging my friends along with me."}
{"text":"Love BRCB. Ran into them in Idaho and have loved them ever since! I highly recommend any drink. They're all good. Their snacks are solid too. Compared to Dutch, I sometimes prefer BRCB. But overall, great to have both!"}
{"text":"First time here and definitely not the last. I love the ambiance and service. Everyone was extremely friendly and happy even though they were super swamped. I tried the iced breve and it is amazing if you like creamy yet bold coffee. Thank you guys for making our first experience AMAZING. You guys #ROCK."}
{"text":"Tried Black Rock Coffee Bar today for the first time and was impressed. Got my usual coffee order- Iced Vanilla Latte. Not overly sweet and actually tasted like coffee which is a win for me."}
{"text":"Good spot, Rockstar Smoothies actually have rockstar in them. Holy hell."}
{"text":"Love this place! The coffee is smooth and tasty. The customer service is OUTSTANDING. Everyone is super friendly. The friendliness alone puts this place above most anywhere else. The rewards program is easy and hassle free. My favorite new place for coffee. Hands down better than Starbucks. If you love coffee and looking for a change, try this place! You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"I tried their drive thru for the first time.  I got an Oreo Chiller and enjoyed it.  There is a sidewalk between the window and your car so I had to open my door which was weird.  I would definitely go back to sit down and have a hot coffee on a cool morning."}
{"text":"Good coffee but the drive thru line is always so long BECAUSE THEY TURN THE BOX OFF. In what world does it make sense to have everyone pull up to the window and order at a drive thru?? I will never be going back. They lose so much business from that line, I've seen people just look at the long line and leave the parking lot. Not worth the wait for Starbucks price drinks when I can go to Starbucks and be in and out in the time I move one car in this line. Also manager is never in to discuss this with--some business practice that is!"}
{"text":"Love the coffee and the staff! The wife and Iare always looking for a new coffee spot... and this is perfect! Great atmosphere, genuine people behind the counter and amazing espresso drinks!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I was in your coffee house Saturday 01/27/18 about 5:30a .  We did some photos of Fuel Your Story sign  that we will not be using because of the poor experience we had. 

We ordered Italian Soda /  Strawberry , Bagel and Hot Caramel Truffle. 
It took over 20 minutes for us to get the order, when we did get it.  There was an hair in the Hot Caramel Truffle.   I did return to get a full refund and will not be returning to the coffee bar."}
{"text":"This place has THE BEST coffee hands down!! All of the staff are consistently amazing souled people. My happy spot!"}
{"text":"Really enjoying this place. Overall the staff has been very friendly and the drinks are awesome. My favorite is the Mexican Mocha. It's so good I think about it daily. They also have a nice selection of non-coffee drinks for the kiddos and a drive thru so I don't have to get out of my car before I've had any coffee!"}
{"text":"When I first came here I thought this was literally the best coffee in the Mesa Gilbert area. Their espresso was of clearly high quality and taste was phenomenal! The past couple times I've been here the place has gotten more popular and it seems as if their quality has decreased. The sharp taste of espresso is gone, and I'm left with subpar quality. I hope they bring their quality back up because this spot was a gem!"}
{"text":"Walked in for the first time and what a chill vibe. Nice and open makes for a perfect collaborating place. A huge table in the front for teams. The menu is super simple which is great for a non coffee connoisseur. However quality you can fast for those who are picky about their bean. 

The staff was super helpful unlike some mermaid invested places we all know.  I personally love the mom and pop feel. 

Definitely a new favorite place. And coming back."}
{"text":"Yet another of the unmistakable and recognizably hipster-esque chain coffee bars within the state. They offer a range of products from both the caffeinated and decaffeinated spectrums. The drinks that I have had here are not all that special; and in truth, I would be capable of receiving the same combination and quality at any other coffee chain I stopped at on my way to run errands.The price range of this establishment also runs in the same vain as any other Dutch Brothers-esque chain. The simple truth is that this is on the way to where I need to go and the coffee isn't all that bad; at the same it's nothing special."}
{"text":"Their drinks seem to be really sweet with so much cream that it over powers the coffee taste. As for the black coffee (both medium and dark roast) there seems to be a bitter undertone that can be tasted on each sip. It's okay in a pinch on a busy day, but not where I'd go to enjoy the ambience and flavor of a nicely roasted bean."}
{"text":"Cute coffee shop! Friendly service! As I pondered what kind of latte I wanted, the guy behind the desk (not the girl serving me), jumped over and said, \"salted caramel\"... so, I went with that. Half decaf, and with almond milk... it was delicious. The front of the coffee shop has a big garage door that they open up. Some couches and comfy chairs near the back. Very cool shop... we will be back! :)"}
{"text":"First visit today and it was amazing! Had a Carmel Blonde and it was fantastic! Glad they opened in my neighborhood and I will be a frequent visitor."}
{"text":"So yummy! The caramel blondie coffee is delicious I'd say way better than Starbucks! Starbucks coffee always gives me a weird taste & after taste. I found out STARBUCKS have GMO in them to so that's where my headaches came from but saw this place & WOW! Delicious! I order caramel blondie frap & a blueberry bagel! ITS DELICIOUS & I WANTED MORE! Dan took my order & we talked like we were friends! Love the atmosphere & the people! They're so welcoming! I'll bring my family & friends to this spot!"}
{"text":"Simply delicious and excellent customer service. They even gave me a free coffee, any size on my birthday. Need I say more."}
{"text":"Black Rock Coffee has the coolest vibe inside. When you walk inside you'll be met with a cool industrial Edison vibe. Surprised if you don't immediately feel cooler coming in here. This is the kind of place you'd want to take Instagram pictures at, design a website or start a tech company from. Very excited about the atmosphere here. 

The menu seemed to have the clsssics, Carmel blondie, americano, white mocha. So you'll probably find something you'd want. I went at 11:30am so I just wanted something delicious and cold. I tried one of their chillers. I got the chocolate chip one and it's got a decent flavor. I asked for almond milk and I think they use the same watery non refrigerated almond milk my nana jennie uses. The chocolate chip flavor was over powered by the watery almond milk and a flood of memories came back of pulling weeds at my nana's house in New Mexico. I'm not super pissed I spent $5.35 cents on this drink but I wouldn't get it again. 

I live really close to this place and would come back just for the vibe but wouldn't be rushing to the counter to get a chiller. It could be better with whole milk. My brother who came with me got a hot white mocha and he gave it a 4 stars. So come at least feel the vibe in this place and try a drink. Who knows you could fall in love with just more than the atmosphere of you come. 

Girl that took my order was very sweet and friendly. She answered all my questions and didn't make me feel dumb. Friendly staff! The atmosphere here earned the 3 stars not the drinks."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. The drinks are delicious, the environment is relaxing, but the employees are what make my visits enjoyable. They're always so friendly ! The customer service here is outstanding, I love how they always have smiles on their faces and are happy to help when it comes to making a drink a certain way or asking for an extra napkin."}
