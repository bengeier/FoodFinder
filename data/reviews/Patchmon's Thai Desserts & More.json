{"text":"If you are ever craving or ever want to try authentic Thai desserts give Patchmon's Thai desserts a try! They are the closest to being the authentic Thai desserts you will find in Thailand. They have very amazing variety which changes almost every week.   These Thai desserts are not your typical desserts. Almost all of them are steamed and are made from coconut/milk/egg. They are not similar to any other desserts and you certainly cannot find these in any local market.. nothing can beat a freshly homemade Thai dessert and I believe this is the only place in GTA that offers that!  I personally have never been to the store itself (they were kind enough to deliver them to me and both times were during the weekends.) They do not do regular delivery but I think on some days at certain times they may be able to deliver at certain subway stations or somewhere nearby to them. The owners are very friendly and very passionate about what they are doing.   I'm happy to know there is a store that I can rely on if I ever crave Thai desserts ever again :)"}
{"text":"This is my fav dessert place now . The service is amazing and food is to die for . Let me warn you it's very addictive . Only takes cash though"}
{"text":"My mother grew up in Thailand so I was excited to have discovered this place. I bought $60 worth of desert and other goodies. Some of the desert tasted okay while others weren't that great. Overall it's nothing to write home about. The store was small but clean and tidy and the customer service was excellent. They only accepted cash when I was there. Have not tried their savoury menu."}
{"text":"This small little job is super unique in the area. Specially daily made thai desserts makes a great little addition to a small gathering.   They only open Wed to Sat. I found out the hard way. I finally made it in here yesterday. Cash only.   They encourage you to try all the different flavours and desserts before you buy. Which is nice if you don't know what you're buying. Each box is of about 7-8 pcs are about $7, but you can mix and match. It's harder for the cookies and savouries because they don't make it every day.   There is a rice gummy in the shape of a flower, a fresh pureed banana in a leaf, coconut milk (refrigerated), taro pudding (refrigerated), savoury cookies one with spices and one with mackerel, cassava cake with coconut.   Also try the thai curry flaky pocket for $2. It was really yummy.   They also have some desserts you can order online which is made fresh to order, that is made out of egg yoke.   I also found out that they supply the desserts for some thai restaurants in the area (which is what they are doing on Mon/Tues)."}
{"text":"Five years ago, I asked myself a question, \"where can one try Thai dessert in Toronto?\"  Second questioned popped to my mind was, what was Thai dessert?  That's when I realize the sad truth which turned out to be happy discovery.  There was this little 2nd floor office that my Thai friend took me that had desserts on weekends, and it wasn't a restaurant serving Mango Sticky Rice {as much as I love it}.  The colors and flavours were both a kaleidoscope to my senses.  Four years ago, I found myself in Thailand and as it turns out I didn't have Thai dessert in a restaurant either but some street vendor on wheels.  My Thai dessert horizons expands.  Coming back to Toronto contracted my horizons once again but at the same time more unique authentic Thai restaurants appeared providing a minimal glimpse of hope.  To this day, Toronto is still a sad wasteland for Thai desserts so by now you should guess my justified bias for Patchmon's Thai Dessert.  Most of the desserts they offered while I was at the small shop was coconut heavy, gelatinous, or flaky.  The menu was surprisingly big in my opinion which is a good thing for customers and along with Thai friendly customs, they may make your special request items {I believe they said if you go on facebook} but you'll have to contact them."}
{"text":"Step through their doors and you'll find yourself in a magical place where exotic spices and ingredients are combined masterfully to create beautiful and delightful desserts.  Family run establishment where mom (Patchmon) runs the kitchen, sweet daughter runs the front and dad runs between the two areas to help. Aleen, the daughter, is a perfect ambassador for Thai culture. She can give you a lesson on how the desserts are created and the different cultural influences that make up Thai cuisine.  ORDERED: - Chicken over rice: chicken was tender but bland. The accompanying sauce is an explosion of flavors: gingery with spices that leave a nice tingle on your tongue. - Winter melon soup (accompanying side) was simple and mild in taste, but a warm comforting soup with large chunks of winter melon.  - Curry puff had a nice, crunchy exterior with a mild curry filling. - Thai iced tea was delicious and not overly sweet: a perfect compliment to any Thai meal. - Pineapple cookie reminded me of a fig newton with a more crumbly exterior.  I thoroughly enjoyed my Thai experience and can't wait to sample more of their culinary creations."}
{"text":"I am Thai and I love Patchmon's dessert. Everything is very authentic and yummy... some of the desserts here tastes even better than in Thailand... Thanks Patchmon for making me feel like I am home. I no longer miss Thai desserts now that I found this place. It is even better that Patchmon has expanded to offer Thai food at lunch time as well. I hope she can expand our culture and our food more and more"}
{"text":"The desserts here are very authentic. There's a variety of coconut based jelly desserts and some with sticky rice. I'm not as familiar with the names of them but they were are definitely very tasty. It's a bit out of the way, but if you're in the area, it's worth checking out if you like Thai cuisine."}
{"text":"My friend told me that I must try this place and I popped by today.   I have to say after today, this is my favorite dessert place.  I have egg and dairy allergy, as well as gluten sensitivity. Yet most gluten free vegan desserts offered in the market are filled with tons of processed ingredients and sugars.  Patchmont Thai Dessert is the best, I appreciate their fresh and natural ingredients. Their variety of vegan and gluten free steamed desserts reminds me of South East Asia...very fragrant. Not too sweet.  Oh..their curry puffs are mouthwatering delicious, it is not gluten free but is vegan.   Must try!!"}
{"text":"Authentic Thai dessert and friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Thai desserts are mostly made at the end of the week, so they're best from the beginning of the week to middle.  It's a charming location, with a fresh layout.  The people who work here are extremely helpful and passionate about their ready Thai treats.  The layer cake, steamed one layer at a time are fantastic, and their jasmine cakes are super flavorful.  Every day they have a few different rotating desserts on offer.  It's worth stopping in frequently."}
{"text":"Right outside of Jane Station, on Bloor Street, is a special little place that sells a dessert type that I don't think gets a whole lot of recognization but really should.  Thai Desserts.  Truth be told, for the amount of food places I've been to...this one was a new experience all around.    Entering into the shop, it's a tiny little shop with a couple tables on the right as well as a counter top, with an array of different Thai desserts...none of them I'm familiar with.  I had a sample of the one with Pandan in it, which was gelatinous but really subtle in sweetness and it was really tasty.  Another one, which I ended up buying was this Casava treat, again gelatinous, but the toasted coconut was really a nice compliment to the starchiness that is called Casava (I'm sorry for butchering the spelling for this).  I bought a Thai Iced Tea and I thought the Iced Tea was really really good in flavour and the nice orange-y colour when the milk and double steeped tea is mixed together but I thought it was 2 shades over on the sweet side.  Tone down the sugar level and I think you have a BIG winner right there.  I think they are only accept cash (I didn't see a credit card terminal machine) so ensure that you bring some cash.  I'm more than inclined to come back again and try the rest of what they have.  I'd encourage, at MINIMUM, you make a visit there.  It's unique, it's runned by people that are earnest, sweet and pleasant to be around, and plus they're desserts.  How do you refuse a dessert, hmm?"}
{"text":"Dropped by to check out this new Thai dessert place in our 'hood.    Super friendly staff encouraged us to sample almost every dessert they had to offer and we decided to get a small box of the coconut jelly cakes ($6).    Patchmon's is a lovely addition to the area that is densely populated with European baked goods.  When it comes to dessert, I'm a fan of every ethnic variety!"}
{"text":"If only people know how time consuming and everything has to be from scratch to make the authentic Thai desserts. Is also made to not only taste God, looks good and priced well enough. Patchmon has set and provided high standards for others as benchmark when it comes to Thai desserts in Toronto.  They're only open certain number of days and not everything is same on the menu everyday. Check on the Facebook or website."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. Their desserts are fresh, tasty, bite-sized and feature lots of coconut/tapioca. They're sold in these prepackaged boxes for around $6 but depending on the dessert, you can also get them in single portions I think. The owners are also super nice about letting you sample desserts if you're unsure.  My favourites: The sweet tapioca with coconut cream is fragrant and very unusual, with a sweet, textured tapioca base and some salty?! cream on top. The layers are interesting and the contrast in flavours is kinda reminiscent of salted caramel, but a lot less sweet. The coconut layers cake is colourful and shaped in flower patterns. It's a dense jelly and mildly sweet. If you prefer savoury treats, I recommend their fish cookies or spicy pork cookies (they're not that spicy).  Honestly the owners are so sweet and hospitable that I keep coming back... and of course their desserts are delicious. Definitely worth checking out! (but bring cash since they're cash only) Also if you have a specific dessert in mind, it's worth calling them or messaging them on Facebook beforehand so they can make it for you since they don't make all the desserts everyday. They also deliver along the Bloor subway line if your order is $30+."}
{"text":"You can learn a culture from their Desserts? Then come to Patchmon's Thai Dessert and More for a taste of \"Real\" Thailand and its People.  The 2 sweet shop owners just reminds me of the kindness and hospitality of Thai. A big smile, A warm welcome and one got to try every single dessert available that day!!   Just like other Asian desserts, nothing here is overly sweet. Some even has a balance of sweet and savory.   Come here on Saturdays if you want to try some authentic dessert that needs special preparation. And of course you can always pre order some for pick up!  For most up to date selections, check out their Facebook page.  Patchmon's though a little far for me, but if I willing to travel to Thailand to eat, I should be able to come to Patchmon's for some of their sweets!"}
