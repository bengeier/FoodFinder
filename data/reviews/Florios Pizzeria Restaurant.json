{"text":"Terrible restaurant, poor service and food! Our food was very late to come out and when it did it was stone cold and tasted awful. Visited here after reading good reviews. The place did not live up tp expectations. Poor wine choice, and drinks are served in a can without a glass... classy I must say. The place is so very dated and lacks atmosphere, it is full of teenagers making a lot of noise, not relaxing at all. Very old and boring decor and the toilets are also dated and un clean! Must say this is a terrible restaurant, if you can call it that! Highly dissapointed and would not recomend."}
{"text":"Got to say if you want to go out for a meal that's pleasing on the eye well this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Great food, especially the Calzone.
And if you go before 7pm you hit HAPPY HOUR.


 Make sure you ring ahead and book your table."}
{"text":"The best Italian restaurant ever!! The garlic bread can not be beaten. Good value for money and the food is all delicious. Only complaint is that at busy times they do tend to rush you through."}
{"text":"The food is cheap, but it isn't amazing.


 Its very noisy when busy and you really get crammed in. Also if a lot of people are there for birthday parties the celebration music that plays gets annoying quickly.


 The staff can also get a bit irritable when it's busy. One example was a party of 12 of us booked for a Friday night. At the last minute for unforeseen and unfortunate reasons one member of the group could not make it. It was ten minutes after our reservation time when we found out. Every two minutes of that time we were hassled by the staff asking if we still required the place as they were busy and needed it. Once we found out that we wouldn't the staff member was very 'narky' about it. He was an oldish chap and may have been the owner.


 For the price you pay you cant grumble but it wouldn't help if the staff were a bit more cheerful."}
{"text":"Awesome foot, yummy yum. Sooo good steaks and pasta. Massive portion. Defently very nice foot."}
{"text":"I have been here many times with friends. I can see what other people are saying about, when it is busy, things get rather hectic. However, I always seem to have a good time, there is nothing that I would say detracts too badly from the night out. On the few occasions that the staff have got stressed, we just let them get on with it for a while before asking for something when it calmed down. The food, on the whole is lovely, the tomato garlic bread is my favourite, I can't get enough. The pizzas are also nice. The prices are fine, taking into account the quality of food, and service, its not a really expensive meal out. Oh and if you're a fan of icecream, make sure you try the bubblegum flavour, its nice but beware, it turns your tongue blue!"}
{"text":"excellent food & service brilliant love this place :)"}
{"text":"Florios is an 'interesting' restaurant. By that, I mean that here are many good things about it, but also quite a few niggling little things which detract from the experience.


 The good - the food is generally very tasty. They serve traditional Italian fare - pizza, pasta etc, but also do a very nice line in steak and sauces etc. Service is usually good, but can suffer in busier times. The prices are reasonable, the decor gives you plenty to look at. Its very family oriented and does well at that.


 The bad - The waiting area consists of about six chairs in the doorway. Once they are full and people are coming through the door it gets crowded and hectic. For some reason, they sell soft drink in CANS. When I asked for a coke, I was handed (they didnt even pour and keep the can) a can of coke and a glass, which cost me Â£1.75 despite the can having 'multipack-45p' stamped on the side. The wine list is basic.


 Is it worth a visit? Yes, on the whole it is, but the little things detract from the experience which could make this place so much better."}
{"text":"this is a brilliant family friendly restaurant with great service and an excellent menu. they have a good happy hour deal but beware it gets really busy and its better to book!"}
{"text":"A nice Italian restaurant with very good prices.

I had the spaghetti marinara (mixed seafood), and was surprised at how big the portion was! not only did it come full in a big bowl, but it tasted really nice. The prawns were big and meaty and the other seafood were fresh.

After my main, I tried their chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream, with a cup of tea. A mighty good finish to the meal!

Definitely recommend this place if you want an Italian meal. It's very well priced, has good portions and friendly service, and if you go before 7pm, you get the happy hour price! Definitely puts Jaime's Italian to shame."}
{"text":"If you want a fine dining experience don't come here. If you want a relaxed, stress free, enjoyable meal with friends in a friendly environment then it's the place for you. I come here at least twice a month and have done for years. 
Happy hour is between 5-7 and pizza and pasta are half price. It is over run with families and small children and snap happy teenagers at these times.
I always have the fresh mussels when they are on they are fantastic. I find the staff very friendly and approachable and they will do anything to accommodate your wishes. 
The pasta I rarely eat as it is typical English Italian. I mean you will not find an Italian eating Carbonara with cream in it!
When I have pizza I find it very good and seldom have any complaints. The steaks are generally well cooked but sometimes when I ask for rare they have come out a little over cooked - but when I have mentioned this they have not charged me - so I cannot knock them for that.
The wine list is basic but the Montpulciano they use is excellent.
On the whole my favourite for atmosphere and friendliness."}
{"text":"I love this place and this week took some of my American friends here. They loved it! The food was fantastic (fresh mussels in garlic arrabiata) but there signature garlic bread with tomato is to die for.

There is an issue during holiday season where the noise level can get a bit rowdy, but this doesn't overwhelm the overall experience. 

Pricing is very reasonable and in fact its fair to say I have never had a bad meal there.

My American friends can be critical of English food and restaurants, but were very impressed with service and food quality.

This place is packed even on off days like Wednesdays, I would recommend this restaurant to anyone wanting Italian family type food for a very reasonable price."}
