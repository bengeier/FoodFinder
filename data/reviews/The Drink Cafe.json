{"text":"OK.....I seriously love this place.  Every Monday I go there for their burger night....IT IS AWESOME.  GOOD STUFF:  Great unpretentious bar in Lakewood with really good food, cheap beer specials, and solid bartenders (Dan is the best).  BAD STUFF:  Like all Lakewood bars, somewhat divey.  PRICE:  cheap.  Especially if you get their specials...every weekday with a different one and dollar pints during OSU or Cleveland sporting events.  OVERALL:  My absolute favorite bar in all of Cleveland.  If you want good bar food with cheap beer specials and a fairly quiet atmosphere check this place out....."}

{"text":"We came here for a friend's birthday night out last weekend.  I was pretty satisfied with my experience - enough people to keep the night interesting, but not too crowded.  Mostly a younger crowd, although I did spot some old creepers.  The staff was pretty friendly, and drinks were cheap.  I ran into some guys who were out for a bachelor party, and the one getting married explained they got kicked out of a strip club because he put pizza crust in a girl's thong.  I retold this story several times throughout the night.  Negatives:   - I tried to get a tequila sunrise, and the woman behind the bar showed me that their orange juice is coming out BROWN.  She said it still tastes fine but is discolored.  Ick, no thanks.  - The girls bathroom door on the right does not lock.  I walked in on a girl going to the bathroom, only to step back and then witness another girl puke into the sink.  Not an enjoyable part of my night.  Positives  - Their soap smells delicious.  I wanted to eat my hands every time I returned from the bathroom.  - Cheap! It's rare that I get my tab and the end of the night after drinking for hours and say \"Oh, that's it?\"  Definitely a nice way to end the night though."}
{"text":"Yelp Zompie Pub Crawl stop 1 for me(there had been one bar i missed). What a treat this place was! Lots of gleaming wood decor, a cool juke, not too many plasmas, a dashing bartender, and great beer choices. I would not describe this place as divey at all(quit throwing that word around people!). I think i had a Boddingtons for around six bucks. Steepish, but a tall pour.   Very mature vibe(compared to the west end of Lakewood), but not an old man bar. The bartender even joined us outside for a smoke and was a pleasure to talk to. Probably could have stayed there for one more instead of moving on to the Gutter(aaaaaaahhhh...stop 2!)"}
