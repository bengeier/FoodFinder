{"text":"First timer..Ordered a large 12 cut. Pizza tastes great but it was tiny... They made a 6 cut size into a 12 with the skinny slice method.  I need more food, it's the playoffs."}
{"text":"First timer...so glad we stopped...best pizza around...thin crust..crispy..spicy sauce...high quality ingredients...we got a large traditional pepperoni with mushroom...hidden gem in this area...really reasonable pricing...fast service! We will be returning!!"}
{"text":"Everything they make is Delicious. Dough and sauce for pizza, calzones,Stromboli and breadsticks is made fresh. Sandwiches are great too. Owner very nice also. Eat there almost every week."}
{"text":"Amili's is very underrated.  I usually get the Buffalo Chicken hoagie or a pizza.  The Buffalo Chicken hoagie is just the way I like it - spicy and flavorful.  The pizza especially the sauce is very good.  The managers running the place are very friendly.  Check this place out."}
{"text":"Worst experience from a pizza place I have ever had.  So much for branching out and trying new places.   We ordered a large pizza, wings, & breadsticks. We were told it would arrive within 40-50 minutes. We only live 1 mile from the place.   1 1/2 hours later I called to see what was going on and was told the driver left 10-15 minutes ago. The person I spoke to on the phone was not helpful and didn't really seem to care that we had been waiting so long for our dinner.   When our food finally did arrive they were missing the breadsticks and extra marinara. The food tasted absolutely TERRIBLE. The pizza wasn't even cut all the way through.   Not worth the wait."}
{"text":"I ordered a Hot Sausage Hoagie and chicken tenders  from them today at 2:56 didn't receive my food until 4:56. Two hours me.The hot sausage was disgusting. I'm done ordering from them for awhile"}
{"text":"Food was way over cooked and quite bland. The white pizza we ordered might as well have been cardboard."}
{"text":"Living in the South Side, there are plenty of pizza options near us. Recently, we've been trying different places just to mix it up, especially because the last few times we've ordered from our usual pizza place it hasn't been up to par.   We decided to go with Amili's because it's not only close by, but because they had a great deal (large two topping pizza, Italian hoagie, breadsticks and a bottle of Coke). We also had an ad from them in our takeout folder that we accumulated somehow.   I was pleased from the start when I called and the man who took my order was very friendly. No hassle and took the time to make sure the order was correct.   We picked it up and it was ready within 20 minutes as promised. The pizza was awesome! It was cooked perfectly and had a nice balance of sauce and cheese. My boyfriend doesn't usually eat crust but he ate all of Amcili's! Breadsticks were good. They're much thinner than the usual breadstick and topped with what tasted like a garlic parm dressing. Hoagie was standard and they definitely weren't cheap with the toppings and meat like some pizza places. It was a little messy and some of the lettuce was a little hard (could have been from the core), but it still satisfied my appetite nonetheless.   We definitely will be ordering again and I'm excited to try some of their other options."}
{"text":"This pizza definitely hits he spot for me. Flavor is great, just enough sauce to toppings ratio. I wish the slices were more uniform though.   Some slices will be a good size but others are so small you wonder if your actually getting your money's worth.  I've ordered here at least 3 times in the last month. Not too many pizza places to choose from in Murrysville that deliver but these guys are in plum and they deliver out my way. I've had their hoagie as well which was just how I imagined it.   I will definitely continue so order from Amili's. The delivery is fast depending on what time you order. The longest wait time I had was one hour but it was worth the wait to me. Try and see for yourself."}
{"text":"This is the second time that I used Amilis and can say that I am very happy with the service and quality.  I picked up my pizza. It was very good, hot, assembled well. I am happy with it.  I also asks for a refrigerator magnet and the lady was very happy that I asked. I like it and will return."}
{"text":"The value is not very good here. The first topping is not even included! Everything is an upcharge. I made the mistake of getting the Italian sausage and wow, that was such a joke--I guess it was ground up and about 2 morsels made it onto my pizza. Other than that, there was no evidence a shred of sausage made it onto my food.  I've ordered here 3 times now and they definitely skimp on the toppings. The biggest pro here is that it's less than a mile from where I live and location really is everything when you don't want to go over 5 miles just for pizza.   We've gotten many of the sides and I will say those are not bad. The hot wings and the onion rings have been great and not too dry. The prices for the sides are reasonable, unlike for their pizzas. I do like the staff there though and they have been pretty friendly every time I've picked up."}
{"text":"Fantastic.  I was out here for work and they were close by.  Ordered the Italian hoagie.  It was so good I ordered it again for lunch the next day.  Top notch bread and ingredients"}
