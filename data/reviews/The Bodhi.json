{"text":"Absolutely amazing healthy food! So nice to get a change up of healthy food that you can get on the go. All of the dressings and juices are made onsite too! If I could get the beet and ginger miso dressing bottled for home I'd be in heaven they are that good. Definitely don't hesitate to check this place out. Food is extremely fresh and a ton of options for any taste preferences. A must eat new place by ASU! You can customize your own bowl to your tastes or try one of their signature bowls."}
{"text":"Huge fun of Bodhi for many reasons. But a definite newfound fan of the product and service. A great nearby and healthy food option. Many kudos to the Tuesday evening crew for talking me through my first experience. Will definitely be a frequent customer"}
{"text":"The perfect combination of healthy and delicious! I could seriously eat here for breakfast lunch and dinner everyday as there are a TON of options! I highly recommend trying one of their bowl creations (the gaucho and the spicy Moroccan are my favorite). There really isn't another restaurant like it in Arizona with such an exceptional concept!! I will definitely be eating here as often as possible!"}
{"text":"Probably the healthiest and tastiest place I've ever come across on the west coast. This place gives chop shop a run for their money, all ingredients are fresh and made daily. Simply an amazing concept that perceives food through the perspective of health and medicine, genius. This is exactly what millennials are looking for and now available on campus in ASU. Simply tasty and amazing!"}
{"text":"This place is wonderful and refreshing. I had some juice and a build your own bowl and loved it. All the veggies are fresh and large portion sizes. Defiantly try the different sauces as well. If your looking for a healthy treat I would highly recommend stopping here."}
{"text":"Had the rise and shine bowl and the beet juice. Everything was delicious. Super clean healthy food"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now, was very happy with my first bowl (rice, chicken, miso dressing, various toppings) and was moderately happy with my second (rice and salad mixed, steak, creamy basil dressing, various toppings). My only complaint was that their steak was so overcooked it was almost inedible. Maybe cool it on the grilling of the steak, guys! Other than that, very good and a good portion for what you pay as long as you don't go crazy with extras. It'd be nice if they had ASU staff/faculty discount like so many other places near campus, also would be nice if they did punch cards."}
{"text":"Love this place! Huge, healthy bowl options and friendly staff. I will definitely be coming back to try more things as everything on the menu looks delicious. I made my own bowl with quinoa and a bunch of veggies and delicious hummus last time and it was great."}
{"text":"I visited The Bodhi today for the first time. Everyone was so nice that worked there and I was greeted with warm smiles! The menu was so large all the ingredients were so fresh. I ordered the rise and shine bowl and got to sub anything I wanted at no extra charge. Love the breakfast all day!"}
{"text":"Update: Falafel has improved! I really like this place and have been frequenting it for lunch. Service is always amazingly friendly and great. They now have really delicious flavored iced teas too."}
{"text":"I love this place! I always make my own bowl the exact same way. Quinoa base, garbanzo beans, black beans, pumpkin seeds, roast the bell peppers and double steak with ginger miso sauce and hella spicy Moroccan sauce. The besttttt"}
{"text":"The bowl was fresh, the food is amazing. If you want to eat clean and feel better, RUN don't walk to The Bodhi and ask for Fares! He is the owner, very friendly, personable guy! I will definitely be"}
{"text":"This is hands down the best health food eatery in Tempe! The food is amazing and fresh! I recommend getting the food sautéed because it brings out the flavor in the sauces they cook with. The juices are great too! They have a variety of fresh juice which it nice too. In addition, the owners are amazing and truly care about the customers they are serving! The staff are also really friendly which makes it a great place to stay and work. Yes... they have WiFi!! If your in the area check this place out you won't be disappointed!(:"}
{"text":"The Bodhi is a reasonably priced healthy spot for breakfast/ lunch on the corner across from Postino Annex. It is perfect for those days I forget to pack my lunch, I am so excited for something like this to open up here! I ordered the Mediterranean bowl and added chicken- I also tried their beet juice which was excellent. I'm looking forward to trying more of their salads and bowls!"}
{"text":"Been twice so far and can't wait to go back. You get a ton of food for a reasonable price. The falafel is great and the chimichurri hummus is a game changer. Recommend!"}
{"text":"Had the breakfast bowl today and instead of the toast,  since they don't have gluten free bread, they added an extra veggie. I got mine sauteed with the scrambled egg on top as well as the avocado.  Got an orange juice too. Ask for what you want and you'll be happy. Coming back for sure!! The staff was super nice."}
{"text":"Not impressed at all. Bowl was very tiny and $14. They were very stingy with the steak and it was was full of fat and practically inedible. Took about 4 bites of my bowl and tossed it in the trash. Went at peak lunch time and it was not crowded at all. I don't see this place lasting. Cool concept but the food had no flavor, sauces were lackluster and the portions were too small/overpriced. You're much better off heading down the street and getting a bowl or salad at chop shop!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit. Friends took me out to lunch and we divided on a healthy place close to campus. I had heard about Bodhi from a coworker who enjoyed his meal. 

The menu has many options. I settled on the Greek bowl which had falafel, kale, feta cheese, red peppers and more. Lentils and rice filled out the bowl. I am a volume eater so I like my plate full. When the dish came out I looked on the smallish side. Surprise!  Half way through the meal, I was full. It must have been the healthy greens and grain. So good and I felt good knowing it was a healthy meal. 

There were two kinds of ice tea. I had the cactus bloom tea. No sweetener required!  

The establishment wasn't full when we arrive a bit after noon but was busy with students when we left. Would I go back?  Heck yeah!"}
{"text":"I'm glad this place opened near where I work.  There is a nice variety of salads and everything I've tried has been good.  Also, they have breakfast all day.  I also like the big windows and sometimes be able to watch divers jump off the tall diving boards at the ASU swimming pool which is nearby."}
{"text":"This is the second time I've tried The Bodhi. I have left both times less than impressed. This time I ordered the Rise and Shine bowl. The sweet potatoes were literally burnt black on the outside and there was little spinach disbursed in the bowl. Was there lots of food? Yes, plenty of eggs, but the bowl lacked in flavor unless one liked the taste of\"burnt sweet potatoes\". 
This place is indeed healthy and earth conscious, but it certainly lacks in flavor. I prefer the Chop Shop nearby."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place as much as I love bowls but sadly the three bowls we had included some hits and misses. One kiddo had the açaí bowl- nothing special, nothing memorable. The basics of an açaí bowl, layered in a cup. Eh. Another kiddo had the Greek Bowl. The combination of cold veggies, warm lentils and warm, overly dry falafel wasn't great. The falafel was almost dry to the point of choking on it. My bowl, however, was pretty good- kale topped with brussel sprouts, avocado, beets and chick peas with spicy almond dip (like a hummus) and beet vinaigrette. Very tasty and filling. If you're going to go, make your own bowl and avoid the special combos. Skip the açaí and go to Nektar instead."}
{"text":"Delicious and freshly prepared. Fantastic customer service and a great experience! I would highly recommend customizing your own bowls because there are so many options. However they do have a ton of delicious options to choose from. It's a light, bright and healthy place to enjoy a meal."}
{"text":"If you want a combination of healthy, organic and delicious, this is the place!

I love that they have a build a gown option. However, it redeemed reccomend they put some heavy vegetable options on their menu like zucchini, squash, egg plant, maybe when Jack fruit!"}
{"text":"Love the concept of this place! Not only do they provide a ton of different types of healthy options , but they've also created their own types of dips like (my favorites) - spicy almond and feta dip to add onto your bowl. Great place to grab a bite to eat if you're looking for some guilt free meals or want to feed that sweet tooth with an acai bowl :)"}
{"text":"I tried the Bohdi for the first time last month and the food was absolutely wonderful, freshly cooked very tasty and well presented. Let's just say I've been back at least once a week since. The staff were attentive and service overall was great. The restaurant is the perfect size and nicely decorated. All in all impeccable service, great food and even better value for your money. I highly recommend it!!"}
{"text":"I was attracted to this place because of the cool look it had. I decided to order because I saw they had compostable utensils and containers which is something I glorify. I made my own bowl and enjoyed it very much! I won't return back because they have no compost bin! They only have a trash bin which defeats the purpose of having compostable materials! This is ridiculous. The lady even told me they did compost but it was obviously a lie."}
{"text":"I LOVE the food here its one of my favorite spots but every time i have come to eat the girls working dont have any idea what they are doing. Today is waited upwards of 30 minuets for one bowl, while everyone else had already finished eating i was still waiting on my food. As good as it is, it's not worth waiting for 30 minuets. This isn't the first time this has happened either."}
{"text":"Love the clean and high integrity food at this establishment. One of the only places I can eat out on a strict food plan and I am grateful for the delicious options. The owners are kind, generous and delightful."}
{"text":"Cool idea.. food was cold and uncooked though. Not sure if that's how it's supposed to be but I'm not a huge fan of raw onion and spinach. I'll have to pass!"}
{"text":"Yummy half cauliflower rice and quinoa. They were so nice when I ordered the Mother Earth bowl without raw onion. They offered to cook the onion for me. Yeah! All veggies in the bowl were tasty and fresh. Feel good after finishing the bowl without any meat."}
{"text":"Great new concept with healthy choices. Good selection of dips. Everything looked and tasted fresh."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE. This is the up there with the best places in Tempe for a college student. Healthy options, freshly made, and INEXPENSIVE (if you can fathom doing it without meat) $6.56 for a bowl without meat that will FILL YOU UP (Eggs, sweet potatos, bean mix, onions, and avocado is my favorite). And about $9-13 if you want meat. It is a great spot, and you could eat here for a while and not get bored, so many options. Need better sauce options though... All in all its a great place for bowls and for fresh juices. Will come here once a week for the rest of college."}
{"text":"The Greek bowl is healthy, fresh, and flavorful. The space is bright, inviting, and clean. The staff was friendly and helpful. I loved the variety of the menu. I can't wait to try this place for breakfast."}
{"text":"Fresh, healthy, and AFFORDABLE. Build your bowl and grab a juice. Honestly, I hate eating healthy because it's expensive and I think that it wont fill me for the day, but The Bodhi does the job really well with the portions and the cost."}
{"text":"A place that is healthy and the food actually tastes awesome on campus! It is suitable for people who are vegan or not! The vegetables are fresh and the variety of sauces are all bursting with flavors! Highly recommend to stop by"}
{"text":"Had The Bodhi delivered to my work via Postmates and OMG! So good! One of the most unique flavorful (and healthy) Meals I've had in a while!"}
{"text":"Excellent healthy options and awesome service. Owner personally brought over a free almond dip for a friend and I to share while on our lunch break! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Finally a healthy food place that is actually DELICIOUS & knows what they're talking about!!! Crazy affordable prices for top quality food! Can I please eat this for breakfast lunch and dinner every day? Thank you for blessing my tastebuds guys!"}
{"text":"The food is fresh, I will give them that, but there is nothing exceptional about the bowls that warrant paying up to $12 per bowl. I had the Mother Earth and it came with exactly FIVE leaves of spinach."}
{"text":"Definitely check this place out if you're looking for a spot that is both delicious and nutritious, which is much more than can be said for most places. The employees are very friendly and generous with samples of sauce, etc."}
{"text":"Love this concept! Fresh, nutritious, and delicious foods that make eating healthy convenient and enjoyable. I made my own bowl and it was amazing. The staff was friendly and knowledgeable and allowed me to sample a couple of their favorite dips before ordering. They also offer catering and custom meals plans created by their in-house nutritionist! A definite must try when you're in Tempe."}
{"text":"Stopped in yesterday after working out.  Had a salad and fresh juice. Both were fresh made with real food. Owner was there and very engaged, along with the store nutritionist. Highly recommend if you like healthy food that tastes good. I was more than pleasantly surprised with the experience."}
{"text":"Wanted to try this place because it's so close to campus & took over the old Fractured Prune restaurant. Anyway, i ordered a $7 açaí bowl with dark chocolate for an extra dollar. The açaí bowl came out soupy and lukewarm. It wasn't even cold or slightly cool. I got it to-go and put the bowl in my freezer for 30 minutes to get it tasting normal. My friend got the berry overnight oats and hers was frozen solid... :/ won't be going back"}
