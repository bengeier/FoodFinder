{"text":"I grew up in East L.A. and been eating Hollenback burritos for 45 years. Myself, brother, uncle and kid's went yesterday at 11:20 on March 23. We ordered food with 2 big traditional Hollenback burritos but, what we got were 2 small 1/2 the size so call famous Hollenback. When I mentioned it to my waitress,she too was not sure. She called someone from the back and woman said that it is a traditional Hollenback burrito. Also it is not a good location it's in a retirement community hard to find. Not only that it is not worth $13 a piece but myself family n friends will never return."}
{"text":"Second time we've been there and they don't have food!!  The first time was right after their grand opening. And they were closing at 1:00. Their website says 3pm ! This time at NOON, all they were able to serve was tacos, taquitos and hamburgers. They should've not been able to use this name. Especially when they have the famous Hollenbeck Burrito on the menu.  Manuel must be turning in his grave (RIP)  I've frequented the original el Tepeyac On evergreen in east LA many times. I grew up there.  These folks are NOT carrying on the tradition.  Too bad. Won't be back."}
{"text":"This restaurant is located in a gated golf community but it is accessible. Went in and was seated right away. There were three other tables with customers. We were asked if we wanted drinks and ordered margaritas and water. It took a bit to get the drinks based on the amount business they had. When we tasted our drinks they were terrible, my guest said they tasted soapy but it was worst than that. We tried stirring up the drinks and no help. The server asked how the drinks were and we told her they did not taste right. To her credit she took the drinks away and didn't add them to our bill. I later overheard our server say to another coworker \"I told you, I'm not a bartender.\" We also had to order chips and salsa. The chips were crispy and seemed freshly made. The salsa had a lot of tomato, not very flavorful. When it came to entree's I asked the server what is popular and she said she likes the Hollenbeck Burrito, and my guest ordered tacos and asked for one chicken and one beef taco. The server had said she would ask about the tacos and when she served them said they could only be one or the other so we got chicken tacos. The Hollenbeck burrito had beans, rice, beef, avocado, lettuce. The tortilla was crispy in some areas. The beans were ok, the avocado did not have seasoning and the 5 Pieces of beef I got were tender in parts.  The burrito ingredients did not go well with each and there were sections, so you got an area of a rice burrito, a bean burrito, and then beef around different parts. The tacos seemed like meat in a shell and then fried and there was a greasy chunk of chicken in the middle of the taco. We will not repeat."}
{"text":"We went there for breakfast for the first time the food tasted great but the portions were small and the cost of the meal was more than average. We decided to try dinner with a group of family and friends that didn't go over quite so well. The margaritas tasted alcohol free and had to be remade. Chips and salsa were very good, but chip refills were infrequent , waitress tried to provide good customer service but not well-versed on the menu items which caused several of our entrées to be sent back and remade, The burritos were stuffed with rice and beans very little meat which is unusual for a Mexican food  restaurant in Arizona. Probably won't be going back for a while as this is a new restaurant just starting out. May try it again in six months if it stays open that long."}
{"text":"I have been a long time customer of the original Manuel's El Tepeyac restaurant located on Evergreen St in East Los Angeles. I was so glad that Markos, (Manuels son) decided to open a restaurant in Surprise inside the Sun Village retirement community. My favorite plate is the Hollenbeck burrito and it is a meal and a half so be prepared to take some of it home with you. It is OUTSTANDING !!!"}
{"text":"Location is in a retirement community...weird. Grand opening was yesterday March 10, 2018. Came today Sunday, they gave us the menu and said they only have breakfast which was like 5 items to choose from. Hmm if I wanted breakfast I'll go to the i you know what. 9am-1pm are the hours they gave me for Sunday. So we left with no burritos..sad face. Californians don't bother coming here if you're coming from Phoenix or further. I called and got one story and got another in person. Their workers are not on it. The place is small and 98% of the people were from the community. This is not the Tepeyac from East L.A. it was too good to be true."}
{"text":"Very good place for Mexican food had the burrito and it was delicious, hostess was also very cute and friendly"}
{"text":"Here it is!  Born & Raised in Cali now in Arizona ~ it was a Blessing to have El Tepeyac here in Surprise, unclear on why it was in a Senior Gated Community... anyways I went out there today to order the Hard Taco & Taquitos Plates ~   Not only was I told one of the owners and staff walked off the job 3 weekend ago ...  The food was very depressing... I swear the beans were refried Can beans the Spanish rice was bland, no seasoning .. the shredded meat for the tacos and taquitos were cold and watery with no taste ~      It's a SHAME I will not be going back there ~  It was a total was of my money !!"}
{"text":"Third attempts to try their famous burrito. The place had probably about 4 other patrons. Greeted and seated promptly, but afterwards the service was slow. Was not offered drinks right away. We decided to split original size Original Hollenbeck (seared pork meat simmered in their traditional red tomato based chile verde recipe, rice beans & guacamole topped with chile verde sauce) and chips & salsa. It took longer than I expected for the food to arrive considering the place was not packed. Chips and salsa were good, a bit heavy handed on the salt for the chips. The burrito came fairly warm but the tortilla was cold. Great news is the food was delicious! I personally loved it. But would not come back here again to dine in, instead will get it to go. They need to really pay attention on service especially being newly opened. The four stars review is solely on the food."}
{"text":"Went her for  MENUDO and there was none  !  Call be for you go to see if the have the full menu. We got here and were promptly seated. Our waitress Trisha asked we would like and we asked for water and a Bloody Mary, chips and salsa. Trisha informed us that they did not have chips & salsa. The only thing that was available was was the limited breakfast menu. We asked about the lunch and dinner menu, Trisha replied that she needed to speak to the manager to see if we could order off lunch, dinner menu . Trisha returned & said we could order from the lunch / dinner menu. But at this point I decided to eat elsewhere because what I really wanted \"Menudo\" and it was not available .  Growing up in Los Angeles and eat at the at the Original \"El Tepeyac Cafe\". And believe me when I say the food is good. I'm giving this place 5 stars because I know the food is going to be good. El Tepeyac Cafe has been in business for over 50 years . It has been reviewed by Man VS Food. Check out this video clip https://youtu.be/mIoonY8mWXE"}
{"text":"This place is a disgrace to the original! We were ignored for the first 10 min then the waitress was rude when we asked for chips and salsa , which everyone else got then they sat down. Manuel must be rolling over in his grave as this is going to kill the name off."}
{"text":"I went to their grand opening celebration on Sunday at 5pm with my mom. The place was packed. They were supposedly having a band play outside but because of rain, they were moved into a banquet room inside. Every table was filled with young families from outside of the retirement community. We were amazed at the number of people there. Obviously advertising in the local community made a difference. It seemed like this well known joint from East L.A. was not going to have any trouble getting business.   At the restaurant, our group asked to be seated. We were told they weren't seating anyone, yet there were at least a hundred people already seated in the banquet room next door as well as at their restaurant and back room.  The waitress said we could come back in an hour at 6pm to get our name on a list to be seated at that time. It didn't make sense. Why were all of these outside families being seated, but our group from the retirement community being told to come back later?  We left and found another restaurant to eat at.   A few days later on Wednesday, we came again at 5pm. We joined our group of friends that was already seated. The restaurant appeared to be either understaffed or not staffed with competent people. A \"flying club\" of about 30 people was meeting in the back room, and one waitress appeared to be dealing exclusively with them. The other waitress was handling all of the inside tables and outdoor patio tables. She was obviously overwhelmed.   After waiting a period of time and no one giving us menus or drinks, my mom went to the bar to see if she could order from there. Tammy, the bartender was extremely busy. She was helping take drinks to the patio tables outside. One man from another group went to the bar to get his drinks and she yelled at him to not touch the drinks at the bar. Apparently he had been waiting for his drinks to arrive and thought he would just pick them up himself. After my mom witnessed that negative interaction, she decided to just grab menus and sit down.   Our waitress finally made her way to our table to handout credit card transactions to others in our group who were leaving. She took our drink and food order at that time. We were told the restaurant was out of tacos and out of pork. They are known for their famous burritos with pork, but we were told they could serve them to is with shredded chicken instead. My mom opted for a taco salad with ground beef. I selected a bean and cheese burrito.   .....crickets.....  The wait was painfully slow. No drinks arrived. My mom approached the bartender again. There were a lot of drinks waiting to be taken to people, but the waitress never did get them. The drinks had been sitting there for some time because the ice had melted in them. The bartender started bringing them to our table, but she wasn't sure whose drinks  they were. She put three watered down drinks in front of us. One was partially drank by someone and the other two may not have been margaritas. Hard to tell with the ice melted and orange wedges instead of lime at the rim of the glass. Obviously they were no longer margaritas ON THE ROCKS. She put another drink in front of my friend who said she didn't order the drink. The bartender then grabbed all of the watered down drinks and took them away. Fortunately, she made two fresh margaritas on the rocks for my mom and me, which was what we ordered and had been waiting for this entire time. They finally arrived at our table along with our food.   The bus boy was nice enough to notice that we didn't have silverware or napkins. He brought us some right away so we could enjoy our food. The taco salad was really quite large with lots of goodies. There was a cup of jalapeños on the side, and a cup of habanero sauce on the side of my mom's salad and lots of guacamole inside. My bean and cheese burrito also had a side of habanero sauce, but no guacamole or sour cream. It was quite large too and tasted fine.   The food and drinks were really not worth the wait or expense (our two margaritas, taco salad and burrito were about $33). Applebee's serves better tasting margaritas and they come with chips and salsa which wasn't the case here. The service on both occasions that I came to El Tepeyac was not up to par. I understand that new businesses will take some time to iron out the wrinkles, but this restaurant already had a loyal following from its California location. They really needed to bring their experienced wait staff with them to make the opening days at this location more of a success. We wish them well and hope the next time we come that they have their full menu available and competent wait staff to deliver it in a timely manner."}
{"text":"Just like the original location in East Los Angeles Ca. As a law enforcement member I ate at this FAMILY restaurant more times than I can count. I wish you the best of luck and hope that the golf course board give you a chance and stops talking down about you. Yes that would be the heavy set man that set next to me and said he was the board member liaison to the restaurant. Later joined my five other members.  Also know that the location has been put out to all law enforcement that live in the area so you'll see more of us. God Bless wish you the best!!!!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed. I've been going to El Tepeyac in East LA since I was young so I know what the flavors should be. With that being said, this was not the flavors I remember. ( I just moved here from California about a month ago so it hasn't been long since the last we tried). We went yesterday for dinner hoping for the taste we remember but it was far off. First off, menu is still a printed piece of paper, secondly the Salsa was like tomato sauce, like it was really bad. So On to our meal, in which we ordered the Original Manuel special and a side of taquitos. So the burrito Came out, size wise they got it down, but flavor and look of The burrito was off. It was not smothered in its Chile and cheese like we all know, it was dry, like really dry. We had to ask for more sauce to try to make it taste descent. I don't know how many tortillas they wrapped it in either because I got no other taste other than tortilla in which I left a majority on my plate. So It's like a digging for your food game looking for something other than tortilla. The guacamole was very bland. Definitely not the guacamole we are used to in the burrito or on top of the taquitos. The service was good, until we left. We paid the waitress (who was also the bartender). Left the tip and bagged the remaining food and began heading out when one of the waiters or bus boys rudely says to the hostess in front of us \"Hey molly, did they pay or are they leaving\" just as we were walking out! I can not believe it. \"Did he just say that? \" I said and looked at the hostess and said that was very rude. You should communicate with your severs before you rudely open your mouth and insult someone. So, with that being the cherry on top, we definitely will not be returning. It was a complete waste of money. AND the location is inside a retirement center, it's a bad location to place this restaurant that definitely did not live up to the name us Mexicans know all so well."}
{"text":"I would avoid this place.  It took 1 hour to get our small order, the waitress indicated that they just had a large group, but no one was in the closed in area when we arrived.  My two small beef burrito's were over cooked and dry.  My husband's pork Burrito De Chile Verde was ok but not great.  The description of \"needing two hands to hold it\" does not apply.  There is nothing to hold onto, it's a pile of black beans, lettuce, pork, on tortilla chips.  Everyone around us in the patio area, waiting a good hour for food delivery.  I was very disappointed and told Evonne we were not happy.  I had to get my own beers from the bar.The only reason people are there, is because it is the only eatery in the complex.  One star rating is too much, typed menu's on white paper - what's with that!!!  Stay clear unless you have lots of time on your hands, don't mind eating less than average food at normal prices and don't mind being ignored. Sue W"}
{"text":"Very disappointed! I'm from ELA love El Tepeyac! Was super excited to know that they are opening one a few miles from me. The place is in a gated community it closes at 1pm on Sunday. They sat us right away. There must have been a no more than 10 tables being served. But they took 25 mins for the waitress to get our drink order and that's only because I asked. Then she had an attitude about it. I can't even imagine how they would be if they were to capacity like in LA. The servers were young with attitudes they need some personality or find another job. Then it took them another 15 mins to take our order. I had to ask if they could bring us chips and salsa. The food took about another 45 mins to come out. The Manuel Special look the same and taste almost the same but it was very loose. Didn't have enough rice and definitely not enough Guacamole. We also asked for Menudo they stated the don't serve it but it's on the menu. I asked for a Michelada it took them 30 mins to come tell me they don't have tomato juice to make them. We also order their Huevos Rancheros very disappointed with the taste and presentation. It was a plate with rice beans and 2 eggs with salsa. No tortilla underneath. We order horchata that tasted very much watered down. Manuel is turn in his grave knowing-that his name is behind this establishment. I can't see this location open for very long. Very very disappointed!"}
