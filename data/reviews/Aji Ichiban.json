{"text":"This place was decent. I agree with other reviewer that the TV was a distraction and some of the rolls we're bland. The tarantula roll was better than the rest but in my opinion expensive. The spring roll appetizer was way too pricey for three of them, and wasn't the best spring roll I've ever ate. (Especially for over 7 bucks for three of them!) 

I gave them three stars because my chicken and beef teriyaki was excellent! Could have used more broccoli and less sprouts though. It's an Ok sushi place for the price, but I've had better."}
{"text":"The best part of Aji Ichiban is the friendly service. 

I came here for lunch last week and although I have no major complaints (except for the TVs I guess--I have a bias against any establishment with TVs) I was fairly underwhelmed with the food. This may have been because I ordered a combo (a few pieces of sushi, a small cali roll, tempura shrimp and veggies, miso, very very small iceberg lettuce salad), which isn't really my thing ($12 for lunch which is a decent deal I guess). But I did find the cali roll and veggies strangely bland. A good soaking in soya sauce and wasabi wasn't enough to make it interesting.  And the sushi was alright but in my opinion nothing special.

The place is clean and comfortable though and, as I mentioned, the service is great. My co-workers come here quite a lot so I'll likely give Aji Ichiban another go (they seem to like it lots). But not if I have an alternative option."}
