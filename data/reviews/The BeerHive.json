{"text":"I don't understand the positive reviews on this place; I'm even being a little generous. I just moved to Pittsburgh in November, from D.C., and I'm going to start getting into this Yelp thing. I live pretty close to the Beerhive, and it was my first Pittsburgh bar experience. I don't know if it's a Pittsburgh thing, but why are bars here all so similar. It's pretty boring, bland, and drab little dive. Granted, we were there in the afternoon, and the place was empty, but it's just so dreary inside.  Sure, dive bars probably don't have the budget or necessity to hire a decorator, but man, this place looks pretty DIY. Black walls, bad call. And the artwork chosen to adorn the walls doesn't make any sense. Sports bar? Bottle Shop? Pub? Another reviewer said that the place was hip, and that's crazy talk. If that's hip, then my ten year old, stained t-shirts must be pretty chic. The name Beerhive gave me a good chuckle though, that's pretty cheesy, but maybe that's what they're going for. And a note, beerhive was a beer produced by New Holland Brewing, a few years ago, so let's just hope that they don't have a TM on that. Maybe I'm being nit-picky, but we should have just walked on by, but my wife was curious, so we gave it a shot.   I'm something of a beer geek, and for a place with the word beer in it's name, well, the selection was underwhelming. Only like ten drafts, and all way too similar, and the bottle selection was pretty standard stuff, nothing really rare or worth going out of your way for. Decent pricing, that's a plus. I was kind of hungry, but was pretty worried about getting some low-grade bar food, but I checked the menu anyway.  Pretty standard, I guess, for bars around here, but I can't say that I expected much from the place. Gastropubs are popping up all over D.C., and that's a trend that I wholly embrace. Rather, it was a menu of mostly deep-fried stuff, and a pretty poor selection. And not to be an ass, but the description of the food was very, I don't know, silly. Our server mentioned that the place was pretty new, and owned by three brothers, and it's clear that this is their first go at this.  I opted for the pulled pork, and my wife had the spinach salad. My pulled pork was actually pretty good, better than I expected, and well seasoned, and it was served with (not fresh cut) fries, and actually some of the best cole slaw I've ever had. It wasn't the mayo-ey variety, which I don't care for, but rather in some sort of vinagrette. The sandwich was a little light on the bbq, but the house-made pickles were a nice touch. The fries tasted like the fryer oil hadn't been changed in quite some time. My wife enjoyed her salad. It came dressed in a ginger-honey dressing, had apples and tomatoes on top and grated parmasean cheese. All in all, pretty decent food - better than expected - a pleasant surprise. But on to the reason I'm writing this review:  A few weeks ago, I was walking through the strip with a co-worker, and he wanted to stop in the Beerhive to get a six pack to go. The bartender told us that if we didn't want our beers cold, we could pick stuff from their beer selection upstairs.  Everything was stored in a weird little, dark closet. I was perplexed as most places would only store premium beers that can actually be bottle aged, so it was strange to see so many beers that cannot be bottle aged.  It just doesn't make sense.  But the prices were pretty good. And I must mention, again, the artwork on the walls, oh my, what were they thinking. I didn't plan on eating, but my buddy wanted to get a little something before we left. I told him that their pulled pork was pretty good, and I was just going to get a few wings to snack on.   I gotta say, it was a very different experience from my first time there. My buddy did order the pulled pork, I ordered a half-dozen spicy asian wings. Again, the place was practally empty, but our food took well over 20 minutes to arrive. My wings were good, but I must say, the names of their sauces were pretty silly. All bee themed, which is cute to some, but if you are the Beerhive, then is it not beer in the hive and not bees; I don't know. Anyway, my friend's pulled pork looked like it was slopped on the plate, which was kind of dirty. And he handed me a fork-full of the pork, and it was dry, kind of charred, and underseasoned. He doesn't care for cabbage, so I helped myself to the slaw, and it just tasted like cabbage in some watery, tasteless liquid.  Consistency people. Sorry, Beerhive, but you've got some work to do. I'd stop in again to buy a sixer, but I would never hang out there, or recommend it. There's really no reason to go out of your way, or to go at all, unless you go in expecting very little. I'd redecorate, scrap the food, or go in a different direction with it.  My next review will be Kaya, after I go again; I really like that place. The best part: when I walk past the beerhive, then I know that Kaya's just a block away. -Lee McDonald"}
{"text":"Good casual atmosphere and free wifi. The liquor selection is excellent; I'm not a beer drinker, so I can't comment on that. The hamburger I had was inedible, but the bacon tacos are ridiculously good. The clientele is a nice mix of blue and white collar, and the bartenders have uniformly been pros."}
{"text":"This is my second visit.  This time, I went for a late Sunday lunch and had the beer sampler and the peanut butter/bacon/pickle burger w maple syrup.  It's an unusual combination of flavours that surprisingly worked.  The place was lively but not crazy crowded.  We were able to comfortably watch the Pirate game and have a conversation.   Friendly bartenders too."}
{"text":"Great bar, fast service, and cool vibe. Aloni took great care of us, provided exemplary service. Try the bloody so tasty"}
{"text":"There wasn't much of a tap selection. Also I don't know if we picked 6 bad beers or if the taps were bad but none of the beers were good. Very disappointed.  The bartender was wonderful is the only reason I gave it 2 stars. We didn't eat so I can't comment on the food. We paid $15 for 6 samples, way over priced compared to other places in Pittsburgh. Not a fan!"}
{"text":"We hit the 'Hive for the first time at a weird hour - 11:00am on a Sunday, as they were just opening. We were welcomed in as though we were old friends, tasted a few craft beers, ended up having a Crabbie's (YES! They serve Crabbie's!) and proceeded to devour some of the best food I have ever had in a bar, and I mean EVER! The  menu is the exact opposite of humdrum bar food. The BELT sandwich had me begging for more. Sweet potato fries, samosas, fried plantains and wings (so many flavors to choose from) filled us up nicely. I can't wait to go back because there are so many more menu items I wanted to try but my belly wasn't big enough! Great decor - comfortable and really nice. This would be a great place to watch a game or take a date. My husband and I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my first time at The Beerhive. I didn't think the bar looked like a Steeler's bar, its yellow and black for bees, which I even enjoyed the little bee people on the bathroom doors (bathroom was clean also) ! The food was good, chicken salad actually had real chicken, and you could tell it was a freshly made salad. Service was great, very friendly staff. Prices were reasonable too. They had paintings/photography from local artists on the wall, and more upstairs, which was enjoyable. I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing. Was in Pittsburgh over the weekend...there was a chalkboard sign in front of the Beerhive promoting their Blood Marys. I love a good bloody mary, so I was excited to go in. The place apparently did not open for another hour---so I am not sure why they had the sign out already. But we figured we would come back since we were shoppping in the area. WORST. BLOODY. MARY. EVER. A tiny glass of crap. We asked for hot sauce, horseradish, pepper, pickles anything to doctor this up...but you couldn't make this better. Friends got some food and it was also very bad...service wasn't great either. But at least I could talk to my friends, oh wait, after about 20 minutes, they decided to turn on the radio extremely loud. So much for talking...it was only 11:30 in the morning on a Sunday. I do not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Love this place for a bloody mary. The sweet potato fries with maple bacon syrup is amazing. Bartenders are always friendly. A gem in the strip!"}
{"text":"This place is another great dive bar on the strip in Pittsburgh. The Penn Pumpkin Roll is Amazing, but Make sure you ask for the cinnamon and sugar around the rim. Also they have a beer called Sprecher, Hard root beer, And it tastes  just like Root Beer, awesome. There is also an Upstairs for extra room and a great View."}
{"text":"The most rude bartenders I have ever encountered.  Great food.  It's a shame that the first time I was told to \" say the magic word\" when I asked to buy a jar of pickles.  I was told to say \"May I please have a jar of pickles\".  Gee, does someone have a power issue?  My second visit I had ONE drink, but had a couple teenagers who were meeting me there (one wanted to buy pickles for her dad), as it is not a \"family \" place per se, we were on our way.   I ordered another drink and was told I was shut off.  I told the bartender that the girls were leaving, and she informed me that it was me that was the problem. I asked what it was, and she didn't have one. I guess that the bartender with short black hair has some sort of issue with females, perhaps she is jealous of attractive females? I am certainly not referring to myself, but if I owned this place I would be very wary.    Attractive females usually bring business in.  Psycho bartenders do not. Sad because I told everyone how great this place is. Now I am going to tell a different story."}
{"text":"Attended a big gathering in the upstairs room. Waitress managed large crowd with grace. Because of the event I didn't really check out the whole place, so no report on overall vibe.   Seitan tacos were really delicious. Vegetarians don't have tons of options; most dishes seem to involve bacon.   Didn't get a chance to try the toasted cheese sandwich but it sounds great; includes bleu cheese. Hand cut fries and chips also sound good.  No gluten free options labeled on the menu."}
{"text":"Awesome beer, friendly staff, and incredible pork tacos. I would recommend the tasting to get a good taste of everything. Very reasonably priced and you get a good amount of food. I'm only in town for the weekend but if I come back this place will be at the top of my list."}
{"text":"Nothing spectacular, nothing bad. Average wings. I was there mid afternoon, and obviously not too busy."}
{"text":"Mediocre fare served by a gracious and friendly bar staff. The draft list is far shorter than I would expect for a 'beerhive' and I just can't buy into the rhetoric behind their practice of serving 12 ounce pours of 'difficult to find' session-beers and IPAs at $5-$7/glass."}
{"text":"Decent bar. Best thing about them is their hours. Decent selection of drinks and bar snacks."}
{"text":"Anyone that's been to the Strip District on a beautiful Saturday morning in Pittsburgh knows that Penn Ave can be quite chaotic between all the cars and mass of people weaving in and out of the streets. My girl and I come to the strip often to get our groceries and putz around looking for side street attractions and food vendors to nibble on as we jaunt around.  10am and feeling the need for a cold draft beer for some reason...No I am not an Alcoholic haha, we stumbled into The Beerhive. I've walked by the place a hundred times before, but the fact that I could get a cold draft beer at 10am sounded pretty refreshing to me instead of my regular cup of joe.   The place is very warm and welcoming. I felt like I could of spent all day here just relaxing sipping on some Yingz and talking to the other friendlies at the bar watching some sports on a handful of TVs in the place.   They offer a Saturday Morning breakfast menu till noon with a half dozen or so breakfast sandwiches or so. I got an egg sand which with bacon, lettuce, tomato, and spicy mayo all between two pieces of Italian toast accompanied with greasy home-fries and peppers. Tasted amazing with the Yuengling draft.   My girl was a little disappointed that they only served breakfast at this time till noon when she had picked out an appetizer and a burger from menu and was told they couldn't make her selections at this time of the day so I split my sandwich with her and she really enjoyed it as well.  The Beerhive is not a world changing place, think more blue collar sports bar and welcoming. It did have a good breakfast sandwich and a dozen or so other beers and IPA's on draft that I'd like to come back and try in the future. It also does have a full liquor bar, but I dont think I'd come here asking for a speciality cocktail or anything like that even though they did have a few spiked morning beverages like a Mimosa, Bloody Mary on their breakfast menu...I think I'll also try stopping by one evening and seeing what the nightly crowd is like and try something off their evening menu. Next time I'm in the strip though on a Saturday morning I think I'll definitely be stopping back for a greasy breakfast sandwich and a cold brew! Maybe I'll see yinz there?  May your drink always stay cold! Yours truly...The Shaw"}
{"text":"Stumbled into this place by accident. Cool dark cave like feel with a nice beer selection . Homemade potato chips were good but the deep fried banana peppers stole the show . I've never seen banana peppers deep fried whole like this , very good . Staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant over the weekend and I absolutely loved it! They did not have a large selection of beer which surprised me but the food was amazing. Everyone I came with loved their food. I got the pork tacos and they were very very good. We also got the chicken nachos as an appetizer and they were amazing. All the ingredients on the nachos were fresh. The lighting was a little dim so it was hard to read the menu. It was super packed but we were able to find seats on the second floor. They only had one girl working the bar and all the tables on the second floor so service was a little slow at first. Pricing of the food was very reasonable. I will definitely be going back to the beerhive in the near future."}
{"text":"Great selection of drafts and knowledgeable bartenders. They also have a lot of different beers in their coolers. I did not get any food but it looked good."}
{"text":"I had an overall good first experience at BeerHive. The food was much better than I would have expected for \"bar food.\" I ordered the chicken fingers and they had a delicious sweet potato breading- amazing! My friend tried a burger and also had nothing but good things to say about it. Fries were ok, nothing special. Fairly limited menu, but everything we ordered was good. The on tap beer selection was nothing to rave about, which I found surprising for a specialty beer bar. I would have expected more than 8-10 beers on tap. It was a good variety of more unusual beers, however. My main complaint was that the type of beer (ie. wheat, stout, IPA) was not listed anywhere. Our waitress was new, so she was unable to answer any of our questions about the beer selection. They did seem to have an extensive bottle beer selection, however. Ambience: average. It looks like a typical sports bar. The downstairs bar area is fairly small with only a few tables and a counter along the wall, but there is additional seating upstairs. Menus were shabby looking and could definitely use a makeover. The restaurant itself was clean, at least. Local artwork on walls for purchase. Service: somewhat slow, as I would expect for a new establishment. It took a while for the bartenders and waitress to notice us, even though it wasn't at all busy. Once we ordered, it was quick. We had to ask for glasses- our beers were handed to us in bottles, which seemed weird for a \"beer\" bar. I would come back again for a drink and a meal, but I wouldn't recommend it to any beer connoisseurs. There are other bars with a more extensive draft list catering to that crowd. Might be a good place to watch sports. There was a Steelers preseason game on TV as we were leaving and most of the people in the bar were there to watch it (complete with yelling at the TV). Prices were very reasonable."}
{"text":"Wanted to check out the music playing but the bartenders only wanted to serve the male patrons"}
{"text":"Was headed to the Strip to get one of Lucy's delicious banh mi sandwiches, but it was a cold cold Sunday and she was nowhere to be found.  Needless to say the day turned into a Sunday Funday when we stumbled upon this little gem.  It was the coldest day of the year so far and there weren't too many brave soles out in the Strip, but this place had an in and out crowd.  The place has nice decor and a good beer selection, with about a dozen draft beers.  The was a young lady and gentleman working the bar and few tables and both were very knowledgeable about their beers, very attentive to the costumer, and were also good company.  I can't say too much about the food, except the two flavors of wings we had were pretty good.  One was a hot wing flavor with jalapeno puree, and the other was a maple bacon flavor.  The maple bacon was good, but not great.  It could have been great with a little more bacon, or a better way to keep the bacon sticking to the wing.   We also had a side of french fries.  They are the crispy batter dipped kid that are one of my favorites, but these were a little soggy (still decent though).  They also give you the choice of old bay seasoning, ranch seasoning, or seasoned salt for an extra 50 cents.  50 cents is a rip off, but I sure do love old bay on my fries so I couldn't pass it up."}
{"text":"I was visiting my sister for the weekend and had just finished dinner at a nearby restaurant with her, my brother-in-law, and a couple of their friends when we decided we wanted to get a few drinks somewhere.  We went to Beerhive and loved it.  If you like good beer, and I definitely do, then this is the place to go.  The atmosphere is fun, the staff is super friendly, and the beer selection can't be beat.  We didn't get any food because we had just eaten, but the menu looked awesome.  We will definitely be back to try the food, and of course more beer."}
{"text":"Consistently Great. This is what a local pub should be. Great staff and great food with knowledge of everything beer related."}
{"text":"Typical sports bar place with some nice beers on tap. Nothing too special in terms of food or drink, but good place if you want to pick up a 6 pack. They have daily specials."}
{"text":"Like this place a lot.  Neighborhood style bar that is very comfortable.  Excellent beers on tap.  Had the wings which were out of this world.  Bursting with flavor.  Maple bacon, and cilantro lime jalapeño."}
{"text":"I used to enjoy this place. Lots of good beer and good appetizers.   Last time I was here there, had a bad experience but will give it another shot."}
{"text":"Food was great. Staff were friendly and gave very good service, . The Beerhive has a good vibe. Beer was very good too. I enjoyed it Very much!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch during a half workday, ordered a couple of beers and a burger. The beers were good, a little pricey for what they were and the glass wasn't the cleanest. The burger was pretty greasy and overcooked like crazy. It was as expected I guess, nothing great but nothing terrible. There's better options around."}
{"text":"Best bar in the strip (all the others close early).  Food is great, plenty of drink options.  I really like the upstairs bar, even though there are fewer drinks."}
{"text":"This place is one of the best kept secrets in the strip district. We came on a Wednesday night where the specials were Yuengling draft and wings! They also had an open mic upstairs for comedians trying out their jokes. They have many craft beers and good bar food. I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"This is now our strip district watering hole! Upon wondering around the strip, we starting talking to a lady, we now know is Amy. She was very nice to talk to and invited us to visit her at work, she was headed in for her shift. So we did! Amy and carol took care of me and my husband. They let us sample two beers, and we picked a growler from that. They were both so nice and provided such great service. As a service industry couple, we appreciate friendly bartenders that know their stuff. We didn't eat, but they spoke highly of the food. We will definitely be back, and you can thank Amy and carol for that!"}
{"text":"We ducked in here in between acts at a local festival going on down the street.  I was looking for a little refuge from the crowds, heat, and more so some cold beers that weren't event priced.  Well with a name like Beerhive, one would certainly expect an ample beer list full of choices.  Nah.  For starters I don't know if the bartender was having a bad day or was just overly unfriendly.  We aren't the type to snap our fingers or wave our hands for service but she sure treated us like we were bothering her.  As mentioned this \"beerhive\" was more of a \"Beer-hemmed in\".  I don't consider 12 taps special.  Especially if two to three of them contain commercial beer and cider.  I guess the list of bottles was more extensive but I like a draft when I go out for a beer.    As noted the bartender, very unfriendly.  It really wasn't even busy.  I honestly don't think she spoke more than a few words to us.  I asked for a couple waters when we ordered.  Our drinks delivered, she never spoke.  I waited and it became obvious she \"forgot\" so I asked again.  No apology or oh yea no problem.  More of a roll her eyes and slap some water down.  She only gave us a clear plastic cup, and though it was nice and cold I was thirsty from the heat outside and drank it fast.  When I asked for more water I was again ignored for at least my first two requests.    We decided to leave after just one.  Sorry nothing special here, and I don't really like my beer served with a side of salty."}
{"text":"Holy expensive beer batman,  My trip the the Beerhive was unplanned my boyfriend and I needed a place to duck out for an hour while we waited on a ride.   I don't like the look, or feel of this place, I am not a fan of \"craft beers\" and probably never will be my experiences in \"craft beer\" establishments has always been poor.  I  had 3 miller light bottles, because I didn't want to just be sitting in a bar looking like a  couple of squatters, my boyfriend had two high balls and the bill was 25.00 dollars what the freak?!?   The Beerhive doesn't appeal to me in any way."}
{"text":"The BeerHive is fine. I've never eaten there so I can't speak to the food, though based on the menu it just seems like your typical bar fare. For a place that says they're known for their beer selection, the draft list left a bit to be desired. After a draft I snagged a bottle from their cooler, which also had an okay selection. The atmosphere wasn't great either - you could tell that there were some locals who hung out in there all the time, and we were definitely outsiders. We might try it again since our friends are moving right down the street, but we'd explore other options first before going back."}
{"text":"Been here a few times now for different occasions. My favorite feature is the sampler of 6 craft beers which rotate regularly. Perfect size you or to share. Unfortunately for this round, my partner and I were unlucky and had only had a taste for 1.5 of the 6. [This was not the case last time].  The upstairs is laid out perfectly for group meet-ups and you get this great \"loft\" feelng of being elevated over the window that looks out onto Penn Avenue. Food wise, it's solid barfood, chicken fingers and wings etc.  Stop in on weekdays for karaoke or music trivia."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of the BeerHive! This place typically has a great selection and does honeycombed samplers with samples large enough for sharing. Plenty of TV's to catch the game while in the Strip District. The place isn't incredibly large, so when I've been there with a group we haven't always been able to have a table, but there's usually enough space to gather and still feel like you have your own space.  Last time I was there they had a good selection of local beers and the full selection was very diverse. It seems like any beer drinker could find something they love there."}
{"text":"Great local brews on tap.  Half-price apps from 9-11pm. Awesome bartenders. Bonus- no smoking patrons on the night we visited. Definitely recommend if you are in the Strip."}
{"text":"Nice beers and good beer flight although a tad expensive  I thought $15 for 6 beers I think? Nicely presented  in a hive patterned carrier. Didn't eat there though"}
{"text":"Great place for food and a good rotating draft beer selection. Beerhive has the feel of a neighborhood bar in the Strip, that is, not a tourist attraction like most of the other spots on Penn Ave. The food selection is better than typical pub food. Service staff is friendly, attentive, and keeps the place clean. Trivia on Thursday night and Taco Tuesday are both worth checking out."}
{"text":"The Beerhive has an extensive amount of beer to try as the name would suggest. As an IPA lover, I could kill a lot of time at this establishment (and probably my liver at the same time) with their selection.  They have a solid draft selection. For what they don't have on tap, they have more than enough to make up for in their bottle selection!"}
{"text":"This is a good spot for Thursday night trivia, good specials on food and drinks. The restaurant has a nice cozy feel. It is off the beaten path for me so I don't come that often but this place is never a disappointment. Also, their homemade bloody marys are yummy!"}
{"text":"This is the cleanest dive bar I have ever been to. Their menu is astounding with so many different flavors and items that you would not expect. There is a sandwich here with peanut butter, bacon, pickles and maple glaze to dip it in. It is so good. The wing flavors are so good. Come on a Wednesday and get 12 wings for 6$ and amazing beer specials!!!!! Sooooooo good. I rarely give five stars. But these are five stars I love to give. It's for the atmosphere, beverages and an amazing menu."}
{"text":"I use to love this place! Great food and staff. Well something has changed  dont get more wrong staff is still friendly. Food is very mediocre at best. Not sure if they changed cooks or what but the wings are terrible. Super gummy and even the sauce has taken  turn for the worse. Im pretty sure they are baking them first...either way 3rd time is the last time for me. I Use to tell everyone about this place to"}
{"text":"Great food here. The wings and sandwiches are excellent. I miss working in the Strip and eating here weekly. Just wish they had more specials and variety. Mmmm.....maple bacon sauce is to die for."}
{"text":"Amazing food, about as good as \"bar\" food gets. They serve delicious local pickles and have a good selection of craft beers. One of Pittsburghs best places to eat and have some beers."}
{"text":"What's with the friggin' attitude here. This place is not good enough to warrant being \"too cool for school\""}
{"text":"Always closes early, even on weekends, despite having paying customers wanting to come and buy from them. Seems kind of lame to turn people away well before the advertised closing times."}
{"text":"Huge selection of beers, friendly service, pretty average appetizers, internet jukebox, I really enjoyed myself here. There are special beers every week and it's always fun to try a new one, even if they run on the expensive side. Bar staff very friendly."}
{"text":"Good bar food. Nothing special, but low prices and decent food are all you really need for lunch in the Strip."}
{"text":"You can bacon-infuse any burger on the menu, where they add freshly ground bacon right into the ground beef before they form the burger. EXCELLENT. They only cook them one way and you have to pay $1 extra for fries instead of chips. The food Is good enough to get 3 and a half stars but their extravagant beer menu pushes it up to 4. Seems like a great place to grab some above average bar food and catch a game. I would def come here again"}
{"text":"BeerHive is a nice place to stop and enjoy a brew while walking through the Strip District.  They have a fair number of beers on tap and a refrigerator full of bottles.  The bar menu has some good sounding selections that I'd like to revisit.  I wasn't thrilled with the flavor of the maple-bacon wings (basically just topped with maple syrup and bacon crumbles), but the size and consistency of the wings were great.  Worth stopping in if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Went in on a slow day. Wife and I both ordered the same beer, and it was served warm. The bartender knew the beer was warm because she called someone to fix it, but never mentioned the cooling issue when we ordered our drink."}
{"text":"Thanks to a Google Offer that was expiring on Thursday, I made it a point to stop at the Beer Hive.  After a long day of work I was looking for some good refreshment and relaxation.  We arrived about 5:40p, just ahead of everyone else fortunately.  Got one of the tables on the main floor and our waitress promptly stopped over with menus and requests for drinks.  There was a nice chalkboard full of the craft brews on tap but I wanted to see how the staff would handle suggestions.  Without just touting a selected brew our waitress skillfully asked about preferences and current likes/dislikes.  She then made a couple of suggestions which really hit the mark.  I had an Atwater Conniption Fit, double IPA which was very good.  My son had a Draai Laag Aureus which he enjoyed.  We ordered Pretzel apps that came with a nice house made honey mustard dip.  For dinner my son had the BELT, Bacon, Egg, Lettuce, Tomato which was quite tasty and I had the pulled pork Taquitos.  Great sauces and flavor.  The atmosphere was excellent for an after work hang out and grabbing a bite to eat.  Plenty of screens to watch multiple events and a good, up to date juke.  I look forward to hitting this spot again."}
{"text":"The bartenders were super nice and the beer selection was great. We, however, did not try the food so we can not review on that. The atmosphere was friendly and welcoming. Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Love: THE PICKLES  Like: the seitan wings, the beer selection, the bathroom hall, select servers  Loathe: everything else (barring those things/people I have not experienced; not feeling the need to make a long list here and mostly wanted to share the good stuff that which is worth trying if those types of things interest you)!"}
{"text":"The Beerhive is an awesome experience!  The beer selection is absolutely stunning and the lineup changes regularly enough to keep things interesting.  The food selection is diverse and many unique dishes are offered.  The beer pairings complement the menu very well.  The owners are passionate about their business and very knowledgeable about beer.  If you are new to craft beers and need someone to brews that would fit your taste, this is the place to go!  If you are visiting from the west coast like I was and need a guide to east coast breweries, look no further than The Beerhive.  This is a must see place in the Strip District and in Pittsburgh in general!"}
{"text":"Great place for Growlers and of course The Pittsburgh Pickle Co!!!  Bloody Mary mix is excellent."}
{"text":"The beer selection at the Beer Hive is the best in the Strip. I love East End Brewery, but Beer Hive represents from local to Pacific Northwest. Beer Hive has good food! Burgers, wings, Pittsburgh Pickles. It is bar food, not \"gastropub\",  just damn good bar food. The servers do not fawn over you. They are kind of introverted. This bothered me at first. Then I started to get to know them (I've been coming here 3 months and I am also introverted), they like beer! They are actually cool! They are young. I am old. I think we will be friends some day."}
{"text":"Fried pickles nuff said! A bunch of beer. 12 on tap. Ok wine selection. Our bartender was friendly and quick! And informative as we are tourists at the moment!  Local owned by three bothers who are getting it done! Did I mention they have great fried pickles! The pickles are so good they hat and sell them!"}
{"text":"Nothing bad about it, just nothing too compelling other than the branding, they hit that spot on.  Beer gets 3 stars. Selection is decent, but for a place touting their craft beer prowess in 2012 it really isn't that impressive.  I'll give food 2.5 stars. The menu is appz, wingz, burgerz, sandiwichez, you get the deal. Prices are reasonable to moderately expensive.  My jalapeno cheddar burger was ok. Tending towards overcooked even though ordered medium, the patty was thin and chewy. The bun would have been great if not maybe a day past it's prime. The slaw was the best thing on the plate.  Service gets 3 stars. The servers were friendly enough and easy to work with, but my food took a solid 20 minutes and I was one of 3 people in the place at 5:00 on a saturday.  Sorry for the mediocre review, but I'm just not feelin it at this place."}
{"text":"As far as strip district bars, I would say this one is just average. The service was good but there was really nothing that would keep you there. I noticed that most people would come in, have one drink, and leave. They did have a good variety of local beers."}
{"text":"Some of the best wings in town! Beer selection is ridiculous. Best night to go: Wednesdays! Comedy at 8pm! $6 for a dozen wings! THIS IS TRUTH. You're welcome."}
{"text":"Okay, I am all for pun related businesses, but I have to admit, I'm not the biggest fan of the Beerhive.   I've swung by this place several times for lunch and drinks, and it's just never done it for me. It might have something to do with the decor. The interior seems very dark walking in, and not as welcoming as you think. The bar downstairs is filled with high tables, and it seems to be empty, or filled to the brim every time I go visit.   While The Beerhive has an above decent draft selection, I'm not drawn to much beyond that. The food is lackluster. On my last visit, I order the Buffalo Blue sandwich, and lost interest less than a quarter of the way in. The chicken was dry, and the flavors seemed off kilter. I did have a decent draft, but lots of bars get their beer list right.   The only thing that keeps me coming back to The Beerhive is convince from the office. I love a good pun, but I can't say I love it here."}
{"text":"The beehive looks like a typical Pittsburgh bar on the outside, but they're also a surprisingly good lunch spot. They open at 11:30 and are open on Monday which is a rarity in the Strip.  The food fantastic. I had the bacon and blue cheeseburger. It comes with two 1/4 patties handled minimally, so you can taste the beef and cooked magnificently on super high heat to form a crunchy crust without overlooking the middle. The bun, cheese, lettuce and tomato were all on point as well. I had French fries as my side for an extra $1. They were fresh cut fries with sea salt and herbs. Crunchy on the outside and soft in the middle (thank god).   Other people at my table had the Belt sandwich, chicken wings and full-on fries. The cheese on the fries was way better than expected, a smoked cheddar sauce. We had no complaints about anything.  Service was friendly and fast. I'll definitely be back often."}
{"text":"PB, Bacon, & Pickle Burger made me feel like a kid again. There was also a side of maple syrup. DELICIOUS and full of sugary goodness. The sticky pig is basically the same thing minus the burger.  They've got a nice selection of beers and the bartender was very knowledgable about what they had.  I would put this as a must visit here in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Best fried pickles in the burgh!!! Always love coming here. Friendly knowledgeable staff. Clean, great ambiance, comfortable. Great beer choices, and always something new, I like how they keep variety."}
{"text":"Ooooooh I dig this place and the location is fantastic! The strip was dying for an updated, hip place to get your brew on and the Beerhive fits in here perfectly!  Met up with some ex coworkers here last night and was so impressed by the interesting list of beers written in pastel chalk above the bar- all of which were around 8% alcohol. Hard day at the office?? You won't remember after an hour or so! The vibe is really hip, kick back and friendly and the gal behind the br is a total sweetheart. We were also super impressed with the appetizers, which take your standard bar fare up a few notches. The lettuce wraps were pretty tasty and the wings.....killer! I am dying to try the soft pretzel appetizer next time. I am a sucker for a good soft pretzel.   Only complaint- the ladies room. There is one stall and a swinging door that only covers you midsection when you pee. Thank goodness I am a short gal. The door doesn't lock well so ladies, be prepared. Otherwise I would have given 5 stars as this place is solid and I will be back, often!"}
{"text":"Yummy beer.  Yummy wings.   Seriously great selection.   Nice price point as well.  Now I do live the chips. Great choice."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite place to stop in the Strip on a saturday or sunday afternoon, mid shopping trip, to refuel and regroup with an adult beverage. What first brought me in the door a couple of years ago was the name. Honestly I did the quick glance and thought it said Beehive and it reminded me of the coffee shop that used to be in oakland during my college years so I walked in. Only after entering did I realize it said beerhive-very clever. They have a sweet draft selection-lots of good crafts on tap and they rotate fairly often. There are plenty of tvs at the bar too in order to watch whatever game you want to view. I've never had a problem grabbing some seats at the bar, but there are also some tables if that is your preference. Service has always been friendly and efficient. I have yet to eat here in all the years I've been coming to the Beerhive (usually because I'm full from getting my edgar's taco fix) but everything I have seen people order-particularly the wings and burgers-looks and smells amazing. I'd recommend stopping in for at least a beer and to rest your legs after walking the strip."}
{"text":"This was my second trip to The Beerhive during stays in Pittsburgh...loved it so much the first time we planned our trip around stopping in!  Pittsburgh is definitely not as advanced as Cbus with the microbreweries but the Beerhive has a great selection of beer on draft and in bottle.  I tried the fried pickles which are made with Pickles from the Pittsburgh Pickle Company, which I was told is also the same owners at the Beerhive.  The pickles were fantastic!  The breading was amazing as well as the dipping sauce!  We also stopped back on the way out of town to buy a few jars of the pickles...affordable and delicious!  Service was also excellent!"}
{"text":"Skip this joint, the c*nty b*tch miniature bartender and her smart ass attitude SUCK. Rather, head to one of their competitors, who'll serve you far better."}
{"text":"I had the best cider I've ever had here!  It was Woodchuck reserve pumpkin cider and they lined the rim with cinnamon and sugar.  Heaven.  Woodchuck, why don't you have this in LA?!"}
{"text":"First time here & it's amazing. I ordered some kind of peanut butter, bacon, pickle sandwich with maple syrup and it was delicious. Beer is great. Service is great. This place is packed and we still got our food pretty fast. Must stop!"}
{"text":"Seemed like a cool place. Sat a table waited 20 minutes as waitress waited on table next to us-decided to get a beer directly from the bar, only one bartender-another 20 minutes tried numerous times to get the attention of the over worked waitress, to no avail as she waited on only one or two other tables.  My starving and thirsty party of 6 took our $100's to another place down the block and over tipped our server there."}
{"text":"In the summer heat this is a great little getaway. It has perfect cool temperatures and low lighting. The servers are nice. Best of all they have Pittsburgh Pickles."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a place to stop for a quick beer after a day of shopping in the strip, this is the place!  Great selection of craft and local beers."}
{"text":"When I visited Pittsburgh first thing I did was visit the Strip District. Mid-Afternoon hit and I was feeling pretty hungry and since I was on vacation I wanted a beer as well. Beerhive looked like the perfect solution and overall it satisfied my needs.   Beerhive is a small hole in the wall joint with a decent beer selection and your standard bar food options. I don't remember which draft beers I had, but I enjoyed them. Looked like a good bottle selection as well. Went with cheese sticks and chicken tenders for food. Neither was outstanding but it tasted better than typical bar food. The chicken tenders had a pretty unique breading which I liked. The cheese sticks come with a spicy marinara sauce. There was only one waitress/bartender working, she was nice and did a good job of checking back with us.  If I lived in Pittsburgh, the Beerhive isn't a place that I would go out of my way for, but if you are visiting the Strip District and are looking for a bite or a drink, its a good place to stop in."}
{"text":"Stopped in here while checking out the strip district and ordered a bloody mary after some ladies outside were giving out samples of delicious pickles.  Unfortunately the pickles in the bloody mary were different, but the bloody was still good and spicy."}
{"text":"Open 7 days a week! The Beerhive is a wonderful locals' spot in the Historic Strip District of Pittsburgh. The staff is absolutely fantastic, the beer selection is  top-notch, and the menu is some damn fine bar fare - including great variety of wings sauces and solid vegetarian pub food selections."}
{"text":"Got overcharged here by the bartender during happy hour. Bartenders were more interested in their own conversation than serving my party and I. Place is dirty and unorganized. Also, for a place called Beerhive they had a really poor tap selection and everything was overpriced. There are far better options for a beer in the strip like Rolands and even Bella Notte."}
{"text":"This is a fun little spot in the Strip District. They are small but have an up stairs for extra seating and private events in case you need the space. We were here for a private yelp event but did get to enjoy the bar afterwards.   They hold a trivia night every friday and I believe we went on a wednesday when they had stand-up mic night. All the tables and bar were filled but we managed to squeeze in at a table with some strangers. They were nice enough to share especially since they were at a 4 seated table and it was only the two of them. We ordered wings that night since they were half off. They were great too, awesome sauce choices and they weren't dry at all. It did take them a while to get cooked though, like 20 minutes which i thought was long for wings. I figured it was because of the crowd that they were a little slow. They have a unique menu here with foods I've never known like Seitan. It's some kind of bread sponge material, idk but i had it on a taco and it was pretty amazing.   We stayed for about an hour listening to some stand up comedians which were decent. It was my first time getting to see improv comedy from local artist. And there was no charge for this event either which was pretty awesome. I like that they have cool events they put together that make your experience here better than just an average bar hop.   Good fun, nice people, service was ok and of course, planned entertainment!!"}
{"text":"I belong to a MeetUp group called \"Strange Brew\". We're a group of craft beer enthusiest who get together once a month and we each bring a beer that, hopefully, no one has tried before (that's the challenge, finding one during the weeks leading up to our MeetUp).   We alternate between two establishments and tonight it was the BeerHive. As always, the waitstaff was extremely courteous and attententive, the beer list is impressive, and the atmosphere is comfortable and clean.  I like it here.   Since we always meet on a Tuesday, I always get the Taco Tuesday Special when I'm here -- four beef taco's.  Don't think Taco Bell, these tacos have dressed to please.  I never walk away hungry.    If you're in the Strip and looking for a good beer joint with good food I would highly recommend the BeerHive."}
{"text":"I love that they sell Pittsburgh Pickle Co. Pickles!  For a small place in the Strip, the bottle selection is decent, but I was hoping for a few more drafts in a place called The BeerHive.  Their happy hours and weekly specials are pretty good though.  I was in on Taco Night and was pleasantly surprised.  It's a good amount of food and I couldn't eat all four.  The Seitan Tacos were piled!  As a happy meat eater, I was loving the veggie take on the meat - smoky and spicy and crunchy!"}
{"text":"I've read a lot on Yelp about this place previously and it just happened we were in the neighborhood on a very hot day in need of a cold one. It's very nice inside. Nice big bar, attentive bartender and good atmosphere.   Then I checked the 12 tap list. My expectations weren't exactly realized here. Of the 12 taps, 3 were ciders and 1 was Yuengling. I actually understand you have Yuengling on tap during Stanley Cup Playoff Hockey, so they get a free pass on that one. The 3 Ciders - I could see 1, definitely not 3. It's a craft beer bar. The only IPA on their list was a Blood Orange one. They had 2 pale ales and I tried one of those. It was ok. My husband got the only IPA. I tried that, too. Neither beer would be on my list for a 2nd. They have bottles & cans  but I have those at home.   I expected a bar with some similarities to Independent Brewing. It's looks like that's what they're trying to achieve but for now it's just ok."}
{"text":"Beerhive is OK.   There was absolutely no seating, and no help finding any. Service was slow, for one beer and one app.  The beers are definitely on the high end. $10 for Framboise Lambic, my usual beer, averages $8 in pittsburgh, at places that aren't focused on brews. So I expected a little bit cheaper beers. The food -- It smelled good but only about 1/3 of my sweet potato fries were edible. The man next to me asked if they were good, I couldn't lie...I didn't recommend them, unless he was a few more beers deeper than myself."}
{"text":"I can hear your internal monologues as I write this...\"Darren, why did you go to The Beerhive? You're a teetotaler!\"   Beer's not all that can be had at the 'Hive, my friends.   Aside from pleasant conversations with lovely barmaids, one can have his or herself a very capable French-style, double-patty, 1/4 pound burger in 9 clever variations.   Before catching Kreator and Overkill at Altar Bar, I was scanning The Strip District and realized I had never been to Beerhive. Since I'm eternally chasing fresh Yelp material, I decided to spin the wheel.   I made it clear to the alluring, tastefully-inked blonde woman behind the counter that I was hungry and had a concert to attend. She smiled, sliding a menu in front of me, seemingly relieved that I wasn't going to be an obnoxious, drunken lecher who would creep around for too long.   Confessing just a minute before that Poison and Bon Jovi are as hard-hitting as it gets for her, she asked innocently, \"Does that music, that heavy metal, does it get you charged and pumped up?\"   \"Absolutely,\" I answered with a glint in my eyes.   So did the Maple Bacon Burger. Served with exactly what its title suggests, I added bacon, cheddar, l-t-o, mayonnaise, and a fried egg to the setlist and came out with something that nourished me throughout the raging, strident, technically masterful aggrofest that went down that evening. Syrup tangled with the juices of the savory beef while the over-hard egg truly turned night and day and dinner and breakfast upside down and inside out. Replacing the fine bun with pancakes and the chips with homefries was the only thing left to do to make this sunrise-after-sunset meal completely \"first watch\" material. A helping of ideally crunchy housemade potato chips and a smash of a sweet pickle complimented the burger agreeably. The latter, a wet obelisk of cured cucumber, had herbs stuck to it and came from a place called the Pittsburgh Pickle Company.   \"Have fun, and be safe. I hope your show rocks,\" the Angel of the Mead said to me as I settled up.   \"Oh I will, and it will,\" I told her, grinning. What this innocent lass didn't know...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ycb5S2kqPs"}
{"text":"The beerhive was a little misleading of a name. I expected bees or at least people wearing bee outfits to serve me beer. Nope. None of it.   Bad dad jokes aside, I had an alright time at the Beerhive. If there is something the name alludes to that it didn't deliver, it was the beer selection. Figured it be a bit larger and more extensive. It's not small nor bad, but not what I've come to expect for a place that would boast such a moniker.    If you're along the strip here, this is one of the better options."}
{"text":"One of our favorite places to go in the Strip. They rotate their beer selections with new products after a keg has been kicked and try to never have the same beer twice.  Have a huge cooler with bottles from all over so if you like micro - brews this is a great place to chill.   Another perk is that they have fantastic food,  especially wings. Love their maple bacon and lime cilantro flavors the best and they make their own dill ranch...stuff friggin is awesome."}
{"text":"Fun, Fun, Fun!  Thursday night Trivia.  It can get a little crowded but Trivia is always fun.  This is a nice bar with about 12 craft beers on tap and lots more in bottles - I think they do growlers.  Had to try the wings and ordered Buffalo.   The wings were crispy but needed a little more buffalo heat.  The blue cheese dressing was ranch with crumbled blue cheese on top, not the way I prefer.  Lots of TV's to watch if you are interested.  Was told that Wednesday's is comedy night."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my first Beerhive experience.  The beer selection is very good, not great like some make it out to be, but very good none the less (too many overly hoppy beers).  The food is pretty good, for bar food.  I had the jalepeno and cheddar burger, and it was really good!  The bartender must have been new and new to the whole industry.  She was very nice and attentive, but didn't really know what she was doing.  We ordered an appetizer that came out with our food, not a fan of that happening.  All in all a good place that I like and will, without a doubt, go back."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were walking down the strip on a Saturday for a place to enjoy a light lunch and some beer and we stumbled on a sign that said \"BEERHIVE LET IT BEER: BEATLES AND BEER ALL DAY\".  We instantly walked in and were greeted right away with fantastic, knowledgeable service and great food.    There was an aged-Southern Tier Pumking on tap (in March) that was phenomenal and a blueberry bottled beer from Blue Dog Brewing that our bartender (who ended up being the owner to our surprise) suggested and we thoroughly enjoyed it.   I suggest this bar to anyone that is looking for a laid-back setting with great product and non-snob knowledge.  The perfect place to stop while shopping in the strip!"}
{"text":"Awesome samplers. Small place but good atmosphere. Staff was attentive and polite. The menu looked good, with a nice variety. $15 for 6 beer sampler is a good amount. All of the beer tasted good, not skunked or like the lines needed cleaned. Would go back again :)"}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I've had in Pittsburgh!  The burgers are the smashed flat with crispy edges type. Yet they still managed to be super juicy and came with excellent house cut fries.   Nicely varied beer selection as well."}
{"text":"I like the name, and the location is in an accessible part of the strip.  Truthfully, this place is 3* right now because there's not much to make it \"stand out,\" but based on my talks with the owner, they'll be a 4 or 5 star establishment in no time.  They have a good beer selection.  Not a ton of crazy beers, but there's more than enough to appeal to your average good beer drinker.  It's nowhere near Fatheads, Rolands, or Smoking Joes, though, and not many seasonals.  They also sell growlers.    The food selection is bar-type food, and I didn't have a chance to try it, but it was an interesting menu.  They have a solid list of unique wing flavors, and a few other items that will have me go back.  Prices are affordable, and there are plenty of TVs for sports.  So, the reason for the 4 stars...after talking with the owner, they have some ambitious plans that I really like.  One...they want to start a Bloody Mary bar, and they have the perfect space for it.  Two...they're going to start breakfast/brunch, with chicken & waffles and \"upscale\" breakfast food.  Three...they're going to start carrying unique firkins, as well as consider beer cocktails.   If any of these things happen, it'll become a great place to visit in the strip."}
{"text":"They carry a nice selection of pours with a bar menu that goes beyond the typical. For instance, the deep fried pickles. The pickles served here are from Pittsburgh Pickle Company and the breading is seasoned perfectly, fried lightly and juicy with Pickle flavor. The vast selection of pours makes it easy to pair with snacks on the menu."}
{"text":"How can you not be drawn in, just by the name alone!  Clever, fo sho!  So once you're drawn in, what are you drawn to?  In keeping with the seasonal theme, I ordered the Southern Tier Pumpking Ale.  Delish, as always. They have about 12 or so beers on tap that's clearly written up on a big chalkboard above the bar.  I'm into bars that have a wide variety on tap.  I can't stand when you go somewhere and all they have is Miller and Coors Light.  But for a name like the BeerHive, they really should have more to offer!  They also have a big refrigerator with a whole lotta specialty beers to pick from.  You can either pick up a beer and drink it there or take out for a \"night cap\" at home.    For \"bar food\" the food is pretty decent!  Sticking with the hive part of beer they have a lot of honey type concoctions.  We opted to try a couple wing flavors, as they all looked pretty yummy.  We tried the salt n' vinegar, honey bbq, ranch and buffalo.  I really enjoyed the salt n' vinegar, being a huge vinegar fan!  I also thought the honey bbq was pretty good.  We also ordered I REALLY enjoyed the honey bites, mini cinnamon pretzels with honey drizzled on top.  YUM-O!   They have a lot of different specials, including $1 off beers and $3 apps.  The HH special for beers isn't too great, but I love a good deal on food too, so it balances out!  They also have a special armature comedy night.  I think that would be an interesting thing to see, laugh at them or laugh with them?  We'll see!"}
{"text":"They use to have a HUGE beer selection upstairs, but when I came in this time all they had was two small cases downstairs. I am very disappointed. And beers only come chilled now. If I am shopping and can't keep the beers chilled, then they get warm. The bartender assured me going from chilled to warm then chilled again is no issue, but I know better. That disappointed me."}
