{"text":"Amazing food, great customer service. Husband & wife are always very pleasant and the food is always fresh, I recommend this place to anyone that wants authentic Chinese food as a fast food"}
{"text":"This place is the real deal. Orange chicken is the best I ever had like the drake song. Fried won tons woooooh! Give this place a try highly recommend"}
{"text":"I ordered the following:  Shrimp Fried Rice, Curry Chicken/Chow Mein Combo, and two orders of Crab Wontons.  The Shrimp Fried Rice was Burned -- the smell and taste and just looking at the egg and the tip of the grains were complete proof of this -- the Curry Chicken was all sauce and no veggies -- barely any chicken -- and the Chow Mein was not Chow Mein, but Lo Mein. Believe me, I know most people get this wrong, but there is a difference.  And on top of all of this, they failed to bring any chopsticks. WHO EATS RICE OR NOODLES WITHOUT CHOPSTICKS?  And all of this was for....I don't know, like 26 or 27 dollars? I can't really say for sure. They failed to even bring me a reciept.  Sigh....I really think I should apply to work there in their kitchen. I may be just a simple white, American girl, but I know how to cook REAL Chinese food. I used to work in a Chinese Kitchen. And I was trained by real Chinese Chefs.   Big Bowl,. if you are reading this: YOU NEED ME IN YOUR KITCHEN.    Anyways, enough about me disappointing experience. Carry on.   -Jadis"}
{"text":"I have been receiving delivery service from this restaurant for more than 10 years and the service is always the same - wonderful & great!  The food is always warm, delicious and reasonably priced... I love the friendliness of the staff and of the people who deliver your food, and of course - I especially love it when they remember our name!  Sometimes they even include frozen desert at no charge, I mean - who does that in these days? At the end of the year, they give out free calendars to their customers!  If you love great food at a decent price and good, down-home friendliness - then this is your place!  Enjoy!!!  =)"}
{"text":"I lived in the far east for years, half my family is chinese. The Chinese say my cooking is better than the restaurants. I ordered pork fried rice, lemon chicken, and a sweet and sour lunch special. The worst \"Chinese food\" I ever ate. There was a sign help wanted in the window, I know why. I will never go back."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch because we were in the area and felt like having Chinese food. The Yelp write ups were good for the place. I ordered hot and sour soup and a small house lo Mein. My husband ordered lemon chicken. It had been a long time since either of us had ordered that dish. The lemon chicken was outstanding, and the portion was generous.  The soup had large, tasty shrimp, along with a variety of vegetables. The lo mein had the same shrimp. The whole meal was reasonably priced and the service was very fast. We would return here again."}
{"text":"Small, clean restaurant with nothing fancy going on. The food is tasty though, and the staff friendly. The House Special Lo Mein is really delicious. The prices are a little high, and portions are fairly small. I like it enough however, to order takeout somewhat frequently. The egg rolls taste great, even if they have a bit more cabbage in them than I would prefer. I wish their was a better selection of dim sum type of offerings. Overall though, it's pretty good, especially for take out."}
{"text":"This is a little gem. Found this by seeing it on Yelp.  The restaurant had been in business for 20 years serving Taiwanese-influenced Chinese dishes. The dishes we had were ask very fresh with the vegetables bring crispy and full of taste.  Great egg drop soup, lovely crab puffs, and a good array of starters. The main course dishes were really very good and served by a friendly and enthusiastic owner and his lovely wife.  The prices and portions were very reasonable.  I recommend the Snow White Chicken, which had a delightful garlic flavor.  The Mu Shu Pork was a winner and I now look forward to trying some of their battered dishes next time.  Be sure to ask then for their home made mustard!"}
{"text":"After reading reviews, decided to try this little place. Yes, they folks were friendly; yes, the place was fairly clean; yes, the service was pretty quick; and yes, the prices and variety are relatively impressive for a small establishment. Unfortunately there was just that little smell of used grease in the air and on the bags when I got everything home...I found everything just a bit \"heavy\". Seems they are generous with the grease, including in the egg drop soup and egg rolls. My rumbly tummy told me we most likely won't go back. Sorry."}
{"text":"Food and customer service are always on point this place has been around for about 25 years longer than I have been alive. Their pot stickers and crab puffs are the best in town check them out"}
{"text":"I've been going here for years, and I LOVE this place! Really fresh, delicious food; amazing variety, and super friendly owners. The prices are good too. I can feed four people for around $35, and have plenty of leftovers. The delivery is nice too when I don't feel like leaving the house. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Really good food!  Very impressed with the overall cleanliness too.  Definitely try this spot!  We almost ordered more food when we picked up our to go order. The pics of other foods looked great too."}
{"text":"The sesame chicken was flavorful hot and fresh. The fried rice was very bland. For the price the portions were amazing as was the service. I think next time I will try the lomien instead of rice. Ooh the spring rolls were delicious."}
{"text":"On the surface Big Bowl is your typical family owned local Chinese place but it's my favorite. You'll find the standard fast-Chinese-food fare on the menu, plus a lot of extras. Their Boba Tea is great, and they offer ramen and tofu choices as well. The portions are big and the service is super friendly. If you can, save yourself time and go in to order, rather than relying on delivery. They're quick either way, but the owners are so happy to see you, it makes your meal taste so much better!  Compared to other local places like House of Egg Roll, Big Bowl has bigger portions, comparable prices, and lots of extras."}
{"text":"This is my new go-to restaurant for great Chinese fast food.  When we pulled up to the restaurant I will admit we had some trepidation - the sign was washed out from the sun on one side and the parking lot was empty.    When we entered the woman at the counter was incredibly welcoming and excited to take our order.  My girlfriend ordered Iced Tea.   The restaurant brewed hot tea and then poured it over ice!  Incredible!  We ordered fried pork wonton, egg rolls, sweet and sour pork and mongolian beef (extra spicy).  As we sat down and waitied for our food, many orders were coming in over the phone and people were dropping in to pick up their food.  That made me feel a little better because we were still sitting in an empty restaurant.  THE FOOD ARRIVES!  All the food was placed in to-go boxes, and we could serve ourselves on styrofoam plates.  The sweet and sour pork was crispy, and the mongolian beef was spicy.  Large pieces of beef that I really enjoyed.  All of the vegetables were at the top of the container, so really get in there to get a mix of everything.   The egg rolls were pretty standard, and it really takes a lot for an egg roll to wow me.  Pork wontons were crispy and delicious.  The walls are decorated with A ratings from the health department.  They are very proud of them.  I'm so happy we took the word of other yelpers and gave this place a try.  We'll probably choose pick up or delivery in the future though - even though we enjoyed our dine-in experience, we were alone in there for most of our meal."}
{"text":"My co worker got me addicted to this place after bringing me a lunch special from them. I now go here at least once a week.  Veggies are always fresh and crisp! Staff is very friendly and really appreciate you coming in which makes me enjoy my food even more!"}
{"text":"Best wonton soup anywhere and extremely friendly and quick delivery!!!!"}
{"text":"best cashew shrimp...fits this pregnant lady's cravings 100 percent..they are also the sweetest people. they gave my 1yr old a fortune cookie and he couldnt stop smiling !"}
{"text":"I ordered General Tso's chicken with fried rice and a spring roll. When the delivery came it was some sort of deep fried chicken that was definitely not General Tso's and did not taste good at all. It was also brown rice not fried rice and the spring roll was completely Bland. I called to tell them they got my order wrong and they told me I must be mistaken and insisted it was right. Needless to say I got nowhere and will never order from this place again."}
{"text":"Well, I'm impressed. Last night l, I probably had one of the best sweet & sour chicken I've had in ages!   Last night my husband and I decided we wanted to eat out but somewhere close to us in Mesa. I was particularly in the mood for Chinese food. Having checked the reviews for a lot of Chinese restaurants in the area before, I wasn't expecting to find Big Bowl! How did I miss it before?? So we called them to make sure they are indeed open till 9:30pm and that they would accommodate us if we arrived at 8:45pm and they said yes. So we headed there and we were on time. The owner greeted us and showed us the menu options on display in beautiful pictures on the order counter. We ordered beef Lo main combo and a sweet and sour chicken combo. Everything tasted delicious. The spring rolls, the sauce, the chicken, all great and the portion size was so big, we left stuffed!   I must say, the owners are very nice and very proud of the quality of their food and now that I've tried the food, I know why. They have free delivery by the way to close locations too!   We're coming back for sure and recommending it to family and friends. Definitely worth trying!"}
{"text":"Great food, great prices, and great service.  I am a big eater and could not even finish all my food for only 8 dollars.   The orange chicken was fresh and tender with excellent flavor.  The combo also came with fried wantons and spring rolls.  Super far from my house, but worth the drive."}
{"text":"For a fast food Chinese restaurant. I have not had better.  The food was fresh, hot and the service was quick.  The owners greeted us, took our order, prepared the food then brought it to our table.  The portions were great and the price was fair. Food and drink for 2 was less than 20 bucks. Awesome place!!!!"}
{"text":"Moved here from Indiana over a year ago & have passed this restaurant several thousand times. Egg Roll,House Lo Mein,House Fried Rice & Egg Drop Soup very good. I'm going to work my way through the menu. Owner very nice. 25 years same spot...I'm a Bonified Foodie. This is Excellent..."}
{"text":"Excellent service and the food was far better than anything else in the area. Chicken was breaded perfectly and had perfect texture, spring rolls were fabulous, sauces weren't too sweet or salty and the place was clean!! Eat here, you won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"The best food around!!! I eat here at least once a week! Clean restaurant with nice staff. Free delivery if you live close enough and the food always come hot! Love big bowl so much I bring all my friends here and then they become regulars!"}
{"text":"Very hard to find an egg drop soup that I like, and I was so pleased to be able to find it at Big Bowl. Their combination plate is a deal - comes with so much food for such a good price."}
{"text":"I called Big Bowl recently to place a delivery order. We don't live terribly far away and i don't usually ask for delivery but i was sick with a horrible cold and the last thing i wanted to do was make dinner or go get something. I called an hour before their closing time that is stated on here. First call just rang and rang. Second time i called a woman answered and when i asked if i could place a delivery order she became rude and said i don't know hold on, put me on hold and not a minute later i was hung up on. I tried calling back two times and with no answer. I will never be giving Big Bowl my business again."}
{"text":"The guy who runs this (Alan?) is not only really nice but pretty funny! Their food is always fresh and tasty, but they make it quick and deliver it fast.   Great food at a great price!"}
{"text":"This place was delicious and I got what I felt was like a lot of food. I'm really full is what I'm trying to say. The food was fresh and reasonably priced. All the people in my party were satisfied with their food as well and we all remarked that we looked forward to returning."}
{"text":"My family and I order from here a lot and the orange chicken is my favorite it is so good!!  I went to go order from there tonight (Sunday ) the hours are supposed to be 12- 9 pm and they were closed and this isn't he first time this has happened it seems like it happens a lot.."}
{"text":"Everything a you could want from a neighborhood Chinese Food spot!   The owners are always here and extremely nice. The food is fast, and super tasty.   Big Bowl reminds me of an East Coast takeout spot.   Love it."}
{"text":"Very tasty food. Fast service. The owner was very nice. Will def come here again. Seven of us ate here for 40.00 the portions were just right. We tried shrimp and chicken lo mein and beef and broccoli and the mushroom chicken. The outside looks old and run down, but the inside is clean. What really impressed me was all the A ratings in the doors"}
{"text":"The husband and wife owners are both so kind, friendly and welcoming. That right there is huge for an Asian food establishment. This was my second visit to this awesome Chinese food joint and definitely will not be my last. First time I came here, my food was made fresh to order and amazing. This time around we ordered kung pao chicken and chicken broccoli combo dinners. These include egg drop soup, 2 wontons, fried rice and a veggie spring roll...for only $8.45 a meal. The food was great! The broccoli was fresh, the sides were excellent, the fried rice that comes with the combo is a huge amount and really great too. All in all, the quality of ingredients the fact that their food is not overly greasy and good  cuts of meat along with the absolute friendliest customer service makes this one of our new favorite Chinese joints. The owners have Huskies also, we have two Husky breed dogs too so it makes for a fun conversation while waiting for the talented kitchen to freshly prepare your great meals :)"}
{"text":"I dont really get why everyone has given such a high ratings. My food was edible at best, service was friendly, fast and hot. Food was not good though, id recommend going elsewhere unless youre just getting their wonton soup."}
{"text":"Always drive past here since I live down the street tonight decided to try this place omg so good fresh quality food. They are super friendly here. I will be coming back"}
{"text":"I did not eat in this establishment, but I have in the past.  The staff are very welcoming, and eager to assist you with making your choices.  Tonight, I completed a delivery order.  They have small portions (pint), combo, and family size quarts to choose from.  We purchased 1 order of crab puffs ($4.85) which was 6 total; pint of Orange Chicken ($5.85), pint of Kung Pao Shrimp ($6.55); pint of Assorted Vegetables in garlic sauce ($5.25).  The gentleman who took our order was cheerful, read back my order, and my credit card number to me.  He provided the total and told me 30 minutes.  It took less than 30 minutes, and the person who delivered by order was the same man.  He again was courteous, read the order one more time, and was just all around pleasant.  The ingredients appeared to be fresh, the veggies were crisp, and there was just the right about of breading on the orange chicken.  It appeared to be a more health conscious then the last time I ate there."}
{"text":"I want to say it's very good, but I only ever get the teryaki chicken bowl or the pork fried rice. It always tastes great, I wish they had more customers. The only thing that makes this place with 4/5 stars is that it looks a little sketchy."}
{"text":"Great food. Good prices especially at lunch. The food is fresh and the service is excellent. This is now my favorite Chinese takeout place in the area. I usually go to Phoenix for food but now I have found a place in Mesa."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been eating here for years! Once you find the best why go anywhere else! They have excellent prices. And the biggest best shrimp we've ever had. My favorite is the egg drop soup. My husband's favorite is the house fried rice."}
{"text":"cheap food but so delicious.....cooked perfectly Thanks ALLEN"}
{"text":"So friendly and so good! My husband has been raving about this place since we moved from Arcadia and had to leave behind our last \"favorite\" spot.   He was spot on with his recommendation and we will be back!"}
{"text":"Friendly fast service! Great food!! Will be coming back. I had the lunch special with Mongolian beef and was completely satisfied with my portion size and the flavor of the food."}
{"text":"Very good tasty food. Have excellent gradings and had to try and happy I did. Great taste,great food,very fresh made when ordered. Greeted with great energy."}
{"text":"Excellent quality, nice amount of food, good prices...you'll find it all here. We ordered Kung Pao, Cashew Chicken & Garlic Chicken w/veggies...all of it was perfectly prepared. We ate here twice in less than a week; first time carry-out & next time we sat inside. It was clean & the owner actually waited on us. He was super friendly & very appreciative that we ate at his restaurant. We'll definitively be back!"}
{"text":"This little hole-in-the-wall is a great find!  It doesn't look like much on the outside, but the food was great, and the prices were very reasonable.    I ordered the teriyaki chicken combo, which came with fried rice, crab wontons, spring rolls, and egg drop soup.  Even with a large drink it was still only $9.50.  I made two full meals out of it with more leftover.  I was able to choose between white and dark meat for the teriyaki.  The sauce was tasty, and everything was cooked fresh to order.  The wontons were still dripping and steaming hot from the fryer, and the fried rice was filled with fresh-cut veggies.  The egg drop soup was kind of a miss for me.  I thought it was a little bland, but everything else more than made up for it.  The couple that owns it seems to be the only staff, and they were very courteous, polite, and genuinely made me feel valued.  The place was dead, which was a little sad to see, but it made for a pleasant, quiet meal.    I'm glad to finally find decent teriyaki in the neighborhood, and I will most definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"One meal and I'm sold. This is where I'm getting Chinese takeout every time. The food was great all around. Big portions, outstanding quality for big dinner combos in the $9 range.   The interior and location are a little scruffy. Who cares. Friendly staff, great cheap Chinese. I'm done going to the black-and-white bear/not bear."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I highly enjoy coming here - the owners are very friendly, and excited to see us. Everything we have tried so far we have been wowed by, even though the general appearance of the store might suggest it to be sub-par, that's definitely not the case.  If you're shy or don't like being around people, I definitely suggest dining in. They play pop music most of the time, and it's almost always empty inside - everyone calls on their order for delivery, or they come to pickup food and leave."}
{"text":"This restaurant is very close to my home, and, years ago, I had the most delicious Orange Chicken here. When I moved to my current location I was pleased to note how close I am to Big Bowl! So, I went there, a couple years ago, now. Just finishing my meal, I looked down and saw a short black, very straight hair. I really wanted Chinese food tonight, and ordered potstickers, spring rolls, and House special lo mein. I was so disappointed with EVERYTHING!  The potstickers tasted like they were made out of plastic. The wrap on the spring rolls were overcooked, and so thick it was hard to bite through. The lo mein was scorched, and appeared to be regular spaghetti, with very little taste. The shrimp was also overcooked, and tough. I SO wanted to write a raving review, as the owner and his wife are such sweet people! I can't imagine why I would ever chance to try Big Bowl again."}
{"text":"I have been ordering from Big Bowl for over 15 years (except when they where closed due to kitchen fire). The food is consistently good, portions are awesome!!! Have I had a couple of meals that were wrong? yep, but hey, we are all human right? and Alan (the owner) is a terrific guy, very nice!!!"}
{"text":"I'm a really picky eater and hands down my favorite food is Big Bowl. The Big Bowl Special has the most phenomenal chicken. All white meat, tender, with the perfect amount of delicious sauce. My husband gets the Hunan Chicken and it's really delicious as well. All in all this is my favorite, favorite place to eat! I crave it if I go too long without it. Love!"}
