{"text":"i don't know why it's not posting my full review but I'll sum it up with this:  i've been a few times to give it a fair chance, over priced, dry tasteless food bad service. won't be going back"}
{"text":"Some of the best basic hot wings in the world.  Though still holding a grudge for them not serving me and my wife's cousin (who just landing from England for my wedding) for being too drunk, hadn't had a drink at that point."}
{"text":"Love the Tara! Staff is always friendly and the wings are great. I'm a big fan of the Irish Breakfast on the weekend too!"}
{"text":"Heard about its Irish Breakfast sometime ago and been wanting to try it for awhile now. 

In reality however, I had some time to kill in the area before work started so I figured I'd finally make the plunge and try out Zen. To my utter dismay and disappointment, Zen didn't open until 12 (it was around 10:00) so I made the brief trek to Tara Inn after wasting some time in a Shoppers Drug Mart.

Went in and ordered their Irish Breakfast which consisted of 2 eggs, 2 sausages, 2 rashers, 2 small pieces of black pudding, a slice of grilled tomato, a small cup of baked beans, 2 pieces of soda bread, a potato scone, and coffee/tea. 

When I got my plate of food, I proceeded to chow down. While nothing really struck out at me at amazing, it was still a good amount of food given the price (~$9). I found myself using the scone and soda bread to go with everything since they were a nice neutral starch (not too sweet). It wasn't bad. It was a decent, honest unpretentious breakfast. The atmosphere was fairly laidback and relaxing as well. By the end of it, I found myself comfortably full.

It looked like they had a decent amount of beers on tap as well (although I wasn't going to try any seeing as it wasn't even noon yet)."}
{"text":"Definitely a gem in Scarborough, wings are great and the beer is cold. Love this pub."}
{"text":"the wings are great. very meaty and crispy. steak and mushroom pie was also quite good.
however, the service was pretty bad. guests that are not regulars get ignored... 
the whole place was filthy too.
i visited 3 times for the wings, and then discovered the other tara inn on kingston rd which had the same tasty wings (no specials), with a much better atmosphere."}
{"text":"the wings are meaty and crispy. however, unlike the eglinton tara inn, there are no special deals.
service was quite good, and overall atmosphere was welcoming.
if the price is not a deciding factor, definitely visit this one instead of the eglinton one for good service"}
{"text":"I went to visit this spot after reading about it on the Internet. Upon entry it was jam packed with people standing around. My friend and I waited for 15 mins at the bar, waitress and bartender were busy and we understood. We waited, and noticed they offered to serve drinks and took the order for another man in the corner that just arrived. We thought maybe they didn't see us. We waited.. 5 more mins later they greeted another few guests, taking their drink orders while waiting for a table. Taking glances at us as they move and back and forth in front of us while we continued sitting at the bar. Roughly 30 mins later, not a hello or a smile, and 3-4 groups of guests later that was greeted which came after us, we realized we were not going to get even a smile. Reason? We didn't fit in very well I suppose with our skin colors. Sad this kind of discrimination happens in Scarborough. Highly disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem!!!!! Their wings are out of this world amazing!!! And I just fell in love with their cheesecake!!! I have had a few things off their menu and I am never disappointed! Great place honestly!"}
{"text":"The entire plaza where this place is located is infested with cockroaches and bed bugs.  I had lunch there a while back and during the half hour I was there, I came out with three very large bed bug bites."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and love the place. Great staff. Great food. Some of the best wings I have ever had.

Only complaint is if you get one of the daily specials and don't finish it you can't pack up the rest. It's unfortunate they would rather waste f"}
{"text":"WEDNESDAYS ARE HALF PRICE WING NIGHTS!!! Great wing and beer place! 

They have all your Molson products including Guinness on tap. Their wings are ao big and crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside it makes me not go to Wild Wings and St.Louis. They don't have those a hundred and some flavors rhough so please settle with the basics like hot, medium, mild? Honey garlic , teriyaki etc. 

They're limited with seating especially on a Wednesdays .. be prepared to wait at least half an hour (unless there's a snow storm or something). But it's worth it. 

Service is great  if you go there oftrn (like me) they will know you by name and how you like your food and what you drink. It's a great casual chill spot. 

Environment is an Irish pub. Not the cleanest newest looking pub but thats when you know It's not a franchise and good is good :)"}
{"text":"I was really disappointed with the food here. The atmosphere was nice and the staff friendly, but I probably would not return for the food alone. 

We came to watch a Jays game and the atmosphere for watching sports was a little disappointing for a pub. They have one large screen but the other smaller auxiliary screens are not in great locations, almost as if they are there for the staff and not the patrons. So I would not recommend this place for sports viewing.

I might return to have some beers with friends, as the setting seems perfect for that, but not for the food or sports.

Also, I ordered the famous wings that people seem to rave about and honestly was not that impressed, sure they were decent, but nothing to write home about. Maybe my expectations were raised on account of so many yelpers preaching the wings. Perhaps it was just a bad wing day, who knows. Take it or leave it."}
{"text":"Great food and service...lil bit over rated and expensive  . I had the chicken pot pie. It was vary good, portion were on the small side for $16+tax. All in all decent."}
{"text":"Went for dinner on a Monday night. It wasn't busy, but the only tables for 2 were awkwardly placed where the dancefloor would be, in the middle of the room. We opted for seating in bar area which was also awkward. These tables are truly only meant for drinks; very small, but others managed to squeeze 2 plates on them, so we did the same. 

The beer selection was terrible; I had set the bar higher since it was an Irish pub. They had all the usual suspects, Guinness(I guess that counts) and no local beer.

I got the Fish & Chips and Dad went with Bangers & Mash. He said his was good, but the portion was a little smaller than he expected. My fish had thick batter and the fries were blah.

The service was great. Both servers we had were pretty cool. The place looked like it was full of regulars. Judging by the other tables, the food is not what draws people here: it's the drinks!"}
{"text":"First time in an Irish pub and it was at a work all-expense paid party with platters of wings, several flavours, set out on a potluck style table and all-you-can-drink full bar. I ordered a couple daiquiris, Stella beer and a rum coke and they were all delicious. The waiter service was friendly and efficient, the ambience was relaxed (a bit loud though, but expected), and its quite a spacious place. It's a good space for small groups but also large parties."}
{"text":"3.5* really but I'm feeling generous.

Good wings; we went on a half price special night too. Any place that has a \"half price wings day\" is a good place in my books.

It's a pretty typical bar/pub but something about the layout is really cool. Took a while to get served at some points but it did seem to be a bit of a busy night so I can forgive that."}
{"text":"We just ate there for the first time, for breakfast. Other than long wait times, we were impressed.

There were plenty of options, and the portions were VERY plentiful at a very respectable price.

I got the \"Canadian\" breakfast... 3 eggs, 2 sausages, 5 or 6 strips of bacon, a side of baked beans, a large amount of home fries, 2 slices of bread, a thick grilled tomato slice, and unlimited coffee/tea. I think it was like $6.75

My friends got a similar breakfast plate, but instead of bacon and sausages, it came with an 8oz steak and a ton of saut√©ed mushrooms and onions. I think theirs was $8.25 each. They liked it all, and said the steak was very tasty, and was properly cooked to the level they requested.

The eggs were very large and well cooked. The bacon was crisp and delicious. The baked beans were quite nice. The home fries were interesting -- they weren't like \"deep fried\" home fries like some other places, but more just small chunks of soft potatoes, but still tasted nice. The grilled tomato was a nice touch, and had good flavour. The coffee was fine -- I'm far from a \"coffee snob\" so to me, coffee tastes like coffee. She only gave us 18% cream (which is a bit odd) but she was fine when I asked for milk -- she was polite and courteous overall.

My only complaint was the wait time, as I said at the beginning. From when we ordered, it was about 30 minutes until the food arrived. There *WERE* other customers (all elderly retirees) but they all already had been served, so we were puzzled why it took so long.

We were pleased overall and are likely to return -- many other breakfast places would've been about $36+tax for what we got, but this was $23+tax. Good value."}
{"text":"What can I say, it's a traditional pub. Fried foods, beer and dark wood trim, carpets and lighting. The patio is good, since it's really the only one in the area.

I can't say that the food is anything special but, the service has always been great. My wife and I will stop in for a quick bevy when we can.

It's definitely the type of place where you'll be remembered and not because you frequent it regularly, they just have that knack."}
{"text":"Warm and friendly pub with great food and beer selections. Live music with the best the city has to offer for over 25 yrs"}
{"text":"Wouldn't honour our coupons.  Started adding rules that weren't listed anywhere. Didn't seem very interested in our business even though we've been back multiple times and brought other. Our last visit and won't recommend."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good, but the service seemed quite lacking. If you are looking to chat with friends, make sure to get there before the bands start up at 9:00pm, but if you want to dance, then this could be your spot!"}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of wings and this place delivers! I am so happy that we have a plethora of great wing joints around the GTA and to know that the selection is so varied; anything from Asian to Jerk and of course your stand pub stuff fare.

Tara Inn is first and foremost a pub but it's definitely not a place to impress your date. The place looks like it's been stuck in a time-warp from the 70s. Everything from carpet to the ceiling has had better days and it shows. Even before entering you will dawn upon an ugly, dirt covered wooden door that was probably last cleaned 30 years ago after it was installed. This is definitely not a hang out place for everyone and generally the crowd is fit for the retirement home.

Aesthetics aside the wings are just fantastic! Big, juicy and crispy. The various sauces are also nice and flavourful. What I do appreciate (and most place don't do this) is how they are liberal with the sauces so the wings don't become a soggy mess.

Lastly, this place offers great value. Go on Wednesdays for half price wings. For less than $7 you will get about 8-10 wings (1lb) which is an absolute steal! If it were not for the wings, I would say this place gets maybe a star but their wings have just earned them 3. And the service is great!"}
{"text":"Going in I didn't quite know what to expect. There's a familiarity here yet it feels so foreign at the same time. Familiar is the crowd, name, logo and focus on luscious wings that of it's sister location, different is the space, menu and service.

It was an ordinary Wednesday night, a night of wings and ribs special, some beef stew and the mythical chicken curry. Mythical because even though it is listed on the website, they stubbornly deny it as a special for the day. Their reasoning was that the website had not been updated for over 2 years; very well, I digress.

Everything seemed to go downhill from there. Ribs were nicely poached I guess but didn't quite fall off the bone. I can't exactly say these qualify as barbecue. The sauce was however not quite as deceptive. It did not look great and it didn't taste like it either. All in all, a miserable half rack of ribs. I do commend them for cooking the wings well. They were very juicy and tender however again the sauce tasted the way it looks and it didn't look great. Honey wasn't honey enough, garlic wasn't garlicky enough and spicy..well you get the drift.

She did however let us pack our unfinished ribs to go. She had to fight tooth and nail with the owner apparently as there is a policy against brown bagging leftover specials. I question this rule and it's validity for the current times; I guess this place has rules to match it's decor from the 70s.

Don't waste your life here."}
{"text":"I've been a fan of the Tara since opening day 
Today I had a treat I had not tried before and that was a curried chicken dish that had me smiling as the chef was creative with his presentation and kept me smiling through the meal .
Great flavour !
Great meal !
Not expensive."}
{"text":"Popped in to check it out, was scared because it looks like a dive from the outside. Food was good and waitress was great."}
{"text":"food 4.5/5, service 4/5, seating 2/5
Wednesday is half-price wings!! For $6, you get 10-12 large pieces of wings.
Word of mouth says these are the best in the city and wow, I wasn't let down.
Comes in two styles, buffalo or scarborough. Buffalo is lightly dusted in egg and flour, comes out a bit more crispier and holds better flavour than the scarborough, which is cooked \"naked\" (no layer on top). Kevin (who I think is the owner), says 95% of wings sold are the Buffalo, a tender, tastier option.
Other reviews are right - limited sauces for the wings. Here's what I remember: honey garlic, sweet thai chili, mild, medium, hot, suicide, and honey mustard.
We had the honey garlic and sweet thai on buffalo style, and medium on scarborough style. Also, a side of fries. These wings aren't your typical st.louis, sad size wings. They were at least three to four inches long, super crispy and tender. Cooked to perfection. The wings also came with ranch sauce and two pieces of carrots and two of celery. The fries was a huge portion, maybe 2.5 lbs, I'm not that good at sizing from memory. They were okay, a little too soft for me, but a nice side to the wings.
It was ridiculous that the place was packed at 4:30 PM, but then again, maybe it was because of the half-price. Kevin said it's a hit or miss to find the place packed, but I think he was being modest. During our hour and a half stay, we noticed there were a lot of regulars. The servers had friendly banter and knew their drinks, pouring it as soon as they saw the regulars coming in. The locals are all super friendly, cautioning me the wings are hot and offering the newspaper as we waited for seats - you can tell the restaurant is a staple in the community.
I figured the place seats around 40, including the bar and some cozy armchairs by the front. Understandable for a small establishment probably run by a family.
They really did it well, offering great food for good prices, and a place to kick back and drink some beer (or whatever you like)."}
{"text":"We just came to check out and have a taste of their chicken wings, and it's awesome. The place is cozy and organized."}
{"text":"This was our plan b due to the restaurant we wanted to eat at being rammed with long wait times. Unfortunately for us, our meals of fish and chips and Sheppard's Pie were either horribly bland or ridiculously salty. The wings we had wanted for an appetizer but came with our main course were probably the best part of the meal but they were just average compared to other joints. The service was good though."}
{"text":"Very noisy! Overly bright, hard to relax with spotlights on! Pool table out of service on St Patrick's Day! Just not welcoming place to enjoy yourself! Staff were rude, because it was too bright in bar or dance floor people gathered in the hallways annoying waitresses! Patrons asked to dim lights and management said it's been busy and their not bothered if people leave. And we all did...one by one and went to bar bar that has a welcoming atmosphere with polite & pleasant staff! Oh upon arriving asked bartender about the Swedish wheat beer, his response was he doesn't drink lol My response most bartenders get training! Sad example of a local bar! Doesn't reflect the locals at all. There other location better service but terrible food! Served a unwashed soggy lettuce which reads in menu fresh crisp lettuce! I look it back to the chef for him to see you can't serve wilting food! Sad really! Nice layout! Both locations need better management, better caring staff and a great cook!"}
