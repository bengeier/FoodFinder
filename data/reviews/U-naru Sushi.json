{"text":"Friendly staff and great sushi for the price. Love this place. Everytime I am nearby and hungry I drop by to eat some sushi."}
{"text":"I used to get lunch here from time to time when I had no choice. The only good thing about the sushi is the convenience and the friendly service, and that's about it. This place is expensive even for mediocre sushi. If you want good sushi, just walk 5 minutes down to Dundas.

Quality: 4/10. Service: 7/10. Value: 4/10. Overall: 4/10."}
{"text":"Needed to grab a quick bite, and good'ol yelp app directed me to this off the path sushi place in a hospital food court.

They've got a great selection of sushi to choose from, and the quality was really decent, especially for a fast food joint.  I'd say this place is better than a few of the cheap sushi places off on Dundas.

If you've got a craving, and need something quick, this'll be the place."}
{"text":"This is as good as grab and go sushi gets! Located in the SickKids Hospital atrium - I know, I know - sushi in a hospital food court? Really? I'd normally be right there with you, but we grabbed lunch here today and it was delicious. Spicy tuna rolls ($5.95) were perfectly rolled, rice was perfectly seasoned, and it was all very fresh and tasty. Kiddo devoured an avocado-cucumber roll ($3.95)... she killed it so fast, we went back for seconds! The gentleman at the cash was just delightful, when he saw that we were back for more he threw in some complimentary edamame for kiddo and a \"sample bite\" of dynamite roll, which was just dynamite. They were out of spicy tuna on our second visit, but made up a new one for me fresh right away. I also got a lovely wakame salad - very fresh, very tasty, and a super reasonable $3.50. You can't beat this. Best cheap sushi I've had in a long time - far better than any of the crap sushi over on Bloor - and best grab and go sushi ever, with friendly, accommodating service to boot. I'm in love. Will be back even when I have no business in the hospital."}

{"text":"A busy location inside the Mount Sinai Hospital. The sushi I had was average, not bad for a food court location. The employee at the cash had trouble understanding my request for a loyalty rewards card. Other than that service was good. She offered me a complimentary miso soup which I gladly accepted."}
