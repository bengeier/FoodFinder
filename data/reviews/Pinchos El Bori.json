{"text":"WOW! This \"neighbor\" (I'm Dominican, so Puerto Ricans are my beloved neighbors), knows what he is doing! THE GREATEST PINCHOS I HAVE EVER EATEN! It was definitely worth the wait. Everything is fresh and made to order, delicious and well prepared, and the sauce is excellent. The spicy ones are also great! I'll try more the next time I visit as I saw a couple of other cool menu items I want to try. On topnof that, he and his wife have a great attitude and make you feel like they've known you forever. No complaints, only compliments! Keep it up, Bori! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Puerto Rico in Charlotte. Two locations but the same amazing food, just like we have it back home. Incredible flavor, cool food truck ambiance, and an amazing owner. 

You can't have just one, that's my advice. Its well loved for a reason, just go try it."}
{"text":"Think kabobs mixed with Puerto Rico! These are really good! $3 per kabob or as they call it here \"pincho\". Everyone and anyone who speaks Spanish in the area will unite here. Small food truck on E. 7th in between Caldwell and Brevard! In a parking lot. Call if you get lost. You can order a chicken or pork pincho brushed with BBQ sauce or spicy sauce or both! Each come with pieces of white bread. Great for before or after a night out in Charlotte. The salsa he makes on the side is so good but so hot! So beware and try it next you go, it won't disappoint."}
