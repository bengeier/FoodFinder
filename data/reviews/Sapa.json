{"text":"-1 star because they ran out of bubbles, and it was 3pm!!! :(.

That aside, the tea was good, we ordered lychee tea, milk tea, and the Coffee with Nutella ice cream. The passion fruit jelly wasn't overly sweet like I've had at other places, and the coffee and ice cream combo was heavenly.

Nice hidden gem!"}
{"text":"I work across the street from this place and discovered it today. It's a cute little place with good service and bubble tea. :) I'll be going back soon to try their vegetarian bah mi sandwiches. The prices are really good too."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS VEGAN VIÊT FOOD. Just learnt that the owner just came back from Vietnam after a year of learning how to make authentic Viêt food! And they made everything vegan here! I LOVED THE BANH MI AND AM COMING BACK FOR COUNTLESS TIMES. It also had special ice cream flavours like yuzu, black sesame, ginger, coconut."}
{"text":"Lovely place that serves lots of original ice cream flavours (nutella, Vietnamese coffee, ginger, pandan, etc). They also serve soft serve ice cream (chocolate, vanilla).  The staff is super nice and helpful. It's a family owned place and their daughter said they wanted to bring an asian taste to ice cream. 

I got the nutella ice cream and it tasted pretty close to the same thing. The flavour was rich and creamy an the consistency was great! I wasn't afraid the ice cream was going to slip off the cone.  

It doesn't look like much but it is really a gem. Go try it out!

PS: Cash only for now"}
{"text":"As a bahn mi enthusiast I can't recommend this place enough. They have the most delicious bahn mi in town and it's only 3.95, better than vua, or the place beside big in Japan... or the other 2 places I've tried. it may be vegetarian but even my carnivore boyfriend prefers sapa to anywhere else. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Boulevard St. Laurent was completely shut down for the Mural Festival so while we were wandering up and down the street, I kept an eye out for Sapa, which a local had recommended to me. They weren't open when we first walked by but we window shopped hard.

Tropical ice cream meaning Asian flavours! How can you say no to that?

Hours are kind of random. Closed Monday but everything else is 1:00pm to 8:00pm. I assume they'll change this once they sort out the kinks.

Menu. There's Vietnamese iced coffees you can get with ice cream. Sounds like a magical combo.

Lucky we did recon beforehand because the raspberry lychee wasn't in the display case when we came back and were trying samples. We asked one of the workers and turns out they were prepping a new batch. After careful deliberation, we settled on two but there's lots of interesting Asian flavours. Pandan, yuzu, corossol and ginger to name a few.

- Raspberry lychee and passionfruit ($3.85 double scoop cup) - we shared a double scoop of raspberry lychee and passionfruit. Both were very light, refreshing and full of flavour. Good consistency although it started to melt as we headed towards the metro. My favourite of the two was the raspberry lychee.

Next time I would try their soft serve but this was a great spot to grab a quick cone. Perfect for some dessert if you're on busy boulevard St. Laurent."}
{"text":"Had the mushroom and tofu Banh Mi and loved it! Great mix of different mushrooms to add great flavour. Even though they are vegan banh mi, for $3.95 you don't even miss the meat."}
