{"text":"I come here about 5-6 times a year in the morning for tax/accounting update seminars with my firm. For a conference/convention hall this place does the job. However, it looks like its regularly used for weddings and probably a couple ballin sweet 16 parties.  I would never use this venue for a wedding - the area is awful. Don Mills traffic is horrendous, there is construction in the parking lot and surrounding plaza - it's been ongoing for over a year. There's a Harvey's and a Swiss Chalet right next to the hall. I would think that most people wouldn't want to get married and take outdoor pictures with that kind of scenery behind them.   The outside of the hall looks good from a far but upon a closer look you will see that the railings are peeling and the walls are somewhat crumbling.   My advice - Don't get married here! Come here to listen to tax updates :)"}
{"text":"Dear god service was awful. The banquet itself doesn't care to to have loud blasting party right beside a silent memorial. I think that should be better planning.  Food was awful. Undercooked/overcooked everything   Staff was rude  Banquet itself didn't live to its expectations. The outside look is the only good part  Seating was an issue for everyone???  Probably the worst lazy dessert I have ever had. Crepe was rock hard ice cream with a thinner than paper crepe that tasted like a tortilla. Also had still frozen fruit.   I think it has potential to... I don't know... get better? Maybe?"}
{"text":"I end up coming here once a year, either for my own organizational events or something from a partner agency. It seems to be in a pop up free standing lot with a lot of other run down strip mall type places. Parking is great here, but turning off of Don Mills can be a nightmare during extended rush hours. Service really depends on who is planning the event, they have some affiliates that do some full serve activities.  The place is pretty large, but the rooms are close by one another and it can be pretty tight if there's more than one event at a time. The decor is rather dated, think 90's hotel and conference luncheon, though they do dress it up a bit. If you want something more upscale I suggest Parkview Manor, which is run by the same company."}
