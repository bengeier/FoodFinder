{"text":"Horrible shitty slow cooking time but decent service and the best wings and wing deals on Tuesday (a dozen for $4.50). Great daily specials, including weekends! Every time I've been here, the owner/manager guy is sitting in the corner bar seat drinking and eating wings."}
{"text":"The daytime bartender provides horrible service. I ordered a 9 dollar chicken breast salad that came out to me very small in proportion and had chicken mcnugget style chicken cubed on top. When I addressed the bartender about the chicken she insisted it was fresh chicken breast, and even after she showed me the pressed chicken parts patty, she still insisted it was chicken breast, rolled her eyes and just walked away from me. Needless to say, I did not eat the salad or pay for it. Overpriced, poor food and service."}
{"text":"Pretty solid little bar good food  the service is good definitely not a place for kids but people still bring them lots of beer on tap and a 21 and over patio so grab some friends and come drink cheap beer and eat some above average bar food"}
{"text":"Amy is the best, but her tits tell the rest. lol jk place is ok food is good for the price. As well as the drink specials. Friendly places to make friends if a game is on."}
{"text":"El Dorado's is tucked away on South Water Street, but is worth pulling off the road for. Arguably some of the best hot wings in Kent, with a massive selection for those that like em insanely hot and those that do not, at a good price too. Nightly specials on menu items, as well as drinks. This place gets pretty busy and loud during basketball and football games, but it is not overwhelming. Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"So.....went there for early dinner. Atmosphere is good, bar is nice. Pizza....not so much. The sauce is super sweet and what is the sausage they use on the pizza? It's like deer pellets.  It resembles the sausage that comes in McDonald's burritos. No bueno.  We also had the Polish Jalape√±o Sausage Bites. Those were good.  They were supposed to come with ranch but ours didn't. Good nonetheless. Chuggers pizza is SO much better.  In fact, Chuggers pizza is better than any pizza we gave had in NEO since moving back to Ohio in July, 2015."}
{"text":"Good wings, but don't go there for lunch. I had my send-off lunch here with a few friends. We went to the counter to order, went to the counter to get our food, and went to the counter for our drinks (and refills). 

I paid the bill (just over $50 for the four of us). I obviously didn't tip because it'd be as weird as tipping at Panera. We had done everything but cook the food. 

Two days later the charge shows up on my account with a generous tip added in for the old lady who was working the register. I called to complain. She was very rude, and I was told it was standard to add a tip to a bill that large, and that it would come off in a few days. 

It didn't. I like their wings, but fraud isn't cool with me. Definitely double-check your bank charges. If she did this to someone on a slow day, I'm sure she'd do it again."}
