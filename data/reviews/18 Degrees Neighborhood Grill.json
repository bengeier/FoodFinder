{"text":"Amazing place to relax and grab a bite/drink while the kids are skating.  The bartender is always on top of things. There are so many TV'S and they have every sports game on.  Happy Hour specials every day as well as daily specials."}
{"text":"Ok, so we were trying to go to overeasy and didnt realize that the hours were different in Scottsdale and Phoenix.  Soooo, we just wanted anyplace to eat and since this was next door, we settled.  BUT, I gotta say, we were surprised.  Both of us were happy with our sandwiches and the sides (I had roasted potatoes, he had green chile mac n cheese) were GREAT!  I was pretty happy that we made the mistake on hours and ended up here.  If I lived in Scottsdale, Im sure I would come here lots to watch hockey and have a good bite."}
{"text":"I spent the entire weekend at the rink for the turkey shoot tournament. This is our third year at the tournament and each year, 18 degrees proves to be such a great additive to the ice rink.   Throughout the weekend, we had our team pizza party, happy hour in the bar, the breakfast buffet and football on the couch.  All the service I experienced was amazing. The feel of the restaurant is warm and homey. Each booth has their own TV for whatever sport, or cartoon, you want. The quality of food is good. Nothing to write home about but amazing for an ice rink. The prices are affordable.   I recommend visiting 18 degrees if you have time to spare at the rink."}
{"text":"False advertisement! Website says open until 11pm and the truth is...they are only open until the ice is open."}
{"text":"We come here all the time after hockey.  It's just convenient cause it's right here.  The service is really bad.  I mean really bad.  Whoever owns this place needs to take notice and adopt a little business 101.  A little urgency in the service would go a long way."}
{"text":"Came in so my kiddo could skate and I could just watch front the comfort of the bar.  Service was non existent.  The waitresses walked past me about 10 times.... never even making eye contact.  I had to go to the bar to get a drink twice.  The bartender was speedy and friendly!  It's annoying and frustrating to be ignored.  Tips are earned."}
{"text":"Horrible!  Had the happy hour nachos.  The cheese tasted like old plastic and smelled like vomit!  Absolutely disgusting!    I would never eat here again!"}
{"text":"Had a Groupon and decided to give it a try for lunch.  I got a swiss cheeseburger with fries and ice tea, while my wife went with a veggie pizza and rootbeer.  The burger was great, as was the fries and ice tea. My wife could not stop raving about how fantastic her pizza was, she said it was the best she has ever had.  I took a bite of it and almost wanted to take the rest away from her and eat it!  It wasn't the best pizza I had ever had but in the top 3, maybe even the top 2.  Great service too.  We will be back."}
{"text":"OMG!  Went to a business luncheon here in the \"Warming Room\".  I literally had to stop on the way home and buy some real food to eat.  The worst chicken breast I've ever had in the most tasteless sauce I've ever had.  The chicken was full of gristle and was as tough as the bottom of my shoe.  Boring iceberg lettuce salad with generic salad dressings.  Steamed mixed vegetables in a strong herb sauce.  Egg rolls.  Nasty food!    Wow, and for that I paid my group $25?!  Why is it that these restaurants that host groups can't serve decent catered food, and why is it that the catered food in no way resembles what they actually have on their menu???  I won't be back.  Yuk."}
{"text":"Eh. If you're at the ice den - no harm, no foul. Otherwise - limited menu, over priced,average execution; if these are scratch made fresh cut fries - someone forgot to add the flavor. There are many other sports bars nearby that do it better."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and most times decent to good service.  Last time I was there I had the best burger I have had in a long time. Great flavor!  Good bar atmosphere and really nice to walk hockey or LaCrosse at the same time."}
{"text":"This place sucks. The waitress is really rude and wont give you water unless you eat food. My friend and i went there after a public skate and he ordered a burger and the waitress charged us $21. The waitress seemed like she didn't want to be there and i went there yesterday and she was 10 feet away from me and was mad because i asked for a menu so i just got up and left also she wouldn't give me a water when i asked for one which seems very rude. I have been to 18 degrees many times and the food is decent but this waitress is rude."}
{"text":"Just your standard sports bar... With glass walls so you can watch what takes place on the rink! The food is all right, but the experience is truly what makes this place special."}
{"text":"Yikes, before you dine here make sure you did not get checked on your way in and have a bloody nose!  Yes, it is true.  While eating dinner here a gentleman came in with Kleenex shoved up his nose profusely bleeding from his nose. After waiting 10 minutes for my waiter to address, I politely got up and asked him if we could move.  I said, \"Did you see that person with the bloody nose?\"  He responded, \"Ma'am we are at an ice rink!\" This was only after going there a few weeks ago, seeing a new menu with not such wonderful prices and asking what was happening.  I was then told, oh we are changing our atmosphere to be more of a destination restaurant with exclusivity and our new executive chef is from a well known five star country club.  Well as I said to the GM at that time, ''Um, did you know you are in the middle of an ice rink where families come to see their kids ice skate, play hockey and have fun\".  White tablecloths and a valet are their next vision - I did not know I was visiting Eddie V's or Flemings - WOW!  I know there are rules and laws through the CDC and Health Department about blood and bodily fluids. Maybe you should verse yourself with these and your staff.  Let Julie, your executive chef, know she might have made a wrong turn, Silverleaf Country Club is a left turn away.  Please comeback original 18 degrees, where it was fun, warm, relaxing, enjoyable to eat, and APPROPRIATE for the Ice Den."}
{"text":"Ordered take out for the first time tonight...I suspect someone will be contacting me shortly regarding some missing hockey pucks, somehow they made it between the hamburger buns in my container of sliders.  So, we tried the ribs, cheeseburger sliders, fries, sweet potato fries, and mac & cheese.    Ribs were generous in portion but fatty and just not worth eating.  The sliders I mentioned earlier are tiny individual patties that were black around the edges and chewy (like pucks), topped with a tiny piece of cheese on a bun  (no lettuce, pickle, flavor).  Their \"au jus\" for the burgers was served on the side and had no taste whatsoever, it wasn't even the \"salt assault\" style au jus that low rent places usually serve.  Mac and cheese was mushy and flavorless.  Fries were good.  Sweet potato fries never made it into the bag.  One common theme to all of the dishes was a complete lack of flavor.  On the plus side, we didn't dine there so we were spared the sound of screaming children while we ate.  I'm sure if you got a cold beer and some potato skins you'd probably be fairly content.  As far as a real dinner goes, absolutely not - it's terrible."}
{"text":"I have never received such horrible service in al of my life. Not only is their food mediocre at best, my friend was ridiculed for cheering for the team they didn't agree with, promptly followed by being called a bitch, then asked to leave.  Beyond embarrassing and terrible taste. Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"It's a restaurant attached to an ice rink. Yep, that about sums it up. The place was pretty cool on the inside (see what I did there?), but there wasn't any activity going on in the rink so it's not like there was much to see. The restaurant itself was adequate. There are lots of TV's, including a private TV for each booth. That's neat-o, but unfortunately our private TV wasn't hi-def. So that sort of ruins that for me. Many of the others in the restaurant are hi-def, but apparently the private ones are not. So that means that you'll pretty much just watch the ones that are not at your booth.   There are some arcade games around, but we didn't partake in any of that. There is a lot of hockey memorabilia hung on the walls, including flags for what appears to be all of the teams. I saw the Blackhawks flag at least, so that's all that really matters.  Service was mediocre. Someone in our party ordered cole slaw as a replacement to the fries, but then still received the fries. We told the server and he brought out the slaw and didn't charge for the fries. Problem solved. We also had no problem getting our drinks re-filled.   I really liked the fact that there were some healthy options available on the menu. I had the egg-white omelette and it came with a side of fruit. Tasted fine, but it was nothing special. The side of fruit was a little larger and more diverse than what is usually offered as a side a restaurants, so that was nice.  All in all, I would go back if there was an activity in the ice rink, or if there was a good hockey game on that I wanted to watch. Otherwise..... Probably not."}
{"text":"Ordered the California burger this time. Good burger this time. It's a dollar more if you want half fries and half onion rings  OR all onion rings, and you don't get that many. Zipp's does that for FREE. I think I'm done with this place.  The meal with tip cost me $16. I could've had TWO meals at Smashburger for that. Oh and the wings are a complete RIP.  I feel sorry for the chickens culled in their adolescence. 9 wings With tip $15. Cuz it's not the SERVER'S fault they're such a rip! I AM ANGRY! You pay for convenience."}
{"text":"Hello Yelp Readers: My husband and I alway went to 18 Degrees Neighborhood Grill for their burgers and fries.  While a little pricey for such an item in a bar atmosphere, we felt it was worth it because of the quality of the food prepared and provided to us in the past. Today, we went to the Grill and noticed there was a new menu.  Apparently, the Executive Chef changed and as a result the menu changed about three weeks ago. 18 Degrees used to serve french fries which were always hot out of the fryer.  Not anymore.  Shoestring potato fries are on the menu now which were served to us lukewarm and had no flavor.  (Regular fries are no longer on the menu as an option).  We were very disappointed, because the one thing we could alway count on from 18 Degrees was a nicely cut/portioned french fry served hot and perfectly seasoned with salt. The burger was \"good\", not fantastic.  The burger was not hot either, but rather just warm.   There was no excuse for our food not coming to our table \"hot\" because no one else was being served when we were there.  So, the Chef/Cook could not have been overloaded with orders to keep track of. The brioche bun served with burgers at 18 Degrees used to come toasted holding up to the toppings well.  The bun served to us was not toasted, it was dry, and fell apart while we ate our burger.  Topping portions were fine (adequate).  There is such a thing as too many things on top of the burger diluting the overall experience.  There was just the right amount of lettuce, tomato, peppers, pickles, etcetera to balance the burger, which is why I still rated them three stars.     Beware, this restaurant is inside the Ice Den, which means it is \"cool\" or \"cold\" as far as a temperature surrounding you.  Even more reason to ensure food that is meant to be served \"hot\" is actually served that way to customers since the ambient temperature of the air cools down the food very quickly.   Our waitress was prompt and efficient.  Regrettably, we will not be returning after our experience with the food in light of the Chef/Menu change."}
{"text":"Went to this little place on Groupon, not one person working Sunday night could even smile. Not even the bartender. She was frowning so hard it looked like a upside down smile. Our server and the rest the staff doesn't seen to appreciate having a job. The food was decent bar food  but due to the severs and staff I will go tip and be in a place that appreciates your business."}
{"text":"Great service, always greeted with a smile. Ask to sit in Jason's section if you go!"}
{"text":"I definitely will not be running back to this restaurant....if you can call it that.  I understand that when I got there that it was pretty late, but the place wasn't empty and about to close, so I DO expect good service.  First of all it took waaaay too long to get anyone to notice that we had sat down at one of thieir booths.  Our dumb waitress Jennifer was barely around and we couldn't tell if she was our waitress or the dumb brunette there that could not stop giving us dirty looks.  The manager i think he was, couldn't stop being a huge douche about the fact that I was the only underage person there.  He went out of his way to come by our table and say, oh yeah your waitress asked if I had checked your IDs before when you came to the bar for a drink, so I made sure to let her know that you (points) at me, were the underage one.  Well thanks you asshole, but pretty sure I ordered a god damn coke, and not a beer.  When we had gone to the bar before hand for a drink, I asked for a coke, (this bar is about a 10 seater so you can see everything) and he got everyone their alcoholic drinks, and left me without a drink. Even though, I was sitting directly in front of his \"work area\".  Pretty sure you can see that my drink coaster is without a drink.  Now to tell you about the horrible food that came out COLD.  The spinach dip was discusting too.  Didn't have any silverware, napkins or side plates untill half way through the meal.  Couldn't get a refill on ANY of our drinks.  I had my empty soda glass sitting at the head of the table and she walks by, \"need anything else?\" and the glass is sitting right in front of her.  Uh yeah....She added someone elses tab onto our bill without saying anything or asking.  Then took her a lifetime to put it on a seperate bill.  All in all, everything was just insanely horrible.  Worse than denny's and sorry guys, but that means A LOT.  Let it be known, we're in an economic depression right now, and the first businesses to feel that depression is restaurants, and as a server, you gotta milk every table that you're lucky enough to get as much as you can, because those restaurant doors could be closed the next day for good."}
{"text":"A worthy effort. I had the nachos, which I only ordered because they are made with movie theater cheese. Which is how the gods eat their nachos. They open up a can of iridescent, not-real, fake cheese, the kind that alternatively could be pumped out of a spigot. Proper.   Anyway, this particular fake cheese varietal is green chile fake cheese, which has a hint of some flavor that displeases me mildly. But Rachel, the waitress, is very cute. A fact of which I approve.   They have Big Buck Safari so Dallas G can release his murderous rage on hapless computerized animals before returning to his i-won't-harm-you-if-you-dont-harm-me life.   And the nachos are covered with chicken, black beans, sour cream, guac, salsa... and such. Definitely worth ordering.   Great reverse happy hour 10-close and all day sunday. Woooot  So best of luck, 18 degrees. Your 2nd day open is a worthy effort.  I do have to say, though, one more thing about Rachel. She laughed at my story, and that gets her an A+ in my book."}
{"text":"OK, this place is totally cool, regardless!  To be truthful, I only had an appetizer and beer when here, and I ate at the bar, so my service was terrific.  But...  I couldn't get over how cool it was to watch the ice from inside the restaurant!!!  This is a GREAT place for a casual (albeit, very casual) date.  And, um, for my single sisters, where do you think you will find men?  Can't wait to try it again!"}
{"text":"18Degrees - go here if you want to be surrounded by annoying Scottsdale hockey moms who think they are still 23 and their husband who had their balls taken away 15 years ago. The only reason I would drink more here is to drown out my desire to punch someone in the face. Don't go here unless you're \"diva-licious shopping / whorish type\" who likes Botox, fake faces and fucking your sons teammates husband. The only thing they have going for them is Molson on tap. But unless they start serving that to me in my own personal pool - I can't be drunk enough to ever drink here again."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years and they recently redid their menu. I can't believe I just paid $20 for a steak salad and they didn't even cook the meat enough.  They also took away Stella on tap. The menu is small and very pricey.  I will not be going back and no one else should until they fix what they broke.   New management made some bad decisions."}
{"text":"Well, let me start off by saying that this is my first yelping experience. So please bear with me. I always read reviews before visiting a restaurant and/or bar. 18 Degrees had some very mixed reviews, so I decided to see for myself...  A few of us decided to go to on Monday after work to check it out. I was blown away!!! Our server informed us that it was \"buy one burger, get one free\" day. Being the burger lovers we are, we all decided to order one. It was one of the best that I have ever had. I might put it a step above Indulge Burgers...and I love Indulge burgers. I did the classic cheeseburger with cheddar. It was a 1/2 pound patty grilled medium and cooked perfectly. The server said that they grind sirloin, chuck, and brisket into their burger for a perfect flavor. Well a perfect flavor it was. I'm not sure what kind of bun it was but it held up great without being too bready. It was served with a smear of mustard and ketcup with classic L,T,O.  All I can say is that I loved that friggen burger. The flavor was just incredible. My buddy had the \"Bacon Blue\" burger and loved it just as much. We all had a great time. Pitchers of beer were cheap and they had a ton of tv's all over the place. I will certainlly return. I never would have expected to have the experience I had knowing that I was going to a restaurant in an ice skating rink. It was actually a really \"cool\" atmosphere. Get it -- \"Cool\"."}
{"text":"Food is just ok,  average bar food. Stick to appetizers and beer, and enjoy watching the hockey."}
{"text":"Great hockey bar.  You can see the ice arena from your seats.  Carries both Molson and Labatt blue.  Food is bar food.  Service is prompt!"}
{"text":"Rachel, our server, is a historian. And she's historically accurate, which is to say, she's the reason we now dine here on the blood of enemies after our hockey games instead of Four Peaks.   Pete, one of the other servers, accused her faking the other reviews about this place for her benefit. Well, it's true, I am Rachel and I have obtained Elite status as Richard Z, Brad E and Dallas G For the purpose of self promoting. It's taken me two years but it was well worth it.   Meanwhile, the veggie burger is good, the onion rings are as well, and the wii and the $60,000 live action video game system make me stay for more abuse from Richie Z. Brad E beat me really hard in a sword fight last week as well.     It's good. If you're here, eat here."}
{"text":"I honestly do not see why there are such terrible reviews.  This place is a sports bar and nothing more.  It serves pretty darn good sports bar food.  The service is swift but not so friendly, the food is served swift and done well and all at a fair price.  We thought it was cool to sit by the window and watch them Hockey Skate and then practice the Figure Skating.  Really cool!  This would be a great concept in California!  We had the 18 degree Beef Philly with extra grilled onions and mushrooms with Onion Rings.  The sandwich was served with a juicy hearty portion of all and the roll was toasted nicely and the onion rings were really good served with Ranch sauce.  Not the healthiest of fairs but very good!  The chicken wrap was aloes a generous portion and the fries were golden brown crisp.  Also very good.  The place could use a face lift, a fresher environment and the staff could work on their people skills, however for just a sports bar, it is absolutely worth a trip!  :)"}
{"text":"Enjoyed watching hockey teams.  Tables and menus need to be cleaned.  Food was good. For a bar.  Staff is relaxed.  Friendly prompt"}
{"text":"The food is nothing to write home about. I've had the burger and the Reuben which were just ok for me. Probably the best item that I have had was the Pretzel. The servers seem to be attentive, so they have that going for them.   The views of the skating/hockey rink from the restaurant is fabulous. The restaurant is decorated with a hockey theme as all of the NHL team banners are on display. They show live and taped hockey games on the TV. It's a great place to cool off on a hot summer day. The Phoenix Coyotes also practice here as well."}
{"text":"Not a single person greeted us or welcomed us. We were not sure whether to seat ourselves or not.  Waitress did not want to be there, and it seemed like She did not want us their either.  Chicken \"flatbread\" was a poor excuse for a pizza. The chicken tasted like it was picked from a Caesar salad. I could literally taste the lettuce. I would stop at the vending machine in the ice den before this place again."}
{"text":"I'm sad that I had a terrible experience here, because we live in walking distance and it had the potential to become a regular stop for us.   BUUUUUUUT no. I had a living social voucher I think.. some type of social media discount.   The first problem they had with me, was that my voucher wasn't printed. Well on my iphone it clearly states, either print out your coupon or show the merchant your mobile voucher. If you are not going to honor mobile vouchers then maybe YOU SHOULD PUT THAT IN THE FINE PRINT.  After I made it clear they were going to honor this, they tried to tell me I couldn't use it for happy hour prices. Now I would definitely understand this too, had IT BEEN WRITTEN SOMEWHERE ON THE VOUCHER. Nope, nowhere. So our bitchy waitress goes to get her manager because clearly she doesn't have the brainpower to think of another excuse for not honoring this voucher....  So then this braindead manager comes over. He proceeds to tell me that he would be fine with using it for happy hour prices but the computer will not allow him to do so. I tell him to enter it in to show me that it won't let him & SHOCKER. It does let him.  Now why on earth would a place try so hard to make a customer unhappy. Because to say I left unhappy would be a fricken understatement of the year.   DON'T PUT OUT A SOCIAL MEDIA VOUCHER IF YOU ARE GOING TO BE ASSES WHEN WE TRY TO USE IT."}
{"text":"Great place to have beer, bar food and watch a game.! There are plenty of screens to watch your favorite hockey game or another sport (if you can convince them to change the channel. There is a good selection of beers including Selections from Canada and also local craft beers. The food is ok, but what do you expect from a sports bar? The staff is friendly."}
{"text":"My wife and I use to love this place but the past few times we have visited, it's definitely not what it use to be. The sounds didn't work on the tv at our booth.  We use to come in almost every Sunday to watch football but now they severely reduced their usual menu till 1 pm in Sunday since they share a kitchen with the place next door. There is usually open seating so it's nice not having to wait, but definitely not the same great experience we use to have."}
{"text":"Wow! The food arrived before I could even finish checking in on Yelp. The fries are just what I like and the turkey avocado sandwich with bacon is excellent!! It's not loaded down with greasy mayo or sauces, just simple and fresh and delicious. And Sara is the kind of server everyone would hope to have :). Great experience. Even watching the playoff game while enjoying the meal. Good stuff."}
{"text":"It's a shame what they have done with the place.  The menu is way to small and the drink prices are the highest around.  Kids menu is now a joke and we had to almost get them two meals for them not to be hungry.  Not sure what they are doing but their prices are now more than the Vig's, which is where most of the hockey families are now going.  If my math is correct they have lost close to 20k per year by our group not wanting to pay those prices and have only a few things to choose from.  Our last few bills were close to $100 bucks for a family of 4, at a bar!  Bring back the old menu and pricing and we would start to come back."}
{"text":"Meh.  We had a Groupon to try this place out.  Stood at the podium for a few minutes waiting for someone to seat us.  A staff member from the ajoining breakfast restaurant came out and told us to sit wherever and helped get a highchair for our child.  Maybe a sign would help next time?  I don't mind seating myself but I need to know to do that.    Food was ok but nothing super special that we couldn't get anywhere else.  Service came with a smile, but not overly friendly.  We got pretzels as an appetizer and they were great.  The cheese dipping sauce for them was very mild, almost watered down, but okay.  I ordered my burger medium.  The left side of the burger was very pink and the other half was well done.  The other person got the lunch special of sliders and wings and said it was good.  We'd go back and give it another try if we had a promo, but probably not at full price."}
{"text":"Coyotes fans do not support 18 Degrees Neighborhood Grill. Tonight members of our pack were told to quit cheering for the Yotes because they're leaving to Quebec. When she argued backed, she was called a bi**h and told to leave. How can you call your self home of the Coyotes viewing party?"}
{"text":"The food gets zero stars, but the service was great and it was neat to look at the ice rink."}
{"text":"Went to 18 Degrees last night with friends.  Place was crowded which was not a problem and noisy.  It was not our first visit and we have really enjoyed it in the past and told many people how much we liked it.  Well, things have changed!  They have a totally new menu and it is not nearly as good as the previous one.  The have cut the selections to a bare mininum.  The food was good, but the items we had enjoyed in the past are no longer available.  Just not what we wanted!  We expressed our disappointment to our server, who was absolutely great, and were told that she was hearing the same thing from many other patrons.  Rest assured that we will be finding another place to meet our friends that has a menu more to our liking.  We do not like settling for things we do not want.  It was a very disappointing experience."}
{"text":"This is a tough one!  I am puzzled by the nasty reviews - but after reading them, kind of understand!  This place has a great vibe, but it could be better.  You can watch hockey (or in our case, the Zamboni then figure skating lessons), the beer is  plentiful and cold, and the food was really good!  The pretzels appetizer scores a 12 on a 10  point scale, and the  hummus was delicious.  The fry sauce is tasty, and goes great on much more than just the fries!  At our table alone, we had that, plus a turkey burger (HUGE and delicious); the flat iron steak skewars which were cooked perfectly, lean and really flavorful, and the Asian salad (and the dressing was outstanding and I swear, there were two whole chicken breasts - not processed meat).  The bathrooms were clean, and the prices were reasonable. I can totally see how this place could become an easy hand-out.    On service - our server had ZERO personality.  She delivered good service, and allowed one of us to \"sample\" the salad dressing beforehand, which was nice, but seriously flatlined in the conversation and true \"customer\" zone.  She did have another big table, but really, is that an excuse?  We'll be back, and it is certainly worth a try.  We were there for lunch, so I am curious what it is like for legit happy hour or dinner, or even later.  It's a cool idea.  If you go, Order the pretzels.  Period."}
{"text":"I like 18 Degrees a lot, and bonus that it's close to home.  The food is nothing spectacular, but they don't promise to be a gourmet eatery; they're a SPORTS BAR!  You're mostly going there for a drink, appetizer, and to watch the people skate, since you can't do that at very many other places across town.  The service is always above par and the food is pretty tasty.  We'll def. go back!"}
{"text":"This is our new post-hockey game hangout.  It helps that it is in the rink and that our usual server Rachel is prompt.  It helps that she is cute also.  We came the first time on one of it's first nights and it wasn't very busy.  The manager let us play the virtual sports game.  It has hockey, football, soccer, baseball, and golf.  We played for free, but it is rather pricey to use.  It was fun, but I don't think it would be worth using your dollars on.  The bar is owned by the same people who own Overeasy in Phoenix.  I have only had the Black Bean Burger so far, but I tell you what.  It is f-ing good!  It has tomato, lettuce, red onion, and avocado.  I don't normally like avocado, but it's creaminess adds to it.  It has just a little bit of spice too. It comes with fries that are good enough.  The bar itself has cool interior and has lots of TVs around the place.  The booths even have their own televisions.  There is a large monitor at the front with a Wii hooked up.  I strained my shoulder after last weeks game bowling and playing ping pong.     So if you find yourself cheering on the Rubber Mallets, enjoying an ice skating session, or watching someone at a figure skating competition at the Alltel Ice Den, be sure to stop into 18 Degrees for a brew and a bite."}
{"text":"Excellent bar food and nice fast service!  The perfect getaway in Scottsdale during those hot summers!"}
{"text":"Some gal pals and I checked out this new place on a Sunday to catch a bite and watch some football.  The place was pretty empty when we arrived, but filled up by the time the Cardinals kicked off.    The location and setup of this restaurant/bar is really unique!  It looks into the Ice Den, and I was tempted to sit closer just to watch people skate by.  There's lot's of virtual sports and arcade games (like hitting the hockey puck into the virtual screen, etc) so I could see this being a very fun place to kill some time and have a few drinks.  When my friends informed me that this used to be a Peter Piper Pizza, it instantly made sense.  I also really liked that each booth had an individual TV on a mechanical arm that you could position to whatever angle worked for your group.  Now it's true that I don't get out much to sports bars, but I thought that was a cool feature!  The food was.....eh.  Pretty typical bar food.  Several of the girls I was with got the pizza due to our server's reco.  It was homemade crust and they both reported it as pretty tasty.  I took her advice with her favorite thing on the menu and went for the pastrami sandwich -- it was mediocre at best, with pretty bland flavor and a really, really soggy bottom piece of bread.  I did finish the tasty fries though  :-)  Overall, with happy hour specials (all day on Sunday!) and a convenient location, I'm sure I'll be back....but I'll skip the sandwich."}
{"text":"We found this place via Living Social last year.  Since it's located inside the Ice Den, an ice skating rink, there's no way we'd stumble across this place.  It's a pretty cool place to grab a bite to eat, drink, and watch sports.  There's plenty of TV's and the booths have small, private TV's that you can control the channel selection....perfect for watching a game!  Every time we come here, I get the Appetizer Platter (Onion Rings, Chicken Fingers, Potato Skins, Quesadillas), $12.50. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/18-degrees-scottsdale?select=vrTkMnVL__fBIoCQuV537g#vrTkMnVL__fBIoCQuV537g  It's a large portion of food, so plan on sharing if you order it.  The platter is delish for bar food.  They have drink specials and happy hour too, good stuff.  Return Factor - 80%"}
{"text":"This place is total Ice Palace......so it is a great place in the summer.  Really....if I lived closer, I would just sit here all day and order H2o.  I came here with a girlfriend only because she had a gift card.  It is kinda of cool you can watch hockey practice here. It is a total sports bar so the set up with TVs, I really liked.  I notice the booths had their own TVs...that is really a nice setup!  Anyhow, we had salads....not a specialty place for that kind of food......this place is all fries, onion rings and burgers.  Our salads were  bland but  for 9-10 bucks ....GET THE BURGERS!  We were out of our element but we had 50 bucks to spend!  What's a girl to do?"}
{"text":"Unfortunately spend a lot of time and $ here due to it being in the ice rink that my son plays hockey at....horrible service!!! Once again tonight sat down and waited 20 minutes with friends with zero service. Nobody took our drink orders, eventually got up and left. Too bad because they have a captive audience with the hockey families! Really need to get some better staff in!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times.... and it has been OK each visit.   We have used Groupon like deals on two of our visits.   ***STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE ON TUESDAY NIGHTS*** It's kids eat free night... and this place is an absolute zoo.... especially if you are not into having kids running all around you while trying to relax after work.   The food is OK. I like this place because there are not many casual places in the area (with the exception of the Temple Bar down the street). I also like sitting and watching the hockey teams play. They have large windows that look right out over the ice.  Service was always good. Prices are reasonable. And try the fresh Bavarian Pretzel appetizers! YUM!"}
{"text":"not bad for a hockey rink.....very good service"}
{"text":"Good place for Hockey goers! It's located right inside the Ice Den. Burgers are AMAZING! I'm not just saying that cause I work there. However I fell in love with them when I was a customer. The bartenders are cool, and friendly staff."}
{"text":"We dine here often. My husband is a wings man and we meet friends and order their pitcher and wings deal. Massive plate of wings and a pitcher of beer on tap, we usually go kilt lifter. The wings are hands down the best Hotwings in the valley and we've been to the top 5 listed on yelp, these are better. There strawberry shortcake is also amazing!!!"}
{"text":"This place was very mediocre, VERY! The food was blah and the place was not bustling.  Eventually had to go track down the waitress and get our tab... Glad to see others had a better time........."}
{"text":"It was a good time to go around 1:45 or so when we got there. Not many people there, great view inside Ice Den watching people do triple axles and such. Waitress helped us right away and very nice looking I must say. Food came fairly quickly was hot and delicious! I had the BBQ bacon burger with jalapeños and Onion Rings. I'd say probably a good tie for the best burger I ever had, I'm still partial to The Burger Shop. Restaurant is a great place for happy hour and the prices are way affordable, not to mention one of the cleanest looking restaurants I've ever seen. I definitely recommend 18 Degrees for Food, fun and excitement!"}
{"text":"Their new menu is great.  Fish and chips are really good and they have fresh soups daily that are amazing.  Wasn't too fond of eating here before the changes were made....now I'll make sure I come here hungry while my daughters are skating.  Sean does a great job behind the bar as well."}
{"text":"I ate there a few months ago and got the worst food poisoning I have ever had. I used to go daily because of how close it is to my office but it really messed me up and I would never go back! Service was always sub par and the food was just okay! Hope this helps others!"}
{"text":"We ordered the California Burger and Mushroom Burger.  Burgers were good qaulity. The bacon was real dry and crunchy which made it seem like it was precooked.  Onion rings were very good.  Best part of the meal was very funny and one of those  momments you have to say did that really just happen.  I asked the waitress to wipe down our counter/table and she brought dry napkins and wiped it a little which did nothing and then she looked at me like all done. We could not stop laughing as I put some of my water on the table and cleanned it off with the napkins she left behind.   She seemed like she was new."}
{"text":"9/5/13  Stopped in to use an expiring $20 for $10 Amazon Local Deals coupon**.  Was told to sit anywhere I'd liked, so I sat at one of the tables near the windows overlooking the Ice Den, the ice-skating rink next door-- pretty cool. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/18-degrees-scottsdale?select=3vIs8mTZeROUqDL3yPzWpw#3vIs8mTZeROUqDL3yPzWpw  There were booths alongside one wall that had their own flat-screens, which were nice touches, and an area with leather (or was it pleather?) seating, and yet another flat-screen, which looked inviting.    The young female server wasn't particularly enthusiastic or helpful about the menu offerings, but was honest enough to steer me away from the sweet potato fries when I inquired about them.  I have to agree with her that the green chile mac 'n cheese was the better option out of the two.  After studying the menus for many minutes, debating on trying three courses (app, entree, and dessert), or just two main entrees, and finally decided on ordering the Bacon and blue cheese burger, with green chile mac to start, and then later on going with the cheeseburger (cheddar) and subbed sweet potato fries for an extra $1.25.  (Perhaps she's not a sweet potato fry fan, or maybe she is and she didn't like the way they were prepared here?  I had to find out for myself.)  The burger patties weren't of high-quality-- I found them consisting of more fillers than meat and too fatty, yet not very flavorful.  I had a bit of the blue cheeseburger http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/18-degrees-scottsdale?select=KDB96IhpSqi3JgGvR259HQ#KDB96IhpSqi3JgGvR259HQ for lunch at work the next day, didn't enjoy it, and threw away the rest of both burgers that night.  Same thing with the sweet potato fries-- too soggy, even after I'd requested \"extra-crispy,\" and not a lot of flavor.  The green chile mac was the only decent item I had.  Back to the burgers, I found it strange that the bacon and blue cheeseburger didn't come with any veggie trimmings (\"only the cheeseburgers have them\"), but I was given a plate of shredded lettuce and tasteless tomato slices when I asked.  The cheddar cheeseburger http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/18-degrees-scottsdale?select=LXfGcKQ1Z9fFAPSKVkRYFQ#LXfGcKQ1Z9fFAPSKVkRYFQ did come with lettuce and, even more interestingly, more flavorful and redder, tomato slices.  The happy hour prices seem like a good deal, and it seems like a decent place to hang out and watch sports on TV, or to just  meet with friends, if hanging out at home, or someone else's, isn't feasible.  I thought it something novel to be able to watch both novice and experienced skaters practice next door...  I hope I can bump up my rating next time.  That is, if I return.  **Sister with two kids were coming for a visit in August, and I thought I'd take them ice-skating.  The kids weren't interested in trying on ice skates, so the certificate went unused."}
{"text":"Went here last week with the husband for dinner.  Had a coupon, but once we saw they do Friday night Pizza and Pitchers (1 pitcher of beer and 1 any whole pizza for $15.  Are you kidding me!  That's AWESOME!!) and were running a fish taco special for $8.  We ordered both.  The pizza was good, thin crust, good on toppings.  The beer was cold (you can choose Coors Light or Molson.)  There were kids running around all over the joint, and parents gathered at tables having a glass of wine.  It looks like a great place to grab a bite or a beer while the kids are doing skate night.  Overall, the food was better tan average for bar food, and the environment is very family friendly.  One tip - don't get the cookie dessert.  It's $8 for a warm chocolate chip cookie with a scoop of ice cream on top, and the cookie was about 3 inches across.  I can get that dessert at Jalapeno's up the street with a 6 inch cookie.  Same price.  Otherwise, definitely not bad!"}
{"text":"I enjoy this place for what it its, always a good time.  We spend many weekend evenings here as my kids love to ice skate.  The hot wings are a staple to me.  We were not crazy about the type a cheese used on the nachos.  The white pizza and club are a hit for my wife.  kids enjoy the cheese burger and fries.    Service is always with a smile.  Great place to have a casual date night with the kids near by with the right price."}
{"text":"The food couldn't overcome the bad service. No one to greet us at the door, but no sign to seat ourselves. One person walked by with no acknowledgment. Second person said hey'd be with us, but then said to just sit anywhere we want. Took at least 10 minutes for someone to take out drink order, even thought servers were serving the table beside us. there were about 3-4 tables in the restaurant, including us, and 3 servers, plus a woman who must have been the manager. She also walked by us without asking if we needed anything or if everything was ok. So, we got our drinks and waited another 10 minutes to order. One person needed sweetener for their ice tea and the server forgot, it took 20 minutes to ask someone again and get some. Had to ask for forks & knives to eat, and salt. It was a painful dining experience. I did like the food, but it was not worth the hassle to get it."}
{"text":"This has the potential to be a nice  place.  First, they need a hostesses.  You walk in and nobody greets you. You even think you may have walked in through a wrong door.   I. Watched at least 5 customers ask the bartender how they get seated.   2. Hire people that want to work there. Unemployment is at 4.9% but I'm sure you can still find qualified people to be servers and bartenders in the valley.   3. Layout of the place sucks.  You have an entrance from the ice den and the street. Both create traffic right through the center of the restaurant."}
{"text":"18 Degrees is a great place to take the kids on a weekend afternoon.  In addition to the kid friendly food, the booths have their own tv's, there are games and of course ice skating.  The food's good enough for parents too, the decor is nice and the people watching is some of the best in the area.  I saw more than one NoSco Juicy Couture-clad mom hanging out with a glass of wine while the kids did their thing - oh, not to be judgmental or anything :-)  The parking can look crazy, but a lot of that is from the rink and there's plenty of extra just east of the main lot.   This time around we had perfection for service, and really good food.  The grilled cheese is a must-try, trust me on this one!"}
{"text":"Horray for hockey.  It's unfortunate that beyond the tv's to watch the games this place fails both on food and beer.  They share a kitchen with Over Easy so I know that the kitchen can produce great food however the menu is horrific.  Someone needs to step into this century. The beer menu is also pretty pathetic.  You would think that a place in North Scottsdale would realize that people will pay more for good beer and that there is more to beer than just Coors light. I give it two stars one for the tv's and one for the friendly waitress."}
{"text":"Why haven't I been here before now? This is a cool restaurant. It sits right behind the ice den so you can eat, watch live hockey games, and lots of big screen tvs around for other sports. I ordered the fish and chips and much to my surprise it was really good especially the French fries and coke slaw. I'm a Cole slaw snob so I would definitely say if it was not good. I got a side order of wings which I'll try later. The wait staff was attentive and service was fast. All and all a great experience."}
{"text":"This breakfast and lunch restaurant is all about great food.  Excellent portions, quality, and staff. Breakfast and lunch can't be beat!"}
{"text":"I'm unofficially giving 18 Degrees 3.5 Stars... 3-Stars as a general restaurant; 4-stars as a sports bar  18 Degrees has above par food compared to most sports bars I've been too. We stopped by to watch some of the Elite-8 tournament on Sunday and planned on having a mini pig out. We ordered onion rings to start... tasty and a good sized plate. I had the black bean burger. It came topped with good veggies: avocado, lettuce, red onions, and good tomatoes (hate the tasteless tomato slices served on most burgers). The black bean patty was decent; not the best I've had, but I'd order it again. My boyfriend ordered the BBQ chicken sandwich but was brought the Buffalo chicken sandwich by mistake. Agreeable as he is, he said it looked good and was more than fine with having the buffalo one. He ate every last bite and said he enjoyed it.   The ambiance was great... kind of fun to have all the hockey rink right outside (you can actually look right into the rink through windows at the restaurant). There are TVs everywhere... our booth had our own individual small flat screen. My boyfriend said he's definitely going back with the guys."}
{"text":"Not very good. Typical fried bar food. Ordered a southwest burger and asked for it medium well. Middle of the burger was very pink. Ended up throwing some of it out. The chips were just okay. It's not the worst food ever, but it's certainly not great."}
{"text":"Very quick to get our food, food tasted delicious!! Got the southwest turkey sandwich. So great! The only down side was we barely saw our server..."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good. Great sports bar feel and you just might get to see an NHL team practice!"}
{"text":"I was at the rink scouting all day and was probably the last customer of the night. Hadnt eaten all day and ordered a cheesesteak at 9:40. Well they bring it out and the sandwich is smashed upside down on the plate. Real nice. A big F U from the cook right. The waitress did take it off the check which was nice. I would never ever come back after getting treated like that. Was such an obvious f u. Nice way to end my day."}
{"text":"I absolutely hate giving negative reviews, which is why I've never done it before.  However, after looking at how many 1 star reviews this place has received over the years, it's clear that the managers don't read these or don't care.  There is ZERO AMBIANCE OR VIBE with this place.  It's mostly an under 18 or over 60 place, and was 75 percent empty during late happy hour.  My wife suspected that it was probably a big hit with the Monday night Bible Study crowd.  The staff, while very pleasant, didn't seem terribly excited to be there, and I can't blame them when the place was totally empty.  We went up there to try the Wednesday Pizza special, as my wife wanted some for Lunch and Rosatti's didn't have single slices.  I basically made her order it against her wishes, since, how badly can you screw up pizza when it's your advertised special?  I'll never make that mistake again.  Whoever makes the pizza should be drawn and quartered, and after that, shown the door.  Either the crust and/or cheese had a distinct \"mothball\" taste, and Ragu would have been an improvement on the sauce (no spice at all).  I've eaten every crappy frozen pizza on the market, and any of them would have been a massive improvement on this goop.  Surprisingly, my Coors Light draft and chicken wings were just fine, but that didn't make up for the pizza.  After that ordeal, the least I could do was buy my wife a couple of normal Kendall Jackson Chardonnays, at $9.50 a glass.  This seemed a bit pricey for such a dumpy place, but we weren't taking any chances on the \"house\" wine.  That was too scary a proposition, even though they were less than half the price.  Thoughts of turpentine kept running through my head.  You couldn't pay us to go back to this place unless they blew it up and started all over.  The owners must be making money somewhere else because this place \"aint happening.\"  It's a real shame for such an interesting location."}
{"text":"hubz had a groupon.  he had a bacon cheeseburger and green chili mac and cheese.  I had the turkey wrap and green beans.  Food was fresh and tasty!  Our waitress was disinterested but this place is attached to an ice skating rink so she probably is used to parents coming in for just a drink or snack while waiting for their kids.  it was fun to watch the ice skaters!"}
{"text":"The location is great. Fresh brew iced tea would be welcome. The menu is fine, but I think that they could review what is on it and see what could be tweaked, improved or refined."}
{"text":"Very spacious inside with large booths. One side of the restaurant had clear windows looking into the Ice Den. They have entry from the parking lot and from Ice Den. The service was prompt and friendly. The restrooms were clean. The food is hit or miss. We ordered turkey avocado sandwich which was quite tasty. The bread was nicely toasted and had very generous portion of turkey cold cut in it. It also came with French fries which was nice.  Also had the philly steak sandwich. The meat was a bit dry and it didn't really have much flavor but It came with generous serving of French fries.  If I was here for Ice Den, I would consider eating here because it is convenient. However, I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here. My friend had Groupon, so we didn't pay full price so it was a plus."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times. They do a decent job with their food. I have only had their hamburgers wings and sandwiches. Decent place to watch some sports as well. Plus you can always watch the hockey rink"}
{"text":"I used Local Flavor voucher $10 for $20.  As another reviewer mentioned, when I walked in, no one greeted me.  I stood there at the entrance looking at the menu for about 15 min, still no one greeted me or acknowledged me, tho I was looking at each employee that went by, as if to say \"hey, here I am\", but they didn't  notice.  So I took the menu I found at the bar, and found a table and seated myself.  The flat iron steak I had a year ago, was no longer on the menu.  A server came within 1 minute.  I told her I was ready to order (after all I looked at that menu, while waiting to be seated, for 15 min).  When I asked her if the salmon was wild or farmed, she sorta winced and said \"It's frozen\".   When I asked her if the fish and chips was already battered and they pick ready-made pieces out of a box, and then fry, she said \"That's frozen too, but it is hand-battered the night before, then frozen\".  Weird.  She said it was pretty decent.  The description said it was a light beer batter.  It costs $13, plus she said the onion soup was good, with real cheese $7, so that completes my $20.   My server, Adriana, asks me if I want my soup now, before the entrée, and I yes, I am really hungry!    We settle on water with lemon wedge, because I told Adriana I am diabetic, don't want any caffeine, or pop.    The service was REALLY FAST!  But as soon as someone brings my onion soup, the fish comes right away too.  I look at each, wondering which to eat first, cos both are hot, and both will get cold at same time.  Melted cheese on onion soup is beckoning EAT ME NOW before cheese gets hard, and hot fried fish is hollering EAT ME NOW, before I get cold!    I eat the fried fish at same time as trying to gobble up the soup.  Soup is REALLY GOOD, very sweet, tho, I wonder if they put sugar in there, or is it just the sweet onions.  The swiss cheese was put on a piece of toast (crouton) and then melted, then both put onto the soup.  Much of the cheese was melted on the outside of the bowl, as well.    I was VERY HAPPY with the 3 pieces of fish.  The batter was indeed very light and very crispy, inside HOT!  I had to ask for some malt vinegar, which made it even better!  I substituted the fries (diabetic don't need white carbs) for the Caesar salad.  Salad was kinda boring, bland, so I squeezed lemon juice on it, which really livened it up.  Cole slaw was really good !    Server Adriana came TWICE to ask me if everything was OK.  She asked me if I needed a take out box, when I was half way thru my dinner, but I said I was really hungry and I think I will be finishing the whole thing.  And I did.    My server was VERY attentive, genuinely friendly, helpful, and interested in my welfare (not distracted), and I give her A+.  If the management has more Adrianas, this place wouldn't get such bad reviews.  I am giving it 4 stars because no one ever greeted me and I had to seat myself.  This also happened when I came here a year ago.  That server was not attentive at all.  My flat iron steak I had then, was really gamey, tho I like gamey beef, I wondered if it was American beef, as it tasted like it came from another country, South America.  So if it weren't for my previous experience with mediocre server, and if staff \"noticed me\" when I came in both times, I'd give 18 degrees a needed 5 stars.  Apparently people like it here, maybe cos it was Sat night, and not weeknight.  But every seat was taken, and different people asked for my three vacant chairs (I ate alone), and as soon as I stood up to leave, people were already sitting down at my table, before someone could clean it.  The parking lot outside was amazingly full, tho not that many people at the Ice Den."}
{"text":"Tasty big ol' burgers. (You could probably share if you're not a big eater.) Good, crispy fries. The kids' pizza is super cheesy - be careful with little ones so they don't choke. Located inside the Ice Den, you can take a break from skating to eat here without removing your skates. Lots of sports viewing options on multiple TVs. Full bar."}
{"text":"If I weren't held hostage at hockey lessons twice a week, I'd NEVER eat at 18 Degrees. The staff is friendly but food is very mediocre and overpriced for the taste...and I've been coming here for years so I've tried just about everything. The wings, if ordered well done, and the mac & cheese are good though. No complaints about Over Easy."}
