{"text":"Delicious sandwiches! I tried the sausage. Our whole table was happy with our orders. The toppings are so tasty. If you don't like spicy food, ask for no peppers. Friendly staff. Can't wait to come back and try the coffee!"}
{"text":"Nourriture épicée, mais bonne.  Ambiance nulle (aucune). Service à la clientèle médiocre.  Restaurant à éviter, voué à fermer sous peu."}
