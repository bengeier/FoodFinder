{"text":"Arrived to a cold Ray's. Apparently a heater was broken. Stayed anyway as was meeting 3 friends to spend gift cards we received from Jimmy DeLagottie (Thanks Jimmie).   The place was half full of  Millenniums having a good time. We had a table for four and were waited on in a timely manner. The waiters were very good and kept asking  if we needed anything. They were well tipped for their efforts.   We all had burgers and they were very good with any type of condiment imaginable. The burgers downfall was the bun. It was not toasted and was the type closely related to Wonder bread.   We had very good fries that were nice and hot and well priced for a big basket of them.   All in all a decent meal, well priced.   Oh, and the draft beer selection was gigantic. I had a nice fresh Guinness and others guys had local craft beers.   We had gift cards that could only be used in the Fairlawn Ray's and not the Kent Ray's. What's with that?"}
{"text":"we are always tired and hungry when we arrive at Ray's.  They have a varied tavern menu but it is not \"cheap\" food. example: the dinner salad has a fresh blend of spinach, iceburg and spring mix in it.  (italian dressing is recommended over the greek, which lacked herbs and spices)  the taco/chili salad is a huge portion with just the right amount of spice.   our food came out very quickly, as ordered - and our server was knowledgeable AND very attentive.    Ray's is one of those places that you can come as you are - it has a neighborhood feel.   if judged as tavern food, Ray's gets 4 stars."}
{"text":"You craving a burger and a beer? Rays Place is the place for you! Anytime I'm in the Fairlawn area I always swing by Rays. The food is awesome, the service is friendly, and the beer selection is incredible.  I grew up in Kent, and have been going to the Rays there as long as I can remember. Therefore I was very excited when I heard they were opening a new one in Fairlawn! Even though the vibe is different from the Kent Rays, everything is just as good! Last time I went in I had the pig rub wings and my boyfriend had the mofo burger. The mofo was huge!! It was delicious and you got a lot of burger for what you were paying. The wings were a good size and nice and crispy. I would diffidently recommend both of them.   We had a lot of different servers come up and check on us throughout the meal, and I loved it! I don't understand why anyone would have a problem with that. As a team they were all just making sure we were being taken care of. If anything, that would make the service even faster. This way we could just pull anyone of them aside, instead of waiting on one individual for help!  I love supporting mom and pop businesses rather than the food chains we are constantly surrounded by. That's just one more reason I keep going back to Rays! My family and I love this place, and recommend it to everyone we know."}
{"text":"I was really excited to see Ray's Place open a new location in Fairlawn. I live about 2 miles away and had spent many evening in this building when it was the Lizard. I was impressed with the improvements they made to the bar area. Their beer selection is excellent!  I've been here several times, and the food has been excellent!  The wings and burgers are among the best I've ever had. Those are my raves.  My rants are as follows. They do not give you fries, chips, a pickle, NOTHING, with your sandwich. One would think if you order a sandwich for 8.99, you would get a handful of fries!  They also have NO nightly specials. I was told during my last visit, that they may start a \"wing night\" soon, but they weren't sure. Also, the beer prices are a bit more expensive than the previous tenants' (seemed to be about $1 more per pint of beer).  I'd love to get Ray's a better review, but until they address these issues, I can only give it 4 stars."}
{"text":"Great selection of beers at relatively good prices. The food is slightly-better-than-average bar food, in substantial portions. Not terribly \"atmospheric\" but laid-back and comfortable. This is a place I like to take visitors ... especially for the nice beer offerings."}
{"text":"Worth five stars for their beer selection alone. Food is standard bar fare, but good bar food. A very respectable burger. A nice, locally owned place to visit. This location is only about a year old. The original is in kent. Also worth visiting."}
{"text":"Big tvs ah so have those at home nice though Well let's see if u like eating  cardboard  have at it because  that's  what the food taste  like the service was great and fast but that means nothing  if the food sucks had the quasadious plain bland seriously  no taste at all I mean really they could help at least added soon seasoning to the chicken gross you've been warned"}
{"text":"Food good as usual. Saturday at 7 pm, lots of parking spaces, not a good sign. Our female bartender was sluggish, had to literally put my hand up three different times to get someone's, anyone's attention for stuff like take my order, no napkins and dressing that didn't come with my salad. The bar was less than 50% full. To top it off the hostess waved bye to as as she glanced up from the novel THE NOTEBOOK"}
{"text":"I've eaten at a thousand bars in my life so I would consider my experience in these matters at the Mensa level.  From the moment I walked in I knew I was in for a treat.  The bartender was friendly and greeted me with a fist bump...bromance engaged.  Happy hour was until 7 so I received a $1 off my draft from an intense selection of local brews and those from galaxy's far far away.  It was a Tuesday so most appetizers were $2 off.  Nice selection but I wasn't in a app mood so I went right to the sandwich menu.  I never judge a book by its cover but I always judge a bar by its Rueben, and I must say this one is in my top 5!  (That's impressive).  I'm in town for business for a few days and I tell you what...I will be back tomorrow for the wing special.  I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"I know this place doesn't have raving reviews but my fiancé and I loved it.  I noticed complaints about too many waiters and I didn't see that as such a bad thing.  We had multiple people refilling our drinks and bringing us food.  Our glasses were always full and we got our food....that's what we came for.  The food was great bar food.  I highly recommend The Mustard Seed sandwich.  Roast beef and cream cheese on a pretzel bun.  It was fantastic.  Hot wing sauce was great too.  Overall a great meal."}
{"text":"I've been to Ray's in Kent and enjoyed it, but there was always a wait, or the party had to split into two groups to be seated. So when I needed a place to watch the Ohio State/Oregon championship game I decided to try the Ray's in Fairlawn. I arrived a bit early so I could eat before kickoff, found a place at the bar and was immediately greeted by a bartender. I ordered a beer, went with the bacon cheeseburger and added a side of fries.  The craft beer menu is extensive. I.P.A., alcohol content, description, origin and prices were all listed, allowing easy choosing. Cheaper run-of-the-mill beers also are available. Customers ranged from young to older and the place was packed. In spite of how busy they were, the staff remained helpful, friendly and attentive.  The six-ounce burger came cooked to their standard \"medium-well.\" The bun was lightly toasted and was of sufficient size and density to last through the meal. Fries were plentiful, considering they were ordered as a side and not a basket. The first bite of the burger reminded me of that open-fire taste Ray's in Kent has. The beef was better than anything else to be found in the Fairlawn area.  I was going to give the burger 3 1/2 Stars, but because the staff was so friendly and stood out so much in making the experience so enjoyable, as opposed to the \"reptile\" place down the road, I'm giving it 4 Stars. Oh, and the Buckeyes CRUSHED the Ducks!"}
{"text":"This has quickly become my new favorite neighborhood bar. The staff is always super friendly and helpful in finding good options on the menu. The draft list is large and there's always a good seasonal selection. I've yet to eat anything that wasn't great. The wind I ate phenomenal! Make sure to try the Pig rub on them!  Overall, I'd argue its a must stop sorta place. Be forewarned though, a lot of sandwiches do not come with a side. That being said they're still reasonably priced and its still a lot of food!"}
{"text":"We had drinks at the bar and the service was some of worst we ever had. The college students working wouldn't even look at their customers. They also got our order totally wrong. Seriously how hard is it? Get training from the kent location please."}
{"text":"Great food drinks and service! I don't think it's fair to judge a place based on someone using the jukebox. It's not a copy of the Kent location and that's fine Fairlawn is different and you should expect it to be different."}
{"text":"This has been a favorite with my kids as the original Ray's is in Kent. The food is the same. Service is great, it's bigger. It's clean. Atmosphere is interesting. The history is cool.   A favorite is the wings. Pig Rub.... a must! The Cuban Is big enough to share. The Ruben Delicious. And if you want to try something outside of the box get the peppers and oil they aren't hot they aren't sweet they are perfectly served with Cibatta bread.   Did i mention the beer choices?? Yeah."}
{"text":"Based on comments of others I was leery of going but I went.   Environment - GOOD- open and bright. Typical basic bar type furniture.   Bar - SUPER GREAT- fantastic selection with friendly bartenders. They went above and beyond and buy my husband a jalapeño margarita not on the menu. So many beer selections.   Food - MIXED- nachos were good. Stirfry was very good. Very disappointed in the burgers. They lacked any pizzazz and flavor. The Keylime pie I will definitely go back for more. They make their own pies."}
{"text":"We went here on a Sunday.  Host was very friendly.  Wait staff was ok.  We ordered the calamari for an appetizer. It was okay. We ordered the ribs. HORRIBLE.  The smoked sauce was terrible and the ribs were smothered in it along with all the fries.  The ribs were dry.  I had 1 bite and was done.  There was not one fry on the whole plate that wasn't soggy from that sauce.   The waiter never even asked why I didn't eat them.  Didn't seem to care.  Wasn't impressed with anything besides the warm greeting at the door."}
{"text":"It's a strange tavern. I can't remember the last time I walked through a bar that didn't play music. The food was just okay. We had wings and the special.  Nothing memorable and not worth coming back. I don't expect it to be here long"}
{"text":"Always have great service and delicious food when I come here, which is often. This place has so much more than just your typical \"bar food\" and their menu is incredibly vast. If you stop in on the right night you might even get a free glass to take home when you order a certain beer...tonight was Stella Artois night. AKA everyone at our table ordered one so that we could total our glass collection to the double digits so we never have to do dishes again.   The restaurant has a more formal dining area, as well as a bar setting in the back with high-tops. For dinner my group of 5 started with the Mac-n-cheese bites. Since I try not to eat a lot of cheese I have never tried them but my boyfriend and his family seem to love them (seeing as they ate them so quickly I was unable to snap a pic). My boyfriend also got a cup of chili with all the works because their chili he is never able to resist. Then for the meal we all split a huge basket of jerk fries (amazing rub with the perfect amount of spice). My boyfriends mom got a cheeseburger which she orders almost every time we are there she loves it so much. His dad got the BLT that he said was delicious. I have ordered this before and most definitely agree. My boyfriends sister got the grilled chicken salad that appeared to have loads of juicy chicken on it...yum! Last but never least, my boyfriend and I both got the Grecian salad with oil and vinegar, he added gyro meat to his minus black olives and I got mine without feta cheese. I live for this salad. It is so big it could feed an entire family and there would probably still be leftovers.   If you have never been to this place you should definitely go out of your way to give it a try. You will not be disappointed! Stellar service, food and drinks."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. Nice tavern / grill environment (nothing fancy). The food is better than BJ's & Rockne's but their menu pricing is higher than it should be for the food selection. (Sides are additional cost)  Lower your pricing and you'll do A LOT more business here. Good location. You should have a wait when you come here."}
{"text":"Ray's has great, great taps and good game-viewing space (out of town NFL fans beware: no NFL ticket here, meaning that you can't catch your favorite non-local team if it's not on a major network).  The food, however, leaves a lot to be desired - even after you've already lowered your expectations to \"sports bar\" level.  By way of example I'd like to build off of the \"Chris N.\" review below from 12/19/2014, who also makes the point I'm about to make.  His comment applied to a burger, and mine applies to a turkey sandwich I ordered a few months ago (I'm still in mourning).    Sandwich-Making 101 teaches us that when you put a moist mound of meat on top of a thin, cheap, flimsy, untoasted piece of pre-sliced bread, you will get an effect similar to dropping a wet cantaloupe into a paper grocery bag.  You have about 10 seconds before the meat soaks through the bread and leaves you with a messy pile of unsightly debris.   This is the reason that Jewish delis tend to butter and toast the bread for their reubens, why Cubans press their pork sandwiches, and why the French opt to put their sandwiches on sturdy baguettes.    If you order the turkey \"sandwich\" at Ray's, beware that you won't be getting the time-tested, solid engineering of the Italian panini or corned-beef-on-rye, and instead may find yourself picking, frustratedly, at a mound of what-could-have-been.  You may also find that the ingredients inside underwhelm: giant, stringy red onion slices, mealy tomato, and thick thick lettuce that compete too much with the very thin turkey.  Yeah, yeah I know - it's a 7 dollar pub sandwich.  If you've been to the Diamond Deli in Akron, though, you know that 7 dollars buys you perfection.     Ray's does deserve credit for their excellent staff that checks on you often and attends you very well, and the business has a strong reputation as a community favorite.  I salute any entrepreneur who can command this respect and whose business treats people nicely.   I just don't think I'll eat my dinner there the next time that I stop in to have a cold local draught beer."}
{"text":"Great food - the pastrami is house made and to die for; beer selection is outstanding, staff is amazing."}
{"text":"A bit disappointed by the beer selection. Food was mediocre. Nothing like Ray's Kent. Unsure if owner is the same.. Feels too much like the old Winking Lizard. A remodel / change of layout would've been nice."}
{"text":"Love this place. Fantastic beer selection. 60 taps. Is it just like Ray's in Kent? C'mon, its Fairlawn fer chrissakes! Take what you can get, and here, you can get alot. Love the menu and selections. If everything were 20% more expensive, I'd be less impressed. Let's just say, its damn good for the money. Yer not gonna get a better burger for less that $7 anywhere. We've since moved to over half hour away, but we make the trip for the cajun fries, the housemade parmesan peppercorn dressing and the Bohdi. Bohdi rocks!  The staff is very friendly and welcoming. I have noticed many have been with them since opening 3-4 years ago. If you get a chance, belly up to the bar. All the handles are impressive and they're quick to give you a sample of whatever catches your eye. I've met some interesting folks here. Its ClevelandAkronCanton, so ya gotta make the first move and open up first, but thats how ya meet great souls in this area. Be sure to try the \"nanobrew\" Mad Cap. Great story, great local folks. Ray's in Fairlawn is a treasure and I hope its here for decades to come. Peaceout!"}
{"text":"Great place to hangout and drinks some great beers on draft. Fast and friendly service. You will have all of the staff coming to your table and asking if you need anything. Huge bar and a large dinning area. Plenty of TV's to watch all the games and an outdoor area to soak up some sun. Clean restroom and good menu for kids. The wings are my favorite here. The pig rub wings are amazing!!! $-$$"}
{"text":"I have now been to this location 4 times and my only disappointment this trip was that despite spotting Unibroue beer all over their website being told that there was none to be had.  Fortunately Ray's is not short on alternatives so all was not lost. Still, I had to take away 1 star for the bad info.  For this trip my wife and I both had their weekend special cod. This was three HUGE pieces of fish in a rosemary beer batter served with fresh cut fries and coleslaw.  Fish was crisp on the outside and perfectly flaky inside. Fries were a mix of crisp and tender like fresh cuts often are. Cole slaw was crisp and surely made from fresh cabbage. Absolutely one of the best fish fries we have experienced in this Lenten season. Hope it sticks around."}
{"text":"Went to Rays early 6pm on a Saturday evening. It's a typical sports bar, it was not packed and we didn't experience a noise problem. The staff was excellent as service was quick and accurate. most of the food was well above average for bar food the Mo-Fo was another story. The main reason we went here was for this burger recommended by Michael Symon. it was outstanding. A huge greasy mess that required 4 napkins to eat put a huge smile on my face. $40 for 2 dinners and drinks was very reasonable for the quantity and quality of food.  Not something you can eat everyday but I will be back for another round very soon."}
{"text":"Okay, I get that this \"building\" was a Winking Lizard within the last few years, but to disparage a business because it doesn't live up to the standards of another business that inhabited the same building is not helpful in a restaurant review.  I could compare Ray's in Fairlawn to the Gamekeepers Taverne that resided at this site in the 1990s but what would that matter?  The interior is dark, covered in wood, and masculine.  We have been to the Ray's in Kent - loud college crowd, bright lighting, meat-market feel - and I prefer this Ray's.  The beer menu is impressive at both locations!  The wine list at Ray's in Fairlawn offers wines that are not generally offered by the glass on other restaurant menus.  I had the Troublemaker Red Blend which was amazing and well-priced.  I had buffalo wings and the roasted half chicken... it was all delicious!  My biggest issue is that the taps at the bar block the view of the bartenders so that it's not evident that a drink refill or food service is required.  This is remedied by jovial servers that introduce themselves by name so you can flag them down if you're parched.    Everyone here is friendly and they seem to be happy to work here.  It's also a GREAT place to watch a game (and there seems to be no shortage of sports experts to discuss our Cleveland teams with).  Overall this is an awesome place to watch a game, enjoy a decent meal, tip back a few impressive brews - and if you're lucky enough to have a companion - peruse a decent wine list."}
{"text":"His place was ok. I had the reuben. The housemade corned beef was great, as were the onion rings. The fries were lackluster. Overall, the food was not worth the price."}
{"text":"Basically your typical bar food and whatnot, not really that special. I got the chicken parmesan sandwich and it was kind of overly messy but okay. Prices are real cheap and it was a good alternative to a 45 minute wait at BJ's across the street."}
{"text":"Very good beer selection - worth the trip alone.  Wings are some of the best in town.  The rest of the menu is fine, but not spectacular.  Great place to watch a ballgame.  Family friendly through early evening."}
{"text":"Wholly LOUDNESS!!! I will give it 30 days and try it again... But they gotta fix the noise with what ever can work... Or I will go on record that they will be closed by x-mas... I have talked with many Freinds they all say the same thing... The easy fix is to not go back... I wanna give them a chance to correct the problem. We had a table of 8 and we could not here the others @ the far end of the table..."}
{"text":"Great burgers and beer. Get the bacon cheeseburger and you won't be let down. Messy with the works, but delicious. Hundreds of beers on tap. Don't listen to the negative reviews."}
{"text":"Nice beer selection, burgers look good.  Little too loud so if you are looking for something quiet this is not the place.    Not a bad place the food was decent but not 100% thrilled with the place.  I would come back to watch a game with a buddy, but to have a conversation with my wife was impossible...not saying that's a bad thing :)."}
{"text":"My kind of place! Many beers to choose from. Was in town for 4 nights, went there for dinner twice. Make it a stop if you are visiting Akron!"}
{"text":"Pretty amazing how a place can change so much when it becomes a new bar in the same building. Really a far cry from the previous establishment, even though it's the same place, and a far cry from the original Ray's in Kent.   The beer selection is OK, the food is OK, and the atmosphere is OK, but nothing really stands out. The entire place seems generic. The night we were there, it seemed like the few customers at the bar either worked there and just got off, or were friends with the bartenders. The extremely small crowd was odd to say the least. Seemingly newly 21-year-olds that thought it was ironic to play horrible music on the jukebox (Kid Rock, Kenny G, Nickelback, Lou Bega) while dancing like they were in A Night at the Roxbury were the standard for the night, and really killed the mood. It felt like I was joining them on their first legal night in a bar.   Next time I'll drive further down the road to the original establishment, where apparently all of the original clientele have gone. I don't see this Ray's lasting very long."}
{"text":"We are at Ray's at least once a week.  The staff is awesome and reasonable prices for the huge portions of food.  My husband and I usually split a meal.  Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Great service, great food, great beer selection! Couldn't be happier with my experience at rays. Different from Kent but still fantastic! Anything you could want on tap and even more in bottles. I love how the servers all work together to make sure I'm always taken care of. I even saw managers going around clearing tables and helping out, everyone was so friendly too! The food is out of this world, I've been there several times and loved everything i tried! No wonder the mofo is Michael Symons favorite burger, and the atmosphere just adds to the food and beer. Definitely gonna keep going!"}
{"text":"I had High Hopes I had the Ruben the Pumpernickel bun was dry and too much bread and then the Thousand Island dressing had horseradish which diminish the taste of the corn-beef the coleslaw was dry and should have been creamier stick to the classics used good Jewish rye bread and thousand island dressing don't goof it up"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and dig it. The burgers are good and the staff is great! The appetizers leave much to be desired but eh, it's good for a sports bar and the atmosphere is worth it as well."}
{"text":"As a Kent grad I was excited that good ole Ray's Place was coming to Fairlawn.  While I didn't expect it to have the same nostalgia,  I expected to enjoy it. I won't be back until the noise problem is fixed. I love the open feel from the changing from the Lizard but all the hard reflective surfaces make it impossible to enjoy. Invest in  ceiling sound absorbers or plexiglass dividers and I will be all about Rays."}
{"text":"Took my wife there for dinner, and for the most part, the food was ok.  The service was decent, and the prices were affordable.    There were a couple issues that I have with this place.  The first is the noise.  The redesigned dining area is louder than the bar.  A boisterous group of happy hour patrons were having an extremely loud conversation that bounced off the walls, making it impossible to have a conversation with my wife sitting across the table.  After 5 minutes, we contemplated just paying for our drinks and leaving, but instead we asked to be moved.  It was at this time our waitress told us that the bar is by far the most quiet room in the establishment.  Somehow this seems backwards.  Having visited the previous establishment in this building many times, I can attest that it was never a problem before.    The second issue I have is the lack of seating this particular night.  It was a nice night, but the patio seating was unavailable.  I would think that on a nice night, you would want those seats available.    Will we come back?  Some day I'm sure we will go back."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I stopped into this place last Thursday evening.  We were expecting a romantic evening for two with some delightful food, instead we were bombarded with the hairy eyeball from the numerous patrons and servers there.  Could have possibly been the sight of my abs, I know it promotes jealousy among people when I sport a half-shirt muscle shirt.  Anywho, we ordered the blazing hot chicken wings, french onion soup, and some oiled peppers appetizer.  The former two were absolutely delightful.    The oiled peppers though...well, the description read that various peppers would be \"drizzled\" with oil, and served with Ciabatta.  Instead we received what looked like an oil soup containing rather large slices of a single pepper, maybe 2 other peppers in there; the Ciabatta reminded me of the mutant croutons I experienced in some sad diner in Maine.   Suffice to say it took about half an hour before we could even dig into this disappointing dish due to the scalding temperature of the obviously generic restaurant grade oil.  Stay far away from this dish if possible, it did not bring back happy memories of my youth in Sicily...more like nightmares of my previous life where I was tarred and feathered for stealing a croissant from a traveling baker.    Lastly, we had 6 servers who obviously did not confer with each other that they had the same table; as such, we were inquired on our status every 30 seconds.  I know some people need validation that they are important to the world around them nearly all the time, but I already know this, so this was indubitably not required from the staff.  I hope they weren't displeased with the $6 tip I left them, times can get rough in West Akron, let me tell you."}
{"text":"Waited and waited for a host to greet and seat us but no one ever came over. Plenty of empty tables. Taking my appetite down the street where they want my business."}
{"text":"The MoFo rocks my world, the fries not so much!  Comfortable, easy atmosphere and good, friendly service.  We welcome this addition to our neighborhood."}
{"text":"Love this place, food is always a cut above, and the draft beer selection is awesome, 60 taps, and always something to like even for a beer snob like me.  They smoke in-house, so pastrami, ribs, chicken, etc. are wonderful, and their corned beef is right up there as well. Salads are over-sized and full of key ingredients, so if you order a steak and fry salad, there will be lots of both. Frankly, everything on the menu is a pleasure and the weekly specials are usually pretty, well special. Coupled with excellent service, this is the best pub style sports bar restaurant in the region."}
{"text":"First timer to the restaurant. It's ok, but I don't see any reason to go back. The service was good, nothing to brag about. Between the 3 of us, we ordered spaghetti, a burger and a steak salad, along with 2 French Onion soups. The soup was mediocre, very dark (that's a taste description, honestly), and we were kind of bummed that we'd paid for it. We assumed the burger came with fries (it doesn't, but it's our fault for not asking or reading the menu properly). We asked for the bacon to be crispy and for an addition of carmelized onions. The bacon was lumpy (which is disgusting, and if you eat your bacon lumpy, you need to stop eating bacon), and there were no onions. Our server didn't write down our orders, so I don't know if she just forgot or if the kitchen messed up. Either way, it was too late by the time she came back to check on us, so I told her to skip the onions and just not charge us for them.  We were really looking forward to this place, based on reviews. Unfortunately, we were disappointed. It's not terrible, but there are better places in the area."}
{"text":"2 stars for beer selection.   0 for anything else.  Yikes, guys. This isn't good. We went in on a Saturday night during holiday shopping season. It was one of few places we thought wouldn't have a long wait. We got one of the last open tables.  It felt chaotic inside. One of those meals where you aren't sure who your server is. Maybe that's their plan, but at least 4 people came to our table. More on why this matters later...  I'm a burger lover and usually not overly picky.  When I saw the menu was primarily sandwiches and burgers I thought that must be the specialty.  The burger itself actually wasn't bad, in defiance of the sloppy pool of grease all over it. They offer \"the works\" on it which consists of all those common plentiful condiments you'd find at a place like Five Guys. So here's where it all \"fell apart\" (forward thinking pun):  They use the cheapest buns that a grocer can sell. I mean, the last time I had a bun of this quality, I was a freshman in college surviving on the lowest grade food and beer.   So now you have this greasy burger with tons of condiments and a bun that is screaming in submission as it deflates and succumbs to the over-absorption of burger sweat like single-ply TP the day after atomic wings. After mere seconds your burger bun falls to soaked remnants of a tortured ending as you stare at a burger you were never given a fair shot to consume properly.   So my advice would be to bring your own bun for a transplant procedure or to upgrade to a pretzel bun (if offered).  Oh, and once we had finished, although 4-5 waiters (?) had visited our table during our short meal, we sat there unsure of who to flag down for the check after 20 minutes of foodless plates and empty glasses. None of the aforementioned 5 were eager to see us go, perhaps out of appreciation for my staunch, barbaric, grease fist effort to consume that burger."}
{"text":"I have been to this location twice now.  I have gotten the Cuban sandwich both times.   And I have absolutely loved it both times.   The Cuban sandwich is huge and I've taken half the sandwich home both times.   I have gotten the nachos and there very good.   The wait staff are very quick and are always on the ball.  I have never had slow service.   My gf has gotten the the steak salad and the gyro salad and was pleased with her selections both times.   Salads are huge btw, I recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere. Good food. Friendly service. Lots and lots of beers on tap at affordable prices. This is a nice hangout."}
{"text":"I frequented this building back when it was the Winking Lizard, and as I live practically right around the corner, I figured it only fair to give Ray's Place a shot. The entire experience felt very generic and unimpressive. The beer selection was mediocre and seemed a bit pricey outside of happy hour. As others have said, burgers and sandwiches do not come with a side of fries. Even the bartenders were cordial but not very personable. The only true standout of the night were the wings. Big, meaty and cooked to perfection, they are the only reason I would come back to Ray's, but even they can only be ordered by the dozen. Overall, a very unimpressive experience."}
{"text":"Easily a favorite for me. It's hard to argue with a guy like Michael Symon when he says there \"mofo\" is the best burger he's ever had. Definitely ranks up there for me too. And the beer selection is excellent."}
{"text":"Awesome place to watch a game, so many big TVs!   We sat at the bar and had amazing service. Highly recommend stopping by Ray's and trying their food and drinks. We had their wings...absolutely delicious. And their Greek salad was so good as well. I had to try their Cuba sandwich, the best thing I've ever tried.   Highly recommend this place :)"}
{"text":"GREAT beer. Minus when the beer lists do not reflect what is actually on draft. Horrible service at the bar, same bar tender, still unsure of name because he never introduces himself, been here very many times. Would love to be a regular customer but I always leave feeling insulted  and disregarded. Employees seem to be full grown and playing hide and go seek while clocked in. WILL NOT BE BACK."}
{"text":"This is an awesome place.  The food was homemade, the employees were welcoming and were always attending to our needs. I had the meat loaf, smashed red potatoes with brown gravy. The meat loaf was moist and tasty, the potatoes were great."}
{"text":"I came here on a Friday to catch up with some old friends and have some beers. It was not overly busy and I was able to have a normal conversation without having to raise my voice. The feel is pretty much like the old Winking Lizard. The only changes I noticed were there seemed to be more wood and the televisions were different. Otherwise, the dining room/bar, table set up, and bar looked exactly the same.  Beer selection and price was good. The service was good as we weren't in a time crunch, nor did we need to worry about the timing of a meal. But I could see how confusion could arise if there is a breakdown in communication. It could also lead to problems if everyone is sharing tips equally. But that is another discussion.  I can't say much about the food, but this would be a place to hang out, drink, and watch sports."}
{"text":"Uuuugh.  I've patronized the \"original\" Ray's in Kent on and off for years.  Suffice it to say -- \"this ain't.\"  Here's a brief summary of today's visit:  Six of us went in for dinner.  I had the garden burger, a beer and I ordered a basket of fries for the table.  The burger was nasty -- mushy, tasteless and, well, most of it did not get eaten.  The texture was really bad.  The fries (Ray's was once known for the fries ...) were luke-warm and very soggy with oil.  Sat around too long?  Cooked too cold?  Dunno.  But, they were not good.  (I think 3-4 of the entrees were served with fries -- most went back to the kitchen.)    The service was good.  Lots of TVs.  Even though there were not many people there the place was noisy.  (Why do I need a TV during dinner?)  As we drove home, and passed places where we'd never eat -- Applebees, Olive Garden, etc., we remarked that they looked pretty good compared to the place we just left.  And, I guess that's the point -- I can't think of a single reason to return to Ray's."}
{"text":"Food is typical bar food, not bad, it is a little noisy but it's a bar. The beer selection is very good and the service is outstanding. I will be back."}
