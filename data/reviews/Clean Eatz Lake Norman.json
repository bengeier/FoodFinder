{"text":"First time here. Really good food. Correct portions and really fresh. Free fruit soaked water is nice too!"}
{"text":"Love this place, healthier options and alternatives to everyday fast food and quick serve restaurants. Their weekly meal plans are also amazing and the correct amount of portions for a well balanced overall diet.  They will even make things low carb and gluten free for you! Meal plans average about 6.50 a meal and the cafe is about 7.99 a meal! Affordable and healthy!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service! Been ordering all my meals from here lately. Also good prices! Only thing I wish they would do is label your custom pick up meals with how many carbs, protein, fat grams are in them like they do on the meals you can buy premade in the fridges."}
{"text":"The portion was extremely small, half a sandwich and not even a half cup of chickpea salad for $10. It looks like they have decent variety of menu items and I'll be back to try some other things.."}
{"text":"Lot of options to choose from, price is reasonable. I ordered cauliflower tossed is buffalo sauce, probably would not order again. I did try one of the frozen dinners I can possibly return and try again worth the price. I love their cucumber water so refreshing."}
{"text":"One star for lack of integrity. We rushed to make it there in time to purchase prepared meals for the week. Got there five minutes before the closing time clearly posted on the door. Staff standing inside pointedly ignored me outside the locked door knocking. Forget that they locked the door five minutes before the posted closing time, they didn't give the common courtesy of acknowledging us one way or another. Very poor customer service."}
{"text":"Delicious healthy food at an affordable price which is hard to come by! I bought 12 meals and it was my first time there. I cannot wait to come back and try different ones. The employees were so friendly and helpful also."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time. Food was very good and the staff were so nice! Im a bit of a picky eater and am trying to eat healthier and I think this is a great place to get used to healthier options that still taste good! Hummus & Pita snack was our fav! And the employee offered alternatives for my even pickier 2 yr old which was very helpful! Id like to go again and try more before giving 5 stars.."}
{"text":"We love this place, it's right next to Core fit 24 gym and it just feels great to grab a healthy snack after working out.  The restaurant is extremely clean and the service is fast a d friendly.  My wife had a salad with salmon and it was amazing.  They even have a meal plan that you order on the weekend and pick up a full weeks worth of food on Monday.  That just makes like so much easier."}
{"text":"Ok so i really want to love this place buttt is having some issues which I hope can be improved. First is that in the majority of my meals that contain chicken I keep getting pieces of cartilage which is a huge pet peeve of mine and then just ruins the whole meal for me. It's not like this happened once it's been most. Which then makes me not want to eat chicken for while. Second thing is the actual flavor of some meals. The teriyaki with the rice noodles had barley any sauce and zero flavor to any of the meal. The slow cooker Mexican chicken as well was really lacking in flavor. It smelled really good and was hopeful but I couldn't even finish it because of the lack of flavor. Had to take the avocado off too since it was bitter and just not good. Pot stickers are my favorite thus far. Steak dishes are good as well. Please tho try and cut all the cartilage pieces out of the chicken it's really grossing me out! I will continue to come here in hopes the actual flavor of the meals improves."}
