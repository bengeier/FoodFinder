{"text":"Located in a cozy corner just east of Bathurst on Dupont lies Fanny Chadwick's, a fine little restaurant offering a nice selection of breakfast, sandwich and salad options.  During lunch the atmosphere is quiet and cozy...somewhere in between a traditional diner and a page out of a Canadian Living magazine. A great place for individuals or small groups. Service is pleasant.  The ingredients in each meal I've had have been so fresh and tasty. The menu mentions that they get their ingredients from sustainable and environmentally-responsible sources. If you happen to be in for lunch, I recommend their Grilled Cheese sandwich, Country Fresser or Classic Mac and Cheese. Be sure to add an order of fries or onion rings, they know how to make them right. Check out the photos that I've posted.  Definitely worth re-re-revisiting to try their other options!"}
{"text":"Been here three times - terrible service 2/3 times. Food is mediocre at best (especially compared to fantastic restaurants nearby). Fanny's built its reputation when Dupont was a food desert, but there's no need for Annex dwellers to subject themselves to overcooked potato wedges, tasteless omelettes and unwashed side salads any longer. That said, the food is divine compared to some of the staff. One male waiter in particular could not be more rude if he tried. We showed up one weekday morning at opening and were inexplicably refused a booth, only to watch the booths remain empty for the next hour and a half. Another day, he all but threw my meal at me for asking him to seat my aging mother and me in a quieter area. This could be all my fault, of course - a traumatic past seating incident, no doubt. The same man glared at me - silent - when I asked him to bring me ketchup (wouldn't dignify this with a reply). Side note: their \"homemade ketchup\" is garbage. Next time I hear someone rave about Fanny Chadwick's, I'm sending them a Schmaltz care package b/c they clearly survive on pop tarts and toilet water."}
{"text":"I have been here 3 times for Sunday Brunch and have yet to be disappointed. The pancakes are superb. Their beef hash is a specialty and you can't go wrong with the different varieties of Eggs Benedict. Specialty omelets with different cheeses are  great. They have freshly squeezed juices in an 8 oz cup. Small quantity but delicious. In the summer enjoy their leaf shaded patio. Unfortunately, you cannot reserve, so there's always a wait. At 11, this is typically 20 minutes, so bring an iPad or newspaper. If you don't mind eating at the bar, there is no wait. Prices are reasonable for the excellent meal."}
{"text":"We went for brunch over the weekend. The Finnish pancakes were excellent (but we asked for the banana topping instead of the original orange/cranberry compote). My husband wasn't impressed with his omelette however. Service was great, fast and friendly. I'd return for the Finnish pancakes for sure!"}
{"text":"Near Tarragon, fast service, outstanding Latino dishes, ribs mole, Mexican sausages, Caesar with pork rinds and anchovies. Secret - lemon grass. Buffalo milk ice cream"}
{"text":"Went for brunch on Sunday before the Santa Clause Parade with friends and the kids.  Great brunch of omelets, Finnish pancakes, and churizo!  lucked out and grabbed the table by the front.  place was packed by 10:30 with a line up until we left...sign of a great place.  friendly staff and nice atmosphere. there is an interesting story behind Fanny and the pictures help tell the story. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Excellent Diner Food! Words I never thought I would be able to use together. Sure, diner food is good and all. Tasty. Salty. Fried. Homey. But excellent! That is saying something! And the fact that I was there with four extremely picky eaters and the menu held up for each and every one of them (my 14 year old sister got a fennel and corn omlette, of which she ate every bite stating, \"Wow--this is great!\")  I had the beef brisket hash (something I would never dream of ordering in a million years) and it blew me out of the water. So extremely tasty I was shocked. My parents went for the Huevos Rancheros (again, completely out of character for them too) and they were agreeing that it was fantastic. Big portions, stylized and tastsful, all served up in a clean, well decorated, modern space. Also, good service.   That's it. I'm going to have to break my code and give Fanny Chadwick's five stars (even though it isn't an Asian place...)"}
{"text":"I've been a big fan of this restaurant ever since it opened up in the neighbourhood and is a much-welcome change to Dupont from that super-sketch Chinese diner that used to be there.   They make everything in-house (even their marshmallows for the hot chocolate!) and it really shows in the high quality of the food.  Their burger is awesome, and I had their sausage, which is the best I've ever had in a restaurant.  (No jokes about having their sausage!)  Not very many vegetarian options for you veggies out there, but my friend really enjoyed their Veggie Ragu.  The staff has always been very friendly, and I really like the way the space has been set up.  Lots of tables, booths, and bar stools at a counter if you're just there for one of their addictive cinnamon buns.  (My wife threatened divorce the next time I go without her and don't bring one of those home)  Their prices were originally a bit higher, which kept me from being a regular, but I went in today and they seem to have come down slightly.  That being said, locally-sourced ingredients for everything must not be super cheap, I guess.   Favourite of all is their brunch.  Build-your-own Benny is awesome (I'm a bit of a Benny snob), and my daughter wolfs down their pancakes.  And mmmmmmbacon.   If you're going for brunch, try to get their between 10:00am-10:30am to beat the rush!  It fills up fast!"}
{"text":"Great brunch experience at a small independent restaurant. Loved the atmosphere and service was great. Appreciated recommendations we were given and loved that there was a build  your own benny option on the menu. The bacon was incredible and coffee was good. Will look forward to coming in the summer to sit on the patio!"}
{"text":"Best brunch in the Annex.  They house smoke all of their meat (including a rotating selection of fish), make great sides, and have an excellent selection of craft beers.  The only drawback is that you need to arrive early to beat the hipsters to a table or you'll end up standing in line. They do however serve coffee to the people in line so it could be worse.  Eat here!"}
{"text":"While visiting Toronto, I happened upon this gem for breakfast as they were opening up one cold morning. I asked the waitress for the house specialty, and got a house-smoked brisket with root vegetables and two over-easy eggs, and washed down with a pint of their porter on tap. I coasted through the rest of the day in lukewarm ethereal trans, which nobody could spoil. I long to return to Toronto so I can repeat the experience."}
{"text":"Really delicious food (was there for brunch) and terrific ambiance! Gets a bit crowded on weekends, which is a testament to the food, but you could be sitting cozily next to your table neighbours. Definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"I'm so glad that my boyfriend and I have decided to check out this place today.  I didn't pay a lot of attention to all the buzz that other reviewers were  talking about, but I have to say Fanny Chadwick did a good job on its design and decor, because that's what caught me! I love checking out trendy diners/cafe around T.O.  From their menu, you can tell they specialize in making everything in-house...their home made apple spice sausage, smoked fish and smoked brisket...   We ordered a smoke fish benny with salad and a 'farm egg with sausage, toast and potato.  Smoke Fish Benny - I really liked their hollandaise sauce, it was just right, not too thick and rich. Sometimes it's just too rich with the poach egg, and could really stuff you for the rest of the day. The salad is also one of the best too, really fresh mixed green with their homemade salad dressing (I believe it is made of dijon mustard and some vingerette and honey...it was very refreshing!  Farm egg with sausage - although it looks very simple, but the egg was so perfectly cooked! This is so hard to find! the potato was just okay..nothing too special. I do have to say their homemade ketchup/tomato sauce was pretty good.  Finally, my cappuccino was good too. I will be back for lunch / dinner and will definitely order my coffee again!"}
{"text":"Love the menu since it was revamped -- pretty much all Mexican.  Many great dishes to choose from and good for gluten-free people."}
{"text":"While the service was polite if a bit aloof, the food was a disaster. I requested Huevos Rancheros...my god...tasteless and my husband requested pancakes....he barely ate them. They look unappetizing and they tasted....like something was off. .....Basically $50 to the garbage. Ah...a tiny glass of orange juice for $4. The place was packed, I have no idea why. Never again."}
{"text":"Great place for a quick but classy lunch. Really enjoyed the poutine fish sandwich and onion rings. Boy do they know how to make onion rings!!  Yummmm. The prices are very reasonable for the amount and quality of the food. Bravo."}
{"text":"I'd give five stars for their eggs benedict and house-made ketchup alone. Everything at our table was delicious. Apparently, I would put up with anything to eat this food.  That included forty-five minutes waiting in the cold. They're going to be on You Gotta Eat Here soon, so I'm going to have to remember to allow for even more time the next time I go there for brunch. But the food made it worth the wait.  We were a bit surprised at our server's reaction when we ordered a round of beermosas and mimosas. It's on your brunch menu, so I'd prefer if you didn't act all surprised when we order those to drink with our brunch. Especially after we froze our asses off waiting to get in. But damned if the food wasn't so good that I'll forgive and forget. Definitely worth a return trip."}
{"text":"We happened to discover this cute little restaurant while wandering Toronto.  The food and service were excellent!  The prices were very fair.  We highly recommend this little restaurant.  It is nice to see people take a chance, live their dream and provide excellent food and faire to the public."}
{"text":"After visiting Casa Loma, we needed to find a place within walking distance to grab a late lunch. My husband and I both ordered the special - a grilled chicken sandwich on fresh focaccia with mayo, apples, onions, and pickled zucchini. Great mix of favors. The onion rings were outstanding!  It was easy to get a table since the lunch hour had passed. Service was prompt & friendly."}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh and inventive comfort food with solid service. I've been coming here for over a year (never for brunch btw) and the service has been much faster recently. They also recently switched up some their menu to make their frying oil gluten free which is a game changer for gluten intolerant people as we can now have fries! It's become one of our favorite neighborhood spots."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic place to have a bite to eat!   Even though it's a little further out that some may venture get yourself to the Casa Loma for a morning wander around the amazing building and rooms then saunter down to Chadwick's for a late lunch. You won't be disappointed!  Fast and very friendly service (we were well looked after by the lovely Jessa!) and an excellent menu of brunch items. Everything is freshly made right there!  Very well worth dropping by."}
{"text":"One of our favourite places for brunch!  Everything homemade- even the ketchup and the marshmallows!  Love the build your own benny, and the pancakes with bananas.  We've waited outside on cold days.  The waitress was super nice and even gave us freshly made chocolate chip cookies. We were also able to order coffee while outside waiting for a table.  Great food and service!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and been mostly impressed with the food, although I think it's a bit overpriced for what you get--especially for the vegetarian dishes.   My big complaint is around the service. At best, it was totally indifferent. At worst, there seemed to be no thought about the customers. We were there for about two hours and a good half hour of the time the staff were cleaning cutlery two feet from our table and dropping them into containers over and over and over again. This meant lots of really loud and unpleasant noise and made it hard to enjoy dinner/a conversation. We had to repeatedly ask for water, the bill came without our asking, and it was unclear who our sever was. It was a disappointing overall experience."}
{"text":"Went this morning to Chadwick's for brunch with my friends and found it really nice! It has a really cute and cozy atmosphere and their brunch is pretty reasonable priced compared to a few other brunch restaurants I've gone to.   I had the Rancheros which was really tasty! Maybe a bit on the spicier side for me but I'm a bit of a wimp when it comes to spices! Overall I really enjoyed it! I also really liked that for your side dish they gave a mix of salad and potatoes as I was struggling to pick which one I wanted.   I'll definitely return one day for brunch and I'd be interested in trying their dinner menu too!"}
{"text":"The food took forever and the Cesar's are not very good BUT the eggs rancheros were really good."}
{"text":"The food is good but they don't let you sit down until your whole party has arrived, even if you are only waiting on one other person. IMO that's horrible customer service. Toronto has a lot of great brunch spots - don't waste your time here."}
{"text":"The food was good. Not the best I've ever had but definitely good. It was the service that was horrific. It's slow and the staff is unfriendly. Our servers was BY FAR the rudest server I've ever had. I had to double check with my brunch partner that what was happening was real 'was she really THAT rude?!' It really ruined our whole experience and meal. Will most definitely not be back."}
{"text":"NOT A CHILD FRIENDLY place. I went there with my friend, my 5 year old and my baby. We were 3 people plus a stroller. I asked for a table and they pointed to one that could accomodate the stroller but would not let me put the stroller there cause they said there was not enough room to go by.... but there was plenty. They said I had to fold up my stroller. So I did. Then later noticed at the same place they had said they could not put the stoller they had set and extra chair to make the booth of 4 ppl into a 5. That was not very nice because obviousely there was enough room.  Other then that which was rude, the food was great."}
{"text":"Great food, terrible service. The server was abrupt and shot us glares each time we interacted with him. Would definitely go back for the food, provided the server wasn't working."}
{"text":"Incredible brunch! Everything always fresh, house-made, and flavourful. Excellent menu that goes beyond the standard eggs n bacon. Also, when there is a line, they often come out and serve you coffee and/or banana bread for free! A nice touch that reminds waiting patrons they haven't been forgotten.   Finnish pancakes...the best you can get outside of the Hoito (Thunday Bay). I've had the classic (fruit and maple syrup) and the stuffed (goat cheese, pear, maple syrup) and both are terrific!  Smoked brisket hash is also AMAZING. Brisket falls apart on your fork and has a real smoked flavour. The potatoes are done right...diced and pan fried with onion and green pepper until browned.   Speaking of smoked...their house smoked fish is outstanding.  Solid beer lineup too if you're looking for an eye opener ;)."}
{"text":"Great brunch place! I've been here several times. The homemade sticky buns are so d-lish! I recommend sharing one. Also, it there is a long wait, they will provide coffee while you wait."}
{"text":"This restaurant is at the top of my street and I would always see lineups every weekend. Finally got around tp trying it out. Food was delicious and well worth the wait (and it was long)! I had the huevos rancheros and my partner had the Finish pancakes.  We were both impressed and probably rolled home after, we were so full. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem and much needed in North Annex!!!  The decor is warm and inviting, yet stylish...love the wood countertops and colour scheme.  Very clean and friendly attentive staff that greeted us right away despite being very busy. I  have been back for lunch on numerous occasions since fist going and have yet to be disapointed.  The club sandwich with smoked yummy bacon, avocado and absolutely perfectly roasted chicken is moist and delicious!   The gruyere mac & cheesee is to die for with homemade croutons that offer a little crunch to every yummy cheesy bite!  The soups are always good too!  I  have yet to go for dinner but look forward to trying it soon!"}
{"text":"A couple of meals now and I'm thrilled this place is in the neighborhood.  Brunch last time was rock solid - one of the most expertly prepared omelets I've ever had - it was like it had been an acre of thin, light fluffy egginess that was folded over and over and over again.    Dinner tonight was great - the cheese plate was a nice selection with some interesting accoutrements, my steak was well prepared and a nice piece of meat and the tart was the highlight - a wonderful dish.    Only disappointment was a lackluster wine list, but at this place I should probably be drinking beer, anyway.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Okay food, meh service, won't go out of my way to go back.  I had high expectations based on the other reviews here on this site. My experience was confused. I could not quite figure out where the menu was coming from. Could be its just as simple as \"comfort food with a difference for the sake of being different\". I ordered the mac and cheese. It was good, but only good, not fantastic. My dining partner had the grilled cheese with brussel sprouts - it was good, but not fantastic.   The pricing is one step up from a greasy spoon, and I suppose the food is too - but just one step.   This place misses for me... apparently for others it doesn't."}
{"text":"I ordered the custom Benny and it didn't have any flavour. For an extra $2.50, I ordered the bacon which I barely ate because of the poor cut of meat. The potatoes were almost cold and even though the London Fog came within two minutes after ordering, it was lukewarm. Not sure if they have new owners, but the place has a different feel than it did six months ago. I had to wait 20 minutes to pay for my bill. I won't be back which is disappointing because I liked this place in the winter and last summer."}
{"text":"Had dinner here twice -- they seem to have a Jekyll and Hyde thing going on, because our first time was a delight and the second time was offensively bad. Staff turnover? Different crews on different nights? I don't know what happened, but I won't be back.  Dr. Jekyll: Dinner (around Nov 2014) was delicious and fun. Our waitress was friendly and funny, talked to us about her favourites from the food and beer menus, and steered us toward some delicious dishes. Wonderful, tasty, creative food, and great beer. Well worth the price, which isn't exorbitant.  Mr. Hyde: Dinner again (around Dec 2014). We had previously been told they were changing the menu, so we were excited to see what new dishes they had in store for us. The place was hardly busy -- about half empty -- but our waitress, in addition to being sullen and abrupt, didn't manage to fill our water glasses once in the 90+ minutes it took to have our order taken and for our food to arrive. Seriously: over an hour for the food after ordering it. No explanation. No apology. And not a busy night. To add injury to insult, the brisket \"mashup\" was so perfunctory it seemed like a joke. A few small bites of brisket with a subtle glaze on a pile of dry, unseasoned mashed potatoes. Garnish with a slice of raw jalapeno and a sprig of cilantro. Voila! It was really, really crap. For 17 bucks, this was offensive, especially given the service.   We also had the fried chicken, which was okay but unremarkable.   The one saving grace of the evening was the winter salad, which we LOVED. Maybe that's why this isn't a one-star review. Or maybe it's because I had such a nice time the first time. It's all very sad, because we thought we'd found a new favourite, and I just won't risk ruining another evening by going back."}
{"text":"I've been twice around 1pm for Brunch and although there was a line both times -to be expected-, it went by quickly enough. Their Beef Brisket Hash is soo yummy and the portions are large. The service is friendly and attentive, and I will be back soon to try something different so I can recommend that."}
{"text":"Incredible!  These guys make everything inhouse,and I mean everything!  I had the best Caesar salad of my life, with inhouse smoked bacon and some mexican cheese that knocked my socks off. Fantastic craft beer selection and great atmosphere.  Cozy, great knowledgable staff and wonderful menu. Go there!!!"}
{"text":"I honestly don't know what took me so long to write about Fanny's, since I've now been twice. But it's a really nice place for brunch.   As has been mentioned previously, the location's good, and the establishment is cozy. The first time, I think my friends and I waited about 20 minutes for seats; yesterday, we just walked right in and got a booth, no problem. All depends on when you go, I suppose. And servers are nice, too.  Food's tasty, too! I've had the Finnish pancakes with fruit compote, and the Two Fresh Farm Eggs (scrambled). Both times, I've asked for the sausage, which is soo savoury. My friend (who introduced me to this place) swears by the Build Your Own Benny. And I love the fact they make their own ketchup.   Hopefully I'll be back again, so I work on eating my way through the menu!"}
{"text":"Comfort food indeed... They took the classics - burger, grilled cheese, chicken sandwich, split pea soup, hash, Mac and cheese... And turned them gourmet. Simple and enhanced, delicious. Worth a visit."}
{"text":"We were big fans of Fanny Chadwick's and are now fans of Chadwick's. The service is always super friendly and helpful (at these prices I expect a server to have tried the menu and they have!), the beer flights are fun, and the food is - whilst not \"lite\" - very delicious.  It is a bit pricier now that everything is sold separately, but we appreciate the quality of the ingredients and care taken to prepare the food. We had a brisket sandwich, Mac n cheese, fried chicken and coleslaw between 2 of us and it was more than enough as everything we chose on our last visit was so rich.   Great neighbourhood vibe, high quality ingredients, varied and interesting beers and cider on tap - highly enjoyable."}
{"text":"Went for brunch. Good... not great. Prices are a tad high for what you get. Hot sauce was nice however. Friendly service, but slow to receive food."}
{"text":"New menu is cool, lots of barbecue style dishes (brisket, ribs) with good sides.  Beer list is still solid."}
{"text":"This place converted me from a person who didn't care for breakfast to a fan. I had the Rancheros and they were delicious! Not to mention the house made sauces and caesar. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We stopped in for Sunday brunch to try somewhere new and were not disappointed!  The restaurant is fairly small with a kind of a modern diner feel inside.  The line was quite long when we arrived but they managed to seat us at the bar. We both had their brisket hash which was incredible. They make their own hot sauce which is fantastic - VERY spicy! They also make their own Radlers with fresh squeezed juice which was very refreshing. Lastly, the service was great, very friendly and accommodating despite how bust the restaurant was.   I would highly recommend if you are looking for good brunch in the Annex."}
{"text":"My rating would be more of a 3.5.   I was super excited to go to Chadwicks for brunch as I saw so many good reviews. Overall, the food was good but I will admit the service was pretty slow.   When you walk in, it'll feel like you're walking into a cute, little cozy diner. It was a freezing that day and my 2 girlfriends and I got seated right at the back corner table - it was snug, but we were warm and appreciated the extra seating for our purses #girlproblems.   We started off with coffee and water. Coffee was quite good. But this was where I found the service lacked. Typically, water or coffee is refilled or you are at least asked if you want to refill. But ours never was. We waved the servers a couple of times to ask for a refill and finally on the 3rd request they got back to us. The restaurant was busy but refilling drinks seems like a natural thing to do at a restaurant from a servers perspective. Maybe it's different here?   Of everything on the menu, I was trying to decide between The Lonely Burger or Rancheros. I ended up with the Rancheros. It was perfect - light but filling and delicious for my 5'3 athletic appetite. The beans and the runny egg were a great combination together.   Even with the slow service, I'd go again to give it a second and possibly even third try. The food and prices are great!"}
{"text":"Price? -Overall: 6.5/10 (10 means really expensive)  Service: 7/10  Food: 7/10 -Finish pancake 8/10 -Fanny's Huevos Rancheros 6/10  Food amount: 8/10 (10 means a lot)  Environment: 9/10 Crowded but warm. French design."}
{"text":"Amazing brunch, great service and a cozy atmosphere. Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Not impressed at all, I went here mainly because the Venezuelan Breakfast caught my eye on their online menu. When I placed my order at 10:50am, the place opens at 10am, the waiter said they were out! I expressed my surprise of how could you be out after being open less than an hour, his explanation was that almost every table ordered the same thing! So if you're running an establishment properly, and know your \" hot items\" it would be smart to have the ability to serve said item!  I settled for the Huevos Rancheros, which were bland and flavorless, as was my companions dish. At almost $55.00 with tip and tax, I say skip it!"}
{"text":"This was one of the best brunches I've had in ages. We waited 15 mins at peak brunch time (12pm) and as soon as we sat down we had great service and everything arrived quickly. I ordered the rancheros and my bf got the brisket eggs benny and the Japanese pancake. Everything was cooked to perfection. Not a single complaint to be made. The atmosphere is super relaxed and comfy. I can't wait to go back and try more on the menu. Getting the perfect brunch on a Sunday to satisfy your cravings is super important and Chadwick's nailed it."}
{"text":"Chadwick's has been touted to be many of my friend's favourite brunch place, which obviously means I have to test it for myself!   I've therefore been to Chadwick's twice, and tried most of the brunch items since my friends and I decided to do shareplates of each. My reaction to my first visit is an overwhelming, when that was good, but not outstanding. My second visit, was a lot similar to the first, good but not outstanding. To be honest, I visited again because I felt I was missing something. What did everyone see and taste that I didn't?  The prices are by no means cheap as well. The Beef Brisket Hash was probably my favourite item, but it's also $16 of potatoes with bits of beef. The omelette, was an omelette with sauce that I didn't really think went 100% with the dish. The Venezulan breakfast was really good, with the little crunch of popcorn, and the rancheros was delicious, topped with a generous helping of avocado. The food was delicious, and I hope a trip here would definitely not lead to a bad meal. The servers were always delightful and happy to help.  What I'm missing is some sort of wow factor. It's decent food at prices that don't really warrant it with the ingredients used. I'm just a little puzzled about the long line ups and hype. It's not bad for sure, but that's just it, it's just pretty good."}
{"text":"The smoked beef brisket hash is simply amazing. They have the best pancakes I've ever had and I've never been much of a fan of pancakes. The freshly squeezed OJ is a must. If you're hungry, you've come to the right place. You'll get a hefty amount of food for a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Chadwick's (formerly Fanny Chadwick) is definitely a favourite.  We've been here a few times, always for brunch.   The food has always been fantastic!!!  It was recently renovated and the menu changed a little bit however all the changes have been for the best.  The place looks wonderful and the menu items are all really attractive. (Although I must say the former outside sign was MUCH prettier and much more appealing....not a fan of the new sign..)    We had the Rancheros (awesome!) and I had had the brisket before the renovations and it was delicious (very filling though).  The patio seems lovely.  The service is good and friendly but it can take long if they are busy.   The only down side is that the tables are too close together and it really feels too tight when it is very busy.  Also they don't let you take a booth if there's only two... even when they're not busy (which made no sense to me and bothered me when we went)."}
{"text":"We thoroughly enjoyed our brunch here, it was worth the wait! The Finnish pancakes are delicious! I would totally recommend this place, be prepared to line up on the weekend to get a table!"}
{"text":"Really wanted to like this place. Massive recommendation from a friend who knows her food. I ordered the brisket and it was an overcooked chewy meat cuboid. Side salad was a giant bowl of lettuce and dressing. I wanted to like it. Wanted so bad..."}
{"text":"This was a great breakfast spot!!! Very homey vibe and cozy interior. The food is amazing quality and the portion siZes are huge and well worth the price. The location is very convenient short walk from DuPont subway. The only downfall is it gets quite busy so it may be a long wait, however they offered us fresh coffee with frequent refills throughout our wait,"}
{"text":"Very good local spot for brunch. It gets quite busy on the weekend, so go early. I really enjoy the Finnish pancakes and the huevos rancheros, and some of their daily specials have been pretty good too. The prices are pretty reasonable for the area and the service is good. The menu is fairly limited, which I like, but could be an issue for some people. The food isn't too pretentious, which is also a nice change from a lot of other brunch places."}
{"text":"Had the most delicious omelette there this Morning. Great service, charming decor and delicious food. Lovely bread, ham and a variety of cheeses."}
{"text":"Awesome food. Had the yummy huevos rancheros, hubby had the hash. We were stuffed. Sat at the bar, were fortunate to get the last 2 seats before having to wait. Not a huge restaurant, the wait looked quite long, but I totally would have waited for those eggs. Service was pretty good, food came out quick. This is our new favorite brunch place."}
{"text":"FABULOUS! Attentive service, fair price & great food! Had the Finnish pancakes - thin, light & layered. Reminiscent of the Hoito in Thunder Bay! And topped with spiced apple compote (think thick apple sauce) and a dollop of ricotta -Yum! The peameal is good & thick, and the ever-important coffee went down well. I'll happily return with friends & family!"}
{"text":"A great spot for a quick bite to eat. There was a outside seating option and small bar. The food was excellent, the service was excellent and we were able to thank the chef which made it personal. I would definitely visit again."}
{"text":"We live in the area and this is becoming our go to brunch / lunch place. We sat out on the patio for lunch yesterday. It's right on DuPont but there are high cedar walls and fake grass so it feels private and comfy. The menu is fun and inventive and it seems like most things are made in house. Service is fast, friendly and professional. I had the huevos rancheros with a side of their house smoked brisket. It was really really good. I was tasting smoke in my mouth for the rest of the afternoon and that was a good thing. The house made hot sauce I believe is a scotch bonnet sauce and had considerable heat and great flavour. We will be back here again soon."}
{"text":"My review is framed through the lens of a neighbourhood lady who appreciates an unplanned meal here or a relaxed beer flight with a loved one. This is not necessarily a spot that I would recommend to an outsider as a destination weekend brunch spot. I don't think waiting in a line with expectations is the proper way to enjoy Fanny's.  That being said, I still want to give them props via Yelp.   My ideal experience is sitting on the lovely patio, noshing on their delicious Finnish Pancakes with a side of smoked fish served in a jar."}
{"text":"This brunch spot almost makes it into the 4 star category, although I would rate it at 3.5 stars. The location is great; ambiance was pleasant and very bright, despite being very busy.  I would definitely come early.    The wait time in total was for about 1 hour, despite the hostess telling us that it was only going to be a 15 minute wait.  I guess the bonus was that they did come outside to call out your name, so you don't necessarily have to wait inside.  If the weather wasn't so nice and I wasn't in such good company, I probably would have been more annoyed.  Overall, I would highly recommend the Ceasar, which came served in a gigantic milkshake glass and garnished with cauliflower and pickles. I decided to go with the buttermilk pancakes with sauteed bananas, whipped cream, and with your choice of bacon/sausage or ham ($12). I obviously opted for the bacon and you really do get what you pay for. It really is a big portion of three pancakes, which I could not finish on my own. They were good, however, there was not enough sauteed bananas, and without the maple syrup, they would have been really dry. My boyfriend's eggs looked superbly done and aesthetically pleasing. They did offer chorizo sausage if you picked that option which is definitely a bonus.   As this place doesn't serve french toast, I cannot put it on my top brunch spots, but I would  be open to coming again."}
{"text":"I really loved this place. It has a warm diner feel with an upscale variety of food options, at a medium price.   Came in on a Saturday afternoon with a party of 4. Seating was easily found in a cozy booth. They had only the brunch menu to choose from, but all the choices sounded delicious! And tasted just as great!  I ordered from the specials board, which I would recommend, and tried my eggs with their house smoked fish - sounded risky, but definitely paid off. Coffee was solid.  The fact that it's a five minute walk from my place made this restaurant five stars for me!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and both times left satisfied having enjoyed my meal. What a gem of a place! I would describe it as comfort food with a foodie twist. The butter lettuce salad with pulled chicken and hazelnuts was superb. The lemony dressing brought the whole plate together. The Tourtière Turnover - delish. Ground beef with spices and a hint of cinnamon baked inside a delightfully flaky crust. My husband had the Shepherd's pie made with pulled lamb. The presentation was beautiful! Another huge plus besides the food is the comforting atmosphere. You literally feel like you've just stepped into someone's living room. Very cozy. Only negative is that there's something a bit off with the exhaust fans as it can get super hot in the dining area when there's a lot of activity in the kitchen (you can see partially into the kitchen area). Overall, certainly above average food - and I will return again!"}
{"text":"Stumbled across this place with my boyfriend on our way to Castle Loma. Was not the least bit disappointed!! Food was creative and tasty, the staff was friendly and answered all my first time visitor questions and the food came within a few minutes. The decor was very lovely too. We sat out on the patio. Reasonably priced and interesting food, also everything is made in house which is awesome. No complaints:)"}
{"text":"I never got around to writing a review for the first time we went, and now I'm glad I didn't. My wife and I went once a couple months ago; my huevos rangeros was ok but smothered in bland guac so it was all I could taste. Bacon was good. My wife loved her finnish crepes. The server was really charming and nice, but there was a weird moment where the manager seemed to snap at her, grab our plates from her and clunk them down on the table. (cringey moment.) My wife really liked it, so we decided to go back for brunch a while later. BIG mistake. Theres a huge line outside and we wait for a long time, no ones at the door. Finally that same manager comes out and we ask for an approx.  wait time, she snaps something like \"we've got 65 orders in the kitchen right now, everybody's gonna have to wait.\" really unapologetically. Tables go unbussed, we're ignored, finally we sit down. A long time goes by before the server gets to us (a different one) and shes not friendly. When we order, I ask this time if I can get my guac on the side, remembering last time. She snaps \"you get it on the huevos or you don't get it all, cant get anything on the side\" WTF? I opt to not get it. My wife asked for no toast with her omelette, gets toast anyway. Server and manager are rude, really wearing their stress on their sleeve. Food kinda bland, ok but not great. We leave over 2 hours later. Really disappointing. 2 stars because the first time was ok. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"Very cute restaurant!  I have been here for both brunch and dinner and each were delicious!  They cater to local fare, so the prices for some items (like steak) can be fairly high.  But it is all worth it.  The servers are kind and the food is great.  For brunch, you will have to wait.  My friend and I waited about 20 minutes for the two of us on a Saturday before 11am.  Get there early, they don't do reservations.  Brunch -amazing build your own benny (I had mine on sourdough bread, it blew my mind) -potatoes were super yummy -Red Rose tea surprised me...maybe they could get something more unique for their standard black tea?  Dinner -had the steak, it was done perfectly.  It tasted great and the fries were also delish -the s'mores for dessert were AMAZING.  I forgot how good toasted marshmallows can be!  Overall, on both occasions I have left happy and full.  I will definitely be back.  It is such a cute spot!"}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday at 1030am for brunch with my girlfriend. We arrived perfect timing with no line and were seated quickly. The service was polite and timely.   Food  Make your own Benny- It was pretty good but for the price I dont think worth it. Most meat and sauce was made in house and tasted like it too but portions were pretty small. Overall the benny was a 3.  Banana Buttermilk pancakes- These were delicious, perfectly cooked and tasty. Comes with 3 huge pancakes with whipped cream and maple syrup. They were great and I would give them 4.  Colonial Sticky Bun was awesome. Must check it out.   The ambiance of Fanny's was nice and comfy, perfect for a lazy sunday. I would recommend checking it out but wouldn't rush over."}
{"text":"Continuing our mission to explore breakfast places in my neighbourhood (Wychwood/Annex/St. Clair W) we came to check our Fanny Chadwicks on a rainy Sunday afternoon. Waited a short while to get a seat. Once we were seated we were pleasantly surprised by the menu. Great selection of breakfast food. A little on the pricey side. Great drink selection where I chose the official drink of breakfast, the ceasar. They serve it with home made pickled veggies. Yum! Finished the breakfast off with a cinnamon roll. Great way to enjoy a Sunday early afternoon. I recommend this place for a quick breakfast meal."}
{"text":"I've tried so many brunch places in toronto but this is literally the best one yet. How come I didn't spot this place earlier! For their most popular customizable egg benny I ordered smoked salmon + salted mushroom+ spinach on buttered multigrain toast. And the other is sausage + black beans on white toast. Both. So. Heavenly."}
{"text":"I love this pseudo-diner when I visit Toronto.  I hate calling it \"upscale\" comfort food because it sounds douchey.  I'm hesitant to call it \"healthy\" comfort food, because you would then assume it doesn't taste as good, but it does.  I'll just call it higher quality, fresh, better versions of your favorite comfort food classics, like fish and chips that is pan seared with a crispy crust rather than deep fried heavy batter.  Sloppy joes with guacamole, homemade condiments, etc.    It is quiet, casual and perfect when my sister and I are looking to avoid a 'scene' at night."}
{"text":"Amazing place and very friendly service. It's a chilled, relaxed but efficient vibe. The food was delicious and you could taste that things were made from scratch.   We loved the brisket and the poutine. The carne assada was ok, I had better. Portions are huge and you can easily share everything.   For dessert, we had the best chocolate cake! We will come back!"}
{"text":"There's been a lot of buzz about this place, good and bad, and I finally got a chance to try it out for a late Good Friday brunch today.  Take my three star review with a grain of salt, as it's hard for me to get into high end organic diners, which this is.  Pros: Great ambiance; as far as the decor goes its really comfortable and cozy  Great service; our waiter was so friendly, but not overbearing.  A great mix of friendly and distant.  They make everything there - smoke their own bacon, make their own english muffins, even make their own ketchup.  It's a cool idea, and mostly successful  I had the eggs benedict, and it was cooked perfectly,  Eggs were great, and the hollandaise avoided being overly rich.  Hesitations: A bit on the pricey side...but that comes from them making everything there.  Most brunch things were around 12 dollars, which isn't unreasonable considering they make everything there.  It is expensive enough to keep me from going too often.  Cons: The coffee was 2.50! That's crazy talk.    The \"salad\" that came as a side for my meal was just huge pieces of lettuce with a light lemony dressing which may have just been spillage from the hollandaise sauce.  It was more of a lettuce side than a salad side.  I should've opted for the potatoes."}
{"text":"Love Fanny Chadwick's! Great brunch spot on weekends but make sure you go early to avoid the lines!  The food is incredibly tasty.  Everything they serve has so much flavour its amazing!  I normally opt for the standard breakfast with their sausage special, half salad, half potatoes.  So good!   The staff are really friendly and very helpful in the decision making process.  Even with the lines they don't rush you out or pressure you to leave.  Frequently the staff have brought over fresh baked goods for those waiting in line to get in!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and service!  Everything is from scratch and you can tell.  Had the sausage nachos and quesadilla.  Both to die for!  Greatf cocktails as well."}
{"text":"Fanny Chadwick's is a friend's favorite brunch spot, so I was eager to try it out on my most recent visit to Toronto. It's clearly a favorite in the neighbourhood - there was a line up outside the door before they opened!   The place is small, colourful and fits nicely within the neighbourhood. Although they serve lunch and dinner too, I imagine I'd favor breakfast, simply because of the vibe the waitresses give off with their freqeunt offers of coffee refills and central bar stool seating that gives this place a slight diner feel, if only upscale a bit.   The food was heavenly! I had read the online menu before going in, but honestly the website does not excite you the way the actual dining experience will. I had the breakfast brisket with hash and it was amazing. They are big on locally sourced food, and the quality is evident in the food. Portions are sizable; you won't be hungry for a while."}
{"text":"We didn't need to line up for long, but even if we did, the wait is totally worth it. Great food and good service. Great breakfast and brunch spot. Super cozy vibe."}
{"text":"All around stellar breakfast.  We arrived at basically zero hour - aka 12 noon on sunday.  As it was a gorgeous sunday with the sun shinning everyone had the same idea.  It was nice out so we didn't mind the 35 minute wait for a table for 5.  There is a great indian cafe on the north east corner so we got a coffee (I'm sure they would have given us coffee had we asked but it was a nice walk).  They hostess was extremely pleasant and gave CONSTANT updates - which is especially reasuring in hungover / hangry states - as well she brought some banana loaf around.    The breakfast is perfect - hash browns eggs etc all delicious.  coffee was good - service attentive... The only reason it doesn't get a 5 is because I had not just saved my family from a bear attack - I think 5 stars are reserved for out of this world experiences.    of note - the hot sauce is hot and awesome... I also had the beef brisket bacon - which is definitely not bacon so if you like beef brisket get but if you are looking for bacon stick to the standard.   thanks Fanny - we'll see you soon!"}
{"text":"Great food! Even better staff! Memorable dining experience!  Read the full review here  http://tylerbaron8.wixsite.com/beastandfeast"}
{"text":"Yummmmmmmm! This was a great brunch. Went with a group of five and waited about half an hour (we were there around noon). The wait wasn't bad because a lovely lady kept coming outside to give frequent updates, and she even brought us slices of a delicious homemade chocolate chip pumpkin bread to eat while we waited!  I split the farm-fresh eggs breakfast with the hash browns and black beans. The ketchup was delicious, and seemed to be homemade. The only let down was that for some reason I was expecting the sourdough bread to be baguette style, but it was your basic loaf-style.   The seating was comfortable and you can look right into the kitchen, which is always fun. Their lunch and dinner menu also look awesome (triple decker grilled cheese anyone?!) and I will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"This rapidly became one of my favorite brunch joints in Toronto: from the ambiance, to the service to the food, oh the food!  Waiting outside for about 30 minutes, the hostess was very attentive and came out with COFFEE CAKE and COFFEE.  Very good service, she would stay out to chat with everyone, making sure everyone was ok.  The main dish: we all ordered the special, THE RANCHEROS.  2 over easy or poached eggs, over black beans, all topped on sourdough bread.  Side of beef brisket, and potato hash.  This was the best, most satisfying dish after a late night of fun.  It was a bit early but they have a delicious, extremely spicy haberero sauce, mixed in with a little bit of ketchup is heavenly!  The interior was so adorable like a diner.  Very bright and open concept kitchen.  It's off the beaten path but apparently, always packed with people and worth the wait.  Don't go starving, you may just need to wait a bit for this delicious meal."}
{"text":"Love this place, always find the menu to be interesting and fresh, they have great meat on their menu, service is good and its a cute little restaurant, always pushing to go back."}
{"text":"Weren't very accommodating for a party of 5. It took nearly 2 hours to seat us and when we would ask for a time range they said your table is almost ready. Staff was polite but could have handled the situation better, like pushing 2 tables together. Instead of taking multiple parties of 2 over a party of 5; larger bill, more gratuity. I chose this place as my birthday brunch, first and last time here. Supremely disappointed, I specifically came for Eggs Benny and after that wait; they were out of Peameal Bacon."}
{"text":"Local, comfort food with a bit of an Asian influence in this cozy Annex abode.  We started with the Mac & Cheese, which was served in a bowl of elbow macaroni swimming in cheese sauce and garnished with crispy shallots. This wasn't your basic Kraft dinner but it did have the nostalgia of eating it as a kid. The sauce was VERY saucy with a watery consistency. We kind of wished we had bread to dip in the sauce because there was that much sauce!  We were kind of glad we split the starter three-ways and didn't order a second starter as the mashups we ordered were rather large.  I ordered the Smoked Beef Brisket Mashup, which was served on a bed of mashed potatoes topped with a cilantro salad and garnished with fried garlic and shallots. Alternatively, you can order your mashup as a poutine or lettuce wrap. For $17, it is a rather larger portion; big enough to go halfsies or pack up for take-out. The creamy mashed potatoes are not side order portion and is just as much the star of the dish as the brisket. The brisket is cut in chunky pieces and there's a generous portion of the brisket as well. All in all, a delicious and filling meal.  Sadly, we did not have room for dessert but it'll have to wait for a future visit.  Had it not been for You Gotta Eat Here, I would not have ventured in this part of the Annex. We went for a late dinner on Tuesday night so it was rather quiet with a few patrons having dinner and drinks. Unfortunately, they didn't have anything that was featured on the show (Lamb Shepherd's Pie, Tourtiere Turnover, or Polenta). The dishes we ordered, however, were satisfying and it looks like they have a changing menu, which is reason enough to come back. It seems like most reviews here are for their brunch, which I'll have to add to my roster of brunch spots to eventually check out!"}
{"text":"Cool, trendy atmosphere with great food. The trout special and poutine were great. It was a little pricey for lunch, but the quality was worth it."}
{"text":"Food was damn good and the setting and atmosphere pretty cool if you like that loud and lively feel.  Also a quaint feeling..homely eating in someones kitchen.  Close to being a 5/5 but food took really long to arrive.  Otherwise great hip breakfast place, and i will definitely come back for more!"}
{"text":"The beef brisket hash is my favourite thing I've ever had for brunch anywhere. The service was not overtly friendly, but they were OK. I'll definitely be coming back because the food is that good."}
{"text":"what a hidden gem for brunch! came in on a sunday a few people... a bit of wait but was it worth it!! tried the pancakes, french toast and finnish pancakes and all three were winners... but the go to item had to be the finish pancakes!!! 2 giant sized crepes, filled with a sweet and tart berry filling!!! awesome... make sure you come hungry cause the portions are substantial!"}
{"text":"I believe in second chances. I am also an idiot.  Almost a year after my last attempt, we tried Fanny Chadwicks again. Arrived at 10:15am on a Sunday. Small line at the door, we were seated shortly after.  We were seated by a lady I assume to be the owner(?) who told us in a very off-putting tone, \"here is the situation. We expanded our restaurant and added 50 seats - but we didn't expand the kitchen. You arrived at the busiest time, keep in mind there are 75 orders in ahead of you. The kitchen is doing all they can but please expect 30-40 minutes for your food.\" I may be giving her too much credit. I don't think she ever used the word \"please.\"  We heard her repeat the script to two other tables as they were seated.   Fine. I just really wanted to try the eggs benedict here already!  We then proceeded to sit for 20 minutes without any water (in the heat outside) and no one to take our order. We flagged someone down and finally did.  An hour went by. No food. I saw our server walk by and I POLITELY (yes I was actually being polite) said \"I know you're kitchen is a bit backed up but I was wondering if you have any idea as to how much longer it will be?\"  She rudely cut me off before I could finish and goes \"EVERYONE HERE IS IN THE SAME POSITION AS YOU. THOSE PEOPLE *points behind her* ARE GOING ON AN HOUR AND A HALF. AND THAT TABLE HAS BEEN WAITING LONGER.\"  I said \"Ok, I understand that but we were told you were backed up 30-40 minutes... but apparently the entire patio have been waiting for over an hour. I'd just like to know how much longer we're looking at here.\"  Her response \"I dunno. Probably over an hour. Maybe more\"  I don't know what nutty people can sit and wait 2+ hours for their breakfast food, then feel compelled to write a good review about it.  Keep in mind we were a table of TWO... imagine being 4?   I've never in my life experienced such extreme rudeness from a server or management. I honestly maybe would have waited if their attitudes towards the 3 hour brunch was nicer and more sympathetic.  Also - their coffee  machine and debit machine broke while we were there - this did not affect us as we did not order any coffee or stay for our meal. Again.   I can't be the only crazy one.... I can't be the only one who can't commit 3+hours to brunch.... most of that time spend WAITING for the actual food."}
{"text":"I would rate as 3.5.  Went around 3pm, very comfortable seating area and staff was very nice.   I like FC, I got the eggs benny combo, only thing I can fault them is the hash potatoes came out cold and the hollandaise sauce became a little too rich for me after a while although at first bite it was really amazing.   All and all I'll probably be back to try some other stuff."}
{"text":"We're visiting from Detroit and were very disappointed in the food (and the coffee!). By far our worst meal yet. Good service, but we were really looking for a yummy brunch. The potato hash was just a big mushy pile of under-seasoned potatoes and the ketchup was sweet like a tomato jam. Would not recommend!"}
{"text":"Honestly thought this was one of the best brunch places I've been to in the city. Had a really great huevos rancheros (be careful of the jalapenos in the salsa if you're not into that!). Eggs were cooked perfectly and all of the ingredients were amazing. The only thing not so good were the homefries, they were ok but just not as good compared to the rest of the food. The side of fruit was nice too. We had to wait a while but it was prime brunching time, and the host came out to give us pumpkin bread! Amazing! All around great experience."}
{"text":"The atmosphere here is quaint. Indoor and outdoor seating is a plus. It's a diner, really, but much cleaner than you would expect. We had a late breakfast here.  The signage said that everything was freshly prepared in-house, and we are quite able to put that to the test, as I am sensitive to preservatives in food and my wife is a very good cook.  The menu was small, but one thing caught both our eyes - the hash of the day. Today's happened to be with house-made chorizo.   My wife, whose palette can be difficult to please, was impressed by the chorizo and the flavorful potatoes. The eggs added a little bit of creamy texture to the meal. It was portioned correctly - not too much. It certainly enough to fill you up, and every single bite was packed with flavor.  The fried onions lent a smokey flavor to the meal, and the chorizo was chart-topping. I hope the quality is consistent so that you can enjoy it as much as we did. As we dined, we saw the sandwiches coming out of the kitchen and they looked to be fantastic as well.  This daily hash may have been the best meal we've enjoyed on our trip. Worth the subway ride to reach, and around the corner from Casa Loma for touristy fun."}
{"text":"Love this place - they are usually busy - especially in Winters as their Patio won't work - but awesome food and a good place for weekend brunch!"}
{"text":"Great food. I got the eggs benny with brisket and it was delicious. The service was quite quick and good. The place was quite busy but if you manage to get a seat in the morning. Then it is worth it."}
{"text":"The burger was absolutely amazing. So many flavours, perfectly greasy and squeezed inside a tasty bun. And the fries! Thin, salty and crispy.   The fried chicken was also fantastic. It had a unique flavour, maybe turmeric or curry of some kind. Not too strong, but just enough to make the fried chicken totally unique.   Also had a side salad with a very tangy and delicious dressing. Wooh!  Looks like they have a very nice patio as well.   We showed up at 5:45pm on a Saturday, not realizing they only do drinks until 6pm. Enjoyed a beer though from their decent size selection. The restaurant was pretty empty when we showed up but when we left an hour later more people started showing up.    Can't wait to go back again and try more."}
{"text":"We were a party of four that arrived for an 11 am brunch (they don't take reservations). This appears to be a popular place and we expected to have to wait. While it would have been nice if the hostess could have given us a sense of timing for our table, we appreciated the fact that she offered us coffee/water while we waited.  It was frustrating to look inside the restaurant and see tables waiting to be clearedbut after 60 minutes when we were finally seated we were willing to put the delay behind us.  I note that one of the members of our group was 8 months pregnant -- the manager had no problem with having us wait outside.  It became incredibly frustrating when after having been seated for 10 minutes we still hadn't had a chance to order even a drink. I made a concerted effort to make eye contact with first our server and then the manager, the latter of whom clearly saw that we were looking for something but as far as I could tell deliberately ignored my look of desperation/frustration. Finally after 15-20 minutes our server came over to take our order. Having waited outside for 60 minutes it seemed excessive that it took another 20 to even place an order.  We ordered at the same time as the table adjacent to us. For some reason, their food came out 10 minutes later while we continued to starve. Our server was nowhere on sight after another 20-25 minutes we got the attention of the manager and explained our plight -- 60 minutes outside, no service for 20 minutes at the table, and then no food 25 minutes or so after ordering, despite the fact that our neighbours had by then finished their meal. Rather than be apologetic or any way concerned, she explained that the restaurant was busy and they were doing what they could. While we understood the busy part, what we didn't understand was the discrepancy in treatment between us and our neighbours and the delays that occurred before our food was even ordered. The manager then returned 3 minutes later and explained that we put our order in at 1225 and that it was only 1250, essentially explaining that our complaints were unwarranted.  This was a highly inappropriate way to respond. We are paying to eat in her restaurant and by this point are clearly upset. At the very least she should have tried to be part of the solution but instead spent her efforts trying to argue with us and proving that the delay was not excessive. Even if 25 minutes is a reasonable amount of time to wait for for food, it is not reasonable after having waited outside for 60 minutes and then having to wait another 20 minutes to even order.  Bottom line is, Regardless of the quality of the food, not only did we have to wait an excessive amount of time, but the manager was completely rude, nasty and unaccommodating and for this reason I will never eat here again."}
{"text":"Everyone there are so nice with you, and the food it's amazing! There is no complain! And sometimes there are a lot of promotion or menu of the day that you can get a different flavour food for less."}
{"text":"Fanny's, like every other brunch place in Toronto (why haven't I opened my own yet?), is exceptionally busy. But I was surprised at how fast the line moved, and we got in relatively quickly.  You have a decent choice (or would, if it were empty) between typical restaurant-style seating, and a more \"experiential\" seat at the bar, which gives you a fun view of all the goings-on in the kitchen area.  Regardless of where you sit, the place is full of that energy that really sets brunch apart from any of the other meals.  The food, while quite pricey, was great.  It takes something pretty special to steer me away from any kind of Eggs Benedict, but the Smoked Beef Brisket Hash did it in an instant.  Just a big 'ole pile of brisket, hash, and some eggs...and keep in mind, a \"big 'ole pile\", in brunch terms, is the pinnacle of perfection. I loved every bite.  Nobody does brunch every day, which I'm sure makes it easier for us to rationalize paying that much. And if you're going to spend a lot anyway, Fanny's is probably a decent place to do it."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.  I'd say the food was good, but I wish you would get a little bit more variety for what your paying for.  I ordered the eggs benny with house peameal bacon and sourdough bread. It came with a massive side of potatoes.  This is where I wish they would have cut the serving of the potatoes in half and add a simple mixed green with oil & vinegar.  My husband ordered the eggs benny with fish but they were sold out. :( He opted for the sausage and added mushrooms and again it came with a huge side of potatoes.  He also ordered the house ceasar and really enjoyed it.  We ended up eating all the benny but left  lot of the potatoes behind.  I would possibly go back if in the area and hungry for brunch, but I don't think I'd go out of my way to go back.  I find the prices a bit steep.  Not sure how popular their lunch and dinner menu is but I'd have to see more pics and reviews to consider."}
{"text":"First, it was my greatest regret that i never tried this place before even though i live just 1 minute away. I've been living near Chadwick's for almost 4 years now, always pass by it whenever i go to the subway or loblaws. I always see the line up especially for sunday brunch, i keep telling my self that i will try it one day and finally that day is today. I was about to try their brunch, but unfortunately something came up and me and my friend decided to do dinner instead. I got the 3pc fried chicken and a side of fries. And... it's so delicious!! the best fried chicken yet! Plus they also gave me an extra drumstick. I love the fries too! And their habanero hot sauce that kicked you in the butt.. I will definetly come back to try their brunch, especially it's just a step away from my place. Overall, i left the place; happy, full and satisfied.. that's all that matters."}
{"text":"This restaurant was highly recommended by friends, so I bundled up and tried it out. I had been told to try the burger and to splurge on the bacon - $2 gives you a nice quantity of thick cut, perfectly cooked bacon to add to the already delicious burger.  I love the vibe of this place - it's cool, without being too cool, and the patrons seem to be from the neighbourhood. It's the kind of place where you can bring your mom, know the meal will turn out well, and still peruse a great selection of craft beer. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Let me begin this review by stating the number of times I have been here for brunch: five. Fanny Chadwick's has bad service and consistently long waits (not just to get in, but for your food). I don't mind waiting for a good thing, but unlike other hipster brunch spots in the city, this one doesn't deliver, at least not consistently. The food is above average at best, and dirty at worst (keep reading...).  Today, at the beginning of brunch, my wife found a really long hair in her smoked fish. How delicious. And my eggs were grossly overlooked. When we talked to our waitress after barely touching our food, her first reaction was \"okay we'll just charge you for one of the breakfasts\". I replied \"which one? the one with the hair in it or the one with the inedible eggs? You think we want to eat this? We've lost our appetite, we'd like to leave\". And we did.   A giant meh for FFC."}
{"text":"The best brunch I've ever had. Don't walk, run to Fanny Chadwick's for brunch right now!  I waited for about 15-20 minutes for a table for 2 on a Saturday around 2:30pm. It was quite busy, and for good reason I'd later find out, but things were moving and the staff was really engaging, always keeping us updated. To boot, while I was waiting they even brought me a slice of delicious chocolate-chip, pumpkin bread! Incredible service!  In any case the coup de grace was my Stuffed Finnish Pancakes. HOLY SH**!! I will be back for these, possibly tomorrow! I don't want to write anything about them because words just can't do them justice. My girlfriend had the eggs benny and said they were amazing, but for me, it's all about the Finnish cakes. Damn, I wish I had some now."}
{"text":"Wow!  Visiting from Chicago, our innkeeper recommended Fanny Chadwick's...what a great neighborhood find!  Fanny's has both indoor and outdoor seating...we chose to sit at the bar.  The food is incredibly fresh and we watched each dish being crafted at the barside kitchen.  We had vegetable patties and amazing corn on the cob, as appetizers, beef brisket tostadas and trout were our entrees.  Each dish was unusually prepared and seasoned...the corn, in particular, was just outstanding!  We had s'mores for dessert and the graham crackers and marshmellows were home-made.  We really can't emphasize sufficiently how fresh and well-prepared each dish was -- truly this Fanny's is a don't miss dining experience!"}
{"text":"I haven't written a review since having Yelp for a year. Fanny deserves all five stars! Everything home made, even the jam! The jucies, the eggs, the coffee, and even the staff are all spectacular! The brisket is a must, as a side or in one of the menu items! Will be back. Thanks for the great brunch this morning! OH! And if you can make it to the cute patio in the back, do it!"}
{"text":"Despite the humorless server, this place will get a return visit.  11 craft beers on tap.  They have an interesting Asian inspired entree menu in addition to \"mash-ups\" which are savory dishes (brisket and lamb) that can be served over mashed potatoes or as a poutine.  The atmosphere is hipster lunch counter meets Korean bbq joint.  With great local taps."}
{"text":"Came on a Sunday for brunch after a long international flight. They were quick to seat us and drop off our beverages.   Food was \"homemade\" and sticky bun was fresh. Worth the carbs...  We also shared to an omelet - it was decent.   Food was a little pricey but drinks were cheap.  Service was quick. Not super friendly but it did the trick..."}
{"text":"Great food and service in a relaxed atmosphere.  I have twice dined at Fanny Chadwick's for dinner and was both times impressed .   The food is really fresh and well seasoned. I enjoyed the stuffed pepper I ordered with quinoa salad. It was light, and exactly something I would have made at home (in a good way).   It was my dad's birthday and our group of eight all really enjoyed our meal. I brought a cake that I baked and they let us serve it, which was really quite generous.  The service was quite polished for such a casual restaurant. I appreciated our server's descriptions of the specials and general attentiveness.    If you're feeling like some good home cooking, dining at Fanny's is highly recommended!"}
{"text":"In one word, delicious. A small and cozy spot, we went for Sat brunch and opted for the bar seating to avoid a short wait. I had the custom eggs benedict with brisket. The eggs benny were delicious, but next time might choose salmon. Their potatoes were smashed and pan fried, also delicious. A substantial amount of food which I didn't finish. My friend ordered the scrambled eggs which were also delicious. A solid choice for brunch."}
{"text":"Had brunch with a friend this morning and we decided to try Fanny's as neither of us had been before.  For fear of a line-up, I arrived about 10 minutes prior to opening time. There were only two other people waiting for the doors to open and there seemed to be plenty of seating available until some time after 11 AM when a small queue formed (3-4 people).  The interior of the restaurant is nice and bright with a very inviting feel. I sat facing the counter/bar area where a tray of the most delicious-looking sticky buns were perched (now kicking self for not getting one to go).  I'm typically an eggs for brunch person, but I decided to step out of my comfort zone this time and ordered the Finnish pancakes with fruit compote ($11.99) and a side of the house-made sausage (+$1). Today's sausage was Argentinian style beef and pork, not too spicy but nice and savoury. The pancakes were awesome. HUGE portion of slightly custardy, delicious crepe-like pancakes with blueberry compote and a dollop of whipped cream on the side. Served with a tiny pitcher of real maple syrup. I wanted to finish everything on my plate but alas there was just too much. :)  My friend ordered the Build Your Own Benny ($9.50), with the sausage as well (+$3.50), and seemed to really enjoy it. Eggs looked perfectly poached, nice consistency to the Hollandaise and a huge serving of salad came alongside.  Service was enthusiastic to the point of feeling a tad rushed a couple of times, but otherwise very friendly and timely with water/coffee refills.  I definitely will be back to try more (smoked brisket? Yes please!) and to snag one of those sticky buns I foolishly failed to order to take away."}
{"text":"We love the beef brisket!! The nachos?.. it's heaven!! Shareable up to 4 people!!! Friendly and accommodating staff. Small place but very nice ambience.."}
{"text":"Love this place! Recently went with the family for brunch and had a great meal. The build your own benny was a popular choice in our party, but I went for the rancheros, which were awesome! Everything was fresh and housemade. Bit of a wait for a table, but that's to be expected anywhere in Toronto for a weekend brunch. The staff was great, and the hostess was really accommodating and offered coffee and pieces of banana bread while we waited. Little things like that really make a difference, and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The in house sausage was amazing and the potatoes here are so yummy. Only thing I don't recommend is the brisket as a side..it was just chunky dry meat. Its still one of the best brunch/eggs Benny places I've been to!"}
{"text":"Fanny Chadwick's is a solid place for lunch ( or maybe dinner) on the Dupont Strip. Here are a few things to note...  1. The place is \"proper\" without being stuffy. It is a great spot, particularly for groups of two or four. 2. The food is great. The Reuben is sensational, as is the burger. The onion rings are cooked perfectly... Not over seasoned or greasy. 3. Service is very good. 4. Prices here are a bit high for an everyday lunch place, but not unreasonably so. If you order a main plate and a beer, expect to pay 25-30$ with tax and tip. 5. This is a great place for comfort and brunch foods prepared amazingly well. Go here for meeting friends or for that place that will surely please everyone.  Four and a half stars."}
{"text":"Just checking in again to say that Fanny's continues to be fantastic. Once again (really, why mess with perfection) had the Beef Brisket Hash and the Finnish pancake. The hash is to die for. Pancake is good. The service remains excellent. Decor, ambiance, music, colours, font style are all super. LOVE!"}
{"text":"This is a really cute place for breakfast/brunch! I came here with a friend on a Sunday afternoon (~1pm) and there was a bit of a wait (expected). I was pleased though, that I was immediately greeted by the hostess when I wandered in. Far too many breakfast/brunch places get too hectic on the weekends and service suffers, but not this place! The restaurant's ambience is cozy. The interior has a diner feel.  There is also decor that showcases the history of the building and neighborhood, which really added character. The menu has some Latin influence. For brunch, the menu had a few suggestions, which I personally prefer over an overwhelming breakfast/brunch menu with a bajillion options. I had the drowned omelette ($11) while my friend had the rancheros ($11.50).  The portions were quite healthy for the price, and quality was A+. Our food also arrived frighteningly fast.  Throughout our meal our server promptly filled our cups with coffee/water and she regularly checked up on us without making us feel rushed. I really appreciated this, especially on a busy weekend afternoon. I do not live or visit the area often, but Chadwick's is definitely a place I would recommend."}
{"text":"In between a 3-4 stars for me. It's a good place to stop for brunch if you're in the area. I've only been here for brunch on weekends and it's always busy and the food is fresh.  There aren't an overwhelming number of food options which I like, but they have a build your own benny for more options (price can add up quick though). I had the drowned omelette my last time here, which was good and had a lot of strong flavours. They'll also give you hot sauce on the side, which really kicks it up a notch. Prices are a bit high, but comparable to everything else in the area. Coffee was good and food was good, so would definitely come back when I'm feeling lazy and want brunch!"}
{"text":"Yum!!! I had the cochinita sandwich - delicious! Fries are nice too, as is the salad."}
{"text":"Nice little bar/restaurant with friendly service. They always have one or two beer specials on tap, so check back often to see what's changed. Friendly staff...you'll want to come back here."}
{"text":"This review is for their new restaurant, Chadwick's. Came for a late dinner and had the Mac and cheese ($8). It had cotija and onions and was really great. Definitely good value for the price. They're currently doing a promotion where their pints are $5 for the first two weeks of their rebranding. My friend got the burger and it looked amazing.   Service was really good - I could tell that the staff genuinely wanted feedback on their new menu and were very helpful in making suggestions. I also really like the changes they've made to the decor and think this would be a good place for a date (low lighting, good music, not too loud)."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  I was back in town recently.. and there was a line up by 10am- when they open.  Very tasty, fresh and lovely food.  It is also in a fantastic neighbourhood.  If you haven't been.. run, don't walk!  Also, get there early."}
{"text":"Very tasty food! One of my favorite restaurant in Toronto. Can be busy for brunch on the weekends but totally worth the line up!"}
{"text":"This is my first yelp review. My friend and I went for a birthday dinner. The patio makes the surrounding buildings disappear and felt like a getaway even though I live one street over. Our server, Janet was confident, made us feel so at home and easily made seating changes as the weather got cooler. The food is delicious and creatively presented. This really is casual dining done the right way. I think you should go."}
{"text":"The restaurant is pretty small and very popular, so I recommend going early. We had to wait for a seat (I think we were there around 11:30-12 on a Sunday), but it wasn't too bad, I expected a longer wait. The seating is a bit squished, so be prepared to get comfortable with your neighbours. The service was courteous and friendly and the vibe is casual/hipster.   I tend to prefer more space while I eat, but as soon as my food came, I stopped caring because it was 100% worth it. I got the eggs benedict with brisket and potatoes. It was amazing! Every single bite was packed with rich, delicious flavour. It was the perfect amount of brisket to bread/egg ratio and my egg was delightfully runny. I don't know what they put on their potatoes but it was like crack.  Definitely ask for hot sauce on the side, but only if you REALLY like spice. The server said \"be careful, it's super hot\" and I was thinking \"hah, sure ooookay,\" but it actually was really spicy, so be aware and don't scoff like I did!"}
{"text":"Great little restaurant that boasts locally sourced ingredients. I went here for my birthday on a Saturday after searching for a restaurant that served locally sourced meat but I was delightfully surprised when I found out everything is pretty much local: veggies, meat AND wait for it, beer/ciders. They have a good selection of local beers and ciders. Make sure you ask for any of their sauces and/or ketchups (which are all made in house). All their plates are shareable (or not if you're not into that) but it gives the option to try an assortment of food which is great for bigger groups. I went with a group of 6 and we got the fried chicken (drool), carne asada (yum), fish frito (super light and not so greasy) and veggie tortas (think Spanish style falafel). The craft dinner, and collard greens+mushrooms are a must for sides. Topping wise, I'd pick their pico, chimichurri and salsa verde over their guac. 3am sauce is a topping that kinda tastes like Big Mac sauce, it's meh.   The staff was really accommodating and super friendly. They took the time to explain what was what and how things worked. We went around 7:30, it wasn't too packed. However, it's a small joint so making reservations are your best bet.   Definitely going back just for the food and the service alone, but the fact that they have weekly specials is a big plus in my books."}
{"text":"Food was solid but pricey. Atmosphere was cozy and service was a little slow because it was busy but generally competent and amiable."}
{"text":"This restaurant is top notch. We had the fried cheese and the mac and cheese to start and our mains (brisket and fried chicken) were simply perfect. The presentation, the atmosphere, and the service were all great and they more than justify the price."}
{"text":"Food was amazing and left me stuffed. Great service, especially since it was during a high traffic time. Very busy hidden gem in the Annex.  In-house sausages are delicious and very creative. As always with smaller places,  I'd recommend going in a small group."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was great and food selection appears to be well rounded. We had beef brisket nachos. No beef to be found. This was supremely disappointing.  Black bean nacho would be a better name. Beans and guacamole very delicious as well as the home made chips. Just sucks when you expect meat. We also had ceaser salad. Not sure if the menu mentioned the jalapeño but the salad was too spicy hot for my wife to finish.  Also suspect they are using an alternate to anchovies so the taste was quite fishy."}
{"text":"Really lovely place. Service is mediocre (for the ladies there a few cute waiters serving as some eye candy).  I recommend going for lunch and not dinner. way overpriced for dinner and not worth while. Nonetheless, when it comes to brunch, The food is pretty well done. Good eggs, good home fries, amazing sausage, coffee is meh meh though they do refills which is always a plus. My favourite part is really just the feel of the place. really fresh and nice, clean and well designed and a good amount of room. Its worth the Sunday morning wait. Parking ent so bad either :)"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch yesterday. The service is really good. Our waitress waved to us through the glass, as we walked through the front door. Since we came shortly after they opened, the place was quiet (to start!), and it was a weekday as opposed to their craZy busy weekends that I've bore witness to, as I bike by and see a line-up out the front door.  It was our first time there and we had a lot of questions. Our waitress was patient with us, which was wonderful and something that may not be awarded during the weekend brunch hours, so the time we went was perfect!  I ordered the omelette on the Specials list for the day. It was a three-free-range-egg omelette that came stuffed with fried cauliflower and ricotta cheese and with guacamole and salsa verde on top, two toasted pieces of bread (cut in half) and a side salad with honey dijon dressing (this, I ordered instead of the French fries), which was a solidly good choice, since their french fried tend to be quite done, almost, if not, to the point of over done. I also got the smoked trout. AMAZING! Smoked fish is honestly one of my downfalls, so damn good!     The ambiance and the way Fanny's is set up definitely gives off a homestyle feel. My sister said it is a mix of modern diner with vintage and I would agree with her. It's extremely clean and very inviting. Their signature colours are orange and a light brown and they've designed it in such a way reflecting that, with those colours blended throughout the space. It's very well designed!  There were other things that could have improved the experience:  My omelette for example, originally came with bacon inside and a beef brisket. I supplanted the beef brisket with the smoked trout, but the bacon, which I specifically told my server that I do not eat RED meat, it came with the first omelette I received. Thankfully, my sister was interested in trying some and I saw the bacon when I cut the omelette open. I'm not really a hard core vegetarian. In fact, I am more of a flexitarian, however RED meat is something I feel rather strongly about, in that I do not wish to have it near the food I am eating (preferably). I told my server. She was mortified and I understood that people are people and they make mistakes. Especially since I've been in the hospitality industry myself to know what it is like. It was also her first lunch shift.   And while others, who are more particular with their food intake (ie. strict vegans and strict vegetarians) may have blown up and been super upset because it's BACON! I maintained my composure. Our waitress was incredible about it and allowed us to take that one home. In addition to the new omelette, sans bacon that was prepared for me, on the fly.  Restaurants tend to get loud, very loud when there are a number of people filling up the empty spaces and having their own conversations with one another. Some are a lot louder than they need to be, especially when talking to people RIGHT BESIDE THEM- it's their own prerogative. Unfortunately we experienced this with those sitting behind us. It was somewhat unpleasant and uncomfortable, considering I turned around and told them but it was also something beyond our control. People wanna be that way, there is not much anyone can do, except those specific people. People wanna be inconsiderate, rude and disrespectful... by all means!   Apart from that my experience was over-all good. I'd like to try their finnish pancakes and perhaps other items, but I might get take-out next time."}
{"text":"I've been to Fanny Chadwick's a number of times living in the neighbourhood. I've had great experiences and I've had lack lustre experiences. Their brunch is pretty classic and usually up to snuff and we had a Thai poutine once that was incredible. But, on one occasion I ordered mussels, which were gritty and flavourless. Another time my friend had ordered brisket, that came very dry and pretty tasteless. Staff are very friendly and try to remedy the situation, but the consistency just isn't there. That being said, it is not off my list of local restaurants to eat at yet."}
{"text":"Came here on the weekend with two pals for brunch. Had only ever been here for lunch, so I was pretty stoked to try it for brunch. Well, we were so happy we got here right at 10 am, because oooh boy - did this place fill up fast!   It was Easter Sunday and the staff has taken to hiding Easter eggs around the restaurant. When we went to hang our jackets, we found one on the coat rack. It was the most adorable thing ever.   Now let's chat about the food! We ordered a sticky bun to share at the table. It was totally scrumptious, fluffy and you guessed it - sticky. The menu had some really great options for vegetarians, which was perfect for my partner. I ended up ordering the Brisket Hash ($15.50, 2 farm fresh eggs, brisket, potato hash, fried leek & onion, and pico) which was so well done. The eggs which I asked to be prepared over easy, were sent out overdone. It wasn't the worst thing in the world, but I was really looking forward to mixing in my yolk with the hash.   My partner got the Drowned Omelette ($12, 3 farm fresh eggs, queso Oaxaca, salsa roja, salsa verde and cotija cheese with potato hash) and the flavors were out of this world. It was not quite a Rancheros but still gave you all the same flavor and feeling.   Service was attentive and kind. Coffee (Reunion Island) was heckin' tasty. They also have Sloane Tea on the menu, if that's your thing. 10/10, would totally come back here or recommend."}
{"text":"Another Yelp win. During a vacation to Toronto, was on the hunt for a great place to eat. The reviews of Chadwick's looked promising, so after a few delightful hours spent at Casa Loma, we headed over a few blocks to Chadwick's.  First, the outside is not pretentious. Red siding, the restaurant sits cozily on a neighborhood corner. The interior is just as unassuming - cute red stools at the bar and open shelving in front of the galley house the most darling teapots, creamers, and other breakfasty utensils.  Second, they have a wicked selection of beers. (Unfortunately, I don't really like beer, but hubby ordered a pale ale that he enjoyed).  Third, the menu is very eclectic. Chadwick's describes itself as \"Canadian\" but the food has a distinctive Latin American leaning with a twist.   Last, this is NOT an inexpensive establishment given the portion sizes. Having said that, the food is fresh, made from scratch, and very tasty.  We'd go again."}
{"text":"Great combination of nice atmosphere, solid brunch options, and friendly staff. Just make sure to time your brunch arrival or you may wait for a while. Drowned Omelette is recommended. And of course finish it off with a sticky bun. Sufficient options for vegetarians as well."}
{"text":"A great little compact spot. Is it a pub, is it a restaurant? It doesn't really matter because the food is excellent (and locally sourced) and the beers on tap are great. It's a much better option that some of the pubs in the area. A little hipster, but hey, it's the north end of the Annex."}
{"text":"Review for their brunch only  Service: Been there twice, has always been great and friendly, no complain  Food: - Ordered their Rancheros the first time I was there because they were out of the Venezuelan Breakfast. LOVED the Rancheros! everything's well seasoned, loved the home fries, but the black beans have a tint of sweetness in there (not complaining, I love it).  - Ordered their Venezuelan Breakfast the second time I went back because I had to try it, the combination looked very interesting and different (baked plantain, black beans, popcorn). TBH, I didnt really like the popcorn, it was missing that CRUNCH, texture was a bit on the stale/soggy side... but everything else was good :) HOWEVER... not sure if I liked the whole combination in this dish...I mean everything tasted good on its own, but I didn't think everything went well together, maybe someone else loves it?  Overall: Great food and great service in general, definitely a good brunch spot!"}
{"text":"Perrrrrfect timing. Walked in here around 1pm and the place, albeit small, had 9 seats open up for my large group. All of my group's dishes were ~$12 - 18/person + drinks and gratuity. Teas and drinks were decently priced, I think my entire table got something.  I got the Brisket Hash and all I remember is having a lot of potatoes on my plate ($16). This was a splurge considering how much money we spent on this mini vacation, but wasn't really worth it to me. I think another friend got a $12 plate and that seemed more worth it.  Drinks had to be ordered first because of whatever process the restaurant has set up. This made ordering insanely slow and a bit awkward. Also, the restaurant runs out of dishes halfway through the day, so I would recommend coming here early if you're craving something. The sticky buns ran out by the time we got there."}
{"text":"Love it here!!!! Big line ups which are annoying but  the food is amazing!  Huevos rancheros is my fave in the city"}
{"text":"This place is a happy find for me! Great food and cosy friendly space. Small patio on DuPont side. The menu is a fusion of Canadian and Thai with some awesome flavours. Beer selection is impressive...no corporate swill here. Wine list is well considered and there's something for every taste. Prices are very reasonable for the area. I really liked Fannys and I plan to return!"}
{"text":"Food was only slightly better than a run-of-the-mill resto in Toronto, but it was priced too high for the quality of food we were served. Their menu is a mish-mash of everything that's basic and overdone Toronto: Mexican and Korean flavours with a taste of Canadiana--groundbreaking.  Had a Huevo Rancheros where everything on the plate tasted just as expected--the only surprise was the salad which took up half the plate. Boyfriend had a brisket hash--50% salad, 25% brisket hash and 25% salt.   Good place for a 'cool' vibe if 'cool' to you means hanging antique lightbulbs over iron piping and chalkboard drawings with the word 'hand crafted'."}
{"text":"I have been here twice here for brunch and it is completely worth the line up.   The summer patio is lovely but eating inside is just as nice."}
{"text":"Food and atmosphere were both equally good. Loved the hash and the fries were delicious too. Creative menu and tasty. Couldn't give 5 stars because the gluten free options were limited to 2 items, even though many kore were listed on their website. They were also out of dressing and gravy which was a bummer."}
{"text":"Great brunch and great fried chicken. Can be really busy so be prepared for a wait depending on when you go."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times, and it's nothing special. But it's quite pricey for what you get. I went today and we ordered a sticky bun. They brought it upside down. Can you guess why? That's right - it was burned on the top and they thought by bringing it upside down, we wouldn't notice. Seriously - if it's burnt, don't serve it. Especially if you're charging $4.50 for it. Do you think we're idiots? Everything else was the usual humdrum stuff, served with a mildly annoying side of attitude. I suppose this place is successful mostly because of the location. We won't be back."}
{"text":"I had my best meal yet at Fanny's yesterday for lunch.  I had the Fanny's Club ($12) and upgraded my fries to a poutine (+$2).  Usually club sandwiches are bland to me, but this one was very tasty and consisted of 4 double layered sandwiches of bacon and chicken.  The poutine's cheese consistency was different than your ordinary cheese curds.  It was melted and not chunky, and was delicious."}
{"text":"We are relatively new to the neighbourhood and my wife and I finally decided to try our nearest restaurant. So glad we did! This is for a DINNER review.   The good: - Flight of your choice of 4 bears $8. Not bad as far as Toronto goes.  - The fried chicken - damn that was some good fried chicken! - Their homemade ketchup - The collard greens and mushrooms - The mac&cheese was decent but didn't blow us away. Kinda bland. - The attentive service. The restaurant was pretty empty so this was the type of service I would expect. Glass was rarely ever empty. Nice guy too.  The not so good: - The pan seared trout - bland as anything. Better with one of their sauces but definitely wouldn't get it again. - Their specials menu says \"no modifications\" - I hate when restaurants are snobby like that. I understand if it is a busy night and you don't have time to make a fresh batch of pico without cilantro, but there is no reason to ever  of allow simple modifications, and especially to make it clear that you don't even want to entertain the idea! - Along the same lines - I got the fried chicken and requested if I could get all (or most) white meat. It wasn't that he didn't want to give it to me, but the waiter was very insistent that the chicken was pre-portioned and there NO WAY to do anything... Not even try, or ask the cook (again, it was not busy so I don't think this was unreasonable). When the waiter wouldn't budge, I got up and asked the cook myself. He explained that the pieces are pre-battered and he couldn't for sure tell if it was a breast or a thigh, but he would DO HIS BEST. That's all I was asking for! The waiter, despite being a nice enough guy, really could have handled this much better. In the end I got 3/4 breast pieces and it was amazing! - This isn't really a negative (especially since it is partially my fault), but they should really warn customers how hot their homemade hot sauce really is! Thinking it wouldn't be hotter than something like Frank's or Tabasco, I dipped my chicken like it was ketchup and my mouth was on fire for at least 5 minutes!  Conclusion: Will definitely be back! Probably going to try the brunch next time.  $80+tip for a main, side and drink each and we were stuffed! Don't love the a la carte thing but the prices aren't bad and gives you a chance to try different sides."}
{"text":"I love love love this place!  It's my brunch favorite.  I almost always get the brisket hash (and the server we seem to always get is the loveliest lady ever and always remembers my weird 'special' request).  The brisket is so smokey and succulent, and the hash is perfectly done every time.  I'm not an egg person, but my BF's poached eggs are always absolutely perfect (not an easy task).  Everything seems to be made from scratch with excellent ingredients - which explains (and I think, justifies) the price, which isn't cheap, but portions are generous and I usually have delicious leftovers.  The 'House Caesar' come with house pickled veg - super delicious!    I've tried a few things off the brunch menu, and I've never been disappointed.    There's a good reason people line up for the brunch!"}
{"text":"Fantastic brunch option right here. The place was packed the weekend morning I came in. But since I was dining alone I had no problems getting a seat as I just shimmied up to the bar. The dining alone thing has really opened my eyes to a new way of experiencing restaurants. Because you're at the bar, the staff chit-chat with you more, you're better taken care of, and you get to see some of the inner workings that you wouldn't notice sitting at a table.  I sent with the hash at the suggestion of the staff. It was great. A nice sized portion that didn't leave me feeling bloated or regretful after I left.  I will definitely be back here again."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Brunch is great, and dinner is great too. Comfort food with decent beer selection and relaxed vibe"}
{"text":"Cool spot. Haven't had a chance to try the food, but the space is very nice and the service was great."}
{"text":"Large portions and tasty food so you know there's going to be a lineup especially on a Sunday.  There was four of us and we each had a different brunch meal and very much enjoyed it. The layout of the restaurant doesn't have all the tables next to each other so it seemed less noisy than many restaurants. Our waitress was great also."}
{"text":"We went for dinner one evening, a group of 5 women friends, intent on a long catch-up conversation over a bottle of wine and good eats.  We were brought the bottle of wine at once, but nothing else until our mains arrived.  Bread might have been lovely. When I ordered my fish, I was told I had a choice of fries, mashed potatoes, cole salw or green salad. Chose the slaw. But when my meal arrived, there was coleslaw alongside the fish, then another separate bowl with a larger portion of coleslaw.  I asked why.  Waitress told me the fish came with coleslaw.  Really!  So I asked why she didn't mention that. \"It was on the menu,\" she snapped. Perhaps, but why then offer it as a choice of side? I asked if it were possible to get something else? \"Yes, but you'll be charged extra.\" But I haven't even touched the bowl! \"We'll have to throw it away now.\" I passed on the additional side and charge.  Sometime later a man came over to the table, possibly the owner, to ask how everything was.  I told him about the double order of coleslaw and he nodded his head-- yup, he seemed to imply-- if you're not going to read the menu, what can you expect?  Is there any need for such unfriendliness to a new customer?  All for a side of mashed potatoes that may have cost them pennies? We don't live far, and might have made Fanny's a regular place to come for an evening bite or brunch.  But there are far too many nice pubs and diners and brunch places in this city to frequent the ones that are rude to their clientele. Sorry Fanny, you blew it."}
{"text":"Get there. Get on the waiting list and enjoy a spectacular brunch!  Always fresh and nothing but awesome testaments of deelish!!! 2 yums up"}
{"text":"Delicious brunch in the Annex.   I can't count the number of times I've passed by Fanny Chadwick's and the huge line of hungry patrons waiting outside. To be honest, I'm not big on brunch but we decided to check it out anyway early after opening at 10am. Even at this hour, the restaurant was near capacity except for the outdoor patio area where we had the area to ourselves for a hot 10 mins.   My gf's eggs benedict was probably the best I've had. Their hollandaise is made with beer (awesome!). You can add a variety of toppings including wilted greens (recommended), american bacon, peameal bacon, and so much more. You can even choose the type of bread too! Highly recommend with hash browns. Many places seem to screw up hash browns. These were soft warm, well spiced, and had pieces of crunchy goodness (gotta have the crunchies).   My order of finnish pancakes came out with an impressive presentation but was somewhat lacking in flavor. I could have used a side of maple syrup to go with it. Enjoyable as the meal was, the real highlight was the benny.   BTW: the homemade \"hot sauce\" is more of a hellish relish made with habanero. Seriously...proceed with caution."}
{"text":"A very good, proverbial busy spot for brunch that we finally saw a short enough line to try.  I had the Brisket Hash and it was fantastic.  Two eggs (fried or scrambled), potato hash, fried leek &onion and pico - is was very well executed.    The space itself is cozy with and odd layout that creates a lot of privacy.  It is filled with vintage signs and blackboard art that make the space fun.  A great spot for brunch if you can brave the wait."}
{"text":"Best brunch I have had in Toronto in a very long time!  The eggs benny was incredible - a rich hollandaise on what tasted like a homemade english muffin and the potato hash were delicious.  The staff were very friendly and the food was outstanding.  I cannot wait to go back."}
{"text":"I tried Fanny Chadwick's a few months ago this past summer.  My best friend and I consider ourselves eggs benny connoisseurs and heard great things about this place so we decided to go for it! We really liked the fact they do a build your own benny, and it wasn't too overly pricey to add a bunch of things to it.  I ended up getting a brisket and sauteed mushroom benny. It was great and extremely flavorful, a little too filling though! My bad, sometimes I eat with my eyes :P Next time I'd probably just get the mushrooms, I liked them best and I think the meat is what made it heavy, still great though!  Our waitress was really nice and the overall service was good. She was friendly and appreciated our crappy jokes!   I also loved the little patio in the back that we sat in, it was like an adorable little back yard.   Great experience overall and I loved the excuse to head over to this area as I'm not there often!"}
{"text":"Everyone I know loves this place. Constantly hear great things about it.   I live in the area and was very excited to try this. Friend and I went for brunch about 2 years ago. Place was packed. We waited patiently. We like brunch and understand waiting.  Finally get in. We are hungry. We can't wait to eat. She ordered an Benny dish (I think?) And I ordered grilled cheese.  Grilled cheese sounded delicious. How can you go wrong with grilled cheese. Diners make grilled cheese! So I ordered an expensive grilled cheese. I bit into it and was disgusted. It was horrible. I could not figure out what was wrong. Why did it taste terrible (How can grilled cheese even taste terrible????). Are a bit more, tried to be polite and not make a scene...   Finally opened up sandwich and it is covered in mustard. I hate mustard. I hate it more than. Everything . why would the menu not list this? I was embarrassed thinking it was my fault, that i missed it on so I nibbled bread and then left. Terrible service meant noone came to check on us.  I just checked and it is not on menu. But won't be going back.  After we left I confessed to friend how horrible it was and said hers was too. That it was bland and a waste of money.  Why is this place popular???"}
