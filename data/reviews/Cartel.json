{"text":"Un virgin mojito et des tacos  aux champignons , au poulet, au saumon, aux poisson. Des merveilles, ambiance latine , en mode voyage . Juste un petit peu d'Amérique latine au Canada."}
{"text":"I really liked the taco with plantain and avocado - it was so tasty - delicate flavours - everything you can ask for and two nice little tacos for 6 bux - I am a fan :). We went on a weekday night (Thursday maybe) and thought the ambiance was good and found that Cartel was a great venue for catching up and chatting. They offer nice specials that will remind you of your favourite street vendors - what's not to love?"}
{"text":"We were told the gauc was big enough for a group to share. It's smaller then a scope of ice cream for 11 dollars ... taco Tuesday has food prices but tacos aren't very good capital tacos much better.  Cocktails were okay here"}
{"text":"Great ambiance, friendly staff and very good food at a very reasonable price.  I have been to cartel a few times and it feels like a proper spot where you can relax by yourself, with your friends or significant other.  The ambiance reminds me of a lounge yey theuaic keeps it upbeat.  One thing that I also like is that it is located very close to Fairmount bagels. I highly recommend this establishment for good food good service and a great ambiance."}
{"text":"Great mixture of food.  Staff is extremely friendly.  Atmosphere is very cosy.  Their cuisine is definitely something new to try"}
{"text":"We had the duck tacos, the plantain tacos, the papaya mango salad, and the Chinese greens.  Everything was amazing---we couldn't decide which of the tacos we preferred, and the greens and salad were perfectly dressed/seasoned.  The star comes off for the service; as another reviewer mentioned, they were really inattentive. It seemed like they were understaffed (two people for the whole place--poor things!).  I look forward to coming back, though."}
{"text":"Awesome place and a lot of fun! Tuesday's has a $2 taco special which is always fun. Great ambiance and friendly staff. Recommended!"}
{"text":"Met up with a girlfriend for some tiny bites to share.  I learned Wednesday is oyster night, so you can get 6 for $6 or 12 for $ 12 and they have a $5 champagne special. Everyone in the half full restaurant was eating oysters and drinking champ!  I wanted to go to the there, but my dining amiga wasn't into oysters and i didn't want 6 all to myself.  My fiance and I will come back here next wednesday to try this special.  What we did order was guacamole (10/10) shrimp and mango wontons (6/10) chicken skewers with a teriyaki sauce (7.5/10) and Baja fried fish tacos (8/10)  The fried foods weren't too greasy which was nice and the teriyaki sauce on the chicken was delicious.     The guacamole was the standout for me.  Chunky, creamy, with tomatoes and....feta?  There was some salty creaminess on top that really brought it home for me.  Served with super crunchy fried chips.    The onnnly think I noticed, was that even though all the servers were incredibly friendly they were not very attentive.  It took at least 10 minutes after I sat down before someone asked me if i wanted anything to drink even though the place was nowhere near capacity.  The entire course of the dinner from ordering a drink to getting the check I had a hard time getting anyone's attention.    I will go again for the oysters and see if the service improves the next time."}
{"text":"I've often walked by Cartel and been enticed by their chalkboard advertizing all kinds of delicious sounding specials.  So on a rainy Friday, with our hearts set on tacos, we ventured out to Cartel for lunch.  And I will definitely be back, hopefully with nicer weather so we can enjoy the terrace!  I was a little worried about portion sizes, never sure if a small plate is really going to be a small plate, or a tiny plate, or a giant plate.  But these portions were quite reasonable, and we definitely ordered a bit too much food, at least for a lunch.  We started with the guacamole, and I know, you're thinking: guacamole, really?  Was it ever good!  Especially the homemade tortilla chips it was served with.  I could go and order a fancy drink, and guacamole, and be a happy camper.  Then we had the mango, papaya and peanut salad: nice and simple, but well spiced, with a bit of a kick.  The perfect refreshing salad for a hot day.  For mains I had the fish tacos, and my dining companion had the lobster roll.  The fish tacos were really stuffed!  Just the tacos would have been enough for lunch for me.  Tasty too! Apparently the lobster rolls are decent, but unfortunately after having lobster rolls in the maritimes, from a lobster caught that very day, well, it's hard to compare.   I had the rootbeer mexicana, and yum yum!  If I'm going to order a drink when I go out, I make sure and order something involved, that has way more liquors in it than I would make at home.  And this really hit the spot.    The restaurant itself is really beautiful, and very much my style.  I'm not picky about the appearance of a restaurant, if it's tasty, I don't really care what the place looks like, but I still like to look at beautiful spaces, it's a bonus!  This place is definitely beautiful, with the painted ceiling and mirrors.  It would be a fantastic place to host a 5a7 with people you want to impress, or say, take your mom out for a really nice lunch, that is, if your mom is adventurous!  Mine is!  I hear that Tuesdays are $2 taco night, so I will definitely be coming back.  On a recent Tuesday I walked by, and sure enough the place was hopping, full of people munching happily on tacos.  Reminds me a lot of San Diego, it seems there is always somewhere having a happy hour with cheap tacos and drink specials."}
{"text":"Endroit sympathique et accueillant. Nous étions un groupe de 16 personnes et Federico nous a superbement reçu. Le service a été très fluide malgré le nombre de convives, de délicieux cocktails et des plats absolument fameux. Excellent Chimichanga et le pollo. Mélange de saveurs et d'origine que l'on ne peut pas classé en texmex. Une cuisine raffinée avec de belles découvertes et superbement exécutée. On sent la même envie de bien faire dans la réalisation des cocktails ainsi que dans l'accueil. J'y retourne pour goûter d'autres plats c'est certain ainsi que les fameux churros !!!"}
{"text":"Decent drinks, decent tacos. Taco Tuesday was satisfactory. The fish tacos are pretty good."}
{"text":"We've been regulars at Cartel over the last few moths. I learned about the restaurant on Yelp and decided to go check it out. On our first visit we enjoyed ourselves and learned about $1 Wednesdays and have been hocked ever since. On Wednesday Cartel serves up Oysters at a  buck a pop with the purchase of a drink. Can't beat that.   Cartel is a great place, with fun vibe, great decor, attentive staff and a great drink menu of tasty concoctions.   Typically we start with a drink and a few dozen oysters and then grab a few other things off the menu. Some of our favorites include; Baja Fish Tacos,  Shrimp Pintxos (a generous serving, great for sharing), the Lobster Roll, Camarones Del Diablo (they are very hot), Cantonese-style asparagus and wild mushrooms. The Chocolate & Churros is a must have dessert (again a large portion great for sharing)."}
{"text":"Rien de spécial. Tacos de poisson très ordinaires, ça manquait même de saveurs. Rouleux de canard un peu mieux. Sélection de vin vraiment ordinaire et les cocktails étaient presque manqués. Le service était bien toutefois. Je l'ai essayé l'été, spécialement pour la terrasse, mais il y a de biens meilleures options en ville, et surtout de bien meilleurs tacos, dans le même quartier, pour le même range de prix, voire moins cher."}
{"text":"A great find in a neat neighborhood. Moderately priced, good portions, and tasty.  I had the shrimp tacos and the Lobster roll. Both very good. A good blend of simple, fresh food.    However, be sure to understand pricing because you pay more for simple extras. My bill was unusually higher than I expected because there were extras added. My $8 taco ended up being a $15 dollar taco. So ask beforehand to avoid a surprise bill."}
{"text":"Two dollar tacos on Tuesday evening. Good drinks at a fair price."}
{"text":"We were in Montreal on a Saturday night looking for somewhere to go for dinner with a few friends in the Plateau/Mile End area. We were reservationless, hoping for some good food without a wait outside on a cold January night. Everyone knows there are a ton of great restaurants in Montreal - especially that area, but if you haven't planned ahead it can be very hard to avoid waiting a long time for a table and spending an arm and a leg when you get there.   Luckily, just as we were about to give up hope I stumbled across Cartel Street Food Bar on Yelp. We called, they had a table for us, and we were off to a great find. This place has unique dishes at a reasonable price. I'm convinced we won't be able to get in here without a reservation once it's discovered. The ambiance is nice, the service is helpful and friendly and the food is good.  The menu is, as the name leads you to believe, inspired by street food, specifically from Southeast Asia and Mexico, as well as some fusion between them.   There were five of us out to dinner, all interested in trying lots of things. The waitress suggested that three sharing plates plus some appetizers would be an appropriate amount of food and she was right.   From the sharing plates we ordered the top three (duck, chicken and pork) and to start we ordered guacamole, crispy wontons, duck wraps and oysters. Everything was fresh tasting, full of flavour and tasty. I would have liked for the food to be spicier, but I know that a lot of people are looking for less spicy food. It has enough flavour that the low spice wasnt' a deal breaker for me.   For that food, plus drinks and tax (but before tip) we ended up paying a bit more than $150, so the prices are very reasonable. We're looking forward to making this a more common stop when we're in Montreal."}
{"text":"Very cool place! Came here for $2 taco Tuesday's. Was a little disappointed that they only have a selection of 4 tacos for the special price, but they were all still declines. Splurged and also bought the plantain and avocado taco for full price. It was DELICIOUS. I was hesitant because it seems like a strange combo, but it was arguably the best thing I've ever tasted. We also got the guacamole and chips, which was good. The only reason I would give this place 5 stars is because of the drinks. We ordered a pitcher of red sangria, which our waitress said was the best one. It tasted more like watery juice than sangria. It did not have that delicious red wine taste one would normally hope for in a sangria. We ordered a few more drinks after the pitcher because it truly did nothing for us! I got the mango margarita. It came with a spicy pepper rim on the glass, it was quite good!"}
{"text":"Love seafood.  Their Peruvian Asian mix is unreal.  Tacos were good but go for the scallop ceviche, BBQ octopus, and squid sausage dish. Was so tasty. We got lucky and walked by it."}
{"text":"Cartel restaurant has a wide variety of very addictive street food inspired from many cuisines including Latin America, Vietnamese, Thai... now they they are bringing it to the streets of Montreal! Must try - for something different."}
{"text":"We were looking for a relatively quiet spot to sit outside and have an early dinner. After spotting Cartel and wandering the surrounding blocks, we returned to this place because it seemed to have the right vibe - relaxed with a decent menu. Our server had great energy and I'd give her five stars. Their cocktails looked good, but I was giving my allergies the night off alcohol, and my partner took advantage of their 2-for-1 beers for happy hour.  The food was terrific. Our favorite was a little duck dumpling \"slider\" that was a special that night. Our server said they often make them with pork and it's even better. We also loved the fish tacos. Even the mole, which they admitted is pretty tame, had good flavor.  If you're looking for an out-of-the-way spot in Mile End that has a nice environment, outdoor patio, and tasty food and drinks, give Cartel a try."}
{"text":"I took the shrimp taco. It was expensive and i didn't enjoy it as much. The oysters were good. I enjoyed their mango margarita. I wouldn't go to this place again."}
{"text":"I came here for taco Tuesdays with my friends. I absolutely loved the fish tacos! The environment is cozy, but I always go with friends, so it's nice. Service is fine, there was a lineup when I left, so it's a good thing my friends went early."}
{"text":"Cartel is good. It could be better though. Try it out for yourself and see but if you want a sure thing ... go to Ta Chido which is also in the Mile-End or Grumman '78 in Saint-Henri or Restaurant Amaranto in NDG.   There is amicable, informative and speedy service here! So that's good!  The libations were very good. I had a Cuba Libre that was good but quite plain. Rebecca had a Jack Daniels lemonade that was quite delicious. I then tried the Thai basil Mohito and found my drink of the day! It was absolutely beautiful. Splendiferous. Rebecca's second was a conventional mint Mohito which was excellent as well! There were also complimentary maple whisky shots; a pleasant surprise.   Okay, I am vegetarian and I went here with my omnivorous partner for an early dinner on Taco Tuesday. She quite enjoyed the lobster roll as well as the oysters. I am fully aware and sympathetically understanding of the fact that vegetarian fare may not be the prime and foremost concern to the average restaurateur; this is totally cool and I've got no beef with anybody on this point. Here's the however part. However, mostly every restaurant I go to has at least one or two good token vegetarian options. Cartel ... not so much. The guacamole was average if not bland and there wasn't too much of it either. The tortilla chips, however, were in abundance and were standard / average Mexican resto chips. Not to be boastful but any guac will turn out average when compared to my own home-made guac goodness and also nothing beats some nice organic blue corn tortilla chips. The avocado and plantain tacos were something cool to think about but were quite lacking on the taste front. They work in theory but not in practice. We need a little more ingenuity here. Seriously, anything can be a taco! The world is your taco! You can be as far-out and as creative as you want to be with different flavour combinations and ingredient selections and such and at the end of the day if you put it on a flat corn tortilla and call it a taco ... it's definitely a taco. I've had some damn good vegetarian tacos. Namely at Ta Chido on Parc in the Mile-End, Grumman '78 on Courcelle in Saint-Henri and Restaurant Amaranto on Monkland in NDG. These are some awesome and out-of-this-world tacos.   Cartel: I totally may just give you another chance because your drinks are really good and I like your atmosphere but you've totally got to step up your flavour game. You're not the only taco cartel in this city ... so stand out a bit ... or some up-and-coming hotshot might just edge you out. You know, Scarface or Pablo Escobar styles.   Good luck and godspeed."}
{"text":"I've been waiting all summer to sample their tacos from the Cartel truck, and they were finally in my area today at lunchtime.   I got there early enough to beat the massive lunch rush, and my order was taken only moments after I got there. To my surprise, I didn't order any tacos today, but their Muay Thai chicken. The server offered me a taste as soon as I had asked how it was prepared, and once I tried a bite, the thought of tacos had vanished from my mind. The chicken, blackened and juicy, was probably the best poultry I've tasted from a food truck this past summer. Don't get me wrong, I've had some fantastic food from mostly all of the trucks this summer, but this chicken completely knocked my socks off. Not spicy like I had first thought it would be, but tender, juicy, and oh so freaking delicious. This was nothing but some bad ass barbecue here. The bark on the chicken was perfect, crispy-crunchy magic. It came served in a Asian take-out box, which was half-full, served over a bed of a simple salad of Romaine lettuce, diced tomatoes and onions with a balsamic dressing--a perfect and welcoming balance to mouthful after mouthful of chicken.  The portion size? Absolutely perfect. I was about to order the guacamole, but they were sold out. I guess it ended up being a good thing, because I was plenty content with the amount of chicken I was served. Not skimpy, and not over the top, just perfect.  Definitely going to try to make it back to the truck before the end of the street food season to hopefully sample some more of their great menu. Great service, great prices, great food.   If you haven't been, go now."}
{"text":"Cocktails were very good.  I started with the 'Hot as F*ck' which was spicy and super refreshing all at the same time, very nice. My boyfriend, Jon had a 'Pisco Sour,' a classic done right.  We followed up with a second round of drinks, a Rhum based drink for me (can't seem to recall the name), it had a good herbal quality and a brightness from the Cava; Jon went for the Kentucky Wiseguy which was a pleasant balance of boozy and sweet.   It was Wednesday which (lucky us) means 6 oysters for 6 bucks or 12 for 12 bucks.  They were delightful 6 on the half and 6 grilled.  We also choose to go with the lobster roll and the carne asada tacos.  Loster roll had a pretty impressive amount of lobster and was quite delicious.  The fries were pretty much cold and limp, the salad/slaw was over dressed and didn't really do well with the heat/humidity, I admit they can't really do much about that.  The tacos were not great.  The red sauce on them was pretty bland and REALLY needed some salt.  We both felt that the tacos were super basic and really lacked seasoning and therefor flavor.  So not a total loss, but not really a win either.  Service was so so.  Not really as attentive as we have come to appreciate.  There was a point when I would have liked some salt and pepper, but he never came by to check on how things were with our food so I had to forgo the salt and pepper so that I could eat the food while it was hot.  I would surely come back for cocktails and oysters."}
{"text":"We came here for the famous taco Tuesday. The tacos were fantastic and the margaritas were stiff and delicious. We sat at the bar and watched the restaurant fill up while bartender worked her magic. She was multi tasked and took care of us with style.   The tacos were delicious. Montreal and Mexican. Who knew!   The crowd of as hope, multilingual, and fun. The energy of the place was loud and fun. Would go back for sure."}
{"text":"Good service, good food annnnd they have 2 for 1 cocktails for ladies on Thursdays :) . We had the Carnita and Fish taco. VERY filling!"}
{"text":"I went back to Cartel last night since my fiancee convinced me we should give them another chance and I was very pleasantly surprised. Not only was the ambiance really nice (good level of lighting, good music volume and selection, slightly noisy but not too much), the staff was fantastic. The owner greeted us personally, helped us navigate the menu and was very welcoming.   This was only half the story. The food and cocktails were out of this world. Let me start with the cocktails. I had their Cartel Cuba Libre, basically a twist on a rum and coke. Cartel uses mexican coke which is made from real sugar cane (not corn syrup) and you can taste the difference. The little touch of Galliano they add to it really kicked it up a notch. My fiancee got the Rising Sun cocktail, an interesting drink with hibiscus, ginger, appleton rum, and pineapple juice. She loved it, it was sweet and gingery while still having some nice floral notes.   I don't know what happened on our last visit, maybe the kitchen was still perfecting some of the recipes, I can vouch that this time, we were blown away. We started with the papaya salad (which was great, well-seasoned, fresh and presented elegantly), then we tried their karagee chicken. This is a japanese double-fried chicken, similar to Korean BonChon but not quite the same. It is really good, the breading is crispy without being greasy and the chicken is melt-in-your-mouth. We finished up the apps with the Mac+Cheese Grilled Cheese. What an awesome idea. They take mac and cheese, put it in a sandwich, lightly fry both sides in butter and serve it up with a sweet and spicy tomato sauce for dipping. I'm definitely going to use this idea at home when we have leftover mac and cheese.  For the mains, we tried their crispy hunan pork and teriyaki duck. The owner informed us that this hunan pork they get directly from a local farm every week, and it did not disappoint. Crispy little breaded pieces of pork served with peppers, green onions and a little sauce. What really amazed us though, was their teriyaki duck. I'm pretty picky when it comes to duck, and so is my fiancée. We can't count the number of times we've been in what are otherwise great restaurants only to be disappointed by a piece of duck where the fat is not crispy, or the meat is dry and overcooked. This was not the case here! The duck breast is marinated in teriyaki sauce and then seared and cooked to perfection. It is served up in slices on a bed of a dark sauce with green onions all around. Initially my fiancée and I were impressed and thought that this was a riff on the Peking Duck you can get at chinese places. Because of this, we thought the sauce was a hoisin sauce. When the owner came over to see how our meal was going, he explained to us that this was actually a homemade teriyaki which they make from scratch daily. It was absolutely fantastic.   By this point we were stuffed and didn't get to sample any desserts. I know for a fact, though, that both my fiancée and I will be back and we will tell our friends about how great an evening we had. This place is great for a casual couples dinner, dinner with friends, or even for drinks and snacks (the Karagee chicken with some drinks would go down very well). This place is a great addition to the neighborhood and Montreal is lucky to have two of these restaurants."}
{"text":"Not overly impressed with this place...went with a group of friends and we experienced pretty spotty service with some major mix-ups: a friend who ordered pork quesadillas (if I remember correctly) got halfway through her dish, saying it was pretty bland, before the waitress came back to explain that they'd forgotten to put the meat in her meal...then somehow the meat showed up in the poutine of a friend who'd ordered a meatless one. Said poutine was made with grated mozzarella instead of cheese curds (no excuse for that in Montreal, come on). The waitress wasn't really apologetic which we found a bit offensive considering the scale of the screw up. We ordered the churros for dessert and the waitress told us there would be a \"5 minute wait\" (we thought it a bit strange that she would mention that since 5 minutes is a perfectly normal length of time to wait for a course to be served, if not short!) - they arrived 30 mins later. Overall the food wasn't bad but not really anything to write home about, and the weird service and mix ups made for a mediocre experience overall."}
{"text":"Our new favorite because of Taco Tuesday! Yummy amazing Delish Fish, Chicken, pork belly Tacos!  Drinks we great! Only issues was mine came with a long strand of hair from the bartender! but the were quick to make good with a fresh one. They even went as far as to not charge us for my drink! Well done and excellent fix! Definitely coming back!!!"}
{"text":"J'y été hier soir-mercredi - en double date,  on a profité des spéciaux 1$ l'huître pour commencer avec des verres de cava( champagne catalan). C'était très bon, les deux ceviches que ce soit pétoncles ou saumon sont très bons aussi. La lumière est tamisée,  il y a de la musique sympa.   Le seul bémol c'est les desserts, les churros et les bananes plantains étaient beaucoup trop gras ce qui dénote avec toute la légèreté des mets consommés pendant la soirée"}
{"text":"J'ai vécu plusieurs premières en allant au Cartel!  - Première \"sortie\" sur la rue Fairmount - Première découvert du Cartel - Premier Pisco Sour (cocktail) - Premier Fish Taco  Je suis souvent passée sur la rue Fairmount, mais n'y suis jamais sortie. Quand je sors et prends quelques verres, en tant que résidente de Lasalle, j'essaie de concentrer mes sorties dans le centre-ville et dans le sud-ouest. Belles découvertes par contre.   Le Cartel, belle ambiance, lumières tamisés et service sympathique. J'ai bien aimé m'y retrouver.  Quelle belle découverte ce Pisco Sour. Miam!!! Ça faisait plusieurs fois que j'en entendais parler, mais n'avais jamais essayé. C'est pas donné donné (12$ le cocktail) mais c'était tellement délicieux que je m'en suis commendé un autre. Par contre, Bonus, hier soir (jeudi) les cocktails étaient 2 pour 1!!!! Woot woot!  Mon premier fish Taco... C'est en réalité pas mon premier, vu que j'en ai déjà fait à la maison  (Oui je m'aventure dans des cuisines inconnues) mais quand je les ai fait, c'était pas dutout le même chose.. et je dois dire que les miens n'étaient pas aussi bons... Mais vraiment, ils étaient VRAIMENT bons!!  Overall, belle expérience.. à répéter!!"}
{"text":"It's a place! It's ok! You can grab a table without waiting most of the time, except for taco Tuesdays. The tacos are fine, especially when they are cheap, but they aren't going to give you dreams, not particularly traditional, but a-ok. The guacamole plate is super tasty if you are looking for a snack to have with a drink (no drinking alcohol here without eating.)  This restaurant was part of an early wave of changes that came to a street I'd loved and lived on for years, and a lot of those changes have driven out older folks and lower income creative neighbours in favor of what too often seems to me to be a mostly copy/paste culture. Cartel is not the worst of this, and it's stuck around where others failed, probably because the waitresses are truly nice and the room is comfortable enough, there are big windows and pretty tasty cocktails."}
{"text":"Nous sommes entré pour boire un verre. Mais il faut manger, dans ce cas c'était une surprise incroyable. Nous avons pris un lobster rol' pour deux. Il était incroyable. La salade d'accompagnement avait une vinaigrette très goûteuse. Nous attendons présentement un deuxième plat parce que notre appétit s'est ouvert très grand parce que c'était tellement bon (ma copine m'a fait rajouter ce détail qui s'avère vrai). Le Margarita est aussi excellent. Ma copine est ravie de son choix de vin rouge."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner on a weekend, we were a group of 6 people but did not have trouble finding a table, place was not full. We had some guacamole to share as a starter which was really good. I then opted for two orders of tacos instead of a main platter. I'm no taco expert, however the mushroom tacos as well as the fried fish were very tasty. The portion are good and the prices reasonable. The ambiance was not the best, expected more music and vibes for a weekend."}
{"text":"I first discovered Cartel because my cousins kept raving about this taco place they loved in the plateau. So on a random Thursday night, my sibblings and I were in the area and decided to give it a try. The ambience of the place is great! Dim light setting, with a chalkboard behind the bar listing the specials and communal seating virtually throughout the restaurant, it made for a nice change from the customary type of restaurants you see everywhere. It had a cool feel in general and to no ones' surprise, it was pretty busy, though we only had to wait 5 minutes to get a table for 3. Once seated, we decide to order some wine and try a few cocktails. The wine was great and for 40$ shared between 3 people, it was a bargain. Then, based on what we were told, we proceeded to order a guacamole for the table and tacos for ourselves. The guacamole is definitely something I recommend as a starter. It comes with an abundance of fried chips, which are forgetable, but the guacamole itself, which they add feta cheese on top aswell as fresh cilantro, is delectable. I ordered the beef tacos, which let me tell you were amazing, but what Cartel is apparently well known for, something which our nice waiter had told us, was their fish tacos. I got to try one, from my sister's plate and it was delicious! They serve it with a slice of avacado, cilantro, limes, sour cream, and pickled onions. It tasted sooo good!   I probably first tried this place 5 weeks ago, and since then I've been back 5 times. I recommend that you go on \"Taco Tuesdays\", when tacos are 2$ each instead of 4-5$ each, but it can be hard to get a table and they don't take reservations on Tuesdays for that reason. Throughout my other 5 times I have only good things to say except for one time when the waitress forgot my drink and then proceeded to forget my food aswell, after serving the entire table, she only realized when she gave me my bill. But alas, one bad time out of 5 is why I gave them 4 stars.  NOTE: their seasonal menu featuring street food from around the world is definitely worth trying! I've had their chinese fried salt and pepper chicken and it was delicious! So try it before they change the menu up again! Also my brother ordered the lobster roll there, and if you are like me and LOVE lobster anything, this was worth the money, it tasted so good.  Lastly, the Churros with chocolate sauce is a MUST if you still have room for dessert. One portion is enough for 3 people easily.  OH OH and do read the chalk board, especially if you've been a few times already, cause the daily specials are usually worth trying and something new is always good!"}
{"text":"Whenever I'm in the Mile End and I'm wondering where I could eat, I usually end up at Cartel. Everything on the menu is great but really, the fish taco is the reason I go there again and again.  Only criticism would be their beer selection, I'm a beer drinker and it's not great. Better have a drink or some sangria.  Best way to get acquainted with the place: 2$ tacos on Tuesday.   Best way to become addicted to this place: 2$ tacos on Tuesday."}
{"text":"TL;DR, go on Tuesday, get plantain tacos.  This place has somehow become my first genuine \"regular\" in the city - I hit up Taco Tuesday at least once a month.  I had always planned to visit the previous tenant, Bond, and never quite managed it. Since the change, Cartel has done well to make the spot more \"people-friendly\", with an ambiance somewhere between laid-back comfort food joint, occasional sports bar (when the Habs are playing) and borderline supperclub. As a result, there will be times when you'll need to wait a few minutes before a spot opens up.  While they have a rather robust menu (their ceviche offerings are rather good), and all sorts of varying nightly specials, I'll focus on the taco experience, as that's what I know best.  In keeping with the \"trendier\" taco joints in Montreal, these are not what you might consider to be \"authentic Mexican\" tacos--at least not the kind I enjoyed while living in Mexico--nor do they claim to be. Their staples--especially the Baja Fish and Plantain tacos--hit the spot. Thankfully, these are on the half-price ($2 per taco) special menu every Tuesday, along with a beef and chicken (one of which has since been replaced by a pork taco, I think). They also have a number of seasonal specials, which I've found to be a bit hit-or-miss.  Cartel keeps a well-stocked bar, and while some of the cocktails on the menu (especially the nightly specials) aren't overwhelmingly good, the bartenders can whip up almost anything, including a virgin Caesar that holds its own. They've got the bases covered for beer (tap/bottle, local/import) and wine (all your usual regions).  The service is very friendly, especially if you're seated at the bar, where you can expect to find yourself interacting with your neighbours, maybe even over a shot. The music here tends to be the sort of stuff you'd find on Soundcloud--remixes, mashups and interesting takes on familiar classics, and is never too loud to talk over.  Thanks to the location, this is a rather stellar spot to grab a quick bite before heading out to your mile-end watering hole of choice."}
{"text":"I have been few times to their Taco Tuesday. Hands down best fish tacos in town. They are 2$ each, you have to get a mandatory drink with your order but it is so worth it. The cocktails you get are well priced and delicious"}
{"text":"Had a dozen oysters, tortillas with guac, beef short rib tacos and Home fries. Everything was delectable, great cool place to wind down after a long week. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Conceptually... I mean, you make a Peruvian and Mexican food fusion restaurant and call it \"Cartel\"? Eek! But, I tried the chijaukay chicken and it was actually pretty good. It lacked a sauce and rice, as it is normally a sauce-y dish served with rice, but the flavours were right. Would I come back to taste the other Peruvian items in the menu? Possibly, yes. Was it the most amazing culinary experience? Nope, but it doesn't have to be!"}
{"text":"I keep coming back here.  It's not a southern restaurant, but the fried chicken is probably the best thing on the menu.  It's not a mexican restaurant, but the fish tacos are a close second.  If you're less than three people, sit at the bar; the bartenders are friendly and make great drinks."}
{"text":"Food is amazing. Especially the duck poutine and the baja tacos. 2nd time here. Will for sure come back."}
{"text":"I was taken aback when our server (perhaps the owner?) scoffed at my order of the vegetarian tacos.  \"Have you had our fish tacos?\" \"No.\" \"They're really good.\" \"O...kay.\"  But you know what? He was right. They were fantastic, and I've been back."}
{"text":"Friendly service, very good food, try the salmon tartar and the fish tacos. Worth the visit!"}
