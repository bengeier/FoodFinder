{"text":"This place is great. Just ordered delivery with UberEats and fast cheap and delicious. Hot pepper chicken was amazing if you like spicy. Def order again."}
{"text":"Best  little Chinese joint in town.  Nothing fancy, just clean fast great service and food. Really tasty food."}
{"text":"Have gotten lunch from here several times.  Solid food, friendly folks. Right next to 7-Eleven. Menu limited, as compared to other places, but you should be able to find something you enjoy; I have!  

They'd appreciate your business!"}
{"text":"Kung poa noodle soup!

Spicy salty mildly sweet flavor. There's plenty of chicken and shrimp in the broth. Also, carrots, onions, scallions, cabbage, & Szechuan peppers. Noodles are perfectly cooked. I give it an 8/10 for a takeout restaurant, this noodle soup is excellent!! I'm sure it's the best item on the menu. Will buy again!"}
{"text":"Great quality, cleanliness, and customer service.  The hot pepper chicken is outstanding.  The best Chinese Take-out  I've had in Charlotte, hands down."}
{"text":"The reviews sounded good so thought I'd give it a try. Will not go again. Ordered Sesame Chicken, Chicken Lo Mein and egg rolls. Sesame Chicken was so overcooked/dried out, it was inedible and the meager amount of sauce was very bland, didn't remotely resemble any sesame chicken sauce I've ever had (and I've been eating Chinese food since the seventies). Chicken Lo Mein and egg rolls were also bland...the egg rolls from Jack in the Box are better."}
{"text":"I go there every week to get their hot pepper beef. The menu selection is limited but all is good."}
{"text":"One of the best kept secrets as far as Chinese food goes. The quality and taste are far above what you would expect from this small gas station location. You won't find a more tasty kung pao sauce. The sesame chicken is small strips of white meat with a light crispy glaze. No low quality, fatty over fried chicken here. Portions are very generous as well."}
{"text":"I ordered the Kung Poa and Spicy Chicken combo which comes with fried rice. Everything was hot, fresh and delicious! The quality of the food was higher than expected. I will be returning often."}
{"text":"Don't sleep on this place because it's attached to a gas station. I've been here 3 times in the last week. Flavorful food, good portions, good price, and extremely nice people!"}
{"text":"The best General Tso's Chicken! Excellent flavor & texture. Very friendly staff! Better than Jin Jin for sure!"}
