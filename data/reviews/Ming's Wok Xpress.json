{"text":"Where does 5 stars come from? The beef was unbearable (slimy) the vegetable were NOT fresh they were also slimy. The dumplings were doughy even though we asked them to be well done. The only thing that was good was the sauces everything was cooked in, tasty. It's so annoying people post 5 stars makes me wonder what kind of crap they eat cause this place was terrible!"}
{"text":"Found this little gem during my search for mushu pork near my home since my usual spot removed it from the menu. It's a very hard dish to find!
I'm not going to lie, the location is sketchy. It's in a little strip mall in Pineridge and when I was there early Saturday night, the area was deserted. 
I had preordered my pork and hubby got the shanghai noodles. Food was ready on arrival and prices were decent. 
The mushu pork was awesome! Hot with lots of meat veggies and eggs. I really loved the pancakes, larger than the ones I'm used to receiving and they hold up! No splitting or dripping!
Hubby enjoyed his noodles, he said they were really spicy but in a good way. 
All in all, I'm thankful they have a website, as most Chinese restaurants do not. If not for it and seeing that they have mushu pork, I might of missed this little gem!
This will likely become my new go to for Chinese near home."}
