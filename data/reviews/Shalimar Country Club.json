{"text":"Just played there yesterday with my wife.  It's a good course for beginners and other golf challenged people.  It was in fair shape.  The fairways and greens were pretty shaggy and the rough was mostly hardpan.  Despite that, it was a fun round.  There are a few interesting holes.  The people in the clubhouse are super nice, so the after round drinks and food were great, too.  Great hot dogs!"}
{"text":"When I was fo years old I was the 5 time defending wiffle ball state Jr Olympic golf champion. I beat golf legend Thurnis Haley in a play off hole for a Pacific Cooler Capri Sun. My success only lasted for a while as I stated getting bullied in school and turned to drugs for all my problems. My life was on a downward spiral and I tried killing my self because I lost my 4.0 gpa. Like can I even get into ASU with a 3.9 gpa ??? Anyway Shaligusta helped me improve my ball compression ratio and if it wasn't for John Rogers and Sue Gulley I would be nothing more than an overly annoying hipster nerd fuck tard who knows nothing more than poppin pills..."}
{"text":"I had about 90 min. to kill before next job, I was in the area and came in to see if they would allow me to rent or borrow a 7-iron to hit golf balls, not only did they give me a 7 iron but the young man at the counter also said how about a wedge and a 9 iron? Very cool from my point of view, I purchase a large bucket of balls and enjoyed my down time. I wished I only had enough time to play the 9 holes! It's been a couple of years since I was in Shalimar and loved the look of the new floors. Manager of the restaurant was extremely pleasant. For the golf enthusiast this is a great place to experience it."}
{"text":"Played Foot Golf here with my husband and another couple.... so much fun!!!!  A bit more expensive than I had expected ($42/couple) but it was Sunday and the mimosas were bottomless until 2pm which meant I drank about 35 of them.    Breakfast burrito was inexpensive and delicious.  Staff was friendly and very accommodating.   Can't wait to get back out there!!!"}
{"text":"Great place to work on your short game.  Greens are small but challenging.  The course is in the best shape I've ever seen it.  Friday night there's live entertainment along with great food!  Nice place to hang out and meet new friends!  We'll keep coming back!"}
{"text":"My experience at Shalimar Country Club was the worst golfing experience I ever had.  The course itself is in terrible shape and looks like it hasn't had any TLC since the 40's. I showed up on a Sunday to play FootGolf, with my father and 2 kids.  The equipment is provided by the Club, the fees are the same as golf and kids are welcome.  There were not many people on the course, but as soon as we started, a single player started right behind us.  After the FIRST hole, we let him play through, thinking that would be the last time we saw him.  Unfortunately, after a few holes, he ended up behind us AGAIN, not sure how that happens.  He proceeded to tee off multiple balls, even though we were in the middle of the fairway.  When I asked him to stop hitting balls until the fairway was clear, he became extremely belligerent, threatening violence.  Unfortunately this Club did not have an Ambassador driving around the course to ensure everyone was playing nicely.  When I complained to the kid in the Clubhouse, our money was refunded immediately.  While I appreciate this, there was no consequence to the lunatic golfer.  After having experienced this Club, it's obvious the atmosphere is a free for all, with no one really in charge.  This golf course is as low rent as they come."}
{"text":"Shalimar is a great place for any skill level golfer. Shalimar is where I first started to golf and without the staff and hospitality, I wouldn't be where I am today. Traveling around the world and playing in prestigious tournaments, it's nice to call a place like Shalimar my home. The course is a great layout. The greens are small in size with elevation, making you think of every shot. The staff that works there are trully amazing. All very helpful and personable. Now that Shimar has footgolf, it brings in a whole new crowd to the course. Golf needs a little excitement and I think whatever Shalimar is doing, will bring many children to love the game. I recommend playing golf or footgolf at Shalimar to everyone around. Shalimar will always be a place I call home."}
{"text":"This pains me because normally the restaurant/bar at Shalimar GC is a nice little place to hang out.  Went today to watch some NFL and noticed a stale smell to the place however main gripe is that my wife and I sat down at the bar for well over 5 minutes and were never even greeted- much less served.  The bartender was absent for some of this time but eventually came back, ignored us and disappeared again.  We finally left and will spend our money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Nothing short of an amazing experience for my first time at the Shalimar Country Club. I was drawn here to this hidden gem while looking for some great American fare. And I was far from disappointed.  I sat at the bar and was immediately greeted by Bryan the bartender. He whipped me up an extra dirty martini so quickly I was stunned. I was even more surprised at the taste. It was made perfectly.  Then came the food. I ordered a scorpion burger with extra jalape√±os. One word: Phenomenal. My only additive would be some sort of spicy sauce as it wasn't spicy enough for me.   The burger came with tater tots which were crispy and perfectly fried.  My second drink was a perfect Rob Roy. And what a delicious perfect Rob Roy. Clearly, Bryan knew what he was doing.  Tips for the perfect experience at Shalimar:   * Ask for Bryan and sit at the bar; don't be afraid to get something beyond your standard vodka and cranberry because he knows how to make ANYTHING. * Get the tater tots. Nuff said. * If you get the scorpion burger, order with extra hot sauce  Enjoy fellow Yelpers! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"71 degrees on Saturday Dec 10.  3 pm.  High Golf Season in Arizona! Three of us went to the driving range.  \"Sorry, we are out of balls.  The guy who picks them up won't be back today\".   Good one, Shalimar.  You did not anticipate that people might want to golf in 71 degrees on a Saturday. You just confirmed that my initial one star rating was not a mistake."}
{"text":"great atmosphere here @ shalimar.  a few months back i was there to help 2galsevents with a charity golf tourney.  it was the \"par it in pink\" event.  and it went really smoothly.  i drove around and helped take some pictures of the event to post.  i also helped with the set up pre-dawn that morning.  all in all this was a casual golf course right in Tempe and we had a great time that day."}
{"text":"I love shalimar ! That Paul guy is so great love em !"}
{"text":"This is a good challenge for a nine hole course. Small greens, water in play, trees and o.b. Very kid friendly. Try it out. It's a great place to get nine holes on!"}
{"text":"Shalimar hosted a FootGolf open day last weekend and it was my first time there. Like many older courses in Arizona, they have the charm of Caddyshack style club that doesn't take its self too seriously. The staff were very friendly and helpful. It's only a 9 hole course and it means you can get around quick. It was a fun day playing this new and interesting game.  It's encouraging to see such a well know established golf club open to ideas and trying out new games to support the club and it's patrons.   Good luck to everyone with this new adventure and supporting FootGolf. If you've never tried it, you should, it's cheap and fun to play for everyone, with little or nor experience in either soccer or golf. I'd recommend it."}
{"text":"I have only visited this place for Kiwanis Club of Tempe - Nuevo meetings every Tuesdays at 12pm and Kiwanis Club of Tempe meetings every Thursdays at 12pm.  But I would say that all the staffs who works here are very kind and friendly."}
{"text":"Although \"foot golf\" is a really cool concept and looks fun, the soccer teams are constantly in the way on the golf course. The course should not have both games being played concurrently. Not safe!!  In addition we constantly had to wait on them which really extended our game....waiting.  Not fun or safe."}
{"text":"Ahh, Shaligusta . . .   I like Shalimar.  It's a fun, cheap, little 9 hole course hidden in central Tempe.    Has it seen better days?  Yep.   Is the course in great condition?  Never. Do they play classic rock over a loudspeaker by the clubhouse like you're in the movie Caddy Shack?  Yep How often can you shank a ball into somebody's backyard?  On 7 of the holes What are the odds of getting drilled with a ball from the range while on the first fairway?  Well, I haven't been hit yet . . . . . . . . . . yet.  I still like it though.  It's all about expectations, and when I play Shaligusta I'm just there to have a good time with the boys"}
{"text":"I have been going to this golf course for over 15 years it's a hit or miss on coarse, as far as the condition.    You have a fun little nine hole family owned place to go.  They recently have remodeled the club house. I have been going once a week since last October with my dad.  Not any more I complained to the manager of the restaurant of the poor service you get it is hit or miss weather or not your going to get acknowledged or served especially in the late afternoon when I have gone with neighbors.   My dad went to the Valentines day dinner thought it was great so we decided to go for Easter Brunch Mistake...  we arrived at 12 most of the food like the fruit and deserts were picked over they had three scrambled egg dishes salad ham and turkey I think marginal Brunch not very attentive staff although they actually had plenty.  There was three in my party they added a 20% gratuity and the bill came to $88 I will never go back and I live in the neighborhood.   I gave you many chances and complained and you still couldn't figure it out. ."}
{"text":"Expect a super friendly, relaxed environment where people just want to play some golf and enjoy the AZ sun."}
{"text":"Played the first hole. Turned around and went home. Only a 9 whole course. There is no fairway on the first hole just grass. I get to the green and it looks like hell. Bumpy and furry. This is not a real course for real golfers. Also have to share the course with kick golf people and disc golfers. Dobson ranch is the same price (for 18) and has real greens."}
{"text":"I love the range here! The staff is friendly, it's peaceful and very relaxed for people who barely know how to hold a club (ahem, me...)"}
{"text":"Ok so it's not a fancy PGA golf course, but it's a great place to relax and play a round without the snobbiness often found at nice golf courses.  It's a great place for beginners or for people looking to take their time and to enjoy life.  The course consists mainly of par 3's and minimal hazards so it's great for working on your swing without fear of losing balls!  Everyone is laid back and drop ins are welcome!"}
{"text":"Great place to play golf while drinking beer. Very laid back, cheap and inviting. Usually it is not too crowded, but I tend to play during the hotter months (like most Phoenicians.)"}
{"text":"Great service at this course!  You're getting an A-OK nine holes! It's maintained fairly decently. This course would be great for someone just getting into golf. Although, I think there are other 18 hole courses that are a better deal."}
{"text":"Shalimar is a great place to get a quick 9 holes in before or after work.  It is not as well manicured as Riverview (up the road a few miles), and it's a lot shorter, but it has a few interesting holes.  The most popular is the 5th hole, which requires a carry over a lake to get to the green.    It's a great value.  Last I played, it was just $7 to walk.  This is a great place to just have a fun, easy going short round of golf."}
{"text":"Cheap, easy, and a classic. This course is not anything you would see in North Scottsdale, but it is a fun 9-hole course which you can walk it and be done within 90 minutes. They do have a few par 4's and a hole or two which you have water. This course has been around for years and it does have that classic vintage feel to it."}
{"text":"The star is for the food, it was ok. The service was terrible. We walked in through the bar, sat outside and waited for about 15 for someone to swing by to take our order. There were 2 customers there when we arrived. We had kids with us, maybe the bartender/server is not a fan of kids? Finally I walked in to get beers as our bartender/server was sitting at a table with guests. I asked to get two beers. I almost felt as though I needed to apologize for interrupting her to place my drink order. Later.. the server/bartender took our food order and was becoming a bit more welcoming. I went in later to get our check. I said \"can we get our check\" she replied \" Well I have to write it down because our computer system us down\" she said it as if I were a total inconvenience, not the computer system but ME. I should have said \"well if it's too much I can just leave and not pay\" :) We live within walking distance and only go to Shalimar a few times a year because the service at the bar is unfriendly. I think they're missing some serious revenue do to their unfriendly staff. We would probably go weekly if it was a bit more welcoming."}
{"text":"Had a great time golfing 9 holes here and it is very reasonably priced.  Will definitely be playing here again."}
{"text":"I debated with myself on whether or not I'd write this, because I live about 5 blocks from Shalimar and I really want it to succeed. However, today was a bit frustrating for me and my fellow golfer. We were on Hole 7 when we were approached by an elderly lady that was golfing with the foursome in front of us. She identified herself as the \"Course Ambassador,\" and had a name tag on her visor (don't remember her name but she spoke with an accent I couldn't identify). She pointed out a sign on the golf cart stating that there was not supposed to be any carts driving on the fairways until November 12th due to the recent re-seeding. She was very polite, and we politely replied that we would comply with that. However, within 5 minutes of our admonishment, she and her partner were driving their cart all over the fairways. Furthermore, after I had hit an errant ball, she had driven her cart, again on the fairway, over to my ball and picked it up. It looked like she was going to keep it until I shouted over to her that it was mine.  Look, I get the explanation we were given as to why Shalimar didn't want us driving our cart on the fairways. But, \"do as I say not as I do\" is frustratingly maddening for paying customers. Please understand the bad optics of having someone come over and interrupt our game to point out our transgression, only to commit the same transgression, and then add to it all by picking up my ball. Seriously, that's golf etiquette 101."}
{"text":"I have been to Shalimar a handful of times over the past four years.It appeared they had some life in them last summer 15' and the food was getting better, I was excited about Shalimar. It appears they have fallen down again. Don't bother going, no one working there cares about the place and it's falling apart."}
{"text":"Love the attention being paid to a spot of History in Tempe. Always a challenging course and a great place to work on your mid-iron and short game. I'd rather come here than the range to work on my game. The nice thing is, if I can't make it during the day, I can hit at the lit driving range. If you haven't been here to check out the family friendly fun happening at Shalimar, you should try it. Golf, Food, Family Fun. It's even Footgolf friendly! I highly recommend them!"}
{"text":"Not a very friendly \"Director of Golf Operations,\" Eric Manmano.  He hung up on me in mid-conversation.  I guess he is not interested in free marketing for his golf course in front of some of the largest companies in Phoenix?  I guess they have all of the clients they need and they are not interested in taking on any new customers.  Too bad."}
{"text":"We had mother's day brunch and overall this place was a fail.  The buffet was $16.95/person + tax + 18% gratuity.  Over priced!!!  My water glass was refilled only once, our dirty plates weren't taken until we asked, our silver wasn't replaced and the buffet selection was unimpressive. No omelet bar or anything beyond basic buffet."}
{"text":"The golf is good, not great, but it is one of the last 9 hole courses I know in the area. It is nice to get a quick round in or play a summer league.  They have a new chef that spent 20 years in Miami, I just had an amazing Cuban sandwich. It was the best I've had. It is definitely worth a stop, as is the other food."}
{"text":"Ironically this place is not too bad. I stopped in for a driving range experience. And was able to pop into the bar/restaurant area for a cold one. The staff was very nice and a small bucket of balls was only $5. Word on the street is they have endless Mimosas on sundays :) I will be trying this out myself next weekend   Cheers"}
{"text":"Shalimar is a staple in the city of Tempe, and I've been playing their since I was first able to swing a club. I just turned 30, and yes Shalimar has changed hands throughout the years but they are still that same local course that I learned to play golf on. They are a 9 hole executive course with 2 par 4's, a full driving range, putting green, and chipping green. They keep the course in great condition and with the water hazards and bunkers keep it challenging. The course meanders it's way through one of Tempe's classic 60's neighborhoods and is great for new and old golfers alike. They offer great deals on lessons with a local pro who can help get you started or take your game to the next level. The guys in the pro shop are very knowledgeable and always eager to help. They even have a full restaurant and are always holding events in the evenings during the week. Whether you're new to golf or a veteran like me who just likes to have fun Shalimar is a great place to play. I'm glad they've stuck around all these decades and haven't lost their small local charm."}
{"text":"The comment above: \"Do not eat breakfast at Shalimar though, eat before you head over there-- the breakfast menu is limited to frozen breakfast burros and items of the like,\" is completely untrue. All of the food is made to order and tastes amazing! They will even cook breakfast for you before the kitchen opens if you are hungry! Shalimar is a fun laid back place to golf and the bartenders are great and the staff is very helpful."}
{"text":"Shalimar is a great place either if you're learning the game or want to squeeze in a quick 9 in the afternoon. Contrary to what the most recent review said, the course is mostly par 4s--I think 6 par 4s and 3 par 3s. There's a fair amount of shade on the course near almost every tee, so walking isn't unbearable even on a hot day.  The course itself is in pretty rough shape. Particularly the tee boxes are grown out too long and there are sections of fairway near the sprinklers that get water-logged which basically stops your ball immediately in a pile of muck. The other frustrating thing is that a lot of the greens are tabletop kind of greens so it's very tough to leave your approach on the green. Anyway it's well worth it and for someone getting back into the game like myself, it's a great value. The people there are always nice and folksy too."}
{"text":"We live very close to Shalimar and frequently spend an afternoon at the driving range here.  Everyone is so nice and friendly and it's a great neighborhood hangout.  The grounds are well kept and there are plenty of trees to keep you cool.  It's only $9 for a large bucket of balls for the driving range.  We haven't done so yet, but we really want to try out the footgolf course!"}
{"text":"Just finished a nice round of golf in the Monday night league. Craving some food. Guess what? Only happy hour food available and according to the bartender it's because the kitchen is closed on Monday for cleaning and we're lucky the cook came in to make appetizers. Interesring. Last week we saw food served. Not to us, we couldn't even get a 2nd beer. And tonight? Only way to even get appetizers is to go to the bar and order. Not happy, not happy at all. Come on Shali, it's Monday night league. Oh, and you may want to update your website, says the kitchen is open tonight until 730. And we got here at 7."}
{"text":"First of all, I don't golf so I cannot review the golf course.  This is in my neighborhood and I want so badly to support it.  I love the atmosphere in the clubhouse and have been giving it a try a couple times per year for the past couple decades.  Each time they advertise that they've got new chefs or they're trying out new meals, drink specials, etc., I head back down to give it a shot. Each time, I'm disappointed.  A few weeks ago, I talked my family into trying out the new brunch menu.  There was a golf tournament just ending and the players were so loud our family couldn't hear each other.  I realize, this is a golf course, but maybe they could find a way to make it both golfer and family-friendly.  Then, my omelette was tiny and honestly looked like a child made it.  Everyone in our group had similar meals and vowed they won't return.  This Tuesday, I went down for their \"pasta and salad buffet.\" Assuming there would be an array of pasta and salad choices, I was once again let down with the offering, which seemed more like a church potluck, of pre-sauced spaghetti (albeit with sauce that tasted homemade), garlic bread, a large bowl of lettuce, cucumbers, croutons and dressing, served on styrofoam plates for $10.  I'm sorry, Shalimar.  I don't give very many negative reviews and it breaks my heart to give this one.  Unless I am fully convinced through word of mouth that you're willing to take some risks and serve truly excellent food, I won't be back."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE.  We are golfers but played foot golf, our first time at this course. The price was the same as regular golf, but the 'greens' and fairways were horrible.  It appeared as though they used service roads for the foot golf course.  I wouldn't mind playing here again, but they would have to discount the price by 50%.  I wish there was another course that offered foot golf in the Phoenix area.  The Country Club itself shows its age, and so do the patrons.  It appeared to be a regular crowd at the bar and they did not seem welcoming to 'outsiders'."}
{"text":"Man I wish this was a 18 hole course.... Its so refreshing to play golf in tempe and not have every hole souronded by desert but instead lush grass and trees . This course just isnt long enough other wise id be here all the time. Can barley use my driver. They do have a good club house with decent deals ."}
{"text":"I live nearby so I decided to grab some drinks and food here. Having golfed here before I didn't expect much, so being let down further seemed like it would be nearly impossible but apparently the kitchen felt like overachieving in mediocrity today. My one star review really hinges on one thing.....the wings. You can't mess up Bud Light any further than Anheuser-Busch already has so that was to be expected. However, we just made it in time to order off the happy hour menu so grabbing some wings sounded like a stellar plan. $6 for Buffalo wings on happy hour seemed like a deal so the order was placed. 30 minutes later the wings arrived and boy oh boy was that the start of the road to one star. The wings were just boring (to be expected) but the  quantity is where my problem lies. Five wings for $6 on happy hour??? What the hell is the normal price for these five apparently magical wings? These better have come off of a baby pegasus to charge that price for so little. Long story short......don't get the wings if you don't want to end up still hungry and annoyed."}
{"text":"Shalimar is a 9 hole golf course.  This is pretty perfect for the summer I would think, when you can only last outside for a few hours.    It's an unpretentious, easy going, laid back golf course that has cheap drinks.  You aren't coming here for luxury.    This place would be perfect  for my golf game since I SUCK and it's only 9 holes and like I said, cheap drinks.  A good place for lessons, practicing and just hanging out.  If you are not an avid golfer or prefer going to courses where you won't be judged or embarrassed of your game-- then head to Shalimar.    Disclaimer ***  I didn't actually play, I was just along for the fun-- this is the vibe I got and what I got from conversation from others.    Do not eat breakfast at Shalimar though, eat before you head over there-- the breakfast menu is limited to frozen breakfast burros and items of the like."}
{"text":"The owners of this place are awesome. They conrinue to come up with creative events outside of 9 hole golf. Drone races, Frisbee golf, pokemon hunting.  We came here for $5 pokemon hunting and  $3 beers.  If you check in in Yelp free shot.  They provided golf carts to all the families with young kids for free.  I have read the reviews about bad service and have never experienced it.  I had my bridal shower here as well.  The cost was more then reasonable.   I would have my next event here with the service recieved and the value for the money."}
{"text":"Are you new to golf?  Do you want to learn at a country club where you won't be judged on the fact that you've missed the ball the last five times you've swung the club, and you've plopped so many balls in the lake that you're having to search the bushes for old range balls to keep playing?  Do you want to play golf without having to pay a large amount of money per person?  How does a summer-time $20/person 9-holes plus included golf cart, beer and hot dog sound to you?  Yes, the course has some dirt on it.  The grass isn't plush, and it's sometimes difficult to figure out where to tee off when the footgolf tees are complicating matters.  But who cares?  Shalimar's one of my favorite golf courses in the Valley.  You can beat up the ground and not worry about the fact that you're only 10 minutes ahead of the professional golfers creeping up behind you.  Also, there's a bunch of locals who hang out at the bar sometimes and you can drink with them.  Much more entertaining than most golf courses.  Oh, except the water hole... I hate that hole so much.  If you're a novice like me, you'll know what I'm talking about when you get there."}
{"text":"Upside: there is grass in some parts of the course  Downside: they allow for parties of 8 to play soccer golf in the middle of the course. We complained and they didn't do anything.  The course is small, missing grass in large part. Looks like a place where homeless people golf.   Wouldn't play again for free. I want a refund."}
{"text":"I played footgolf at Shalimar and had an absolute blast. If you are training for the PGA tour than this isnt the place. But if you are looking to throw a couple drinks back and have a great time with friends than this is the place."}
{"text":"A nice place for a casual Sunday brunch.  There is a shaded patio, and it's nice to sit outside by the golf course.  I ordered the omelette, and it was nothing special, but not bad either.  The atmosphere is very casual.  If they have a dress code, I can't tell what it would be.  The service was good.  The prices are very reasonable. My three egg omelette with 4 ingredients was $9.a couple of caveats: people smoke cigars on the patio, so if that bothers you, a seat inside might be better.  The Bloody Marries are very spicy, so you may want to ask them to go easy on the horseradish and tabasco if you don't want your eyes to water."}
