{"text":"Delicious and nutritious! And this is the best Chopped Leaf location in Calgary. The staff are always smiling."}
{"text":"Yum! Delicious, fresh salads and super friendly service. A little on the pricey side for quick service food but the serving sizes are big and I'm always stuffed by the time I finish."}
{"text":"Chopped Leaf is a good spot for a creative salad, wrap or sandwich. My go-to is the Sunshine Salad (mixed greens, cucumbers, mozzarella, avocado and apples) with chicken and the store's signature Goddess dressing. All the ingredients are fresh and the service is friendly, Biggest complaint is the price: a full sized salad with protein ranges from $12 to $13 which is a little much for fast food."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to trying out this place as I think it is a good idea to offer salads and bowls rather than typical fast food choices. I was however a bit disappointed as the No.1 bowl came with iceberg lettuce and a good portion of the lettuce was not edible- it was way past being fresh. The rest of the ingredients were fine but as other people have said it's a bit pricey for what you get-  $8.75 for the bowl and would have been another $3.50 for added protein. That's a bit steep considering iceberg lettuce is the cheapest lettuce you can buy and wasn't even of good quality."}
