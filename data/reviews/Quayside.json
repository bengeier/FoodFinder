{"text":"Got take-away fish and chips last time we were in Whitby. They only had one full-size fish ready, but asked if we were happy to have two small pieces on one of them. Very large portions - me and my husband could have easily shared the chips. Very nice - will definitely be going again!"}
{"text":"An award winning fish fryery,this premises is split into two.One side is a take-away and the other a spacious restaurant.The menu is quite comprehensive but typical of this type of establishment.Food is fresh cooked to order and arrives at the table piping hot.Portions are large and represent good value for money.The staff are both friendly and efficient and very helpful and accomodating if there are children in your party.An added bonus is that the restaurant is licenced so you can enjoy a beer(or two)with your meal.Even more enjoyable was the fact you could get a decent beer(Black Sheep) and not just lager.All in all a very pleasant experience and one I shall certainly repeat when next in Whitby."}
{"text":"Award winning fish and chips? We ordered from the take away counter as the line to sit down was quite long. Walked outside and began to eat (less than 2 minutes after receiving the food) and the food wasn't even hot. The fish wasn't bad but the chips are more like greasy sponges. Not a crisp one in the batch.  The fish is fresh...from Iceland; I guess that may explain the price.   Unfortunately there's nothing special about this place. I imagine every fish shop in town is just good. How they have won any awards is a wonder to me. I've had better fish and chips from a Chinese take away. Obviously the quality has taken a plunge since winning the award or the award giving committee got lucky. It's sad when a place works so hard to have a good product only to allow the product quality to slip after becoming famous.  If you're gonna que up; try magpie a few doors down, it's probably better."}
{"text":"How fish and chips should be! Gorgeous with a simple but perfectly executed service.  If I was back in Whitby looking for 'once' and a cup of chah again, I'd drop in here."}
{"text":"Decent fish and chips, cute staff, lovely bread. The line for the takeaway was huge so we went inside. Fast service. Tables a bit small. Great cup of tea."}
{"text":"Pros + It's a must-try thing to get fish n chips in Whitby, and you can take it down to the pier for the full experience + The fish is VERY fresh from Iceland  Cons - It's WAY too greasy. It's nearly dripping oil and you feel dirty afterwards - Tarter sauce is an extra 25p per packet - Cash only (for takeaway)  I'm glad I went and tried it, but I certainly wouldn't say this was the best Fish N Chips I've had. It was a cool 'local' experience however to take out and eat on the pier and the water."}
