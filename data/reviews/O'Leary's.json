{"text":"A family restaurant, where two sisters cook together. Good Pittsburgh Spot on the Southside. Cash only."}
{"text":"An old fashioned diner with a lot of locals but a small menu. Simple fair like bacon and eggs, pancakes, a couple of omelets for breakfast are on the menu, and so are basics like a hamburger, cheeseburger, ham sandwich, BLT, and a steak hoagie for lunch. I think I literally just listed 90% of what they had on the menu. I sat at the counter and ordered a BLT ($4.50) and a turner's iced tea ($0.75).  The BLT was made fresh and it was tasty (bacon crisp, lettuce crisp, tomato freshly sliced). Simple food for affordable prices with friendly staff."}
{"text":"The coffee came immediately, before we could look at the menu. Normally, this is a good thing, but their menu was limited and overpriced. The owner and her sister argued loudly and shrill about money with some unintelligible regular who had an recently snubbed cigar hanging in his mouth. We did not want to sit in this run down diner let alone eat there. We paid for the coffee and walked out."}
{"text":"So when the other reviewers say greasy spoon, they are not being poetic.  Not only is this place visibly dirty, old bacon on the floor, sticky layer of something on the chairs, wads of gray napkins used as a wedge under the booth, but it also has a pervasive smell of cooking grease that invades your personal space as soon as you walk in.  So, if you've recently had a blowout...keep your distance.   That being said, I had the MOST DELICIOUS EGG SANDWICH EVER.  I got a sausage egg and cheese to go.  In NYC we get egg sandwiches on rolls so I didn't know what to substitute.  The cook/waitress expertly steered me to the English muffin option.  In NYC we have diner links that they split and fry and plop on an egg. they often fall out and land on the floor if you're not careful.  At O'Leary's I was treated to a sausage patty the size of a small hamburger...perfectly flavored and featuring just the right amount of salt to wake me up in the morning.  Egg was both crispy and runny and the cheese was gooey and delicious.  In NYC, I'm going to be craving this breakfast treat! Cash only."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place! Spinach and feta omelette and grits! Run by 2 sassy ladies with awesome service!"}
{"text":"This is pretty much exactly what I want out of a diner. Specifically for breakfast. Quick with the coffee, very friendly, and I think very reasonable prices: $7 even for my 2 eggs, really good bacon, toast, homefries and coffee. What more do you want?   Oh, and the over easy eggs were perfect."}
{"text":"Great alternative to the hotel free continental...very good price and very good breakfast. Little chilly because the front door wouldn't close all the way, but that isn't enough to keep me from coming back! Thanks!"}
{"text":"The greasiest of the greasy spoons. No frills just made to order breakfast staples. This isn't the place for organic this and local that. It's eggs and bacon like grandma would make. Cash only, btw.   10/10 would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"so we went in expecting a greasy spoon. my poor stomach was already quivering with regret as we walked through the door and were seated at a tiny no-frills table. the booths are also no-frills. reminiscent of the old mcdonalds booths. and we seemed to be in the corner with all of the flies.   the kitchen is open and was directly across from our table. we could see them cooking everything in big soup pots and skillets - i do like that.   so why 4 stars? certainly my report so far has seemed a little more 2-starish. the food was sooo good! my husband and i shared the french toast and the veggie breakfast burrito and they were both spectacular - simple, light, clean food.   so really, this place was exactly what we were looking for: old school diner + totally solid food. we will absolutely go back.   [btw vegetarian friendly]"}
{"text":"Warm atmosphere, friendly staff and great home cooked food!  What more could you ask for!!"}
{"text":"Full Pittsburghese spoken here.  Belly up to the counter and peruse the plastic - coated menu.  No frills diner that slings huge and tasty greasy spoon meals.  Breakfast burrito was gynormous and delicious except for the weirdly sweet sour cream drizzle on top so skip that.  Pancakes are on point.  Martavis Bryant was walking out while we were walking in.  Friendly staff."}
{"text":"We just had our first breakfast at O'Leary's and it was wonderful!!! Great prices, great food, nice staff, family owned and friendly locals..... Does it get any better than that? The food was delicious, portions were great and we will definitely be back.  If you love diners, this is a great place to try!!"}
{"text":"A tough one.  Seeing someone work so hard behind the counter and serving up decent eats at a fair price, I can't give 3 stars.  But then the lack of anyone else working and the incredibly dingy bathrooms keeps this place from 5 stars.  I came in one morn and was pleasantly greeted by the Manager/Chef/Server/Check out girl/Prep cook and who only knows what else this lady does.  She quickly gave me some coffee and asked for my order.  I was killing some time, so I told her no hurry, as I glanced at the menu.  A steak and egg bagel for $5.  Almost too good to be true.  Although weary, it was pretty great.  Got some hash browns as well.  Was thinking 5 stars all the way.  Then I went to the bathroom.  They are dealing with tight space and i get it.  And as a place mostly frequented by locals, who probably just use their own.  But wow, down a flight of stairs shouldn't be legal.  And man it was dingy when I got down there.  I just chose not to use it.  Bottom line, stop in for a quick breakfast, but don't drink too much coffee."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been coming here for over 2 years.. It's our favorite breakfast place! They even have some lunch items! Try the potato salad!!! It's the best..   Love,  your \"burger girl\""}
{"text":"It's this tiny diner with an old country feel to it, but they sure know how to do breakfast. There are plenty of seats for a small group. The service was quick and straight to the point. They definitely try to keep it simple and real.   I ordered the kielbasa and egg sandwich. The portion was just right. The acidity from the mustard sauce added a pleasant surprise and bread had a nice crisp to it. The menu stated that the sandwich will be on Texas toast, but I think they just used regular sandwich slices. I was a little disappointed about that part, but other than that my kielbasa sandwich was tasty!   This place really knows how to do breakfast right at the right price. I really appreciate that they keep it simple, but yet delicious. I'm tired of those over the top and excessively extravagant breakfast places in Pittsburgh. It's refreshing to stumble upon a quaint little mom and pop breakfast diner like this one. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I'm not afraid to admit it, I feel WAY much more at home and comfortable in a grease spoon diner than in a high-end eating establishment.  Food has always been a comfort item for me and not necessarily an adventure, although there's plenty of those to be had in the Pittsburgh scene.  Back again and this time for breakfast.  The locals were there in force but they were super friendly.  Grits (which was AWESOME) and Eggs with Toast was the meal ordered.  I left with a happy palate, a full belly, and barely a dent to me wallet."}
{"text":"I've lived in the southside for 3.5+yeArs and was never fortunate to eat at O'leary's. More like wake up in time to enjoy breakfast food. We came in and ordered the specials and within 10-15 minutes we had our meals and sides. Great breakfast food"}
{"text":"I love that This place has a Huge Mega Stuffed Veggie Burrito and Awesome Staff as Well.Everytime I've ate here nothing short of Polite Women Cooks/Waitresses.Real home cooking and perfect if you live in \"SaasSide\".5 times that I was here just Great all around Stop in here and you won't be let down.Cheers Friends"}
{"text":"I've probably walked by this place dozens if not hundreds of times.  For some reason I always thought it was closed because you can't really see inside.  But one morning, after working overnight, some friends and I decided to give it a try.  If nothing else, we could wander on over to Jack's for cocktails if O'Leary's was a bust.  Okay, sure, we did end up at Jack's.  But not before enjoying a delicious breakfast at O'Leary's first.  The two ladies behind the counter work together beautifully to take and put together orders.  I was quite impressed with their efficiency.  My friends ordered omelets and breafast sandwiches while I ordered the breakfast burrito.  I had to, it's my thing.  If I see a breakfast burrito on a menu, I have to try it.  The choice of meats includes your typical: bacon, hot or sweet sausage, ham....but also kielbasa.  So I just had to try the kielbasa filled breakfast burrito.  You can look at my picture to see that, okay, technically the tortilla was not folded over completely.  But it still had all the ingredients inside and was topped with salsa and sour cream.  The biggest surprise was the fact that they use mango salsa.  I was shocked to find mango salsa in a place like this, and then I became very pleased.  The waitress asked me if I enjoyed it and I told her I most certainly did.  I was shocked to find out that this burrito is a new item on their menu.  I hope it stays there.    My friends also enjoyed their selections.  I believe I heard, \"This could be the best breakfast I've ever had\" come out of one of them.  The spectacle behind the counter and the friendly service only made everything that much better.  We all agreed we will return.  If only to try the grits and use the coupon I forgot I had in my wallet."}
{"text":"What can. I say that has not been said. Coming from Toronto where food can be over priced and your hungry an hour later, not to mention staff going through the motions....O'Learys is a fantastic little greasy spoon that's family owned. Simple menu- fresh coffee, huge portions and reasonable prices.    I ordered 2 eggs over easy, with bacon and home fries and toast. Bacon was enormous- perfectly crisp- eggs were cooked just right ( and I don't often find eggs done right)-  Bf ordered a veggie omelette that took up half the plate with home fries and toast.   It was all delicious and I kid you not we were still stuffed came lunch and only needed dinner!    If you want fancy and upscale don't come here. If you only have plastic hit up an ATM.   Although it was not our first choice I am really glad we ate there.  And would 100% go back."}
{"text":"Walked past this place about a thousand times, so me and my wife stopped! All i got to say is that I should of stopped here sooner this place is great"}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere in o'leary's. It's a little tiny family owned cafe where everyone knows your name by the time you leave. The place is very intimate, VERY pittsburgh, and the food is great."}
{"text":"Fantastic service, great atmosphere, and one of the best breakfasts in the Burgh! If you are lookin' to be satisfied, then look no further, my man, because this place is off the hizzy. (That means that it's really good)  Their chocolate chip peanut butter pancakes made me happy as a clam.  Seriously good food.  - C-Dawg"}
{"text":"Cheap, quick breakfast! If you're looking for breakfast and don't want to wait 2 hours to get into DeLuca's or Pamela's, this place is where you want to go. Their menu doesn't have as much variety, but everything is around or under $10 and the portions are huge."}
{"text":"I didn't really find this place phenomenal.   I ordered the breakfast burrito and a coffee. Both were actually really good.   Service was average, but there was actually a family argument going on at the time of my breakfast. I thought that was a little unprofessional. I understand it's a family business and disagreements and arguments may happen, but take it to the back.. not a front row show for your customers.   I live in south side and love breakfast so I'll mot likely be back."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon O'Leary's on a Sunday morning literally seconds after I finished a diatribe about the South Side's lack of breakfast options.  My BF and I had made the mistake of attempting a Piper's brunch after 11 am only to find a 1 hour wait and stomachs left wanting.  We were walking down Carson St. looking for an alternative and almost walked by this place, as many of other reviewers have said it is easy to miss it despite the yellow paint adorning the building.  A quick check on Yelp and we decided to give it a try.  We immediately found an empty table and were greeted by a server who took our order for coffees and water.  The coffee arrived and it was hot and somewhat decent for your run of the mill diner.  We both went with the mixed grill, his with bacon and mine with kielbasa (they do get kudos for having this as a meat option) and toast.  After a short wait and some attentive coffee service our food arrived, and our table equipped with ketchup and chipotle tobasco.  I could pour that hot sauce over anything and it would taste great, but I suspect that my dish still would have been good without it.  All of the ingredients were fresh and nothing was greasy.  However, when the server brought our food out she let us know that the toast did not come with the mixed grill but we could add it for a charge.  What savory breakfast of egg, meat, and taters does not come with toast along side it?  I really shouldn't gripe, our two coffees, entrees, toast, and the water that never came (minus another point) filled us up and came to a total of $20.  But charging extra for a couple pieces of bread when you are already charging $8 for potatoes and egg with a few veggies and pieces of meat?  Overall the food was good and if I lived in the South Side I would definitely head back here, but there is nothing here I can't find at my own neighborhood breakfast spots (with the toast included!)."}
{"text":"Perfectly cooked omelette that wasn't greasy. Real ham in omelette. Attentive and friendly staff. Definitely will come back."}
{"text":"My friend and I were looking for a good diner after a night out, and unfortunately O'Leary's was a let down for me.   Although I walked by this place many times on Carson, I had never noticed it or recognized it was a restaurant. Upon entering it is easy to notice the place is pretty bare with only a few booths and a few bar seats.  It was staffed by two older women and a younger girl who were friendly but noticeably busy.  Impressive was the sign on the wall celebrating 20 years of business, totally a testament to the hard work of those women.  As soon as we sat down we had a coffee and some silverware, but I doubted the cleanliness of things as the silverware felt greasy.  The overall feel of the place was like I was in somebody's house, and not a very nice one at that.  The menu is short and has just the essentials.  Like I mentioned, this feels like a person's house, so I did not stray too far from the usuals - eggs, toast, coffee.  The food was served pretty quickly and was piping hot.  While simple, it did not disappoint.  The potatoes looked pretty good, fresh cut with bunches of onions, and my friend confirmed they were indeed tasty.  While the food was good, I would have preferred a place a little more professional.  Worth a try, but I definitely will pick a different place next time."}
{"text":"Great and polite staff! The food was overall very good. This was my 2nd time eating breakfast here. Great options as far as food choices and I must say the breakfast burrito looks awesome. The only negative thing I didn't like is they used canned mushrooms in their omelets which didn't taste good nor blend well with the other fresh vegetables in the omelet. Other than that,  I would definitely return. Small spacing and usually crowded on Sunday."}
{"text":"Quaint little place.  Small menu with reasonable prices.  I REALLY like this diner.  It is as unpretentious as you can get and they make their French toast from scratch.  That's right, you read that properly.  They make every order of French toast from scratch and to order.  It is not taken out of the freezer like so many other places.  Coupled with the fact that it actually tastes good, I have found my new favorite breakfast place.  They don't do poached eggs, but the fried eggs are not greasy and always cooked properly -- so I can let this slide.  Items that we have ordered here: French Toast Eggs, over easy Bacon Sausage Ham Pancakes Steak and Cheese sandwich Homefries Hot Sausage patty  There are only two things that really haven't been that great here (in my opinion): the hot sausage patty and the steak and cheese sandwich.  I am not a fan of fennel, which is why I don't care for the sausage patty.  As for the steak and cheese, I can get a better tasting one at other Pittsburgh locales; doesn't taste bad, though.  Do not expect to go in on a weekend and have a long conversation with the people working behind the counter; they are slammed and it shows in their no-nonsense attitude toward everyone.  They are congenial but always straight to the point.  Not once did I see this mother-daughter duo stop to rest.  They were cooking machines.  This is one of the big draws for me.  Watching these two ladies work seamlessly as they create a little dish of deliciousness for everyone.  From making the French toast, to the fresh home fries, to the freshly baked and carved ham that they use.  You can see that love that goes into what they cook.   The only downside is the parking situation.  It is the standard Carson Street quandry: finding that coveted parking space on the main drag or on one of the side streets.  It is well worth it, especially if you like French toast.  I will be returning and returning and returning...."}
{"text":"This place is a pure slice of Americana. The staff are the greatest and fun to talk to. A place that remembers you. The 10\" Breakfast Burrito is simply to die for.   If I could give them 10 stars, I would.   A must try."}
{"text":"Great service, excellent food served hot off the stove! I felt like I was sitting in my mom's kitchen chatting with the locals. And the staff genuinely seemed happy we stopped in for breakfast. Next time we are in town, this is a definite stop!"}
{"text":"this dirty little dinner has great service, breakfast foods all day and a serious bowl of wedding soup.  It was a wet day in Pittsburgh and I was heading to the Bee Hive for a soup when I spotted O'leary's across the street.  Seated in the window was three Octogenerians drinking coffee and talking local murders.  I headed straight for the nineteen fifties bar stools and lunch counter and order a grilled cheese on wheat and a bowl of soup- my kid ordered pancakes and a side of hashbrowns- she thought the potatoes were as good as Pamelas and the wedding soup was as good as Minutellos-  the price was right  under $14  and the food was fresh and good. The atmosphere is south side hang over but I'm a fan.  only draw back is no skim milk only 2 %  Eat up."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best dirty spoon breakfast joints in the city. Very small in size but very large in character. This is one of best locally owned spots in the city."}
{"text":"This is the kind of place where you're served coffee before anything else. Your placemat is your menu, and the temperature control is questionable. But the sausage omelette features meat from schwartz's market. The ham is freshly sliced off the tinfoil-covered-baked-ham behind the counter. You'll watch your breakfast cooked behind the counter, so you don't have to ask the waitress any details, not that she'd tell you anyways.   My favorite part of O'Leary's is the decor. It's a long narrow restaurant and one side wall is completely taken over by street art. You have the requisite South Side tin ceiling, and there's always tunes playing on the mini-boombox.   The only real drawback of O'Leary's is the regulars. They eye you a bit funny when you first walk in the door. They turn out to be pretty harmless though."}
{"text":"I had the Kielbasa, egg and onion sandwich. What a fantastic experience.  Great food, fast and nice service and good music. Absolute best breakfast!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped here after we missed breakfast at the hotel we were staying at and I'm so glad we did. First we both ate for $11 plus tip which is insane. I'm not from Pittsburgh, and getting a breakfast for one let alone 2 for $11 is unheard of in Jersey.  I got the light with the eggs sunny side up and white toast, me eggs were cooked to perfection and I had just enough toast to mop everything up.  My wife got eggs n nat with scrambled eggs, white toast and home fries. She said her eggs were cooked perfectly and the potatoes were done to perfection.  We both had orange juices which were bottles of Tropicana which were fine.  The place was clean and the staff was very friendly. It definitely seems like a place where the folks in the neighborhood are regulars and I can see why.  Next time we need breakfast in Pittsburgh we'll be sure to head there."}
{"text":"You know how they say that the dive places have the best food? They are right! Especially about O'Leary's!! This place is great. It's not much on cosmetics but the food is amazing. You can tell the staff take care of the regulars and will take of you too.  We had everything from the omelettes to French toast and everyone enjoyed their food!"}
{"text":"Kind of made me feel like I was sitting in my Aunt's kitchen back in the 40's except for the 80's hairdos on the cook and waitress...and that's not a bad thing.  Homey, comfortable, a decent, basic, simple place...nothing wrong with that."}
{"text":"I had an awesome breakfast, friendly service, cash only so heads up you hipsters. Get the hoagies to go for lunch, I'm trying to keep typing cuz Yelp is yelling at me"}
{"text":"A \"greasy spoon\" breakfast that is about as \"authentic Pittsburgh\" as you'll find. I luv this place. The food is all fresh... ham is cut off of a real ham, not some pressed deli meat. The bacon is thick and the potato's are sliced right there behind the counter before being tossed on the grill to become home fries.  It doesn't appear that any corners are cut.  The portions are large too... have breakfast here in the morning and there's no need to schedule lunch.  O'Leary's is about as good as it gets for a working class breakfast. My only complaint is that they are cash only; no credit cards accepted."}
{"text":"We were looking for a brunch place on Sunday morning and saw this character place on Carson. The grill is worked by a culinary genius and the rest of the staff are friendly and attentive. Between us we had pancakes, eggs of various styles, bacon and home fries. Every single item was copious, hot and cooked to perfection. The food is great value and outstanding. This place will be on our list as a destination when we are in Pittsburgh.Cash only."}
{"text":"Food was OK. The one lady who took my order was having a blast with her buddies that gave me the wrong cheese and toasts. It was extremely loud for a 7am breakfast."}
{"text":"My wife & I have been to O'Leary's for breakfast about once every couple of months. Always the same hearty home style cooking. Their hot sausage patty is the best around ; and they actually take the time to nicely brown their home-fry potatoes.     I agree with other reviewers, it'd be nice if they weren't just \"cash only\" ; but that may help keep the prices low, which by the way are very reasonable.    This is just one of those places, that if it ever closes, would be missed A LOT !"}
{"text":"O'Leary's is a South Side staple serving up honest-to-goodness food at a low cost without any fanfare. The staff do it all, wait tables, cook, ring up checks. It's kind of chaotic, but the breakfast is hot and filling. One quibble, I ordered the Deluxe French Toast that comes encrusted with cornflakes and was so looking forward to it. I got the regular French Toast... Which was good, but not as good as I imagine the Deluxe version was. My husband got the hot sausage omelet much to his liking. We will definitely be coming back here for a quick, hot, and cheap breakfast next time we are up early enough on a Saturday b/f it gets packed. Best to go 1st thing in the morning. Any later than 10 and you may have wait awhile. Plus, which by 10, do yourself a favor and go to brunch!"}
{"text":"You want a greasy spoon diner? O'Leary's is a good place to start. The owners/cooks are sisters (I think), and you can tell they really enjoy what they do. They joke around with the customers and never miss a beat with the food. No thrills or fancy décor. Also, I think our server may still have been drunk from the night before, but it's all good, we don't judge. We still enjoyed ourselves. I ordered a spinach, feta, and tomato omelet, and watched as they pulled the fresh spinach and feta from the fridge - as in, an old school white fridge your grandma has in her kitchen (well, it used to be white at one point - more yellow now). The food was good, cheap, and fresh. The only complaint would be a lack of air conditioning. Thank goodness it was a little chilly outside, because even with the economy-sized fan, there is little air circulation."}
{"text":"Simple and awesome brunch. Very homely not at all greasy. Very friendly service, make sure you get the home fries either inside your burrito or as a side. Family owned and operated, beats Pamelas hands down"}
{"text":"Best breakfast and lunch on east Carson!!!!!! Homefries and potato salad are to die for. Friendly owners and staff."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places in Pittsburgh. I love the family vibe when you walk in - they always remember your name. French toast and the home fries are my favorite."}
{"text":"I used to live on 17 & Jane and would dine here are almost every Saturday morning after hitting the bars. Food is just fantastic home hooked meals from scratch. My go to is the atomic omelet then adding some siracha for more spice. If I feeling real hungry, breakfast burrito is the cure. The thing is massive and for the price well worth it. I don't live in the south side anymore but anytime I am crashing at a friends on a weekend you better believe I will be there."}
