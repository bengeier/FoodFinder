{"text":"The chicken shawarma plate is overall alright and costs $9.99. The tabouli salad is too sour and the colour wasn't fresh. Falafel is slightly bigger than a Timbit and costs $0.65 each, I thought it tasted like it has lemon juice in it too! No compelling reason to eat there, sorry. 2.5 stars"}
{"text":"Not to sure what has happened to this place since the 2009 review, but the shwarma they serve now is disgusting.  The meat is dry, with very little flavor, and the toppings are pathetic.     This place is a disgrace."}
{"text":"Alex's Falafel is now closed."}
{"text":"Looking for a solid shwarma, falafel or both in Markham? Look no further than Alex's Falafel & Shwarma (est. 08/08). I remember when I first used to hit up Alex he was in there alone with a handful of curious customers at lunch, until he became so busy he had to enlist help.   I've had over 3.2 million shwrmas in my life, and I can honestly say Alex's are solid as folk. I typically order a spicy chicken shwarma with everything and then some. Alex will dress it with all the standard toppings such as: onion, lettuce, tomatoe, turnip, tahini, hummus, tabouli, and a few other delicious additions such as garlic sauce and cabbage. The combination of toppings and sauces make for a holy medley. One of the keys to Alex's success is that he toasts the shwarmas well done via a panini press. This heats everything well together and toasts the shwarma giving it a delicate crisp.   As solid as the shwarmas are I have to put in a good word for the falafels. I'm a self proclaimed T-Rex, meaning I eat meat like a greedy carnivore, so for me to skip a juicy chicken or beef shwarma for chick peas is big tings.  The falafels are made to order in the store and the chip pea mixture is well seasoned, you may top it with any of the above condiments.   Overall you're looking to spend $6-8 for a satisfying meal with a drink here. This restaurant deserves a solid 4/5. I would avoid going between 12-1:30pm as it tends to get busy in the rather small establishment. There are at least 4 large tables in there to sit down, and a clean washroom. Mounted above the washroom entrance is a plasma TV typically playing sports or the news. Check him out."}
{"text":"Truthfully its a 3 out of stars.  My expectations for a shawarma is never thru the roof.  The staff was friendly and very polite. The food was well stuffed and done very well.  Not Bad...good stuff!"}
{"text":"For the price they charge is so little meet. The beef is chewee. Dont waste ur money and time there are better places near by."}
{"text":"Alex is a nice guy and I want to give him a better review but 3 stars is what it actually is. The recipes are great, the only issue is that the chicken is too dry and feels like it was cooked a while ago. The quality of the rice isn't that great either. Despite these obvious problems with quality, I still like the place because everything else is less than 2 stars. The stuff grape leaves are really good...must try them. Ask Alex to improve the quality of his food and he will be at 4-5 stars."}
{"text":"Biggest complaint was that the shish touk was mix of dark and white meat rather than nice breast pieces like every other place.   Was more like large shawarma meat. Did not eat the chicken, tabouleh was sort of off, hummas was decent. Delivery was fast at least.  Rice was decent, potatoes were too bland.   Will not be returning unfortunately"}
{"text":"New kid on the block. Good service. Nice and clean place. Decent flavour and not bad. However tli find the meat portion are not as generous as the fan favorite across the intersection."}
{"text":"Possible the worst shawarma experience I've had so far. Having recently moved to Markham from Toronto I've been trying to discover new places to eat nearby. Not feeling for Asian cuisine, which there's an abundance of up here, I decided to get a chicken shawarma dinner. It was cold, tasteless and tough."}
{"text":"$7.50 for a Beef and Chicken Shawarma and a can of pop.  The meat was dry, meat portion was ok I guess.. Cant expect much for $7.50 including a drink.. Can't really say it was a good shawarma.. Pita bread wasn't fresh but wasn't bad either..  Bakery items weren't fresh either..   Been here twice in the last 2 years or so.. Was really feeling a shawarma for lunch.. Ended up being disappointed..  Expected better quality for a mom and pop shop that's been around for so long.."}
{"text":"Worse shawarma we ever had. The beef he brought from the back kitchen was refried, dry, tough to eat and more than 90 percent burnt.  The beef looked black. Some of the food was put into the microwave to reheat before he gave it to us to eat.  Not fresh.  Alot of left overs from days before.  It was not worth $11 per meal we each spent."}
{"text":"This place use to be good, but no longer.  I went there 2 months ago and I ordered a chicken shawarma plate.  The guys gives me the left over chicken bits that were cut from who knows how long.  It was dried out and barely edible.  I asked him for extra garlic paste and he gives me 2 scoops of it from the smallest spoon I have ever seen.  I ask for pickle turnips he gives me literally 2 pieces.    This has happened twice already, I thought i would give him a second chance.  I will no longer be going, there."}
{"text":"This is by far the most disgusting shawarma I've ever tasted.  The skinny little joint like looking wrap has barely any meat or even vegetables in it.  I honestly don't understand how this place makes money.  Not to mention, it gave me a stomach ache at 3am so painful I was sent to the hospital"}
