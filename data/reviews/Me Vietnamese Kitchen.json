{"text":"we had it to go, so that being said. the pho was good because we love it piping hot.  we boiled the broth and the meat because it was dripping with blood.  the sandwiches were ok and a little over priced."}
{"text":"I was excited about having Vietnamese food here in Gastonia. The service was good and the food was good, which earned this review three stars..a fair amount of stars..how ever..the food is way too over prized. I ordered a vermicelli bowl combo which was $11. The bowl was too small and the amount of food given was also a small portion for the amount paid. I only had maybe 3 pieces of shrimp and two pieces of pork and small amount of noodles. Everything else was just shredded lettuce and two egg rolls. I make vietnamese pho at home and a pack of vermicelli noodles averages about $1-$2 and can serve up to 4-6 people. The other ingredients is not that expensive either. I wont be going back because they are charging Charlotte prices. This is Gastonia, the market is different. Please lower your prices or you will for sure lose customers. If your prices are lowered, more people will come and customers will return. I will return and I will bring my friends."}
{"text":"Good place, I like everything I've had from there. Sometimes takes a little while, but it's really nice to have a place in town that's different. Egg rolls are great. I like all the sandwiches (haven't tried the tofu) and my girlfriend likes the Pho (a noodle soup that cooks the meat in the broth). Hope this place does well."}
{"text":"Second timeback this week. The menu is small, and so is the shop. Not a bad thing, as they seem to be concentrating on what they do best. It is a very nice, very clean shop too. Free Wfi and the pho is top notch! The portions are very generous and the owners and staff are very friendly. I have been eating pho for years and this place ranks at the top of my list. You owe it to your self to try it!  #2 Fresh Spring Rolls - 5 stars! #7 Combination Pho - 5 stars! #3 Original Bahn Mi - 5 stars!  My wife and daughter had the #8 and #9 and give it 5 stars as well!"}
{"text":"It is so very nice to have some variety in Gastonia.  We LOVE the Banh Mi and the Pho at this place.  The spring rolls are also a favorite.  We stop there often to pick up dinner.  I hope we will support this new establishment."}
{"text":"Stopped here on my way to Charolette airport.  A little tricky to acces but once there was very satisfied.  Small place with a order at counter approach.  Service was reasonable and food was good, nothing fancy but tasty."}
{"text":"Staff was very patient and helpful. The chicken noodle bowl was great. The spring rolls were different than I'm accustomed to (but not a problem) they were very good. Definitely will return."}
{"text":"What an amazing addition to Gastonia. I've had better, but the food is very good here and so close to our house. It's nice to have to not drive all the way into Charlotte. The fresh spring rolls are nummy, they have really good pho, and also the chicken bahn mi is delightful. They seem to keep busy, but not behind. This is a good sign that they may be here to stay! They also have Vietnamese iced coffee. Yum. It's a very casual atmosphere and nice for lunch or dinner. Very sweet staff. I hope you will consider giving them a try so that we can keep some more choices other than nasty big box Sysco food in our area."}
{"text":"We've been to Mr.Lee's in Charlotte and loved it so thought we'd gives Be's a try and very glad we did because it was amazing. We got the cold cut, chicken, and pork bahn mi and they were fantastic. Bread was light and crispy and the grilled chicken and pork was perfectly cooked and seasoned. It was all very filling! I am very excited there's a place like this in gaston county and can't wait to go back and try the pho!"}
{"text":"For my first visit, I tried the \"combination bun\", and I was pleased. Compared to my favorite Vietnamese restaurant in Charlotte, the shrimp was more flavorful, however, there were only 3 shrimp included, whereas I get 6 at the other restaurant.  The prices are comparable to prices I pay in Charlotte, so that may be on the high side for Gastonia.  Still, it tasted good, and it's really nice to have a place nearby where you can get fresh food that's not slathered in grease (.. and I love my \"greasy\" foods -- just not ALL the time).  I'm hoping this restaurant sticks around for a while.  Give it a try!"}
{"text":"The pho is the bomb. Bahn mi is pretty solid. Well worth the price considering the closest Vietnamese spot is in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Good lemongrass chicken. Lots of vermicelli, slim on the meat and veggies.  Pricey for the fast food atmosphere."}
{"text":"Nice to have a pho' place in Gastonia. The prices are a little higher than Charlotte but the shorter drove makes up the difference.  The menu is the basic Viet staples.  My only critique is I prefer more flavor. I use a lot of flavor (herbs and spices) when I cook and ESP love flavor in my Asian food."}
{"text":"I have to agree with those who will still need to go to Charlotte for some great Vietanmese food like Vietanmese Grille on South Blvd.  My bean sprouts did not look fresh with the yellow bean, they were dark like if frost had hit them.  The broth flavorful however the trying the combo Pho...meatballs were chewy.  They don't offer the tripe either .  It is a great place for their tasty spring rolls but if you are looking to get your soup on I would suggest the trip to Charlotte."}
{"text":"The chicken banh mi hits the spot every time I get it.  The menu is simple...which works for the area."}
{"text":"The sandwich is so good, unique taste around Charlotte area. And the stuffs are very friendly . Nice and neat place to dine in."}
{"text":"Food is outstanding and inexpensive...Banh Mi are made perfectly and the Pho...WOW! Don't miss out, you gotta try this place!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. The food is great and the service is outstanding. My favorite is the V5 combination. It's my go to. I work close so I'm here probably once a week. Never disappointed."}
{"text":"An interesting little hole in the wall restaurant in Gastonia. Spring rolls are delicious and on the large size. My 5 year old certainly enjoyed it. Banh Mi is fresh and yummy. Worth the visit."}
{"text":"I love this place.  The food is always fresh and seasoned perfectly. A hidden gem. Its clean, cozy, awesome lunch stop."}
{"text":"Best Pho in the area!  Small place, great service and the food is delicious.  This is our go to place when we want pho."}
{"text":"Stopped here last week on the way up to NJ...food was so good we had to stop again on the way down to Florida...Ban Mi sandwich was just awesome.....!!! Who knew...in Gastonia of all places......"}
{"text":"I ate there once, I had the soup, the soup was $10.00. The interior was spotless clean but plain vanilla as far as seating and the room. The soup was good, I don't know if they make their own broth which is everything in these soups. But I enjoyed it, it was a very large bowl and filling."}
{"text":"Great pho, friendly staff, spring rolls are fresh. I've been to a lot of pho places, and this is worth it!"}
{"text":"Me is the go to Vietnamese restaurant in the area.  Everything on the menu is PHOnominal..... I've had summer rolls all over this country, these put all others to shame. Truly art, rolled in a rice skin. Worth the travel if you're not in the area, a Vietnamese cuisine destination!"}
{"text":"Great little lunch spot. We were warmly greeted. Asked if we were first time eaters and offered assistance with the menu. Vietnamese is one of my favorites but it was my husbands first experience. The food was generous and delicious.  Very virtuous service. We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Really good! The tofu was AMAZING! I'm vegan so opted to not get the bun with my meal. Oil dressing tasted \"fishy\", but may not have been. I'll be back. Good portion. 10 bucks."}
{"text":"Best sandwich around. The lemongrass chicken bang mi is one of my favorite things in all of Gaston county. The pho is also a delight to eat. The food taste so fresh and light. I have used Yelp for a lot of recommendations and this place made me want to give my first Yelp review!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Yesterday my sister bought 12 Banh Mi sandwiches for $40 but then when I came today I ordered 11 sandwiches which totaled to be $76 even with the discount. Very disappointed and told them I did nof want my order anymore because it was kind of a rip off that my sister got 12 sandwiches and 2 free drinks for $40. Never would recommend this place to anyone because you can go somewhere else and receive cheaper sandwiches and cheaper pho."}
{"text":"I walked in here and wasted a total of 10 mins of my life waiting for someone to ask me if I was dining in or picking up and so on, I didn't see anyone in the front. I waited for about 5 mins, a waitress came out to bring the others their food. She didn't bother to ask if I needed help or anything instead she went to the cash register. Then there a guy came out. He stood and look at me still didn't ask if I needed anything. The phone rang and he picked up the phone, the waitress got the phone from him and he went back to the back. Horrible! I had to walk out."}
{"text":"This place is open again, and rocks, service is great. Food is fantastic. The Pho is massive, and tastes amazing... we always have leftovers."}
{"text":"Swinging through town and found this amazing place. The Lemon Grass Banh Mi was delicious and the Bun was great. Surprised that there wasn't more people. The spring rolls are some of the best I've ever tasted and  peanut sauce was really good. Need to check out this well kept secret."}
{"text":"We love Vietnamese food but never had Pho.  It was really good here.  The nice woman cooking in back was making a new recipe and brought out samples for everyone in the dinning room.  Real food made by people who care about it.  Made with love I think.  Counter folk were really nice too.  Will definitely go back and try the Bahn mi next."}
{"text":"My first visit, a treat, Banh mi. I had the chicken, sister had the pork, we shared.  Had never tried Vietnamese before. Grilled chicken and pork both grilled perfectly.  Bread was just right. A delightful surprise.  Will return soon."}
{"text":"Great little spot tucked away behind Walgreens. The Pho was DELISH!!! I have been searching for a place close to home that serves good pho. This place is it! Friendly staff and fresh ingredients. I will be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"Went there the other day, tried Vietnamese food for the first time. I was very impressed with the quality of flavor and price. I will be going back."}
{"text":"My husband and I have eaten here several times. The lemongrass pork bah me is amazing. I also like their steak phó."}
{"text":"A noodle and banh mi restaurant located in a former Quiznos at the intersection of Cox Road and Franklin Blvd. And I call it a \"noodle and banh mi restaurant\" because that's pretty much all they have: aside from two appetizers (egg rolls and spring rolls), the menu is pretty much just four types of banh mi, three types of pho and four types of vermicelli.  I got the \"original\" banh mi: steamed pork, ham and pork pate with mayo, pickled carrots & daikon, cucumber, onion, cilantro and jalapenos. The bread was pretty good, and most of the flavors were there, except for a sickly sweet note, as if they used Miracle Whip instead of regular mayo, or added sugar to the carrot brine or something. It wasn't enough to \"ruin\" the experience, but I did not care for the sweet taste; it was a wee bit overpowering and unwelcome.  Everyone knows that Le's banh mi are the gold standard in Charlotte. Based on a sample size of one, I can say that Be's are about 80-85% as good as Le's. But they're also twice as expensive: Be's charges $8 for a sandwich I could have gotten for $4.25 at Le's. The trade-off is that Be's is much closer to home, and I'm often in the area for one reason or another, compared to Le's, which is always a special trip.   So... in summary: I didn't have strong feelings about Be's one way or the other, The sandwich was good, but not great. I think it's a bit spendy compared to Le's, but it's much closer to me, and I'm often in the area running errands. Perhaps I'll go back soon."}
{"text":"It is so nice to have some local pho. I wish their menu had more varity, but maybe in the future it could happen."}
{"text":"We moved here from Atlanta about a year ago and one of our \"past-times\" was going to Lee's Bakery (Vietnamese restaurant).   We found this place, and I must say, it is hands down the best pork banh mi I've ever had!  The pho was excellent, too.   If you haven't tried this place before, then you should!"}
{"text":"Very excited to have a place in Gastonia to get Pho and Banh Mi. My husband checked everyday to see if it was open and was very excited when it finally was.  We have been here twice since it opened on Friday and will now be our go to place for pho. It was very flavorful and fresh. My daughter said she could eat here every day. The staff was very friendly and the place was very clean.  The price for a bowl of pho is $9-$10 and they give you a large bowl with plenty of noodles. The fresh spring rolls are delicious and the peanut sauce is just right. We haven't tried the banh mi yet but am looking forward to trying it.   Well worth the visit. :-)"}
{"text":"All I got to say is, I WILL NEVER BE BACK. Walked in and the guy literally just looked at us. Didn't stand up or anything! So I had to walk up to him and ask him do we just order at the register or do we have a seat. Then he proceeds to tell me, \"just order up here.!\" Like wth kind of customer service is that?! But I decided that since we're already here, might as well give it a try. So after we ordered, he told me the amount I had to pay. While I was getting into my purse he repeated 5-6 times the amount I was suppose to pay. Like, give me a minute! This isn't a life of death situation! I was having such a great day spending time with my sisters until I came here. This place needs better customer service!"}
{"text":"I'm a Pho snob.  I know good Pho from bad Pho.  This Pho is not good.  Way too much liquid that is not savory or enticing.  And way too many noodles that seemed to be bound tightly together and prevented the hot liquid from properly cooking the noodles.  The meat products were skimpy and thin.  No beef tendon.  The bean sprouts and basil were not fresh.  They need a better distributor.  My wife had vermicelli noodle.  Noodles and lettuce were abundant and overwhelming.    Banh Mi was actually pretty good.  But, I was left with a fast food Vietnamese feel.  Probably will not be back.  I prefer Viet Thai Noodle House in Pineville.  Little further drive, similarly priced, but no comparison in quality."}
{"text":"Good overall experience, customer service is great, prices are a little steep for basically a takeout joint, if you care about that type of thing, but portion sizes are good, with good flavor, would swing through again if I was in the area..."}
{"text":"The food was awesome and the meat had a great smoky flavor to it. The dip for the spring rolls was perfect. Will definitely be back to try more of the menu!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to find out there was a pho restaurant in Gastonia, and even more excited to find out how good it is!!"}
{"text":"My son and I stopped at Be's and were very pleased with the experience. I ordered the number 7 combo and my son had the number 9. The pho was very flavorful and all ingredients were fresh. The portion sizes are huge and well worth the price. Very nice staff we recommend a visit and we will be back as well."}
{"text":"drove by every day for two months to see if they were open yet. I was so excited to finally get bahn mi in gastonia after moving here from atlanta. When I finally saw they were open I rushed in as soon as I could to try it. Then I saw $8 for a bahn mi and said WTF and walked out. A bahn mi is $3.50 to $4.25 everywhere Ive ever been to. Looks like they have the staple bahn mi, pho and Bun plates. Also vietnamese coffee was $4 which is a little high but where else are you gonna find it. They just opened and its a total no frills kind of place. Not somewhere to take a date which is why I dont know why they are so expensive. I really wanted this to be my new fave spot but doubt I will go back because $8 bahn mi is crazy balls"}
{"text":"Brand new Vietnamese restaurant in Gastonia. Located in the old Quiznos space behind Walgreens. Nothing fancy as far as decor. The people that run the place are very friendly and helpful. The menu focuses on three main dishes- Bahn Mi, Pho and Bun. The prices are reasonable but reminiscent of Charlotte prices (and may be a turn off to some, especially in the Gastonia market). The lemongrass grilled pork Bahn mi, at $7, was awesome - great smoky flavor to the pork. The Pho came in second. I had mine with thin sliced sirloin. It's served with the usual goodies (sprouts and basil) to mix in. The chili sauce here is great and goes well on the sandwich or stirred into the soup.  It's a little tricky getting in and out of traffic to get here, but definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Kind and welcoming owner, delicious and flavorful food, and generous serving sizes - what more could you want?! I look forward to coming back.   The pho had great savory flavor and wasn't too spicy or too sweet. I really enjoyed my pork bowl for the hot day. Pork was tender and had a nice smoky flavor."}
{"text":"First time here. Walked into a very clean restaurant inside of a small strip mall. This place has been open less than a year but it's my first time noticing it. I order #10 combination noodles. It was light and delicious. My mouth was having a party with all the flavor from the fresh vegetables and the pork was ohhhh so good. I will come back and try the pho soup next time. This is a hidden gem in Gastonia."}
{"text":"Nice little spot. There aren't many options for healthy eating in Gastonia other than Panera bread. And I get tired of eating at Panera bread all the time. I guess the better option would be for me to pack my own lunch but who has time for that? Plus, I like to find new and interesting spots to try different types of cuisine. Upon first glance this place may not seem like anything special. It's tucked behind Walgreens in a little strip mall type of area. I was greeted by a friendly cashier. It's a small place but the windows are bright and sunny. They also play R&B music which I'm a fan of. I ordered the #10 which is a combo plate (see menu for description). They give you a lot of food for the money. This combo was delicious. Skewered shrimp, tender pork over noodles with cucumbers, carrots and some tasty sauce. Yum YUM!! I'll be returning!"}
{"text":"Finally found a great Vietnamese restaurant.  Drove by quite a few times and never stopped because it is on the small side.  Also, since relocating to the area in March, I have been disappointed with almost every food establishment I have visited.  This place is awesome.   I had the filet Pho and my wife had the lemongrass chicken banh mi.   The Pho was fantastic with plenty of meat slices.  The banh mi was very good with a great flavor.   We also ordered spring rolls.  They looked like they were over cooked but they tasted great. I am a hobby chef and friends with properly trained chefs.  I am very picky and difficult to satisfy but this place beat my expectations"}
{"text":"If you are looking for an alternative to driving into Charlotte for good, authentic Vietnamese food, I have bad news for you. Keep driving.  We had egg rolls, banh mi, and vermicelli. Egg rolls were passable. Banh mi was $8.00, way overpriced, and was made out of a commercially baked bun. The nice steamy quality was not there, and the taste was off - pate overpowered the other ingredients. My wife's vermicelli had odd cuts of beef, a lackluster sauce, and so-so noodles, but the real killer was getting thawed frozen shrimp in it. We did not finish the food.  Prices are 150-200% normal for the fare. Small number of menu items. Place is clean but extremely plain. Location by Walgreen's at Franklin & Cox Road is a pain to exit."}
{"text":"After waiting for a couple of months for Be's Noodles and Banh Mi to finally open, we finally went today for lunch. I really wanted to love this place so that I wouldn't have to drive to Charlotte for fantastic vietnamese food. It looks like I'll still be driving to Vietnam Grille on 5615 South Blvd in Charlotte for fantastic vietnames food.  I ordered the vermicelli bowl combo and was disappointed in the three pieces of frozen cooked shrimp that was in my bowl. The vegetables didn't seem to be fresh and the vermicelli was watery. My husband ordered the banh mi combo and said it was just okay. He said the banh mi that we orded at the Asian market in Charlotte, Super G Mart was much better and only $3.50. Normally, you are served boston lettuce leaves with your spring rolls but not here.   We may have better luck with the pho if we ever try Be's Noodles and Banh Mi again. I wish them well with their business."}
{"text":"Came here for Pho, being surprised to see it available at a restaurant in Gastonia. Unfortunately it was quite bland and far from authentic. Mostly just chicken broth. Though, I might be spoiled from just recently visiting NYC and getting the real deal. Still, better option than any of the Asian choices in close proximity, so that's definitely a plus. Will give their other options a try next time."}
{"text":"This is outstanding Vietnamese food. Fresh, flavorful and served with great pride. I have never been disappointed.  Until today. I picked up a pair of Fresh Spring Rolls -- my favorite menu item. Upon return home, neither of them contained any basil or mint. Nothing but shredded lettuce, shrimp and noodles. Quite bland without those herbs. I called to inform them and was offered a replacement, but was unable to return. They even called me back to apologize and said to request extra basil and mint the next time.  (Perhaps they should simply stick to the list of ingredients on the menu, and I wouldn't have to request them.  Just saying.) I do appreciate their apology and the manager's call back. I will continue to visit, but I'll check my take-out order before leaving. Nevertheless, their Pho broth is delicious and the Fresh Spring Rolls are usually a knockout!  Everyone is entitled to one mistake and I give them the benefit of the doubt. If you're looking for healthy, tasty and fresh and authentic Vietnamese food served with a smile, you MUST try out ME's! I personally look forward to returning and adding that 5th star to my review."}
{"text":"I frequent this establishment.  Well used to.  I normally get take out of the shrimp pho. The last few times I realized that the sprouts were soggy. So this time I checked before I left with my food, while standing at register.  She said that they were fresh and refused to issue a refund almost to the point of yelling. When I got home I opened the bag and saw the black spots growing on the mint. It was great quality & care when they opened.  Not so much now. Could be a sanitation concern ."}
{"text":"The worst curry I've ever had, The rice was in a form and was so hard I could not cut into with my fork, my friend got Pho, and the bean sprout looked a few days old. Over priced, not good, would not go back."}
{"text":"Very good restaurant for pho. The store was clean and the staff was very friendly. The broth was so good that I could have it for all three meals of a day. Sadly they don't have beef tripes as one of their protein options."}
{"text":"I had the chicken breast pho and it was delicious.  The staff was very helpful (with it being our first time) and friendly.  I think it's a great addition to the area.......adding a fresh option to dining in the Gastonia area."}
{"text":"Small menu.  Authentic food.  Try the grilled pork vermicelli bowl.  I'm rubbing my stomach as I speak.  They make great summer rolls .  So i am obsessed with the lemongrass grilled pork vermicelli bowl.  Crunchy sweet/spicy/vinegary.. huge bowl.  Have never finished a whole bowl!  Their fresh rolls are tasty snd the fried spring rolls are amazing.  It's a small restaurant. Be patient. You stand up an order at the cash register. They give you a number you said down. At some point in time they will bring you your food and you will be happy and will eat it and sing a song about it!"}
{"text":"The chicken banh mi was great. It has the sauce. Better than Mr. Le's in Charlotte! If you are willing to pay for great banh mi, this place will not let you down. It's more expensive but it is bigger and longer.   The pho is good too. Great broth. The only down part is that it's a bit small for 10 bucks. Great food but a bit on the pricy side. I guess it's better than driving all the way to Charlotte."}
{"text":"Our first and only experience was ordering take out right before closing at 8pm. Got in the car and took a bite and realized the roll had no noodles. Another bite, no noodles. My son's, no noodles. Went in and asked them why no noodles and the guy said he was sorry that it was probably because they were getting ready to close. My take is they half way made the order bc they just wanted to get out of there. I told him this was our first time and that's very disappointing to order something and you guys knowingly made it wrong and shorted me to get out of there right on time. Would have been great WITH the noodles! Still charged my credit card full amount. If you  take short cuts with your food, I'm not going to trust you with sanitary food handling either because that's just laziness. To clarify, we ordered before they closed at least 10 minutes before so it wasn't like we called after they closed which still wouldn't be an excuse to leave out a main ingredient! They were just thinking we wouldn't notice is my guess bc it's one of their most popular items on the menu so you know they know how to make it!"}
{"text":"I stopped here while passing through and was pleasantly surprised that they had two vegan options. I tried the tofu Banh Mi and it was excellent and surpassed CO and other Vietnamese restaurants in the Charlotte area. The inside isn't really pleasant to eat in, but it's not terrible, either and they could improve by having a vegetarian/vegan snack/appetizer. Other than that, the food was spot on."}
{"text":"This place is super clean the service is amazing. The food is great tasting I can't say more because I'll be back again soon happy that they are here in Gastonia."}
{"text":"Food is absolutely wonderful! I got the #10 and the Fresh Spring Rolls appetizer to go. The food is so great and has a lot of flavor. The pork is amazing. I am super excited to come back to try the Pho and Bahn Mi! About time Gastonia had something new, fresh, and tasty! Plus, I don't have to drive 30 minutes for a bowl of Pho anymore. Thank god."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! So tasty. Thought I'd have to go all the way to Charlotte for good Pho or Banh Mi sandwiches, but not anymore. The Pho is fresh and delicious and the Lemongrass grilled pork is an absolute knockout. It seems to be a family run operation and they obviously care a great deal about the food. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Good food. Better than the Vietnamese restaurants in Charlotte. Brought my parents to try it out. Had the original bahn mi, combination pho, and vermicelli combination. All were good"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by this place. It's a small little joint kinda hiding in Gastonia but has much more to it. I'm giving this place a full five stars because the service was excellent. I had never had pho before and really enjoyed it. Since I was new to it the person working the counter was very helpful in helping me decide what to order. She checked on us throughout the meal and made sure we were satisfied with everything. I will definitely visit in the future."}
