{"text":"I haven't had Filipino food before, but this place will make you love it. If you don't believe me, go in and ask to try some samples, they're super friendly and helpful. 
At lunch they served cafeteria style, and you could get a plate with one, two or three entrees. The prices were very reasonable."}
{"text":"Tasty tasty food and friendly staff. Got the lunch special with pork adobo and a tomatoey chicken dish that I forget the name of. Lots of food for the price; I'm taking home leftovers."}
{"text":"Ok lang namn ang food ,magdala lang po kayo ngcash kasi popag card po ginamit niyo may additionalna $1"}
{"text":"Great food and friendly service... My husband and I only knew a couple of food items but they were helpful in explaining all the dishes to us. It's a nice family owned restaurant and we will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Bumili ako ng small order for lechon kawali but they charged me $6, but in the samples cups, small is only $3. Kung iba presyo ng lechon kawali sa mga ulam dapat i specify nyo. Hindi yung gugulatin nyo na lang yung customer pag nakapag bayad na!!"}
{"text":"Really great food! I like how they serve breakfast items like tocilog all day! The new atmosphere is great! Very friendly service and the food is very good. I found my new Filipino restaurant!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! My boyfriend Jon and I drive all over to try Filipino food and this one is pretty close to our house. The food is amazing and the service is great. So glad we found this place!"}
{"text":"Food was really good but service was pretty bad . Staff needs more training ... Counter girl served a guy first when I was in line first . After paying and started eating Cashier approached me asking to get my card again . She said she needs to swiped it again bec it didn't go thru . I showed her printed receipt and didn't even apologize."}
{"text":"Nanay's is a down-to-earth, must-try restaurant serving authentic Filipino food in Chandler. You can't beat their affordable prices and their endless options of delicious entrees. Their menu varies every day but the Sisig (chopped pork belly mixed with spicy citrus flavors), Kare Kare (peanut butter beef), and Leche Flan (caramelized egg custard dessert) are must-haves.

Also, they deserve five stars because when I visited on a Sunday after they closed at 2 p.m., the owners welcomed me with open arms and let me dine in still.

I'll be coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"Very unwelcoming and borderline rude staff and owners. They are the typical Filiams with elitist attitudes because they made it to the USA. The food was overpriced, very small portions and nothing special... overly salty/oily and low quality meat that belongs in a 20 peso cantina. Overall embarrassing representation of the Filipino community!"}
{"text":"Friendly & very accommodating staff! Food is great! My favorite is Sisig & Lechon Kawali. And I love that their food is always fresh! I recommend everyone to go!"}
{"text":"Never had Filipino food before but this place is delicious I ordered pancit noodles and the 8 piece lumpia the noodles are some of the best I've ever had and the lumpia is  just as delicious I would recommend anyone to come here"}
{"text":"If you are Pinoy you will love this place. Fantastic!"}
{"text":"Delicious Filipino food, great serving sizes and friendly staff..check out this place if you haven't yet! SOOO good!"}
{"text":"This place is by far the most amazing Pilipino food  I had in a while . And the people who works are very nice , it's a very friendly atmosphere . Can't get enough of this place"}
{"text":"I am looking for a place to eat with delicious food but has a decent price. This place is perfect . there food are awesome. Staff are all friendly, they also have this karaoke machine and you can sing for free. We will definitely go back here."}
{"text":"I highly recommend Nanay's! My favorite is their sisig and their sinigang. So delicious! The owners were so welcoming and even let us try samples of the food! I also went in one time and NFL players were there!"}
{"text":"Staff is rude, very disappointing experience. And are overpriced for the quality of food they serve. Will never come back to this place."}
{"text":"The staff was friendly and the food was ok, but I think it was a bit over-priced than most Filipino restaurants I've been to.  We were asked if we wanted soup, after we ordered the items we wanted, and the gentlemen urged us to try to the soup.  So, he grabs two tiny little cups to put the soup in, and we're thinking maybe it came with the meals because all it was - was just the soup and a piece of vegetable each! There was no meat included, which should have been in both types of soups.  That is why we thought maybe it was just a type of side soup that was included for free.  When we got the bill, we had all these extra charges AND got charged for the soup!"}
{"text":"I went here today with my hubby and we were treated amazingly! The people who worked there are really really nice! The place looked good, neat and spacious. There's lot of parking outside! We will be coming back here for sure!"}
{"text":"Oh man... This place is good! I rarely eat Filipino food, but that'll change.  I have no clue what I ate but everything was delish! The nice lady behind the counter explained all of the dishes to us and still, I have no clue what everything was.  My husband and I shared 5 different dishes and it was all tasty.  We had a banana jackfruit dessert that was great as well.  Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"I did enjoy my food here and the people are super friendly! The reason for the 4 stars is due to the temperature inside the restaurant. Their thermostat near the cash register said 91F and it was a bit uncomfortable eating in such a warm environment."}
{"text":"Nanay's is the best authentic Filipino restaurant in the East Valley. With friendly atmosphere, and service is excellent. Aida, Romy, and Alice are amazing! Coming here feels like home. Highly recommended for best Asian Filipino food."}
{"text":"Amazing food, if you're having a craving for Filipino dishes, definitely recommend this place. Friendly service and great food."}
{"text":"We stopped here after a long day of driving. We were surprised how good the food here. The staff was really and even offered me free rice and shrimp paste .We'll definitely come back.e"}
{"text":"Awesome place to go., nothing to say than its fantastic food and people ,.\" TASTE OF HOME\""}
{"text":"Great and authentic Pinoy food! .... Finally found a great place to have some of \" Nanay's\" Filipino home cooking!"}
{"text":"Oh MY. If you want homemade Pinoy food this is it. The atmosphere is family friendly no matter how large your family there is room. Today they were closing early to cater a business social...this is a  sign of mmm mmm good food. I had pork adobo, fish stew and rice. The servings were large I could barely finish. My husband loved the dinaguan also a very heafty serving. Then there's the broth you automatically get, don't miss out it is delicious. I like it over rice. This place beats other Filipino places in our local area. Definitely going back soon. Take it from this Pinay, eat here, eat good."}
{"text":"My daughter and I were in Tempe for a training and we were craving good Filippino food since we don't have a place here in Tucson. The service was great and they explained what all the tempting food was. The bistek was absolutely delicious and so was the pancit. Wish a place like this was in Tucson. Will definitely return on our next trip to Phoenix."}
{"text":"WOW, what can I say.  I normally don't give a review of a restaurant until I've been there at least twice.  So today I ate at this restaurant for the second time hoping that there was an improvement since the last time I was here a few months ago.  First of all, I ordered a kare-kare and sisig.  The beef in the kare-kare was not tender at all, a bit too chewy.  The sisig had more soggy pork rinds than the actual pork meat.  This meal which originally started at $7.50 ended up being $10.  The reasons I was given was that beef cost an extra dollar and paying by credit card costs an extra $0.50 cents.  With tax, this should have added up to $9.70.  Mind you that neither of these additional charges were posted anywhere nor was I notified until the total bill came up.  So not only did they nickel and dimed me for everything but they had the nerve to tack on $0.30 cents just to round things off to $10. Lastly, they didn't even ask me if I wanted a receipt.   I'm not sure I've ever been in a restaturant that served mediocre food and charged me through the nose.  Nothing has changed since my wife and I first came here a few months ago.  Not only do they have small mediocre servings, but they overcharge you for it.  If you don't want to believe this review, please be my guest and try them.  Just don't tell me that I didn't warn you!!!"}
{"text":"We love the food the service and the HaloHalo! Everything is delicious and well made. My mother is from pampanga and she can't get enough!  Great place for those Filipino food cravings!"}
{"text":"The best place in town for authentic Filipino food. If your in town, this place is a must. I would recommend anything on the menu if you're a true fan of Filipino cuisine."}
{"text":"So, after seeing this posted multiple times on FB by friends, I finally decided to give it a shot. Where have you been all my life?! It's like my own \"Nanay\" made the food. If you're looking for authentic Filipino food in the east valley, look no further. I like that they also have regional favorites and not just the regular adobo, pancit, and lumpia. And the price was on point! Will definitely be back. Salamat na po!"}
{"text":"Besides the friendly service, that's about it. I was craving Filipino food and decided to come here due to all the great reviews. I came, but was very disappointed with the food. I am a Filipino native and moved to AZ from San Diego, CA so I am used to quality tasting food. It's unfortunate.. The food here is a bit bland and a little too oily; my kids didn't even like the food.. I hope one day some good restaurants pop up, until then I guess I'll just be going back and forth to CA to fulfill my cravings.."}
{"text":"I LOVE Nanay's! Nothing like it in AZ! I can eat there every day because the food tastes like from your mother's kitchen!"}
{"text":"Great customer service and food was delicious! We had the pancit, diniguan, adobo, Shanghai lumpia, and turon. Loved all of it! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Just when we almost gave up looking for good Filipino food in Phoenix...we were invited to this small humble family business that surprised us with their gourmet taste on every dish we ordered!
From calderetta, palavo, chicken adobo, paksiw, laing and my favorite was beef steak smothered in onions over white rice!
I gave it an easy 5 star...."}
{"text":"I'm new to Filipino cuisine but not to great food & service. I was on a streak of eating there 5 days in a row because I enjoy the people & food that much! I've introduced my employees, business associates and clients to this gem, they all love it! The soups, awesome. The BBQ, unreal. The service, unmatched. The environment, home. There could be better Filipino food out there, I wouldn't know.  I do feel very comfortable saying their food is delicious. It's a must try. Top notch."}
{"text":"Food is very greasy and not fresh! The service is not good either the owner is very rude and Not very friendly. I stopped coming here after their upsetting comments about how I looked and how I awkwardly I dressed. The owner friendly at first but if you get to know them slowly they'll make comments unprofessionally and rude. I usually spend a lot of money here before but the other Filipino restaurant at Guadalupe opened I realized this food restaurant it's not even 2nd best. They're serving food while talking so their saliva goes inside the food or everywhere."}
{"text":"Authentic Filipino food. Prices are $6 for one item, $8 for two items, and $10 for three items. You can also order from short order menu. They have a pretty good selection of items to choose from. I got kare kare, mom got caldereta, sister got pancit palabok, and bf got lechon kawali. We were all happy with our choices! They're really good but can be pricey if you dont watch how much items you're ordering lol. Would recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Was in Chandler for meetings and before flying out on a red eye, stopped by this place to get a Filipino food fix. Arrived at 650pm -- 10 minutes to closing time. Owners Aida and Alice were accommodating enough to let me eat my meal while they closed shop. I had Bicol Express, Pakbet, Sisig, Dinuguan and a Halo-Halo for dessert. Hit the spot and then some. :) I hope to try their lunch buffet the next time I am in town. If you want to try some no-fuss, home-cooked Filipino food, stop by Nanay's (means \"Mom's\")."}
{"text":"My family are in a sports memorial tournament here in Tempe from Los Angeles I ran across the rudest lady helping out choose our food and pulling an attitude which to my surprise coming from my own kind after that experience I suggest that you avoid this place and the food is just a okay Fastfood chain is a lot better with their service with a smile need to change the way you treat your customers"}
{"text":"I tried Nanay's for the first time and it was delicious! There were so many yummy options that it was hard to choose. He got the curry with a bbq pork skewer. I got the steak and pork belly entrees. Flavor city! We also tried the halo-halo which is both interesting and delicious. The employees are super nice and welcoming as well. You should definitely check this place out for some amazing Filipino food!"}
{"text":"The best filipino restaurant I've been to here in AZ so far! I drove 20 miles to get into this place and it was worth it! Kudos! to the owner,manager and to whoever cooks those 5 star worth pinoy dishes! Truly a taste of home away from home.."}
{"text":"If your not a fan of pork then you should move on too another restaurant. I grew up eating Filipino food in Cali and this is not far from what I used to eat. Chicken or pork adobo is what I usually get but they have it all here. They have pork sisig, crispy pata, lechon, kara kara and pretty much anything else you would find in a Filipino home. It is cafeteria style so you start of with grabbing a tray and utensils and move on to pick your 2 or 3 item combo. All combo' s start off with 2 scoops of white sticky rice and then you choose your entree's. 
My order:
Pork adobo: delicious cubed pork in soy/ vinegar sauce. Delicious!
Sinigag: Pork sour soup cooked with veggies
Lechon: crispy pork belly mmmmm...."}
{"text":"Finally, Filipino food that taste like moms cooking, like NANAY'S. Our first time here and we LOVE the food. We went in the morning. They had breakfast and lunch, food is already made. Just pick which dishes you want. Of course it is served with rice :-) Price is affordable and the place has an open area and is clean. Although small, it's like your local mom and pop kitchen. The staff is friendly and Kuya is great! Will definitely be going back. Thanks Nanay's and keep it up!"}
{"text":"Being from California with so many options for Filipino food, Filipino food restaurants in AZ is very scarce. So when I found this place, i was thrilled! Their food is great and authentic and the workers are really nice. The only reason why I marked one star off is because it was so expensive. Just for my meal alone was $17!!! I got three items: Sisig, Beef Steaf and Caldereta. I was shocked it costed that much. But the food items were delicious!!"}
{"text":"Been here a few more times after my last review. I'm not sure if we just came during better times but the food has definitely gotten better. Lots of flavorful Filipino dishes to choose from. Their bbq on a stick is delicious and their sinigang is yummy! I don't particularly like the garlic fried rice but everything else has tasted pretty good. I'm posting a picture of their prices to be more accurate.

3.5 Stars!"}
{"text":"They have fairly decent food. I didn't get to try much since I arrived before closing and they were limited on selections, but from what I had, it was good.  I do however recommend their halo halo! It was so good and is a must try! 

The service was amazing! Everyone is super friendly and welcoming. I will definitely be back to this place when I visit Phoenix."}
{"text":"Jeepney Bistro was a constant in my lunch rotation for a long time. I've been to Nanay's a few times and the food just didn't have the same spark. Sure, Jeepney's fare was greasy and maybe these folks running the place now are a lot friendlier than the JB folks ever were but my goto dishes - pork adobo and dinuguan seemed to be a lot more flavorful the way JB made it. I've left this new place a little disappointed each time perhaps because I was expecting it to be the same - maybe I just got too accustomed to the way JB made those dishes. My bad. Bah! You can't step in the same river twice I guess (or restaurant in this case). Time to find another Filipino greasy spoon."}
{"text":"Ready to eat point and pick style lunch. Food tastes fine. Reasonable prices. 

Service not really friendly or welcoming even if repeat customer. 

Portions small. Unwilling to include lechon as an entree item. Ordered lechon, included 3 square pieces shoved in a cup for $6.50 made it the last time I eat here.

I understand this is a food business, Nanay's gets the job done. However, with comparisons like Halo Halo Kitchen and At My Place, it makes more sense for me as a customer to skip Nanays on all counts; portions, price, atmosphere, quality and service."}
{"text":"We had a great experience here. The food was excellent, the family running it were very nice and welcoming, especially Romy. At some Filipino place you experience \"Tsismis\" but not here. The price was reasonable. We ended the meal with some great halo halo for dessert. We will be back."}
{"text":"Oh my gulay! I lab the poods here beri mats! I recommend all da pamilies to bring their titos and titas and ates and kuyas and their katulongs and manong driver to try out dis place! It's da good one!

All jokes aside, I have always wanted a Filipino restaurant near where I live. Not only it's affordable but they also have a great selection of authentic Filipino food to choose from and some signature dishes of their own too! Such as the cream of mushroom beef with corn. It's the bomb! It's like a Filipino party in my mouth. Its succulent taste lingers in your mouth as you masticate it with rice! It imbues the consumer super-human abilities to a point where I felt I could eat more but my belly can only handle so much. It's that good! There is no name for it yet according to the owners but I think they should give it a name!

I give this place 5 stars!

P.S. Please add champorado to your menu! Thanks!"}
{"text":"Beef nilaga and mongo beans dish was really good.  Definitely would come back if I'm craving that pinoy comfort food."}
{"text":"I've never had Filipino food, but wanted to try it with my stepson who just returned from a two year stay in the Philippines.  The restaurant is clean and you are welcomed as soon as you come in the door. The kitchen could be much cleaner, but it's tolerable. You get a lot of food for the buck at a decent price. They give you a taste if you'd like to try before you buy which was helpful, but be prepared if you're not used to vinegar. It's a shock, but tasteful. I had the adobo pork with rice and some sort of a beef stew. Both very good. My stepson had the adobo chicken, with a soup that contained veggies, vinegar and beef. Very tangy and good. He was in heaven and was able to speak the language with the staff. They were very nice and we had a great time. We will definitely go back this Saturday for breakfast. It's supposed to be very good and served on the weekends.  I was told Sunday gets very crowded so you have to get thete early. I wanted to try the other place called @my kitchen, but it's in a residential area which was odd to me. I'm happy with Nanay's."}
{"text":"Well, I refrained from giving this place a bad review since I stopped for takeout when they were fairly new back in February. We stopped at around 5:30 and there was hardly any food left. Not really a good way to start a business.  The food was just okay, since it was likely sitting for hours.

And recently, I stopped here on Sunday for the buffet, and even though the sign says they open at 9:00, their doors were still locked and it was close to 9:30.  I saw some people working inside, so I knocked.  A lady who was likely the owner came to the door on her phone the whole time I was trying to ask her if they were open, do they still serve the buffet, etc...BTW, they no longer have the buffet.

She said we could come in and order a few things though. Huh?  It was awkward to say the least.  Almost like we were bothering them to run their business.

I don't know of too many new places that feel they're doing the community such a service just for being there, that we all better be okay with how they operate.  

The old Filipino place that was here before, even with their greasy food, was at least pretty reliable.

Won't be going back until the next business in this location opens up. :(

I see they posted new hours after my review - nice to have had that posted before it went into effect rather than after."}
{"text":"Finally! This place is LEGIT!! If you're looking for authentic Filipino food this is going to be my go to!!! Reminds me of my Mom's cooking! I ordered BISTEK, BBQ, ADOBO !!"}
{"text":"I came here today with my wife and I was very impressed.  It was super clean and everyone working there were so nice and very inviting. We got the sisig and the diniguan.  Both were delicious.  I think we will be going there for now on whenever we're craving filipino food."}
{"text":"Nanay's is a great name for a pinoy restaurant it's location is awesome plenty of parking the stall if friendlier  then the other 2 Arizona pinoy location I've been but the food is pedestrian like most California turo turo. But of the three I've been nanay has the most clientele"}
{"text":"Always very good food. The best diniguan and halo halo  I've had. The people who work there make you feel like you're family."}
{"text":"Good Filipino food! Great atmosphere! Has TFC playing in TV. Only issue was the portions was not generous at all. It's as if they want you to order more food."}
{"text":"This place is all about home cooking meal. The people who cook there are like family. I have been here twice and everything I picked was tasty and flavorful. I think if they make some signs to tell us non Philippino what the items are made of that would be great. 

Must order items:
BBQ pork skewer 
Garlic Rice 
Fried Banana 
Pansit"}
{"text":"When I used to work in chandler, I found myself at Nanay's every other week for lunch! Their food is always great and hot! Temperature is always something I worry about with restaurants like this, but I've never had an issue at Nanay's!
I also saw that they offer boodle fight, which I'm currently planning on booking for my baby's baptism luncheon! Can't wait to share Nanay's cooking with all my close friends and family!"}
{"text":"Amazing! Only place comparable to my mom's Filipino home cooking! Great local small business serving all the Filipino foods that I personally love. It's easy to spend so much money here not because it is expensive at all, but because they do everything so righteous and tasty! Some of the best BBQ skewers I have had outside of the Philippines were here (hope my mom doesn't see this). this Everyone come check this place out! Don't be afraid to come here if you aren't Filipino, come in and try something new and don't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Best Filipino food in AZ. Yummy pancit, crispy Pata, adobo. Alice and staff are such nice people. Everything is good. No bad choices. I recommend trying this restaurant."}
{"text":"I took my friends to try Filipino food for the first time and I'm so happy that I brought them to Nanays! They made them feel so welcome and explained all the YUMMY traditional food! And the karaoke was the best way to finish the night :) Romy & Ida were awesome and made the night perfect! Thank you Nanays!"}
{"text":"Love it, was disappointed to see Jeepney's disappear and this pop up but, was DELIGHTED at first taste!! Wonderful food, nice people and affordable prices for the portions given.

Try some of the more traditional dishes if you're adventurous and like to step out the box!"}
{"text":"Nanay's resto didn't fail to satisfy my cravings! First time in arizona and a warm welcome from the owners alice and her sister. Definitely will come back for more before going back to the san francisco."}
{"text":"Set up like the old jeepney's that was here before and the food is still really great. Adobo in every protein was great and I really liked their sinigang. I usually grab the melon drink but they had some green drink which I loved way much more since I love pandan flavors. The new staff and owners are really friendly and I'm glad it's so close to home for me."}
{"text":"The food is fantastic! The owners are so friendly. True Pampangeno cooking. Everything from the caldereta to the ginatan is great. If there is something specific that you want, you need to call and they'll accommodate you.  They also have awesome breakfasts."}
{"text":"I am pretty new to Filipino food, so this was an interesting experience.

The food comes on a Styrofoam plate like to-go hospital food, that was a bit odd. I ate something that resembled beef-stew and a pork dish that had bell peppers and onion. There was two scoops of white rice and I grabbed a water bottle. There are no fountain drinks, just coolers of water, soda, an tea bottles.The price was pretty reasonable given the amount of food. The payment that day was cash only since the debit machine was broken. 

The staff was nice, I had no issues there. 

The place seems clean, so that is good. 

There was only a few other people eating, the place was quiet. They have seating area in the middle of the floor for what appears to be karaoke. Most of the seating was wooden tables and chairs. I sat at the booth, that thing was super broken down. Sit at the wooden tables. 

Overall, I would eat here again if I was in the area. I really wouldn't go out of my way to eat here though. The high rating for this place kind of surprises me given it is in an area with lots of choices. Maybe I just ate the wrong dish, that is very possible given this food type is new to me."}
{"text":"This place feels like home! We gladly drive 30 minutes to eat here and we are always greeted by happy, smiling faces that remember us by name. The restaurant is bright and clean. The food is always flavorful, piping hot, and DELICIOUS! I enjoy that we are able to see them cooking due to the open kitchen. My favorites are definitely the pancit(s), lumpia, and chicken adobo. It's very rare that we don't get something to-go after dining!"}
{"text":"The food & the service is awesome! This place is highly recommended if you are craving for authentic filipino food! Halo halo, sisig, & turon are my classic favorite!"}
{"text":"Another great dinner for the buck!  As a single mom I have to find good food on my way home from work to feed my kids, and Nanay's never fails!  Had the dinuguan, sisig, and of course the BBQ tonight!  And the kids devoured it once I got home.  Whenever the kids crave for homemade Pinoy food and mom can't cook...they always ask for Nanay's!"}
{"text":"Sunday Morning brunches are one of the times that we as a family endeavor to set aside for a get together.

As my daughters have moved on with college and careers, we haven't been able to set aside time just to sit down and get caught up on activities and life.

Once a month, if our schedules work out, and everyone can accept the meeting invitation, we choose a place that is convenient for everyone to meet up and enjoy a good meal.

Since all of them are in the East Valley, we chose this Filipino Restaurant whose delicacies and flavor are very familiar to all of us. It worked out great because my wife and I were heading to Gilbert, and my daughters were on their way to watch the Phoenix Symphony perform this afternoon.

Nanay's is a great introduction for those unfamiliar with this type of cultural cuisine as there are a myriad of dishes to choose from. The flavors aren't on the extreme side, and the selections are quite palatable to the uninitiated.

Today's menu just had a great variety of delicious beef, chicken, pork, fish, and vegetable dishes that we had to sample nearly all of them. We all had two item selections (comes with two entrees and two scoops of white rice), and chose differing dishes. None of the dishes disappointed us whatsoever. 

Then came the obligatory Halo-Halo dessert, which is a mixture of shaved ice, evaporated milk, jello, boiled sweet beans, and fruits. Just absolute sweet and delicious. No complaints on this department either.

The place is quite clean, and the staff was just so accommodating and friendly. They were so grateful for each and everyone of the customers that were there. The whole atmosphere was very relaxed and inviting.

When we got done eating and planning our upcoming birthday and holiday events, we proceeded to leave, and Frank (owner and host), thanked us personally for our visit.

The delectable dishes, and the service with a smile will have us coming back time and time again."}
{"text":"Best filipino place in phoenix!! Better than h********* k********* hahaha its homey, its good, its affordable, feels like the philippines! For people missing filipino food, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"If you ever need your Filipino cuisine fix or want to try the food, this is definitely your go to place. I had the dinuguan (don't knock till you try it) and sinigang and it tastes just like my mom's cooking. I mean, the place is called Nanay's for a reason right?"}
{"text":"Good Filipino food,  consistent and complete.  They would rank higher if they lowered their breakfast prices and one of the lady owners learns to smile and not sneer when you change your order.   There is only one resto this side of town,  I hate when we go there and masungit sya,  which is like 1/3 of the time.  Love the guy who is there - always cheerful and knows service."}
{"text":"Recently relocated to Tucson, Arizona and there are no Filipino places around so we are constantly cooking it at home, boo hoo for us right? Any time we are in Phoenix however we stop in.

Sometimes you just want Mom's home cooking without having to work for it, and this place does the trick! Their tilapia tasted just like home, but I can't say the same for the adobo or pork menudo, in my pork menudo (respecting the fact that every Filipino has their own adjustments to this recipe, i.e. some use raisins some don't or some use achuete powder others not so much, you get it)...the ingredients however tasted old. Almost like they didn't sell it all and have been using the same batch reheated over and over.

The adobo tasted fine but there was also equal parts bone as there was meat in our served portion. 

Sinigang was wonderful. 

All in all the food was good and works for us when we have a hankering and happen to be in the city. But you know what they say, there is nothing like Mom's home cooking, no matter how hard you try!! :)"}
{"text":"I am very glad that a Filipino restaurant of this quality opened in the east valley.  My wife and I live in Gilbert and we take time to go here regularly. Here are the reasons why we love this restaurant. 

1. Cleanliness. This is the most important thing for me. That place has to be clean. The tables and everything else are kept clean. I give them 5 stars for keeping the place clean. Keeping a restaurant clean is actually hard. They do a great job. 

2. Taste of food. Definitely 5 stars. The first 28 years of my life was in the Philippines. I have been here in America for 20 years. My wife and I eat out everyday. So you can imagine that we have eaten out a lot. We never go back if we are not satisfied. There are many options out there. With Nanay's we come back over and over. 

3. Service. Everyone takes time to make sure you get what you need. There's enough cold water all the time. Staff are very friendly. 

Whether you are a Filipino or not, you'll enjoy Nanay's like your mom's home cooking thus the name (Nanay translated is mom)."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place a solid four stars. I have to say that Karen W. was right when she wrote that this place is a step up from the previous restaurant that occupied this space.

I've only been here a couple of times but have enjoyed the food. I've had the Caldereta, beef steak and some soup. All dishes were very tasty. My wife has enjoyed the Sisig and Laing along with the soup. 

This place is a hike for us so we occasionally will go and order a lot of take out. Masarap!"}
{"text":"Many years ago I lived in the Philippines. Eating here brought back many great memories. The food was excellent, the facility was very clean, the staff was very friendly. I would highly recommended Nanay's."}
{"text":"If you want Filipino food, Nanay's is the place to go! Wonderful food and wonderful people!!!"}
{"text":"Every dish I had absolutely bursted with flavor.  I've got to step up my pancit game.  This will be my Go-To spot every visit I make to Phoenix."}
{"text":"So good! The best Filipino food this side of town. The Turon is so yummy and made with Jackfruit."}
{"text":"Ma sarap! Delicious. I had the sinigang and kare kare. Both were fantastic. Perfect flavor. Not too salty or too much patis, just right and so good. I also had the halo halo, which is not premixed, and it was so good. The flan on top was outstanding. 
I used to go to Jeepney years ago, but it went downhill, so I have to go west to get good Filipino food. Finally, good Filipino food in the east valley."}
{"text":"Went to see how the Filipino food in AZ was compared to Seattle.  Very clean place, very friendly staff.  The garlic fried rice with bistek was AMAZING , and far better than anything I've had so far in the Pacific Northwest.  Seems like a fun place with a karaoke setup , restrooms were very clean and fresh as well, great place, thumbs up."}
{"text":"I'm happy that there is a Filipino restaurant near where I live.  It's affordable authentic Filipino food and so far I've enjoyed all the food I've tried here. The service is always good and the owners are so friendly!. They make you feel like your apart of the family. I like that they let you sample any of the dishes if you're not sure how the food will taste. 
I guarantee that no matter what you order here, you'll like the food! My favorite is the Sisig & BBQ pork :) Also I love their Halo Halo dessert. It's the best in town!"}
{"text":"Great Filipino food. we've been searching for a good Filipino restaurant since we moved here from NYC. Being Filipina I am a critic when it comes down to eating filipino food. Taste just like home. Kare kare and bbq pork are our favorites. My husband who is Puerto Rican loves the caldereta. Everyone who works here are very friendly and will always remember you and your usual order every single time. Will continue to go here as often as I can."}
{"text":"We're returning customers!!! TRY THEIR SINIGANG!

They have the best Sinigang and filipino food around this area. We're from california who moved to Phoenix. Didn't know where to try for filipino food. Asked around and finally came to NANAY'S! We drove really far to get here just to get AUTHENTIC filipino food! Love it here! 

-authentic filipino food 
-friendly service 
-affordable prices 
-no wait 
-alot of parking outside 

Delicious& will be returning. 

Plus, their management is super nice& staff is awesome and friendly. Will recommend you to try whatever they cook up ;) love it here."}
{"text":"Was craving Filipino food and this place always hits the spot. Their food is always fresh and delicious. I ordered the combo with the pusit and sinigang and tasted just how my mom would make it:) I also had the melon juice and it was very refreshing. The place was clean and the staff were friendly and personable. This is a place to go to get some delicious and quality Filipino food. There is no comparison as I have been to a few that does not even comes close to his place."}
{"text":"This is what you live for, finding the most authentic flavors in some of the most unassuming places. As soon as I walked into the restaurant, I was greeted by smiles. This place is run by a very close knit family where everyone joins to make it a success.

They asked me if it was my first time at the restaurant and as soon as I mentioned, \"yes\", they were very helpful in guiding me through the menu options and offerings. They asked me about my dietary restrictions and cater to my needs. Before I could order they also offered me samples. 

Food was very offended and then asked about some of the ingredients and recipes, the lady in the back was excited and proud to share that these are some of their own recipes.

They also had a drink that was made in house, with cantoloupes.

The flavors were excellent and they kept checking on me to make sure everything was good.

I highly recommend this restaurant to anybody in the area who is looking for authentic flavors and a laid-back environment to enjoy those.

I look forward to going back and trying more of their dishes."}
{"text":"Make sure you get here right at opening time (I think it's 10:30), if you want to find your favorite breakfast plate (my constant favorite is the \"longsilog\"). They do run out of the popular items pretty quickly. It's very upsetting when you get there around 11:30 and they're almost out of my hubby's favorite food, called \"lechón kawali\". But I know that they'd cook some more of that particular item (the lechón kawali) if you're willing to wait about 30 minutes. At least that's how long it took last time I ordered it. 

All in all, this is the place for authentic Filipino dishes. If I'm not mistaken, the family who runs and cooks is from this region called Pampanga, in the Philippines. Known for some of the best cooks in my country."}
{"text":"Typical Filipino restaurant with good to great tasting food. They however nickel and dime you. Check your receipts folks. This is a restaurant that charges convenience fee. It's more about the principle than the amount. Just like the menu it's not upfront about the charges on each dish. Extra charge for certain dish it's like going to the mechanic and finding out all theses extra charges. To the owner your prices are reasonable no need to pull one on your customers."}
{"text":"Being born and raised in Hawaii with Filipino food all around me it's a little hard to find Filipino in the valley. Walking into Nanay's and ordering a 3 entree meal with a side of lumpia's felt like home, food was delicious & service was great.  Yet to experience the \"boodle fight\" ."}
{"text":"I went to Nanay's with a friend today for lunch and being Filipinas.... It was AWESOME. Other reviewers were not too happy but ours was the complete opposite. I had the chicken tinola, pork adobo, sisig, & shared pancit palakbok. Everything was GREAT... The palakbok was a little different than what I was used to... Not enough sauce or extra condiments but the flavor was still good. My friend had the pinakbet which she liked a lot. We even had room for desert... Bitsi bitsi (glutinous rice balls with coconut) & Turon ( deep fried plantain w/jackfruit in a lumpia wrapper)... We were in heaven! I hope others discover this little gem & support this local establishment."}
{"text":"I feel like I'm being generous with my three star rating. It took half an hour to get to the restaurant from Central Phoenix and unfortunately, I wasn't too impressed. The restaurant is clean and the workers are nice, but the food was just okay. 

Our order: pancit, lechon kawali, Kare Kare, chicken adobo, halo halo and a bottled water. Really, if you look at  the pictures, it wasn't that much but perfect for two. The pancit was probably my favorite, the Kare Kare wasn't so good, the adobo was a little bland, and the lechon was pretty tough. The halo halo was ok too - not the best halo halo I've had. 

My husband paid for the bill, but gave me the receipt later on our way back home and we were either overcharged or the restaurant charges higher than most Filipino restaurants I'm used to. For our order above, we spent $26!! They charged us a two entree item, then upcharged us for beef (additional $1) then an additional small item for $3.50 and then the lechon kawali for $6.50. Then of course also charged us the water, halo halo and the convenience fee for using a credit card. That's insane! Totally not worth a $26 meal for mediocre food. I was expecting the bill to be around $20 (at the most).

Oh well. I probably won't ever drive half an hour from Central Phoenix to go back."}
{"text":"This is my Go To place for motherland food! I love the BBQ sticks and Pancit Bihon and Lechon Kawali. Staff is very friendly and welcoming. I saw a review on here saying otherwise, but I think it's easy to confuse rudeness when you're not familiar with most asian dispositions.  I see this all the time at Lee Lees, but they're not really being rude, they just look mad so don't take it personal lol."}
{"text":"Delicious, unique and authentic food. Some of the dishes are a bit exotic but the staff often let's you sample some of their dishes. The staff (especially Romy), is incredibly friendly and will make sure you will have a great experience."}
{"text":"Been waiting for a place like this to open! Was here on it's grand opening and to my surprise they had more than your standard Filipino turo turo fare! Such a relief to walk in and be greeted by beautiful smiling ladies! I went for the sisig and pinakbet and it was scrumptious! Then the daughters of the owners walked by offering free bite sized samples of leche flan and buko pandan, seriously which filipino turo turo establishment does this nowadays?!!!  Of course i needed some water to wash everything down so i did with some lemon infused water. Woohoo!!!  Again, fresh delicious food, lovely and beautiful staff!!!! Nanay's made me come back the following day for their breakfast buffet. Lol!"}
{"text":"Wonderful pinoy food and warm friendly service! Nanay's just turned a year old and would most likely remain strong for years to come! Love the Halo-Halo too! My son loves their pork adobo!!! :)"}
{"text":"My rating is 3.5 stars.  Tried this place for the first time for breakfast.  We placed an order through DoorDash for the Adobosilog and Tocilog.  The driver called and said they did not have the Tocilog so I asked for the spamsilog.  They did not have this either.  :-(  Apparently, they had Longonisa but this was not even a choice on the online menu.  So, we went with that.  The taste was delicious but the portions were terrible for the price.  Coming from the Bay Area, we were spoiled with the Filipino cuisine so I think considering the lack of choices, this place fills the craving.  Definitely, willing to give it another try."}
{"text":"Ordered pancit bihon by phone at 11:30 and was advised it will be ready by 12 noon. Got to the place 10 before 12 and that's when they start cooking. Ended up leaving the place 10 past 12, defeated the purpose of calling in order to save time. For the record though, food here are decent, typical pinoy turo-turo style. I hope they can improve customer service with a smile!"}
{"text":"Looking for an Authentic Filipino food ..., you are looking at It... Nanay's Filipino Cuisine!"}
{"text":"Got the chicken adobo, dinuguan and sinigang. All delicious, but the best dinuguan i have ever had! Will be going back everytime I'm in the area."}
{"text":"The food is soooo good, I love it there. Everyone should try their sisig. I love coming to Nanay's for breakfast... Although they no longer have the breakfast buffet, the staff always makes me my favorite Filipino breakfast upon request- tapsilog on top of garlic rice! On top of that, the customer service is great! I highly recommend Nanay's!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to try true filipino cuisine for a first time and im glad I choose nanays for the experience.   From the moment I walked in I could feel the passion the employees had for their work and how much they cared that everyone went home full and happy. The food was delicious and the restaurant was very clean. Anyone who is looking for an affordable meal and wants some true homemade filipino cuisine I highly suggest you go to Nanays. . After all Nanay in filipino means \"mom\" and they will take care of you as if you were one of their own."}
{"text":"Stopped by Nanay's Authentic Filipino Homestyle Cuisine for a late lunch/ early dinner. First time here, because we were craving Filipino food.
Everything was delicious, food as if my mom cooked the meal. Hence the name Nanay's (mother). We made the right choice to satisfy our appetite. We would come back when ever we are in the Chandler area.

We ordered: 
one (2 item combo) - Laing (taro leaves seasoned in coconut milk with shrimp), Mungo (mung beans stewed with veggies & shrimp) with rice and a side of soup (sinigang baboy)
One (3 item combo) - Sisig (fajita style pork), chicken Afritada (chicken stew) & pork Tocino with rice & soup.

And they use Tropics brand condiments such as bagoong, which I buy all the time.

And there's open karaoke, you can sing to your hearts content while you eat or after you dine. 

The people who work here are friendly! 
Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Amazing food here and such great service too! My boyfriend and I felt so welcomed and had a great meal and I would definitely recommend getting their delicious halo halo for dessert. I am for sure coming back again!"}
{"text":"Absolutely Filipino food craving satisfied. The family is kampampangan and you will definitely love each meal. We went there a few minutes before closing and they gave us free meals that are all sooo good. Everyone is so nice and friendly and definitely a place we will come back to. 
Homesickness cured for now! Burp!!!"}
{"text":"This is a continuation of my very3 bad experience with this restaurant! I was not given my order because I posted a bad review of this hell hole of a restaurant. After the owner read my bad review, he spoke to me & said oh we will not give you your order & we'll just sell this to other customers, instead of making it right due to its cook being so arrogant because the other waiter failed to tell them of my orders, he made it worst !!!! What a waste of my precious time, drove there for 1/2 hour & sat for 1/2 hour. What a bad owner, they just lost a good customer but as if they have tons of customers TO BEGIN WITH !!! But, peeps beware, that means they're serving a day old food, since I was supposed to pick it up at 6:30 pm almost closing time. But, let's see if they will survive AZ. For the stars if there is a spot for a zero star, that's what I'd pick for this restaurant! The previous restaurant in this spot also closed its doors due to an arrogant owner! Guys, bring your business to other Filipino restaurant. This is not worth of your money at all! Food not even taste good at all!!!!Not worth your time!"}
{"text":"Our go-to Filipino restaurant in AZ! Probably the only one we've been to here. Lol. I came here to order Dinuguan and Laing every other day while pregnant with my daughter. Seriously the best Laing I've had in a while! Their lumpiang shang hai is tasty as well!"}
{"text":"My wife has been begging me for WEEKS to come here and I finally listened. Wow was I missing out! I guess I was sort of leery based on my experience with other Filipino places in the valley -- okay food but waay expensive for the quality you get. 

I arrived at Nanay's to find a wide assortment of entrees to choose from, in the usual turo-turo style as is custom with any Filipino establishment. It had been about a year since my last dinuguan so I knew I had to order some (absolute fav!). The meat was tender and broth was on point, a lot better than others I've had in the past. The chicken adobo came off the bone well and the lumpia came hot off the stove! Finally, I can't forget to mention the halo halo which is the best way to cool down especially as AZ starts to heat up for the summer.

I also noticed they have karaoke. Can't wait to sing some OPM tunes at a future visit!

Looks like I found my new fav AZ Filipino spot!"}
{"text":"I love coming to this place. The moment i walk in, i feel like home right away. As a Kapampangan foodie, i am not easy.to please. But Nanay's food bring back my memories and flavors of Kapampangan cuisine.  My favorites are the pork barbeque, dinuguan, kare kare, sisig, pinakbet. I am looking forward to experience the boodle fight special that they offer too. Wonderful comfort food, very friendly service, i would always come back to this place - it's great that the owners are wonderful Kapampangan cooks!"}
{"text":"Love LOVE this place. Awesome food awesome service. You will leave this place fat and happy! :)"}
{"text":"What a step up from the previous Filipino restaurant at this location! Nanay's serves stick-to-your-ribs, hearty, comforting food, perfect for a chilly day! We came here around 11 AM for lunch and were the only customers here. As we left a few more people trickled in.

There were a lot of dishes to choose from, with a variety of meat (Chicken, pork, or beef). There was one section off to the side that had some crispy fish. I got a 3 item combination ($9.50) which included a plate of 2 scoops of rice. On the menu board it said soup was included so I asked which soup was part of the meal. The person helping us out said she could give me a little bowl of broth but not the other contents of the soup (Which included some greens and pork) so I'm not sure if soup is actually still part of the combo deal since my friend didn't get any extra soup for her 3 combination meal.

Each dish I had was very flavorful. I especially enjoyed the pork with coconut milk and green beans. Unfortunately I don't know the name of it but it was tasty! The kare kare and dinuguan I also had were enjoyable. My friend's chicken dishes were also quite good and the broth was lovely.

Drinks are by the can or bottle and include bottled water, Snapple, and various sodas. There is also a free-range container of iced water to serve yourself.

Service was good and the person helping us out was warm and friendly. When we entered the restaurant though the music (Tuned to a mix of \"easy listening\" artists like Barry Manilow) was cranked really high up to dance club level volume! They did turn it down a bit once I asked :)

I'll definitely come here again and I'll have to save room next time for halo halo!"}
{"text":"I have been looking for a restaurant that makes excellent authentic lumpia and pancit ever since I fell in love with it in Fallon Nevada.
Nanay's serves very good fresh pancit and lumpia cooked when you order. 
The staff is very friendly and helpful answering all my questions about the menu.
It appears they may be a family business and I love to support that. I would recommend that you try them!"}
{"text":"Very good Filipino food! Go closest to lunch when everything is freshly prepared."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch. They have a selection of entrees where you can pick one, two or three entrees plus rice and sides. All of it is \"home cooking style\" and completely authentic Filipino.
The guy who runs the place is really friendly and obviously proud of his food. He will explain any dish to you as well as give you a taste if you aren't familiar with the dishes. Prices are very reasonable. If you're not familiar with Filipino food be adventurous. Come in and dive in!"}
{"text":"Everytime I ordered lumpia shanghai for pick up, I always end up waiting for them to cook the lumpia. What is the point of ordering ahead of time if the order is not ready. I hope this will improve because there's not a whole lot of Filipino places to eat her in East Valley."}
{"text":"Growing up eating all of these dishes and now being so far away from my parents has been hard but NAnays has lived up to the expectations of my mothers cooking!!! Large selection and welcoming staff, I feel right at home!! I will definitely be a continued customer!! Great deserts too!!"}
{"text":"We've been looking for a good authentic Filipino restaurant for a long time so we decided to stop by and try this one. The rice that comes with the entrée meals was delicious and the entrees themselves were even better, my boyfriend got the one entrée meal with the Chicken adobo and was thrilled. The portions were plenty for an average sized person looking for a good lunch, in fact I couldn't even finish my whole meal. One of the owners continuously asked how our meal was and they sincerely seemed to care about our experience.

We saw that there were a couple of bad reviews on yelp complaining about portion size and unadvertised extra costs. However when we walked in, it very obviously stated which items cost extra and the $.50 fee for credit/debit card so we are not exactly sure what those complaints were referring to because we did not experience that at all. We highly recommend you try this place out! We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"The entrees are very authentic and cooked the kapampangan way. Today they have the \"lagat puso\" and it tasted like the way my Mom used to make it. It made me miss my Mom."}
{"text":"First visit. Very clean and nice folks. Had the adobo and pork blood stew. Both very tasty. Looking forward to sampling the entire menu in further visits!"}
{"text":"This is not only one of my favorite places but also a place I recommend to my friends and family! The food leaves me in a blissful high and I can't cant enough :) Beautiful people and amazing service.  Thank YOU for the experience!"}
{"text":"Finding a decent Filipino establishment in Arizona has been quite challenging, so I decided to give this place a try.  I must have come on an off day, or a bad time (3pm on a  Saturday) because only about a fourth of the tables were occupied, and the viands were close to depleted, and not refilled.  The Kare-Kare mostly had vegetables swimming about, the Sinigang only had pork fat floating in the soup, the Dinuguan was just soup.  They were out of pansit, and the only things that looked stocked were the Kaldereta, which looked like it had been sitting all day, and the Turon (because well, Turon looks fresh all the time).  Decided to try the Halo-halo (since I had previously been contemplating taking the drive up north for it--in retrospect, maybe I should have).  Their Halo-halo is definitely not worth $5.00.  It was about 1/4 ingredients and most everything else was shaved ice and milk.  The only thing that made it look \"full\" was the huge scoop of Vanilla ice cream (Not Ube--thanks for the heads up, guys), which I promptly set aside as I didn't want it to ruin the Halo-halo flavor.

The cherry on top was the lady behind the counter, who would be the worst example of \"Pinoy Hospitality\".  She was cold and rude.  Thankfully, the one guy behind the counter wasn't, and he pretty much redeemed the experience for me, somewhat.

If you're in the area, go ahead and try your luck at Nanay's.  But definitely don't take the drive just to visit this place.  Try the place just slightly Northwest of this establishment, or the one much farther North.  That's where I'll be going next.

I'm never going back here."}
{"text":"I just went there today for dinner and the food is authentic and absolutely delicious. I was in absolute heaven and the prices are nice! I ordered one order of lumpia, adobo, coconut drink, tilapia dish, and their beefy stew for just $19. The service was great as well, the lady helped me pick my dishes since I'm not too familiar with Filipino food. I highly recommend going here."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch. Too pricey for Filipino food. Nothing spectacular, although chicharon bulaklak is good. Service is subpar compared to other Filipino joints we've been to."}
{"text":"Went there for graduation we wanted a boodle fight however $350 so instead we ordered all a little bit of everything and shared it family style the owners were awesome and accommodating of all of our needs and explaining different types of dishes I would definitely recommend and go there again. Hope to see you there and enjoy"}
{"text":"Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink):
1 star:  Never again.
2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back.
3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad.
4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return.
5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.

Good, solid FIlipino food, though not the best in the Valley.

Ordered and tried the sisig, dinuguan, and adobo.  The sisig didn't have any crispy bits from the frying but it was flavorful and had the most vinegar flavor of the three dishes.

I like my Filipino food with a lot of vinegar, and the dinuguan and adobo especially didn't have much.  There is vinegar on the table which helps.  The dinuguan was pretty good with good chunks of meat and some spice from the pepper.  The adobo was average, probably the weakest dish of the three we ordered.

At My Place still has the slight edge on Nanay's, though I will add the staff here was quite friendly and food here is a fantastic deal.

Last note - get the halo halo.  It is very good here.  (There's a reason it costs as much as a single item dinner combo.)"}
{"text":"This place has the most amazing food, so delicious!! I plan on returning, its worth the drive!!!"}
{"text":"Wow! So good! Saw this place when we visited the butcher shop next door. Always wanted to try out and not disappointed at all! 

Great flavors from pork to beef and chicken. All entries come w rice & soup. There's even this beef soup that I swear tastes like pizza! 

The kids loved the food. Totally stuffed and will come back for some more!"}
{"text":"Love this place. The staff are so friendly and so easy to talk to. Alice is so nice, I feel at home when I'm there. The food is very good and reasonably priced. There was hardly any waiting, looked very clean. I was hoping someone would start singing on the karaoke machine. I mean, what's a Filipino establishment without one, am I right?  Lol. Will go there again and again."}
{"text":"We went in on Saturday for breakfast and all the food they served were cold except couple of items like chamoporado and corned beef hash. Eggs, rice and meat were all cold. It was a chilly morning and we wanted to eat some hot breakfast but didn't get that. I gave it 2 stars since the owners were very nice. Food could have tasted better if they were served warm."}
{"text":"Wonderful authentic Filipino food! Would be helpful for everything on the food bar to be labeled."}
{"text":"Tried this for the first time, I'm glad I did. Their Pork sinigang and Sisig are the best! Affordable price.  Also tried their beef kare-Kare - it is just ok. I will return!"}
{"text":"Being new to the area, of course I occasionally get my Filipino food craving. Immediately Yelped and gave Nanay's a shot. Cute mom and pop shop. Gives you the atmosphere of going to your \"nanay's\" house after tasting their food. Went during lunch rush on a Wednesday. They have a good amount of choices of food to accompany your 2 or 3 item plate. I was bummed however they don't offer breakfast plates (tocilog, longsilog, tapsilog dishes) during the work week, like most Filipino restaurants. Will have to pay a second visit on the weekends to try their breakfast dishes."}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing. I really feel like I'm home whenever I eat here. The food is amazing, they have all the favorite dishes that I have and it is really affordable considering the time and effort given in making the food! The people are amazing, they interact with you like you are family, and I like that! Some days they open up the karaoke for everyone to sing. 
I finally found a home away from home."}
{"text":"Finally got the chance to make the trip to Nanay's after having this on my bookmark list for so long. This family owned restaurant is nestled in a small strip mall off Warner and Alma School. The restaurant embodies all the qualities of Filipino people - hospitable, kind and extremely helpful. The owner of the restaurant greeted my partner and I at the counter and asked if it was our first time there -yes and if we have ever eaten Filipino food - no. He whipped out a couple sample cups and started to explain the different food there. Also, he told us that we can try the food before buying so that we like what we buy. We bought the two entrees combo, which comes with soup and rice. I highly recommend the pork adobo and sinigang. If you're up for something a little on the wilder side, try the pork in pig's blood. They call it chocolate pork."}
{"text":"When I miss my Mom's Filipino cooking,  I come here.  The dinuguan and paksiw are my favorite.  If you want a particular dish,  go when they first open.  Things can run out fast. The staff is always polite and answers any questions I have about the food. There's plenty of seating.  The dining area atmosphere is not the best,  but it's clean and it's all about the food anyways.   I believe they usually have a tv on airing Filipino shows."}
{"text":"Bored with the local fast food places I wanted to look into local great restaurants. I've never had Filipino food before and the reviews made me go here. 

The food was absolutely amazing. A good friend of mine recommended the Adobo, pancit, or lumpia. Everything was A +. Customer service was also outstanding, and I felt like a valued customer and not another dollar. Will recommend and come back."}
{"text":"Second time in a row,  no Longanesa.  Half hour in line and 1 hour after opening.  Very unsatisfied.   If you know you have a high demand for an item make more for the day."}
{"text":"I'm capampangan so I expected a lot from this restaurant. I heard this restaurant was owned by a family who is capampangan I then told myself I have to try this restaurant around my area! Which is in Chandler. I have a lot of filipino co workers who have told me I would be disappointed and I will not like it since I had high expectations when it comes to filipino food. I didn't believe them because everyone has different taste and point of view. I gave this place a try and they were absolutely right. I wasn't too impressed I tried their pancit and it didn't have that much taste it was just blah. The rice seemed like they put too much water in it. It didn't taste like jasmine or asian rice at all. The  kare kare was just terrible and it didn't taste like it was supposed to. I'm just being honest here. The lumpia was too small and had very little meat in it. It seemed like I was just eating the lumpia wrapper. The turon was probably the best one out of all that I ordered. Yes I know they mentioned that this restaurant will be a little overpriced. However, you have to understand for what your consumers are paying for, your food should be at least way up there meaning they should taste right and obviously people might think it's delicious. Based on your yelp reviews and pictures I thought this restaurant would be a hit! I came here twice and I was not satisfied. Very disappointing for a filipino restaurant. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Great food and the friendliest people. That halo-halo is straight from the island, I swear it. Nobody does it better than Pampanga"}
{"text":"Food was fresh, plenty of choices. Restaurant clean, staff really nice! Portions were perfect size and price is very reasonable. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I\"m so happy I found this place!friendly staff and the place is really clean..got mirienda time halo halo and bilo bilo yum yum  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Had my first Nanay's experience today and was very impressed. The man who helped us could tell we weren't sure so he asked us if we'd been there before and when we said no he took the time to explain all the dishes as well as give us free samples of whatever we wanted because as he said \"I want to make sure you are happy with your choices\" or something to that effect. Talk about service and a wow experience. He was always smiling and seemed like he was truly passionate about what he does and sharing their food with the world. Prior to this the only time I'd had Filipino food was a rice cake desert a patient of mine brought in once so I'd never had entrees. There were way more choices than I expected (~12) and the food was all interesting and unique to me which was exactly what I was looking for and attracted me to Nanay's in the first place. Oh and it tasted great. Awesome experience. Service and food both exceeded my expectations. I'll be back soon. If you read this far just go there and try it yourself!!"}
{"text":"First of all... With a name like mother's how could it be nothing but delicious!!! It was like food from my own (Filipino) mother. Reasonable prices and good portions. They even let you have samples of the food. Was very impressed and this is coming from someone who had Filipino food her whole life! Definitely worth the drive from north Scottsdale."}
{"text":"'Open' sign was on and it was still about 6:35PM, but they were already closing up and putting stuff away. SMH."}
{"text":"Nostalgic, authentic filipino cuisine. From their breakfast buffets on the weekends and variety of dishes, I'll be returning with friends!"}
{"text":"This was a great surprise in a little strip mall. I suggest you check it out. Very friendly staff and the food was amazing."}
{"text":"Since I've never tasted Filipino food before, we came here to give it a try. Similar to many fast food restaurants, you get in line, pick out 1-3 items for entrée and they serve it with rice. I forgot the names of the two entrees that I ordered. They were a bit too oily or salty for my taste. The service was outstanding. The lady who explained different types of choices to us was very nice, friendly, and helpful. I did see many Filipinos having dinner here that night. That usually means the food is authentic enough for them to keep on coming right? Overall, food is average, service is awesome and the general seating areas are clean and organized."}
